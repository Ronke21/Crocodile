<text>Amiens ( ; ; , or ) is a city and commune in northern France, located north of Paris and south-west of Lille. It is the capital of the Somme department in the region of Hauts-de-France and had a population of 135,429, as of 2021. A central landmark of the city is Amiens Cathedral, the largest Gothic cathedral in France. Amiens also has one of the largest university hospitals in France, with a capacity of 1,200 beds. The author Jules Verne lived in Amiens from 1871 until his death in 1905, and served on the city council for 15 years. Amiens is the birthplace of French president Emmanuel Macron.

The town was fought over during both World Wars, suffering significant damage, and was repeatedly occupied by both sides. The 1918 Battle of Amiens was the opening phase of the Hundred Days Offensive which directly led to the Armistice with Germany. The Royal Air Force heavily bombed the town during the Second World War. In the aftermath, the city was rebuilt according to Pierre Dufau&#x27;s plans with wider streets to ease traffic congestion. These newer structures were primarily built of brick, concrete and white stone with slate roofs. The architect Auguste Perret designed the Gare d&#x27;Amiens train station and nearby Tour Perret.

Amiens has an important historical and cultural heritage, on which a significant amount of tourism is based. Apart from the cathedral, there are the , the , the Tour Perret, the Musée de Picardie, the , and the Saint-Leu and Saint-Maurice neighborhoods. A total of 60 monuments are listed in the inventory of monuments historiques, over 1600 places and monuments listed in the general inventory of cultural heritage, and 187 objects listed in the inventory of monuments historiques. During December, the town hosts the largest Christmas market in northern France. It is known for a few local foods, including &quot;macarons d&#x27;Amiens&quot;, almond paste biscuits; &quot;tuiles amienoises&quot;, chocolate and orange curved biscuits; &quot;pâté de canard d&#x27;Amiens&quot;, duck pâté in pastry; &quot;la ficelle Picarde&quot;, an oven-baked cheese-topped crêpe; and &quot;flamiche aux poireaux&quot;, a puff pastry tart made with leeks and cream.

==History==

The first known settlement at this location was Samarobriva (&quot;Somme bridge&quot;), the central settlement of the Ambiani tribe, one of the principal tribes of Gaul. The Romans named the town Ambianum, meaning settlement of the Ambiani people. 
Amiens was part of Francia starting from the 5th century. The Normans sacked the city in 859 and again in 882.

In 1113, the city was recognized by King Louis VI of France, and in 1185 it was linked to the Crown of France. In 1597, Spanish soldiers held the city during the six-month Siege of Amiens, before Henry IV regained control. During the 18th and 19th century, the textile tradition of Amiens became famous for its velours. As a result of the French Revolution, the provinces of France were dismantled and the territory was organised into departments. Much of Picardy became the newly created department of Somme with Amiens as the departmental capital. During the industrial revolution, the city walls were demolished, opening up space for large boulevards around the town center. The Henriville neighborhood in the south of the city was developed around this time. In 1848, the first railway arrived in Amiens, linking the city to Boulogne-sur-Mer. During the 1870 Battle of Amiens, the city was occupied by invading Prussian forces.

The town was fought over during both the First and Second World Wars, suffering significant damage and being occupied several times by both sides. The 1918 Battle of Amiens was the opening phase of the Hundred Days Offensive which led directly to the Armistice with Germany that ended the war. In June 1944 following D-Day, Amiens was heavily bombed by the Royal Air Force. The town was liberated by British forces on 31 August. The city was rebuilt according to Pierre Dufau&#x27;s plans with a focus on widening the streets to ease traffic congestion. These newer structures were primarily built of brick, concrete and white stone with slate roofs. The architect Auguste Perret designed the Gare d&#x27;Amiens train station and nearby Tour Perret.

==Geography==

===Location===

Amiens, once regional prefecture of the former Picardy Region, is the prefecture of the Somme department, one of the three departments (with Oise and Aisne) in the region. Located in the Paris Basin, the city benefits from a privileged geographical position, with close proximity to Paris, Lille, Rouen, London and Brussels. At the crossroads of major European routes of travel (A1, A16 and A29), the city is also at the heart of a major rail star.

As the crow flies, the city is north of Paris, south-west of Lille, north-east of Rouen, east-north-east of Le Havre and north-west of Reims. At the regional level, Amiens is located north of Beauvais, west of Saint-Quentin, from Compiègne and from Laon.

In area, Amiens is the third-largest settlement in the Somme, after Crécy-en-Ponthieu and Hornoy-le-Bourg.

===Geography and relief===
The area of the commune is ; the altitude varies between .

===Hydrography: Somme and canal, Avre and Selle===


The main stem of the River Somme passes through Amiens and is generally benign, except during exceptional floods that can last up to several weeks (such as in spring 2001). It is also, on its southeastern outskirts, close to Camon and Longueau, the confluence with its main tributary on the left bank (to the south), and the Avre. The Selle enters from the northwest of Amiens, with two arms (including the Haute Selle) passing behind the Unicorn Stadium, the exhibition park, the megacity and horse racing track, then passing the end of the &quot;Promenade de la Hotoie&quot; and the zoo of Amiens, and to the right of the water treatment plant, in front of the island Sainte-Aragone, opposite the cemetery of La Madeleine in Amiens.

The city developed in a natural narrowing of the river due to the advance of the rim of the Picard plateau in Saint-Pierre (ford crossing). The Amiens citadel is built on this limestone butte of the Picard plateau and &quot;Rue Saint-Pierre&quot; is a slightly inclined path to leave the city from the north. At this narrowing, a network of narrow canals led to the construction of bridges and buildings including textile mills in the Middle Ages.

The marshes of the old bed of the river Somme was used to dig peat. Farmers maintained rieux, canals and ditches by cleaning out the silt and used it to append to their vegetable garden plot. During the 20th century maintenance of the canals was stopped and gardens were gradually left to lie fallow or sold to private individuals who created pleasure gardens accessible by boat.

The hydrographic network has always been an important city-operated asset. The river helped shape the identity of the landscape, urban and economic territory. It is around the Saint-Leu and Saint-Maurice neighborhoods that border the River Somme, as well as most of the administrative and civil area of the current city center which the city has developed since antiquity.

The Canal de la Somme dates from the beginning of the 19th century and the bridge at the foot of the citadel was built after World War II.

===Climate===
Amiens has the typical oceanic climate of the north of France, with relatively mild winters, cool summers, and rainfall well distributed throughout the year.


===Transport===
Amiens is a hub between the Île de France and the rest of northern France; Normandy and Benelux; and France and Great Britain. Amiens is not directly on principal European road and rail arteries, such as the A1 motorway and the Paris-Lille TGV train line, at present.

However, due to its position halfway between the urban areas of Lille and Paris, Amiens has good conditions for service and accessibility, including motorways (at the junction of the A16 and A29).

==== Rail ====
Amiens station is served by regional train services to destinations that include Rouen, Calais, Lille, Reims, Compiègne and Paris-Nord. Saint-Roch (Somme) station in the western part of the city is served by local trains towards Rouen and Abbeville. A regular bus route with the TGV Haute-Picardie station also provides access to the Charles-de-Gaulle Airport station. On the horizon of 2025, the Roissy–Picardie Link will put Amiens 55 minutes from Paris Charles-de-Gaulle Airport and its TGV station.

By train, Amiens is located at:

====Roads====
Since antiquity, Amiens has been a crossroads of important routes. The contemporary city is served by the A16 and A29 autoroutes. The Jules Verne Viaduct, long, crosses the River Somme to the east of the city and allows circumvention of the city by motorway-type roads. The A16 and A29 autoroutes, the RN1 and the RN25 form a bypass-type motorway around the city that the population has called the or Amiens ring road. Initially constituting national roads which are downgraded today, mostly as departmental roads, the greater urban area of Amiens is served by:

Amiens is served by several motorways:
* A16 to Calais via Abbeville and Boulogne-sur-Mer
* A16 to Paris via Beauvais
* A29 to Rouen and Le Havre via Neufchâtel-en-Bray
* A29 to Reims via Saint-Quentin and Laon
* The proposed A24 autoroute from Amiens to Lille via Doullens was cancelled in 2006.

====Parking====
According to the urban transport plan (PDU) approved 19 December 2013 for the period 2013–2023 parking supply is considered abundant in Amiens. Although important, demand for parking is less than what is available (capacity reserves are still 20% minimum: If the road is sometimes saturated, the occupancy rate of the underground parking remains globally less than 100%).

In 2013, the city counted approximately 70,000 public parking spaces, including 8,400 in the city center and in its immediate vicinity, where 70% of places are paid.
* 4,400 spaces on highways (1,950 in the inner city, including 1,600 paid)
* 4,000 spaces in underground parking (620 other new places are programmed in a project for the Gare La Vallée development zone).

, a residential parking system has been deployed in Saint-Anne ward to cope with congestion in the streets caused by SNCF railway station users. During the campaign for the municipal election of 2008, parking was one of the important topics of debate. A year after the change of majority, the team launched a consultation with the population. From 2011, residential parking was extended to the Gare-La-Vallée and Riolan neighborhoods, then in 2012 to the Noyon neighborhood and the area east of the Riolan sector. In 2014, 2,600 parking spaces were affected by this system which allowed city residents more parking near their homes in order to promote a better rotation of vehicles in the streets and reduce permanent occupation of public space by the cars cluttering the highway.

====Public transport====
Amiens was once served by with a combined length of , opened in 1887. They intersected at &quot;Place Gambetta&quot;, one linking , the Church of Saint-Acheul, Cagnard bridge, &quot;Rue de Noyon&quot; and &quot;Rue Jules-Barni&quot;; the other from the Church of Saint-Pierre at the racecourse, by the streets of Saint-Leu, Frédéric-Petit and Colbert. Electrified in 1899, the network grew to seven lines totaling in 1906. From 1932, Longueau was linked to Amiens by a bus service. German bombing in 1940 destroyed most of the city center and hit the Jules-Ferry Road tram depot, totally destroying the tram fleet. Only the Longueau bus survived. A few old Parisian buses were also used in an extremely reduced service. These buses as well as the surviving bus were then converted to city gas and equipped with tanks on the roof covered by a huge white dome. This service continued until approximately 1946. There were only two urban lines: An east–west line (Saint-Acheul – Montieres) and a northeast–southwest line (Beauville – road to Rouen). It was decided after the war to serve the city by a trolleybus with one route to Longueau. This was only in part realized, serving Saint-Acheul, Rouen, La Madeleine and Saint-Pierre. In 1964, trolleybuses were abandoned and the bus became ubiquitous in Amiens transportation.

The current consists of a bus network managed by the Ametis , whose network covers Amiens Métropole, the agglomeration of Amiens. The establishment of dedicated bus lanes began in 2006. Former Mayor Gilles de Robien had envisioned the , but the choice of dedicated bus lanes had been preferred for reasons of cost and patronage. His successor, Mayor , had been considering the development of a in the metropolitan area. As a result of numerous studies and conferences, elected representatives voted for the creation of a tram at the municipal Council of 15 November 2012. The project had been endorsed by the Communauté d&#x27;agglomération Amiens Métropole on 18 December 2012 and the commissioning of a first north–south tram route was scheduled for 2018/2019. Following the , which were a defeat for most municipal and community carriers of the project, the new mayor of Amiens Brigitte Fouré, and by extension the new president of Amiens Métropole Alain Gest, decided to suspend the project at least during the time of their respective mandates, thus applying a campaign promise (the tram was at the heart of debate) and despite a project announcement of trams on tyres (of TVR type). Improvement of public transit would then be only by that of the bus network. Indeed, in December of the same year, the Community Council approved funding for a study (the sixth in 20 years) relating to the establishment of a rapid transit bus network (BHNS), which should enter into service in March 2019, and whose vehicles could be electric.

====Cycle networks====
Amiens has developed two bike services: Buscyclette and .
* Buscyclette is a service of rental bikes on demand, created in May 1999. In 2014, nearly 2,400 &quot;green bikes&quot; are available for rent, essentially city bikes but also electric bikes (VAE), folding bicycles and specific bikes (such as kids bikes, child trailers, mountain bikes, cargo bikes, tandems). The rental period varies from half a day to one year.
* Velam is a bike sharing system created on 16 February 2008, an adaptation of the system managed by JCDecaux, similar to Vélo&#x27;v in Lyon and Vélib&#x27; in Paris. Velam offers 313 bikes distributed every 300 to 400 metres in the center of Amiens and 26 stations.

In 2012, Amiens Métropole had of routes for cyclists. Despite the development of a bicycle plan in 1997 which was planning the development of of equipped cycleways, the network of the territory in terms of paths is still incomplete.

The blueprint of the bicycle facilities of the agglomeration (SDAC) provides, over a period of 10 years (2014–2024), for of cycle routes and equips 490 sites for the parking of bikes. This plan also includes the deployment of parking facilities over the entire territory of the city, close to the facilities frequented by bikers, as well as at traffic lights or even the maintenance of existing facilities.

====Railways====
There are three railway stations:
* Two stations on the Paris-Boulogne and Amiens – Rouen lines:
*The Amiens station, main station, known as &quot;Gare du Nord&quot;, in memory of the Compagnie du Nord who created it. Every day, 15,000 travelers use its seven lines.
*The station of Saint-Roch

Connections from these two stations include to Lille via Arras and Douai, to Boulogne via Abbeville, to Paris-Nord via Creil or Compiègne, to Reims via Tergnier, and to Rouen.
* A station located on the Paris – Lille line in Longueau serving the south of Amiens and the communes of Longueau, Cagny, and Boves
*Longueau station, a passenger station of the historic railway hub in Longueau. Every day, 2,500 travellers use its two lines.
* , station assigned to the freight traffic, it serves only the industrial zone of Amiens. This station is located on the former railway line of Doullens.

Many regional and extra regional links (Normandie, Grand Est and Île-de-France) pass through Amiens, especially by TER Hauts-de-France.

A station located from Amiens, the Haute-Picardie TGV station, allows access to the TGV network. It is served by buses from Amiens. Its isolated character earned it the name of &quot;gare des betteraves&quot;, or &quot;gare betteraves&quot;, at the time of its construction.

====Air transport====
In addition to Amiens – Glisy Aerodrome, bordering the town&#x27;s eastern edge from the center, there are several airports nearby.
* Albert – Picardie Airport is located 20 minutes northeast of the city.
* Beauvais-Tillé Airport, the ninth largest French airport by usage, located 45 minutes by car south of the city, and served by a bus service from Amiens.
* Lille Airport, reachable by train or by road using the A29 and A1.
* Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, reachable by train or by road using the A29 and A1, or A16 and N104. The creation of a railway between Creil and Roissy will put Amiens 55 minutes from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport by 2020.

====Waterways====
The Somme canal runs through the town to the English Channel. This canal is linked to the Canal du Nord (Paris to Lille metropolitan area).

==Urbanism==

===Urban morphology===

Amiens comprises a number of neighborhoods () with their own characteristics, including Saint-Leu, St-Maurice, Henriville, and Saint-Acheul.

====Saint-Leu neighborhood====
St-Leu forms part of Amiens, north of the city center. It has many older wooden and brick houses and several canals. At the foot of the cathedral, traversed by canals, this picturesque area was largely rehabilitated during the 1990s. It extends to the Somme canal, located more to the north, at the foot of the Coteau Saint-Pierre on which the fortress of Jean Errard, called &quot;Citadelle&quot;, was built. Historically, it was the poor neighborhood of the city, where butchers, tanners and dyers gathered.

Amiens University&#x27;s Faculty of Sciences, present since the 1960s, has been renovated and expanded on occasion. The Faculty of Law and Economics has also been transferred since the mid-1990s from the campus (offset to the south of the city) to its new location at the foot of the cathedral. The open-air parking it replaces was a &quot;gap&quot; in the landscape dating from World War II. Nonetheless, it allowed an unobstructed view of the cathedral. Most of the buildings have been renovated and transformed into housing much of which is for students.

The area became the heart of the Amiens people&#x27;s evenings, with many establishments (bars, restaurants, etc.) on &quot;Place du Don&quot; and &quot;Quai Bélu&quot;.

The church is found at &quot;Rue Saint-Leu&quot;, located just between the Faculty of Science and Law-Economy (UPJV).

Two theatres were established in the neighborhood, that of the Chés Cabotans (puppet shows in the Picard language) and the &quot;Maison du Théâtre&quot; at the foot of the Saint-Leu Church. There is also &quot;La Lune des Pirates&quot;, a concert hall.

====Saint-Maurice neighborhood====
Located to the west of the Citadelle, and east of the , this very old working-class neighborhood of Amiens acted as an industrial center in the 18th century. It is currently undergoing significant housing renovation and development.

Bordered by the Canal de la Somme, it offers a stopover for leisure boats, which must go through a lock.

The walls of the city&#x27;s former dye factory are now those of the (ESAD) as well as those of the Faculty of Arts. The École supérieure d&#x27;ingénieurs en électronique et électrotechnique (ESIEE) is in the same neighborhood. As the Citadelle, it will be renovated by the architect Renzo Piano to accommodate the university departments (UFR) of: letters, history and geography, languages, the (ESPE), the House of Languages, the House of Research and the University Library in 2015.

The , known as the &quot;Jardin du Roy&quot; within the city, is also located in this neighborhood.

====Henriville neighborhood====
The Henriville neighborhood was mostly built during the 19th century after the demolition of the city wall. It lies at the south of the town center. It has numerous bourgeois houses and townhouses, predominantly in brick, blending architectural styles of the period, including neoclassical, troubadour and neo-Gothic. There are also private mansions, such as the Acloque mansion and the house of Jules Verne.

====Saint-Acheul neighborhood====
The Saint-Acheul neighborhood() existed before Amiens&#x27; inception, as people have lived there since prehistoric times. This is where archaeological excavations in the nineteenth century discovered prehistoric tool sets typical of the &quot;Acheulean&quot; prehistorical era, named after this neighborhood (also spelled Acheulian, pronounced ). Civilians can freely visit the archaeological garden there.

Not to be confused with the commune of Saint-Acheul situated to the north, the Saint-Acheul neighborhood is the site of a military cemetery from the First World War (1914–1918).

It also contains the Church of Saint-Acheul, the Jesuit former Saint-Acheul College and the former normal school of teachers which became the Lycée Robert-de-Luzarches. A number of famous people are buried in the former Saint-Acheul cemetery such as the creator of &quot;Bécassine&quot; J.P. Pinchon, and many resistance fighters. Part of the neighborhood includes a so-called &quot;English neighborhood,&quot; with typical English style houses. At the feet of this area lie the &quot;hortillonnages&quot;, a marshy area criss-crossed by canals.

====Other neighborhoods====
Amiens, like other big cities, has its large HLM high-rise tower blocks:
* North of the city the neighborhoods &quot;du Pigeonnier&quot;, which is famous for its weekend market, &quot;Messenger&quot;, &quot;Mozart&quot;, &quot;Fafet-Brossolette-la Cité&quot;, &quot;Balzac&quot;, and &quot;Léo Lagrange-Schweitzer&quot;;
* Southeast of the city: &quot;Victorine-Autier&quot;, &quot;Philéas Lebesgue&quot;, &quot;Condorcet&quot;, &quot;Pierre-Rollin&quot;.
* West: &quot;Etouvie&quot; and &quot;Montières&quot; (an ecodistrict is provided in this industrial space, where there are 19th century in brick buildings).
* East: &quot;Saint-Acheul-la-Cité&quot; and the &quot;Clos de l&#x27;Avre&quot;.

These areas experience a lot of social troubles and have regularly been the place for riots. The northern neighborhoods were the scene of violent events in 1994, 1999 and 2000 (clashes between several districts of the city and between the neighbourhoods of Amiens and the districts of Creil), in 2006 and 2008 (in the wake of incidents in the Paris suburbs) and more recently in August 2012 following a conflict between youth and the police. The cost of the latest vandalism to occur in the north of Amiens would amount, according to , to between four and six million euros. These extremely violent riots caused sixteen police officers to be injured.

An extensive programme of redevelopment of these neighborhoods began recently, with demolition of HLM tower blocks and new infrastructure having been built, especially for schools. In 2009, the public transport network of the Amiens agglomeration was significantly modified.

===Housing===
In 2017, the total number of dwellings in the municipality was 73,541, while it was 63,178 in 1999.

Among this housing, 88.7% were primary residences, 2.1% of secondary residences and 9.2% vacant housing. These dwellings were 35.6% of houses and 63.4% of apartments.

The proportion of principal residences, which were the properties of occupants, was 31.9%, down from 2007 (34.4%). The share of empty rented HLM homes (social housing) was up: 29.8% against 29.4% in 2007, their number increased from 18,268 to 19,431. However, this percentage remains much greater than the rate of 20% required by the (SRU) for cities and agglomerations of more than 50,000 inhabitants.

The identity of the city is strongly marked by the specificity of its housing stock, consisting in a large proportion of detached houses, semi-detached, single or bourgeois: the &quot;amiénoises&quot;. These traditional houses in the suburbs, in brick, were intrinsically linked to the expansion of the city during and after the Industrial Revolution.

The &quot;amiénoise simple&quot; includes a window on the ground floor and floors for attic and basement. It is built on a plot of a few metres wide but is very deep, and includes a garden, forming hearts with green islets and sparse areas. The &quot;amiénoise double&quot; has two windows at each level. The &quot;grandes amiénoises&quot; and townhouses rise to at least two floors with large rooms. They can have a gate opening onto a paved courtyard.

The official buildings or mansions regularly use brick façades on a sandstone base, decorated by stone window and door frames.

The Chanoines neighborhood has stone façades exclusively.

In historic areas such as the neighborhood, façades widely use wood, half-timbered or siding, and wattle and daub.

===Development projects===
* Amiens 2030: Amiens, in the context of the Communauté d&#x27;agglomération Amiens Métropole, is developing a master development plan called Amiens 2030. This strategic outreach project is centered around the priority issues of economic, social and cultural development of the agglomeration. The whole process of reflection will determine the development of the metropolis by 2030.
* : This flagship project for the agglomeration involves the amalgamation of units of training and research from the University of Picardie in letters, languages, history, geography, philosophy, sociology, psychology and the (ESPE) on the site of La Citadelle. It is to be set on on the outskirts of downtown. This university construction program is intended to strengthen regional competitiveness and the development of higher education and research. The project, entrusted to the Italian architect Renzo Piano, will be accessible to all inhabitants.
* ZAC Gare-la-Vallée: The project intends to strengthen Amiens in its role as the regional capital and allow the creation of a genuine business district in the heart of the city. With a budget of €157 million, the project combines tertiary activities, shops and a habitat walk from the station and the inner city. The first buildings were inaugurated in 2008. The second phase of development extended from 2012 to 2017. Under the control of the Chief Architect, Paul Chemetov, the project will accommodate 2,000 homes, of offices and two urban parks creating a visible link between downtown, the Somme and the &quot;hortillonnages&quot;.
* ZAC Intercampus: This new housing and services project in the south of the city is projected to host 1,900 dwellings by 2030. A first tranche of 850 dwellings must be delivered in 2015. Located in the immediate vicinity of the campus and the CHU d&#x27;Amiens, it will be served by a future TCSP. The ecodistrict of is projected to provide green spaces and gardens, with 60% of its total area to not be built-up. It will include of gardens.
* ZAC Paul Claudel: This new housing and services project of is located at the southern entrance to the city. Intended as a small neighborhood, it must accommodate 1,400 units and of commercial space. Designed in 4 slices, together with its inhabitants, it entered its final phase of development in 2013.
* ZAC Renancourt: This new project must ensure the development of the city to the west. Located between the Grâce Valley, the Selle Valley, the Renancourt neighborhood and its suburb, this planning area is a natural viewpoint over the city. It is also adjacent to emblematic facilities of the city: The Zenith of Amiens, the Stade de la Licorne and the . By 2018, this residential area is projected to accommodate 1,400 houses, a hotel, facilities and shops.
* Bus rapid transit (BRT): A project of three BRT lines is under consideration for commissioning in 2019, at the end of two years of work. Estimated at €85 million excluding taxes, and spanning , the project would include the construction of a new bus depot and four park and ride stops. This project follows the cancellation of a tram project, which was endorsed by the municipal team in place between 2008 and 2014.

==Toponymy==
The toponym is derived from the name of the local Gallic people, the Ambiani, which in the 4th century, replaced the old name of the town (the bridge on the Samara – Somme). Amiens then became the episcopal headquarters. In Picard, Amiens is called &quot;Anmyen&quot;.

==Population and society==

===Demography===
The inhabitants of Amiens are called the &quot;Amiénois&quot; and their blason populaire is &quot;Chés maqueux d&#x27;gueugues&quot; (the eaters of nuts).

The population of Amiens has risen sharply since the mid-19th century: Its population doubled between 1850 and 1960, from 50,000 to 100,000 inhabitants, i.e. a gain of 50,000 people over this period of 110 years, and gaining about 30,000 others since (over 50 years only this time).

====Demographic evolution====
In 2017, the commune had 134,057 inhabitants.
====Age structure====
Amiens is distinguished by the youthfulness of its population. In 2017, more than 25% of the population of the city was less than 20 years old. The rate of people of an age over 60 years (19.3%) is also lower than the national rate (25.5%) and the departmental rate (25.4%). Like national and departmental allocations, the female population of the municipality is greater in number to the male population, with a rate of 52.5%, whereas the national rate is 51.6%.

{{pull quote|Amiens Cathedral deserves the name given by M. Viollet-le-Duc, &#x27;the Parthenon of Gothic architecture&#x27;.|author =John Ruskin|source=The Bible of Amiens}}

The city is famous for its Notre-Dame Cathedral, masterpiece of Gothic art and one of the largest cathedrals in the world by its interior volume ({{convert|200000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}). The largest religious and medieval building of France, its interior could twice hold Notre-Dame de Paris.

The cathedral measures {{convert|145|m|ft}} long and its spire rises {{convert|112|m|ft}} high. The vaults of the central nave, finished in 1247, are {{convert|42.3|m|ft}}, close to the maximum limit for this architecture.

Dating back to the 13th century, its construction is due to the wealth of the city in the Middle Ages and to the fire of the Romanesque cathedral which stood previously. Three architects, including Robert of Luzarches succeeded to complete the construction.

Amiens Cathedral is notable for the coherence of its plan, the beauty of its three-tier interior elevation, the particularly fine display of sculptures on the principal façade and in the south transept, and inlays of its floor. It is also described by John Ruskin as &quot;Gothic, clear of Roman tradition and of Arabian taint, Gothic pure, authoritative, unsurpassable, and unaccusable.&quot;

Regarded as the archetype of the classic Gothic style, the cathedral also presents some elements of the radiant Gothic style and flamboyant Gothic. The speed of construction, barely 70 years for the shell (1220 to 1269), explains this remarkable homogeneity of style. Its façade is decorated with more than 3,000 statues, gargoyles and chimeras.

Registered since 1981 as a World Heritage Site of UNESCO, it is a &quot;masterpiece of world heritage&quot;. For a second time in 1998, it is a monumental step on the Camino de Santiago. Despite the two World Wars of the 20th century, which severely affected the city, it managed to stay intact.

A show of the reproduction of the original polychromy of façades, discovered as a result of recent laser cleaning, is given annually for free in December and during the summer period. The show is a projection on the façade of slides in color.

The {{interlanguage link|Zodiaque de la cathédrale d&#x27;Amiens|fr|3=Zodiaque de la cathédrale d&#x27;Amiens|lt=zodiac}} is a set of reliefs on the foundations of the western façade formed series of quatrefoil medallions, carved in a representative agrarian calendar and the signs of the zodiac.

The statue of the {{interlanguage link|L&#x27;Ange pleureur|fr|3=L&#x27;Ange pleureur|lt=weeping Angel}} that is on a tomb carved by {{interlanguage link|Nicolas Blasset|fr}}, and the reliefs evoking Saint-Firmin and St. John the Baptist, are some of the well-known works of the cathedral.

At ground level lies the intact {{interlanguage link|Labyrinthe de la cathédrale d&#x27;Amiens|fr|3=Labyrinthe de la cathédrale d&#x27;Amiens|lt=labyrinth}} of {{convert|234|m|ft}} long.

On the north side of the cathedral is the former {{interlanguage link|Palais de l&#x27;évêché d&#x27;Amiens|fr|3=Palais de l&#x27;évêché d&#x27;Amiens|lt=Palace of the Bishop of Amiens}}, occupied by the {{interlanguage link|École supérieure de commerce d&#x27;Amiens|fr|3=École supérieure de commerce d&#x27;Amiens|lt=École supérieure de commerce}} in Amiens.

====Belfry====

The origin of the {{interlanguage link|Belfry of Amiens|fr|3=Beffroi d&#x27;Amiens}} dates back to the establishment of the commune of Amiens by Louis VI. It is mentioned for the first time in an arbitral award issued by the chapter of Amiens in 1244.

Symbolizing the independence of the commune, it was formerly used for meetings of the notables of the city and then as archive rooms, weapons store and prison. A spotter nearby monitored arrivals and warned the population of the external dangers. During the Middle Ages, the building was repeatedly engulfed by fire.

The belfry is composed of a base in white cut stone, built in the 15th century between 1406 and 1410, a stone superstructure bell tower built from 1749 with Baroque volutes at its base, and a dome covered with slate and then the renowned arrow weather vane. At the time, a huge 11-ton bell was installed inside, it was later destroyed along with the dome, whose copper component melted, in the bombardment and fire of the city on 19 May 1940. Abandoned and devoid of a roof since World War II, the monument was fully restored between February 1989 and July 1990.

Located on the &quot;Place au Fil&quot;, the old central square of the city before the arrival of the railway and the rise of the &quot;Rue des Trois Calloux&quot;, the belfry is adjacent to &quot;Les Halles&quot; and the back of the &quot;Hôtel de Ville&quot; (city hall). At a height of {{convert|52|m|ft}}, it rings every hour of the day.

Since July 2005, the belfry of Amiens is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as part of a set of 56 Belfries of Belgium and France which were inscribed because of their architecture and their importance in the rise of municipal power in Northern France and Belgium. The belfry is also recorded in the inventory of Historic Monuments.

====Cirque Jules-Verne====
In 1845, the traditional fair of Saint-Jean, formerly held at &quot;Place René Goblet&quot;, was transferred to &quot;Place Longueville&quot;. It is a wide esplanade that took the place of the Longueville bastion, after the demolition of the city walls in the early 19th century. Each year, a temporary circus is established for this occasion.

In 1865, a circus company emerged to claim a permanent circus, which would be built in wood by the Schytte contractor in 1874. However, expensive maintenance prompted the municipality to consider the construction of a new building. The decision was made in 1886 under the leadership of Mayor Frédéric Petit and the work began.

The Chief Architect of the Somme, {{interlanguage link|Émile Ricquier|fr}}, a disciple of Gustave Eiffel, was responsible for its construction. It was inspired by the Cirque d&#x27;hiver of Paris but with a cast metal frame, supplemented by brick from the local countryside. The architect of civil buildings, Charles Garnier, claimed that the frames should be hidden with a plaster imitating stone. The &quot;moderninst&quot; design of Ricquier, who chose to display the structure, and to favor local material such as brick, is visible at the rear of the monument.

With its 16-sided polygonal shape and a diameter of {{convert|44|m|ft}}, it includes lodges and stalls in its enclosure. As a completely modern project, it hosted two steam engines, dedicated to fully electric lights and central heating. Since its construction, it was also the first circus which included a buffet and a refreshment bar. The cost of the construction of the building finally reached double the forecast. In 1888, the new city councilor responsible for festivals and celebrations, Jules Verne, was responsible for monitoring the work, and it was he who opened it on Sunday 23 June 1889, for the opening of the fair and the centenary of the French Revolution:

{{pull quote|The new circus is a work of art that your municipal administration wanted to build with all of the enhancements of modern industry. It is the very best, undoubtedly, it is also the most comprehensive, with its facilities and equipment, to have been built in France and abroad.|author =Jules Verne}}

The roof was damaged by a shell in 1916. The circus was the setting for Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;The Clowns&quot; (1971), and the film by Jean-Jacques Beineix, &quot;Roselyne et les lions&quot; (1989), with Isabelle Pasco as lead actress. The largest of the circuses of the province with its 3,000-seats, the building has acquired a multidisciplinary use for decades of performances of theatre, dance, concerts, galas, sports and public meetings.

Renovated in 2003, it now bears the name of {{interlanguage link|Cirque Jules-Verne|fr}}. After hosting the performances of {{interlanguage link|Cirque Rancy|fr}}, it hosts resident {{interlanguage link|Cirque Arlette Gruss|fr}}.

Since 1 January 2011, the circus has been labelled &quot;national hub circus and street arts&quot;, managed by an {{interlanguage link|Établissement public de coopération culturelle|fr|3=Établissement public de coopération culturelle|lt=EPCC}}. It is one of seven in France and is still in use today.

====The house of Jules-Verne====
In 1882, Jules Verne and his wife, Honorine, rented {{interlanguage link|Maison de Jules Verne|fr|lt=the house}} at the corner of &quot;Rue Charles-Dubois&quot; and &quot;Boulevard Longueville&quot; until 1900. Acquired in 1980 by the city, the house is labeled Maisons des Illustres by the Ministry of Culture. Restored in 2006, thanks to the work of the {{interlanguage link|Centre international Jules-Verne|fr}}, this 19th-century mansion, registered as a national heritage site, traces through the exhibition of more than 700 objects, the personality, the sources of inspiration and memories of Jules Verne.

====Tour Perret====
{{main|Tour Perret (Amiens)}}
Opposite the Gare d&#x27;Amiens, is located the Tour Perret (from the name of its architect Auguste Perret). Over {{convert|100|m|ft}} high, it was one of the first skyscrapers built in Europe, and the highest for a long time.

====The Church of Saint-Leu====
The {{interlanguage link|Église Saint-Leu d&#x27;Amiens|fr}} was built at the end of the 15th century, on the model of the hall-churches. It is dedicated, as its district, to Saint Leu, referring to the 7th century bishop who was exiled to the Vimeu. It has three naves. A flamboyant portal adorns the base of the steeple. The latter, struck by lightning, had to be rebuilt at the beginning of the 16th century. The ends of beams are carved. Stone and wood statues date from the 17th century. The choir houses the glory of the Duthoit brothers.

Amiens is also known for the {{interlanguage link|hortillonnages|fr|3=Hortillonnages d&#x27;Amiens}}, gardens on small islands in over {{convert|300|ha|acre}} of marshland between the River Somme and River Avre, surrounded by a grid network of human-made canals (locally known as &quot;rieux&quot;). They are also known as the &quot;floating gardens of Amiens&quot;. The &quot;hortillonnages&quot; are sometimes called &quot;Little Venice of the North&quot;, because of the canals.

&quot;Hortillon&quot; means market garden in Picard, and derives from the Latin &quot;hortillus&quot;, small garden. It is navigated in flat bottom boats, formerly called &quot;barque à cornet&quot; [Cornet boat], due to the very raised front, which allows the boats to easily dock on the fragile shores of the cultivated fields. It is the upstream port, located at the foot of the cathedral, where a weekly market is held on the water, although the arrival the growers by boat can only be accomplished once a year, in summer.

====Amiens Metropolitan Zoo====
Prior to its opening in May 1952, the {{interlanguage link|Zoo d&#x27;Amiens|fr|3=Zoo d&#x27;Amiens|lt=Amiens Zoo}} is a green space bordering the basin of the {{interlanguage link|Parc de la Hotoie|fr|3=Parc de la Hotoie|lt=Park of the Hotoie}}.

===Cultural heritage===

====Museums====

* The Musée de Picardie is a key site in the history of the National Museum, since it is the first building to have been built in France to serve as a museum. Built under the Second Empire on the model of the new Louvre of Napoleon III, it opened its doors to the public in 1867 after the visit of the emperor. Considered the French model of a 19th-century museum, it was nicknamed the &quot;Little Louvre of the Province&quot;. It hosted very early rich collections which are now divided into four departments: Archaeology in the basement, the Medieval art on the ground floor, fine arts on the ground floor and the first floor, and modern and contemporary art on the first floor. Rooms are also devoted to temporary exhibitions. The department of fine arts brings together paintings by Van Dyck, Jordaens, Ruysdael, El Greco, Ribera, Tiepolo, Guardi, Fragonard, Chardin, Boucher, Quentin de La Tour, Vouet, Corot and Courbet. The modern and contemporary collection is represented by Picasso, Picabia, Balthus, Dubuffet, Hélion, Bacon, Miró and Manessier. Access to the picture galleries of the first floor is by a mounumental staircase in a setting dedicated to the famous wall compositions of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes.
* The Hotel de Berny Museum is a regional museum of local art and history. This building, typical of the Louis XIII architecture, was built in 1634 as a mansion of the treasurers of France. Property of Gérard de Berny, Senator of the Somme in the first half of the 20th century, has restored the façades and settled its collections. Located a few metres from the cathedral, this Museum of France retains an exceptional collection of woodwork, furniture and objets d&#x27;art (tapestries, ceramics, ironworks) and memories (objects and arrays) of Amiens personalities: Jules Verne, Choderlos de Laclos, Édouard Branly, Jean-Baptiste Gresset, Vincent Voiture, Joseph Pinchon, Maréchal Leclerc. The museum is currently undergoing a complete renovation of its buildings and an overhaul of the installation of its museum collections.
* The {{interlanguage link|House of Jules Verne|fr|3=Maison de Jules Verne}}, labeled Maisons des Illustres, is the home of the most translated writer in the world after Agatha Christie: Jules Verne. He lived here from 1882 to 1900 with his wife Honorine, and wrote part of his work in this mansion of the 19th century. To visit is to enter into the intimate and creative universe of the author. The building largely retains its original decor and opens almost all of its rooms, from the ground floor to the attic. The permanent collections are presented on two floors, in the attic, the tower and the belvedere of the house: Approximately 700 collected objects evoke the personality, sources of inspiration and memories of Jules Verne. Costumed tours, performances, parties and literary encounters of thematic conferences are also regularly organised.
* The Gallery of stained glass is located in the workshop of master glassmaker Claude Barre, in a 16th-century house near to the cathedral.

* The Fonds régional d&#x27;art contemporain of Picardie (FRAC Picardie), created in 1983, aims to promote contemporary art, in particular through dissemination actions. As early as 1985, FRAC Picardie had specialised its action in the field of the design and its contemporary dimensions. It is also interested in new media, on and off paper, since artists are now working through the video medium. This has allowed it to acquire a good reputation in France and abroad. In 30 years, the FRAC has brought together a unique collection of a thousand drawings which include major names of contemporary art, such as Basquiat, Dubuffet, Oppenheim, Twombly, Matta, and Manessier. In 2001, discussions are undertaken to construct a new building to accommodate the fonds and its collections.

===Cultural events and festivals===

===Music===

Even if it rarely achieves national notoriety (with the notable exceptions of Les Fatals Picards, {{interlanguage link|The Rabeats|fr}}, Olympe, Albin de la Simone, Disiz and Rokia Traoré), the Amiens music scene is active and developed. In this dynamic, the {{interlanguage link|Nouvelle scène rock française|fr|3=Nouvelle scène rock française|lt=New French Rock}} scene holds a central place and is organised around a collective, &quot;Amiens Burning&quot;, which is responsible for networking the breeding ground for the local rock scene, to accompany its projects, and organize concerts.

Since their creation, {{interlanguage link|La Lune des Pirates|fr}} and Cité Carter also provide support to the local scene. For example, the Cité Carter produces a compilation each year, with local groups.

The city has the {{interlanguage link|Conservatoire à rayonnement régional d&#x27;Amiens|fr}}, seat of strong musical activity (framed by 70 teachers, an administrative and technical team with an additional 20 people).

===Literature===
Amiens saw rise, over the centuries, to major writers. In the first half of the 17th century, Vincent Voiture, poet and letter writer, was the darling of the Précieuses for the fluidity of his style. In 1634, he was member of the 1st Académie française. In 1678, Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange, nicknamed &quot;the French Varro&quot;, published his &quot;Glossarium&quot; in 3 volumes. This glossary of medieval Latin is still authoritative today. In 1750, Jean Baptiste Gresset, a playwright and poet who was celebrated in his time and was a member of the Académie française, founded the {{interlanguage link|Académie des sciences, des lettres et des arts d&#x27;Amiens|fr|3=Académie des sciences, des lettres et des arts d&#x27;Amiens|lt=Academy of Amiens}} which is still active today. He was named perpetual president.

In 1782, the Amiens native Choderlos de Laclos published &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot; where he staged a depraved nobility. Considered one of the masterpieces of 18th-century literature, the book has toured the world and is known as an Oscar-winning film adaptation.

{{pull quote|Here I am quite citizen of Amiens. It seems to me that I was born. I live very happy, although uncomfortable to work. Amiens is a wise city, even-tempered, and the company is friendly and literate. It is near Paris, close enough to have the highlights without unbearable noise and bustle.|author =Jules Verne}}

In the 19th century, there was a brilliant literary life around the {{interlanguage link|Académie des sciences, des lettres et des arts d&#x27;Amiens|fr}} with historian Albéric de Calonne and the Yvert family. However, the great name of Amiens literary life is Jules Verne. He animated all intellectual activity, giving balls and parties, while his wife held a famous salon. He often attended the library of the industrial society, which subscribed to numerous scientific journals. A member of the Academy of Sciences, Letters and Arts of Amiens from 8 March 1872, he was elected Director in 1875, and in 1881 and, on this occasion, he delivered several speeches of welcome, especially for one of his friends, Amiens cartoonist {{interlanguage link|Gédéon Baril|fr}}, who signed illustrations of {{interlanguage link|Dix heures en chasse|fr}} with Hetzel. Engaged in local life, he was Councillor of Amiens from 1888 to 1904. He was closely interested in the affairs of the city, wrote many reports on the theatre and brought its support to the construction of the {{interlanguage link|Cirque Jules-Verne|fr|3=Cirque Jules-Verne|lt=municipal circus}}.

Amiens does appear explicitly in his novels but there are however characteristic elements of the city such as the cathedral and the river. This is the case, for example, for the imaginary city of Ragz in &quot;Le secret de Wilhem Storitz&quot;. In the novel &quot;Une fantaisie du docteur Ox&quot;, the inhabitants of the fictional town of Virgamen, the Virgamenois, refer directly to the Amiénois and their prudent nature.

In 1875, he delivered before the Academy of Sciences, Letters and Arts of Amiens a speech entitled &quot;An ideal city: Amiens in the year 2000&quot; where he portrays himself wandering in a forward-thinking city of Amiens. Since then, the city has built a tourist route from this text.

He died in Amiens in 1905, and he deeply marked the town&#x27;s footprint, so that today many places, monuments and events bear his name. He rests at {{interlanguage link|Cimetière de La Madeleine (Amiens)|fr|3=Cimetière de La Madeleine (Amiens)|lt=La Madeleine cemetery}} where one can read on his tomb: &quot;Vers l&#x27;immortalité et l&#x27;éternelle jeunesse.&quot; [Towards immortality and eternal youth].

{{pull quote|Such as it is with his distinctive smile, how much I love the Golden Virgin, with her smile of heavenly hostess; how much I love its home at the door of the Cathedral in its adornment exquisite and simple of hawthorns.|author =Marcel Proust (about the portal of the Virgin Golden of the Cathedral of Amiens)}}

In 1885, Englishman John Ruskin published the Bible of Amiens, which was translated into French, extensively annotated and prefaced, in 1904, by Marcel Proust. This book dedicated to Notre-Dame d&#x27;Amiens was the opportunity for Proust to recall his admiration for the English author and the Cathedral of Amiens.

{{pull quote|I would like to give the reader the desire and the means to spend a day at Amiens in a sort of Ruskinesque pilgrimage. It was not worth starting by asking him to go to Florence or Venice, when Ruskin wrote a whole book on Amiens.|author =Marcel Proust}}

In the second half of the 19th century, {{interlanguage link|Jules Barni|fr}}, {{interlanguage link|List of députés of the Somme|fr|3=Liste des députés de la Somme|lt=Member of Parliament for the Somme}}, Associate Professor of philosophy and brilliant scholar translated Kant&#x27;s work in French and thus enabled its dissemination in France.

A native of Amiens, Paul Bourget published &quot;Le Disciple&quot; in 1889, a novel today considered his major work. He was elected, 5 years later, to the Académie française.

Born in Sainte-Anne district in 1885, Roland Dorgelès published {{interlanguage link|Les Croix de bois|fr|3=Les Croix de bois|lt=&quot;Les Croix de bois&quot;}} in 1919. A masterpiece written from his notes taken at the Front, the novel won the Prix Femina the same year. Though capable of obtaining the Prix Goncourt, it was beaten by {{interlanguage link|À l&#x27;ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs|fr}} by Marcel Proust, 6 votes against 4. A member of the Académie Goncourt in 1929, he was elected president in 1954 until his death in 1973.

In 1926, the Amiens native Henri Deberly, won the Prix Goncourt with {{interlanguage link|Le Supplice de Phèdre|fr}}, a novel inspired by his home city.

===Comics===
Amiens is a stronghold of comics in France. A whole generation of designers and Amiens writers make the city an important creative center of the 9th art. The main actors in this generation, include {{interlanguage link|Régis Hautière|fr}}, {{interlanguage link|Norédine Allam|fr}} who notably led the recolouring of the 33 Asterix albums in the framework of the project &quot;The great collection&quot; and also {{interlanguage link|Antoine Dodé|fr}}, {{interlanguage link|David François (comic artist)|fr|3=David François (dessinateur)|lt=David François}}, Fraco, {{interlanguage link|Hardoc|fr}}, Greg Blondin, and Nicolas Hitori De.

The city was also the birthplace or home of big names in the comic strip universe, such as the Amiens native Joseph Pinchon, creator of the character of &quot;Bécassine&quot;; Paul Gillon, winner of the Grand Prix de la ville d&#x27;Angoulême and also {{interlanguage link|Philippe Thirault|fr}}.

Actor of this dynamic around the {{abbr|BD|Bande dessinée (comic strip)}}, the association &quot;On a marché sur la bulle&quot; [Explorers on the bubble] organises the {{interlanguage link|Rendez-vous de la bande dessinée d&#x27;Amiens|fr}}, one of the greatest French comic book festivals. Active throughout the territory, the structure also manages a resource center and has an editorial department with the {{interlanguage link|Éditions de la Gouttière|fr}}.

===Regional culture===
{{Main|Picard language}}
* &quot;Chés Cabotans d&#x27;Anmien&quot; or the &quot;Cabotins of Amiens&quot; is a small Picardy traditional puppet theatre founded in 1933. Lafleur, the hero, was created around 1811 at {{interlanguage link|Saint-Leu (Amiens)|fr|3=Saint-Leu (Amiens)|lt=Saint-Leu}}. He talks in Picard, exclusively. Traditionally a lackey costume (wearing a red velvet tricorne hat) dressed, Lafleur is cheerful, dynamic, independent and resourceful; its motto is: &quot;bin mier, bin boere, pis did rin foere!&quot; (Drink well, eat well and then do nothing).
* The Picard language is recognised regional language. It is spoken in France in the Picardy and Nord-Pas-de-Calais regions, and in Belgium in the Province of Hainaut. Various associations work for the promotion and development of Picardy culture expressed in theatre, song, in spoken tales but also {{interlanguage link|Literature in Picard|fr|3=Littérature en picard|lt=in writing}}, notably in novels, journals, and poetry. Since 1993, the Regional Council of Picardy has developed within the &quot;Office Culturel Régional de Picardie&quot; a cultural policy for the language and the Picardy culture. &quot;The Agency for Picard&quot;, created in 2008, is headquartered in Amiens. Picard is taught at the University of Amiens.
* The &quot;blasons populaires&quot; are surnames or the nicknames given to the inhabitants of cities and the Picardy villages. These &quot;surpitchets&quot; sometimes come from the history of the city, sometimes a verbal game, sometimes through a mockery of people. The nickname of the inhabitants of Amiens is: &quot;Chés Maqueus d&#x27;gueugues d&#x27;Anmien&quot; [Amiens nut eaters] in reference to an episode of the Spanish invasion. On 11 March 1597, the Spanish armies developed a ploy to seize the city: The soldiers of Hernán Tello de Portocarrero, Governor of Doullens, disguised as peasants, came to the gates of the walls with nuts. The starving citizens of Amiens opened the doors and the Spaniards took the city.

====Gastronomic specialities====

<text>This is a timeline of Solar System exploration ordering events in the exploration of the Solar System by date of spacecraft launch.
It includes:

*All spacecraft that have left Earth orbit for the purposes of Solar System exploration (or were launched with that intention but failed), including lunar probes.
*A small number of pioneering or notable Earth-orbiting craft.

It does &quot;not&quot; include:

*Centuries of terrestrial telescopic observation. 
*The great majority of Earth-orbiting satellites.
*Space probes leaving Earth orbit that are not concerned with Solar System exploration (such as space telescopes targeted at distant galaxies, cosmic background radiation observatories, and so on).
*Probes that failed at launch.

The dates listed are launch dates, but the achievements noted may have occurred some time laterin some cases, a considerable time later (for example, &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, launched 20 August 1977, did not reach Neptune until 1989).

<doc id="81834" wikidata="Q193042" url="?curid=81834" title="Thomas Newcomen">
<text>Thomas Newcomen (; February 1664 – 5 August 1729) was an English inventor who created the atmospheric engine, the first practical fuel-burning engine in 1712. He was an ironmonger by trade and a Baptist lay preacher by calling.

He was born in Dartmouth, in Devon, England, to a merchant family and baptised at St. Saviour&#x27;s Church on 28 February 1664. In those days, flooding in coal and tin mines was a major problem. Newcomen was soon engaged in trying to improve ways to pump out the water from such mines. His ironmonger&#x27;s business specialised in designing, manufacturing and selling tools for the mining industry.

==Religious life==

Thomas Newcomen was a lay preacher and a teaching elder in the local Baptist church. After 1710, he became the pastor of a local group of Baptists. His father had been one of a group who brought the well-known Puritan minister John Flavel to Dartmouth. Later one of Newcomen&#x27;s business contacts in London, Edward Wallin, was another Baptist minister who had connections with the well-known Doctor John Gill of Horsleydown, Southwark. Newcomen&#x27;s connection with the Baptist church at Bromsgrove materially aided the spread of his steam engine, as the engineers Jonathan Hornblower Sr. and his son were involved in the same church.

==Developing the atmospheric engine==

Newcomen&#x27;s great achievement was his steam engine, developed around 1712; combining the ideas of Thomas Savery and Denis Papin, he created a steam engine for the purpose of lifting water out of a tin mine. It is likely that Newcomen was already acquainted with Savery, whose forebears were merchants in south Devon. Savery also had a post with the Commissioners for Sick and Hurt Seamen, which took him to Dartmouth. Savery had devised a &quot;fire engine&quot;, a kind of thermic syphon, in which steam was admitted to an empty container and then condensed. The vacuum thus created was used to suck water from the sump at the bottom of the mine. The &quot;fire engine&quot; was not very effective and could not work beyond a limited depth of around thirty feet.

Newcomen replaced the receiving vessel (where the steam was condensed) with a cylinder containing a piston based on Papin&#x27;s design. Instead of the vacuum drawing in water, it drew down the piston. This was used to work a beam engine, in which a large wooden beam rocked upon a central fulcrum. On the other side of the beam was a chain attached to a pump at the base of the mine. As the steam cylinder was refilled with steam, readying it for the next power stroke, water was drawn into the pump cylinder and expelled into a pipe to the surface by the weight of the machinery. Newcomen and his partner John Calley built the first successful engine of this type at the Conygree Coalworks near Dudley in the West Midlands. A working replica of this engine can be seen at the Black Country Living Museum nearby.

==Later life and death==
Comparatively little is known of Newcomen&#x27;s later life. After 1715, the engine affairs were conducted through an unincorporated company, the &#x27;Proprietors of the Invention for Raising Water by Fire&#x27;. Its secretary and treasurer was John Meres, clerk to the Society of Apothecaries in London. That society formed a company which had a monopoly on supplying medicines to the Navy providing a close link with Savery, whose will he witnessed. The Committee of the Proprietors also included Edward Wallin, a Baptist of Swedish descent; and pastor of a church at Maze Pond, Southwark. Newcomen died at Wallin&#x27;s house in 1729, and was buried at Bunhill Fields burial ground on the outskirts of the City of London; the exact site of his grave is unknown.

By 1733, about 125 Newcomen engines, operating under Savery&#x27;s patent (extended by statute so that it did not expire until 1733), had been installed by Newcomen and others in most of the important mining districts of Britain and on the Continent of Europe: draining coal mines in the Black Country, Warwickshire and near Newcastle upon Tyne; at tin and copper mines in Cornwall; and in lead mines in Flintshire and Derbyshire, amongst other places.

==After Newcomen==
The Newcomen engine held its place without material change for about 75 years, spreading gradually to more areas of the UK and mainland Europe. At first brass cylinders were used, but these were expensive and limited in size. New iron casting techniques pioneered by the Coalbrookdale Company in the 1720s allowed bigger cylinders to be used, up to about 6 feet (1.8 m) in diameter by the 1760s. Experience led to better construction and minor refinements in layout. Its mechanical details were much improved by John Smeaton, who built many large engines of this type in the early 1770s; his improvements were rapidly adopted. By 1775, about 600 Newcomen engines had been built, although many of these had worn out before then, and been abandoned or replaced.

The Newcomen Engine was by no means an efficient machine, although it was probably as complicated as engineering and materials techniques of the early 18th century could support. Much heat was lost when condensing the steam, as this cooled the cylinder. This did not matter unduly at a colliery, where unsaleable small coal (slack) was available, but significantly increased the mining costs where coal was not readily available, as in Cornwall. Newcomen&#x27;s engine was gradually replaced after 1775 in areas where coal was expensive (especially in Cornwall) by an improved design, invented by James Watt, in which the steam was condensed in a separate condenser. The Watt steam engine, aided by better engineering techniques including Wilkinson&#x27;s boring machine, was much more fuel efficient, enabling Watt and his partner Matthew Boulton to collect substantial royalties based on the fuel saved.

Watt subsequently made other improvements, including the double-acting engine, where both the up and down strokes were power strokes. These were especially suitable for driving textile mills, and many Watt engines were employed in these industries. At first attempts to drive machinery by Newcomen engines had mixed success, as the single power stroke produced a jerky motion, but use of flywheels and better engineering largely overcame these problems. By 1800, hundreds of non-Watt rotary engines had been built, especially in collieries and ironworks where irregular motion was not a problem but also in textile mills.

Despite Watt&#x27;s improvements, Common Engines (as they were then known) remained in use for a considerable time, and many more Newcomen engines than Watt ones were built even during the period of Watt&#x27;s patent (up to 1800), as they were cheaper and less complicated. Of over 2,200 engines built in the 18th century, only about 450 were Watt engines. Elements of Watt&#x27;s design, especially the Separate Condenser, were incorporated in many &quot;pirate&quot; engines. Even after 1800 Newcomen type engines continued to be built and condensers were added routinely to these. They were also commonly retro-fitted to existing Newcomen engines (the so-called &quot;pickle-pot&quot; condenser).

==Surviving Newcomen engines==

There are examples of Newcomen engines in the Science Museum, London, England and the Ford Museum, Dearborn, Michigan US, amongst other places.

In 1964, the Newcomen Society of London arranged for a Newcomen engine at Hawkesbury Junction, Warwickshire to be transferred to Dartmouth, where it can be seen working using a hydraulic arrangement instead of the steam boiler. According to Dr. Cyril Boucher of the Newcomen Society, this Newcomen Memorial Engine dates from about 1725, with new valve gear and other parts added later.

Perhaps the last Newcomen-style engine to be used commercially – and the last still remaining on its original site – is at the Elsecar Heritage Centre, near Barnsley in South Yorkshire. It was restored to working condition between 2012 and 2015, the refurbished engine was unveiled by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, in May 2016. Another Newcomen engine that can be shown working is the modern replica engine at the Black Country Museum in Dudley, West Midlands. The Newcomen Memorial Engine at Dartmouth can be seen moving, but is worked by hydraulics.

==Recognition==
On 23 February 2012 the Royal Mail released a stamp featuring Newcomen&#x27;s atmospheric steam engine as part its &quot;Britons of Distinction&quot; series.

<doc id="81837" wikidata="Q202902" url="?curid=81837" title="The Crystal Palace">
<text>The Crystal Palace was a cast iron and plate glass structure, originally built in Hyde Park, London, to house the Great Exhibition of 1851. The exhibition took place from 1 May to 15 October 1851, and more than 14,000 exhibitors from around the world gathered in its exhibition space to display examples of technology developed in the Industrial Revolution. Designed by Joseph Paxton, the Great Exhibition building was long, with an interior height of , and was three times the size of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

The 293,000 panes of glass were manufactured by the Chance Brothers. The 990,000-square-foot building with its 128-foot-high ceiling was completed in thirty-nine weeks. The Crystal Palace boasted the greatest area of glass ever seen in a building. It astonished visitors with its clear walls and ceilings that did not require interior lights.

It has been suggested that the name of the building resulted from a piece penned by the playwright Douglas Jerrold, who in July 1850 wrote in the satirical magazine &quot;Punch&quot; about the forthcoming Great Exhibition, referring to a &quot;palace of very crystal&quot;.

After the exhibition, the Palace was relocated to an open area of South London known as Penge Place which had been excised from Penge Common. It was rebuilt at the top of Penge Peak next to Sydenham Hill, an affluent suburb of large villas. It stood there from June 1854 until its destruction by fire in November 1936. The nearby residential area was renamed Crystal Palace after the landmark. This included the Crystal Palace Park that surrounds the site, home of the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre, which was previously a football stadium that hosted the FA Cup Final between 1895 and 1914. Crystal Palace F.C. were founded at the site and played at the Cup Final venue in their early years. The park still contains Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins&#x27;s Crystal Palace Dinosaurs which date back to 1854.

==Original Hyde Park building==

===Conception===

The huge, modular, iron, wood and glass, structure was originally erected in Hyde Park in London to house the Great Exhibition of 1851, which showcased the products of many countries throughout the world. The commission in charge of mounting the Great Exhibition was established in January 1850, and it was decided at the outset that the entire project would be funded by public subscription. An executive building committee was quickly formed to oversee the design and construction of the exhibition building, comprising accomplished engineers Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Robert Stephenson, renowned architects Charles Barry and Thomas Leverton Donaldson, and chaired by William Cubitt. By 15 March 1850 they were ready to invite submissions which had to conform to several key specifications: the building had to be temporary, simple, as cheap as possible, and economical to build within the short time remaining before the exhibition opening, which had already been scheduled for 1 May 1851.

Within three weeks, the committee had received some 245 entries, including 38 international submissions from Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hanover, Switzerland, Brunswick, Hamburg and France. Two designs, both in iron and glass, were singled out for praise—one by Richard Turner, co-designer of the Palm House, Kew Gardens, and the other by French architect Hector Horeau but despite the great number of submissions, the committee rejected them all. Turner was furious at the rejection and reportedly badgered the commissioners for months afterwards, seeking compensation, but at an estimated £300,000, his design (like Horeau&#x27;s) was too expensive.

As a last resort, the committee came up with a standby design of its own, for a brick building in the &quot;rundbogenstil&quot; (round-arch style) by Donaldson, featuring a sheet-iron dome designed by Tunnel, but it was widely criticized and ridiculed when it was published in the newspapers. Adding to the committee&#x27;s woes, the site for the exhibition was still not confirmed. The preferred site was in Hyde Park, adjacent to Princes Gate near Pennington Road, but other sites considered included Wormwood Scrubs, Battersea Park, the Isle of Dogs, Victoria Park, and Regent&#x27;s Park.

Opponents of the scheme lobbied strenuously against the use of Hyde Park (and they were strongly supported by &quot;The Times&quot;). The most outspoken critic was Charles Sibthorp; he denounced the exhibition as &quot;one of the greatest humbugs, frauds and absurdities ever known,&quot; and his trenchant opposition to both the exhibition and its building continued even after it had closed.

At this point, renowned gardener Joseph Paxton became interested in the project, and with the enthusiastic backing of commission member Henry Cole, he decided to submit his own design. At this time, Paxton was chiefly known for his celebrated career as the head gardener for the Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth House. By 1850, Paxton had become a preeminent figure in British horticulture and had also earned great renown as a freelance garden designer; his works included the pioneering public gardens at Birkenhead Park which directly influenced the design of New York&#x27;s Central Park.

At Chatsworth, he had experimented extensively with glasshouse construction, developing many novel techniques for modular construction, using combinations of standard-sized sheets of glass, laminated wood, and prefabricated cast iron. The &quot;Great Stove&quot; (or conservatory) at Chatsworth (built in 1836) was the first major application of his ridge-and-furrow roof design and was at the time the largest glass building in the world, covering around .

A decade later, taking advantage of the availability of the new cast plate glass, Paxton further developed his techniques with the Chatsworth Lily House, which featured a flat-roof version of the ridge-and-furrow glazing, and a curtain wall system that allowed the hanging of vertical bays of glass from cantilevered beams. The Lily House was built specifically to house the &quot;Victoria amazonica&quot; waterlily which had recently been discovered by European botanists; the first specimen to reach England was originally kept at Kew Gardens, but it did not do well. Paxton&#x27;s reputation as a gardener was so high by that time that he was invited to take the lily to Chatsworth. It thrived under his care, and in 1849 he caused a sensation in the horticultural world when he succeeded in producing the first &quot;amazonica&quot; flowers to be grown in England. His daughter Alice was drawn for the newspapers, standing on one of the leaves. The lily and its house led directly to Paxton&#x27;s design for the Crystal Palace. He later cited the huge ribbed floating leaves as a key inspiration.

Paxton left his meeting with Cole on 9 June 1850 fired with enthusiasm. He immediately went to Hyde Park, where he walked the site earmarked for the Exhibition. Two days later on 11 June, while attending a board meeting of the Midland Railway, Paxton made his original concept drawing, which he doodled onto a sheet of pink blotting paper. This rough sketch (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum) incorporated all the basic features of the finished building, and it is a mark of Paxton&#x27;s ingenuity and industriousness that detailed plans, calculations and costings were ready to submit in less than two weeks. (The statue of Albert, Prince Consort, in Perth, Scotland, was sculpted with the subject holding a plan of the Crystal Palace. The statue was unveiled by Queen Victoria in 1864.)

The project was a major gamble for Paxton, but circumstances were in his favour: he enjoyed a stellar reputation as a garden designer and builder, he was confident that his design was perfectly suited to the brief, and the commission was under pressure to choose a design and get it built, with the exhibition opening less than a year away. In the event, Paxton&#x27;s design fulfilled and surpassed all the requirements, and it proved to be vastly faster and cheaper to build than any other form of building of a comparable size. His submission was budgeted at a remarkably low £85,800. By comparison, this was about times more than the Great Stove at Chatsworth but it was only 28% of the estimated cost of Turner&#x27;s design, and it promised a building which, with a footprint of over , would cover roughly 25 times the ground area of its progenitor.

Impressed by the low bid for the construction contract submitted by the civil engineering contractor Fox, Henderson and Co, the commission accepted the scheme and gave its public endorsement to Paxton&#x27;s design in July 1850. He was exultant but now had less than eight months to finalize his plans, manufacture the parts and erect the building in time for the exhibition&#x27;s opening, which was scheduled for 1 May 1851. Paxton was able to design and build the largest glass structure yet created, from scratch, in less than a year, and complete it on schedule and on budget.

He was even able to alter the design shortly before building began, adding a high, barrel-vaulted transept across the centre of the building, at 90 degrees to the main gallery, under which he was able to safely enclose several large elm trees that would otherwise have had to be felled—thereby also resolving a controversial issue that had been a major sticking point for the vocal anti-exhibition lobby.

=== Design ===
Paxton&#x27;s modular, hierarchical design reflected his practical brilliance as a designer and problem-solver. It incorporated many breakthroughs, offered practical advantages that no conventional building of that era could match and, above all, it embodied the spirit of British innovation and industrial might that the Great Exhibition was intended to celebrate.

The geometry of the Crystal Palace was a classic example of the concept of form following manufacturer&#x27;s limitations: the shape and size of the whole building was directly based around the size of the panes of glass made by the supplier, Chance Brothers of Smethwick. These were the largest available at the time, measuring wide by long. Because the entire building was scaled around those dimensions, it meant that nearly the whole outer surface could be glazed using hundreds of thousands of identical panes, thereby drastically reducing both their production cost and the time needed to install them.

The original Hyde Park building was essentially a vast, flat-roofed rectangular hall. A huge open gallery ran along the main axis, with wings extending down either side. The main exhibition space was two stories high, with the upper floor stepped in from the boundary. Most of the building had a flat-profile roof, except for the central transept, which was covered by a barrel-vaulted roof that stood high at the top of the arch. Both the flat-profile sections and the arched transept roof were constructed using the key element of Paxton&#x27;s design: his patented ridge-and-furrow roofing system, which had first seen use at Chatsworth. The basic roofing unit, in essence, took the form of a long triangular prism, which made it both extremely light and very strong, and meant it could be built with the minimum amount of materials.

Paxton set the dimensions of this prism by using the length of single pane of glass () as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, thereby creating a triangle with a length-to-height ratio of 2.5:1, whose base (adjacent side) was long. By mirroring this triangle he obtained the gables that formed the vertical faces at either end of the prism, each of which was long. With this arrangement, Paxton could glaze the entire roof surface with identical panes that did not need to be trimmed. Paxton placed three of these by roof units side-by-side, horizontally supported by a grid of cast iron beams, which was held up on slim cast iron pillars. The resulting cube, with a floor area of by , formed the basic structural module of the building.

By multiplying these modules into a grid, the structure could be extended virtually indefinitely. In its original form, the ground level of the Crystal Palace (in plan) measured by , which equates to a grid 77 modules long by 19 modules wide. As each module was self-supporting, Paxton was able to leave out modules in some areas, creating larger square or rectangular spaces within the building to accommodate larger exhibits. On the lower level, these larger spaces were covered by the floor above, and on the upper level by longer spans of roofing, but the dimensions of these larger spaces were always multiples of the basic by grid unit.

The modules were also strong enough to be stacked vertically, enabling Paxton to add an upper floor that nearly doubled the amount of available exhibition space. The first floor galleries were double the height of the ground floor galleries below, and the Crystal Palace could theoretically have accommodated a full second-floor gallery, but this space was left open. Paxton also used longer trellis girders to create a clear span for the roof of the immense central gallery, which was wide and long.

Paxton&#x27;s roofing system incorporated his elegant solution to the problem of draining the building&#x27;s vast roof area. Like the Chatsworth Lily House (but different to its later incarnation at Sydenham Hill), most of the roof of the original Hyde Park structure had a horizontal profile, so heavy rain posed a potentially serious safety hazard. Because normal cast glass is brittle and has low tensile strength, there was a risk that the weight of any excess water build-up on the roof might have caused panes to shatter, showering shards of glass onto the patrons, ruining the valuable exhibits beneath, and weakening the structure.

Paxton&#x27;s ridge-and-furrow roof was designed to shed water very effectively. Rain ran off the angled glass roof panes into U-shaped timber channels which ran the length of each roof section at the bottom of the &#x27;furrow&#x27;. These channels were ingeniously multifunctional. During construction, they served as the rails that supported and guided the trolleys on which the glaziers sat as they installed the roofing. Once completed, the channels acted both as the joists that supported the roof sections, and as guttering—a patented design now widely known as a &quot;Paxton gutter&quot;.

These gutters conducted the rainwater to the ends of each furrow, where they emptied into the larger main gutters, which were set at right angles to the smaller gutters, along the top of the main horizontal roof beams. These main gutters drained at either end into the cast iron columns, which also had an ingenious dual function: each was cast with a hollow core, allowing it to double as a concealed down-pipe that carried the storm-water down into the drains beneath the building. One of the few issues Paxton could not completely solve was leaks—when completed, rain was found to be leaking into the huge building in over a thousand places. The leaks were sealed with putty, but the relatively poor quality of the sealant materials available at that time meant that the problem was never totally overcome.
To maintain a comfortable temperature inside such a large glass building was another major challenge, because the Great Exhibition took place decades before the introduction of electricity and air-conditioning. Glasshouses rely on the fact that they accumulate and retain heat from the sun, but such heat buildup would have been a major problem for the exhibition. This would have been exacerbated by the heat produced by the thousands of people who would be in the building at any given time. Paxton solved this with two clever strategies. One was to install external canvas shade-cloths that were stretched across the roof ridges. These served multiple functions: they reduced heat transmission, moderated and softened the light coming into the building, and acted as a primitive evaporative cooling system when water was sprayed onto them. The other part of the solution was Paxton&#x27;s ingenious ventilation system. Each of the modules that formed the outer walls of the building was fitted with a prefabricated set of louvres that could be opened and closed using a gear mechanism, allowing hot stale air to escape. The flooring consisted of boards wide which were spaced about apart; together with the louvres, this formed an effective passive air-conditioning system. Because of the pressure differential, the hot air escaping from the louvres generated a constant airflow that drew cooler air up through the gaps in the floor.

The floor too had a dual function: the gaps between the boards acted as a grating that allowed dust and small pieces of refuse to fall or be swept through them onto the ground beneath, where it was collected daily by a team of cleaning boys. Paxton also designed machines to sweep the floors at the end of each day. But in practice, it was found that the trailing skirts of the female visitors did the job well.

Thanks to the considerable economies of scale Paxton was able to exploit, the manufacture and assembly of the building parts was exceedingly quick and cheap. Each module was identical, fully prefabricated, self-supporting, and fast and easy to erect. All of the parts could be mass-produced in large numbers, and many parts served multiple functions, further reducing both the number of parts needed and their overall cost. Because of its comparatively low weight, the Crystal Palace required no heavy masonry for supporting walls or foundations. The relatively light concrete footings on which it stood could be left in the ground once the building was removed (they remain in place today just beneath the surface of the site). The modules could be erected as quickly as the parts could reach the site—some sections were standing within eighteen hours of leaving the factory—and since each unit was self-supporting, workers were able to assemble much of the building section-by-section, without having to wait for other parts to be finished.

=== Construction ===

Fox, Henderson and Co took possession of the site in July 1850, and erected wooden hoardings which were constructed using the timber that later became the floorboards of the finished building. More than 5,000 navvies worked on the building during its construction, with up to 2,000 on site at one time during the peak building phase. More than 1,000 iron columns supported 2,224 trellis girders and 30 miles of guttering, comprising 4,000 tons of iron in all.

Firstly stakes were driven into the ground to roughly mark out the positions for the cast iron columns; these points were then set precisely by theodolite measurements. Then the concrete foundations were poured, and the base plates for the columns were set into them. Once the foundations were in place, the erection of the modules proceeded rapidly. Connector brackets were attached to the top of each column before erection, and these were then hoisted into position.

The project took place before the development of powered cranes; the raising of the columns was done manually using shear legs (or shears), a simple crane mechanism. These consisted of two strong poles which were set several meters apart at the base and then lashed together at the top to form a triangle; this was stabilized and kept vertical by guy ropes fixed to the apex, stretched taut and tied to stakes driven into the ground some distance away. Using pulleys and ropes hung from the apex of the shear, the navvies hoisted the columns, girders and other parts into place.

As soon as two adjacent columns had been erected, a girder was hoisted into place between them and bolted onto the connectors. The columns were erected in opposite pairs, then two more girders were connected to form a self-supporting square—this was the basic frame of each module. The shears would then be moved along and an adjoining bay constructed. When a reasonable number of bays had been completed, the columns for the upper floor were erected (longer shear-legs were used for this, but the operation was essentially the same as for the ground floor). Once the ground floor structure was complete, the final assembly of the upper floor followed rapidly.

For the glazing, Paxton used larger versions of machines he had originally devised for the Great Stove at Chatsworth, installing on-site production line systems, powered by steam engines, that dressed and finished the building parts. These included a machine that mechanically grooved the wooden window sash bars and a painting machine that automatically dipped the parts in paint and then passed them through a series of rotating brushes to remove the excess.
The last major components to be put into place were the 16 semi-circular ribs of the vaulted transept, which were the only major structural parts that were made of wood. These were raised into position as eight pairs, and all were fixed into place within a week. Thanks to the simplicity of Paxton&#x27;s design and the combined efficiency of the building contractor and their suppliers, the entire structure was assembled with extraordinary speed: a team of 80 men could fix more than 18,000 panes of sheet glass in a week, and the building was completed and ready to receive exhibits in just five months.

According to a study by John Gardner of Anglia Ruskin University, published in The International Journal for the History of Engineering &amp; Technology,the speed of the erection work was thanks to the use, for the first time, of nuts and bolts made to what was later to be known as the British Standard Whitworth (BSW), when up to that time nuts and bolts were made individually, and could not be interchanged.

When completed, the Crystal Palace provided an unrivalled space for exhibits, since it was essentially a self-supporting shell standing on slim iron columns, with no internal structural walls whatsoever. Because it was covered almost entirely in glass, it also needed no artificial lighting during the day, thereby reducing the exhibition&#x27;s running costs.

Full-size elm trees growing in the park were enclosed within the central exhibition hall near the tall Crystal Fountain. However this caused a problem with sparrows becoming a nuisance, and shooting was out of the question inside a glass building. Queen Victoria mentioned this problem to the Duke of Wellington, who offered the solution, &quot;Sparrowhawks, Ma&#x27;am&quot;.
Paxton was acclaimed worldwide for his achievement and was knighted by Queen Victoria in recognition of his work. The project was engineered by William Cubitt; Paxton&#x27;s construction partner was the ironwork contractor Fox and Henderson, whose director Charles Fox was also knighted for his contribution. The 900,000 square feet (84,000 m2) of glass was provided by the Chance Brothers glassworks in Smethwick. This was the only glassworks capable of fulfilling such a large order; it had to bring in labour from the Saint-Gobain glassworks in France to fulfil the order in time. The final dimensions were long by wide. The building was high, with on the ground floor alone.

== Great Exhibition ==

The Great Exhibition was opened on 1 May 1851 by Queen Victoria. It was the first of the World&#x27;s fair exhibitions of culture and industry. There were some 100,000 objects, displayed along more than ten miles, by over 15,000 contributors. Britain occupied half the display space inside with exhibits from the home country and the empire. France was the largest foreign contributor. The exhibits were grouped into four main categories—Raw Materials, Machinery, Manufacturers and Fine Arts. The exhibits ranged from the Koh-i-Noor diamond, Sèvres porcelain, and music organs to a massive hydraulic press, and a fire engine. There was also a 27-foot tall Crystal Fountain.

In the first week, the prices were £1; they were then reduced to five shillings for the next three weeks, a price which still effectively limited entrance to middle-class and aristocratic visitors. The working classes finally came to the exhibition on 26 May, when weekday prices were reduced to one shilling (although the price was two shillings and sixpence on Fridays, and still five shillings on Saturdays). Over six million admissions were counted at the toll-gates, although the proportion which were repeat/returning visitors is not known. The event made a surplus of £186,000 (equivalent to £), money which was used to found the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum and the Natural History Museum in South Kensington.

The Crystal Palace had the first major installation of public toilets, the &quot;Retiring Rooms&quot;, in which sanitary engineer George Jennings installed his &quot;Monkey Closet&quot; flushing lavatory (initially just for men but later catering for women also). During the exhibition, 827,280 visitors each paid one penny to use them. It is often suggested that the euphemism &quot;spending a penny&quot; originated at the exhibition, but the phrase is more likely to date from the 1890s when public lavatories, fitted with penny-coin-operated locks, were first established by British local authorities. The Great Exhibition closed on 15 October 1851.

== Sydenham Hill ==

=== Relocation and redesign ===
The life of the Great Exhibition was limited to six months, after which something had to be decided on the future of the Crystal Palace building. Against the wishes of parliamentary opponents, a consortium of eight businessmen, including Samuel Laing and Leo Schuster, who were both board members of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR), formed a holding company and proposed that the edifice be taken down and relocated to a property named Penge Place, which had been excised from Penge Common at the top of Sydenham Hill.

The reconstruction of the Crystal Palace began on Sydenham Hill in 1852. The new building, while incorporating most of the constructional parts of the original one at Hyde Park, was so completely different in form as to be properly considered a quite different structure – a &#x27;Beaux-arts&#x27; form in glass and metal. The main gallery was redesigned and covered with a barrel-vaulted roof; the central transept was greatly enlarged and made even higher; the large arch of the main entrance was framed by a new facade and served by an imposing set of terraces and stairways. The building measured feet in length by feet across the transepts.

The new building was elevated several metres above the surrounding grounds, and two large transepts were added at either end of the main gallery. It was modified and enlarged so much that it extended beyond the boundary of Penge Place, which was also the boundary between Surrey and Kent. The reconstruction was recorded for posterity by Philip Henry Delamotte, and his photographs were widely disseminated in his published works. The Crystal Palace Company also commissioned Negretti and Zambra to produce stereographs of the interior and grounds of the building. Within two years the rebuilt Crystal Palace was complete, and on 10 June 1854, Queen Victoria again performed an opening ceremony, in the presence of 40,000 guests.

Several localities claim to be the area to which the building was moved. The street address of the Crystal Palace was Sydenham (SE26) after 1917, but the actual building and parklands were mostly in Penge with the eastern portion in Beckenham, Kent. When built, most of the buildings were in the County of Surrey, as were the majority of grounds, but in 1899 the county boundary was moved, transferring the entire site to Penge Urban District in Kent. The site is now within the Crystal Palace &amp; Anerley Ward of the London Borough of Bromley.

Two railway stations were opened to serve the permanent exhibition:
*Crystal Palace High Level: developed by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, it was a building designed by Edward Middleton Barry, from which a subway under the Parade led directly to the entrance.
*Crystal Palace Low Level: developed by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, it is located just off Anerley Road.

The Low Level station is still in use as , while the only remains of the High Level station are the subway under the Parade with its Italian mosaic roofing, a Grade II* listed building. The South Gate is served by Penge West railway station. For some time this station was on an atmospheric railway. This is often confused with a 550-metre pneumatic passenger railway which was exhibited at the Crystal Palace in 1864, which was known as the Crystal Palace pneumatic railway.

=== Exhibitions and events ===

Dozens of experts such as Matthew Digby Wyatt and Owen Jones were hired to create a series of courts that provided a narrative of the history of fine art. Amongst these were Augustus Pugin&#x27;s Mediaeval Court from the Great Exhibition, as well as courts illustrating Egyptian, Alhambra, Roman, Renaissance, Pompeian, and Grecian art and many others.

During the year of re-opening, 18 handbooks were published in the Crystal Palace Library by Bradbury and Evans as guides to the new installations. Many of these were written by the specialists involved in creating and curating the new displays. So the 1854 guide to the Egyptian Court, destroyed in the 1866 fire, was entitled: &#x27;The Egyptian Court in the Crystal Palace. Described by Owen Jones, architect, and Joseph Bonomi, sculptor&#x27;. That which included a description of the dinosaurs was entitled: &#x27;Geology and Inhabitants of the Ancient World. Described by Richard Owen, FRS. The animals constructed by B.W. Hawkins, FGS&#x27;.

In the central transept was the 4,000-piece Grand Orchestra built around the 4,500-pipe Great Organ. There was a concert room with over 4,000 seats that hosted successful Handel Festivals for many years and August Manns&#x27;s Crystal Palace Concerts from 1855 until 1901. The performance spaces hosted concerts, exhibits, and public entertainment. Many famous people visited the Crystal Palace especially during its early years, including the likes of Emma Darwin, the wife of Charles Darwin who noted in her diary on 10 June 1854, &quot;Opening Crystal Pal&quot;.
The centre transept once housed a circus and was the scene of daring feats by acts such as the tightrope walker Charles Blondin. Over the years, many world leaders visited and were accorded special festivals, with extended published programs. That for Giuseppe Garibaldi was entitled &quot;General Garibaldi&#x27;s Italian Reception and Concert Saturday April 16, 1864&quot;; and that for the Shah of Persia: &quot;Crystal Palace. Grand Fête in honour of His Majesty The Shah of Persia KG. Saturday July 6th&quot; (1889).

From the beginning general programmes were printed, at first for the summer season, and then on a daily basis. So, for instance, that for the summer of 1864 (&quot;Programme of arrangements for the eleventh season, commencing on the 1st May, 1864&quot;) included the Shakespeare Tercentenary Festival and a course by designer Christopher Dresser. The daily &quot;Programme for Monday October 6th (1873)&quot; included a harvest exhibition of fruit, and the Australasian Collection, formed by H E Pain, of materials from Tasmania, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Australia and New Zealand; and a grand military fete was also on offer.

Many of these publications were printed by Dickens and Evans—that, is Charles Dickens Jr, Charles Dickens&#x27; son, working with his father-in-law Frederick Evans. Another feature of the early programming were Christmas pantomimes, with published librettos, for example Harry Lemon&#x27;s &#x27;Dick Whittington and His Wonderful Cat. Crystal Palace Christmas 1869–70&#x27; (London 1869).

In 1868, the world&#x27;s first aeronautical exhibition was held in the Crystal Palace. In 1871, the world&#x27;s first cat show, organised by Harrison Weir, was held there. Other shows, such as dog shows, pigeon shows, honey shows and flower shows, as well as the first national motor show were also held at the Palace. The match which later has been dubbed the world&#x27;s first bandy match was held at the palace in 1875; at the time, the game was called &quot;hockey on the ice&quot;. The site was the location of one of Charles Spurgeon&#x27;s sermons, without amplification, before a crowd of 23,654 people on 7 October 1857.

The 1895 African Exhibition at the Crystal Palace included African animals, birds and reptiles, and a group of eighty Somalis. In 1905, the Colonial and Indian Exhibition took place and is reported to have been larger and more popular than the African Exhibition and the most direct forerunner of the 1911 Festival of Empire.

A colourful description of a visit to the Crystal Palace appears in John Davidson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Crystal Palace&quot;, published in 1909. In 1909, Robert Baden-Powell first noticed the interest of girls in Scouting while attending a Boy Scout meeting at Crystal Palace. This observation later led to the formation of Girl Guides, then Girl Scouts.
In 1911, the Festival of Empire was held at the Palace to mark the Coronation of George V and Mary. Large pavilions were built for and by the Dominions; that for Canada, for example, replicated the Parliament in Ottawa. A good record of the festival is provided by the photogravure plates in the sale catalogue published shortly afterwards by Knight, Frank and Rutley and Horne &amp; Co &quot;The Crystal Palace Sydenham To be sold at auction on Tuesday 28th November&quot; (London, 1911)

During the First World War, it was used as a naval training establishment, under the name of HMS &quot;Victory VI&quot;, informally known as HMS &quot;Crystal Palace&quot;. More than 125,000 men from the Royal Naval Division, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and Royal Naval Air Service were trained for war at &quot;Victory VI&quot;. Towards the end of the First World War, the Crystal Palace re-opened as the site of the first Imperial War Museum; in 1920, this major initiative was fully launched with a program as the &#x27;Imperial War Museum and Great Victory Exhibition Crystal Palace&#x27; (published by Photocrom). A few years later, the Imperial War Museum moved to South Kensington, and then in the 1930s to its present site Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, formerly Bethlem Royal Hospital. Between 15 and 20 October 1934, the Pageant of Labour was held at the Palace.

=== Crystal Palace Park ===

The development of ground and gardens of the park cost considerably more than the rebuilt Crystal Palace. Edward Milner designed the Italian Garden and fountains, the Great Maze, and the English Landscape Garden. Raffaele Monti was hired to design and build much of the external statuary around the fountain basins, and the urns, tazzas and vases.

The sculptor Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins was commissioned to make 33 lifesized models of newly discovered dinosaurs and other extinct animals in the park. The Palace and its park became the location of many shows, concerts and exhibitions, as well as sporting events after the construction of various sports grounds on the site. The FA Cup Final was held here between 1895 and 1914. On the new site were also various buildings that housed educational establishments such as the Crystal Palace School of Art, Science, and Literature as well as engineering schools.
Joseph Paxton was first and foremost a gardener, and his layout of gardens, fountains, terraces and waterfalls left no doubt as to his ability. One thing he did have a problem with was water supply. Such was his enthusiasm that thousands of gallons of water were needed to feed the myriad fountains and cascades abounding in the Park: the two main jets were high. Water towers were duly constructed, but the weight of water in the raised tanks caused them to collapse.

Isambard Kingdom Brunel was consulted and came up with plans for two mighty water towers, one at the north end of the building and one at the south. Each supported a tremendous load of water, which was gathered from three reservoirs, at either end of and in the middle of the park. The grand fountains and cascades were opened, again in the presence of the Queen, who got wet when a gust of wind swept mists of spray over the royal carriage.

=== Decline ===
While the original Palace cost £150,000 (equivalent to £ in ), the move to Sydenham cost £1,300,000—(£ in ), burdening the company with a debt it never repaid. This was partly because admission fees were depressed by the inability to cater for Sunday visitors in its early years: many people worked every day except Sunday, when the Palace was closed. The Lord&#x27;s Day Observance Society held that people should not be encouraged to work at the Palace on Sunday and that if people wanted to visit, then their employers should give them time off during the working week. The Palace was eventually opened on Sundays by 1860, and it was recorded that 40,000 visitors came on a Sunday in May 1861.
By the 1890s, the Palace&#x27;s popularity and state of repair had deteriorated; the appearance of stalls and booths had made it a much more downmarket attraction.
In the years after the Festival of Empire the building fell into disrepair, as the huge debt and maintenance costs became unsustainable, and in 1911, bankruptcy was declared. Robert Windsor-Clive, 1st Earl of Plymouth bought it for £230,000 () to save it from the developers with the understanding that a fund raised by the Lord Mayor of London would reimburse him. The mayor announced in 1913 that £90,000 was still required in addition to the money already raised by local authorities. &quot;The Times&quot; held an appeal, and the amount was raised in 13 days; £30,000 was contributed by an unknown individual. Camberwell Borough Council refused to contribute and Penge Urban District Council reduced their contribution from £20,000 to £5,000. The Earl of Plymouth made up the resulting deficit of some £30,000.

In the 1920s, a board of trustees was set up under the guidance of manager Sir Henry Buckland. He is said to have been a firm but fair man, who had a great love for the Crystal Palace, and soon set about restoring the deteriorating building. The restoration brought visitors back, and the Palace started to make a small profit once more. Buckland and his staff also worked on improving the fountains and gardens, including the Thursday evening displays of fireworks by Brocks.

== Destruction by fire ==

On the evening of 30 November 1936, Sir Henry Buckland was walking his dog near the Palace with his daughter Crystal, named after the building, when they noticed a red glow within it. When Buckland went inside, he found two of his employees fighting a small office fire that had started after an explosion in the women&#x27;s cloakroom. Realising that it was a serious fire, they called the Penge fire brigade. Although 89 fire engines and over 400 firemen arrived, they were unable to extinguish it.

Within hours, the Palace was destroyed: the glow was visible across eight counties. The fire spread quickly in the high winds that night, in part because of the dry old timber flooring, and the huge quantity of flammable materials in the building. Buckland said, &quot;In a few hours we have seen the end of the Crystal Palace. Yet it will live in the memories not only of Englishmen, but the whole world&quot;. One-hundred thousand people came to Sydenham Hill to watch the blaze, among them Winston Churchill, who said, &quot;This is the end of an age&quot;. Just as in 1866, when the north transept burnt down, the building was not adequately insured to cover the cost of rebuilding (at least £2million, or £ in ).

The South Tower and much of the lower level of the Palace had been used for tests by television pioneer John Logie Baird for his mechanical television experiments, and much of his work was destroyed in the fire. Baird is reported to have suspected the fire was a deliberate act of sabotage against his work on developing television, but the true cause remains unknown.

The last singer to perform there before the fire was the Australian ballad contralto Essie Ackland.

== Aftermath ==
All that was left standing after the fire were the two water towers and a section of the north end of the main nave which was too badly damaged to be saved. The south tower to the right of the Crystal Palace entrance was taken down shortly after the fire, as the damage sustained had undermined its integrity and presented a major risk to houses nearby. Thos. W. Ward Ltd., Sheffield, dismantled the Crystal Palace.

The north tower was demolished with explosives in 1941. No reason was given for its removal—it was rumoured that it was to remove a landmark for German aircraft in the Second World War. In fact Luftwaffe bombers actually navigated their way to central London by tracking the Thames. The Crystal Palace grounds were used as a manufacturing base for aircraft radar screens and other hi-tech equipment of the time. This remained a secret until well after the war.

After the destruction of the Palace, the High Level Branch station fell into disuse and was finally shut in 1954. After the war the site was used for a number of purposes. Between 1927 and 1972, the Crystal Palace motor racing circuit was located in the park, supported by the Greater London Council, but the noise was unpopular with nearby residents, and racing hours were regulated under a high court judgment. The Crystal Palace transmitting station was built on the former aquarium site in the mid-1950s and still serves as one of London&#x27;s main television transmission masts.

In northern corner of the park is the Crystal Palace Bowl, a natural amphitheatre where large-scale open-air summer concerts have been held since the 1960s. These have ranged from classical and orchestral music, to rock, pop, blues and reggae. Pink Floyd, Bob Marley, Elton John, Eric Clapton, and The Beach Boys played the Bowl during its heyday. The stage was rebuilt in 1997 with an award-winning permanent structure designed by Ian Ritchie. The Bowl has been inactive as a music venue for several years, and the stage has fallen into a state of disrepair, but as of March 2020 London Borough of Bromley Council are working with a local action group to find &quot;creative and community-minded business proposals to reactivate the cherished concert platform&quot;.

In 2020 the base and foundation of the south tower were given historic status. They are located near the Crystal Palace Museum on Anerley Hill, which is dedicated to the history of the building.

=== Future ===
Over the years, numerous proposals for the former site of the Palace have not come to fruition. Plans by the London Development Agency to spend £67.5 million to refurbish the site, including new homes and a regional sports centre were approved after Public Inquiry in December 2010. Before approval was announced the LDA withdrew from taking on management of the park and funding the project.

In 2013, the Chinese company ZhongRong Holdings held early talks with the London Borough of Bromley and Mayor Boris Johnson to rebuild the Crystal Palace on the north side of the park. However, the developer&#x27;s sixteen-month exclusivity agreement with Bromley council to develop its plans was cancelled when it expired in February 2015.

== Cultural significance ==

After a visit to London as a tourist during the Expedition of 1862, Fyodor Dostoevsky made reference to the Palace in his travelogue &quot;Winter Notes on Summer Impressions&quot; and in &quot;Notes from Underground&quot;. Dostoevsky viewed the Crystal Palace as a monument to soulless modern society, the myth of progress, and the worship of empty materialism.

In Nikolay Chernyshevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;What Is to Be Done?&quot;, the Crystal Palace is presented as the birth place of a new social order structured by reason and as a symbol of socialist utopia.

&quot;Crystal Palace&quot; is one of the &#x27;investitures&#x27; or meeting places of The Baker Street Irregulars, a Sherlock Holmes fan club.

<doc id="81842" wikidata="Q7205126" url="?curid=81842" title="Plot hole">
<text>In fiction, a plot hole, plothole, or plot error is a gap or inconsistency in a storyline that goes against the flow of logic established by the story&#x27;s plot. 

Plot holes are usually created unintentionally, often as a result of editing or the writers simply forgetting that a new event would contradict previous events.

Sometimes viewers disagree on whether a certain plot element constitutes an error.

==Types==
Types of plot hole include:

;Factual errors: Historical anachronisms, or incorrect statements about the world.
;Impossible events: Something that defies the laws of science, as established for the story&#x27;s setting.
;Out-of-character behavior: A character acting in a way that, based on their understanding of the options available to them, they would not realistically choose.
;Continuity errors: Events in the story which contradict those established earlier.
;Unresolved storylines: One of the plot lines is not resolved by the end of the story, or a character who is expected to reappear does not.

==Examples==
* At the end of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, it is considered imperative to hide Luke Skywalker from Darth Vader, but Obi-Wan Kenobi does so in plain sight on Vader&#x27;s home planet, even using Luke&#x27;s real name. He himself only slightly alters his name and makes no secret of his Jedi heritage.
* In the narrative climax of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee are rescued from Mordor by three giant eagles after destroying the One Ring. Some readers and viewers of the film adaptation have regarded this as a plot hole because the eagles could have flown a suitable Ring-bearer directly to Mordor in the first place, obviating much of the story&#x27;s plot. Craig Elvy of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; believes the perception of a plot hole might be due in part to the significantly compressed space and time dimensions of the film version, compared to the books.
* The 1991 Disney film &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; includes a line about a rose blooming until the prince&#x27;s twenty-first year, and a song in which Lumière the candelabra sings &quot;ten years we&#x27;ve been rusting&quot; - implying that the Prince was 11 when the curse was placed upon the castle, despite a painting showing him to have been older than this. The 2017 remake removed the rose reference and changed the lyric to &quot;too long we&#x27;ve been rusting&quot;.

<text>Freedom is a London-based anarchist news website and semi-annual journal published by Freedom Press. It was formerly either a monthly, a fortnightly or a weekly newspaper. It is the world&#x27;s oldest surviving anarchist publication, currently edited by Uri Gordon.

The paper was started in 1886 by volunteers including Peter Kropotkin and Charlotte Wilson and continued with a short interruption in the 1930s until 2014 as a regular publication, moving its news production online and publishing irregularly until 2016, when it became a bi-annual. Originally, the subtitle was &quot;A Journal of Anarchist Socialism&quot;. The title was changed to &quot;A Journal of Anarchist Communism&quot; in June 1889. Currently it&#x27;s labelled simply as an &quot;Anarchist Journal&quot;. The newspaper&#x27;s mission statement was originally stated in every issue and summarises the writers&#x27; view of anarchism:

The current printed issue does not carry a summary, but the website retains a section of the original 1886 introductory essay by Peter Kropotkin:
== History ==
The paper historically featured news from the peace and labour movements and events as well as listing planned events and protests. Staying true to Kropotkin&#x27;s principle of mutual aid, the paper regularly featured reviews of other anarchist and libertarian socialist publications, such as &quot;Organise!&quot; and &quot;Direct Action&quot; as well as other local and international newsletters and journals.

In 2006, the paper gained a colour front for the first time in its history. Along with a number of gradual changes in the content and structure of the paper and organisational changes at Freedom Press, &quot;Freedom&quot; got a re-design in January 2008. While remaining a fortnightly newspaper, it doubled the number of pages to 16 and reduced to A4 in size, introducing a basic theory section, dedicated business and public sector pages and an increased story count. In late 2011, it switched from fortnightly to monthly publication, which continued until its closure as a regular paper in 2014. It cost £2 per issue.

On 1 March 2014, &quot;Freedom&quot; announced the closure of its print edition as a monthly publication, continuing to publish online alongside a semi-annual printed freesheet. This was expanded into a 20-page journal from 2016.

&quot;Spain and the World&quot; was an anarchist publication founded in 1936 by Vernon Richards with former &quot;Freedom&quot; writers, which had effectively ceased publication in 1932. The intention was to provide an English-language publication to support Spanish anarchists who were at that time achieving a measure of political influence through the anarchist trade union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and other organisations. &quot;Spain and the World&quot; had several notable contributors, including Emma Goldman, Herbert Read, Ethel Mannin and John Cowper Powys.

Between the end of the Spanish Civil War and the outbreak of World War II, the fortnightly &quot;Spain and the World&quot; briefly became &quot;Revolt!&quot; in 1939 before adopting the title &quot;War Commentary&quot;. In 1945, &quot;War Commentary&quot; resumed the title of &quot;Freedom&quot;.

In 1944, Richards, his wife Marie-Louise Berneri and two others associated with the paper (Philip Sansom and John Hewetson) were charged with conspiring to cause disaffection among members of the armed forces. Despite a defence campaign backed by the likes of George Orwell, Michael Tippett, T. S. Eliot and Benjamin Britten, Vernon, Sansom and Hewetson were convicted and served nine months in jail.

Freedom Press compiled a selection of articles from &quot;Freedom&quot; in the 1991 book &quot;The State Is Your Enemy&quot;.

<text>Terry Lee Goodkind (January 11, 1948September 17, 2020) was an American writer. He was known for the epic fantasy series &quot;The Sword of Truth&quot; as well as the contemporary suspense novel &quot;The Law of Nines&quot; (2009), which has ties to his fantasy series. &quot;The Sword of Truth&quot; series sold 25 million copies worldwide and was translated into more than 20 languages. Additionally, it was adapted into a television series called &quot;Legend of the Seeker&quot;, which premiered on November 1, 2008, and ran for two seasons, ending in May 2010.

Goodkind was a proponent of Ayn Rand&#x27;s philosophical approach of Objectivism, and made references to Rand&#x27;s ideas and novels in his works.

==Early life==
Goodkind was born in 1948, and his home town was Omaha, Nebraska. Because he had dyslexia, he found little interest in school; therefore, he had no formal education beyond high school.

Goodkind&#x27;s dyslexia initially dissuaded him from any interest in writing. Before starting his career as a writer, Goodkind built cabinets and violins, and was a marine and wildlife artist, selling his paintings in galleries. 

==Career==
Goodkind&#x27;s started working on his first book, &quot;Wizard&#x27;s First Rule&quot;, in 1993. It was auctioned to a group of three publishers in 1994 and sold for a record price of $275,000. He subsequently published 16 other novels and one novella. All of his books, with the exceptions of &quot;Stone of Tears&quot; and &quot;Wizard&#x27;s First Rule&quot;, have appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. His books, &quot;Chainfire&quot; debuted at #3, in January 2005; &quot;Phantom&quot; at #1, in August 2006; and &quot;Confessor&quot; at #2, in November, 2007.

Some of Goodkind&#x27;s political views have provoked controversy, notably the dedication to his novel &quot;The Pillars of Creation&quot; (2001):

Don D&#x27;Ammassa described Goodkind as part of a &quot;host of brand new writers [with] no previous experience writing fiction but who could turn out one large epic adventure after another&quot;. Robert Eaglestone described his books as a &quot;depressing read&quot; due to the series&#x27; overarching cynicism, with a weakness being that the heroic characters are only likable in comparison with utterly murderous villains.

In June 2008, Goodkind signed a contract to publish three mainstream novels with G.P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons/Penguin Books. The first of these novels, titled &quot;The Law of Nines&quot;, was released August 18, 2009.

In April 2010, Goodkind signed a contract to publish three more novels with Tor Books, the first of which revisited the world and characters of the Sword of Truth series. Tor Books published the first new novel, &quot;The Omen Machine&quot;, on August 16, 2011. Goodkind self-published the second new novel, &quot;The First Confessor: the Legend of Magda Searus&quot;, on July 2, 2012; the book was ranked #28 on the Kindle bestseller list by the next morning. Tor Books released the sequel to &quot;the Omen Machine&quot;, &quot;The Third Kingdom&quot;, on August 20, 2013, and the third novel, &quot;Severed Souls&quot;, which continues where &quot;The Third Kingdom&quot; ended, on August 5, 2014.

In 2017, a new novel in Sword of Truth Series was released, titled &quot;Death&#x27;s Mistress&quot;. In 2019, Goodkind&#x27;s continuation of the Sword of Truth series was announced, titled &quot;The Scribbly Man&quot;.
==Genre and influences==
Goodkind perceived his novels to be more than just traditional fantasy because of their focus on philosophical and human themes. Goodkind believed that using the fantasy genre allowed him to better tell his stories and better convey the human themes and emotions he desired to share with readers.

On real-world inspiration behind the characters of Richard and Kahlan, Goodkind had this to say: &quot;There were no such people. I created them both. I wanted them to be the kind of people I look up to.&quot;

Goodkind was influenced by the work of Ayn Rand and Objectivist philosophy and Robert Jordan(even if he denies it). Writing about the series in The Atlas Society newsletter, Willam Perry states that Goodkind&#x27;s &quot;characters, plots, and themes...are clearly and directly influenced by Rand&#x27;s work, and the book&#x27;s heroes occasionally invoke Objectivist principles&quot;. Perry notes the Objectivist themes become most obvious in &quot;Faith of the Fallen&quot;, which made the novel controversial among Goodkind&#x27;s fan base; moreover, the novel contains several scenes that echo the plots of Rand&#x27;s books &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (1943) and &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; (1957).

==Personal life and death==
In 1983, Goodkind moved with his wife to a house he built in Maine. In 1993 they built a house on the forested Mount Desert Island off the coast of Maine where he wrote his first book, Wizard&#x27;s First Rule. Later, they made their home on the coast of Lake Las Vegas, Nevada, their primary residence.

Goodkind competed in various forms of amateur and semi-professional auto racing, and drove a Radical SR8 SM-500 race car for his own Rahl Racing team.

Goodkind died on September 17, 2020, at his home in Boulder City, Nevada. The cause of death was not released. Terry is survived by his wife Jeri.

On July 24, 2006, it was announced that the Sword of Truth book series would be adapted as a television mini-series produced by Sam Raimi and Joshua Donen. The series was ultimately dubbed &quot;Legend of the Seeker&quot;, in order to differentiate it from the novels and allow an episodic format of self-contained stories that moved beyond the first book. Raimi, Robert Tapert, Ken Biller, and Ned Nalle served as executive producers for the series, distributed by ABC Studios. The first episode aired in syndication on November 1, 2008, and the show lasted for two seasons until its cancellation in May 2010.

<doc id="81854" wikidata="Q190404" url="?curid=81854" title="Central venous catheter">
<text>A central venous catheter (CVC), also known as a central line (c-line), central venous line, or central venous access catheter, is a catheter placed into a large vein. It is a form of venous access. Placement of larger catheters in more centrally located veins is often needed in critically ill patients, or in those requiring prolonged intravenous therapies, for more reliable vascular access. These catheters are commonly placed in veins in the neck (internal jugular vein), chest (subclavian vein or axillary vein), groin (femoral vein), or through veins in the arms (also known as a PICC line, or peripherally inserted central catheters).

Central lines are used to administer medication or fluids that are unable to be taken by mouth or would harm a smaller peripheral vein, obtain blood tests (specifically the &quot;central venous oxygen saturation&quot;), administer fluid or blood products for large volume resuscitation, and measure central venous pressure. The catheters used are commonly 15–30 cm in length, made of silicone or polyurethane, and have single or multiple lumens for infusion.

==Medical uses==
The following are the major indications for the use of central venous catheters:

# Difficult peripheral venous access – central venous catheters may be placed when it is difficult to gain or maintain venous access peripherally (e.g. obesity, scarred veins from prior cannulations, agitated patient).
# Delivery of certain medications or fluids – medications such as vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine, vasopressin, phenylephrine etc.), chemotherapeutic agents, or hypertonic solutions are damaging to peripheral veins and often require placement of a central line. Additionally, catheters with multiple lumens can facilitate the delivery of several parenteral medications simultaneously.
# Prolonged intravenous therapies – parenteral medications that must be delivered for extended periods of time (more than a few days) such as long-term parenteral nutrition, or intravenous antibiotics are administered through a central line. 
# Specialized treatment – interventions such as hemodialysis, plasmapheresis, transvenous cardiac pacing, and invasive hemodynamic monitoring (e.g. pulmonary artery catheterization) require central venous access.

There are no absolute contraindications to the use of central venous catheters. Relative contraindications include: coagulopathy, trauma or local infection at the placement site, or suspected proximal vascular injury. However, there are risks and complications associated with the placement of central lines, which are addressed below.

==Complications==
Central line insertion may cause several complications. The benefit expected from their use should outweigh the risk of those complications.

===Pneumothorax===
The incidence of pneumothorax is highest with subclavian vein catheterization due to its anatomic proximity to the apex of the lung. In the case of catheterization of the internal jugular vein, the risk of pneumothorax is minimized by the use of ultrasound guidance. For experienced clinicians, the incidence of pneumothorax is about 1.5–3.1%. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK) and other medical organizations recommend the routine use of ultrasonography to minimize complications.

If a pneumothorax is suspected, an upright chest x-ray should be obtained. An upright chest x-ray is preferred because free air will migrate to the apex of the lung, where it is easily visualized. Of course, this is not always possible, particularly in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. Radiographs obtained in the supine position fail to detect 25–50% of pneumothoraces. Instead, bedside ultrasound is a superior method of detection in those too ill to obtain upright imaging.

=== Vascular perforation ===
Perforation of vasculature by a catheter is a feared and potentially life-threatening complication of central lines. Fortunately, the incidence of these events is exceedingly rare, especially when lines are placed with ultrasound guidance. Accidental cannulation of the carotid artery is a potential complication of placing a central line in the internal jugular vein. This occurs at a rate of approximately 1% when ultrasound guidance is used. However, it has a reported incidence of 0.5–11% when an anatomical approach is used. If the carotid is accidentally cannulated and a catheter is inserted into the artery, the catheter should be left in place and a vascular surgeon should be notified because removing it can be fatal.

===Catheter-related bloodstream infections===
All catheters can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream. This can result in serious infections that can be fatal in up to 25% of cases. The problem of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) has gained increasing attention in recent years. They cause a great deal of morbidity (harm) and deaths, and increase health care costs. Those who have a CLABSI have a 2.75 times increased risk of dying compared to those who do not. CLABSI is also associated with longer intensive care unit and hospital stays, at 2.5 and 7.5 days respectively when other illness related factors are adjusted for. 

Microbes can gain access to the bloodstream via a central catheter a number of ways. Rarely, they are introduced by contaminated infusions. They might also gain access to the lumen of the catheter through break points such as hubs. However, the method by which most organisms gain access is by migrating from the skin along the portion of the catheter tracking through subcutaneous tissue until they reach the portion of the catheter in the vein. Additionally, bacteria present in the blood may attach to the surface of the catheter, transforming it into a focus of infection.

If a central line infection is suspected in a person, blood cultures are taken from both the catheter and a vein elsewhere in the body. If the culture from the central line grows bacteria much earlier (&gt;2 hours) than the other vein site, the line is likely infected. Quantitative blood culture is even more accurate, but this method is not widely available.

Antibiotics are nearly always given as soon as a patient is suspected to have a catheter-related bloodstream infection. However, this must occur after blood cultures are drawn, otherwise the culprit organism may not be identified. The most common organisms causing these infections are coagulase negative staphylococci such as &quot;staphylococcus epidermidis&quot;. Infections resulting in bacteremia from &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; require removal of the catheter and antibiotics. If the catheter is removed without giving antibiotics, 38% of people may still develop endocarditis. Evidence suggests that there may not be any benefit associated with giving antibiotics before a long-term central venous catherter is inserted in cancer patients and this practice may not prevent gram positive catheter-related infections. However, for people who require long-term central venous catheters who are at a higher risk of infection, for example, people with cancer who at are risk of neutropenia due to their chemotherapy treatment or due to the disease, flushing the catheter with a solution containing an antibiotic and heparin may reduce catheter-related infections.

In a clinical practice guideline, the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends against routine culturing of central venous lines upon their removal. The guideline makes several other recommendations to prevent line infections.

To prevent infection, stringent cleaning of the catheter insertion site is advised. Povidone-iodine solution is often used for such cleaning, but chlorhexidine appears to be twice as effective as iodine. Routine replacement of lines makes no difference in preventing infection. The CDC makes many recommendations regarding risk reduction for infection of CVCs, including:

* The preferred site of insertion (including for non-tunneled catheter placement), from an infection prevention point of view, is in the subclavian vein, and to generally avoid the femoral vein if possible.
* There is no clear recommendation for a tunneled catheter site in the guidelines.
* Selection of catheters should include those with minimal ports to accomplish the clinical goal.
* Sterile gloves are required for CVC
* Full body sterile drapes, cap, mask, gloves are required for placement of CVCs
* The catheter site should be monitored visually and with palpation (through dressing) on a regular basis to assess for infection.
* It is, however, acceptable to use clean, non-sterile, gloves for changing the dressing of intravascular catheters.
* Both chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine are acceptable skin cleansers, though chlorhexidine is preferred.
* For short-term CVC sites, dressings must be changed at least every 7 days for transparent dressings, and every 2 days for gauze dressings.
* For long-term implanted or tunneled catheters, dressings are to be changed no more than once weekly unless soiled or loose.
*Routine removal and replacement of a central venous catheter is not recommended. While central line catheters should be removed as soon as they are no longer necessary, scheduled removal and replacement, whether over a guidewire or with a new puncture site, has not been shown to be beneficial in preventing infections.
*Medication impregnated dressing products can reduce the risk getting catheter-related blood stream infection.
*There is inconclusive evidence whether longer interval of changing dressings for central venous access devices is associated with more or less infections.
*It is unclear whether cleaning the skin with antiseptics or without skin cleansing can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections. The lack of clarity is due to the low quality of some of the studies used in the meta-analysis.

Using checklists, which detail the step by step process (including sterile techniques) of catheter placement has been shown to reduce catheter related bloodstream infections. This is often done with an observer reviewing the checklist as the operator places the central catheter. Having central line catheter kits (or a central line cart), which carry all of the necessary equipment needed for placing the central venous catheter, has also been shown to reduce central line related bloodstream infections.

Patient specific risk factors for the development of catheter-related bloodstream infections include placing or maintaining a central catheter in those who are immunocompromised, neutropenic, malnourished, have severe burns, have a body mass index greater than 40 (obesity) or if a person has a prolonged hospital stay before catheter insertion. Premature infants also have a greater risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections as compared to those born at term. Provider factors that increase the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections include inserting the catheter under emergency conditions, not adhering to sterile technique, multiple manipulations of the catheter or hub, and maintaining the catheter for longer than is indicated.

===Occlusion===

Venous catheters may occasionally become occluded by kinks in the catheter, backwash of blood into the catheter leading to thrombosis, or infusion of insoluble materials that form precipitates. However, thrombosis is the most common cause of central line occlusion, occurring in up to 25% of catheters.

CVCs are a risk factor for forming blood clots (venous thrombosis) including upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. It is thought this risk stems from activation of clotting substances in the blood by trauma to the vein during placement. The risk of blood clots is higher in a person with cancer, as cancer is also a risk factor for blood clots. As many as two thirds of cancer patients with central lines show evidence of catheter-associated thrombosis. However, most cases (more than 95%) of catheter-associated thrombosis go undetected. Most symptomatic cases are seen with placement of femoral vein catheters (3.4%) or peripherally inserted central catheters (3%). Anti-clotting drugs such as heparin and fondaparinux have been shown to decrease the incidence of blood clots, specifically deep vein thrombosis, in a person with cancer with central lines. Additionally, studies suggest that short term use of CVCs in the subclavian vein is less likely to be associated with blood clots than CVCs placed in the femoral vein in non-cancer patients.

In the case of non-thrombotic occlusion (e.g. formation of precipitates), dilute acid can be used to restore patency to the catheter. A solution of 0.1N hydrochloric acid is commonly used. Infusates that contain a significant amount of lipids such as total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or propofol are also prone to occlusion over time. In this setting, patency can often be restored by infusing a small amount of 70% ethanol.

===Misplacement===
CVC misplacement is more common when the anatomy of the person is different or difficult due to injury or past surgery.

CVCs can be mistakenly placed in an artery during insertion (for example, the carotid artery or vertebral artery when placed in the neck or common femoral artery when placed in the groin). This error can be quickly identified by special tubing that can show the pressure of the catheter (arteries have a higher pressure than veins). In addition, sending blood samples for acidity, oxygen, and carbon dioxide content (pH, pO2, pCO2 respectively) &quot;(l.e.: blood-gas analysis)&quot; can show the characteristics of an artery (higher pH/pO2, lower pCO2) or vein (lower pH/pO2, higher pCO2).

During subclavian vein central line placement, the catheter can be accidentally pushed into the internal jugular vein on the same side instead of the superior vena cava. A chest x-ray is performed after insertion to rule out this possibility. The tip of the catheter can also be misdirected into the contralateral (opposite side) subclavian vein in the neck, rather than into the superior vena cava.

===Venous air embolism===
Entry of air into venous circulation has the potential to cause a venous air embolism. This is a rare complication of CVC placement – however, it can be lethal. The volume and the rate of air entry determine the effect an air embolus will have on a patient. This process can become fatal when at least 200–300 milliliters of air is introduced within a few seconds. The consequences of this include: acute embolic stroke (from air that passes through a patent foramen ovale), pulmonary edema, and acute right heart failure (from trapped air in the right ventricle) which can lead to cardiogenic shock.

The clinical presentation of a venous air embolism may be silent. In those who are symptomatic, the most common symptoms are sudden-onset shortness of breath and cough. If the presentation is severe, the patient may become rapidly hypotensive and have an altered level of consciousness due to cardiogenic shock. Symptoms of an acute stroke may also be seen. Echocardiography can be used to visualize air that has become trapped in the chambers of the heart. If a large air embolism is suspected, a syringe can be attached to the catheter cap and pulled pack in an attempt to remove the air from circulation. The patient can also be placed in the left lateral decubitus position. It is thought that this position helps relieve air that has become trapped in the right ventricle.

=== Catheter-related thrombosis ===
Catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) is the development of a blood clot related to long-term use of CVCs. It mostly occurs in the upper extremities and can lead to further complications, such as pulmonary embolism, post-thrombotic syndrome, and vascular compromise. Symptoms include pain, tenderness to palpation, swelling, edema, warmth, erythema, and development of collateral vessels in the surrounding area. However, most CRTs are asymptomatic, and prior catheter infections increase the risk for developing a CRT. Routine flushings may help to prevent catheter thrombosis. If there is catheter obstruction, thrombolytic drugs can be used if the obstruction is caused by clots or fibrin deposition. Anticoagulant treatment is indicated if the obstruction is caused by thrombus formation. There is inadequate evidence whether heparin saline flush is better than normal saline flush to maintain central venous catheter patency and prevent occlusion.

==Insertion==

Before insertion, the patient is first assessed by reviewing relevant labs and indication for CVC placement, in order to minimize risks and complications of the procedure. Next, the area of skin over the planned insertion site is cleaned. A local anesthetic is applied if necessary. The location of the vein is identified by landmarks or with the use of a small ultrasound device. A hollow needle is advanced through the skin until blood is aspirated. The color of the blood and the rate of its flow help distinguish it from arterial blood (suggesting that an artery has been accidentally punctured). Within North America and Europe, ultrasound use now represents the gold standard for central venous access and skills, with diminishing use of landmark techniques. Recent evidence shows that ultrasound-guidance for subclavian vein catheterization leads to a reduction in adverse events.

The line is then inserted using the Seldinger technique: a blunt guidewire is passed through the needle, then the needle is removed. A dilating device may be passed over the guidewire to expand the tract. Finally, the central line itself is then passed over the guidewire, which is then removed. All the lumens of the line are aspirated (to ensure that they are all positioned inside the vein) and flushed with either saline or heparin. A chest X-ray may be performed afterwards to confirm that the line is positioned inside the superior vena cava and no pneumothorax was caused inadvertently. On anteroposterior X-rays, a catheter tip between 55 and 29 mm below the level of the carina is regarded as acceptable placement. Electromagnetic tracking can be used to verify tip placement and provide guidance during insertion, obviating the need for the X-ray afterwards.

== Catheter flow ==

=== Hagen–Poiseuille equation ===
The Hagen–Poiseuille equation describes the properties of flow through a rigid tube. The equation is shown below:

formula_1

The equation shows that flow rate (Q) through a rigid tube is a function of the inner radius (r), the length of the tube (L), and the viscosity of the fluid (μ). The flow is directly related the fourth power of the inner radius of the tube, and inversely related to the length of the tube and viscosity of the fluid. This equation can be used to understand the following vital observations regarding venous catheters: that the inner radius of a catheter has a much greater impact on flow rate than catheter length or fluid viscosity, and that for rapid infusion, a shorter, large bore catheter is optimal because it will provide the greatest flow rate.

==Types==

There are several types of central venous catheters; these can be further subdivided by site (where the catheter is inserted into the body) as well as the specific type of catheter used.

=== By site ===

==== Percutaneous central venous catheter (CVC) ====
A percutaneous central venous catheter, or CVC, is inserted directly through the skin. The internal or external jugular, subclavian, or femoral vein is used. It is most commonly used in critically ill patients. The CVC can be used for days to weeks, and the patient must remain in the hospital. It is usually held in place with sutures or a manufactured securement device. Commonly used catheters include Quinton catheters.

====Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC)====
A peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC line (pronounced &quot;pick&quot;), is a central venous catheter inserted into a vein in the arm (via the basilic or cephalic veins) rather than a vein in the neck or chest. The basilic vein is usually a better target for cannulation than the cephalic vein because it is larger and runs a straighter course through the arm. The tip of the catheter is positioned in the superior vena cava. PICC lines are smaller in diameter than central lines since they are inserted in smaller peripheral veins, and they are much longer than central venous catheters (50–70 cm vs. 15–30 cm). Therefore, the rate of fluid flow through PICC lines is considerably slower than other central lines, rendering them unsuitable for rapid, large volume fluid resuscitation. PICCs can easily occlude and may not be used with phenytoin. PICC lines may also result in venous thrombosis and stenosis, and should therefore be used cautiously in patients with chronic kidney disease in case an arteriovenous fistula might one day need to be created for hemodialysis.

However, PICC lines are desirable for several reasons. They can provide venous access for up to one year. The patient may go home with a PICC. They avoid the complications of central line placement (e.g. pneumothorax, accidental arterial cannulation), and they are relatively easy to place under ultrasound guidance and cause less discomfort than central lines. PICC lines may be inserted at the bedside, in a home or radiology setting. It is held in place with sutures or a manufactured securement device.

==== Subcutaneous or tunneled central venous catheter ====

Tunneled catheters are passed under the skin from the insertion site to a separate exit site. The catheter and its attachments emerge from underneath the skin. The exit site is typically located in the chest, making the access ports less visible than catheters that protrude directly from the neck. Passing the catheter under the skin helps to prevent infection and provides stability. Insertion is a surgical procedure, in which the catheter is tunneled subcutaneously under the skin in the chest area before it enters the SVC. Commonly used tunneled catheters include Hickman, and Groshong, or Broviac catheters and may be referred to by these names as well.

A tunneled catheter may remain inserted for months to years. These CVCs have a low infection rate due to a Dacron cuff, an antimicrobial cuff surrounding the catheter near the entry site, which is coated in antimicrobial solution and holds the catheter in place after two to three weeks of insertion.

==== Implanted central venous catheter (ICVC, port a cath) ====


An implanted central venous catheter, also called a port a &quot;cath&quot; or &quot;port-a-cath&quot;, is similar to a tunneled catheter, but is left entirely under the skin and is accessible via a port . Medicines are injected through the skin into the catheter. Some implanted ports contain a small reservoir that can be refilled in the same way. After being filled, the reservoir slowly releases the medicine into the bloodstream. Surgically implanted infusion ports are placed below the clavicle (infraclavicular fossa), with the catheter threaded into the heart (right atrium) through a large vein. Once implanted, the port is accessed via a &quot;gripper&quot; non-coring Huber-tipped needle (PowerLoc is one brand, common sizes are length; 19 and 20 gauge. The needle assembly includes a short length of tubing and cannula) inserted directly through the skin. The clinician and patient may elect to apply a topical anesthetic before accessing the port. Ports can be used for medications, chemotherapy, and blood sampling. As ports are located completely under the skin, they are easier to maintain and have a lower risk of infection than CVC or PICC catheters.
An implanted port is less obtrusive than a tunneled catheter or PICC line, requires little daily care, and has less impact on the patient&#x27;s day-to-day activities. Port access requires specialized equipment and training.

Ports are typically used on patients requiring periodic venous access over an extended course of therapy, then flushed regularly until surgically removed.
If venous access is required on a frequent basis over a short period, a catheter having external access is more commonly used.

=== Catheter types ===

==== Triple-lumen catheter ====
The most commonly used catheter for central venous access is the triple lumen catheter. They are preferred (particularly in the ICU) for their three infusion channels that allow for multiple therapies to be administered simultaneously. They are sized using the French scale, with the 7 French size commonly used in adults. These catheters typically have one 16 gauge channel and two 18 gauge channels. Contrary to the French scale, the larger the gauge number, the smaller the catheter diameter. Although these catheters possess one 16 gauge port, the flow is considerably slower than one would expect through a 16 gauge peripheral IV due to the longer length of the central venous catheter (see section on &quot;catheter flow&quot; above). It is important to note that the use of multiple infusion channels does not increase the risk of catheter-related blood stream infections.

==== Hemodialysis catheter ====
Hemodialysis catheters are large diameter catheters (up to 16 French or 5.3mm) capable of flow rates of 200–300 ml/min, which is necessary to maintain the high flow rates of hemodialysis. There are two channels: one is used to carry the patient&#x27;s blood to the dialysis machine, while the other is used to return blood back to the patient. These catheters are typically placed in the internal jugular vein.

==== Introducer sheaths ====
Introducer sheaths are large catheters (8–9 French) that are typically placed to facilitate the passage of temporary vascular devices such as a pulmonary artery catheter or transvenous pacemaker. The introducer sheath is placed first, and the device is then threaded through the sheath and into the vessel. These catheters can also serve as stand-alone devices for rapid infusion given their large diameter and short length. When paired with a pressurized infusion system, flow rates of 850 ml/min have been achieved.

==Routine catheter care==

The catheter is held in place by an adhesive dressing, suture, or staple which is covered by an occlusive dressing. Regular flushing with saline or a heparin-containing solution keeps the line open and prevents blood clots. There is no evidence that heparin is better than saline at preventing blood clots. Certain lines are impregnated with antibiotics, silver-containing substances (specifically silver sulfadiazine) and/or chlorhexidine to reduce infection risk.

Specific types of long-term central lines are the Hickman catheters, which require clamps to make sure that the valve is closed, and Groshong catheters, which have a valve that opens as fluid is withdrawn or infused and remains closed when not in use. Hickman lines also have a &quot;cuff&quot; under the skin, to prevent bacterial migration. The cuff also causes tissue ingrowth into the device for long term securement.

<doc id="81857" wikidata="Q546068" url="?curid=81857" title="Via Maris">
<text>Via Maris, or Way of Horus () was an ancient trade route, dating from the early Bronze Age, linking Egypt with the northern empires of Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia – along the Mediterranean coast of modern-day Egypt, Israel, Turkey and Syria. In Latin, &quot;Via Maris&quot; means &quot;way of the sea&quot;, a translation of the Greek ὁδὸν θαλάσσης found in of the Septuagint, itself a translation of the Hebrew דֶּ֤רֶךְ הַיָּם֙.
It is a historic road that runs in part along the Israeli Mediterranean coast. It was the most important route from Egypt to Syria (the Fertile Crescent) which followed the coastal plain before crossing over into the plain of Jezreel and the Jordan valley. Other names are &quot;Way of the Philistines&quot;, &quot;International Trunk Road&quot; and &quot;International Coastal Highway.&quot;

Together with the King&#x27;s Highway, the &quot;Via Maris&quot; was one of the major trade routes connecting Egypt and the Levant with Anatolia and Mesopotamia. The &quot;Via Maris&quot; was crossed by other trading routes, so that one could travel from Africa to Europe or from Asia to Africa. It began in al-Qantara and went east to Pelusium, following the northern coast of Sinai through el-Arish and Rafah. From there it followed the coast of Canaan through Gaza, Ascalon, Isdud, Aphek avoiding the Yarkon River, and Dor before turning east again through Megiddo and the Jezreel Valley until it reached Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee. Again turning northward along the lake shore, the &quot;Via Maris&quot; passed through Migdal, Capernaum, and Hazor. From Hazor it crossed the northern River Jordan at what later became known as Jacob&#x27;s Ford, then climbed sharply over the Golan Heights and wound its way northeast into Damascus. Here travellers could continue on the King&#x27;s Highway as far as the Euphrates River or proceed northward into Anatolia.

==Name and controversy==
The historic name used in Ancient Egypt was &quot;Way of Horus&quot;. According to Anson Rainey (1981),
&quot;Via Maris&quot; derives from the Latin translation of (in the Hebrew Bible, 8:23) – &quot;by the way of the sea&quot;. The prophet was probably referring to the road from Dan to the sea at Tyre, passing through Abel-beth-maachah, which marked the northern border of Israel at the time of the Assyrian conquest. 

This Egypt-to-Damascus route is designated by Barry J. Beitzel as the Great Trunk Road in &quot;The New Moody Atlas of the Bible &quot;(2009), p. 85. John D. Currid and David P. Barrett use this name in the &quot;ESV Bible Atlas&quot; (2010), p. 41, as do Rainey and Notley in &quot;Carta&#x27;s New Century Handbook and Atlas of the Bible&quot; (2007), p. 76. Carl G. Rasmussen in the &quot;Zondervan Atlas of the Bible &quot;(2010), p. 32, also notes the traditional misnomer and calls the Egypt–Damascus route &quot;the International North-South Route.&quot;

Rasmussen, in agreement with Langfur and Rainey, suggests that the &quot;Via Maris&quot; was the road that connected Tyre with Damascus. Beitzel, in contrast, denotes the Via Maris as a road from Ptolemais (Acco / Acre) to Kedesh (Kedesh-naphtali) in the Galilee – also leading west to east, but slightly further south and not reaching so far inland.

<text>Amoraim ( , singular Amora ; &quot;those who say&quot; or &quot;those who speak over the people&quot;, or &quot;spokesmen&quot;) refers to Jewish scholars of the period from about 200 to 500 CE, who &quot;said&quot; or &quot;told over&quot; the teachings of the Oral Torah. They were primarily located in Babylonia and the Land of Israel. Their legal discussions and debates were eventually codified in the Gemara. The &quot;Amoraim&quot; followed the &quot;Tannaim&quot; in the sequence of ancient Jewish scholars. The &quot;Tannaim&quot; were direct transmitters of uncodified oral tradition; the &quot;Amoraim&quot; expounded upon and clarified the oral law after its initial codification.
== The Amoraic era ==
The first Babylonian &quot;Amoraim&quot; were Abba Arikha, respectfully referred to as &quot;Rav&quot;, and his contemporary and frequent debate partner, Shmuel. Among the earliest &quot;Amoraim&quot; in Israel were Johanan bar Nappaha and Shimon ben Lakish. Traditionally, the Amoraic period is reckoned as seven or eight generations (depending on where one begins and ends). The last &quot;Amoraim&quot; are generally considered to be Ravina I and Rav Ashi, and Ravina II, nephew of Ravina I, who codified the Babylonian Talmud around 500 CE. In total, 761 amoraim are mentioned by name in the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds. 367 of them were active in the land of Israel from around 200–350 CE, while the other 394 lived in Babylonia during 200–500 CE.

In the Talmud itself, the singular &quot;amora&quot; generally refers to a lecturer&#x27;s assistant; the lecturer would state his thoughts briefly, and the &quot;amora&quot; would then repeat them aloud for the public&#x27;s benefit, adding translation and clarification where needed.

<text>James Prescott Joule (; 24 December 1818 11 October 1889) was an English physicist. Joule studied the nature of heat and discovered its relationship to mechanical work. This led to the law of conservation of energy, which in turn led to the development of the first law of thermodynamics. The SI unit of energy, the joule (J), is named after him.

He worked with Lord Kelvin to develop an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale, which came to be called the Kelvin scale. Joule also made observations of magnetostriction, and he found the relationship between the current through a resistor and the heat dissipated, which is also called Joule&#x27;s first law. His experiments about energy transformations were first published in 1843.

==Early years==
James Joule was born in 1818, the son of Benjamin Joule (1784–1858), a wealthy brewer, and his wife, Alice Prescott, on New Bailey Street in Salford. Joule was tutored as a young man by the famous scientist John Dalton and was strongly influenced by chemist William Henry and Manchester engineers Peter Ewart and Eaton Hodgkinson. He was fascinated by electricity, and he and his brother experimented by giving electric shocks to each other and to the family&#x27;s servants.

As an adult, Joule managed the brewery. Science was merely a serious hobby. Sometime around 1840, he started to investigate the feasibility of replacing the brewery&#x27;s steam engines with the newly invented electric motor. His first scientific papers on the subject were contributed to William Sturgeon&#x27;s &quot;Annals of Electricity&quot;. Joule was a member of the London Electrical Society, established by Sturgeon and others.

Motivated in part by a businessman&#x27;s desire to quantify the economics of the choice, and in part by his scientific inquisitiveness, he set out to determine which prime mover was more efficient. He discovered Joule&#x27;s first law in 1841, that &quot;the heat which is evolved by the proper action of any voltaic current is proportional to the square of the intensity of that current, multiplied by the resistance to conduction which it experiences&quot;. He went on to realize that burning a pound of coal in a steam engine was more economical than a costly pound of zinc consumed in an electric battery. Joule captured the output of the alternative methods in terms of a common standard, the ability to raise a mass weighing one pound to a height of one foot, the &quot;foot-pound&quot;.

However, Joule&#x27;s interest diverted from the narrow financial question to that of how much work could be extracted from a given source, leading him to speculate about the convertibility of energy. In 1843 he published results of experiments showing that the heating effect he had quantified in 1841 was due to generation of heat in the conductor and not its transfer from another part of the equipment. This was a direct challenge to the caloric theory which held that heat could neither be created nor destroyed. Caloric theory had dominated thinking in the science of heat since introduced by Antoine Lavoisier in 1783. Lavoisier&#x27;s prestige and the practical success of Sadi Carnot&#x27;s caloric theory of the heat engine since 1824 ensured that the young Joule, working outside either academia or the engineering profession, had a difficult road ahead. Supporters of the caloric theory readily pointed to the symmetry of the Peltier–Seebeck effect to claim that heat and current were convertible in an, at least approximately, reversible process.

==The mechanical equivalent of heat==
Further experiments and measurements with his electric motor led Joule to estimate the &quot;mechanical equivalent of heat&quot; as 4.1868 joules per calorie of work to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one kelvin. He announced his results at a meeting of the chemical section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Cork in August 1843 and was met by silence.

Joule was undaunted and started to seek a purely mechanical demonstration of the conversion of work into heat. By forcing water through a perforated cylinder, he could measure the slight viscous heating of the fluid. He obtained a mechanical equivalent of . The fact that the values obtained both by electrical and purely mechanical means were in agreement to at least two significant digits was, to Joule, compelling evidence of the reality of the convertibility of work into heat.

Joule now tried a third route. He measured the heat generated against the work done in compressing a gas. He obtained a mechanical equivalent of . In many ways, this experiment offered the easiest target for Joule&#x27;s critics but Joule disposed of the anticipated objections by clever experimentation. Joule read his paper to the Royal Society on 20 June 1844, but his paper was rejected for publication by the Royal Society and he had to be content with publishing in the &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot; in 1845. In the paper he was forthright in his rejection of the caloric reasoning of Carnot and Émile Clapeyron, a rejection partly theologically driven:

Joule here adopts the language of &quot;vis viva&quot; (energy), possibly because Hodgkinson had read a review of Ewart&#x27;s &quot;On the measure of moving force&quot; to the Literary and Philosophical Society in April 1844.

In June 1845, Joule read his paper &quot;On the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat&quot; to the British Association meeting in Cambridge. In this work, he reported his best-known experiment, involving the use of a falling weight, in which gravity does the mechanical work, to spin a paddle wheel in an insulated barrel of water which increased the temperature. He now estimated a mechanical equivalent of . He wrote a letter to the Philosophical Magazine, published in September 1845 describing his experiment.

In 1850, Joule published a refined measurement of , closer to twentieth century estimates.

==Reception and priority==
Much of the initial resistance to Joule&#x27;s work stemmed from its dependence upon extremely precise measurements. He claimed to be able to measure temperatures to within of a degree Fahrenheit (3 mK). Such precision was certainly uncommon in contemporary experimental physics but his doubters may have neglected his experience in the art of brewing and his access to its practical technologies. He was also ably supported by scientific instrument-maker John Benjamin Dancer. Joule&#x27;s experiments complemented the theoretical work of Rudolf Clausius, who is considered by some to be the coinventor of the energy concept.

Joule was proposing a kinetic theory of heat (he believed it to be a form of rotational, rather than translational, kinetic energy), and this required a conceptual leap: if heat was a form of molecular motion, why did the motion of the molecules not gradually die out? Joule&#x27;s ideas required one to believe that the collisions of molecules were perfectly elastic. Importantly, the very existence of atoms and molecules was not widely accepted for another 50 years, though the essential work on the existence of molecules, atoms and electrons was underway throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, from that of John Dalton through to Ernest Rutherford. A collection of Dalton’s works was published in 1893, 49 years after his death.

Although it may be hard today to understand the allure of the caloric theory, at the time it seemed to have some clear advantages. Carnot&#x27;s successful theory of heat engines had also been based on the caloric assumption, and only later was it proved by Lord Kelvin that Carnot&#x27;s mathematics were equally valid without assuming a caloric fluid.

However, in Germany, Hermann Helmholtz became aware both of Joule&#x27;s work and the similar 1842 work of Julius Robert von Mayer. Though both men had been neglected since their respective publications, Helmholtz&#x27;s definitive 1847 declaration of the conservation of energy credited them both.

Also in 1847, another of Joule&#x27;s presentations at the British Association in Oxford was attended by George Gabriel Stokes, Michael Faraday, and the precocious and maverick William Thomson, later to become Lord Kelvin, who had just been appointed professor of natural philosophy at the University of Glasgow. Stokes was &quot;inclined to be a Joulite&quot; and Faraday was &quot;much struck with it&quot; though he harboured doubts. Thomson was intrigued but sceptical.

Unanticipated, Thomson and Joule met later that year in Chamonix. Joule married Amelia Grimes on 18 August and the couple went on honeymoon. Marital enthusiasm notwithstanding, Joule and Thomson arranged to attempt an experiment a few days later to measure the temperature difference between the top and bottom of the Cascade de Sallanches waterfall, though this subsequently proved impractical.

Though Thomson felt that Joule&#x27;s results demanded theoretical explanation, he retreated into a spirited defence of the Carnot–Clapeyron school. In his 1848 account of absolute temperature, Thomson wrote that &quot;the conversion of heat (or caloric) into mechanical effect is probably impossible, certainly undiscovered&quot; – but a footnote signalled his first doubts about the caloric theory, referring to Joule&#x27;s &quot;very remarkable discoveries&quot;. Surprisingly, Thomson did not send Joule a copy of his paper but when Joule eventually read it he wrote to Thomson on 6 October, claiming that his studies had demonstrated conversion of heat into work but that he was planning further experiments. Thomson replied on the 27th, revealing that he was planning his own experiments and hoping for a reconciliation of their two views. Though Thomson conducted no new experiments, over the next two years he became increasingly dissatisfied with Carnot&#x27;s theory and convinced of Joule&#x27;s. In his 1851 paper, Thomson was willing to go no further than a compromise and declared &quot;the whole theory of the motive power of heat is founded on two propositions, due respectively to Joule, and to Carnot and Clausius&quot;.

As soon as Joule read the paper he wrote to Thomson with his comments and questions. Thus began a fruitful, though largely epistolary, collaboration between the two men, Joule conducting experiments, Thomson analysing the results and suggesting further experiments. The collaboration lasted from 1852 to 1856, its discoveries including the Joule–Thomson effect, and the published results did much to bring about general acceptance of Joule&#x27;s work and the kinetic theory.

==Kinetic theory==

Kinetics is the science of motion. Joule was a pupil of Dalton and it is no surprise that he had learned a firm belief in the atomic theory, even though there were many scientists of his time who were still skeptical. He had also been one of the few people receptive to the neglected work of John Herapath on the kinetic theory of gases. He was further profoundly influenced by Peter Ewart&#x27;s 1813 paper &quot;On the measure of moving force&quot;.

Joule perceived the relationship between his discoveries and the kinetic theory of heat. His laboratory notebooks reveal that he believed heat to be a form of rotational, rather than translational motion.

Joule could not resist finding antecedents of his views in Francis Bacon, Sir Isaac Newton, John Locke, Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford) and Sir Humphry Davy. Though such views are justified, Joule went on to estimate a value for the mechanical equivalent of heat of 1,034 foot-pound from Rumford&#x27;s publications. Some modern writers have criticised this approach on the grounds that Rumford&#x27;s experiments in no way represented systematic quantitative measurements. In one of his personal notes, Joule contends that Mayer&#x27;s measurement was no more accurate than Rumford&#x27;s, perhaps in the hope that Mayer had not anticipated his own work.

Joule has been attributed with explaining the sunset green flash phenomenon in a letter to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1869; actually, he merely noted (with a sketch) the last glimpse as bluish green, without attempting to explain the cause of the phenomenon.

==Honours==

Joule died at home in Sale and is buried in Brooklands cemetery there. His gravestone is inscribed with the number &quot;772.55&quot;, his climacteric 1878 measurement of the mechanical equivalent of heat, in which he found that this amount of foot-pounds of work must be expended at sea level to raise the temperature of one pound of water from to . There is also a quotation from the Gospel of John: &quot;I must work the work of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work&quot;. The Wetherspoons pub in Sale, the town of his death, is named &quot;The J. P. Joule&quot; after him.

Joule&#x27;s many honours and commendations include:

There is a memorial to Joule in the north choir aisle of Westminster Abbey, though he is not buried there, contrary to what some biographies state. A statue of Joule by Alfred Gilbert stands in Manchester Town Hall, opposite that of Dalton.

==Family==

Joule married Amelia Grimes in 1847. She died in 1854, seven years after their wedding. They had three children together: a son, Benjamin Arthur Joule (1850–1922), a daughter, Alice Amelia (1852–1899), and a second son, Joe (born 1854, died three weeks later).

<text>Thomas Savery (; c. 1650 – 15 May 1715) was an English inventor and engineer. He invented the first commercially used steam-powered device, a steam pump which is often referred to as the &quot;Savery engine&quot;. Savery&#x27;s steam pump was a revolutionary method of pumping water, which improved mine drainage and made widespread public water supply practicable.

== Career ==

Thomas Savery was born at the manor house of Shilstone, near Modbury, Devon. He became a military engineer, rising to the rank of captain by 1702, and spent his free time performing experiments in mechanics. In 1696 he took out a patent for a machine for polishing glass or marble and another for &quot;rowing of ships with greater ease and expedition than hitherto been done by any other&quot; which involved paddle-wheels driven by a capstan and which was dismissed by the Admiralty following a negative report by the Surveyor of the Navy, Edmund Dummer.

Savery also worked for the Sick and Hurt Commissioners, contracting the supply of medicines to the Navy Stock Company, which was connected with the Society of Apothecaries. His duties on their behalf took him to Dartmouth, Devon, which is probably how he came into contact with Thomas Newcomen.

=== Steam-powered pump ===
On 2 July 1698 Savery patented a steam-powered pump, &quot;A new invention for raising of water and occasioning motion to all sorts of mill work by the impellent force of fire, which will be of great use and advantage for draining mines, serving towns with water, and for the working of all sorts of mills where they have not the benefit of water nor constant winds.&quot; It was referred to as the &quot;Savery engine&quot; following contemporary use of the word &quot;engine&quot; to mean any device or contrivance. He demonstrated it to the Royal Society on 14 June 1699. The patent had no illustrations or even description, but in 1702 Savery described the machine in his book &quot;The Miner&#x27;s Friend; or, An Engine to Raise Water by Fire&quot;, in which he claimed that it could pump water out of mines.
Savery&#x27;s was a pistonless pump with no moving parts except from the taps. It was operated by first raising steam in the boiler; the steam was then admitted to one of the first working vessels, allowing it to blow out through a downpipe into the water that was to be raised. When the system was hot and therefore full of steam the tap between the boiler and the working vessel was shut, and if necessary the outside of the vessel was cooled. This made the steam inside it condense, creating a partial vacuum, and atmospheric pressure pushed water up the downpipe until the vessel was full. At this point the tap below the vessel was closed, and the tap between it and the up-pipe opened, and more steam was admitted from the boiler. As the steam pressure built up, it forced the water from the vessel up the up-pipe to the top of the mine.
However, his pump had four serious problems. First, every time water was admitted to the working vessel much of the heat was wasted in warming up the water that was being pumped. Second, the next stage of the process required high-pressure steam to force the water up, and the pump&#x27;s soldered joints were barely capable of withstanding high pressure steam and needed frequent repair. Third, although this pump used positive steam pressure to push water up out (with no theoretical limit to the height to which water could be lifted by a single high-pressure pump) practical and safety considerations meant that in practice, to clear water from a deep mine would have needed a series of moderate-pressure pumps all the way from the bottom level to the surface. Fourth, water was pushed up into the pump only by atmospheric pressure (working against a condensed-steam &#x27;vacuum&#x27;), so the pump had to be no more than about above the water level – requiring it to be installed, operated, and maintained far down in the dark mines all over.

=== Fire Engine Act ===
Savery&#x27;s original patent of July 1698 gave 14 years&#x27; protection; the next year, 1699, an Act of Parliament was passed which extended his protection for a further 21 years. This act &quot;Encouraging Thomas Savery&#x27;s invention for raising water and relating to all sorts of mill work&quot; became known as the &quot;Fire Engine Act&quot;. Savery&#x27;s very broad patent covered all pumps that raised water by fire.

The architect James Smith of Whitehill acquired the rights to use Savery&#x27;s pump in Scotland. In 1699, he entered into an agreement with the inventor, and in 1701 he secured a patent from the Parliament of Scotland, modelled on Savery&#x27;s grant in England, and designed to run for the same period of time. Smith described the machine as &quot;an engine or invention for raising of water and occasioning motion of mill-work by the force of fire&quot;, and he claimed to have modified it to pump from a depth of 14 fathoms, or 84 feet.

In England, Savery&#x27;s patent meant that Thomas Newcomen was forced to go into partnership with him. By 1712, arrangements had been made between the two men to develop Newcomen&#x27;s more advanced design of steam engine, which was marketed under Savery&#x27;s patent, adding water tanks and pump rods so that deeper water mines could be accessed with steam power. Newcomen&#x27;s engine worked purely by atmospheric pressure, thereby avoiding the dangers of high-pressure steam, and used the piston concept invented in 1690 by the Frenchman Denis Papin to produce the first steam engine capable of raising water from deep mines.

When Papin was back to London in 1707, he was asked by Isaac Newton, new President of the Royal Society after Robert Boyle, Papin&#x27;s friend, to work with Savery, who worked for five years with Papin, but never gave any credit nor revenue to the French scientist.

After his death in 1715 Savery&#x27;s patent and Act of Parliament became vested in a company, &quot;The Proprietors of the Invention for Raising Water by Fire&quot;. This company issued licences to others for the building and operation of Newcomen engines, charging as much as £420 per year patent royalties for the construction of steam engines. In one case a colliery paid the Proprietors £200 per year and half their net profits &quot;in return for their services in keeping the engine going&quot;.

The Fire Engine Act did not expire until 1733, four years after the death of Newcomen.

=== Application of the steam pump ===
A newspaper in March 1702 announced that Savery&#x27;s pumps were ready for use and might be seen on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons at his workhouse in Salisbury Court, London, over against the Old Playhouse.

One of his pumps was set up at York Buildings in London. According to later descriptions this produced steam &#x27;eight or ten times stronger than common air&#x27; (i.e. 8–10 atmospheres), but blew open the joints of the machine, forcing him to solder the joints with spelter.

Another was built to control the water supply at Hampton Court, while another at Campden House in Kensington operated for 18 years.

A few Savery pumps were tried in mines, an unsuccessful attempt being made to use one to clear water from a pool called Broad Waters in Wednesbury (then in Staffordshire) and nearby coal mines. This had been covered by a sudden eruption of water some years before. However the pump could not be &#x27;brought to answer&#x27;. The quantity of steam raised was so great as &#x27;rent the whole machine to pieces&#x27;. The steam pump was laid aside, and the scheme for raising water was dropped as impracticable. This may have been in about 1705.

Another pump was proposed in 1706 by George Sparrow at Newbold near Chesterfield, where a landowner was having difficulty in obtaining the consent of his neighbours for a sough (an underground channel) to drain his coal. Nothing came of this, perhaps due to the explosion of the Broad Waters pump. It is also possible that a steam pump was tried at Wheal Vor, a copper mine in Cornwall.

==Comparison with Newcomen steam engine==
The Savery steam pump was much lower in capital cost than the Newcomen steam engine, with a 2 to 4 horsepower Savery pump costing from 150–200 GBP. It was also available in small sizes, down to one horsepower. Newcomen steam engines were larger and much more expensive. The larger size was due to the fact that piston steam engines became very inefficient in small sizes, at least until around 1900 when 2 horsepower piston engines were available. Savery-type pumps continued to be produced well into the late 18th century.

== Inspiration for later work ==
Several later pumping systems may be based on Savery&#x27;s pump. For example, the twin-chamber pulsometer steam pump was a successful development of it.

<text>Denis Papin FRS (; 22 August 1647 – 26 August 1713) was a French physicist, mathematician and inventor, best known for his pioneering invention of the steam digester, the forerunner of the pressure cooker, the steam engine, the centrifugal pump, submersible and possibly the paddlesteamer (1707).

==Early life and education==
Born in Chitenay (Loir-et-Cher, Centre-Val de Loire Région), Papin attended a Jesuit school there. In 1661, he attended the University of Angers, from which he graduated with a medical degree in 1669.

==Career==
In 1673, Papin worked with Christiaan Huygens and Gottfried Leibniz in Paris, and became interested in using a vacuum to generate motive power.

In 1675, he first visited London, where he worked with Robert Boyle from 1676 to 1679, publishing an account of his work in &quot;Continuation of New Experiments&quot; (1680). During this period, Papin invented the &quot;steam digester,&quot; a type of pressure cooker with a safety valve. He first addressed the Royal Society in 1679 on the subject of his digester, and remained mostly in London. As a Huguenot, Papin found himself greatly affected by the increasing restrictions placed on Protestants by Louis XIV of France and by the King&#x27;s ultimate revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685.

In Germany, he was able to live with fellow Huguenot exiles from France, so in about 1687, he left to take up an academic post in Germany.

In 1689, Papin suggested that a force pump or bellows could maintain the pressure and fresh air inside a diving bell. (Engineer John Smeaton utilised this design in 1789.)

While in Marburg in 1690, having observed the mechanical power of atmospheric pressure on his &#x27;digester&#x27;, Papin built a model of a piston steam engine, the first of its kind. In 1705 while teaching mathematics at the University of Marburg, he developed a second steam engine with the help of Gottfried Leibniz, based on an invention by Thomas Savery, but this used steam pressure rather than atmospheric pressure. Details of the engine were published in 1707.

In 1705, Papin constructed a ship powered by hand-cranked paddles. An apocryphal story originating in 1851 by Louis Figuire held that this ship was steam-powered rather than hand-powered and that it was therefore the first steam-powered vehicle of any kind. The myth was refuted as early as 1880 by , though still it finds credulous expression in some contemporary scholarly work.

Papin&#x27;s ship was said to have been destroyed in 1707 by the boatmen of Munden who feared it would threaten their livelihood. The scene of boatmen destroying Papin&#x27;s ship is depicted in several pieces of art in the eighteenth century and serves as an example of the resistance and fear inspired by the creative destruction that accompanies new technology.

Later, at the iron foundry in Veckerhagen (now Reinhardshagen), he cast the world&#x27;s first steam cylinder.

In 1707, Papin returned to London leaving his wife in Germany. Several of his papers were put before the Royal Society between 1707 and 1712 without acknowledging or paying him, about which he complained bitterly. Papin&#x27;s ideas included a description of his 1690 atmospheric steam engine, similar to that built and put into use by Thomas Newcomen in 1712, thought to be the year of Papin&#x27;s death.

==Death==
The last surviving evidence of Papin&#x27;s whereabouts came in a letter he wrote dated 23 January 1712. At the time he was destitute (&quot;I am in a sad case&quot;) [Royal Society Archives, 1894, Vol. 7, 74], and it was believed that he died that year and was buried in an unmarked grave in London.

However, a record exists for the burial of a “Denys Papin” in an 18th-century Register of Marriages &amp; Burials which originally came from St Bride&#x27;s Church, Fleet Street, London, but which is stored in the London Metropolitan Archives. The record states that Denys Papin was buried at St Bride&#x27;s on 26 August 1713 – just a few days after his 66th birthday – and that he was buried in the Lower Ground, one of the two burial areas belonging to the church at the time. Since the discovery, in 2016, of the place and date of Papin&#x27;s burial in 1713, a memorial plaque has been erected in the West Entrance of St Bride&#x27;s Church, Fleet Street, London, to commemorate his life and his achievements.
==Legacy==
Boulevard Denis Papin in Carcassonne is named after him as well as a street in Saint-Michel, Montreal. There is also a statue of Papin with his invention in Blois, at the top of the Escalier Denis Papin, a stairway.

<text>In mathematics, two sequences of numbers, often experimental data, are proportional or directly proportional if their corresponding elements have a constant ratio. The ratio is called coefficient of proportionality (or proportionality constant) and its reciprocal is known as constant of normalization (or normalizing constant). Two sequences are inversely proportional if corresponding elements have a constant product, also called the coefficient of proportionality.

This definition is commonly extended to related varying quantities, which are often called &quot;variables&quot;. This meaning of &quot;variable&quot; is not the common meaning of the term in mathematics (see variable (mathematics)); these two different concepts share the same name for historical reasons.

Two functions formula_1 and formula_2 are &quot;proportional&quot; if their ratio formula_3 is a constant function.

If several pairs of variables share the same direct proportionality constant, the equation expressing the equality of these ratios is called a proportion, e.g., (for details see Ratio).
Proportionality is closely related to &quot;linearity&quot;.

== Direct proportionality ==

Given an independent variable &quot;x&quot; and a dependent variable &quot;y&quot;, &quot;y&quot; is directly proportional to &quot;x&quot; if there is a positive constant &quot;k&quot; such that:

: formula_4

The relation is often denoted using the symbols &quot;∝&quot; (not to be confused with the Greek letter alpha) or &quot;~&quot;, with exception of Japanese texts, where &quot;~&quot; is reserved for intervals:
: formula_5 (or formula_6)

For formula_7 the proportionality constant can be expressed as the ratio:

: formula_8

It is also called the constant of variation or constant of proportionality. 
Given such a constant &quot;k&quot;, the proportionality relation ∝ with proportionality constant &quot;k&quot; between two sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; is the equivalence relation defined by formula_9

A direct proportionality can also be viewed as a linear equation in two variables with a &quot;y&quot;-intercept of and a slope of &quot;k&quot; &gt; 0, which corresponds to linear growth.

=== Examples ===
* If an object travels at a constant speed, then the distance traveled is directly proportional to the time spent traveling, with the speed being the constant of proportionality.
* The circumference of a circle is directly proportional to its diameter, with the constant of proportionality equal to .
* On a map of a sufficiently small geographical area, drawn to scale distances, the distance between any two points on the map is directly proportional to the beeline distance between the two locations represented by those points; the constant of proportionality is the scale of the map.
* The force, acting on a small object with small mass by a nearby large extended mass due to gravity, is directly proportional to the object&#x27;s mass; the constant of proportionality between the force and the mass is known as gravitational acceleration.
* The net force acting on an object is proportional to the acceleration of that object with respect to an inertial frame of reference. The constant of proportionality in this, Newton&#x27;s second law, is the classical mass of the object.

== Inverse proportionality ==
Two variables are inversely proportional (also called varying inversely, in inverse variation, in inverse proportion) if each of the variables is directly proportional to the multiplicative inverse (reciprocal) of the other, or equivalently if their product is a constant. It follows that the variable &quot;y&quot; is inversely proportional to the variable &quot;x&quot; if there exists a non-zero constant &quot;k&quot; such that
: formula_10
or equivalently, formula_11. Hence the constant &quot;k&quot; is the product of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

The graph of two variables varying inversely on the Cartesian coordinate plane is a rectangular hyperbola. The product of the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; values of each point on the curve equals the constant of proportionality (&quot;k&quot;). Since neither &quot;x&quot; nor &quot;y&quot; can equal zero (because &quot;k&quot; is non-zero), the graph never crosses either axis.

Direct and inverse proportion contrast as follows: in direct proportion the variables increase or decrease together. With inverse proportion, an increase in one variable is associated with a decrease in the other. For instance, in travel, a constant speed dictates a direct proportion between distance and time travelled; in contrast, for a given distance (the constant), the time of travel is inversely proportional to speed: &quot;s&quot; × &quot;t&quot; = &quot;d&quot;.

== Hyperbolic coordinates ==

The concepts of &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;inverse&quot; proportion lead to the location of points in the Cartesian plane by hyperbolic coordinates; the two coordinates correspond to the constant of direct proportionality that specifies a point as being on a particular ray and the constant of inverse proportionality that specifies a point as being on a particular hyperbola.

<text>The Château de Rambouillet (), also known in English as the Castle of Rambouillet, is a château in the town of Rambouillet, Yvelines department, in the region in northern France, southwest of Paris. It was the summer residence of the Presidents of France from 1896 until 2009, and it is now managed by the .

==History==
The château was originally a fortified manor dating back to 1368 and, although amputated of its eastern wing at the time of Napoleon, it still retains its pentagonal bastioned footprint. King Francis I died there, on 31 March 1547, probably in the imposing medieval tower that bears his name. Like the Hôtel de Rambouillet in Paris, the château was owned by Charles d&#x27;Angennes, the marquis de Rambouillet during the reign of Louis XIII. Avenues led directly from the park of the château into the adjacent game-rich forest. More than 200 square kilometres of forest remain, the remnant of the Forest of Rambouillet, also known as or .

In 1783, the château became the private property of King Louis XVI, who bought it from his cousin, Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthièvre, as an extension of his hunting grounds. Queen Marie Antoinette, who accompanied her husband on a visit in November 1783, is said to have exclaimed: &quot;&quot; (&quot;How could I live in such a gothic toadhouse!&quot;) However, to induce his wife to like his new acquisition, Louis XVI commissioned in great secret the construction of the renowned , (the Queen&#x27;s dairy), where the buckets were of Sèvres porcelain, painted and grained to imitate wood, and the presiding nymph was a marble Amalthea, with the goat that nurtured Jupiter, sculpted by Pierre Julien. A little salon was attached to the dairy itself, with chairs supplied by Georges Jacob in 1787 that had straight, tapering stop-fluted legs.

During the French Revolution, the domain of Rambouillet became a (&#x27;national property&#x27;), the château being emptied of its furnishings and the gardens and surrounding park falling into neglect.

During the reign of Napoleon I, Rambouillet was included in his (list of government-owned property at the disposal of the head of state). The Emperor came several times to Rambouillet, the last being on the night of 29–30 June 1815, on his way to exile to Saint Helena. Among the reminders of Napoléon are the Pompeian style bathroom with its small bathtub and the exquisite balcony built to link the Emperor&#x27;s apartment to that of his second wife, the Empress Marie-Louise. Another reminder of Napoléon was the splendid , a double-lined bald cypress (&quot;Taxodium distichum&quot;) avenue.

At the time of the Bourbon Restoration, Rambouillet was again included in the royal . Fifteen years after Napoleon I, Charles X&#x27;s road to exile also started at Rambouillet. On 2 August 1830, he signed his abdication here in favour of his nine-year-old grandson, the Duke of Bordeaux. It took twenty minutes to talk his son, Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, into, reluctantly, countersigning the document, thus abandoning his rights to the throne of France in favor of his nephew.

From 1830 to 1848, the domain of Rambouillet, which had belonged to his grandfather, the duke of Penthièvre, was not included in Louis Philippe I&#x27;s ; however, begged to do so by the townspeople, the Emperor Napoléon III, who reigned from 1852 to 1870, requested its inclusion in his.

After the fall of Napoleon III in 1870, which saw the beginning of the French Third Republic, the domain of Rambouillet was leased from 1870 to 1883 to the duke of . In February 1896, Rambouillet received a visit from President Félix Faure who then decided to spend his summers there with his family. Since, the château of Rambouillet has become the summer residence of France&#x27;s presidents of the republic, who entertain, and used to invite to hunting parties many foreign dignitaries, princes and heads of state. As a part-time residence of the French president, it is sometimes referred to as the Palace of Rambouillet.

On 23 August 1944, two days before the liberation of Paris, General Charles de Gaulle arrived at Rambouillet and set up his headquarters in the chateau where, in the evening, he met General Philippe Leclerc who, at the head of his French 2nd Armored Division, was given its mission to liberate Paris. Part of the French 2nd Armored Division was to leave from Rambouillet at dawn the following day, on its march &quot;to capture Paris&quot;. On August 25, around 2 p.m., &quot;both wrought with emotion and filled with serenity&quot;, General de Gaulle left Rambouillet by car to enter &quot;&quot;.

During the 1960s, “Foreign leaders were often put up in the magnificent surroundings of the Château de Rambouillet,” and foreign dignitaries would be invited to shoot birds there in autumn.

In November 1975, the first &quot;G6&quot; summit was organized in the château by French President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing for the heads of the world&#x27;s leading industrialized countries. Attending were: Gerald Ford (United States), Harold Wilson (United Kingdom), Aldo Moro (Italy), Takeo Miki (Japan) and Helmut Schmidt (West Germany).

The Château de Rambouillet continues to be used as a venue for bilateral summits and, in February 1999, was host to the negotiations on Kosovo. (See Kosovo War and Rambouillet Agreement.)

On 26 December 1999, Hurricane Lothar hit the northern half of France, wreaking havoc on forests, parks and buildings. The Forest of Rambouillet lost hundreds of thousands of trees, and among the over 5,000 downed trees in the park of Rambouillet, was the handsome, historical , the bald cypress avenue planted in 1810.

<text>Route 27 is a state highway in New Jersey, United States. It runs from US 206 in Princeton, Mercer County, northeast to an interchange with McCarter Highway (Route 21) and Broad Street in Newark, Essex County. The route passes through many communities along the way, including New Brunswick, Highland Park, Edison, Metuchen, Rahway, and Elizabeth. Route 27 is a two- to four-lane undivided highway for most of its length, passing through a variety of urban and suburban environments. It intersects and interchanges many roads along the way, including Route 18 in New Brunswick, I-287 in Edison, the Garden State Parkway in Woodbridge, Route 35 in Rahway, Route 28 in Elizabeth, and U.S. Route 22 in Newark. Route 27 crosses the Raritan River on the Albany Street Bridge, which connects Highland Park on the east with New Brunswick on the west.

Route 27 was part of the alignment through New Jersey of the Lincoln Highway, the United States&#x27; first transcontinental highway that was established in 1913. Route 27 is still referred to as the Lincoln Highway in many municipalities, such as Edison. The Lincoln Highway became part of pre-1927 Route 1 between New Brunswick and Elizabeth in 1916 and pre-1927 Route 13 between Trenton and New Brunswick in 1917. In 1927, the Lincoln Highway was renumbered as Route 27 between Trenton and Newark. U.S. Route 1 was designated on this portion of the road until it was relocated by the 1940s. U.S. Route 206 followed the route from Trenton to Princeton until 1953, when the southern terminus of Route 27 was cut back to Princeton to avoid the concurrency with US 206.

==Route description==

===Mercer County===

Route 27 begins at a traffic light with US 206 in Downtown Princeton, Mercer County. The route heads northeast along Nassau Street, the main street of Princeton that runs along the northern edge of Princeton University and is lined with numerous shops and restaurants. This portion of Route 27 sees between 10,000 and 20,000 cars a day. Just past the beginning of Route 27, CR 583 heads to the southwest on Mercer Street. Route 27 moves through downtown Princeton, passing by the main gates to Princeton University near Nassau Hall, and intersecting with Washington Road (CR 526/CR 571). After leaving the downtown area, Route 27 continues through residential areas and the route becomes unnamed. Route 27 runs parallel to Carnegie Lake, then crosses over the Millstone River just north of the historic Kingston Bridge. The portion of the road from Princeton to Kingston is part of the King&#x27;s Highway Historic District.

===Middlesex/Somerset County line===
Upon crossing the Millstone River, Route 27 runs along the border of Franklin Township, Somerset County to the west and South Brunswick, Middlesex County to the east, passing through the historic community of Kingston. It continues northeast through a mix of woodland and residences, intersecting with Promenade Boulevard, which heads east and becomes CR 522 after crossing US 1. Route 27 briefly runs entirely into Somerset County before resuming along the Middlesex/Somerset County line. The route continues north to an intersection of Gateway Boulevard (CR 518), where it resumes its northeast direction and heads into Kendall Park as a variable two- to four-lane road, entering denser suburban development. In Kendall Park, the road passes northwest of a park and ride lot located at a shopping center. Route 27 then passes through Franklin Park, intersecting with Henderson Road (County Route 610) (Henderson Road). Past that intersection, Route 27 forms the border of Franklin Township to the west and North Brunswick to the east, passing through suburban development with some areas of farmland, seeing about 38,487 cars a day. The road forms the border of Franklin Township and New Brunswick upon intersecting with How Lane (CR 680) becoming four-lane Somerset Street. Route 27 follows Somerset Street northeast through residential and commercial areas, passing by the community of Somerset on the west side of the road.

===Middlesex County===

The route splits from Somerset Street and heads entirely into New Brunswick, Middlesex County along French Street. At the intersection of Sandford Street, Route 27 becomes a county-maintained road that is also signed as CR 644. It then intersects with Jersey Avenue (CR 693), which heads to the southwest to become Route 91. Past this intersection, the route becomes a two-lane street that heads into Downtown New Brunswick, south of the main campus of Rutgers University. Here, the route has a daily traffic count of approximately 11,559 vehicles. It crosses under Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor rail line next to the New Brunswick Station serving Amtrak and NJ Transit&#x27;s Northeast Corridor Line. The route turns into a four-lane divided highway and intersects with Easton Avenue (CR 527). At this point, CR 644 ends, with Route 27 forming a brief concurrency with CR 527, heading east along Albany Street as a city-maintained street. About later, the road crosses George Street, which heads to the north as CR 672 and to the south as Route 171. CR 527 splits from Albany Street by heading south on Route 171 while Route 27 continues east. After another , Route 27 intersects with Johnson Drive (CR 514). Route 27 continues along Albany Street as a concurrency with CR 514. It immediately interchanges with Route 18. At the interchange with Route 18, Route 27 becomes state-maintained again, crossing the Raritan River on the Albany Street Bridge into Highland Park.

Upon entering Highland Park, Route 27 becomes two-lane Raritan Avenue, intersecting with River Road (CR 622) and continuing through the downtown area of Highland Park. CR 514 splits from Route 27 by heading east on Woodbridge Avenue later. Route 27 resumes heading northeast past this intersection as a four-lane road that passes by homes, entering Edison, where the name changes to Lincoln Highway. The route continues northeast, intersecting with Suttons Lane/Duclos Lane (CR 676) and Plainfield Avenue (CR 529), then travels through a mix of residences and businesses, briefly becoming a divided highway before interchanging with I-287 at a partial interchange with access to southbound I-287 and from northbound I-287. At this interchange, Route 27 sees approximately 14,386 cars a day. Beyond this interchange, Route 27 crosses into Metuchen and becomes two-lane Essex Avenue, which turns to the east and heads through residential areas. The route turns north onto Lake Avenue and intersects with Amboy Avenue (CR 501). Route 27 forms a concurrency with that route. It passes under the Northeast Corridor and comes to Middlesex Avenue, where CR 501 turns to the left and Route 27 turns to the right to resume its northeast direction.

Route 27 intersects with Main Street (CR 531) after and continues northeast on Middlesex Avenue, passing through a residential environment where the route carries about 22,414 vehicles daily. The road comes to a bridge over Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Port Reading Secondary line. The route crosses back into Edison and becomes Lincoln Highway again, passing over the Rahway River. It heads through business areas and passes near the Thomas Alva Edison Memorial Tower and Museum, which is located on the site of Thomas Edison&#x27;s Menlo Park laboratory. The route closely parallels the Northeast Corridor rail line and crosses into Woodbridge, widening to four lanes at this point. Route 27 passes by the Metropark Station serving Amtrak and NJ Transit trains and interchanges with the Garden State Parkway near Iselin, where approximately 19,780 vehicles travel on Route 27 on a daily basis. Past the Garden State Parkway, Route 27 narrows back to two lanes and continues northeast alongside the Northeast Corridor, passing through a mix of residential and commercial development as a three-lane road with two northbound lanes and one southbound lane.

===Union and Essex counties===
Route 27 crosses into Rahway, Union County and intersects with the northern terminus of Route 35, where that route heads south on St. Georges Avenue. Route 27 continues north using four-lane St. Georges Avenue. The route passes through Rahway, passing by residences and businesses. In Rahway, the route sees about 25,022 cars a day. It continues northeast, intersecting multiple streets, such as West Inman Avenue (CR 602), West Hazelwood Avenue (CR 621), West Milton Avenue (CR 648), and Westfield Avenue/West Grand Avenue (CR 613). The route crosses into Linden when passing the intersection of Stuart Place, where the route heads through a more commercial setting with businesses lining both sides of the road. In Linden, the road intersects with North Stiles Street (CR 615). At the intersection of Wood Avenue (CR 617), Route 27 forms the border of Roselle to the west and Linden to the east, with about 23,081 vehicles using the road on a daily basis The route crosses the inactive Rahway Valley Railroad line that is owned by the Staten Island Railway. It passes by Warinaco Park and forms the border between Elizabeth to the west and Linden to the east before entirely entering Elizabeth at the intersection of Richford Terrace.

In Elizabeth, Route 27 narrows to two lanes and becomes Rahway Avenue, crossing the intersection of South Elmora Avenue (Route 439) and continuing to the northeast through residential and commercial areas. Route 27 splits into a one-way pair with northbound Route 27 following Rahway Avenue east and turning north onto Cherry Street and southbound Route 27 following Westfield Avenue west and turning south onto Chilton Street. The southbound direction of Route 27 intersects with the eastern terminus of Route 28, where that route continues west on Westfield Avenue. Past the one-way pair, Route 27 resumes east on four-lane Westfield Avenue, turning north onto Broad Street. The route heads into a more urbanized setting and continues northeast onto Newark Avenue, intersecting with the northern terminus of Route 439, where that route heads west on North Avenue. Through Elizabeth, about 10,000 to 20,000 vehicles travel on Route 27 every day.

Route 27 crosses into Newark, Essex County at the intersection of Virginia Street, where it becomes Frelinghuysen Avenue, a road that heads north through the Dayton neighborhood of Newark, passing through urban areas and by Weequahic Park. Route 27 interchanges with US 22 and immediately passes under I-78. Route 27 continues north, passing under railroad tracks carrying Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Lehigh Line and NJ Transit&#x27;s Raritan Valley Line and crossing Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Poinier Street Lead line/Irvington-Hillside Industrial Branch at-grade, before it comes to an intersection of Poinier Street, where the route heads east along that road to its northern terminus at an interchange with McCarter Highway (Route 21) and Broad Street.

== History ==
The southern part of Route 27 follows the Lenape Assunpink Trail that during the colonial era was known as the Old Dutch Trail, and later became the Kings Highway. North of Rahway, the road was created as Queen Anne&#x27;s Road, running from Perth Amboy to Elizabethtown Point, with later extensions to Newark and Jersey City. This road would have several names over the following years: it was renamed the King&#x27;s Highway when it was extended by King George to Jersey City, then to the Post Road during the Revolutionary War, then the Old Country Road after, then finally St. Georges Avenue when Rahway was incorporated as a city.

Route 27 follows portions of several 19th-century turnpikes, including the Essex and Middlesex Turnpike, which was chartered on March 3, 1806, to run from New Brunswick to Newark along what is today Route 27, the Northeast Corridor rail line, and Broad Street in Newark, the Georgetown and Franklin Turnpike, chartered on February 15, 1816, to run from Lambertville to New Brunswick along the present-day alignments of CR 518 and Route 27, the Newark and Elizabeth Plank Road, chartered on March 14, 1856, and the Princeton and Kingston Branch Turnpike, chartered on December 3, 1807, to run from Trenton to Kingston along current CR 583 and Route 27. The route became a portion of the Lincoln Highway, the United States&#x27; first transcontinental highway that was established in 1913 to run from New York City to San Francisco. It is still known by that name in a few places along the route, particularly in Edison Township.
In 1916, the Lincoln Highway was legislated as part of pre-1927 Route 1 between New Brunswick and Elizabeth and as pre-1927 Route 13 between Trenton and New Brunswick in 1917. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 27 was designated to run from Trenton to the intersection of Frelinghuysen Avenue and Astor Street in Newark, replacing the portions of Routes 1 and 13 that ran along the Lincoln Highway. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System, U.S. Route 1 was designated along the length of Route 27 from 1927 until sometime before the 1940s, when the U.S. Route 1 designation was moved to Route 26, Route S26, and Route 25 between Trenton and Newark. U.S. Route 206 was designated along the portion of route between Trenton and Princeton by the 1940s. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the southern terminus of Route 27 was cut back to Princeton to avoid the concurrency with US 206.

<doc id="81870" wikidata="Q1050483" url="?curid=81870" title="Loire Valley">
<text>The Loire Valley (, ), spanning , is a valley located in the middle stretch of the Loire river in central France, in both the administrative regions Pays de la Loire and Centre-Val de Loire. The area of the Loire Valley comprises about . It is referred to as the &quot;Cradle of the French&quot; and the &quot;Garden of France&quot; due to the abundance of vineyards, fruit orchards (such as cherries), and artichoke, and asparagus fields, which line the banks of the river. Notable for its historic towns, architecture, and wines, the valley has been inhabited since the Middle Palaeolithic period. In 2000, UNESCO added the central part of the Loire River valley to its list of World Heritage Sites.

==Geography and climate==
The valley includes historic towns such as Amboise, Angers, Blois, Chinon, Montsoreau, Orléans, Saumur, and Tours.

The climate is favorable most of the year, the river often acting as a line of demarcation in France&#x27;s weather between the northern climate and the southern. The river has a significant effect on the mesoclimate of the region, adding a few degrees of temperature. The climate can be cool with springtime frost while wine harvest months may have rain. Summers are hot; however, influences from the Atlantic moderate the temperature with breezes.

Temperature, rainfall and average sunshine time in Angers (Anjou):
==Wine==
The Loire Valley wine region is one of the world&#x27;s most well-known areas of wine production and includes several French wine regions situated along the river from the Muscadet region on the Atlantic coast to the regions of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé just southeast of the city of Orléans in north central France. Loire wines tend to exhibit a characteristic fruitiness with fresh, crisp flavors.

==Culture==

On December 2, 2000, UNESCO added the central part of the river valley, between Chalonnes-sur-Loire and Sully-sur-Loire, to its list of World Heritage Sites. In choosing this area that includes the French &quot;départements&quot; of Loiret, Loir-et-Cher, Indre-et-Loire, and Maine-et-Loire, the committee said that the Loire Valley is: &quot;an exceptional cultural landscape, of great beauty, historic cities and villages, great architectural monuments - the &quot;châteaux&quot; - and lands that have been cultivated and shaped by centuries of interaction between local populations and their physical environment, in particular the Loire itself.&quot;

The Loire Valley chansonniers are a related group of songbooks attributed to the composers of the Loire Valley and are the earliest surviving examples of a new genre which offered a combination of words, music, and illuminations.

A new Contemporary Art offer is developing all along the Loire River from Montsoreau to Orléans with such places as Château de Montsoreau-Contemporary Art Museum, CCCOD Tours, the Domaine Régional de Chaumont sur Loire and the Frac Centre Orléans. They are a rare association of Renaissance architecture with contemporary art.

==Architecture==

The architectural heritage in the valley&#x27;s historic towns is notable, especially its châteaux, such as the Château de Montsoreau, Château d&#x27;Amboise, Château d&#x27;Azay-le-Rideau, Château de Chambord, Château de Chinon, Château du Rivau, Château d&#x27;Ussé, Château de Villandry and Chenonceau. The châteaux, numbering more than three hundred, include the necessary castle fortifications built in the 10th century but also the splendour of those built half a millennium later. When the French kings began constructing their huge châteaux here, the nobility, not wanting or even daring to be far from the seat of power, followed suit. Their presence in the lush, fertile valley began attracting the very best landscape designers. In addition to its many châteaux, the cultural monuments illustrate to an exceptional degree the ideals of the Renaissance and the Age of the Enlightenment on western European thought and design. Many of the châteaux were designed to be built on the top of hills, one example of this is the Château d&#x27;Amboise. Many of the châteaux had extremely detailed and expensive churches on the grounds, or within the actual château itself.

The Château de Montsoreau is the only château to have been built in the Loire riverbed, it is also the only one to be entirely dedicated to contemporary art.

==Economy==
The European Commission reported that in 2016, three categories accounted for most of the economy in the Pays-de-la-Loire region: services (including tourism) provided 66.7% of employment, industry 26.5% and agriculture, 3.9%. The unemployment rate was 8.8%. In 2015, the region ranked eighth in France in terms of economic performance producing 5.0% of the gross domestic product. Important economic sectors included leather goods, textile, shipyard/construction and aeronautics, agriculture and food-processing as well as the plastics industry. The EC did not produce a report for the larger Loire Valley region.

According to another source, tourism in the Loire Valley was supported by over 700 hotels and 550 restaurants in the region. In addition to the chateaux and some 700 other listed Historic monuments, attractions included three Regional nature Parks, 550 km of cycling tracks, 800 listed Historic monuments, over 100 museums and 30 golf courses.

In April 2019, The Guardian&#x27;s travel section included one Loire Valley location in its list of &quot;20 of the most beautiful villages in France&quot;: Montrésor, &quot;a fairytale village with a rich history&quot; evidenced by &quot;the wool market, the Halle de Cardeux, ... the 16th-century Logis du Chancelier, ... a riverside walk, Balcons de l’Indrois, [and] ... Jardinier Bridge&quot;.

According to a 2017 report by CNN, the 42 chateaux that make up the UNESCO World Heritage Site receive over 3.3 million visitors per year. The Telegraph newspaper (2014) listed the following as the premiere chateaux for tourists: Chinon, Cité royale de Loches, Chaumont, Blois, Meung, Chenonceau, Rivau, Lemeré, Amboise, Clos Lucé, Chambord, Villandry and Valençay.

<text>U.S. Route 22 (US 22) is a major east–west route and one of the original United States Numbered Highways, founded in 1926. It runs from Cincinnati, Ohio, at US 27, US 42, US 127, and US 52 to Newark, New Jersey, at US 1/9 at the Newark Airport Interchange.

US 22 is named the William Penn Highway through most of Pennsylvania. In southwest Ohio, it overlaps with State Route 3 (SR 3) and is familiarly known as the 3-C Highway, &quot;22 and 3&quot;, and Montgomery Road.

A section of US 22 in Pennsylvania between New Alexandria at US 119 and Harrisburg at Interstate 81 (I-81) has been designated a part of Corridor M of the Appalachian Development Highway System.

===Ohio===

US 22 has its westernmost endpoint in downtown Cincinnati. Its eastbound and westbound endpoints are not at the same intersection. Officially, US 22 eastbound begins on Central Avenue (US 27 northbound/US 52 westbound/US 127 northbound) at 5th Street, then proceeds north, turning east onto 7th Street. Meanwhile, US 22 westbound follows 9th Street and officially ends at Central Avenue (signage designating the end occurs much sooner, approaching Elm Street, US 42 northbound).

From downtown Cincinnati to Washington Court House, US 22 roughly follows the historic 3-C Highway which connected Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland. This section is also concurrent with SR 3. At Washington Court House, SR 3 and US 22 diverge. US 22 continues to the east through Circleville to Lancaster. From Lancaster to Zanesville, US 22 roughly follows the route of Zane&#x27;s Trace, an early pioneer road blazed by Ebenezer Zane beginning in 1796.

Starting just west of Cadiz, US 22 becomes a limited-access expressway for the remainder of its approximately in Ohio as it approaches and enters Greater Pittsburgh (with the exception of an at-grade intersection with no stoplights or signs on US 22 and narrowing to two lanes for about east of Cadiz). It junctions with SR 7 for roughly along the Ohio River shoreline in Steubenville.

===West Virginia===
Known as the Robert C. Byrd Expressway, the expressway route that began roughly to the west near Cadiz, Ohio, continues for approximately within the state of West Virginia (the highway runs concurrent with West Virginia Route 2, or WV 2, for one of those miles, or ) as it approaches more population density within Greater Pittsburgh. US 22 travels through or borders the city of Weirton for its entire length in West Virginia, from the Ohio state line over the Ohio River, to the Pennsylvania state line.
===Pennsylvania===
US 22 enters Pennsylvania as a limited-access highway connecting Weirton, West Virginia, and Steubenville, Ohio, with Pittsburgh. Through much of Greater Pittsburgh, it overlaps I-376 and US 30. US 30 merges with US 22 near Imperial and Pittsburgh International Airport, and both highways then merge with I-376 in Robinson Township. Together, these three highways form a busy, limited-access multiplex through the city of Pittsburgh. US 30 then splits from I-376 and US 22 in Wilkinsburg, and the I-376/US 22 concurrency continues to the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Monroeville, where I-376 ends.

East of I-376, US 22 continues east of Pittsburgh as a primary arterial highway. The entire length between Pittsburgh and US 220 and I-99 just west of Altoona was widened to at least four lanes by mid-2011. I-99 links the highway to State College and the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Heading east from I-99, US 22 narrows and becomes the primary highway linking Hollidaysburg and Huntingdon. Near Mount Union, it forms a concurrency with US 522, and the two highways go northeast along the Juniata River to Lewistown.

In Lewistown, US 22 breaks with US 522 and forms a concurrency with US 322, and the two routes travel southeast, mostly as an expressway, toward Harrisburg. At the north end of Harrisburg, US 22 and US 322 split and US 22 runs southward toward the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex &amp; Expo Center. From there, it turns eastward along Arsenal Boulevard, Herr Street, and Walnut Street to Jonestown Road. Through Dauphin and Lebanon counties, US 22 parallels I-81 and I-78 to the south as a four-lane arterial. East of Fredericksburg, along the border between Lebanon and Berks counties, US 22 forms a concurrency with I-78, which runs to the Allentown area. Former highway alignments of US 22 that parallel this section are collectively known as the &quot;Hex Highway&quot;, so called because of the Berks County-based Pennsylvania Dutch families that hang hex signs on their barns.

In the Lehigh Valley, US 22 is a four-lane limited-access expressway between Easton and I-78 to the west; it is dually designated with the Lehigh Valley Thruway in Allentown. The original designation for this expressway was to be I-78, but local opposition to a freeway in Phillipsburg, along with substandard conditions at Easton, forced federal highway officials to relocate I-78 south of Allentown, Bethlehem, Easton, and Phillipsburg. US 22 then crosses the Delaware River on the Easton–Phillipsburg Toll Bridge.

===New Jersey===
US 22 in New Jersey predates and was largely replaced by I-78 after I-78 was built between 1956 and 1989 and shares designation with I-78 from exit 3 to exit 18. US 22 was an expressway in some segments, including the area around Perryville and Clinton. It connects Phillipsburg with Newark in New Jersey.

US 22 has one major interchange besides I-78, that being I-287, although it is not a full interchange, with two missing movements: US 22 eastbound to I-287 northbound and I-287 southbound to US 22 westbound.

One of two level crossing of the highway happens in Union County in the Union Township section of the highway (the other occurring in Lewistown, Pennsylvania). It once belonged to the Rahway Valley Railroad; the crossing was closed in 1992 when service on the railroad was ended.

==History==
US 22 is one of the original U.S. Highways. In the 1925 plan, it was initially designed to terminate in Cleveland, Ohio, entering Ohio on modern US 422. In the finalized 1926 plan, however, it followed the current course to US 40, where it ended. In 1932, it was extended to Cincinnati as it is currently, replacing SR 10 and following preexisting SR 3.

Before the Byrd Expressway, West Virginia&#x27;s segment of US 22 ran from Pennsylvania Avenue at the West Virginia–Pennsylvania state line to Main Street, then left on Main Street through downtown Weirton (aligning US 22 with WV 2), and right on Freedom Way to the Fort Steuben Bridge and Ohio River to Steubenville, Ohio. US 22 Alternate (US 22 Alt.) ran along Cove Road from Pennsylvania Avenue to the intersection of Harmon Creek Road (left turn) and the continuation of Cove Road.

With the opening of the first segment of the Byrd Expressway on March 9, 1972, US 22 was reassigned, starting on the new road from the West Virginia–Pennsylvania state line, continuing on Cove Road where the expressway ended and joining the remainder of the original route at Main Street. The Pennsylvania Avenue segment of US 22 from Colliers Way to Main Street was reassigned as WV 105 and US 22 Alt. was reassigned as WV 507. In 2003, WV 507 was extended along the previous US 22 alignment from Cove Road to the Fort Steuben Bridge and was reassigned as CR 507. The Fort Steuben Bridge, which originally carried US 22 across the Ohio River until the construction of the Veterans Memorial Bridge, was permanently closed on January 8, 2009, and demolished by detonation on February 21, 2012.

<text>Route 138 is a state highway located entirely in Monmouth County, New Jersey that extends for . The route&#x27;s western terminus is at the eastern end of Interstate 195 (I-195) at the interchange with Route 34 in Wall Township. Route 138&#x27;s eastern terminus is at Route 35 in Wall Township. The highway is also meant to be an evacuation route in case of a disaster, where the eastbound lanes (as well as the eastbound lanes on I-195) would be reversed all the way to the New Jersey Turnpike.

The highway was first built as part of the planned Route 38 freeway in 1941. The freeway was to traverse the state from Camden to Belmar. When it became clear that the gap between two sections of Route 38 would not be filled, the New Jersey Department of Transportation re-designated the eastern portion as Route 138.

==Route description==

Route 138 begins at exit 35A on I-195 at Route 34 in Wall Township. The eastern continuation of I-195, Route 138 continues as a four-lane freeway through Monmouth County. The route interchanges with Route 34 southbound at exit 35A and northbound at exit 35B. A short distance later, the highway crosses to the south of a construction site and crosses over the southbound lanes of the Garden State Parkway (Route 444) and intersects with the on-ramp from the southbound lanes. The highway crosses over the northbound lanes and reaches exit 36, which serves the Parkway and a nearby park and ride. Continuing on, Route 138 becomes a four-lane arterial road and intersects with Allenwood Road in a rather dense area of Wall Township.
Route 138 continues further, passing to the south and to the north of commercial complexes along with several residential areas. The highway then proceeds to a small interchange with Club Drive, which serves a mix of residential homes and commercial buildings. From there, Route 138 becomes surrounded by patches of trees before interchanging with the southern terminus of Route 18 soon after. The route passes north along the interchange, where stub ramps along Route 18 can be seen to the south. After crossing Route 18, Route 138 continues on, entering a large commercial district, intersecting with New Bedford Road in the community of Wall. The highway continues as a four-lane arterial road, serving the local high school and local residential homes for a long distance. Route 138 intersects with Marconi Road and Bayshore Court before ending at a large interchange with Route 35.

==History==

The current alignment of Route 138 originates as an alignment of the State Highway Route 38 assigned in 1938. At that point, Route 38 was proposed as a highway from Camden (where it would end), past its former terminus at State Highway Route 39 to an intersection with State Highway Route 4-N in the community of Wall Township east of Fort Dix. A short portion of the highway was constructed from State Highway Route 34 to State Highway Route 35 was constructed as Route 38, which survived the 1953 state highway renumbering. During the 1960s, the New Jersey State Highway Department began to lay out a network of limited-access state highways across the state. The Route 38 freeway was proposed as a highway from I-676 in Camden to current-day Route 18 in Wall Township, to relieve congestion off of Route 70. The freeway was readopted by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission for the new Route 38 freeway from the Ben Franklin Bridge eastward (paralleling Route 70 and U.S. Route 30) to the area of Jackson Township, where it would follow current I-195&#x27;s alignment. The freeway was estimated by the highway department to cost $60 million (1969 USD) and to be finished around 1985. The proposal lasted through the 1970s, along with a cost adjustment in 1972, inflating the amount to construct the freeway at $101 million (1972 USD). By the end of the 1970s, the Route 38 freeway was facing opposition and limited resources, so the project was shelved. On July 29, 1988, the portion of Route 38 from Route 34 to Route 35 was re-designated to Route 138.

<doc id="81884" wikidata="Q2902868" url="?curid=81884" title="Newton's law of cooling">
<text>In the study of heat transfer, Newton&#x27;s law of cooling is a physical law which states that the rate of heat loss of a body is directly proportional to the difference in the temperatures between the body and its environment. The law is frequently qualified to include the condition that the temperature difference is small and the nature of heat transfer mechanism remains the same. As such, it is equivalent to a statement that the heat transfer coefficient, which mediates between heat losses and temperature differences, is a constant.

In heat conduction, Newton&#x27;s Law is generally followed as a consequence of Fourier&#x27;s law. The thermal conductivity of most materials is only weakly dependent on temperature, so the constant heat transfer coefficient condition is generally met. In convective heat transfer, Newton&#x27;s Law is followed for forced air or pumped fluid cooling, where the properties of the fluid do not vary strongly with temperature, but it is only approximately true for buoyancy-driven convection, where the velocity of the flow increases with temperature difference. In the case of heat transfer by thermal radiation, Newton&#x27;s law of cooling holds only for very small temperature differences.

When stated in terms of temperature differences, Newton&#x27;s law (with several further simplifying assumptions, such as a low Biot number and a temperature-independent heat capacity) results in a simple differential equation expressing temperature-difference as a function of time. The solution to that equation describes an exponential decrease of temperature-difference over time. This characteristic decay of the temperature-difference is also associated with Newton&#x27;s law of cooling.

== Historical background ==
Isaac Newton published his work on cooling anonymously in 1701 as &quot;Scala graduum Caloris. Calorum Descriptiones &amp; signa.&quot; in &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;. It was the first heat transfer formulation and serves as the formal basis of convective heat transfer.

Newton did not originally state his law in the above form in 1701. Rather, using today&#x27;s terms, Newton noted after some mathematical manipulation that &quot;the rate of temperature change&quot; of a body is proportional to the difference in temperatures between the body and its surroundings. This final simplest version of the law, given by Newton himself, was partly due to confusion in Newton&#x27;s time between the concepts of heat and temperature, which would not be fully disentangled until much later.

In 2020, Maruyama and Moriya repeated Newton&#x27;s experiments with modern apparatus, and they applied modern data reduction techniques. In particular, these investigators took account of thermal radiation at high temperatures (as for the molten metals Newton used), and they accounted for buoyancy effects on the air flow. By comparison to Newton&#x27;s original data, they concluded that his measurements (from 1692 to 1693) had been &quot;quite accurate&quot;.

== Relationship to mechanism of cooling==
Convection cooling is sometimes said to be governed by &quot;Newton&#x27;s law of cooling.&quot; When the heat transfer coefficient is independent, or relatively independent, of the temperature difference between object and environment, Newton&#x27;s law is followed. The law holds well for forced air and pumped liquid cooling, where the fluid velocity does not rise with increasing temperature difference. Newton&#x27;s law is most closely obeyed in purely conduction-type cooling. However, the heat transfer coefficient is a function of the temperature difference in natural convective (buoyancy driven) heat transfer. In that case, Newton&#x27;s law only approximates the result when the temperature difference is relatively small. Newton himself realized this limitation.

A correction to Newton&#x27;s law concerning convection for larger temperature differentials by including an exponent, was made in 1817 by Dulong and Petit. (These men are better-known for their formulation of the Dulong–Petit law concerning the molar specific heat capacity of a crystal.)

Another situation that does not obey Newton&#x27;s law is radiative heat transfer. Radiative cooling is better described by the Stefan–Boltzmann law in which the heat transfer rate varies as the difference in the 4th powers of the absolute temperatures of the object and of its environment.

== Mathematical formulation of Newton&#x27;s law ==

The statement of Newton&#x27;s law used in the heat transfer literature puts into mathematics the idea that &quot;the rate of heat loss of a body is proportional to the difference in temperatures between the body and its surroundings&quot;. For a temperature-independent heat transfer coefficient, the statement is:

formula_1
where
* formula_2 is the heat flux transferred out of the body (SI unit: watt/m2),
* formula_3 is the heat transfer coefficient (assumed independent of &quot;T&quot; and averaged over the surface) (SI unit: W/(m2⋅K)),
* formula_4 is the temperature of the object&#x27;s surface (SI unit: K),
* formula_5 is the temperature of the environment; i.e., the temperature suitably far from the surface (SI unit: K),
* formula_6 is the time-dependent temperature difference between environment and object (SI unit: K).

In global parameters by integrating on the surface area the heat flux, it can be also stated as:

formula_7
where
* formula_8 is the rate of heat transfer out of the body (SI unit: watt), formula_9
* formula_3 is the heat transfer coefficient (assumed independent of &quot;T&quot; and averaged over the surface) (SI unit: W/(m2⋅K)),
* formula_11 is the heat transfer surface area (SI unit: m2),
* formula_4 is the temperature of the object&#x27;s surface (SI unit: K),
* formula_5 is the temperature of the environment; i.e., the temperature suitably far from the surface (SI unit: K),
* formula_6 is the time-dependent temperature difference between environment and object (SI unit: K).

If the heat transfer coefficient and the temperature difference are uniform along the heat transfer surface, the above formula simplifies to:

formula_15.

The heat transfer coefficient &quot;h&quot; depends upon physical properties of the fluid and the physical situation in which convection occurs. Therefore, a single usable heat transfer coefficient (one that does not vary significantly across the temperature-difference ranges covered during cooling and heating) must be derived or found experimentally for every system that is to be analyzed.

Formulas and correlations are available in many references to calculate heat transfer coefficients for typical configurations and fluids. For laminar flows, the heat transfer coefficient is usually smaller than in turbulent flows because turbulent flows have strong mixing within the boundary layer on the heat transfer surface. Note the heat transfer coefficient changes in a system when a transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurs.

=== The Biot number ===

The Biot number, a dimensionless quantity, is defined for a body as

formula_16
where
* &quot;h&quot; = film coefficient or heat transfer coefficient or convective heat transfer coefficient,
* &quot;L&quot;C = characteristic length, which is commonly defined as the volume of the body divided by the surface area of the body, such that formula_17,
* &quot;k&quot;b = thermal conductivity of the body.

The physical significance of Biot number can be understood by imagining the heat flow from a hot metal sphere suddenly immersed in a pool to the surrounding fluid. The heat flow experiences two resistances: the first outside the surface of the sphere, and the second within the solid metal (which is influenced by both the size and composition of the sphere). The ratio of these resistances is the dimensionless Biot number.

If the thermal resistance at the fluid/sphere interface exceeds that thermal resistance offered by the interior of the metal sphere, the Biot number will be less than one. For systems where it is much less than one, the interior of the sphere may be presumed always to have the same temperature, although this temperature may be changing, as heat passes into the sphere from the surface. The equation to describe this change in (relatively uniform) temperature inside the object, is the simple exponential one described in Newton&#x27;s law of cooling expressed in terms of temperature difference (see below).

In contrast, the metal sphere may be large, causing the characteristic length to increase to the point that the Biot number is larger than one. In this case, temperature gradients within the sphere become important, even though the sphere material is a good conductor. Equivalently, if the sphere is made of a thermally insulating (poorly conductive) material, such as wood or styrofoam, the interior resistance to heat flow will exceed that at the fluid/sphere boundary, even with a much smaller sphere. In this case, again, the Biot number will be greater than one.

Values of the Biot number smaller than 0.1 imply that the heat conduction inside the body is much faster than the heat convection away from its surface, and temperature gradients are negligible inside of it. This can indicate the applicability (or inapplicability) of certain methods of solving transient heat transfer problems. For example, a Biot number less than 0.1 typically indicates less than 5% error will be present when assuming a lumped-capacitance model of transient heat transfer (also called lumped system analysis). Typically, this type of analysis leads to simple exponential heating or cooling behavior (&quot;Newtonian&quot; cooling or heating) since the internal energy of the body is directly proportional to its temperature, which in turn determines the rate of heat transfer into or out of it. This leads to a simple first-order differential equation which describes heat transfer in these systems.

Having a Biot number smaller than 0.1 labels a substance as &quot;thermally thin,&quot; and temperature can be assumed to be constant throughout the material&#x27;s volume. The opposite is also true: A Biot number greater than 0.1 (a &quot;thermally thick&quot; substance) indicates that one cannot make this assumption, and more complicated heat transfer equations for &quot;transient heat conduction&quot; will be required to describe the time-varying and non-spatially-uniform temperature field within the material body. Analytic methods for handling these problems, which may exist for simple geometric shapes and uniform material thermal conductivity, are described in the article on the heat equation.

== Application of Newton&#x27;s law of transient cooling ==

Simple solutions for transient cooling of an object may be obtained when the internal thermal resistance within the object is small in comparison to the resistance to heat transfer away from the object&#x27;s surface (by external conduction or convection), which is the condition for which the Biot number is less than about 0.1. This condition allows the presumption of a single, approximately uniform temperature inside the body, which varies in time but not with position. (Otherwise the body would have many different temperatures inside it at any one time.) This single temperature will generally change exponentially as time progresses (see below).

The condition of low Biot number leads to the so-called lumped capacitance model. In this model, the internal energy (the amount of thermal energy in the body) is calculated by assuming a constant heat capacity. In that case, the internal energy of the body is a linear function of the body&#x27;s single internal temperature.

The lumped capacitance solution that follows assumes a constant heat transfer coefficient, as would be the case in forced convection. For free convection, the lumped capacitance model can be solved with a heat transfer coefficient that varies with temperature difference.

=== First-order transient response of lumped-capacitance objects ===

A body treated as a lumped capacitance object, with a total internal energy of formula_18 (in joules), is characterized by a single uniform internal temperature, The heat capacitance, of the body is formula_19 (in J/K), for the case of an incompressible material. The internal energy may be written in terms of the temperature of the body, the heat capacitance (taken to be independent of temperature), and a reference temperature at which the internal energy is zero: 

Differentiating formula_18 with respect to time gives:
formula_21

Applying the first law of thermodynamics to the lumped object gives where the rate of heat transfer out of the body, may be expressed by Newton&#x27;s law of cooling, and where no work transfer occurs for an incompressible material. Thus,
formula_22
where the time constant of the system is The heat capacitance formula_23 may be written in terms of the object&#x27;s specific heat capacity, formula_24 (J/kg-K), and mass, formula_25 (kg). The time constant is then 

When the environmental temperature is constant in time, we may define The equation becomes
formula_26

The solution of this differential equation, by integration from the initial condition, is
formula_27
where formula_28 is the temperature difference at time 0. Reverting to temperature, the solution is
formula_29

The temperature difference between the body and the environment decays exponentially as a function of time.

=== Standard Formulation ===

By defining formula_30, the differential equation becomes

formula_31
where
* formula_32 is the rate of heat loss (SI unit: K/second),
* formula_4 is the temperature of the object&#x27;s surface (SI unit: K),
* formula_5 is the temperature of the environment; i.e., the temperature suitably far from the surface (SI unit: K),
* formula_35 is the coefficient of heat transfer (SI unit: secondformula_36).

Solving the initial-value problem using separation of variables gives

formula_37

<text>Palace of Fontainebleau ( , ; ), located southeast of the center of Paris, in the commune of Fontainebleau, is one of the largest French royal châteaux. It served as a hunting lodge and summer residence for many of the French monarchs, including Louis VII, Francis I, Henry II, Louis-Philippe, Napoleon I, and Napoleon III. Though the monarchs only resided there for a few months of the year, they gradually transformed it into a genuine palace, filled with art and decoration. It became a national museum in 1927 and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981 for its unique architecture and historical importance.

== History ==
===Name===
&quot;Fontainebleau&quot; took its name from the &quot;Fontaine Belle-Eau&quot;, a natural fresh water spring located in the English garden not far from the château. The name means &quot;Spring of beautiful water&quot;. In the 19th century the spring was rebuilt with an octagonal stone basin, as it appears today.
=== Hunting Lodge and castle (12th century) ===
The earliest reference to a royal residence at Fontainebleau dates to 1137 under King Louis VII the Younger, but it had probably been built earlier, during the reign of Philip I of France (1060 to 1108), when the Gâtinais region was annexed from the Duchy of Burgundy. It became a favorite summer residence and hunting lodge of the kings of France because of the abundant game and many springs in the surrounding forest. 

The first chateau was a square &quot;donjon&quot; or keep, a fortified tower surrounded by a wall. It was three stories high, and occupied an area of about fifty square meters. The lower walls were three meters wide while the upper walls were a meter wide, made of stone, had windows facing north and south and were topped by a wooden palisade. The King resided on the middle level. The original tower, rebuilt to fit the later styles, is still part of the Oval Court. 

Louis VII built a chapel which was consecrated in 1169 by Thomas Becket, the English priest in exile in France because of this disagreements with King Henry II of England. He also sponsored the construction of a monastery of the Trinitarians, a mendicant order of monks, close to the castle 

=== Francis I and The first School of Fontainbleau (1528–1547) ===
The modest medieval castle remained until the reign of Francis I of France (1494–1547). The King commissioned the architect Gilles Le Breton to build a new palace in the Renaissance style. Le Breton created the Cour Ovale, or oval courtyard, He preserved the original medieval keep on one side, but added a monumental new building, the Porte Dorée or Golden Gate, in the Italian Renaissance style, as the main entry of the palace, On the north side he built another building with a Renaissance stairway, the Portique de Serlio, which gave access the royal apartments.

Beginning in about 1528, Francis constructed the , which allowed him to pass directly from his apartments to the chapel of the Trinitarians. He brought the architect Sebastiano Serlio from Italy, and the Florentine painter Giovanni Battista di Jacopo, known as Rosso Fiorentino, to decorate the new gallery. Between 1533 and 1539 Rosso Fiorentino filled the gallery with murals glorifying the king, framed in stucco ornament in high relief, and &quot;lambris&quot; sculpted by the furniture maker Francesco Scibec da Carpi. Another Italian painter, Francesco Primaticcio from Bologna (&quot;Primatice&quot; to the French), joined later in the decoration of the gallery. Their elaborate mixture of painting and sculpture became known as the first School of Fontainebleau, which helped launch the French Renaissance. The emblem of Francis I, a salamander surrounded by flames, is found alongside each painting he commissioned in the Grand Gallery.

In about 1540, Francis began another major addition to the château. Using land on the east side of the château purchased from the order of the Trinitarians, he began to build a new square of buildings around a large courtyard. It was enclosed on the north by the wing of the Ministers, on the east by the wing of Ferrare, and on the south by a wing containing the new gallery of Ulysses. The château was surrounded by a new park in the style of the Italian Renaissance garden, with pavilions and the first grotto in France. Francesco Primaticcio created more monumental murals for the gallery of Ulysses.

=== Henry II and Catherine de&#x27; Medici (1547–1570) ===

Following the death of Francis I, King Henry II continued to expand the chateau. The King and his wife, Catherine de&#x27; Medici, chose the architects Philibert de l&#x27;Orme and Jean Bullant to do the work. They extended the east wing of the lower court and decorated it with a horseshoe-shaped staircase, which was later enlarged, and became a symbol of the château.

Their major project was the Oval Court, which was designed to be the entrance to the new royal apartments. They transformed the loggia originally planned by Francis I into a Salle des Fêtes, or grand ballroom, with a coffered ceiling. Facing the courtyard of the fountain and the fish pond.

The decoration of the new ballroom featured murals by Francesco Primaticcio, surrounded by elaborate stucco sculpture. A new generation of artists joined the work, including the Mannerists painters Primaticcio and Niccolò dell&#x27;Abbate. It was also the birthplace of Francis II, Henry II&#x27;s firstborn son.

Following the death of Henry II in a jousting accident, his widow, Catherine de&#x27; Medici, took over the project, which she carried out through the reigns of her three sons, Francis II, Charles IX, and Henry III. She named Primaticcio as the new superintendent of royal public works. He designed the section known today as the wing of the Belle Cheminée, noted for its elaborate chimneys and its two opposing stairways. In 1565, as a security measure due to the Wars of Religion, she also had a moat dug around the château to protect it against attack.

===Henry IV (1570–1610)===
King Henry IV made more additions to the château than any king since Francis I. He extended the oval court toward the west by building two pavilions, called Tiber and Luxembourg. Between 1601 and 1606, he remade all the façades around the courtyard, including that of the chapel of Saint-Saturnin, to give the architecture greater harmony. On the east side, he built a new monumental domed gateway, the Porte du Baptistère. Between 1606 and 1609, he built a new courtyard, the Cour des Offices or Quartier Henry IV, to provide a place for the kitchens and residences for court officials. Two new galleries, the Gallery of Diana and the Gallery of Deer, were built to enclose the old garden of Diana. He also added a large &quot;jeu de paume&quot;, or indoor tennis court, the largest such court existing in the world.

A second School of Fontainebleau group of painters and decorators went to work on the interiors. The architect Martin Fréminet created the ornate chapel of the Trinity, while the painters Ambroise Dubois and Toussaint Dubreuil created a series of heroic paintings for the salons. A new wing, named for its central building, La Belle Cheminée, was built next to the large fish pond.

Henry IV also devoted great attention to the park and gardens around the chateau. The garden of the Queen or garden of Diana, created by Catherine de&#x27; Medici, with the fountain of Diane in the center, was located on the north side of the palace. Henry IV&#x27;s gardener, Claude Mollet, trained at Château d&#x27;Anet, created a large parterre of flower beds, decorated with ancient statues and separated by paths into large squares. The fountain of Diana and the grotto were made by Tommaso Francini, who may also have designed the Medici Fountain in the Luxembourg Garden for Marie de&#x27; Medici. On the south side, Henry created a park, planted with pines, elms and fruit trees, and laid out a grand canal 1200 meters long, sixty years before Louis XIV built his own grand canal at Versailles.

===Louis XIII to Louis XVI (17th-18th century)===

King Louis XIII, who had been born and baptized in the château, continued the works begun by his father. He completed the decoration of the chapel of the Trinity, and assigned the court architect Jean Androuet du Cerceau to reconstruct the horseshoe stairway earlier designed by Philibert Delorme on the courtyard that had become known as the Cour de Cheval Blanc. After his death, his widow, Anne of Austria, redecorated the apartments within the Wing of the Queen Mothers (Aile des Reines Mères) next to the Court of the Fountain, designed by Primatrice.

King Louis XIV spent more days at Fontainebleau than any other monarch; he liked to hunt there every year at the end of summer and the beginning of autumn. He made few changes to the exterior of the château, but did build a new apartment for his companion Madame de Maintenon, furnished it with some major works of André-Charles Boulle and demolished the old apartments of the baths under the Gallery of Francis I to create new apartments for the royal princes, and he made some modifications to the apartments of the King. The architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart built a new wing alongside the Gallery of Deer and the Gallery of Diana to provide more living space for the Court. He did make major changes in the park and gardens; he commissioned André Le Nôtre and Louis Le Vau to redesign the large parterre into a French formal garden. He removed the hanging garden which Henry IV had built next to the large fish pond, and instead built a pavilion, designed by Le Vau, on a small island in the center of the pond.

Louis XIV welcomed many foreign guests there, including the former Queen Christina of Sweden, who had just abdicated her crown. While a guest in the château on 10 November 1657, Christina suspected her Master of the Horse and reputed lover, the Marchese , of betraying her secrets to her enemies. Her servants chased him through the halls of the château and stabbed him to death. Louis XIV came to see her at the château, did not mention the murder, and allowed her to continue her travels.

On May 19–20, 1717, during the Regency following the death of Louis XIV, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great was a guest at Fontainebleau. A hunt for stags was organized for him, and a banquet. Officially the visit was a great success, but in the memoirs published later by members of the delegation, it appears that Peter disliked the French style of hunting, and that he found the château too small, compared with the other royal French residences. The routine of Fontainebleau also did not suit his tastes; he preferred beer to wine (and brought his own supply with him) and he liked to get up early, unlike the French Court.

The renovation projects of Louis XV were more ambitious than those of Louis XIV. To create more lodging for his enormous number of courtiers, in 1737–38 the King built a new courtyard, called the Cour de la Conciergerie or the Cour des Princes, to the east of the Gallery of Deer. On the Cour du Cheval Blanc, the wing of the Gallery of Ulysses was torn down and gradually replaced by a new brick and stone building, built in stages in 1738–1741 and 1773–74, extending west toward the Pavilion and grotto of the pines.

Between 1750 and 1754, the King commissioned the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel, who had designed the Place de la Concorde and Petit Trianon to build a new wing along the Cour de la Fontaine and the carp pond. The old Pavilion des Poeles was demolished and replaced by the Gros Pavilion, built of cream-colored stone. Lavish new apartments were created inside this building for the King and the Queen. The new meeting room for the Royal Council was decorated by the leading painters of the day, including François Boucher, Charles-André van Loo, Jean-Baptiste Marie Pierre and Alexis Peyrotte. A magnificent small theater was created on the first floor of the wing of the Belle Cheminée.

King Louis XVI also made additions to the château to create more space for his courtiers. A new building was constructed alongside the Gallery of Francis I; it created a large new apartment on the first floor, and a number of small apartments on the ground floor, but also blocked the windows on the north side of the Gallery of Francis I. The apartments of Queen Marie Antoinette were redone, a Turkish-style salon was created for her in 1777, a room for games in 1786–1787, and a &quot;boudoir&quot; in the arabesque style. Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette made their last visit to Fontainebleau in 1786, on the eve of the French Revolution.

===The Revolution and the First Empire===

During the French Revolution the château was far from the turbulence of Paris, and did not suffer any significant damage, but all the furniture was later sold at auction. The buildings were occupied by the Central School of the Department of Seine-et-Marne, until 1803, when Napoleon installed a military school there. He chose Fontainebleau as the site of his historic 1804 meeting with Pope Pius VII, who had travelled from Rome to crown Napoleon emperor. Apartments were refurnished and decorated for the Emperor and Empress in the new Empire style. The Cour du Cheval Blanc was renamed the Cour d&#x27;Honneur, or Courtyard of Honor. One wing facing the courtyard, the Aile de Ferrare, was torn down and replaced with an ornamental iron fence and gate, making the façade of the palace visible. The gardens of Diane and the gardens of the Pines were replanted and turned into an English landscape garden by the landscape designer Maximilien Joseph Hurtault.

Napoleon&#x27;s visits to Fontainebleau were not frequent, because he was occupied so much of the time with military campaigns. Between 1812 and 1814, the château served as a very elegant prison for Pope Pius VII. On 5 November 1810, the chapel of the château was used for the baptism of Napoleon&#x27;s nephew, the future Napoleon III, with Napoleon serving as his godfather, and the Empress Marie-Louise as his godmother.

Napoleon spent the last days of his reign at Fontainebleau, before abdicating there on 4 April 1814, under pressure from his Marshals, Ney, Berthier, and Lefebvre. On 20 April, after failing in an attempt to commit suicide, he gave an emotional farewell to the soldiers of the Old Guard, assembled in the Court of Honor. Later, during the Hundred Days, he stopped there on 20 March 1815.

In his memoirs, written while in exile on Saint Helena, he recalled his time at Fontainebleau; &quot;...the true residence of kings, the house of the centuries. Perhaps it was not a rigorously architectural palace, but it was certainly a place of residence well thought out and perfectly suitable. It was certainly the most comfortable and happily situated palace in Europe.&quot;

=== Restoration and the reign of Louis-Philippe (1815–1848)===
Following the restoration of the monarchy, Kings Louis XVIII and Charles X each stayed at Fontainebleau, but neither made any major changes to the palace. Louis-Philippe I was more active, both restoring some rooms and redecorating others in the style of his period. The Hall of the Guards and Gallery of Plates were redecorated in a Neo-Renaissance style, while the Hall of Columns, under the ballroom, was remade in a neoclassical style. He added new stained glass windows, made by the Royal Manufactory of Sèvres.

===The Second Empire of Napoleon III===

Emperor Napoleon III, who had been baptized at Fontainebleau, resumed the custom of long stays at Fontainebleau, particularly during the summer. Many of the historic rooms, such as the Gallery of Deer, were restored to something like their original appearance, while the private apartments were redecorated to suit the tastes of the Emperor and Empress. Numerous guest apartments were squeezed into unused spaces of the buildings. The old theater of the palace, built in the 18th century, was destroyed by a fire in the wing of the Belle Cheminée 1856. Between 1854 and 1857 the architect Hector Lefuel built a new theater in the Louis XVI style, where famous actors from the theatres of Paris performed portions of plays for the guests of the Emperor. 

On the ground floor of the Gros Pavilion, the Empress Eugénie built a small but rich museum, containing gifts from the King of Siam in 1861, and works of art taken during the pillage of the Summer Palace in Beijing. It also featured paintings by contemporary artists, including Franz Xaver Winterhalter, and the sculptor Charles Henri Joseph Cordier. Close by, in the Louis XV wing, the Emperor established his office, and the Empress made her Salon of Lacquer. These were the last rooms created by the royal residents of Fontainebleau. In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, the Second Empire fell, and the château was closed.

===Third Republic to the present day===
During the Franco-Prussian War, the palace was occupied by the Prussian Army on 17 September 1870, and briefly used as an army headquarters by Frederick Charles of Prussia from March 1871. Following the war, two of the buildings became the home of the School of Applied Artillery, which had been forced to leave Alsace when the province was annexed by Germany. It was occasionally used as a residence by the presidents of the Third Republic, and to welcome state guests including King Alexander I of Serbia (1891), King George I of Greece (1892) Leopold II of Belgium (1895) and King Alfonso XIII of Spain (1913). It also received a visit by the last survivor of its royal residents, the Empress Eugénie, on 26 June 1920.

The façades the major buildings received their first protection by classification as historic monuments on 20 August 1913. In 1923, following World War I, it became home of the Écoles d&#x27;Art Américaines, schools of art and music, which still exist today. In 1927 it became a national museum. Between the wars the upper floors of the wing of the Belle Cheminée, burned in 1856, were rebuilt by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.

During World War II, it was occupied by the Germans on 16 June 1940, and occupied until 10 November, and again from 15 May to the end of October 1941. Following the war, part of the château became a headquarters of the Western Union and later NATO&#x27;s Allied Forces Central Europe/Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, until 1966.

The general restoration of the château took place between 1964 and 1968 under President Charles de Gaulle and his Minister of Culture, Andre Malraux. It was classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981. In 2006, the Ministry of Culture purchased the royal stables, and began their restoration.

Beginning in 2007, restoration began of the theater of the château, created by Napoleon III during the Second Empire. The project was funded by the government of Abu Dhabi, and in exchange the theater was renamed for Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. It was inaugurated on 30 April 2014.

On 1 March 2015, the Chinese Museum of the château was robbed by professional thieves. They broke in at about six in the morning, and, despite alarms and video cameras, in seven minutes stole about fifteen of the most valuable objects in the collection, including the replica of the crown of Siam given by the Siamese government to Napoleon III, a Tibetan mandala, and an enamel chimera from the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1736–1795).

== Architecture ==
==Palace Interior ==
===Gallery of Francis I===

The Gallery of Francis I is one of the first and finest examples of Renaissance decoration in France. It was begun in 1528 as a passageway between the apartments of the King with the oval courtyard and the great chapel of the Trinitarian monastery, but in 1531 Francis I made it a part of his royal apartments, and between 1533 and 1539 it was decorated by artists and craftsmen from Italy, under the direction of the painter Rosso Fiorentino, or Primaticcio, in the new Renaissance style. The lower walls of the passage were the work of the master Italian furniture maker Francesco Scibec da Carpi; they are decorated with the coat of arms of France and the salamander, the emblem of the King. The upper walls are covered by frescoes framed in richly sculpted stucco. The frescoes depicted mythological scenes to illustrate the virtues of the King.

On the side of gallery with windows, the frescoes represent &quot;Ignorance Driven Out&quot;; &quot;The Unity of the State&quot;; &quot;Cliobis and Biton&quot;; &quot;Danae&quot;; &quot;The Death of Adonis&quot;; &quot;The Loss of Perpetual Youth&quot;; and &quot;The Battle of the Centaurs and the Lapithes&quot;.

On the side of the gallery facing the windows, the frescoes represent: &quot;A Sacrifice&quot;; &quot;The Royal Elephant&quot;; &quot;The Burning of Catane&quot;; &quot;The Nymph of Fontainebleau&quot; (painted in 1860–61 by J. Alaux to cover a former entry to the gallery); &quot;The Sinking of Ajax&quot;;&quot;The Education of Achilles&quot; and &quot;The Frustration of Venus&quot;.

===Ballroom (1552)===

The ballroom was originally begun as an open passageway, or loggia, by Francis I. In about 1552 King Henry II closed it with high windows and an ornate coffered ceiling, and transformed it into a room for celebrations and balls. The &#x27;H&#x27;, the initial of the King, is prominent in the decor, as well as figures of the crescent moon, the symbol of Henry&#x27;s mistress Diane de Poitiers. In the 19th century King Louis Philippe added the elaborate wooden floor, which copies the original designs in the coffers of the ceiling. 

At the eastern end is a monumental fireplace, which flanked with two statues of Satyrs copied by Primaticcio from Roman originals. (The current statues are later copies). Above the eastern end of the room is a gallery where the musicians played during balls. The decor was restored many times over the years. 
The frescoes on the walls and pillars were painted beginning in 1552 by Nicolo dell&#x27;Abate, following drawings by Primaticcio. On the garden side of the ballroom, they represent: &quot;The Harvest&quot;; &quot;Vulcan forging weapons for Love at the request of Venus&quot;; &quot;Phaeton begging the sun to let him drive his chariot&quot;; and &quot;Jupiter and Mercury at the home of Philemon and Baucis&quot;. The floor, which mirrors the design of the ceiling, was crafted by Louis-Philippe in the first half of the 19th century. 

The frescoes on the side of the Oval Courtyard represent: &quot;The feast of Bacchus&quot;; &quot;Apollo and the Muses on Mount Parnassus&quot;; &quot;The Three Graces dancing before the gods&quot;; and &quot;The wedding feast of Thetis and Peleus&quot;.

Some of the fresco themes are more contemporary. A fresco above the fireplace depicts Sébastien de Rabutin, a huissier of the Court of Henry II, who in 1548 killed a wolf during a hunt in the forest of Orléans. Henry II commissioned the painting to commemorate the event.

===Chapel of Saint Saturnin===
Behind the ballroom is St. Saturnin&#x27;s Chapel. The lower chapel was originally built in the 12th century, but was completely rebuilt under Francis I with a richly coffered ceiling and dome. It was largely completed in 1546. The emblem of Henry II, the salamander, marks the keystones. 

In 1554, under Henry II, the architect Philibert de l&#x27;Orme built a new organ loft, supported by two tall marble columns. 

Stained glass windows made in Sèvres, designed by Louis&#x27; daughter Marie, an artist, were installed in the 19th century during the Louis Philippe period.

===The King&#x27;s Staircase===
The stairway of the King was installed in 1748 and 1749, in the space occupied during the reign of Francis I by the bedroom of Anne de Pisseleu, the Duchess of Étampes, a favorite of the King. It was designed by the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel, who used many decorative elements from the earlier room, which had originally been decorated by Primaticcio. The upper portion of the walls is divided into panels, oval and rectangular, with scenes representing the love life of Alexander the Great. The paintings are framed by large statues of women by Primaticcio. The eastern wall of the room was destroyed during the reconstruction, and was replaced during the reign of Louis Philippe in the 19th century with paintings by Abel de Pujol.

===The Queen&#x27;s bedchamber===

All of the queens and empresses of France, from Marie de&#x27; Medici to the Empress Eugènie, slept in the bedchamber of the Queen. The ornate ceiling over the bed was made in 1644 by the furniture-maker Guillaume Noyers for the Dowager Queen Anne of Austria, the mother of Louis XIV, and bears her initials. The room was redecorated by Marie Leszczynska, the Queen of Louis XV in 1746–1747. The ceiling of the alcove, the decoration around the windows and the wood panelling were made by Jacques Vererckt and Antoine Magnonais in the rocaille style of the day. The decoration of the fireplace dates to the same period.

The doors have an arabesque design, and were made for Marie Antoinette, as were the sculpted panels over the doors, installed in 1787. The bed was also made specially for Marie Antoinette, but did not arrive until 1797, after the Revolution and her execution. As a result it escaped the sales of the château furnishings which took place immediately after the Revolution. It was used instead by Napoleon&#x27;s wives, the Empress Joséphine and Marie-Louise of Austria.

The walls received their ornamental textile covering, with a design of flowers and birds, in 1805. It was restored in 1968–1986 using the original fabric as a model. The furniture in the room all dates to the First Empire. The balustrade around the bed was originally made for the throne room of the Tuileries Palace in 1804. The armchairs with a sphinx pattern, the consoles and screen and the two chests of drawers were placed in the room in 1806.

===Boudoir of Marie-Antoinette (1786)===

The boudoir next to the queen&#x27;s bedroom was created for Queen Marie Antoinette in 1786, and permitted the queen to have a measure of privacy. The room is the best surviving example of the decorative style just before the French Revolution, inspired by ancient Roman models, with delicately painted arabesques, cameos, vases, antique figures and garlands of flowers against a silver background, framed by gilded and sculpted woodwork.

The room was made for the Queen by the same team of artists and craftsmen who also made the game room; the design was by the architect Pierre Rousseau (1751–1829). The wood panelling was sculpted by Laplace, and painted by Michel-Hubert Bourgeois and Louis-François Touzé. Eight figures of the Muses were made in plaster by Roland; the ornate mantle of the fireplace was made by Jacques-François Dropsy, and decorated with glided bronze works by Claude-Jean Pitoin. The mahogany parquet floor, decorated with the emblems of the Queen, was made by Bernard Molitor, and finished in 1787. The painted ceiling, by Jean-Simon Berthélemy, shows Aurora with a group of angels.

The furnishings were designed for the room by Jean-Henri Riesener, using the finest materials available; mother of pearl, gilded bronze, brass, satin and ebony. Some of the original furnishings remain, including the cylindrical desk and the table, which were made between 1784 and 1789. The two armchairs are copies of the originals made by Georges Jacob which are now in the Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon, while the footstool is the original.

=== Games Room of Marie-Antoinette and Grand Salon of the Empress Eugenie (1786)===

The Games Room was created for Marie Antoinette in 1786, and is a notable example of the Arabesque style popular in the First French Empire in the 18th century. The walls are filled with large wall panels, with grisaille and monochrome depictions twining plants, women in flowing robes, dancers, mermaids, torches and vases. The same designs appear in gilding on the mahogany doors.

The room is now furnished in the Empire style. The chairs followed the rules of protocol, with armchairs for the Emperor and Empress, chairs for princesses, and folding chair and stools covered with green velvet trimmed with gold for the guests.

=== The Queen&#x27;s Small Salon or the White Salon (1835)===

The White Salon was created in 1835 as a salon for Queen Marie-Amelie, the wife of King Louis Philippe to replace the Queen&#x27;s Study of Marie de Medici. Just one element of the 17th century salon, remains; paintings by Amboise Dubois depicting the legend of Tancred and Clorinda. It is one of the best examples of the 19th century style of Louis-Philippe, which blended together earlier styles; it combined wainscotting from the reign of Louis XV of France, along with a Louis XVI style fireplace, an Empire style chimney, and armchairs by Jacob-Freres and Jacob Desmalter and other prominent designers of the early 19th century.

===Bed chamber of the Kings of France and Throne Room of Napoleon ===
In 1808 Napoleon decided to install his throne in the former bedroom of the kings of France from Henry IV to Louis XVI, on the place where the royal bed had been. Under the Ancien régime, the King&#x27;s bed was a symbol of royal authority in France and was saluted by courtiers who passed by it. Napoleon wanted to show the continuity of his Empire with the past monarchies of France. The majority of the carved wood ceiling, the lower part of the wood panelling, and the doors date to the reign of Louis XIII. The ceiling directly over the throne was made at the end of the reign of Louis XIV. Louis XV created a new chimney, sculpted wooden medallions near the fireplace, the designs over the doors, and the fine carved woodwork facing the throne (1752–54). He also had the ceiling painted white and gilded and decorated with mosaics, to match the ceiling of the bedroom of the Queen.

Napoleon added the standards with his initial and the Imperial eagle. The decoration around the throne was originally designed in 1804 by Jacob-Desmalter for the Château de Saint-Cloud, and the throne itself, made in 1804, came from the Tuileries Palace.

The chimney was originally decorated with a portrait of Louis XIII painted by Philippe de Champaigne, which was burned in 1793 during the French Revolution. Napoleon replaced it with a portrait of himself, by Robert Lefèvre. In 1834, King Louis-Philippe took down Napoleon&#x27;s picture and replaced with another of Louis XIII, from a painter of the school of Champaigne.

===Council Chamber===

The Council Chamber, where French Kings and later the Emperors Napoleon I and Napoleon III met their closest advisors, was close to the Throne Room. It was originally the office of Francis I, and was decorated with painted wooden panels with illustrations by Primaticcio depicting the virtues and the heroes of antiquity. The room was enlarged under Louis XIV, and the decorator, Claude Audran, followed the same theme.

The room was extensively redecorated between 1751 and 1754 by the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel, with arcades and wooded panels illustrating the Virtues, and allegories of the seasons and the elements, painted by Jean-Baptiste Marie Pierre and Carle van Loo, the latter painted his scenes in blue monochrome, while Pierre used pink monochrome. The painter Alexis Peyrotte added another series of medallions on the upper walls depicting floral themes, the sciences and arts.

The five paintings on the vaulted ceiling were the work of François Boucher, and illustrate the Four Seasons and the sun beginning his journey and chasing away the night. A half-rotonda on the garden side of the room was added by Louis XV in 1773, with a painted ceiling by Louis-Jean-François Lagrenée depicting Glory surrounded by his children.

The room was used as a council chamber by Napoleon I, and the furnishings are from that time. The armchairs at the table for the ministers are by Marcion (1806) and the folding chairs for advisors were designed by Jacob-Desmalter (1808).

==Apartment of Napoleon==
In 1804 Napoleon decided that he wanted his own apartments within the palace, separate from the old royal apartments. He took over a suite of six rooms which had been created in 1786 for Louis XVI, next to the Gallery of Francis I, and had them redecorated in the Empire style.
The old apartment included a dressing room (&quot;cabinet de toilette&quot;), study, library, and bath.

===Emperor&#x27;s bedchamber===

Beginning in 1808, Napoleon had his bedchamber relocated the former dressing room of the King. From this room, using a door hidden behind the drapery to the right of the bed, Napoleon could go directly to his private library or to the offices on the ground floor.

Much of the original decor was unchanged from the time of Louis XVI; the fireplaces, the carved wooden panels sculpted by Pierre-Joseph LaPlace and the sculpture over the door by Sauvage remained as they were. The walls were painted with Imperial emblems in gold on white by Frederic-Simon Moench. The bed, made especially for the Emperor, was the summit of the Empire style; it was crowned with an imperial eagle and decorated with allegorical sculptures representing Glory, Justice, and Abundance. The Emperor had a special carpet made by Sallandrouze in the shape of the cross of the Legion of Honor; the branches of the cross alternate with symbols of military and civilian attributes. The chairs near the fireplace were specially designed, with one side higher than the other, to contain the heat from the fire while allowing the occupants to see the decorations of the fireplace. 

The painting on the ceiling of the room was added later, after the downfall of Napoleon, by Louis XVIII. Painted by Jean-Baptiste Regnault, it is an allegory representing &quot;The clemency of the King halting justice in its course.&quot;

=== Other rooms in the Emperor&#x27;s apartment ===
The small bedchamber often served as Napoleon&#x27;s work room. In 1811 he added the camp bed, similar to the bed he used on his military campaigns. He could rest briefly, then take a back stairway to continue working in the library or map room on the floor below.

The private salon or study of the Emperor was simply furnished and decorated. It was in this room, on the small table on display, that the Emperor signed his abdication in 1814.

The small and simple bathroom of the Emperor had a tinned copper bathtub surrounded by a simple cotton skirt, where he could soak in hot water. It also had a varnished metal tub where he could soak his feet.

==Apartment of the Pope and the Queen-Mothers==

The apartment of the Pope, located on the first floor of the wing of the Queen Mothers and of the Gros Pavillon, takes its name from the 1804 visit of Pope Pius VII, who stayed there on his way to Paris to crown Napoleon the Emperor of France. He stayed there again, involuntarily, under the close supervision of Napoleon from 1812 to 1814. 

It was originally designed to be the bedroom of Henry II, but after his assassination, it became instead the apartment of his widow, the Queen Mothers Marie de&#x27; Medici and Anne of Austria. It was also the home of Louis, Grand Dauphin, the oldest son of Louis XIV. In the 18th century it was used by the daughters of Louis XV, and then by the Count of Provence, the brother of Louis XVI. During the First Empire it was used by Louis Bonaparte, the brother of Napoleon, and his wife Queen Hortense de Beauharnais, the daughter of the Empress Joséphine. During the reign of Louis-Philippe, it was used by his eldest son, Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans. During the Second Empire, it was occupied by Stéphanie de Beauharnais, the adopted niece of Napoleon I. It was restored in 1859–1861, and used thereafter for guests of high rank. It was originally two apartments, which were divided or joined over the years depending upon its occupants.

Other notable guests in the apartment included James II, the deposed King of England. and the Russian czar Peter the Great (1717). 

The Salon de Reception was the antechamber to the bedroom of Anne of Austria, wife of Louis XIII and mother of Louis XIV. It features a gilded and sculpted ceiling divided into seven compartments, representing the sun and the known planets, along with smaller compartments for military trophies; it was created in 1558 by Ambroise Perret for the bedroom of Henry II in the Pavilion des Poeles, a section of the château that was later destroyed. Anne had it moved to the room and decorated with her own emblems, including a pelican. The wood paneling in the room is probably from the same period.

The decor of the bedroom dates largely to the 1650s; it includes grotesque paintings in compartments on the ceiling, attributed to Charles Errard; richly carved wood paneling featuring oak leaves and putti; and paintings over the doors of Anne of Austria costumed as Minerva and Maria Theresa of Spain costumed as Abundance, both painted by Gilbert de Sève. The bedroom was modified in the 18th century by the addition of a new fireplace (about 1700) and sculptured borders of cascades of flowers around the mirrors added in 1784. During the Second Empire, painted panels imitating the style of the 17th century were added above the mirrors and between the mirrors and the doors.

==Chapel of the Trinity (17th century)==

The Chapel of the Trinity was begun at the end of the reign of Francis I to replace the old chapel of the convent of the Trinitarians. It was finished under Henry II, but was without decoration until 1608, when the painter Martin Freminet was commissioned to design frescoes for the ceiling and walls. The sculptor Barthèlemy Tremblay created the vaults of the ceiling out of stucco and sculpture. The paintings of Freminet in the central vaults depict the redemption of Man, from the appearance of God to Noah at the launching of the Ark (Over the tribune) to the Annunciation. They surrounded these with smaller paintings depicting the ancestors of the Virgin Mary, the kings of Judah, the Patriarchs announcing the coming of Christ, and the Virtues. Between 1613 and 1619 Freminet and Tremblay added paintings in stucco frames between the windows on the sides of the chapel, depicting the life of Christ. Freminet died in 1619 and work did not resume until 1628.

The Trinity chapel, like Sainte-Chapelle in Paris other royal chapels, had an upper section or tribune, where the King and his family sat, with a separate entrance; and a lower part, where the rest of the Court was placed. Beginning in 1628, the side chapels were decorated with iron gates and carved wood panelling, and the Florentine sculptor Francesco Bordoni began work on the marble altar. The figure to the left depicts Charlemagne, with the features of Henry II, while the figure on the right depicts Louis IX, or Saint Louis, with the features of Louis XIII, his patron. Bordoni also designed the multicolored marble pavement before the altar and the on the walls of the nave. The painting of the Holy Trinity over the altar, by Jean Dubois the Elder, was added in 1642. In the mid-17th century the craftsman Anthony Girault made the sculpted wooden doors of the nave. while the Jean Gobert made the doors of the tribune where the royal family worshipped.

In 1741, the royal tribune was enlarged, while ornate balconies of wrought iron were added between the royal tribune and the simpler balconies used by the musicians and those who chanted the mass. In 1779, under Louis XVI, the frescoes of Freminet illustrating the life of Christ, which had deteriorated with time, were replaced by new paintings on the same theme. The paintings were done in the same style by about a dozen painters from the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture.

On 5 September 1725, the chapel was the setting for the wedding of Louis XV and Marie Leszczyńska. Napoleon III was baptized there on 4 November 1810, and Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans, the son of King Louis-Philippe, was married there to Duchess Helene of Mecklenburg-Schwerin on 30 May 1837.

Under Napoleon, the old tabernacle of the chapel, which had been removed during the Revolution, was replaced by a new one designed by the architect Maximilien Joseph Hurtault. Beginning in 1824, the chapel underwent a program of major renovation and restoration that lasted for six years. The twelve paintings of the life of Christ were removed, as well as the gates to the side chapels. During the Second Empire, the wood panelling of side chapels was replaced. The restoration was not completed until the second half of the 20th century, when the twelve paintings, which had been scattered to different museums, were brought together again and restored in their stucco frames. Between 1772 and 1774, a small organ made by François-Henri Cilquot was installed on the left side of the chapel, near the altar.

===Room of the Guards (begun 1570s, redone in 19th century) ===

A room for the guards was always located next to the royal bedchambers. The Salle des Gardes was built during the reign of Charles IX. Some traces of the original decor remain from the 1570s, including the vaulted ceiling and a frieze of military trophies attributed to Ruggiero d&#x27;Ruggieri. In the 19th century Louis Philippe turned the room into a salon and redecorated it with a new parquet floor of exotic woods echoing the design of the ceiling, and a monumental fireplace (1836), which incorporates pieces of ornament from demolished rooms from 15th and early 16th century. The bust of Henry IV, attributed to Mathieu Jacquet, is from that period, as are the two figures on either side of the fireplace. The sculpted frame around the bust, by Pierre Bontemps, was originally in the bedchamber of Henry II. The decorations added by Louis Philippe include a large vase decorated with Renaissance themes, made by the Sèvres porcelain manufactory in 1832. During the reign of Napoleon III, the hall was used as a dining room.

===Gallery of Diana===

The Gallery of Diana, an eighty-meter (242.4 feet) long corridor now lined with bookcases, was created by Henry IV at the beginning of the 17th century as a place for the Queen to promenade. The paintings on the vaulted ceiling, painted beginning in 1605 by Ambroise Dubois and his workshop, represented scenes from the myth of Diana, goddess of the Hunt. At the beginning of the 19th century, the gallery was in ruins. In 1810 Napoleon decided to turn it into a gallery devoted to the achievements of his Empire. A few of the paintings still in good condition were removed and put in the Gallery of Plates. The architect Hurtault designed a new plan for the gallery, inspired by the Grande Galerie of the Louvre, featuring paintings on the ceiling illustrating the great events of Napoleon&#x27;s reign. By 1814 the corridor had been rebuilt and the decorative painted frames painted by Moench and Redouté, but the cycle of paintings on the Empire had not been started, when Napoleon fell from power.

Once the monarchy was restored, King Louis XVIII had the gallery completed in a neoclassical style. A new series of the goddess Diana was done by Merry-Joseph Blondel and Abel de Pujol, using the painted frames prepared for Napoleon&#x27;s cycle. Paintings were also added along the corridor, illustrating the history of the French monarchy, painted in the &quot;Troubador&quot; style of the 1820s and 1830s, painted by a team of the leading academic painters. Beginning in 1853, under Napoleon III, the corridor was turned into a library and most of the paintings were removed, with the exception of a large portrait of Henry IV on horseback by Jean-Baptiste Mauzaisse. The large globe near the entrance of the gallery, placed there in 1861, came from the office of Napoleon in the Tuileries Palace.

==Chinese Museum==

The Chinese Museum, on the ground floor of the &quot;Gros Pavillon&quot; close to the pond, was among the last rooms decorated within the château while it was still an imperial residence. In 1867, the Empress Eugénie had the rooms remade to display her personal collection of Asian art, which included gifts given to the Emperor by a delegation sent by the King of Siam in 1861, and other objects taken during the destruction and looting of the Old Summer Palace near Beijing by a joint British-French military expedition to China in 1860.

The objects displayed in the antechamber include two royal palanquins given by the King of Siam, one designed for a king and the other (with curtains) for a queen. Inside the two salons of the museum, some of the walls are covered with lacquered wood panels in black and gold, taken from 17th century Chinese screens, along with specially designed cases to display antique porcelain vases. Other objects on display include a Tibetan stupa containing a Buddha taken from the Summer Palace in China; and a royal Siamese crown given to Napoleon III. The salons are lavishly decorated with both Asian and European furnishings and art objects, including silk-covered furnishings and Second Empire sculptures by Charles Cordier and Pierre Alexandre Schoenewerk. The room also served as a place for games and entertainment; an old bagatelle game and a mechanical piano from that period are on display.

In addition to the Chinese Museum, the Empress created a small office in 1868, the Salon of Lacquerware, which also decorated with lacquered panels and Asian art objects, on the ground floor of the Louis XV wing, not far from the office of the Emperor. This was the last room decorated before the fall of the Empire, and the eventual transformation of the château into a museum.

==Theatre==
Concerts, plays and other theatrical productions were a regular part of court life at Fontainebleau. Prior to the reign of Louis XV these took place in different rooms of the palace, but during his reign a theatre was built in the Belle-Cheminée wing. It was rebuilt by the architect Gabriel, but was destroyed by a fire in 1856. It had already been judged too small for the court of Napoleon III, and a new theatre had been begun in 1854 at the far eastern end of the wing of Louis XIV. It was designed by architect Hector Lefuel in the Louis XVI style, and was inspired by the Royal Opera of Versailles and the Théâtre de la Reine at the Petit Trianon. The new theatre, with four hundred seats arranged in a parterre, two balconies and boxes in a horseshoe shape, was finished in 1856. It has the original stage machinery, and many of the original sets, including many transferred from the old theatre before the fire of 1856.

The theatre was closed after the end of the Second Empire and was rarely used. A restoration began in 2007, funded with ten million Euros by the government of Abu Dhabi. In exchange, the theatre was renamed for Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. It was inaugurated on 30 April 2014. The theatre can be visited, but it no longer can be used for plays because some working parts of the theater, including the stage, were not included in the restoration. As of April 2024 there is little to be seen in the theatre, except the royal box and empty stage.

==Park and gardens==

The gardens of Fontainebleau illustrate three centuries of French landscape gardening. When Francis I began building the château, he surrounded it with formal gardens. In the 16th century Catherine de&#x27; Medici created a French Renaissance garden, inspired by the Italian Renaissance garden, filled with statuary. Henry IV greatly expanded the gardens. Between 1606 and 1609, Henry built a grand canal that extended for 1200 meters in length, similar to one at the nearby château of Fleury-en-Bière. Louis XIV commissioned André Le Nôtre to create a distinctly classical French formal garden at the end of the 18th century. During the First Empire of Napoleon I, the royal landscape architect, Maximilien Joseph Hurtault, created an English landscape garden with winding paths and picturesque groves of trees. 

On the other side of the château, on the site of the garden of Francis I, Henry IV created a large formal garden, or parterre. Between 1660 and 1664 the chief gardener of Louis XIV, André Le Nôtre, and Louis Le Vau rebuilt the parterre on a grander scale, filling it with geometric designs and paths bordered with boxwood hedges and filled with colorful flowerbeds. They also added a basin called Les Cascades, surrounded by waterfalls, at the head of the canal. Le Nôtre planted shade trees along the length of the canal, and also laid out a wide path, lined with elm trees, parallel to the canal.

The fountains of Louis XIV were removed after his reign. In the 19th century the cascades were decorated with works of classical sculpture. A large ornamental fountain was installed in the central basin in 1817. A bronze replica of an ancient Roman statue, &quot;The Tiber&quot;, was placed in the round basin in 1988. It replaced an earlier statue from the 16th century which earlier had decorated the basin. Two statues of sphinxes by Mathieu Lespagnandel, from 1664, are placed near the balustrade of the grand canal.

===Garden of Diana===

The Garden of Diana, the goddess of the hunt, was created during the reign of Henry IV; it was the private garden of the King and Queen, and was visible from the windows of their rooms. The fountain of Diana was originally in the center of garden, which at that time was enclosed by another wing, containing offices and later, under, Louis XIV, an orangerie. That building, and another, the former chancellery, were demolished in the 19th century, doubling the size of the garden. 
From the 17th until the end of the 18th century, the garden was in the Italian and then the French formal style, divided by straight paths into rectangular flower beds, centered on the fountains and decorated with statues, ornamental plants and citrus trees in pots. It was transformed during the reign of Napoleon I into a landscape garden in the English style, with winding paths and trees grouped into picturesque landscapes, and it was enlarged during the reign of Louis-Philippe. It was opened to the public during the Third Republic. 

The fountain in the center was made by Tommaso Francini, the master Italian fountain-maker, whose work included the Medici Fountain in the Jardin du Luxembourg in Paris. The bronze statue of Diana, the goddess of the hunt, with a young deer, was made by the Keller brothers in 1684 for another royal residence, at Marly. It is a copy of an antique Roman statue, Diana of Versailles, which was given by Pope Paul IV to King Henry IV, and which is now in the Louvre. The original statue of the fountain, made by Barthelemy Prieur in 1602, can be seen in the Gallery of the Deer inside the palace. The sculptures of hunting dogs and deer around the fountain were made by Pierre Biard l&#x27;Aîné.

=== Carp pond and the pavilion===
The large pond next to the palace, with a surface of four hectares, was first stocked with carp during the reign of Henry IV, and was used for boating parties by members of the Court, and as a source of fish for the table and for amusement. Descriptions of the palace in the 17th century tell of guests feeding the carp, some of which reached enormous size, and were said to be a hundred years old. The small octagonal house on an island in the center of the lake, Pavillon de l&#x27;Ètang, was added during the reign of Louis XIV, then rebuilt under Napoleon I, and is decorated with his initial.

=== English garden === 

The garden was originally created by Francis I as the Pine Garden. At the far corner of the English garden close to the palace is the only remaining element of the original gardens of Francis I; the first Renaissance-style grotto to be built in a French garden, decorated with four statues of Atlas.

Under Napoleon&#x27;s landscape architect, Maximilien Joseph Hurtault, this part of the garden was developed into an English park, with winding paths and exotic trees, including planting of catalpa, tulip trees, sophora and cypress trees from Louisiana, and introduction of a picturesque stream and antique boulders. The garden features two 17th century bronze copies of ancient Roman originals, the &quot;Borghese Gladiator&quot; and the &quot;Dying Gaul&quot;. 
A path leads from the garden through a curtain of trees to the Belle-Eau Fountain or &quot;Fontaine Belle-Eau&quot; (&quot;Spring of beautiful water&quot;), a natural spring which in the 17th century gave its name to the palace and gardens. The fountain was rebuilt with an octagonal basin in 1891 and a classical statue of Hera, or the &quot;Naiad of Belle-Eau, was added close by. In the 1980s, to bring more contemporary art into the gardens, a group of statues of mythical figures entirely unrelated to the château&#x27;s history was placed close around the fountain.

== Art and decoration – the School of Fontainebleau ==
During the late French Renaissance, the decoration of the Palace of Fontainebleau engaged some of the finest artists and craftsmen from Italy and France. The style of painting and decoration they created became known as the School of Fontainebleau, and covered a period from about 1530 until about 1610. It helped form the French version of Northern Mannerism.
In 1531, the Florentine artist Rosso Fiorentino, having lost most of his possessions at the Sack of Rome in 1527, was invited by Francis I to work on the interior of the palace. In 1532 he was joined by another Italian artist, Francesco Primaticcio (from Bologna). Rosso died in France in 1540. On the advice of Primaticcio, Niccolò dell&#x27;Abbate (from Modena) was invited to France in 1552 by François&#x27;s son Henry II. Other notable artists included: 
*Juste de Juste (c.1505–1559), Franco-Italian sculptor and etcher
*Luca Penni (c.1500/1504–1556), Italian painter
*Francesco Scibec da Carpi (died c.1557), Italian furniture maker
*Benvenuto Cellini (1500–1570), Italian sculptor, goldsmith, silversmith

The works of this &quot;first school of Fontainebleau&quot; are characterized by the extensive use of stucco (moldings and picture frames) and frescos, and an elaborate (and often mysterious) system of allegories and mythological iconography. Renaissance decorative motifs such as grotesques, strapwork and putti are common, as well as a certain degree of eroticism. The figures are elegant and show the influence of the techniques of the Italian Mannerism of Michelangelo, Raphael and especially Parmigianino. Primaticcio was also directed to make copies of antique Roman statues for the king, thus spreading the influence of classical statuary. Many of the works of Rosso, Primaticcio and Niccolò dell&#x27;Abbate have not survived as parts of the château were remodelled at various dates. The paintings of the group were reproduced in prints, mostly etchings, which were apparently produced initially at Fontainebleau itself, and later in Paris. These disseminated the style through France and beyond, and also record several paintings that have not survived.

From 1584 to 1594, during the Wars of Religion work inside the palace was abandoned. Upon his ascension to the throne, Henry IV undertook a renovation of the Fontainebleau buildings using a group of artists: the Flemish born Ambroise Dubois (from Antwerp) and the Parisians Toussaint Dubreuil and Martin Fréminet. They are sometimes referred to as the &quot;second school of Fontainebleau&quot;. Their late mannerist works, many of which have been lost, continued in the use of elongated and undulating forms and crowded compositions. Many of their subjects include mythological scenes and scenes from works of fiction by the Italian Torquato Tasso and the ancient Greek novelist Heliodorus of Emesa. 

The important artists of the second school (from 1594) were:
*Ambroise Dubois (c.1542–1614) (Flemish born)
*Toussaint Dubreuil (c.1561–1602)
*Martin Fréminet (1567–1619)

The mannerist style of the Fontainebleau school influenced French artists (with whom the Italians worked) such as the painter Jean Cousin the Elder, the sculptors Jean Goujon and Germain Pilon, and, to a lesser degree, the painter and portraitist François Clouet the son of Jean Clouet. The Fontainebleau style combined allegorical paintings in moulded plasterwork where the framing was treated as if it were leather or paper, slashed and rolled into scrolls and combined with arabesques and grotesques. Fontainebleau ideals of female beauty are Mannerist: a small neat head on a long neck, exaggeratedly long torso and limbs, small high breasts—almost a return to Late Gothic beauties. The new works at Fontainebleau were recorded in refined and detailed engravings that circulated among connoisseurs and artists. Through the engravings by the &quot;School of Fontainebleau&quot; this new style was transmitted to other northern European centers, Antwerp especially, Germany, and eventually London.

While Louis XIV spent more time at Fontainebleau than any other monarch, he made most of his modifications to gardens, rather than the interiors and decor. In the 18th century, interiors underwent major changes in style. Between 1750 and 1754, the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel built a new residential wing and new apartments for Louis XV and the Queen. The most famous artists of the period, including François Boucher, Charles-André van Loo, Alexis Peyrotte and Jean-Baptiste Marie Pierre were commissioned to paint works for the Council Chamber. Louis XVI continued the decoration work, particularly in the Turkish cabinet (1777) and the game room and boudoir of the Queen (1786–1787), in an arabesque style up to the eve of the Revolution. Fontainebleau offers many of the best examples of interior design at the end of the Ancien régime.

Napoleon I wished to continue the traditional grandeur of the monarchy, and had the palace completely refurnished. He created a new suite of rooms with the symbols and style of the Empire, and transformed the former king&#x27;s bedroom into his throne room. It is the only throne room in France which is still in its original state with its original furniture. The rooms Napoleon used at Fontainebleau are among the best existing examples of the Empire style.


==Museum of Napoleon I==

The Museum of Napoleon I was created in 1986 in the wing on the right side of the Court of Honor, where the apartments of the princes of the First Empire had been located. It includes a gallery of portraits of members of Napoleon&#x27;s family, medals and decorations, several costumes worn during Napoleon&#x27;s coronation as Emperor, and a gold leaf from the crown he wore during the coronation; a large collection of porcelain and decorative objectives from the Imperial dining table, and a cradle, toys, and other souvenirs from the Emperor&#x27;s son, the King of Rome. It also has a collection of souvenirs from his military campaigns, including a recreation of his tent and its furnishings and practical items which he took with him on his campaigns.

Proxima Centauri is the nearest star to Earth after the Sun, located 4.25 light-years away in the southern constellation of Centaurus. This object was discovered in 1915 by Robert Innes. It is a small, low-mass star, too faint to be seen with the naked eye, with an apparent magnitude of 11.13. Its Latin name means the &#x27;nearest [star] of Centaurus&#x27;. Proxima Centauri is a member of the Alpha Centauri star system, being identified as component Alpha Centauri C, and is 2.18° to the southwest of the Alpha Centauri AB pair. It is currently from AB, which it orbits with a period of about 550,000 years.

Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf star with a mass about 12.5% of the Sun&#x27;s mass (), and average density about 33 times that of the Sun. Because of Proxima Centauri&#x27;s proximity to Earth, its angular diameter can be measured directly. Its actual diameter is about one-seventh (14%) the diameter of the Sun. Although it has a very low average luminosity, Proxima Centauri is a flare star that randomly undergoes dramatic increases in brightness because of magnetic activity. The star&#x27;s magnetic field is created by convection throughout the stellar body, and the resulting flare activity generates a total X-ray emission similar to that produced by the Sun. The internal mixing of its fuel by convection through its core and Proxima&#x27;s relatively low energy-production rate, mean that it will be a main-sequence star for another four trillion years.

Proxima Centauri has one known exoplanet and two candidate exoplanets: Proxima Centauri b, the candidate Proxima Centauri d and the disputed Proxima Centauri c. Proxima Centauri b orbits the star at a distance of roughly with an orbital period of approximately 11.2 Earth days. Its estimated mass is at least 1.07 times that of Earth. Proxima b orbits within Proxima Centauri&#x27;s habitable zone—the range where temperatures are right for liquid water to exist on its surface—but, because Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf and a flare star, the planet&#x27;s habitability is highly uncertain. A candidate super-Earth, Proxima Centauri c, roughly away from Proxima Centauri, orbits it every . A candidate sub-Earth, Proxima Centauri d, roughly away, orbits it every 5.1 days.

==General characteristics==

Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf, because it belongs to the main sequence on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and is of spectral class M5.5. The M5.5 class means that it falls in the low-mass end of M-type dwarf stars, with its hue shifted toward red-yellow by an effective temperature of . Its absolute visual magnitude, or its visual magnitude as viewed from a distance of , is 15.5. Its total luminosity over all wavelengths is only 0.16% that of the Sun, although when observed in the wavelengths of visible light to which the eye is most sensitive, it is only 0.0056% as luminous as the Sun. More than 85% of its radiated power is at infrared wavelengths.

In 2002, optical interferometry with the Very Large Telescope (VLTI) found that the angular diameter of Proxima Centauri is . Because its distance is known, the actual diameter of Proxima Centauri can be calculated to be about 1/7 that of the Sun, or 1.5 times that of Jupiter. The star&#x27;s mass, estimated from stellar theory, is , or 129 Jupiter masses (). The mass has been calculated directly, although with less precision, from observations of microlensing events to be .

Lower mass main-sequence stars have higher mean density than higher mass ones, and Proxima Centauri is no exception: it has a mean density of , compared with the Sun&#x27;s mean density of . The measured surface gravity of Proxima Centauri, given as the base-10 logarithm of the acceleration in units of cgs, is 5.20. This is 162 times the surface gravity on Earth.

A 1998 study of photometric variations indicates that Proxima Centauri completes a full rotation once every 83.5 days. A subsequent time series analysis of chromospheric indicators in 2002 suggests a longer rotation period of  days. Later observations of the star&#x27;s magnetic field subsequently revealed that the star rotates with a period of  days, consistent with a measurement of  days from radial velocity observations.

== Structure and fusion ==
Because of its low mass, the interior of the star is completely convective, causing energy to be transferred to the exterior by the physical movement of plasma rather than through radiative processes. This convection means that the helium ash left over from the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen does not accumulate at the core but is instead circulated throughout the star. Unlike the Sun, which will only burn through about 10% of its total hydrogen supply before leaving the main sequence, Proxima Centauri will consume nearly all of its fuel before the fusion of hydrogen comes to an end.

Convection is associated with the generation and persistence of a magnetic field. The magnetic energy from this field is released at the surface through stellar flares that briefly (as short as per ten seconds) increase the overall luminosity of the star. On May 6, 2019, a flare event bordering Solar M and X flare class, briefly became the brightest ever detected, with a far ultraviolet emission of . These flares can grow as large as the star and reach temperatures measured as high as 27 million K—hot enough to radiate X-rays. Proxima Centauri&#x27;s quiescent X-ray luminosity, approximately (4–16) erg/s ((4–16) W), is roughly equal to that of the much larger Sun. The peak X-ray luminosity of the largest flares can reach  erg/s ( W).

Proxima Centauri&#x27;s chromosphere is active, and its spectrum displays a strong emission line of singly ionized magnesium at a wavelength of 280 nm. About 88% of the surface of Proxima Centauri may be active, a percentage that is much higher than that of the Sun even at the peak of the solar cycle. Even during quiescent periods with few or no flares, this activity increases the corona temperature of Proxima Centauri to 3.5 million K, compared to the 2 million K of the Sun&#x27;s corona, and its total X-ray emission is comparable to the sun&#x27;s. Proxima Centauri&#x27;s overall activity level is considered low compared to other red dwarfs, which is consistent with the star&#x27;s estimated age of 4.85 years, since the activity level of a red dwarf is expected to steadily wane over billions of years as its stellar rotation rate decreases. The activity level appears to vary with a period of roughly 442 days, which is shorter than the Sun&#x27;s solar cycle of 11 years.

Proxima Centauri has a relatively weak stellar wind, no more than 20% of the mass loss rate of the solar wind. Because the star is much smaller than the Sun, the mass loss per unit surface area from Proxima Centauri may be eight times that from the Sun&#x27;s surface.

== Life phases ==
A red dwarf with the mass of Proxima Centauri will remain on the main sequence for about four trillion years. As the proportion of helium increases because of hydrogen fusion, the star will become smaller and hotter, gradually transforming into a so-called &quot;blue dwarf&quot;. Near the end of this period it will become significantly more luminous, reaching 2.5% of the Sun&#x27;s luminosity () and warming any orbiting bodies for a period of several billion years. When the hydrogen fuel is exhausted, Proxima Centauri will then evolve into a helium white dwarf (without passing through the red giant phase) and steadily lose any remaining heat energy.

The Alpha Centauri system may have formed through a low-mass star being dynamically captured by a more massive binary of within their embedded star cluster before the cluster dispersed. However, more accurate measurements of the radial velocity are needed to confirm this hypothesis. If Proxima Centauri was bound to the Alpha Centauri system during its formation, the stars are likely to share the same elemental composition. The gravitational influence of Proxima might have disturbed the Alpha Centauri protoplanetary disks. This would have increased the delivery of volatiles such as water to the dry inner regions, so possibly enriching any terrestrial planets in the system with this material.

Alternatively, Proxima Centauri may have been captured at a later date during an encounter, resulting in a highly eccentric orbit that was then stabilized by the galactic tide and additional stellar encounters. Such a scenario may mean that Proxima Centauri&#x27;s planetary companions have had a much lower chance for orbital disruption by Alpha Centauri. As the members of the Alpha Centauri pair continue to evolve and lose mass, Proxima Centauri is predicted to become unbound from the system in around 3.5 billion years from the present. Thereafter, the star will steadily diverge from the pair.

== Motion and location ==
Based on a parallax of , published in 2020 in Gaia Data Release 3, Proxima Centauri is from the Sun. Previously published parallaxes include: in 2018 by Gaia DR2, , in 2014 by the Research Consortium On Nearby Stars; , in the original Hipparcos Catalogue, in 1997; in the Hipparcos New Reduction, in 2007; and using the Hubble Space Telescope fine guidance sensors, in 1999. From Earth&#x27;s vantage point, Proxima Centauri is separated from Alpha Centauri by 2.18 degrees, or four times the angular diameter of the full Moon. Proxima Centauri has a relatively large proper motion—moving 3.85 arcseconds per year across the sky. It has a radial velocity towards the Sun of 22.2 km/s. From Proxima Centauri, the Sun would appear as a bright 0.4-magnitude star in the constellation Cassiopeia, similar to that of Achernar or Procyon from Earth.

Among the known stars, Proxima Centauri has been the closest star to the Sun for about 32,000 years and will be so for about another 25,000 years, after which Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B will alternate approximately every 79.91 years as the closest star to the Sun. In 2001, J. García-Sánchez &quot;et al.&quot; predicted that Proxima Centauri will make its closest approach to the Sun in approximately 26,700 years, coming within . A 2010 study by V. V. Bobylev predicted a closest approach distance of in about 27,400 years, followed by a 2014 study by C. A. L. Bailer-Jones predicting a perihelion approach of in roughly 26,710 years. Proxima Centauri is orbiting through the Milky Way at a distance from the Galactic Centre that varies from , with an orbital eccentricity of 0.07.

=== Alpha Centauri ===

Proxima Centauri has been suspected to be a companion of the Alpha Centauri binary star system since its discovery in 1915. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as Alpha Centauri C. Data from the Hipparcos satellite, combined with ground-based observations, were consistent with the hypothesis that the three stars are a gravitationally bound system. Kervella et al. (2017) used high-precision radial velocity measurements to determine with a high degree of confidence that Proxima and Alpha Centauri are gravitationally bound. Proxima Centauri&#x27;s orbital period around the Alpha Centauri AB barycenter is years with an eccentricity of ; it approaches Alpha Centauri to at periastron and retreats to at apastron. At present, Proxima Centauri is from the Alpha Centauri AB barycenter, nearly to the furthest point in its orbit.

Six single stars, two binary star systems, and a triple star share a common motion through space with Proxima Centauri and the Alpha Centauri system. (The co-moving stars include HD 4391, γ2 Normae, and Gliese 676.) The space velocities of these stars are all within 10 km/s of Alpha Centauri&#x27;s peculiar motion. Thus, they may form a moving group of stars, which would indicate a common point of origin, such as in a star cluster.

==Planetary system==


As of 2022, three planets (one confirmed and two candidates) have been detected in orbit around Proxima Centauri, with one possibly being among the lightest ever detected by radial velocity (&quot;d&quot;), one close to Earth&#x27;s size within the habitable zone (&quot;b&quot;), and a possible gas dwarf that orbits much further out than the inner two (&quot;c&quot;), although its status remains disputed.

Searches for exoplanets around Proxima Centauri date to the late 1970s. In the 1990s, multiple measurements of Proxima Centauri&#x27;s radial velocity constrained the maximum mass that a detectable companion could possess.
The activity level of the star adds noise to the radial velocity measurements, complicating detection of a companion using this method.
In 1998, an examination of Proxima Centauri using the Faint Object Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope appeared to show evidence of a companion orbiting at a distance of about 0.5 AU.
A subsequent search using the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 failed to locate any companions. Astrometric measurements at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory appear to rule out a Jupiter-sized planet with an orbital period of 2−12 years.

In 2017, a team of astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array reported detecting a belt of cold dust orbiting Proxima Centauri at a range of 1−4 AU from the star. This dust has a temperature of around 40 K and has a total estimated mass of 1% of the planet Earth. They tentatively detected two additional features: a cold belt with a temperature of 10 K orbiting around 30 AU and a compact emission source about 1.2 arcseconds from the star. There was a hint at an additional warm dust belt at a distance of 0.4 AU from the star. However, upon further analysis, these emissions were determined to be most likely the result of a large flare emitted by the star in March 2017. The presence of dust within 4 AU radius from the star is not needed to model the observations.

===Planet b===
Proxima Centauri b, or Alpha Centauri Cb, orbits the star at a distance of roughly with an orbital period of approximately 11.2 Earth days. Its estimated mass is at least 1.07 times that of the Earth. Moreover, the equilibrium temperature of Proxima Centauri b is estimated to be within the range where water could exist as liquid on its surface; thus, placing it within the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri.

The first indications of the exoplanet Proxima Centauri b were found in 2013 by Mikko Tuomi of the University of Hertfordshire from archival observation data. To confirm the possible discovery, a team of astronomers launched the Pale Red Dot
project in January 2016.
 On 24 August 2016, the team of 31 scientists from all around the world,
led by Guillem Anglada-Escudé of Queen Mary University of London, confirmed the existence of Proxima Centauri b
through a peer-reviewed article published in &quot;Nature&quot;.
The measurements were performed using two spectrographs: HARPS on the ESO 3.6 m Telescope at La Silla Observatory and UVES on the 8 m Very Large Telescope at Paranal Observatory. Several attempts to detect a transit of this planet across the face of Proxima Centauri have been made. A transit-like signal appearing on 8 September 2016, was tentatively identified, using the Bright Star Survey Telescope at the Zhongshan Station in Antarctica.

In 2016, in a paper that helped to confirm Proxima Centauri b&#x27;s existence, a second signal in the range of 60–500 days was detected. However, stellar activity and inadequate sampling causes its nature to remain unclear.

===Planet c===
Proxima Centauri c is a candidate super-Earth or gas dwarf about orbiting at roughly every . If Proxima Centauri b were the star&#x27;s Earth, Proxima Centauri c would be equivalent to Neptune. Due to its large distance from Proxima Centauri, it is unlikely to be habitable, with a low equilibrium temperature of around 39 K. The planet was first reported by Italian astrophysicist Mario Damasso and his colleagues in April 2019.
Damasso&#x27;s team had noticed minor movements of Proxima Centauri in the radial velocity data from the ESO&#x27;s HARPS instrument, indicating a possible additional planet orbiting Proxima Centauri. In 2020, the planet&#x27;s existence was confirmed by Hubble astrometry data from .
A possible direct imaging counterpart was detected in the infrared with the SPHERE, but the authors admit that they &quot;did not obtain a clear detection.&quot; If their candidate source is in fact Proxima Centauri c, it is too bright for a planet of its mass and age, implying that the planet may have a ring system with a radius of around However, disputed the radial velocity confirmation of the planet.

===Planet d===
In 2019, a team of astronomers revisited the data from ESPRESSO about Proxima Centauri b to refine its mass. While doing so, the team found another radial velocity spike with a periodicity of 5.15 days. They estimated that if it were a planetary companion, it would be no less than 0.29 Earth masses. Further analysis confirmed the signal&#x27;s existence leading up to the announcement of the candidate planet in February 2022.

===Habitability===
Before the discovery of Proxima Centauri b, the TV documentary &quot;Alien Worlds&quot; hypothesized that a life-sustaining planet could exist in orbit around Proxima Centauri or other red dwarfs. Such a planet would lie within the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, about from the star, and would have an orbital period of 3.6–14 days.
A planet orbiting within this zone may experience tidal locking to the star. If the orbital eccentricity of this hypothetical planet were low, Proxima Centauri would move little in the planet&#x27;s sky, and most of the surface would experience either day or night perpetually. The presence of an atmosphere could serve to redistribute heat from the star-lit side to the far side of the planet.

Proxima Centauri&#x27;s flare outbursts could erode the atmosphere of any planet in its habitable zone, but the documentary&#x27;s scientists thought that this obstacle could be overcome. Gibor Basri of the University of California, Berkeley argued: &quot;No one [has] found any showstoppers to habitability.&quot; For example, one concern was that the torrents of charged particles from the star&#x27;s flares could strip the atmosphere off any nearby planet. If the planet had a strong magnetic field, the field would deflect the particles from the atmosphere; even the slow rotation of a tidally locked planet that spins once for every time it orbits its star would be enough to generate a magnetic field, as long as part of the planet&#x27;s interior remained molten.

Other scientists, especially proponents of the Rare Earth hypothesis, disagree that red dwarfs can sustain life. Any exoplanet in this star&#x27;s habitable zone would likely be tidally locked, resulting in a relatively weak planetary magnetic moment, leading to strong atmospheric erosion by coronal mass ejections from Proxima Centauri. In December 2020, a candidate SETI radio signal BLC-1 was announced as potentially coming from the star. The signal was later determined to be human-made radio interference.

== Observational history ==
In 1915, the Scottish astronomer Robert Innes, director of the Union Observatory in Johannesburg, South Africa, discovered a star that had the same proper motion as Alpha Centauri. He suggested that it be named &quot;Proxima Centauri&quot; (actually &quot;Proxima Centaurus&quot;). In 1917, at the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope, the Dutch astronomer Joan Voûte measured the star&#x27;s trigonometric parallax at and determined that Proxima Centauri was approximately the same distance from the Sun as Alpha Centauri. It was the lowest-luminosity star known at the time. An equally accurate parallax determination of Proxima Centauri was made by American astronomer Harold L. Alden in 1928, who confirmed Innes&#x27;s view that it is closer, with a parallax of .

A size estimate for Proxima Centauri was obtained by the Canadian astronomer John Stanley Plaskett in 1925 using interferometry. The result was 207,000 miles (333,000 km), or approximately .

In 1951, American astronomer Harlow Shapley announced that Proxima Centauri is a flare star. Examination of past photographic records showed that the star displayed a measurable increase in magnitude on about 8% of the images, making it the most active flare star then known.
The proximity of the star allows for detailed observation of its flare activity. In 1980, the Einstein Observatory produced a detailed X-ray energy curve of a stellar flare on Proxima Centauri. Further observations of flare activity were made with the EXOSAT and ROSAT satellites, and the X-ray emissions of smaller, solar-like flares were observed by the Japanese ASCA satellite in 1995. Proxima Centauri has since been the subject of study by most X-ray observatories, including XMM-Newton and Chandra.

Because of Proxima Centauri&#x27;s southern declination, it can only be viewed south of latitude 27° N. Red dwarfs such as Proxima Centauri are too faint to be seen with the naked eye. Even from Alpha Centauri A or B, Proxima would only be seen as a fifth magnitude star. It has apparent visual magnitude 11, so a telescope with an aperture of at least is needed to observe it, even under ideal viewing conditions—under clear, dark skies with Proxima Centauri well above the horizon. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name &quot;Proxima Centauri&quot; for this star on August 21, 2016, and it is now so included in the List of IAU approved Star Names.

In 2016, a superflare was observed from Proxima Centauri, the strongest flare ever seen. The optical brightness increased by a factor of 68× to approximately magnitude 6.8. It is estimated that similar flares occur around five times every year but are of such short duration, just a few minutes, that they have never been observed before. On 2020 April 22 and 23, the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft took images of two of the nearest stars, Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359. When compared with Earth-based images, a very large parallax effect was easily visible. However, this was only used for illustrative purposes and did not improve on previous distance measurements.

== Future exploration ==

Because of the star&#x27;s proximity to Earth, Proxima Centauri has been proposed as a flyby destination for interstellar travel. If non-nuclear, conventional propulsion technologies are used, the flight of a spacecraft to Proxima Centauri and its planets would probably require thousands of years. For example, &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, which is now travelling relative to the Sun, would reach Proxima Centauri in 73,775 years, were the spacecraft travelling in the direction of that star and Proxima was standing still. Proxima&#x27;s actual galactic orbit means a slow-moving probe would have only several tens of thousands of years to catch the star at its closest approach, before it recedes out of reach.

Nuclear pulse propulsion might enable such interstellar travel with a trip timescale of a century, inspiring several studies such as Project Orion, Project Daedalus, and Project Longshot. Project Breakthrough Starshot aims to reach the Alpha Centauri system within the first half of the 21st century, with microprobes travelling at 20% of the speed of light propelled by around 100 gigawatts of Earth-based lasers. The probes would perform a fly-by of Proxima Centauri about 20 years after its launch, or possibly go into orbit after about 140 years if swing-by&#x27;s around Proxima Centauri or Alpha Centauri are to be employed. Then the probes would take photos and collect data of the planets of the stars, and their atmospheric compositions. It would take 4.25 years for the information collected to be sent back to Earth.

<text>Fife ( , ; ; ) is a council area, historic county, registration county and lieutenancy area of Scotland. It is situated between the Firth of Tay and the Firth of Forth, with inland boundaries with Perth and Kinross (i.e., the historic counties of Perthshire and Kinross-shire) and Clackmannanshire. By custom it is widely held to have been one of the major Pictish kingdoms, known as &quot;Fib&quot;, and is still commonly known as the Kingdom of Fife within Scotland. A person from Fife is known as a &quot;Fifer&quot;. In older documents the county was very occasionally known by the anglicisation Fifeshire.

Fife is Scotland&#x27;s largest local authority area by population. It had a resident population of in , over a third of whom live in the three principal settlements, Dunfermline, Kirkcaldy and Glenrothes. On the northeast coast of Fife lies the historic town of St Andrews, home to the University of St Andrews—the most ancient university of Scotland and one of the oldest universities in the world—and the Old Course at St Andrews, considered the world&#x27;s oldest golf course.

==History==
Fife, bounded to the north by the Firth of Tay and to the south by the Firth of Forth, is a natural peninsula whose political boundaries have changed little over the ages. The Pictish king list and De Situ Albanie documents of the Poppleton manuscript mention the division of the Pictish realm or Albany into seven sub-kingdoms, one being Fife. The earliest known reference to the common epithet &quot;The Kingdom of Fife&quot; dates from only 1678, in a proposition that the term derives from the quasi-regal privileges of the Earl of Fife. The notion of a kingdom may derive from a misinterpretation of an extract from Wyntoun. The name is recorded as &quot;Fib&quot; in A.D. 1150 and &quot;Fif&quot; in 1165. It was often associated with Fothriff.

The hill-fort of Clatchard Craig, near Newburgh, was occupied as an important Pictish stronghold between the sixth and eighth centuries AD.

Fife was an important royal and political centre from the reign of King Malcolm III onwards, as the leaders of Scotland gradually moved southwards away from their ancient strongholds around Scone. Malcolm had his principal home in Dunfermline and his wife Margaret was the main benefactor of Dunfermline Abbey. The Abbey replaced Iona as the final resting place of Scotland&#x27;s royal elite, with Robert I amongst those to be buried there.

The Earl of Fife was until the 15th century considered the principal peer of the Scottish realm, and reserved the right of crowning the nation&#x27;s monarchs, reflecting the prestige of the area.

A new royal palace was gradually constructed at Falkland, formerly the stronghold of Clan MacDuff, and was used by successive monarchs of the House of Stuart, who favoured Fife for its rich hunting grounds.

King James VI of Scotland described Fife, in the golden fringe being the coast and its chain of little ports with their thriving fishing fleets and rich trading links with the Low Countries. Wool, linen, coal and salt were all traded. Salt pans heated by local coal were historically a feature of the Fife coast. The distinctive red clay pan tiles seen on many old buildings in Fife arrived as ballast on trading boats and replaced the previously thatched roofs.

In 1598, King James VI employed a group of 11 men from Fife, who became known as the Fife adventurers, to colonise the Isle of Lewis in an attempt to begin the &quot;civilisation&quot; and de-gaelicisation of the region. This endeavour lasted until 1609 when the colonists, having been opposed by the native population, were bought out by Kenneth Mackenzie, the clan chief of the Mackenzies.

Fife became a centre of heavy industry in the 19th century. Coal had been mined in the area since at least the 12th century, but the number of pits increased ten-fold as demand for coal grew in the Victorian period. Previously rural villages such as Cowdenbeath rapidly swelled into towns as thousands moved to Fife to find work in its mines. The opening of the Forth and Tay rail bridges linked Fife with Dundee and Edinburgh and allowed the rapid transport of goods. Modern ports were constructed at Methil, Burntisland and Rosyth. Kirkcaldy became the world centre for the production of linoleum. Postwar Fife saw the development of Scotland&#x27;s second new town, Glenrothes. Originally to provide housing for miners at a new coal mine, the town eventually attracted a high number of modern Silicon Glen companies to the region. Fife Council and Fife Constabulary also centre their operations in Glenrothes.

There are numerous notable historical buildings in Fife, some of which are managed by the National Trust for Scotland or Historic Scotland. They include Dunfermline Abbey (the last resting place of Scottish royalty), the palace in Culross, Ravenscraig Castle in Kirkcaldy, Dysart Harbour area, Balgonie Castle near Coaltown of Balgonie, Falkland Palace (hunting palace of the Scottish Kings), Kellie Castle near Pittenweem, Hill of Tarvit (a historical house), St. Andrews Castle, St. Andrews Cathedral and St. Rule&#x27;s Tower.

===Administrative history===

Fife was one of the ancient provinces of Scotland, under the authority of the Mormaer or Earl of Fife. The early province of Fife appears to have covered only that part of the later county lying east of a line from Newburgh to Scoonie. The western part of the later county was in the province of Fothriff, which also covered areas that would later become Kinross-shire and part of Clackmannanshire, including the town of Clackmannan. By the early thirteenth century Fothriff had been joined to the earldom of Fife. Sometime between the reign of David I (reigned 1124–1153) and the mid-thirteenth century, this part of Scotland was divided into shires, being areas administered by a sheriff. Kinross and Clackmannan were each given their own sheriffs, whilst the rest of the Fife and Fothriff area was placed under the authority of the Sheriff of Fife.

Over time, Scotland&#x27;s shires became more significant than the old provinces, with more administrative functions being given to the sheriffs. The larger earldom of Fife, including Kinross and Clackmannan, was therefore gradually eclipsed in importance by the smaller shire of Fife. In 1667 Commissioners of Supply were established for each shire, which would serve as the main administrative body for the area until the creation of county councils in 1890. Following the Acts of Union in 1707, the English term &quot;county&quot; came to be used interchangeably with the older term &quot;shire&quot;.

Elected county councils were established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking most of the functions of the commissioners (which were eventually abolished in 1930). The two burghs of Dunfermline and Kirkcaldy were deemed capable of managing their own affairs and so were excluded from the administrative area of the county council. The 1889 act also led to a review of boundaries, with several exclaves being transferred to a county they actually bordered, and parishes which straddled more than one county being adjusted such that each parish was entirely in a single county. These changes saw some adjustments to Fife&#x27;s boundaries with Kinross-shire and Perthshire, with the most significant change being that Fife gained the two parishes of Culross and Tulliallan, which had previously formed an exclave of Perthshire. Dunfermline and Kirkcaldy were brought within the administrative area of the county council in 1930, but classed as large burghs, allowing them to continue to deliver many local government functions themselves.
Fife County Council was based at County Buildings in Catherine Street in Cupar, which had been built in 1817 as the county&#x27;s sheriff court and meeting place for the commissioners of supply, replacing the town&#x27;s medieval tolbooth which had performed the same functions.

Fife County Council was abolished in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which replaced Scotland&#x27;s counties, burghs and landward districts with a two-tier structure of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Fife region was created covering the same area as the county, divided into three districts: Dunfermline, Kirkcaldy and North-East Fife. In 1996 the district councils were abolished and Fife Regional Council became a unitary authority known as Fife Council. Fife is one of the six local authorities in the city region of Edinburgh and southeast Scotland.

There was a parliamentary constituency of Fife in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom until 1885 and the Fife constituency in the Parliament of Scotland until the Acts of Union 1707.

==Governance==
Fife is represented by five constituency members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) and four members of the United Kingdom parliament (MPs) who are sent to Holyrood and the British Parliament respectively. Following the 2015 general election, all four of the MPs constituencies were held by the Scottish National Party. In the 2017 general election, Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath was regained by Labour. At the same election, the seat of North East Fife became the closest seat in the country with the SNP holding a majority of 2 over the Liberal Democrats. Three of the Scottish Parliament constituencies are held by the Scottish National Party: Cowdenbeath, Dunfermline and Mid Fife and Glenrothes. One is held by the Scottish Liberal Democrats: North East Fife.

Fife Council&#x27;s administrative headquarters and Police Scotland&#x27;s P Division (formerly Fife Constabulary) are based in Glenrothes. The Council meetings take place in Fife House in the town centre. The west wing of the building was built by the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC) as their offices in 1969, which was later used as the headquarters of Fife Regional Council from shortly after its creation in 1975.

==Geography==


Fife is a peninsula in eastern Scotland bordered on the north by the Firth of Tay, on the east by the North Sea and by the Firth of Forth to the south. The route to the west is partially blocked by the mass of the Ochil Hills. Almost all road traffic into and out of Fife has to pass over one of four bridges, south on the Forth Road Bridge (public transport and cyclists only) and Queensferry Crossing, west on the Kincardine Bridge or north-east via the Tay Road Bridge, the exception being traffic headed north on the M90. Tolls were abolished on the Tay Road Bridge and Forth Road Bridge on 11 February 2008.

There are extinct volcanic features, such as the Lomond Hills which rise above rolling farmland, and Largo Law, a volcanic plug in the east. At , the West Lomond is the highest point in Fife. The coast has fine but small harbours, from the industrial docks in Burntisland and Rosyth to the fishing villages of the East Neuk such as Anstruther and Pittenweem. The large area of flat land to the north of the Lomond Hills, through which the River Eden flows, is known as the Howe of Fife.
North of the Lomond Hills can be found villages and small towns in a primarily agricultural landscape. The areas in the south and west of Fife, including the towns of Dunfermline, Glenrothes, Kirkcaldy and the Levenmouth region are lightly industrial and more densely populated. The only areas which could claim to be heavily industrial are Rosyth, around the naval dockyard and perhaps the Mossmorran Natural Gas Liquids fractionation plant on the outskirts of Cowdenbeath.

The east corner of Fife, along the string of villages between Earlsferry and Kingsbarns, and along with their hinterland, is known as the East Neuk (corner, or projecting point of land) of Fife; small settlements around sheltered harbours, with distinctive vernacular &quot;Dutch&quot; or corbie (crow) stepped gabled and stone-built architecture. The area has amongst the highest concentration of second homes and holiday lets in Scotland. The fishing industry, on which the coastal East Neuk settlements were built, has declined in recent years with the main fishing fleet now operating from Pittenweem and the harbour in Anstruther being used as a marina for pleasure craft.

There are several islands located off the coast of Fife, such as the Isle of May, Inchkeith and Inchcolm. The former Preston Island south of Valleyfield is no longer an island following land reclamation work.

==Demography==

==Settlements==
Cupar took over as county town from Crail in the early 13th century. Glenrothes is now the administrative centre, after the decision to locate the headquarters of the newly established Fife Regional Council there in 1975. Fife&#x27;s three major towns are Kirkcaldy, Dunfermline (awarded city status in 2022) and Glenrothes. According to the 2012 estimate, Dunfermline is the largest settlement by population, followed by Kirkcaldy then Glenrothes. The next most sizeable towns by population are St Andrews, Cowdenbeath, Rosyth, Methil and Dalgety Bay.

==Culture==


Fife contains 4,961 listed buildings and 48 conservation areas. Domestic sites of importance include Falkland Palace, Kellie Castle, Dunfermline Palace, St Andrews Castle, Culross Palace and Kirkcaldy&#x27;s Ravenscraig Castle. Fife also has a number of ecclesiastical sites of historical interest. St Andrews Cathedral was home to the powerful Archbishopric of St Andrews, and later became a centre of the Scottish Reformation, while Dunfermline Abbey was the last resting place of a number of Scottish kings. Balmerino and Culross abbeys were both founded in the 13th century by the Cistercians, while a century before Lindores Abbey was founded by the Tironensians outside Newburgh; all were highly important sites.

The Stanza Poetry Festival, East Neuk Festival, and Pittenweem Arts Festival are events of national cultural importance. Smaller festivals like the Cupar Arts Festival and Largo Arts Week also take place. The Byre Theatre in St Andrews and Adam Smith Theatre in Kirkcaldy are both highly regarded as touring venues, the latter also being the base of the grand opera company Fife Opera. The Byre has re-opened in Autumn, 2014 following its going into administration in 2012. The Alhambra Theatre in Dunfermline and Rothes Halls in Glenrothes are also popular venues for touring musicians, theatre companies, comedians and local musical theatre groups to perform.

<text>Melville Louis Kossuth&quot;Melvil&quot;Dewey (December 10, 1851 – December 26, 1931) was an American librarian and educator who invented the Dewey Decimal system of library classification. He was a founder of the Lake Placid Club, a chief librarian at Columbia University, and a founding member of the American Library Association. Although Dewey&#x27;s contributions to the modern library are widely recognized, his legacy is marred by his sexual harassment of female colleagues, as well as his racism and antisemitism.

== Education and personal life ==
Dewey was born on December 10, 1851, in Adams Center, New York, the fifth and last child of Joel and Eliza Greene Dewey. He attended rural schools and determined early on that his destiny was to reform the education of the masses.
He briefly attended Alfred University (1870), then Amherst College, where he belonged to Delta Kappa Epsilon, and from which he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1874 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1877.

While still a student, he founded the Library Bureau, which sold high-quality index-cards and filing-cabinets, and established the standard dimensions for catalog cards.

As a young adult, he advocated spelling reform; he changed his name from the usual &quot;Melville&quot; to &quot;Melvil&quot;, without redundant letters, and for a time changed his surname to &quot;Dui.&quot;

From 1883 to 1888 he was chief librarian at the Columbia University Libraries. During his time as director of the New York State Library (1888–1906), Dewey established a program of traveling libraries. From 1888 to 1900, he served as secretary and executive officer of the University of the State of New York.

In 1895, Dewey founded the Lake Placid Club with his wife Annie. He and his son Godfrey had been active in arranging the Winter Olympics, which took place at Lake Placid—he chaired the New York State Winter Olympics Committee. In 1926, he went to Florida to establish a new branch of the Lake Placid Club.

Dewey married twice, first to Annie R. Godfrey and then to Emily McKay Beal. He and his first wife had one child, Godfrey. Dewey became a member of the American Library Association&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1951.

He died of a stroke in Lake Placid, Florida.

== Work ==
Dewey pioneered American librarianship and was an influential figure in the development of libraries in America in the late 19th and early 20th century. He is best known for the decimal classification system that many public and school libraries use. Among his other innovations was the idea of a state library operating as the state&#x27;s school and public library services controller. In Boston, Massachusetts, he founded the Library Bureau, a private company &quot;for the definite purpose of furnishing libraries with equipment and supplies of unvarying correctness and reliability.&quot; Its investigative unit, devoted to studying the best practices of library loss-management, circulation and data retention, recovered 3,000 books in its first year of existence.

Dewey&#x27;s Library Bureau company is also said to have introduced hanging vertical files, first seen at the Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago. In 1905, Dewey established the American Library Institute, which was an organization conceived to provide for the investigation, study, and discussion of issues within the field of library theory and practice.

=== Dewey Decimal Classification ===
Immediately after receiving his undergraduate degree, he was hired to manage Amherst&#x27;s library and reclassify its collections. Dewey worked out a new scheme that superimposed a system of decimal numbers on a structure of knowledge first outlined by Sir Francis Bacon. For his decision to use a decimal system, he may have been inspired by two library systems that he includes in the acknowledgments in the first publication of his system in 1876. In that preface, and the following thirteen editions, Dewey cites the card system of Italian publisher Natale Battezzati as &quot;the most fruitful source of ideas&quot;.

Dewey copyrighted the system in 1876. This system has proved to be enormously influential; though many American libraries have since adopted the classification scheme of the Library of Congress, Dewey&#x27;s system remains in widespread use.

=== American Library Association ===
In 1876, Dewey moved to Boston, where he founded and became editor of &quot;The Library Journal&quot;, which became an influential factor in the development of libraries in America and the reform of their administration. He was also one of the founders of the American Library Association. The proceedings of the 1876 organizing conference were published by Frederick Leypoldt in the first volume of &quot;Library Journal.&quot; Dewey was secretary from 1876 to 1891 and president in 1891 and 1893.

=== School of Library Economy ===

In 1883, Dewey replaced Beverly R. Betts as librarian of Columbia College and, in the following year, founded the School of Library Economy, the first institution for the instruction of librarians ever organized. The college&#x27;s board of trustees approved the proposal to establish the school on May 5, 1884. After preparation, the school was officially opened on January 5, 1887, with an enrollment of 20 students—three men and 17 women. Women were admitted to the program at Dewey&#x27;s insistence and against the wishes of the college&#x27;s Regents. Although the school had a promising start, Dewey&#x27;s conflicts with the university officials, in particular over the issue of the presence of women, led to its future being cast in doubt, and by 1888, it was apparent that Columbia intended to close it.

However, at that point, Dewey, upon accepting a position with the New York State Library in Albany, successfully secured the agreement of its Regents to have the school transferred there. The formal transfer was accomplished in 1889, and the school, which was ultimately very successful, was re-established in Albany as the New York State Library School under Dewey&#x27;s direction. The school returned to Columbia&#x27;s Manhattan campus in 1926. Dewey did not forget his Columbia students. He petitioned the University of the State of New York, which granted degrees to those students who agreed to submit to examinations and produce a bibliography and thesis. Two students participated, including future ALA registrar and college archivist Nina Browne.

From 1888 to 1906, Dewey was also director of the New York State Library, and until 1900, he was secretary of the University of the State of New York as well. In that function, he completely reorganized the state library, making it one of the most efficient in America, and established the system of state traveling libraries and picture collections. In 1885, he founded the New York Library Club there.

=== Traveling libraries ===
Community libraries began to flourish in the early nineteenth century. The western United States opened to expansion and further exploration, and people wanted services and opportunities to move with them. In New York, Melvil Dewey had &quot;initiated a program of traveling libraries-collections of one hundred books sent to communities without public libraries.&quot; His efforts spurred other state organizations and private individuals to create traveling libraries. Increased library services to small or rural communities and underserved populations fortified the efforts of many to seek out education and self-improvement.
Dewey was also influenced by Herbert Baxter Adams on ideas about library extension.

=== Metric system advocacy ===
As an enthusiastic supporter of the decimal metric system of weights and measures, Dewey established in 1876 the American Metric Bureau.
Dewey also served once again as its secretary. He edited the Bureau&#x27;s official publication, the &quot;Metric Bulletin&quot; (later called &quot;Metric Advocate&quot;), first issued in July 1876. Later in his life, he was a member of the advisory board of the All-America Standards Council (a California-based organization that promoted metrication for all countries in the Americas), and he functioned as a member of the advisory board and chairman of the Metric Education Committee in the American Metric Association (today the U.S. Metric Association).

===Lake Placid Club and other reforms===
 Late in his life, Dewey helped found the Lake Placid Club as a health resort in New York state.

His theories of spelling reform (to which end he founded the Spelling Reform Association in 1886 and later the Simplified Spelling Board) found some local success at Lake Placid. There was an &quot;Adirondak Loj&quot; in the area, and the dinner menus of the club used his reformed spelling. A September 1927 menu is headed &quot;Simpler spelin&quot; and features dishes like hadok, poted beef with noodls, parsli or masht potato, butr, steamd rys, letis, and ys cream. It also advises guests that &quot;All shud see the butiful after-glo on mountains to the east just before sunset. Fyn vu from Golfhous porch.&quot;

Lake Placid also acted as a conference center hosting meetings promoting reform movements, such as the September 1899 conference on &quot;home science&quot; chaired by Ellen Swallow Richards, a pioneer of what later came to be called &quot;home economics&quot;.

Dewey was an early promoter of winter sports in Lake Placid and was active in arranging the 1932 Winter Olympics there. He was also a founder of the Lake Placid Club Education Foundation in 1922. Under his leadership, the Northwood School (Lake Placid, New York) prospered. He was also a founder of the Adirondack Music Festival in 1925, and served as a trustee of the Chautauqua Institution.

In 1926, he established a southern branch of the Lake Placid Club in Florida. Dewey supported the idea of Lake Stearns in Florida formally changing its name to Lake Placid, Florida.

== Controversies ==
Dewey established a pattern of making powerful enemies early in life. Many of his friends found him difficult as well. As one biographer put it, &quot;Although he did not lack friends, they were becoming a little weary of coming to his defense, so endless a process had it become.&quot;

=== Sexual harassment ===
Another biography refers to Dewey&#x27;s &quot;old nemesis—a persistent inability to control himself around women&quot; as a chronic cause of trouble on the job. For decades, Dewey refused to stop his &quot;unwelcome hugging, unwelcome touching, certainly unwelcome kissing&quot; with female subordinates and others, according to biographer Wayne A. Wiegand. When Dewey opened his School of Library Economy at Columbia College to women, he asked for a photograph from each female applicant since &quot;you cannot polish a pumpkin&quot;.

In 1905, during a 10-day trip to Alaska sponsored by the American Library Association (ALA), a group he co-founded, he made unwelcome advances toward four prominent librarians (including Adelaide Hasse) who informed Association officials. As a result, Dewey was forced to step down from active participation in the ALA as several of his colleagues added their voices to a campaign. After 1906, Dewey was no longer an active ALA member, but he was still invited to be the guest of honor at ALA&#x27;s 50th anniversary meeting in 1926. Reports, allegations, and an investigation of Dewey&#x27;s inappropriate and offensive behavior directed at women continued for decades after his departure from the ALA. His prominent opponents on the grounds of sexual misbehavior included Tessa Kelso. &quot;In exchange for a quiet departure, he was spared an ugly and public expose of one of his major flaws&quot;, Wiegand writes. &quot;He was never again a power player in ALA politics.&quot;In 1929, Dewey settled out of court for $2,147 for a lawsuit brought by a former stenographer, whom he had kissed and caressed in public the previous summer. In general, Dewey himself did not deny his actions—only their impropriety. &quot;I have been very unconventional ... as men [are] always who frankly show and speak of their liking for women,&quot; he wrote. But, he insisted, it was not his fault if the targets of his &quot;unconventional&quot; actions took offense: &quot;Pure women would understand my ways.&quot;

=== Antisemitism and racism ===
The Lake Placid Club banned Jews, blacks, and others from membership, a policy written by Dewey himself. Out of fear, Dewey bought the land adjacent to the Lake Placid Club to prevent Jews from purchasing it. In 1904, the New York State Board of Regents received a petition demanding Dewey&#x27;s removal as state librarian because of his involvement in the Lake Placid Club&#x27;s policy of excluding Jews and other religious and ethnic groups. While the regents declined to remove Dewey, they did issue a public rebuke, and in the summer of 1905 he resigned as a result.

===American Library Association medal===
At the June 2019 conference of the American Library Association, the Council voted to remove Dewey&#x27;s name from its top honor, the Melvil Dewey Medal; the resolution cited Dewey&#x27;s history of racism, antisemitism, and sexual harassment. The resolution was passed overwhelmingly with no debate. The award was renamed the ALA Medal of Excellence at the Association&#x27;s January 2020 conference.

<doc id="81905" wikidata="Q655779" url="?curid=81905" title="Carlos Prío Socarrás">
<text>Carlos Manuel Prío Socarrás (July 14, 1903 – April 5, 1977) was a Cuban politician. He served as the President of Cuba from 1948 until he was deposed by a military coup led by Fulgencio Batista on March 10, 1952, three months before new elections were to be held. He was the first president of Cuba to be born in an independent Cuba and the last to gain his post through universal, contested elections. He went into exile in the United States, where he lived for 25 years before dying by suicide at age 73.

== Governance ==
In 1940, Prío was elected senator of Pinar del Río Province. Four years later, fellow Partido Auténtico member Ramón Grau became president, and during the Grau administration Prío served turns as Minister of Public Works, Minister of Labor and Prime Minister. On July 1, 1948, he was elected president of Cuba as a member of the Partido Auténtico. Prío was assisted by Chief of the Armed Forces General Genovevo Pérez Dámera and Colonel José Luis Chinea Cárdenas, who had previously been in charge of the Province of Santa Clara.

The eight years under Grau and Prío, were, according to Charles Ameringer,

[...] unique in Cuban history. They were a time of constitutional order and political freedom. They were not &#x27;golden years&#x27; by any means, but in two elections (1944 and 1948), Cubans had the opportunity to express their desire for a rule of civil liberties, primacy of Cuban culture, and achievement of economic independence. If there were sharp contradictions in Cuban society under the Auténticos, the circumstances differed only in degree from the complexities and dynamics encountered in free societies everywhere (how often did Cubans compare Havana with Chicago?).

Prío, called &quot;el presidente cordial&quot; (&quot;the cordial president&quot;), was committed to a rule marked by civility, primarily in its respect for freedom of expression. Several public-works projects and the establishment of a National Bank and Tribunal of Accounts count among his successes.

However, violence among political factions and reports of theft and self-enrichment in the government ranks marred Prío&#x27;s term. The Prío administration increasingly came to be perceived by the public as ineffectual in the face of violence and corruption, much as the Grau administration before it.

With elections scheduled for the middle of 1952, rumors surfaced of a planned military coup by long-shot presidential contender Fulgencio Batista. Prío, seeing no constitutional basis to act, did not do so. The rumors proved to be true. On March 10, 1952, Batista and his collaborators seized military and police commands throughout the country and occupied major radio and TV stations. Batista assumed power when Prío, failing to mount a resistance, boarded a plane and went into exile.

According to Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., Prío later said of his presidency:

They say that I was a terrible president of Cuba. That may be true. But I was the best president Cuba ever had.
== Personal life and death ==
Prio first married Inés Georgina (Gina) Karell Pedrosa and they had one daughter, Rocío Guadalupe Prío-Karell. He married María Dolores &quot;Mary&quot; Tarrero-Serrano (1924–2010) on June 17, 1945, in the Chapel of the Presidential Palace, and they had two daughters, María Antonetta Prío-Tarrero (married to César Odio, former City Manager of the City of Miami) and María Elena Prío-Tarrero (divorced from Alfredo Duran, former chairman of the Florida Democratic Party). He also had two recognized children with his former mistress, Celia Rosa Touzet Masfera: Carlos Prio-Touzet, an architect, and Rodolfo (Rudy) Prío-Touzet.

Prío died by suicide by gunshot to the chest on April 5, 1977, in Miami Beach, Florida, at age 73. He and his wife Mary are buried at Woodlawn Park Cemetery and Mausoleum (now Caballero Rivero Woodlawn North Park Cemetery and Mausoleum) in Miami, Florida.

<doc id="81910" wikidata="Q53473" url="?curid=81910" title="Scrophulariaceae">
<text>The Scrophulariaceae are a family of flowering plants, commonly known as the figwort family. The plants are annual and perennial herbs, as well as shrubs. Flowers have bilateral (zygomorphic) or rarely radial (actinomorphic) symmetry. The Scrophulariaceae have a cosmopolitan distribution, with the majority found in temperate areas, including tropical mountains. The family name is based on the name of the included genus &quot;Scrophularia&quot; L.

==Taxonomy==

In the past, it was treated as including about 275 genera and over 5,000 species, but its circumscription has been radically altered since numerous molecular phylogenies have shown the traditional broad circumscription to be grossly polyphyletic. Many genera have recently been transferred to other families within the Lamiales, notably Plantaginaceae and Orobanchaceae, but also several new families. Several families of the Lamiales have had their circumscriptions enlarged to accommodate genera transferred from the Scrophulariacae &quot;sensu lato&quot;.

Fischer (2004) considered the family to consist of three subfamilies – Antirrhinoideae, Gratioloideae, and Digitalidoideae. He further divided the Gratioloideae into five tribes – Gratioleae, Angeloniaeae, Stemodieae, Limoselleae, and Lindernieae. He then divided the Gratioleae, with its 16 genera (and about 182 species) into three subtribes – Caprarinae, Dopatrinae, and Gratiolinae. The Gratiolinae had 10 genera (about 121 species) distributed through temperate and tropical America – &quot;Bacopa&quot; and &quot;Mecardonia&quot; (formerly &quot;Herpestis&quot;), &quot;Amphianthus&quot;, &quot;Gratiola&quot;, &quot;Sophronanthe&quot;, &quot;Benjaminia&quot;, &quot;Scoparia&quot;, &quot;Boelkea&quot;, &quot;Maeviella&quot;, and &quot;Braunblequetia&quot;. Many of these were transferred to the family Plantaginaceae, in the tribe Gratioleae.

==Uses==
The family includes some medicinal plants, among them:
* &quot;Scrophularia&quot;, figworts
* &quot;Verbascum&quot;, mulleins

==Genera==
The family Scrophulariaceae in its APG IV (2016) circumscription includes 62 genera and about 1830 known species. As of May 2024, Plants of the World Online accepts 58 genera.


===Excluded genera===
The following genera, traditionally included in the Scrophulariaceae, have been transferred to other families as indicated:

<doc id="81911" wikidata="Q53475" url="?curid=81911" title="Acanthaceae">
<text>Acanthaceae () is a family (the acanthus family) of dicotyledonous flowering plants containing almost 250 genera and about 2500 species. Most are tropical herbs, shrubs, or twining vines; some are epiphytes. Only a few species are distributed in temperate regions. The four main centres of distribution are Indonesia and Malaysia, Africa, Brazil, and Central America. Representatives of the family can be found in nearly every habitat, including dense or open forests, scrublands, wet fields and valleys, sea coast and marine areas, swamps, and mangrove forests.

==Description==
Plants in this family have simple, opposite, decussated leaves with entire (or sometimes toothed, lobed, or spiny) margins, and without stipules. The leaves may contain cystoliths, calcium carbonate concretions, seen as streaks on the surface.

The flowers are perfect, zygomorphic to nearly actinomorphic, and arranged in an inflorescence that is either a spike, raceme, or cyme. Typically, a colorful bract subtends each flower; in some species, the bract is large and showy. The calyx usually has four or five lobes; the corolla tubular, two-lipped or five-lobed; stamens number either two or four, arranged in pairs and inserted on the corolla, and the ovary is superior and bicarpellated, with axile placentation.

The fruit is a two-celled capsule, dehiscing somewhat explosively. In most species, the seeds are attached to a small, hooked stalk (a modified funiculus called a jaculator or a retinaculum) that ejects them from the capsule. This trait is shared by all members of the clade Acanthoideae. A 1995 study of seed expulsion in Acanthaceae used high speed video pictures to show that retinacula propel seeds away from the parent plant when the fruits dehisce, thereby helping the plant gain maximum seed dispersal range.

A species well known to temperate gardeners is bear&#x27;s breeches (&quot;Acanthus mollis&quot;), a herbaceous perennial plant with big leaves and flower spikes up to 2 m tall. Tropical genera familiar to gardeners include &quot;Thunbergia&quot; and &quot;Justicia&quot;.

&quot;Avicennia&quot;, a genus of mangrove trees, usually placed in Verbenaceae or in its own family, Avicenniaceae, is included in Acanthaceae by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group on the basis of molecular phylogenetic studies that show it to be associated with this family.

==Medicinal uses==
Traditionally the most important part use in Acanthaceae is the leaves and they are used externally for wounds.
Some research has indicated that Acanthaceae possess , cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, antioxidant, insecticidal, hepatoprotective, immunomodulatory, anti-platelet aggregation and anti-viral potential.

For instance, &quot;Acanthus ilicifolius&quot;, whose chemical composition has been heavily researched, is widely used in ethnopharmaceutical applications, including in Indian and Chinese traditional medicine. Various parts of &quot;Acanthus ilicifolius&quot; have been used to treat asthma, diabetes, leprosy, hepatitis, snake bites, and rheumatoid arthritis. The leaves of &quot;Acanthus ebracteatus&quot;, noted for their antioxidant properties, are used for making Thai herbal tea in Thailand and Indonesia.

==Phytochemistry==
Phytochemical reports on family Acanthaceae are glycosides, flavonoids, benzonoids, phenolic compounds, naphthoquinone and triterpenoids.

== Overview of systematics ==
Since the first comprehensive classification of Acanthaceae in 1847 by Nees, there have been a few major revisions presented since for the whole family.

Lindau, in 1895, divided the family into the subfamilies Mendoncioideae, Thunbergioideae, Nelsonioideae, and Acanthoideae. Critically, Mendoncioideae, Thunbergioideae, and Nelsonioideae do not possess retinaculate fruits—and it is this distinction, between classifying Acanthaceae into a family that includes those clades with non-retinaculate fruits and one that excludes them, that still persists to the modern day.

Bremekamp, in 1965, presented a classification of Acanthaceae that differed from that of Lindau, for his Acanthaceae excluded genera that lack retinaculate fruits. He placed Nelsonioideae within Scrophulariaceae, classified Thunbergiaceae and Mendonciaceae as distinct families and divided his Acanthaceae into two groups (Acanthoideae and Ruelloideae) based on the presence or absence of cystoliths, articulate stems, monothecate anthers, and colpate pollen.

In Scotland and Vollesen&#x27;s 2000 study, they accepted 221 genera and detailed five major groups within Acanthaceae s.s. (that is, those possessing retinaculate fruits), which is equivalent to Acanthoideae Link sensu Lindau 1895. Out of those 221 genera, they placed 201 of them into seven infrafamilial taxa of Acanthaceae, leaving only 20 unplaced.

In the current understanding of Acanthaceae, Acanthaceae s.s. includes only those clades with retinaculate fruits (that is, , , , Whitfieldeae, , and Justiceae), while Acanthaceae s.l. includes those clades as well as Thunbergioideae, Nelsonioideae, and &quot;Avicennia.&quot;

== Dating the Acanthaceae lineage ==
Much research, using both molecular data and fossils, has been conducted in recent years regarding the dating and distribution of the Acanthaceae and Lamiales lineage, although there still remains some ambiguity.

In a 2004 study on the molecular phylogenetic dating of asterid flowering plants, researchers estimated 106 million years (MY) for the stem lineage of Lamiales, 67 MY for the stem lineage of Acanthaceae, and 54 MY for the crown node of Acanthaceae (that is, the age of extant lineages with the family). These estimates are older than those based on fossils that can confidently be assigned to Lamiales, which are middle Eocene in age, ca. 48-37 MY. Palynomorphs that definitively show the existence of Acanthaceae are known from the upper Miocene, with the oldest ca. 22 MY.

==Genera==

He is not mentioned by Homer, but his story is given in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; of Virgil and other accounts, as a treacherous agent of the Greeks who misleads the Trojans, encouraging them to bring the Trojan Horse inside the city. He sometimes appears in art, usually being dragged into Troy as a captive, with the horse behind him.

== Family ==
Sinon was the son of Aesimus, son of Autolycus. He was the cousin of Odysseus through his mother Anticlea, daughter of Autolycus.

== Mythology ==

===&quot;Aeneid&quot;===
In the &quot;Aeneid&quot; (book II, 57 ff.), Aeneas recounts how Sinon was found outside Troy after the rest of the Greek army had sailed away, and brought to Priam by shepherds. Pretending to have deserted the Greeks, he told the Trojans that the giant wooden horse the Greeks had left behind was intended as a gift to the gods to ensure their safe voyage home. He told them that the horse was made too big for the Trojans to move it into their city, because if they did they would be invincible to later Achaean invasion. His story convinced the Trojans because it included the former details as well as an explanation that he was left behind to die by the doing of Odysseus, who was his enemy. 

The Trojans brought the Trojan Horse into their city against the advice of Cassandra (given the gift of prophecy by Apollo, but condemned to never be believed for not returning his love) and Laocoön (because two serpents came out of the water and strangled him and his sons, which the Trojans saw as a punishment for attacking the horse with a spear). Inside the giant wooden horse were Greek soldiers, who, as night fell, disembarked from the horse and opened the city gates, thus sealing the fate of Troy. He was also an Achaean spy who told the Greeks when the soldiers in the horse had begun their fight.

This scene is in neither the &quot;Iliad&quot; nor the &quot;Odyssey&quot; but is in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;; it is central to the perspective Virgil builds, in support of the actual Roman sentiment, of the Greeks as cunning, deceitful, and treacherous.

===&quot;Posthomerica&quot;===
In Quintus of Smyrna, the Trojans, ready to attack the Greek camp, see smoke coming from the Greek camp and cautiously approach. When they arrive at the camp they find only Sinon alongside the Trojan Horse. The reader later finds out that it was Sinon who started the fire signal that drew the Trojans to the Greek camp. The rest of the camp is deserted. The Trojans circle him and gently ask him questions but when he does not answer they grow angry and begin to threaten to stab him. When he still does not answer, the Trojans cut off his ears and nose. Finally he tells them that the Greeks have fled and they built the Trojan Horse to honor Athena. Sinon claims that Odysseus wanted to sacrifice him but he managed to escape and hide in a marsh. When they gave up looking for him and left he returned to the Trojan Horse. Sinon claims that the Greeks stopped looking for him out of respect for Zeus. All the Trojans believe this story, except Laocoön who, along with his two sons, is promptly attacked by a giant sea serpent. Following this, believing that Laocoön was attacked because he offended the gods, the rest of the Trojans begin to believe Sinon&#x27;s story. Feeling bad for Sinon, and fearing wrath from the gods, the Trojans bring Sinon and the Trojan Horse into Troy.

==Sinon in other literature==
In Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; poem &quot;Inferno&quot; (Canto 30), Sinon is seen in the Tenth Bolgia of Hell&#x27;s Circle of Fraud where, along with other Falsifiers of words, he is condemned to suffer a burning fever for all eternity. Sinon is here rather than the Evil Counselors Bolgia because his advice was false as well as evil.

The word &quot;Sinonical&quot; was coined by Lewes Lewknor in his 1595 work &quot;The Estate of English Fugitives&quot;.

William Shakespeare referred to Sinon on several occasions in his work, using him as a symbol of treachery. For instance in &quot;Cymberline&quot;, act III scene IV:

<text>In Greek mythology, Eurylochus (; Ancient Greek: Εὐρύλοχος &quot;Eurúlokhos&quot;) appears in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; as second-in-command of Odysseus&#x27; ship during the return to Ithaca after the Trojan War. He is portrayed as an unpleasant, cowardly individual who undermines Odysseus and stirs up trouble.

== Family ==
Eurylochus was from the island of Same near Ithaca. He was the husband of Odysseus&#x27;s sister, Ctimene.

== Mythology ==
When Odysseus and 12 of his crew, including Eurylochus, came into the port of Sicily, the Cyclops Polyphemus seized and confined them. Along with the Ithacan king and six others namely: Lycaon, Amphialos, Alkimos, Amphidamas and Antilochus, Eurylochus survived the manslaughter of his six companions by the monster.

When the ship stops on Aeaea, home of Circe the goddess-sorceress, daughter of the sun god Helios and the Oceanid nymph Perse, Eurylochus and Odysseus draw lots to lead a group of twenty-two men to explore the island. Eurylochus is chosen. After the crew spots a column of smoke, Eurylochus leads his expedition towards the source. They near a palace surrounded with wild but magically benign animals. Inside the palace is Circe singing, and (led by Polites) all rush in, except for Eurylochus who suspects her treachery. When she turns the rest of the expedition into pigs, Eurylochus escapes and warns Odysseus and the portion of the crew who stayed on the ship, thus enabling Odysseus to attempt a rescue. When Odysseus goes to save his men, Eurylochus refuses to guide him and urges him to escape and leave the men to their fate.

When Odysseus returns from Circe, having rescued the men, Eurylochus insults Odysseus. Odysseus considers killing him but the crewmen drag them apart. After their reconciliation, Circe advises Odysseus to see the prophet Tiresias for advice to get back home. Tiresias instructs Odysseus not to touch the cattle of Helios, but Eurylochus persuades the hungry and mutinous crew to kill and eat some of the god&#x27;s cattle. As punishment, Odysseus&#x27;s ship is destroyed, and all of his crew, including Eurylochus, are killed in a storm sent by Zeus. Only Odysseus survives.

* Telegonus, a king of Egypt who was sometimes said to have married the nymph Io.
* Telegonus, a Thracian son of Proteus by Torone (Chrysonoe) of Phlegra, daughter of King Cleitus of Sithones. He was the brother of Polygonus (Tmolus). Because of Telegonus&#x27; and his brother&#x27;s great violence towards strangers, Proteus prayed to their grandsire Poseidon to carry him back to Egypt. They met their demise when they challenged Heracles to wrestle at the behest of Hera but lost their life in the battle.

<text>Picus was a figure in Roman mythology, the first king of Latium. He was the son of Saturn, also known as Stercutus. He was the founder of the first Latin tribe and settlement, Laurentum, located a few miles to the Southeast of the site of the later city of Rome. He was known for his skill at augury and horsemanship.

== Mythology ==
According to Festus he got his name as a consequence of the fact that he used to rely on a woodpecker for the purpose of divination. Picus was also described to be quite handsome, sought after by nymphs and naiads. The witch Circe attempted to seduce him with her charms and herbs while he was on a hunting trip, but he savagely rejected her. She turned him into a woodpecker for scorning her love. When his comrades accused Circe of her crime and demanded Picus&#x27; release, she turned them too into a variety of beasts. Picus&#x27; wife (to whom he was wholly devoted) was Canens, a nymph. After Picus&#x27; transformation she wandered madly through the forest for 6 days until finally she lay down on the bank of the Tiber and died. They had one son, Faunus.

According to grammarian Servius, Picus&#x27;s love for Pomona was itself scorned. But in another place he states she consented to marriage, but Circe transformed Picus into a woodpecker and her into a &quot;pica&quot;, a kind of bird, probably a magpie or an owl. He is featured in one of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; of Ovid. Virgil says that he was the son of Saturnus and the grandfather of Latinus, the king of the Laurentines whom Aeneas and his Trojans fought upon reaching Italy.

Italic people believed Picus was the son of the god of war Mars and attributed his avine transformation to his skills at interpreting bird omens.

One of the functions he performed was to lead the deduction of colonies (made up of younger generation folk) with his flight, which traditionally took place in spring and was performed according to a religious ritual known as ver sacrum. The people of the Piceni derived their name from the memory of this ritual.

<doc id="81918" wikidata="Q769446" url="?curid=81918" title="Van Nuys">
<text>Van Nuys () is a neighborhood in the central San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California. Home to Van Nuys Airport and the Valley Municipal Building, it is the most populous neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley.

==History==
In 1909, the Suburban Homes Company – a syndicate led by Hobart Johnstone Whitley, general manager of the board of control, along with Harry Chandler, H. G. Otis, M. H. Sherman and O. F. Brandt – purchased 48,000 acres of the Farming and Milling Company for $2.5 million. Henry E. Huntington extended his Pacific Electric Railway (Red Cars) through the Valley to Owensmouth (now Canoga Park). The Suburban Home Company laid out plans for roads and the towns of Van Nuys, Reseda (Marian) and Canoga Park (Owensmouth). The rural areas were annexed into the city of Los Angeles in 1915.

The town was founded in 1911 and named for one of its developers, Isaac Newton Van Nuys, a rancher and entrepreneur of Dutch ancestry. It was annexed by Los Angeles on May 22, 1915, after completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, providing it with the water required for further growth. Van Nuys was the first new stop on the San Fernando Line of the Pacific Electric Railway red cars system, which boosted its early land sales and commercial success. From as far as Alhambra, in 1917, day trips were organized for potential buyers of five-acre farms.

Van Nuys became the Valley&#x27;s satellite Los Angeles municipal civic center with the 1932 Art Deco Valley Municipal Building (Van Nuys City Hall), a visual landmark and Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, starting the present-day Government Center complex of government services buildings.

In 1991, Marvin Braude, a member of the Los Angeles City Council, redesignated a 45-block area of Van Nuys as a part of Sherman Oaks. This redesignated area included the community of Magnolia Woods. Some area residents had presented a petition and several original deeds that stated &quot;Sherman Oaks&quot; to Braude. They argued that the area was a part of Sherman Oaks until the 1960s, when ZIP Codes labeling the area as Van Nuys were established.

In October 2005, the Metro Orange Line opened with two stations, Van Nuys station (Los Angeles Metro) and Sepulveda station.

In 2014, a &quot;Great Streets&quot; project was introduced by Mayor Eric Garcetti with Van Nuys Blvd. to be redesigned between Victory Blvd. and Oxnard Street. Also, Sepulveda Blvd. was resurfaced between Victory Blvd and Oxnard Street in May 2014. A new Los Angeles County family services building was built on the southwest corner of Van Nuys Blvd. and Saticoy Street in 2016.

==Geography and climate==
Van Nuys is bordered on the north by North Hills, on the northeast by Panorama City, on the east by Valley Glen, on the south by Sherman Oaks, on the southwest by the Sepulveda Basin, on the west by Lake Balboa, and on the northwest by Northridge. Its street and other boundaries are Roscoe Boulevard on the north, Sepulveda Boulevard, the Tujunga Wash, Woodman Avenue and Hazeltine Avenue on the east, Oxnard Street on the south, the Sepulveda Basin on the southwest and Odessa and Hayvenhurst avenues and Balboa Boulevard on the west.

===Boundary changes===
Some former Van Nuys neighborhoods won approval in 2009 by the Los Angeles City Council to break off from Van Nuys and join the neighboring communities of Lake Balboa, Valley Glen, and Sherman Oaks in an effort to raise their property values. City Council member Tony Cardenas &quot;suggested the change was motivated by racism.&quot;

===Climate===
==Population==
The 2000 U.S. census counted 136,443 residents in the 8.99-square-mile Van Nuys neighborhood—or 11,542 people per square mile. In 2000, the median age for residents was 28, considered young for city and county neighborhoods, and the percentages of residents aged 10 or younger and 19 to 34 were among the highest in Los Angeles County.

The neighborhood was considered &quot;moderately diverse&quot; ethnically within Los Angeles. The breakdown was Hispanics, 60.5%; whites, 23.1%; Asians, 6.4%; blacks, 6%; and others, 4%. Mexico (41.5%) and El Salvador (17.3%) were the most common places of birth for the 49.8% of the residents who were born abroad—a high percentage for Los Angeles. There were 4,917 families headed by single parents or 21.3%, considered high for both the city and the county.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $41,134, considered average for the city, but low for the county. The percentages of households that earned $40,000 or less were high for the county. Renters occupied 73.9% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment-owners held 26.1%.

==Economy==

Van Nuys Boulevard has a long and diverse commercial district along it, as do other major streets crossing through Van Nuys.

From December 1947 until August 1992, General Motors operated an automobile factory called Van Nuys Assembly at Van Nuys Boulevard and Arminta Street to augment production efforts at their South Gate Assembly factory, which opened in 1936. The Van Nuys plant manufactured 6.3 million vehicles, including the Chevrolet Impala, Corvair, and later was the primary location for the Nova, Camaro, and Pontiac Firebird. Other models built were the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Chevelle, the Oldsmobile Omega, and the Pontiac Ventura. Badge engineered versions of the Impala, Nova and Camaro were also manufactured at this location. In October 1989, GM announced that Camaro and Firebird production would be moved to a facility in Sainte-Thérèse. Due to air quality remediation efforts and decreasing market share of GM products, the factory was closed.

In 1999, The Plant shopping center opened on the former factory site, anchored by big box retailers and a 16-screen movie theater multiplex. Through the following years there were additions to The Plant shopping center.
Sound City Studios is a well-respected recording studio in Van Nuys. Van Nuys, along with Chatsworth, is home to numerous pornographic film studios, distributors, and manufacturers.

The agency serves a large population of developmentally disabled people living in the San Fernando Valley.

<text>Latinus (; Ancient Greek: Λατῖνος, &quot;Latînos&quot;, or Λατεῖνος, &quot;Lateînos&quot;) was a figure both in Greek and Roman mythology. He is often associated with the heroes of the Trojan War, namely Odysseus and Aeneas. Although his appearance in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; is irreconcilable with his appearance in Greek mythology, the two pictures are so different that he cannot be seen as one character.

== Greek mythology ==
In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Latinus was the son of Odysseus and Circe who ruled the Tyrrhenians with his brothers Agrius and Telegonus. According to the Byzantine author John the Lydian, Hesiod, in the &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, considered Latinus to be the brother of Graecus, who is described as the son of Zeus by Pandora, the daughter of Deucalion and Pyrrha. In his &quot;Fabularum Liber&quot; (or &quot;Fabulae&quot;), Gaius Julius Hyginus recorded the myth that Latinus was a son of Circe and Telemachus (a son of Odysseus) That relation possibly dated to the lost epic Telegony of Eugammon of Cyrene. He was also depicted as the son of Odysseus and Calypso.

== Roman mythology ==

In later Roman mythology (notably Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;), Latinus, or Lavinius, was a king of the Latins. He is sometimes described as the son of Faunus and Marica, and father of Lavinia with his wife, Amata. He hosted Aeneas&#x27;s army of exiled Trojans and offered them the chance to reorganize their life in Old Latium. His wife Amata wished his daughter Lavinia to be betrothed to Turnus, king of the Rutuli, but Latinus and the gods insisted that he give her instead to Aeneas; consequently, Turnus declared war on Aeneas and was killed two weeks into the conflict. Ascanius, the son of Aeneas, later founded Alba Longa and was the first in a long series of kings leading to Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome.

== English mythology ==

The English once widely claimed as history, an original peopling of the isle — at the time a land only of fantastical giants — by descendants of the above-mentioned Eneas, perhaps via Latinus, and at least with Latinus as step-family of an ancestor, though even in the time of the Renaissance, a non-English audience as well at least one English writer found details of the stories less than convincing.

The island known later as Britain, was also previously known as Alba, similarity of name supporting connection to the city of Alba in Italy, said to have been built by Alcanius, son of Eneas, and third ruler of the Latins after Latinus, being either his grandson or step-grandson.

Even if one ignored obviously far-fetched elements of this foundation myth of Britain, Johannes Rastell writing in 1529 questioned, along these lines:  Supposing the original Brits were descendants of a line of Latin kings — Brute the son of Silvius, son of Alcanius, son of Eneas who came to the Italian peninsula from Troy — then why should such a fact have escaped record in the writings of Julius Caesar when he had personally surveyed the lands there he had conquered for Rome by 48 BC? And indeed, why should the son Brutus have escaped from Latin histories altogether, given they did deal with Silvius and Alcanius, and &#x27;all theyr childera &amp; what became of them &amp; how they endyd that succeeded them as kyngis&#x27;?

Other details he found were able to be discounted without resort to factual records, or with only very few facts needed other than everyday experience. Were the early inhabitants of Britain giants, descended from the Devil in union with 32 daughters of a king Dioclisian of Syria? To Rastell, if the devil had power to sow such seeds at the earlier time, then why not in his own time? Where were the giants today?

Other fanciful elements he reduced by logical deduction from intuitive psychological insights, for example the greatly diminished chance of 32 daughters married to 32 kings on a single day, and all cooperating to kill those 32 husbands in a single night; or in combination with analysis of logistical realities, such as the suggested voyage of all 32 murderous widows to Britain without dispersion or diversion, over three thousand miles.

One renaissance writer Rastell was further able to discount the likelihood of any factuality to that ancient tale, due to his failure to discover, after diligent research, any authentic record of its origin or explanation as to why such record should be absent.

<doc id="81920" wikidata="Q596552" url="?curid=81920" title="Lotus-eaters">
<text>In Greek mythology, lotophages or the lotus-eaters () were a race of people living on an island dominated by the lotus tree off coastal Tunisia (Island of Djerba), a plant whose botanical identity is uncertain. The Lotophagi race in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; are said to eat the fruit of the &quot;lotos&quot; &quot;sweet as honey&quot;. The lotus fruits and flowers were the primary food of the island and were a narcotic, causing the inhabitants to sleep in peaceful apathy. After they ate the lotus, they would forget their home and loved ones and long only to stay with their fellow lotus-eaters. Those who ate the plant never cared to report or return.

Figuratively, &#x27;lotus-eaters&#x27; denotes &quot;people who spend their time indulging in pleasure and luxury rather than dealing with practical concerns&quot;.

==Etymology==
In English, the lotus-eaters (, &quot;lōtophágoi&quot;), are also referred to as the lotophagi or lotophaguses (singular &quot;lotophagus&quot; ) or lotophages (singular &quot;lotophage&quot; ).

==Mythology==

In Homer&#x27;s epic poem the &quot;Odyssey&quot; Book IX, Odysseus tells how adverse north winds blew him and his men off course as they were rounding Cape Malea, the southernmost tip of the Peloponnesus, headed westwards for Ithaca:
== Location ==
Herodotus, in the 5th century BC, was sure that they still existed in his day in coastal Libya:

Polybius identifies the land of the lotus-eaters as the island of Djerba (ancient Meninx), off the coast of Tunisia. Later, this identification is supported by Strabo. Pseudo-Scylax mentions lotus-eaters in area of northern and central Dalmatia (&quot;namely the Iaderatenai and Boulinoi&quot;).

== Lotus plant ==
Because the Greek word λωτός &quot;lōtós&quot; can refer to several different plants, there is some ambiguity as to which &quot;lotus&quot; appears in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. 

==In popular culture==
The Lotos-Eaters is a poem by Alfred Tennyson, describing a group of mariners who, upon eating the lotos, are put into an altered state and isolated from the outside world.

British romantic composer Hubert Parry wrote a half-hour choral setting of Tennyson&#x27;s poem for soprano, choir, and orchestra.

<text>Van Nuys Airport is a public airport in the Van Nuys neighborhood of the City of Los Angeles. The airport is operated by Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), a branch of the Los Angeles city government, which also operates Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Van Nuys is one of the busiest general aviation airports in the world, with the airport&#x27;s two parallel runways averaging over 230,000 takeoffs and landings annually.

Van Nuys is home to news, medical transport, and tour helicopter operators, the air operations unit of the Los Angeles City Fire Department, and a maintenance base for Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles Department of Water and Power helicopters.

Originally opened as Metropolitan Airport on December 17, 1928, the airport became the Van Nuys Army Airfield during World War II, was renamed the San Fernando Valley Airport after the war, before taking its current name in 1957.

The airport is also home to LAWA&#x27;s FlyAway terminal, where passengers bound for LAX can park and board buses that run nonstop between Van Nuys and LAX.

Van Nuys Airport is also known for implementing multiple noise abatement policies and strategies which includes awarding jet operators with the Friendly Flyer Award for reduced noise.

==History==
Van Nuys Airport opened on December 17, 1928, the 25th anniversary of the Wright Brothers&#x27; first flight, as Metropolitan Airport. The airfield was run by a small group of citizens who established a corporation. The airport was spread out on 80 acres, surrounded by trees and farmland. The airport was mostly used for general aviation, but also became popular with Hollywood stars of the era, and notably was the filming location of the iconic airport scene in the 1942 film Casablanca. Also notable were the scenes of the reckless flight (and other scenes) of Laurel and Hardy in the 1939 film The Flying Deuces.

In 1942, after the United States entered World War II, the government purchased Metropolitan Airport and converted it into the Van Nuys Army Airfield. The Army also purchased an additional 163 acres of land to expand the runways and airfield. During the war, the airfield was used by the 4th Air Force, which stationed the 428th Fighter Squadron with Lockheed P-38 Lightning aircraft in 1943. In 1944, the 441st Army Air Forces Base Unit was added to train additional pilots for the P-38. Elsewhere on the airfield, the U.S. Navy and Lockheed Corporation created an aircraft modification facility known as the Navy Lockheed Plant, just one of several aircraft companies that would become established in the area.

In 1949, after the war, the City of Los Angeles purchased the airport from the War Assets Administration for $1, with the agreement that a California Air National Guard base continue to operate at the site. The name of the airport, which by then covered 400 acres, was changed to San Fernando Valley Airport.

In the 1950s, the California Air National Guard based North American F-86 Sabre jets at the airport and built new permanent facilities. In 1957, the airport&#x27;s name would change one last time to Van Nuys Airport. In 1959, the Sherman Way underpass was finished, allowing the main runway (16R/34L) to be extended to its current length of . By the end of the decade, Van Nuys was ranked as the 25th busiest airport in the nation in terms of operations, despite having no commercial air service.

In 1975, the Los Angeles Department of Airports (today Los Angeles World Airports) built the FlyAway bus terminal just east of the Van Nuys Airport. The terminal served as a remote parking lot for sister airport, LAX. Passengers would park at Van Nuys and board a bus for a trip to LAX, helping to alleviate freeway and LAX parking congestion.

The California Air National Guard moved out of Van Nuys in 1990, with the 146th Airlift Wing shifting to Naval Air Station Point Mugu (now Naval Base Ventura County) in Oxnard. In 1994, the now-vacated National Guard buildings became a critical operating site for the American Red Cross helping victims of the devastating Northridge earthquake. In the early 2000s, the facility was converted into air operations and helicopter maintenance facilities for the Los Angeles Fire Department.

In the 2020s Van Nuys remains one of the world&#x27;s busiest general aviation airports, with 232,000 aircraft operations in 2020. A 2015 study found that the airport generates of economic impact and has created 10,480 jobs

<text>Argius () was a sculptor of ancient Greece who was the disciple of Polykleitos, and therefore flourished about 388 BCE.

The 19th century classical scholar Friedrich Thiersch supposed that Pliny the Elder, in the words &quot;Argius, Asopodorus,&quot; mis-translated his Greek authority, which had Ἀργεῖος Ἀσωπόδωρος, or &quot;Asopodorus the Argive.&quot; But &quot;Argius&quot; is found as a Greek proper name in both the forms, Ἄργιος and Ἀργεῖος.
