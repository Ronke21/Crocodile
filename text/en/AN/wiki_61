<text>Marion County is a county of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census the population was 29,341. The county seat is Hamilton. The county was created by an act of the Alabama Territorial General Assembly on February 13, 1818. The county seat was originally established in Pikeville in 1820, and moved to Hamilton in 1881. The county was named by planter and US Indian agent John Dabney Terrell, Sr., in recognition of General Francis Marion of South Carolina.

Marion County is located in the northwestern part of the state, bounded on the west by the state of Mississippi. It encompasses . The county is a prohibition or dry county, however, the sale of alcohol is permitted within the cities of Guin, Hamilton, and Winfield.

==History==
The county was created by the Alabama Territorial General Assembly on February 13, 1818, preceding Alabama&#x27;s statehood by almost two years. It was created from land acquired from the Chickasaw Indians by the Treaty of 1816. Marion County included all of its current territory and parts of what are now Winston, Walker, Fayette, and Lamar counties in Alabama as well as portions of present-day Lowndes, Monroe, and Itawamba counties in Mississippi. The county was named in honor of General Francis Marion (1732–1795), an American Revolutionary War hero from South Carolina who was known as &quot;The Swamp Fox.&quot; Many early settlers of Marion County came from Kentucky and Tennessee after General Andrew Jackson established the Military Road. The first towns in the area were Pikeville, Hamilton (formerly named Toll Gate), Winfield, and Guin.

The county&#x27;s first seat was settled in 1818 at Cotton Gin Port, near present-day Amory, Mississippi. It was moved in 1819 to the home of Henry Greer along the Buttahatchee River, in 1820, the first permanent county seat was established at Pikeville, now a ghost town, located between present day Hamilton and Guin, along U.S. Highway 43. Pikeville served as the county seat of Marion County until 1882. Although the town is now abandoned, the home of Judge John Dabney Terrell Sr., which served as the third county courthouse, still stands. In 1882, Hamilton became the county seat. The first courthouse in Hamilton was destroyed by fire on March 30, 1887, and the second courthouse, constructed in the same place, also burned. A new courthouse, constructed of local sandstone opened in 1901. In 1959, the building was significantly remodeled to give the structure its current 1950s &quot;international style&quot; design theme.

<doc id="80789" wikidata="Q960315" url="?curid=80789" title="Francis Marion">
<text>Brigadier General Francis Marion ( 1732 – February 27, 1795), also known as the &quot;Swamp Fox&quot;, was an American military officer, planter, and politician who served during the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War. During the American Revolution, Marion supported the Patriot cause and enlisted in the Continental Army, fighting against British forces in the Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War from 1780 to 1781. 

Though he never commanded a field army or served as a commander in a major engagement, Marion&#x27;s use of irregular warfare against the British has led him to be considered one of the fathers of guerrilla and maneuver warfare, and his tactics form a part of the modern-day military doctrine of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 75th Ranger Regiment.

==Early life==
Francis Marion was born in Berkeley County, Province of South Carolina around 1732. His father Gabriel Marion was a Huguenot who emigrated to the Thirteen Colonies from France at some point prior to 1700 due to the Edict of Fontainebleau and became a slaveowning planter. Marion was born on his family&#x27;s plantation, and at approximately the age of 15, he was hired on a merchant ship bound for the West Indies which sank on his first voyage; the crew escaped on a lifeboat but had to spend one week at sea before reaching land. In the following years, Marion managed the family&#x27;s plantation, including overseeing the activities of the family&#x27;s slaves.

Marion began his military career shortly before his 25th birthday. On January 1, 1757, Francis and his brother, Job, were recruited by Captain John Postell to serve in the South Carolina Militia during the French and Indian War. Marion also saw service during the Anglo-Cherokee War.

==American Revolutionary War==

===Early service===

During the American Revolution, Marion supported the Patriot cause and on June 21, 1775, he was commissioned as an officer in the Continental Army&#x27;s 2nd South Carolina Regiment (commanded by William Moultrie) at the rank of captain. Marion served with Moultrie in the defense of Fort Sullivan from a Royal Navy attack on June 28, 1776. In September 1776, the Continental Congress commissioned Marion as a lieutenant colonel. In the autumn of 1779, he took part in the siege of Savannah, a failed Franco-American attempt to capture the capital of Georgia which had been previously occupied by British forces.

===Siege of Charleston===

A British force led by Sir Henry Clinton entered South Carolina in the early spring of 1780 and laid siege to Charleston. Marion was not captured with the rest of the city&#x27;s garrison when Charleston capitulated on May 12, 1780, as he had broken an ankle in an accident and had left the city to recuperate. Clinton led part of the force that had captured Charleston back to New York, but a significant number stayed for operations under Lord Charles Cornwallis in the Carolinas. After the loss of Charleston and the defeats suffered by Isaac Huger&#x27;s men at the Battle of Monck&#x27;s Corner and Abraham Buford&#x27;s troops at the Battle of Waxhaws (near the North Carolina border, in what is now Lancaster County), Marion organized a small military unit, which at first consisted of between 20 and 70 men and was the only force then opposing the British in the region. At this point, Marion was still hobbling on his slowly healing ankle.

===Guerrilla campaigns===
Marion joined Major General Horatio Gates on July 27 just before the Battle of Camden, but Gates had formed a low opinion of Marion. Gates sent Marion towards the interior to gather intelligence on the British forces opposing them. He thus missed the battle, which resulted in a British victory. Marion showed himself to be a singularly able leader of irregular militiamen and ruthless in his terrorizing of Loyalists. Unlike the Continental Army, Marion&#x27;s Men, as they were known, served without pay, supplied their own horses, arms and often their food. Marion&#x27;s Men operated from a base camp on Snow&#x27;s Island in Florence County.

Marion rarely committed his men to frontal warfare but repeatedly bewildered larger bodies of Loyalists or British regulars with quick surprise attacks and equally sudden withdrawal from the field. After their capture of Charleston, the British garrisoned South Carolina with help from local Loyalists, except for Williamsburg, which they were never able to hold. The British made one attempt to garrison Williamsburg at the colonial village of Hilltown but were driven out by Marion at the Battle of Black Mingo. 

A state-erected information sign at Marion&#x27;s gravesite on the former Belle Isle Plantation shows that he was engaged in twelve major battles and skirmishes in a two-year period: Black Mingo Creek on September 28, 1780; Tearcoat Swamp on October 25, 1780; Georgetown (four attacks) between October 1780 and May 1781; Fort Watson on April 23, 1781; Fort Motte on May 12, 1781; Quinby Bridge on July 17, 1781; Parker&#x27;s Ferry on August 13, 1781; Eutaw Springs on September 8, 1781; and Wadboo Plantation on August 29, 1782. Cornwallis observed, &quot;Colonel Marion had so wrought the minds of the people, partly by the terror of his threats and cruelty of his punishments, and partly by the promise of plunder, that there was scarcely an inhabitant between the Santee and the Pee Dee that was not in arms against us.&quot;

===Engagements with Tarleton===
The British made repeated efforts to neutralize Marion&#x27;s force, but Marion&#x27;s intelligence gathering was excellent and that of the British was poor, due to the overwhelming Patriot presence in the Williamsburg area. Colonel Banastre Tarleton was sent to capture or kill Marion in November 1780. After pursuing Marion&#x27;s troops for over 26 miles through a swamp, Tarleton supposedly said &quot;as for this old fox, the Devil himself could not catch him.&quot; Based on this tale, Marion&#x27;s supporters began to call him &quot;the Swamp Fox&quot;. 

Once Marion had shown his ability at guerrilla warfare, making himself a serious nuisance to the British, Governor John Rutledge commissioned him as a brigadier general of militia. Marion fought against freed slaves working or fighting alongside the British. He received an order from Rutledge to execute all Black people suspected of carrying provisions or gathering intelligence for the British &quot;agreeable to the laws of this State&quot;.

===End of the war===

When Major General Nathanael Greene took command in the South, Marion and Lieutenant Colonel Henry Lee III were ordered in January 1781 to attack Georgetown, but were unsuccessful. In April, they took Fort Watson. In May, they captured Fort Motte, breaking communications between British outposts in the Carolinas. On August 31, Marion rescued a small American force trapped by 500 British soldiers, under the leadership of Major C. Fraser. For this action he received the thanks of the Continental Congress. Marion commanded the right wing under General Greene at the Battle of Eutaw Springs.

In January 1782, he was elected to the South Carolina General Assembly at Jacksonborough and left his troops to take up his seat. During his absence, Marion&#x27;s men grew disheartened, particularly after a British sortie from Charleston, and there was reportedly a conspiracy to turn him over to the British. But in June of that year, he put down a Loyalist rebellion on the banks of the Pee Dee River. In August, Marion left his unit and returned to his slave plantation, Pond Bluff. In 1782, the British Parliament suspended offensive operations in America, and in December 1782, the British withdrew their garrison from Charleston. The Treaty of Paris brought the war to an end.

==Later life and death==

After Marion returned to Pond Bluff, he discovered it had been destroyed during the war. Of the roughly 200 people who had been enslaved on it before the war, most of them fled the plantation, with some joining the British as Clinton had issued the Philipsburg Proclamation offering Patriot enslaved people freedom. Marion&#x27;s enslaved people who had joined the British were evacuated from Charleston at the end of the war and at least one settled in Nova Scotia. Meanwhile, 10 of the people he had enslaved had moved to Belle Isle, a plantation owned by Marion&#x27;s brother Gabriel, during the war. Four house slaves had also moved Gabriel&#x27;s plantation, all of whom had been singled out for favorable treatment in Marion&#x27;s prewar will: overseer June and his wife, Chloe; their daughter Phoebe (sister of Buddy, Marion&#x27;s enslaved manservant); and her daughter Peggy.

These enslaved people, together with the 10 field hands, went back with him to Pond Bluff. After the war, Marion borrowed money to purchase more enslaved people for his plantation. At the age of 54, Marion married his 49-year old cousin, Mary Esther Videau. Marion served several terms in the South Carolina State Senate. In 1784, in recognition of his services, he was made commander of Fort Johnson, a sinecure with an annual salary of $500 (at the time, privates in the First American Regiment were paid $6.67 a month. ) He died on his plantation in 1795, at the age of 63, and was buried at Belle Isle Plantation Cemetery in Berkeley County, South Carolina.

==Legacy==

The public memory of Marion has been shaped in large part by the first biography about him, &quot;The Life of General Francis Marion&quot;, written by Mason Locke Weems and based on the memoirs of South Carolinian soldier Peter Horry. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has described Weems as one of the &quot;early hagiographers&quot; of American literature &quot;who elevated the Swamp Fox, Francis Marion, into the American pantheon.&quot; Weems is known for having invented the apocryphal &quot;cherry tree&quot; anecdote about George Washington, and &quot;Marion&#x27;s life received similar embellishment&quot;, as Amy Crawford wrote in &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine in 2007. In the 1835 novel &quot;Horse-Shoe Robinson&quot; by John P. Kennedy, a historical romance set against the background of the Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War, Marion appears and interacts with the fictional characters. In the book, he is depicted as decisive, enterprising, and valiant.

Hans Conried portrayed Marion in an episode of the &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot; television series, &quot;The Swamp Fox&quot;, which was broadcast on October 25, 1955. Walt Disney Productions produced &quot;The Swamp Fox&quot;, an eight-episode mini-series about Marion that aired from 1959 to 1961. It starred Leslie Nielsen as Marion, and Nielsen was also one of the singers of the theme song. The series depicted Mary Videau (who in the series has no familial relationship with Marion) secretly acting as an informant for Marion on British movements and Marion&#x27;s nephew Gabriel Marion being killed by Loyalists, causing Marion to seek revenge on those responsible.

Marion was one of the influences for the main character of Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) in the 2000 movie &quot;The Patriot&quot;, which, according to Crawford, &quot;exaggerated the Swamp Fox legend for a whole new generation.&quot; The contrast between the film&#x27;s depiction of Marion &quot;as a family man and hero who single-handedly defeats countless hostile Brits&quot; and the real-life Marion was one of the &quot;egregious oversights&quot; that &quot;Time&quot; magazine cited when listing &quot;The Patriot&quot; as number one of its &quot;Top 10 historically misleading films&quot; in 2011. In the film, Martin describes violence that he committed in the French and Indian War. Around the time of the film&#x27;s release, comments in the British press challenged the American notion of Marion as a hero. In the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, the British author Neil Norman called him &quot;a thoroughly unpleasant dude who was, basically, a terrorist.&quot; 

Concurrently, the British historian Christopher Hibbert described Marion as &quot;very active in the persecution of the Cherokee Indians and not at all the sort of chap who should be celebrated as a hero. The truth is that people like Marion committed atrocities as bad, if not worse, than those perpetrated by the British.&quot; According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;it seems that Marion was slaughtering Indians for fun and regularly raping his female slaves&quot;. According to John Oller&#x27;s 2016 biography, &quot;The Swamp Fox: How Francis Marion Saved the American Revolution&quot;, the allegation about Marion raping slaves is untrue. Marion enjoyed generally good relations with his slaves, including Peggy, the mixed-raced daughter of a Native American man and an African American woman. In an early will created when he was single, Marion freed Peggy and endowed her education, contrary to South Carolina law at the time, which made it a crime to teach slaves to write. Oller writes that there is no proof, either, that Marion personally committed any atrocities during the Anglo-Cherokee War, at least as a matter of choice, although he participated in some by order of his commander James Grant.

In a commentary published in the &quot;National Review&quot;, the conservative talk radio host Michael Graham rejected criticisms like Hibbert&#x27;s as an attempt to rewrite history:

 Graham also referred to what he describes as &quot;the unchallenged work of South Carolina&#x27;s premier historian Dr. Walter Edgar, who pointed out in his 1998 &quot;South Carolina: A History&quot; that Marion&#x27;s partisans were &quot;a ragged band of both black and white volunteers.&quot;

English historian Hugh Bicheno compared Marion&#x27;s behavior with British officers during the war, including Tarleton and Major James Wemyss. Referring to Marion, Tarleton and Wemyss, Bicheno wrote that &quot;they all tortured prisoners, hanged fence-sitters, abused parole and flags of truce, and shot their own men when they failed to live up to the harsh standards they set.&quot; According to Crawford, the biographies by historians William Gilmore Simms (&quot;The Life of Francis Marion&quot;) and Hugh Rankin can be regarded as generally accurate. The introduction to the 2007 edition of Simms&#x27;s book (originally published in 1844) was written by Sean Busick, a professor of American history at Athens State University in Alabama, who says that based on the facts, &quot;Marion deserves to be remembered as one of the heroes of the War for Independence.&quot; Crawford commented:

==Landmarks==

Numerous locations in the U.S. are named after Francis Marion, including the Francis Marion National Forest near Charleston, South Carolina. The city of Marion, Iowa holds an annual Swamp Fox Festival. Marion County, South Carolina, and its county seat, the City of Marion, are named for Marion. The city features a statue of General Marion in the town square, and has a museum which includes many artifacts related to Francis Marion; the Marion High School mascot is the Swamp Fox. Francis Marion University is located nearby in Florence County, South Carolina. The Swamp Fox is a wooden roller coaster located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. In Washington, D.C., Marion Park is one of the four large parks in the Capitol Hill Parks constellation. The park is bounded by 4th &amp; 6th Streets and at the intersection of E Street and South Carolina Avenue in southeast Washington, D.C. 

The Francis Marion Hotel is a historic hotel in downtown Charleston, South Carolina. Within the hotel is a restaurant called the Swamp Fox. The municipalities of Marion in Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, and Marion Center, Pennsylvania are named for Francis Marion. Marion County, Indiana (of which the city of Indianapolis is a part), is named for the general, as are Marion Counties in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia, and more than 30 townships in nine states. The Military Junior College Marion Military Institute in Marion, Alabama has an organization called Swamp Fox which is attributed to Francis Marion. The marionberry is named after the county in Oregon and so derives its name from him. 

The 169th Fighter Wing of the South Carolina Air National Guard, located about 12 miles east of Columbia in Eastover, South Carolina, boasts the title &quot;Home of the Swamp Fox&quot; and has an image of the face of a fox painted on the body of their F-16 Fighter Jets. The South Carolina State Guard, the successor to the South Carolina Militia, charters the Swamp Fox Explorer Post 1670 through the national division of Exploring (Learning for Life) for youth 14 to 20 years of age. In 1994, Marion was posthumously inducted into the U.S. Army Ranger Hall of Fame. 

In 2006, the United States House of Representatives approved a monument to Francis Marion, to be built in Washington, D.C., sometime in 2007–2008. The bill died in the Senate and was reintroduced in January 2007. The Brigadier General Francis Marion Memorial Act of 2007 passed the House of Representatives in March 2007, and the Senate in April 2008. The bill was packaged into the omnibus Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, which passed both houses and was enacted in May 2008. Although a site at Marion Park was selected, it was not built before authorization expired in 2018. Some local residents opposed a monument to a slaveowner. The U.S. Navy was home to the USS &quot;Francis Marion&quot;, a &quot;Paul Revere&quot;-class attack transport. The ship served as the flag for COMPHIBGRU 2 (Commander Amphibious Group 2). For many years, Submarine Squadron Four at the Charleston Naval Base called itself the Swamp Fox Squadron.

<text>The Rhône ( , ; Occitan: &quot;Ròse&quot;; Arpitan: &quot;Rôno&quot;) is a major river in France and Switzerland, rising in the Alps and flowing west and south through Lake Geneva and Southeastern France before discharging into the Mediterranean Sea (Gulf of Lion). At Arles, near its mouth, the river divides into the Great Rhône () and the Little Rhône (). The resulting delta forms the Camargue region.

The river&#x27;s source is the Rhône Glacier, at the east edge of the Swiss canton of Valais. The glacier is part of the Saint-Gotthard Massif, which gives rise to three other major rivers: the Reuss, Rhine and Ticino.

The Rhône is, with the Po and the Nile, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Rhône&quot; continues the Latin name (Greek ) in Greco-Roman geography. The Gaulish name of the river was or (from a PIE root *&quot;ret-&quot; &quot;to run, roll&quot; frequently found in river names).

Names in other languages include ; ; ; ; ; and .

The Greco-Roman as well as the reconstructed Gaulish name is masculine, as is French . This form survives in the Spanish/Portuguese and Italian namesakes, and , respectively. German has adopted the French name but given it the feminine gender, . The original German adoption of the Latin name was also masculine, ; it survives only in the Upper Valais (dialectal ).

In French, the adjective derived from the river is , as in (literally &quot;the furrow of the Rhône&quot;), which is the name of the long, straight Saône and Rhône river valleys, a deep cleft running due south to the Mediterranean and separating the Alps from the Massif Central.

== Navigation ==
Before railroads and highways were developed, the Rhône was an important inland trade and transportation route, connecting the cities of Arles, Avignon, Valence, Vienne and Lyon to the Mediterranean ports of Fos-sur-Mer, Marseille and Sète. Travelling down the Rhône by barge would take three weeks. By motorized vessel, the trip now takes only three days. The Rhône is classified as a Class V waterway for the section from the mouth of the Saône at Lyon to the sea at Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rhône. Upstream from Lyon, a section of the Rhône was made navigable for small ships up to Seyssel. , the part between Lyon and Sault-Brénaz is closed for navigation.

The Saône, which is also canalized, connects the Rhône ports to the cities of Villefranche-sur-Saône, Mâcon and Chalon-sur-Saône. Smaller vessels (up to CEMT class I) can travel further northwest, north and northeast via the Centre-Loire-Briare and Loing Canals to the Seine, via the Canal de la Marne à la Saône (recently often called the &quot;Canal entre Champagne et Bourgogne&quot;) to the Marne, via the Canal des Vosges (formerly called the &quot;Canal de l&#x27;Est – Branche Sud&quot;) to the Moselle and via the Canal du Rhône au Rhin to the Rhine.

The Rhône is infamous for its strong current when the river carries large quantities of water: current speeds up to are sometimes reached, particularly in the stretch below the last lock at Vallabrègues and in the relatively narrow first diversion canal south of Lyon. The 12 locks are operated daily from 5:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. All operation is centrally controlled from one control centre at Châteauneuf. Commercial barges may navigate during the night hours by authorisation.

==Course==


The Rhône begins as the meltwater of the Rhône Glacier in Valais, in the Swiss Alps, at an altitude of approximately . From there it flows southwest through Gletsch and the Goms, the uppermost valley region of the Valais before Brig. In the Brig area, it receives the waters of the Massa from the Aletsch Glacier, the longest glacier of the Alps, and shortly after, it receives the waters of the Vispa, the longest affluent in Valais. After that, it flows onward through the valley which bears its name and runs initially in a westerly direction about thirty kilometers to Leuk, then southwest about fifty kilometers to Martigny.

Down as far as Brig, the Rhône is a torrent; it then becomes a great mountain river running southwest through a glacial valley. Between Brig and Martigny, it collects waters mostly from the valleys of the Pennine Alps to the south, whose rivers originate from the large glaciers of the massifs of Monte Rosa, Dom, and Grand Combin, but also from the steeper slopes of the Bernese Alps to the north, and the Mont Blanc massif to the west. As a result, the Rhône Valley experiences a drier climate than the rest of Switzerland, being sheltered by the three highest ranges of the Alps, making Valais the driest and largest wine region of the country.

At Martigny, where it receives the waters of the Drance on its left bank, the Rhône makes a sharp turn towards the north. Heading toward Lake Geneva (), the valley narrows near Saint-Maurice, a feature that has long given the Rhône valley strategic importance for the control of the Alpine passes. The Rhône then marks the boundary between the cantons of Valais (left bank) and Vaud (right bank), separating two parts of the historical region of Chablais. It then enters Lake Geneva near Le Bouveret, where the water flows west.

On the left (south) bank of Lake Geneva, the river Morge joins at the village of Saint-Gingolph, and also marks the French-Swiss border. Westward, the Dranse (unrelated to the Drance) enters the lake with its preserved delta, and then the Hermance marks another French-Swiss border. Between the Morge and Hermance, the lake is divided by the two countries along its centreline, with the left bank in France. The remainder of the lake is Swiss, including the entire right (north) bank. Here, the tributaries are the Veveyse, the Venoge, the Aubonne, the Morges, among other smaller rivers.

Lake Geneva ends in the city of Geneva, where the lake level is controlled by the . The average discharge from Lake Geneva is . Below the dam, the Rhône receives the waters of the Arve, fed by the Mont Blanc massif, with a visibly higher sediment load and much lower temperature.

After a total of in Switzerland, the Rhône continues west, entering France and the southern Jura Mountains. It turns toward the south, past Lac de Bourget, which the Rhône drains via the Canal de Savières. Continuing generally westward, the Rhône then receives the waters of the Valserine, enters the reservoir created by the Génissiat Dam, and is then joined by the Ain.
Reaching Lyon, the most populous city on its course, the Rhône receives its biggest tributary, the Saône, with an average flow of , compared to the Rhône&#x27;s at this point. From this confluence, the Rhône follows a southward course. Along the Rhône Valley, it is joined on the right (western) bank by the rivers Eyrieux, Ardèche, Cèze, and Gardon coming from the Cévennes mountains; and on the left bank by the rivers Isère, (with an average discharge of ), Drôme, Ouvèze, and Durance () from the Alps.

From Lyon, the Rhône flows south, in its large valley between the Alps and the Massif Central. At Arles, the Rhône divides into two major arms forming the Camargue delta, both branches flowing into the Mediterranean Sea, the delta being termed the Rhône Fan. The larger arm is called the &quot;Grand Rhône&quot;, the smaller the &quot;Petit Rhône&quot;. The average annual discharge at Beaucaire is .

==History==

The Rhône has been an important highway since the times of the Greeks and Romans. It was the main trade route from the Mediterranean to east-central Gaul. As such, it helped convey Greek cultural influences to the western Hallstatt and the later La Tène cultures. Celtic tribes living near the Rhône included the Seduni, Sequani, Segobriges, Allobroges, Segusiavi, Helvetii, Vocontii and Volcae Arecomici.

Navigation was difficult, as the river suffered from fierce currents, shallows, floods in spring and early summer when the ice was melting, and droughts in late summer. Until the 19th century, passengers travelled in &quot;coches d&#x27;eau&quot; (water coaches) drawn by men or horses, or under sail. Most travelled with a painted cross covered with religious symbols as protection against the hazards of the journey.

Trade on the upper river used &quot;barques du Rhône&quot;, sailing barges, , with a capacity. As many as 50 to 80 horses were employed to haul trains of five to seven craft upstream. Goods would be transshipped at Arles into sailing barges called &quot;allèges d&#x27;Arles&quot; for the final run down to the Mediterranean.

The first experimental steam boat was built at Lyon by Jouffroy d&#x27;Abbans in 1783. Regular services were not started until 1829 and they continued until 1952. Steam passenger vessels long made up to and could do the downstream run from Lyon to Arles in a day. Cargo was hauled in &quot;bateau-anguilles&quot;, boats with paddle wheels amidships, and &quot;bateaux crabes&quot;, a huge toothed &quot;claw&quot;wheel across to grip the river bed in the shallows to supplement the paddle wheels. In the 20th century, powerful motor barges propelled by diesel engines were introduced, carrying .

In 1933, the Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR) was established to improve navigation and generate electricity, also to develop irrigated agriculture and to protect the riverside towns and land from flooding. Some progress was made in deepening the navigation channel and constructing scouring walls, but World War II brought such work to a halt. In 1942, following the collapse of Vichy France, Italian military forces occupied southeastern France up to the eastern banks of the Rhône, as part of the Italian Fascist regime&#x27;s expansionist agenda.

=== Postwar development ===
In 1948, the French government started construction of a series of dams and diversion canals, with a navigation lock beside the hydroelectric power plant on each of these canals. The locks were up to deep. After building the Génissiat dam on the Upper Rhône (with no lock) in 1948, designed to meet the electricity needs of Paris, twelve hydroelectric plants and locks were built between 1964 and 1980. With a total head of , they produce 13 GWh of electricity annually, or 16% of the country&#x27;s total hydroelectric production (20% if the Upper Rhône schemes are added). There have been significant benefits for agriculture throughout the Rhône valley.

With the Lower Rhône project completed, CNR turned its attention to the Haut-Rhône (Upper Rhône), and built four hydropower dams in the 1980s: Sault-Brénaz, Brégnier-Cordon, Belley-Brens and Chautagne. It also drew up plans for the high-capacity Rhine-Rhône Waterway, along the route of the existing Canal du Rhône au Rhin, but this project was abandoned in 1997. In the period from 2005 to 2010, navigation locks of small barge dimensions (40 by 6 m) were built to bypass the last two, forming a navigable waterway network with Lake Bourget, through the Canal de Savières.

<text>Rhône (; ) is a French department located in the east-central administrative region of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. Named after the river Rhône, its prefecture is Lyon. Its sole subprefecture is Villefranche-sur-Saône. Including the Lyon Metropolis, it had a population of 1,875,747 in 2019.

== History ==
The department was created on August 12, 1793, when the former Rhône-et-Loire was split into two departments: Rhône and Loire.

Originally, the eastern border of Rhône was the city of Lyon itself, so that the communes immediately east of Lyon belonged to neighboring departments. With the growth of Lyon and the extension of its urban area into communes such as Villeurbanne, the limits of the department were judged impractical as they left the suburbs of Lyon outside of Rhône. Thus, Rhône was enlarged several times to incorporate into it the suburbs of Lyon from neighboring department:
* In 1852, four communes from Isère were incorporated into Rhône.
* In 1967, 23 communes of Isère and six communes of Ain were incorporated into Rhône.
* In 1971, one commune from Isère was incorporated into Rhône.

With these enlargements, the area of the department increased from 2,791 km2 to 3,249 km2 (16.4% larger). At the 1999 French census, the original department of Rhône would have had only 1,071,288 inhabitants, which means that the population in the territories added in the last two centuries was 507,581 inhabitants in 1999.

In 2015 the Metropolis of Lyon was separated from the department of Rhône. Rhône lost 16% of its territory, and 75% of its population. Lyon, although no longer part of the department, remains its administrative center.

== Geography ==

Rivers include the Rhône and the Saône (which joins the Rhône in Lyon). The neighboring departments are Ain, Isère, Loire and Saône-et-Loire.

==Demographics==
Population development since 1801 (with Lyon Metropolis) :

Before the Metropolis of Lyon was separated from the department, over 75% of its population lived within the Greater Lyon, which included all of the largest cities of the Rhône department, apart from Villefranche-sur-Saône.

The most populous commune of the new department of Rhône is Villefranche-sur-Saône. As of 2019, there are 5 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

== Politics ==
The President of the Departmental Council has been Christophe Guilloteau since 2015, a member of The Republicans (LR).

===Current National Assembly representatives===
This list includes representatives from the Lyon Metropolis created in 2015 as a separate department.

<doc id="80793" wikidata="Q502600" url="?curid=80793" title="Amiga Chip RAM">
<text>Chip RAM is a commonly used term for the integrated RAM used in Commodore&#x27;s line of Amiga computers. Chip RAM is shared between the central processing unit (CPU) and the Amiga&#x27;s dedicated chipset (hence the name). It was also, rather misleadingly, known as &quot;graphics RAM&quot;.

== Direct memory access ==
Under the Amiga architecture, the direct memory access (DMA) controller is integrated into the Agnus (Alice on AGA models) chip. Both the CPU and other members of the chipset have to arbitrate for access to shared RAM via Agnus. This allows the custom chips to perform video, audio, or other DMA operations independently of the CPU. As the 68000 processor used in early Amiga systems usually only accesses memory on every second memory cycle, Agnus operates a system where the &quot;odd&quot; clock cycle is allocated to time-critical custom chip access and the &quot;even&quot; cycle is allocated to the CPU: thus, for average DMA demand, the CPU is not typically blocked from memory access and may run without interruption. However, certain chipset DMA, such as high-resolution graphics with a larger color palette, Copper, or blitter operations, can use any spare cycles, effectively blocking cycles from the CPU. In such situations CPU cycles are only blocked while accessing shared RAM, but never when accessing Fast (CPU-only) RAM (when present) or ROM.

== Chip RAM by model ==
Most stock Amiga systems were equipped with Chip RAM only and shipped with between 256 kiB and 2 MiB.

The shared RAM data bus is 16-bit on OCS and ECS systems. The later AGA systems use a 32-bit data bus controlled by the Alice coprocessor (replacing Agnus) and 32-bit RAM. The memory clock runs at double the rate on AGA systems. As a result, chipset RAM bandwidth is increased fourfold compared to the earlier 16-bit design. However, 32-bit access is limited to CPU and graphics DMA and cannot be used for other devices. The ECS-based A3000 also has 32-bit Chip RAM, but access is only 32-bit for CPU operations; the chipset remained 16-bit.

The maximum amount of Chip RAM is dependent on the Agnus/Alice version. The original Agnus chip fitted to the A1000 and early A2000 systems is a 48-pin DIP package able to address 512 KiB of Chip RAM. Subsequent versions of the Agnus are in an 84-pin PLCC package (either socketed or surface-mounted). All models except the A1000 are upgradable to 2 MiB of Chip RAM. The A500 and the early A2000B can accommodate 1 MiB by installing a later revision Agnus chip (8732A) with minimal hardware modifications; late-production machines usually already contained that chip, so that only jumper modifications were necessary. Likewise, 2 MB can be installed by fitting an 8372B Agnus and extra memory.

The maximum amount of Chip RAM in any model is 2 MiB. The Amiga 4000 motherboard includes a non-functional jumper that anticipated later chips and is labeled for 8 MiB of Chip RAM—regardless of its position, the system only recognizes 2 MiB due to the limitations of the Alice chip. However, the software emulator UAE can emulate an Amiga system with the design limit of up to 8 MiB of Chip RAM.

== Fast RAM ==
Amiga systems can also be expanded with Fast RAM, which is only accessible to the CPU. This improves execution speed, as CPU cycles are never blocked even when the custom chipset is simultaneously accessing Chip RAM. Adding Fast RAM to systems with 32-bit CPUs roughly doubles the instruction speed, as the more advanced 68020, &#x27;030, and &#x27;040 CPUs can utilize more memory cycles than the earlier 68000.

Confusingly, a system may have several different kinds and speeds of Fast RAM. For example, an Amiga 3000 may contain 16-bit Zorro II expansion RAM, 32-bit Zorro III expansion RAM, 32-bit motherboard RAM, and 32-bit CPU card RAM simultaneously (in increasing speed order). Automatically configured RAM is prioritized by the system, so the fastest memory is used first.

Early versions of the Amiga 2000B, and the most common &quot;trapdoor memory expanded&quot; configuration of the Amiga 500, contain 512 KiB pseudo-fast RAM (&quot;slow RAM&quot;) controlled by Agnus with the same limitations as Chip RAM, yet unusable as such due to register limitations. Numerous budget trapdoor expansions for the 500 extended this &quot;controllerless&quot; concept to up to 1.8 MB slow RAM (requiring a Gary adapter for addressing).

<text>Mobile County ( ) is a county located in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Alabama. It is the third-most populous county in the state after Jefferson and Madison counties. As of the 2020 census, its population was 414,809. Its county seat is Mobile, which was founded as a deepwater port on the Mobile River. The only such port in Alabama, it has long been integral to the economy for providing access to inland waterways as well as the Gulf of Mexico.

The city, river, and county were named in honor of &quot;Maubila&quot;, a village of the paramount chief Tuskaloosa of the regional Mississippian culture. In 1540 he arranged an ambush of soldiers of Hernando de Soto&#x27;s expedition in an effort to expel them from the territory. The Spaniards were armed with guns and killed many of the tribe. Mobile County and Washington County, Alabama make up the Mobile Metropolitan Statistical Area with a 2020 population of 430,197. The Mobile, AL MSA and Daphne-Fairhope-Foley, AL MSA make up the much larger Mobile-Daphne-Fairhope CSA with a 2020 population of 661,964.

The northern border of Mobile County and southern area of neighboring Washington County constitute the homeland of the state-recognized tribe of MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians, descendants of Choctaw and Creek who stayed in this area during the period of Indian Removal. They have organized to preserve their culture and language. They were the first of nine tribes to be recognized by the state.

==History==
This area was occupied for thousands of years by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. At the time of Spanish expeditions in the early 16th century, it was part of the territory of the Mississippian culture, which constructed major earthwork mounds. It was ruled by the paramount chief Tuskaloosa.

The historic Choctaw emerged somewhat later, and are believed to be descendants of those earlier peoples. They occupied this area along what early French traders and colonists called the Mobile River. They also founded the settlement of Mobile on the river and bay in the early eighteenth century.

The British took over the territory in 1763 (along with other French territories east of the Mississippi River) after defeating the French in the Seven Years&#x27; War. During the American Revolutionary War, it came under Spanish rule as part of Spanish Florida. Spain ceded the territory to the United States after the War of 1812.

In the 1830s, the United States forced the removal of most of the Native American tribes in the area under President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s policy and an act of Congress to relocate them to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Many of those who remained continued their culture, and took refuge in the swamps in the border area between Mobile and Washington counties. Since the late 20th century, several tribes have reorganized and gained state recognition. Among those is the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians, which was recognized as a tribe in 1979 by the state. The people have long been based in this area of the former Choctaw homeland, along the northern border of Mobile County and the southern border of Washington County.

After more than a century of European settlement, beginning with French colonists, Mobile County was organized by the state legislature and the proclamation of Governor Holmes of the Mississippi Territory on December 18, 1812.
When Mississippi was separated and admitted as a state on December 10, 1817, after adopting its constitution on August 15, 1817, Mobile County became part of what was called the Alabama Territory. Two years later, the county became part of the state of Alabama, granted statehood on December 14, 1819.

The city of Mobile, first settled by French colonists in the early 18th century as part of &quot;La Louisiane,&quot; was designated as the county seat from the early days of the county. Both the county and city derive their name from Fort Louis de la Mobile, a French fortification established (near present-day Axis, Alabama) in 1702. The word &quot;Mobile&quot; is believed to stem from a Choctaw word for &quot;paddlers&quot;. The area was occupied by French colonists from 1702 to 1763, and their influence has been strong in the city. It was ruled by the British from 1763 to 1780, when more American colonists began to enter the territory; and controlled by the Spanish from 1780 to 1813.

At the end of the War of 1812, the United States took over the territory. At that time, new settlers were being attracted to the land, eager to develop short-staple cotton in the uplands area. Invention of the cotton gin made processing of this type of cotton profitable, stimulating wholesale development of new cotton plantations in the Black Belt during the antebellum years. Mobile developed as a major deepwater port; in the nineteenth century, cotton was its major export.

There were nine documented lynchings in Mobile from 1891 to 1981. 
* March 31, 1891 — Zachariah Graham

<text>Calvados (, , ) is a brandy from Normandy in France, made from apples and/or pears.

==History==
===In France===

Apple orchards and brewers are mentioned as far back as the 8th century by Charlemagne. The first known record of Norman distillation was made by squire Gilles de Gouberville in 1553, and the guild for cider distillation was created about 50 years later in 1606. In the 17th century, the traditional cider farms expanded, but taxation and prohibition of cider brandies were enforced elsewhere than Brittany, Maine, and Normandy. The area called &quot;Calvados&quot; was created after the French Revolution, but &quot;eau de vie de cidre&quot; was already called &quot;calvados&quot; in common usage.

In the 19th century, output increased with industrial distillation and the working class fashion for &quot;café-calva&quot;. When a phylloxera outbreak in the last quarter of the 19th century devastated the vineyards of France and Europe, Calvados experienced a golden age. During World War I, cider brandy was requisitioned to make explosives for the armament industry due to its alcohol content. The &quot;appellation contrôlée&quot; regulations officially gave AOC Calvados Pays d&#x27;Auge a protected name in 1942. After the war, many cider houses and distilleries were reconstructed, mainly in the Pays d&#x27;Auge. Many of the traditional farmhouse structures were replaced by modern agriculture with high output. The calvados appellation system was revised in 1984 and 1996. Pommeau got its recognition in 1991; in 1997, an appellation for Domfront with 30% pears was created.
===Elsewhere===
Cider brandy is also made in the UK, and appears in records going back to 1678. Somerset cider brandy gained European protected geographical indication (PGI) status in 2011.

==Production==

Calvados is distilled from cider made from specially grown and selected apples, from over 200 named varieties. It is not uncommon for a calvados producer to use over 100 specific varieties of apples which are either sweet (such as the &#x27;Rouge Duret&#x27; variety), tart (such as the &#x27;Rambault&#x27; variety), or bitter (such as the &#x27;Mettais&#x27;, &#x27;Saint Martin&#x27;, &#x27;Frequin&#x27;, and &#x27;Binet Rouge&#x27; varieties), the latter being inedible.

The fruit is harvested and pressed into a juice that is fermented into a dry cider. It is then distilled into &quot;eau de vie&quot;. After two or three years of aging in oak casks, it can be sold as calvados. The longer it is aged, the smoother the drink becomes. Usually, the maturation goes on for several years.

==Double and single distillation==

The appellation of AOC (&quot;appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot;) for calvados authorizes double distillation for all calvados, but it is required for the &quot;Calvados Pays d&#x27;Auge&quot;.

* Double distillation is carried out in a traditional alembic pot still, called either &quot;l&#x27;alambic à repasse&quot; or &quot;charentais&quot;
* Single continuous distillation in a column still

The usual arguments for and against the two processes are that the former process gives the spirit complexity and renders it suitable for longer aging, whilst the latter process gives the calvados a fresh and clean apple flavour but with less complexity. A growing belief indicates that a well-operated column still can produce as complex and &quot;age-able&quot; calvados as double distillation.

==Producing regions and legal definitions==

Like many French wines, calvados is governed by &quot;appellation contrôlée&quot; regulations. The three appellations for calvados are:

* The AOC calvados area includes all of the Calvados, Manche, and Orne departments and parts of Eure, Mayenne, Sarthe, and Eure-et-Loir.
** AOC calvados makes up over 70% of the total production.
** A minimum of two years aging in oak barrels is required.
** The terroir, geographical area, is defined.
** The apples and pears are defined cider varieties.
** The procedures in production, such as pressing, fermentation, distillation, and ageing, are regulated.
** Usually, single-column distillation is used.
* The more restrictive AOC calvados Pays d&#x27;Auge area is limited to the east end of the department of Calvados and a few adjoining districts.
** Extensive quality control, the basic rules for AOC calvados together with several additional requirements, is practiced.
** Aging for a minimum of two years in oak barrels is required.
** Double distillation in an alembic pot-still is used.
** It must be produced within the designated area in Pays d&#x27;Auge.
** A minimum of six weeks of fermentation of the cider is required.
** Flavour elements are controlled.
* AOC calvados Domfrontais reflects the long tradition of pear orchards in the area, resulting in a unique fruity calvados. The regulation is similar to the AOC calvados and the column still is used.
** A minimum of 30% pears from the designated areas is used.
** A three-year minimum of aging in oak barrels is required.
** The orchards must consist of at least 15% pear trees (25% from the 16th harvest).
* Fermier calvados (&quot;farm-made&quot;) – some quality-minded producers both inside and outside the Pays d&#x27;Auge make &quot;fermier calvados&quot;, which indicates the calvados is entirely made on the farm in a traditional agricultural way according to high quality demands.

==Grades of quality==
The age on the bottle refers to the youngest constituent of the blend. A blend is often composed of old and young calvados. Producers can also use the terms below to refer to the age.

* &quot;VS&quot;, &quot;Trois étoiles&quot; ***, and &quot;Trois pommes&quot; must be at least two years old.
* &quot;Vieux&quot; or &quot;Réserve&quot; must be at least three years old.
* &quot;V.O.&quot; &quot;VO&quot;, &quot;Vieille Réserve&quot;, &quot;V.S.O.P.&quot;, or &quot;VSOP&quot; must be at least four years old.
* &quot;Extra&quot;, &quot;X.O.&quot; &quot;XO&quot;, &quot;Napoléon&quot;, &quot;Hors d&#x27;Age&quot;, &quot;Tres Vieille Reserve&quot; must be at least six years old, but are often sold much older.

High-quality calvados usually has parts which are much older than that mentioned. Calvados can be made from a single (generally, exceptionally good) year. When this happens, the label often carries that year.

==Tasting==
Calvados is the basis of the tradition of &quot;le trou Normand&quot;, or &quot;the Norman hole&quot;. This is a small drink of calvados taken between courses in a very long meal, sometimes with apple or pear sorbet, supposedly to reawaken the appetite. Calvados can be served as an &quot;apéritif&quot;, blended in drinks, between meals, as a &quot;digestif&quot;, or with coffee. Well-made calvados should naturally be reminiscent of apples and pears, balanced with flavours of aging. The less-aged calvados distinguishes itself with its fresh apple and pear aromas. The longer the calvados is aged, the more the taste resembles that of any other aged brandy. As calvados ages, it may become golden or darker brown with orange elements and red mahogany. The nose and palate are delicate with concentration of aged apples and dried apricots balanced with butterscotch, nut, and chocolate aromas.

==In the Canadian Forces==
Calvados is the regimental drink of &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada&quot;, &quot;The Royal Regina Rifles&quot;, &quot;The Royal Canadian Hussars&quot;, &quot;Le Régiment de Hull&quot;, &quot;Le Régiment de Maisonneuve&quot;, and &quot;The Sherbrooke Hussars&quot;. The troops were given Calvados as the units passed through Normandy following the D-Day invasion. Known as &quot;le trou normand&quot;, it is normally taken between courses at a regimental dinner, or during a toast to remember fallen soldiers.

==Desserts==
Calvados can also be combined with ice cream for a dessert known as Coupe Normande.

<text>A breadboard, solderless breadboard, or protoboard is a construction base used to build semi-permanent prototypes of electronic circuits. Unlike a perfboard or stripboard, breadboards do not require soldering or destruction of tracks and are hence reusable. For this reason, breadboards are also popular with students and in technological education.

A variety of electronic systems may be prototyped by using breadboards, from small analog and digital circuits to complete central processing units (CPUs).

Compared to more permanent circuit connection methods, modern breadboards have high parasitic capacitance, relatively high resistance, and less reliable connections, which are subject to jostle and physical degradation. Signaling is limited to about 10 MHz, and not everything works properly even well below that frequency.

== History ==
In the early days of radio, amateurs nailed bare copper wires or terminal strips to a wooden board (often literally a bread cutting board) and soldered electronic components to them. Sometimes a paper schematic diagram was first glued to the board as a guide to placing terminals, then components and wires were installed over their symbols on the schematic. Using thumbtacks or small nails as mounting posts was also common.

Breadboards have evolved over time with the term now being used for all kinds of prototype electronic devices. For example, US Patent 3,145,483, was filed in 1961 and describes a wooden plate breadboard with mounted springs and other facilities. US Patent 3,496,419, was filed in 1967 and refers to a particular printed circuit board layout as a &quot;Printed Circuit Breadboard&quot;. Both examples refer to and describe other types of breadboards as prior art. 

In 1960, Orville Thompson of DeVry Technical Institute patented a solderless breadboard connecting rows of holes together with spring metal. In 1971, Ronald Portugal of E&amp;L Instruments patented a similar concept with holes in spacings, the same as DIP IC packages, which became the basis of the modern solderless breadboard that is commonly used today.

* US Patent D228136, filed in 1971, &quot;Breadboard for electronic components or the like&quot;, E&amp;L Instruments. This is the modern solderless breadboard.
== Design ==
A modern solderless breadboard socket consists of a perforated block of plastic with numerous tin plated phosphor bronze or nickel silver alloy spring clips under the perforations. The clips are often called &quot;tie points&quot; or &quot;contact points&quot;. The number of tie points is often given in the specification of the breadboard.

The spacing between the clips (lead pitch) is typically . Integrated circuits (ICs) in dual in-line packages (DIPs) can be inserted to straddle the centerline of the block. Interconnecting wires and the leads of discrete components (such as capacitors, resistors, and inductors) can be inserted into the remaining free holes to complete the circuit. Where ICs are not used, discrete components and connecting wires may use any of the holes. Typically the spring clips are rated for 1 ampere at 5 volts and 0.333 amperes at 15 volts (5 watts).

===Bus and terminal strips===
Solderless breadboards connect pin to pin by metal strips inside the breadboard. The layout of a typical solderless breadboard is made up from two types of areas, called strips. Strips consist of interconnected electrical terminals. Often breadboard strips or blocks of one brand have male and female dovetail notches so boards can be clipped together to form a large breadboard.

The main areas, to hold most of the electronic components, are called &quot;terminal strips&quot;. In the middle of a terminal strip of a breadboard, one typically finds a notch running in parallel to the long side. The notch is to mark the centerline of the terminal strip and provides limited airflow (cooling) to DIP ICs straddling the centerline. The clips on the right and left of the notch are each connected in a radial way; typically five clips (i.e., beneath five holes) in a row on each side of the notch are electrically connected. The five columns on the left of the notch are often marked as A, B, C, D, and E, while the ones on the right are marked F, G, H, I and J. When a &quot;skinny&quot; dual in-line pin package (DIP) integrated circuit (such as a typical DIP-14 or DIP-16, which have a separation between the pin rows) is plugged into a breadboard, the pins of one side of the chip are supposed to go into column E while the pins of the other side go into column F on the other side of the notch. The rows are identified by numbers from 1 to as many the breadboard design goes. A full-size terminal breadboard strip typically consists of around 56 to 65 rows of connectors. Together with bus strips on each side this makes up a typical 784 to 910 tie point solderless breadboard. Most breadboards are designed to accommodate 17, 30 or 64 rows in the mini, half, and full configurations respectively.

To provide power to the electronic components, &quot;bus strips&quot; are used. A bus strip usually contains two columns: one for ground and one for a supply voltage. However, some breadboards only provide a single-column power distribution bus strip on each long side. Typically the row intended for a supply voltage is marked in red, while the row for ground is marked in blue or black. Some manufacturers connect all terminals in a column. Others just connect groups of, for example, 25 consecutive terminals in a column. The latter design provides a circuit designer with some more control over crosstalk (inductively coupled noise) on the power supply bus. Often the groups in a bus strip are indicated by gaps in the color marking. Bus strips typically run down one or both sides of a terminal strip or between terminal strips. On large breadboards additional bus strips can often be found on the top and bottom of terminal strips.

Some manufacturers provide separate bus and terminal strips. Others just provide breadboard blocks which contain both in one block.

=== Jump wires ===
Jump wires (also called jumper wires) for solderless breadboarding can be obtained in ready-to-use jump wire sets or can be manually manufactured. The latter can become tedious work for larger circuits. Ready-to-use jump wires come in different qualities, some even with tiny plugs attached to the wire ends. Jump wire material for ready-made or homemade wires should usually be 22 AWG (0.33 mm2) solid copper, tin-plated wire - assuming no tiny plugs are to be attached to the wire ends. The wire ends should be stripped . Shorter stripped wires might result in bad contact with the board&#x27;s spring clips (insulation being caught in the springs). Longer stripped wires increase the likelihood of short-circuits on the board. Needle-nose pliers and tweezers are helpful when inserting or removing wires, particularly on crowded boards.

Differently colored wires and color-coding discipline are often adhered to for consistency. However, the number of available colors is typically far fewer than the number of signal types or paths. Typically, a few wire colors are reserved for the supply voltages and ground (e.g., red, blue, black), some are reserved for main signals, and the rest are simply used where convenient. Some ready-to-use jump wire sets use the color to indicate the length of the wires, but these sets do not allow a meaningful color-coding schema.

=== Advanced designs ===

In a more robust variant, one or more breadboard strips are mounted on a sheet of metal. Typically, that backing sheet also holds a number of binding posts. These posts provide a clean way to connect an external power supply. This type of breadboard may be slightly easier to handle.

Some manufacturers provide high-end versions of solderless breadboards. These are typically high-quality breadboard modules mounted on a flat casing. The casing contains additional equipment for breadboarding, such as a power supply, one or more signal generators, serial interfaces, LED display or LCD modules, and logic probes.

For high-frequency development, a metal breadboard affords a desirable solderable ground plane, often an unetched piece of printed circuit board; integrated circuits are sometimes stuck upside down to the breadboard and soldered to directly, a technique sometimes called &quot;dead bug&quot; construction because of its appearance. Examples of dead bug with ground plane construction are illustrated in a Linear Technologies application note.

== Uses ==

A common use in the system on a chip (SoC) era is to obtain an microcontroller (MCU) on a pre-assembled printed circuit board (PCB) which exposes an array of input/output (IO) pins in a header suitable to plug into a breadboard, and then to prototype a circuit which exploits one or more of the MCU&#x27;s peripherals, such as general-purpose input/output (GPIO), UART/USART serial transceivers, analog-to-digital converter (ADC), digital-to-analog converter (DAC), pulse-width modulation (PWM; used in motor control), Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), or I²C. 

Firmware is then developed for the MCU to test, debug, and interact with the circuit prototype. High frequency operation is then largely confined to the SoC&#x27;s PCB. In the case of high speed interconnects such as SPI and I²C, these can be debugged at a lower speed and later rewired using a different circuit assembly methodology to exploit full-speed operation. A single small SoC often provides most of these electrical interface options in a form factor barely larger than a large postage stamp, available in the American hobby market (and elsewhere) for a few dollars, allowing fairly sophisticated breadboard projects to be created at modest expense.

== Limitations ==

Due to relatively large parasitic capacitance compared to a properly laid out PCB (approx 2 pF between adjacent contact columns), high inductance of some connections and a relatively high and not very reproducible contact resistance, solderless breadboards are limited to operation at relatively low frequencies, usually less than 10 MHz, depending on the nature of the circuit. The relatively high contact resistance can already be a problem for some DC and very low frequency circuits. Solderless breadboards are further limited by their voltage and current ratings.

Solderless breadboards usually cannot accommodate surface-mount technology devices (SMD) or components with grid spacing other than . Further, they cannot accommodate components with multiple rows of connectors if these connectors do not match the dual in-line layout—it is impossible to provide the correct electrical connectivity. Sometimes small PCB adapters called &quot;breakout adapters&quot; can be used to fit the component to the board. Such adapters carry one or more components and have spaced male connector pins in a single in-line or dual in-line layout, for insertion into a solderless breadboard. Larger components are usually plugged into a socket on the adapter, while smaller components (e.g., SMD resistors) are usually soldered directly onto the adapter. The adapter is then plugged into the breadboard via the connectors. However, the need to solder the components onto the adapter negates some of the advantage of using a solderless breadboard.

Very complex circuits can become unmanageable on a solderless breadboard due to the large amount of wiring required. The very convenience of easy plugging and unplugging of connections also makes it too easy to accidentally disturb a connection, and the system becomes unreliable. It is possible to prototype systems with thousands of connecting points, but great care must be taken in careful assembly, and such a system becomes unreliable as contact resistance develops over time. At some point, very complex systems must be implemented in a more reliable interconnection technology, to have a likelihood of working over a usable time period.

== Alternatives ==

Alternative methods to create prototypes are point-to-point construction (reminiscent of the original wooden breadboards), wire wrap, wiring pencil, and boards like the stripboard. Complicated systems, such as modern computers comprising millions of transistors, diodes, and resistors, do not lend themselves to prototyping using breadboards, as their complex designs can be difficult to lay out and debug on a breadboard.

Modern circuit designs are generally developed using a schematic capture and simulation system, and tested in software simulation before the first prototype circuits are built on a printed circuit board. Integrated circuit designs are a more extreme version of the same process: since producing prototype silicon is costly, extensive software simulations are performed before fabricating the first prototypes. However, prototyping techniques are still used for some applications such as RF circuits, or where software models of components are inexact or incomplete.

It is also possible to use a square grid of pairs of holes where one hole per pair connects to its row and the other connects to its column. This same shape can be in a circle with rows and columns each spiraling opposite clockwise/counterclockwise.

<text>Real Oviedo (Asturian: Real Uviéu) is a Spanish professional football club based in Oviedo, Asturias. Founded on 26 March 1926, the club plays in the Segunda División, the second tier of the Spanish football league system.
The club plays at the Estadio Carlos Tartiere, opened on 30 September 2000, and is the largest sports stadium in Asturias. In the all-time league table for the Spanish top division (La Liga), Oviedo ranks 18th, as it has played 38 seasons.

The club had 21,517 season ticket holders in the 2023–2024 season and their fans are called &quot;Carbayones&quot;. The club&#x27;s local rivals are Sporting Gijón on the sea coast to its north, with whom the club contests the Asturian derby.

Real Oviedo has also a women&#x27;s team, called Real Oviedo Femenino. It has played several times in the Spanish first division (Liga F) but now it competes in the third tier (Segunda Federación Femenina).

==History==
Founded in 1926 after a merger of &quot;Stadium Ovetense&quot; and &quot;Real Club Deportivo Oviedo.&quot; The first one was founded by young people who had studied in England, where the &quot;foot-ball&quot; was already popular. And the second club was founded a few years later by a split in the first. Carlos Tartiere served as the inaugural president when the club was established. Oviedo first reached La Liga seven years later.

Their attacking quartet of Emilín, Galé, Herrerita and Isidro Lángara (all represented Spain in this period), as well as Casuco and Ricardo Gallart modernised the game with their pace and running off the ball tied with sharp passing and one-touch football, played in a style 30/40 years before its time, being dubbed &quot;Delanteras Eléctricas&quot; (&quot;The electric forwards&quot;); all this was connected with a rigid training and fitness regime started by a former manager of the club, Englishman Fred Pentland. Lángara won the Pichichi Trophy three years in a row prior to the Spanish Civil War, as Oviedo broke all scoring records (174 goals in 62 league games). With the outbreak of the conflict, however, the team broke up: Lángara emigrated to South America, Herrerita and Emilín signed with FC Barcelona, Galé with Racing de Santander and Gallart with Racing de Ferrol.

When football in the country resumed in 1939, Oviedo could not play 1939–40 season, as their pitch was deemed unplayable – Francisco Franco&#x27;s troops had used the stadium as an ammunition dump. During the following decades, the club bounced back between the first and second levels, the high point being a best-ever third position in 1962–63 (ranking joint-first with Real Madrid after the first 15 rounds), while the lowest was the side&#x27;s first relegation to &quot;Segunda División B&quot;, in 1978 (for a single season).

With the FIFA World Cup to be held in Spain in 1982, the &quot;Carlos Tartiere Stadium&quot; was completely renewed, the first match being held with the Chile national team, 0–0. In 1984–85 Oviedo won the soon-to-be-defunct Spanish League Cup (second division), after successively defeating UD Salamanca, Bilbao Athletic, CF Lorca Deportiva, CE Sabadell FC and Atlético Madrileño (the latter with a 2–1 aggregate in the final).

In 1988 Oviedo returned to the top division, after ousting RCD Mallorca in the promotion playoffs (2–1 on aggregate, with striker Carlos, who would feature prominently for the club in the following years, scoring one of the goals), and remained in that level for 13 consecutive seasons – in 1990–91 it finished sixth, qualifying for the first time for Europe, and being knocked out in the first round by Genoa C.F.C. of Italy (2–3). Oviedo bounced back from that defeat immediately, with a 2–1 win at the Camp Nou over Barcelona.After that successful year, there were more brilliant seasons and others where relegation was narrowly dodged (in 1998 Real Oviedo succeeded in a relegation playoff to stay up after beating UD Las Palmas). In a nutshell, the &quot;Carbayones&quot; had an outstanding run in La Liga during the 1990s with a team which lined up top international players. In 1992 Real Oviedo as well as most Spanish football clubs was forced to become public limited sports company. The initial capital stock for Real Oviedo amounted to €3.6 million.

On 4 October 1995, Real Oviedo played its 1,000th game in La Liga.

In 2000, the new &quot;Carlos Tartiere Stadium&quot; with 30,500 seats became Real Oviedo&#x27;s new ground. It was officially opened on 20 September 2000 with a match between Real Oviedo and Partizan Belgrade, where Real Oviedo lost 0–2 to the Serbian side. Three days before, Real Oviedo and UD Las Palmas had got a 2–2 draw on the first fixture in the 2000–01 season.

After being relegated two consecutive times, Real Oviedo suffered severe economic troubles, which, when coupled with a profound lack of institutional support from the city&#x27;s government, resulted in the team&#x27;s inability to pay its players. The club was then forced to drop all the way to the fourth division of Spanish football, for the 2003–04 season; at this point the team nearly folded but eventually recovered and regrouped, returning to level three in the following campaign.

Oviedo lasted two further campaigns before dropping down a level again. In another playoff against a Mallorca team – this time the reserves, the club returned again to the third division, after a penalty shootout; however, its survival remained at risk in the following years, due to continuing financial difficulties.

The financial dire straits continued into the 2012–13 season, when Oviedo called on supporters to buy shares in the club. A few footballers, notably Santi Cazorla, Juan Mata, Michu and Adrián who all started their careers there, offered their financial support in an attempt to save the club from bankruptcy – the club had until 17 November to raise €2 million in order to prevent closure.

On 17 November 2012, Carlos Slim, at the time the richest person in the world, invested $2.5 million in the club, therefore gaining a controlling stake.

On 31 May 2015, Oviedo confirmed their return to the Spanish Segunda División after a thirteen-year absence with a 2–1 aggregate victory over Cádiz in the 2015 Segunda División B play-offs. In the 2023–24 Segunda División, Oviedo finished sixth, earning a spot in the promotion play-offs, where they reached the final, winning the first leg 1–0, but lost 2–1 on aggregate to Espanyol.

==Real Oviedo B==

The reserve team, which plays since 2022 in the fourth level (Segunda Federación), was formerly named &quot;Vetusta&quot;. Vetusta was also the original name of the team, before the Royal Spanish Football Federation decree which banned unique reserve club names in the early 1990s.

==Real Oviedo (women)==

On 28 August 2017, women&#x27;s club Oviedo Moderno CF signed an agreement with Real Oviedo for using their name and their blue and white colors, instead of their classic black and green, since the 2017–18 season, with the aim to be completely integrated into the structure of the club for the 2018–19 season onwards. The club formerly used the blue and white colors for the 2016–17 promotion play-offs.

Oviedo currently plays in Segunda Federación, the Spanish third tier.

<text>Route 18 is a state highway in the central part of the US state of New Jersey. It begins at an intersection with Route 138 in Wall Township, Monmouth County, and ends at Interstate 287 (I-287) in Piscataway, Middlesex County. Route 18 is a major route through Central New Jersey that connects the Jersey Shore to the Raritan Valley region, connecting the seats of Monmouth County (Freehold) and Middlesex County (New Brunswick) respectively. The route runs through Ocean Township, Marlboro, East Brunswick, and is the main thoroughfare for Rutgers University. Much of the route is a freeway (including the entire portion in Monmouth County and much of the northern end through New Brunswick and Piscataway). The remainder of the route is an arterial road with traffic lights in the East Brunswick and Old Bridge areas, and a boulevard in the remainder of Piscataway. Route 18 was designated in 1939 as a proposed freeway from Old Bridge to Eatontown. The section west of Old Bridge was formerly designated as part Route S28, a prefixed spur of State Highway Route 28 from Middlesex to Matawan. The designation, assigned in the 1927 renumbering, remained until a second renumbering in 1953. At that point, Route S28 was redesignated as Route 18, though the section from Old Bridge to Matawan was signed as TEMP 18, as this section would be decommissioned when the Route 18 freeway was built.

The route originally ended at Route 27 at the border between Highland Park and New Brunswick, but was extended northward to then-County Route 514 Spur (CR 514 Spur), now CR 622, in 1983. The freeway through New Brunswick was constructed during the 1980s over the Delaware and Raritan Canal. Route 18 was further extended to Hoes Lane in Piscataway in 2004 and presently ends at I-287 in Piscataway. The route south of exit 6A in Wall Township was also originally intended to extend to the Brielle Circle and terminate at Route 34, Route 35, and Route 70 but there are no plans to do so currently.

==Route description==

===Monmouth County===
Route 18 begins at a partial-cloverleaf interchange with Route 138 in Wall Township. At the southern end of the interchange, the right-of-way and unused pavement for the southern extension is visible along with the former on-ramp from Route 138 to Route 18 northbound. The highway heads northward as a four-lane freeway, crossing under Route 138. Route 18 intersects Route 138 westbound and Monmouth Boulevard, a local road in New Bedford. Route 18 then crosses under Monmouth Boulevard and Belmar Boulevard (CR 18) in the community of Glendola. The route continues through Glendola, and intersects Brighton Avenue (exits 7A and 7B southbound). The freeway continues south of the Shark River Golf Course, through Neptune, paralleling Brighton Avenue, and intersects Route 33 and West Sylvania Avenue (CR 17) at exit 8. Although signed as exit 8 northbound, the interchange is divided into exits 8A and 8B heading southbound. The roadway crosses into Ocean Township and crosses under West Bangs Avenue (CR 17). In Ocean Township, there are exits for Route 66 and Asbury Avenue, Deal Road, and West Park Avenue. Farther north, the highway enters Eatontown.
A large interchange near the Naval Weapons Station Earle serves Industrial Way West, Wyckoff Road (CR 547), Route 36, Hope Road (CR 51), the Garden State Parkway, the Tinton Falls interchange (exit 105), and Wayside Road (CR 38). After passing over the Southern Secondary railroad line operated by the Delaware and Raritan River Railroad, the route continues northwestward into Colts Neck. The freeway continues to the northwest through wooded land for several miles, crossing over Normandy Road and to the south of the Pebble Creek Golf Club. Exits along this stretch include Route 34, Colts Neck Road (CR 537), Route 79, CR 520, and Tennent Road (CR 3), which connects to Freehold Borough and Marlboro Township.

=== Middlesex County ===

After entering Middlesex County, Route 18 continues north as a freeway, entering Old Bridge. After interchanging with US 9 (exit 30), the freeway ends, and the route becomes a four-lane expressway, and then an arterial road through a mostly wooded commercial stretch of Old Bridge. The route crosses several roads in this area. It then passes under Old Bridge-Matawan Road (CR 516 and CR 527), but has no northbound interchange to connect with them; motorists have to travel through a residential area to access these roads. On the southbound side, motorists can use a cloverleaf or Englishtown Road. Route 18 then crosses the South River into East Brunswick and passes over Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; (CSAO) Amboy Secondary before interchanging with Main Street (CR 615), which also connects to CR 527.

Route 18 then continues through the heavily developed commercial corridor of East Brunswick, intersecting with Rues Lane (CR 617) and passing near Brunswick Square Mall. After the interchanges with Cranbury Road (CR 535) and Milltown Road (CR 606), Route 18 passes over CSAO&#x27;s Bonhamtown Industrial Track line and intersects West Ferris Street, West Prospect Street, Tices Lane, and then meets the intersection with (Old Bridge Turnpike (CR 527) at Edgeboro Road. Following an intersection with Eggers Street, Route 18 becomes a six-lane expressway and crosses over the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) at exit 9. The road intersects with Tower Center Boulevard before crossing into New Brunswick at Lawrence Brook.
The interchange with US 1 is followed by an intersection at Paulus Boulevard before becoming a six-lane freeway and separating into a local–express configuration and paralleling the Raritan River, passing the former New Brunswick city docks. Local exits include George Street (Route 172), the Rutgers University boathouse and Elmer B. Boyd Park, Paul Robeson Boulevard (formerly Commercial Avenue), New Street, and Albany Street (Route 27), after which the express and local lanes merge back together and cross under the Raritan River Bridge carrying Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor. The freeway continues with exits for George Street, Rutgers (for access to the College Avenue Campus) and Easton Avenue before exiting New Brunswick on the John A. Lynch Sr. Memorial Bridge over the Raritan River.
The highway then intersects River Road (CR 622), Campus Road (Rutgers&#x27; Busch Campus and stadium), Metlars Lane (Rutgers&#x27; Livingston Campus and Rutgers Athletic Center), where the route curves to the west and becomes Hoes Lane. As Hoes Lane, Route 18 becomes a four-lane arterial road and passes Resurrection Cemetery of the Diocese of Metuchen, as well as the post office and township hall of Piscataway, before reaching an intersection with Centennial Avenue. Route 18 turns on Centennial Avenue and continues for about to a traffic signal for Possumtown Road. From this intersection, Route 18 is considered to exist both on Centennial Avenue and Possumtown Road, and ends in each case at the respective entrance ramps for Interstate 287.

==History and future==

=== Designation and southern freeway construction ===
Route 18 partly follows the course of the Middlesex and Matawan Turnpike (commonly called the Old Bridge Turnpike), legislated in 1863 to run from the south branch of the Raritan River to Matawan. The alignment of Route 18 through Middlesex County from Middlesex to Highland Park was first designated in the 1927 designing of a new highway system as State Highway Route S-29, a prefixed spur of New Jersey Route 29 (U.S. Route 22) through Middlesex County. The route followed Washington Avenue in Middlesex and the River Road in Piscataway until terminating at State Highway Route 27 near the Albany Street Bridge in Highland Park. By the time of the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the route was re-designated as State Highway Route S-28. This route was a prefixed spur of State Highway Route 28 in Middlesex, following Raritan Avenue and River Road through Piscataway and Highland Park, joining State Highway Route 27 on a concurrency into New Brunswick, and onto George Street in New Brunswick southward. After New Brunswick, Route S-28 continued southward through East Brunswick, Old Bridge and Browntown before terminating at State Highway Route 4 (US 9) in Matawan.

The route was originally designated as an east–west highway, whereas it is now signed north–south. Although Route S-28 was used for the alignment for nearly three decades, the second state highway renumbering in 1953 eliminated the designation, and Route 18 was designated in place.
During the 1950s, as the New Jersey State Highway Department was drawing out plans for an extensive freeway system, freeways were proposed for Route 18 and nearby Route 35. Route 18&#x27;s freeway was to begin in Eatontown and head westward to e along the former alignment of State Highway Route 18 prior to the 1953 renumbering, while Route 35 was to be rerouted from its surface alignment and head northward from Seaside Heights to Long Branch on a new freeway. Both plans were endorsed by the Tri-State Transportation Committee in 1962, and the acquisition for the right-of-ways began almost immediately. The freeways combined were to cost $50 million (1962 USD) and be in total. Both freeways were designed to handle 30,000–50,000 vehicles daily.

The freeway was completed between Route 138 and Route 33 in 1967 and Route 33 and Deal Road in 1969. Following this, the Route 35 freeway was cancelled and it became the part of Route 18 south of Eatontown. In 1974, Route 18 was completed between just south of Normandy Road in Colts Neck and US 9. A small portion of the freeway between Obre Road and Normandy Road in Colts Neck was finished in 1977. Route 18 was built between Wayside Road and Obre Road in 1978. The final portion of the Route 18 between Deal Road and Wayside Road was finished in 1988.

=== Freeway around New Brunswick ===

The proposals for a freeway bypassing New Brunswick began in 1962, when the New Jersey State Highway Department made plans to construct a new freeway from US 1 through New Brunswick to US 22 in Bound Brook. The price tag for construction was $44 million (about $ in dollars) and was to head for , accessing the Somerset Freeway, I-287 and Route 28 before terminating at US 22. The extension to Bound Brook, however, was canceled in the 1970s because of tight funding.

Construction of a new four-lane bridge across the Raritan River (now the John A. Lynch Memorial Bridge) began in the 1960s, but in 1970, when the environment impact laws came out, construction froze with only three massive piers standing out of the river. Outside of the bridge, there was significant controversy over the abandoned Delaware and Raritan Canal heading through New Brunswick. The new freeway was to supplant the former canal and its thirteenth lock in New Brunswick, abandoned in 1932. The environmentalists and the historic preservationists opposed the freeway extension because of the fears of losing the canal, while companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson supported the new highway for redeveloping New Brunswick.

In 1977, the newly formed New Jersey Department of Transportation received a federal grant to construct the Route 18 from New Street in New Brunswick, across the Raritan and terminating at CR 514 Spur in Piscataway. This portion was completed in 1983 at a cost of $40 million (about $ in dollars), with a finished bridge and freeway through New Brunswick.

In 2005, construction began on a revamped Route 18 freeway through New Brunswick. The rebuild includes local and express lanes from George Street (Route 172) to the interchange with Albany Street (Route 27). Conti Enterprises was hired for the project, which was announced complete in August 2009 at a ceremony by governor Jon Corzine and Stephen Dilts, the commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Transportation. During the construction, the New Street interchange and bridge were demolished and replaced. The area of the Paulus Boulevard intersection was upgraded for accessibility, and a bus stop was installed, but the roadway southbound is still three lanes at the traffic light. In adjacent Elmer Boyd Park a new entranceway and amphitheatre were added.

=== Extension through Piscataway and to Brielle ===
====Piscataway====
In 2001, the New Jersey Department of Transportation approved construction of extending the Route 18 Freeway northward from River Road (CR 622, former CR 514 Spur) in Piscataway to a new arterial on the existing Hoes Lane in the Rutgers University campuses. Construction of this segment, designated as Section 2A, built a partial cloverleaf interchange to River Road (CR 622), a trumpet interchange to Frelinghuysen Avenue (the access to Busch Campus) and a partial cloverleaf interchange to Metlars Lane (CR 609) and Davidson Road. The state acquired 12 homes along the existing Metlars Lane and of land from Rutgers to build the extension. The project cost the state $85 million (2004 USD).

The New Jersey Department of Transportation planned the extension to I-287 in Piscataway, by upgrading Hoes Lane&#x27;s arterial boulevard and its 20 intersections to standards, eliminating and upgrading several traffic lights. On February 15, 2012, the New Jersey Department of Transportation broke ground on the project, which was completed in mid-2016. Following the completion of the project, Route 18 turns off Hoes Lane at Centennial Avenue, follows Centennial Avenue to Possumtown Road, and terminates at I-287 exit 8.
====Brielle====
There has been scrutiny about the stub end at Exit 6A for Route 138 that was to be a part of an extension of the freeway for its final five miles (8 km) from Route 138 to the Brielle Circle. Some of the right-of-way that was acquired in the 1960s for the Route 35 freeway were transformed into a multi-use trail for bicycles and other vehicles to link the Wall Township Municipal Complex to the existing Edgar Felix Bikeway that runs from Manasquan to Allaire State Park. In 2001, the Brielle Circle was replaced with a new four-approach interchange between Route 35, Route 34 and Route 70, but the project included no hint of the Route 18 Extension. NJDOT is in planning to create a Park &amp; Ride at the southern terminus of the Route 18 freeway. It will be placed along the four lane right of way just south of Route 138. Residents are in opposition to this proposal for fear of loitering and vandalism that may accompany the parking lot.

===New exit ramp in Old Bridge Township===
Construction was slated for the interchange with County Routes 516 and 527 in Old Bridge as there is no way to access either of them without driving through a residential area off Route 18. The traffic flow along CR 516 (Old Bridge into Matawan) and 527 (Old Bridge into Englishtown/Manalapan) has increased significantly in the past ten years which called for the exit ramp off Route 18. The Old Bridge improvements include adding inside shoulders and widening County Routes 516 and 527. A signalized ramp is to be added for access to County Routes 516 and 527. Subsequently, CR 516&#x27;s intersection with Old Matawan Road is to be relocated. The project would cost over $28 million and was slated to begin in 2009 and to end in 2010. As of the end of 2009 the large project was put on hold because of the lack of funds and the economic situation. Demolition was completed in 2009 on Marlboro Road, taking down several residential houses and along Old Matawan Road and CR 516 and taking down an old gas station in preparing for the project. There is no new date released by the New Jersey Department of Transportation in when construction will begin.&lt;ref name=&quot;cr516/527&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The CR 516 bridge over Route 18 had since been replaced in 2016 with no interchange improvements.

==Major intersections==
Exit numbers and mileposts are based on the originally planned southern terminus of Route 18 at Route 34, Route 35, and Route 70 at the former Brielle Circle that includes the unbuilt section from Brielle to Route 138.

<text>Route 28 is a state highway in the central part of New Jersey, United States that is long. Its western terminus is at U.S. Route 22 (US 22) in Bridgewater Township, Somerset County, while its eastern terminus is at Route 27 in Elizabeth, Union County. From its western terminus, Route 28 heads east through Raritan, intersecting County Route 567 (CR 567) and then US 202 and US 206 at the Somerville Circle before heading through the central part of Somerville. Past Somerville, the route has interchanges with Interstate 287 (I-287) in Bridgewater Township before intersecting many 500-series county roads including CR 525 and CR 527 in Bound Brook, CR 529 in Dunellen, Middlesex County, CR 531 in Plainfield, Union County, and CR 509 in Westfield. Route 28 continues east, intersecting Route 59 and the Garden State Parkway in Cranford before heading to Elizabeth, where it crosses Route 439 before ending at Route 27. Route 28 is a two- to four-lane road its entire length that passes through suburban areas and runs within a close distance of New Jersey Transit’s Raritan Valley Line for much of its length.

Prior to 1927, Route 28 was known as Route 9, which was designated in 1917 to run from Phillipsburg east to Elizabeth. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, US 22 was designated along with Route 28. In 1927, most of pre-1927 Route 9 became Route 28, with the exception of the route through Elizabeth, which became Route 27-28 Link as Route 28 followed present-day Route 439 to the Goethals Bridge. Also legislated at this time was a spur of Route 28 called Route S28, which became Route 18 in 1953. By 1941, US 22 was moved off the Route 28 alignment in Phillipsburg, and US 22 Alternate (US 22 Alt., now Route 122) took its place, as well as east of Bridgewater Township, where it was realigned to follow Route 28-29 Link and Route 29 to Newark. In 1953, the western terminus of Route 28 was moved to the intersection of the current CR 614 and Route 22, in Branchburg Township. Sometime after 1990 it was moved east to its current location to allow for more local control of speed limits along Easton Turnpike, and the de-designated stretch was designated CR 614. A portion of the route in Elizabeth was realigned to replace Route 27-28 Link, with the former route becoming Route 439.

==Route description==

===Somerset County===

Route 28 begins at an interchange with US 22 in Bridgewater Township, Somerset County, heading to the southeast on Easton Turnpike, a two-lane undivided road. Past this interchange, Easton Turnpike continues to the northwest as CR 614. The route heads through predominantly residential areas, eventually forming the border between Raritan to the southwest and Bridgewater Township to the northeast. It intersects the northern terminus of CR 567 (First Avenue) before heading into business areas, where it comes to the modified Somerville Circle, where Route 28 intersects US 202 and US 206. This traffic circle has been modified to allow US 202 to pass over and interchange with the circle, while US 206 and Route 28 continue through the circle. Past the Somerville Circle, Route 28 becomes a road named West End Avenue that intersects CR 644 (Frelinghuysen Avenue) just before entering Somerville. Here, the route passes residences and crosses CR 643 (Mountain Avenue) before coming to an intersection with CR 626 (Somerset Street). At this intersection, Route 28 bears to the left and heads east on West Main Street, which proceeds through the business district of downtown Somerville. The route becomes East Main Street upon crossing Bridge Street.
Upon leaving the downtown area, the route turns north onto Gaston Avenue and heads into residential areas again, as CR 612 continues east on Main Street. At the intersection with Union Avenue, Route 28 turns to the east to follow that road. The route continues past residential neighborhoods containing some businesses, briefly forming the border between Bridgewater Township to the north and Somerville to the south before fully entering Bridgewater Township. It intersects CR 633 (Finderne Avenue) before crossing Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Middle Brook Industrial Track line and CR 675 (Chimney Rock Road), where Route 28 widens into a four-lane divided highway that heads through industrial and commercial areas. The road makes a junction with CR 685 (Promenade Boulevard) before coming to an interchange with I-287. Past this interchange, the route continues into Bound Brook as a two-lane undivided road and heads through business areas. In Bound Brook, Route 28 intersects the southern terminus of CR 525 (Thompson Avenue) and CR 635 (Vosseller Avenue) before heading into more residential surroundings and crossing CR 527 (Mountain Avenue).

===Middlesex and Union counties===

Upon crossing Green Brook, Route 28 enters Middlesex in Middlesex County, where it becomes a four-lane undivided road that continues northeast through residential neighborhoods, intersecting CR 622 (Raritan Avenue). The route heads into a mix of residences and businesses, turning more to the northeast and becoming Bound Brook Avenue at the intersection with Marlborough Avenue. It intersects CR 607 (Lincoln Avenue), where Route 28 narrows to two lanes, and Warrenville Road before crossing into Dunellen. Here, Route 28 heads east through residential and commercial areas before turning northeast to closely parallel NJ Transit’s Raritan Valley Line (which runs to the south of the route) as North Avenue. The route crosses CR 529 (Washington Avenue) in the downtown area of Dunellen.

Route 28 crosses into Plainfield, Union County, where it becomes county-maintained Front Street, resuming northeast through residential and industrial areas before entering a more residential environment. The road encounters a mix of residences and businesses before intersecting Plainfield Avenue, where CR 620 continues northeast on West Front Street and Route 28 turns to the southeast onto Plainfield Avenue. The route crosses the Raritan Valley Line before turning northeast on a one-way pair, with eastbound Route 28 along Fifth Street and westbound Route 28 along Fourth Street. CR 603 continues southeast on Plainfield Avenue from this point. The one-way pair, which has two lanes in each direction, passes residences before crossing CR 531 (Park Avenue) in the commercial downtown area of Plainfield, coinciding with the directional change of Fourth Street and Fifth Street from west to east. At the intersection with Roosevelt Avenue, Route 28 becomes two-way East Fifth Street, and the name becomes South Avenue at the intersection with Richmond Street. The route passes through urban residential and industrial areas, with the Raritan Valley Line located a short distance to the northwest. The road extends through more suburban commercial areas before crossing CR 611 (Terrill Road), where Route 28 enters Fanwood. A short distance later, at the second intersection with Old South Avenue, the route becomes state-maintained again and continues past businesses, intersecting CR 655 (Martine Avenue) before it heads into residential neighborhoods and meets CR 601 (Laurel Place).
Upon crossing CR 606 (Hetfield Avenue), Route 28 turns slightly more east and enters Scotch Plains, where it passes homes to the south and businesses to the north. It continues into Westfield, where it passes more residences and businesses. The road intersects CR 648 (Broad Street) before coming to a roundabout. Here, CR 610 continues east on South Avenue, and Route 28 heads north as a four-lane divided highway running concurrently with CR 610 that passes under the Raritan Valley Line. After crossing under the railroad line, the road intersects North Avenue, which heads west as CR 610 and east as Route 28. Meanwhile, CR 509 continues north on East Broad Street from this intersection. Route 28 continues east as a four-lane undivided road through the downtown area of Westfield, crossing CR 613 (Central Avenue). The route passes residences to the north and businesses to the south, with the Raritan Valley Line located a short distance to the south, becoming a two-lane road before entering Garwood. In Garwood, the road heads through more commercial areas before intersecting Route 59 (Lincoln Avenue) on the border of Cranford. Route 59 is a short route that provides access to CR 610, passing under the Raritan Valley Line. In Cranford, Route 28 passes homes before entering the commercial downtown area, where it intersects CR 615 (Springfield Avenue/Centennial Avenue). From here, the road stretches through residential and commercial areas before widening into a four-lane divided highway and meeting the Garden State Parkway.

Past this interchange, Route 28 becomes West Westfield Avenue and crosses into Roselle Park, where it continues through a mix of residences and commercial establishments. It crosses over the Raritan Valley Line and Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Lehigh Line before it intersects with C 617 (Faitoute Avenue/Gordon Street) and heads into the downtown area of Roselle Park. Here, the road comes to junctions with CR 619 (Locust Street) and CR 627 (Chestnut Street) before heading into residential areas. The route intersects CR 616 (Linden Road), forming a brief concurrency with that route until the county route turns north onto Galloping Hill Road. At this point, Route 28 enters Elizabeth, where it continues through more urbanized residential areas before crossing Route 439 (Elmora Avenue). After the intersection with Route 439, the route continues past urban residences and business, narrowing into a two-lane undivided road at the intersection with CR 618 (Magie Avenue). A short distance later, Route 28 ends at an intersection with the southbound direction of Route 27, which turns from Westfield Avenue to head south on Chilton Street.

== History ==
Route 28 follows the course of the Tuckaraming Trail, and old Lenape Trail that later became the Old York Road, the main road from New York City to Philadelphia. In 1917, Route 9 was designated by the state of New Jersey to run from Phillipsburg east to Elizabeth, passing through Clinton, Somerville, Plainfield, and Westfield. With the establishment of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, US 22 was concurrently designated along the entire length of Route 9. A year later, in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 28 was legislated to run from Phillipsburg east to the Goethals Bridge, replacing pre-1927 Route 9 between Phillipsburg and present-day Route 439 in Elizabeth, and following current Route 439 toward the Goethals Bridge. Meanwhile, the former alignment of pre-1927 Route 9 east became Route 27-28 Link, as it provided a connection between Route 27 and Route 28. A spur of Route 28, named Route S28, was also legislated in the 1927 renumbering and was to run from Route 28 in Middlesex southeast to Route 4 (now Route 79) in Matawan. What was built of this route became Route 18 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. By 1941, US 22 was eventually moved from Route 28 to follow Route 28-29 Link and Route 29 between the Somerville area and Newark. Also, US 22 was realigned to its current alignment along Route 24 and Route 24-28 Link in Phillipsburg, with the alignment along Route 28 becoming US 22 Alt. (now Route 122). In the 1953 renumbering of state highways, which eliminated long concurrencies between U.S. and state highways, the western terminus of Route 28 was placed at the intersection of US 22 and Easton Turnpike in Branchburg Township, with the designation west of there dropped in favor of US 22 and US 22 Alt. In addition, Route 28 was moved to its current alignment in Elizabeth, replacing Route 27-28 Link; Route 439 was designated along the former alignment of Route 28 that ran to the Goethals Bridge.

Due in general to farmland development and safety concerns, the western terminus of Route 28 was later adjusted to the second Easton Turnpike interchange with US 22 in Bridgewater Township, creating CR 614. This allowed for local control of speed limits in the now congested stretch of Easton Turnpike between its two intersections with US 22.

<text>Dame Beryl Margaret Bainbridge (21 November 1932 – 2 July 2010) was an English writer. She was primarily known for her works of psychological fiction, often macabre tales set among the English working class. She won the Whitbread Awards prize for best novel in 1977 and 1996, and was nominated five times for the Booker Prize. She was described in 2007 as a national treasure. In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; named Bainbridge on their list of the &quot;50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Beryl Margaret Bainbridge was born in Liverpool&#x27;s Allerton suburb on 21 November 1932, the daughter of Winifred Baines and Richard Bainbridge. She grew up in the nearby town of Formby. Although she often gave her date of birth as 21 November 1934, she was born in 1932 and her birth was registered in the first quarter of 1933. When German former prisoner of war Harry Arno Franz wrote to her in November 1947, he mentioned her 15th birthday.

Bainbridge enjoyed writing, and by the age of 10 she was keeping a diary. She had elocution lessons and, when she was 11, appeared on the &quot;Northern Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; radio show, alongside Billie Whitelaw and Judith Chalmers. She was expelled from Merchant Taylors&#x27; Girls&#x27; School in Great Crosby when she was caught with a &quot;dirty rhyme&quot; (as she later described it) written by someone else in her gymslip pocket. She then went on to study at Cone-Ripman School in Tring (now the Tring Park School for the Performing Arts), where she found she was good at history, English, and art. The summer she left school, she fell in love with former German prisoner of war Harry Arno Franz who was waiting to be repatriated. For the next six years, the couple corresponded and tried to get permission for him to return to Britain so that they could marry, but permission was denied and the relationship ended in 1953.

===Subsequent years===
In the following year (1954), Bainbridge married artist Austin Davies. In 1958, she attempted suicide by putting her head in a gas oven. The two divorced soon after, leaving Bainbridge a single mother of two children. Bainbridge spent her early years working as an actress, and she appeared in one 1961 episode of the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; playing an anti-nuclear protester. She later had a third child by Alan Sharp, the actress Rudi Davies (born 1965). Sharp, a Scotsman, was at the start of his career as novelist and screenwriter; Bainbridge would later let it be thought that he was her second husband; in truth, they never married but the relationship encouraged her on her way to fiction.

To help fill her time, Bainbridge began to write, primarily based on incidents from her childhood. Her first novel, &quot;Harriet Said...&quot;, was rejected by several publishers, one of whom found the central characters &quot;repulsive almost beyond belief&quot;. It was eventually published in 1972, four years after her third novel (&quot;Another Part of the Wood&quot;). Her second and third novels were published (1967/68) and were received well by critics although they failed to earn much money. She wrote and published seven more novels during the 1970s, of which the fifth, &quot;Injury Time&quot;, was awarded the Whitbread prize for best novel in 1977.

In the late 1970s, she wrote a screenplay based on her novel &quot;Sweet William&quot;. The resulting film, starring Sam Waterston, was released in 1980.

From 1980 onwards, eight more novels appeared. The 1989 novel, &quot;An Awfully Big Adventure&quot;, was adapted into a film in 1995, starring Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant.

In the 1990s, Bainbridge turned to historical fiction. These novels continued to be popular with critics, but this time, were also commercially successful. Among her historical fiction novels are &quot;Every Man for Himself&quot;, about the 1912 Titanic disaster, for which Bainbridge won the 1996 Whitbread Awards prize for best novel, and &quot;Master Georgie&quot;, set during the Crimean War, for which she won the 1998 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. Her final novel, &quot;According to Queeney&quot;, is a fictionalized account of the last years of the life of Samuel Johnson as seen through the eyes of Queeney Thrale, eldest daughter of Henry and Hester Thrale. &quot;The Observer&quot; referred to it as a &quot;...highly intelligent, sophisticated and entertaining novel&quot;.

From the 1990s, Bainbridge also served as a theatre critic for the monthly magazine &quot;The Oldie&quot;. Her reviews rarely contained negative content, and were usually published after the play had closed. A collection of reviews 1992-2002 were published in the book &quot;Front Row: Evenings at the Theatre&quot;. The introduction described her theatrical experience, from winning a talent competition to assistant stage manager in Liverpool to occasional acting roles.

===Final years===
In 2003, Bainbridge&#x27;s grandson Charlie Russell began filming a documentary, &quot;Beryl&#x27;s Last Year&quot;, about her life. The documentary detailed her upbringing and her attempts to write a novel, &quot;Dear Brutus&quot; (which later became &quot;The Girl in the Polka Dot Dress&quot;). It was broadcast in the United Kingdom on 2 June 2007 on BBC Four.

In 2009, Bainbridge donated the short story &quot;Goodnight Children, Everywhere&quot; to Oxfam&#x27;s Ox-Tales project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Her story was published in the &quot;Air&quot; collection. Bainbridge was the patron of the People&#x27;s Book Prize.

Bainbridge was still working on &quot;The Girl in the Polka Dot Dress&quot; at the time of her death. The novel, which was based on a real-life journey Bainbridge made across America in 1968, is about the mystery girl reputed to have been involved in the assassination of Robert Kennedy. The novel, which was published in May 2011 by Little, Brown, was edited for publication by Brendan King, whose biography &quot;Beryl Bainbridge: Love by All Sorts of Means&quot; was published in September 2016.

==Death==

Bainbridge had been a heavy smoker for much of her life. Her cancer returned and she died on 2 July 2010, aged 77, in a London hospital. Confusion over her birth year resulted in some reports giving her age at death as 75. She is buried in Highgate Cemetery.

==Honours and awards==
In 2000, Bainbridge was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE). In June 2001, she was awarded an honorary degree by the Open University as Doctor of the University. In 2003, she was awarded the David Cohen Prize for Literature together with Thom Gunn. In 2005, the British Library acquired many of Bainbridge&#x27;s private letters and diaries. 

Following Bainbridge&#x27;s death in 2010, the Man Booker Prize set up a &quot;Best of Beryl&quot; prize, the nominees being her books that had previously been shortlisted: &quot;The Dressmaker&quot;, &quot;The Bottle Factory Outing&quot;, &quot;An Awfully Big Adventure&quot;, &quot;Every Man for Himself&quot;, and &quot;Master Georgie&quot;; by a public vote, &quot;Master Georgie&quot; was chosen as the winner. In 2011, Bainbridge was posthumously awarded a special honour by the Booker Prize committee.

Mark Knopfler included a song titled &quot;Beryl&quot; dedicated to her and her posthumous award on his 2015 album &quot;Tracker&quot;. In 2016, a Blue Plaque was unveiled at the house she resided in while growing up in Formby.

<doc id="80814" wikidata="Q3391255" url="?curid=80814" title="Planar (computer graphics)">
<text>In computer graphics, planar is the method of arranging pixel data into several &quot;bitplanes&quot; of RAM. Each bit in a bitplane is related to one pixel on the screen. Unlike packed, high color, or true color graphics, the whole dataset for an individual pixel is not in one specific location in RAM, but spread across the bitplanes that make up the display. Planar arrangement determines how pixel data is laid out in memory, not how the data for a pixel is interpreted; pixel data in a planar arrangement could encode either indexed or direct color.

This scheme originated in the early days of computer graphics. The memory chips of this era can not supply data fast enough on their own to generate a picture on a TV screen or monitor from a large framebuffer. By splitting the data up into multiple planes, each plane can be stored on a separate memory chip. These chips can then be read in parallel at a slower rate, allowing graphical display on modest hardware, like game consoles of the third and fourth generations and home computers of the 80s. The EGA video adapter on early IBM PC computers uses planar arrangement in color graphical modes for this reason. The later VGA includes one non-planar mode which sacrifices memory efficiency for more convenient access.

== Hardware with planar graphics ==

Game consoles with a planar display organization include Sega´s Master System and Game Gear, Nintendo´s NES / SNES, and the PC Engine. 

The Slovak PP 01 includes a 24KB plane-based 8-colour graphics mode with a resolution of 256x256 pixels. The 16-bit Atari ST and Amiga platforms from the 80s and 90s were exclusively based on a planar graphics configuration alongside a powerful blitter. Amiga´s OCS graphics chipset works with 5 bitplanes which allows 2^5=32 colors per pixel, while later models with the AGA chipset can handle eight bitplanes (2^8=256 colors).

For the Sinclair (Amstrad) ZX Spectrum computer family and compatible systems, a graphics expansion named HGFX was developed in 2019. In 2022 it was implemented in FPGA-based hardware. The HGFX enables a memory organization that is compatible with the original ZX Spectrum system while taking up only 6144 bytes of the original video RAM. In addition, it provides two video-buffers, 256 indexed colours, a truecolour palette, and an HDMI output. The HGFX works with eight bitplanes. Currently it is implemented as part of the eLeMeNt ZX computer. 

== Examples ==
On a chunky display with 4-bits-per-pixel and a RGBI palette, each byte represents two pixels, with 16 different colors available for each pixel. Four consecutive pixels are stored in two consecutive bytes as follows:

Whereas a planar scheme could use 2 bitplanes, providing for a 4 color display. Eight pixels would be stored as 2 bytes non-contiguously in memory:

In the planar example, 2 bytes represent 8 pixels with 4 available colors, where the packed pixel example uses 2 bytes to represent fewer pixels but with more colors. Adding planes will increase the number of colors available at the cost of requiring more memory. For example, using 4 planes makes 24=16 colors available, but it would then take 4 bytes to represent 8 pixels (making it equivalent in terms of memory usage and available colors to the packed arrangement example).

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Planar arrangements offer space and time efficiencies over packed arrangements at bit depths that are not powers of 2. As an example, consider 3 , allowing 8 colors. With planar arrangements, this simply requires 3 planes. With packed arrangements, supporting exactly 3 bpp would require either allowing pixels to cross byte boundaries (incurring time costs due to complications with addressing and unpacking pixels) or padding (incurring space costs, as each byte would store 2 pixels and have 2 unused bits); historically, this is one reason (though not necessarily the main one) packed pixels used bit depths that fit evenly into bytes.

Planar arrangements allow for faster bit depth switching: planes are added or discarded and (if colors are indexed) the palette is extended or truncated. Consequently, support for higher bit depths can be added with little to no impact on older software. Ease of bit depth switching also allow elements with different bit depths to be easily used together. 

A disadvantage of planar arrangements is that more RAM address cycles are needed for scrolling and animations.

<doc id="80815" wikidata="Q819117" url="?curid=80815" title="Lincoln Highway">
<text>The Lincoln Highway is one of the first transcontinental highways in the United States and one of the first highways designed expressly for automobiles. Conceived in 1912 by Indiana entrepreneur Carl G. Fisher, and formally dedicated October 31, 1913, the Lincoln Highway runs coast-to-coast from Times Square in New York City west to Lincoln Park in San Francisco. The full route originally ran through 13 states: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, and California. In 1915, the &quot;Colorado Loop&quot; was removed, and in 1928, a realignment routed the Lincoln Highway through the northern tip of West Virginia. Thus, there are 14 states, 128 counties, and more than 700 cities, towns, and villages through which the highway passed at some time in its history.

The first officially recorded length of the entire Lincoln Highway in 1913 was . Over the years, the road was improved and numerous realignments were made, and by 1924 the highway had been shortened to . Counting the original route and all of the subsequent realignments, there has been a grand total of .

The Lincoln Highway was gradually replaced with numbered designations after the establishment of the U.S. Numbered Highway System in 1926, with most of the route becoming U.S. Route 30 from Pennsylvania to Wyoming. After the Interstate Highway System was formed in the 1950s, the former alignments of the Lincoln Highway were largely superseded by Interstate 80 as the primary coast-to-coast route from the New York City area to San Francisco.

&quot;Note: A fully interactive free online map of the entire Lincoln Highway and all of its re-alignments, markers, monuments and points of interest can be viewed at the Lincoln Highway Association Official Map website. Google Maps prominently labels the 1928–1930 route.&quot;

Most of U.S. Route 30 from Philadelphia to western Wyoming, portions of Interstate 80 in the western United States, most of U.S. Route 50 in Nevada and California, and most of old decommissioned U.S. Route 40 in California are alignments of the Lincoln Highway. The final (1928–1930) alignment of the Lincoln Highway corresponds &quot;roughly&quot; to the following roads:
* 42nd Street from the intersection of Broadway at Times Square in New York City westward 6 blocks to the Hudson River. The Lincoln Highway Eastern Terminus is marked by a metal street sign that says simply “Lincoln Highway” mounted on the street lamp pole at the northeast corner of 42nd Street and Broadway.
* Holland Tunnel from New York City westward under the Hudson River to Jersey City, New Jersey.&quot;(Note: The Lincoln Tunnel (opened in 1937), near 42nd Street, was not an original part of the Lincoln Highway. In 1913, Lincoln Highway travelers crossed the Hudson River via the Weehawken Ferry from New York City to Union City, New Jersey. In 1928, the Lincoln Highway was re-routed through the Holland Tunnel (opened in 1927) from New York City to Jersey City. However, the original Lincoln Highway Association made no attempt to map a route from Times Square to the Holland Tunnel.)&quot;
* U.S. Route 1/9 Truck from Jersey City westward to Newark, New Jersey.
* New Jersey Route 27 from Newark southwestward to Princeton, New Jersey.
* U.S. Route 206 from Princeton southwestward to Trenton, New Jersey.
* U.S. Route 1 from Trenton southwestward to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
* U.S. Route 30 from Philadelphia westward across Pennsylvania, the northern tip of West Virginia, and westward across Ohio and Indiana, to Aurora, Illinois.&quot;(Note: There have been many new 4-lane bypasses constructed on U.S. Route 30, so to follow the 1928 route of the Lincoln Highway, at times it is necessary to travel the old U.S. Route 30 alignments through the center of the cities and towns along the route.)&quot;
* Illinois Route 31 from Aurora northwestward to Geneva, Illinois.
* Illinois Route 38 from Geneva westward to Dixon, Illinois.
* Illinois Route 2 from Dixon westward to Sterling, Illinois.
* U.S. Route 30 from Sterling westward across western Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska and Wyoming, to Granger, Wyoming.
* Interstate 80 from Granger westward across western Wyoming and Utah, to West Wendover, Nevada.
* U.S. Route 93 Alternate and U.S. Route 93 from West Wendover southward to Ely, Nevada.
* U.S. Route 50 (aka “The Loneliest Road in America”) from Ely westward across Nevada, to 9 miles west of Fallon, Nevada.
* From 9 miles west of Fallon to Sacramento, California, there are two Lincoln Highway routes over the Sierra Nevada:
** &quot;Sierra Nevada Northern Route&quot;: U.S. Route 50 Alternate northwestward to Wadsworth, Nevada, then Interstate 80 &amp; old U.S. Route 40 westward, through Reno, Nevada, and over Donner Pass and the Sierra Nevada to Sacramento.
** &quot;Sierra Nevada Southern Route&quot;: U.S. Route 50 westward, through Carson City, Nevada, then around Lake Tahoe and over Johnson Pass (nearby Echo Summit) and the Sierra Nevada to Sacramento.
* Old U.S. Route 40 (with sections under Interstate 80) from Sacramento southwestward across California&#x27;s Central Valley to the University Avenue exit in Berkeley, California.&quot;(Note: Originally this leg of the Lincoln Highway followed what would later become U.S. Route 50, from Sacramento south through Stockton crossing the San Joaquin River Bridge at Lathrop and over the Altamont Pass to the East Bay (now Interstates 5, 205, and 580), but was realigned when the Carquinez Bridge in Vallejo, California, was completed in 1927.)&quot;
* University Avenue from Interstate 80 westward to the Berkeley Pier.&quot;(Note: In 1928, Lincoln Highway travelers crossed the San Francisco Bay via a ferry from the Berkeley Pier to the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco.)&quot;
* From the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco, take:
** Hyde Street southward 2 blocks to North Point Street.
** North Point Street westward 3 blocks to Van Ness Avenue.
** Van Ness Avenue southward 16 blocks to California Street.
** California Street westward 54 blocks to 32nd Avenue.
** 32nd Avenue northward 2 blocks to Camino del Mar
** Camino del Mar westward into Lincoln Park, arriving at the Lincoln Highway Western Terminus at the plaza and fountain in front of the California Palace of the Legion of Honor. The Western Terminus Marker and Interpretive Plaque are located to the left of the Palace, next to the bus stop.

==History==
The Lincoln Highway was America&#x27;s first national memorial to President Abraham Lincoln, predating the 1922 dedication of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. by nine years. As the first automobile road across America, the Lincoln Highway brought great prosperity to the hundreds of cities, towns and villages along the way. The Lincoln Highway became affectionately known as &quot;The Main Street Across America&quot;.

The Lincoln Highway was inspired by the Good Roads Movement and the National Old Trails Road. In turn, the success of the Lincoln Highway and the resulting economic boost to the governments, businesses and citizens along its route inspired the creation of many other named long-distance roads (known as National Auto Trails), such as the Yellowstone Trail, Dixie Highway, Jefferson Highway, Bankhead Highway, Jackson Highway, Meridian Highway and Victory Highway. Many of these named highways were supplanted by the United States Numbered Highways system of 1926. Most of the 1928 Lincoln Highway route became U.S. Route 30 (US 30), with portions becoming US 1 in the East and US 40, US 50 and US 93 in the West.

Most significantly, the Lincoln Highway inspired the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, also known as the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act (Public Law 84-627), which was championed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, influenced by his experiences as a young soldier crossing the country in the 1919 Army Convoy on the Lincoln Highway. Today, Interstate 80 (I-80) is the cross-country highway most closely aligned with the Lincoln Highway. In the West, particularly in Wyoming, Utah and California, sections of I-80 are paved directly over old alignments of the Lincoln Highway.

The &quot;Lincoln Highway Association&quot;, originally established in 1913 to plan, promote, and sign the highway, was re-formed in 1992 and is now dedicated to promoting and preserving the road.

===Concept and promotion===
In 1912, railroads dominated interstate transportation in America, and roadways were primarily of local interest. Outside cities, &quot;market roads&quot; were sometimes maintained by counties or townships, but maintenance of rural roads fell to those who lived along them. Many states had constitutional prohibitions against funding &quot;internal improvements&quot; such as road projects, and federal highway programs were not to become effective until 1921.

At the time, the country had about of rural roads, of which a mere 8.66% () had &quot;improved&quot; surfaces: gravel, stone, sand-clay, brick, shells, oiled earth, etc. Interstate roads were considered a luxury, something only for wealthy travelers who could spend weeks riding around in their automobiles.

Support for a system of improved interstate highways had been growing. For example, in 1911, Champ Clark, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, wrote, &quot;I believe the time has come for the general Government to actively and powerfully co-operate with the States in building a great system of public highways ... that would bring its benefits to every citizen in the country&quot;. However, Congress as a whole was not yet ready to commit funding to such projects.
Carl G. Fisher was an early automobile entrepreneur who was the manufacturer of Prest-O-Lite carbide-gas headlights used on most early cars, and was also one of the principal investors who built the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He believed that the popularity of automobiles was dependent on good roads. In 1912, he began promoting his dream of a transcontinental highway and at a September 10 dinner meeting with industry friends in Indianapolis, he called for a coast-to-coast rock highway to be completed by May 1, 1915, in time for the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. He estimated the cost at about $10 million and told the group, &quot;Let&#x27;s build it before we&#x27;re too old to enjoy it!&quot; Within a month Fisher&#x27;s friends had pledged $1 million. Henry Ford, the biggest automaker of his day, refused to contribute because he believed the government should build America&#x27;s roads. However, contributors included former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt and Thomas A. Edison, both friends of Fisher, as well as then-current president Woodrow Wilson, the first U.S. president to make frequent use of an automobile for relaxation.

Fisher and his associates chose a name for the road, naming it after one of Fisher&#x27;s heroes, Abraham Lincoln. At first, they had to consider other names, such as &quot;The Coast-to-Coast Rock Highway&quot; or &quot;The Ocean-to-Ocean Highway,&quot; because the Lincoln Highway name had been reserved earlier by a group of Easterners who were seeking support to build their Lincoln Highway from Washington to Gettysburg on federal funds. When Congress turned down their proposed appropriation, the project collapsed, and Fisher&#x27;s preferred name became readily available.

On July 1, 1913, the Lincoln Highway Association (LHA) was established &quot;to procure the establishment of a continuous improved highway from the Atlantic to the Pacific, open to lawful traffic of all description without toll charges&quot;. The first goal of the LHA was to build the rock highway from Times Square in New York City to Lincoln Park in San Francisco. The second goal was to promote the Lincoln Highway as an example to, in Fisher&#x27;s words, &quot;stimulate as nothing else could the building of enduring highways everywhere that will not only be a credit to the American people but that will also mean much to American agriculture and American commerce&quot;. Henry Joy was named as the LHA president, so that although Carl Fisher remained a driving force in furthering the goals of the association, it would not appear as his one-man crusade.

The first section of the Lincoln Highway to be completed and dedicated was the Essex and Hudson Lincoln Highway, running along the former Newark Plank Road from Newark, New Jersey, to Jersey City, New Jersey. It was dedicated on December 13, 1913 at the request of the Associated Automobile Clubs of New Jersey and the Newark Motor Club, and was named after the two counties it passed through.

===Lincoln statues===

To bring attention to the highway, Fisher commissioned statues of Abraham Lincoln, titled &quot;The Great Emancipator&quot;, to be placed in key locations along the route of the highway. One of the statues was given to Joy in 1914. Joy&#x27;s statue was later presented to the Detroit Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America. That statue was on display at D-bar-A Scout Ranch in Metamora, Michigan. There is another statue of Lincoln in the main entrance of Lincoln Park (Jersey City).

In 1959, Robert Russin erected the Abraham Lincoln Memorial Monument at the highest elevation on the Lincoln Highway; it was relocated to the nearby Sherman Summit Rest Area on I-80 in 1969.

===Route selection and dedication===
The LHA needed to determine the best and most direct route from New York City to San Francisco. East of the Mississippi River, route selection was eased by the relatively dense road network. To scout a western route, the LHA&#x27;s &quot;Trail-Blazer&quot; tour set out from Indianapolis in 17 cars and two trucks on July 1, 1913, the same day LHA headquarters were established in Detroit. After 34 days of Iowa mud pits, sand drifts in Nevada and Utah, overheated radiators, flooded roads, cracked axles, and enthusiastic greetings in every town that thought it had a chance of being on the new highway, the tour arrived for a parade down San Francisco&#x27;s Market Street before thousands of cheering residents.

The Trail-Blazers returned to Indianapolis by train, and a few weeks later on September 14, 1913, the route was announced. LHA leaders, particularly Packard president Henry Joy, wanted as straight a route as possible and the route announced did not necessarily follow the course of the Trail-Blazers. There were many disappointed town officials, particularly in Colorado and Kansas, who had greeted the Trail-Blazers and thought the tour&#x27;s passage had meant their towns would be on the Highway.

Less than half the selected route was improved roadway. As segments were improved over time, the route length was reduced by about . Several segments of the Lincoln Highway route followed historic roads:
* a road laid out by Dutch colonists of New Jersey before 1675
* the 1796 Lancaster Turnpike in Pennsylvania
* the Chambersburg Turnpike, over which much of the Army of Northern Virginia marched to reach the Gettysburg Battlefield, a part of which is traversed by the Lincoln Highway.
* a British military trail built in 1758 by General John Forbes of England from Chambersburg to Pittsburgh during the French and Indian War, later known as the Pittsburgh Road and the Conestoga Road
* a section in Ohio followed an ancient Indian trail known as the Ridge Road
* sections of the Mormon Trail
* the Great Sauk Trail, an Indian trail through northwest Indiana
* portions of the routes of the Cherokee Trail, Overland Trail and the Pony Express
* the Donner Pass crossing of the Sierra Nevada, named after the unfortunate Donner Party of 1846
* an alternate Sierra Nevada crossing at Echo Summit following a pioneer stagecoach and Pony Express route

The LHA dedicated the route on October 31, 1913. Bonfires, fireworks, concerts, parades, and street dances were held in hundreds of cities in the 13 states along the route. During a dedication ceremony in Iowa, State Engineer Thomas H. MacDonald said he felt it was &quot;... the first outlet for the road building energies of this community&quot;. He went on to advocate the creation of a system of transcontinental highways with radial routes. In 1919, MacDonald became Commissioner of the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR), a post he held until 1953, when he oversaw the early stages of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways.

===Publicity===

In September 1912, in a letter to a friend, Fisher wrote that &quot;... the highways of America are built chiefly of politics, whereas the proper material is crushed rock, or concrete&quot;. The leaders of the LHA were masters of the public relations, and used publicity and propaganda as even more important materials.

In the early days of the effort, each contribution from a famous supporter was publicized. Theodore Roosevelt and Thomas Edison, both friends of Fisher, sent checks. A friendly Member of the United States Congress arranged for President Woodrow Wilson, a dedicated motor enthusiast, to contribute $5 whereupon he was issued Highway Certificate #1. Copies of the certificate were promptly distributed to the press.

One of the best-known contributions came from a small group of Native Alaskan children in Anvik, Alaska. Their American teacher told them about Abraham Lincoln and the highway to be built in his honor, and they took up a collection and sent it to the LHA with the note, &quot;Fourteen pennies from Anvik Esquimaux children for the Lincoln Highway&quot;. The LHA distributed pictures of the coins and the accompanying letter, and both were widely reprinted.

One of Fisher&#x27;s first acts after opening LHA headquarters was to hire F. T. Grenell, city editor of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, as a part-time publicity man. The Trail-Blazer tour included representatives of the Hearst newspaper syndicate, the &quot;Indianapolis Star and News&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and telegraph companies to help transmit their dispatches.

In preparation for the October 31 dedication ceremonies, the LHA asked clergy across the United States to discuss Abraham Lincoln in their sermons on November 2, the Sunday nearest the dedication. The LHA then distributed copies of many of the sermons, such as one by Cardinal James Gibbons who, with the dedication fresh in mind, had written that &quot;such a highway will be a most fitting and useful monument to the memory of Lincoln&quot;.

One of the greater contributions to highway development was a well-publicized and promoted United States Army Transcontinental Motor Convoy in 1919. The convoy left the White House in Washington, D.C., on July 7, 1919, and met the Lincoln Highway route at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. After two months of travel, the convoy reached San Francisco on September 6, 1919. Though bridges failed, vehicles broke and were sometimes stuck in mud, the convoy was greeted in communities across the country. The LHA used the convoy&#x27;s difficulties to show the need for better main highways, building popular support for both local and federal funding. The convoy led to the passage of many county bond issues supporting highway construction.

One of the participants in the convoy was Lieutenant Colonel Dwight D. Eisenhower, and it was so memorable that he devoted a chapter to it (&quot;Through Darkest America With Truck and Tank&quot;) in his 1967 book &quot;At Ease: Stories I Tell to Friends&quot; (Doubleday and Company, Inc., 1967). &quot;The trip had been difficult, tiring and fun,&quot; he said. That 1919 experience on the Lincoln Highway, and his exposure to the autobahn network in Germany in the 1940s, found expression in 1954 when he announced his &quot;Grand Plan&quot; for highways. The resulting Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 created the Highway Trust Fund that accelerated construction of the Interstate Highway System.

Fisher&#x27;s idea that the auto industry and private contributions could pay for the highway was soon abandoned, and, while the LHA did help finance a few short sections of roadway, LHA founders&#x27; and members&#x27; contributions were used primarily for publicity and promotion to encourage travel on the Highway and to lobby officials at all levels to support its construction by governments.

===Early travel===
According to the Association&#x27;s 1916 &quot;Official Road Guide&quot; a trip from the Atlantic to the Pacific on the Lincoln Highway was &quot;something of a sporting proposition&quot; and might take 20 to 30 days. To make it in 30 days the motorist would need to average an hour for 6 hours per day, and driving was only done during daylight hours. The trip was thought to cost no more than $5 a day per person, including food, gas, oil, and even &quot;five or six meals in hotels&quot;. Car repairs would, of course, increase the cost.

Since gasoline stations were still rare in many parts of the country, motorists were urged to top off their gasoline at every opportunity, even if they had done so recently. Motorists should wade through water before driving through to verify the depth. The list of recommended equipment included chains, a shovel, axe, jacks, tire casings and inner tubes, tools, and (of course) a pair of Lincoln Highway pennants. And, the guide offered this sage advice: &quot;Don&#x27;t wear new shoes&quot;.

Firearms were not necessary, but west of Omaha full camping equipment was recommended, and the guide warned against drinking alkali water that could cause serious cramps. In certain areas, advice was offered on getting help, for example near Fish Springs, Utah, &quot;If trouble is experienced, build a sagebrush fire. Mr. Thomas will come with a team. He can see you 20 miles off&quot;. Later editions omitted Mr. Thomas, but westbound travelers were advised to stop at the Orr&#x27;s Ranch for advice, and eastbound motorists were to check with Mr. K.C. Davis of Gold Hill, Nevada.

===Seedling miles and the ideal section===

The Lincoln Highway Association did not have enough funds to sponsor large sections of the road, but from 1914 it did sponsor &quot;seedling mile&quot; projects. According to the 1924 LHA Guide the seedling miles were intended &quot;to demonstrate the desirability of this permanent type of road construction&quot; to rally public support for government-backed construction. The LHA convinced industry of their self-interest and was able to arrange donations of materials from the Portland Cement Association.

The first seedling mile (1.6 km) was built in 1914 west of Malta, Illinois; but, after years of experience, the LHA organized a design plan for a road section that could handle traffic 20 years into the future. Seventeen highway experts met between December 1920 and February 1921, and specified:
:*a right-of-way in width
:*a concrete road bed wide and thick to support loads of per wheel
:*curves with a minimum radius of , banked for , with guard rails at embankments
:*no grade crossings or advertising signs
:*a footpath for pedestrians

The most famous seedling mile built to these specifications was the &quot;ideal section&quot; between Dyer and Schererville in Lake County, Indiana. With federal, state, and county funds, and a $130,000 contribution by United States Rubber Company president and LHA founder C.B. Seger, the ideal section was built during 1922 and 1923. Magazines and newspapers called the ideal section a vision of the future, and highway officials from across the country visited and wrote technical papers that circulated both in the United States and overseas. The ideal section is still in use to this day, and has worn so well that a driver would not notice it unless the marker near the road brought it to their attention.

===United States Numbered Highways===

By the mid-1920s there were about 250 national auto trails. Some were major routes, such as the Lincoln Highway, the Jefferson Highway, the Dixie Highway, the National Old Trails Road, the Old Spanish Trail, and the Yellowstone Trail, but most were shorter. Some of the shorter routes were formed more to generate revenues for a trail association rather than for their value as a route between significant locations.

By 1925 governments had joined the roadbuilding movement, and began to assert control. Federal and state officials established the Joint Board on Interstate Highways, which proposed a numbered U.S. Highway System which would make the trail designations obsolete, though technically the joint board had no authority over highway names. Increasing government support for roadbuilding was making the old road associations less important, but the LHA still had significant influence. The secretary of the joint board, BPR official E. W. James, went to Detroit to gain LHA support for the numbering scheme, knowing it would be hard for smaller road associations to object if the LHA publicly supported the new plan.

The LHA preferred numbering the existing named routes, but in the end the LHA was more interested in the larger plan for roadbuilding than they were in officially retaining the name. They knew the Lincoln Highway name was fixed in the mind of the public, and James promised them that, so far as possible, the Lincoln Highway would have the number 30 for its entire route. An editorial in the February 1926 issue of &quot;The Lincoln Highway Forum&quot; reflected the outcome:

The states approved the new national numbering system in November 1926 and began putting up new signs. The Lincoln Highway was not alone in being split among several numbers, but the entire routing between Philadelphia and Granger, Wyoming, was assigned US 30 per the agreement. East of Philadelphia the Lincoln Highway was part of US 1, and west of Salt Lake City the route became US 50 across Nevada and then US 40 over Donner Pass. Only the segment between Granger and Salt Lake City was not part of the new numbering plan; US 30 was assigned to a more northerly route toward Pocatello, Idaho. When US 50 was extended to California it followed the Lincoln Highway&#x27;s alternate route south of Lake Tahoe.

The last major promotional activity of the LHA took place on September 1, 1928, when at 1:00 p.m. groups of Boy Scouts placed approximately 2,400 concrete markers at sites along the route to officially mark and dedicate it to the memory of Abraham Lincoln. Less commonly known is that 4,000 metal signs for urban areas were also erected then. The markers were placed on the outer edge of the right of way at major and minor crossroads, and at reassuring intervals along uninterrupted segments. Each concrete post carried the Lincoln Highway insignia and directional arrow, as well as a bronze medallion with Lincoln&#x27;s bust stating, &quot;This Highway Dedicated to Abraham Lincoln&quot;.

The Lincoln Highway was not yet the imagined &quot;rock highway&quot; from coast to coast when the LHA ceased operating, as there were many segments that had still not been paved. Some parts were because of reroutings, such as a dispute in the early 1920s with Utah officials that forced the LHA to change routes in western Utah and eastern Nevada. Construction was underway on the final unpaved segment by the 25th anniversary of the Lincoln Highway in 1938.

===25th anniversary===
On June 8, 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1938, which called for a BPR report on the feasibility of a system of transcontinental toll roads. The &quot;Toll Roads and Free Roads&quot; report was the first official step toward creation of the Interstate Highway System in the United States.

The 25th Anniversary of the Lincoln Highway was noted a month later in a July 3, 1938, nationwide radio broadcast on NBC Radio. The program featured interviews with a number of LHA officials, and a message from Carl Fisher read by an announcer in Detroit. Fisher&#x27;s statement included:
===Since 1940===
Fisher died about a year after the 25th anniversary in 1939, having lost most of his fortune as a result of the great hurricane that slammed Miami Beach in 1928, followed by the Great Depression at the same time that he was pouring millions of dollars into his Montauk Long Island resort development.

On June 29, 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, authorizing the construction of the Interstate Highway System. The New York-to-San Francisco transcontinental route in the system, Interstate 80, would however largely follow a different path across the country than US 30. I-80 would also not be signed all the way to the New York City, instead terminating in Teaneck, New Jersey, west of the Hudson River just a few miles short of the George Washington Bridge.

In the years since, the Lincoln Highway has remained a persistent memory:

* Many segments of US 30 across the United States from Philadelphia to western Wyoming, US 50 in Nevada and California, and old US 40 in California still carry the name.
* Many historical Lincoln Highway monuments and markers remain, and many new monuments and directional signs are being added.
* In New Jersey, parts of US 1/9 and New Jersey Route 27 still carry the name.
* Some city streets on which the Lincoln Highway was routed still carry the street name &quot;Lincoln Way&quot; or &quot;Lincolnway&quot; including: Massillon, Ohio; Lisbon, Ohio; South Bend, Indiana; Mishawaka, Indiana; Valparaiso, Indiana; Aurora, Illinois; DeKalb, Illinois; Ames, Iowa; Cheyenne, Wyoming; Sparks, Nevada; Auburn, California; and Galt, California.
* Old Lincoln Highway is a secondary street in Trevose, Pennsylvania, using the old highway alignment. As well as Old Lincoln Highway in Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania, Business Route 1 in Lower Bucks County that runs from Morrisville to Penndel, Pennsylvania, where it connects with Route 1 Super Highway where the Lincoln Highway got cut off because of the Highway system being built.
* Many of the 2,400 Boy Scout markers can be found along the old route. In some communities, these are being re-established in cooperation with the LHA, such as West Sacramento and Davis, California.
* A stretch near Omaha, Nebraska, paved with original brick has been preserved by the city government.
* A bridge with railings spelling out &quot;Lincoln Highway&quot; remains in use as part of County Road E66 in Tama County, Iowa.
* Restaurants, motels, and gas stations in many locations still carry Lincoln-related names.
* Near Wamsutter, Wyoming, on what was then thought to be the Continental Divide along old US 30, a monument was erected in 1938 to Henry B. Joy, the first president of the LHA, with an inscription describing Joy as one &quot;who saw realized the dream of a continuous improved highway from the Atlantic to the Pacific.&quot; Not far from the memorial along I-80 a motorist could see an abandoned stretch of the Lincoln Highway with weeds growing through cracks in the pavement. In 2001, this monument was relocated to a place on I-80 midway between Cheyenne and Laramie.
* At the rest area off exit 323 of I-80 east of Laramie is Sherman Summit, the highest point on all of I-80. Located there is a thirteen and a half foot bronze bust of Lincoln, the Abraham Lincoln Memorial Monument. It is mounted on a massive, thirty-five foot granite base. The monument was created in 1959 to mark the high point of the Lincoln Highway and it originally stood about half a mile west and higher along US 30 which closely followed the path of the Lincoln Highway across this summit. It was moved to the present location in 1969 after I-80 was opened. Robert Russin, an art professor at the University of Wyoming created this stern, brooding sculpture. It was cast in 30 pieces in the favorable climate of Mexico City and assembled in Wyoming. The base is hollow and has ladders and lightning rods inside.
* Will County, Illinois, has four schools named after the highway: Lincoln-Way Central High School in New Lenox, Lincoln-Way East High School in Frankfort, Lincoln-Way West High School in New Lenox, and Lincoln-Way North High School in Frankfort. All schools are members of Lincoln-Way Community High School District 210.

===Historic recognition===

==Revitalized Lincoln Highway Association==
The Lincoln Highway Association was re-formed in 1992 with the mission, &quot;... to identify, preserve, and improve access to the remaining portions of the Lincoln Highway and its associated historic sites&quot;. The new LHA publishes a quarterly magazine, &quot;The Lincoln Highway Forum&quot;, and holds conferences each year in cities along the route. Its 700 members are located in 44 states and Washington D.C., and in Canada, England and Germany. There are active state chapters in 10 Lincoln Highway states and a national tourist center in Franklin Grove, Illinois, in a historic building built by Harry Isaac Lincoln, a cousin of Abraham Lincoln. The LHA is governed by a board of directors with representatives from each Lincoln Highway state.

===21st-century tours===
In 2003, the Lincoln Highway Association sponsored the 90th Anniversary Tour of the entire road, from Times Square in New York City to Lincoln Park in San Francisco. The tour group, led by Bob Lichty and Rosemary Rubin of LHA and sponsored by Lincoln-Mercury division of the Ford Motor Company, set out from Times Square on August 17, 2003. Approximately 35 vintage and modern vehicles, including several new Lincoln Town Cars and Lincoln Navigators from Lincoln-Mercury, traveled about per day and attempted to cover as many of the original Lincoln Highway alignments as possible. The group was met by LHA chapters, car clubs, local tourism groups and community leaders throughout the route. Several Boy Scout troops along the way held ceremonies to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the nationwide LH route marker post erection of September 1, 1928. When the tour concluded at Lincoln Park, in front of the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco, another ceremony was held to honor both the 90th anniversary of the road and the 75th anniversary of the post erections.

In 2013, the Lincoln Highway Association hosted the Centennial Tour commemorating the highway&#x27;s 100th anniversary. Over 270 people traveling in 140 vehicles, from 28 states and from Australia, Canada, England, Germany, Norway and Russia, participated in the two tours which started simultaneously the last week of June 2013 in New York City and San Francisco, and took one week to reach the midpoint of the Lincoln Highway in Kearney, Nebraska. The tour cars, both historical and modern, spanned 100 years, from 1913 to 2013, and included two of Henry B. Joy&#x27;s original Lincoln Highway Packards, as well as a 1948 Tucker (car #8). On June 30, 2013, the Centennial Parade in downtown Kearney featuring the tour cars plus another 250 historic vehicles was attended by 12,500 people. The next day, on July 1, 2013, the Lincoln Highway Centennial Celebration Gala was hosted at the Great Platte River Road Archway Museum in Kearney, where a proclamation from the United States Senate was presented to the Lincoln Highway Association.

An independent international motor tour also toured the highway from July 1–26. Seventy-one classic cars were shipped from Europe to the United States and driven the entire route before being shipped home.

In 2015, the Lincoln Highway Association hosted a tour celebrating the 100th anniversary of the famed 1915 tour led by Henry B. Joy, president of the original Lincoln Highway Association, from Detroit to the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. Joy was president of the Packard Motor Car Company. Both the Packard Club (Packard Automobile Classics) and the Packards International Motor Car Club participated in the planning of the tour. The 2015 tour, with 103 people in 55 cars, took 12 days and traveled from the Packard Proving Grounds north of Detroit to the Lincoln Highway Western Terminus in Lincoln Park in San Francisco.

In 2019, the Lincoln Highway Association hosted a tour celebrating the 100th anniversary of the historic 1919 United States Army Transcontinental Motor Convoy, from Washington D.C. to San Francisco, California. The 2019 tour group, led by LHA Tour Chair James Cassler and LHA Mapping Chair Paul Gilger, had 81 participants in 55 cars. It departed Washington D.C. on Saturday, August 31 and took 17 days to travel , arriving in San Francisco on Monday, September 16.

==Mapping==
In 2012, the 25-member Lincoln Highway Association National Mapping Committee, chaired by Paul Gilger, completed the research and cartography of the entire Lincoln Highway and all its subsequent realignments (totaling ), a project which took more than 20 years. The association&#x27;s free interactive &quot;Official Map of the Lincoln Highway&quot; website includes map, terrain, satellite and street-level views of the entire Lincoln Highway and all of its re-alignments, markers, monuments and historic points of interest. Recent additions to the map are the locations of electric vehicle charging stations and RV campgrounds along the Highway.

==Roadside giants==

During early Lincoln Highway days, business owners were intrigued with all the automobiles traveling the Lincoln Highway. In an effort to capture the business of these new motorists, some entrepreneurs created larger-than-life buildings in quirky shapes. Structures like Bedford&#x27;s -story coffee pot, or the Shoe House near York, Pennsylvania, are examples of the &quot;Roadside Giants&quot; of the Lincoln Highway.
In 2008, the Lincoln Highway Heritage Corridor secured funding from the Sprout Fund in Pittsburgh for a new kind of Roadside Giants of the Lincoln Highway. High school boys and girls enrolled in five different career and technology schools along the Lincoln Highway Heritage Corridor were invited to create their own Giant that would be permanently installed along the old Lincoln. The project involved collaboration among the schools&#x27; graphic arts, welding, building trades, and culinary arts departments. A structural engineer was hired to provide professional guidance to the design and installation of the Giants. They include:
* A 1920s Packard Car and Driver
* A , replica of a 1940s Bennett Gas Pump
* The &quot;Bicycle Built for Two&quot;
* The oversized quarter, weighing almost a ton
* A detailed 1921 Selden pick-up truck
* The world&#x27;s largest teapot, tall and wide

==Medicine==
The carotid sheath, a layer of connective tissue, was called the &quot;Lincoln Highway of the Neck&quot; by Harris B. Mosher in his 1929 address to the American Academy of Otology, because of its role in the spread of infections.

===Literature===
In 1914, Effie Price Gladding wrote &quot;Across the Continent by the Lincoln Highway&quot; about her travel adventures on the road with her husband Thomas. Subsequently, Gladding wrote the foreword to the Lincoln Highway Association&#x27;s first road guide, directing it to women motorists. Her 1914 book was the first full-size hardback book to discuss transcontinental travel, as well as the first to mention the Lincoln Highway:

In 1916, &quot;Mistress of Etiquette&quot; Emily Post was commissioned by &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine to cross the United States on the Lincoln Highway and write about it. Her son Edwin drove, and an unnamed family member joined them. Her story was published as a book, &quot;By Motor to the Golden Gate&quot;. Her fame came later in 1922, with the publication of her first etiquette book.

In 1919, author Beatrice Massey, who was a passenger as her husband drove, travelled across the country on the Lincoln Highway. When they reached Salt Lake City, Utah, instead of taking the rough and desolate Lincoln Highway around the south end of the Salt Lake Desert, they took the even more rough and more desolate &quot;non-Lincoln&quot; route around the north end of the Great Salt Lake. The arduousness of that section of the trip was instrumental in the Masseys deciding to ditch their road trip in Montello, Nevada (northeast of Wells, Nevada) where they paid $196.69 to ship their automobile and themselves by train the rest of the way to California. Nevertheless, an enthusiastic Beatrice Massey wrote in her 1919 travelogue &quot;It Might Have Been Worse&quot;:

In 1927, humorist Frederic Van de Water wrote &quot;The Family Flivvers to Frisco&quot;, an autobiographical account of him and his wife, a young couple from New York City, piling their belongings and their six-year-old son into their Model T Ford and camping their way to San Francisco on the Lincoln Highway, traveling over through 12 states in 37 days. In his book, not much is made of the burden of traveling with a child who has a mind of his own. When they were forced by passing cars into a ditch near DeKalb, Illinois, Van de Water writes that his son (&quot;a small irate figure in yellow oilskins&quot;), &quot;scrambled over the door and started to walk in the general direction of New York&quot;. The Van de Waters&#x27; travel expenses for their entire trip amounted to $247.83.

In 1951, Clinton Twiss authored the famous and funny memoir &quot;The Long, Long Trailer&quot;, about his adventures living in a trailer and traveling across America with his wife Merle. Many of their episodes occurred on the Lincoln Highway, including almost losing their brakes coming down off Donner Pass, barely squeezing across the narrow Lyons-Fulton Bridge over the Mississippi River, and getting stopped at the Holland Tunnel because trailers with propane tanks weren&#x27;t allowed through. Twiss&#x27;s book became the basis for the popular 1954 MGM film of the same name, directed by Vincente Minnelli, and starring Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball. Although no filming occurred on the Lincoln Highway, early in the movie, Desi, who finds Lucy&#x27;s suggestion of living in a trailer ridiculous, jokes: &quot;The Collinis at home! Please drop in for cocktails! You&#x27;ll find us someplace along the Lincoln Highway!&quot;

In April 1988, the University of Iowa Press published &quot;Lincoln Highway, the Main Street Across America&quot;, a text-and-photo essay and history by Drake Hokanson. Hokanson had been intrigued by the mystery of this once-famous highway, and tried to explain the fascination with the route in an August 1985 article in &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine:

From 1995 through 2009, author and historian Gregory Franzwa (1926–2009) wrote a state-by-state series of books about the Lincoln Highway. Franzwa completed seven books: &quot;The Lincoln Highway: Iowa&quot; (1995), &quot;The Lincoln Highway: Nebraska&quot; (1996), &quot;The Lincoln Highway: Wyoming&quot; (1999), &quot;The Lincoln Highway: Utah&quot; (with Jesse G. Petersen, 2003), &quot;The Lincoln Highway: Nevada&quot; (with Jesse G. Petersen, 2004), &quot;The Lincoln Highway: California&quot; (2006), and &quot;The Lincoln Highway: Illinois&quot; (2009). The books were published by the Patrice Press. Each state book contains both detailed history and USGS level maps showing the various Lincoln Highway alignments. Franzwa served as the first president of the revitalized Lincoln Highway Association, in 1992.

In 2002, British author Pete Davies wrote &quot;American Road: The Story of an Epic Transcontinental Journey at the Dawn of the Motor Age&quot;, about the 1919 Army Convoy on the Lincoln Highway. About the book, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said:
In 2005, &quot;Greetings from the Lincoln Highway: America&#x27;s First Coast-to-Coast Road&quot;, a comprehensive coffee table book by Brian Butko, became the first complete guide to the road, with maps, directions, photos, postcards, memorabilia, and histories of towns, people, and places. A mix of research and on-the-road fun, the book placed the LHA&#x27;s early history in the context of roadbuilding, politics, and geography, explaining why the Lincoln followed the path it did across the US, including the oft-forgotten Colorado Loop through Denver. Butko&#x27;s book also incorporated quotes from early motoring memoirs and postcard messages—sometimes funny, sometimes painfully descriptive of early motoring woes—hence the &quot;Greetings&quot; title. Butko had previously written an exhaustive guide to the Lincoln Highway in Pennsylvania in 1996, which was revised and republished in 2002 with different photos and postcard images.

In July 2007, the W.W. Norton Company published &quot;The Lincoln Highway, Coast-to-Coast from Times Square to the Golden Gate: The Great American Road Trip&quot; by Michael Wallis, best-selling author of &quot;Route 66&quot;, and voice in the movie &quot;Cars&quot;, and Michael Williamson, twice a Pulitzer-Prize winning photographer with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

Completed in 2009, Stackpole Books published &quot;Lincoln Highway Companion: A Guide to America&#x27;s First Coast-to-Coast Road&quot;, authored by Brian Butko. This handy glove-compartment guide contains carefully charted maps, must-see attractions, and places to eat and sleep that are slices of pure Americana. The book covers the major thirteen states the Lincoln Highway passes through, from New York to San Francisco, as well as the little-known Colorado loop and the Washington DC feeder loop.

In October 2021, author Amor Towles released his third novel, &quot;The Lincoln Highway&quot;, a fictional coming-of-age story of four boys on a road trip along the Lincoln Highway.

===Music===
In 1914, the &quot;Lincoln Highway March&quot;, a band score, was written by Lylord J. St. Claire.

In 1921, the popular two step march &quot;Lincoln Highway&quot; was composed by Harry J. Lincoln. The sheet music featuring an uncredited drawing of the road on the cover. Lincoln was also the publisher, and was based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania very near to where the highway passed through the city.

In 1922, another march titled &quot;Lincoln Highway March&quot; was composed by George B. Lutz, and published by Kramer&#x27;s Music House of Allentown, Pennsylvania. Two different videos of player-piano versions can be viewed on YouTube.

In 1928, the song &quot;Golden Gate&quot; (Dreyer, Meyer, Rose, &amp; Jolson), sung by Al Jolson, included the refrain: &quot;Oh, Golden Gate, I&#x27;m comin&#x27; to ya / Golden Gate, sing Hallelujah / I&#x27;ll live in the sun, love in the moon / Where every month is June. / A little sun-kissed blonde is comin&#x27; my way / Just beyond the Lincoln Highway / I&#x27;m goin&#x27; strong now, it won&#x27;t be long now / Open up that Golden Gate.&quot;

In 1937, composer Harold Arlen and lyricist E. Y. Harburg (composers of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; and many other hits) wrote the song &quot;God&#x27;s Country&quot;, for the 1937 musical &quot;Hooray for What!&quot; The song was subsequently used for the finale of the 1939 MGM musical &quot;Babes in Arms&quot;, starring Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney and directed by Busby Berkeley. The song starts with the famous lyric: &quot;Hey there, neighbor, goin&#x27; my way? / East or west on the Lincoln Highway? / Hey there Yankee, give out with a great big thank-ee; / You&#x27;re in God&#x27;s Country!&quot;

In the 1940s, the &quot;Lincoln Highway&quot; radio show on NBC featured the theme song &quot;When You Travel the Great Lincoln Highway&quot;. A rare surviving recording of the song can be found online.

Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;the Asch Recordings&quot; 1944 and 1945 included his song &quot;Hard Traveling&quot; with the line &quot;I&#x27;ve been walking that Lincoln Highway / I thought you knowed&quot;.

In 1945, the title ballad (music by Earl Robinson, lyrics by Millard Lampell) from the 20th Century Fox World War II film &quot;A Walk In The Sun&quot; mentions the Lincoln Highway: &quot;It&#x27;s the same road they had / Coming out of Stalingrad, / It&#x27;s that old Lincoln Highway back home, / It&#x27;s wherever men fight to be free&quot;.

In 1974, the song &quot;Old Thirty&quot; was composed by Bill Fries (C.W. McCall) and Chip Davis for the album &quot;Wolf Creek Pass&quot;. An early verse contains the lyric: &quot;She was known to all the truckers / As the Mighty Lincoln Highway / But to me She&#x27;s still Old Thirty all the way&quot;.

In 1994, the song &quot;Lincoln Highway Dub&quot; is an all instrumental song created by the band Sublime in their album &quot;Robbin&#x27; the Hood&quot;. It features elements later used in the well-known song &quot;Santeria&quot;, also by Sublime.

In 1996, Shadric Smith composed the country-western swing &quot;Rollin&#x27; Down That Lincoln Highway&quot; which was recorded in 2003 by Smith and Denny Osburn. In 2008, Smith revised some of the lyrics. The original 2003 recording of the song and the revised 2008 version can be found online. &quot;Rollin&#x27; Down That Lincoln Highway&quot; is one of two Lincoln Highway inspired songs that was featured in the 2014 documentary film &quot;100 Years on the Lincoln Highway&quot; produced by Tom Manning for Wyoming PBS.

In 2004, Mark Rushton released the CD &quot;The Driver&#x27;s Companion&quot;. The lead track is Rushton&#x27;s composition &quot;Theme from Lincoln Highway&quot;, an ambient electronic soundscape.

In 2013, for the 100th anniversary of the Lincoln Highway, Nils Anders Erickson composed the country song &quot;Goin Down the Lincoln Highway&quot;, featuring steel guitar and honky-tonk piano. The accompanying video, which can be viewed on YouTube, features over 300 images captured by Erickson of current and destroyed landmarks from Council Bluffs, Iowa, and three versions of the Historic Douglas St. Bridge.

In 2013, in celebration of the Lincoln Highway&#x27;s Centennial, Nolan Stolz composed the symphony &quot;Lincoln Highway Suite&quot;. The symphony has five movements: &quot;From the Hudson&quot;, &quot;Metals Heartland&quot;, &quot;Prairie View&quot;, &quot;Traversing the Mountains&quot; and &quot;Golden State Romp&quot;. The Dubuque Symphony premiered the composition June 2013.

Also in 2013, singer Cecelia Otto traveled the Lincoln Highway from New York to San Francisco for her project American Songline, in which she performed vintage songs in period attire in venues along the highway. In 2015, she published a book recounting her journey and released an album of songs from her concert program; the album also featured several original songs about the highway, including &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to California&quot; and &quot;Land of Lincoln&quot;.

===Radio===
On March 16, 1940, NBC Radio introduced a Saturday morning dramatic show called &quot;Lincoln Highway&quot; sponsored by Shinola Polish, which featured stories of life along the route. The show&#x27;s introduction contained an error in noting the Lincoln Highway was identical to US 30 and ended in Portland. Many of the era&#x27;s stars including Ethel Barrymore, Joe E. Brown, Claude Rains, Sam Levene, Burgess Meredith, and Joan Bennett made appearances on the show, which had an audience of more than 8 million before it left the air in 1942. A rare surviving recording of the show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;When You Travel the Great Lincoln Highway&quot;, survives online.

===Television===
On October 29, 2008, PBS premiered the documentary film, &quot;A Ride Along the Lincoln Highway&quot;, produced by Rick Sebak with WQED—TV in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Lincoln Highway Association awarded Sebak its first &quot;Gregory M. Franzwa Award&quot; at the 2009 LHA conference. The Franzwa Award is given to individuals who have made a significant contribution to the promotion of the Lincoln Highway, and is named in honor of Franzwa who was a founding member and the first president of the revitalized Lincoln Highway Association, in 1992.

The pilot episode of &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, shown on HBO in the United States, beginning in September 2010, contains a scene showing Al Capone en route from New Jersey to Chicago. He passes a sign that says he is travelling on the Lincoln Highway and that Chicago is ahead (thus placing him in western Ohio). This episode is set in early 1920.

On March 9, 2014, Wyoming PBS premiered the Emmy Award-winning documentary film, &quot;100 Years on the Lincoln Highway&quot;, produced by Tom Manning. This hour-long documentary follows the route of the Lincoln Highway in Wyoming and explores many of the towns and landmarks along the way. Shot during its centennial year in 2013, the program features historians, authors, archeologists and Lincoln Highway enthusiasts explaining the history of the road and their fascination with its many permutations over the years. It also follows members of the official Lincoln Highway Association&#x27;s Centennial Tour. Driving a collection of antique &amp; modern automobiles spanning 100 years, they trace the original route of the Lincoln Highway across Wyoming.

===Film===
In 1919, Fox Film Corporation produced and released the feature &quot;The Lincoln Highwayman&quot;, a black and white silent film starring William Russell, Lois Lee, Frank Brownlee, Jack Connolly, Edward Peil, Sr., Harry Spingler, and Edwin B. Tilton. The film was written and directed by Emmett J. Flynn, from an adaptation by Jules Furthman based on a 1917 one-act melodrama by Paul Dickey and Rol Cooper Megrue. The story is about a masked bandit (the &quot;Lincoln Highwayman&quot;) who terrorizes motorists on the highway in California. His latest victims are a San Francisco banker and his family on their way to a party. While the masked highwayman holds them up at gun point and steals the women&#x27;s jewels, the banker&#x27;s daughter Marian (Lois Lee) finds herself strangely attracted to him. When the family finally arrives at the party, they tell the guests their tale. Steele, a secret service man (Edward Piel), takes an interest in their encounter and starts working on the case. Jimmy Clunder (William Russell), who arrives late is talking to Marian when a locket falls out of his pocket. Marian recognizes it, and Clunder claims that he found it on the Lincoln Highway. She begins to suspect that he is the Lincoln Highwayman, as does Steele, Clunder&#x27;s rival for Marian&#x27;s love.

In 1924, the Ford Motor Company produced and released &quot;Fording the Lincoln Highway&quot;. The 30-minute silent film documented the 10-millionth Ford Model T and its promotional tour on the Lincoln Highway. The car came off the assembly line of Ford&#x27;s Highland Park Assembly Plant on June 15, 1924, which was the 16th year of Model T production. The milestone flivver led parades through most of the towns and cities along the Lincoln Highway. It was driven by Ford racer Frank Kulick. Several million people are estimated to have seen the vehicle, which was greeted by governors and mayors at each stop along the route.
In 2016 a documentary named &quot;21 Days Under the Sky&quot; chronicled a journey of four friends on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, riding the Lincoln Highway from San Francisco to New York.

In 2023, Noah Caldwell-Gervais published a 7.5-hour video travelogue about his journey along the original 1913 route in a 1978 Ford Thunderbird on his YouTube channel. According to Caldwell-Gervais, the film is in the style of a classic travelogue and merges historic fact and personal experience into a unified narrative.

<text>Rupelmonde is a village in the municipality of Kruibeke, in the Belgian province of East Flanders. It is located on the banks of the river Schelde opposite the confluence with the eponymous Rupel, and is known for its sundials as well as having what is probably Belgium&#x27;s only tidemill. It is the birthplace of Gerardus Mercator, (1512–1594) the Flemish cartographer, who was imprisoned for several months in the castle there, a remnant of which today serves as a museum.

The town holds a procession of civic giants on the first Sunday of August each year.

<text>IANAL is a Usenet and chat abbreviation (initialism) for the expansion &quot;I am not a lawyer&quot;. The expansion may be used by non-lawyers who are seeking to avoid accusations of unauthorized practice of law and are not making any recommendation to the particular addressee of their remarks.

A related abbreviation, TINLA, stands for &quot;This is not legal advice&quot;. One or both of these expansions often precede opinions about law. The use of these expansions serves as a warning for the reader not to take the opinion as professional legal advice. Many jurisdictions have legal restrictions on actually giving or even appearing to give legal advice, or otherwise practicing as a lawyer without legal qualifications and official registration. Rendition of legal advice by a person who is not licensed to do so can be the basis for a charge of unauthorized practice of law.

== Origin and usage ==
The term IANAL is reported to have been common on Usenet by the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The case law standard for determining what comments cross the line is generally &quot;the application of law to facts specific to an individual seeking legal advice&quot;. Attorneys may use a disclaimer to reduce confusion, and &quot;I am not your lawyer&quot; is part of a typical disclaimer. There are &quot;weighty obligations&quot; that go along with the creation of a lawyer–client relationship, particularly if an &quot;online exchange includes legal advice relating to the client&#x27;s specific facts&quot;. Courts have held that (in the case of 900 numbers) boilerplate disclaimers without clear actions to indicate assent may not avoid the creation of a lawyer–client relationship.

Variations of IANAL can be applied to different fields, such as IANAMD for &quot;I am not a medical doctor&quot; or IANAP for &quot;I am not a physicist&quot; These expansions serve the same general purpose as IANALto discourage the use of the information as professional advice.

<text>The Battle of Yamen (), also known as the Battle of Yashan (), was a naval battle which took place in southern China on 19 March 1279. It is considered to be the last stand of the Song dynasty against the invading forces of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. Although outnumbered 10 to 1, the Yuan navy delivered a crushing tactical and strategic victory, destroying the Song.

Today, the battle site is located in the town of Yamen, in Xinhui County, Jiangmen, Guangdong.

==Background==
In 1276, the Southern Song court, in their rush to flee the capital city of Lin&#x27;an to avoid Yuan forces approaching Fuzhou, left Emperor Gong behind to be captured. Hopes of resistance centered on two young princes, Gong&#x27;s brothers. The older boy, Zhao Shi, was declared emperor. In 1277, when Fuzhou fell to the Yuan dynasty, the exiled Southern Song dynasty fled to Quanzhou, where Zhang Shijie, the Grand General of Song, hoped to borrow boats to continue their flight. However, the Muslim merchant Pu Shougeng refused their request, prompting Zhang to confiscate Pu&#x27;s properties and flee on stolen boats with the Southern Song court. In fury, Pu slaughtered imperial clan members and many officials in Quanzhou and surrendered to the Yuan, strengthening the Yuan&#x27;s naval power.

At this point of the war, it was obvious that the Song did not have sufficient strength to risk fighting the Yuan in a head-on conflict. Zhang Shijie decided to build a vast fleet with what remained, to allow the Song court and soldiers to move from place to place until the situation improved. The Song court sailed to Guangdong from Quanzhou. However, Zhao Shi&#x27;s boat capsized in a storm on the way to Leizhou. Although he survived, he fell ill because of this ordeal. The imperial court later sought refuge in Lantau Island&#x27;s Mui Wo, where Zhao Shi eventually died; he was succeeded by his younger sibling, Zhao Bing, who was seven. Zhang Shijie brought the new emperor to Yamen and prepared the defense against the Yuan there.

In 1278, Wen Tianxiang, who had fought against the Yuan in Guangdong and Jiangxi, was captured by Wang Weiyi in Haifeng County, eliminating all the Song land forces nearby.

==Battle==
In 1279, Zhang Hongfan of the Yuan attacked the Song navy in Yamen. Li Heng, who previously had captured Guangzhou, reinforced Zhang Hongfan. Some within the Song forces suggested that the navy should first claim the mouth of the bay, to secure their line of retreat to the west. Zhang Shijie turned down this suggestion in order to prevent his soldiers from fleeing the battle. He then ordered the burning of all palaces, houses and forts on land for the same reason.

Zhang Shijie ordered about 1,000 ships to be chained together, forming a long string within the bay, and placed Zhao Bing&#x27;s boat in the center of his fleet. This was done to prevent individual Song ships from fleeing the battle. The Yuan forces steered fire ships into the Song formation, but the Song ships were prepared for such an attack: all Song ships had been painted with fire-resistant mud. The Yuan navy then blockaded the bay, while the Yuan army cut off the Song&#x27;s fresh water and wood sources on land. The Song side, with many non-combatants, soon ran out of supplies. The Song soldiers were forced to eat dry foods and drink sea water, causing nausea and vomiting. Zhang Hongfan even kidnapped Zhang Shijie&#x27;s nephew, asking Zhang Shijie to surrender on three occasions, to no avail.

In the afternoon of 18 March, Zhang Hongfan prepared for a massive assault. The employment of cannons was turned down because Hongfan felt that cannons could break the chains of the formation too effectively, making it easy for the Song ships to retreat. The next day Zhang Hongfan split his naval forces into four parts: one each for the Song&#x27;s east, north, and south sides, while Hongfan led the remaining portion to about a li away from the Song forces.

First, the north flank engaged the Song forces but were repulsed. The Yuan then began playing festive music, leading the Song to think that the Yuan forces were having a banquet and lowering their guard. At noon Zhang Hongfan attacked from the front, hiding additional soldiers under large pieces of cloth. Once Zhang Hongfan&#x27;s boats neared the Song fleet, the Yuan sounded the horn of battle, revealing the soldiers under the fabric.

The Song troops were prepared for a small skirmish, not a large assault. Waves of arrows hit the Song ships. Caught off guard, the Song fleet immediately lost seven ships, along with a great number of troops in the process. The ill and weakened Song soldiers were no match for the Yuan troops in close combat, and the chaotic environment made battle command impossible. The chained Song ships could neither support the middle nor retreat. After the Song troops were killed, the bloody slaughter of the Song court began. Seeing that the battle was lost, Zhang Shijie picked out his finest soldiers and cut about a dozen ships from the formation in an attempted breakout to save the emperor.

The Yuan forces quickly advanced to the center and to Zhao Bing, killing everyone in their way. There, Prime Minister Lu Xiufu saw no hope of breaking free and, taking the boy emperor with him, jumped into the sea, where both drowned. Many officials and concubines followed suit.

==Aftermath==
The &quot;History of Song&quot; records that, seven days after the battle, thousands of corpses floated to the surface of the sea. Reportedly, the body of the boy emperor was found near today&#x27;s Shekou in Shenzhen, though his actual grave has yet to be found.

Zhang Shijie, having escaped the battle, hoped to have Dowager Yang appoint the next Song emperor, and from there continue to resist the Yuan dynasty. However, after hearing of Emperor Huaizong&#x27;s death, Dowager Yang also committed suicide at sea. Zhang Shijie buried her at the shore. He and his remaining soldiers were assumed to have drowned at sea, as a tropical storm whipped up soon afterwards. However, there have been suggestions that his death was simply Mongolian propaganda, since no remains or trace of his fleet were ever found.

As Zhao Bing was the last Song emperor, his death effectively ended the Song dynasty and the House of Zhao completely lost power over China, leaving the Yuan dynasty, under Kublai Khan, with all of the country under its control. Kublai Khan and his successors and followers would rule China for 97 years until the rise of the Ming dynasty under the Hongwu Emperor, when the Chinese regained control of their lost territory from the Mongols.

Despite Pu Shougeng defecting from the Song to the Yuan, towards the end of the Yuan dynasty, the Yuan Mongols turned against Pu Shougeng&#x27;s family and the Muslims and slaughtered Pu Shougeng&#x27;s descendants in the Ispah rebellion. Mosques and other buildings with foreign architecture were almost all destroyed and the Yuan imperial soldiers killed most of the descendants of Pu Shougeng and horrifically mutilated their corpses.

A rock was carved in memory of Zhang Hongfan there. Many temples were built in the surrounding area in memory of those who lost their lives in the dying years of the Song dynasty, including Wen Tianxiang, Lu Xiufu and Zhang Shijie. In the 1980s, another memorial was built near Shekou to commemorate Zhao Bing. The preparation of a leafy greens soup dish, patriotic soup, has also become a way to memorialize the boy emperor by the Teochew people. Today, a museum complex, the Song-Yuan Yamen Sea Warfare Culture Tourist Zone, lies just to the east of the battle site.

<doc id="80824" wikidata="Q8687" url="?curid=80824" title="Athletic Bilbao">
<text>Athletic Club (; ), commonly known as Athletic Bilbao (), or simply Athletic, is a professional football club based in the city of Bilbao in the Basque Country, Spain. They are known as &quot;Los Leones&quot; (The Lions) because their stadium was built near a church called &quot;San Mamés&quot;, which was named after Saint Mammes, an early Christian thrown to the lions by the Romans. Mammes pacified the lions and was later made a saint. The team plays its home matches at the San Mamés Stadium. Its home colours are red and white striped shirts with black shorts.

Athletic are the fourth most successful club in &quot;La Liga&quot; with eight titles to their name. In the table of titles, Athletic is second only to Barcelona, having won it 24 times. It is also the most successful Basque football club in both league and cup titles won. The club also has one of the most successful women&#x27;s teams in Spain, which has won five championships in the &quot;Primera División Femenina&quot;.

The club is one of three founding members of the &quot;Primera División&quot; that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, the others being Real Madrid and Barcelona. These three clubs, along with Osasuna, are the only four professional clubs in Spain that are not sports corporations; instead they are owned and operated by club members. Athletic&#x27;s main rivals are Real Sociedad, against whom it contests the Basque derby, and Real Madrid, due to sporting and political identity; a minor rivalry also exists with Barcelona due to historical significance. At various points in the club&#x27;s history, further Basque league derbies have been contested against Alavés, Eibar and Osasuna.

The club is known for its &quot;cantera&quot; policy of bringing young Basque players through the ranks, as well as recruiting players from other Basque clubs. Athletic&#x27;s official policy is to sign players native to or trained in football in the greater Basque Country, which includes Biscay, Gipuzkoa, Álava and Navarre (in Spain), as well as Labourd, Soule and Lower Navarre (in France). Since 1911, Athletic has played exclusively with players meeting its own criteria to be deemed Basque. It has gained Athletic both admirers and critics. The club has been praised for promoting home grown players and club loyalty. The rule does not apply to coaching staff, with several examples of non-Basques both from Spain and abroad having coached the first team.

Despite the implications of the name &#x27;Athletic Club&#x27; in English, and unlike some of the other major Spanish teams which have several departments, it is not a multi-sport club, participating only in football, although sections for cycling and other sports existed prior to the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s.

== History ==
=== Bilbao FC, Athletic Club, and Club Bizcaya ===

Football was introduced to Bilbao by two distinct groups with British connections: British workers, and Basque students returning from schools in Britain. In the late 19th century, Bilbao was a leading industrial town, thus becoming the home to a large British colony, mainly made up of migrant workers, including shipyard workers and miners from the northeast of England, such as Southampton, Portsmouth, and Sunderland. Along with coal, they brought with them (as in so many other parts of the world) the game of football. Meanwhile, sons of the Basque educated classes, such as Juan Astorquia, went to Britain to complete their studies, and while there they developed a deep interest in football, so when they returned they began to organize games with British workers at the Hippodrome of Lamiako, which at the time was the home of organized football in Biscay.

In 1898, Juan Astorquia and six other Basque students belonging to the Gymnasium Zamacois began to practice football in Lamiako. Three years later, in 1901, at a meeting held at the &quot;Café García&quot;, this group of football pioneers, now larger, began conversations to become a legalized official football club, which they called &quot;Athletic Club&quot;, using the English spelling. Luis Márquez became the club&#x27;s first president, while Astorquia and Alfred Mills (the club&#x27;s only foreign-born founder) were named the team&#x27;s captain and vice-captain, but in 1902, Astorquia replaced Márquez as president, ruling from 1902 until 1903. Under his presidency, Athletic and their city rivals Bilbao Football Club reached an agreement to combine the best players of both sides to form a team known as &quot;Club Bizcaya&quot;, which was created to compete in the 1902 Copa de la Coronación (forerunner of the Copa del Rey which officially began a year later) held in Madrid; Bizcaya returned to Bilbao with the trophy after beating Joan Gamper&#x27;s FC Barcelona 2–1 in the final. On 24 March 1903, Bilbao FC and its associates were officially and definitively absorbed by Athletic Club. The club itself declares 1898 as its foundation date.

=== Pichichi and Copa del Rey ===

The club featured prominently in early Copas del Rey. Following their triumph at the Copa de la Coronación by &quot;Club Bizcaya&quot;, Athletic won their first Copa del Rey in 1903. After watching the final in the Spanish capital that year, Basque students also formed an affiliated team, &quot;Athletic Club Madrid&quot;, which later evolved into Atlético Madrid. In 1904, holders Athletic were declared winners of the trophy after their opponents failed to turn up. In 1907, they revived the name &quot;Club Vizcaya&quot; after entering a combined team with &quot;La Union&quot; and were beaten in the Copa final. After a brief lull, they won again in 1910, with Luis Astorquia as the new captain and goalkeeper.

In 1911, former team captain Alejandro de la Sota, was elected as the 7th president of the club, and he was the driving force behind the construction of the San Mamés Stadium (architect Manuel María Smith), which opened in 1913 and soon became one of the symbols of Athletic&#x27;s dominance in the 1910s, winning the Copa del Rey three times in a row between 1914 and 1916, with Billy Barnes as coach. Between 1917 and 1919 the club went through a period of institutional crisis and during that time did not participate in the Copa del Rey, having failed to win the regional tournament which acted as the qualifier. In 1920, with the return of Billy Barnes, Athletic once again participated in the national championship and in 1921 won the Copa del Rey again.

The star of this team was Pichichi, a prolific goalscorer who scored the first goal at the San Mamés on 21 August 1913 and a hat-trick in the 1915 final. The last championship won by Pichichi was the 1921 Copa del Rey, before his death aged just 29 in 1922. Today, the La Liga top-scorer is declared the &quot;Pichichi&quot; in his honour.

=== Fred Pentland and the &quot;first historic attack&quot; ===

Along with fellow Basque clubs such as Real Unión, Arenas Club de Getxo and Real Sociedad, Athletic was a founding member of La Liga in 1928 and by 1930 they were joined by CD Alavés; five of the ten clubs in the &quot;Primera División&quot; were from the Basque Country. The saying &quot;Con cantera y afición, no hace falta importación&quot; (en: &quot;With home-grown teams and support, there is no need for import&quot;), made sense during these early days.

In 1922, a new English coach, Fred Pentland, arrived; in 1923, he led the club to victory in the Copa del Rey. He revolutionised the way Athletic played, favouring the short-passing game. In 1927, Pentland left Athletic but returned in 1929 and led the club to La Liga/Copa del Rey doubles in 1930 and 1931. The club won the Copa del Rey four times in a row between 1930 and 1933 and they were also La Liga runners-up in 1932 and 1933. In 1931, Athletic defeated Barcelona 12–1, the latter&#x27;s worst defeat and the biggest win in LaLiga history.

Athletic&#x27;s success under English coaches continued with William Garbutt. His first season in Spain was a massive success as he managed to win the Liga that year. He had inherited a talented squad that included one of the best strikers in the club&#x27;s history, known as &quot;Primera delantera histórica&quot; (en: &quot;First historic attack&quot;), formed by Lafuente, José Iraragorri, Bata (top scorer of LaLiga in 1930–31), Chirri II and Guillermo Gorostiza (top scorer of LaLiga in 1929-30 and 1931–32). Goalkeeper Gregorio Blasco also stood out, who was the most unbeaten goalie in LaLiga on three occasions.

Garbutt promoted the young Ángel Zubieta to the first team, a player who at 17 years of age became the youngest ever to play for the Spanish national team at the time. In the final game of the season, the title was decided when Athletic defeated Oviedo 2–0 at home on 19 April 1936, winning the title two points ahead of Real Madrid. In July 1936, football halted due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. The league did not restart until the 1939–40 season. Athletic Club did not win the title again until 1943 and by that time Garbutt had been exiled.

=== Telmo Zarra and the &quot;second historic attack&quot; ===

In 1941, the club was forced to change its name to Atlético Bilbao, following a decree issued by Franco, who also changed the name of the Copa del Rey to Copa del Generalísimo, in reference to his own figure.

After the civil war, the club had to rebuild the team almost from scratch, as only seven players from the team before the conflict remained: some who had shown themselves in favour of Basque nationalism or the Spanish republic went into exile in Latin America, and others were rejected for fear of reprisals. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Athletic focused on the young promises of the Basque teams to rebuild the team. In this way, it managed to create a competitive team that quickly became champions.

During the 1940s and early 1950s, the club featured the legendary forward line formed by Rafa Iriondo, Francisco Gárate, Telmo Zarra, José Luis Panizo and Agustín Gaínza, which was nicknamed &quot;Segunda delantera histórica&quot; (en: &quot;Second historic attack&quot;); midfielder Nando González and goalkeeper Raimundo Lezama (most unbeaten goalie in LaLiga on 1946-47) also stood out from this team. This squad, coached by Juan Urkizu, won a double in 1943 and retained Copa del Generalísimo in both 1944 and 1945. Years later, Venancio Pérez replaced Garate in the forward line and José Iraragorri took over the bench. They helped the club win another Copa del Generalísimo and a Copa Eva Duarte (the official precedent of the Supercopa de España) in 1950.

The big star of this team was Telmo Zarra, who became one of the club&#x27;s great legends and the top scorer in its history with 335 goals. He won six Pichichi Trophies for being the top scorer in LaLiga (a record only surpassed by Messi in 2020), and his 38 goals in the 1950–51 season stood as a record for 60 years. He was also the top scorer in LaLiga history since 1950 with 251 goals until in 2014 he was surpassed by Lionel Messi and later by Cristiano Ronaldo (however, he is still the top Spanish scorer in the championship). In 1997, the King of Spain Juan Carlos I awarded him the gold medal to Royal Order of Sports Merit.

=== The team of &quot;eleven villagers&quot; ===

In 1954, coach Ferdinand Daučík retired the team of &quot;second historic attack&quot; and gave way to a new generation of players. Daučík managed to form a new champion team that won the double in 1956 and two other victories in the Copa del Generalísimo in 1955 and 1958. The latter is remembered as one of the club&#x27;s most important achievements because Athletic managed to beat Di Stefano&#x27;s Real Madrid, which had just won the European Cup and LaLiga, and the Spanish federation also ignored Athletic&#x27;s request to play in a neutral field and forced the final to be played in Chamartin (Real Madrid stadium). However, the Bilbao team won the match 2–0 with goals from Arieta and Mauri, and lifted the Cup in Chamartin Stadium. From that moment on, this was remembered as &quot;el equipo de los once aldeanos&quot; (en: &quot;the team of eleven villagers&quot;), since club president Enrique Guzmán shouted during the title celebration: &quot;With eleven villagers, we have beaten them!&quot;, in allusion to the club&#x27;s tradition of playing only with players from its homeland. The classic team lineup was: Carmelo; Orue, Garay, Canito; Mauri, Maguregui, Marcaida; Arteche, Arieta (whom they considered Zarra&#x27;s successor), Uribe and Gaínza. Thanks to their league title triumph, the team represented Spain in the 1956 Latin Cup, where they reached the final and lost to AC Milan by a score of 3–1.

In the same year the club also made their debut in the European Cup, where they reached the quarterfinals after eliminating FC Porto and Ferenc Puskás&#x27;s Honvéd FC. They then beat Manchester United Busby Babes 5–3 at San Mamés Stadium, but were defeated 3–0 at Old Trafford, in a match in which goalkeeper Carmelo had to play almost the entire match injured because substitutions did not exist at that time.

=== Iribar and the first UEFA final ===

The 1960s were dominated by Real Madrid, and Atlético went through a few years of transition in which the only figure that shone was goalkeeper José Ángel Iribar, who became one of the club&#x27;s greatest legends along with Zarra. Due to the team&#x27;s bad form, the fans used to constantly repeat the phrase &quot;Juegan Iribar y diez más&quot; (en: &quot;Iribar and ten more are playing&quot;). The situation improved when in 1969 Atlético won a Copa del Generalísimo and was runner-up in LaLiga in the 1969–70 season. The main stars of this team −in addition to Iribar− were the scorer Fidel Uriarte (winner of a Pichichi Trophy) and the winger Txetxu Rojo.

The 1970s were not much better, with only another single Copa del Generalísimo win in 1973. In December 1976, before a game against Real Sociedad, Iribar and Sociedad captain Inaxio Kortabarria carried out the Ikurriña (the Basque nationalist flag), and placed it ceremonially on the centre-circle – this was the first public display of the flag since the death of Francisco Franco. By then the Franco regime had also ended and the club reverted to using the name &quot;Athletic&quot;. In 1977, the club reached the final of the UEFA Cup after eliminating teams like AC Milan or FC Barcelona, among others, and only losing on away goals to Juventus. They also reached the Copa del Rey final, which they lost to Real Betis on penalties (Iribar missed the decisive one, which gave the Sevillians the victory), and reached third position in LaLiga. Despite these defeats, this is remembered as one of the best teams in the history of Athletic Bilbao, which included historical players of the club such as Iribar, Rojo, Guisasola, Alexanko, Goikoetxea, Irureta, Dani or Carlos (last player to win the Pichichi Trophy with the club).

=== La Liga and Copa del Rey winners with Clemente ===

In 1981, Javier Clemente became manager. He put together one of the most successful teams in the club&#x27;s history, the main lineup of this team was: Zubizarreta; Urkiaga, Goikoetxea, &quot;Rocky&quot; Liceranzu, De la Fuente; De Andrés, Sola, Urtubi; Dani, Sarabia and Argote. In 1982–83 season, Athletic became LaLiga champion after surpassing Santillana&#x27;s Real Madrid in the standings on the last round. The following year they won a LaLiga and Copa del Rey double. In that cup final they beat Maradona&#x27;s FC Barcelona 1–0; the Argentine player did not take the defeat well and attacked an Athletic player, which caused a brawl between both teams. Months earlier, Goikoetxea had injured Maradona after a hard tackle from behind, from which it took him several weeks to recover, and the Bilbao native was sanctioned with 17 games without playing (although the match referee did not show him any card for this fact).

In 1985 and 1986, Athletic finished third and fourth respectively. During the 1985–86 season, Clemente was fired due to a bad relationship with the team&#x27;s star, Sarabia. A succession of coaches that included José Ángel Iribar, Howard Kendall, Jupp Heynckes and Javier Irureta and even a returning Clemente failed to reproduce his success.

=== The Fernández era ===
In 1998, coach Luis Fernández led the club to second in La Liga and UEFA Champions League qualification. Fernández benefited from the club adopting a more flexible approach to the &quot;cantera&quot;. In 1995, Athletic had signed Joseba Etxeberria from regional rivals Real Sociedad, causing considerable bad feelings between the two clubs. Etxeberria was a prominent member of the 1997–98 squad, along with Ismael Urzaiz and Julen Guerrero.

=== 21st century ===

The club narrowly avoided relegation during the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons, the latter being the worst in the club&#x27;s history. In the Copa del Rey, they reached their first final in 24 years, losing 4–1 to Barcelona.

Prior to the 2011–12 season, Athletic&#x27;s new president, former player Josu Urrutia, brought in coach Marcelo Bielsa; Athletic advanced to their first European final since 1977, losing 3–0 to Spanish rivals Atlético Madrid on 9 May in the 2012 UEFA Europa League Final at the Arena Națională in Bucharest. They also reached the 2012 Copa del Rey Final, losing again to Barcelona.

After star midfielder Javi Martínez moved to FC Bayern Munich, Athletic were eliminated from the 2012–13 Europa League group stage, and were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Basque club Eibar of the third tier. Relegation was a threat until the end of the season, and the final league game at the &quot;old&quot; San Mamés ended in defeat. Athletic would soon move to a new stadium, albeit in a partially completed state. Bielsa promoted young defender Aymeric Laporte into the side, while striker Fernando Llorente completed a free transfer to Juventus.
After Bielsa, Ernesto Valverde returned for a second spell as manager, and he signed or brought through several new players as Athletic came fourth in the league, meaning a UEFA Champions League campaign. Ander Herrera transferred to Manchester United for €36 million deal at the end of the season.

Athletic had a triumphant first full-capacity match in the new San Mamés as they defeated Napoli to qualify for the Champions League group stage, however they could only finish 3rd in the group. Athletic reached the 2015 Copa del Rey Final, but once again lost to Barcelona, 3–1.

In the first leg of the 2015 Supercopa de España at San Mamés, Athletic defeated Barcelona 4–0, with Aritz Aduriz scoring a hat-trick. In the return leg at Camp Nou, Athletic hung on with a 1–1 draw to win their first trophy since 1984. Aduriz finished with 36 goals in all competitions. Athletic advanced to the quarter-finals in the Europa League where they were only defeated on penalties by the holders and eventual repeat winners Sevilla FC.

Valverde left his position at the end of the 2016–17 season after four years. It was confirmed that his successor would be former player José Ángel Ziganda, moving up from Bilbao Athletic. On 29 November the club suffered a shock defeat to SD Formentera in the domestic cup. At the conclusion of a poor season overall, Ziganda was dismissed and Eduardo Berizzo was appointed. However, his spell was even less fruitful and in December 2018, having won just two of his fifteen matches at the helm and with the team in the relegation zone, Berizzo was dismissed. B-team coach Gaizka Garitano took over and oversaw an improvement in results, with the club moving well out of danger and narrowly missing out on a Europa League spot on the last day.
The beginning of the 2019–20 season saw more consistent results. After the first five games of the season, the &quot;Lions&quot; sat at the top of the table, their best start in 26 years. That form could not be maintained, and by the halfway point they had slipped to mid-table after several draws. However, in the Copa del Rey, they survived two penalty shootouts against second-tier opponents and then defeated Barcelona to reach the semi-finals. The club then defeated Granada CF in the semi-final on away goals to meet local rivals Real Sociedad in the final – which was then postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, both clubs happy to delay in the hope of supporters being able to attend the historic Basque derby occasion. This did not come to pass, and the final was eventually played in an empty stadium on 3 April 2021, Real Sociedad emerging winners by a 1–0 scoreline. By that time, Aduriz had finally retired from playing, Garitano had been replaced as coach by Marcelino, and the 2020–21 Supercopa de España originally intended to follow the delayed cup final was contested, Athletic defeating Real Madrid then Barcelona to claim the trophy. They also defeated Levante in the semi-final of the 2020–21 Copa del Rey to reach the final on 17 April 2021, making them the only team to take part in the showpiece event twice in as many weeks; however, Athletic lost that final as well, to Barcelona by a 4–0 scoreline. In October 2021, a report from the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) showed that Athletic Bilbao and Desna Chernihiv (Ukraine) were the only teams in European continental competitions without foreign players.They ended the season on 10th place.

The next two seasons saw the same results, narrowly missing out on the Europa Conference League by finishing in 8th and consecutive Copa del Rey Semi final exits although they did finish as Supercopa de Espanã Runners-up in the 2021–22 season, defeating Atlético Madrid and losing to Real Madrid.
In the 2023–24 season however, saw Athletic Bilbao end their 40-year Copa del Rey drought by winning the 2023-24 Copa del Rey against RCD Mallorca 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw in normal time and extra time.
The campaign included some memorable victories, including a 4–2 win against Barcelona at home and a 4–0 aggregate win over Atlético Madrid.

==Crest==
Athletic&#x27;s shield has incorporated the escutcheons of Bilbao and Biscay. From the shield of Bilbao, it takes the bridge and the church of San Anton, and the wolves from the powerful Haro family, who were lords of Biscay and founders of Bilbao in 1300. From the shield of Biscay, it takes the Gernikako Arbola (Guernica&#x27;s tree) and the cross of Saint Andrew (saltires). Its first documented use dates from 1922.

The first official club crest was a blue circle surrounded by a belt with the letters A and C in the centre in white (as the club colours were at that point). The second was from 1910, consisting of a red-and-white flag (newly adopted as the shirt colours) with a red square in the top left corner, containing the initials of the club in white. The third, from 1913, involved the same flag, but in this case shown on a pole wrapped around a football (this is very similar to the Real Sociedad crest still in use today, ignoring the crown of royal patronage).

The first version of the current crest, roughly an inverted triangular shield shape with a section of red-and-white stripes and a section of local motifs, is from 1922; this was a really simple version which was adapted several times, some of which closely resembled the crest of Atlético Madrid, originally a branch of the Bilbao club. Finally, in 1941 the first version of the current shield was created, but the name &quot;Atlético Bilbao&quot; was used when General Francisco Franco outlawed all non-Spanish names during his regime. In 1972, the club added full colour to the design and recovered the original English &quot;Athletic Club&quot; name. In 2008, the shape of the shield was slightly altered and a new &quot;Athletic Club&quot; typeface was introduced.

== Club colours ==

Athletic began playing in an improvised white kit, but in the 1902–03 season, the club&#x27;s first official strip became half-blue, half-white shirts similar to those worn by Blackburn Rovers, which were donated by Juan Moser. Later, a young student from Bilbao named Juan Elorduy, who was spending Christmas 1909 in London, was charged by the club to buy 25 new shirts, but was unable to find enough. Waiting for the ship back to Bilbao and empty handed, Elorduy realised that the colours of the local team Southampton matched the colours of the City of Bilbao, and bought 50 shirts to take with him. Upon arriving in Bilbao, the club&#x27;s directors decided almost immediately to change the team&#x27;s strip to the new colours, and since 1910, Athletic Club have played in red and white stripes. Of the 50 shirts bought by Elorduy, half were then sent to Atlético Madrid, where Elorduy was a committee member and a former player; it had originally begun as a youth branch of Athletic Bilbao. Before the switch, only one other team in Spain wore red and white: Sporting de Gijón, since 1905. Change colours have often been blue and/or white, or black. In 2011, Athletic released a green, white and red away kit inspired by the Basque flag (this was worn against Atlético Madrid in the 2012 UEFA Europa League final).

Between 2001 and 2009 Athletic also manufactured their own playing kit, under the brand &quot;100% Athletic&quot; and utilising the small design from their centenary celebrations as a manufacturer&#x27;s logo.

Athletic were one of the last major clubs which did not have the logo of an official sponsor emblazoned on their kit. In the UEFA Cup and the Copa del Rey of 2004–05, the shirt sported the word &quot;Euskadi&quot; in green with sponsorship from the Basque Government. This policy was changed in 2008, when Athletic made a deal with the Biscay-based Petronor oil company to wear their logo in exchange for over €2 million. The Kutxabank logo now adorns the front of Athletic&#x27;s kits.

== Lezama facilities ==

The Lezama Facilities is the complex where all of the categories of Athletic train. It was opened in the 1971–72 season, under the presidency of Felix Oráa. At present, facilities include, &quot;inter alia&quot;, five natural grass fields, a gymnasium, a pediment, a medical center and a residence for young players. Lezama has undergone remodeling since 1995 under the presidency of José María Arrate with the construction of new roads and parking entry and exit able to absorb the large number of vehicles that come every day, and a platform cover bringing greater convenience to fans attending the matches of the youth teams and other youth football teams.

These facilities are located in the municipality of Lezama, approximately ten miles from Bilbao.

=== Future ===
The Board has given the green light to the so-called &quot;Lezama Master Plan&quot;, which was founded with the purpose of modernizing the structures of both the youth teams and first team. The &quot;Plan&quot; is the result of a rigorous study of the basic needs for the future of the Athletic Club. The work will take place over the course of two to three years and its budget is around €12 million. The club is committed to consolidate its cantera structure, which is the basis for the future of the club and in this regard Lezama will be expanded to classrooms for youth work in the lower categories and create an audiovisual department.

== Club rivalries ==

=== Real Sociedad ===

Athletic Club&#x27;s main historical rival is Real Sociedad, a neighboring club against which it plays the classic Basque derby. Both teams have maintained a great rivalry since their beginnings, and although Athletic had a notably superior trajectory for many decades, since the 1980s the differences between both clubs have equalized significantly and, at the same time, the rivalry has increased.

=== Real Madrid and Barcelona ===

Against Real Madrid and Barcelona, Athletic has competed for many league and cup titles throughout its history. Athletic has recorded the most victories against both opponents (79 wins over Barcelona and 76 over Madrid, as of 2024), ahead of the likes of Atlético Madrid, Valencia, Sevilla and Real Sociedad.

=== Osasuna ===

Athletic also maintains a significant rivalry with Osasuna, and there has been continuous friction between the clubs in recent years.

<doc id="80825" wikidata="Q140028" url="?curid=80825" title="Free fall">
<text>In classical mechanics, free fall is any motion of a body where gravity is the only force acting upon it.
A freely falling object may not necessarily be falling down in the vertical direction. If the common definition of the word &quot;fall&quot; is used, an object moving upwards is not considered to be falling, but using scientific definitions, if it is subject to only the force of gravity, it is said to be in free fall. The Moon is thus in free fall around the Earth, though its orbital speed keeps it in very far orbit from the Earth&#x27;s surface.

In a roughly uniform gravitational field gravity acts on each part of a body approximately equally. When there are no other forces, such as the normal force exerted between a body (e.g. an astronaut in orbit) and its surrounding objects, it will result in the sensation of weightlessness, a condition that also occurs when the gravitational field is weak (such as when far away from any source of gravity).

The term &quot;free fall&quot; is often used more loosely than in the strict sense defined above. Thus, falling through an atmosphere without a deployed parachute, or lifting device, is also often referred to as &quot;free fall&quot;. The aerodynamic drag forces in such situations prevent them from producing full weightlessness, and thus a skydiver&#x27;s &quot;free fall&quot; after reaching terminal velocity produces the sensation of the body&#x27;s weight being supported on a cushion of air.

In the context of general relativity, where gravitation is reduced to a space-time curvature, a body in free fall has no force acting on it.

==History==
In the Western world prior to the 16th century, it was generally assumed that the speed of a falling body would be proportional to its weight—that is, a 10 kg object was expected to fall ten times faster than an otherwise identical 1 kg object through the same medium. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC) discussed falling objects in &quot;Physics&quot; (Book VII), one of the oldest books on mechanics (see Aristotelian physics). Although, in the 6th century, John Philoponus challenged this argument and said that, by observation, two balls of very different weights will fall at nearly the same speed.

In 12th-century Iraq, Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī gave an explanation for the gravitational acceleration of falling bodies. According to Shlomo Pines, al-Baghdādī&#x27;s theory of motion was &quot;the oldest negation of Aristotle&#x27;s fundamental dynamic law [namely, that a constant force produces a uniform motion], [and is thus an] anticipation in a vague fashion of the fundamental law of classical mechanics [namely, that a force applied continuously produces acceleration].&quot;

=== Galileo Galilei ===

According to a tale that may be apocryphal, in 1589–1592 Galileo dropped two objects of unequal mass from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Given the speed at which such a fall would occur, it is doubtful that Galileo could have extracted much information from this experiment. Most of his observations of falling bodies were really of bodies rolling down ramps. This slowed things down enough to the point where he was able to measure the time intervals with water clocks and his own pulse (stopwatches having not yet been invented). He repeated this &quot;a full hundred times&quot; until he had achieved &quot;an accuracy such that the deviation between two observations never exceeded one-tenth of a pulse beat.&quot; In 1589–1592, Galileo wrote &quot;De Motu Antiquiora&quot;, an unpublished manuscript on the motion of falling bodies.

==Examples==
Examples of objects in free fall include:
* A spacecraft (in space) with propulsion off (e.g. in a continuous orbit, or on a suborbital trajectory (ballistics) going up for some minutes, and then down).
* An object dropped at the top of a drop tube.
* An object thrown upward or a person jumping off the ground at low speed (i.e. as long as air resistance is negligible in comparison to weight).
Technically, an object is in free fall even when moving upwards or instantaneously at rest at the top of its motion. If gravity is the only influence acting, then the acceleration is always downward and has the same magnitude for all bodies, commonly denoted formula_1.

Since all objects fall at the same rate in the absence of other forces, objects and people will experience weightlessness in these situations.

Examples of objects not in free-fall:
* Flying in an aircraft: there is also an additional force of lift.
* Standing on the ground: the gravitational force is counteracted by the normal force from the ground.
* Descending to the Earth using a parachute, which balances the force of gravity with an aerodynamic drag force (and with some parachutes, an additional lift force).

The example of a falling skydiver who has not yet deployed a parachute is not considered free fall from a physics perspective, since they experience a drag force that equals their weight once they have achieved terminal velocity (see below).

Near the surface of the Earth, an object in free fall in a vacuum will accelerate at approximately 9.8 m/s2, independent of its mass. With air resistance acting on an object that has been dropped, the object will eventually reach a terminal velocity, which is around 53 m/s (190 km/h or 118 mph) for a human skydiver. The terminal velocity depends on many factors including mass, drag coefficient, and relative surface area and will only be achieved if the fall is from sufficient altitude. A typical skydiver in a spread-eagle position will reach terminal velocity after about 12 seconds, during which time they will have fallen around 450 m (1,500 ft).

Free fall was demonstrated on the Moon by astronaut David Scott on August 2, 1971. He simultaneously released a hammer and a feather from the same height above the Moon&#x27;s surface. The hammer and the feather both fell at the same rate and hit the surface at the same time. This demonstrated Galileo&#x27;s discovery that, in the absence of air resistance, all objects experience the same acceleration due to gravity. On the Moon, however, the gravitational acceleration is approximately 1.63 m/s2, or only about 1⁄6 that on Earth.

==Free fall in Newtonian mechanics==
=== Uniform gravitational field without air resistance ===
This is the &quot;textbook&quot; case of the vertical motion of an object falling a small distance close to the surface of a planet. It is a good approximation in air as long as the force of gravity on the object is much greater than the force of air resistance, or equivalently the object&#x27;s velocity is always much less than the terminal velocity (see below).
:formula_2

:formula_3

where
:formula_4 is the initial vertical component of the velocity (m/s).
:formula_5 is the vertical component of the velocity at formula_6(m/s).
:formula_7 is the initial altitude (m).
:formula_8 is the altitude at formula_6(m).
:formula_6 is time elapsed (s).
:formula_11 is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s2 near the surface of the earth).
If the initial velocity is zero, then the distance fallen from the initial position will grow as the square of the elapsed time. Moreover, because the odd numbers sum to the perfect squares, the distance fallen in successive time intervals grows as the odd numbers. This description of the behavior of falling bodies was given by Galileo.

=== Uniform gravitational field with air resistance ===
This case, which applies to skydivers, parachutists or any body of mass, formula_12, and cross-sectional area, formula_13, with Reynolds number well above the critical Reynolds number, so that the air resistance is proportional to the square of the fall velocity, formula_14, has an equation of motion
:formula_15
where formula_16 is the air density and formula_17 is the drag coefficient, assumed to be constant although in general it will depend on the Reynolds number.

Assuming an object falling from rest and no change in air density with altitude, the solution is:
: formula_18

where the terminal speed is given by
:formula_19

The object&#x27;s speed versus time can be integrated over time to find the vertical position as a function of time:

:formula_20

Using the figure of 56 m/s for the terminal velocity of a human, one finds that after 10 seconds he will have fallen 348 metres and attained 94% of terminal velocity, and after 12 seconds he will have fallen 455 metres and will have attained 97% of terminal velocity. However, when the air density cannot be assumed to be constant, such as for objects falling from high altitude, the equation of motion becomes much more difficult to solve analytically and a numerical simulation of the motion is usually necessary. The figure shows the forces acting on meteoroids falling through the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere. HALO jumps, including Joe Kittinger&#x27;s and Felix Baumgartner&#x27;s record jumps, also belong in this category.

=== Inverse-square law gravitational field ===
It can be said that two objects in space orbiting each other in the absence of other forces are in free fall around each other, e.g. that the Moon or an artificial satellite &quot;falls around&quot; the Earth, or a planet &quot;falls around&quot; the Sun. Assuming spherical objects means that the equation of motion is governed by Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation, with solutions to the gravitational two-body problem being elliptic orbits obeying Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion. This connection between falling objects close to the Earth and orbiting objects is best illustrated by the thought experiment, Newton&#x27;s cannonball.

The motion of two objects moving radially towards each other with no angular momentum can be considered a special case of an elliptical orbit of eccentricity (radial elliptic trajectory). This allows one to compute the free-fall time for two point objects on a radial path. The solution of this equation of motion yields time as a function of separation:
:formula_21

where
:formula_22 is the time after the start of the fall
:formula_23 is the distance between the centers of the bodies
:formula_24 is the initial value of formula_23
:formula_26 is the standard gravitational parameter.

Substituting formula_27 we get the free-fall time

:formula_28

The separation can be expressed explicitly as a function of time 

:formula_29

where formula_30 is the quantile function of the Beta distribution, also known as the inverse function of the regularized incomplete beta function formula_31.

This solution can also be represented exactly by the analytic power series

:formula_32

Evaluating this yields:
:formula_33
where

formula_34

==In general relativity==
In general relativity, an object in free fall is subject to no force and is an inertial body moving along a geodesic. Far away from any sources of space-time curvature, where spacetime is flat, the Newtonian theory of free fall agrees with general relativity. Otherwise the two disagree; e.g., only general relativity can account for the precession of orbits, the orbital decay or inspiral of compact binaries due to gravitational waves, and the relativity of direction (geodetic precession and frame dragging).

The experimental observation that all objects in free fall accelerate at the same rate, as noted by Galileo and then embodied in Newton&#x27;s theory as the equality of gravitational and inertial masses, and later confirmed to high accuracy by modern forms of the Eötvös experiment, is the basis of the equivalence principle, from which basis Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity initially took off.

<doc id="80830" wikidata="Q188653" url="?curid=80830" title="Ahmed Yassin">
<text>Sheikh Ahmed Ismail Hassan Yassin (; June 1936 – 22 March 2004) was a Palestinian politician and imam who founded Hamas in 1987. He also served as the first chairman of the Hamas Shura Council and de facto leader of Hamas since its inception from December 1987 until his assassination in March 2004. 

Yassin was born in Ashkelon, in Mandatory Palestine in 1929 or 1936. His family fled or were expelled during the 1948 Palestine War to Gaza City. Yassin, a quadriplegic who was nearly blind, had been reliant on a wheelchair due to a sporting accident at the age of 12.

After its founding, he served as the spiritual leader of Hamas, a Sunni Islamist group. The Israeli government held him responsible for the killing of several Israeli civilians. In 2004, he was killed when an Israeli helicopter gunship fired a missile at him as he was being wheeled from Fajr prayer in Gaza City. The attack, which also killed both of his bodyguards and nine bystanders, was internationally condemned. His funeral procession was attended by 200,000 people in Gaza.

==Early life and education==
Ahmed Yassin was born in al-Jura, a small village near the city of Ashkelon, in the Mandatory Palestine. His date of birth is not known for certain: according to his Palestinian passport, he was born on 1 January 1929, but he claimed to have actually been born in the summer of 1936. His father, Abdullah Yassin, died when he was three years old. Afterward, he became known in his neighborhood as Ahmad Sa&#x27;ada after his mother Sa&#x27;ada al-Habeel. This was to differentiate him from the children of his father&#x27;s other three wives. Together, Yassin had four brothers and two sisters. He and his entire family fled to Gaza, settling in al-Shati Camp after his village was ethnically cleansed by the Israel Defense Forces during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

Yassin came to Gaza as a refugee. When he was 16, he sustained a severe spinal injury while wrestling his friend Abdullah al-Khatib. His neck was kept in plaster for 45 days. The damage to his spinal cord rendered him a quadraplegic for the rest of his life. Fearing a rift between his family and al-Khatib&#x27;s, Yassin initially told his family that he sustained his injuries while playing leapfrog during a sports lesson with his school friends on the beach.

Although Yassin applied to and attended Al-Azhar University in Cairo, he was unable to pursue his studies there due to his deteriorating health. He was forced to be educated at home where he read widely, particularly on philosophy and on religion, politics, sociology, and economics. His followers believe that his worldly knowledge made him &quot;one of the best speakers in the Gaza Strip&quot;. During this time, he began delivering weekly sermons after Friday prayers, drawing large crowds of people.

After years of unemployment, he got a post as an Arabic language teacher at an elementary school in Rimal, Gaza. Headmaster Mohammad al-Shawa initially had reservations about Yassin, concerning the reception he would receive from the pupils due to his disability. However, according to al-Shawa, Yassin handled them well and his popularity grew, especially among the more scholarly children. His teaching methods reportedly provoked mixed reactions among parents because he encouraged his students to attend the mosque an additional two times a week. Having a regular job gave Yassin financial stability, and he married one of his relatives Halima Yassin in 1960 at the age of 22. The couple had eleven children.

==Involvement in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict==

Yassin was actively involved in setting up a Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. In 1973, the Islamic charity Mujama al-Islamiya was established in Gaza by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and the organization was recognized by Israel in 1979. In 1984 he and others were jailed for secretly stockpiling weapons, but in 1985 he was released as part of the Jibril Agreement. In 1987, during the First Intifada, Yassin co-founded Hamas with Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, originally calling it the &quot;paramilitary wing&quot; of the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood, and becoming its spiritual leader.

In 1989, Yassin was arrested by Israel and sentenced to life imprisonment for ordering killings of alleged Palestinian collaborators. In 1997, Yassin was released from Israeli prison as part of an arrangement with Jordan following a failed assassination attempt of Hamas leader Khaled Mashal by the Israeli Mossad in Jordan. Yassin was released in exchange for two Mossad agents who had been arrested by Jordanian authorities, on the condition that he refrained from continuing to call for suicide bombings against Israel. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported about his poor health at the time: &quot;Sheik Ahmad Yassin, spiritual leader of Hamas, back home in Gaza after his release by Israel, is so frail he drinks only with help.&quot;

Following his release, Yassin resumed his leadership of Hamas. He immediately repeated his calls for attacks on Israel, using tactics including suicide bombings, thus violating the condition of his release. He also sought to maintain relations with the Palestinian Authority, believing that a clash between the two groups would be harmful to the interests of the Palestinian people. Yassin was intermittently placed under house arrest by the Authority. Each time he was eventually released, often after extended demonstrations by his supporters. Yassin criticized the outcome of the 2003 Aqaba summit. His group initially declared a temporary truce with Israel. However, in July 2003, the truce unravelled after a Hamas suicide bombing of a Jerusalem bus killed 21 people the previous month. Israeli forces killed two Hamas members in retaliation.

On 6 September 2003, an Israeli Air Force (IAF) F-16 fired several missiles on a building in Gaza City in the Gaza Strip. Yassin was in the building at the time but survived. Israeli officials later confirmed that Yassin was the target of the attack. His injuries were treated at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. Yassin responded to the media that &quot;Days will prove that the assassination policy will not finish the Hamas. Hamas leaders wish to be martyrs and are not scared of death. Jihad will continue and the resistance will continue until we have victory, or we will be martyrs.&quot;

Yassin further promised that Hamas would teach Israel an &quot;unforgettable lesson&quot; as a result of the assassination attempt. Yassin made no attempt to guard himself from further attempts on his life or hide his location. Journalists sometimes visited his Gaza address and Yassin maintained a routine daily pattern of activity, including being wheeled every morning to a nearby mosque.

Reem Riyashi&#x27;s suicide bombing at the Erez crossing on 14 January 2004, which killed four civilians, was believed by the Israeli military to have been directly ordered by Yassin. Yassin suggested that the suicide bomber was fulfilling her &quot;obligation&quot; to make jihad, and Israel&#x27;s Deputy Defence Minister responded by publicly declaring that Yassin was &quot;marked for death&quot;. Yassin denied any involvement in the attack.

==Views==
===Involvement in attacks on Israel===

Yassin was a founder and leader of Hamas, which is regarded as a terrorist organization by Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Paraguay, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon characterized Yassin as the &quot;mastermind of Palestinian terror&quot; and a &quot;mass murderer&quot;. The Israeli government repeatedly asserted that Yassin was responsible for a number of terrorist attacks, which targeted and killed civilians.

In 1997, Yassin proposed a halt of attacks on Israel, if Israel withdrew from the West Bank and Gaza.

In his statement Yassin declared that Hamas did target Israeli civilians, but only in direct retaliation for the death of Palestinian civilians. In his thinking this was a necessary tactic to &quot;show the Israelis they could not get away without a price for killing our people.&quot; In June 2003, after visiting al-Rantisi in hospital after a failed Israeli missile attack against him, Yassin told reporters: &quot;Israel is targeting Palestinian civilians, so Israeli civilians should be targeted. From now on, all Israeli people are targets.&quot; &quot;We got Israel&#x27;s message. They should now expect the answer.&quot;

=== Views on Jews ===
In an interview, likely recorded in the 1990s, Ahmed Yassin stated his view on Jews:

In a 1997 speech, Yassin said:
=== Views on the peace process ===
Yassin&#x27;s views on the peace process between the Palestinians and the Israelis were ambiguous. He supported armed resistance against Israel and asserted that Palestine is an Islamic land &quot;consecrated for future Muslim generations until Judgment Day&quot; and that no Arab leader had the right to give up any part of this territory. Concerning that territorial conflict, Yassin&#x27;s rhetoric did not distinguish between Israelis and Jews, at one point stating that &quot;reconciliation with the Jews is a crime.&quot; However, he regarded as his religious cousins, and stating his conflict with them is purely over land he deemed stolen territory. 

Yassin&#x27;s rhetoric was often scrutinized in the news media. On one occasion, he opined that Israel &quot;must disappear from the map.&quot; Yassin&#x27;s declaration that &quot;We chose this road, and will end with martyrdom or victory&quot; later became a repeated mantra among Palestinians.

Yassin on several occasions proposed long-term ceasefire agreements, or truces, so called &quot;Hudnas&quot;, in exchange for Israeli concessions. All such offers were rejected by Israel. Following his release from Israeli prison in 1997, he proposed a ten-year truce in exchange for total Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza and a stop to Israeli attacks on civilians. In 1999, in an interview with an Egyptian newspaper, he again offered a truce:
It was shortly after once such truce offer, in January 2004, that Yassin was assassinated. 

==Assassination==

Yassin was killed in an Israeli attack on 22 March 2004. While he was being wheeled out of an early morning prayer session in Gaza City, an Israeli AH-64 Apache helicopter gunship fired Hellfire missiles at Yassin and both of his bodyguards. Before the attack, Israeli F-16 jets flew overhead to obscure the noise of the approaching helicopters. Yassin always used the same direction every morning to go to the same mosque in the Sabra district that is from his home.

Yassin and his bodyguards were killed instantly, along with nine bystanders. Another 12 people were injured in the operation, including two of Yassin&#x27;s sons. Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, Yassin&#x27;s deputy, became the Hamas leader after his assassination, but was also killed shortly thereafter.

==Reaction to assassination==
Kofi Annan, UN Secretary General, condemned the killing. The UN Commission on Human Rights passed a resolution condemning the killing supported by votes from 31 countries including the People&#x27;s Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Russia, and South Africa, with 2 votes against and 18 abstentions. The Arab League council also expressed condemnation, as did the African Union.

A draft resolution condemning the extrajudicial execution of Yassin and six other Palestinians, as well as all terrorist attacks against civilians was brought before the United Nations Security Council and vetoed by the United States, with United Kingdom, Germany, and Romania abstaining. The United States explained that the draft resolution should have condemned Hamas explicitly following its sponsored suicide bombings in Ashdod the week before.

===Palestinian===
The Palestinian Authority declared three days of mourning and closed Palestinian schools. Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh suggested, &quot;This is the moment Sheikh Yassin dreamed about&quot;. The Hamas leadership said Ariel Sharon had &quot;opened the gates of hell&quot;. Hamas called for retaliation against Israel. About 200,000 people took to the streets of the Gaza Strip for Yassin&#x27;s funeral as Israeli forces declared a national alert.

The assassination of Yassin also led to the fact that Hamas, for the first time, was named as the most popular movement in Palestine by the residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip two weeks after the assassination.

Abdel Aziz Rantisi was announced as the new head of Hamas. At a memorial service for Sheik Yassin, he declared that &quot;The Israelis will not know security... We will fight them until the liberation of Palestine, the whole of Palestine.&quot; Publicly addressing the &quot;military wing&quot; of Hamas, Rantisi suggested, &quot;The door is open for you to strike all places, all the time and using all means.&quot; Rantisi was himself killed by Israel on 17 April 2004 in an assassination almost identical to that of Yassin. He was killed by three rockets fired from a gunship by the Israeli military.

On 31 August 2004, at least 15 Israeli people were killed and 80 injured in a suicide attack against two Israeli buses in Beersheba. Hamas stated the attack was a revenge for the assassination of Rantisi and Yassin. Following the bombing, an estimated 20,000 Hamas supporters in Gaza took to Gaza&#x27;s streets, celebrating the successful attack.

===Israeli===

The Israeli government said the targeted killing was in response to dozens of suicide attacks by Hamas against Israeli civilians. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs defended the assassination of Yassin:

Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli Defense Minister, branded Yassin &quot;the Palestinian Bin Laden&quot; and said, &quot;If we have to balance how many more terrorists Yassin would have sent, how many terror attacks he would have approved, if we weigh this on the scales, we acted rightly&quot;.

Avraham Poraz, Israel&#x27;s Interior Minister and member of the centrist Shinui Party, said he believed the assassination of Yassin &quot;was a bad idea because I am afraid of a revenge coming from the Palestinian side, from the Hamas side.&quot; Shimon Peres, then leader of the Labour opposition, was critical of the assassination, suggesting that it &quot;could lead to an escalation of terror&quot;.

===Middle East===
King Abdullah II of Jordan described the assassination as a &quot;crime&quot;; Lebanon&#x27;s president Émile Lahoud vehemently denounced the Israeli act as &quot;...a crime [which] will not succeed in liquidating the Palestinian cause&quot;; Emir of Kuwait Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah said: &quot;Violence will increase now because violence always breeds violence&quot;; the head of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Mohammed Akef, described Yassin as a &quot;martyr&quot; and his assassination a &quot;cowardly operation&quot;. Iran called the assassination a &quot;criminal act&quot; and a threat to regional security.

===Western world===
Jack Straw, then British Foreign Secretary, said: &quot;All of us understand Israel&#x27;s need to protect itself – and it is fully entitled to do that – against the terrorism which affects it, within international law. But it is not entitled to go in for this kind of unlawful killing and we condemn it. It is unacceptable, it is unjustified and it is very unlikely to achieve its objectives.&quot; The European Union&#x27;s foreign policy head Javier Solana expressed concern that it might impede the peace process.

In response to a question about the killing, U.S. President George W. Bush responded:

United States Representative to the United Nations John Negroponte stated that the United States was &quot;deeply troubled by this action by the Government of Israel&quot;, while asserting that the U.S. would not support any U.N. Security Council statement condemning Israel&#x27;s assassination of Yassin that did not include a condemnation of &quot;Hamas terrorist attacks&quot;. According to his statement to the UN Security Council,

<doc id="80833" wikidata="Q131018" url="?curid=80833" title="François Rabelais">
<text>François Rabelais ( , ; ; born between 1483 and 1494; died 1553) was a French writer who has been called the first great French prose author. A humanist of the French Renaissance and Greek scholar, he attracted opposition from both Protestant theologian John Calvin and from the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. Though in his day he was best known as a physician, scholar, diplomat, and Catholic priest, later he became better known as a satirist for his depictions of the grotesque, and for his larger-than-life characters.

Living in the religious and political turmoil of the Reformation, Rabelais treated the great questions of his time in his novels. Rabelais admired Erasmus and like him is considered a Christian humanist. He was critical of medieval scholasticism and lampooned the abuses of powerful princes and popes.

Rabelais is widely known for the first two volumes relating the childhoods of the giants Gargantua and Pantagruel written in the style of &quot;bildungsroman&quot;; his later works—the &quot;Third Book&quot; (which prefigures the philosophical novel) and the &quot;Fourth Book&quot; are considerably more erudite in tone. His literary legacy gave rise to the word &quot;&quot;, an adjective meaning &quot;marked by gross robust humor, extravagance of caricature, or bold naturalism.&quot;

== Biography ==
===Touraine countryside to monastic life===
According to a tradition dating back to Roger de Gaignières (1642–1715), François Rabelais was the son of seneschal and lawyer Antoine Rabelais and was born at the estate of &quot;La Devinière&quot; in Seuilly (near Chinon), Touraine in modern-day Indre-et-Loire, where a Rabelais museum can be found today. The exact dates of his birth (c. 1483–1494) and death (1553) are unknown, but most scholars accept his likely birthdate as being 1483. His education was likely typical of the late medieval period: beginning with the trivium syllabus that included the study of grammar, rhetoric, and dialectic before moving on to the quadrivium, which dealt with arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.

In 1623, Jacques Bruneau de Tartifume wrote that Rabelais began his life as a novice of the Franciscan Order of Cordeliers, at the Convent of the Cordeliers, near Angers; however there is no direct evidence to support this theory. By 1520, he was at Fontenay-le-Comte in Poitou where he became friends with Pierre Lamy, a fellow Franciscan, and corresponded with Guillaume Budé, who observed that he was already competent in law. Following Erasmus&#x27; commentary on the original Greek version of the &quot;Gospel of Luke&quot;, the Sorbonne banned the study of Greek in 1523, believing that it encouraged &quot;personal interpretation&quot; of the New Testament. As a result, both Lamy and Rabelais had their Greek books confiscated. Frustrated by the ban, Rabelais petitioned Pope Clement VII (1523–1534) and obtained an indult with the help of Bishop , and was able to leave the Franciscans for the Benedictine Order at Maillezais. At the Saint-Pierre-de-Maillezais abbey, he worked as a secretary to the bishop—a well-read prelate appointed by Francis I—and enjoyed his protection.

===Physician and author ===

Around 1527 he left the monastery without authorization, becoming an apostate until Pope Paul III absolved him of this crime, which carried with it the risk of severe sanctions, in 1536. Until this time, church law forbade him to work as a doctor or surgeon. J. Lesellier surmises that it was during the time he spent in Paris from 1528 to 1530 that two of his three children (François and Junie) were born. After Paris, Rabelais went to the University of Poitiers and then to the University of Montpellier to study medicine. In 1532 he moved to Lyon, one of the intellectual centres of the Renaissance, and began working as a doctor at the hospital Hôtel-Dieu de Lyon. During his time in Lyon, he edited Latin works for the printer Sebastian Gryphius, and wrote a famous admiring letter to Erasmus to accompany the transmission of a Greek manuscript from the printer. Gryphius published Rabelais&#x27; translations and annotations of Hippocrates, Galen and Giovanni Manardo. In 1537 he returned to Montpellier to pay the fees to obtain his licence to practice medicine (April 3) and obtained his doctorate the following month (May 22). Upon his return to Lyon in the summer, he gave an anatomy lesson at Lyon&#x27;s Hôtel-Dieu using the corpse of a hanged man, which Etienne Dolet described in his &quot;Carmina&quot;. It was through his work and scholarship in the field of medicine that Rabelais gained European fame. 

In 1532, under the pseudonym Alcofribas Nasier (an anagram of François Rabelais), he published his first book, &quot;Pantagruel King of the Dipsodes&quot;, the first of his &quot;Gargantua&quot; series, primarily to supplement his income at the hospital. The idea of basing an allegory on the lives of giants came to Rabelais from the folklore legend of &quot;les Grandes chroniques du grand et énorme géant Gargantua&quot;, which were sold by colporteurs and at the as popular literature in the form of inexpensive pamphlets. The first edition of an almanac parodying the astrological predictions of the time called &quot;Pantagrueline prognostications&quot; appeared for the year 1533 from the press of Rabelais&#x27; publisher François Juste. It contained the name &quot;Maître Alcofribas&quot; in its full title. The popular almanacs continued irregularly until the final 1542 edition, which was prepared for the &quot;perpetual year&quot;. From 1537, they were printed at the end of Juste&#x27;s editions of &quot;Pantagruel&quot;. Pantagruelism is an &quot;eat, drink and be merry&quot; philosophy, which led his books into disfavor with the theologians but brought them popular success and the admiration of later critics for their focus on the body. This first book, critical of the existing monastic and educational system, contains the first known occurrence in French of the words &quot;encyclopédie&quot;, &quot;caballe&quot;, &quot;progrès&quot;, and &quot;utopie&quot;, among others. The book became popular, along with its 1534 prequel, which dealt with the life and exploits of Pantagruel&#x27;s father Gargantua, and which was more infused with the politics of the day and overtly favorable to the monarchy than the preceding volume had been. The 1534 re-edition of &quot;Pantagruel&quot; contains many orthographic, grammatical, and typographical innovations, in particular the use of diacritics (accents, apostrophes, and diaereses), which was then new in French. Mireille Huchon ascribes this innovation in part to the influence of Dante&#x27;s &quot;De vulgari eloquentia&quot; on French letters.

=== Travel to Italy ===
No clear evidence establishes when Jean du Bellay and Rabelais met. Nevertheless, when du Bellay was sent to Rome in January 1534 to convince Pope Clément VII not to excommunicate Henry VIII, he was accompanied by Rabelais, who worked as his secretary and personal physician until his return in April. During his stay, Rabelais found the city fascinating and decided to bring out a new edition of Bartolomeo Marliani&#x27;s &quot;Topographia antiqua Romae&quot; with Sebastien Gryphe in Lyon. 

Rabelais quietly left the Hôtel Dieu de Lyon on 13 February 1535 after receiving his salary, disappearing until August 1535 as a result of the tumultuous Affair of the Placards, which led Francis I to issue an edict forbidding all printing in France. Only the influence of the du Bellays allowed the printing presses to run again. In May, Jean du Bellay was named cardinal, and still with a diplomatic mission for Francis I, had Rabelais join him in Rome. During this time, Rabelais was also working for Geoffroy d&#x27;Estissac&#x27;s interests and maintained a correspondence with him through diplomatic channels (under royal seal as far as Poitiers). Three letters from Rabelais have survived. On 17 January 1536, Paul III issued a papal brief authorizing Rabelais to join a Benedictine monastery and practice medicine, as long as he refrained from surgery. Jean du Bellay having been named the abbot &quot;in commendam&quot; of the Saint-Maur Abbey, Rabelais arranged to be assigned there, knowing that the monks were to become secular clergy the following year.
In 1540, Rabelais lived for a short time in Turin as part of the household of du Bellay&#x27;s brother, Guillaume. It was at this time that his two children were legitimized by Paul III, the same year that his third child (Théodule) died in Lyon at the age of two. Rabelais also spent some time lying low, under periodic threat of being condemned of heresy depending upon the health of his various protectors. In 1543, both &quot;Gargantua&quot; and &quot;Pantagruel&quot; were condemned by the Sorbonne, then a theological college. Only the protection of du Bellay saved Rabelais after the condemnation of his novel by the Sorbonne. In June 1543 Rabelais became a Master of Requests. Between 1545 and 1547 François Rabelais lived in Metz, then a free imperial city and a republic, to escape the condemnation by the University of Paris. In 1547, he became curate of Saint-Christophe-du-Jambet in Maine and of Meudon near Paris.

With support from members of the prominent du Bellay family, Rabelais had received approval from King Francis I to continue to publish his collection on 19 September 1545 for six years. However, on 31 December 1546, the &quot;Tiers Livre&quot; joined the Sorbonne&#x27;s list of banned books. After the king&#x27;s death in 1547, the academic élite frowned upon Rabelais, and the Paris Parlement suspended the sale of The Fourth Book, published in 1552, despite Henry II having accorded him the royal privilege. This suspension proved ineffective, for the time being, as the king reiterated his support for the book.

Rabelais resigned from the curacy in January 1553 and died in Paris later that year.

== Novels ==
=== &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; ===


&quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; relates the adventures of Gargantua and his son Pantagruel. The tales are adventurous and erudite, festive and gross, ecumenical, and rarely—if ever—solemn for long. The first book, chronologically, was &quot;Pantagruel: King of the Dipsodes&quot; and the Gargantua mentioned in the Prologue refers not to Rabelais&#x27; own work but to storybooks that were being sold at the Lyon fairs in the early 1530s. In the first chapter of the earliest book, Pantagruel&#x27;s lineage is listed back 60 generations to a giant named Chalbroth. The narrator dismisses the skeptics of the time—who would have thought a giant far too large for Noah&#x27;s Ark—stating that Hurtaly (the giant reigning during the flood and a great fan of soup) simply rode the Ark like a kid on a rocking horse, or like a fat Swiss guy on a cannon.

In the Prologue to &quot;Gargantua&quot; the narrator addresses the: &quot;Most illustrious drinkers, and &quot;you&quot; the most precious pox-riddenfor to &quot;you&quot; and &quot;you&quot; alone are my writings dedicated ...&quot; before turning to Plato&#x27;s &quot;Banquet&quot;. An unprecedented syphilis epidemic had raged through Europe for over 30 years when the book was published, even the king of France was reputed to have been infected. Etion was the first giant in Pantagruel&#x27;s list of ancestors to suffer from the disease.

Although most chapters are humorous, wildly fantastic and frequently absurd, a few relatively serious passages have become famous for expressing humanistic ideals of the time. In particular, the chapters on Gargantua&#x27;s boyhood and Gargantua&#x27;s paternal letter to Pantagruel present a quite detailed vision of education.

==== Thélème ====
In the second novel, &quot;Gargantua&quot;, M. Alcofribas narrates the Abbey of Thélème, built by the giant Gargantua. It differs markedly from the monastic norm, since it is open to both monks and nuns and has a swimming pool, maid service, and no clocks in sight. Only the good-looking are permitted to enter. The inscription at the gate first specifies who is not welcome: hypocrites, bigots, the pox-ridden, Goths, Magoths, straw-chewing law clerks, usurious grinches, old or officious judges, and burners of heretics. When the members are defined positively, the text becomes more inviting:
&lt;poem&gt;
::::Honour, praise, distraction
::::Herein lies subtraction
::::in the tuning up of joy.
::::To healthy bodies so employed
::::Do pass on this reaction:
::::Honour, praise, distraction&lt;/poem&gt;
The Thélèmites in the abbey live according to a single rule:

DO WHAT YOU WANT

=== &quot;The Third Book&quot; ===
Published in 1546 under his own name with the &quot;privilège&quot; granted by Francis I for the first edition and by Henri II for the 1552 edition, &quot;The Third Book&quot; was condemned by the Sorbonne, like the previous tomes. In it, Rabelais revisited discussions he had had while working as a secretary to Geoffroy d&#x27;Estissac earlier in Fontenay–le–Comte, where &quot;la querelle des femmes&quot; had been a lively subject of debate. More recent exchanges with Marguerite de Navarre—possibly about the question of clandestine marriage and the Book of Tobit whose canonical status was being debated at the Council of Trent—led Rabelais to dedicate the book to her before she wrote the &quot;Heptaméron&quot;.

In contrast to the two preceding chronicles, the dialogue between the characters is much more developed than the plot elements in the third book. In particular, the central question of the book, which Panurge and Pantagruel consider from multiple points of view, is an abstract one: whether Panurge should marry or not. Torn between the desire for a wife and the fear of being cuckolded, Panurge engages in divinatory methods, like dream interpretation and bibliomancy. He consults authorities vested with revealed knowledge, like the sibyl of Panzoust or the mute Nazdecabre, profane acquaintances, like the theologian Hippothadée or the philosopher Trouillogan, and even the jester Triboulet. It is likely that several of the characters refer to real people: Abel Lefranc argues that Hippothadée was Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples, Rondibilis was the doctor Guillaume Rondelet, the esoteric Her Trippa corresponds to Cornelius Agrippa. One of the comic features of the story is the contradictory interpretations Pantagruel and Panurge get embroiled in, the first of which being the paradoxical encomium of debts in chapter III. &quot;The Third Book&quot;, deeply indebted to &quot;In Praise of Folly&quot;, contains the first-known attestation of the word &quot;paradoxe&quot; in French.

The more reflective tone shows the characters&#x27; evolution from the earlier tomes. Here Panurge is not as crafty as Pantagruel and is stubborn in his will to turn every sign to his advantage, refusing to listen to advice he had himself sought out. For example, when Her Trippa reads dark omens in his future marriage, Panurge accuses him of the same blind self-love (&quot;philautie&quot;) from which he seems to suffer. His erudition is more often put to work for pedantry than let to settle into wisdom. By contrast, Pantagruel&#x27;s speech gains in weightiness by the third book, the exuberance of the young giant having faded.

At the end of the &quot;Third Book&quot;, the protagonists decide to set sail in search of a discussion with the Oracle of the Divine Bottle. The last chapters are focused on the praise of Pantagruelion, which combines properties of linen and hemp—a plant used in the 16th century for both the hangman&#x27;s rope and medicinal purposes, being copiously loaded onto the ships. As a naturalist inspired by Pliny the Elder and Charles Estienne, the narrator intercedes in the story, first describing the plant in great detail, then waxing lyrical on its various qualities.

=== &quot;The Fourth Book&quot; ===

Rabelais began work on &quot;The Fourth Book&quot; while still in Metz. He dropped off a manuscript containing eleven chapters and ending mid-sentence in Lyon on his way to Rome to work as Cardinal du Bellay&#x27;s personal physician in 1548. According to Jean Plattard, this publication served two purposes: first, it brought Rabelais some much-needed money; and second, it allowed him to respond to those who considered his work blasphemous. While the prologue denounced slanderers, the following chapters did not raise any polemical issues. Already it contained some of the best-known episodes, including the storm at sea and Panurge&#x27;s sheep. It was framed as an erratic odyssey, inspired in part by the Argonauts and the news of Jacques Cartier&#x27;s voyage to Canada, and in part by the imaginary voyage described by Lucian in &quot;A True Story&quot;, which provided Rabelais not only with several anecdotes, but also with a first-person narrator who regularly insisted on the &quot;veracity&quot; of obviously fantastical elements of the story. The full version appeared in 1552, after Rabelais received a royal privilege on 6 Aug 1550 for the exclusive right to publish his work in French, Tuscan, Greek, and Latin. This, he accomplished with the help of the young Cardinal of Châtillon (Odet de Coligny)—who would later convert to Protestantism and be excommunicated. Rabelais thanks the Cardinal for his help in the prefatory letter signed 28 January 1552 and, for the first time in the Pantagruel series, titled the prologue in his own name rather than using a pseudonym.

== Use of language ==

The French Renaissance was a time of linguistic contact and debate. The first book of French, rather than Latin, grammar was published in 1530, followed nine years later by the language&#x27;s first dictionary. Spelling was far less codified. Rabelais, as an educated reader of the day, preferred etymological spelling—preserving clues to the lineage of words—to more phonetic spellings which wash those traces away.

Rabelais&#x27; use of Latin, Greek, regional and dialectal terms, creative calquing, gloss, neologism and mis-translation was the fruit of the printing press having been invented less than a hundred years earlier. A doctor by trade, Rabelais was a prolific reader, who wrote a great deal about bodies and all they excrete or ingest. His fictional works are filled with multilingual, often sexual, puns, absurd creatures, bawdy songs and lists. Words and metaphors from Rabelais abound in modern French and some words have found their way into English, through Thomas Urquhart&#x27;s unfinished 1693 translation, completed and considerably augmented by Peter Anthony Motteux by 1708. According to Radio-Canada, the novel &quot;Gargantua&quot; permanently added more than 800 words to the French language.

== Scholarly views ==
Most scholars today agree that Rabelais wrote from a perspective of Christian humanism. This has not always been the case. Abel Lefranc, in his 1922 introduction to &quot;Pantagruel&quot;, depicted Rabelais as a militant anti-Christian atheist. On the contrary, M. A. Screech, like Lucien Febvre before him, describes Rabelais as an Erasmian. While formally a Roman Catholic, Rabelais was a humanist, and favoured classical Antiquity over the &quot;barbarous&quot; Middle Ages, believing in the need for reform to return science and arts to their classical blossoming, and theology and the Church to their original Evangelical form as expressed in the Gospels. In particular, he was critical of monasticism. Rabelais criticised what he considered to be inauthentic Christian positions by both Catholics and Protestants, and was attacked and portrayed as a threat to religion or even an atheist by both. For example, &quot;at the request of Catholic theologians, all four Pantagrueline chronicles were censured by either the Sorbonne, Parlement, or both&quot;. On the opposite end of the spectrum, John Calvin saw Rabelais as a representative of the numerous moderate evangelical humanists who, while &quot;critical of contemporary Catholic institutions, doctrines, and conduct&quot;, did not go far enough; in addition, Calvin considered Rabelais&#x27; apparent mocking tone to be especially dangerous, since it could be easily interpreted as a rejection of the sacred truths themselves.

Timothy Hampton writes that &quot;to a degree unequaled by the case of any other writer from the European Renaissance, the reception of Rabelais&#x27;s work has involved dispute, critical disagreement, and ... scholarly wrangling ...&quot; In particular, as pointed out by Bruno Braunrot, the traditional view of Rabelais as a humanist has been challenged by early post-structuralist analyses denying a single consistent ideological message of his text, and to some extent earlier by Marxist critiques such as Mikhail Bakhtin with his emphasis on the subversive folk roots of Rabelais&#x27; humour in medieval &quot;carnival&quot; culture. At present, however, &quot;whatever controversy still surrounds Rabelais studies can be found above all in the application of feminist theories to Rabelais criticism&quot;, as he is alternately considered a misogynist or a feminist based on different episodes in his works.

An article by Edwin M. Duvall in &quot;Études rabelaisiennes&quot; 18 (1985) sparked a debate on the prologue of &quot;Gargantua&quot; in the pages of the &quot;Revue d’histoire littéraire de la France&quot; as to whether Rabelais intentionally hid higher meanings in his work, to be discovered through erudition and philology, or if instead the polyvalence of symbols was a poetic device meant to resist the reductive gloss.

 suggests that Panurge&#x27;s description (in the Papimane Island episode in &quot;The Fourth Book&quot;) of the ill-effects of the pages of decretals being used as toilet paper, targets, cones, and masks on whatever they touch was due to their misuse as material objects. As the merry crew sail on from the island towards the Divine Bottle, in the subsequent episode, Pantagruel is content simply listening to the thawing words as they rain down on the boat, whereas Jeanneret observes that his companions focus instead on their colourful appearance while they are still frozen, hurrying to gather as many up as they can and offering to sell those they have collected. The pilot describes the words as evidence of a great battle, and the narrator even wants to preserve some of the finest insults in oil. Jeanneret observes that Pantagruel considers the exchange of words to be an act of love rather than a commercial exchange, argues that their artificial preservation is superfluous, and &quot;insinuates that books are petrified tombs, where the signs threaten to stop moving and, left to the devices of lazy readers, get shriveled down into simplistic meanings[,]&quot; implying that &quot;[a]ll writing carries within it the danger of the Decretals.&quot;

The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; of 1911 declared that Rabelais was
... a revolutionary who attacked all the past, Scholasticism, the monks; his religion is scarcely more than that of a spiritually minded pagan. Less bold in political matters, he cared little for liberty; his ideal was a tyrant who loves peace. [...] His vocabulary is rich and picturesque, but licentious and filthy.[...] As a whole it exercises a baneful influence.

== In literature ==
Acknowledging both the sordid side of the work and its protean nature, Jean de La Bruyère in 1688 saw beyond that its sublimity:His book is an enigma, it is whatever you want to say, it is inexplicable, it is a chimera ….. a monstrous assembling of refined and ingenious morality and foul corruption. Either it is bad, sinking far below the worst, to have the charm of the rabble. Or it is good, rising as far as exquisite and excellent, to be perhaps the most delicious of dishes.

In his 1759–1767 novel &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, Laurence Sterne quotes extensively from Rabelais. Alfred Jarry performed, from memory, hymns of Rabelais at Symbolist Rachilde&#x27;s Tuesday salons, and worked for years on an unfinished libretto for an opera by Claude Terrasse based on Pantagruel. Anatole France gave lectures on Rabelais in Argentina. John Cowper Powys, D. B. Wyndham-Lewis, and Lucien Febvre (one of the founders of the French historical school &quot;Annales&quot;), all wrote books about him.

James Joyce included an allusion to &quot;Master Francois somebody&quot; in his 1922 novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

Mikhail Bakhtin, a Russian philosopher and critic, derived his concepts of the carnivalesque and grotesque body from the world of Rabelais. He points to the historical loss of communal spirit after the Medieval period and speaks of carnival laughter as an &quot;expression of social consciousness&quot;.

Aldous Huxley admired Rabelais&#x27; work. Writing in 1929, he praised Rabelais, stating &quot;Rabelais loved the bowels which Swift so malignantly hated. His was the true amor fati : he accepted reality in its entirety, accepted with gratitude and delight this amazingly improbable world.&quot;

George Orwell was not an admirer of Rabelais. Writing in 1940, he called him &quot;an exceptionally perverse, morbid writer, a case for psychoanalysis&quot;. Milan Kundera, in a 2007 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, commented on a list of the most notable works of French literature, noting with surprise and indignation that Rabelais was placed behind Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s war memoirs, and was denied the &quot;aura of a founding figure! Yet in the eyes of nearly every great novelist of our time he is, along with Cervantes, the founder of an entire art, the art of the novel&quot;. In the satirical musical &quot;The Music Man&quot; by Meredith Willson, the names &quot;Chaucer! Rabelais! Balzac!&quot; are presented by local gossips as evidence that the town librarian &quot;advocates dirty books.&quot;

Rabelais is a pivotal figure in Kenzaburō Ōe&#x27;s 1994 acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

== Honours, tributes and legacy ==
* The public university in Tours, France is named Université François Rabelais.
* Honoré de Balzac was inspired by the works of Rabelais to write Les Cent Contes Drolatiques (The Hundred Humorous Tales). Balzac also pays homage to Rabelais by quoting him in more than twenty novels and the short stories of La Comédie humaine (The Human Comedy). Michel Brix wrote of Balzac that he &quot;is obviously a son or grandson of Rabelais... He has never hidden his admiration for the author of Gargantua, whom he cites in Le Cousin Pons as &quot;the greatest mind of modern humanity&quot;. In his story of &quot;Zéro, Conte Fantastique&quot; published in La Silhouette on 3 October 1830, Balzac even adopted Rabelais&#x27;s pseudonym (&quot;Alcofribas&quot;).
* There is a tradition at the University of Montpellier&#x27;s Faculty of Medicine: no graduating medic can undergo a convocation without taking an oath under &quot;Rabelais&#x27;s robe&quot;. Further tributes are paid to him in other traditions of the university, such as its &quot;faluche&quot;, a distinctive student headcap which in Montpellier is styled in his honour, with four bands of colour emanating from its centre.
* Asteroid &#x27;5666 Rabelais&#x27; was named in honor of François Rabelais in 1982.
* In Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio&#x27;s 2008 Nobel Prize lecture, Le Clézio referred to Rabelais as &quot;the greatest writer in the French language&quot;.
* In France the moment at a restaurant when the waiter presents the bill is still sometimes called &quot;le quart d&#x27;heure de Rabelais&quot; (The fifteen minutes of Rabelais), in memory of a famous trick Rabelais used to get out of paying a tavern bill.

<text>Pedro Telmo Zarraonandía Montoya (20 January 1921 – 23 February 2006), known as Telmo Zarra (, ), was a Spanish football forward. He spent the majority of his career at Athletic Bilbao, from 1940 to 1955, for whom he remains the top scorer in competitive matches with 335 goals.

Zarra signed for Athletic after playing one season for Erandio. He became a prolific goalscorer in his 15 seasons at the club, winning the Pichichi Trophy as the highest scorer in La Liga on six occasions. During his career, Zarra scored a total of 251 league goals, a Spanish record that lasted nearly six decades before being broken by Lionel Messi. His 81 goals in the Copa del Rey remain a record.

Despite his goalscoring records, he only played for Spain 20 times. Even so, he still managed to score 20 goals, including four in one match as Spain beat Switzerland 6–3 on 18 February 1951. He also scored his country&#x27;s winning goal against England in the 1950 World Cup finals as Spain reached the final four—their best performance in the competition until winning the 2010 FIFA World Cup 60 years later.

After leaving Athletic in 1955, he played for one year with SD Indautxu and another with Barakaldo CF before retiring. He died of a heart attack on 23 February 2006, aged 85. The Zarra Trophy for the highest-scoring Spaniard in La Liga is awarded in his memory.

==Early life==
Zarra was born on 20 January 1921 at the Asúa train station in Erandio, Biscay. He was the son of Telmo Zarraonandía, an engineer and head of Asúa station, and Tomasa Montoya. Zarra was the seventh of ten children, five of them boys. The family was of Romani descent.

When he was young, Zarra used to play football with his neighbours. While other children had homemade or improvised balls, Zarra had access to a real ball, as two of his brothers played football in La Liga with Arenas de Getxo: Tomás, a goalkeeper and the oldest sibling, and Domingo, who died during the Spanish Civil War.

His father did not like Zarra playing football, because &quot;it was enough with two brothers in the practice of this game.&quot; But Zarra liked the sport and began playing for several local teams, including Asia and Pitoberese. At that time, he was nicknamed &quot;Telmito the fearful&quot;, as he would play cautiously, being ashamed and self-conscious of his skill.

==Career==
===Early career===
Zarra signed his first professional contract with SD Erandio Club of the Second Division, and was incorporated into team during the 1937–38 season. Later he was recruited to a team from Biscay to play a friendly match against a team assembled from Guipuzcoa, during which Zarra scored seven goals in a 9–0 win.

Around this time, Athletic Bilbao was looking for players to rebuild the team, which had been disbanded years before in the chaos caused by the Civil War. The team began recruiting young, promising players from Erandio for their team for the 1940–41 season.

===Professional stage and early successes===
Zarra debuted with Athletic Club on 29 September 1940, in a league match against Valencia CF. The game ended in a 2–2 draw, with Zarraonandía scoring both goals for his team (including his first league goal, scored 17 minutes into the game).

During the 1941–42 season Zarra temporarily left Athletic Bilbao to join the army. He was dispatched to Ceuta, and played some friendly matches with the team there. Upon his return to Bilbao, Zarra experienced one of the biggest disappointments of his career while playing in the final of the Copa del Rey against Barcelona. They had reached the end of normal time and neither team had managed to score. During extra time, Zarra had an opportunity to score against rival goalkeeper Miró, but he missed the shot; consequently, Barça won the match and Cup.

The 1942–43 campaign was one of the most important for both Zarra and Athletic Bilbao. Athletic reached the Copa del Rey final after having defeated Atlético Madrid and FC Valencia. There they met Real Madrid and this time, Zarra was able to redeem himself by scoring the only goal in the final, winning the year&#x27;s cup in addition to the league title.

Zarra&#x27;s first serious injury occurred in the 1943–44 season in a match against Barcelona. He broke his clavicle and was unable to play for a while. Once recovered, Zarra was able to return to the pitch and celebrate with a Copa del Rey title, helping Athletic record a 2–0 win over Valencia.

In the 1944–45 season, with Athletic again facing Valencia in the Copa del Rey final, four minutes from time a Valencia player fell to the ground. Zarra made a move to trample the fallen player, as a joke, and he was sent off by the referee. This expulsion was the first and only he suffered throughout his career. Despite this, Athletic took the title that year thanks to a goal by Rafael Iriondo that made the score 3–2.

Zarra experienced the best moments of his career in the 1944–45 season with his first Pichichi Trophy, marking 20 goals scored in 26 matches. He would go on to win this award on five other occasions (1946, 1947, 1950, 1951 and 1953).

===1945–1953===
On 11 March 1945, Zarra was selected by the Spanish coach Jacinto Quincoces to join the Spanish national team for a friendly match against Portugal in Lisbon. On 6 May of that year he played against Portugal again, and scored two of the four goals that won the match.

On 28 May 1950, Zarra again played in another Copa del Rey final, this time against Real Valladolid after Valencia CF was disbanded. During the final, he scored four of the goals that won the game for his team. He opened the scoring at 14 minutes, but by end of regulation time the match was drawn. During extra time, Zarra scored a hat trick as Athletic won the cup. With those four against Valladolid, Zarra holds the record for highest number of goals scored in a Cup final.

Once qualified, the Spanish team played matches against the United States, Chile, and England in the 1950 FIFA World Cup. He scored one of the goals in a 2–0 win over Chile in the second match. Zarra referred to the third game, against England, as &quot;the game of the century.&quot; Zarra&#x27;s goal past the English goalkeeper Bert Williams won the match and sent Spain through at the expense of England. This goal, perhaps the most famous scored by Zarra, gave the victory to the Spanish team in their first World Cup semi-finals.

In the 1950–51 season Zarra was able to score 38 goals in 30 league games, a Spanish record that stood until the 2010–11 season. This record was also achieved by the Mexican Hugo Sánchez, although he scored his 38 goals over the course of 38 matches.

During the 1951–52 season Zarra suffered his most serious injury of his career, on 25 November 1951 in a game against Atlético Madrid, when the opposing goalkeeper fell on Zarra&#x27;s leg. An operation was required for full recovery, which kept him out for the rest of the season. On his return in the 1952–53 season, he played 29 games and scored on 25 occasions, giving a scoring average of 0.86 from both seasons.

===Last years and retirement===
On 29 April 1954, Zarra received a tribute and benefit match in Madrid (played between two regional selections) in recognition of his long career in Spanish football. This event was attended by several VIPs from the world of football, including Alfredo Di Stéfano, Antonio Puchades, Estanislao Basora, Piru Gaínza, Eduardo Manchon, and Cesar Lesmes.

Zarra was nearing the end of this career and watched as young, promising Athletic players took over his role on the team, including a young player named Eneko Arieta, who would become his successor.

Zarra ended his Athletic career at the end of the 1954–55 season. From then on he devoted himself to playing for several teams in the Second Division until his official retirement from the game in 1957; however, he continued playing football with the veteran players of Biscay, donating the money collected from these games to charities.

<text>Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders is a 1988 graphic adventure game by Lucasfilm Games. It was the second game to use the SCUMM engine, after &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;. The project was led by David Fox, with Matthew Alan Kane as the co-designer and co-programmer.

Like &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;, it was developed for the Commodore 64 and later released in 1988 for that system and DOS.

==Plot==
The story is set in 1997, nine years after the game&#x27;s production. The plot follows Zak, a writer for the &quot;National Inquisitor&quot;, a tabloid newspaper; Annie Larris, a freelance scientist; and Melissa China and Leslie Bennett, two Yale University students, in their attempt to prevent the nefarious alien Caponians (who have taken over &quot;The Phone Company&quot;, an amalgamation of various telecommunication companies around the world) from slowly reducing the intelligence of everybody on Earth by emitting a 60 Hz &quot;hum&quot; from their &quot;Mind Bending Machine&quot;. The Skolarians, another ancient alien race, have left a defense mechanism hanging around to repulse the Caponians (the &quot;Skolarian Device&quot;), which needs reassembly and start-up, but the parts are spread all over Earth and Mars.

==Development==
&quot;Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders&quot; was developed and published by Lucasfilm Games. It was the second game to use the SCUMM engine, after &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;. Like &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;, Zak McKracken was initially developed for the Commodore 64 and ported later to other systems. The project was led by David Fox, with Matthew Alan Kane as the co-designer and co-programmer. Fox consulted with New Age writer David Spangler for the game materials. The game was originally meant to be more serious, resembling the Indiana Jones series, but Ron Gilbert persuaded David Fox to increase the humorous aspects of the game. The game was consequently heavily inspired by many popular theories about aliens, ancient astronauts, and mysterious civilizations. The many places visited in the game are common hotspots for these ideas, such as the pyramids of Egypt and Mexico, Lima, Stonehenge, the Bermuda Triangle, and the Face on Mars. The Skolarians are based on the Greys alien, while the Caponians (a name derived from &quot;Al Capone&quot;) are primarily based on the Men in Black, with their Cadillac-shaped spaceship and Elvis-themed leader (nicknamed &quot;The King&quot;). The Caponians also have heads shaped like Easter Island&#x27;s Moai statues.

== Release ==
Zak McKracken was originally released in October 1988, for the C64, self-published by Lucasfilm Games. A port to IBM PC (DOS) followed in the same year. In 1989, the game was ported to the Amiga and Atari ST. A DOS version with enhanced graphics was also released.

The Japanese version of the game was released in 1990 under the title &quot;Zak McKracken&quot; ( &quot;Zakkumakkurakken&quot;); for the Japanese Fujitsu FM Towns computer. Produced by Douglas Crockford, it came on CD-ROM with 256-color graphics and a remastered sampled audio soundtrack. It is playable in both English and Japanese. When this version is played in Japanese, the sprites&#x27; eyes are replaced with anime eyes. The box art was redrawn for the Japanese market by artist Yuzuki Hikaru (弓月光), otherwise known as Nishimura Tsukasa (西村司).

===Re-release===
In March 2015, Zak McKracken was re-released on the digital distribution platform GOG.com after years of commercial non-availability. The GOG.com release marked the first time the 256-color version of the game had been made officially available outside Japan.

==Reception==
Discussing &quot;Zak McKracken&quot;″s commercial performance, David Fox later wrote, &quot;I think Zak was far more popular in Germany and Europe than in the States. I&#x27;m not sure why... maybe my humor was more European in nature?&quot;

Many reviews, both online and in print, rate &quot;Zak McKracken&quot; as among the best adventure games ever made, but others disagree. Charles Ardai in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described &quot;Zak McKracken&quot; as a good game, but said that it could have been better. He described the game&#x27;s central flaw in the game&#x27;s environments, limited to a relatively small number of screens per location, giving each town a movie-set feel compared to the size and detail of &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;. &quot;PC Computing&quot; wrote that &quot;Zak McKracken&quot; for the PC had a clever story but &quot;grade B animation&quot;, concluding that &quot;the result falls short of the magic we expect from George Lucas&quot;. &quot;Compute!&quot; favorably reviewed &quot;Zak McKracken&quot;, but wished that Lucasfilm would next produce a game that did not depend on jokes and puzzles to tell its story. The large number of mazes in the game was also a source of criticism, but David Fox felt it was the best way to maximize the game&#x27;s size and still have it fit on two Commodore 64 floppy disks. Other critics complained about the need to enter copy protection codes not once, but multiple times whenever the player flew out of the US.

The game was reviewed in 1989 in &quot;Dragon&quot; No. 142 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game out of 5 stars.

The game received high scores in general press. It received 90 out of 100 in several reviews, such as of Zzap!, Power Play, Happy Computer, HonestGamers, Pixel-Heroes.de, Jeuxvideo.com, ST Action, and Quandary magazines.

==Legacy==
The title of the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; episode &quot;Zach and the Alien Invaders&quot; pays homage to this game&#x27;s title. Architect Antonino Cardillo argued about the influences that the game &quot;Zak McKracken&quot; had on his work &quot;House of Dust&quot; during a lecture held at Cinecittà Studios in the context of the Rome Video Game Lab 2019 festival.

===Fan sequels===
Some &quot;Zak McKracken&quot; fans have created and released their own sequels, so called fangames, among which:
* &quot;The New Adventures of Zak McKracken&quot;, released in March 2002 by &quot;LucasFan Games&quot; and containing graphics from the Japanese FM Towns 256 color version and country-specific backgrounds from various Neo-Geo games. The original release was notorious for containing an adult ending, but the ending was soon changed when the developers were told that the female characters were based on actual persons. This sequel is short and fairly limited compared to the two other fan sequels.
* &quot;Zak McKracken: Between Time and Space&quot; was released in German in April 2008 and re-released as a director&#x27;s cut in German, English and French (subtitles) in May 2015 by &quot;Artificial Hair Bros.&quot;. The game consists of hand-drawn 2D scenes and sprites and pre-rendered 3D videos. It uses the Visionaire Studio engine that professional developers like Daedalic use.

Other notable but unreleased fan sequels include:
* &quot;Zak McKracken and the Alien Rockstars&quot;, which was planned for a final release in 2007 following the release of a demo. After several project restarts and lead changes the project was stopped, but the game engine&#x27;s source code was released on SourceForge.
* &quot;Zak McKracken and the Lonely Sea Monster&quot; was scheduled for July 1, 2007, but has come to a halt. It was supposed to maintain the look of the original.

<text>Loom is a 1990 fantasy-themed graphic adventure game by Lucasfilm Games. The project was led by Brian Moriarty, a former Infocom employee and author of classic text adventures &quot;Wishbringer&quot; (1985), &quot;Trinity&quot; (1986), and &quot;Beyond Zork&quot; (1987). It was the fourth game to use the SCUMM adventure game engine, and the first of those to avoid the verb–object interface introduced in &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
A departure from other Lucasfilm adventure games in many senses, &quot;Loom&quot; is based on a serious and complex fantasy story. With its experimental interface, it eschewed the traditional paradigm of graphical adventures, where puzzles usually involve interactions between the game character, the environment, and items the character has in their possession.

&quot;Loom&quot; gameplay centers instead around magical four-note tunes known as &quot;drafts&quot; that the protagonist, Bobbin Threadbare, can play on his distaff. Each draft is a spell that has an effect of a certain type, such as &quot;Opening&quot; or &quot;Night Vision&quot;. Some drafts can be reversed by playing their notes backwards, so the &quot;Dye&quot; draft played backwards becomes &quot;Bleach&quot;, while others, such as the &quot;Terror&quot; draft, are palindromes (e.g. C–E–E–C) and so cannot be reversed in this manner.

Bobbin can learn drafts by observing an object that possesses the qualities of the desired draft; for example, by examining a blade while it is being sharpened, Bobbin can learn the &quot;Sharpening&quot; draft. When the game begins, Bobbin is only able to play drafts using the notes C, D and E, limiting his ability to reproduce more powerful drafts. As the game progresses and additional notes become available, so his ability to play new drafts increases.

The game can be played at three difficulty levels, each differing in how clearly the notes being played are labeled. For example, the &quot;Standard&quot; level indicates the notes on a scale below the distaff, while the &quot;Expert&quot; level shows no notes and must be played by ear. In the original release, expert players are rewarded with a cutscene that does not appear for the other two difficulties. The later CD-ROM release, however, shows an abridged version of this scene to all players.

== Story ==
=== Prologue ===
The events of the game are preceded by a 30-minute audio drama. It is established that the Age of the Great Guilds arose when humans once again tried to establish dominion over nature. The world of &quot;Loom&quot; is not defined in relation to ours, but the game takes place in the year 8021, raising the possibility it is set on Earth in a distant future.

People banded together to form city-states of a common trade &quot;devoted to the absolute control of knowledge, held together by stern traditions of pride, and of fear&quot;. The humble guild of Weavers established themselves as masters of woven fabric, though they eventually transcended the limits of cloth and began to weave &quot;subtle patterns of influence into the very fabric of reality&quot;. They were persecuted for these acts of &quot;witchcraft&quot;, and purchased an island far off the mainland coast, which they called Loom, after the great loom that was the symbol of their guild.

Lady Cygna Threadbare is introduced as a bereaved mother who begs the Elders of the Guild of Weavers to use the power of the Loom to end the suffering of the Weavers. Their numbers are failing and their seed is barren. The Elders Atropos, Clothos, and Lachesis, who are named after Greek mythology&#x27;s three Fates, reprimand Cygna, telling her that it is not their place to play gods.

Cygna, despite their warnings, secretly assumes control of the Loom and plants one gray thread. She inadvertently draws an (unforeseen) infant out of the Loom, incurring the wrath of the Elders. She surrenders the child to Dame Hetchel, the old serving woman, and accepts her fate. The Elders cast the &quot;Transcendence&quot; draft on her, transforming her into a swan and banishing her from the pattern (the name &quot;Cygna&quot; is the feminine form of &quot;swan&quot; in Latin). Hetchel names the child Bobbin, and cares for him as her own.

Bobbin grows up ostracized from the rest of the Guild. The Elders note that the presence of his gray thread has thrown the pattern into chaos, and the Loom foresees the very unraveling of the pattern. For these reasons, the Elders ban him from learning the ways of the Guild until a decision can be made on Bobbin&#x27;s seventeenth birthday (&quot;until his coming of age seventeen years hence&quot;, as it is described in the game&#x27;s audio drama). Hetchel, however, defies the Elders and secretly teaches him a few basics of weaving. This is where the game begins.

=== Plot ===
On his birthday, Bobbin is summoned by the Elders in order to determine his fate. He arrives at the Sanctuary in time to witness the Elders punish Hetchel with the &quot;Transcendence&quot; draft for educating Bobbin, but Hetchel reverts to a swan&#x27;s egg, which puzzles and frightens the Elders. As they contemplate this turn of events a swan comes down from the sky and crashes through a window in the Sanctuary. She casts the &quot;Transcendence&quot; draft on the Elders, as well as the rest of the villagers, transforming all the Weavers except Bobbin into swans who leave through a rift in the sky. Bobbin, who is left all alone, finds Elder Atropos&#x27; distaff, and uses it to free Hetchel from her egg.

Hetchel, who is now a cygnet, tells Bobbin that the swan who visits him every year on his birthday came to save the Weavers from the Third Shadow that is about to cover the world. Bobbin then moves on to find the flock. On his way, he meets other guilds and has several adventures. Eventually, he encounters a Cleric, Bishop Mandible, who is after the Scrying Sphere of the Glassmakers, the swords of the Blacksmiths, and the products of the Shepherds. Mandible claims the Weaver&#x27;s distaff to rule the world with an army of the undead, thus fulfilling the prophecies. By playing the draft of &quot;Opening&quot; on a nearby graveyard, he tears the fabric of the universe apart and allows an entity called &quot;Chaos&quot; to enter. Chaos kills Mandible and summons an army of undead to destroy the earth. Bobbin reclaims the distaff from the dead Bishop and heals many of the tears in the pattern, along the way helping many of his previous acquaintances, who were hurt or killed by Chaos&#x27;s army. Finally, he battles Chaos, who is striving to take control of the great Loom on his native island. The battle ends as Chaos kills his stepmother using the draft of &quot;Unmaking&quot;. It is hinted, however, that it is still possible to save Hetchel, as &quot;one feather still remained intact&quot;.

Bobbin then destroys the great Loom using the same draft. He is joined by his mother and the other Weavers and is told that one half of the world will be ruled by Chaos while the Weavers will stay in the other half, and that with time, they may gain enough power to challenge Chaos again. Bobbin casts &quot;Transcendence&quot; upon himself, and with the aid of his mother and the other villagers in their swan forms, he flies away, carrying the ripple across the world. His friends watch the flock of the swans fly away; it remains unclear whether Bobbin has left them in Chaos&#x27; realm or has saved them.

== Development ==
=== Music ===
The in-game music consists of excerpts from the &quot;Swan Lake&quot; ballet by Tchaikovsky, arranged for MIDI by George &quot;The Fat Man&quot; Sanger. While supporting basic PC speaker sound and AdLib, the EGA version originally lacked built-in Roland MT-32 support. A form included in the package could be mailed to Lucasfilm Games as an order for an extra game disk providing MT-32 support which was later also released as a downloadable patch. This disk also came with an additional overture which was played prior to the opening cutscene.

=== Package contents ===
The original package offered an audio tape with a 30-minute audio drama that explained the nature and history of the world of &quot;Loom&quot;, and the circumstances of Bobbin&#x27;s birth. The game is a direct continuation of the story. The drama was enriched by original music composed by Jerry Gerber. Side A of the tape was encoded for standard Dolby-B playback; side B was labelled &quot;game music&quot; and had a composition of the game&#x27;s soundtrack. In other releases of the game, side B had the identical program with side A encoded for Dolby-S. It was the first commercial cassette to employ Dolby-S noise reduction.

The package also offered an illustrated notebook, &quot;The Book of Patterns&quot;, supposedly belonging to apprentice weavers in the game world. Its purpose was to optionally note there the drafts that could be learned, as well as describing some that were not seen in the game, with interesting tales related to each draft. Each description also included a staff and four spaces in which to record the four respective notes of the draft. The book contained a warning saying that wise spellweavers write in pencil; this is because many of the spells in the game have randomized threads (musical notes). In the original disk versions, it also acted as a form of copy protection; the game would ask players for the notes of a particular draft in the book at start-up. If the player doesn&#x27;t enter the correct notes, the game would exit back to the operating system (in the PC version, it would enter demo mode).

=== Orson Scott Card ===
A common misconception about &quot;Loom&quot; is that author Orson Scott Card contributed to its original development, based on his name appearing in the credits. Card mentions in a review for &quot;Loom&quot; that this is untrue, and that Moriarty included his name in the credits due to some very minor feedback he had provided prior to the game&#x27;s release. Card&#x27;s association with Lucasfilm continued, however, leading to more significant contributions to &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;, &quot;Loom&quot; 1992 &quot;talkie&quot; release, and &quot;The Dig&quot; (1995).

== Release history ==
&quot;Loom&quot; was originally published for DOS on floppy disk with 16-color EGA graphics in May 1990. This version was soon after released on the Amiga, the Atari ST, and Macintosh.

=== FM Towns ===
&quot;Loom&quot; was redeveloped for the Japanese FM Towns computer and released on CD-ROM in 1991 with enhanced 256-color VGA graphics and a new digital soundtrack. The dialogue and story elements remained largely unchanged from the original version, though at least one scene was partially censored of blood, and some elements of the visual design were lost. A similar version was released for the TurboGrafx-CD in 1992, but featured a mix of visuals from the 16- and 256-color versions, adapted to that system&#x27;s color palette.

=== Talkie ===
The final version of &quot;Loom&quot; was released for DOS on CD in 1992. It featured an entirely re-recorded digital soundtrack, a separate CD for the audio drama, and fully voiced dialogue, with many of the actors reprising their roles from the audio drama. However, due to the technical constraints on how much uncompressed audio could fit on a CD, much of the original dialogue had to be revised or abridged. Orson Scott Card assisted with the dialogue revision.

The graphics were a continuation of those used in the FM Towns version but with some minor enhancements and additional censorship. Some features were also cut from the FM Towns version, such as multiple solutions to puzzles, many conversation close-ups, and parts of cutscenes. Brian Moriarty has stated that he believes the FM Towns version to be the best 256-color version of &quot;Loom&quot;.

=== Availability ===
Due to a licensing agreement with (now defunct) Mindscape, the DOS CD-ROM version became commercially unavailable, and until 2006, the DOS floppy-disk version was the only one purchasable from LucasArts. All of these versions of &quot;Loom&quot; can now be played on a variety of different platforms using the ScummVM virtual machine.

The PC CD-ROM version of &quot;Loom&quot; was released through the Steam digital distribution platform for Windows on July 8, 2009, with Mac support following on May 12, 2010.

== Reception ==
According to &quot;Rogue Leaders: The Story of LucasArts&quot;, &quot;Loom&quot; was a critical success, but &quot;failed to sell in sufficient numbers to warrant sequels&quot;.

Orson Scott Card praised &quot;Loom&quot;, writing in &quot;Compute!&quot; that it was &quot;like nothing you&#x27;ve ever seen (or done) before ... a work of storytelling art,&quot; and cited the game&#x27;s flexibility in adapting to playstyles, whether using action or puzzles. &quot;Dragon&quot; gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. Scorpia of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; approved of the game&#x27;s graphics and gameplay, but said that &quot;as an adventure game, it is just too lightweight.&quot; She stated that the game was impossible to fail, with very easy puzzles, but that the linear gameplay resulted in no freedom of movement. While praising the story, Scorpia wished that Lucasfilm would have given it an &quot;epic treatment&quot; instead of &quot;Loom&quot;″s simplicity. In April 1994 the magazine described the CD version as &quot;Brian Moriarty&#x27;s beautifully spun tale ... Though a few years old, &quot;Loom&quot;″s unique music-oriented interface, strong story-telling, and incredible graphics still stand up to more current adventure games&quot;. Although &quot;too short&quot;, the magazine recommended &quot;Loom&quot; to &quot;the new computer gamer&quot;.

&quot;Strategy Plus&quot;″s Theo Clark wrote that &quot;Loom&quot;″s &quot;story is absorbing and exciting, and there is plenty of pleasure to be gained from encounters and from discovering the effects of the various spells.&quot; He noted that players might consider it a &quot;fatal flaw&quot; that Bobbin cannot die, and that &quot;any puzzle can be resolved by clicking on all of the available items and running through all of the known drafts&quot;. However, he argued that the game is &quot;a rare treat&quot; for players who see it as &quot;a long, interactive video&quot; rather than an adventure game.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave &quot;Loom&quot; a Special Award for Artistic Achievement as part of the magazine&#x27;s Game of the Year Awards, stating that its colors, &quot;mesmerizing special effects&quot;, soundtrack, and user interface combined to make &quot;Loom&quot; &quot;a work of art.&quot; It also was nominated for the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; prize, which ultimately went to &quot;Hero&#x27;s Quest&quot;. The editors called &quot;Loom&quot; &quot;an intense entertainment experience ... true to an original philosophical vision of its author in both story and presentation&quot;.

In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;Loom&quot; the 81st-best computer game ever released. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named &quot;Loom&quot; the 61st-best adventure game ever released.

== Legacy ==
=== Sequels ===
According to &quot;Rogue Leaders&quot;, &quot;Loom&quot; was not designed to be the first game in a series, but &quot;Brian Moriarty considered additional directions for the story&quot; after development of the first entry had concluded. The two sequels planned were titled &quot;Forge&quot; and &quot;The Fold&quot;, starring Bobbin&#x27;s friends Rusty Nailbender and Fleece Firmflanks. Moriarty gave an account of potential sequels in a 2006 interview:

=== Appearance in other media ===
As was typical for LucasArts, several other games referenced the &quot;Loom&quot; characters and storyline. A likeness of Bishop Mandible&#x27;s assistant Cob, spelled &quot;Cobb&quot; with an additional B, can be found inside the Scumm Bar in &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; (1990), dressed as a pirate with a badge on his shirt that says &quot;Ask me about &quot;Loom&quot;&quot;, and will happily divulge marketing information when so asked. Cobb the pirate reappears &quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot; (2022), but has grown weary of people asking him about &quot;Loom&quot; over the years, and only does so again after much prodding. In the &quot;Legend of Monkey Island&quot; expansion for &quot;Sea of Thieves&quot; (2018), Cobb can once again be found at the Scumm Bar, and will repeat his speech about &quot;Loom&quot; if prompted.

&quot;Monkey Island&quot; protagonist, Guybrush Threepwood, can say &quot;I&#x27;m Bobbin. Are you my mother?&quot; on a number of occasions throughout the series, and in &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; (1997) can quip about Bobbin&#x27;s relative obscurity. &quot;Monkey Island&quot;, &quot;Monkey Island 2&quot; (1991), and &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot; (1993) all include a credit for their respective seagulls as &quot;Seagull appears courtesy of LOOM™&quot;.

The player can kill the Loom seagull in the 1995 LucasArts game &quot;Full Throttle&quot; as well as its 2017 remake. A wooden statue in tribute to the &quot;Looming Seagulls&quot; can be found at the Scumm Bar in &quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot;.

In the 256-color remake of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure&quot;, a landscape painting in the vault of Brunwald Castle features a scene from &quot;Loom&quot;. The NES version of &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;, released in September 1990, features a broken record titled &quot;The Soundtrack of Loom&quot;.

&quot;Space Quest IV&quot;, a game released the following year by Sierra On-Line, makes light of &quot;Loom&quot; criticisms by featuring a description of a video game named &quot;BOOM&quot; in the game&#x27;s Radio Shock store: &quot;The latest bomb from master storyteller Morrie Brianarty, &quot;BOOM&quot; is a post-holocaust adventure set in post-holocaust America after the holocaust. Neutron bombs have eradicated all life, leaving only YOU to wander through the wreckage. No other characters, no conflict, no puzzles, no chance of dying, and no interface make this the easiest-to-finish game yet! Just boot it up and watch it explode!&quot;

Analytic continuation often succeeds in defining further values of a function, for example in a new region where the infinite series representation which initially defined the function becomes divergent.

The step-wise continuation technique may, however, come up against difficulties. These may have an essentially topological nature, leading to inconsistencies (defining more than one value). They may alternatively have to do with the presence of singularities. The case of several complex variables is rather different, since singularities then need not be isolated points, and its investigation was a major reason for the development of sheaf cohomology.

==Initial discussion==
Suppose &quot;f&quot; is an analytic function defined on a non-empty open subset &quot;U&quot; of the complex plane If &quot;V&quot; is a larger open subset of containing &quot;U&quot;, and &quot;F&quot; is an analytic function defined on &quot;V&quot; such that

:formula_1

then &quot;F&quot; is called an analytic continuation of &quot;f&quot;. In other words, the restriction of &quot;F&quot; to &quot;U&quot; is the function &quot;f&quot; we started with.

Analytic continuations are unique in the following sense: if &quot;V&quot; is the connected domain of two analytic functions &quot;F&quot;1 and &quot;F&quot;2 such that &quot;U&quot; is contained in &quot;V&quot; and for all &quot;z&quot; in &quot;U&quot;

:formula_2

then

:formula_3

on all of &quot;V&quot;. This is because &quot;F&quot;1 − &quot;F&quot;2 is an analytic function which vanishes on the open, connected domain &quot;U&quot; of &quot;f&quot; and hence must vanish on its entire domain. This follows directly from the identity theorem for holomorphic functions.

==Applications==
A common way to define functions in complex analysis proceeds by first specifying the function on a small domain only, and then extending it by analytic continuation.

In practice, this continuation is often done by first establishing some functional equation on the small domain and then using this equation to extend the domain. Examples are the Riemann zeta function and the gamma function.

The concept of a universal cover was first developed to define a natural domain for the analytic continuation of an analytic function. The idea of finding the maximal analytic continuation of a function in turn led to the development of the idea of Riemann surfaces.

Analytic continuation is used in Riemannian manifolds, in the context of solutions of Einstein&#x27;s equations. For example, Schwarzschild coordinates can be analytically continued into Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates.

==Worked example==

Begin with a particular analytic function formula_4. In this case, it is given by a power series centered at formula_5:

formula_6

By the Cauchy–Hadamard theorem, its radius of convergence is 1. That is, formula_4 is defined and analytic on the open set formula_8 which has boundary formula_9. Indeed, the series diverges at formula_10.

Pretend we don&#x27;t know that formula_11, and focus on recentering the power series at a different point formula_12:

formula_13

We&#x27;ll calculate the formula_14&#x27;s and determine whether this new power series converges in an open set formula_15 which is not contained in formula_16. If so, we will have analytically continued formula_4 to the region formula_18 which is strictly larger than formula_16.

The distance from formula_20 to formula_21 is formula_22. Take formula_23; let formula_24 be the disk of radius formula_25 around formula_20; and let formula_27 be its boundary. 
Then formula_28. Using Cauchy&#x27;s differentiation formula to calculate the new coefficients, one has
formula_29

The last summation results from the th derivation of the geometric series, which gives the formula 
formula_30

Then,
formula_31

which has radius of convergence formula_32 around formula_33. If we choose formula_12 with formula_35, then formula_15 is not a subset of formula_16 and is actually larger in area than formula_16. The plot shows the result for formula_39

We can continue the process: select formula_40, recenter the power series at formula_41, and determine where the new power series converges. If the region contains points not in formula_18, then we will have analytically continued formula_4 even further. This particular formula_4 can be analytically continued to the whole punctured complex plane formula_45

In this particular case the obtained values of formula_46 are the same when the successive centers have a positive imaginary part or a negative imaginary part. This is not always the case; in particular this is not the case for the complex logarithm, the antiderivative of the above function.

==Formal definition of a germ==
The power series defined below is generalized by the idea of a &quot;germ&quot;. The general theory of analytic continuation and its generalizations is known as sheaf theory. Let

: formula_47

be a power series converging in the disk &quot;D&quot;&quot;r&quot;(&quot;z&quot;0), &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0, defined by

:formula_48.

Note that without loss of generality, here and below, we will always assume that a maximal such &quot;r&quot; was chosen, even if that &quot;r&quot; is ∞. Also note that it would be equivalent to begin with an analytic function defined on some small open set. We say that the vector

:formula_49

is a &quot;germ&quot; of &quot;f&quot;. The &quot;base&quot; &quot;g&quot;0 of &quot;g&quot; is &quot;z&quot;0, the &quot;stem&quot; of &quot;g&quot; is (α0, α1, α2, ...) and the &quot;top&quot; &quot;g&quot;1 of &quot;g&quot; is α0. The top of &quot;g&quot; is the value of &quot;f&quot; at &quot;z&quot;0.

Any vector &quot;g&quot; = (&quot;z&quot;0, α0, α1, ...) is a germ if it represents a power series of an analytic function around &quot;z&quot;0 with some radius of convergence &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0. Therefore, we can safely speak of the set of germs formula_50.

==The topology of the set of germs==
Let &quot;g&quot; and &quot;h&quot; be germs. If formula_51 where &quot;r&quot; is the radius of convergence of &quot;g&quot; and if the power series defined by &quot;g&quot; and &quot;h&quot; specify identical functions on the intersection of the two domains, then we say that &quot;h&quot; is generated by (or compatible with) &quot;g&quot;, and we write &quot;g&quot; ≥ &quot;h&quot;. This compatibility condition is neither transitive, symmetric nor antisymmetric. If we extend the relation by transitivity, we obtain a symmetric relation, which is therefore also an equivalence relation on germs (but not an ordering). This extension by transitivity is one definition of analytic continuation. The equivalence relation will be denoted formula_52.

We can define a topology on formula_50. Let &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0, and let

:formula_54

The sets &quot;Ur&quot;(&quot;g&quot;), for all &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0 and formula_55 define a basis of open sets for the topology on formula_50.

A connected component of formula_50 (i.e., an equivalence class) is called a &quot;sheaf&quot;. We also note that the map defined by formula_58 where &quot;r&quot; is the radius of convergence of &quot;g&quot;, is a chart. The set of such charts forms an atlas for formula_50, hence formula_50 is a Riemann surface. formula_50 is sometimes called the &quot;universal analytic function&quot;.

==Examples of analytic continuation==
:formula_62

is a power series corresponding to the natural logarithm near &quot;z&quot; = 1. This power series can be turned into a germ
:formula_63

This germ has a radius of convergence of 1, and so there is a sheaf &quot;S&quot; corresponding to it. This is the sheaf of the logarithm function.

The uniqueness theorem for analytic functions also extends to sheaves of analytic functions: if the sheaf of an analytic function contains the zero germ (i.e., the sheaf is uniformly zero in some neighborhood) then the entire sheaf is zero. Armed with this result, we can see that if we take any germ &quot;g&quot; of the sheaf &quot;S&quot; of the logarithm function, as described above, and turn it into a power series &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) then this function will have the property that exp(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)) = &quot;z&quot;. If we had decided to use a version of the inverse function theorem for analytic functions, we could construct a wide variety of inverses for the exponential map, but we would discover that they are all represented by some germ in &quot;S&quot;. In that sense, &quot;S&quot; is the &quot;one true inverse&quot; of the exponential map.

In older literature, sheaves of analytic functions were called &quot;multi-valued functions&quot;. See sheaf for the general concept.

==Natural boundary==
Suppose that a power series has radius of convergence &quot;r&quot; and defines an analytic function &quot;f&quot; inside that disc. Consider points on the circle of convergence. A point for which there is a neighbourhood on which &quot;f&quot; has an analytic extension is &quot;regular&quot;, otherwise &quot;singular&quot;. The circle is a natural boundary if all its points are singular.

More generally, we may apply the definition to any open connected domain on which &quot;f&quot; is analytic, and classify the points of the boundary of the domain as regular or singular: the domain boundary is then a natural boundary if all points are singular, in which case the domain is a &quot;domain of holomorphy&quot;.

===Example I: A function with a natural boundary at zero (the prime zeta function)===
For formula_64 we define the so-called prime zeta function, formula_65, to be

:formula_66

This function is analogous to the summatory form of the Riemann zeta function when formula_64 in so much as it is the same summatory function as formula_68, except with indices restricted only to the prime numbers instead of taking the sum over all positive natural numbers. The prime zeta function has an analytic continuation to all complex &quot;s&quot; such that formula_69, a fact which follows from the expression of formula_65 by the logarithms of the Riemann zeta function as

:formula_71

Since formula_68 has a simple, non-removable pole at formula_73, it can then be seen that formula_65 has a simple pole at formula_75. Since the set of points

:formula_76

has accumulation point 0 (the limit of the sequence as formula_77), we can see that zero forms a natural boundary for formula_65. This implies that formula_65 has no analytic continuation for &quot;s&quot; left of (or at) zero, i.e., there is no continuation possible for formula_65 when formula_81. As a remark, this fact can be problematic if we are performing a complex contour integral over an interval whose real parts are symmetric about zero, say formula_82 for some formula_83, where the integrand is a function with denominator that depends on formula_65 in an essential way.

===Example II: A typical lacunary series (natural boundary as subsets of the unit circle)===
For integers formula_85, we define the lacunary series of order &quot;c&quot; by the power series expansion

:formula_86

Clearly, since formula_87 there is a functional equation for formula_88 for any &quot;z&quot; satisfying formula_89 given by formula_90. It is also not difficult to see that for any integer formula_91, we have another functional equation for formula_88 given by

:formula_93

For any positive natural numbers &quot;c&quot;, the lacunary series function diverges at formula_94. We consider the question of analytic continuation of formula_88 to other complex &quot;z&quot; such that formula_96 As we shall see, for any formula_97, the function formula_88 diverges at
the formula_99-th roots of unity. Hence, since the set formed by all such roots is dense on the boundary of the unit circle, there is no analytic continuation of formula_88 to complex &quot;z&quot; whose modulus exceeds one.

The proof of this fact is generalized from a standard argument for the case where formula_101 Namely, for integers formula_97, let

:formula_103

where formula_104 denotes the open unit disk in the complex plane and formula_105, i.e., there are formula_106 distinct complex numbers &quot;z&quot; that lie on or inside the unit circle such that formula_107. Now the key part of the proof is to use the functional equation for formula_88 when formula_89 to show that

:formula_110

Thus for any arc on the boundary of the unit circle, there are an infinite number of points &quot;z&quot; within this arc such that formula_111. This condition is equivalent to saying that the circle formula_112 forms a natural boundary for the function formula_88 for any fixed choice of formula_114 Hence, there is no analytic continuation for these functions beyond the interior of the unit circle.

==Monodromy theorem==

The monodromy theorem gives a sufficient condition for the existence of a &quot;direct analytic continuation&quot; (i.e., an extension of an analytic function to an analytic function on a bigger set).

Suppose formula_115 is an open set and &quot;f&quot; an analytic function on &quot;D&quot;. If &quot;G&quot; is a simply connected domain containing &quot;D&quot;, such that &quot;f&quot; has an analytic continuation along every path in &quot;G&quot;, starting from some fixed point &quot;a&quot; in &quot;D&quot;, then &quot;f&quot; has a direct analytic continuation to &quot;G&quot;.

In the above language this means that if &quot;G&quot; is a simply connected domain, and &quot;S&quot; is a sheaf whose set of base points contains &quot;G&quot;, then there exists an analytic function &quot;f&quot; on &quot;G&quot; whose germs belong to &quot;S&quot;.

==Hadamard&#x27;s gap theorem==
For a power series

: formula_116

with

:formula_117

the circle of convergence is a natural boundary. Such a power series is called lacunary.
This theorem has been substantially generalized by Eugen Fabry (see Fabry&#x27;s gap theorem) and George Pólya.

== Pólya&#x27;s theorem ==
Let

:formula_47

be a power series, then there exist &quot;ε&quot;&quot;k&quot; ∈ {−1, 1} such that

: formula_119

has the convergence disc of &quot;f&quot; around &quot;z&quot;0 as a natural boundary.

The proof of this theorem makes use of Hadamard&#x27;s gap theorem.

<doc id="80845" wikidata="Q74401" url="?curid=80845" title="Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis">
<text>Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis is a point-and-click adventure game developed and published by LucasArts and released in June 1992 for Amiga, DOS, and Macintosh. Almost a year later, it was reissued on CD-ROM as an enhanced &quot;talkie&quot; edition with full voice acting and digitized sound effects. The seventh game to use the script language SCUMM, &quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot; has the player explore environments and interact with objects and characters by using commands constructed with predetermined verbs. It features three unique paths to select, influencing story development, gameplay and puzzles. The game used an updated SCUMM engine and required a 286-based PC, although it still runs as a real-mode DOS application. The CD talkie version required EMS memory enabled to load the voice data.

The plot is set in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; universe and revolves around Indiana Jones&#x27;s global search for the legendary sunken city of Atlantis. Sophia Hapgood, an old co-worker of Indiana Jones who gave up her archaeological career to become a psychic, supports him along the journey. The two are pursued by the Nazis who seek to use the power of Atlantis for warfare, and serve as the antagonists. The story was written by Hal Barwood and Noah Falstein, the game&#x27;s designers, who had rejected the original plan to base it on an unused film script. They came up with the final concept while researching real-world sources for a suitable plot device.

&quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot; was acclaimed by critics and received several awards for &quot;Best Adventure Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Game of the Year&quot; after its release by several game publications. It became a million-unit seller and is regarded as one of the greatest video games of all time. Two concepts for a supposed sequel were conceived, but both projects were eventually canceled due to unforeseen problems during development. They were reworked into two separate Dark Horse Comics series by Lee Marrs and Elaine Lee, respectively.

In June 2009, the game was released as an unlockable extra of the Wii action game &quot;Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings&quot;, and as a digitally distributed Steam title for Microsoft Windows and OS X on July 8 the same year.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot; is based on the SCUMM story system by Ron Gilbert, Aric Wilmunder, Brad P. Taylor, and Vince Lee, thus employing similar gameplay to other point-and-click adventures developed by LucasArts in the 1980s and 1990s. The player explores the game&#x27;s static environments while interacting with sprite-based characters and objects; they may use the pointer to construct and give commands with a number of predetermined verbs such as &quot;Pick up&quot;, &quot;Use&quot; and &quot;Talk to&quot;. Conversations with non-playable characters unfold in a series of selectable questions and answers.

Early on, the player is given the choice between three different game modes, each with unique cutscenes, puzzles to solve and locations to visit: the Team Path, the Wits Path, and the Fists Path. In the Team Path, protagonist Indiana Jones is joined by his partner Sophia Hapgood who will provide support throughout the game. The Wits Path is centered on complex puzzles, while the Fists Path focuses heavily on action sequences and fist fighting, the latter of which is optional in the other two modes. Atypical for LucasArts titles, it is possible for the player character to die at certain points, though dangerous situations were designed to be easily recognizable. A score system, the Indy Quotient Points, keeps track of the puzzles solved, the obstacles overcome and the important objects found.

==Plot==
In 1939, on the eve of World War II, archaeology professor and adventurer Indiana Jones tries to find a small statue in the archives of his workplace, Barnett College, at the behest of a visitor named Mr. Smith. After Indy retrieves the horned figurine, Smith uses a key to open it, revealing a sparkling metal bead inside. Smith pulls out a gun and escapes with the two artifacts, but loses his coat in the process. The identity card inside reveals &quot;Smith&quot; to be Klaus Kerner, a Nazi agent. Also inside the coat is an old magazine containing an article about an expedition on which Jones collaborated with a young woman named Sophia Hapgood, who has since given up archaeology to become a psychic.

Fearing that she might be Kerner&#x27;s next target, Indy travels to New York City to warn her and to find out more about the mysterious statue. There, he interrupts her lecture on the culture and downfall of Atlantis, and the two return to Sophia&#x27;s apartment. They discover that Kerner ransacked her office in search of Atlantean artifacts, but Sophia says that she keeps her most valuable item, her necklace, with her. She owns another of the shiny beads, identified as the mystical metal orichalcum, and places it in the medallion&#x27;s mouth, invoking the spirit of the Atlantean king Nur-Ab-Sal. She explains that a Nazi scientist, Dr. Hans Ubermann, is searching for the power of Atlantis to use it as an energy source for warfare.
Sophia gets a telepathic message from Nur-Ab-Sal, instructing them to find the Lost Dialogue of Plato, the &quot;Hermocrates&quot;, a book that will guide them to the city. After gathering information, Indy and Sophia find it in a collection at Barnett College. Correcting Plato&#x27;s &quot;tenfold error&quot;, a mistranslation from Egyptian to Greek, the document pinpoints the location of Atlantis in the Mediterranean, 300 miles from the Kingdom of Greece, instead of 3000 as mentioned in the dialogue &quot;Critias&quot;. It says that in order to gain access to the Lost City and its colonies, three special engraved stones are required. At this point, the player has to choose between the Team, Wits, or Fists path, which influences the way the stones are acquired. In all three paths, Jones meets an artifact dealer in Monte Carlo, ventures to an archaeological dig in Algiers, explores an Atlantean labyrinth in Knossos on Crete, and Sophia gets captured by the Nazis. Other locations include the remains of a small Atlantean colony on Thera, a hydrogen balloon and a Nazi submarine.

The individual scenarios converge at this point as Indiana makes his way to the underwater entrance of Atlantis near Thera and starts to explore the Lost City. He figures out how to use various Atlantean devices and produce orichalcum beads. With this knowledge he saves Sophia from a prison, and they make their way to the center of Atlantis, where her medallion guides them to the home of Nur-Ab-Sal. The spirit of the Atlantean king takes full possession of Sophia and it is by a trick that Indy rids her of the necklace and destroys it, thus freeing her. Meanwhile, they notice grotesquely deformed bones all over the place. They advance further and eventually reach a large colossus the inhabitants of the city built trying to transform themselves into gods. They had hoped using ten orichalcum beads at a time would enable them to control the water with the powers they gained, keeping the sea level down to prevent an impending catastrophe.

Unknowingly, Indiana starts the machine, upon which Kerner, Ubermann, and Nazi troops invade the place and announce their intention to use the machine to become gods. The machine was responsible for creating the mutated skeletons seen earlier, but the Nazis believe that it will work on them due to their &quot;Aryan&quot; qualities. Kerner insists to step onto the platform first, claiming himself to be most suitable for godhood. After Jones mentions Plato&#x27;s tenfold error, Kerner decides to use one bead instead of ten. He is turned into a horribly deformed and horned creature, and jumps into the surrounding lava. Indiana is forced to step on the platform next but threatens Ubermann with eternal damnation once he is a god. Fearing his wrath, Ubermann uses the machine on himself, feeding it one hundred beads. He is turned into a green ethereal being, but his form becomes unstable and he flies apart with an agonized scream.

Two alternative bad endings see one of the protagonists undergo the second transformation if Indiana could not convince Ubermann to use the machine instead, or if Sophia was not freed from her prison and Nur-Ab-Sal&#x27;s influence. In the happy ending, Atlantis succumbs to the eruption of the still active volcano as the duo flees from the city. The final scene depicts Indiana kissing Sophia on top of the escape submarine, to comfort himself for the lack of evidence for their discovery.

==Development==

At the time a sequel to &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure&quot; was decided, most of the staff of Lucasfilm Games were occupied with other projects such as &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;The Dig&quot;. Designer Hal Barwood had created two computer games on his own before, but was put in charge of the project because of his experience as a producer and writer of feature films. The company originally wanted him to create a game based on &quot;Indiana Jones and the Monkey King/Garden of Life&quot;, a rejected script written by Chris Columbus for the third film that would have seen Indiana looking for Chinese artifacts in Africa. However, after reading the script Barwood decided that the idea was substandard, and requested to create an original story for the game instead. Along with co-worker Noah Falstein, he visited the library of George Lucas&#x27; workplace Skywalker Ranch to look for possible plot devices. They eventually decided upon Atlantis when they looked at a diagram in &quot;some cheap coffee-table book on the world&#x27;s unsolved mysteries&quot;, which depicted the city as built in three concentric circles. Falstein and Barwood originally considered the mythical sword Excalibur as the story&#x27;s plot device, but the idea was scrapped because it would not have easily given Indiana Jones a reason to go anywhere except England.

Writing the story involved extensive research on pseudo-scientific books. Inspiration for the mythology, such as the description of the city and the appearance of the metal orichalcum, was primarily drawn from Plato&#x27;s dialogues &quot;Timaeus&quot; and &quot;Critias&quot;, and from Ignatius Loyola Donnelly&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; that revived interest in the myth during the nineteenth century. The magical properties of orichalcum and the Atlantean technology depicted in the game were partly adopted from Russian spiritualist Helena Blavatsky&#x27;s publications on the force vril. The giant colossus producing gods was based on a power-concentrating device called &quot;firestone&quot;, formerly described by American psychic Edgar Cayce.

Once Barwood and Falstein completed the rough outline of the story, Barwood wrote the script, and the team began to conceive the puzzles and to design the environments. The Atlantean artifacts and architecture devised by lead artist William Eaken were made to resemble those of the Minoan civilization, while the game in turn implies that the Minoans were inspired by Atlantis. Barwood intended for the Atlantean art to have an &quot;alien&quot; feel to it, with the machines seemingly operating on as yet unknown physics rather than on magic. The backgrounds were first pencil sketched, given a layer of basic color and then converted and touched up with 256-colors. Mostly they were mouse-drawn with Deluxe Paint, though roughly ten percent were paintings scanned at the end of the development cycle. As a consequence of regular design changes, the images often had to be revised by the artists. Character animations were fully rotoscoped with video footage of Steve Purcell for Indiana&#x27;s and Collette Michaud for Sophia&#x27;s motions. The main art team that consisted of Eaken, James Dollar and Avril Harrison was sometimes consulted by Barwood to help out with the more graphical puzzles in the game, such as a broken robot in Atlantis.

The addition of three different paths was suggested by Falstein and added about six more months of development time, mainly because of all the extra dialogue that had to be implemented for the interaction between Indiana and Sophia. Altogether, the game took around two years to finish, starting in early 1990, and lasting up to the floppy disk release in June 1992. The only aspect Barwood was not involved in at all was the production of voices for the enhanced &quot;talkie&quot; edition released on CD-ROM in May 1993, which was instead handled by Tamlynn Barra. The voice-over recordings for the approximately 8000 lines of dialogue took about four weeks, and were done with actors from the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. Harrison Ford was not available to record Indiana Jones&#x27;s voice, so a substitute actor Doug Lee was used. Victor Entertainment published the game for FM Towns in August 1993. The &quot;talkie&quot; version was later included as an extra game mode in the Wii version of the 2009 action game &quot;Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings&quot;, and distributed via the digital distribution service Steam as a port for Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Mac OS X in July 8 that same year. The versions on the Wii and Steam have improved MIDI versions of the soundtrack, along with both voices and text. Lucasfilm released the game for Linux in a collection of Disney classics, including &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; on GOG platform in October 2014.

The package illustration for &quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot; was inspired by the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film posters of Drew Struzan. It was drawn by Eaken within three days, following disagreements with the marketing department and an external art director over which concept to use. Clint Bajakian, Peter McConnell and Michael Land created the soundtrack, arranging John Williams&#x27; main theme &quot;The Raiders March&quot; for a variety of compositions. The DOS version uses sequenced music played back by either an internal speaker, the FM synthesis of an AdLib or Sound Blaster sound card, or the sample-based synthesis of a Roland MT-32 sound module. During development of the game, William Messner-Loebs and Dan Barry wrote a Dark Horse Comics series based on Barwood&#x27;s and Falstein&#x27;s story, then titled &quot;Indiana Jones and the Keys to Atlantis&quot;. In an interview, Eaken mentioned hour-long meetings of the development team trying to come up with a better title than &quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot;, though the staff members could never think of one and always ended up with names such as &quot;Indiana Jones Does Atlantis&quot;. The final title was Barwood&#x27;s idea, who first had to convince the company&#x27;s management and the marketing team not to simply call the game &quot;Indy&#x27;s Next Adventure&quot;.

LucasArts developed a port of the enhanced edition for the Sega CD, but the release was eventually canceled because &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; failed to be a commercial success on the platform. The arcade-style game &quot;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis: The Action Game&quot; designed by Attention to Detail was released almost simultaneously with its adventure counterpart, and loosely follows its plot.

==Reception==
According to &quot;Rogue Leaders: The Story of LucasArts&quot;, &quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot; was &quot;a commercial hit&quot;. Noah Falstein reported that it was LucasArts&#x27; all-time most successful adventure title by 2009, at which point its lifetime sales had surpassed 1 million units. He recalled that the game&#x27;s player audience was 30% female, a higher figure than most LucasArts titles had achieved before its release.

Reviewers from &quot;Game Informer&quot;, &quot;Computer Game Review&quot;, &quot;Games Magazine&quot; and &quot;Game Players Magazine&quot; named &quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot; the &quot;Best Adventure Game of the Year&quot;, and it was later labeled a &quot;classic&quot; by &quot;IGN&quot;. Patricia Hartley and Kirk Lesser of &quot;Dragon&quot; called it &quot;terrific&quot; and &quot;thought-provoking&quot;. They lauded the &quot;Team, Wits, Fists&quot; system for increasing the game&#x27;s replay value, but believed that the Team option was the best. The reviewers summarized it as a &quot;must-buy&quot;. Lim Choon Wee of the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; praised the game&#x27;s graphics and arcade-style sequences. About the former, he wrote that the game has great colours and brilliant sprite animation. He echoed Hartley&#x27;s and Lesser&#x27;s opinion that &quot;Team&quot; was the best mode of the game. Wee ended his review by calling &quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot; &quot;a brilliant game&quot;, and better than &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

Charles Ardai of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in September 1992 praised its setting for containing the &quot;right combination of gravity, silliness, genuine scholarship and mystical mumbo-jumbo&quot;, and called it a &quot;strong enough storyline to hold its own next to any of the &quot;Indy&quot; films&quot;. He highly praised the game&#x27;s Team, Wits, Fists system. He also enjoyed its graphics and varied locales. Although he cited the pixelated character sprites and lack of voice acting as low points, Ardai summarized &quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot; as an &quot;exuberant, funny, well-crafted and clever game&quot; that bettered its predecessor, &quot;The Last Crusade&quot;. &quot;QuestBusters&quot; also praised the game, stating that it &quot;is not only the best adventure ever done by LucasArts ... but is also probably the nicest graphic adventure ever ... just about perfect in all areas&quot;. The reviewer wrote &quot;&quot;Atlantis&quot; shines in 256 colors&quot; and that &quot;the musicians and sound effects specialists deserve a tip of the hat&quot;, stating that the audio &quot;completes the effect of playing a movie&quot;. He described the puzzles as quite creative and certainly fair&quot; and liked the multiple solutions. The reviewer concluded that the game was &quot;a must-buy for all adventurers&quot; and &quot;gets my vote ... for &#x27;Best Quest of the Year&#x27;&quot;, tied with &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot;, &quot;both of which redefine the state-of-the-art in their respective genres&quot;.

The following year, Ardai stated that &quot;unlike many recent CD-ROM upgrades, which have been embarrassing and amateurish&quot;, the CD-ROM version &quot;has the stamp of quality all over it&quot;, with the added dialogue and sound effects &quot;like taking a silent film and turning it into a talkie ... It&#x27;s hard to go back to reading text off a monitor after experiencing a game like this&quot;. He concluded that &quot;LucasArts has done an impeccable job ... a must-see&quot;. In April 1994 the magazine said that &quot;the disk version of &quot;Atlantis&quot; is fun, but in many ways, it&#x27;s just another adventure game&quot;, but speech made the CD version &quot;a fine approximation of an Indiana Jones film, with you as the main character&quot;. Andy Nuttal of &quot;Amiga Format&quot; wrote that the puzzles are very well thought-out and noted that the game is &quot;littered with elements that are genuinely funny&quot;. His sole complaint was about the game&#x27;s linearity compared to &quot;Monkey Island 2&quot;, but ultimately called the title one of the best Amiga adventures. In 2008, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine praised it as &quot;a masterful piece of storytelling, and a spellbinding adventure&quot;.

In 1992 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; named &quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot; as one of the year&#x27;s four best adventure games. It was nominated for an award at the 1993 Game Developers Conference. In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named the CD-ROM version of &quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot; as the 38th best computer game ever. The editors wrote that the floppy release was &quot;a terrific game&quot;, but that the CD-ROM edition improved upon it by set[ting] a new industry standard for voice acting. That same year, &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; named it the 13th best computer game of all time. The editors called it &quot;a sumptuous feast for adventure and Indy fans alike&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&quot; the 93rd-best computer game ever released. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named &quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot; the 11th-best adventure game ever released.

In 1998, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; declared it the 41st-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it &quot;a milestone achievement for LucasArts, this genre&#x27;s greatest exponent, and it remains required playing for adventurers everywhere&quot;.

==Planned sequels==
After the release of the game, a story for a supposed successor in the adventure genre was conceived by Joe Pinney, Hal Barwood, Bill Stoneham, and Aric Wilmunder. Titled &quot;Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix&quot;, it was set after World War II and featured Nazis seeking refuge in Bolivia, trying to resurrect Adolf Hitler with the philosopher&#x27;s stone. The game was in development for 15 months before it was showcased at the European Computer Trade Show.

When the German coordinators discovered how extensively the game dealt with Neo-Nazism, they informed LucasArts about the difficulty of marketing the game in their country. As Germany was an important overseas market for adventure games, LucasArts feared that the lower revenues would not recoup development costs, and subsequently canceled the game. The plot was later adapted into &quot;Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix&quot;, a four-part Dark Horse Comics series by Lee Marrs, published monthly from December 1994 to March 1995. In an interview, Barwood commented that the development team should have thought about the story more thoroughly beforehand, calling it insensitive and not regretting the cancellation of the title.

Another follow-up game called &quot;Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny&quot; was planned, which revolved around the Spear of Longinus. Development was outsourced to a small studio, but eventually stopped as LucasArts did not have experience with the supervision of external teams. Elaine Lee loosely reworked the story into &quot;Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny&quot;, another four-part comic book series, released from April to July 1995.

<text>A seashell or sea shell, also known simply as a shell, is a hard, protective outer layer usually created by an animal or organism that lives in the sea. Most seashells are made by mollusks, such as snails, clams, and oysters to protect their soft insides. Empty seashells are often found washed up on beaches by beachcombers. The shells are empty because the animal has died and the soft parts have decomposed or been eaten by another organism.

A seashell is usually the exoskeleton of an invertebrate (an animal without a backbone), and is typically composed of calcium carbonate or chitin. Most shells that are found on beaches are the shells of marine mollusks, partly because these shells are usually made of calcium carbonate, and endure better than shells made of chitin.

Apart from mollusk shells, other shells that can be found on beaches are those of barnacles, horseshoe crabs and brachiopods. Marine annelid worms in the family Serpulidae create shells which are tubes made of calcium carbonate cemented onto other surfaces. The shells of sea urchins are called &quot;tests&quot;, and the moulted shells of crabs and lobsters are exuviae. While most seashells are external, some cephalopods have internal shells.

Seashells have been used by humans for many different purposes throughout history and prehistory. However, seashells are not the only kind of shells; in various habitats, there are shells from freshwater animals such as freshwater mussels and freshwater snails, and shells of land snails.

== Terminology ==
When the word &quot;seashells&quot; refers only to the shells of marine mollusks, then studying seashells is part of conchology. Conchologists or serious collectors who have a scientific bias are in general careful not to disturb living populations and habitats: even though they may collect a few live animals, most responsible collectors do not often over-collect or otherwise disturb ecosystems.

The study of mollusks (including their shells) is known as malacology; a person who studies mollusks is known as a malacologist.

== Occurrence ==
Seashells are commonly found in beach drift, which is natural detritus deposited along strandlines on beaches by the waves and the tides. Shells are very often washed up onto a beach empty and clean, the animal having already died.

Empty seashells are often picked up by beachcombers. However, the majority of seashells which are offered for sale commercially have been collected alive (often in bulk) and then killed and cleaned, specifically for the commercial trade. This type of large-scale exploitation can sometimes have a strong negative impact on local ecosystems, and sometimes can significantly reduce the distribution of rare species.

== Shell synthesis ==
Seashells are created by the molluscs that use them for protection. Molluscs have an outside layer of tissues on their bodies the mantle which creates the shell material and which connects the shell to the mollusc. The specialized cells in the mantle form the shell using different minerals and proteins. The proteins are then used to create the framework that supports the growing shell. Calcium carbonate is the main compound of shell structure, aiding in adhesion.

== Molluscan seashells ==


The word &quot;seashell&quot; is often used to mean only the shell of a marine mollusk. Marine mollusk shells that are familiar to beachcombers and thus most likely to be called &quot;seashells&quot; are the shells of marine species of bivalves (or clams), gastropods (or snails), scaphopods (or tusk shells), polyplacophorans (or chitons), and cephalopods (such as nautilus and spirula). These shells are very often the most commonly encountered, both in the wild, and for sale as decorative objects.

Marine species of gastropods and bivalves are more numerous than land and freshwater species, and the shells are often larger and more robust. The shells of marine species also often have more sculpture and more color, although this is by no means always the case.

In the tropical and sub-tropical areas of the planet, there are far more species of colorful, large, shallow water shelled marine mollusks than there are in the temperate zones and the regions closer to the poles.

Although there are a number of species of shelled mollusks that are quite large, there are vast numbers of extremely small species too, see micromollusks.

Not all mollusks are marine. There are numerous land and freshwater mollusks, see for example snail and freshwater bivalves. In addition, not all mollusks have an external shell: some mollusks such as some cephalopods (squid and octopuses) have an internal shell, and many mollusks have no shell, see for example slug and nudibranch.

=== Bivalves ===
Bivalves are often the most common seashells that wash up on large sandy beaches or in sheltered lagoons. They can sometimes be extremely numerous. Very often the two valves become separated.

There are more than 15,000 species of bivalves that live in both marine and freshwater. Examples of bivalves are clams, scallops, mussels, and oysters. The majority of bivalves consist of two identical shells that are held together by a flexible hinge. The animal&#x27;s body is held protectively inside these two shells. Bivalves that do not have two shells either have one shell or they lack a shell altogether. The shells are made of calcium carbonate and are formed in layers by secretions from the mantle. Bivalves, also known as pelecypods, are mostly filter feeders; through their gills, they draw in water, in which is trapped tiny food particles. Some bivalves have eyes and an open circulatory system. Bivalves are used all over the world as food and as a source of pearls. The larvae of some freshwater mussels can be dangerous to fish and can bore through wood.

Shell Beach, Western Australia, is a beach which is entirely made up of the shells of the cockle &quot;Fragum erugatum&quot;.

=== Gastropods ===
Certain species of gastropod seashells (the shells of sea snails) can sometimes be common, washed up on sandy beaches, and also on beaches that are surrounded by rocky marine habitat.

=== Polyplacophorans ===
Chiton plates or valves often wash up on beaches in rocky areas where chitons are common. Chiton shells, which are composed of eight separate plates and a girdle, usually come apart not long after death, so they are almost always found as disarticulated plates. Plates from larger species of chitons are sometimes known as &quot;butterfly shells&quot; because of their shape.

=== Cephalopods ===


Only a few species of cephalopods have shells (either internal or external) that are sometimes found washed up on beaches.

Some cephalopods such as &quot;Sepia&quot;, the cuttlefish, have a large internal shell, the cuttlefish bone, and this often washes up on beaches in parts of the world where cuttlefish are common.

&quot;Spirula spirula&quot; is a deep water squid-like cephalopod. It has an internal shell which is small (about 1 in or 24 mm) but very light and buoyant. This chambered shell floats very well and therefore washes up easily and is familiar to beachcombers in the tropics.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; is the only genus of cephalopod that has a well-developed external shell. Females of the cephalopod genus &quot;Argonauta&quot; create a papery egg case which sometimes washes up on tropical beaches and is referred to as a &quot;paper nautilus&quot;.

The largest group of shelled cephalopods, the ammonites, are extinct, but their shells are very common in certain areas as fossils.

=== Molluscan seashells used by other animals ===
Empty molluscan seashells are a sturdy, and usually readily available, &quot;free&quot; resource which is often easily found on beaches, in the intertidal zone, and in the shallow subtidal zone. As such they are sometimes used second-hand by animals other than humans for various purposes, including for protection (as in hermit crabs) and for construction.

==== Mollusks ====
* Carrier shells in the family Xenophoridae are marine shelled gastropods, fairly large sea snails. Most species of xenophorids cement a series of objects to the rim of their shells as they grow. These objects are sometimes small pebbles or other hard detritus. Very often shells of bivalves or smaller gastropods are used, depending on what is available on the particular substrate where the snail itself lives. It is not clear whether these shell attachments serve as camouflage, or whether they are intended to help prevent the shell sinking into a soft substrate.
* Small octopuses sometimes use an empty shell as a sort of cave to hide in, or hold seashells around themselves as a form of protection like a temporary fortress.

==== Invertebrates ====

* Almost all genera of hermit crabs use or &quot;wear&quot; empty marine gastropod shells throughout their lifespan, in order to protect their soft abdomens, and in order to have a strong shell to withdraw into if attacked by a predator. Each individual hermit crab is forced to find another gastropod shell on a regular basis, whenever it grows too large for the one it is currently using.

:Some hermit crab species live on land and may be found quite some distance from the sea, including those in the tropical genus &quot;Coenobita&quot;.

=== Conchology ===
There are numerous popular books and field guides on the subject of shell-collecting. Although there are a number of books about land and freshwater mollusks, the majority of popular books emphasize, or focus exclusively on, the shells of marine mollusks. Both the science of studying mollusk shells and the hobby of collecting and classifying them are known as conchology. The line between professionals and amateur enthusiasts is often not well defined in this subject, because many amateurs have contributed to, and continue to contribute to, conchology and the larger science of malacology. Many shell collectors belong to &quot;shell clubs&quot; where they can meet others who share their interests. A large number of amateurs collect the shells of marine mollusks, and this is partly because many shells wash up empty on beaches, or live in the intertidal or sub-tidal zones, and are therefore easily found and preserved without much in the way of specialized equipment or expensive supplies. Some shell collectors find their own material and keep careful records, or buy only &quot;specimen shells&quot;, which means shells which have full collecting data: information including how, when, where, in what habitat, and by whom, the shells were collected. On the other hand, some collectors buy the more widely available commercially imported exotic shells, the majority of which have very little data, or none at all. To museum scientists, having full collecting data (when, where, and by whom it was collected) with a specimen is far more important than having the shell correctly identified. Some owners of shell collections hope to be able to donate their collection to a major natural history or zoology museum at some point, however, shells with little or no collecting data are usually of no value to science, and are likely not to be accepted by a major museum. Apart from any damage to the shell that may have happened &quot;before&quot; it was collected, shells can also suffer damage when they are stored or displayed. For an example of one rather serious kind of damage see Byne&#x27;s disease.

==== Shell clubs ====
There are a number of clubs or societies which consist of people who are united by a shared interest in shells. In the US, these clubs are more common in southerly coastal areas, such as Florida and California, where the marine fauna is rich in species.

==== Identification ====

Seashells are usually identified by consulting general or regional shell-collecting field guides, and specific scientific books on different taxa of shell-bearing mollusks (monographs) or &quot;iconographies&quot; (limited text – mainly photographs or other illustrations). (For a few titles on this subject in the US, see the list of books at the foot of this article.) Identifications to the species level are generally achieved by examining illustrations and written descriptions, rather than by the use of Identification keys, as is often the case in identifying plants and other phyla of invertebrates. The construction of functional keys for the identification of the shells of marine mollusks to the species level can be very difficult, because of the great variability within many species and families. The identification of certain individual species is often very difficult, even for a specialist in that particular family. Some species cannot be differentiated on the basis of shell character alone.

Numerous smaller and more obscure mollusk species (see micromollusk) are yet to be discovered and named. In other words, they have not yet been differentiated from similar species and assigned scientific (binomial) names in articles in journals recognized by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). Large numbers of new species are published in the scientific literature each year. There are currently an estimated 100,000 species of mollusks worldwide.

==== Non-marine &quot;seashells&quot; ====
The term &quot;seashell&quot; is also applied loosely to mollusk shells that are not of marine origin, for example by people walking the shores of lakes and rivers using the term for the freshwater mollusk shells they encounter. Seashells purchased from tourist shops or dealers may include various freshwater and terrestrial shells as well. Non-marine items offered may include large and colorful tropical land snail shells, freshwater apple snail shells, and pearly freshwater unionid mussel shells. This can be confusing to collectors, as non-marine shells are often not included in their reference books.

=== Cultural significance ===

==== Currency ====
Seashells have been used as a medium of exchange in various places, including many Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean islands, also in North America, Africa and the Caribbean.

* The most common species of shells to be used as currency have been &quot;Monetaria moneta&quot;, the &quot;money cowry&quot;, and certain dentalium tusk shells, used in North Western North America for many centuries.
* Many of the tribes and nations all across the continent of Africa have historically used the cowry as their media of exchange. The cowry circulated, historically, alongside metal coins and goods, and foreign currencies. Being durable and easy to carry the cowry made a very favorable currency.
* Some tribes of the indigenous peoples of the Americas used shells for wampum and hair pipes. The Native American &quot;wampum belts&quot; were made of the shell of the quahog clam.

==== Tools ====
Seashells have often been used as tools, because of their strength and the variety of their shapes.
* Giant clams (Family Tridacnidae) have been used as bowls, and when big enough, even as bathtubs and baptismal fonts.
* &quot;Melo melo&quot;, the &quot;bailer volute&quot;, is so named because Native Australians used it to bail out their canoes.
* Many different species of bivalves have been used as scrapers, blades, clasps, and other such tools, due to their shape.
* Some marine gastropods have been used for oil lamps, the oil being poured in the aperture of the shell, and the siphonal canal serving as a holder for the wick.

==== Horticulture ====
Because seashells are in some areas a readily available bulk source of calcium carbonate, shells such as oyster shells are sometimes used as soil conditioners in horticulture. The shells are broken or ground into small pieces in order to have the desired effect of raising the pH and increasing the calcium content in the soil.

==== Religion and spirituality ====

Seashells have played a part in religion and spirituality, sometimes even as ritual objects.
* In Christianity, the scallop shell is considered to be the symbol of Saint James the Great, see &quot;Pecten jacobaeus&quot;.
* In Hinduism, left-handed shells of &quot;Turbinella pyrum&quot; (the sacred shankha) are considered to be sacred to the god Vishnu. The person who finds a left-handed chank shell (one that coils to the left) is sacred to Vishnu, as well. The chank shell also plays an important role in Buddhism.
* Cowries have often been considered to be symbols of female fertility. They were often treated as actual fertility charms. The dorsum of the shell resembles a pregnant belly, and the underside of the shell resembles a vulva. In the South Indian state of Kerala, cowries are used for making astrological predictions.
* In the Santería religion, shells are used for divination.
* The Moche culture of ancient Peru worshipped animals and the sea, and often depicted shells in their art.
* In Christianity, the top of the sand dollar represents the Star of Bethlehem that led the Wise Men to the manger of Christ. Outside the &quot;star&quot; you will see the Easter Lily, a sign of Jesus&#x27; Resurrection. There are four holes that represent the holes in the Lord&#x27;s hands and feet. The center hole is the Wound to His Sacred Heart by the spear of Longinus. On the other side of the sand dollar, you will see Poinsettia. Lastly, if you break open the sand dollar, five doves will come out, the doves of Peace and Joy.

==== Musical instruments ====


Seashells have been used as musical instruments, wind instruments for many hundreds if not thousands of years. Most often the shells of large sea snails are used, as trumpets, by cutting a hole in the spire of the shell or cutting off the tip of the spire altogether. Various different kinds of large marine gastropod shells can be turned into &quot;blowing shells&quot;; however, the most commonly encountered species used as &quot;conch&quot; trumpets are:
* The sacred chank, &quot;Turbinella pyrum&quot;, known in India as the shankha. In Tibet it is known as &quot;dung-dkar&quot;.
* The Triton shell also known as &quot;Triton&#x27;s trumpet&quot; &quot;Charonia tritonis&quot; which is used as a trumpet in Melanesian and Polynesian culture and also in Korea and Japan. In Japan this kind of trumpet is known as the horagai. In Korea it is known as the nagak. In some Polynesian islands it is known as &quot;pu&quot;.
* The Queen Conch &quot;Lobatus gigas&quot;, has been used as a trumpet in the Caribbean.

Children in some cultures are often told the myth that you can hear the sound of the ocean by holding a seashell to ones ear. This is due to the effect of seashell resonance.

==== Personal adornment ====
Whole seashells or parts of sea shells have been used as jewelry or in other forms of adornment since prehistoric times. Mother of pearl was historically primarily a seashell product, although more recently some mother of pearl comes from freshwater mussels. Also see pearl.
* Shell necklaces have been found in Stone Age graves as far inland as the Dordogne Valley in France.
* Seashells are often used whole and drilled, so that they can be threaded like beads, or cut into pieces of various shapes. Sometimes shells can be found that are already &quot;drilled&quot; by predatory snails of the family Naticidae. Fine whole shell necklaces were made by Tasmanian Aboriginal women for more than 2,600 years. The necklaces represent a significant cultural tradition which is still practised by Palawa women elders. The shells used include pearly green and blue-green maireener (rainbow kelp) shells, brown and white rice shells, black cats&#x27; teeth shells and pink button shells.
* Naturally-occurring, beachworn, cone shell &quot;tops&quot; (the broken-off spire of the shell, which often has a hole worn at the tip) can function as beads without any further modification. In Hawaii these natural beads were traditionally collected from the beach drift in order to make puka shell jewelry. Since it is hard to obtain large quantities of naturally-occurring beachworn cone tops, almost all modern puka shell jewelry uses cheaper imitations, cut from thin shells of other species of mollusk, or even made of plastic.
* Shells historically have been and still are made into, or incorporated into, necklaces, pendants, beads, earrings, buttons, brooches, rings, hair combs, belt buckles and other uses.
* The shell of the large &quot;bullmouth helmet&quot; sea snail, scientific name &quot;Cypraecassis rufa&quot;, was historically, and still is, used to make valuable cameos.
* Mother of pearl from many seashells including species in the family Trochidae, Turbinidae, Haliotidae, and various pearly bivalves, has often been used in jewelry, buttons, etc.
* In London, Pearly Kings and Queens traditionally wear clothing covered in patterns made up of hundreds of &quot;pearl buttons&quot;, in other words, buttons made of mother-of-pearl or nacre. In recent years however, the majority of &quot;pearl buttons&quot; are imitations that are made of pearlescent plastic.

==== Creating Crafts ====
&quot;Sailor&#x27;s Valentines&quot; were late 19th-century decorative keepsakes which were made from the Caribbean, and which were often purchased by sailors to give to their loved ones back home for example in England. These valentines consisted of elaborate arrangements of small seashells glued into attractive symmetrical designs, which were encased on a wooden (usually octagonal) hinged box-frame. The patterns used often featured heart-shaped designs, or included a sentimental expression of love spelled out in small shells.

The making of shell work artifacts is a practice of Aboriginal women from La Perouse in Sydney, dating back to the 19th century. Shell work objects include baby shoes, jewelry boxes and replicas of famous landmarks, including the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House. The shellwork tradition began as an Aboriginal women&#x27;s craft which was adapted and tailored to suit the tourist souvenir market, and which is now considered high art.

==== Architectural decoration ====
Small pieces of colored and iridescent shell have been used to create mosaics and inlays, which have been used to decorate walls, furniture and boxes. Large numbers of whole seashells, arranged to form patterns, have been used to decorate mirror frames, furniture and human-made shell grottos.

==== Art ====

A very large outdoor sculpture at Akkulam of a gastropod seashell is a reference to the sacred chank shell &quot;Turbinella pyrum&quot; of India. In 2003, Maggi Hambling designed a striking 13 ft (4 m) high sculpture of a scallop shell which stands on the beach at Aldeburgh, in England. The goddess of love, Venus or Aphrodite, is often traditionally depicted rising from the sea on a seashell. In &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot;, Botticelli depicted the goddess Venus rising from the ocean on a scallop shell.

==== Poultry feeds ====
Sea shells found in the creek and backwater of the coast of west India are used as an additive to poultry feed. They are crushed and mixed with jowar maize and dry fish.

=== Use ===
Seashells, namely from bivalves and gastropods, are fundamentally composed of calcium carbonate. In this sense, they have potential to be used as raw material in the production of lime.

 Along the Gulf Coast of the United States, oyster shells were mixed into cement to make &quot;shellcrete&quot; which could form bricks, blocks and platforms. It could also be applied over logs. A notable example is the 19th-century Sabine Pass Lighthouse in Louisiana, near Texas.

== Shells of other marine invertebrates ==
=== Arthropods ===

Many arthropods have sclerites, or hardened body parts, which form a stiff exoskeleton made up mostly of chitin. In crustaceans, especially those of the class Malacostraca (crabs, shrimps and lobsters, for instance), the plates of the exoskeleton may be fused to form a more or less rigid carapace. Moulted carapaces of a variety of marine malacostraceans often wash up on beaches. The horseshoe crab is an arthropod of the family Limulidae. The shells or exuviae of these arachnid relatives are common in beach drift in certain areas of the world.

=== Echinoderms ===

Some echinoderms such as sea urchins, including heart urchins and sand dollars, have a hard &quot;test&quot; or shell. After the animal dies, the flesh rots out and the spines fall off, and then fairly often the empty test washes up whole onto a beach, where it can be found by a beachcomber. These tests are fragile and easily broken into pieces.

=== Brachiopods ===

The brachiopods, or lamp shells, superficially resemble clams, but the phylum is not closely related to mollusks. Most lines of brachiopods ended during the Permian-Triassic extinction event, and their ecological niche was filled by bivalves. A few of the remaining species of brachiopods occur in the low intertidal zone and thus can be found live by beachcombers.

=== Annelids ===
Some polychaetes, marine annelid worms in the family Serpulidae, secrete a hard tube made of calcium carbonate, adhering to stones or other shells. This tube resembles, and can be confused with, the shell of marine gastropod mollusks in the family Vermetidae, the worm snails.

== Atypical shells ==
A few other categories of marine animals leave remains which might be considered &quot;seashells&quot; in the widest possible sense of the word.

=== Chelonians ===
Sea turtles have a carapace and plastron of bone and cartilage which is developed from their ribs. Infrequently a turtle &quot;shell&quot; will wash up on a beach.

=== Hard corals ===
Pieces of the hard skeleton of corals commonly wash up on beaches in areas where corals grow.

The construction of the shell-like structures of corals are aided by a symbiotic relationship with a class of algae, zooxanthellae. Typically a coral polyp will harbor particular species of algae, which will photosynthesise and thereby provide energy for the coral and aid in calcification, while living in a safe environment and using the carbon dioxide and nitrogenous waste produced by the polyp. Coral bleaching is a disruption of the balance between polyps and algae, and can lead to the breakdown and death of coral reefs.

=== Soft corals ===

The skeletons of soft corals such as gorgonians, also known as sea fans and sea whips, commonly wash ashore in the tropics after storms.

=== Plankton and protists ===

Plant-like diatoms and animal-like radiolarians are two forms of plankton which form hard silicate shells. Foraminifera and coccolithophores create shells known as &quot;tests&quot; which are made of calcium carbonate. These shells and tests are usually microscopic in size, though in the case of foraminifera, they are sometimes visible to the naked eye, often resembling miniature mollusk shells.

<text>XML-RPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol which uses XML to encode its calls and HTTP as a transport mechanism.

==History==
The XML-RPC protocol was created in 1998 by Dave Winer of UserLand Software and Microsoft, with Microsoft seeing the protocol as an essential part of scaling up its efforts in business-to-business e-commerce. As new functionality was introduced, the standard evolved into what is now SOAP.

UserLand supported XML-RPC from version 5.1 of its Frontier web content management system, released in June 1998.

XML-RPC&#x27;s idea of a human-readable-and-writable, script-parsable standard for HTTP-based requests and responses has also been implemented in competing specifications such as Allaire&#x27;s Web Distributed Data Exchange (WDDX) and webMethod&#x27;s Web Interface Definition Language (WIDL). Prior art wrapping COM, CORBA, and Java RMI objects in XML syntax and transporting them via HTTP also existed in DataChannel&#x27;s WebBroker technology.

The generic use of XML for remote procedure call (RPC) was patented by Phillip Merrick, Stewart Allen, and Joseph Lapp in April 2006, claiming benefit to a provisional application filed in March 1998. The patent was assigned to webMethods, located in Fairfax, Virginia. The patent expired on March 23, 2019.

==Usage==
In XML-RPC, a client performs an RPC by sending an HTTP request to a server that implements XML-RPC and receives the HTTP response. A call can have multiple parameters and one result. The protocol defines a few data types for the parameters and result. Some of these data types are complex, i.e. nested. For example, you can have a parameter that is an array of five integers.

The parameters/result structure and the set of data types are meant to mirror those used in common programming languages.

&quot;Identification&quot; of clients for authorization purposes can be achieved using popular HTTP security methods. Basic access authentication can be used for identification and authentication.

In comparison to RESTful protocols, where &quot;resource representations&quot; (documents) are transferred, XML-RPC is designed to &quot;call methods&quot;. The practical difference is just that XML-RPC is much more structured, which means common library code can be used to implement clients and servers and there is less design and documentation work for a specific application protocol. One salient technical difference between typical RESTful protocols and XML-RPC is that many RESTful protocols use the HTTP URI for parameter information, whereas with XML-RPC, the URI just identifies the server.

JSON-RPC is similar to XML-RPC.

==Data types==
Common datatypes are converted into their XML equivalents with example values shown below:
==Examples==
An example of a typical XML-RPC request would be:

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;methodCall&gt;
 &lt;methodName&gt;examples.getStateName&lt;/methodName&gt;
 &lt;params&gt;
 &lt;param&gt;
 &lt;value&gt;&lt;i4&gt;40&lt;/i4&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
 &lt;/param&gt;
 &lt;/params&gt;
&lt;/methodCall&gt;
An example of a typical XML-RPC response would be:

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;methodResponse&gt;
 &lt;params&gt;
 &lt;param&gt;
 &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;South Dakota&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
 &lt;/param&gt;
 &lt;/params&gt;
&lt;/methodResponse&gt;
A typical XML-RPC fault would be:

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;methodResponse&gt;
 &lt;fault&gt;
 &lt;value&gt;
 &lt;struct&gt;
 &lt;member&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;faultCode&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;value&gt;&lt;int&gt;4&lt;/int&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
 &lt;/member&gt;
 &lt;member&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;faultString&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;Too many parameters.&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
 &lt;/member&gt;
 &lt;/struct&gt;
 &lt;/value&gt;
 &lt;/fault&gt;
&lt;/methodResponse&gt;
== Criticism ==
Recent critics (from 2010 and onwards) of XML-RPC argue that RPC calls can be made with plain XML, and that XML-RPC does not add any value over XML. Both XML-RPC and XML require an application-level data model, such as which field names are defined in the XML schema or the parameter names in XML-RPC. Furthermore, XML-RPC uses about 4 times the number of bytes compared to plain XML to encode the same objects, which is itself verbose compared to JSON.

<doc id="80857" wikidata="Q217616" url="?curid=80857" title="Meromorphic function">
<text>In the mathematical field of complex analysis, a meromorphic function on an open subset &quot;D&quot; of the complex plane is a function that is holomorphic on all of &quot;D&quot; &quot;except&quot; for a set of isolated points, which are poles of the function. The term comes from the Greek &quot;meros&quot; (), meaning &quot;part&quot;.

Every meromorphic function on &quot;D&quot; can be expressed as the ratio between two holomorphic functions (with the denominator not constant 0) defined on &quot;D&quot;: any pole must coincide with a zero of the denominator.
==Heuristic description==
Intuitively, a meromorphic function is a ratio of two well-behaved (holomorphic) functions. Such a function will still be well-behaved, except possibly at the points where the denominator of the fraction is zero. If the denominator has a zero at &quot;z&quot; and the numerator does not, then the value of the function will approach infinity; if both parts have a zero at &quot;z&quot;, then one must compare the multiplicity of these zeros.

From an algebraic point of view, if the function&#x27;s domain is connected, then the set of meromorphic functions is the field of fractions of the integral domain of the set of holomorphic functions. This is analogous to the relationship between the rational numbers and the integers.

==Prior, alternate use==
Both the field of study wherein the term is used and the precise meaning of the term changed in the 20th century. In the 1930s, in group theory, a &quot;meromorphic function&quot; (or &quot;meromorph&quot;) was a function from a group &quot;G&quot; into itself that preserved the product on the group. The image of this function was called an &quot;automorphism&quot; of &quot;G&quot;. Similarly, a &quot;homomorphic function&quot; (or &quot;homomorph&quot;) was a function between groups that preserved the product, while a &quot;homomorphism&quot; was the image of a homomorph. This form of the term is now obsolete, and the related term &quot;meromorph&quot; is no longer used in group theory.
The term &quot;endomorphism&quot; is now used for the function itself, with no special name given to the image of the function.

A meromorphic function is not necessarily an endomorphism, since the complex points at its poles are not in its domain, but may be in its range.

==Properties==
Since poles are isolated, there are at most countably many for a meromorphic function. The set of poles can be infinite, as exemplified by the function formula_1

By using analytic continuation to eliminate removable singularities, meromorphic functions can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and the quotient formula_2 can be formed unless formula_3 on a connected component of &quot;D&quot;. Thus, if &quot;D&quot; is connected, the meromorphic functions form a field, in fact a field extension of the complex numbers.

===Higher dimensions===
In several complex variables, a meromorphic function is defined to be locally a quotient of two holomorphic functions. For example, formula_4 is a meromorphic function on the two-dimensional complex affine space. Here it is no longer true that every meromorphic function can be regarded as a holomorphic function with values in the Riemann sphere: There is a set of &quot;indeterminacy&quot; of codimension two (in the given example this set consists of the origin formula_5).

Unlike in dimension one, in higher dimensions there do exist compact complex manifolds on which there are no non-constant meromorphic functions, for example, most complex tori.

==Examples==
* All rational functions, for example formula_6 are meromorphic on the whole complex plane. Furthermore, they are the only meromorphic functions on the extended complex plane.
* The functions formula_7 as well as the gamma function and the Riemann zeta function are meromorphic on the whole complex plane.
* The function formula_8 is defined in the whole complex plane except for the origin, 0. However, 0 is not a pole of this function, rather an essential singularity. Thus, this function is not meromorphic in the whole complex plane. However, it is meromorphic (even holomorphic) on formula_9.
* The complex logarithm function formula_10 is not meromorphic on the whole complex plane, as it cannot be defined on the whole complex plane while only excluding a set of isolated points.
* The function formula_11 is not meromorphic in the whole plane, since the point formula_12 is an accumulation point of poles and is thus not an isolated singularity.
* The function formula_13 is not meromorphic either, as it has an essential singularity at 0.

==On Riemann surfaces==
On a Riemann surface, every point admits an open neighborhood
which is biholomorphic to an open subset of the complex plane. Thereby the notion of a meromorphic function can be defined for every Riemann surface.

When &quot;D&quot; is the entire Riemann sphere, the field of meromorphic functions is simply the field of rational functions in one variable over the complex field, since one can prove that any meromorphic function on the sphere is rational. (This is a special case of the so-called GAGA principle.)

For every Riemann surface, a meromorphic function is the same as a holomorphic function that maps to the Riemann sphere and which is not the constant function equal to ∞. The poles correspond to those complex numbers which are mapped to ∞.

On a non-compact Riemann surface, every meromorphic function can be realized as a quotient of two (globally defined) holomorphic functions. In contrast, on a compact Riemann surface, every holomorphic function is constant, while there always exist non-constant meromorphic functions.

<text>In packed pixel or chunky framebuffer organization, the bits defining each pixel are clustered and stored consecutively. For example, if there are 16 bits per pixel, each pixel is represented in two consecutive (contiguous) 8-bit bytes in the framebuffer. If there are 4 bits per pixel, each framebuffer byte defines two pixels, one in each nibble. The latter example is as opposed to storing a single 4-bit pixel in a byte, leaving 4 bits of the byte unused. If a pixel has more than one channel, the channels are interleaved when using packed pixel organization.

Packed pixel displays were common on early microcomputer system that shared a single main memory for both the central processing unit (CPU) and display driver. In such systems, memory was normally accessed a byte at a time, so by packing the pixels, the display system could read out several pixels worth of data in a single read operation.

Packed pixel is one of two major ways to organize graphics data in memory, the other being planar organization, where each pixel is made of individual bits stored in their own plane. For a 4-bit color value, memory would be organized as four screen-sized planes of one bit each and a single pixel&#x27;s value built up by selecting the appropriate bit from each plane. Planar organization has the advantage that the data can be accessed in parallel, and is used when memory bandwidth is an issue.

<text>In complex analysis, an essential singularity of a function is a &quot;severe&quot; singularity near which the function exhibits striking behavior. 

The category &quot;essential singularity&quot; is a &quot;left-over&quot; or default group of isolated singularities that are especially unmanageable: by definition they fit into neither of the other two categories of singularity that may be dealt with in some manner – removable singularities and poles. In practice some include non-isolated singularities too; those do not have a residue.

==Formal description==
Consider an open subset formula_1 of the complex plane formula_2. Let formula_3 be an element of formula_1, and formula_5 a holomorphic function. The point formula_3 is called an &quot;essential singularity&quot; of the function formula_7 if the singularity is neither a pole nor a removable singularity.

For example, the function formula_8 has an essential singularity at formula_9.

==Alternative descriptions==
Let formula_3 be a complex number, and assume that formula_11 is not defined at formula_3 but is analytic in some region formula_1 of the complex plane, and that every open neighbourhood of formula_3 has non-empty intersection with formula_1. 

:If both formula_16 and formula_17 exist, then formula_3 is a &quot;removable singularity&quot; of both formula_7 and formula_20. 

:If formula_16 exists but formula_17 does not exist (in fact formula_23), then formula_3 is a &quot;zero&quot; of formula_7 and a &quot;pole&quot; of formula_20.

:Similarly, if formula_16 does not exist (in fact formula_28) but formula_17 exists, then formula_3 is a &quot;pole&quot; of formula_7 and a &quot;zero&quot; of formula_20.

:If neither formula_16 nor formula_17 exists, then formula_3 is an essential singularity of both formula_7 and formula_20.

Another way to characterize an essential singularity is that the Laurent series of formula_7 at the point formula_3 has infinitely many negative degree terms (i.e., the principal part of the Laurent series is an infinite sum). A related definition is that if there is a point formula_3 for which no derivative of formula_41 converges to a limit as formula_42 tends to formula_3, then formula_3 is an essential singularity of formula_7.

On a Riemann sphere with a point at infinity, formula_46, the function formula_47 has an essential singularity at that point if and only if the formula_48 has an essential singularity at 0: i.e. neither formula_49 nor formula_50 exists. The Riemann zeta function on the Riemann sphere has only one essential singularity, at formula_46. Indeed, every meromorphic function aside that is not a rational function has a unique essential singularity at formula_46.

The behavior of holomorphic functions near their essential singularities is described by the Casorati–Weierstrass theorem and by the considerably stronger Picard&#x27;s great theorem. The latter says that in every neighborhood of an essential singularity formula_3, the function formula_7 takes on &quot;every&quot; complex value, except possibly one, infinitely many times. (The exception is necessary; for example, the function formula_55 never takes on the value 0.)

<text>Stone Temple Pilots, commonly abbreviated as STP, is an American rock band formed in San Diego, California, in 1989. Originally consisting of lead vocalist Scott Weiland, guitarist Dean DeLeo, bassist Robert DeLeo, and drummer Eric Kretz, the band&#x27;s lineup remained unchanged from its formation until the firing of Weiland in February 2013. Vocalist Chester Bennington joined the band in May 2013 but left amicably in November 2015. In 2016, STP launched an online audition for a new lead vocalist; Jeff Gutt was announced as STP&#x27;s new lead singer on November 14, 2017.

After forming under the name Mighty Joe Young, the band signed with Atlantic Records and changed its name to Stone Temple Pilots. Their debut album, &quot;Core&quot;, released in 1992, was a major commercial hit, and STP went on to become one of the most successful bands of the 1990s, selling more than 18 million albums in the United States and 40 million worldwide. STP released four more studio albums: &quot;Purple&quot; (1994), &quot;Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop&quot; (1996), &quot;No. 4&quot; (1999), and &quot;Shangri-La Dee Da&quot; (2001), before separating in 2003, after which the band members partook in various projects (most notably Velvet Revolver and Army of Anyone). STP eventually reconvened in 2008 for a reunion tour and released their self-titled sixth album in 2010. After firing Weiland in 2013, the band recruited Chester Bennington, who they would tour with as their lead vocalist up until his departure in 2015. The band&#x27;s only material with Bennington was the 2013 EP &quot;High Rise&quot;. STP has since released two albums with Gutt on vocals: its second self-titled album in 2018 and eighth studio album, &quot;Perdida&quot;, in 2020.

While initially rising to fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, further releases from the band explored a variety of styles, including psychedelic rock, bossa nova, and classic rock. STP&#x27;s evolution throughout the 1990s and early 2000s involved periods of commercial highs and lows, brought about in part by Weiland&#x27;s well-publicized struggles with drug addiction.

==History==
===1985–1992: Formation and early years as Mighty Joe Young===
In 1985, Scott Weiland and his friends in their band Soi Disant—guitarist Corey Hicock and drummer David Allin—first encountered Robert DeLeo playing live at various gigs, deciding to track him down after witnessing his shows. Weiland, DeLeo, Hicock and Allin would eventually form a band called Swing. Allin left after a few years. The remaining members saw drummer Eric Kretz play in a Long Beach club and convinced him to join them. Guitarist Hicock eventually left the band in 1989; in need of a replacement and auditioning many guitarists, Robert suggested his older brother, Dean. At the time, Dean was a successful businessman who had left behind his previous musical career but still played guitar as a hobby. The band managed to convince Dean to play for Swing, completing the original lineup. Shortly afterwards, the band changed its name to Mighty Joe Young. They recorded a demo tape around 1990. The Mighty Joe Young demo features tracks that would go on to be re-recorded for the band&#x27;s first studio album, as well as some musical styles that would not be featured on any of the band&#x27;s studio albums, such as funk and yodeling.

Mighty Joe Young played several gigs in the San Diego area, building up a fanbase. Their first show was supporting Henry Rollins at the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood. The group then began to work on their debut album with Brendan O&#x27;Brien. During the recording, they received a call from their lawyer who informed them that there was a bluesman who had already claimed the name Mighty Joe Young. Inspired by the STP Motor Oil stickers that the band members were fans of in their youth, various ideas on the initials &quot;STP&quot; were shared by the band before they settled on the name &quot;Stone Temple Pilots&quot;.

===1992–1995: &quot;Core&quot; and &quot;Purple&quot;===

Stone Temple Pilots developed a fan base in San Diego clubs and in 1992 signed with Atlantic Records. Their first album, &quot;Core,&quot; was released on September 29, 1992, and peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Albums Chart. &quot;Core&quot; was a big success, producing hits &quot;Sex Type Thing&quot;, &quot;Plush&quot;, &quot;Creep&quot;, and &quot;Wicked Garden&quot;. While the album was a major commercial success, some in the music press criticized the band as &quot;grunge imitators&quot;. The same year, Scott Weiland and Dean DeLeo played an acoustic version of &quot;Plush&quot; on the MTV show &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. This is considered one of Weiland&#x27;s greatest vocal performances. Despite negative reviews from some critics, Stone Temple Pilots continued to gain fans and toured, opening for bands such as Rage Against the Machine and Megadeth. 1993 brought continued success on the road, with the band headlining a two-and-a-half-month American tour.

In 1993, the band filmed an episode of &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, where they debuted the song &quot;Big Empty&quot;. In a January 1994 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; poll, the band was simultaneously voted Best New Band by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s readers and Worst New Band by the magazine&#x27;s music critics. The following month the group won Favorite Pop/Rock New Artist and Heavy Metal/Hard Rock New Artist at the American Music Awards. In March 1994, the group won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance for the song &quot;Plush&quot;. In the spring of 1994, Stone Temple Pilots returned to the studio to work on their second album, &quot;Purple.&quot; Completed in less than a month, &quot;Purple&quot; debuted at number one in the United States upon its release on June 7, 1994. The radio-friendly &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot; quickly became a big hit, spending a record-setting fifteen weeks atop the album rock tracks chart. Other hits from the album included &quot;Vasoline&quot; and &quot;Big Empty&quot; (the latter also being featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Crow&quot;). By October, just four months after its release, &quot;Purple&quot; had sold three million copies.

===1995–2003: &quot;Tiny Music,&quot; &quot;No. 4,&quot; and &quot;Shangri-La Dee Da&quot;===

In October 1995, the band regrouped to begin recording its third album, renting out a mansion in Santa Barbara, California for the band to live together during the recording process. Stone Temple Pilots released the album &quot;Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop&quot;, on March 5, 1996. The album&#x27;s sound marked a drastic change from their previous outings, oriented more in the direction of glam rock and psychedelic music than that of the hard rock/grunge sound that propelled them to popularity; critical reception, at the time, was mixed. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, a magazine known for its initial dismissal of the band&#x27;s music, held a favorable opinion of the album, regarding the release as the group&#x27;s best effort to date. They expressed surprise, however, at &quot;the clattering, upbeat character of the music&quot; given Weiland&#x27;s much-publicized run-ins with drugs and the law. Stone Temple Pilots were also featured on the cover of issue No. 753 in February 1997.

The band was only partially successful in being able to tour in support of &quot;Tiny Music...&quot; and pulled out of a support slot on Kiss&#x27; reunion tour. A short tour in the fall of 1996 ensued in the U.S. but final dates at the end of December in Hawaii and some dates in 1997 had to be cancelled in order for Weiland to go to rehab. The band then decided to take a break to work on other projects. Kiss drummer Peter Criss remarked, &quot;I can&#x27;t call the kettle black. I just pray for the guy and hope that he gets himself better because they really are a great band.&quot; Since Weiland, the band recruited Dave Coutts, the frontman of Ten Inch Men, and performed under the moniker Talk Show. Talk Show released one eponymous album in 1997 before dissolving. Meanwhile, pursuing his own musical interests, Weiland released his first solo album, &quot;12 Bar Blues,&quot; in 1998. Although both albums received moderate critical praise, neither was commercially successful.

In late 1998, the band regrouped and began work on a fourth Stone Temple Pilots album. Released in 1999, &quot;No. 4&quot; was conceived as a &quot;back-to-basics&quot; rock album in the vein of &quot;Core&quot; or &quot;Purple.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic compared the album&#x27;s sound to contemporary alternative metal bands and wrote in his review &quot;it&#x27;s as if STP decided to compete directly with the new generation of alt-metal bands who prize aggression over hooks or riffs.&quot; STP scored one of its biggest hits since the success of &quot;Core&quot; and &quot;Purple&quot; with the single &quot;Sour Girl&quot;, fueled by a popular music video starring Sarah Michelle Gellar of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; fame. The band also recorded an episode of &quot;VH1 Storytellers,&quot; and went on a summer tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. &quot;No. 4&quot; would eventually be certified platinum by the RIAA.

During the summer of 2001, the band released its fifth album, &quot;Shangri-La Dee Da&quot;, which produced one modest rock radio hit in &quot;Days of the Week&quot;. Despite promotion of the album by going on tour with Linkin Park on the Family Values Tour, &quot;Shangri-La Dee Da&quot; was a commercial disappointment. At that point, marketing support from their label was reportedly minimal, and the band decided to put a hold on any future albums. However, the band recorded &quot;All in the Suit That You Wear&quot;, a song intended to be the lead single on the soundtrack for the 2002 film &quot;Spider-Man.&quot; However, Chad Kroeger&#x27;s song &quot;Hero&quot; was ultimately chosen as the lead single.

===2003–2008: Separation and members&#x27; other projects===
Despite reports that the band had begun work on a sixth studio album in 2002, the band went quiet by the end of that year after reports of an altercation between Dean DeLeo and Weiland after the last show of Stone Temple Pilots&#x27; fall 2002 tour. As a capstone to the band&#x27;s career, Atlantic Records released a greatest hits album, &quot;Thank You,&quot; with a bonus DVD of archive material and music videos, in 2003. Five days after &quot;Thank You&quot; was released, the DeLeo brothers revealed in an interview with &quot;Guitar One&quot; that the band was officially done. Following the band&#x27;s dissolution, Weiland was recruited to join Velvet Revolver—a successful supergroup—where they released two albums, &quot;Contraband&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Libertad&quot; in 2007 before breaking up in 2008. Likewise, the DeLeo brothers formed the supergroup Army of Anyone with vocalist Richard Patrick of the industrial rock band Filter and session drummer Ray Luzier. The band released its self-titled album in 2006 before going on &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot; in 2007. Eric Kretz kept a lower profile during this time, operating his own studio, Bomb Shelter Studios, and drumming for the band Spiralarms.

===2008–2011: Reunion and self-titled album===

According to Dean DeLeo, steps toward a Stone Temple Pilots reformation started with a phone call from Weiland&#x27;s wife, Mary Forsberg. She invited the DeLeo brothers to play at a private beach party, which led to the reconciliation of Weiland and the DeLeo brothers. In 2007, Dean DeLeo and Weiland discussed a concert promoter&#x27;s offer to headline several summer festivals. Weiland subsequently left Velvet Revolver in April 2008 and the following month, Stone Temple Pilots announced they were reuniting for a 65-date North American tour. The group officially reunited for a private gig at the Houdini Mansion and held their first public show on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on May 1. Stone Temple Pilots toured throughout the summer and fall, headlining the Virgin Mobile Festival in Baltimore in August of that year as well as the 10th annual Voodoo Experience in New Orleans. The band&#x27;s six-month reunion tour wrapped up on Halloween 2008 in Pelham, Alabama.

After taking a short break to allow Weiland to support his second solo album, &quot;&quot;Happy&quot; in Galoshes&quot;, the band began producing their sixth studio album in mid-2009. The band also went on the road for a 13-date North American summer tour in 2009, taking place in-between the tours for Weiland&#x27;s second solo album. The band showcased new material at South by Southwest in 2010, and also appeared at England&#x27;s Download Festival 2010 in June, as well as at the Hurricane Festival and Southside Festival in Germany. The band appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; for the first time in ten years on May 19, performing the song &quot;Between the Lines&quot;. The band&#x27;s self-titled sixth album was released on May 25, 2010, debuting at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Towards the end of 2010, STP announced they were rescheduling several U.S. tour dates so that the band could take a &quot;short break&quot;. They toured Southeast Asia for the first time in 2011, playing in the Philippines (Manila), Singapore, and Indonesia (Jakarta). Following this, the band played successful shows in Australia, including sold-out performances in Sydney and Melbourne.

===2011–2013: Split with Weiland and legal proceedings===

In December 2011, Dean DeLeo told &quot;Rolling Stone,&quot; &quot;what I&#x27;d like to see happen is the band go out and do more intimate shows – really lovely theaters around the country.&quot; DeLeo also commented on a possible extended reissue of &quot;Core&quot; including live archived material, &quot;We have tons of live recordings from that era, and we didn&#x27;t multi-track record that stuff. There&#x27;s no fixes, so they&#x27;d sound incredible if we just master them.&quot; On January 2, 2012, Scott Weiland also commented on the 20th anniversary of &quot;Core,&quot; saying &quot;Well, we&#x27;re doing a lot of special things. [There&#x27;s] a lot of archival footage that we&#x27;re putting together, a coffee table book, hopefully a brand new album – so many ideas. A box set and then a tour, of course.&quot; On June 26, STP released its first-ever concert film, &quot;Alive in the Windy City,&quot; on DVD and Blu-ray. The performance was filmed at a sold-out show in March 2010 at the Riviera Theatre in Chicago.

From then on, the band began to experience problems, and suspicions were raised that tensions within the band had arisen once again. Despite the band&#x27;s claims that their fall tour would be celebrating the 20th anniversary of &quot;Core,&quot; this did not happen. On September 17, at a show in Abbotsford, British Columbia, the band arrived nearly two hours late, and cut their set 30 minutes short, angering many fans. The following day, the band released a brief statement announcing that that night&#x27;s show in Lethbridge, Alberta was cancelled due to Weiland being ordered to go on &quot;48 hours complete vocal rest due to strained vocal cords.&quot; On December 7, in response to a public declaration from Weiland that he was &quot;completely open&quot; to returning to Velvet Revolver and a radio DJ&#x27;s questions about the state of that band, Slash (Weiland&#x27;s former bandmate with Velvet Revolver) told Minneapolis/St. Paul radio station 93X that he had heard rumors Weiland had been fired from Stone Temple Pilots, citing this as a possible reason for Weiland&#x27;s eagerness to return to Velvet Revolver, something that he quickly dismissed. On February 27, 2013, Stone Temple Pilots fired Weiland, marking the band&#x27;s first lineup change. The firing was officially announced as Weiland left on tour with his solo band. Both parties issued lawsuits over the right to perform with the Stone Temple Pilots name; both were settled out of court, with the DeLeo brothers and Kretz retaining the rights to perform under the name.

===2013–2015: Chester Bennington era and Weiland&#x27;s death===
On May 18, 2013, the three remaining members of Stone Temple Pilots performed with Chester Bennington of Linkin Park, appearing as special guests at the 21st Annual KROQ Weenie Roast, and the May 19, 2013 Live 105 BFD festival near San Francisco, where they performed a new song, &quot;Out of Time&quot;. On May 19, 2013, STP released a free download of their new single &quot;Out of Time&quot; with Bennington now an official member. Bennington had exclaimed years before in interviews that being in Stone Temple Pilots was his lifelong dream. The new lineup performed again on May 30, 2013, at the MusiCares MAP Fund Benefit Concert in Los Angeles, California, and were joined by Weiland&#x27;s former bandmates Slash and Duff McKagan on stage to perform &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot;.

On July 15, 2013, STP announced that it would embark on a small tour in September with Filter as the opening act. Stone Temple Pilots released a five-track EP titled &quot;High Rise&quot; on October 8, 2013, through Play Pen, LLC, credited as &quot;Stone Temple Pilots with Chester Bennington&quot;. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Black Heart&quot;, was released through iHeartRadio on September 18, 2013. They officially dropped &quot;with Chester Bennington&quot; from their name in March 2015. On November 9, 2015, Bennington announced he was amicably leaving Stone Temple Pilots to focus more on Linkin Park. On December 3, 2015, Scott Weiland was found dead of an accidental overdose of alcohol, pills, and cocaine on his tour bus in Minnesota. Stone Temple Pilots released a statement noting his death in which they thanked him for his time with them and said he was &quot;gifted beyond words&quot;.

===2016–2018: New singer Jeff Gutt and second self-titled album===

In February 2016, Stone Temple Pilots launched an online audition for a new vocalist, stating, &quot;If you think you have what it takes to front this band, record with this band, and tour with this band, we would dig hearing from you.&quot;

On July 26, 2017, the band announced that a 25th anniversary edition of &quot;Core&quot; would be released on September 29, 2017. The reissue includes a 25th Anniversary box set, it includes a remastered version of the album, previously unreleased demos and b-sides, and parts of three live performances from 1993 (Castaic Lake Natural Amphitheater, Reading Festival, and &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;). In October 2017, Dean DeLeo said that the band&#x27;s search for a new vocalist was &quot;going great&quot;, and that the band is &quot;working on new material&quot;. On November 14, the band revealed that Jeff Gutt had been chosen as their new lead singer. On November 15, 2017, the band released the song, &quot;Meadow&quot;. On January 31, 2018, the band released a second single, &quot;Roll Me Under&quot;, and announced the release date of the album. The band&#x27;s second self-titled album was released on March 16, 2018. In mid-2018, the band embarked on a co-headlining tour with Bush and the Cult.

=== 2019–present: &quot;Perdida&quot; and continued touring with Gutt ===
On October 4, 2019, Eric Kretz told &quot;Loudwire&quot; that a new album was complete and includes a flute solo. On December 2, the band announced that their eighth studio album, &quot;Perdida&quot;, would be released on February 7, 2020, and would be &quot;an acoustic record largely recorded on vintage instruments&quot;. They continued to tour throughout the 2020s and co-headlined a summer U.S. tour with the band Live in 2024.

==Musical style==
The band&#x27;s sound is a blend of alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s with the hard rock of the 1970s, though the band is known for making each of their records possess a unique musical style, despite having the &quot;sonic blueprint&quot; of the band, as Robert DeLeo describes. Stone Temple Pilots have also been described as alternative metal.

Aerosmith was a large influence on the band, with Dean DeLeo acknowledging the band&#x27;s influence on songs such as &quot;Huckleberry Crumble&quot; off their 2010 self-titled record. Steven Tyler and Joe Perry joined the band onstage at a 1996 show in Madison Square Garden for renditions of the Aerosmith songs &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; and &quot;Lick and a Promise&quot;. All of the band members were Kiss fans during their childhood, and played shows at the Roseland Ballroom in 1993 appeared in Kiss-style makeup.

During the taping of their VH1 Storytellers performance, Weiland acknowledged artists such as the Rolling Stones, Neil Young, and Robert Plant as their musical heroes. The band has covered songs by artists such as the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, the Doors, Pink Floyd, James Brown, David Bowie, and Bob Marley both live and in the studio.

Early in their career, the band was considered to be a part of the grunge movement. Despite assertions by critics that their style in the early–mid 1990s was derived from contemporary artists such as Alice in Chains and Soundgarden, the band maintained that the similarities were coincidental, due in part to having the same musical idols growing up. Much of the comparison was directed at Weiland&#x27;s vocal style drawing similarities to that of Eddie Vedder&#x27;s. Weiland stated that his vocal style was influenced by Jim Morrison and David Bowie, who also served as his main fashion influence. Weiland has been called a chameleon due to his ability to change his vocal and fashion style.

Regarding the band&#x27;s musical evolution, Weiland commented in 2014 that &quot;with STP, we never stuck to it. We saw that even great movements only last a certain period of time and you don&#x27;t want to be pigeonholed, so we got into other things, like the Beatles were a big influence, glam was a big influence, and it morphed along the way. I&#x27;m proud of the legacy we created and where we stand among those other peers at the time.&quot;

Dean DeLeo uses heavily layered and distorted guitar playing, while bassist Robert DeLeo draws influence from genres such as rhythm and blues, lounge music, and ragtime. The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Core&quot; was a straightforward display of grunge.

After reconvening in the studio for their second album, &quot;Purple&quot;, the band&#x27;s style developed, taking influence from psychedelic rock, country music, and jangle pop. The band continued to diverge into various genres and influences; for example, songs like &quot;And So I Know&quot; on &quot;Tiny Music...&quot; have a distinct bossa nova sound. Regarding the evolution of the band&#x27;s sound, Weiland commented that &quot;the transformation from &quot;Core&quot; to where we ended up before we took that time off, when I started with Velvet Revolver, was enormous.&quot;

Weiland was the band&#x27;s primary lyricist. His style changed with the band&#x27;s evolution; much of the lyrics on &quot;Core&quot; were written about societal issues such as religion, abuse of power, and isolation. The band&#x27;s breakthrough single &quot;Sex Type Thing&quot; polarized critics with its lyrics, some interpreting it as advocacy of date rape. Weiland intended it as a feminist anthem, with its lyrics written in mockery of the narrator. As Weiland began to deal with substance abuse, his lyrics became more personal and intricate; songs like &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot; deal with his addiction&#x27;s tolls on his relationship with his then-wife, Janina. The lyrics of the band&#x27;s fourth album were written to provide closure to his marriage and addiction to heroin.

Following the band&#x27;s reunion in 2008, Weiland once again evolved as a songwriter, explaining: &quot;[In] the &#x27;90s, I was so overwhelmed with my heroin addiction, and so a lot of the stuff was just from my point of view. Now, I tend to look at some of the greats like Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. I look at their storytelling [and] I try to tell stories. Every song doesn&#x27;t have to be narcissistically written about how I feel on that day.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Core,&quot; certified 8× platinum by the RIAA, drove the band to popularity. Stone Temple Pilots went on to become one of the most commercially successful rock bands of the 1990s, selling 40 million records worldwide, including 17.5 million units in the United States, before their dissolution in 2003. The band has had 16 top ten singles on the Billboard rock charts, eight of which peaked at No. 1, and one No. 1 album for &quot;Purple&quot; in 1994. That same year, the band won a Grammy for &quot;Best Hard Rock Performance&quot; for the song &quot;Plush&quot; from the album &quot;Core&quot;. Stone Temple Pilots were also ranked No. 40 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.

Despite being unpopular with critics in their heyday, Stone Temple Pilots have proven to be a popular and influential act. In retrospect, MTV writer James Montgomery published an article questioning the validity of music critics&#x27; opinions of the band during the 90s, saying, &quot;All I&#x27;m suggesting is that perhaps it&#x27;s time to admit that we were wrong about them from the get-go—that we treated them unfairly.&quot; In a review of the band&#x27;s 2003 greatest hits collection &quot;Thank You,&quot; AllMusic critic Stephen Erlewine wrote that &quot;STP made music that sounded great at the time and even better now&quot;, and that &quot;this music has stood the test of time&quot;, calling &quot;Thank You&quot; &quot;nearly perfect&quot;. Erlewine also wrote that &quot;STP was the best straight-ahead rock singles outfit of their time.&quot;

After the death of Scott Weiland, Smashing Pumpkins singer Billy Corgan paid official tribute to the band and musician, calling him one of the greatest voices of their generation:
&lt;poem&gt;&quot;It was, I&#x27;d guess you&#x27;d say, my way of apology for having been so critical of STP when they appeared on the scene like some crazy, man-fueled rocket. And not only was the knight up front freshly handsome to a fault, but he could sing too! As any supreme actor gives a real and different voice to each character played. It was STP&#x27;s 3rd album that had got me hooked, a wizardly mix of glam and post-punk, and I confessed to Scott, as well as the band many times, how wrong I&#x27;d been in assessing their native brilliance. And like Bowie can and does, it was Scott&#x27;s phrasing that pushed his music into a unique, and hard to pin down, aesthetic sonicsphere. Lastly, I&#x27;d like to share a thought which though clumsy, I hope would please Scott In Hominum. And that is if you asked me who I truly believed were the great voices of our generation, I&#x27;d say it were he, Layne, and Kurt.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

Media outlets reported on Weiland&#x27;s death stating he was a &quot;powerful voice&quot; with a &quot;mercurial vocal style&quot; during his time with the Stone Temple Pilots.

On December 3, 2016, STP posted a tribute on their website to mark the first anniversary of Weiland&#x27;s death. In 2017, Metal Injection ranked Stone Temple Pilots at number 9 on their list of &quot;10 Heaviest Grunge Bands&quot;.

<doc id="80867" wikidata="Q1430706" url="?curid=80867" title="Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road">
<text>Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road is a graphic adventure video game released by LucasArts during the company&#x27;s adventure games era. The game was originally released for MS-DOS in 1993 and for Mac OS in 1995. A 2002 re-release included compatibility with Windows. The game is based on the comic characters of Sam and Max, the &quot;Freelance Police&quot;, an anthropomorphic dog and &quot;hyperkinetic rabbity thing&quot;. The characters, created by Steve Purcell, originally debuted in a 1987 comic book series. Based on the 1989 &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; comic &quot;On the Road&quot;, the duo take the case of a missing bigfoot from a nearby carnival, traveling to many American culture tourist sites to solve the mystery.

LucasArts began development of the game in 1992 with the intention to use new settings and characters after the success of the past &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; and &quot;Monkey Island&quot; adventure titles. Series creator Steve Purcell, then a LucasArts employee, was one of the lead designers on the project. &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; is the ninth game to use the SCUMM adventure game engine, and also integrated the iMUSE audio system developed by Michael Land and Peter McConnell. The game was one of the first to incorporate full voice talent; the two title characters were voiced by professional voice actors Bill Farmer and Nick Jameson while additional voices were provided by Irwin Keyes, Marsha Clark, Denny Delk, Tony Pope and Beth Wernick.

The game received critical acclaim on release, and was praised for its humor, voice acting, graphics, music and gameplay. It is now regarded as a classic adventure game and is often considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Several attempts to produce sequels were cancelled, ultimately resulting in the franchise moving from LucasArts to Telltale Games. Since October 2014, after the acquisition of LucasArts by Disney, the game is being sold by GOG.com. The game was re-released on Steam by Disney Interactive in November 2018.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; is a 2D adventure game where the player controls the actions of Sam from a third-person perspective. The player uses Sam to explore the pre-rendered cartoon environments of the game and solve a series of puzzles using a simple point-and-click interface. The game&#x27;s puzzles have logical solutions, although a number of them have far-fetched solutions due to the game&#x27;s cartoon setting. Players can set the game&#x27;s cursor in a particular mode to designate how Sam interacts with the environment: Sam can walk around an area, talk to other characters, look at objects, pick them up or otherwise try to use them. The cursor&#x27;s graphic changes when it is hovered over an in-game entity that Sam can interact with. When talking to another character, the player is given a choice of subject areas to discuss, depicted in a conversation tree as icons at the base of the screen. In addition to specific topics involving the game&#x27;s plot, Sam can inject unconnected exclamations, questions and non sequiturs into a conversation.

The game incorporates an inventory system for items that Sam picks up during the course of the game. Items can be used on other entities in the game world, or can often be combined with other inventory items to provide a new object necessary for solving a puzzle. Although Max&#x27;s character will walk around the game&#x27;s areas by his own will, Sam can also use Max at various points by using an inventory icon of Max&#x27;s head on game objects—usually on characters where the solution to a problem involves violence. Sam and Max travel to different locations in the game using their black and white 1960 DeSoto Adventurer, which when clicked on in-game will present a map of the United States with all the available locations the pair can travel to shown. As the game progresses, the number of locations on the map increases.

In addition to the main game, &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; includes several minigames. Some of these, such as a carnival game based on Whac-A-Mole but involving live rats, must be completed in order to receive new items and further the game&#x27;s plot, while others, such as a car-themed version of Battleship, are entirely optional as to whether the player uses them. As with the majority of LucasArts adventure games, &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; is designed so that the player characters cannot die or reach a complete dead-end.

==Plot==
Sam and Max, the Freelance Police, are two comic book characters created by Steve Purcell, who act as private detectives and vigilantes. &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; follows the pair on a case that takes them from their office in New York City across the United States. The game starts in a similar way to many of the comic stories, with Sam and Max receiving a telephone call from an unseen and unheard Commissioner, who tells them to go to a nearby carnival. At the carnival, they are told by the owners that their star attraction, a frozen bigfoot called Bruno, has been set free, and fled, taking their second attraction, Trixie the Giraffe-Necked Girl. Sam and Max set off to find Bruno and Trixie and bring them back. As the duo investigate the carnival, they learn that Bruno and Trixie are in love and that Trixie freed Bruno. The Freelance Police leave the carnival to pursue leads at various tourist traps throughout the country, such as The World&#x27;s Largest Ball of Twine, a vortex controlled by giant subterranean magnets, and bungee jumping facilities at Mount Rushmore.

The pair learn that two other bigfoots used as tourist attractions in other parts of the country have been freed by Bruno, and that Bruno has been captured by Liverpudlian country western singer Conroy Bumpus, a cruel animal abuser who wishes to use Bruno in his performances. Sam and Max travel to Bumpus&#x27; home and rescue Bruno and Trixie, but Bruno then departs with Trixie to join a bigfoot gathering at an inn in Nevada. Following them, Sam and Max disguise themselves as a bigfoot to enter the party. Eventually the party is gatecrashed by Conroy Bumpus and his henchman Lee Harvey, who hope to capture the bigfoots. However, Sam manages to fool Bumpus and Harvey into donning their bigfoot disguise, and Max locks them in the inn&#x27;s kitchen freezer.

Chief Vanuatu, leader of the bigfoots, in recognition of the pair&#x27;s actions, makes the Freelance Police members of the bigfoot tribe and tells them of a spell that will make the world safe for bigfoots again, preventing their capture by humans. However, the chief requires help deciphering the spell&#x27;s four ingredients, and asks for Sam and Max&#x27;s help. Eventually, they discover that the ingredients are a vegetable resembling John Muir, hair restoration tonic, the tooth of a dinosaur (or one from a mechanical one as is used), and a vortex contained within a snow globe. Combined with a live bigfoot sacrifice—which Max substitutes for frozen bigfoot-clad Bumpus and Harvey—the ingredients cause large trees to spring into existence, destroying towns and cities and covering the bulk of the west United States in forest. Content that their work is done, Sam and Max take the frozen ice block containing Bumpus and Harvey to the carnival. Believing that Bruno has been returned to them, the owners give a large reward of skee ball tickets to the Freelance Police, who then spend the end credits shooting targets at a carnival stall with real firearms.

==Development==
&quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; was developed by a small team at LucasArts with prior experience on their adventure games, including Sean Clark, Michael Stemmle, and &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; creator Steve Purcell and his future wife Collette Michaud. Prior to being employed at LucasArts, Steve Purcell had developed the Sam &amp; Max characters and started publishing stories about them around 1987. These had caught attention of some of the LucasArts developers; through a suggestion that LucasArts artist Ken Macklin, Purcell was brought into the team by art director Gary Winnick. Purcell helped to draw the cover art for &quot;Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders&quot;, then helped with the character animations in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&quot;. Sam and Max first appeared as video game characters as internal testing material for SCUMM engine programmers recently employed by LucasArts; Steve Purcell created animated versions of the characters and an office backdrop for the programmers to practice on. Soon after, &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; comic strips by Steve Purcell were published in LucasArts&#x27; quarterly newsletter. After a positive reaction from fans to the strips and out of a wish to use new characters and settings after the success of the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; franchises, LucasArts offered in 1992 to create a video game out of the characters.

The game was based on the 1989 &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; comic &quot;On The Road&quot;, which featured the two on a journey across the United States. Several of the game&#x27;s tourist traps were based on real locations experienced by the developers; Steve Purcell recollects a childhood visit to a &quot;Frog Rock&quot; - one of the locations featured in the game - and remembered thinking &quot;That&#x27;s it? It doesn&#x27;t even look like a frog!&quot; A chain of &quot;Snuckey&#x27;s&quot; roadside stores and attractions was a tribute to the Stuckey&#x27;s chain which Purcell and his family often stopped at during road trips.

LucasArts planned a relatively short timetable for &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; of about eight months, and the team opted to use storyboarding for the first time at LucasArts to plan out the game. &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; was one of the first games to include a full speech soundtrack and music, which for Steve Purcell was a &quot;dream opportunity&quot; to hear his creations speak. Steve Purcell describes casting Bill Farmer in the role of Sam as his audition tape &quot;was very dry; he wasn&#x27;t trying too hard to sell the lines&quot;. Actor Nick Jameson was cast to voice Max. The game&#x27;s jazz score was composed by LucasArts&#x27; Clint Bajakian, Michael Land and Peter McConnell, and was incorporated into the game using Land and McConnell&#x27;s iMUSE engine, which allowed for audio to be synchronized with the visuals. High quality versions of four of the game&#x27;s tracks were included on the CD version of the game. &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; was released simultaneously on floppy disk and CD-ROM; only the CD version of the game contained full in-game speech and music. 

As the &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; comics had a more adult tone, Steve Purcell expected LucasArts to cut back &quot;the edgier material&quot; from the game, but expressed that he was pleased with how LucasArts allowed him to stay close to his original vision for the game. The game&#x27;s various minigames were included to allow players to take a break from solving the main game&#x27;s puzzles and play something &quot;short and silly&quot;. &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; also signified a major change in development for games on the SCUMM engine. The user interface was entirely rehauled from that introduced in &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; and built upon in subsequent games. Instead of selecting a verb function from a list at the bottom of the screen and clicking on an in-game entity, &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; compressed all verb functions into the mouse cursor, which players could cycle through using the right-mouse button. The inventory was also moved off the main screen to a sub-screen accessible by a small icon on the screen. According to Steve Purcell, this cleared space on the screen to &quot;expand on the excellent backgrounds and also made interaction much quicker and less laborious than LucasArts&#x27; previous adventure games&quot; The conversation trees were also affected by this; Michael Stemmle proposed removing the text-based selection menu used in previous LucasArts&#x27; adventure games in favor of icons representing topics of discussion as &quot;nothing would kill a joke worse than reading it before you hear it&quot;. Several of these innovations were retained for future LucasArts adventure games.

==Reception==
According to Steve Purcell, &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; was commercially successful. He remarked in 2000 that the numbers were never compared to &quot;Star Wars&quot; but it sold enough that it was considered a hit by most standards.

&quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; received a favorable reception from the gaming industry&#x27;s press, holding a rating of 84% on the review aggregator site GameRankings. Charles Ardai of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1994 liked it &quot;measurably less&quot; than &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot;. He compared the latter to a Looney Tunes cartoon and the former to an underground comic book, observing that &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot;″s style of humor &quot;can all be funny, but only to a point ... its main characters are basically jerks&quot; and the story was unimportant &quot;even to them&quot;. Ardai cited the completely optional and disconnected minigames as &quot;contribut[ing] to the feeling that &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; is more a computerized busybox ... than a unified, focused piece of fiction&quot;. He liked the graphics and simplified SCUMM interface, but concluded that &quot;the whole is rather less than the sum of its parts ... &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; affords a couple of hours of somewhat similar amusement&quot; to &quot;Tentacle&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; noted that &quot;with most adventure games, its hard to feel anything for the character(s) you control&quot;, but stated that &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; broke this mold by being &quot;genuinely funny&quot;. The reviewer praised the game&#x27;s graphics as &quot;beautifully detailed&quot; and the puzzles as &quot;intricate to solve&quot;, but noted that a number of the minigames were &quot;dismal&quot;. Joonas Linkola, writing for Adventure Gamers, echoed many of these comments, praising the cartoon-style graphics as &quot;appropriately cheesy&quot; and &quot;colorful&quot;. On the subject of the game&#x27;s humor, Linkola noted that &quot;there are many visual jokes, but the backbone of the game is in its witty dialogue&quot;, and as such this gave the game a &quot;replayability value&quot; as players may pick up on jokes based on &quot;verbal acrobatics, on the use of polysyllabic words, old English and other such oddities&quot; that they missed the first time around. Linkola gave additional praise to the soundtrack and audio work, stating that the &quot;very fitting voices ... adds to the comical duo&#x27;s wisecracking attitude&quot;.

Allgame reviewer Steve Honeywell was also very positive with his comments, describing the plot as &quot;interesting&quot;, the graphics as &quot;appropriately cartoonish and fun&quot; and the locations as &quot;well-designed&quot;, but noting that above all &quot;what makes &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; work is the humor&quot;. On the game&#x27;s puzzles, Honeywell stated that &quot;some of the puzzles are pretty simple, while others are difficult in the extreme. One nice thing is the almost complete absence of red herring items. Everything you find can be put to use somewhere&quot;. As with other reviews, Allgame praised the audio work, noting that &quot;the music is decent throughout the game, and the voice talent is stellar&quot;, closing with the comment that the game takes point-and-click adventures to &quot;insane new heights in terms of both fun and comedy&quot;. GamersHell praised the graphics of the game as &quot;superb&quot; but noted that &quot;it&#x27;s not so friendly that it can only be played by kiddies&quot;. Although describing sound setup as &quot;a bit tricky&quot;, the reviewer praised the voice acting as &quot;very good&quot; and the music as &quot;top quality&quot;. Although the review noted that the game had &quot;easy to use&quot; interfaces and menus, it was critical of the fact that &quot;at times it can be the frustrating &#x27;hunt for the correct pixel&#x27; syndrome&quot;.

The game was one of four nominees for the 1994 Annie Award in the category Best Animated CD-ROM, although the award instead went to LucasArts&#x27; &quot;Star Wars: Rebel Assault&quot;. In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; the 8th best computer game ever.

In 1998, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; declared it the 10th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it &quot;still the best graphic adventure for the PC, hands down&quot;.

&quot;Sam and Max Hit the Road&quot; has since come to be regarded as a classic adventure game title, and is regularly featured in listings of the top 100 games. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; ranked it as the 95th best game of all time, calling it &quot;the adventure game that redefined &#x27;wacky&#x27;&quot;. The same year, &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it 27th best game of all time, explaining that its &quot;goofy charm&quot; was the tiebreaker in the decision to include it on the list instead of other acclaimed LucasArts games such as &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot;. In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; as number 45 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that the game combined a bizarre plot with LucasArt&#x27;s adventure game prowess and the robust SCUMM engine. In 2004, Adventure Gamers listed &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; as the eighth-best adventure game of all time, describing it as &quot;the most absurd and ridiculous game ever designed&quot;. IGN described &quot;Sam and Max Hit the Road&quot; in its 2007 top 100 games feature as &quot;known more for its story and characters&quot;, noting that &quot;the unusual and interesting gameplay is typically saddled in the shotgun position in fans&#x27; memories, but when you&#x27;re driving a Porsche, even the trunk is a smooth ride&quot;. Writing for Adventure Classic Gaming in 2006, David Olgarsson noted that the game had &quot;undoubtedly ... become [LucasArts&#x27;] most critically acclaimed adventure game of all time&quot;, citing the game&#x27;s production values, graphical effects, challenging puzzles and story techniques as the reason for this, concluding that the game was an &quot;enduring testament to adventure gaming&#x27;s finest hours&quot;. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; the 28th-best adventure game ever released.

==Sequels==

The first attempts at creating a sequel took place in September 2001 with &quot;Sam &amp; Max Plunge Through Space&quot;. The game was to be an Xbox exclusive title, developed by Infinite Machine, a small company consisting of a number of former LucasArts employees. The story of the game was developed by series creator Steve Purcell and fellow designer Chuck Jordan and involved the Freelance Police travelling the galaxy to find a stolen Statue of Liberty. However, Infinite Machine went bankrupt within a year, and the project was abandoned.

At the 2002 Electronic Entertainment Expo convention, nearly a decade after the release of &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot;, LucasArts announced the production of a PC sequel, entitled &quot;Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police&quot;. &quot;Freelance Police&quot;, like &quot;Hit the Road&quot;, was to be a point-and-click graphic adventure game, utilizing a new 3D game engine. Development of &quot;Freelance Police&quot; was led by Michael Stemmle, one of the original designers of &quot;Sam and Max Hit the Road&quot;. Steve Purcell contributed to the project by writing the story and producing concept art. The original voice actors for Sam and Max, Bill Farmer and Nick Jameson, were also set to reprise their roles. In March 2004, however, quite far into the game&#x27;s development, &quot;Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police&quot; was abruptly cancelled by LucasArts, citing &quot;current market place realities and underlying economic considerations&quot; in a short press release. The fan reaction to the cancellation was strong; a petition of 32,000 signatures stating the disappointment of fans was later presented to LucasArts.

After LucasArts&#x27; license with Steve Purcell expired in 2005, the &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; franchise moved to Telltale Games, a company of former LucasArts employees who had worked on a number of LucasArts adventure games, including on the development of &quot;Freelance Police&quot;. Under Telltale Games, a new episodic series of &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; video games was made. Like both &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; and &quot;Freelance Police&quot;, &quot;Sam &amp; Max Save the World&quot; was in a point-and-click graphic adventure game format, although it lacked the original voice actors for the characters. The first season ran for six episodes, each with a self-contained storyline but with an overall story arc running through the series. The first episode was released on GameTap in October 2006, with episodes following regularly until April 2007, and a special compilation on the Wii released in October 2008. A second season, &quot;Sam &amp; Max Beyond Time and Space&quot;, began in November 2007 and ended in April 2008. This was also released as a compilation on the Wii. Originally expected to be released in 2009, a third season, &quot;Sam &amp; Max: The Devil&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, began in April 2010.

<text>High color graphics is a method of storing image information in a computer&#x27;s memory such that each pixel is represented by two bytes. Usually the color is represented by all 16 bits, but some devices also support 15-bit high color.

In Windows 7, Microsoft used the term &quot;high color&quot; to identify display systems that can make use of more than 8-bits per color channel (10:10:10:2 or 16:16:16:16 rendering formats) from traditional 8-bit per color channel formats. This is a different and distinct usage from the 15-bit (5:5:5) or 16-bit (5:6:5) formats traditionally associated with the phrase &quot;high color&quot;; see deep color.

==15-bit high color==

In 15-bit high color, one of the bits of the two bytes is ignored or set aside for an alpha channel, and the remaining 15 bits are split between the red, green, and blue components of the final color.

Each of the RGB components has 5 bits associated, giving 2⁵ = 32 intensities of each component. This allows 32768 possible colors for each pixel.

The popular Cirrus Logic graphics chips of the early 1990s made use of the spare high-order bit for their so-called &quot;mixed&quot; video modes: with bit 15 clear, bits 0 through 14 would be treated as an RGB value as described above, while with bit 15 set, bit 0 through 7 would be interpreted as an 8-bit index into a 256-color palette (with bits 8 through 14 remaining unused.) This enabled display of (comparatively) high-quality color images side by side with palette-animated screen elements, but in practice, this feature was hardly used by any software.

==16-bit high color==

When all 16 bits are used, one of the components (usually green with RGB565, see below) gets an extra bit, allowing 64 levels of intensity for that component, and a total of 65536 available colors.

This can lead to small discrepancies in encoding, e.g. when one wishes to encode the 24-bit colour RGB (40, 40, 40) with 16 bits (a problem common to subsampling). Forty in binary is 00101000. The red and blue channels will take the five most significant bits, and will have a value of 00101, or 5 on a scale from 0 to 31 (16.1%). The green channel, with six bits of precision, will have a binary value of 001010, or 10 on a scale from 0 to 63 (15.9%). Because of this, the colour RGB (40, 40, 40) will have a slight purplish (&quot;magenta&quot;) tinge when displayed in 16 bits. 40 on a scale from 0 to 255 is 15.7%. Other 24-bit colours would incur a &quot;green&quot; tinge when subsampled: for instance, the 24-bit RGB representation of 14.1% grey, i.e. (36, 36, 36), would be encoded as 4/31 (12.9%) on the red and blue channels, but 9/63 (14.3%) on the green channel, because 36 is represented as 00100100 in binary. 

Green is usually chosen for the extra bit in 16 bits because the human eye has its highest sensitivity for green shades. For a demonstration, look closely at the following picture (note: this will work only on monitors displaying true color, i.e., 24 or 32 bits) where dark shades of red, green and blue are shown using 128 levels of intensities for each component (7 bits).

Readers with normal vision should see the individual shades of green relatively easily, while the shades of red should be difficult to see, and the shades of blue are likely indistinguishable. More rarely, some systems support having the extra bit of colour depth on the red or blue channel, usually in applications where that colour is more prevalent (photographing of skin tones or skies, for example).

==Other notes==

There is generally no need for a color look up table (CLUT, or palette) when in high color mode, because there are enough available colors per pixel to represent graphics and photos reasonably satisfactorily. However, the lack of precision decreases image fidelity; as a result, some image formats (e.g., TIFF) can save paletted 16-bit images with an embedded CLUT.

<text>Lucasfilm Ltd. LLC is an American film and television production company founded by filmmaker George Lucas in 1971 in San Rafael, California, and later moved to San Francisco in 2005. It is best known for creating and producing the &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchises, as well as its leadership in developing special effects, sound, and computer animation for films. Since 2012, Lucasfilm has been a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios, a division of Disney Entertainment, which are both ultimately owned by the Walt Disney Company, who also owns former Lucasfilm subsidiary Pixar (formerly known as the Graphics Group before being spun off as a corporation in 1986, acquired by Disney in 2006).

The company&#x27;s films &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), &quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&quot; (2016), &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; (2017), and &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019) are all among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time, with &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; becoming the highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada. On October 30, 2012, Disney acquired Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion in the form of cash and in stock. Lucasfilm is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongside Walt Disney Pictures, Marvel Studios, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures.

==History==
===Independent era (1971–2012)===
Lucasfilm was founded by filmmaker George Lucas in 1971 in San Rafael, California, and was incorporated as Lucasfilm Ltd. on September 12, 1977. In the mid-1970s, the company&#x27;s offices were located on the Universal Studios Lot. Lucas founded the Star Wars Corporation, Inc. as a subsidiary to control various legal and financial aspects of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), including copyright, and sequel and merchandising rights. It also produced the 1978 &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; for 20th Century Fox Television. That year, Lucas hired Los Angeles-based real-estate specialist Charles Weber to manage the company, telling him that he could keep the job as long as he made money. Lucas wanted the focus of the company to be making independent films, but the company gradually became enlarged from five employees to almost 100, increasing in middle management and running up costs. In 1980, after Weber asked Lucas for fifty million dollars to invest in other companies and suggested that they sell Skywalker Ranch to do so, Lucas fired Weber and had to let half of the Los Angeles staff go. By the same year, the corporate subsidiary had been discontinued and its business was absorbed into the various divisions of Lucasfilm. And of course, it was also the same year when the second Star Wars film, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back,&quot; was released in cinemas as an official sequel to the original 1977 film.

Between 1981 and 1989, three &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films, stories by Lucas and directed by Steven Spielberg, were released. While &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) was in production, Lucas decided not to pursue further &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. Despite the third film achieving similar classic status to its two predecessors, George was unhappy with the cinema presentation of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, he created the company THX, which was unveiled on May 20, 1983. Lucasfilm produced the John Korty-directed animated film &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot; (1983). 1985 saw the release of Paul Schrader&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. The next year, Jim Henson&#x27;s &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and an adaptation of Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; were released. Ron Howard directed the fantasy film &quot;Willow&quot; in 1988 (story by Lucas); the same year the children&#x27;s animated film &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; was released. From 1992 to 1993, &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; (created by Lucas) television series was produced. In 1992, after viewing an early computer-generated imagery test created by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, Lucas announced his intentions to produce a &quot;Star Wars&quot; Prequel Trilogy. In 1994, the long-delayed &quot;Radioland Murders&quot; (story by Lucas) was released. In 1995, Lucas began production on the prequel trilogy. The trilogy took 10 years to make, ending with the release of the third prequel film &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; in 2005 where all three prequels had received mixed to negative reviews. In addition to the prequels, Lucas released the &quot;Special Editions&quot; for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Original Trilogy in 1997, 2004 and 2011, for VHS, DVD and Blu-ray, which were met with increasingly negative reception.

In 1987, the company, which at that time, was expanding from three to five films a year on its own, decided to increase making its Northern California production facilities available to other filmmakers. In 1989, Lucasfilm launched a new subsidiary Lucasfilm Entertainment Group (later LucasArts Entertainment Company) to consolidate all four units, which are Industrial Light &amp; Magic, Lucasfilm Commercial Productions, Lucasfilm Games, and Sprocket Systems.

In 2005, Lucasfilm opened a new studio in Singapore. That same year, Lucasfilm Animation commenced production of a 3D animated &quot;Star Wars&quot; television series called &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, with key production team members including executive producer Catherine Winder, supervising director Dave Filoni, Head of Lucasfilm Animation Singapore Chris Kubsch, and Henry Gilroy. Primary production took place at Lucasfilm Animation&#x27;s Singapore studio. Airing on Cartoon Network between 2008 and 2013, &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; was well received by fans and was nominated for several film awards including the Daytime Emmy Awards and the Annie Awards.
In January 2012, Lucas announced his retirement from producing large-scale blockbuster films and instead re-focusing his career on smaller, independently budgeted features. In June 2012, it was announced that Kathleen Kennedy, a long-term collaborator with Steven Spielberg and a producer of the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films, had been appointed as co-chair of Lucasfilm Ltd. It was reported that Kennedy would work alongside Lucas, who would remain chief executive and serve as co-chairman for at least one year, after which she would succeed him as the company&#x27;s chairperson, which she did in June 2013.

On July 8, 2012, Lucasfilm&#x27;s marketing, online, and licensing units moved into the new Letterman Digital Arts Center located in the Presidio in San Francisco. It shares the complex with Industrial Light &amp; Magic. Lucasfilm had planned an expansion at Skywalker Ranch in Marin County, California, but shelved the plan in 2012 due to opposition from neighbors. However, it still plans to expand elsewhere. Skywalker Sound remains the only Lucasfilm division based at Skywalker Ranch.

On September 5, 2012, Micheline Chau, who served as president and COO of Lucasfilm for two decades, announced that she was retiring. With her departure, senior executives for each of the Lucasfilm divisions would report directly to Kathleen Kennedy. Chau was credited with keeping the Lucasfilm and &quot;Star Wars&quot; brands strong, especially through animation spin-offs and licensing initiatives.

===Subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios (2012–present)===
====Acquisition process====
Discussions relating to the possibility of the Walt Disney Company signing a distribution deal with Lucasfilm officially began in May 2011, after a meeting that George Lucas had with Disney CEO Bob Iger during the inauguration of the Star Tours – The Adventures Continue attraction. Lucas told Iger he was considering retirement and planned to sell the company, as well as the &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchises. On October 30, 2012, Disney announced a deal to acquire Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion, with approximately half in cash and half in shares of Disney stock. Lucasfilm had previously collaborated with the company&#x27;s Walt Disney Imagineering division to create theme park attractions centered on &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; for various Walt Disney Parks and Resorts worldwide.

Kathleen Kennedy, co-chairwoman of Lucasfilm, became president of Lucasfilm, reporting to the Walt Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn. Additionally, she serves as the brand manager for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, working directly with Disney&#x27;s global lines of business to build, further integrate, and maximize the value of this global franchise. Kennedy serves as producer on new &quot;Star Wars&quot; feature films, with George Lucas originally announced as serving as a creative consultant. The company also announced the future release of new &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, starting with &quot;Episode VII: The Force Awakens&quot; in 2015.

Under the deal, Disney acquired ownership of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;, and Lucasfilm&#x27;s operating businesses in live-action film production, consumer products, video games, animation, visual effects, and audio post-production. Disney also acquired Lucasfilm&#x27;s portfolio of entertainment technologies. The intent was for Lucasfilm employees to remain in their current locations. &quot;Star Wars&quot; merchandising would begin under Disney in the fiscal year 2014. Starting with &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, certain products will be co-branded with the Disney name, akin to what Disney has done with Pixar. On December 4, 2012, the Disney-Lucasfilm merger was approved by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), allowing the acquisition to be finalized without dealing with antitrust problems. On December 18, 2012, Lucasfilm Ltd. converted from a corporation to a limited liability company (LLC), changing its name to Lucasfilm Ltd. LLC in the process. On December 21, 2012, Disney completed the acquisition and Lucasfilm became a wholly owned subsidiary of Disney.

At the time of Disney&#x27;s acquisition of Lucasfilm, 20th Century Fox, the original distributor of the first six &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, were to retain the physical and theatrical distribution rights to both the prequel trilogy and Episodes &quot;V&quot; and &quot;VI&quot; of the original trilogy until May 2020, along with full distribution rights for the original 1977 film in perpetuity. Lucasfilm retained the television and digital distribution rights to &quot;Star Wars&quot; Episodes &quot;I&quot; through &quot;VI&quot; with exception to Episode &quot;IV&quot;. On March 20, 2019, Disney officially acquired 20th Century Fox after acquiring its owner, 21st Century Fox, thus consolidating all the distribution and ownership rights to all the films under its umbrella. In December 2013, Walt Disney Studios purchased the distribution and marketing rights to future &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films from Paramount Pictures, although the latter studio would retain the distribution rights to the first four films and would receive &quot;financial participation&quot; from any additional films. This would make the fifth installment, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot;, become the first film in the franchise and Lucasfilm&#x27;s first film overall to be co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures.

====Kathleen Kennedy era (2012–present)====

In early 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger disclosed Lucasfilm&#x27;s plans to release standalone &quot;Star Wars&quot; films alongside the Sequel Trilogy over a six-year period. This strategy aimed to expand the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe beyond the main saga. The first of these standalone films, &quot;Rogue One&quot;, premiered in 2016, followed by &quot;&quot; in 2018.

On May 6, 2013, LucasArts, the video game development division of Lucasfilm, underwent closure, resulting in layoffs for most of its staff. Despite this, LucasArts maintained a small team to handle video game licensing. Disney subsequently entered an exclusive agreement with Electronic Arts (EA) to produce &quot;Star Wars&quot; games for the core gaming market for a decade. LucasArts retained licensing rights, while Disney Interactive Studios focused on casual gaming. Due to the lower-than-expected sales, EA&#x27;s exclusive deal was halted in January 2021, more than three years before their contract was set to expire on October 14, 2024.

In January 2014, it was announced that Dark Horse Comics would be losing its license for &quot;Star Wars&quot; comics to Marvel Comics, another Disney subsidiary, in 2015. That April, Lucasfilm announced that the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe content would be rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot;, with only selected works, including the six episodic films and &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;, deemed canon. Additionally, a new line of canon &quot;Star Wars&quot; books began publication under the Lucasfilm story group.

Lucasfilm continued its expansion globally, opening its regional headquarters in Singapore in 2014. This facility housed staff from Lucasfilm, The Walt Disney Company Southeast Asia and ESPN Asia Pacific. Meanwhile, between 2015 and 2018, Lucasfilm released several cinematic films, including critical and commercial successes like &quot;Episode VII: The Force Awakens&quot; and &quot;Rogue One&quot;, alongside the less successful &quot;Solo&quot;.

After the mixed performance of &quot;Solo&quot; at the box office, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed a slowdown in release of new &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. Lucasfilm moved its focus on developing content for Disney+ by launching several programs including the successful series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; series on Disney+.

In November 2023, Dave Filoni revealed that he was promoted to be the chief creative officer at the studio and would be directly involved in the planning of future &quot;Star Wars&quot; films and Star Wars in other series.

<text>Klagenfurt am Wörthersee (; ; ; Carinthian Slovene: &quot;Clouvc&quot;; usually known as simply Klagenfurt ( )) is the capital and largest city of the Austrian state of Carinthia, as well as of the historical region of Carinthia including Slovene Carinthia. With a population of 104,862 (1 January 2024), it is the sixth-largest city in Austria after Vienna, Graz, Linz, Salzburg, and Innsbruck. The city is the bishop&#x27;s seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Gurk-Klagenfurt and home to the University of Klagenfurt, the Carinthian University of Applied Sciences and the Gustav Mahler Private University for Music. Klagenfurt is considered the cultural centre of the Carinthian Slovenes (Slovene: &quot;koroški Slovenci&quot;; German: &quot;Kärntner Slowenen&quot;), one of Austria&#x27;s indigenous minorities.


==Name==
The Carinthian linguists Primus Lessiak and Eberhard Kranzmayer assumed that the city&#x27;s name, which literally translates as &#x27;ford of lament&#x27; or &#x27;ford of complaints&#x27;, had something to do with the superstitious thought that fateful fairies or demons tend to live around treacherous waters or swamps. In Old Slovene, a &quot;cviljovec&quot; is a place haunted by such a wailing female ghost or &quot;cvilya&quot;. Thus, they assumed that Klagenfurt&#x27;s name was a translation made by the German settlers of the original Slovene name of the neighbouring wetland. However, the earliest Slovene mention of Klagenfurt in the form of &quot;v Zelouzi&quot; (&#x27;in Celovec&#x27;, the Slovene name for Klagenfurt), dating from 1615, is 400 years more recent and thus could be a translation from German. The latest interpretation, on the other hand, is that Old Slovene &quot;cviljovec&quot; itself goes back to Italic &quot;l&#x27;aquiliu&quot; &#x27;place at or in the water&#x27;, which would make the wailing-hag theory obsolete.

Scholars attempted to explain the city&#x27;s peculiar name at various times. In the 14th century, the abbot and historiographer John of Viktring translated Klagenfurt&#x27;s name in his &quot;Liber certarum historiarum&quot; as &quot;Queremoniae Vadus&quot; &#x27;ford of complaint&#x27;, Hieronymus Megiser, master of the university college of the Carinthian Estates in Klagenfurt and editor of the earliest printed history of the duchy in 1612, believed the name to mean &#x27;ford across the Glan River&#x27;, which, however, is impossible for linguistic reasons. The common people also sought an explanation in a story that a baker&#x27;s apprentice was accused of theft and executed, but when the alleged theft turned out to be a mistake a few days afterwards, and the lad was proved innocent, the citizens&#x27; &quot;lament&quot; (&quot;Klagen&quot;) went forth and forth. This story was reported by Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, who later became Pope Pius II.

In 2007, the city changed its official name to &quot;Klagenfurt am Wörthersee&quot; (&#x27;Klagenfurt on Lake Wörth&#x27;). However, since there are no other settlements called &quot;Klagenfurt&quot; in the world, the previous shorter name is nearly always used.

==History==
===Foundation===
Legend has it that Klagenfurt was founded after a group of brave men slayed an abominable winged &quot;lindwurm&quot; from the moors adjoining the lake, which was preying on the nearby duchy. The legend says that a tower at the edge of the moor was erected to watch out for the dragon, and that the dragon was baited using a bull fitted with a chain and hook, which caught the beast&#x27;s palatal. A village was subsequently founded on the battlesite, which later expanded into a town, while the watchtower made way for a castle. The feat is commemorated by a grandiose 9-ton Renaissance monument in the city centre.

Historically, the place was founded by the Spanheim Duke Herman as a stronghold sited across the commercial routes in the area. Its first mention dates from the late 12th century in a document in which Duke Ulric II. exempted St. Paul&#x27;s Abbey from the toll charge &quot;in &quot;foro Chlagenvurth&quot;&quot;. That settlement occupied an area that was subject to frequent flooding, so in 1246 Duke Herman&#x27;s son, Duke Bernhard von Spanheim, moved it to a safer position and is thus considered to be the actual founder of the market place, which in 1252 received a city charter.

===Medieval history===

In the following centuries, Klagenfurt suffered fires, earthquakes, invasions of locusts, and attacks from Ottomans, and was ravaged by the Peasants&#x27; Wars. In 1514, a fire almost completely destroyed the city, and in 1518 Emperor Maximilian I, unable to rebuild it, despite the loud protests of the citizens, ceded Klagenfurt to the Estates, the nobility of the Duchy. Never before had such a thing happened. The new owners, however, brought about an economic renaissance and the political and cultural ascendancy in Klagenfurt. A canal was dug to connect the city to the lake as a supply route for timber to rebuild the city and to feed the city&#x27;s new moats; the noble families had their town-houses built in the duchy&#x27;s new capital; the city was enlarged along a geometrical chequer-board lay-out according to the Renaissance ideas of the Italian architect Domenico dell&#x27;Allio; a new city centre square, the &quot;Neuer Platz&quot;, was constructed; and the new fortifications that took half a century to build made Klagenfurt the strongest fortress north of the Alps.

===Industrial era===
In 1809, however, the French troops (under Napoleon) destroyed the city walls, leaving, against a large sum collected by the citizens, only one eastern gate (which was pulled down to make way for traffic some decades later), and the small stretch in the west which is now all that is left of the once grand fortifications. In 1863, the railway connection to St. Veit an der Glan boosted the city&#x27;s economy and so did the building of the Vienna-Trieste railway that brought to the city an imposing central station (destroyed in World War II) and solidified Klagenfurt as the centre of the region. 
During the 19th century, the city developed into an important centre of Carinthian Slovene culture. Many important Slovene public figures lived, studied or worked in Klagenfurt, among them Anton Martin Slomšek, who later became the first bishop of Maribor and was beatified in 1999, the philologists Jurij Japelj and Anton Janežič, the politician Andrej Einspieler, and the activist Matija Majar. The Slovene national poet France Prešeren also spent a short part of his professional career there. On the initiative of bishop Slomšek, teacher Anton Janežič and vicar Andrej Einspieler on 27 July 1851 in Klagenfurt the Hermagoras Society publishing house was founded, which in 1919 moved to Prevalje and then in 1927 to Celje, but was re-established in Klagenfurt in 1947. Several Slovene language newspapers were also published in the city, among them &quot;Slovenski glasnik&quot;. By the late 19th century, however, the Slovene cultural and political influence in Klagenfurt had declined sharply, and by the end of World War I, the city showed an overwhelmingly Austrian German character.

Nevertheless, in 1919, the city was occupied by the Army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and claimed for the newly founded South-Slav kingdom. In 1920, the Yugoslav occupying forces withdrew from the town centre, but remained in its southern suburbs, such as Viktring and Ebenthal. They eventually withdrew after the Carinthian Plebiscite in October 1920, when the majority of voters in the Carinthian mixed-language &quot;Zone A&quot; decided to remain part of Austria.

===World War II===
In 1938, Klagenfurt&#x27;s population suddenly grew by more than 50% through the incorporation of the town of St. Ruprecht and the municipalities of St. Peter, Annabichl, and St. Martin but during World War II, the city was bombed 41 times. The bombs killed 612 people, completely destroyed 443 buildings and damaged 1,132 others. A volume of of rubble had to be removed before the citizens could set about rebuilding their city.

From the beginning of 1945, when the end of the war was rather obvious, numerous talks among representatives of democratic pre-1934 organisations had taken place, which later extended to high-ranking officers of the Wehrmacht and officials of the administration. Even representatives of the partisans in the hills south of Klagenfurt were met who, in view of the strong SS-forces in Klagenfurt, agreed not to attempt to take the city by force, but upheld the official declaration that south-eastern Carinthia was to be a Yugoslav possession.

To avoid further destruction and a major bloodshed, on 3 May 1945 General Löhr of Army Group E (Heeresgruppe E) agreed to declare Klagenfurt an &quot;open city&quot; &quot;in case Anglo-American forces should attack the city&quot;, a declaration that was broadcast several times and two days later also published in the &quot;Kärntner Nachrichten&quot;.

On 7 May 1945, a committee convened in the historic &quot;Landhaus&quot; building of the Gau authorities to form a Provisional State government, and one of the numerous decisions taken was a proclamation to the &quot;People of Carinthia&quot;. This proclamation included the reporting of the resignation of the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; and &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; Friedrich Rainer, the transfer of power to the new authorities, and an appeal to the people to decorate their homes with Austrian or Carinthian colours. The proclamation was printed in the &quot;Kärntner Zeitung&quot; of 8 May. When on the following day, Yugoslav military demanded of Klagenfurt&#x27;s new mayor that he remove the Austrian flag from the city hall and fly the Yugoslav flag instead, the acting British Town Officer Captain Watson immediately prohibited this, but also ordered that the Austrian flag be taken down. Accompanied by a guerilla troop carrying a machine pistol, a Yugoslav emissary appeared on the same day in the &quot;Landesregierung&quot; building, demanding of the Acting State Governor Piesch repeal the order to take down the Yugoslav flag, which was ignored.

On 8 May 1945, 9:30 am, British troops of the Eighth Army under General McCreery entered Klagenfurt and were met in front of &quot;Stauderhaus&quot; by the new democratic city and state authorities. All the strategic positions and important buildings were immediately seized, and Major General Horatius Murray was taken to General Noeldechen for the official surrender of the 438th German Division. Three hours later, groups of partisan forces arrived on a train they had seized in the Rosental valley the day before, at the same time as Yugoslav regular forces of the IVth army. Both of these forces made their way through the city&#x27;s streets which were jammed with tens of thousands of &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; refugees, and masses of soldiers of all the nationalities that had been fighting under German command and were now fleeing the Russians. These partisan and Yugoslav regular forces claimed the city and the surrounding South Carinthian land, establishing the &quot;Komanda staba za Koroška&quot;, which would be named the &quot;Commandantura of the Carinthian Military Zone&quot; under Major Egon Remec. On &quot;Neuer Platz&quot;—renamed &quot;Adolf Hitler Platz&quot; in 1938—British armoured vehicles are said to have faced allied Yugoslav ones in a hostile way, which would have been a curious spectacle for the liberated citizens, but this is unlikely.

Several days passed before, under British pressure and American diplomatic backing, the Yugoslav troops withdrew from the city proper, but not before establishing a parallel Carinthian-Slovene civil administration (the &quot;Carinthian National Council&quot;) presided over by Franc Petek. However, protected by British soldiers, the members of the Provisional State Government went about devising a comprehensive programme to cover the new political, sociological, and economic outlooks in the land, which would serve the British military authorities. Rapid financial assistance and the restitution of property to the victims of the Nazi regime was necessary. This posed a problem, because one of the first actions of the British had been to confiscate all the property of the Nazi Party, as well as to freeze their bank accounts and to block their financial transfers. It took months before basic communication and public transport, mail service and supply were working again, to some extent at least. During the years that followed these turbulent days, a major part of the British Eighth Army, which in July 1945 was re-constituted as &quot;British Troops in Austria&quot; (BTA), had their headquarters in Klagenfurt - as Carinthia, together with neighbouring Styria, formed part of the British occupation zone in liberated Austria, which remained to be the case until 26 October 1955. 

===Modern history===

In 1961, Klagenfurt became the first city in Austria to adopt a pedestrian zone. The idea of a friendly twinning of cities in other countries began with the first city partnership between Klagenfurt and Wiesbaden, Germany, as early as 1930. This was followed up by numerous city partnerships, with the result that in 1968, Klagenfurt was honoured with the title of &quot;European City of the Year&quot;. Klagenfurt has also been awarded the prestigious Europa Nostra Diploma of Merit (an award for the exemplary restoration and redevelopment of its ancient centre) a total of three times, which is a record for a European city.

In 1973, Klagenfurt absorbed four more adjacent municipalities: Viktring, with its grand Cistercian monastery; Wölfnitz; Hörtendorf; and St. Peter am Bichl. The addition of these municipalities increased the population of Klagenfurt to about 90,000.

==Geography==

===Location===
The city of Klagenfurt is in southern Austria, near the border with Slovenia. It is in the lower middle of Austria, almost the same distance from Innsbruck in the west as it is from Vienna in the northeast.

Klagenfurt is elevated above sea level and covers an area of . It is on the lake Wörthersee and on the Glan river. The city is surrounded by several forest covered hills and mountains, with heights of up to (for example Ulrichsberg). To the south of the city is the Karawanken mountain range, which separates Carinthia from bordering nations of Slovenia and Italy.

===Municipal arrangement===
Klagenfurt is a statutory city of Carinthia, and the administrative seat of the district of Klagenfurt-Land, but is a separate district from Klagenfurt-Land. In fact, their licence plates are different (K for the city, KL for the district). Klagenfurt is divided itself into 16 districts:

It is further divided into 25 Katastralgemeinden. They are: Klagenfurt, Blasendorf, Ehrenthal, Goritschitzen, Großbuch, Großponfeld, Gurlitsch I, Hallegg, Hörtendorf, Kleinbuch, Lendorf, Marolla, Nagra, Neudorf, St. Martin bei Klagenfurt, St. Peter am Karlsberg, St. Peter bei Ebenthal, Sankt Peter am Bichl, St. Ruprecht bei Klagenfurt, Stein, Tentschach, Viktring, Waidmannsdorf, Waltendorf, and Welzenegg.

===Climate===
Klagenfurt has a typical humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Dcbo&quot;), with a fair amount of fog throughout the autumn and winter, which occurs in 106 days annually. Summers are warm and wet, with frequent thunderstorms which happen in 43.8 days on average. Klagenfurt experiences 70.9 days annually with maximum temperature at or above , and 18.8 days in which the maximum temperature reaches . The rather cold winters are broken up by occasional warmer periods due to foehn wind from the Karawanken mountains to the south. On 52.9 days the depth of snow cover is at or above , with 10.1 days having more than of snow depth. The average temperature from 1961 to 1990 was , while the average temperature in 1991-2020 period is .

==Population==
As of January 2020, there were 101,403 people whose principal residence was Klagenfurt.

In 2019, there were around 20,000 people who were born outside the country living in Klagenfurt, corresponding to around 20% of the city&#x27;s population. The majority of immigrants come from the Balkans and Germany.

==Sights==

The Old City, with its central &quot;Alter Platz&quot; (Old Square) and the Renaissance buildings with their charming arcaded courtyards are a major attraction.

Notable landmarks also include:
* The Lindworm fountain of 1593, with a Hercules added in 1633
*Landhaus, Palace of the Estates, now the seat of the State Assembly
* the Baroque cathedral, built by the then Protestant Estates of Carinthia
*Viktring Abbey
*Wörthersee Stadion Football stadium
*Minimundus, the &quot;small world on lake Wörthersee&quot;
* The Kreuzbergl Nature Park, with a viewing tower and observatory
* The small but attractive botanical garden at the foot of Kreuzbergl, with a mining museum attached
* The University Campus at the city&#x27;s west end, with the adjacent &quot;Lakeside Science &amp; Technology Park&quot; 
* Wörthersee (the warmest of the large Alpine lakes) with Europe&#x27;s largest non-sea beach and lido, taking 12,000 bathers on a summer day
* Maria Loretto peninsula, with its newly renovated stately home (recently acquired by the city from the Carinithian noble family of the Rosenbergs)
* Tentschach and Hallegg castles

==Economy==

Klagenfurt is the economic centre of Carinthia, with 20% of the industrial companies. In May 2001, there were 63,618 employees in 6,184 companies here. 33 of these companies employed more than 200 people. The prevalent economic sectors are light industry, electronics, and tourism. There are also several printing offices.

The most important market place in Klagenfurt since 1948 is Benedikterplatz, formerly known as Herzogplatz. There is a market at Benediktenplatz twice a week with a diverse selection of food available for sale.

As well as the historical market, there are several shopping centres in Klagenfurt. The City-Arkaden shopping centre, founded in 2006, is located at the northern part of the city centre. The shopping centre has 120 businesses in a total floor area of 30 thousand square metres, and is one of the largest shopping centres in Carinthia. At the time of its foundation, it was one of the first shopping centres with a central arcade in the entire country of Austria.

The second-largest shopping centre in the city is , founded in 1998 and located near the Klagenfurt central station.

==Transport==

Klagenfurt Airport is a primary international airport with connections to several major European cities and holiday resorts abroad.

The Klagenfurt central station () is located south of the city centre.

The city is situated at the intersection of the A2 and S37 motorways. The A2 autobahn runs from Vienna via Graz and Klagenfurt to Villach and further to the state border of Italy. The S37 freeway runs from Vienna via Bruck an der Mur and Sankt Veit an der Glan to Klagenfurt. The Loibl Pass highway B91 goes to Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, which is only from Klagenfurt.

The volume of traffic in Klagenfurt is high (motorisation level: 572 cars/1000 inhabitants in 2007). Service on the city&#x27;s streetcar (tram) system, as well as its trolleybus system, ended in April 1963. In the 1960s, Klagenfurt was meant to become a car-friendly city, with many wide roads. A motorway was even planned which was to cross the city partly underground, but which now by-passes the city to the north. The problem of four railway lines from north, west, south, and east meeting at the central station south of the city centre and strangulating city traffic has been eased by a considerable number of underpasses on the main arteries. Nevertheless, despite 28 bus lines, traffic jams are frequent nowadays as in most cities of similar size. Ideas of a rapid transport system using the existing railway rails, of an elevated cable railway to the football stadium, or of a regular motorboat service on the Lend Canal from the city centre to the lake have not materialized. But for those who fancy leisurely travel there is a regular motorboat and steamer service on the lake connecting the resorts on Wörthersee. During severe winters, which no longer occur regularly, it might be faster to cross the frozen lake on skates.

==Culture==

There is a civic theatre-cum-opera house with professional companies, a professional symphony orchestra, a university of music and a concert hall. There are musical societies such as Musikverein (founded in 1826) or Mozartgemeinde, a private experimental theatre company, the State Museum for Carinthia, a modern art museum and the Diocesan museum of religious art; the Artists&#x27; House, two municipal and several private galleries, a planetarium in Europa Park, literary institutions such as the Robert Musil House, and a reputable German-literature competition awarding the prestigious Ingeborg Bachmann Prize.

Klagenfurt is the home of a number of small but fine publishing houses, and several papers or regional editions are also published here including dailies such as &quot;Kleine Zeitung&quot; and &quot;Kärntner Krone&quot;.

Klagenfurt is a popular vacation spot, with mountains both to the south and north, numerous parks and a series of 23 stately homes and castles on its outskirts. In summer, the city is home to the Altstadtzauber (The Magic of the Old City) festival.

Several Carinthian Slovene cultural and political associations are also based in the city, including the Hermagoras Society, the oldest Slovene publishing house founded in Klagenfurt in 1851.

===Annual events===
Klagenfurt hosts several events annually.
*Annual lectures and discussions of the international Ingeborg Bachmann awards ceremony for literature.
*Annual international summer music concert and Gustav Mahler awards ceremony at the former monastery in Viktring.
*&quot;Wörtheresee Classics&quot; festival at the concert house.
