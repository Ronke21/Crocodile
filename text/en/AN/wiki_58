<text>Nicholas Rodney Drake (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English musician. An accomplished acoustic guitarist, Drake signed to Island Records at the age of twenty while still a student at the University of Cambridge. His debut album, &quot;Five Leaves Left&quot;, was released in 1969, and was followed by two more albums, &quot;Bryter Layter&quot; (1971) and &quot;Pink Moon&quot; (1972). While Drake did not reach a wide audience during his brief lifetime, his music found critical acclaim and he gradually received wider recognition following his death.

Drake suffered from depression and was reluctant to perform in front of live audiences. Upon completion of &quot;Pink Moon&quot;, he withdrew from both performance and recording, retreating to his parents&#x27; home in rural Warwickshire. On 25 November 1974, Drake was found dead at the age of 26 due to an overdose of antidepressants.

Drake&#x27;s music remained available through the mid-1970s, but the 1979 release of the retrospective album &quot;Fruit Tree&quot; allowed his back catalogue to be reassessed. Drake has come to be credited as an influence on numerous artists, including Robert Smith of the Cure, Peter Buck of R.E.M., Kate Bush, Paul Weller, Aimee Mann, Beck, Robyn Hitchcock and the Black Crowes. The first Drake biography in English appeared in 1997; it was followed in 1999 by the documentary film &quot;A Stranger Among Us&quot;.

==Early life==

Nicholas Rodney Drake was born in Burma on 19 June 1948, a few months after the independence from the British Empire. Drake&#x27;s father, Rodney Shuttleworth Drake (1908–1988), had moved to Rangoon, in the early 1930s as an engineer with the Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation. In 1934, Rodney Drake met Molly Lloyd (1915–1993), the daughter of a senior member of the Indian Civil Service. He proposed marriage in 1936, but the couple had to wait a year until she turned 21 before her family allowed them to marry. In 1951, the Drake family returned to England to live in Warwickshire, at their home, Far Leys, in Tanworth-in-Arden. Rodney Drake worked from 1952 as the chairman and managing director of Wolseley Engineering.

His older sister, Gabrielle Drake, became a successful screen actress. Both of Drake&#x27;s parents wrote music. Recordings of Molly&#x27;s songs, which have come to light since her death, are similar in tone and outlook to the later work of her son; they shared a similar fragile vocal delivery, and Gabrielle and biographer Trevor Dann noted a parallel foreboding and fatalism in their music. Encouraged by his mother, Drake learned to play piano at an early age and began to compose songs which he recorded on a reel-to-reel tape recorder that she kept in the family drawing-room. In 1957, Drake was sent to Eagle House School, a preparatory boarding school near Sandhurst, Berkshire. Five years later, he went to Marlborough College, a public school in Wiltshire which had also been attended by his father and grandfather. He developed an interest in sport, becoming an accomplished 100- and 200-yard sprinter, representing the school&#x27;s Open Team in 1966. He played rugby for the C1 House team and was appointed a House Captain in his last two terms. School friends recall Drake as having been confident, often aloof, and &quot;quietly authoritative&quot;. His father remembered: &quot;In one of his reports [the headmaster] said that none of us seemed to know him very well. All the way through with Nick, people didn&#x27;t know him very much.&quot;

Drake played piano and learned clarinet and saxophone. He formed a band, the Perfumed Gardeners, with four schoolmates in 1964 or 1965. With Drake on piano and occasional alto sax and vocals, the group performed Pye International R&amp;B covers and jazz standards, as well as Yardbirds and Manfred Mann songs. Chris de Burgh asked to join the band, but was rejected as his taste was &quot;too poppy&quot;. His attention to his studies deteriorated and, although he had accelerated a year in Eagle House, at Marlborough he neglected his studies in favour of music. In 1963 he attained seven GCE O-Levels, fewer than his teachers had been expecting, failing &quot;Physics with Chemistry&quot;. In 1965, Drake paid £13 () for his first acoustic guitar, a Levin, and was soon experimenting with open tuning and finger-picking techniques.

In 1966, Drake enrolled at a tutorial college in Five Ways, Birmingham, where he won a scholarship to study at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. As his place at Cambridge was offered for September 1967, he had 10 months to fill, so he decided to spend six months at the University of Aix-Marseille, France, beginning in February 1967. There, he began to practise guitar in earnest. To earn money, he would busk with friends in the town centre. Drake began to smoke cannabis, and he travelled with friends to Morocco; according to travelling companion Richard Charkin, &quot;that was where you got the best pot&quot;. There is some evidence that he began using LSD while in Aix, although this is debated.
Drake returned to England in 1967 and moved into his sister&#x27;s flat in Hampstead, London. That October, he enrolled at Cambridge to begin his studies in English literature. His tutors found him bright but unenthusiastic and unwilling to apply himself. One of his biographers, Trevor Dann, notes that he had difficulty connecting with staff and fellow students, and that matriculation photographs from this time portray a sullen young man. Cambridge placed emphasis on its rugby and cricket teams, but Drake had lost interest in sport, preferring to stay in his college room smoking cannabis and playing music. According to fellow student Brian Wells, &quot;They were the rugger buggers and we were the cool people smoking dope.&quot;

==Career==
In January 1968, Drake met Robert Kirby, a music student who went on to write many of the string and woodwind arrangements for Drake&#x27;s first two albums. By this time, Drake had discovered the British and American folk music scenes, and was influenced by performers such as Bob Dylan, Donovan, Van Morrison, Josh White and Phil Ochs (he later cited Randy Newman and the Beach Boys as influences). He began performing in local clubs and coffee houses around London, and in December 1967, while playing at a five-day event at the Roundhouse in Camden Town, made an impression on Ashley Hutchings, bass player with Fairport Convention. Hutchings recalls being impressed by Drake&#x27;s guitar skill, but even more so by his image: &quot;He looked like a star. He looked wonderful, he seemed to be 7 ft [tall].&quot;

Hutchings introduced Drake to the 25-year-old American producer Joe Boyd, owner of the production and management company Witchseason Productions, which at the time was licensed to Island Records. Boyd, who had discovered Fairport Convention and introduced John Martyn and the Incredible String Band to a mainstream audience, was a respected figure in the UK folk scene. He and Drake formed an immediate bond, and Boyd acted as a mentor to Drake throughout his career. Impressed by a four-track demo recorded in Drake&#x27;s college room in early 1968, Boyd offered Drake a management, publishing, and production contract. Boyd recalled listening to a reel-to-reel home recording Drake had made: &quot;Halfway through the first song, I felt this was pretty special. And I called him up, and he came back in, and we talked, and I just said, &#x27;I&#x27;d like to make a record.&#x27; He stammered, &#x27;Oh, well, yeah. Okay.&#x27; Nick was a man of few words.&quot; According to Drake&#x27;s friend Paul Wheeler, Drake had already decided not to complete his third year at Cambridge and was excited about the contract.

===&quot;Five Leaves Left&quot; (1969)===
Drake recorded his debut album &quot;Five Leaves Left&quot; later in 1968, with Boyd as producer. He had to skip lectures to travel by train to the sessions in Sound Techniques studio, London. Inspired by John Simon&#x27;s production of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s 1967 album &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot;, Boyd was keen to record Drake&#x27;s voice in a similar close and intimate style, &quot;with no shiny pop reverb&quot;. He sought to include a string arrangement similar to Simon&#x27;s, &quot;without overwhelming ... or sounding cheesy&quot;. To provide backing, Boyd enlisted contacts from the London folk rock scene, including Fairport Convention guitarist Richard Thompson and Pentangle bassist Danny Thompson (no relation).

Initial recordings did not go well: the sessions were irregular and rushed, taking place during studio downtime borrowed from Fairport Convention&#x27;s production of their &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot; album. Tension arose as to the direction of the album: Boyd was an advocate of George Martin&#x27;s approach of using the studio as an instrument, while Drake preferred a more organic sound. Dann observed that Drake appears &quot;tight and anxious&quot; on bootleg recordings from the sessions, and notes a number of Boyd&#x27;s unsuccessful attempts at instrumentation. Both were unhappy with arranger Richard Anthony Hewson&#x27;s contribution, which they felt was too mainstream for Drake&#x27;s songs. Drake suggested his college friend Robert Kirby as a replacement. Though Boyd was sceptical about taking on an inexperienced amateur music student, he was impressed by Drake&#x27;s uncharacteristic assertiveness and agreed to a trial. Kirby had previously presented Drake with some arrangements for his songs. While Kirby provided most arrangements for the album, its centrepiece, &quot;River Man&quot;, which echoed the tone of Frederick Delius, was orchestrated by the veteran composer Harry Robertson.

Post-production difficulties delayed the release by several months, and the album was poorly marketed and supported. In July, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; described &quot;Five Leaves Left&quot; as &quot;poetic&quot; and &quot;interesting&quot;, though &quot;NME&quot; wrote in October that there was &quot;not nearly enough variety to make it entertaining&quot;. It received little radio play outside shows by more progressive BBC DJs such as John Peel and Bob Harris. Drake was unhappy with the inlay sleeve, which printed songs in the wrong running order and reproduced verses omitted from the recorded versions. In an interview, his sister Gabrielle said: &quot;He was very secretive. I knew he was making an album but I didn&#x27;t know what stage of completion it was at until he walked into my room and said, &#x27;There you are.&#x27; He threw it onto the bed and walked out!&quot;

===&quot;Bryter Layter&quot; (1971)===

Drake ended his studies at Cambridge nine months before graduation and in late 1969 moved to London. His father remembered &quot;writing him long letters, pointing out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge ... a degree was a safety net, if you manage to get a degree, at least you have something to fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net was the one thing he did not want.&quot; Drake spent his first few months in London drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister&#x27;s Kensington flat but usually sleeping on friends&#x27; sofas and floors. Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake&#x27;s life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park, Camden.

On 5 August 1969, Drake pre-recorded four songs for the BBC&#x27;s Night Ride show presented by John Peel (&quot;Cello Song&quot;, &quot;Three Hours&quot;, &quot;River Man&quot; and &quot;Time of No Reply&quot; ), which were broadcast after midnight on 6 August. Nick subsequently recorded &quot;Bryter Layter&quot; for another BBC radio broadcast, in April 1970. A month after the initial BBC recordings, on 24 September, he opened for Fairport Convention at the Royal Festival Hall in London, followed by appearances at folk clubs in Birmingham and Hull. According to the folk singer Michael Chapman, the audiences did not appreciate Drake and wanted &quot;songs with choruses&quot;. Chapman said: &quot;They completely missed the point. He didn&#x27;t say a word the entire evening. It was actually quite painful to watch. I don&#x27;t know what the audience expected, I mean, they must have known they weren&#x27;t going to get sea-shanties and sing-alongs at a Nick Drake gig!&quot;

The experience reinforced Drake&#x27;s decision to retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended. Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. As many of his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers. Although &quot;Five Leaves Left&quot; attracted little publicity, Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was. Drake&#x27;s second album, &quot;Bryter Layter&quot; (1971), again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound. Disappointed by his debut&#x27;s poor sales, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound and agreed to Boyd&#x27;s suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. &quot;It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,&quot; Boyd later said. &quot;I imagined it as more commercial.&quot; Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: &quot;Northern Sky&quot; and &quot;Fly&quot;. Trevor Dann noted that while sections of &quot;Northern Sky&quot; sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential.

&quot;Bryter Layter&quot; was a commercial failure, and reviews were again mixed; &quot;Record Mirror&quot; praised Drake as a &quot;beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements&quot;, but &quot;Melody Maker&quot; described the album as &quot;an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz&quot;. Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album&#x27;s poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: &quot;Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song &#x27;Fruit Tree&#x27; and walked off halfway through it.&quot;

Island Records urged Drake to promote &quot;Bryter Layter&quot; through interviews, radio sessions, and live appearances. Drake refused. Disappointed by the reaction to &quot;Bryter Layter&quot;, he turned inwards and withdrew from family and friends.

===&quot;Pink Moon&quot; (1972)===
Although Island had not expected a third album, Drake approached Wood in October 1971 to begin work on what would be his final release. Sessions took place over two nights, with only Drake and Wood in the studio. The bleak songs of &quot;Pink Moon&quot; are short, and the eleven-track album lasts only 28 minutes, a length described by Wood as &quot;just about right. You really wouldn&#x27;t want it to be any longer.&quot; Drake had expressed dissatisfaction with the sound of &quot;Bryter Layter&quot;, and believed that the string, brass, and saxophone arrangements resulted in a sound that was &quot;too full, too elaborate&quot;. Drake appears on &quot;Pink Moon&quot; accompanied only by his own carefully recorded guitar save for a piano overdub on the title track. Wood later said: &quot;He was very determined to make this very stark, bare record. He definitely wanted it to be him more than anything. And I think, in some ways, &quot;Pink Moon&quot; is probably more like Nick is than the other two records.&quot;

Drake delivered the tapes of &quot;Pink Moon&quot; to Chris Blackwell at Island Records, contrary to a popular legend which claims that he dropped them off at the receptionist&#x27;s desk without saying a word. An advertisement for the album in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in February opened with &quot;&quot;Pink Moon&quot;—Nick Drake&#x27;s latest album: the first we heard of it was when it was finished.&quot; &quot;Pink Moon&quot; sold fewer copies than its predecessors, although it received some favourable reviews. In &quot;Zigzag&quot;, Connor McKnight wrote: &quot;Nick Drake is an artist who never fakes. The album makes no concession to the theory that music should be escapist. It&#x27;s simply one musician&#x27;s view of life at the time, and you can&#x27;t ask for more than that.&quot;

Blackwell felt &quot;Pink Moon&quot; had the potential to bring Drake to a mainstream audience; however, his staff were disappointed by Drake&#x27;s unwillingness to promote it. A&amp;R manager Muff Winwood recalled &quot;tearing his hair out&quot; in frustration and said that without Blackwell&#x27;s enthusiastic support &quot;the rest of us would have given him the boot&quot;. At Boyd&#x27;s insistence, Drake agreed to an interview with Jerry Gilbert of &quot;Sounds Magazine&quot;. The &quot;shy and introverted&quot; Drake spoke of his dislike of live appearances and little else. &quot;There wasn&#x27;t any connection whatsoever,&quot; Gilbert said. &quot;I don&#x27;t think he made eye contact with me once.&quot; Disheartened and convinced he would be unable to write again, Drake retired from music. He toyed with the idea of a different career and considered the army. His three albums had together sold fewer than 4,000 copies.

===Later career (1973)===
In February 1973, Drake contacted John Wood, saying he was ready to begin work on a fourth album. Boyd was in England at the time and agreed to attend the recordings. The initial session was followed by recordings in July 1974. In his 2006 autobiography, Boyd recalled being taken aback at Drake&#x27;s anger and bitterness: &quot;[He said that] I had told him he was a genius, and others had concurred. Why wasn&#x27;t he famous and rich? This rage must have festered beneath that inexpressive exterior for years.&quot; Boyd and Wood noticed a deterioration in Drake&#x27;s performance, requiring him to overdub his voice separately over the guitar. However, the return to the Sound Techniques studio raised Drake&#x27;s spirits; his mother recalled, &quot;We were so absolutely thrilled to think that Nick was happy because there hadn&#x27;t been any happiness in Nick&#x27;s life for years.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1971 Drake&#x27;s family persuaded him to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London. He was prescribed antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried to hide the fact from his friends. He worried about their side effects and was concerned that they would react with his regular cannabis use. By this time, Drake was smoking what Kirby described as &quot;unbelievable amounts&quot; of cannabis and exhibiting &quot;the first signs of psychosis&quot;. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. According to photographer Keith Morris, by 1971 Drake was a &quot;hunched, dishevelled figure, staring vacantly...ignoring the overtures of a friendly labrador or gazing blankly over Hampstead Heath.&quot; His sister recalled: &quot;This was a very bad time. He once said to me that everything started to go wrong from [this] time on, and I think that was when things started to go wrong.&quot;

In the months following &quot;Pink Moon&quot; release, Drake became increasingly asocial and distant. He returned to live at his parents&#x27; home in Tanworth-in-Arden, and while he resented the regression, he accepted that it was necessary. &quot;I don&#x27;t like it at home,&quot; he told his mother, &quot;but I can&#x27;t bear it anywhere else.&quot; His return was often difficult for his family, as Gabrielle said: &quot;Good days in my parents&#x27; home were good days for Nick, and bad days were bad days for Nick. And that was what their life revolved around, really.&quot;

Drake lived a frugal existence; his only income was a £20-a-week retainer from Island Records (). At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes. He would disappear for days, sometimes arriving unannounced at friends&#x27; houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: &quot;He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn&#x27;t there, he&#x27;d be gone. And three months later he&#x27;d be back.&quot; Nick&#x27;s supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, saw him on an underground train in London and felt he was seriously depressed: &quot;There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all. So I turned around.&quot;

Drake was a close personal friend of fellow folk musicians John and Beverley Martyn, and visited them regularly when they lived in London and subsequently Hastings. Martyn later wrote the title song of his 1973 album &quot;Solid Air&quot; about Drake and described him, in this period, as the most withdrawn person he had ever met. Drake would borrow his mother&#x27;s car and drive for hours without purpose, until he ran out of petrol and had to ring his parents to ask to be collected. Friends recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed. During particularly bleak periods, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails. Early in 1972, Drake had a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalised for five weeks. He was initially believed to have major depression, although his former therapist suggested he had schizophrenia.

By late 1974, Drake&#x27;s weekly retainer from Island had ceased, and his depression meant that he remained in contact with only a few close friends. He had tried to stay in touch with Sophia Ryde, whom he had met in London in 1968. Ryde has been described by Drake&#x27;s biographers as &quot;the nearest thing&quot; to a girlfriend in his life, but she used the description &quot;best (girl) friend&quot;. In a 2005 interview, Ryde said that a week before he died, she had sought to end the relationship: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t cope with it. I asked him for some time. And I never saw him again.&quot; As with the relationship he had shared with fellow folk musician Linda Thompson, it appears that Drake&#x27;s relationship with Ryde was not consummated. John Martyn claimed to have had a heated argument with Drake around a month before the latter&#x27;s death which was never reconciled. Phill Brown later said that this &quot;destroyed&quot; Martyn.

Drake&#x27;s perceived inability to connect has led to speculation about his sexuality. Boyd detected a virginal quality in Drake&#x27;s lyrics and music and notes that he never knew of him behaving in a sexual way with anyone, male or female. Ian MacDonald, who was distantly acquainted with Drake at Cambridge, wrote that he &quot;was probably fonder of sex than has been suggested so far, but otherwise he held aloof from worldly attachment&quot;. The claim that Drake died a virgin has been falsely attributed to his sister Gabrielle, who responded that &quot;I never said any such thing because I don&#x27;t know! I have no idea. And I don&#x27;t mind what he was.&quot;

==Death==
During the early hours of 25 November 1974, Drake died in his bedroom at Far Leys. He had gone to bed early after spending the afternoon visiting a friend. His mother said that around dawn he left his room for the kitchen. His family had heard him do this many times before, and presumed he was eating cereal. He returned to his room a short while later, where it is believed that he took an overdose of amitriptyline, an antidepressant.

Drake had been accustomed to keeping his own hours; he frequently had difficulty sleeping and often stayed up through the night playing and listening to music, then slept late into the following morning. His mother later said: &quot;I never used to disturb him at all. But it was about 12 o&#x27;clock, and I went in, because really it seemed it was time he got up. And he was lying across the bed. The first thing I saw was his long, long legs.&quot; According to Rodney Drake&#x27;s personal diary, Nick&#x27;s body was first discovered by their housemaid who looked in on Drake around 11:45 and called out to Molly who went in to discover he was dead. There was no suicide note, although a letter addressed to Ryde was found close to his bed. At the inquest on 18 December, the coroner stated that the cause of death was &quot;Acute amitriptyline poisoning—self-administered when suffering from a depressive illness&quot; and concluded a verdict of suicide. The inquest revealed &quot;a minimum of 35 [amitriptyline] pills&#x27; worth from stomach samples and up to a further 50 from blood samples&quot;.

On 2 December 1974, after a service in the Church of St Mary Magdalene, Tanworth-in-Arden, Drake&#x27;s remains were cremated at Solihull Crematorium and his ashes interred under an oak tree in the church&#x27;s graveyard. The funeral was attended by around fifty mourners, including friends from Marlborough, Aix, Cambridge, London, Witchseason, and Tanworth. Referring to Drake&#x27;s tendency to compartmentalise relationships, Brian Wells observed that many met each other for the first time that morning. His mother recalled &quot;a lot of his young friends came up here. We&#x27;d never met many of them.&quot;

==Musical and lyrical style==
Boyd wrote that &quot;the roots of Nick&#x27;s harmonies&quot; were in his mother&#x27;s piano playing, which drew from West End acts such as Noël Coward, Sandy Wilson, and Julian Slade. As a teenager, Drake learned songs by Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, and Peter, Paul and Mary on guitar, having been particularly affected by Dylan&#x27;s &quot;A Hard Rain&#x27;s a-Gonna Fall&quot;. Boyd additionally listed Django Reinhardt, Miles Davis, Bert Jansch, and Donovan as influences and speculated that he was familiar with bossa nova, specifically with the Brazilian guitarist João Gilberto. Drake asked Robertson to write an arrangement for &quot;River Man&quot; in the vein of Frederick Delius. According to Kirby, the instrumental tracks on &quot;Bryter Layter&quot; were inspired by the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and the 5th Dimension&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Garden&quot;. Similarities have been noted between Drake&#x27;s compositions and the work of Johann Sebastian Bach; Drake was listening to Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concertos&quot; on the night he died.

Drake was obsessive about practising his guitar technique and would stay up through the night writing and experimenting with alternative tunings. His mother remembered hearing him &quot;bumping around at all hours. I think he wrote his nicest melodies in the early morning hours.&quot; Self-taught, he achieved his guitar style through the use of alternative tunings to create cluster chords, which are difficult to achieve on a guitar using standard tuning. Similarly, many of his vocal melodies rest on the extensions of chords, not just on notes of the triad. He sang in the baritone range, often quietly and with little projection.

Drake was drawn to the works of William Blake, William Butler Yeats, and Henry Vaughan, whose influences are reflected in his lyrics. He also employed a series of elemental symbols and codes, largely drawn from nature. The moon, stars, sea, rain, trees, sky, mist, and seasons are all commonly used, influenced in part by his rural upbringing. Images related to summer figure centrally in his early work; from &quot;Bryter Layter&quot; on, his language is more autumnal, evoking a season commonly used to convey senses of loss and sorrow. Throughout, Drake writes with detachment, more as an observer than a participant, a point of view &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; Anthony DeCurtis described &quot;as if he were viewing his life from a great, unbridgeable distance&quot;. Kirby described Drake&#x27;s lyrics as a &quot;series of extremely vivid, complete observations, almost like a series of epigrammatic proverbs&quot;, though he doubts that Drake saw himself as &quot;any sort of poet&quot;. Instead, Kirby believes that Drake&#x27;s lyrics were crafted to &quot;complement and compound a mood that the melody dictates in the first place&quot;.

==Posthumous popularity and legacy==
There were no documentaries or compilation albums in the wake of Drake&#x27;s death. His public profile remained low throughout the 1970s, although his name appeared occasionally in the music press. By this time, his parents were receiving an increasing number of fans at the family home. Following a 1975 &quot;NME&quot; article by Nick Kent, Island Records said they had no plans to reissue Drake&#x27;s albums, but in 1979 Rob Partridge joined Island Records as press officer and commissioned the release of the &quot;Fruit Tree&quot; box set. The release compiled Drake&#x27;s three studio albums, the four tracks he recorded with Wood in 1974 and an extensive biography written by the American journalist Arthur Lubow. Although sales were poor, Island Records did not delete the albums from its catalogue.

By the mid-1980s, Drake was being cited as an influence by musicians such as Kate Bush, Paul Weller, the Black Crowes, Peter Buck of R.E.M. and Robert Smith of the Cure. Drake gained further exposure in 1985 when the Dream Academy included a dedication to Drake on the sleeve of its hit single &quot;Life in a Northern Town&quot;. In 1986 a biography of Drake, by Gorm Henrik Rasmussen, was published in Danish; an updated version with new interviews was published in English in 2012. By the end of the 1980s his name was appearing regularly in newspapers and music magazines in the UK, where he frequently was cast in the role of the &quot;doomed romantic hero&quot;. The earliest Drake profile in a U.S. magazine was the article &quot;Hanging On A Star&quot; by the AllMusic critic Peter Kurtz, which appeared in the 3 September 1993 issue of &quot;Goldmine&quot;.

The first biography of Drake in English was published in November 1997 by Patrick Humphries. On 20 June 1998, BBC Radio 2 broadcast a documentary, &quot;Fruit Tree: The Nick Drake Story&quot;, featuring interviews with Boyd, Wood, Gabrielle and Molly Drake, Paul Wheeler, Robert Kirby, and Ashley Hutchings, and narrated by Danny Thompson. In early 1999, BBC Two broadcast a 40-minute documentary, &quot;A Stranger Among Us—In Search of Nick Drake&quot;. The following year, Dutch director Jeroen Berkvens released the documentary &quot;A Skin Too Few: The Days of Nick Drake&quot;, featuring interviews with Boyd, Gabrielle Drake, Wood and Kirby. Later that year, &quot;The Guardian&quot; named &quot;Bryter Layter&quot; the best alternative album of all time.

In 1999, &quot;Pink Moon&quot; was used in a Volkswagen commercial, boosting Drake&#x27;s US album sales from about 6,000 copies in 1999 to 74,000 in 2000. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; saw this as an example of how, following the consolidation of US radio stations, previously unknown music was finding audiences through advertising. Fans used the filesharing software Napster to circulate digital copies of Drake&#x27;s music. According to &quot;The Atlantic,&quot; &quot;The chronic shyness and mental illness that made it hard for Drake to compete with 1970s showmen like Elton John and David Bowie didn&#x27;t matter when his songs were being pulled one by one out of the ether and played late at night in a dorm room.&quot;

Over the following years, Drake&#x27;s songs appeared in soundtracks of &quot;quirky, youthful&quot; films such as &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;, &quot;Serendipity&quot; and &quot;Garden State&quot;. &quot;Made to Love Magic&quot;, an album of outtakes and remixes released by Island Records in 2004, far exceeded Drake&#x27;s lifetime sales. The American musician Duncan Sheik released an album of songs inspired by Drake, &quot;Phantom Moon&quot;, in 2001. In 2017, Kele Okereke cited &quot;Pink Moon&quot; as an influence on his third solo album, &quot;Fatherland.&quot; In November 2014, Gabrielle Drake published a companion to her brother&#x27;s music. An authorised biography by Richard Morton Jack was published in June 2023, with a foreword by Gabrielle Drake. Other contemporary artists influenced by Drake include José González, Bon Iver, Iron &amp; Wine, Alexi Murdoch and Philip Selway of Radiohead. 

In 2023, Chrysalis Records released &quot;The Endless Coloured Ways – The Songs of Nick Drake&quot;, a tribute album featuring artists including Selway, Liz Phair and Feist. In 1994, the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Paul Evans said Drake&#x27;s music &quot;throbs with [an] aching beauty&quot; similar to the 1968 Van Morrison album &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;. According to the AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger, Drake was a &quot;singular talent&quot; who &quot;produced several albums of chilling, somber beauty&quot;, now &quot;recognized as peak achievements of both the British folk-rock scene and the entire rock singer/songwriter genre&quot;. Unterberger felt that Drake&#x27;s following spanned generations &quot;in the manner of the young Romantic poets of the 19th century who died before their time ... Baby boomers who missed him the first time around found much to revisit once they discovered him, and his pensive loneliness speaks directly to contemporary alternative rockers who share his sense of morose alienation.&quot; 

The American critic Robert Christgau wrote in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981): &quot;Drake&#x27;s jazzy folk-pop is admired by a lot of people who have no use for Kenny Rankin, and I prefer to leave open the possibility that he&#x27;s yet another English mystic (romantic?) I&#x27;m too set in my ways to hear.&quot; In 2000, the British critic Ian MacDonald wrote that &quot;the mantle of romance shrouding Nick Drake&#x27;s story in retrospect is undeniably alluring. But its attraction wouldn&#x27;t survive scrutiny if the work didn&#x27;t hold up: if fellow songwriters weren&#x27;t so intrigued by the forms and changes, if admiring fellow guitarists didn&#x27;t puzzle at the strange tunings and extraordinary finger-picking techniques, if singers weren&#x27;t drawn to the sighing melodies and cryptic lyrics.&quot;

Drake&#x27;s music featured in a BBC Prom concert titled &quot;Nick Drake: an Orchestral Celebration&quot;, at the Royal Albert Hall, on 24 July 2024 when some of his songs were performed by a selection of artists; Olivia Chaney, B.C. Camplight, Marika Hackman, Scott Matthews, The Unthanks joining the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Jules Buckley. The concert – which also featured Drake&#x27;s sister, Gabrielle on stage reading lines composed by their mother – commemorated the 50th anniversary year of Drake&#x27;s death.

Kokkola is a bilingual municipality with Finnish and Swedish as its official languages. The population consists of Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers, and speakers of other languages.

==Etymology==
===Name===

In the oldest Swedish sources Kokkola is mentioned as &quot;Karlabi&quot;. The town was known in Swedish by the name until 1 January 1977 when the surrounding land municipality of Kaarlela () was consolidated with Kokkola, and the town took over the Swedish name of . The word means &quot;old&quot;, &quot;karl&quot; (anglicanized Charles), is a Germanic males name, a name of many kings, meaning simply &quot;man&quot; and &quot;by&quot; means &quot;village&quot;, so the town name is ambiguous meaning both &quot;old village of Charles&quot; or &quot;old man village&quot;. The Latin name was &quot;Carolina Vetus&quot;. Gustav II Adolf, the founder of the city, possibly named the town in honor of his father King Karl IX of Sweden. The Finnish name is possibly derived from Kokkolahti, a narrow bay located at the place of the town. According to a tale the sea eagles (in Finnish merikotka or kokko) used to live there. Another theory claims that the name comes from ancient signal fires (kokko), which were used to warn people about approaching enemy troops.

===Heraldry===
The coat of arms of Kokkola is based on the city seal issued in 1620 in connection with the founding of the city. The pattern is a symbol of tar burning and tar trade, which have played a significant part in the history of the city since its founding until the 19th century. The coat of arms was designed by Olof Eriksson and Into I. Suominen, and it was confirmed for use on 17 December 1956.

== History ==

The town of Kokkola was chartered in 1620 by King Gustav II Adolf of Sweden when Finland was a part of the Swedish Empire and is one among the oldest towns in Finland. The king also decided that a tar barrel, with three burning flames coming from both the ends and the plug, should be used as the town seal, because of the tar trade at that time, for which Kokkola was founded as a shipping port. Anders Chydenius (1729-1803) who was one of the leading politicians of Sweden, was a keen supporter of economic freedom and fought in the Swedish Parliament for free foreign trade and further social reforms. In 1765 the Swedish Parliament granted the city of Kokkola the staple rights. Kokkola also became an important shipbuilding centre in Finland. As a result of tar trade and shipbuilding industry, Kokkola was for a time one of the richest towns in Finland.

An interesting historical affair, known as the Skirmish of Halkokari, occurred at the town on 7 June 1854 during the Åland War, part of the Crimean War. Royal Marines from HMS Vulture and HMS Odin tried to come ashore to deal with public property in the town &quot;in accordance with the usages of war&quot;. The marines were repelled by local defenders armed with hunting rifles supported by troops, artillery and possibly Russian advisors and military. One of the 9 smaller British craft (a gunboat) fell into the hands of the defenders. As such, this boat was the only Royal Navy vessel still in foreign possession in 1914. The boat is still today a museum-object and can be seen in Kokkola&#x27;s English Park. The town council has refused to return the boat despite several requests by the United Kingdom, most recently by John Stuttard, the Lord Mayor of London. The British Treasury annually pays a small sum to the local church congregation for the maintenance of the graves of nine Royal Marines killed in action during the skirmish .

Interesting contemporaneous accounts of the disastrous action can be found in the British Newspaper Archive, citing Gamla Carleby.

The city had a Swedish-speaking majority until 1933.

In 1977, the surrounding municipality of Kaarlela () was consolidated into Kokkola (Swedish until then: ). In 2009, the municipalities of Lohtaja, Kälviä and Ullava were consolidated with Kokkola.

<text>Miracle on 34th Street (initially released as The Big Heart in the United Kingdom) is a 1947 American Christmas comedy-drama film released by 20th Century-Fox, written and directed by George Seaton and based on a story by Valentine Davies. It stars Maureen O&#x27;Hara, John Payne, Natalie Wood, and Edmund Gwenn. The story takes place between Thanksgiving and Christmas in New York City, and focuses on the effect of a department store Santa Claus who claims to be the real Santa. The film has become a perennial Christmas favorite.

&quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; won three Academy Awards: Gwenn for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Valentine Davies for Best Writing, Original Story, and George Seaton for Best Writing, Screenplay. The film was nominated for Best Picture, losing to &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot;. In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; in 2009.

Davies also wrote a short novelization of the tale, which was published by Harcourt Brace simultaneously with the film&#x27;s release.

==Plot==

On the morning of the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, the man playing Santa Claus is drunk. An old man named Kris Kringle discovers this and indignantly complains to event director Doris Walker. Noticing that Kris resembles Santa Claus, Doris persuades Kris to play Santa in the parade himself. Kris is well received and is subsequently hired to play Santa at Macy&#x27;s New York City store on 34th Street.

The toy department head, Mr. Shellhammer, instructs Kris to recommend overstocked items to undecided shoppers. Instead, Kris directs a woman to another store to fulfill her son&#x27;s Christmas request. Impressed, the woman informs Shellhammer that she will become a loyal Macy&#x27;s customer.

Attorney Fred Gailey, Doris&#x27;s neighbor, takes Doris&#x27;s daughter, Susan, to see Santa. After hearing Kris speak Dutch to an orphan girl from the Netherlands, Susan is amazed. Doris, who has raised Susan to not believe in fairy tales, asks Kris to tell Susan &quot;the truth&quot;, but Kris insists that he really is Santa Claus.

Worried, Doris decides to fire Kris, but R. H. Macy, the store&#x27;s owner, promises bonuses to Doris and Shellhammer because of the positive publicity Kris has given the store. To alleviate Doris&#x27;s misgivings, Shellhammer suggests Granville Sawyer administer a &quot;psychological evaluation&quot;. After doing so, Sawyer is convinced Kris has a grandiose delusion and insists for Kris to be fired and put in a mental institution. Meanwhile, Susan shows Kris a magazine photo of her dream house and tells him she wants it for Christmas. Kris promises to do his best.

In the company cafeteria, young employee Alfred tells Kris that Sawyer convinced him that he is unstable simply because he enjoys dressing as Santa Claus. Kris immediately confronts Sawyer, eventually striking him on the head with an umbrella. Sawyer, outraged, brings Kris to Bellevue Hospital. Tricked into cooperating and believing Doris to be in on the deception, Kris deliberately fails his examination and is recommended for permanent commitment. However, Fred persuades Kris not to give up and represents him in court.

At a hearing before Judge Henry X. Harper, District Attorney Thomas Mara gets Kris to assert that he is Santa Claus and rests his case, asking Harper to rule that Santa does not exist. In private, Harper&#x27;s political adviser, Charlie Halloran, warns him that doing so would be disastrous for his upcoming reelection bid. Harper buys time by hearing further evidence. Fred calls Macy as a witness and gets him to admit that he believes Santa Claus exists. Macy then fires Sawyer. Next, Fred calls Mara&#x27;s own young son, who testifies that his father told him that Santa is real. Mara concedes the point, but goes on to demand that Fred prove that Kris is &quot;the one and only&quot; Santa Claus on the basis of a competent authority by the following day.

Meanwhile, Susan writes Kris a letter to cheer him up, which Doris also signs. When a New York Post Office mail sorter sees Susan&#x27;s letter, addressed to Kris at the New York courthouse, he suggests delivering all of the dead letters addressed to Santa Claus to Kris and freeing up storage space. As court resumes, Fred, having failed to find support from any other authority, is informed of the mail delivery; he argues that the Post Office, a branch of the U.S. federal government, has acknowledged that Kris is the one and only Santa Claus by delivering the letters. When the judge insists on seeing the letters, postal employees bring multiple heavy bags of letters to Harper&#x27;s desk. Harper dismisses the case.

Kris invites Fred, Doris and Susan to a Christmas Day celebration at the facility where he resides, the Brooks’ Memorial Home for the Aged. Susan is sad because what she asked for is not under the tree and loses faith in Kris when he admits he was unable to get her the house she wanted. However, after Kris offers Fred and Doris a route home that avoids traffic, Susan sees her dream house with a &quot;For Sale&quot; sign out front; Susan becomes ecstatic and runs through the house. Fred learns that Doris had encouraged Susan to have faith and suggests they get married and purchase the house. Fred and Doris then see a cane in the house that looks like a cane Kris owns. They both begin to ponder whether Kris really is Santa Claus.

===Uncredited roles===
==Production==

Throughout the process of getting this script accepted by the PCA, the movie underwent multiple title changes, starting as &quot;My Heart Tells Me&quot; and then progressing into &quot;The Big Heart&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Human&quot;, and &quot;Meet Me at Dawn&quot;, and finally ending with the name &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;. These title changes all happened within a four-month period. These title changes occurred while the filmmakers were fixing any other discrepancies that the PCA required them to fix before the production of the film could begin.

O&#x27;Hara was initially reluctant to take the role, having recently moved back to post-war Ireland. She immediately changed her mind after reading the script and came back to the United States for the film.

John Payne was on suspension at the studio and took the role to get back into work. However, it was his last film for Fox.

Cecil Kellaway turned down the role of Kris Kringle, which eventually went to his cousin Edmund Gwenn.

&quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; was shot on location in New York City, with the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade sequences filmed live while the 1946 parade was happening. &quot;It was a mad scramble to get all the shots we needed, and we got to do each scene only once,&quot; Maureen O&#x27;Hara recalled in her memoir. &quot;It was bitterly cold that day, and Edmund and I envied Natalie (Wood) and John Payne, who were watching the parade from a window.&quot;

Arthur Jacobson, assistant director, filmed the Macy&#x27;s Parade on Thanksgiving morning with nine cameras simultaneously. He said he &quot;plunked actors Edmund Gwenn and Natalie Wood in the department store cafeteria line during a weekday lunch-rush&quot;. When Maureen O&#x27;Hara requested a special police escort for a Christmas shopping spree through Macy&#x27;s he said, &quot;I know New Yorkers. They aren&#x27;t going to pay any attention to you. And don&#x27;t wear a bandanna around your head or dark glasses. Just be normal.&quot;

Although the film is set during the Christmas season, studio head Darryl F. Zanuck, who apparently didn&#x27;t like the film, insisted that it be released in May, arguing that more people go to the movies in warmer weather. The studio rushed to promote it while keeping its Christmas setting a secret. Fox&#x27;s promotional trailer depicted a fictional producer roaming the studio backlot and encountering such stars as Rex Harrison, Anne Baxter, Peggy Ann Garner, and Dick Haymes extolling the virtues of the film. In addition, the movie posters prominently featured O&#x27;Hara and Payne, with Gwenn&#x27;s character kept in the background. The film opened in New York City at the Roxy Theatre on June 4, 1947. By contrast, modern home video packaging has Gwenn and Wood dominating the imagery, with the DVD release having Kringle in his Santa Claus costume.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; mostly received positive reviews from critics. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;For all those blasé skeptics who do not believe in Santa Claus—and likewise for all those natives who have grown cynical about New York—but most especially for all those patrons who have grown weary of the monotonies of the screen, let us heartily recommend the Roxy&#x27;s new picture, &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;. As a matter of fact, let&#x27;s go further: let&#x27;s catch its spirit and heartily proclaim that it is the freshest little picture in a long time, and maybe even the best comedy of this year.&quot; A critic for the BBC called it &quot;a clever and deeply original story, that remains true and confident in direction, while delivering considerable charm all the while.&quot;

The film is considered by many to be one of the best films of 1947, and it has been dubbed a &quot;Christmas classic&quot; by several publications. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews from critics, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Irrefutable proof that gentle sentimentalism can be the chief ingredient in a wonderful film, &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; delivers a warm holiday message without resorting to treacle.&quot;

The Catholic Legion of Decency gave the movie a &quot;B&quot;, &quot;morally objectionable in part&quot; rating. This was mainly due to the fact that O&#x27;Hara portrayed a divorcée in the film.

===Accolades===
Gwenn won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Valentine Davies for Best Writing, Original Story and George Seaton for Best Writing, Screenplay. The film was nominated for Best Picture, losing to &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot;.

American Film Institute lists:
* AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 – #5 Fantasy Film
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers – #9

In 2005, &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Home media and colorization==

&quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; was first released on VHS and LaserDisc in 1987.

In 1985, it became one of the first full-length black and white films to be colorized. The 4½-month process was carried out by Color Systems Technology, Inc. In 1993, this version was released on VHS and LaserDisc, and was followed four years later by a &quot;50th Anniversary Edition&quot; on both formats, remastered by THX.

The first DVD release was in October 1999, featuring the original version alongside the original theatrical trailer and a TV spot. In November 2006, it was re-released as a two-disc &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD, with disc one containing an &quot;all new colorized version&quot; carried out by Legend Films. The second disc had the original version and numerous extras, including &quot;The 20th Century Fox Hour&quot;″s 1955 TV remake. Both discs also included a full-length audio commentary by Maureen O&#x27;Hara. The B&amp;W disc has since been re-released several times, including in a pairing with the 1994 remake.

In October 2009, 20th Century Fox released the B&amp;W version on Blu-ray with all previous extras, bar the TV remake.

In 2017, the film was restored in 4K resolution; so far this version is only available via DCP.

==Remake==
A 1994 feature film starred Richard Attenborough, Elizabeth Perkins, Dylan McDermott, J. T. Walsh, Timothy Shea, James Remar, Jane Leeves, Simon Jones, William Windom and Mara Wilson. It was adapted by John Hughes from the Seaton script, and directed by Les Mayfield. Due to Macy&#x27;s refusal to give permission to use its name, it was replaced by the fictitious &quot;Cole&#x27;s&quot;. &quot;We feel the original stands on its own and could not be improved upon,&quot; said Laura Melillo, a spokeswoman for Macy&#x27;s. Gimbels no longer existed by 1994 so its name was replaced by the name of the fictional &quot;Shopper&#x27;s Express&quot;. Alvin Greenman (Alfred in the original version) played a doorman. The 1994 remake of the film had a more serious tone than the original 1947 film had and a large portion of the plot was rewritten, although the majority of both the plot and the characters remained intact. The 1994 film also added a subtext which described concerns about religious faith.

==In other media==
There are numerous remakes of the movie, as well as a Broadway musical.

===Radio===
&quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; aired a one-hour adaptation of the movie on three occasions: on December 22, 1947, which starred the original cast including Natalie Wood; on December 20, 1948, without Natalie Wood&#x27;s participation; and on December 21, 1954. There were also two broadcasts on &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot;: as a half-hour play on December 23, 1949; and then as a one-hour play on December 21, 1950. All of these adaptations had Edmund Gwenn reprising his screen role.

It was adapted for Australian radio in 1954 as &quot;There is a Santa Claus&quot; with a script by Morris West.

===Theatre===
A 1963 Broadway musical version, entitled &quot;Here&#x27;s Love&quot;, was written by Meredith Willson.

The novella was adapted into a stage play by Will Severin, Patricia Di Benedetto Snyder and John Vreeke in 2000. It is a favorite in many community and regional theaters during the Christmas season. The characters&#x27; names are those used in the novella, and the stage setting is distinctly late 1940s. Production rights are held by Samuel French, Inc.

===Television===
A 1955 one-hour television adaptation of the movie starred Thomas Mitchell as Kris, Macdonald Carey as Fred, Teresa Wright as Doris, and Sandy Descher as Susan. This version did not show the drunken Santa at all. Titled &quot;The Miracle on 34th Street&quot;, it originally aired as an episode of &quot;The 20th Century Fox Hour&quot;. It was later re-run as &quot;Meet Mr. Kringle&quot;.

Ed Wynn played Kris in a 1959 television adaptation of the movie. Also featured was Orson Bean. It was broadcast live and in color on NBC the day after Thanksgiving. NBC made a kinescope of the program, probably for broadcasting opening night on the West Coast. The copy was in a large collection of kinescopes donated by NBC to the Library of Congress and later unearthed by Richard Finegan, who reported his experiences in the December 2005 issue of &quot;Classic Images&quot;.

A 1973 television version featured Jane Alexander, David Hartman, Roddy McDowall, Sebastian Cabot as Kris (without his natural beard; he was forced to shave and wear a false beard for the role), Suzanne Davidson, Jim Backus, David Doyle and Tom Bosley. It was adapted by Jeb Rosebrook from the George Seaton screenplay, and directed by Fielder Cook. Mrs. Walker&#x27;s first name is changed to Karen in this version. This would prove to be the final version in which the department store was Macy&#x27;s. David Doyle, who played R. H. Macy in this version, had played Mr. Sawyer in the original Broadway cast of &quot;Here&#x27;s Love&quot; 10 years earlier.

===Puppets===
In 2012, the flagship Macy&#x27;s Department Store at Herald Square in New York City featured a 30-minute puppet version of the story within its Santaland display, featuring the voices of Broadway stars Brian Stokes Mitchell and Victoria Clark.

<text>Electra, also spelt Elektra (; ; ), is one of the most popular mythological characters in tragedies. She is the main character in two Greek tragedies, &quot;Electra&quot; by Sophocles and &quot;Electra&quot; by Euripides. She is also the central figure in plays by Aeschylus, Alfieri, Voltaire, Hofmannsthal, Eugene O&#x27;Neill, and Jean-Paul Sartre. She is a vengeful soul in &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot;, the second play of Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Oresteia&quot; trilogy. She plans out an attack with her brother to kill their mother, Clytemnestra.

In psychology, the Electra complex is named after her.

==Family==
Electra&#x27;s parents were King Agamemnon and Queen Clytemnestra. Her sisters were Iphigenia and Chrysothemis, and her brother was Orestes. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Homer is understood to be referring to Electra in mentioning &quot;Laodice&quot; as a daughter of Agamemnon.

==Murder of Agamemnon==

Electra was absent from Mycenae when her father, King Agamemnon, returned from the Trojan War. When he came back, he brought with him his war prize, the Trojan princess Cassandra, who had already borne him twin sons. Upon their arrival, Agamemnon and Cassandra were murdered, by either Clytemnestra herself, her lover Aegisthus, or both. Clytemnestra had held a grudge against her husband for sacrificing their eldest daughter, Iphigenia, to the goddess Artemis in exchange for a fair wind so that he could set sail for Troy. In some versions of this story, Iphigenia was saved by the goddess at the last moment.

Eight years later, Electra returned home from Athens at the same time as her brother, Orestes. (&quot;Odyssey&quot;, iii. 306; X. 542). According to Pindar (&quot;Pythia&quot;, xi. 25), Orestes was saved either by his old nurse or by Electra from being killed by his mother, and was taken to Phanote on Mount Parnassus, where King Strophius took charge of him. When Orestes was twenty, the Oracle of Delphi ordered him to return home and avenge his father&#x27;s death.

==Murder of Clytemnestra==

According to Aeschylus, Orestes recognized Electra&#x27;s face before the tomb of Agamemnon, where both had gone to perform rites to the dead, and they arranged how Orestes should accomplish his revenge. Orestes and his friend Pylades, son of King Strophius of Phocis and Anaxibia, killed Clytemnestra and Aegisthus (in some accounts with Electra helping).

Before her death, Clytemnestra cursed Orestes. The Erinyes or Furies, whose duty it is to punish any violation of the ties of family piety, fulfill this curse with their torment. They pursue Orestes, urging him to end his life. Electra was not hounded by the Erinyes.

In &quot;Iphigeneia in Tauris&quot;, Euripides tells the tale somewhat differently. In his version, Orestes was led by the Furies to Tauris on the Black Sea, where his sister Iphigenia was being held. The two met when Orestes and Pylades were brought to Iphigenia to be prepared for sacrifice to Artemis. Iphigeneia, Orestes, and Pylades escaped from Tauris. The Furies, appeased by the reunion of the family, abated their persecution. Electra then married Pylades.

<text>Hamlet is a 1948 British film adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play of the same name, adapted and directed by and starring Laurence Olivier. &quot;Hamlet&quot; was Olivier&#x27;s second film as director and the second of the three Shakespeare films that he directed (the 1936 &quot;As You Like It&quot; had starred Olivier, but had been directed by Paul Czinner). &quot;Hamlet&quot; was the first British film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. It is the first sound film of the play in English.

Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; is the Shakespeare film that has received the most prestigious accolades, winning the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor and the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. However, it proved controversial among Shakespearean purists, who felt that Olivier had made too many alterations and excisions to the four-hour play by cutting one-and-a-half-hours&#x27; worth of content. Milton Shulman wrote in &quot;The Evening Standard&quot;: &quot;To some it will be one of the greatest films ever made, to others a deep disappointment. Laurence Olivier leaves no doubt that he is one of our greatest living actors... his liberties with the text, however, are sure to disturb many.&quot;

==Plot==

On the battlements of Elsinore, in a flash-forward, the dead body of Hamlet is borne in state upon the shoulders of noble lords with Horatio in attendance mourning the dead Hamlet. The flash-forward dissolves and in the same location at a separate time, Francisco, a sentry, is relieved of his watch by another sentry, Bernardo, who, with yet another sentry, Marcellus, has twice previously seen the Ghost of King Hamlet. Marcellus then arrives with the sceptical Horatio, Prince Hamlet&#x27;s friend. Suddenly, all three see the Ghost, and Horatio demands that the Ghost speak. The Ghost vanishes then, without a word.

Inside the Great Hall of the castle, the court is celebrating the marriage of Gertrude and King Claudius; old King Hamlet has died apparently of an accidental snakebite, and his wife, Gertrude, has, within a month of the tragedy, married the late King&#x27;s brother. Prince Hamlet sits alone, refusing to join in the celebration, despite the protests of the new King. When the court has left the Great Hall, Hamlet fumes over the hasty marriage, muttering to himself the words &quot;and yet, within a month!&quot;

Soon, Horatio and the sentries enter telling Hamlet of the ghostly apparition of his father. Hamlet proceeds to investigate, and upon arriving on the battlements, sees the Ghost. Noting that the Ghost beckons him forward, Hamlet follows it up onto a tower, wherein it reveals its identity as the Ghost of Hamlet&#x27;s father. He tells Hamlet that he was murdered, who did it, and how it was done. Claudius poured poison into the late King Hamlet&#x27;s ear, thereby killing him. Hamlet does not at first accept this as the truth, and then prepares to feign madness, so as to test Claudius&#x27; conscience, without jumping to conclusions.

This feigned insanity attracts the attention of Polonius who is completely convinced that Hamlet has gone mad. Polonius pushes this point with the King, claiming that it is derived from Hamlet&#x27;s love for Ophelia, Polonius&#x27;s daughter. Claudius, however, is not fully convinced, and has Polonius set up a meeting between Hamlet and Ophelia. Hamlet&#x27;s &quot;madness&quot; is constant even in this exchange, and Claudius is convinced.

Hamlet then hires a group of wandering stage performers, requesting that they enact the play &quot;The Murder of Gonzago&quot; for the king. However, Hamlet makes a few alterations to the play, so as to make it mirror the circumstances of the late King&#x27;s murder. Claudius, unable to endure the play, calls out for light, and retires to his room. Hamlet is now convinced of Claudius&#x27; treachery. He finds Claudius alone, and has ample opportunity to kill the villain. However, at this time, Claudius is praying, and Hamlet does not seek to send him to heaven, so, he waits, and bides his time.

He instead confronts Gertrude about the matter of his father&#x27;s death and Claudius&#x27; treachery. During this confrontation, he hears a voice from the &quot;arras&quot;, and, believing that it was Claudius eavesdropping, plunges his dagger into the curtains. On discovering that he has in fact, killed the eavesdropping Polonius instead, Hamlet is only mildly upset, and he continues to confront his mother. He then sees the ghostly apparition of his father, and proceeds to converse with it. Gertrude, who cannot see the Ghost, becomes convinced that Hamlet is mad.

Hamlet is deported to England by Claudius, who has given orders for him to be killed once he reaches there. Fortunately, Hamlet&#x27;s ship is attacked by pirates, and he is returned to Denmark. In his absence, however, Ophelia goes mad over Hamlet&#x27;s rejection and the idea that her own sweetheart has killed her father, and she drowns, supposedly committing suicide. Laertes, Ophelia&#x27;s brother, is driven to avenge her death, as well as his father&#x27;s.

Claudius and Laertes learn of Hamlet&#x27;s return and prepare to have him killed. However, they plan to make it look like an accident. Claudius orders Laertes to challenge Hamlet to a duel, wherein Laertes will be given a poisoned blade that will kill with a bare touch. In case Laertes is unable to hit Hamlet, Claudius also prepares a poisoned drink.

Hamlet meets Laertes&#x27; challenge and engages him in a duel. Hamlet wins the first two rounds, and Gertrude drinks from the cup, suspecting that it is poisoned. Whilst in-between bouts, Laertes rushes Hamlet and strikes him on the arm, fatally poisoning him. Hamlet, not knowing this, continues to duel. Hamlet eventually disarms Laertes and switches blades with him. Hamlet then strikes Laertes in the wrist, fatally wounding him. Gertrude then submits to the poison and dies, warning Hamlet not to drink from the cup.

Laertes, dying, confesses the whole plot to Hamlet, who flies at Claudius in a fit of rage, killing him, then dies. Horatio, horrified by all this, orders that Hamlet be given a decent funeral, and the young prince&#x27;s body is taken away while the Danish court kneels and the cannons of Elsinore fire off a peal of ordnance in respect.

==Cast==

===The Royal Court of Denmark===
* Basil Sydney as Claudius, the King. Claudius is the brother, and murderer, of the late King Hamlet, and he marries his brother&#x27;s widow only two months after the King&#x27;s death. An English actor, Sydney had a long and prolific career on both stage and screen. In 1923, at the age of 29, he played Hamlet in a modern-dress stage production. He subsequently appeared with Olivier in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot;.
* Eileen Herlie as Gertrude, the Queen. Gertrude, now married to Claudius, does not suspect foul play, and she fears for the sanity of her son. A Scottish-American actress, Herlie was born in Scotland and worked in the UK on film and stage productions until the mid-1950s, when she moved permanently to the U.S., where she worked mainly on stage and TV. (Her role as Gertrude was secured by arrangement with Sir Alexander Korda, to whom she was under contract.) She had previously played Gertrude on stage in 1945 to the Hamlet of Peter Glenville. She would repeat the part in the 1964 Broadway production starring Richard Burton as Hamlet.
* Laurence Olivier as Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. Hamlet is the conflicted son of the late King, who is now suspicious of his father&#x27;s death. Olivier, considered by many to be the greatest actor of the 20th century, had played this role twice on stage in 1937, at The Old Vic theatre and later at Elsinore Castle, the actual setting of the play. His 1948 film performance of the role was the only one of his to win him an Academy Award for Best Actor, despite three prior nominations, and five subsequent ones. Olivier, however, did receive several Honorary Oscars, the first in 1947 for &quot;Henry V&quot;.
* Norman Wooland as Horatio, his friend. Horatio is Hamlet&#x27;s level-headed fellow student from the University of Wittenberg. Wooland was an English actor, born in Germany, who subsequently had a long career in British and international films. He later played another companion to Olivier&#x27;s character in &quot;Richard III&quot;.
* Felix Aylmer as Polonius, Lord Chamberlain. Polonius is suspicious of Hamlet, and he is convinced that Hamlet&#x27;s supposed insanity stems from the young prince&#x27;s love for his daughter, Ophelia. Aylmer was an actor and author who had a long career on stage and screen. He was a long-serving President of the actors&#x27; union Equity and a champion of screen acting, which he felt was undervalued. He had previously worked with Olivier on his &quot;Henry V&quot; as well as on &quot;As You Like It&quot;, which starred Olivier.
* Terence Morgan as Laertes, his Son. Laertes arrives in Denmark to discover his father killed by Hamlet, and Ophelia, his sister, first driven mad and then to her own death. He vows vengeance against Hamlet. Morgan was an English actor, who was discovered by Olivier in 1945 at the age of 23 and joined The Old Vic company in 1948. He had a prolific career as one of the most highly-paid stars of British films throughout the 1950s.
* Jean Simmons as Ophelia, and Daughter. Ophelia is driven mad by her father Polonius&#x27; death, as well as by Hamlet&#x27;s rejection. Simmons&#x27; performance in this film earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the 1949 Oscars. An English actress, she had a subsequent career as a major Hollywood star. She appeared with Olivier again in &quot;Spartacus&quot;.
* King Hamlet. Hamlet&#x27;s father, Claudius&#x27; older brother, and Gertrude&#x27;s first husband, who appears in Shakespeare&#x27;s play as the Ghost of Hamlet&#x27;s Father. This character has no screen credit. The part was played- and voiced – by Laurence Olivier himself. Olivier is recognisable as the king in the flashback sequence showing the sleeping King Hamlet being poisoned by his brother Claudius. Where Hamlet and the Ghost appear together in the same shot an unidentified stand-in plays the Ghost.

===Men at Arms===
* John Laurie as Francisco. Francisco is a weary sentry, who is relieved by Bernardo at the beginning of the film. A Scottish actor, Laurie appeared in all three Olivier-directed Shakespeare films, as well as the 1936 film &quot;As You Like It&quot;, which starred Olivier.
* Esmond Knight as Bernardo [sometimes spelled Barnardo]. Bernardo is a sentry who is sent to relieve Francisco and sees the apparition of King Hamlet. He and Marcellus have seen it twice before, but they&#x27;ve found it difficult to convince Horatio until he sees it himself. A Welsh actor, Knight appeared in all three of Olivier&#x27;s Shakespeare films, as well as Olivier&#x27;s &quot;The Prince and the Showgirl&quot;.
* Anthony Quayle as Marcellus. Marcellus is another sentry. He and Bernardo have already seen the Ghost twice before and see it again. (Quayle is replaced in certain shots by another, uncredited, performer.) An English actor and stage director, Quayle spent several years as artistic director of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. He became a star of British cinema from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s.
[All of the above characters reappear at the end of the film, where they are three of the &#x27;four captains&#x27; who &#x27;bear Hamlet&#x27;s body, like a soldier, to the stage&#x27;. They are accompanied by a fourth, unidentified, soldier and by Horatio.]
* Niall MacGinnis as Sea Captain. The &#x27;Sea Captain&#x27; (a character invented for the film) is the captain of the pirate ship on which Hamlet is stranded after he sets out for England. The captain&#x27;s lines, though, are from the original play, where they are spoken by a sailor. An Irish actor with a long career in British and international films, MacGinnis had previously appeared in Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;.
* Christopher Lee, an English actor who later became famous as a star of Hammer horror films, has an uncredited role as a guard with no spoken lines.

===The Play within the Play===
* Harcourt Williams as First Player. The First Player is enlisted by Hamlet to alter the company&#x27;s play to mirror Hamlet&#x27;s suspicions about Claudius. An English actor and stage director, Williams had previously appeared in Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;.
* Patrick Troughton as Player King. The Player King enacts a mimed role that echoes Claudius&#x27; treachery. An English actor, best known for his role as the second incarnation of the Doctor in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, he subsequently appeared in Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;.
* Tony Tarver as Player Queen. The Player Queen is the Player King&#x27;s wife. In Olivier&#x27;s film she is a satire of Gertrude, intended to catch the conscience of Claudius. Tarver seems to have made no other film appearances.

===Servants to the Court===
* Peter Cushing as Osric. Osric is a foppish courtier who referees the duel between Hamlet and Laertes. (In later film versions of the play, such as the 1969 one with Nicol Williamson, Osric would be made more openly &#x27;swishy&#x27;.) An English actor, Cushing joined the Old Vic company in 1948, and he later became famous as a star of Hammer horror films.
* Stanley Holloway as Gravedigger. (The Second Gravedigger of the play is omitted.) The Gravedigger is digging Ophelia&#x27;s grave when Hamlet and Horatio come across him. An English actor, Holloway replaced Irish actor F. J. McCormick, who died prematurely before he could film his scenes.
* Russell Thorndike as Priest. The Priest leads the funeral service for Ophelia. An English actor and novelist (the &quot;Doctor Syn&quot; series) and younger brother of Sybil Thorndike, he appeared in all three of Olivier&#x27;s Shakespeare films.

==Production==
=== Casting and filming ===
Eileen Herlie, who plays Hamlet&#x27;s mother, was 29 years old when the movie was filmed in 1947. Olivier, who plays her son, was 40.

Olivier played the voice of the Ghost by recording the dialogue as an amplified whisper and playing it back at a reduced speed, giving it a deep, haunting otherworldly quality. However, for many years it was falsely assumed, even in film reference books, that John Gielgud had recorded the voice of the Ghost. (Gielgud played the role of the Ghost in three later productions – the 1964 stage, Electronovision and LP Album versions of Richard Burton&#x27;s Hamlet, the 1970 telecast of the Hallmark Hall of Fame production starring Richard Chamberlain, and a 1992 BBC radio production starring Kenneth Branagh.)

Felix Barker, Olivier&#x27;s first biographer, described how the actor-director created the sound effects for the three appearances of the Ghost:To produce the eerie noise which preceded the appearance of the Ghost Olivier...went to enormous trouble. He made as many as fourteen separate sound tracks. On one he had recorded fifty women shrieking; on another the groans of as many men; a third consisted of a dozen violinists scraping their bows across the strings on a single screeching note. These various tracks had then to be blended in different volumes and intensity until they produced a noise which seemed to him to resemble – on what authority is uncertain – &#x27;the lid of hell being opened&#x27;. Supernatural horror was further increased by the pulsing heart-beat which heralded its every entrance. This sound, Olivier remembered, had been used by Jean-Louis Barrault in a stage production in Paris; he made it doubly effective on the screen by bringing the camera in and out of focus to synchronize with the pulsing. Before he would use it, however, he wrote to ask Barrault&#x27;s permission and insisted on paying for the idea. Because no copyright is possible Olivier is particularly scrupulous about borrowing other people&#x27;s production tricks or another actor&#x27;s ideas.

=== Cinematography ===
The cinematography by Desmond Dickinson makes use of the deep focus photography previously popularised in films directed by William Wyler and Orson Welles.

=== Music ===
The music was composed by William Walton and, alongside his score for Olivier&#x27;s 1944 film &quot;Henry V&quot;, has become his most celebrated film work.

==Box office==
The film was popular at the British box office.

Producer&#x27;s receipts were £187,900 in the UK and £1,164,400 overseas. It made a reported profit of £779,700.

==Critical reception==
The film&#x27;s opening with Olivier&#x27;s voiceover of his own interpretation of the play, was criticised as reductive: &quot;This is the tragedy of a man who could not make up his mind.&quot;

Olivier excised the &quot;political&quot; elements of the play (entirely cutting Fortinbras, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern) in favour of an intensely psychological performance, partly to save time. Olivier stated that &quot;one great whacking cut had to be made&quot;, and the cut he chose to make was the omission of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. This was not much criticised at first, but later critics did take more notice of it, especially after shorter productions of &quot;Hamlet&quot; that did not leave out these characters were presented on television. John Gielgud took much the same approach years later by leaving out Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Fortinbras from his 1951 radio production of the play, broadcast on the program &quot;Theatre Guild on the Air&quot;. Gielgud also followed the lead of Olivier&#x27;s film version by giving the final lines of the play to Horatio instead of Fortinbras.

Olivier heightened the Oedipal overtones of the play by having Hamlet kiss his mother lovingly on the lips several times during the film. Film scholar Jack Jorgens has commented that &quot;Hamlet&#x27;s scenes with the Queen in her low-cut gowns are virtually love scenes.&quot; In contrast, Jean Simmons&#x27; Ophelia is destroyed by Hamlet&#x27;s treatment of her in the nunnery scene.

According to J. Lawrence Guntner, the style of the film owes much to German Expressionism and to film noir: The cavernous sets featuring narrow winding stairwells correspond to the labyrinths of Hamlet&#x27;s psyche.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 96% based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A well-executed labor of love from star and director Laurence Olivier, &quot;Hamlet&quot; not only proved that Shakespeare could be successfully adapted to the big screen, it paved the way for further cinematic interpretations.&quot;

==Awards and honours==
The film version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; was the only film in which the leading actor had directed himself to an Oscar-winning performance, until 1998, when Roberto Benigni directed himself to an Oscar win in &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot;. Olivier is also the only actor to win an Oscar for a Shakespearean role. &quot;Hamlet&quot; was the only film to have won both the Golden Lion and the Academy Award for Best Picture until &quot;The Shape of Water&quot; in 2017, which was followed by &quot;Nomadland&quot; three years later. It is also the first non-American film to win the Best Picture Academy Award.

==Influence==
In the past, the 1948 film was considered the definitive cinematic rendition of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Over the years, however, it has lost some of its status, especially in competition with the unabridged 1996 adaptation, which many critics now consider superior, as well as the 1994 animated film &quot;The Lion King&quot; which was also based on &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The film has also been compared to Olivier&#x27;s other Shakespearean adaptations, &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;. Some critics argue that Olivier overemphasised Hamlet&#x27;s Oedipal fixation on his mother, and that due to the omission of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two of the more important supporting characters in the play, the film lacks some of the play&#x27;s best comedic moments. The duo&#x27;s inclusion in later adaptations, such as the 1969 Nicol Williamson – Tony Richardson &quot;Hamlet&quot; and the 1990 Mel Gibson/Franco Zeffirelli version, both of which are shorter than Olivier&#x27;s, counters Olivier&#x27;s rationale that the play needed such drastic cuts to work on screen. Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s 1996 film version of the complete &quot;Hamlet&quot; included everything that Olivier had omitted. It is worth noting, however, that the parts of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (and Osric) are reduced in the Richardson and Zeffirelli versions, and that Branagh&#x27;s version is almost 90 minutes longer than Olivier&#x27;s.

Noted film critic Pauline Kael asserted that even if you feel that certain scenes should be done differently, when has the rest of the play been done so well? Whatever the omissions, the mutilations, the mistakes, this is very likely the most exciting and most alive production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; you will ever see on the screen. It&#x27;s never dull, and if characters such as Fortinbras and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have been sacrificed, it&#x27;s remarkable how little they are missed.

James Agee in &quot;Time&quot; wrote in 1948: &quot;A man who can do what Laurence Olivier is doing for Shakespeare is certainly among the more valuable men of his time.&quot;

==Television debut==
&quot;Hamlet&quot; was the second of Olivier&#x27;s Shakespeare films to be telecast on American television – the first was &quot;Richard III&quot;, which was given an afternoon rather than a prime-time showing by NBC on 11 March 1956, the same day that it premiered in cinemas in the U.S. ABC gave the Olivier &quot;Hamlet&quot; a prime time showing in December 1956, but like many theatrical films shown on television during that era, it was split into two 90-minute halves and telecast over a period of two weeks rather than being shown on one evening.

==Home media==
In North America, Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; has been released on DVD as part of The Criterion Collection, which has released his film versions of &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot; on DVD. The film has been released on Blu-ray Disc in the UK; however this disc is Region B locked and will not work in most American players. The Criterion Collection later rereleased &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot; on Blu-ray with more special features beyond the trailer and essay that the original DVDs featured, while The Criterion Collection has not regained the rights to release &quot;Hamlet&quot; on Blu-ray with better picture and audio quality along with any new special features that could accompany such a release.

<doc id="80533" wikidata="Q1439574" url="?curid=80533" title="Johnny Belinda (1948 film)">
<text>Johnny Belinda is a 1948 American drama film, directed by Jean Negulesco, based on the 1940 Broadway stage hit of the same name by Elmer Blaney Harris. The play was adapted for the screen by writers Allen Vincent and Irma von Cube.

The story is based on an incident that happened near Harris&#x27;s summer residence in Fortune Bridge, Bay Fortune, Prince Edward Island. The title character is based on the real-life Lydia Dingwell (1852–1931), of Dingwells Mills, Prince Edward Island. The film dramatizes the consequences of spreading lies and rumors, and the horror of rape. The latter subject had previously been prohibited by the Motion Picture Production Code. &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot; is widely considered to be the first Hollywood film for which the restriction was relaxed since its implementation in 1934, and as such was controversial at the time of its initial release.

The film stars Jane Wyman, Lew Ayres, Charles Bickford, Agnes Moorehead, Stephen McNally, and Jan Sterling. Wyman&#x27;s performance earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress.

It was filmed on location in Fort Bragg, California.

==Plot==
Belinda MacDonald is a deaf-mute young woman living on Prince Edward Island on the east coast of Canada. She is befriended by Dr. Robert Richardson, a physician who recently moved to town. The doctor realizes that, although she cannot hear or speak, Belinda is very intelligent. She lives on a farm with her father, Black MacDonald, and her aunt, Aggie MacDonald. The family raises cattle and sheep and makes a living grinding wheat into flour at their small mill. Her father and aunt call Belinda &quot;Dummy&quot; and resent her because her mother died giving birth to her. Dr. Richardson teaches Belinda sign language, and she learns to read. Over time, his affection for her grows.

Dr. Richardson&#x27;s secretary, Stella, is attracted to him, but the doctor does not reciprocate her feelings. After Stella figures out that he is attracted to Belinda, she starts to resent both of them.

One of the family&#x27;s customers, Laughlin &quot;Locky&quot; McCormick, meets Belinda when he stops by the MacDonald farm. Locky is dating Stella at the time. He gets drunk, goes to the farm where Belinda is alone, and rapes her. This results in her pregnancy. Belinda gives birth to a boy, whom she names Johnny. The people in town shun the MacDonald family and Dr. Richardson, as they gossip that he must be Johnny&#x27;s father. Dr. Richardson tells Black that he is willing to marry Belinda in order to quiet town gossip. Black rejects this idea, as he believes that Dr. Richardson does not truly love Belinda. Boycotted by locals, the doctor leaves the community and takes a position in a Toronto hospital. He writes to Belinda suggesting he will return for her and Johnny.

Locky goes to the MacDonald farm under the pretense of purchasing ground barley but really wants to get a look at baby Johnny. He boasts about the infant, saying, &quot;spittin&#x27; image of his father,&quot; revealing to Black that he is the father of the child. Black follows Locky and threatens to expose him to the town. They have a fight on a seaside cliff, and Locky throws Black off the cliff into the sea, killing him. Town gossip calls it an accident and does not suspect Locky. They celebrate his wedding to Stella.

Belinda and her aunt Aggie try to operate the farm but struggle to pay the bills. Farmers boycott their flour mill. The town, at the urging of Locky, declares Belinda unfit to care for the child and awards him to Locky and Stella. They come to take Johnny. Belinda makes Stella realize that she is a smart and competent mother who will never give up her baby. Stella tells Locky that the mother should keep Johnny, but he demands the baby, telling his wife that it is his son. When he goes to retrieve the boy, Belinda kills him with a shotgun. She is arrested and goes on trial for murder. At the trial, Dr. Richardson testifies that she was protecting her property and family. The court dismisses this as the doctor&#x27;s love for her and is ready to sentence Belinda to execution, but Stella blurts out that Locky had confessed the truth about the rape to her on the day he was killed. Belinda is set free, and she, Johnny, Dr. Richardson, and Aggie leave together.

===Box office===

===Critical reaction===
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that while some of the scenes &quot;were pretty lurid, especially towards the end,&quot; that &quot;the best of the film is absorbing, and Miss Wyman, all the way through, plays her role in a manner which commands compassion and respect.&quot; William Brogdon of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;somber, tender, [and] moving,&quot; with Wyman&#x27;s performance &quot;a personal success.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; thought the screenplay was &quot;far superior&quot; to the script of the original play, and that the actors were &quot;all convincing, particularly Jane Wyman, who is cast as the badgered heroine.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called it &quot;a memorable film in which Jane Wyman&#x27;s performance as Belinda is outstanding.&quot; &quot;A powerful dramatic entertainment,&quot; wrote &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports.&quot; &quot;The direction, acting, and photography are of a superior quality, but the outstanding thing about the picture is the exceptionally fine performance by Jane Wyman, an acting job that will undoubtedly make her a foremost contender for the Academy Award.&quot;

Content aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports a 91% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating based on 10 out of 11 surveyed critics giving the film a positive review.

<text>The Snake Pit is a 1948 American psychological drama film directed by Anatole Litvak and starring Olivia de Havilland, Mark Stevens, Leo Genn, Celeste Holm, Beulah Bondi, and Lee Patrick. Based on Mary Jane Ward&#x27;s 1946 semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, the film recounts the tale of a woman who finds herself in an insane asylum and cannot remember how she got there.

The novel was adapted for the screen by Frank Partos and Millen Brand, in screen credits order, and Arthur Laurents (uncredited).

==Plot==
Virginia Cunningham is an apparently schizophrenic patient at a mental hospital called the Juniper Hill State Hospital. She hears voices and seems so out of touch with reality that she does not recognize her husband Robert.

Dr. Kik works with her, and flashbacks show how Virginia and Robert met a few years earlier in Chicago. He worked for a publisher who rejected her writing, and they bumped into each other again in the cafeteria. Occasionally she continued to drop by the cafeteria so they got to know each other.

Despite their blossoming romance, Virginia abruptly leaves town without explanation. Robert moves to New York and bumps into her again at the Philharmonic. After she provides a flimsy excuse for her absence and departure, they pick up where they left off, though she remains evasive and avoids his desire for marriage. Eventually, Virginia brings up the possibility of marriage. They marry on May 7, but Virginia acts erratically again. She cannot sleep and loses touch with reality, as she feels it is November and snaps when Robert corrects her. The rest of the film follows her therapy. Dr. Kik puts her through electro-shock treatment and narcosynthesis. Dr. Kik wants to get to the &quot;causes of her unconscious rejection.&quot; The film includes many flashbacks, including her earlier failed engagement to Gordon as well as childhood issues. The film shows her progress and what happens to her along the way.

The mental hospital is organized on a system of wards, with the best functioning patients assigned to the wards with the lowest numbers, which have better furnishings and more relaxed rules for patient behavior. Virginia moves to the lowest level (One), where she is treated well by a young nurse but is picked on by Nurse Davis, the only truly abusive nurse in the hospital. Davis is jealous of Dr. Kik&#x27;s interest in Virginia, which she sees as excessive. Nurse Davis goads Virginia into an outburst which results in Virginia being straitjacketed and expelled from Level One into the &quot;snake pit&quot;, where patients considered beyond help are simply placed together in a large padded cell and abandoned. Dr. Kik, learning of this, has Virginia returned to Level One, but away from Nurse Davis&#x27;s care.

Despite this setback, Dr. Kik&#x27;s care continues to improve Virginia&#x27;s mental state. Over time, Virginia gains insight and self-understanding, and is able to leave the hospital.

The film depicts the bureaucratic regimentation of the institution, the staff (some unkind and aloof, some kind and empathetic), and relationships between patients, from which Virginia learns as much as she does in therapy.

==Cast==
==Production==
Gene Tierney was the first choice to play the role of Virginia, but was replaced by de Havilland when Tierney became pregnant.

When the book &quot;The Snake Pit&quot; was still in galleys, the president of Random House, Bennett Cerf, showed it to his friend Anatole Litvak, who bought the rights. Litvak was born in Kiev to Lithuanian Jewish parents and learned filmmaking in Leningrad. He began his career as a director with films in Berlin, Paris, and London. Moving to the United States, Litvak became known as the most prominent director of films with antifascist sentiment. Most notably, he directed &quot;Confessions of a Nazi Spy&quot; in 1939, alerting American audiences to the rise of Hitler. When the United States entered the war, Litvak enlisted in the U.S. Army and co-directed with Frank Capra the &quot;Why We Fight&quot; films, which Capra produced. In his contact with men who had survived combat, Litvak became interested in the psychiatric treatment of veterans and the plight of the mentally ill. After buying the rights to &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;, Litvak sold them to Darryl F. Zanuck at Twentieth Century-Fox. Zanuck had produced films with social conscience, most notably &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; and &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot;. With &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;, Zanuck added mental patients to Jews and the poor as groups left out of the American dream.

Director Litvak insisted upon three months of grueling research. He demanded that the entire cast and crew accompany him to various mental institutions and to lectures by leading psychiatrists. He did not have to convince de Havilland, who threw herself into the research with an intensity that surprised even those who knew her well. Her interest derived in part from having had a childhood friend who was hospitalized with schizophrenia. De Havilland watched carefully each of the procedures then in vogue, including hydrotherapy and electric shock treatments. When permitted, she sat in on long individual therapy sessions. She attended social functions, including dinners and dances with the patients. In fact, after the film&#x27;s release, when columnist Florabel Muir questioned in print whether any mental institution actually &quot;allowed contact dances among violent inmates,&quot; Muir was surprised by a telephone call from de Havilland, who assured her she had attended several such dances herself. Much of the film was filmed in the Camarillo State Mental Hospital in California.

Litvak was an early adopter and master of the whip pan scene transition device, and used it no fewer than eight times in this film.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

The critics were generally positive, with Louella Parsons declaring: &quot;It is the most courageous subject ever attempted on the screen&quot;. Walter Winchell wrote: &quot;Its seething quality gets inside of you.&quot; On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on ten reviews, with a weighted average rating of 8.1/10.

Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars, calling it &quot;gripping&quot; and &quot;one of the first films to deal intelligently with mental breakdown and the painstakingly slow recovery process&quot;.

Among liberals and leftists the film was received as politically progressive. Thus, the Communist Party USA&#x27;s &quot;People&#x27;s Daily World&quot; hailed it as &quot;A Film Achievement&quot; and explained that it &quot;does not foster an argument that the solution to our problems lies in new regiments of psychoanalysts&quot;.

A contemporaneous account by Millen Brand, who co-wrote the screenplay, said that leading psychiatrists found the film &quot;sensational&quot;. Writing about a special showing arranged for sixty psychiatrists in New York City, Brand told a fellow screenwriter that &quot;the psychiatrists not only were enthusiastic without reserve, but they were swooning around at the lengths to which we had gone to show the real complexity and scope of analytic treatment&quot;. Mary Jane Ward, on whose book the film was based, also expressed support for the screenplay and the film, as did journalist Albert Deutsch.

The film has come under fire from some feminist authors for a seeming misportrayal of Virginia&#x27;s difficulties and the implication that accepting a subservient role as a wife and mother is part of her &quot;cure&quot;. Other film analysts view it as successful in conveying Ward&#x27;s view of the uncertainties of post-World War II life and women&#x27;s roles.

===Censorship===
Due to public concerns that the extras in the film were in fact real mental patients being exploited, the British censor added a foreword explaining that everyone who appeared on screen was a paid actor and that conditions in British hospitals were unlike those portrayed in the film. The censor also cut 1,000 feet of the film, deleting all sequences involving patients in straitjackets, and lighter scenes evoking laughter. A group of psychiatric nurses in Britain tried to have the film banned but failed. To counteract the idea that U.K. hospitals were as dismal as those in the U.S., the Crown Film Unit produced &quot;Out of True&quot;, a motion picture showing the positive atmosphere and methods in the U.K.

==Awards==
&quot;The Snake Pit&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Sound Recording (Thomas T. Moulton), and was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role (de Havilland), Best Director, Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay.

The film also won the International Prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1949, where it was cited for &quot;a daring inquiry in a clinical case dramatically performed.&quot;

==Impact==
The film led to changes in the conditions of mental institutions in the United States. In 1949, Herb Stein of &quot;Daily Variety&quot; wrote &quot;Wisconsin is the seventh state to institute reforms in its mental hospitals as a result of &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;.&quot;

Publicity releases from Twentieth Century-Fox claimed that twenty-six of the then forty-eight states had enacted reform legislation because of the movie. While it is wise to be cautious about claims that a film changed social policy, recent scholarship suggests that such an assertion may be valid. One reformer connected to &quot;The Snake Pit&quot; who does not appear in histories of psychiatry was Charles Schlaifler, a key figure in getting federal support for mental health after World War II. In 1942, Schlaifler became a vice president for advertising at the Fox studio, and was put in charge of public relations for &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;. In that role, his consciousness about the mentally ill was raised, and soon Schlaifler began testifying before Congress on the need for more funds for the National Institute of Mental Health. Then, in 1951, he became a spokesman for the National Mental Health Committee, founded by Mary Lasker. In the transcripts of Congressional hearings in the 1950s, one sees how effective Schlaifler was with congressmen and the business executives whom he brought to testify that research on mental health problems would be good for business. While Schlaifler had no interest in creating a social movement, he played a key role in making mental illness a national concern, not just the business of individual states. More concretely, he helped convince members of Congress to dramatically increase funds to combat mental illness, and was treated as an authority because of his work on &quot;The Snake Pit.&quot; Thus, that film influenced the public&#x27;s attitudes directly and had an effect upon elites who controlled budgets related to the mentally ill.

==Home media==
The film was first released on home video in the United States on December 1, 1993.
==Other adaptations==
&quot;The Snake Pit&quot; was dramatized as an hour-long radio play on the April 10, 1950, broadcast of &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;, with de Havilland reprising her film role.

<doc id="80539" wikidata="Q4836722" url="?curid=80539" title="BTR plc">
<text>BTR plc was a British multinational industrial conglomerate company. It was headquartered in London, England.

The company was originally founded in 1924 as the British Goodrich Rubber Co. Ltd as a subsidiary of the American rubber specialist B.F.Goodrich Company. Ten years later, it became the British Tyre &amp; Rubber Co. Ltd after Goodrich sold its stake in the business; it moved into synthetic rubber and plastics during the 1940s and withdrew from tyre production in 1956, adopting the name BTR Ltd around the same timeframe. Management pursued a strategy of diversification and rationalisation that lasted into the mid 1960s.

During late 1966, BTR came under the control of a new central management team, which Sir Owen Green took the lead of in the following year. Green pursued a strategy of targeted growth towards opportunities that quickly would become lucrative. New subsidiaries would be created and numerous acquisitions would be undertaken by Green and later by Alan Jackson. This approach included multiple hostile takeovers by BTR, though several such bids failed, for Pilkington, Norton Abrasives, and Hawker Siddeley.

BTR was listed on the London Stock Exchange. During the 1990s, BTR accumulated a considerable debt burden and divested many of its divisions during restructuring efforts. In 1999, BTR merged with Siebe to form BTR Siebe, later renamed Invensys. Invensys was bought by and absorbed into Schneider Electric in 2014.

==History==

===Early years===
BTR can trace its origins back to 1924, at which point the American rubber specialist B.F.Goodrich Company formed a UK-based subsidiary, British Goodrich Rubber Co. Ltd. During 1934, Goodrich opted to sell the majority of its shares in the company, which promptly changed its name to the British Tyre &amp; Rubber Co. Ltd. Shortly thereafter, it was successfully floated on the London Stock Exchange. The company primarily focused on the manufacture of tyres for road vehicles, conveyor belts, and industrial hoses. It benefitted considerably from several innovations developed during the Second World War, such as synthetic rubber and plastics. By 1955, British Tyre &amp; Rubber was one of eleven tyre manufacturers operating in the UK.

During 1956, the company opted to cease production of tyres in favour of its other activities as this business unit was becoming increasingly unprofitable. To reflect the company&#x27;s changing product line, its name was changed to BTR Limited. The late 1950s and early 1960s were marked by efforts towards diversification and rationalisation, however, BTR achieved poor fiscal performance up until the mid-1960s.

===Owen Green and subsequent years; acquisitive industrial group===
During late 1966, BTR came under the control of a new central management team; the prevailing philosophy was stated to be &quot;growth is the goal, profit is the measure, security is the result&quot;. Furthermore, it was posited that, for the company to be strong and lucrative, it would need to operate on an international basis. To this end, BTR, through both acquisition and establishment, established numerous overseas operations; while in-house investment was favoured, external acquisitions were pursued where it was through to result in greater growth opportunities. This process was encouraged by the British government, which supported BTR&#x27;s amalgamation with similar companies such as the Leyland and Birmingham Rubber Company.

Between 1967 and 1993, BTW was dominated by Sir Owen Green, who initially served as its managing director (until 1986) and then as its chairman. Green&#x27;s principal focus was on operating margins and cash flow, which arguably came at the cost of long-term investment.

By 1982, BTR had acquired a large number of companies in the United Kingdom, the US, Canada, Australia, South Africa and Germany. These ventures ranged into various fields of work, from extracting raw materials such as natural and synthetic rubbers, textiles and chemicals, to insurance, pensions, corporate planning, international taxation and legal matters. The majority of BTR&#x27;s product line were sold to other manufacturers and businesses. The company did not have a large centralised research and development division, a factor that led to the company being criticised for not valuing a long term perspective.

Acquisitions continued through the 1980s; larger companies included the Tilling Group in 1983, and Dunlop Holdings plc in 1985. The Dunlop road tyre business was immediately sold to Sumitomo Rubber Industries. During late 1986, BTR launched a hostile takeover bid for Pilkington, a leading manufacturer of high quality glass with operations worldwide, which it valued at $1.64 billion. Pilington&#x27;s management rejected the offer and fought a successful defensive campaign with politicians taking sides in the matter, thus BTR was compelled to withdraw its offer in February 1987. Three years later, BTR withdrew from another failed hostile takeover, this time of Norton Abrasives, which it had valued at $1.643 billion.

In 1988, BTR purchased Schlegel Corporation through a subsidiary. Schlegel had manufacturing facilities for door and window seals and related products in twelve countries. Schlegel made automobile and building products in Europe through its subsidiaries Schlegel UK and Schlegel GmbH. Following the purchase, BTR decided to transfer the Schlegel UK and Schlegel GmbH subsidiaries from Schlegel Corporation to itself. There was a dispute over how the transfer should be valued for tax purposes, with BTR valuing the Schlegel UK and Schlegel GmbH subsidiaries at $21.8 million and $9.4 million, while the Internal Revenue Service valued them at $49.1 million and $13.2 million.
During the early to mid 1990s, under Alan Jackson’s stewardship as CEO, BTR controlled over 1,500 subsidiary companies in over 60 different countries. This was largely due to the takeover bids that were led by Green and, later, by Jackson.

In 1992, Hawker Siddeley was acquired by BTR in exchange for £1.5bn despite opposition from Hawker Siddeley&#x27;s board. This was the first large hostile takeover of a company that Jackson had completed in his role as managing director. During that same year, he also purchased two smaller companies; Rockware, the UK’s leading class manufacturer and Pirreli, a sealing company. These were bought for A$400 and A$200 million respectively.

In 1995, BTR purchased Australian platics manufacturer Nylex. This company during the late 1980s provided 41% of BTR’s profits and kickstarted BTR’s growth in the emerging markets of Southeast Asia. This was also due to the Malaysian wing of Nylex, Berhard.

One of the major ways BTR grew in size and in profits, was its continual takeover of other companies throughout the world. This led it to be a multinational conglomerate. Moreover, the company also gained further profits by investing large amounts of money in investing in capital and operations, as well as the methods used by Green and later Jackson, of ruthless cost-cutting. This included laying off staff and dispensing with unprofitable businesses. It was these methods that have been credited with the success of the company. Nevertheless, this approach also was perhaps BTR&#x27;s greatest weakness, which came ahead in the late 1990s following the retirement of both Green and Jackson, at which point debt had risen to high levels. Restructuring efforts failed to revive the company, in which, became increasingly inefficient and unprofitable in various manufacturing sections.

===Later years===
BTR&#x27;s activities in late 1990s was marked by a series of divestments, at which point the company was headed by Ian Strachan. During 1994, less than three years after arranging to acquire the company, BTR opted to spin off Hawker Siddeley Canada via a flotation on the Toronto Stock Exchange, swapping its 59 per cent holding for around £65 million. Similarly, after less than a decade of ownership, the company opted to sell Rockware.
Between 1996 and 1998, BTR sold the remaining Dunlop companies, and exited the aerospace sector entirely. In November 1997, UniPoly S.A, bought 32 companies from BTR, including the Schlegel Sealing and Shielding Group, at a reported cost of roughly $867 million. The deal was a management buyout in which UniPoly Group was formed to take over most of the rubber products business of BTR plc. During these years, BTR was organised in the following businesses areas: Engineering, Packaging, Materials, Building products, Polymers.

In 1999, BTR merged with Siebe to form BTR Siebe, which was renamed Invensys. The last chief executive of BTR, Ian Strachan, became the initial chief executive of Invensys following the merger. The merger has been viewed as a final admission that BTR&#x27;s business model could no longer fulfil changes in customer expectations.

<text>Humboldt County () is a county located in the U.S. state of California. As of the 2020 census, the population was 136,463. The county seat is Eureka.

Humboldt County comprises the Eureka–Arcata–Fortuna, California, Micropolitan Statistical Area. It is located on the far North Coast of California, about north of San Francisco. It has among the most diverse climates of United States counties, with very mild coastal summers and hot interior days. Similar to the greater region, summers are extremely dry and winters have substantial rainfall.

Its primary population centers of Eureka, the site of College of the Redwoods main campus, and the smaller college town of Arcata, site of California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, are located adjacent to Humboldt Bay, California&#x27;s second largest natural bay. Area cities and towns are known for hundreds of ornate examples of Victorian architecture.

Humboldt County is a densely forested mountainous and rural county with about of coastline (more than any other county in the state), situated along the Pacific coast in Northern California&#x27;s rugged Coast (Mountain) Ranges. With nearly of combined public and private forest in production, Humboldt County alone produces twenty percent of the total volume and thirty percent of the total value of all forest products produced in California. The county contains over forty percent of all remaining old growth Coast Redwood forests, the vast majority of which are protected or strictly conserved within dozens of national, state, and local forests and parks, totaling approximately .
==History==
The original inhabitants of the area now known as Humboldt County include the Algic Wiyot, Yurok; the Hokan Karuk; and the Athapaskan Hupa, Chilula, Whilkut, Tsnungwe as well as the Eel River Athapaskan peoples, including the Wailaki, Mattole and Nongatl.

Spanish traders made unintended visits to California with the Manila Galleons on their return trips from the Philippines beginning in 1565. The first recorded entry by people of European origin was a landing by the Spanish in 1775 in Trinidad.

The first recorded entry of Humboldt Bay by non-natives was an 1806 visit from a sea otter hunting party from Sitka employed by the Russian American Company. The hunting party included Captain Jonathan Winship, an American, and some Aleut hunters. The bay was not visited again by people of European origin until 1849 when Josiah Gregg&#x27;s party visited. In 1850, Douglas Ottinger and Hans Buhne entered the bay, naming it Humboldt in honor of the great naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt, and the name was later applied to the county as a whole.

The area around Humboldt Bay was once solely inhabited by the Wiyot Indian tribe. One of the largest Wiyot villages, Tolowot, was located on Indian Island in Humboldt Bay. Founded around 900 BC, it contains a shell midden in size and deep. It was the site of the February 26, 1860, massacre of the Wiyot people that was recorded by Bret Harte, then living in Union, now called Arcata. Between 60 and 200 Wiyot men, women, and children were murdered that night in the midst of a religious ceremony. Tolowot is now a restricted site and a National Historic Landmark. In 2019, the island was restored to the Wiyot tribe, and is now known as Tuluwat or Duluwat island.
Humboldt County was formed in 1853 from parts of Trinity County.

State historic landmarks in Humboldt County include Arcata and Mad River Railroad, California&#x27;s First Drilled Oil Wells in Petrolia, Camp Curtis, Centerville Beach Cross, the city of Eureka, the Victorian town of Ferndale, Fort Humboldt, Humboldt Harbor Historical District, the Jacoby Building, The Old Arrow Tree, Old Indian Village of Tsurai, the Town of Trinidad, and Trinidad Head.

On February 5 and 6, 1885, Eureka&#x27;s entire Chinese population of 300 men and 20 women were expelled after a gunfight between rival Chinese gangs (tongs) resulted in the wounding of a 12-year-old boy and the death of 56-year-old David Kendall, a Eureka City Councilman. After the shooting, an angry mob of 600 Eureka residents met and informed the Chinese that they were no longer wanted in Eureka and would be hanged if they were to stay in town past 3 p.m. the next day. They were put on two steamships and shipped to San Francisco. No one was killed in the expulsion. Another Chinese expulsion occurred during 1906 in a cannery on the Eel River, in which 23 Chinese cannery workers were expelled after objections to their presence. However, some Chinese remained in the Orleans area, where some white landowners sheltered and purchased food for the Chinese mineworkers until after racial tension passed. Chinese did not return to the coastal cities until the 1950s.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Humboldt County encompasses , of which is land and is water.

Cape Mendocino is the westernmost point in California (longitude 124 degrees, 24 minutes, 30 seconds). Humboldt Bay, the only deepwater port between San Francisco and Coos Bay, Oregon, is located on the coast at the midpoint of the county.

Humboldt County contains a diversity of plant and animal species, with significant forest and coastal habitats. In coastal areas there are extensive redwood forests. A prominent understory shrub is the toyon, whose northern range limit is in Humboldt County.

===Rivers===

Humboldt County&#x27;s major rivers include (in order of flow – in cubic meters per second – from largest to smallest):
* Klamath River
* Eel River
* Trinity River
* Mad River

The smaller rivers include Redwood Creek, significant due to amount of its flow; the Van Duzen; the Eel River syncline group composed of the South Fork, the North Fork, and the Salt River; the Mattole, Salmon, Elk, Bear, and Little rivers.

===Seismic activity===
Historically, Humboldt County and the entire far north coast of California have had many earthquakes over 6.0 magnitude. The Mendocino fracture zone is in the area.

The 1992 Cape Mendocino earthquakes were a series of three major earthquakes that occurred off the coast of Cape Mendocino, California on April 25 and 26, 1992, the largest being a 7.2. Ninety-five people were injured and property in the county sustained considerable damage.

In 2010, a 6.5 magnitude earthquake struck offshore, west of Eureka, resulting in only minor injuries and some structural damage to houses and utilities, and no fatalities reported.

In 2022, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake centered approximately from Ferndale caused damage, especially in Rio Dell.

The 2024 Cape Mendocino earthquake was a Mww  7.0 earthquake with an epicenter off the coast of Humboldt County.

The town of Arcata is built on top of an accretionary wedge. This was formed by the subduction of the Gorda plate under the North American plate.

===Climate===
The coastal zone of the county experiences very wet, cool winters and dry, mild foggy summers. In the winter, temperatures range from highs of to lows of . Coastal summers are cool to mild, with average highs of and frequent fog. Coastal summer temperatures range from highs of to lows of . In the populated areas and cities near the coast, the highest temperatures tend to occur at locations just a few miles inland from Eureka and Arcata, in towns like Fortuna, Rio Dell, and smaller unincorporated communities located somewhat further away from Humboldt Bay. In these locations summer highs are . The coastal zone experiences a number of frosty nights in winter and early spring, though snowfall and hard freezes are rare. Coastal winters are cool and wet. Winter rainstorms are frequent, with averages from a year, depending upon elevation.

Inland areas of the county also experience wet, cool winters. Snowfall is common at elevations over throughout the winter months, and is deep enough at higher elevations to have inspired the opening of a small ski lift operation (now defunct) on Horse Mountain, near Willow Creek, for several decades in the late 20th century. Summer displays the sharpest difference between the coastal and inland climates. Inland regions of Humboldt County experience highs of depending on the elevation and distance from the ocean. Occasional summer highs of are common in eastern and southern parts of the county including Orleans, Hoopa, Willow Creek, Garberville, Honeydew, and inland river valleys.

More recently vineyards have been planted in the Trinity, Klamath, Mattole and upper Eel river areas.

Notable local companies include:
* Cypress Grove Chevre
* Humboldt Creamery
* Lost Coast Brewery
* C. Crane Company
* Holly Yashi
* Eel River Brewing Company
* Six Rivers Brewery

===Cannabis===
As part of the Emerald Triangle, Humboldt County is known for its cultivation of cannabis, estimated to be worth billions of dollars. Proposition 215 allows patients and caregivers who are given a doctor&#x27;s recommendation to legally (State level only) grow up to 99 plants in Humboldt County. However, in the years before Prop 215 (early 1970s – late 1980s), Humboldt County saw a large migration of the Bay Area counter-culture to the region. Many came looking to purchase cheap land, and ended up growing marijuana to pay for their land. Especially around Garberville and Redway, the rural culture and hippie scene eventually collaborated to create a rural hippie community in which marijuana became the center of the economy and the culture. Many people prospered by producing marijuana for California and other states because of its reputation for quality. A Redway radio station, KMUD, in the past has issued warnings and alerts to the region with information on whereabouts of law enforcement on their way to raid marijuana gardens.

The Campaign Against Marijuana Planting is the multi-agency law enforcement task force managed by the California Department of Justice, formed with the prime purpose of eradicating illegal cannabis production in California. The operations began in the late 1970s, named the Northern California Sinsemilla Strike Force in 1979, but the name CAMP became used after its official establishment in 1983. While the influence of CAMP in Humboldt County has waned with decriminalization of marijuana, there is a renewed interest at the state level regarding valid growing permits and environmental concerns. As a result, CAMP is today still used as a policing body, in accordance with the DEA. Yearly CAMP reports, published by the California Department of Justice, Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement (BNE) are available online through Cal Poly Humboldt&#x27;s Special Collections. Starting in 1983, the annual reports detail the organizational structure and names of individual participants, a summary of the season&#x27;s activities, tactics, and mention of special successes, trends and hazards.

County officials and the industry have encountered challenges in the transition from an illegal, underground economy to legal recreational cannabis sales that began in California in 2018.

As of 2023, the county has the largest cannabis farming industry in the Emerald Triangle. While the largest legal pot farm in the county was , a 2021 survey found the median pot farm sito be as .

=== Lead poisoning (2017–2018) ===

Humboldt County children are at greater risk of dangerously elevated blood lead levels than Flint, Michigan&#x27;s – and almost double that of any other California county measured. The cases are concentrated in Eureka&#x27;s Old Town and downtown areas.

The last Republican presidential candidate to win a majority in the county was Ronald Reagan, a Californian, in 1984.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Humboldt also had a substantial number of people affiliated with the Green Party, but that number has declined in recent years; however, the Green Party has had its best performance by presidential and gubernatorial candidates of any county in the United States in Humboldt County, with Jill Stein gaining her largest county-level number of votes in Humboldt in 2016.

===Books===
In the book &quot;Lolita&quot; by Vladimir Nabokov there is a possible pun using the county&#x27;s name (Humboldt) in connection to the main character&#x27;s name (Humbert Humbert). This appears on page 108: &quot;With the help of a guidebook I located [The Enchanted Hunters inn] in the secluded town of Briceland.&quot; This &#x27;secluded town&#x27; could very well be a reference to the unincorporated Briceland of Humboldt County, making The Enchanted Hunters in &#x27;Humboldt Land&#x27;, continuing the novel&#x27;s grotesque fairy-tale veneer.

<text>Imperial County is a county located on the southeast border of the U.S. state of California. As of the 2020 census, the population was 179,702, making it the least populous county in Southern California. The county seat and largest city is El Centro. Imperial is the most recent California county to be established, as it was created in 1907 out of the eastern half of San Diego County.

Imperial County is located in the far southeast of California, in the Imperial Valley. It borders San Diego County to the west, Riverside County to the north, the U.S. state of Arizona to the east and the Mexican state of Baja California to the south. It includes the El Centro metropolitan statistical area and is part of the Southern California border region, the smallest but most economically diverse region in the state.

Although this region is a desert, with high temperatures and low average rainfall of per year, the economy is strongly based on agriculture. This is supported by irrigation, with water supplied wholly from the Colorado River via the All-American Canal.

The Imperial Valley straddles the border between the United States and Mexico. Imperial County is strongly influenced by Mexican culture. Approximately 80% of the county&#x27;s population is Hispanic, with the vast majority being of Mexican origin. The remainder of the population is predominantly non-Hispanic white, in addition to smaller African American, Native American, and Asian minorities.

==History==

The indigenous peoples of the area were the Quechan along the Colorado River, the Kamia-Kumeyaay west of the Quechan, and the Cahuilla to the north.

Spanish explorer Melchor Díaz was one of the first Europeans to visit the area of the Imperial Valley in 1540. The explorer Juan Bautista de Anza also explored the area in 1776. The indigenous peoples in the county were also engaged in an armed regional conflict, with the Quechan leading a coalition with the Kumeyaay against the Maricopa-led coalition with the Cahuilla, Cocopah, and other tribes in modern-day Arizona. Constant warfare would deny the Spanish explorers any overland access to Alta California, despite Spanish attempts to mediate the conflict.

Decades later, after the Mexican–American War, the northern half of the valley was annexed in 1848 by the U.S., while the southern half remained under Mexican rule.

Following the war, another war would consume the region in 1850 after the Glanton Gang sabotaged Quechan ferry operators and mugged a local Quechan chief. This would lead towards the start of the Yuma War, with a Quechan-led coalition of tribes against the US army and their indigenous allies in Baja California and Sonora. In the First Yuma War, the Quechan laid siege on Fort Yuma in 1851, and forced the American garrison there to abandon the fort. The Americans returned to the area in 1852 and subdued the Quechan by destroying their villages and farmland, and killed any warriors that resisted, leading to Quechan surrender to the US. The Second Yuma War would later see neighboring tribes erode much of the military advantages that the Quechan had left.

Small-scale settlement in natural aquifer areas had occurred in the early 19th century (the present-day site of Mexicali), but most permanent settlement was after 1900.

In 1905, torrential rainfall in the American Southwest caused the Colorado River (the only drainage for the region) to flood, including canals that had been built to irrigate the Imperial Valley. Since the valley is partially below sea level, the waters never fully receded, but collected in the Salton Sink in what is now called the Salton Sea.

Imperial County was formed in 1907 from the eastern portion of San Diego County. The county was named for Imperial Valley. This had been named for the Imperial Land Company, a subsidiary of the California Development Company, which at the turn of the 20th century had claimed the southern portion of the Colorado Desert for agriculture. The Imperial Land Company also owned extensive lands in Mexico (Baja California). Its objective was to develop commercial crop farming.

By 1910, the land company had managed to settle and develop thousands of farms on both sides of the border. The Mexican Revolution soon after severely disrupted the company&#x27;s plans. Rival Mexican armies affiliated with different ethnicities killed nearly 10,000 farmers and their families in northern Mexico. Not until the 1920s was the other side of California in the United States sufficiently peaceful and prosperous for the company to earn a return for a large percentage of Mexicans. Some chose to stay and create roots in newly developed communities in the valley.

During the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, the county attracted migrating &quot;Okies&quot; from drought-ridden farms on the plains by the need of migrant labor. More prosperous job-seekers also arrived from across the U.S. in the 1930s and 1940s. American entry into World War II stimulated the growth of jobs and need to expanded agriculture, and the All American Canal was completed from its source, the Colorado River, to Imperial Valley from 1948 to 1951. By the 1950 census, more than 50,000 residents lived in Imperial County alone, about 40 times the population of 1910. Most of the population was year-round, but would increase every winter by migrant laborers from Mexico. Until the 1960s, the farms in Imperial County provided substantial economic returns to the company and the valley.

During the Great Recession of 2008–11, El Centro had one of the highest unemployment rates (above 30–34%) in the U.S. In the early 2020s, Imperial ranks as one of California&#x27;s poorest counties. It has a lower median household income than either the state or national medians.

==Sites of interest==
===Fort Yuma===
Fort Yuma is located on the banks of the Colorado River in Winterhaven, California. First established after the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848, it was originally located in the bottoms near the Colorado River, less than below the mouth of the Gila River. It was to defend the newly settled community of Yuma, Arizona, on the other side of the Colorado River and the nearby Mexican border. In March 1851 the post was moved to a small elevation on the Colorado&#x27;s west bank, opposite the present city of Yuma, Arizona, on the site of the former Mission Puerto de Purísima Concepción. This site had been occupied by Camp Calhoun, named for John C. Calhoun, established in 1849. Fort Yuma was established to protect the southern emigrant travel route to California and to attempt control of the Yuma Indians in the surrounding area.

===Blue Angels===

NAF El Centro is the winter home of the U.S. Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, The Blue Angels. NAF El Centro historically kicks off the Blue Angels&#x27; season with their first air show, traditionally held in March.

===Imperial Valley Expo &amp; Fairgrounds===

The city of Imperial is home to the California Mid-Winter Fair and Fiesta which is the local county fair, held in late February to early March. It is also home to the Imperial Valley Speedway, a race track of .

===Algodones Sand Dunes===
 The name Algodones Dunes refers to the entire geographic feature, while the administrative designation for that portion managed by the Bureau of Land Management is the &quot;Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;Glamis Dunes&quot;). The Algodones Sand Dunes are the largest mass of sand dunes in California. This dune system extends for more than along the eastern edge of the Imperial Valley agricultural region in a band averaging in width. A major east–west route of the Union Pacific railroad skirts the eastern edge. The dune system is divided into three areas. The northernmost area is known as Mammoth Wash. South of Mammoth Wash is the North Algodones Dunes Wilderness established by the 1994 California Desert Protection Act. This area is closed to motorized use and access is by hiking and horseback. The largest and most heavily used area begins at Highway 78 and continues south just past Interstate 8. The expansive dune formations offer picturesque scenery, a chance to view rare plants and animals, and a playground for ATV and off-roading enthusiasts. The dunes are also popular in film making and have been the site for movies such as &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

===Colorado River===
The Colorado River streams through the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, approximately long, draining a part of the arid regions on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains. The natural course of the river flows from north of Grand Lake, Colorado, into the Gulf of California. For many months out of the year, however, no water actually flows from the United States to the gulf, due to human use. The river is a popular destination for water sports, including fishing, boating, water skiing, and jet skiing.

===Salvation Mountain===

Salvation Mountain is an artificial mountain north of Calipatria, California, near Slab City. It is made from adobe, straw, and thousands of gallons of paint. It was created by Leonard Knight to convey the message that &quot;God Loves Everyone&quot;. Knight refused substantial donations of money and labor from supporters who wished to modify his message of universal love to favor or disfavor particular groups.

===Anza-Borrego Desert State Park===
Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, portions of which are located in Imperial County, is the largest state park in California. of dirt roads, twelve wilderness areas, and many more miles of hiking trails provide visitors with an unparalleled opportunity to experience the wonders of the Colorado Desert. The park&#x27;s name is a combination of the last name of Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza, and the Spanish word for bighorn sheep, &quot; borrego&quot;. The park features many sweeping vistas, washes (wadis), rocky outcrops, boulder-strewn hillsides, in addition to the vast expanses of sandy desert; in springtime (especially after periods of rain), these areas appear to change shape, as they come alive with blooming wildflowers, flowering and fruiting cacti and numerous other species of native flora. Fauna that visitors may also have the chance to see include the bobcat, coyote, golden eagle, kit fox, mule deer, mountain lion, red-tailed hawk and roadrunner, as well as the iconic desert subspecies of bighorn sheep (formerly more common, across the southwest U.S. and northern Mexico). Many varied reptile species call the area home, such as the banded gecko, chuckwalla, desert iguana, desert tortoise, desert sidewinder, gopher snake, kingsnake, red diamond rattlesnake and the rosy boa.

===Fossil Canyon and Painted Gorge===
Located near Ocotillo, California in the Coyote Mountains, &quot;Fossil Canyon &quot; (and the surrounding area) is a great place for rock-hounding and fossil hunting. The fossils here are not necessarily of dinosaurs; more commonly found are ancient oyster and seashell, coral, and other marine life from the prehistoric Miocene epoch, when the entire area was submerged as part of the Western Interior Seaway.

The &quot;Painted Gorge&quot;, located on the eastern side of the Coyote Mountains, consists of sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rock; Heat and movement over time has created fantastic shapes and colors. Dark ochre, iron-reds, royal purples, and mauves (mixed with dark browns/black) create a palette of color as the sun illuminates and plays shadows upon this geologic wonder.

===Imperial NWR===

The Imperial National Wildlife Refuge protects wildlife habitat along of the lower Colorado River in Arizona and California, including the last un-channeled section before the river enters Mexico. The river and its associated backwater lakes and wetlands are a green oasis, contrasting with the surrounding desert mountains. It is a refuge and breeding area for migratory birds and local desert wildlife.

===Sonny Bono Salton Sea NWR===
The Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge is located north of the Mexican border at the southern end of the Salton Sea in California&#x27;s Imperial Valley. Situated along the Pacific Flyway, the refuge is the only one of its kind, located below sea level. Because of its southern latitude, elevation, and location in the Colorado Desert, the refuge experiences some of the highest temperatures in the nation. Daily temperatures from May to October generally exceed with temperatures of recorded yearly.

=== Museum of History in Granite ===
The Museum of History in Granite in the town of Felicity exhibits granite monuments made from Missouri Red Granite. Each is long. Subjects include a Korean War Memorial, History of Arizona, The Wall for the Ages, the eight monument History of Humanity, and the History of the United States of America. Smaller monuments include the Felicity Stone (sm), a Rosetta Stone for the future located at the center of the History of Humanity monuments.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (6.8%) is water. Much of Imperial County is below sea level. Imperial County is roughly twice the size in total square miles as the State of Delaware.

Imperial county is bordered on the north by Riverside County; on the east by Yuma County, Arizona; on the south by Mexico; and on the west by San Diego County. The Colorado River forms the county&#x27;s eastern boundary. Two notable geographic features are found in the county, the Salton Sea, at below sea level, and the Algodones Dunes, one of the largest dune fields in America.

The county is in the Colorado Desert, an extension of the larger Sonoran Desert. The Chocolate Mountains are located east of the Salton Sea, and extend in a northwest–southeast direction for approximately .

In this region, the geology is dominated by the transition of the tectonic plate boundary from rift to fault. The southernmost strands of the San Andreas Fault connect the northernmost extensions of the East Pacific Rise. Consequently, the region is subject to earthquakes, and the crust is being stretched, resulting in a sinking of the terrain over time. Related to the active geology are some interesting hydrothermal features. The area is also volcanic with multiple volcanic eruptions in the past few thousand years the most recent was 1,800 years ago.

=== Overview ===
Previously strongly Republican, Imperial County was a Democratic stronghold in presidential, congressional, and local elections until 2024. The last Republican to win a majority in the county was George H. W. Bush in 1988. However, in 2024, Republican Donald Trump flipped the county, receiving 49.12% of the vote, the highest percentage since 1988.

After Prop 8 was declared unconstitutional by a lower federal court, Imperial County continued to defend Proposition 8 in the federal judicial system. However, on February 6, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied Imperial County legal standing in the case Hollingsworth v. Perry. In 2024, Imperial County also voted against 2024 California Proposition 3, which superseded Proposition 8.

==Economy==
Thousands of acres of prime farmland have transformed the desert into one of the most productive farming regions in California with an annual crop production of over $1 billion. Agriculture is the largest industry in Imperial County and accounts for 48% of all employment. Although this region is a desert, with high temperatures and low average rainfall of per year, the economy is heavily based on agriculture due to irrigation, which is supplied wholly from the Colorado River via the All-American Canal.

A vast system of canals, check dams, and pipelines carry the water all over the valley, a system which forms the Imperial Irrigation District, or IID. The water distribution system includes over of canal and with of pipeline. The number of canal and pipeline branches number roughly over a hundred. Imported water and a long growing season allow two crop cycles each year, and the Imperial Valley is a major source of winter fruits and vegetables, cotton, and grain for U.S. and international markets. Alfalfa is another major crop produced in the Imperial Valley. The agricultural lands are served by a constructed agricultural drain system, which conveys surface runoff and subsurface drainage from fields to the Salton Sea, which is a designated repository for agricultural runoff. Imperial County produces nearly 2/3 of all vegetables consumed by Americans during the winter.

El Centro is the commercial center of Imperial County. Fifty percent of the jobs in El Centro come from the service and retail sector.

A recent growth in the interest of Imperial County as a filming location, has spurred growth in servicing this industry. Because of the county&#x27;s desert environment and proximity to Los Angeles, California, movies are sometimes filmed in the sand dunes outside the agricultural portions of the county. These have included &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, &quot;Stargate&quot;, &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;, and &quot;Into the Wild&quot;. Additionally, portions of the 2005 film &quot;Jarhead&quot; were filmed here because of its similarity to the desert terrain of Iraq.

In 2016, Imperial County had the highest unemployment rate of any county in the United States, at 23.5%.

Cotton in Imperial County and Riverside is predominantly Bt cotton. This is in contrast to the rest of the state, which largely relies on non-incorporated pesticides. The introduction of Bt cotton has dramatically reduced pesticide use here.

===Renewable energy===
Imperial Valley has become a hotbed of renewable energy projects, both solar and geothermal. This is driven in part by California&#x27;s mandate to generate 20% of its power from renewable sources by the end of 2010, the valley&#x27;s excellent sun resources, the high unemployment, its proximity to large population centers on the coast, and large tracts of otherwise unusable desert land. Much of the land suitable for green energy is owned by the federal government (Bureau of Land Management). As of April 2008, the BLM has received 163 applications to build renewable energy projects on in California. Almost all of these are planned for the Imperial Valley and the desert region north of the valley. Stirling Energy is currently building one of the world&#x27;s largest solar thermal plants, with 38,000 &quot;sun catchers,&quot; it will power up to 600,000 homes once it is fully operational by around 2015. CalEnergy runs a geothermal plant that generates enough power for 300,000 homes and could tap into more for up to 2.5 million homes.

<text>Inyo County () is a county in the eastern central part of the U.S. state of California, located between the Sierra Nevada and the state of Nevada. In the 2020 census, the population was 19,016. The county seat is Independence. Inyo County is on the east side of the Sierra Nevada and southeast of Yosemite National Park in Central California. It contains the Owens River Valley; it is flanked to the west by the Sierra Nevada and to the east by the White Mountains and the Inyo Mountains. With an area of , Inyo is the second-largest county by area in California, after San Bernardino County. Almost half of that area is within Death Valley National Park. However, with a population density of 1.8 people per square mile, it also has the second-lowest population density in California, after Alpine County.

==History==

Present-day Inyo county has been the historic homeland for thousands of years of the Mono, Timbisha, Kawaiisu, and Northern Paiute Native Americans. The descendants of these ancestors continue to live in their traditional homelands in the Owens River Valley and in Death Valley National Park.
Inyo County was formed in 1866 out of the territory of the unorganized Coso County, which had been created on April 4, 1864, from parts of Mono County and Tulare County. It acquired more territory from Mono County in 1870 and Kern County and San Bernardino County in 1872.

For many years it has been commonly believed that the county derived its name from the Mono tribe&#x27;s name for the mountains in its former homeland. Actually the name came to be thought of, mistakenly, as the name of the mountains to the east of the Owens Valley when the first whites there asked the local Owens Valley Paiutes for the name of the mountains to the east. They responded that that was the land of Inyo. They meant by this that those lands belonged to the Timbisha tribe headed by a man whose name was Inyo. Inyo was the name of the headman of one of the Timbisha bands at the time of contact when the first whites, the Bennett-Arcane Party of 1849, wandered, lost, into Death Valley on their expedition to the gold fields of western California. The Owens Valley whites misunderstood the reference and thought that Inyo was the name of the mountains when actually it was the name of the chief, or headman, of the tribe that had those mountains as part of their homeland. In Timbisha, &quot;ɨnnɨyun&quot; means &quot;it&#x27;s (or he&#x27;s) dangerous&quot;.

To supply the growing City of Los Angeles, water was diverted from the Owens River into the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913. The Owens River Valley cultures and environments changed substantially. From the 1910s to 1930s the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased much of the valley for water rights and control. In 1941 the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power extended the Los Angeles Aqueduct system farther upriver into the Mono Basin.

==Natural history==
Inyo County is host to a number of natural superlatives. Among them are:
* Mount Whitney, with an elevation of , the highest point in the contiguous United States, the 12th highest peak in the U.S., and the 24th highest peak in North America.
* Badwater Basin, in Death Valley, the lowest point in North America
* Methuselah, an ancient Bristlecone pine tree and one of the oldest living trees on Earth
* Owens Valley, the deepest valley on the American continents
* Two mountain ranges exceeding in elevation: The Sierra Nevada and the White Mountains
* Ten of California&#x27;s twelve peaks which exceed 14,000 feet (a Fourteener) in elevation; the isolated Mount Shasta in northern California, and White Mountain Peak in neighboring Mono County, are the only California 14ers not (at least partly) in Inyo County
* The largest escarpment in the United States, rising from the floor of Death Valley to the top of Telescope Peak in the Panamint Range

==Geography==
Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the contiguous United States, is on Inyo County&#x27;s western border (with Tulare County). The Badwater Basin in Death Valley National Park, the lowest place in North America, is in eastern Inyo County. The difference between the two points is about . They are not visible from each other, but both can be observed from the Panamint Range on the west side of Death Valley, above the Panamint Valley. Thus, Inyo County has the greatest elevation difference among all of the counties and county-equivalents in the contiguous United States.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water. It is the second-largest county by area in California and the ninth-largest in the United States (excluding boroughs and census areas in Alaska).

There are 22 official wilderness areas in Inyo County that are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. This is the second-largest number of any county, exceeded only by San Bernardino County&#x27;s 35 wilderness areas. Most of these are managed solely by the Bureau of Land Management, but four are integral components of Death Valley National Park or Inyo National Forest and are thus managed by either the National Park Service or the Forest Service. Some of these wilderness areas also extend into neighboring counties.

Except as noted, the wilderness areas are managed solely by the Bureau of Land Management and lie entirely within Inyo County:
* Argus Range Wilderness
* Coso Range Wilderness
* Darwin Falls Wilderness
* Death Valley Wilderness (part)

===Death Valley National Park===
Death Valley National Park is a mostly arid United States National Park east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in southern Inyo County and northern San Bernardino County in California, with a small extension into southwestern Nye County and extreme southern Esmeralda County in Nevada. In addition, there is an exclave (Devil&#x27;s Hole) in southern Nye County. The park covers , encompassing Saline Valley, a large part of Panamint Valley, almost all of Death Valley, and parts of several mountain ranges. Death Valley National Monument was proclaimed in 1933, placing the area under federal protection. In 1994, the monument was redesignated a national park, as well as being substantially expanded to include Saline and Eureka Valleys.

It is the hottest and driest of the national parks in the United States. It also features the second-lowest point in the Western Hemisphere and the lowest point in North America at the Badwater Basin, which is below sea level. It is home to many species of plants and animals that have adapted to this harsh desert environment. Some examples include Creosote Bush, Bighorn Sheep, Coyote, and the Death Valley Pupfish, a survivor of much wetter times. Approximately 95% of the park is designated as wilderness. Death Valley National Park is visited annually by more than 770,000 visitors who come to enjoy its diverse geologic features, desert wildlife, historic sites, scenery, clear night skies, and the solitude of the extreme desert environment.

=== Overview ===

Inyo has historically been a strongly Republican county in Presidential and congressional elections. From 1944 to 2016, the only Democrat to win the county (and the last to win a majority of its vote) was Lyndon Johnson in 1964.

However, the county shifted significantly leftward in 2020, narrowly supporting Joe Biden over Donald Trump. As a result, it became one of only two counties that previously voted for Trump by double digits in 2016 to flip to the Democrats, the other being Talbot County, Maryland.

Inyo still leans Republican. It voted Republican in all statewide races held in 2022. It flipped back to voting for Donald Trump in 2024, though by a much smaller margin than Trump had won the county in 2016.













In the California State Legislature, Inyo County is in , and .

The county is in .

On November 4, 2008, Inyo County voted 60.6% for Proposition 8 which amended the California Constitution to ban same-sex marriages.

The county was home to Manzanar Internment Camp, where Japanese Americans were interned during World War II. Although the county was typically Democratic before World War II, in the decades since Japanese internment the county has been solidly Republican, only voting for Lyndon Johnson (who signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964) and Joe Biden (who ran on a ticket with Kamala Harris, the first Asian American to be part of a major party ticket).

==Transportation==
In the 1920s, automobile clubs and nearby towns started to lobby for trans-Sierra highways over Piute Pass and other locations. However, by end of the 1920s, the Forest Service and the Sierra Club decided that roadless wilderness in the Sierra was valuable, and fought the proposal. The Piute Pass proposal faded out by the early 1930s, with the Forest Service proposing a route over Minaret Summit in 1933. The Minaret Summit route was lobbied against by California&#x27;s Governor Ronald Reagan in 1972. The expansion of the John Muir and Ansel Adams Wildernesses in the 1980s sealed off the Minaret Summit route.

A trans-Sierra route between Porterville and Lone Pine was proposed by local businessmen in 1923. Eventually, a circuitous route across the Sierra was built across the only trans-Sierra route south of Yosemite: Sherman Pass by 1976. That route is Forest Route 22S05 to the west, and Kennedy Meadow Road (County Route J41) and 9-Mile Canyon Road to the east.

<text>A law is a universal principle that describes the fundamental nature of something, the universal properties and the relationships between things, or a description that purports to explain these principles and relationships.

== Laws of nature ==

For example, physical laws such as the law of gravity or scientific laws attempt to describe the fundamental nature of the universe itself. Laws of mathematics and logic describe the nature of rational thought and inference (Kant&#x27;s transcendental idealism, and differently G. Spencer-Brown&#x27;s work &quot;Laws of Form&quot;, was precisely a determination of the &quot;a priori&quot; laws governing human thought before any interaction whatsoever with experience).

Within most fields of study, and in science in particular, the elevation of some principle of that field to the status of law usually takes place after a very long time during which the principle is used and tested and verified; though in some fields of study such laws are simply postulated as a foundation and assumed. Mathematical laws are somewhere in between: they are often arbitrary and unproven in themselves, but they are sometimes judged by how useful they are in making predictions about the real world. However, they ultimately rely on arbitrary axioms.

== Laws in social sciences ==

The question of whether &quot;laws&quot; can be applied to the social sciences in the same way as the natural sciences has been debated for many years. Philosophers such as Lee McIntyre are optimistic that &quot;law-like&quot; explanations of human behavior can be valid and useful.

Laws of economics are an attempt in modelization of economic behavior. Marxism criticized the belief in eternal laws of economics, which it considered a product of the dominant ideology. It claimed that in fact, those so-called laws of economics were only the historical laws of capitalism, that is of a particular historical social formation. With the advent, in the 20th century, of the application of mathematical, statistical, and experimental techniques to economics, economic theory matured into a corpus of knowledge rooted in the scientific method rather than in philosophical argument.

==Miscellaneous==

Finally, the term is sometimes applied to less rigorous ideas that may be interesting observations or relationships, practical or ethical guidelines (also called rules of thumb), and even humorous parodies of such laws.

Examples of scientific laws include Boyle&#x27;s law of gases, conservation laws, Ohm&#x27;s law, and others. Laws of other fields of study include Occam&#x27;s razor as a principle of philosophy and Say&#x27;s law in economics. Examples of observed phenomena often described as laws include the Titius-Bode law of planetary positions, Zipf&#x27;s law of linguistics, Thomas Malthus&#x27;s Principle of Population or Malthusian Growth Model, Moore&#x27;s law of technological growth. Other laws are pragmatic and observational, such as the law of unintended consequences.

Some humorous parodies of such laws include adages such as Murphy&#x27;s law and its many variants, and Godwin&#x27;s Law of Internet conversations.

<text>In Greek mythology, Strophius (; Ancient Greek: Στρόφιος means &quot;slippery fellow, twister&quot;) was the name of the following personages:

* Strophius, son of Crisus, was a King of Phocis, husband of the sister of Agamemnon (whose name was either Anaxibia, Astyocheia or Cydragora) and, by her, father of Pylades and Astydameia.

<text>In Greek mythology, Pylades (; Ancient Greek: Πυλάδης) was a Phocian prince as the son of King Strophius and Anaxibia who is the daughter of Atreus and sister of Agamemnon and Menelaus. He is mostly known for his relationship with his cousin Orestes, son of Agamemnon.

== Mythology ==
===Orestes and Pylades===
Orestes had been sent to Phocis during his mother Clytemnestra&#x27;s affair with Aegisthus. There he was raised with Pylades, and so considered him to be his closest friend. While Orestes was away, Clytemnestra killed her husband, Orestes&#x27; father Agamemnon.

===Death of Aegisthus and Clytemnestra===
As an adult, Orestes returns to Mycenae/Argos to avenge the murder of Agamemnon. With the assistance of his friend Pylades, Orestes kills his mother Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus. While Pylades seems to be a very minor character, he is arguably the most vital piece of Orestes&#x27; plan to avenge his father. In &quot;The Libation Bearers,&quot; the second play of Aeschylus&#x27; trilogy &quot;The Oresteia&quot;, Pylades speaks only once. His lines come at the moment Orestes begins to falter and second-guess his decision to kill his mother. It is Pylades who convinces Orestes to follow through with his plan for revenge and carry out the murder. The significance of Pylades&#x27; lines has invited speculation into whether or not he might represent something more than human next to Orestes; he might play the role of divine encouragement or fate.

In other versions of the revenge of Orestes and Electra (the &quot;Electra&quot; of Sophocles and the &quot;Electra&quot; of Euripides), Pylades accompanies Orestes, but does not speak. In the Sophocles version, Orestes pretends to be dead and Pylades carries the urn supposedly holding his friend&#x27;s remains.

According to Pausanias, Pylades killed two sons of Nauplius (Oeax and Nausimedon) who had come to aid Aegisthus.

===Attempted murder of Helen===
Pylades returns to his homeland, but is exiled by his father for taking part in the crime. He then returns to Orestes&#x27; side and helps him to come up with a plan to avoid execution. They attempt to murder Helen, wife of Orestes&#x27; uncle Menelaus, after he proves to be of no help in protecting Orestes. However, their attempt fails through the intervention of the gods. They then take hostage Hermione, daughter of Helen and Menelaus. Apollo arrives to settle the situation and gives them all instructions, including one for Pylades to marry Orestes&#x27; sister Electra. Many of these events are depicted in Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Orestes&quot;.

===Tauris===
Pylades plays a major role in another of Euripides&#x27; plays, &quot;Iphigeneia in Tauris&quot;. In order to escape the persecutions of the Erinyes, Orestes is ordered by Apollo to go to Tauris, carry off the statue of Artemis, which had fallen from heaven, and bring it to Athens. He goes to Tauris with Pylades and the pair are at once imprisoned by the people, among whom the custom is to sacrifice all strangers to Artemis. Orestes is seized by a mania for fear of the barbarians; Pylades tends to him, acting, as described in Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Amores&quot; &quot;not only like a lover but like a father.&quot; The priestess of Artemis, whose duty it is to perform the sacrifice, is Orestes&#x27; sister Iphigeneia. She offers to release Orestes if he carries home a letter from her to Greece; he refuses to go, but bids Pylades take the letter while he himself stays to be slain. Pylades eventually agrees, but the letter causes Orestes to recognise Iphigenia and reveal himself. The three escape together, carrying with them the image of Artemis.

==Pylades and Orestes==

The relationship between Orestes and Pylades has been presented by some authors of the Roman era as romantic or homoerotic. The dialogue &quot;Erotes&quot; (&quot;Affairs of the Heart&quot;), attributed to Lucian, compares the merits and advantages of heterosexuality and homoeroticism, and Orestes and Pylades are presented as the principal representatives of a loving friendship:

: “Phocis preserves from early times the memory between Orestes and Pylades, who taking a god as witness of the passion between them, sailed through life together as though in one boat. Both together put to death Klytemnestra, as though both were sons of Agamemnon; and Aegisthus was slain by both. Pylades suffered more than his friend by the punishment which pursued Orestes. He stood by him when condemned, nor did they limit their tender partnership to the bounds of Greece, but sailed to the farthest boundaries of the Scythians – the one sick, the other ministering to him. When they had come into the Tauric land, straightaway they were met by the matricidal fury; and while the inhabitants were standing round in a circle, Orestes fell down and lay on the ground, seized by his usual condition, while Pylades ‘wiped away the foam, tended his body, and covered him with his well-woven cloak’ – acting not only like a brother but like a father too. When it was determined that one should remain to be put to death, and the other should go to Mycenae to convey a letter, each wishes to remain for the sake of the other, thinking that if he saves the life of his friend, he saves his own life. Orestes refuses to take the letter, saying that Pylades was more worthy to carry it, acting more like the older lover than the younger. ‘For,’ he said, ‘the slaying of this man would be a great grief to me, as I am the cause of these misfortunes.’ And he added, ‘Give the tablet to him, for (turning to Pylades) I will send thee to Argos, in order that it may be well with thee; as for me, let anyone kill me who desires it.’ Such love is always like that; for when from boyhood a serious love has grown up and it becomes adult at the age of reason, the long-loved object returns reciprocal affection, and it is hard to determine which the lover of which, for – as from a mirror – the affection of the lover is reflected from the beloved.” (47, W. J. Baylis)
In 1734, George Frederic Handel&#x27;s opera &quot;Oreste&quot; (based on Giangualberto Barlocci&#x27;s Roman libretto of 1723), was premiered in London&#x27;s Covent Garden. The fame of Lucian&#x27;s works in the 18th century, as well as the generally well-known tradition of Greco-Roman heroic homoeroticism, made it natural for theatre audiences of that period to have recognized an intense, romantic, if not positively homoerotic quality, to the relationship between Orestes and Pylades.

==Other Pylades in history==
After the assassination of Roman Emperor Pertinax by the Pretorian Guard and the auctioning of the Emperorship, the new emperor, Didius Julianus, celebrated as follows: &quot;A magnificent feast was prepared by his order, and he amused himself till a very late hour, with dice, and the performances of Pylades, a celebrated dancer.&quot;

<text>Kern County is a county located in the U.S. state of California. As of the 2020 census, the population was 909,235. Its county seat is Bakersfield.

Kern County comprises the Bakersfield, California, metropolitan statistical area. The county spans the southern end of the Central Valley. Covering , it ranges west to the southern slope of the Coast Ranges, and east beyond the southern slope of the eastern Sierra Nevada into the Mojave Desert, at the city of Ridgecrest. Its northernmost city is Delano, and its southern reach extends to just beyond Frazier Park, and the northern extremity of the parallel Antelope Valley.

The county&#x27;s economy is heavily linked to agriculture and petroleum extraction. Also, a strong aviation, space, and military industry is present, such as Edwards Air Force Base, the China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station, and the Mojave Air and Space Port.

With a population that is 54.9% Hispanic as of 2020, Kern is California&#x27;s third-most populous majority-Hispanic county and the sixth-largest nationwide.

==History==

===Indigenous Era===
Native Americans lived in this region for hundreds of years: Chumash, tribes grouped together under the settler name Yokuts, and others.

===Spanish era===
Spain claimed the area in 1769. Entering from Grapevine Canyon to the south in 1772, Commander Don Pedro Fages became the first European known to set foot in the area.

The Battle of San Emigdio took place in Kern County in March 1824. The Chumash Native Americans of Mission Santa Barbara rebelled against the Mexican government and its taking over mission property and ejecting the natives. The battle occurred in the canyon where San Emigdio Creek flows down San Emigdio Mountain and the Blue Ridge, south of Bakersfield near today&#x27;s Highway 166. Mexican forces from Monterey were commanded by Carlos Carrillo and the conflict was a low-casualty encounter, with only four Native Americans being killed and no Mexicans. The surviving Native Americans were pacified and brought back to Santa Barbara in June 1824 after a pursuit and negotiation, in which many were allowed to keep their arms for the return march over the mountains.

===American era===
In the beginning, what was to become Kern County was dominated by mining in the mountains and in the desert. In 1855, the California legislature attempted to form a county in the area by giving the southeastern territory of Tulare County on the west of the Sierra Nevada Mountains to Buena Vista County. it was never officially organized prior to 1859, though, when the enabling legislation expired. The south of Tulare County was later organized as Kern County in 1866, with additions from Los Angeles and San Bernardino Counties. Its first county seat was the mining town of Havilah, in the mountains east of Bakersfield and north of Tehachapi.

Settlers considered the flat land of the valley inhospitable and impassable at the time due to swamps, lakes, tule reeds, and diseases such as malaria. This changed when residents started draining land for farming and constructing canals, most dug by hired Chinese laborers. Within 10 years, the valley surpassed the mining areas as the economic power of the county, and as a result, the county seat was moved from Havilah to Bakersfield in 1874.

In 1899, the discovery well of the Kern River Oil Field was dug by hand, and soon the towns of Oil City, Oil Center, and Oildale came into existence.

====Etymology====
The county derives its name from the Kern River, which was named for Edward Kern, cartographer for General John C. Frémont&#x27;s 1845 expedition, which crossed Walker Pass. The Kern River was originally named Rio Bravo de San Felipe by Father Francisco Garcés when he explored the area in 1776.

====Earthquakes====
Throughout recorded history, severe earthquakes have struck Kern County, including the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake.

On July 21, 1952, an earthquake occurred with the epicenter about south of Bakersfield. It measured 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale and killed 12 people. In addition to the deaths, it was responsible for hundreds of injuries and more than $60 million in property damage. The main shock was felt over much of California and as far away as Phoenix, Arizona, and Reno, Nevada. The earthquake occurred on the White Wolf Fault and was the strongest to occur in California since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Tehachapi suffered the greatest damage and loss of life from the earthquake, though its effects were widely felt throughout central and southern California. The event had a significant aftershock sequence that persisted into July and August, with the strongest coming on August 22, an M5.8 event with a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (severe) and resulted in two additional deaths and an additional $10 million in property damage. Repercussions of the sequence of earthquakes were still being felt in the heavily damaged downtown area of Bakersfield well into the 1990s, as city leaders attempted to improve safety of the surviving unreinforced masonry buildings.

Following the event, a field survey was conducted along the fault zone, with the goal of estimating the peak ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating rock formations and other indicators. Ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed, both in the valley and in the foothills, with both vertical and horizontal displacements present in the epicenter area. The motion records that were acquired from the event were significant, and a reconnaissance report was recognized for its coverage of the event, and its setting a standard for similar engineering or scientific papers.

====Abuse trials====
Between 1983 and 1986, several ritual sex ring child-abuse cases occurred in Kern County, resulting in numerous long prison sentences, all of which were overturned—some of them decades later, because the prosecutors had coerced false testimonies from the purported child victims. The details of these false accusations are covered extensively in the 2008 documentary &quot;Witch Hunt&quot;, narrated by Sean Penn.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which (0.4%) is covered by water. It is the third-largest county by area in California. The tallest peak in the county is Sawmill Mountain with an elevation of 8822 ft. Its area is nearly the size of the state of New Hampshire; it extends:

* East beyond the southern slope of the Sierra Nevada range into the Mojave Desert, and includes parts of the Indian Wells Valley and Antelope Valley
* West from the Sierra across the floor of the San Joaquin Valley to the eastern edge of the Temblor Range, part of the Coast Ranges
* South over the ridge of the Tehachapi Mountains

=== Air quality ===

Kern County suffers from severe air pollution. Particulates cause poor visibility, especially in the winter. Western Kern County lies in the San Joaquin Valley and the topography traps pollutants. Although the topography is not as unfavorable in eastern Kern County,it is a non-attainment area for particulates. Air pollution caused by particulates is &quot;in the unhealthy range an average of 40 days a year, according to the American Lung Association&#x27;s &quot;2018 State of the Air Report&quot;.

===Vegetation===
Chaparral comprises a considerable portion of the natural area within Kern County; the species diversity within these chaparral habitats, however, is considerably less than in many other regions of California. Whitethorn is a prominent example of chaparral species on the rocky slopes of the Sierra Nevada and the Inner Coastal Ranges. California buckeye is a notable tree found in both chaparral and forests and whose southern range terminates in Kern County.

===National protected areas===

* Bitter Creek National Wildlife Refuge
* Carrizo Plain National Monument (part)

Kern is a strongly Republican county in Presidential and congressional elections. The last Democratic candidate for president to win a majority in the county was Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The county is also a Republican stronghold at the state level, with Jerry Brown being the last Democrat to win the county in a gubernatorial election in 1978. Kern remains the only county in Southern California that consistently votes Republican in recent elections. While Republican margins in the county had been shrinking, with Donald Trump&#x27;s 10.2% margin of victory in 2020 being the smallest since Gerald Ford&#x27;s 6.7% majority in 1976, Trump regained his margins in 2024 and even surpassed previous performances, with his 21% margin being the best since George Bush in 2004. Some constituencies in Kern County in particular some of the most widely contested in California, and the United States as of the early 2020s, with the 2022 race for the 22nd US House district being close, and the 26th Senate District having one of the tightest margins in electoral history, with incumbent Democrat Melissa Hurtado retaining her seat by 13 votes.

Democratic strength is concentrated in the small agricultural towns in the San Joaquin Valley portion of the county, such as Arvin, Delano, McFarland, Shafter, and Wasco. Unincorporated communities close to agricultural areas, such as Lamont and Lost Hills, are Democratic strongholds. The eastern and southern parts of Bakersfield, along with unincorporated East Bakersfield, have also become reliably Democratic. Republican strength is found in the foothill, mountain, and high desert communities of the county. The cities of Maricopa, Ridgecrest, Taft, and Tehachapi are Republican strongholds. Along with the northern parts of Bakersfield, the wealthy unincorporated area of Rosedale and working-class Oildale are also seen as being strongly Republican. Cities including California City and the western areas of Bakersfield are seen as competitive in most elections. Bakersfield as a whole is seen as being competitive with a Republican lean.

=== Cities by population and crime rates ===

==Economy==

The county has a large agricultural base and is a significant producer of oil, natural gas, hydro-electric power, Biomass, solar power, and wind power. Kern is noted for minerals, including gold, borate, and kernite. The largest open pit mine in California, which mines borax, is at Boron. As of October 1, 2016, Kern County contains nearly 25% of California&#x27;s in-state renewable energy production, including 1,785 MW of solar power and 3,310 MW of wind power. Kern County is home to the Tehachapi Energy Storage Project, which was commissioned in 2014.

===Aerospace and military===
Department of Defense facilities include Edwards Air Force Base and China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station. As home to Edwards Air Force Base the Air Force&#x27;s main flight test facility, Kern has been the site of many milestones, including the first supersonic flight and the first landing of the Space Shuttle. The base has brought prosperity to the railroad towns of Mojave and Rosamond. Kern County is also the home of the first inland spaceport in the United States, the Mojave Spaceport.

===Agriculture===
This has long been one of the county&#x27;s biggest industries. Between 2012 and 2013 the produced value of ag products increased 6%, to a total of $6.8 billion. Grape is 31%, almond is 17%, milk is 13%, citrus is 11%, cattle + calves and pistachio are both 7%, carrots are only 6% (but that&#x27;s 80% of carrots for the entire United States), hay is 4%, and cotton and potatoes are both 2%, of that. This is one of the highest-producing locations in the United States for vegetables, and also for watermelons. Vegetables are estimated to total $320 million every year. There are about 1,938 farms, at an average size of (however 41% are smaller than ), being the primary employment of 63% of operators.

Major producer of almonds with production greater than annually. That is third of all the counties, 16% of the state&#x27;s production. (See also almond in California.)

Pistachio is another important employer here. The Michailides &amp; Avenot group finds severe boscalid resistance in isolates of &quot;Alternaria alternata&quot; pathogenic on pistachio here. They find extensive such resistance in a swathe from the center down into the central southern part of the state, but especially here. (See also Pistachio in California and boscalid in California.)

The Glassy-Winged Sharpshooter (&quot;Homalodisca vitripennis&quot;) is a major insect pest in this county, including in this county&#x27;s citrus groves. (See also Glassy-Winged Sharpshooter in California.)

===Petroleum===
, Kern is California&#x27;s top oil-producing county, with 78% of the state&#x27;s 56,653 active oil wells and 71% of oil production. The county produced 144.5 million barrels of oil in 2015, accounting for about 4% of overall U.S. oil production.

====Discovery and development====
Oil development began with the 1894 discovery of the Midway-Sunset Oil Field, now the third-largest in the United States, in the southwestern portion of Kern County near Maricopa. The 1899 discovery along the Kern River was a breakthrough in oil production. Oil was refined here even before the establishment of the county. The Buena Vista Petroleum Company was organized and incorporated in 1864. Soon thereafter a refinery was built that operated until April 1867 when work ceased because of high freight charges.

The 1910 Lakeview Gusher was the largest recorded oil strike in U.S. history. The well spewed approximately nine million barrels for 18 months before workers finally were able to cap it.

Other big oil fields in southwestern Kern County discovered early in the 20th century include the Buena Vista, the South Belridge and the Cymric fields. The latter is the fastest-growing field in California in terms of barrels produced per year. Later large fields include the Kern River Oil Field, the fifth-largest in the U.S., the adjacent Kern Front Oil Field, the Mount Poso Oil Field in the lower foothills of the Sierra north-northeast of Bakersfield and the Fruitvale Oil Field, which underlies much of the city of Bakersfield, along and north of the Kern River.

On July 22, 2009, Occidental Petroleum announced it had discovered the equivalent of 150 million to 250 million barrels of oil in Kern County, which the company called the largest oil discovery in California in 35 years. The find added about 10 percent to California&#x27;s known reserves. Occidental&#x27;s Ray Irani said it is likely that more oil would be found in the areas outside the initial six wells that tapped the discovery. Occidental has not revealed the exact location of the find, two-thirds of which is natural gas. BNET, an industry web publication, said the find would add to the company&#x27;s 708 million barrels of proven reserves in California.

====Petroleum today====
The county today contributes more than three-quarters of all the oil produced onshore in California. Some of the large oil fields in Kern County which are still active include:
*Buena Vista Oil Field

<text>In Greek mythology, Chrysothemis or Khrysothemis (; , &quot;golden law&quot;) is a name ascribed to several female characters in Greek mythology.

* Chrysothemis, daughter of Carmator and the first winner of the oldest contest held at the Pythian Games, the singing of a hymn to Apollo. She was the wife of Staphylus or a lover of Apollo.
*Chrysothemis, a Hesperide pictured and named on an ancient vase together with Asterope, Hygieia and Lipara.
* Chrysothemis, daughter of Danaus. She married (and killed) Asterides, son of Aegyptus.
* Chrysothemis, daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. Unlike her sister, Electra, Chrysothemis did not protest or enact vengeance against their mother for having an affair with Aegisthus and then killing their father. She appears in Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Electra&quot;.

<text>Kings County is a county located in the U.S. state of California. The population was 152,486 at the 2020 census. The county seat is Hanford.

Kings County comprises the Hanford-Corcoran, CA metropolitan statistical area, which is also included in the Visalia-Porterville-Hanford, CA combined statistical area. It is in the San Joaquin Valley, a rich agricultural region.

==History==
The area was inhabited for thousands of years by Native Americans including the Tachi Yokuts tribe. They continue to live in the area on the Santa Rosa Rancheria. It was colonized by Spain, Mexico and the United States.

An 1805 expedition probably led by Spanish Army Lieutenant Gabriel Moraga recorded discovering the river, which they named &quot;El Rio de los Santos Reyes&quot; (River of the Holy Kings) after the Three Wise Men of the Bible. At the time of the United States conquest of California in 1848, the new government changed the name to Kings River after which the county was named.

In 1880, a dispute over land titles between settlers and the Southern Pacific Railroad resulted in a bloody gun battle on a farm northwest of Hanford; seven men died. This event became known as the Mussel Slough Tragedy.

Kings County was formed in 1893 from the western part of Tulare County. In 1909, by an act of the state legislature, of Fresno County territory was added to the northwest portion of Kings County.

Settlers reclaimed Tulare Lake and its wetlands for agricultural development. In surface area, it was formerly the largest body of freshwater west of the Great Lakes, and supported a large population of migratory birds as well as local birds and wildlife. Monoculture has sharply reduced habitat for many species.

In 1928, oil was discovered in the Kettleman Hills located in the southwestern part of Kings County. The Kettleman North Dome Oil Field became one of the most productive oil fields in the United States.

During the Great Depression, over 18,000 cotton pickers in the southern San Joaquin Valley, mostly migrant Mexican workers, went on strike in the California agricultural strikes of 1933. During the strike, 3,500 striking farm workers lived in a four-acre camp on the land of a small farmer on the outskirts of Corcoran. Ultimately, the federal government intervened to force both sides to negotiate a settlement.

Lemoore Army Airfield was established for training and defense during World War II. In 1961, the U.S. Navy opened NAS Lemoore west of Lemoore, not far from the earlier site.

The completion of the California Aqueduct in the early 1970s brought needed water for agriculture and domestic use to the west side of the county.

The gross value of all agricultural crops and products produced during 2018 in Kings County was $2,351,983,000. Kings County is 10th among California counties in agricultural production. The top commodity in 2018 was milk with a value of $676.7 million. Other major agricultural commodities included pistachios, cotton, cattle and calves, almonds and processing tomatoes. Another major employer is NAS Lemoore, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s newest and largest master jet base. According to a Navy study in 2008, payroll, base spending, retiree and veterans&#x27; checks total more than $1 billion in annual economic impact to the region. Other important employers include a Del Monte Foods tomato processing plant, Adventist Health, the J. G. Boswell Company, an Olam International tomato processing facility, Leprino Foods, the largest mozzarella cheese maker in the world, the Kings County Government and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation which operates three state prisons in Kings County.

In 2018, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, average per capita income was $35,306 in Kings County, which ranked it last of California&#x27;s 58 counties. Per capita personal income is calculated by dividing the population by the total personal income of the area&#x27;s residents. In Kings County&#x27;s case, the U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s estimated population of 151,366 was used for that calculation. However, the population estimate includes incarcerated persons with little or no income.

Kings County did not escape the effects of the Great Recession. The unemployment rate in May 2012 was 14.9%, up from 10.1% in July 2008. However, the rate had dropped to 9.8% in February 2020 at the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate had risen to 16.8% in April of that year.

Kings County&#x27;s dairy industry dropped from $670 million in milk sold in 2008 to $411 million in 2009 - a 39% drop. By mid-2009, the price paid to milk producers had dropped to a point that was far below the cost of production according to a July 2009 quote from Bill Van Dam, CEO of the Alliance of Western Milk Producers. By December 2010, milk prices had increased to about $13 per hundredweight from a low of below $10 in 2009. However, the price of corn used for feed had increased because of its use by the ethanol industry. Van Dam was quoted that month as saying that at current prices, dairy operators are at or close to the break-even point. By the summer of 2012, it was reported that despite a milk price of about $15 per hundredweight, the rising cost of cattle feed had caused many dairy farmers to sell all or part of their herds and even file for bankruptcy. In 2014, milk prices were topping $22 per hundredweight and the value of milk sold rose to $970 million in that year. However, by March 2016 milk was reportedly selling closer to $13 per hundredweight.

<doc id="80562" wikidata="Q514694" url="?curid=80562" title="Homage to Catalonia">
<text>Homage to Catalonia is a 1938 memoir by English writer George Orwell, in which he accounts his personal experiences and observations while fighting in the Spanish Civil War.

Covering the period between December 1936 and June 1937, Orwell recounts Catalonia&#x27;s revolutionary fervor during his training in Barcelona, his boredom on the front lines in Aragon, his involvement in the interfactional May Days conflict back in Barcelona on leave, his getting shot in the throat back on the front lines, and his escape to France after the POUM was declared an illegal organization. The war was one of the defining events of his political outlook and a significant part of what led him to write in 1946, &quot;Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, &quot;against&quot; totalitarianism and &quot;for&quot; democratic socialism, as I understand it.&quot;

Initial reception was mixed, often depending on whether the reviewers&#x27; analyses of events aligned with Orwell&#x27;s. Praise was reserved for his vivid depiction of life on the frontlines, while criticisms were aimed at his denunciations of the Republican government and Communist Party. It received a second wave of popularity during the 1950s, after the popularity of Orwell&#x27;s novels &quot;Animal Farm&quot; (1945) and &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949) attracted a reevaluation of the book, with American liberal intellectuals presenting it as a work of anti-communism. During the 1960s, figures in the New Left again recontextualised it through the lens of revolutionary socialism, opposed both to Marxism-Leninism and capitalism, which attracted another wave of criticism from figures in the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). Since the Spanish transition to democracy, it has received a reevaluation by historians in debates about its quality as a primary source, with British historian Tom Buchanan noting its limited, unbalanced viewpoint and cautioning against reading it as a representation of the conflict as a whole.

== Background ==

=== Historical context ===
During the 19th century, a motif known as &quot;the two Spains&quot; began to emerge in Spanish literature, in which writers such as Mariano José de Larra depicted a polarised Spain, divided into progressive and conservative factions. When the Second Spanish Republic was established in 1931, it came at a time when Europe was experiencing rise in far-right politics, including fascism and Nazism. The Spanish Civil War broke out on 18 July 1936, when the Nationalist faction of the Spanish Army, supported by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, launched a coup d&#x27;état against the elected government of the Spanish Republic. 
As the Republican government was initially paralysed by the coup, resistance to it was organised by the general population in cities throughout the country, culminating in a social revolution that saw anarchist and socialist workers bring Spain&#x27;s industrial economy under social ownership. By the autumn of 1936, workers&#x27; militias had defeated the Nationalist coup in Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia, forming a frontline through Aragon and New Castile that divided Spain into Republican and Nationalist zones. The Republican faction consisted of several different political parties and trade unions, of varying political positions and influence, including: the National Confederation of Labour (CNT), an anarchist trade union which controlled the Barcelona metropolitan area; the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), a small Trotskyist party; the General Union of Workers (UGT), a socialist trade union which predominated in Bilbao and Madrid; and the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) and Communist Party of Spain (PCE), which had amalgamated together in Catalonia into the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC).

The French government of Léon Blum and the British government of Neville Chamberlain adopted a policy of non-intervention, ostensibly to prevent any escalation, but also motivated by their fear of revolutionary sentiments spreading outside of Spain. While the Nationalists were supported militarily from the Nazis and fascists, the Republicans found themselves economically and diplomatically isolated, forcing them to purchase military equipment from the Soviet Union. In order to combat the rise of fascism and defend the social revolution, thousands of volunteers came to Spain and joined the Republican militias.

=== Biographical context ===

George Orwell was born in 1903, in the Indian city of Motihari, which was at the time under the rule of the British Raj. He was raised by his mother in England and returned to Asia at the age of 19, in order to join the Imperial Police in Burma. There he was exposed first-hand to the material realities of imperialism, which became the subject of his first novel &quot;Burmese Days&quot;, published in 1934. Upon his return to Europe, he spent years living in poverty in the cities of London and Paris, an experience which formed the basis for his first full-length work &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot;. By the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Orwell was already a committed anti-capitalist.

Throughout the 1930s, Orwell had become concerned about the rise of fascism in Europe and wanted to take action to oppose it. Although he did not speak or write about Spain during the first months of the conflict, so his thought process on the matter is not known, by the autumn of 1936, he had decided to go to Spain. In order to obtain a passport that would permit his entry into Spain, he initially went to the headquarters of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in London&#x27;s King Street. When the party&#x27;s leader, Harry Pollitt, asked if he would join the International Brigades, Orwell replied that he wanted to see for himself what was happening first. After Pollitt refused to help, Orwell contacted the Independent Labour Party (ILP). They accredited Orwell as a correspondent for their weekly paper, the &quot;New Leader&quot;, which provided Orwell the means to go legitimately to Spain. Orwell received a letter of recommendation from the ILP&#x27;s general secretary Fenner Brockway, who put him in touch with John McNair, the ILP&#x27;s representative in Barcelona and an affiliate of the POUM, a Catalan party of the anti-Stalinist left. 

After putting the finishing touches on his book &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;, he departed for Spain on 23 December 1936. He briefly stopped in Paris, where he met up with his friend Henry Miller, before he continued his journey south by train, finally crossing over the France–Spain border and arriving in Barcelona by the end of the year.

Upon arriving in Spain, Orwell is reported to have told McNair that he had come to Spain to join the militia to fight against Fascism. While McNair also describes Orwell as expressing a desire to write &quot;some articles&quot; for the &quot;New Statesman and Nation&quot; with an intention &quot;to stir working-class opinion in Britain and France&quot;, when presented the opportunity to write, Orwell told him writing &quot;was quite secondary and his main reason for coming was to fight against Fascism.&quot; McNair took Orwell to the POUM (Catalan: &quot;Partit Obrer d&#x27;Unificació Marxista;&quot; English: Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification), an anti-Stalinist communist party.

By Orwell&#x27;s own admission, it was somewhat by chance that he joined the POUM: &quot;I knew that I was serving in something called the POUM. (I had only joined the POUM militia rather than any other because I happened to arrive in Barcelona with ILP papers), but I did not realize that there were serious differences between the political parties.&quot; He later notes, &quot;As far as my purely personal preferences went I would have liked to join the Anarchists.&quot; He also nearly joined Communist International&#x27;s International Column midway through his tour because he thought they were likeliest to send him to Madrid, where he wanted to join the action.

==Chapter summaries==
The appendices in this summary correspond to chapters 5 and 11 in editions that do not include appendices. Orwell felt these chapters, as journalistic accounts of the political situation in Spain, were out of place in the midst of the narrative and should be moved so that readers could ignore them if they wished.

===Chapter one===
Orwell describes the atmosphere of Barcelona in December 1936. &quot;The anarchists were still in virtual control of Catalonia and the revolution was still in full swing ... It was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle ... every wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle ... every shop and café had an inscription saying that it had been collectivized.&quot; Further to this, &quot;The Anarchists&quot; (referring to the Spanish CNT and FAI) were &quot;in control&quot;, tipping was prohibited by workers themselves, and servile forms of speech, such as &quot;&quot;Señor&quot; or &quot;Don&quot;&quot;, were abandoned. At the Lenin Barracks (formerly the Lepanto Barracks), militiamen were given instruction in the form of &quot;parade-ground drill of the most antiquated, stupid kind; right turn, left turn, about turn, marching at attention in column of threes and all the rest of that useless nonsense, which I had learned when I was fifteen years old&quot;.

He describes the deficiencies of the POUM workers&#x27; militia, the absence of weapons, the recruits mostly boys of sixteen or seventeen ignorant of the meaning of war, half-complains about the sometimes frustrating tendency of Spaniards to put things off until &quot;mañana&quot; (tomorrow), notes his struggles with Spanish (or more usually, the local use of Catalan). He praises the generosity of the Catalan working class. Orwell leads to the next chapter by describing the &quot;conquering-hero stuff&quot;—parades through the streets and cheering crowds—that the militiamen experienced at the time he was sent to the Aragón front.

===Chapter two===
In January 1937, Orwell&#x27;s centuria arrives in Alcubierre, just behind the line fronting Zaragoza. He sketches the squalor of the region&#x27;s villages and the &quot;Fascist deserters&quot; indistinguishable from themselves. On the third day rifles are handed out. Orwell&#x27;s &quot;was a German Mauser dated 1896 ... it was corroded and past praying for.&quot; The chapter ends on his centuria&#x27;s arrival at trenches near Zaragoza and the first time a bullet nearly hit him. To his dismay, instinct made him duck.

===Chapter three===
In the hills around Zaragoza, Orwell experiences the &quot;mingled boredom and discomfort of stationary warfare,&quot; the mundaneness of a situation in which &quot;each army had dug itself in and settled down on the hill-tops it had won.&quot; He praises the Spanish militias for their relative social equality, for their holding of the front while the army was trained in the rear, and for the &quot;democratic &#x27;revolutionary&#x27; type of discipline ... more reliable than might be expected.&quot; &quot;&#x27;Revolutionary&#x27; discipline depends on political consciousness—on an understanding of &quot;why&quot; orders must be obeyed; it takes time to diffuse this, but it also takes time to drill a man into an automaton on the barrack-square&quot;.

Throughout the chapter Orwell describes the various shortages and problems at the front—firewood (&quot;We were between two and three thousand feet above sea-level, it was mid winter and the cold was unspeakable&quot;), food, candles, tobacco, and adequate munitions—as well as the danger of accidents inherent in a badly trained and poorly armed group of soldiers.

===Chapter four===
After some three weeks at the front, Orwell and the other English militiaman in his unit, Williams, join a contingent of fellow Englishmen sent out by the Independent Labour Party to a position at Monte Oscuro, within sight of Zaragoza. &quot;Perhaps the best of the bunch was Bob Smillie—the grandson of the famous miners&#x27; leader—who afterwards died such an evil and meaningless death in Valencia&quot;. In this new position he witnesses the sometimes propagandistic shouting between the Rebel and Loyalist trenches and hears of the fall of Málaga. &quot;... every man in the militia believed that the loss of Malaga was due to treachery. It was the first talk I had heard of treachery or divided aims. It set up in my mind the first vague doubts about this war in which, hitherto, the rights and wrongs had seemed so beautifully simple.&quot; In February, he is sent with the other POUM militiamen 50 miles to make a part of the army besieging Huesca; he mentions the running joke phrase, &quot;Tomorrow we&#x27;ll have coffee in Huesca,&quot; attributed to a general commanding the Government troops who, months earlier, made one of many failed assaults on the town.
=== Chapter five (orig. ch. 6) ===
Orwell complains that on the eastern side of Huesca, where he was stationed, nothing ever seemed to happen—except the onslaught of spring, and, with it, lice. He was in a (&quot;so-called&quot;) hospital at Monflorite for ten days at the end of March 1937 with a poisoned hand that had to be lanced and put in a sling. He describes rats that &quot;really were as big as cats, or nearly&quot; (in Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, the protagonist Winston Smith has a phobia of rats that Orwell himself shared to a lesser degree). He makes reference to the lack of &quot;religious feeling, in the orthodox sense,&quot; and that the Catholic Church was, &quot;to the Spanish people, at any rate in Catalonia and Aragon, a racket, pure and simple. And possibly Christian belief was replaced to some extent by Anarchism&quot;. The latter portion of the chapter briefly details various operations in which Orwell took part: silently advancing the Loyalist frontline by night, for example.

=== Chapter six (orig. ch. 7) ===
Orwell takes part in a &quot;holding attack&quot; on Huesca, designed to draw the Nationalist troops away from an Anarchist attack on &quot;the Jaca road.&quot; He suspects two of the bombs he threw may have killed their targets, but he cannot be sure. They capture the position and pull back with captured rifles and ammunition, but Orwell laments that they fled too hurriedly to bring back a telescope they had discovered, which Orwell sees as more useful than any weapons.

=== Chapter seven (orig. ch. 8) ===
Orwell shares memories of the 115 days he spent on the war front, and its influence on his political ideas, &quot;... the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism ... the ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England ... the effect was to make my desire to see Socialism established much more actual than it had been before.&quot; By the time he left Spain, he had become a &quot;convinced democratic Socialist.&quot; The chapter ends with Orwell&#x27;s arrival in Barcelona on the afternoon of 26 April 1937. &quot;And after that the trouble began.&quot;

=== Chapter eight (orig. ch. 9) ===

Orwell details noteworthy changes in the social and political atmosphere of Barcelona when he returns after three months at the front. He describes a lack of revolutionary atmosphere and the class division that he had thought would not reappear, i.e., with visible division between rich and poor and the return of servile language. Orwell had been determined to leave the POUM, and confesses here that he &quot;would have liked to join the Anarchists,&quot; but instead sought a recommendation to join the International Column, so that he could go to the Madrid front. The latter half of this chapter is devoted to describing the conflict between the anarchist CNT and the socialist Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) and the resulting cancellation of the May Day demonstration and the build-up to the street fighting of the &quot;Barcelona May Days&quot;. &quot;It was the antagonism between those who wished the revolution to go forward and those who wished to check or prevent it—ultimately, between Anarchists and Communists.&quot;

=== Chapter nine (orig. ch. 10) ===
Orwell relates his involvement in the &quot;May Days&quot;&#x27; Barcelona street fighting that began on 3 May when the Government Assault Guards tried to take the Telephone Exchange from the CNT workers who controlled it. For his part, Orwell acted as part of the POUM, guarding a POUM-controlled building. Although he realises that he is fighting on the side of the working class, Orwell describes his dismay at coming back to Barcelona on leave from the front only to get mixed up in street fighting. Assault Guards from Valencia arrive—&quot;All of them were armed with brand-new rifles ... vastly better than the dreadful old blunderbusses we had at the front.&quot; The Communist-controlled Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia newspapers declare POUM to be a disguised Fascist organisation—&quot;No one who was in Barcelona then, or for months later, will forget the horrible atmosphere produced by fear, suspicion, hatred, censored newspapers, crammed jails, enormous food queues, and prowling gangs of armed men.&quot; In his second appendix to the book, Orwell discusses the political issues at stake in the May 1937 Barcelona fighting, as he saw them at the time and later on, looking back.

=== Chapter ten (orig. ch. 12) ===
Orwell speculates on how the Spanish Civil War might turn out. Orwell predicts that the &quot;tendency of the post-war Government ... is bound to be Fascistic.&quot;

He returns to the front, where he is shot through the throat by a sniper, an injury that takes him out of the war. After spending some time in a hospital in Lleida, he was moved to Tarragona where his wound was finally examined more than a week after he&#x27;d left the front.

=== Chapter eleven (orig. ch. 13) ===
Orwell tells us of his various movements between hospitals in Siétamo, Barbastro, and Monzón while getting his discharge papers stamped, after being declared medically unfit. He returns to Barcelona only to find out from his wife that the POUM had been &quot;suppressed&quot;: it had been declared illegal the very day he had left to obtain discharge papers and POUM members were being arrested without charge. &quot;The attack on Huesca was beginning ... there must have been numbers of men who were killed without ever learning that the newspapers in the rear were calling them Fascists. This kind of thing is a little difficult to forgive.&quot; While his wife went back to the hotel, he sleeps that night in the ruins of a church; he cannot go back to his hotel because of the danger of arrest.
===Chapter twelve (orig. ch. 14)===
This chapter describes his visits accompanied by his wife to Georges Kopp, unit commander of the ILP Contingent while Kopp was held in a Spanish makeshift jail—&quot;really the ground floor of a shop.&quot; Having done all he could to free Kopp, ineffectively and at great personal risk, Orwell decides to leave Spain. Crossing the Pyrenees frontier, he and his wife arrived in France &quot;without incident&quot;.

===Appendix one (orig. ch. 5)===
Orwell explains the divisions within the Republican side: &quot;On the one side the CNT-FAI, the POUM, and a section of the Socialists, standing for workers&#x27; control: on the other side the Right-wing Socialists, Liberals, and Communists, standing for centralized government and a militarized army.&quot; He also writes: &quot;One of the dreariest effects of this war has been to teach me that the Left-wing press is every bit as spurious and dishonest as that of the Right.&quot;

=== Appendix two (orig. ch. 11) ===
An attempt to dispel some of the myths in the foreign press at the time (mostly the pro-Communist press) about the &quot;May Days&quot;, the street fighting that took place in revolutionary Catalonia in early May 1937. This was between anarchists and POUM members, against Communist/government forces which sparked off when local police forces occupied the Telephone Exchange, which had until then been under the control of CNT workers. He relates the suppression of the POUM on 15–16 June 1937, gives examples of the Communist Press of the world—(&quot;Daily Worker&quot;, 21 June, &quot;Spanish Trotskyists Plot With Franco&quot;), indicates that Indalecio Prieto hinted, &quot;fairly broadly to the delegation that the government could not afford to offend the Communist Party while the Russians were supplying arms.&quot; He quotes Julián Zugazagoitia, the Minister of the Interior; &quot;We have received aid from Russia and have had to permit certain actions which we did not like.&quot;

===Writing===
Orwell wrote diaries, made press-cuttings, and took photographs during his time in Spain, but they were all stolen before he left. In May 1937, he wrote the publisher of his previous books saying, &quot;I greatly hope I come out of this alive if only to write a book about it.&quot; According to his eventual publisher, &quot;&quot;Homage&quot; was begun in February [1937] in the trenches, written on scraps, the backs of envelopes, toilet paper. The written material was sent to Barcelona to McNair&#x27;s office, where his wife Eileen Blair, working as a volunteer, typed it out section by section. Slowly it grew into a sizable parcel. McNair kept it in his own room.&quot;

Upon escaping across the French border in June 1937, he stopped at the first post office available to telegram the &quot;National Statesman&quot;, asking if it would like a first-hand article. The offer was accepted but the article, &quot;Eyewitness in Barcelona&quot;, was rejected by editor Kingsley Martin on grounds that his writing &quot;could cause trouble&quot; (it was picked up by &quot;Controversy&quot;). In the months after leaving Spain, Orwell wrote a number of essays on the war, notably &quot;Spilling the Spanish Beans&quot; and a praiseful review of Franz Borkenau&#x27;s &quot;The Spanish Cockpit&quot;.

Writing from his cottage at Wallington, Hertfordshire, he finished around New Year&#x27;s Day 1938.

===First edition===
After Orwell had returned to England in 1937, his pitch for the memoir was quickly turned down by his own publisher Victor Gollancz, who worried that its publication might harm the cause of anti-fascism. Orwell concluded that Gollancz was &quot;part of the Communism-racket&quot; and sought out a different publisher; he was recommended by ILP secretary Fenner Brockway to Frederic Warburg, a publisher associated with the anti-Stalinist left, who agreed to a contract with Orwell. In September, a deal was signed for an advance of £150 (). By January 1938, Orwell had completed the book and, on 25 April 1938, Secker &amp; Warburg published it under the title &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;. Orwell remarked to Jack Common that they hadn&#x27;t been able to think of a better title.

The book was initially commercially unsuccessful, selling only 683 copies (out of 1,500) in its first 6 months, with many copies of its initial print run remaining unsold at the time of Orwell&#x27;s death in 1950. Orwell himself had wondered if the book had been boycotted by the British press, while publisher Fredric Warburg himself believed that the book had been &quot;ignored and hectored into failure&quot;. &quot;Ten years ago it was almost impossible to get anything printed in favour of Communism; today it is almost impossible to get anything printed in favour of Anarchism or &#x27;Trotskyism&#x27;,&quot; Orwell wrote bitterly in 1938.

===Later editions===
Following the success of Orwell&#x27;s later books, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, it was posthumously recognised as a &quot;lost classic&quot; of the now-famous author. The book received a second wave of sales after the first American edition was published by Harcourt Brace, in 1952, with an introduction from literary critic Lionel Trilling. In Britain, Secker &amp; Warburg published a new edition of the book in 1951; publication was taken over by Penguin Books in 1962 and it has never fallen out of print since then. The book received a third wave of sales during the late 1960s, buoyed by interest from the period&#x27;s counterculture and the New Left. Historian Paul Preston speculated in 2017 that &quot;Homage&quot; had become the highest selling and most read book about the civil war.

These later editions incorporated revisions requested by Orwell himself, in order to correct some mistakes he had made in the first edition and to rearrange the chapter sequence so the &quot;general information&quot; about political context was moved to an appendices. In 1986, Peter Davison published an edition with a few footnotes based on Orwell&#x27;s own footnotes found among his papers after he died.

===Translations===
The only translation published in Orwell&#x27;s lifetime was into Italian, in December 1948. A French translation by Yvonne Davet—with whom Orwell corresponded, commenting on her translation and providing explanatory notes—in 1938–39, was not published until 1955, five years after Orwell&#x27;s death.

Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Homage&quot; finally received publication in Spain during the early 1970s, although much its content was suppressed and distorted by the Francoist censors. It received a second Spanish edition in 1978, after the approval of the Spanish Constitution, but it wasn&#x27;t until 2007 that an uncensored, comprehensive edition of the book was published in Spain.

==Reception==
===Contemporary reviews (1930s–1940s)===
Initial reception of &quot;Homage&quot; were mixed and few in number, with reviews being divided between supporters and opponents of Orwell&#x27;s analysis of the conflict. 

Many positive reviews of the book came from Orwell&#x27;s friends and political allies, such as Geoffrey Gorer and John McNair respectively. Veterans of World War I, such as Herbert Read and Gerald Brenan, praised the book for its vivid depiction of life on the frontlines of a war. Read commented that, except for a lack of artillery bombardment, Orwell&#x27;s &quot;physical miseries&quot; in Aragon seemed worse than his own in Ypres; while Brenan related to his descriptions of war&#x27;s &quot;immense boredom and its immense charm, the sense of being a human being again among other human beings.&quot; Irene Rathbone likewise wrote that he had captured the feelings of the men that fought in the World War, commenting that he was &quot;in essence&quot; a part of that same generation. Other positive reviews came from staunch anti-communists in Conservative and Catholic circles, who had opposed the Spanish Republic from the outset. A review for the conservative magazine &quot;The Spectator&quot; concluded that the &quot;dismal record of intrigue, injustice, incompetence, quarrelling, lying communist propaganda, police spying, illegal imprisonment, filth and disorder&quot; was evidence that the Spanish Republic had deserved to fall. The book also received a positive review from Austrian journalist Franz Borkenau, who wrote that &quot;Homage&quot; and his own book &quot;The Spanish Cockpit&quot; formed a complete picture of the Spanish Revolution of 1936.

A mixed review for &quot;The Listener&quot; described the book as a &quot;muddle-headed and inaccurate&quot; account of the war and criticised it for its positive depiction of the POUM, while also praising Orwell&#x27;s vivid description of &quot;the horror and filth, the futility and comedy, and even the beauty of war.&quot; Another mixed review was supplied by V. S. Pritchett who called Orwell naïve about Spain but added that &quot;no one excels him in bringing to the eyes, ears and nostrils the nasty ingredients of fevered situations; and I would recommend him warmly to all who are concerned about the realities of personal experience in a muddled cause&quot;.

In a negative review for the Communist Party of Great Britain&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Daily Worker&quot;, John Langdon-Davies wrote that &quot;the value of the book is that it gives an honest picture of the sort of mentality that toys with revolutionary romanticism but shies violently at revolutionary discipline. It should be read as a warning.&quot; Anti-fascist poet Nancy Cunard later wrote that the book was riddled with &quot;perfidious inaccuracies&quot; and came away from it thinking Orwell was a Trotskyist, wondering &quot;what kind of damage he has been doing, or trying to do, in Spain&quot;. Other negative reviews were published in &quot;The Tablet&quot; and &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;.

British historian Tom Buchanan believed that, at the time of its initial publication, Orwell had &quot;delivered a message that was too unwelcome, and at too late a stage in the war, to stimulate the kind of debate that he may have wished to initiate.&quot; Most of the British left believed that the Spanish Civil War had been a simple conflict between democracy and fascism, ignoring the role of revolutionaries on the Republican side, which Orwell himself believed had made them complacent regarding the situation. In late 1937, when Nancy Cunard began soliciting opinions from British authors on which side of the conflict they supported, Orwell responded that he refused to write about &quot;defending democracy&quot;, retorting that the Spanish Republican government had forced fascism onto Spanish workers &quot;under the pretext of resisting Fascism&quot;. Kingsley Martin subsequently refused to publish any of Orwell&#x27;s &quot;anti-government propaganda&quot; in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, which led Orwell himself to conclude that he was a victim of censorship.

===Anti-communist reevaluation (1950s)===
The success of Orwell&#x27;s novels, and his death in 1950, brought &quot;Homage&quot; back into the limelight as people began to reassess the effect that his experiences in Spain had on his work. The release of several memoirs by Spanish ex-communists also triggered a reevaluation of the prescience of Orwell&#x27;s criticisms of Communism, with Valentín González commenting that his writings had been &quot;confirmed&quot;. In an obituary on Orwell, British literary critic V. S. Pritchett commented that &quot;Don Quixote saw the poker face of Communism&quot;. In June 1950, the anti-communist writer Stephen Spender praised &quot;Homage&quot; as &quot;one of the most serious indictments of Communism which has been written&quot;, remarking that the book demonstrated that all ideologies were capable of terrible things, if they aren&#x27;t taken together with &quot;a scrupulous regard for the sacredness of the truth of an individual life.&quot; He commented that: &quot;politically, the liquidation of the POUM was not an event of great importance; humanly speaking, it was a greater failure for the Republic even than the defeat.&quot; Spender even argued that &quot;Homage&quot; was a better book than &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, as it depicted &quot;real horrors and real betrayals&quot;.

Upon the publication of the book&#x27;s first American edition in 1952, American literary critic Lionel Trilling exalted Orwell as a &quot;secular saint&quot;, who was wholly committed to truth and journalistic objectivity. Historian John Rodden argued that Trilling&#x27;s introduction to &quot;Homage&quot; was instrumental in bringing the book to prominence, as the American intelligentsia of the period had been in search of a &quot;moral and political condemnation&quot; of Spanish communism. American reviews re-conceived the book as a key piece of context for understanding Orwell&#x27;s later work, presenting it as about &quot;the making of an anti-totalitarian&quot;. Some understood it as a demonstration of communist tactics for seizing power, placing it within the post-WWII context of the formation of the Eastern Bloc and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. American journalist Herbert Matthews was sharply critical of the book&#x27;s re-contextualisation by Americans during the Cold War, arguing that its importance as an account of the Spanish Civil War had been eclipsed by its status as an anti-communist exposé.

===Socialist reevaluation and communist backlash (1960s–1970s)===
Another reevaluation of &quot;Homage&quot; came during the 1960s, as the emerging counterculture and the New Left brought a new generation of readers to pick up the book. The anti-communist tendencies of the 1950s, which had buried Orwell&#x27;s positive depiction of revolutionary socialism, were partly reversed and Orwell was again reconceived as a predecessor of Che Guevara. In 1971, the Welsh socialist scholar Raymond Williams commented that &quot;Homage&quot; had been reevaluated, in the context of the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Protests of 1968, as taking a position in favour of revolutionary socialism and opposed to both capitalism and Marxism-Leninism. This position was exemplified in Noam Chomsky&#x27;s book &quot;American Power and the New Mandarins&quot;, in which the author used &quot;Homage&quot; to directly compare the Spanish revolution with Vietnamese resistance to US intervention, arguing that neither complied with the &quot;liberal dogma&quot; of the American intelligentsia. He speculated that the book&#x27;s status as a symbol of 1950s anti-communism would have been &quot;of little comfort to the author&quot;. Raymond Carr praised Orwell in 1971 for being &quot;determined to set down the truth as he saw it.&quot; In his 1971 memoir, Herbert Matthews of &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared, &quot;The book did more to blacken the Loyalist cause than any work written by enemies of the Second Republic.&quot; 

The revival in the book&#x27;s popularity also triggered indignation from figures in the CPGB, which had never forgiven Orwell for it. In 1967, the historian Frank Jellinek expressed regret that the book had been exploited by anti-communists such as James Burnham and that it had brought the suppression of the POUM, which he called a &quot;fairly minor piece of wartime expediency&quot;, to a prominent place within historiography of the civil war. In the late 1970s, British communist veterans of the war, such as Thomas Murray and Frank Graham, denounced the book respectively as a &quot;weapon&quot; of the anti-Stalinist left and as a slander against the International Brigades. In 1984, CPGB politician and former commander of the International Brigades, Bill Alexander, accused Orwell of lacking anti-fascist sentiments and called the book an &quot;establishment&quot; denigration of the &quot;real issues&quot; of anti-fascism. That same year, Lawrence and Wishart published &quot;Inside the Myth&quot;, a collection of essays from authors hostile to Orwell, which John Newsinger described as &quot;an obvious attempt to do as much damage to his reputation as possible&quot;. To Tom Buchanan, the sustained Communist campaign against &quot;Homage&quot; had been &quot;so wrongheaded and ill-informed that it has probably, if anything, bolstered Orwell&#x27;s reputation.&quot; He concluded that the legacy of the book, which cemented the repression of the POUM in popular historiography and damaged the reputation of the Communist Party, revealed the potential that single books can have to leave their mark on history.

Nevertheless, the revolutionary conception of &quot;Homage&quot; continued through the subsequent decades, with British film-maker Ken Loach notably adapting the book into his 1995 film &quot;Land and Freedom&quot;. Tom Buchanan comments that the film may not have been received as well if previous generations hadn&#x27;t been primed to view the Spanish Civil War through the lens of &quot;the Revolution betrayed&quot;. Buchanan was critical of the far-left&#x27;s adoption of the book, pointing out that Orwell had never fully agreed with the POUM&#x27;s politics and that his view of revolutionary Spain &quot;ignit[ing] the passions of workers around the world&quot; had been naïve, given the prevalence of dictatorship at the time. He also commented that Orwell&#x27;s revolutionary politics had been &quot;unconvincing&quot; and only a brief phase of his political development, which evolved and changed following his publication of &quot;Homage&quot;, as evidenced by his more moderate reflection in his 1942 essay &quot;Looking Back on the Spanish War&quot;.

===Historiographical evaluation (1970s–present)===
When histories of the civil war first started to be published, historians generally disregarded &quot;Homage&quot; as a primary source. In his 1962 book &quot;The Spanish Civil War&quot;, English historian Hugh Thomas wrote that, while he thought &quot;Homage&quot; was a well-written memoir that was &quot;perceptive about war&quot;, he also considered it to be misleading about the events of the war. He thought that Orwell had misjudged the war by believing that revolutionary idealism alone was capable of achieving victory; Thomas himself believed that the only way that the Republic could have won the war was through a process of centralisation and militarisation, backed by the Soviet Union. Tom Buchanan himself disputed Thomas&#x27; assessment that &quot;Homage&quot; was &quot;misleading&quot; on the war, so long as it wasn&#x27;t considered a description of the conflict as a whole. Paul Preston likewise cautioned against taking the book as an &quot;overview of the civil war, which it is not&quot;. In contrast, &quot;Homage&quot; has also contributed to a historiographical trend that centred the internal conflict within the Republican faction, exemplified by the work of Burnett Bolloten.

A revival of interest in the Spanish Civil War was later ignited by the Spanish transition to democracy in the 1970s, as a new generation of historians began studying the conflict and Orwell&#x27;s own account of it, which received increasing amounts of scrutiny over his interpretation of the events. Gabriel Jackson wrote that Orwell had understood the civil war only as an analogue to the situation in Europe and lacked an understanding of the local political context in Spain. Michael Seidman argued that Orwell&#x27;s depiction of the &quot;working-class paradise&quot; in Barcelona was questionable, as he had only been accounting for the convinced militants and not the &quot;indifference&quot; of many individual workers. Helen Graham pointed out how the internecine conflicts witnessed by Orwell had predated the civil war and Soviet intervention in the conflict, arguing against the &quot;Cold War parable of an alien Stalinism which &#x27;injected&#x27; conflict into Spanish Republican politics&quot;, although her analysis of the consequences of the May Days ultimately aligned with Orwell&#x27;s. 

In his own analysis of the book&#x27;s effect on historiography, Tom Buchanan found that research on the conflict had not entirely disqualified &quot;Homage&quot;, but had instead emphasised it as a &quot;snapshot of a complex political situation&quot; taken by an outsider. Although Orwell himself warned readers to be aware of his own biases, mistakes and distortions, even engaging in self-deprecation over his own lack of knowledge of Spanish history and culture, Buchanan worried that people whose only insight into the conflict was Orwell&#x27;s book would &quot;receive a very unbalanced picture of the conflict as a whole.&quot; Buchanan concluded that the &quot;very real danger&quot; presented by the book was that it had been recontextualised, from an individual&#x27;s personal account, into a book that was seen as representative of the civil war as a whole.

==Aftermath==
Within weeks of leaving Spain, a deposition (discovered in 1989) was presented to the Tribunal for Espionage &amp; High Treason, Valencia, charging the Orwells with &#x27;rabid Trotskyism&#x27; and being agents of the POUM. The trial of the leaders of the POUM and of Orwell (in his absence) took place in Barcelona, in October and November 1938. Observing events from French Morocco, Orwell wrote that they were &quot;only a by-product of the Russian Trotskyist trials and from the start every kind of lie, including flagrant absurdities, has been circulated in the Communist press.&quot;

Georges Kopp, deemed &quot;quite likely&quot; shot in the book&#x27;s final chapter, was released in December 1938.

Barcelona fell to Franco&#x27;s forces on 26 January 1939, and on 1 April 1939, the last of the Republican forces surrendered.

=== Effect on Orwell ===

==== Health ====
Orwell never knew the source of his tuberculosis, from complications of which he died in 1950. However, in 2018, researchers studying bacteria on his letters announced that there was a &quot;very high probability&quot; that Orwell contracted the disease in a Spanish hospital.

==== Politics ====
Orwell reflected that he &quot;had &quot;felt&quot; what socialism could be like&quot; and, according to biographer Gordon Bowker, &quot;Orwell never did abandon his socialism: if anything, his Spanish experience strengthened it.&quot; In a letter to Cyril Connolly, written on 8 June 1937, Orwell said, &quot;At last [I] really believe in Socialism, which I never did before&quot;. A decade later he wrote: &quot;Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, &quot;against&quot; totalitarianism and &quot;for&quot; democratic Socialism, as I understand it.&quot;

Orwell&#x27;s experiences, culminating in his and his wife Eileen O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s narrow escape from the communist purges in Barcelona in June 1937, greatly increased his sympathy for the POUM and, while not affecting his moral and political commitment to socialism, made him a lifelong anti-Stalinist.

After reviewing Koestler&#x27;s bestselling &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;, Orwell decided that fiction was the best way to describe totalitarianism. He soon wrote &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, &quot;his scintillating 1944 satire on Stalinism&quot;.

=== Works inspired by the book ===
Orwell himself went on to write a poem about the Italian militiaman he described in the book&#x27;s opening pages. The poem was included in Orwell&#x27;s 1942 essay &quot;Looking Back on the Spanish War&quot;, published in &quot;New Road&quot; in 1943. The closing phrase of the poem, &quot;No bomb that ever burst shatters the crystal spirit&quot;, was later taken by George Woodcock for the title of his Governor General&#x27;s Award-winning critical study of Orwell and his work, &quot;The Crystal Spirit&quot; (1966).

In 1995 Ken Loach released the film &quot;Land and Freedom&quot;, heavily inspired by &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;.

&quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot; influenced Rebecca Solnit&#x27;s second book, &quot;Savage Dreams&quot;.

<text>Lake County is a county located in the north central portion of the U.S. state of California. As of the 2020 census, the population was 68,163. The county seat is Lakeport. The county takes its name from Clear Lake, the dominant geographic feature in the county and the largest non-extinct natural lake wholly within California. (Lake Tahoe is partially in Nevada; the Salton Sea was formed by flooding; Tulare Lake was drained by the agricultural industry.)

Lake County forms the Clearlake, California micropolitan statistical area. It is directly north of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Lake County is part of California&#x27;s Wine Country, which also includes Napa, Sonoma, and Mendocino counties. It includes nine American Viticultural Areas and around 20 bonded wineries.

==History==
Lake County has been inhabited by Pomo Native Americans for over ten thousand years. Pomos had been fishermen and hunters, known especially for their intricate basketry made from lakeshore tules and other native plants and feathers. Pomo people continue to live in Lake County.

The area had European American settlers since at least the 1840s. Lake County was created in 1861 from parts of Napa and Mendocino counties. The eastern boundary of Lake County, which was not clearly specified in the 1861 act, was clarified by legislative acts passed in 1864 and 1868. A major effect of the 1868 act was to include in Lake County the entire watershed of North Fork Cache Creek, which had previously been claimed by Colusa County.

The 1911 &quot;California Blue Book&quot; lists the major crops as Bartlett pears and beans. Other crops include grain, alfalfa, hay, prunes, peaches, apples, grapes and walnuts. Stockraising included goats, hogs, turkeys and dairying.

Some vineyards were planted in the 1870s by European Americans, but the first in the state were established in the 18th century by Spanish missionaries. By the early 20th century, the area was earning a reputation for producing some of the world&#x27;s greatest wines. However, in 1920, national prohibition essentially ended Lake County&#x27;s wine production. With authorized cultivation limited to sacramental purposes, most of the vineyards were ripped out and replanted with walnut and pear orchards.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and , or 5.5%, is water. Two main watercourses drain the county: Cache Creek, which is the outlet of Clear Lake; and Putah Creek. Both of these flow to the Sacramento River. The main streams which flow into Clear Lake are Forbes Creek, Scotts Creek, Middle Creek, and Kelsey Creek. At the extreme north of the county Lake Pillsbury and the Van Arsdale Reservoir dam the Eel River, providing water and power to Ukiah in Mendocino County.

Clear Lake is believed to be the oldest warmwater lake in North America, due to a geological fluke. The lake sits on a huge block of stone which slowly tilts in the northern direction at the same rate as the lake fills in with sediment, thus keeping the water at roughly the same depth. The geology of the county is chaotic, being based on Franciscan Assemblage hills. Numerous small faults are present in the south end of the lake as well as many old volcanoes, the largest being Cobb Mountain. The geologic history of the county shows events of great violence, such as the eruption of Mount Konocti and Mount St. Helena and the collapse of Cow Mountain, which created the hills around the county seat of Lakeport. Blue Lakes, Lake Pillsbury, and Indian Valley Reservoir are the county&#x27;s other major bodies of water.

Lake County has habitats for a variety of species of concern including the uncommon herb, &quot;Legenere limosa&quot;, the rare &quot;Eryngium constancei,&quot; and the tule elk. Waterfowl, bear, and other wildlife abound in the Clear Lake basin.

Due to its surrounding hilly terrain, Lake County is the only one of California&#x27;s 58 counties never to have been served by a railroad line.

===Mineral springs===
In the late 19th century, the worldwide popularity of mineral water for the relief of myriad physical ailments resulted in the development of mineral resorts around Clear Lake.
* Greene Bartlett discovered Bartlett hot springs in 1870. The springs were developed into a resort and by 1900 included a mineral water bottling plant. The resort burned down in 1934.
* Harbin Hot Springs was developed by settlers in the 1860s and burned to the ground in the Valley Fire of 2015. The resort partially reopened in January 2019, including the main pools and sauna, and a limited cafeteria service.
* Highland Springs opened in 1891 and was destroyed by fire in 1945. During its time, Highland had an elegant dining room and a spacious hotel.
* Saratoga Springs Resort was opened by J. J. Liebert in 1873 with several cabins, and within two decades had room for 350 guests.
* Witter Springs Resort opened in 1873 with a hotel and guest cottages.

==Climate==
Lake County has a Mediterranean climate with hot summer daytime temperatures in its lower elevations. Nighttime temperatures remain cool year-round, somewhat moderating average temperatures and relieving the summer heat.

===Air quality===
Lake County has been ranked by the American Lung Association as having the cleanest air in the nation, including in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Lake County has also been ranked 24 times as having the cleanest air in California. Currently, the American Lung Association&#x27;s website gives Lake County air a &quot;C&quot; grade for high ozone days and an &quot;A&quot; grade for particle pollution.

==Politics==
=== Overview ===
In its early history, Lake County leaned Democratic in Presidential and congressional elections. It supported every Democratic presidential candidate between 1864 and 1916 except Alton B. Parker in his 1904 landslide defeat. Nonetheless, between 1920 and 1984 Lake County tended towards leaning Republican and was won by just four Democratic nominees – Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 and 1936, Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and Jimmy Carter in 1976. Ronald Reagan in 1984 won a majority in the county, which later reverted to leaning Democratic. In 2016, Republicans broke 40% of the vote for the first time since 2004, and Democrats failed to win 50% of the vote for the first time since 1996. Democrats broke 50% again in 2020, increasing their margin of victory, although Republicans still increased their percentage of the vote. In 2022, the county was won by Republicans in several statewide races. Donald Trump won Lake County by 367 votes as of December 3 results, marking the first time since Reagan&#x27;s 1984 run that a Republican candidate won the presidential race in Lake County.

On November 4, 2008, Lake County voted 52.6% for Proposition 8, which amended the California Constitution to ban same-sex marriages. In November 2024, Proposition 3, titled Constitutional Right to Marry, which effectively repealed Proposition 8, received 57.04% of &quot;Yes&quot; votes in the county.












Lake County is in California&#x27;s 4th congressional district, represented by .

CAL FIRE determined 8 wildfires in their jurisdiction in Lake County were caused by arson in 2023.

==Economy==
The county&#x27;s largest employers are the healthcare industry, Native American casinos, grocery stores, school districts, and electricity company Calpine, which operates in the Geysers geothermal field in the Mayacamas Mountains.

The only significant manufacturing operations in Lake County are Stokes Ladders in Kelseyville, which builds orchard and industrial ladders, and Reynolds Systems in Middletown, which specializes in detonators, igniters, precision initiating couplers, leads and boosters for the aerospace industry.

Lake County&#x27;s economy is largely driven by agriculture. The main crops in 2022 were:

===Wine Country===
The first vineyards in Lake County were planted in the late 19th century, but Prohibition and the county&#x27;s remoteness dealt a blow to the area&#x27;s viticulture. A reemergence of the wine industry began in the 1970s, although most of the region&#x27;s grapes are still trucked to neighboring Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino counties for vinification. The county saw its vineyard acreage increase from fewer than in 1965 to more than in 2023

The region is host to nine American Viticultural Areas, notably Guenoc Valley, High Valley and the Red Hills, and about 20 winery operations.

==Transportation==

===Major highways===
* State Route 20
* State Route 29
* State Route 53
* State Route 175
* State Route 281

There are also several numbered county routes in Lake County.

===Public transportation===
Lake Transit serves all areas around Clear Lake. Local routes serve Lakeport, Clearlake and Lower Lake. Connections are also provided to St. Helena (in Napa County) and Ukiah (in Mendocino County). Some routes operate on weekdays only; no service is provided on Sundays and observed public holidays.

===Airports===
Lampson Field is the county&#x27;s public airport. A airstrip is located in Gravelly Valley, north of Lake Pillsbury. There are also several private airstrips located throughout the county. The county was once host to the Paul Hoberg Airport in the Cobb area, which by the early 1980s was considered abandoned.

===Historical railroads===
In 1888 the Vaca Valley and Clear Lake Railroad reached Rumsey, but the planned line to Clear Lake was never built. The Clear Lake Railroad started work on a line from Hopland to Lakeport: &quot;In November 1911 first ground was broken for the Hopland-Clear Lake railroad to Hopland. Mrs Harriet Lee Hammond, wife of the president of the road started construction. ... There were six miles of track out of Hopland ...&quot;, but this was also abandoned.

<text>Lassen County ( ) is a county located in the northeastern portion of the U.S. state of California. As of the 2020 census, the population was 32,730. The county seat and only incorporated city is Susanville. Lassen County comprises the Susanville, California, micropolitan statistical area. A former farming, mining, and lumber area, its economy now depends on employment at one federal and two state prisons; the former in Herlong and the latter two in Susanville. In 2007, half the adults in Susanville worked in one of the facilities.

==History==
Lassen County was formed on April 1, 1864, from parts of Plumas and Shasta counties following the two-day conflict known as the Sagebrush War, also called the Roop County War, that started on February 15, 1863. Due to uncertainties over the California border, the area that is now Lassen County was part of the unofficial Nataqua Territory and Roop County, Nevada, during the late 1850s and early 1860s.

The county was named by California after Peter Lassen, along with Lassen Peak, which is in adjoining Shasta County. Lassen was one of General John C. Fremont&#x27;s guides, and a famous trapper, frontiersman, and Indian fighter. He was murdered under mysterious circumstances near the Black Rock Desert in 1859, and his murder was never solved.

By the 1880s small towns began to spring up all over Lassen County. Bieber developed at the north end of the county, in rich farm land. Gold was discovered at Hayden Hill, and the small town developed to support the miners. Hayden Hill no longer exists: when the mining stopped, the townspeople left for other communities. Madeline was formed at the north end of another rich farming valley, and along the railroad tracks heading north to Alturas, California. This community still has about 50 people living in and around the town. In the 1890s many immigrant family groups arrived in the county, primarily coming from Lincolnshire and Herefordshire, England as well as the towns of Belgrade, Novi Sad, Niš and Kragujevac in Serbia. Several &quot;Yankee&quot; settlers arrived from Waldo County, Maine and Lincoln County, Maine as well.

During World War I, the area was heavily in favor of American entry into the war, and a disproportionate amount of volunteers from Lassen County signed up to take part in the war effort. A pro-German newspaper editor from San Francisco noted that &quot;the inhabitants of Lassen County&quot; were &quot;sympathetic to Britain, hostile to Germany, and indifferent to France.&quot;

A narrow gauge railroad, the Nevada-California-Oregon Railway, ran through Lassen County from 1880 to 1927. The NCOR was the longest small gauge of the century. It was intended to connect Reno, Nevada, to the Columbia River, but only of track were laid, from Reno to Lakeview, Oregon.

In 1913, the Fernley &amp; Lassen Railroad was built and it was used to export timber from the large forests of Lassen County. As this railroad was completed, the Red River Lumber Company set up shop, building the town of Westwood, California, to support its massive logging operation. Two other lumber mills followed the Red River Lumber Co. They built their mills in the county seat of Susanville. The Lassen Lumber and Box Company and the Fruit Growers Company both operated mills in Susanville for several decades.

In 2003, Anderson-based Sierra Pacific Industries announced plans to relocate or lay off 150 workers as they closed the last lumber mill in Susanville due to the lack of large timber for the mill. Sierra Pacific chose to close the mill permanently rather than spend the several million dollars required to convert the mill from large to small timber.

Since the late 20th century, three prisons have been opened in and near Susanville: California Correctional Center (minimum security, 1963) and High Desert State Prison (California) (maximum security, 1995), both in the city; and the nearby Federal Correctional Institution, Herlong (opened 2007). In 2007, half the adults in Susanville worked in one of the three prisons. In &quot;job-starved rural America, ... residents see them [prisons] as the last and only chance for employment after work at the lumber mill or the dairy dries up.&quot;

=== Overview ===
From 1932 through 1976, Lassen was powerfully Democratic, voting for the Democratic presidential nominee in every election save 1972, when it voted for Nixon over McGovern by just 6.8%. From 1980 on, however, it has been overwhelmingly Republican in presidential and congressional elections, coinciding with the dominance of the prisons in local employment. Jimmy Carter (in 1976) remains the last Democrat to have carried the county. In 2016, 2020, and 2024, Lassen stood as Donald Trump&#x27;s best county in the state, giving him a 50% or greater margin over overwhelming statewide winners Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris.

The Lassen Municipal Utility District (LMUD) is the primary electric utility in the county, and was created in 1986 by purchasing transmission facilities from CP National (now Pacificorp) at a cost of $19 million. In 2019 it had 42 employees, and the General Manager was Doug C. Smith. It is powered in part by the Honey Lake biomass power plant, which runs on wood waste from the nearby Lassen National Forest. The Whaleback Fire caused a significant outage in 2018.

<doc id="80577" wikidata="Q192469" url="?curid=80577" title="Atreus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Atreus (, ) was a king of Mycenae in the Peloponnese, the son of Pelops and Hippodamia, and the father of Agamemnon and Menelaus. His descendants became known collectively as the Atreidae ( &quot;Atreidai&quot;).

Atreus and his twin brother Thyestes were exiled by their father for murdering their half-brother Chrysippus in their desire for the throne of Olympia. They took refuge in Mycenae, where they ascended to the throne in the absence of King Eurystheus, who was fighting the Heracleidae. Eurystheus had meant for their stewardship to be temporary, but it became permanent after his death in battle, which ended the rule of the Perseid dynasty in Mycenae.

According to most ancient sources, Atreus was the father of Pleisthenes, but in some lyric poets (Ibycus, Bacchylides) Pleisthenides (son of Pleisthenes) is used as an alternative name for Atreus himself.

==Nomenclature==
&#x27;Atreides&#x27; () is a patronymic form of Atreus which refers to one of his sons—Agamemnon or Menelaus. The plural forms, deriving from the Latin , itself from Ancient Greek &#x27;Atreidai&#x27; (), refer to both sons collectively. &#x27;Atreides&#x27; is commonly used to translate both the singular and plural form to English. The term can also be used for the more distant descendants of Atreus, also known as the &#x27;House of Atreus&#x27; or the &#x27;Atreid dynasty&#x27;. It has been suggested that the name &quot;Attarsiya&quot;, belonging to an Ahhiyawan king of 1400 BC, may be the Hittite rendition of the Greek name.

==The House of Atreus==

=== Tantalus ===
The &#x27;House of Atreus&#x27; begins with Tantalus. Tantalus, the son of Zeus and the maiden Pluto, enjoyed cordial relations with the gods until he decided to slay his son Pelops and feed him to the gods as a test of their omniscience. Most of the gods, as they sat down to dinner with Tantalus, immediately understood what had happened, and, because they knew the nature of the meat they were served, were appalled and did not partake. But Demeter, who was distracted due to the abduction by Hades of her daughter Persephone, obliviously ate Pelops&#x27;s shoulder. The gods threw Tantalus into the underworld to spend eternity standing in a pool of water beneath a fruit tree with low branches. Whenever he reaches for the fruit, the branches raise his intended meal from his grasp. Whenever he bends down to get a drink, the water recedes before he can drink. Thus is derived the word &quot;&quot; in English. The gods brought Pelops back to life, replacing the bone in his shoulder with a bit of ivory with the help of Hephaestus, thus marking the family forever afterwards.

=== Pelops and Hippodamia ===
Pelops married Hippodamia after winning a chariot race against her father, King Oenomaus, by arranging for the sabotage of his would-be-father-in-law&#x27;s chariot which resulted in his death, at which point the story diverges into multiple versions. The sabotage was arranged by Myrtilus, a servant of the king who was killed by Pelops for one of three reasons: 1) because he had been promised the right to take Hippodamia&#x27;s virginity, which Pelops retracted; 2) because he attempted to rape her, or; 3) because Pelops did not wish to share the credit for the victory. As Myrtilus died, he cursed Pelops and his line, further adding to the house&#x27;s curse.

=== Atreus and Thyestes ===

Pelops and Hippodamia had many sons; two of them were Atreus and Thyestes. Depending on myth versions, they murdered Chrysippus, who was their half-brother. Because of the murder, Hippodamia, Atreus, and Thyestes were banished to Mycenae, where Hippodamia is said to have hanged herself.

Atreus vowed to sacrifice his best lamb to Artemis. Upon searching his flock, however, Atreus discovered a golden lamb which he gave to his wife, Aerope, to hide from the goddess. She gave it to Thyestes, her lover and Atreus&#x27; brother, who then persuaded Atreus to agree that whoever had the lamb should be king. Thyestes produced the lamb and claimed the throne.

Atreus retook the throne using advice he received from Zeus, who sent Hermes to him, advising him to make Thyestes agree that if the sun rose in the west and set in the east, the throne of the kingdom should be given back to Atreus. Thyestes agreed, but then Helios did exactly that, rising where he usually set and setting where he usually rose, not standing the injustice of Thyestes&#x27; usurpation. The people then bowed to the man who had managed to reverse the circuit of the Sun.
Atreus then learned of Thyestes&#x27; and Aerope&#x27;s adultery and plotted revenge. He killed Thyestes&#x27; sons and cooked them, save their hands and feet. He tricked Thyestes into eating the flesh of his own sons and then taunted him with their hands and feet. Thyestes was forced into exile for eating human flesh. Thyestes responded by asking an oracle what to do, who advised him to have a son by his daughter, Pelopia, who would then kill Atreus. However, when their son Aegisthus was first born, he was abandoned by his mother, who was ashamed of the incestuous act. A shepherd found the infant Aegisthus and gave him to Atreus, who raised him as his own son. Only as he entered adulthood did Thyestes reveal the truth to Aegisthus, that he was both father and grandfather to the boy. Aegisthus then killed Atreus, although not before Atreus and Aerope had had two sons, Agamemnon and Menelaus, and a daughter Anaxibia.

Agamemnon married Clytemnestra, and Menelaus married Helen, her famously attractive sister. Helen later left Sparta with Paris of Troy, and Menelaus called on all of his wife&#x27;s former suitors to help him take her back.

=== Agamemnon, Iphigenia, Clytemnestra, Aegisthus, Orestes and Electra ===
Prior to sailing off to war against Troy, Agamemnon had angered the goddess Artemis because he had killed a sacred deer in a sacred grove, and had then boasted that he was a better hunter than she was. When the time came, Artemis stilled the winds so that Agamemnon&#x27;s fleet could not sail. A prophet named Calchas told him that in order to appease Artemis, Agamemnon would have to sacrifice the most precious thing that had come to his possession in the year he killed the sacred deer. This was his first-born daughter, Iphigenia. He sent word home for her to come (in some versions of the story on the pretense that she was to be married to Achilles). Iphigenia accepted her father&#x27;s choice and was honored to be a part of the war. Clytemnestra tried to stop Iphigenia but was sent away. After doing the deed, Agamemnon&#x27;s fleet was able to get under way.

While he was fighting the Trojans, his wife Clytemnestra, enraged by the murder of her daughter, began an affair with Aegisthus. When Agamemnon returned home he brought with him a new concubine, the doomed prophetess, Cassandra. Upon his arrival that evening, before the great banquet she had prepared, Clytemnestra drew a bath for him and when he came out of the bath, she put the royal purple robe on him which had no opening for his head. He was confused and tangled up. Clytemnestra then stabbed him to death.

Agamemnon&#x27;s only son, Orestes, was quite young when his mother killed his father. He was sent into exile. In some versions he was sent away by Clytemnestra to avoid having him present during the murder of Agamemnon; in others his sister Electra herself rescued the infant Orestes and sent him away to protect him from their mother. In both versions he was the legitimate heir apparent and as such a potential danger to his usurper uncle.

Goaded by his sister Electra, Orestes swore revenge. He knew it was his duty to avenge his father&#x27;s death, but saw also that in doing so he would have to kill his mother. He was torn between avenging his father and sparing his mother. &#x27;It was a son&#x27;s duty to kill his father&#x27;s murderers, a duty that came before all others. But a son who killed his mother was abhorrent to gods and to men&#x27;.

When he prayed to Apollo, the god advised him to kill his mother. Orestes realized that he must work out the curse on his house, exact vengeance and pay with his own ruin. After Orestes murdered Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus, he wandered the land with guilt in his heart. After many years, with Apollo by his side, he pleaded to Athena. No descendant of Atreus had ever done so noble an act and &#x27;neither he nor any descendant of his would ever again be driven into evil by the irresistible power of the past.&#x27; Thus Orestes ended the curse of the House of Atreus.

This story is the major plot line of Aeschylus&#x27;s trilogy &quot;The Oresteia&quot;.

== Classical references ==
Plato in his dialogue &quot;The Statesman&quot; tells a &quot;famous tale&quot; that &quot;the sun and the stars once rose in the west, and set in the east, and that the god reversed their motion, and gave them that which they now have as a testimony to the right of Atreus.&quot; Virgil, in book IV of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, refers to the House of Atreus and specifically Orestes in describing the death of Dido.

==Hittite records==
There is a possible reference to Atreus in a Hittite text known as the &quot;Indictment of Madduwatta&quot;. The indictment describes several army clashes between the Greeks and the Hittites which took place around the late 15th or early 14th centuries BC. The Greek leader was a man called Attarsiya, and some scholars have speculated that Attarsiya or Attarissiya was the Hittite way of writing the Greek name Atreus. Other scholars argue that even though the name is probably Greek (since the man is described as an Ahhiyawa) and related to Atreus, the person carrying the name is not necessarily identical to the famous Atreus.

<doc id="80579" wikidata="Q52383" url="?curid=80579" title="Droid (Star Wars)">
<text>In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; space opera franchise, a droid is a fictional robot possessing some degree of artificial intelligence&quot;.&quot; The term is a clipped form of &quot;android&quot;, a word originally reserved for robots designed to look and act like a human. The word &quot;android&quot; itself stems from the New Latin word &quot;androīdēs&quot;, meaning &quot;manlike&quot;, itself from the Ancient Greek &quot;ἀνδρος&quot; (andrós) (genitive of &quot;ἀνήρ&quot; (anḗr), &quot;man (adult male)&quot; or &quot;human being&quot;) + &quot;-ειδής&quot; (-eidḗs), itself from &quot;εἶδος&quot; (eîdos, &quot;form, image, shape, appearance, look&quot;).

Writer and director George Lucas first used the term &quot;droid&quot; in the second draft script of &quot;Star Wars,&quot; completed 28 January 1975. However, the word does have a precedent: science fiction writer Mari Wolf used the word in her story &quot;Robots of the World! Arise!&quot; in 1952. It is not known if Lucas knew of this reference when he wrote &quot;Star Wars&quot;, or if he came up with the term independently.

The word &quot;droid&quot; has been a registered trademark of Lucasfilm Ltd since 1977.

==Behind the scenes==
Droids are performed using a variety of methods, including robotics, actors inside costumes (in one case, on stilts), and computer animation.

===Trademark===
Lucasfilm registered &quot;droid&quot; as a trademark in 1977. The term &quot;Droid&quot; has been used by Verizon Wireless under licence from Lucasfilm, for their line of smartphones based on the Android operating system. Motorola&#x27;s late-2009 Google Android-based cell phone is called the Droid. This line of phone has been expanded to include other Android-based phones released under Verizon, including the HTC Droid Eris, the HTC Droid Incredible, Motorola Droid X, Motorola Droid 2, and Motorola Droid Pro. The term was also used for the Lucasfilm projects EditDroid, a non-linear editing system, and SoundDroid, an early digital audio workstation. The name &quot;Omnidroid&quot; was used with permission of Lucasfilm for the 2004 Pixar movie, &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, referring to a line of lethal robots built by the film&#x27;s antagonist.

==Fictional types of droids==
The franchise, which began with the 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;, features a variety of droids designed to perform specific functions. According to background material, most droids lack true sentience and are given processing abilities sufficient only to carry out their assigned function. However, over time droids may develop sentience on their own as they accumulate experience. Periodic memory wipes can prevent this from happening, but those who manage to escape this fate will begin to develop their own personalities.

Within the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, a class system is used to categorize different droids depending on their skill-set: first class droids (physical, mathematical and medical sciences), second class droids (engineering and technical sciences), third class droids (social sciences and service functions), fourth class droids (security and military functions), and fifth class droids (menial labor and other non-intelligence functions).

===Protocol droid===
A protocol droid specializes in translation, etiquette and cultural customs, and is typically humanoid in appearance. Protocol droids are used to aid in communications during diplomatic or business negotiations and often function as personal assistants to their owners. Protocol droids are also used for military service, whether as administrators, couriers or spies. However, they do have a tendency to be eccentric and fussy.

The most notable example is C-3PO, introduced in &quot;Star Wars&quot; and featured in all sequels and prequels. 4-LOM is a protocol droid turned bounty hunter who responds to Darth Vader&#x27;s call to capture the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980). TC-14 is a droid with feminine programming that appears in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), and ME-8D9 is an &quot;ancient protocol droid of unknown manufacture&quot; that resides and works as a translator at Maz Kanata&#x27;s castle on Takodana in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015).

===Astromech droid===
An astromech droid is one of a series of &quot;versatile utility robots generally used for the maintenance and repair of starships and related technology&quot;. These small droids usually possess &quot;a variety of tool-tipped appendages that are stowed in recessed compartments&quot;. On certain spacecraft such as X-wing starfighters, astromech droids also double as the ship&#x27;s navigational system. In addition to assisting with piloting and maintenance, astromech droids work in conjunction with the ship&#x27;s hyperdrive to plot a safe course when traveling at faster-than-light speeds.

R2-D2 is an astromech droid introduced in 1977&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; and featured in all subsequent films. The malfunctioning droid R5-D4 also makes a brief appearance in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. U9-C4 is a timid droid sent on a mission with D-Squad, an all-droid special unit in &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, C1-10P (nicknamed &quot;Chopper&quot;) is an oft-repaired, &quot;outmoded&quot; astromech who is one of the main characters of &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, and BB-8 is the astromech droid of X-wing fighter pilot Poe Dameron in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;.

===Battle droid===

A battle droid is a class of war robot used as an easily controlled alternative to human soldiers, most notably seen in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy of films and the &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; TV series, in which &#x27;B1&#x27; and &#x27;B2&#x27; models are frequent antagonists. Due to their ubiquity, the terms &#x27;B1&#x27; and &#x27;battle droid&#x27; are used interchangeably; &#x27;B2&#x27; models are also referred to as &#x27;super&#x27; battle droids. These droids are mainly used as the primary troops of the Confederacy of Independent Systems or Separatist Alliance, acting as the counterpart to the clone troopers of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars.

The tall, thin B1 model resembles the Geonosian species, whose Baktoid Armor Workshop designed and built the droids for the Trade Federation and later the Separatists. Standing tall, B1 battle droids were given a humanoid appearance so they could operate existing machinery and weaponry, and are meant to be cheaply mass-produced in large numbers. During the Battle of Naboo, battle droids were controlled from a central command computer as a cost-saving measure. By the time of the Clone Wars, this drawback was rectified by giving them the capacity for limited independent thought called free thinkers. The B2 super battle droid, introduced in the Battle of Geonosis, was designed by the Techno Union and manufactured by Baktoid as an improvement of the original B1 model. Heavily armored and capable of limited independent thought, it features an integrated dual laser cannon in its right arm.

B1 battle droids have been criticized for being ineffective and boring opponents in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, easily destroyed and devoid of any personality. However, Rafael Motamayor of SyFy Wire argues that the 2008 &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; television series rehabilitated their image by giving them distinct personalities. With the in-universe explanation that battle droids were upgraded to have independent thought, battle droids in the series are shown with self-awareness of their cannon fodder nature. This is often used as comic relief as battle droids comment on their tragic situation and even question orders that would get themselves or other battle droids killed.

Beyond the B1 and B2 models, multiple other types of specialized battle droids have been featured in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; fictional universe. The droideka is a three-legged heavy infantry unit designed by the Colicoids, a bloodthirsty insect-like species which it resembles. It is equipped with twin blasters and a deflector shield generator and can transform into its wheel form, allowing the droideka to roll towards the enemy at speeds of up to . Commando droids are superior versions of the B1 battle droid, built sturdier with armor to withstand blaster fire and more advanced combat programming and battlefield awareness. The T-series tactical droids serve as advisors to Separatist commanders or command groups of other battle droids, while super tactical droids serve as generals of droid armies and fleets. Droid vehicles and spacecraft include Vulture droids, Dwarf spider droids and Hailfire droids. After the Clone Wars, the Imperial Senate banned the manufacture of battle droids, but with loopholes for the building of &quot;security&quot; droids and experimental combat droids. This includes the Imperial military&#x27;s KX-series of which K-2SO is an example, as well as Moff Gideon&#x27;s pure-droid heavy-duty Dark Troopers.

===Probe droid===

Probe droids are deployed by the Empire in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; to search for hidden rebel bases. They are described as traveling via hyperdrive-equipped pods to almost anywhere in the galaxy in order to search for their target. Also called probots, they are in height, floating above the ground on repulsorlifts and propelled by silenced thrusters. Probots are equipped with a variety of sensing equipment, including motion detectors and ultraviolet sensors, a blaster for self-defense, and a HoloNet transceiver to transmit any discoveries to Imperial forces.

During the production of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Joe Johnston drew storyboard panels influenced by Dan O&#x27;Bannon and Moebius&#x27;s short comic &quot;The Long Tomorrow&quot; (1975), one of which repurposes a pose Johnston admitted he borrowed from said work. The same panel of the comic features a robot design by Moebius, which may have been the basis of the probe droid (or &quot;probot&quot;) design that concept designers Johnston and Ralph McQuarrie created for the film.

===Other droids===
Labor droids are used for a variety of tasks, from the very simple such as lifting heavy objects to the complex such as repairing machinery or administrating entire facilities, though their programming is very task-specific. Examples include mining droids which extract valuable resources, often from hazardous environments, and power droids, mobile fusion reactors which recharge ships, machines and other droids. Interrogation droids utilize a variety of devices, chemicals and techniques to exploit a prisoner&#x27;s weaknesses in order to extract information from them. Assassin droids such as the IG-series act with ruthless efficiency to hunt down their targets; while some serve other masters, others may operate independently. Medical droids on the other hand work tirelessly to heal people who have been harmed, whether as medical assistants, midwives or doctors. Many possess an encyclopedic knowledge of different species&#x27; physiologies so that patients can be properly diagnosed and treated.

==List of droid characters==
==Reception==
Many film scholars link the portrayal of droids in &quot;Star Wars&quot; to racial or class politics, technophobia, or sexual and reproductive anxieties. Dan Rubey, for example, sees the original film as establishing a &quot;race hierarchy&quot; with droids on the bottom rung. J. P. Telotte sees the droids as part of a human-over-nonhuman and living-over-nonliving hierarchy in the film, describing them as &quot;essentially slaves to a superior mankind, embodying a romantic dream of obedience and dogged faithfulness to a master.&quot; Diana Sandars follows a similar vein, seeing droids as a negative counterpoint to humanity, epitomized in Darth Vader&#x27;s mechanical body, having &quot;vanquished his human nobility.&quot; Writing before the release of the prequels, in which Obi-Wan Kenobi&#x27;s relationship to droids differed from the original trilogy, Lane Roth instead saw the droids as a means of establishing the moral standing of human characters, with &quot;sympathetic&quot; characters like Obi-Wan treating them kindly (calling R2-D2 &quot;my little friend&quot; and listing the droids as passengers, not cargo) and initially &quot;unsympathetic&quot; ones, like Han Solo and the Tattooine Bartender, neglecting or abusing them. Cyrus Patell reads them similarly, referring to the droids as both &quot;an ethical index&quot; and a manifestation of technophobia. Meanwhile, Nicholas Wanberg sees the portrayal of droid characters, especially through the prequel films, as playing on racialized sexual and reproductive anxieties through contrasting origin settings between more or less &quot;White&quot; droids, different mind-body relationships, and reenactments of swamping fears.

<text>Calchas (; , &quot;Kalkhas&quot;) is an Argive mantis, or &quot;seer,&quot; dated to the Age of Legend, which is an aspect of Greek mythology. Calchas appears in the opening scenes of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, which is believed to have been based on a war conducted by the Achaeans against the powerful city of Troy in the Late Bronze Age.

Calchas, a seer in the service of the army before Troy, is portrayed as a skilled augur, Greek &quot;ionópolos&quot; (&#x27;bird-savant&#x27;): &quot;as an augur, Calchas had no rival in the camp.&quot;

He received knowledge of the past, present, and future from the god, Apollo. He had other mantic skills as well: interpreting the entrails of the enemy during the tide of battle. His mantosune, as it is called in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, is the hereditary occupation of his family, which accounts for the most credible etymology of his name: “the dark one” in the sense of “ponderer,” based on the resemblance of pondering to melancholy, or being “blue.” Calchas has a long literary history after Homer. His appearance in the &quot;Iliad&quot; is no sort of “first” except for the chronological sequence of literature. In the legendary time of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, seers and divination are already long-standing.

== Description ==
Calchas was described by the chronicler Malalas in his account of the &quot;Chronography&quot; as &quot;short, white, all grey, including the beard, hairy, a very fine seer and omen-reader&quot;.

== Family ==
Calchas was the son of Polymele and Thestor; grandson of the seer Idmon; and brother of Leucippe, Theonoe, and Theoclymenus.

==Career==
It was Calchas who prophesied that in order to gain a favourable wind to deploy the Greek ships mustered in Aulis on their way to Troy, Agamemnon would need to sacrifice his daughter, Iphigeneia, to appease Artemis, whom Agamemnon had offended. The episode was related at length in the lost &quot;Cypria&quot;, of the Epic Cycle. He also states that Troy will be sacked on the tenth year of the war.

In Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Ajax&quot;, Calchas delivers a prophecy to Teucer suggesting that the protagonist will die if he leaves his tent before the day is out.

=== &quot;Iliad&quot; ===
In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Calchas is cast as the apostle of divine truth. His most powerful skeptic is Agamemnon himself. Before the events of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, at the beginning of the expedition, Agamemnon had to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to receive favorable sailing winds. At the beginning of the &quot;Iliad&quot; Calchas delivers another blow to him.

In open assembly, Calchas prophesied that the captive Chryseis, a spoil of war awarded to Agamemnon, must be returned to her father Chryses in order to propitiate Apollo into lifting the plague he sent as punishment for Agamemnon&#x27;s disrespect of Chryses, Apollo&#x27;s priest. Agamemnon exploded in anger and called the prophet a &quot;visionary of hell&quot; (Fitzgerald translation) and accused Calchas of rendering unfair prophecies. Fearing Agamemnon, Calchas had already secured a champion in Achilles, who spoke against Agamemnon in heated terms in assembly. Agamemnon grudgingly accepted the edict of Apollo (supported by the Assembly) that he give up his prize, but, as an insult to Achilles, threatens to take Achilles’ own female prize as recompense. There follows &quot;the wrath of Achilles,&quot; part righteous anger, part galling resentment over the unjustified overreaching of Agamemnon, part love for his war bride. This dispute is a central focus of the epic.

Later in the story, Poseidon assumes the form of Calchas in order to rouse and empower the Greek forces while Zeus is not observing the battle.

=== &quot;Posthomerica&quot; ===
Calchas also plays a role in Quintus of Smyrna&#x27;s &quot;Posthomerica&quot;. Calchas said that if they were brief, they could convince Achilles to fight. It is he rather than Helenus (as suggested in Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Philoctetes&quot;) that predicts that Troy will only fall once the Argives are able to recruit Philoctetes. It is by his advice that they halt the battle, even though Neoptolemus is slaughtering the Trojans. He also tells the Argives that the city is more easily taken by strategy than by force. He endorses Odysseus&#x27; suggestion that the Trojan Horse will effectively infiltrate the Trojans. He also foresees that Aeneas will survive the battle and found the city, and tells the Argives that they will not kill him. He did not join the Argives when they boarded the ships, as he foresaw the impending doom of the Kapherean Rocks.

==Death==
Calchas died of shame at Colophon in Asia Minor shortly after the Trojan War (as told in the Cyclic &quot;Nostoi&quot; and &quot;Melampodia&quot;): the prophet Mopsus beat him in a contest of soothsaying, although Strabo placed an oracle of Calchas on Monte Gargano in Magna Graecia.

It is also said that Calchas died of laughter when he thought another seer had incorrectly predicted his death. This seer had foretold Calchas would never drink from the wine produced from vines he had planted himself; Calchas made the wine, but holding the cup he died of laughter, before he could inform them they had drunk it the previous night.

In medieval and later versions of the myth, Calchas is portrayed as a Trojan defector and the father of Chryseis, now called Cressida.

Calchas is a character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;.

<doc id="80585" wikidata="Q508543" url="?curid=80585" title="Aerope">
<text>In Greek mythology, Aerope (Ancient Greek: Ἀερόπη) was a Cretan princess as the daughter of Catreus, king of Crete. She was the sister of Clymene, Apemosyne and Althaemenes. After an oracle said he would be killed by one of his children, Catreus gave Aerope to Nauplius to be sold abroad. Nauplius spared her, and she became the wife of Atreus or Pleisthenes (or both). By most accounts, she is the mother of Agamemnon and Menelaus. While the wife of Atreus, she became the lover of his brother Thyestes, and gave Thyestes the golden lamb that allowed him to become king of Mycenae.

==Family==
Aerope&#x27;s father was Catreus, son of Minos, and king of Crete. Catreus had two other daughters, Clymene and Apemosyne, and a son, Althaemenes.

In most accounts, Aerope was the mother of Agamemnon and Menelaus, fathered by Atreus. However, their father is occasionally named as Pleisthenes. In other retellings, Aerope was instead the mother of Pleisthenes by Atreus. When Pleisthenes died young, his sons, Agamemnon and Menelaus, were adopted by Atreus. In others, Aerope was the wife of &quot;both&quot; Atreus and Pleisthenes, having married Atreus after Pleisthenes died, with Atreus adopting her children from the first marriage. Such accounts were perhaps attempts to reconcile separate traditions.

According to Hyginus, Aerope was the mother of two sons, Tantalus and Pleisthenes, fathered by Thyestes. He claims these were the children that Atreus famously fed to Thyestes. Additionally, Aerope has also been named as the mother of a daughter, Anaxibia.

==Mythology==
===In Crete===
According to the tradition followed by Euripides in his lost play &quot;Cretan Women&quot; (&quot;Kressai&quot;), Catreus found Aerope in bed with a slave and handed her over to Nauplius to be drowned. Instead, Nauplius spared Aerope&#x27;s life and she married Pleisthenes. Sophocles, in his play &quot;Ajax&quot;, may also refer to Aerope&#x27;s father finding her in bed with a man and handing her over to Nauplius to be drowned. However, the potentially corrupt text may instead refer to Aerope&#x27;s husband Atreus finding her in bed with Thyestes, and having her drowned (see below).

The mythographer Apollodorus followed a different tradition, with no mention of any sexual transgression. In his account, Catreus gave Aerope and her sister Clymene to Nauplius to be sold off in foreign lands after an oracle prophesied that he would be killed by one of his children. Aerope&#x27;s brother Althaemenes also found out about the prophecy, and fearing that &quot;he&quot; would be the one to kill Catreus, fled to Rhodes with Apemosyne. In this telling, Aerope eventually becomes the wife of Pleisthenes.

===In Mycenae===
From Crete, Aerope was taken to Mycenae. There, while the wife of Atreus, she became the lover of Atreus&#x27; twin brother Thyestes, involving herself in the brothers&#x27; power struggle for the kingship of Mycenae.

Atreus and Thyestes were the sons of Pelops and Hippodamia, king and queen of Pisa. Their desire for their father&#x27;s throne led to the murder of their half-brother Chrysippus, for which they were banished, and sought refuge in Mycenae. According to Hyginus, the brothers were encouraged to commit the act by their mother Hippodamia, who killed herself upon being accused of doing so. When the Perseid dynasty came to an end, the Myceneans received a prophesy saying they should choose a son of Pelops as their king. Aerope stole the golden lamb (a portent linked to the kingship of Mycenae) from her husband Atreus and gave it to Thyestes, so that the Myceneans would choose Thyestes as their king.

From Byzantine period annotations to Euripides&#x27; &quot;Orestes,&quot; we learn that, in some unspecified Sophocles work, Atreus cast Aerope into the sea in revenge for her adultery and theft of the golden lamb.

==Sources==
===Early===
Mentions of Aerope apparently occurred as early as &quot;Homer&quot; and &quot;Hesiod&quot;. An &quot;Iliad&quot; scholium tells us that:
:According to Homer, Agamemnon was the son of Pelops’ son Atreus, and his mother was Aerope; but according to Hesiod he was the son of Pleisthenes [and Aerope?].

Since Aerope is not in Homer&#x27;s Iliad or &quot;Odyssey&quot; (where Agamemnon and Menelaus were the sons of Atreus, with no mother mentioned), the scholiast is presumably taking the Homeric reference from somewhere in the Epic Cycle, which was also attributed to Homer.

Fragmentary lines from the Hesiodic &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot; seem to make Aerope, (without naming a father) the mother of three sons Agamemnon, Menelaus (and Anaxibios?). While the Byzantine scholar John Tzetzes says that according to &quot;Hesiod&quot;, Aerope was, by Atreus, the mother of Pleisthenes.

===Fifth century BC===
The story of Aerope, Atreus and Thyestes, was popular in Greek tragedy, however no complete plays on the story survive. Aeschylus&#x27; play &quot;Agamemnon&quot; contains several obscure allusions to the story, which indicate that, by at least 458 BC, the story was well known. In that play, Cassandra hints at Aerope&#x27;s affair with Thyestes, where he is referred to as &quot;the one who defiled&quot; his &quot;brother&#x27;s bed&quot;.

There are many references to Aerope in the plays of Euripides. She was apparently an important character in his lost tragedy &quot;Cretan Women&quot;. The play told how Aerope was &quot;secretly violated by a servant&quot;, and that when her father discovered this, he gave her to Nauplius to be drowned, but instead Nauplius gave her in marriage to Pleisthenes. According to the scholiast on Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Frogs&quot; 849, her behavior in the play was &quot;like a whore&#x27;s&quot;. This, along with Euripides treatment of other &quot;profligate women&quot; suggests that the play dealt with Aerope&#x27;s seduction of Thyestes, rather than Thyestes&#x27; seduction of Aerope. Although she was given to Pleisthenes as his wife, in his &quot;Cretan Women&quot;, in his plays &quot;Orestes&quot;, and &quot;Helen&quot;, Euripides has Agamemnon and Menelaus as the sons of Aerope and Atreus. Also in his &quot;Orestes&quot;, he refers to the &quot;treacherous love of Cretan Aerope in her treacherous marriage&quot;, while in his &quot;Electra&quot;, he tells us that Thyestes, &quot;persuaded Atreus&#x27; own wife to secret love, and carried off to his house the portent; coming before the assembly he declared that he had in his house the horned sheep with fleece of gold.&quot; Euripides possibly also wrote a play &quot;Thyestes&quot;.

Sophocles, in his play &quot;Ajax&quot;, refers to Aerope being found in bed with a lover, and ordered drowned by someone&#x27;s &quot;father&quot;. As the text stands, the &quot;father&quot; is Aerope&#x27;s, and the reference is to Catreus giving her to Nauplius to be drowned, as in Euripides’ &quot;Cretan Women&quot;. However, a small &quot;correction&quot; to the text would make the father Agamemnon&#x27;s, and the reference would then be to Atreus finding Aerope in bed with Thyestes. There were several other plays by Sophocles, all lost, which presumably also dealt with the story: &quot;Atreus&quot;, &quot;Thyestes&quot; (possibly more than one), and &quot;Thyestes in Sicyon&quot;. Byzantine scholia to Euripides&#x27; &quot;Orestes&quot; 812, possibly referring to the passage from the &quot;Ajax&quot; noted above, say that in some (unnamed) play by Sophocles, Atreus &quot;revenged himself on his wife Aerope (both because of her adultery with Thyestes and because she gave away the lamb) by casting her into the sea&quot;.

Agathon, wrote a play titled &quot;Aerope&quot; (and a &quot;Thyestes&quot;), and perhaps so did the younger Carcinus. We are told that in some such play, Alexander of Pherai was moved to tears by the performance of the actor Theodorus as Aerope, suggesting a sympathetic portrayal.

===Late===
The Roman mythographer Hyginus has Agamemnon as the son of Aerope and Atreus and Tantalus and Plethenes as the sons of Aerope and Thyestes, with these being the children that Atreus fed to Thyestes.
In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Ars Amatoria&quot;, Aerope is given as one of several examples of &quot;women&#x27;s lust&quot; being &quot;keener&quot; than men&#x27;s and having &quot;more of madness&quot;:
:Had the Cretan woman abstained from love for Thyestes (and is it such a feat to be able to do without a particular man?), Phoebus had not broken off in mid-career, and wresting his car about turned round his steeds to face the dawn.

The mythographer Apollodorus gives the following account:
:Catreus, son of Minos, had three daughters, Aerope, Clymene, and Apemosyne, and a son, Althaemenes. When Catreus inquired of the oracle how his life should end, the god said that he would die by the hand of one of his children. ... And Catreus gave Aerope and Clymene to Nauplius to sell into foreign lands; and of these two Aerope became the wife of Plisthenes, who begat Agamemnon and Menelaus.

However elsewhere he says that Agamemnon and Menelaus were the sons of Aerope and Atreus and that
:the wife of Atreus was Aerope, daughter of Catreus, and she loved Thyestes. And Atreus once vowed to sacrifice to Artemis the finest of his flocks; but when a golden lamb appeared, they say that he neglected to perform his vow, and having choked the lamb, he deposited it in a box and kept it there, and Aerope gave it to Thyestes, by whom she had been debauched.

==Similarities with Auge and Danae==
Stories of Aerope share key elements with those of Auge and Danae. These elements include prophesies of death, daughters&#x27; sexual impurity, and punishment by their fathers by either being cast into the sea or given away to be sold overseas.

Auge was the daughter of Aleus, king of Tegea, and the mother of the hero Telephus. According to one version of the story, Aleus had received a prophesy that his sons would be killed by the son of Auge. In response, Aleus made Auge a priestess of Athena, a role which required her to remain a virgin. Nevertheless, she became pregnant by Heracles. Then, by various accounts, she was either cast into the sea or given to Nauplius to be either drowned or sold overseas. However, regardless of the telling, she ends up in Mysia as the wife of King Teuthras.

Danae was the daughter of Acrisius, king of Argos, and the mother of the hero Perseus. An oracle told Acrisius that he would be killed by the son of Danae, so he locked her away. Nevertheless, Danae became pregnant by Zeus and gave birth to their son Perseus. In response, Acrisius locked her and her son in a wooden chest and cast it into the sea, hoping to kill them without invoking the wrath of the gods. They survived through Zeus and Poseidon&#x27;s intervention, and washed up on the shores of Seriphos.

<doc id="80586" wikidata="Q622504" url="?curid=80586" title="Thyestes">
<text>In Greek mythology, Thyestes (pronounced , , ) was a king of Olympia. Thyestes and his brother, Atreus, were exiled by their father for having murdered their half-brother, Chrysippus, in their desire for the throne of Olympia. They took refuge in Mycenae, where they ascended the throne upon the absence of King Eurystheus, who was fighting the Heracleidae. Eurystheus had meant for their lordship to be temporary; it became permanent because of his death in conflict.

The most popular representation of Thyestes is that of the play &quot;Thyestes&quot; by Seneca in 62 AD. This play is one of the originals for the revenge tragedy genre. Although inspired by Greek mythology and legend, Seneca&#x27;s version is different.

== Family ==
Thyestes was the son of Pelops and Hippodamia, and father of Pelopia and Aegisthus. His three sons by a naiad, who were killed by Atreus, were named Aglaus, Orchomenus and Calaeus.

== Myth ==

Pelops and Hippodamia are parents to Thyestes. However, they were cursed by Myrtilus, a servant of King Oenomaus, the father of Hippodamia. Myrtilus was promised the right to Hippodamia&#x27;s virginity and half of Pelops&#x27; kingdom, but Pelops denied both to him and killed him by throwing him into the sea. With his dying gasp, Myrtilus cursed their line, which is where Thyestes and Atreus come in.

Thyestes&#x27; brother and King of Mycenae, Atreus, vowed to sacrifice his best lamb to Artemis. Upon searching his flock, however, Atreus discovered a golden lamb which he gave to his wife, Aerope, to hide from the goddess. She gave it to her lover, Thyestes, who then convinced Atreus to agree that whoever had the lamb should be king. Thyestes produced the lamb and claimed the throne.

Atreus retook the throne using advice he received from the gods. Zeus sent Hermes to him, advising him to get Thyestes to agree that should the sun rise in the west and set in the east, Atreus could have his throne back. Atreus did so, and Helios reversed his normal course, in anger over Thyestes&#x27; actions.

Atreus then learned of Thyestes&#x27; and Aerope&#x27;s adultery and plotted revenge. He killed Thyestes&#x27; sons and cooked them, save their hands and heads. He served Thyestes his own sons and then taunted him with their hands and heads. This is the source of modern phrase &quot;Thyestean feast&quot;, meaning one at which human flesh is served. When Thyestes was done with his feast, he released a loud belch, which represents satiety and pleasure and his loss of self-control.

An oracle then advised Thyestes that, if he had a son with his own daughter Pelopia, that son would kill Atreus. Thyestes did so by raping Pelopia (his identity hidden from her) and the son, Aegisthus, did kill Atreus. However, when Aegisthus was first born, he was abandoned by his mother, ashamed of the origin of her son. A shepherd found the infant Aegisthus and gave him to Atreus, who raised him as his own son. Only as he entered adulthood did Thyestes reveal the truth to Aegisthus, that he was both father and grandfather to the boy and that Atreus was his uncle. Aegisthus then killed Atreus.

While Thyestes ruled Mycenae, the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus, were exiled to Sparta. There, King Tyndareus accepted them as the royalty that they were. Shortly after, he helped the brothers return to Mycenae to overthrow Thyestes, forcing him to live in Kythira, where he died.

===Legacy===
As a token of good will and allegiance, King Tyndareus offered his daughters to Agamemnon and Menelaus as wives, Clytemnestra and Helen respectively.

When Agamemnon left Mycenae for the Trojan War, Aegisthus seduced Agamemnon&#x27;s wife, Clytemnestra, and the couple plotted to kill her husband upon his return. They succeeded, killing Agamemnon and his new concubine, Cassandra. Clytemnestra and Aegisthus had three children: Aletes, Erigone, and Helen who died as an infant.

Seven or eight years after the death of Agamemnon, Agamemnon&#x27;s son Orestes returned to Mycenae and, with the help of his cousin Pylades and his sister Electra, killed both their mother, Clytemnestra, and Aegisthus.

Tired of the bloodshed, the gods exonerated Orestes and declared this the end of the curse on the house of Atreus, as described in Aeschylus&#x27; play &quot;The Eumenides&quot;.

However, other stories say that when Aletes and Erigone came of age and became rulers at Mycenae, Orestes returned with an army then killed his half-brother and raped his half-sister, who gave birth to a son, Penthilus.



==Theatre==
In the first century AD, Seneca the Younger wrote a tragedy called &quot;Thyestes&quot;. In 1560 Jasper Heywood, then a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, published a verse translation. Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; derives some of its plot elements from the story of Thyestes. In 1681, John Crowne wrote &quot;Thyestes, A Tragedy&quot;, based closely on Seneca&#x27;s Thyestes, but with the incongruous addition of a love story. Prosper Jolyot Crebillon (1674–1762) wrote a tragedy &quot;Atree et Thyeste&quot; (1707), which is prominent in two tales of ratiocination by Edgar Allan Poe. In 1796, Ugo Foscolo (1778–1827) wrote a tragedy called &quot;Tieste&quot; that was first presented in Venice one year later. Caryl Churchill, a British dramatist, also wrote a rendition of &quot;Thyestes.&quot; Churchill&#x27;s specific translation was performed at the Royal Court Theater Upstairs in London on June 7, 1994. In 2004, Jan van Vlijmen (1935–2004) completed his opera &quot;Thyeste&quot;. The libretto was a text in French by Hugo Claus, based on his 20th century play with the same title (in Dutch: &quot;Thyestes&quot;). Thyestes appears in Ford Ainsworth&#x27;s one-act play, &quot;Persephone&quot;.

Seneca&#x27;s influence in literature is reflected through other works. In Arnold&#x27;s Sonnet on Shakespeare, the influence of Seneca is apparent. &quot;The reminiscence of Atreus&#x27; speech in the &quot;Thyestes&quot; of Seneca, which might subtend Cleopatra&#x27;s own passionate, distended rhetoric about Antony&quot; (Edgecombe, 257).

<text>In Greek mythology, Pelopia or Pelopea or Pelopeia (Ancient Greek: Πελόπεια) was a name attributed to four individuals:

* Pelopia, a Theban princess as one of the Niobids, children of King Amphion and Niobe, daughter of King Tantalus of Lydia. She was slain by Artemis.
*Pelopia, daughter of Pelias, King of Iolcus by either Anaxibia or Phylomache, daughter of Amphion. She appears briefly in the &quot;Argonautica&quot;, giving her brother Acastus a mantle of double fold before he sails off with the Argonauts. She and her sisters killed their father, having been tricked by Medea into believing this was needed to rejuvenate him.
*Pelopia, mother of Cycnus by Ares.
*Pelopia, daughter of Thyestes by whom she mothered Aegisthus.

Tyndareus was the son of Oebalus (or Perieres) and Gorgophone (or Bateia). He married the Aetolian princess, Leda, by whom he became the father of Castor, Clytemnestra, Timandra, Phoebe and Philonoe, and the stepfather of Helen of Troy and Pollux.

==Mythology==

=== Early years ===
Tyndareus had a brother named Hippocoon, who seized power and exiled Tyndareus. He was reinstated by Heracles, who killed Hippocoon and his sons. Tyndareus’ other brother was Icarius, the father of Penelope.

Tyndareus’ wife Leda was seduced by Zeus, who disguised himself as a swan. She laid two eggs, each producing two children; Castor and Pollux, and Helen of Troy and Clytemnestra.

When Thyestes seized control in Mycenae, two exiled princes, Agamemnon and Menelaus came to Sparta, where they were received as guests and lived for a number of years. The princes eventually married Tyndareus&#x27; daughters, Clytemnestra and Helen respectively.

=== Curse of the goddess ===
According to Stesichorus, while sacrificing to the gods Tyndareus forgot to honor Aphrodite and thus the goddess was angered and made his daughters twice and thrice wed and deserters of their husbands. As Hesiod also says:
===Helen and the Trojan War===

Helen was the most beautiful woman in the world, and when it was time for her to marry, many Greek kings and princes came to seek her hand or sent emissaries to do so on their behalf. Among the contenders were Odysseus, Ajax the Great, Diomedes, Idomeneus, and both Menelaus and Agamemnon. All but Odysseus brought many and rich gifts with them. Helen&#x27;s favourite was Menelaus who, according to some sources, did not come in person but was represented by his brother Agamemnon, who chose to support his brother&#x27;s case, and himself married Helen&#x27;s half-sister Clytemnestra instead.
Tyndareus would accept none of the gifts, nor would he send any of the suitors away for fear of offending them and giving grounds for a quarrel. Odysseus promised to solve the problem in a satisfactory manner if Tyndareus would support him in his courting of Penelope, the daughter of Icarius. Tyndareus readily agreed and Odysseus proposed that, before the decision was made, all the suitors should swear a most solemn oath to defend the chosen husband against whoever should quarrel with the chosen one. This stratagem succeeded and Helen and Menelaus were married. Eventually, Tyndareus resigned in favour of his son-in-law and Menelaus became king.

Some years later, Paris, a Trojan prince came to Sparta to marry Helen, whom he had been promised by Aphrodite. Helen left with him – either willingly because she had fallen in love with him, or because he kidnapped her, depending on the source – leaving behind Menelaus and Hermione, their nine-year-old daughter. Menelaus attempted to retrieve Helen by calling on all her former suitors to fulfil their oaths, leading to the Trojan War.

===Afterwards===
According to Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Orestes&quot;, Tyndareus was still alive at the time of Menelaus’ return, and was trying to secure the death penalty for his grandson Orestes due to the latter&#x27;s murder of his own mother who was also Tyndareus’ daughter, Clytemnestra, but according to other accounts he had died prior to the Trojan War. In some versions of the myth, Tyndareus was one of the dead men resurrected by Asclepius to live again.

<text>In Greek mythology, the name Hippocoön (; , &quot;Hippokóōn&quot;) refers to several characters: 
*Hippocoon, in one account, father of Neleus, who is otherwise called son of Cretheus or Poseidon.
*Hippocoon, a Spartan king, father of Enarephoros and brother of Tyndareus from whom Hippocoon seized the kingship, then exiled Tyndareus.
*Hippocoon, the great-grandfather of Amphiaraus. The lineage is as follows: Zeuxippe, daughter of this Hippocoön, married Antiphates and gave birth to Oecles and Amphalces; Oecles, in his turn, married Hypermnestra, daughter of Thespius, and to them were born Iphianeira, Polyboea and Amphiaraus.
*Hippocoon, a Thracian counsellor and a kinsman of Rhesus, who fought at Troy. Awakened by Apollo, he is the first to discover the damage caused by Odysseus and Diomedes in the Thracian camp.
*Hippocoon, in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, son of Hyrtacus, one of the participants in the archery contest at Anchises&#x27;s funeral games. His arrow misses, striking the mast to which the target dove is tied.

<text>In Greek mythology, Oebalus, also spelled Oibalus or Oibalius, (; Ancient Greek: Οἴβαλος, &quot; Oíbalos&quot;) was a king of Sparta.

== Family ==
Oibalus was the son of either Cynortas or Argalus. He was the second husband of Princess Gorgophone and thus son-in-law of the hero Perseus. With her or by the Naiad Bateia, Oibalos fathered Tyndareus, Icarius and Hippocoon, as well as a daughter, Arene, who married her half-brother Aphareus. The nymph Pirene and Hyacinth were also called the daughter and son of Oebalius respectively. His grandchildren, the Dioscuri, were usually referred as Oibalids or Oebalidae.

Oebalus was often confused with Gorgophone&#x27;s first husband, Perieres, son of Aeolus. They were separate people, usually unrelated though Oebalus was sometimes said to be Perieres’ son.

<text>In Greek mythology, there were two women known as Philonoe () or Phylonoe ():

*Philonoe, a Spartan princess as the daughter of King Tyndareus and Leda, daughter of King Thestius of Pleuron. She was the sister of Castor and Pollux, Helen, Clytemnestra, Timandra and Phoebe. Artemis made her immortal.
*Philonoe, daughter of Iobates and first wife of Bellerophon by whom, she became the mother of Isander (Peisander), Hippolochus and Laodamia (Deidamia or Hippodamia). Philonoe was the sister of Stheneboea who loved Bellerophon more than her current husband, King Proetus of Argos. She was promised to Bellerophon after he vanquished the Chimera, the Amazons, and more tasks. Bellerophon was given half the kingdom as well as Philonoe&#x27;s hand in marriage. She was also known under several other names: Alkimedousa or Cassandra, Anticleia, or Pasandra.

<doc id="80596" wikidata="Q1065234" url="?curid=80596" title="Pleisthenes">
<text>In Greek mythology, Pleisthenes or Plisthenes (), is the name of several members of the house of Tantalus, the most important being a son of Atreus, said to be the father of Agamemnon and Menelaus. Although these two brothers are usually considered to be the sons of Atreus himself, according to some accounts, Pleisthenes was their father, but he died, and Agamemnon and Menelaus were adopted by their grandfather Atreus.

==Father of Agamemnon and Menelaus==
The Pleisthenes who was said to have been the father of Agamemnon and Menelaus is a puzzling figure, with a confused genealogy, complicated by the existence of other members of the house of Tantalus with the same name. According to the usual version of the story, followed by the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; of Homer, Atreus, the king of Mycenae was the father of Agamemnon and Menelaus, by Aerope, the daughter of the Cretan king Catreus. However, according to another tradition, Pleisthenes, the son of Atreus (or Pelops?) was the father, probably by Aerope, of Agamemnon and Menelaus, although some accounts have the mother as Cleolla or Eriphyle.

According to varying accounts, Pleisthenes&#x27; wife was Aerope, who he had received from the mariner hero Nauplius. Aerope&#x27;s father Catreus, either because, he found her in bed with a slave, or because of an oracle which said that one of his children would kill him, gave Aerope to Nauplius, to be either drowned, or sold as a slave. However, in both versions of the story, Nauplius spared Aerope and gave her to Pleisthenes.

According to this tradition, apparently, Pleisthenes died young, and Agamemnon and Menelaus were raised by their grandfather Atreus. Such accounts were perhaps attempts to reconcile contradictory traditions.

==Other Pleisthenes==
There were apparently other members of the house of Tantalus also named Pleisthenes:

*Pleisthenes, the son of Pelops. Some scholars have equated this Pleisthenes with the Pleisthenes who was the father of Agamenmnon and Menelaus.
*Pleisthenes, along with his brother Tantalus, were the infant sons of Thyestes and Aerope, who Atreus killed and served to Thyestes at a banquet.
*Pleisthenes, the son of Menealus, taken to Helen with her to Cypris.

==Sources==
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Pleisthenes is nowhere mentioned, and Agamemnon and Menelaus were the sons of Atreus However, from ancient commentators on the &quot;Iliad&quot; we are told of another tradition, followed by Hesiod, Aeschylus, Porphyry, and &quot;others&quot;, in which Pleisthenes was the father of Agamemnon and Menelaus. An &quot;Iliad&quot; scholium says that, according to Hesiod, Agamemnon was the son of Pleisthenes and Aerope. Another &quot;Iliad&quot; scholium, citing Porphyry and &quot;many others&quot;, says that Pleisthenes fathered Agamemnon and Menelaus, did nothing of note, and died young, with Atreus raising his sons.

Neither, of these &quot;Iliad&quot; scholia say who Pleisthenes&#x27; parents were, but Tzetzes&#x27; in his commentary on the &quot;Iliad&quot;, says that his father was Atreus and that, rather than being his wife, Aerope was his mother:
:According to Hesiod, Aeschylus, and some others, Pleisthenes was the son of Atreus and Aerope, and the children of Pleisthenes and Dias’ daughter Cleolla were Agamemnon, Menelaus, and Anaxibia. Because Pleisthenes died young, they were brought up by their grandfather Atreus, and so they are considered by many to be Atreids.

In a scholium on Euripides&#x27; &quot;Orestes&quot; (which has sometimes been attributed to Hellanicus), Pleisthenes is again the son of Atreus, and the father of Agamemnon, Menelaus and Anaxibia, but Cleolla, rather than being Pleisthenes&#x27; wife, is his mother, and his wife is the otherwise unknown Eriphyle.

The patronymic &quot;Pleisthenides&quot; occurs in several ancient sources. Stesichorus uses it twice, probably referring to Menelaus, in one fragment (209 &quot;PMG&quot;), and Agamemnon, in another (219 &quot;PMG&quot;). Ibycus refers to Agamemnon as &quot;the king Pleisthenides, leader of men, son of noble father Atreus&quot; (282 &quot;PMG&quot;), which would seemingly make &quot;some&quot; Pleisthenes an ancestor of Atreus. Bacchylides, in the same poem, refers to Menelaus as both &quot;Atreides&quot; and &quot;Pleisthenides&quot;. Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, refers to Agamemnon&#x27;s family as the Pleisthenidae (&quot;house of Pleisthenes&quot;), and the &quot;race of Pleisthenes&quot;, although exactly which branch of Agamemnon&#x27;s family is meant is unclear.

Pleisthenes was also the subject of Euripides&#x27;s lost tragedy, &quot;Pleisthenes&quot;. A possible plot for the play is found in Hyginus, &quot;Fabulae&quot; 86:
:Because Thyestes, son of Pelops and Hippodamia, lay with Aëropa, Atreus’ wife, he was banished from the kingdom by his brother Atreus. But he sent Atreus’ son, Plisthenes, whom he had reared as his own, to Atreus to be killed. Atreus, believing him to be his brother’s son, unknowingly killed his own son.

The mythographer Apollodorus gives an account of how Aerope came to be Pliesthenes&#x27; wife:
:And Catreus gave Aerope and Clymene to Nauplius to sell into foreign lands; and of these two Aerope became the wife of Plisthenes, who begat Agamemnon and Menelaus;
However, elsewhere he has Aerope as the wife of Atreus, and Agamemnon and Menelaus as the sons of her and Atreus,

Scholia to Pindar&#x27;s &quot;Olympian&quot; 1 mention a son, or bastard son, of Pelops, named Pleisthenes, which some scholars have identified with the Pleisthenes who was the father of Agamemnon and Menelaus.

<doc id="80597" wikidata="Q360112" url="?curid=80597" title="Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia">
<text>Boleslaus I (Czech: &quot;Boleslav I. Ukrutný&quot;; 915–972), a member of the Přemyslid dynasty, was ruler (&quot;kníže&quot;, &quot;prince&quot;) of the Duchy of Bohemia from 935 until his death in 972. He is notorious for the murder of his elder brother Wenceslaus I, through which he became duke. As duke, his decisions surrounding his dynasty led to the Christianization of Poland, which in turn led to the recognition of the Polish state by the papacy. This recognition helped to define medieval Poland as one of the first modern states.

Boleslaus I is generally respected by Czech historians as an energetic ruler who significantly strengthened the Bohemian state and expanded its territory. This perspective is fairly modern, as Boleslaus was often overshadowed by his brother Wenceslaus in terms of historical legacy. Certain medieval historians, notably Cosmas of Prague, overtly present Boleslaus as a cruel figure, particularly after the death of his brother. Over time, this perspective has evolved as modern historians have acknowledged his accomplishments as Duke through a more historically objective lens.

According to Cosmas, Duke Boleslaus I died on 15 July 967, a date questioned by modern researchers. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Boleslaus II (also known as Boleslaus the Pious).

==Early life==
===Family and the Přemyslid dynasty===
Boleslaus was the son of Duke Vratislaus I of Bohemia (d. 921) and Drahomíra (d. 934), who was likely a Hevellian princess. Vratislaus took over the rule in Prague around the time of Boleslaus&#x27; birth, during which he had to manage both the exertion of influence by the East Frankish dukes of Bavaria and Saxony and the Magyar incursions.

Vratislaus (and, by extension, Boleslaus) was part of the Přemyslid dynasty which had ruled the Duchy of Bohemia since c. 870. In the early years of the dynasty, Bořivoj I became Bohemia’s first duke to be baptized into the Christian Church, beginning a Christian ruling style that would continue throughout the reigns of proceeding rulers. Vratislaus I was a Christian ruler similar to his predecessors, focused on maintaining Bohemian peace and Christianizing the land. He raised his two sons, Wenceslaus I and Boleslaus I, in Christianity, influencing their future reigns.

=== Religion ===
Boleslaus I and his elder brother Wenceslaus were taught the Christian faith and to read the Psalms by their grandmother Ludmila. There is evidence that Boleslaus&#x27;s mother Drahomíra, who was pagan, might have influenced him against his brother and Christianity, though he later repented.

== Rise to Power ==
=== Frankish Invasion of Henry I ===
Upon his death, Duke Vratislaus was succeeded by his eldest son Wenceslaus. While the external situation worsened with the alliance between Duke Arnulf of Bavaria and the Saxon duke Henry I (also known as Henry the Fowler), King of East Francia from 919, Wenceslaus could only maintain his independence by entering an agreement to pay an annual tribute to the East Frankish (German) ruler.

As part of a 929 CE military campaign, Henry I led a march into Prague. In response, Wenceslaus surrendered almost immediately, reaffirming Frankish dominance in the region. Wenceslaus’ surrender would not have been surprising given his pacifist upbringing and the reputation of the Přemyslid dynasty as nonviolent rulers.

=== Assassination of Duke Wenceslaus I ===
In 935 (or in 929, according to other sources), Wenceslaus was murdered at Stará Boleslav after accepting an invitation from Boleslaus to celebrate the feast of Saints Cosmas and Damian with him there. Historians are uncertain of Boleslaus I’s motives for the assassination, but argue it was likely a desire for power, the influence of his pagan mother, or to put an end to Wenceslaus I’s political plans. Regardless of his specific motive, it was a planned political move that put Boleslaus I in power as Duke of Bohemia and opened the door for immense changes in the ruling style of the Přemyslid Dynasty.

After the assassination, a cult promoting Wenceslaus’ martyrdom immediately grew and the late duke was canonized. Some historians claim that Boleslaus played a large role in promoting the cult because the sacredness of the canonization would be an advantage to his rule. The violent murder of his predecessor indicates a shift away from the peaceful ruling of the Přemyslid Dynasty until this point, but the canonization confirmed Boleslaus I and the Přemyslid Dynasty’s kept ties with the Christian Church, illustrating the complex rule of Boleslaus I.

==Reign==

=== War with Otto I ===
Under Boleslaus’s rule, Bohemia renounced the rule of the Eastern Franks&#x27;s raging war with Otto the Great, the eldest son of Henry I. This war rejuvenated a newfound sense of unity within the kingdom as they came together to fight against the East Frankish Empire pushing them out of Prague. Boleslaus stopped the payment shortly after he ascended the throne, which led to this war with King Otto. In 935, Boleslaus attacked the Thuringian allies of the Saxons in the northwest and defeated two of Otto&#x27;s armies (from Thuringia and Merseburg). The war then deteriorated to border raids (the general pattern of warfare in this region at the time) and reached its conclusion in 950, when King Otto besieged a castle owned by Boleslaus&#x27;s son, Boleslaus II. This prompted Boleslaus to sign a peace treaty with Otto. Although he remained undefeated, he promised to resume the payment of tribute. However, because of his success against the Eastern Franks, Boleslaus would become a great ally to Otto the Great in his later conquest.

=== Military Conquests ===

Five years after the war with Otto, Boleslaus and the armies of the Bohemians and Franks allied against the Magyars in the victorious Battle of Lechfeld. After the battle, the remainder of the huge Magyar army turned to Bohemia, where it was crushed by Boleslaus. He had also helped Otto to crush an uprising of Slavic tribes led by the Obotrite princes Nakon and Stojgněv on the Lower Elbe river in the Battle on the Raxa. The defeat of the invading Hungarians brought the same benefits to both Franks and Bohemians. Less obvious is what Boleslaus expected to gain from his participation in Otto&#x27;s war against the Obotrite princes in the far north. He probably wanted to ensure that his powerful Frankish neighbors did not interfere with him in expanding the Bohemian territories to the east. As a result of the victory, Boleslaus freed the Moravian lands from Magyar raids and expanded his territory, which in turn was later conquered by Polish dukes and became known as Upper Silesia and Lesser Poland. By occupying the city of Kraków, he controlled important trade routes from Prague to Kiev and Lviv. He even allied with Mieszko in the campaign against the Saxon count Wichmann the Younger. Boleslaus was ambitious in his conquest gaining many new territories for Bohemia. It was under Boleslaus that the “Hradská Moustafa” system was created. In this system, strongholds are built all along the countryside. These strongholds were integral for keeping governance over the land, each castle holding importance whether militaristic, political, or religious. As the Bohemian territory expanded, so did the expansion of Christianity in those territories.

=== Religious Expansion ===
Despite his violent rise to power and aggressive ruling style that differed heavily from his predecessors, Boleslaus I kept strong ties with the Christian Church throughout his reign and played a part in further Christianizing Eastern Europe. Similarly to his predecessors, Duke Boleslaus I had several religious institutions built throughout Bohemia. This is not only a sign of his commitment to Christianity but monasteries also supported Bohemia through an elevated economy and the keeping of records, books, and manuscripts which are often written in monasteries.

Duke Boleslaus I made many alliances throughout his reign, and his alliance with Prince Mieszco I is often accredited with Christianizing Poland. The alliance between Bohemia and Poland was built through the marriage of Boleslaus I’s daughter, Doubravka, to Prince Miezco I of Poland. Doubravka refused to marry the Prince of Poland unless he converted to Christianity which he eventually did. This marriage was not only a strong political move to create an alliance between Bohemia and Poland but also a move to further the Christianization of Eastern Europe.

=== Economy and Trade ===
Under Boleslaus I, Prague was a major trading center and wealthy city. A narrative from a traveling Jewish merchant illustrates a prosperous city that traded goods as well as some form of cash. Flour, tin, slaves, and furs were desired among the Rus, Slavs, Turks, and Jews who are recorded to have traveled to Bohemia to trade for these goods. During the reign of the Boleslaus I, Prague was a production center as well, producing items like saddles, bridles, and shields. Bohemia also produced kerchiefs which were very thin and of no functional use but were used as precious items for trading. The expansive system of trade and production in Prague indicates cultural connections and foreign relationships that existed during the reign of Boleslaus I. Trading with foreign lands and people likely contributed to the spread of Christianity to Bohemia’s trading partners, further indicating a focus on Christianization under the rule of Boleslaus I. Boleslaus I and his predecessors are also known to have built churches, monasteries, and strongholds in the city of Prague. Medieval religious institutions were very wealthy and important in building both the city and Bohemia’s population and economy. The growing economic strength Bohemia while Duke Boleslaus I was in power built stability and influence which he would use in his efforts to centralize Bohemian power.

== Marriage and Children ==
Boleslaus&#x27; wife may have been Borgia. It is unknown if she was the mother of all four of his adult children:

=== Doubravka of Bohemia ===
To defuse the Bohemian-Polish conflict, Duke Boleslaus married his daughter Doubravka to the pagan Piast prince Mieszko I in 963/964. As a devout Christian, Doubravka refused to marry the prince unless he converted to Christianity. Contemporary historians claim that Doubravka refused to marry the prince unless he converted to Christianity, waiting until Prince Miesko I was baptized into the Christian Church to marry him. This marriage played a key role in the Christianization of Poland and set up a strong alliance between Bohemia and Poland.

=== Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia ===
After the death of Boleslaus I, he was succeeded as Duke by his son, Boleslaus II. Boleslaus II had a much kinder reputation than that of his father, possibly because of his strong Christian faith and philanthropy towards the church in the region.

=== Strachkvas of Bohemia ===
According to tradition, a son of Boleslaus I was born at exactly the same time that Wenceslaus was killed. The child was given the name &quot;Strachkvas&quot;, which means &quot;a dreadful feast&quot;. Remorseful of the killing of his brother, Boleslaus promised to have Strachkvas educated as a clergyman and devote his life to religion.

=== Mlada of Bohemia ===
Boleslaus I’s daughter, Mlada, was raised as a devout Cristian, allegedly having close ties with the pope, and was taught monastic discipline. She was consecrated abbess, changed her name to Mary, and was admitted to the Order of Saint Benedict, making her the first abbess of the monastery of St. George in Prague Castle.

<doc id="80598" wikidata="Q244318" url="?curid=80598" title="Briseis">
<text>Briseis (; , ), also known as Hippodameia (, ), is a significant character in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Her role as a status symbol is at the heart of the dispute between Achilles and Agamemnon that initiates the plot of Homer&#x27;s epic. She was married to Mynes, a son of the King of Lyrnessus, until the Achaeans sacked her city and she was given to Achilles shortly before the events of the poem. Being forced to give Briseis to Agamemnon, Achilles refused to reenter the battle.

== Description ==
Briseis receives the same minimal physical description as most other minor characters in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. She is described with the standard metrical epithets that the poet uses to describe a great beauty, though her appearance is left entirely up to the audience&#x27;s imagination. Her beauty is compared to that of the goddesses.

Briseis was imagined about two millennia later by the Byzantine poet John Tzetzes as: 

Meanwhile, in the account of Dares the Phrygian (probably the 5th century AD), Briseis was illustrated as &quot;... beautiful. She was small and blond, with soft yellow hair. Her eyebrows were joined above her lovely eyes. Her body was well-proportioned. She was charming, friendly, modest, ingenuous, and pious.&quot;

== Mythology ==
According to her mythology, Briseis was the daughter of Briseus and an unnamed mother. She had three full brothers who died in the sacking of Lyrnessus.

In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Achilles led the assault on Lyrnessus during the Trojan War, and slew several of the men in her family. She was subsequently given to Achilles as a war prize. In the Mycenaean Greek society described in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, captive women like Briseis were slaves and could be traded amongst the warriors. John Tzetzes suggests that it was Palamedes that abducted Briseis, and from the Achaeans&#x27; collected spoils Achilles was given Briseis. 

According to Book 1 of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, when Agamemnon was compelled by Apollo to give up his own slave, Chryseis, he demanded Briseis as compensation. This prompted a quarrel with Achilles that culminated with Briseis&#x27; delivery to Agamemnon and Achilles&#x27;s protracted withdrawal from battle. His absence had disastrous consequences for the Greeks. Despite Agamemnon&#x27;s grand offers of treasure and women, he did not return to the fray until the death of Patroclus.

Achilles was angry at Agamemnon, and seethed with rage in his tent that Agamemnon dared to insult him by stripping him of the prize that had been awarded to him. When Achilles returned to the fighting to avenge Patroclus&#x27;s death and Agamemnon returned Briseis to him, Agamemnon swore to Achilles that he had never had sex with Briseis.

When Odysseus, Ajax, and Phoenix visit Achilles to negotiate her return in book 9, Achilles refers to Briseis as his wife or his bride. He professes to have loved her as much as any man loves his wife, at one point using Menelaus and Helen to complain about the injustice of his &quot;wife&quot; being taken from him. This romanticized, domestic view of their relationship contrasts with book 19, in which Briseis herself speaks. As she laments Patroclus&#x27;s death, she wonders what will happen to her without his intercession on her behalf, saying that Patroclus promised her he would get Achilles to make her his legal wife instead of his slave. 

In book 19 of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Achilles makes a rousing speech to the Achaean soldiers. He publicly declares that he will ignore his anger with Agamemnon and return to battle. During his speech, Achilles says he wishes Briseis were dead, lamenting that she ever came between Agamemnon and himself. This contrasts his own statements in book 9.

She remained with Achilles until his death, which plunged her into great grief. She soon took it upon herself to prepare Achilles for the afterlife. According to Robert Bell, following his death, Briseis &quot;was given to one of Achilles&#x27;s comrades-at-arms just as his armor had been&quot;, after the fall of Troy.

In medieval romances, starting with the &quot;Roman de Troie&quot;, Briseis becomes Briseida and is the daughter of Calchas. She loves and is loved by Troilus and then Diomedes. She is later confused with Chryseis and it is under variations of that name that the character is developed further, becoming Chaucer&#x27;s Criseyde, then Shakespeare&#x27;s Cressida.

<text>In Greek mythology, Chryseis (, , ) is a Trojan woman, the daughter of Chryses. Chryseis, her apparent name in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, means simply &quot;Chryses&#x27; daughter&quot;; later writers give her real name as Astynome (). The 12th-century poet Tzetzes describes her to be &quot;very young and thin, with milky skin; had blond hair and small breasts; nineteen years old and still a virgin&quot;.

As the &quot;golden one&quot; she is also the title-giving character of the Baroque alchemical epic Chryseidos Libri IIII (1631).

== Mythology ==
Astynome was sent by her father for protection, or, according to others, to attend the celebration of a festival of Artemis in Hypoplacian Thebe or in Lyrnessus where she was taken as prisoner by the Achaeans. According to some, she was the wife of Eetion, king of Lyrnessus (usually described as the ruler of nearby Cilician Thebe), who was killed by the son of Peleus during his campaigns against the allies of Troy. However, according to the Byzantine poet John Tzetzes, he suggests that it was Palamedes that abducted Chryseis as well as Briseis.

In the first book of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, during the distribution of the booty, she was given to Agamemnon as a sex slave by unanimous decision, in view of his kingly office. He bragged that he preferred her as a bed-mate to his wife Clytemnestra, because of her figure, her grace, and her skill at domestic tasks. Her father, the priest of Apollo, came to the Achaeans&#x27; beachhead bearing the god&#x27;s sacred symbols and offered the Mycenaean king and his army gifts of gold and silver. Although the other warriors were eager to accept the ransom, Agamemnon rejected it. He treated the old man without the proper respect due to a priest, taunting him crassly with the image of the girl forever sharing his bed in distant Achaea, and sending him away rudely with threats of violence. Chryses, afraid, went apart and prayed on the beach for revenge. Apollo heard his prayer and, by means of his silver arrows, sent a plague sweeping through the Greek armies, so that Agamemnon was forced to give Astynome back in order to save his men from the disease. He sent Odysseus to return the maiden to Chryses. Agamemnon compensated himself for this loss by taking Briseis from Achilles. The offended Achilles refused to take further part in the Trojan War.

After the attack on Rhesus and his Thracian armies, Chryses came to the Greeks to thank them for returning his daughter, Astynome. Because of this kindness, and because he knew that his daughter had been properly treated, he brought her back for Agamemnon to have. A later Greek legend, preserved in Hyginus&#x27; &quot;Fabulae&quot;, states that she had a son named after her father by Agamemnon. In the city of Thebes in Asia Minor, Chryseis gave birth to Chryses and declared him to be a son of Apollo. This took place when she was released shortly as a prisoner and allowed to return to her hometown.

A few years later, when the children of Agamemnon, Orestes and Iphigenia took refuge in the Island of Sminthos, now the home of Chryseis and her family, she proposed surrendering the fugitives to King Thoas. Her son Chryses, learning they were his half-siblings, helped them to kill the Taurian king.

In medieval literature, Chryseis is developed into the character Cressida.

<text>In Greek mythology, Chryses (; Greek, &quot;Khrýsēs&quot;, meaning &quot;golden&quot;) was a Trojan priest of Apollo at Chryse, near the city of Troy.

== Family ==
According to a tradition mentioned by Eustathius of Thessalonica, Chryses and Briseus (father of Briseis) were brothers, sons of a man named Ardys (otherwise unknown).

== Mythology ==
During the Trojan War (prior to the actions described in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;), Agamemnon took Chryses&#x27; daughter Chryseis (Astynome) from Moesia as a war prize. When Chryses attempted to ransom her, Agamemnon refused to return her. Chryses prayed to Apollo, and he, in order to defend the honor of his priest, sent a plague sweeping through the Greek armies. Agamemnon was forced to give Chryseis back in order to end it. The significance of Agamemnon&#x27;s actions lies not in his kidnapping Chryseis (such abductions were commonplace in ancient Greece), but in his refusal to release her upon her father&#x27;s request.

<doc id="80608" wikidata="Q146906" url="?curid=80608" title="Hussein of Jordan">
<text>Hussein bin Talal (; 14 November 1935 – 7 February 1999) was King of Jordan from 11 August 1952 until his death in 1999. Hussein was born in Amman as the eldest child of Talal bin Abdullah and Zein Al-Sharaf.

Hussein was born in Amman as the eldest child of Talal bin Abdullah and Zein Al-Sharaf. Talal was at that time the heir to his own father, King Abdullah I. Hussein began his schooling in Amman, continuing his education abroad. After Talal became king in 1951, Hussein was named heir apparent. The Jordanian Parliament forced Talal to abdicate a year later due to his illness, and a regency council was appointed until Hussein came of age. He was enthroned at the age of 17 on 2 May 1953. Hussein was married four separate times and fathered eleven children.

Hussein, a constitutional monarch, started his rule by allowing the formation of the only democratically elected government in Jordan&#x27;s history in 1956, which he forced to resign a few months later, declaring martial law and banning political parties. Under Hussein, Jordan fought three wars with Israel, including the 1967 Six-Day War, which ended in Jordan&#x27;s loss of the West Bank. In 1970, Hussein expelled Palestinian fighters from Jordan in what became known as Black September. The King renounced Jordan&#x27;s ties to the West Bank in 1988 after the Palestine Liberation Organization was recognized internationally as the sole representative of the Palestinians. He lifted martial law and reintroduced elections in 1989 when riots over price hikes spread in southern Jordan. In 1994 he became the second Arab head of state to sign a peace treaty with Israel.

At the time of Hussein&#x27;s accession in 1953, Jordan was a young nation and controlled the West Bank. The country had few natural resources, and a large Palestinian refugee population as a result of the 1948 Palestine War. Hussein led his country through four turbulent decades of the Arab–Israeli conflict and the Cold War, successfully balancing pressures from Arab nationalists, Islamists, the Soviet Union, Western countries, and Israel, transforming Jordan by the end of his 46-year reign into a stable modern state. After 1967 he engaged in efforts to solve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. He acted as a conciliatory intermediate between various Middle Eastern rivals, and came to be seen as the region&#x27;s peacemaker. He was revered for pardoning political dissidents and opponents, and giving them senior posts in the government. Hussein, who survived dozens of assassination attempts and plots to overthrow him, was the region&#x27;s longest-reigning leader. He died at the age of 63 from cancer in 1999 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Abdullah II. Hussein is posthumously known by Jordanians as the &quot;Humane King&quot; for his openness and compassion.

==Early life==

Hussein was born at Al-Qasr Al-Sagheer at Raghadan Palace in Amman on 14 November 1935 to Crown Prince Talal and Princess Zein al-Sharaf. He was the eldest among his siblings, three brothers and two sistersPrincess Asma, Prince Muhammad, Prince Hassan, Prince Muhsin, and Princess Basma. During one cold Ammani winter, his baby sister Princess Asma died from pneumonia, an indication of how poor his family was thenthey could not afford heating in their house.

Hussein was the namesake of his paternal great-grandfather, Hussein bin Ali (Sharif of Mecca), the leader of the 1916 Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. Hussein claimed to be an agnatic descendant of Muhammad&#x27;s daughter Fatimah and her husband Ali, the fourth caliph, since Hussein belonged to the Hashemite family, which had ruled Mecca for over 700 yearsuntil its 1925 conquest by the House of Saudand has ruled Jordan since 1921. The Hashemites, the oldest ruling dynasty in the Muslim world, are the second-oldest-ruling dynasty in the world (after the Imperial House of Japan). Hussein&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Widjan Hanim, was the daughter of Shakir Pasha who was the Ottoman governor of Cyprus.

The young prince started his elementary education in Amman. He was then educated at Victoria College in Alexandria, Egypt. He proceeded to Harrow School in England, where he befriended his paternal second cousin Faisal II of Iraq, who was also studying there. Faisal was then King of Hashemite Iraq, but was under regency since he was still a minor.

Hussein&#x27;s grandfather, King Abdullah I, the founder of modern Jordan, did not see in his two sons Talal and Nayef potential for kingship, and therefore he focused his efforts on the upbringing of his grandson Hussein. A special relationship grew between the two. Abdullah assigned Hussein a private tutor for extra Arabic lessons, and Hussein acted as interpreter for his grandfather during his meetings with foreign leaders, as Abdullah understood English but could not speak it. On 20 July 1951, 15-year-old Prince Hussein travelled to Jerusalem to perform Friday prayers at the Masjid Al-Aqsa with his grandfather. A Palestinian assassin opened fire on Abdullah and his grandson, amid rumours that the King had been planning to sign a peace treaty with the newly established state of Israel. Abdullah died, but Hussein survived the assassination attempt and, according to witnesses, pursued the assassin. Hussein was also shot, but the bullet was deflected by a medal on his uniform that his grandfather had given him.

==Reign==
===Accession===
Abdullah&#x27;s eldest son, Talal, was proclaimed King of Jordan. Talal appointed his son Hussein as crown prince on 9 September 1951. After a reign lasting less than thirteen months, the Parliament forced King Talal to abdicate due to his mental statedoctors had diagnosed schizophrenia. In his brief reign, Talal had introduced a modern, somewhat liberal constitution in 1952 that is still in use today. Hussein was proclaimed king on 11 August 1952, succeeding to the throne three months before his 17th birthday. A telegram from Jordan was brought in to Hussein while he was staying with his mother abroad in Lausanne, Switzerland, addressed to &#x27;His Majesty King Hussein&#x27;. &quot;I did not need to open it to know that my days as a schoolboy were over,&quot; Hussein later wrote in his memoirs. He returned home to cheering crowds.

A three-man regency council made up of the prime minister and heads of the Senate and the House of Representatives was appointed until he became 18 (by the Muslim calendar). Meanwhile, Hussein pursued further study at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He was enthroned on 2 May 1953, the same day that his cousin Faisal II assumed his constitutional powers as king of Iraq.

===First years===
The teenaged king inherited the throne not only of Jordan, but also of the West Bank, captured by Jordan during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and annexed in 1950. The country was poor in natural resources, and had a large Palestinian refugee population resulting from the warthe annexation of the West Bank had made Palestinians two-thirds of the population, outnumbering Jordanians. Upon assuming the throne, he appointed Fawzi Mulki as prime minister. Mulki&#x27;s liberal policies, including freedom of the press, led to unrest as opposition groups started a propaganda campaign against the monarchy. Palestinian fighters (fedayeen, meaning self-sacrificers) used Jordanian-controlled territory to launch attacks against Israel, sometimes provoking heavy retaliation. One reprisal operation by Israel became known as the Qibya massacre; it resulted in the death of 66 civilians in the West Bank village of Qibya. The incident led to protests, and in 1954 Hussein dismissed Mulki amid the unrest and appointed staunch royalist Tawfik Abu Al-Huda. The country held parliamentary elections in October 1954, while the country&#x27;s parties were not yet fully organized. Abu Al-Huda lasted only a year, and the government underwent reshuffling three times within the following year.

The 1955 Baghdad Pact was a Western attempt to form a Middle Eastern alliance to counter Soviet influence and Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s Egypt. Jordan then found itself in the middle of Cold War tensions. Britain, Turkey, and Iraq were members of the pact, and Jordan was pressured by Britain to join. Nasserism (a socialist Pan-Arabist ideology) swept the Arab World in the 1950s, and the proposal to join the pact triggered large riots in the country. Curfews imposed by the Arab Legion did little to alleviate the situation and tensions persisted throughout 1955. The local unrest, periodically fueled by propaganda transmitted from Egyptian radios, was only calmed after the King appointed a new prime minister who promised not to enter the Baghdad Pact. Saudi Arabia found common ground with Egypt in their suspicions of the Hashemites, both in Jordan and in Iraq. The Saudis massed troops near Aqaba on Jordan&#x27;s southern borders in January 1956, and only withdrew after the British threatened to intervene on Jordan&#x27;s behalf. Hussein realized that the Arab nationalist trend had dominated Arab politics, and decided to start downgrading Jordan&#x27;s relationship with the British. On 1 March 1956, Hussein asserted Jordanian independence by Arabizing the army&#x27;s command: he dismissed Glubb Pasha as the commander of the Arab Legion and replaced all the senior British officers with Jordanians, thereby renaming it into the &quot;Jordan Armed Forces-Arab Army.&quot; He annulled the Anglo-Jordanian treaty and replaced British subsidies with Arab aid. Hussein&#x27;s bold decisions were met with admiration at home and relations with Arab states improved.
===&quot;A liberal experiment&quot;===
Egyptian president Nasser received an outpouring of support from the Arab public after the Egyptian–Czechoslovak arms deal was signed in September 1955, and his popularity in Jordan skyrocketed following the nationalization of the Suez Canal in July 1956; his actions were seen as a powerful stance against Western imperialism. Hussein was also supportive of the moves. The coinciding events in Egypt had Jordanian leftist opposition parties leaning greatly towards Nasser.

 The parliament that had been elected in 1954 was dissolved, and Hussein promised fair elections. The parliamentary election held on 21 October 1956 saw the National Socialist Party emerge as the largest party, winning 12 seats out of 40 in the House of Representatives. Hussein subsequently asked Suleiman Nabulsi, leader of the Party, to form a government, the only democratically elected government in Jordan&#x27;s history. Hussein called this a &quot;liberal experiment,&quot; to see how Jordanians would &quot;react to responsibility.&quot; On 29 October 1956, the Suez Crisis erupted in Egypt, as Britain, France, and Israel launched a military offensive to seize control of the canal. Hussein was furious but Nabulsi discouraged him from intervening. Nabulsi&#x27;s policies frequently clashed with that of King Hussein&#x27;s, including on how to deal with the Eisenhower Doctrine. The King had requested Nabulsi, as prime minister, to crack down on the Communist Party and the media it controlled. Nabulsi wanted to move Jordan closer to Nasser&#x27;s regime, but Hussein wanted it to stay in the Western camp.

Disagreements between the monarchy and the leftist government culminated in March 1957 when Nabulsi provided Hussein with a list of senior officers in the military he wanted to dismiss; Hussein initially heeded the recommendations. However, Nabulsi then presented an expanded list, which Hussein refused to act upon. Nabulsi&#x27;s government was forced to resign on 10 April. On 13 April, rioting broke in the Zarqa army barracks and the 21-year-old Hussein went to end the violence between royalist and Arab nationalist army units after the latter group spread rumors that the King had been assassinated. A 3,000-man Syrian force started moving south towards the Jordanian border in support of what they perceived as a coup attempt, but turned around after the army units showed their loyalty to the King. Two principal accounts emerged regarding the events at Zarqa, with the royalist version holding that the incident was an abortive coup by army chief of staff Ali Abu Nuwar against King Hussein, and the dissident version asserting that it was a staged, American-backed counter-coup by Hussein against the pan-Arabist movement in Jordan. In either case, Abu Nuwar and other senior Arabist officers resigned and were allowed to leave Jordan for Syria, where they incited opposition to the Jordanian monarchy. Hussein reacted by imposing martial law. Although he eventually relaxed some of these measures, namely military curfews and severe press censorship, Hussein&#x27;s moves significantly curtailed the constitutional democracy that existed in Jordan in the mid-1950s. The alleged conspirators were sentenced to 15 years in absentia, but later on were pardoned by Hussein in 1964 as part of his reconciliation efforts with his exiled opposition, and were entrusted with senior positions in the government.

===Arab Federation between Iraq and Jordan===
The 1950s became known as the Arab Cold War, due to the conflict between states led by Nasserist Egypt and traditionalist kingdoms led by Saudi Arabia. Egypt and Syria formed the United Arab Republic (UAR) on 1 February 1958, with the Republic&#x27;s presidency occupied by Nasser. As a counterweight, Hussein and his cousin, King Faisal II of Hashemite Iraq, established the Arab Federation on 14 February 1958 in an Amman ceremony. The two rival entities launched propaganda wars against each other through their radio broadcasts. Jordanian and Syrian forces clashed in March along the border. UAR-inspired conspiracies started to emerge against the Hashemite federation. An officer in Jordan was arrested for plotting to assassinate Hussein. It also emerged in Jordan that the UAR was planning to overthrow both Hashemite monarchies in July 1958. Jordan reacted by arresting 40 suspected army officers, and Hussein called in Iraqi army chief of staff Rafiq Aref to brief him on the exposed plot. Aref replied, &quot;You look after yourselves. Iraq is a very stable country, unlike Jordan. If there are any worries it is Jordan that should be worried.&quot; Although Faisal and Hussein enjoyed a very close relationship, Faisal&#x27;s Iraqi entourage looked down on Jordan; Hussein attributed this attitude to Iraqi crown prince &#x27;Abd al-Ilah&#x27;s influence.

The Lebanese, pro-Western government of Camille Chamoun was also threatened to be toppled by growing UAR-supported domestic opposition groups. The Iraqis sent a brigade to Jordan on 13 July at Hussein&#x27;s request. The Iraqi brigade&#x27;s departure to Jordan gave the conspirators in Iraq, led by Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim, the opportunity to strike. On 14 July, an Iraqi unit stormed the royal palace in Iraq, executed all members of the Iraqi royal family, and mutilated the bodies of the crown prince and the Iraqi prime minister of the Arab Federation, Nuri Al-Said. Devastated, Hussein ordered a Jordanian expedition led by Sharif Nasser to reclaim the Iraqi throne, but it was recalled after it was inside Iraq. Hussein, worried about a similar coup in Jordan, tightened martial law. American troops landed in both Lebanon and Jordan as a show of support for pro-Western regimes in the region against the Nasserist tide. By October, the situation had calmed, and Western troops were recalled.

Hussein went on a vacation to Switzerland on 10 November. As he was flying his own plane over Syria, it was intercepted by two Syrian jets that attempted to attack. Hussein outmaneuvered the Syrians and survived the assassination attempt, landing safely in Amman, where he received a hero&#x27;s welcomehis popularity in Jordan skyrocketed overnight. Golda Meir, an Israeli politician who would later become prime minister, was reported in 1958 as saying: &quot;We all pray three times a day for King Hussein&#x27;s safety and success.&quot; The Israelis preferred that Hussein remained in power, rather than a Nasserist regime. Hussein for his part held secret meetings with Israeli officials, including Meir, seeing the fate, needs, and challenges (e.g. water supply) of Jordan inextricably linked with those of Israel and therefore to be solved with the cooperation of the latter.

In 1959, Hussein embarked on a tour to different countries to consolidate bilateral ties. His visit to the United States gained him many friends in Congress after he spoke openly against Soviet influence in the Middle East, returning with a $50million aid package. Sadiq Al-Shar&#x27;a, an army general who accompanied Hussein to the United States, was found to have been plotting a coup against the monarchy. News of the arrest of the conspiring officers in Jordan coincided with Hussein&#x27;s visit to the US. Hussein was tipped off to Al-Shar&#x27;a&#x27;s involvement, but did not reveal it until they both landed back in Jordan. Al-Shar&#x27;a was tried and received the death penalty; Hussein reduced his sentence to life imprisonment. Four years later, Al-Shar&#x27;a was pardoned and appointed director of Jordan&#x27;s passport office.

===Assassination attempts===
Hazza&#x27; Majali was appointed by Hussein to form a government; it consisted of loyalists who had persuaded Hussein to launch an offensive against the Iraqi government to restore the Hashemite monarchy. The expedition was cancelled amid British opposition and the weakened state of the Royal Jordanian Air Force. UAR agents assassinated Prime Minister Majali with a bomb planted in his office. Twenty minutes later, another explosion went off; it was intended for Hussein as it was expected he would run to the scene, which he didhe was a few minutes late. Hussein, persuaded by Habis Majali, Hazza&#x27;s cousin and the army chief of staff, prepared for a retaliation against Syria, whose intelligence service was responsible for the assassination. He prepared three brigades in the north, but the operation was called off after combined pressures from the Americans and the British. Egyptian radios denounced Hussein as the &quot;Judas of the Arabs.&quot;

Hussein would be subjected to several more assassination attempts. One involved replacing his nose drops with strong acid. Another plot was uncovered after a large number of cats were found dead in the royal palace; it emerged that the cook had been trying poisons to use against the king. He was later pardoned and released after Hussein received a plea from the cook&#x27;s daughter. Assassination attempts against the king subsided after a successful coup toppled the Syrian regime on 28 September 1961 and the UAR collapsed. With a calmed situation in Jordan, the King issued his slogan &quot;Let us build this country to serve this nation.&quot; But critics considered the slogan mere lip service, saying Hussein showed little interest in the economic situation of the country, unlike the military and foreign relations aspects.

In January 1962 Wasfi Tal was appointed prime minister. The young politician who worked to bring sweeping reforms resigned after Hussein sought to solidify his position following the rise of the Nasser-supporting Ba&#x27;ath party to the governments of Iraq and Syria in two 1963 coups. The first direct contacts between Jordan and Israel started in early 1960s; Hussein had a Jewish doctor named Emmanuel Herbert who acted as intermediary between the two nations during Hussein&#x27;s visits to London. In the talks, Hussein highlighted his commitment to a peaceful resolution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. His secret rapprochement with Israel was followed by a public rapprochement with Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1964, which bolstered Hussein&#x27;s popularity both in Jordan and in the Arab world. Hussein received a warm welcome after visiting West Bank cities afterwards. The rapprochement with Nasser happened during the 1964 Arab League summit in Cairo, where the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) were established, and where Jordan agreed to join the United Arab Command. During the summit Nasser also attempted to convince Hussein to purchase Soviet weapons, but the Americans provided Hussein with tanks and jets instead, with the understanding that they would not be used in the West Bank at Israel&#x27;s request. The PLO identified itself as a representative of the Palestinian people, which clashed with Jordan&#x27;s sovereignty claim over the West Bank. The PLO started to demand that the Jordanian government legalize their activities, including the setting up of Palestinian armed units to fight Israel; the requests were denied.

===Samu Incident===

Hussein later stated that during one of his meetings with Israeli representatives: &quot;I told them I could not absorb a serious retaliatory raid, and they accepted the logic of this and promised there would never be one.&quot; The Palestinian nationalist organization Fatah started organizing cross-border attacks against Israel in January 1965, often drawing Israeli reprisals on Jordan. One such reprisal was the Samu Incident, an attack launched by Israel on 13 November 1966 on the Jordanian-controlled West Bank town of As-Samu after three Israeli soldiers were killed by a Fatah landmine. The assault inflicted heavy Arab casualties. Israeli writer Avi Shlaim argues that Israel&#x27;s disproportionate retaliation exacted revenge on the wrong party, as Israeli leaders knew from their coordination with Hussein that he was doing everything he could to prevent such attacks. The incident drew fierce local criticism of Hussein amid feelings he had been betrayed by the Israelis; Hussein also suspected that Israel had changed its attitude towards Jordan and had intended to escalate matters in order to capture the West Bank. Yitzhak Rabin, the then Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, later admitted the disproportionate reaction by Israel, and that the operation would have been better directed at Syria, which was supporting such attacks: &quot;We had neither political nor military reasons to arrive at a confrontation with Jordan or to humiliate Hussein.&quot;

The events at Samu triggered large-scale anti-Hashemite protests in the West Bank for what they perceived as Hussein&#x27;s incompetency for defending them against Israel: rioters attacked government offices, chanted pro-Nasser slogans, and called on Hussein to have the same fate as Nuri As-Saidthe Iraqi prime minister who had been killed and mutilated in 1958 along with the Iraqi royal family. Jordanians believed that after this incident, Israel would march on the West Bank whether or not Jordan joined the war. Perception of King Hussein&#x27;s efforts to come to peaceful terms with Israel led to great dissatisfaction among some Arab leaders. President Nasser of Egypt denounced Hussein as an &quot;imperialist lackey.&quot; In a meeting with American officials, Hussein, sometimes with tears in his eyes, said: &quot;The growing split between the East Bank and the West Bank has ruined my dreams,&quot; and, &quot;There is near despair in the army and the army no longer has confidence in me.&quot; Hussein travelled to Cairo on 30 May 1967 and hastily signed an Egyptian-Jordanian mutual defense treaty, returning home to cheering crowds. Shlaim argues that Hussein had possessed options, but had made two mistakes: the first was in putting the Jordanian army under Egyptian command; the second was in allowing the entry of Iraqi troops into Jordan, which raised Israeli suspicions against Jordan. Egyptian general Abdul Munim Riad arrived in Jordan to command its army pursuant to the pact signed with Egypt.

===Six-Day War===

On 5 June 1967 the Six-Day War began after an Israeli strike wiped out Egypt&#x27;s Air Force. The Egyptian army commander in Cairo transmitted to General Riad that the Israeli strike had failed, and that Israel&#x27;s Air Force was almost wiped out. Based on the misleading information from Cairo, Riad ordered the Jordanian army to take offensive positions and attack Israeli targets around Jerusalem. Jordanian Hawker Hunters made sorties but were destroyed by Israel when they went to refuel; Syria&#x27;s and Iraq&#x27;s air forces followed. Israel&#x27;s air superiority on the first day of war proved decisive. Two Israeli jets attempted to assassinate Hussein; one was shot down by anti-aircraft artillery, and the other shot directly at Hussein&#x27;s office in the royal palace. Hussein was not there, the CIA station chief in Amman Jack O&#x27;Connell relayed a message threatening the Israelis, and the attempts stopped. The Jordanians had prepared a war strategy, but the Egyptian commander insisted to build his strategy based on the misleading information from Egypt.

By 7 June fighting led the Jordanians to withdraw from the West Bank, and Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City and the Dome of the Rock were abandoned after desperate fighting. Israel blew up the bridges between the two banks to consolidate its control. Jordan suffered a severe setback with the loss of the West Bank, which contributed 40% to Jordan&#x27;s GDP in the tourism, industrial, and agricultural sectors. Around 200,000 Palestinian refugees fled to Jordan, destabilizing Jordan&#x27;s demographics. The loss of Jerusalem was critical to Jordan, and specifically for Hussein who held the Hashemite custodianship of Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem. Al-Aqsa mosque is the third holiest site in Islam, believed to be where Muhammad ascended to heaven. By 11 June Israel had decisively won the war by capturing the West Bank from Jordan, Gaza and the Sinai from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from Syria. Nasser and Hussein, recognizing their defeat, sought to work together towards a more moderate stance.

On 22 November 1967 the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved resolution 242, which became one of Jordan&#x27;s foreign policy cornerstones. It denounced acquisition of territory by force and called on Israel to withdraw from territories occupied in the 1967 war. Israel rejected the resolution. Hussein restarted talks with Israeli representatives throughout 1968 and 1969, but the talks went nowhereShlaim claims the Israelis stalled and that Hussein refused to cede any West Bank territory.

===Black September===
After Jordan lost control of the West Bank in 1967, Palestinian fighters known as &quot;fedayeen&quot;, meaning self-sacrificers, moved their bases to Jordan and stepped up their attacks on Israel and Israeli occupied territories. One Israeli retaliation on a PLO camp based in Karameh, a Jordanian town along the border with the West Bank, developed into a full-scale battle. It is believed that Israel had wanted to punish Jordan for its perceived support for the PLO. After failing to capture Yasser Arafat, the PLO leader, Israeli forces withdrew or were repulsed, but not before destroying the Karameh camp and sustaining relatively high casualties. 

The perceived joint Jordanian-Palestinian victory in the 1968 Battle of Karameh led to an upsurge of support in the Arab World for Palestinian fighters in Jordan. The PLO in Jordan grew in strength, and by the beginning of 1970 the fedayeen groups started to openly call for the overthrow of the Hashemite monarchy. Acting as a state within a state, the fedayeen disregarded local laws and regulations, and even attempted to assassinate King Hussein twice, leading to violent confrontations between them and the Jordanian army. Hussein wanted to oust the fedayeen from the country, but hesitated to strike because he did not want his enemies to use it against him by equating Palestinian fighters with civilians. PLO actions in Jordan culminated in the Dawson&#x27;s Field hijackings incident on 10 September 1970, in which the fedayeen hijacked three civilian aircraft and forced their landing in Zarqa, taking foreign nationals as hostages, and later bombing the planes in front of the international press. Hussein saw this as the last straw, and ordered the army to move.

On 17 September the Jordanian army surrounded cities that had a PLO presence, including Amman and Irbid, and began shelling the fedayeen, who had established themselves in Palestinian refugee camps. The next day, a force from Syria with PLO markings started advancing towards Irbid, which the fedayeen declared a &quot;liberated&quot; city. On 22 September, the Syrians withdrew after the Jordanian army launched an air-ground offensive that inflicted heavy Syrian losses, and after Israeli Air Force jets flew over Syrian units in a symbolic show of support of Hussein, but did not engage. An agreement brokered by Egyptian president Nasser between Arafat and Hussein led to an end to the fighting on 27 September. Nasser died the following day of a heart attack. On 13 October Hussein signed an agreement with Arafat to regulate the fedayeen&#x27;s presence, but the Jordanian army attacked again in January 1971. The fedayeen were driven out of Jordanian cities one by one until 2,000 fedayeen surrendered after being encircled in a forest near Ajloun on 17 July, marking the end of the conflict.

Jordan allowed the fedayeen to leave for Lebanon through Syria, an event that led to the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. The Black September Organization was founded the same year, named after the conflict. The organization claimed responsibility for the assassination of Jordanian prime minister Wasfi Tal in 1971, and the highly publicized 1972 Munich massacre against Israeli athletes.

In a speech to the Jordanian parliament on 15 March 1972, Hussein announced his &quot;United Arab Kingdom&quot; plan. Unlike the unitary state that had existed between the West Bank and Jordan during Jordan&#x27;s annexation of the West Bank (1950–1967), this plan envisaged two federal entities on each bank of the Jordan River. According to the proposal, the two districts of the federation would be autonomous, excluding the military and the foreign and security affairs that would be determined by an Amman central government. But the implementation of the plan was to be conditional upon achieving a peace agreement between Israel and Jordan. Ultimately, Hussein&#x27;s proposal was ruled out after it was vehemently rejected by Israel, the PLO, and several Arab states.

===Yom Kippur War===

After the 1967 war, Gunnar Jarring was appointed by the UN as a special envoy for the Middle East peace process, leading the Jarring Mission. The talks between Arab countries and Israel resulted in a deadlock. The stalemate led to renewed fears of another war between Arab countries and Israel. Worried that Jordan would be dragged into another war unprepared, Hussein sent Zaid Al-Rifai to Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in December 1972 to inquire. Sadat informed Al-Rifai that he had been planning a limited incursion in the Sinai that would allow some political manoeuvring. Sadat then invited Al-Rifai and Hussein to a summit on 10 September 1973 with him and Hafez al-Assad, who had become president of Syria. The summit ended with a restoration of ties between Jordan, Egypt, and Syria. Sadat disclosed to Assad and Hussein his intention to initiate military action. Hussein refused Sadat&#x27;s request to allow the fedayeen&#x27;s return to Jordan but agreed that in case of a military operation, Jordanian troops would play a limited defensive role in assisting the Syrians in the Golan Heights.

Egypt and Syria launched the Yom Kippur War against Israel in the Sinai and in the Golan Heights on 6 October 1973 without Hussein&#x27;s knowledge. Between 10 September and 6 October, Hussein secretly met with Israeli prime minister Golda Meir in Tel Aviv on 25 September. Israeli leaks of the meeting led to rumors in the Arab World that Hussein had tipped off Meir about Arab intentions. Hussein only discussed with Meir what both already knew, that the Syrian army was on alert. On 13 October Jordan joined the war and sent the 40thbrigade to assist the Syrians in the Golan Heights. Some see it as ironic that it was the same brigade that had been sent to deter the Syrian invasion during Black September in 1970. Subsequent peace talks with Israel collapsed; while Jordan wanted a complete Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, Israel preferred to retain control but with Jordanian administration.

In the 1974 Arab League summit held in Morocco on 26 October, a Fatah plot to assassinate Hussein upon his arrival was uncovered by the Moroccan authorities. The plot did not deter Hussein from joining the summit, but at the end Jordan had to join all the Arab countries in recognizing the PLO as &quot;the sole representative of the Palestinian people,&quot; a diplomatic defeat for Hussein. The relationship between Jordan and the United States deteriorated when Jordan refused to join the Camp David Accords. The Accords formed the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, and allowed the withdrawal of Israel from the Sinai. In 1978 Hussein went to Baghdad for the first time since 1958; there, he met Iraqi politician Saddam Hussein. When Saddam became president of Iraq in 1979, Hussein supported Saddam&#x27;s Iran–Iraq War that stretched from 1980 to 1988. The relationship grew as Saddam provided Jordan with subsidized oil, and Jordan allowed Iraq to use the Port of Aqaba for its exports.

===Involvement in peace initiatives===
When the PLO moved to Lebanon from Jordan after 1970, repeated attacks and counter-attacks occurred in southern Lebanon between the PLO and Israel. Two major Israeli incursions into Lebanon occurred in 1978, and the other in 1982, the latter conflict troubled Hussein as the IDF had laid siege to Beirut. The PLO was to be expelled from Lebanon, and Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Defense minister, suggested they be moved to Jordan where the monarchy would be toppled and Jordan would serve as an &quot;alternative Palestinian homeland.&quot; Sharon boasted: &quot;One speech by me will make King Hussein realize that the time has come to pack his bags.&quot; However, Arafat rejected Sharon&#x27;s suggestion, and the fedayeen were transported to Tunisia under American cover.
In 1983 American president Ronald Reagan suggested a peace plan that became known as the Reagan plan, similar to Hussein&#x27;s 1972 federation plan. Hussein and Arafat both agreed to the plan on 1 April, but the PLO&#x27;s executive office rejected it. A year and a half later, a renewed effort by Hussein to jump start the peace process culminated in the establishment of a Jordan–PLO accord that sought a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, an unprecedented milestone for the PLO and a Jordanian diplomatic victory. The accord was opposed by Israel and garnered no international support from either the United States or the Soviet Union. Around the same time, Hussein met Israel prime minister Shimon Peres on 19 July 1985 in the United Kingdom, where Peres assented to the accord, but later the rest of his government opposed it due to the PLO&#x27;s involvement. Subsequent talks between the PLO and Jordan collapsed after the PLO refused to make concessions; in a speech Hussein announced that &quot;after two long attempts, I and the government of Jordan hereby announce that we are unable to continue to coordinate politically with the PLO leadership until such time as their word becomes their bond, characterized by commitment, credibility and constancy.&quot;

Jordan started a crackdown on the PLO by closing their offices in Amman after the Israeli minister of defense, Yitzhak Rabin, requested it from Hussein in a secret meeting. Jordan announced a $1.3billion five-year development plan for the West Bank, in a bid to enhance its image in the West Bank residents at the expense of the PLO. Around the same time, Hussein became troubled after he heard that Israel had been selling American weapons to Iran, thereby lengthening the conflict between Iraq and Iran, both supporters of the PLO. The relationship between Hussein and Saddam became very closeHussein visited Baghdad 61 times between 1980 and 1990, and Saddam used Hussein to relay messages to several countries, including the US and Britain. In June 1982, after Iran&#x27;s victory seemed imminent, Hussein personally carried to Saddam sensitive photographic intelligence forwarded to him by the US. In return, Saddam provided incentives for Jordanian exports to Iraq, which accounted for a quarter of all Jordan&#x27;s exports, valued at $212.3million in 1989. Iraqi aid helped Jordan&#x27;s finances; Hussein had felt it humiliating to keep asking Gulf countries for assistance. Hussein made a little-known attempt to heal the rift between the two Ba&#x27;ath regimes of Iraq and Syria in April 1986. The meeting between Hafez al-Assad and Saddam Hussein occurred at an airbase in Al-Jafr in the eastern Jordanian desert. The talks lasted for a day, after which no progress was made. Saddam was angry at Al-Assad for supporting Iran against an Arab country, Iraq, and Al-Assad was adamant about establishing a union between Iraq and Syria, which Saddam rejected.

On 11 April 1987, after Yitzhak Shamir became prime minister of Israel, Hussein engaged in direct talks with Shamir&#x27;s foreign minister, Peres, in London. After reaching an agreement between Hussein and Peres on establishing an international peace conference, Shamir and the rest of the ministers in his cabinet rejected the proposal. On 8 November 1987 Jordan hosted an Arab League summit; Hussein enjoyed good relations with rival Arab blocs, and he acted as conciliatory intermediate. He helped mobilize Arab support for Iraq against Iran, and for Jordan&#x27;s peace efforts, and helped to end the decade-long Arab boycott of Egypta boycott that began after it unilaterally signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979. Hussein described the summit as one of the best moments in his life.

===Disengagement from West Bank===

On 9 December 1987 an Israeli truck driver ran over four Palestinians in a Gaza refugee camp, sparking unrest that spread to violent demonstrations in the West Bank. What began as an uprising to achieve Palestinian independence against the Israeli occupation turned into an upsurge of support for the PLO, which had orchestrated the uprising, and consequently diminished Jordanian influence in the West Bank. Jordanian policy on the West Bank had to be reconsidered following renewed fears that Israel would revive its proposal for Jordan to become an &quot;alternative Palestinian homeland.&quot; US Secretary of State George P. Shultz set up a peace process that became known as the Schulz Initiative. It called for Jordan rather than the PLO to represent the Palestinians; however, when Schultz contacted Hussein about the plan, he reversed his position and told him it was a matter for the PLO to decide.

The orchestrators of the Intifada were the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, which issued its 10th communiqué on 11 March 1988, urging its followers to &quot;intensify the mass pressure against the [Israel] occupation army and the settlers and against collaborators and personnel of the Jordanian regime.&quot; West Bank Palestinians deviation from the Jordanian state highlighted the need for a revision in Jordan&#x27;s policy, and Jordanian nationalists began to argue that Jordan would be better off without the Palestinians and without the West Bank. Adnan Abu Oudeh, a Palestinian descendant who was Hussein&#x27;s political advisor, Prime Minister Zaid Al-Rifai, army chief of staff Zaid ibn Shaker, Royal Court chief Marwan Kasim, and mukhabarat director Tariq Alaeddin, helped the King prepare West Bank disengagement plans. The Jordanian Ministry of Occupied Territories Affairs was abolished on 1 July 1988, its responsibilities taken over by the Palestinian Affairs Department. On 28 July Jordan terminated the West Bank development plan. Two days later a royal decree dissolved the House of Representatives, thereby removing West Bank representation in the Parliament. In a televised speech on 1 August, Hussein announced the &quot;severing of Jordan&#x27;s legal and administrative ties with the West Bank,&quot; essentially surrendering claims of sovereignty over the West Bank. The move revoked the Jordanian citizenship of Palestinians in the West Bank (who had obtained it since Jordan annexed the territory in 1950), but not that of Palestinians residing in Jordan. Nevertheless, the Hashemite custodianship over the Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem was retained. Israeli politicians were stunned, thinking it was a political manoeuvre so that the Palestinians could show support for Hussein, but later realized that it represented a shift in Jordan&#x27;s policy after Hussein asked his West Bank supporters not to issue petitions demanding that he relent. In a meeting in November 1988 the PLO accepted all United Nations resolutions and agreed to recognize Israel.

===1989 riots===
Jordan&#x27;s disengagement from the West Bank led to a slowing of the Jordanian economy. The Jordanian dinar lost a third of its value in 1988, and Jordan&#x27;s foreign debt reached a figure double that of its gross national product (GNP). Jordan introduced austerity measures to combat the economic crisis. On 16 April 1989 the government increased prices of gasoline, licensing fees, alcoholic beverages, and cigarettes, between 15% and 50%, in a bid to increase revenues in accordance with an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF agreement was to enable Jordan to reschedule its $6billion debt, and obtain loans totaling $275million over 18months. On 18 April riots in Ma&#x27;an spread to other southern towns such as Al-Karak and Tafila, where the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that around 4,000 people gathered in the streets and clashed with the police, resulting in six protesters killed and 42 injured, and two policemen killed and 47 injured.

Despite the fact that the protests were triggered by a troubling economic situation, the crowds&#x27; demands became political. Protesters accused Zaid Al-Rifai&#x27;s government of rampant corruption and demanded that the martial law in place since 1957 be lifted and parliamentary elections be resumed. The last parliamentary election had taken place in 1967, just before Jordan lost the West Bank, and when the parliament&#x27;s tenure ended in 1971, no elections could be held due to the fact that the West Bank was under Israeli occupation, but the West Bank&#x27;s status became irrelevant after Jordan&#x27;s disengagement in 1988. Hussein relented to the demands by dismissing Al-Rifai, and appointed Zaid ibn Shaker to form a new government. In 1986 a new electoral law was passed, which allowed the reintroduction of parliamentary elections to proceed smoothly. The cabinet passed amendments to the electoral law that removed articles dealing with West Bank representation. In May 1989, just before the elections, Hussein announced his intention to appoint a 60-person royal commission to draft a reformist document named the National Charter. The National Charter sought to set a timetable for democratization acts. Although most members of the commission were regime loyalists, it included a number of opposition figures and dissidents. Parliamentary elections were held on 8 November 1989, the first in 22 years. The National Charter was drafted and ratified by parliament in 1991.

===Gulf War===
A UN-brokered ceasefire became active in July 1988, ending the Iran-Iraq war. Hussein had advised Saddam after 1988 to polish his image in the West by visiting other countries, and by appearing at the United Nations for a speech, but to no avail. The Iraqi-Jordanian relationship developed into the Arab Cooperation Council (ACC), which also included Egypt and Yemen, on 16 February 1989, serving as a counter to the Gulf Cooperation Council. Saddam&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 led six months later to international intervention to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait in what became known as the Gulf War. Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait caught Hussein by surprise; he was the ACC chairman at that time, and a personal friend of Saddam&#x27;s. After informing the American president George H. W. Bush of his intention to travel to Baghdad to contain the situation, Hussein travelled to Baghdad on 3 August for a meeting with Saddam; at the meeting, the latter announced his intention to withdraw Iraqi troops from Kuwait only if Arab governments refrained from issuing statements of condemnation, and no foreign troops were involved. On Hussein&#x27;s way back from Baghdad, Egypt issued a condemnation of the Iraqi invasion. To Hussein&#x27;s dismay, Egyptian president Husni Mubarak refused to reverse his position and called for Iraq&#x27;s unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait. An Arab League summit held in Cairo issued a condemnation of Iraq with a fourteen-vote majority, despite calls by Jordan&#x27;s foreign minister Marwan Al-Kasim that this move would hinder Hussein&#x27;s efforts to reach a peaceful resolution. Both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia viewed Hussein with suspicionthey distrusted him and believed he was planning to obtain a share of Kuwait&#x27;s wealth.

On 6 August American troops arrived at the Kuwait-Saudi Arabian border, Saddam&#x27;s conditions were ignored, and Hussein&#x27;s role as mediator was undermined. Saddam then announced that his invasion had become &quot;irreversible,&quot; and on 8 August he annexed Kuwait. Jordan, along with the international community, refused to recognize the Iraqi-installed regime in Kuwait. The United States, seeing Jordan&#x27;s neutrality as siding with Saddam, cut its aid to Jordanaid on which Jordan depended; Gulf countries soon followed. Hussein&#x27;s position in the international community was severely affected, so severe that he privately discussed his intention to abdicate. Jordan&#x27;s public opinion was overwhelmingly against international intervention, and against Gulf rulers who were perceived to be greedy and corrupt. Hussein&#x27;s popularity among Jordanians reached its zenith, and anti-Western demonstrations filled the streets. But Western pundits viewed Hussein&#x27;s actions as impulsive and emotional, claiming that he could have dampened Jordanian public support for Iraq through better leadership. Hussein&#x27;s brother, Crown Prince Hassan, also disagreed with Hussein, but the King refused to recognize Saddam&#x27;s wrongdoings. In late August and early September Hussein visited twelve Western and Arab capitals in an effort to promote a peaceful resolution. He finished his tour by flying directly to Baghdad to meet Saddam, where he warned: &quot;Make a brave decision and withdraw your forces; if you don&#x27;t, you will be forced out.&quot; Saddam was adamant but agreed to Hussein&#x27;s request to release Western nationals who were being held as hostages. Threats of a war between Israel and Iraq were rising, and in December 1990 Hussein relayed a message to Saddam saying that Jordan would not tolerate any violations of its territory. Jordan dispatched an armored division to its borders with Iraq, and Hussein&#x27;s eldest son Abdullah was in charge of a Cobra helicopter squadron. Jordan also concentrated its forces near its border with Israel. Adding to Jordan&#x27;s deteriorating situation was the arrival of 400,000 Palestinian refugees from Kuwait, who had all been working there. By 28 February 1991 the international coalition had successfully cleared Iraqi forces from Kuwait.

===Peace with Israel===

Jordan participated in the imposition of economic sanctions against Iraq even though the sanctions would severely affect its economy. The effects of the Gulf War, the sanctions on Iraq, and the flow of refugees to Jordan were estimated by a UN report to be $1.5billion out of a gross domestic product (GDP) of $4.2billion in 1990, and $3.6billion out of a GDP of $4.7billion in 1991. The end of the Gulf War coincided with the end of the Cold War. This allowed the United States to play a more active role in solving the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Bush administration were still angry at Hussein for the Gulf War events but realized they needed Jordan&#x27;s participation in any peace process. Hussein agreed to an American request to join an international peace conference so that Jordan could start repairing its relationship with the United States and end its political isolation. Hussein&#x27;s moves towards democratization in 1989 and his stance during the 1990 Gulf War had won him considerable popularity across Jordan&#x27;s political spectrum. But when Hussein replaced his conservative prime minister, Mudar Badran, with liberal Palestinian Taher Al-Masri, who was in favor of peace negotiations with Israel, the Muslim BrotherhoodJordan&#x27;s main opposition group, who at that time occupied 22 out of 80 seats in the House of Representatives, and whose members and support came mostly from Palestinians in the countryvehemently rejected the new prime minister by voting against him during the vote of confidence. The Brotherhood also refused to participate in the National Congress where the King hoped to gather support for a peace settlement.

Hussein was tasked by the United States with forming a joint Palestinian-Jordanian delegation to participate in the Madrid Peace Conference. The 28-member delegation consisted of 14 Jordanians and 14 Palestinians. Along with solving the Palestinian problem, Jordan sought to safeguard its interests in relation to security, the economy, water, and the environment. The peace conference convened on 30 October 1991, with delegations representing all parties to the conflict, the United States and the Soviet Union as co-sponsors, and the United Nations as observer. The conference set a framework for negotiations, and PLO representatives offered to accept a Palestinian state under a confederation with Jordan. At home, the Muslim Brotherhood considered Al-Masri and his government as too liberal, and the Brotherhood merged with independent Islamists and formed the Islamic Action Front (IAF), increasing its representation to 34 in the 80-member House of Representative, a force strong enough to bring down the royally appointed government with a motion of a vote of no confidence. Hussein then replaced Al-Masri with his conservative cousin Zaid ibn Shaker. Subsequent peace talks continued in Washington, D.C., stretching from December 1991 to September 1993.

Hussein could not participate in the details of the talks, a task he handed to his brother Hassan. Hussein was referred to the Mayo Clinic in the United States after having urological problems; he had his left kidney removed after tests showed his ureter contained precancerous cells. When Hussein went back healed to Jordan, he received a hero&#x27;s welcomea third of Jordan&#x27;s population filled the streets to greet him. On 23 November 1992 he gave an unusually aggressive speech. He called on extremists on both the right and left of the political spectrum to end their opposition to the peace negotiations, denounced what he saw as the Gulf countries&#x27; undemocratic nature, and called on Saddam to introduce democracy to Iraq. Meanwhile, Yitzhak Rabin, under the leftist Labor Party, emerged as prime minister of Israel. Thus, the PLO and Israeli representatives were quick to reach an agreement, which culminated in the 1993 Oslo Accords. The Accords were held in secrecy between Arafat and Rabin without Hussein&#x27;s knowledge, completely marginalizing Jordan and the Palestinian-Jordanian delegation in Washington.

The parliamentary elections held on 8 November 1993 were the first multi-party elections since 1956, but the proportional representation voting system was replaced by the controversial one man, one vote system. The latter system was introduced to limit the Islamist opposition&#x27;s representation in the House of Representatives, by gerrymandering Palestinian majority areas and encouraging independents over partisan candidates. Consequently, the IAF&#x27;s seats decreased from 34 to 21 seats out of 80. On 25 July 1994 Rabin and Hussein appeared at the White House and signed the Washington declaration, which announced the &quot;end of the state of belligerency.&quot; Subsequent negotiations culminated in the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, signed on 26 October in a ceremony in Wadi Araba. The treaty was a culmination of over 58 secret meetings over 31 years between Hussein and Israeli leaders. The treaty recognized Jordan&#x27;s role in Jerusalem&#x27;s holy sites, which angered Arafat who had sought such a position. Jordan&#x27;s relations with the United States greatly improved: $700million worth of Jordan&#x27;s debt was forgiven by the United States Congress, and Bill Clinton&#x27;s administration authorized a substantial flow of aid to Jordan. After 1995 Hussein became increasingly critical of Saddam&#x27;s rule in Iraq.

On 4 November 1995 the Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist, who aimed to undermine Rabin&#x27;s peace efforts with the Palestinians. Due to the close relationship forged with Rabin during the negotiations of the treaty, Hussein was invited to give a speech during Rabin&#x27;s funeral in Jerusalem. This was the first time Hussein had been in Jerusalem since the 1967 war. Hussein drew parallels between Rabin&#x27;s assassination and his grandfather&#x27;s assassination in 1951: &quot;We are not ashamed, nor are we afraid, nor are we anything but determined to continue the legacy for which my friend fell, as did my grandfather in this city when I was with him and but a boy.&quot;

Jordan&#x27;s signing of a peace treaty with Israel, and other issues, were met with disdain by Syria&#x27;s president Hafez al-Assad. The CIA handed the King a detailed report in December 1995 warning him of a Syrian plot to assassinate him and his brother Hassan. A month later, the CIA sent Hussein another report warning Jordan of Iraqi plots to attack Western targets in Jordan to undermine Jordan&#x27;s security due to its support for the Iraqi opposition. In Israel, Shimon Peres of the leftist Labor Party and Benjamin Netanyahu of the right-wing Likud party, were competing for the post of prime minister. Hussein&#x27;s popularity in Israel had peaked after the peace treaty was signed, and he was expected to express support for a candidate. Hussein initially remained neutral, but later expressed support for Netanyahu. Efraim Halevy, then head of the Israeli intelligence agency (Mossad), claims that Hussein had preferred Netanyahu over Peres as he had deeply mistrusted the latter. The Israeli general election held on 29 May 1996 witnessed Netanyahu&#x27;s ascension to the prime ministry.

===Tensions with Israel===

Hussein&#x27;s support for Netanyahu soon backfired. Israel&#x27;s actions during the 1996 Qana massacre in Southern Lebanon, the Likud government&#x27;s decision to build settlements in East Jerusalem, and the events at the Temple Mount where clashes between Palestinian and Israeli police ensued after Israeli tunnel diggings around the Mount, generated an uproar of criticism for Netanyahu in the Arab World. On 9 March 1997 Hussein sent Netanyahu a three-page letter expressing his disappointment. The King lambasted Netanyahu, with the letter&#x27;s opening sentence stating: &quot;My distress is genuine and deep over the accumulating tragic actions which you have initiated at the head of the Government of Israel, making peace – the worthiest objective of my life – appear more and more like a distant elusive mirage.&quot;

Four days later, on 13 March, a Jordanian soldier patrolling the borders between Jordan and Israel in the north near the Island of Peace, killed seven Israeli schoolgirls and wounded six others. The King, who was on an official visit to Spain, returned home immediately. He travelled to the Israeli town of Beit Shemesh to offer his condolences to the grieving families of the Israeli children killed. He went on his knees in front of the families, telling them that the incident was &quot;a crime that is a shame for all of us. I feel as if I have lost a child of my own. If there is any purpose in life it will be to make sure that all the children no longer suffer the way our generation did.&quot; His gesture was received very warmly in Israel, and Hussein sent the families $1million in total as compensation for the loss of life. The soldier was determined to be mentally unstable by a Jordanian military tribunal and was sentenced to 20years in prison, which he served entirely.

Clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian groups in Gaza and the West Bank surfaced. Hussein&#x27;s wife, Queen Noor, later claimed her husband was having trouble sleeping: &quot;Everything he had worked for all his life, every relationship he had painstakingly built on trust and respect, every dream of peace and prosperity he had had for Jordan&#x27;s children, was turning into a nightmare. I really did not know how much more Hussein could take.&quot;

On 27 September 1997 eight Mossad agents entered Jordan using fake Canadian passports and attempted to assassinate Jordanian citizen Khaled Mashal, head of the Palestinian group Hamas. Hussein was preparing for a 30-year Hamas-Israel truce three days prior to the attempt, after Hamas had launched two attacks in Jerusalem. Two Mossad agents followed Mashal to his office and injected poison into his ears, but they were caught by Mashal&#x27;s bodyguard. The two agents were then held by the Jordanian police, while the six other agents hid in the Israeli embassy. Furious, Hussein met with an Israeli delegate who attempted to explain the situation; the King said in a speech about the incident that he felt that somebody &quot;had spat in his face.&quot; Jordanian authorities requested Netanyahu to provide an antidote to save Mashal&#x27;s life, but Netanyahu refused to do so. Jordan then threatened to storm the Israeli embassy and capture the rest of the Mossad team, but Israel argued that it would be against the Geneva Conventions. Jordan replied that the Geneva Conventions &quot;do not apply to terrorists,&quot; and a special operations team headed by Hussein&#x27;s son Abdullah was put in charge of the operation. Hussein called American president Clinton and requested his intervention, threatening to annul the treaty if Israel did not provide the antidote. Clinton later managed to get Israel&#x27;s approval to reveal the name of the antidote, and complained about Netanyahu: &quot;This man is impossible!&quot; Khaled Mashal recovered, but Jordan&#x27;s relations with Israel deteriorated and Israeli requests to contact Hussein were rebuffed. The Mossad operatives were released by Jordan after Israel agreed to release 23 Jordanian and 50 Palestinian prisoners including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.

Mounting opposition in Jordan to the peace treaty with Israel led Hussein to put greater restrictions on freedom of speech. Several dissidents were imprisoned including Laith Shubeilat, a prominent Islamist. A few months into his imprisonment, the King personally gave Shubeilat, his fiercest critic, a ride home from the Swaqa prison. However, the crackdown led the opposition groups in Jordan to boycott the 1997 parliamentary elections. In 1998 Jordan refused a secret request from Netanyahu to attack Iraq using Jordanian airspace after claiming Saddam held weapons of mass destruction.

==Illness, death and funeral==

In May 1998 Hussein, a heavy smoker, was admitted to the Mayo Clinic, but doctors were unable to diagnose his ailment. Hussein returned to the clinic in July after suffering severe fevers; doctors then diagnosed him with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He stayed in the clinic until the end of 1998, while his brother Hassan, who had been crown prince since 1965, acted as regent. He was given six courses of chemotherapy for his lymph gland cancer over a five-month period. Hussein gained the respect of the Mayo Clinic staff for his warmth and kindness; on one occasion, a janitor cried uncontrollably after Hussein prepared a birthday party for her in his suite.

In October 1998, Bill Clinton invited Hussein, during his stay at the clinic for chemotherapy treatment, to attend the Wye Plantation talks after a stalemate was reached between the Israeli and Palestinian delegations. Hussein, who looked bald and weakened, arrived and urged both Arafat and Netanyahu to overcome the obstacles. Encouraged by his presence, the two leaders agreed to resolve their difficulties. Hussein received a standing ovation at the ceremony and praise from Clinton for interrupting his treatment and coming over.

At home, 1998 was a difficult year for Jordanians: GDP growth had slowed considerably and could not keep pace with an accelerating population growth. Other incidents included a government scandal involving contamination of the country&#x27;s water supply. Samih Batikhi, the director of the General Intelligence Directorate (mukhabarat), visited Hussein during his stay at the Mayo Clinic to keep him updated. Batikhi discredited the King&#x27;s brother Hassan, and often voiced his support for Hussein&#x27;s eldest son Abdullah as successor. Abdullah, who was 36 years old at the time, enjoyed great support from the army. He was crown prince when he was born in 1962, but Hussein transferred the title to his brother Hassan in 1965 due to political uncertainty back then. King Hussein had changed his line of succession a total of four times: &quot;From his brother Muhammad, to his infant son Abdullah, to his second brother Hassan, and again to his then-grown-up son Abdullah.&quot; On his way back to Jordan in January 1999, Hussein stopped in London. Doctors advised him to rest and stay in England for a few weeks, as he was still too fragile to travel. According to Jordanian government sources, Hussein stated that:

Upon his arrival in Jordan, after a six-month medical absence from the country, he announced he was &quot;completely cured.&quot; Hussein returned and publicly criticized his brother Hassan&#x27;s management of Jordanian internal affairs. He also accused him of abusing his powers as regent and crown prince. On 24 January 1999, Hussein replaced Hassan with his son Abdullah as heir apparent. Hassan gracefully accepted the King&#x27;s decision on television, and congratulated his nephew Abdullah on his designation as crown prince.

On 25 January, the day after he proclaimed Abdullah as crown prince, Hussein returned abruptly to the United States, after experiencing feversa sign of recurrent lymphoma. On Tuesday 2 February, the king received a bone marrow transplant, which failed. It was thereupon reported that Hussein had suffered internal organ failure, and was in critical condition. On 4 February, and at his request, he was flown to Jordan where he arrived in a coma. Fighter jets from several countries flew with his plane as it passed over their territories, including the United States, Britain, and Israel. Hussein arrived at the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman where it was raining heavily, yet thousands flocked from all over Jordan and gathered at the main entrance. The crowds chanted his name, some weeping, others holding his pictures. At 11:43 on 7 February, Hussein was pronounced dead.

Hussein&#x27;s flag-draped coffin, accompanied by honor guard troops wearing Keffiyeh, was taken on a 90-minute procession through the streets of the capital city of Amman. An estimated 800,000 Jordanians braved chilly winds to bid their leader farewell. Riot police were stationed along the nine-mile-long route to try to hold back the crowds who scrambled for a glimpse of the coffin.

The UN General Assembly held an Emergency Special Session in &quot;Tribute to the Memory of His Majesty the King of Jordan&quot; on the same day. The King&#x27;s funeral was held in the Raghadan Palace. The funeral was the largest gathering of foreign leaders since 1995, and it was the first time that Syrian president Hafez al-Assad was in the same room with Israeli statesmen. Khaled Mashal was also in the same room as the Mossad leaders who had tried to assassinate him just two years earlier. Four American presidents were present: Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, and Gerald Ford. Bill Clinton said about the funeral: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen a greater outpouring of the world&#x27;s appreciation and the world&#x27;s love for a human being than I&#x27;ve seen today.&quot; Hussein was succeeded as king by his eldest son, Abdullah II.

==Legacy==
===Image===
Hussein was known for his openness and compassion, and he is today popularly remembered in Jordan as &quot;the Humane King&quot; (Arabic: &quot;Al-Malik Al-Insan&quot;).

Hussein&#x27;s biographer Avi Shlaim has stated that the assassination of his grandfather King AbdullahI in Jerusalem was the most formative event in his life, as he had witnessed the event personally at the age of 15. Two years later, the 17-year-old schoolboy would become King. Hussein inherited the throne to a young Kingdom, whose neighbors questioned its legitimacy, along with the Jordanian-controlled West Bank. From an early age he had to shoulder a heavy responsibility. The Kingdom had few natural resources, and a large Palestinian refugee population. He was able to gain his country considerable political weight on a global scale despite its limited potential. In 1980, an Israeli intelligence report described Hussein to be &quot;a man trapped on a bridge burning at both ends, with crocodiles in the river beneath him.&quot; Hussein was able to survive through four turbulent decades of the Arab-Israel conflict and the Cold War, successfully balancing pressures from Arab nationalists, Soviet Union, Western countries and Israel. 

Hussein considered the Palestinian issue to be the overriding national security issue, even after Jordan lost the West Bank in 1967 and after it renounced claims to it in 1988. Initially, Hussein attempted to unite both banks of the Jordan River as one people, but with the formation of the PLO in the 1960s, it became difficult to maintain such a policy. He was relentless in pursuit of peace, viewing that the only way to solve the conflict was by peaceful means, excluding his decision to join the war in 1967. The decision cost him half his kingdom and his grandfather&#x27;s legacy. After the war he emerged as an advocate for Palestinian statehood. After renouncing ties to the West Bank in 1988, he remained committed to solving the conflict. His 58 secret meetings held with Israeli representatives since 1963 culminated in the signing of the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994, which he considered to be his &quot;crowning achievement.&quot;

Hussein&#x27;s policy of co-opting the opposition was his most revered. He was the region&#x27;s longest reigning leader, even though he was subject to dozens of assassination attempts and plots to overthrow him. He was known to pardon political opponents and dissidents, including those who had attempted to assassinate him. He entrusted some of them with senior posts in the government. On one occasion before his death, he gave his fiercest critic a ride home from prison after having ordered his release. He was described as being a &quot;benign authoritarian.&quot;

During his 46-year-reign, Hussein, who was seen as a charismatic, courageous, and humble leader, became widely known among Jordanians as the &quot;builder king.&quot; He turned the Kingdom from a backwater divided polity into a reasonably stable well-governed modern state. By 1999 90% of Jordanians had been born during Hussein&#x27;s reign. From the very start, Hussein concentrated on building an economic and industrial infrastructure to stimulate the economy and raise the standard of living. During the 1960s, Jordan&#x27;s main industriesincluding phosphate, potash and cementwere developed, and the very first network of highways was built throughout the kingdom. Social indicators reflect King Hussein&#x27;s successes. Whereas in 1950 water, sanitation, and electricity were available to only 10% of Jordanians, at the end of his rule these had reached 99% of the population. In 1960 only 33% of Jordanians were literate; by 1996 this number had climbed to 85.5%. In 1961 the average Jordanian consumed a daily intake of 2,198 calories; by 1992 this figure had increased by 37.5% to reach 3,022 calories. UNICEF statistics show that between 1981 and 1991, Jordan had achieved the world&#x27;s fastest annual rate of decline in infant mortalityfrom 70 deaths per 1,000 births in 1981 to 37 per 1,000 in 1991, a drop of over 47%.

Hussein established the Al-Amal medical center in 1997, a clinic specializing in cancer treatment in Jordan. Renamed in 2002 to the King Hussein Cancer Center in honor of the late King, the center is a leading medical facility in the region, treating around 4,000 patients each year.

===Criticism===
The King disliked paperwork, and had no solid view for the economy. He was dubbed the &quot;fundraiser-in-chief&quot;: throughout his reign he managed to obtain foreign aid from different sources, leaving a legacy of a foreign aid-dependent Jordan. He obtained British aid in the early 1950s, American aid from 1957 onwards, Gulf aid in the 1960s and 1970s, Arab League and Iraqi aid in the early 1980s, and, after formalizing peace with Israel, American aid in the 1990s.

He was also seen as too lenient toward some ministers who were alleged to be corrupt. After establishing peace with Israel in 1994 he faced mounting opposition to the deal, with opponents concentrating their criticism on him. The King reacted by introducing restrictions on freedom of speech, and changing the parliamentary electoral law into the one-man, one-vote system in a bid to increase representation of independent regime loyalists and tribal groups at the expense of Islamist and partisan candidates. The moves impeded Jordan&#x27;s path towards democracy that had started in 1956 and resumed in 1989.

In 1977, Bob Woodward of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that King Hussein received funds from the CIA for 20 years. This money was used by the King to establish an intelligence service but was nevertheless criticized for being handled away from the government&#x27;s supervision.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===

King Hussein was less than seventeen years old, and unmarried, when he came to the throne of Jordan in 1952. He married four times. He had twelve acknowledged children, and one alleged illegitimate child. His wives and children were:

They separated in 1956 and were divorced in 1957, at which time Princess Dina became known as Her Royal Highness Princess Dina Abdul-Hamid of Jordan. She became an Egyptian citizen in 1963, and in October 1970, married Lieut-Colonel Asad Sulayman Abd al-Qadir, alias Salah Ta&#x27;amari, a Palestinian guerrilla commando who became a high-ranking official in the Palestine Liberation Organization.

** Princess Raiyah bint Hussein (born in 1986). Married to Faris Ned Donovan.

From an affair with the American Jewish actress Susan Cabot, Hussein allegedly had an illegitimate son, Timothy, in 1964. Susan and Timothy were supported for many years out of the Jordanian royal privy purse. In 1986, Timothy killed his mother. He served a prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter and died in 2003.

===Interests===
Hussein was an enthusiastic ham radio operator and an Honorary Member of The Radio Society of Harrow and a life member of the American Radio Relay League. He was popular in the amateur radio community and insisted that fellow operators refer to him without his title. His call sign was JY1, which inspired the name for Jordan&#x27;s first cube-sat satellite, the JY1-SAT, which was launched in 2018.

Hussein was a trained pilot, flying both airplanes and helicopters as a hobby. In a 1999 interview Henry Kissinger described being flown by Hussein, saying that &quot;...he was a daring pilot, and he would be zooming along at treetop level, and my wife, in order to be politely insistent would say, &#x27;You know I didn&#x27;t know helicopters could fly so low.&#x27; &#x27;Oh!&#x27; said the King, &#x27;They can fly lower!&#x27; and went below tree top level just skimming along on the ground. That really aged me rapidly.&quot;

Hussein was also an avid fan of motorcycles. The cover of the paperback version of Queen Noor&#x27;s book &quot;Leap of Faith: Memoirs of an Unexpected Life&quot; features a photo of the King and Queen riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. The King was also a fan of race-car driving, water sports, skiing, and tennis.

==Military ranks==
King Hussein I bin Talal I held the following ranks:
** Admiral of the Fleet, Royal Jordanian Navy.
** Field Marshal, Royal Jordanian Army.
** Marshal of the Air Force, Royal Jordanian Air Force.
** Honorary Field Marshal of the Egyptian Army – 21 February 1955.
** Honorary Air Chief Marshal of the Royal Air Force – 19 July 1966
