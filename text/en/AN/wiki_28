<text>Sir Thomas Dalyell, 11th Baronet ( ; 9 August 1932 – 26 January 2017), known as Tam Dalyell, was a Scottish politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Linlithgow (formerly West Lothian) from 1962 to 2005. A member of the Labour Party, he was best known for formulating what came to be known as the &quot;West Lothian question&quot;, on whether non-English MPs should be able to vote upon English-only matters after political devolution. He was also known for his anti-war views, opposing the Falklands War, the Gulf War, the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War.

==Early life and career==

Dalyell was born in Edinburgh, and raised in the family home of his mother Eleanor Dalyell, the Binns, near Linlithgow, West Lothian; his father Gordon Loch CIE (1887–1953) was a colonial civil servant and a scion of the Loch family. Highland Clearances facilitator James Loch (1780–1855) was an ancestral uncle. Loch (and his son) took his wife&#x27;s surname in 1938, and through his mother Dalyell inherited the baronetcy of Dalyell, but he never used the title.

Dalyell was educated at the Edinburgh Academy and Eton College. He did his national service with the Royal Scots Greys from 1950 to 1952, as an ordinary trooper, after failing his officer training. He then went to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, to study mathematics, but switched to history. He became chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association and vice-president of the Cambridge Union Society. Cambridge economist Joan Robinson encouraged him to stay for a year after completing his history degree to take an additional degree in economics, which he did and later described as &quot;the hardest work I ever did, much harder than being a PPS&quot;. He then trained as a teacher at Moray House College in Edinburgh and taught at Bo&#x27;ness Academy for three years, and was Director of Studies on the ship school &quot;Dunera&quot; from 1961 to 1962.

In 1969 Dalyell became a columnist for &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine, contributing &quot;Westminster Scene&quot; (later &quot;Westminster Diary&quot;) until his retirement in 2005. This provided &quot;a conduit for researchers to speak to Parliament and &quot;vice versa&quot;&quot;, covering many subjects of public concern including industrial diseases, data protection, chemical weapons and the environment.

==Political career==

Having been educated by left-wing economists at Cambridge, Dalyell said that he became a socialist because of the level of unemployment in Scotland. He joined the Labour Party in 1956, following the Suez Crisis. After being unsuccessful as a parliamentary candidate for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles in 1959, he became a Member of Parliament in June 1962, when he defeated William Wolfe of the Scottish National Party in a hard-fought by-election for West Lothian. From 1983 onwards, he represented Linlithgow (when the new town of Livingston formed its own constituency) and easily retained the seat. He became Father of the House after the 2001 general election, when Former Prime Minister Edward Heath retired from the House of Commons. He was a nominated Member of the European Parliament from 1975 to 1979, and a member of the Labour National Executive from 1986 to 1987 representing the Campaign group.

Dalyell&#x27;s independent stance in Parliament ensured his isolation from significant committees and jobs. His early career was promising and he became parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to Richard Crossman. He annoyed a number of ministers and was heavily censured by the Privileges Committee for a leak about the biological weapons research establishment, Porton Down, to the newspapers (though he said that he thought the draft minutes of the Select Committee on Science and Technology were in the public domain). When Labour were defeated in 1970, his chances of senior office were effectively over. He was opposed to Scottish devolution and was the first to come up with the &quot;West Lothian question&quot;, although it was actually named by Conservative MP Enoch Powell. He continued to argue his own causes: in 1978–79, he voted against his own government over 100 times, despite a three-line whip.

In the 1990s, Dalyell asked the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, to grant diplomatic immunity to Lester Coleman, a co-author of &quot;Trail of the Octopus&quot;, so that he could give evidence in the Lockerbie bombing trial in Scotland; the US Government had indictments against Coleman, accusing him of passport fraud and perjury. Allan Stewart, a former Scottish Office minister and Conservative MP for Eastwood, also said that Coleman should be granted immunity so he could testify in Scotland. The Lord Advocate rejected Dalyell&#x27;s plea, saying that the Home Office and the English courts had jurisdiction over the demand of the US government&#x27;s extradition demand regarding Coleman, and that the Crown Office and the Scottish Office had no authority over the case. Dalyell later said, &quot;I had contact with Les Coleman 10 years ago. In my opinion, though he has a chequered history, I take him seriously.&quot;

Dalyell was vocal in his disapproval of actions he deemed imperialistic. Beginning with his opposition to Britain becoming involved in the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation in 1965, he contested almost every British military intervention, arguing against Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Aden Emergency, the Falklands War (especially the sinking of the &quot;General Belgrano&quot;), the Gulf War (where he declared Kuwait to be &quot;the 19th bloody state of Iraq&quot;), the Kosovo War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. &quot;I will resist a war with every sinew in my body&quot;, he said. Dalyell was also a supporter of the Chagossians in their campaign to return to Diego Garcia after being expelled in 1968. When invited by a television journalist to rank Tony Blair among the eight Prime Ministers he had observed as a parliamentarian, he cited Blair&#x27;s policies in Kosovo and Iraq as reasons for placing his party leader at the bottom of the list. He was also a strong presence in Parliament concerning Libya and led no fewer than 17 adjournment debates on the Lockerbie bombing, in which he repeatedly demanded answers by the Government to the reports of Hans Köchler, United Nations observer at the Lockerbie trial.

In February 2003, he became the first Father of the House to be ordered to leave the chamber, after asking questions about the government&#x27;s &quot;dossier&quot; on weapons in Iraq. Following his outspoken opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and criticism of the Government, Downing Street suggested that he might face withdrawal of the Labour whip. In May, the American magazine &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; reported Dalyell indirectly as having said that Prime Minister Tony Blair was unduly influenced by a &quot;cabal of Jewish advisers&quot;. He specifically named Lord Levy, who was Blair&#x27;s official representative in the Middle East, and Labour politicians Peter Mandelson (whose father was Jewish) and Jack Straw (whose great-grandfather was Jewish). Mandelson said that &quot;apart from the fact that I am not actually Jewish, I wear my father&#x27;s parentage with pride&quot;. Dalyell denied accusations that the remarks were anti-Semitic. In March 2003, regarding the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Dalyell accused Blair of being a war criminal. He stated that &quot;since Mr Blair is going ahead with his support for a US attack without unambiguous UN authorisation, he should be branded as a war criminal and sent to The Hague&quot;.

On 7 March 2003, Dalyell was elected as Rector of the University of Edinburgh. After a three-year term, he was succeeded in 2006 by Mark Ballard. It was announced on 13 January 2004 that Dalyell would not seek re-election as an MP at the next general election, and he left the House of Commons in April 2005 after 43 years as a Member of Parliament. He had been Scotland&#x27;s longest-serving MP since the resignation of Bruce Millan in 1988. He was succeeded as Father of the House by Alan Williams. In 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Dalyell had submitted an expenses claim for £18,000 for three bookcases just two months before his retirement from the House of Commons. Dalyell claimed that this was a legitimate expense to which he was entitled; the House of Commons&#x27; Fees Office released £7,800.

Dalyell was given an honorary doctorate by Heriot-Watt University in 2011.

==Personal life and death==
Dalyell married Kathleen Wheatley, a teacher, on 26 December 1963; she was the elder daughter of John Wheatley, Lord Advocate and Labour MP for East Edinburgh. They have a son Gordon Wheatley Dalyell, and a daughter Moira, both of whom are lawyers. In his retirement, and for some years previously, he contributed obituaries to &quot;The Independent&quot;. In 2011 he published his autobiography, &quot;The Importance of Being Awkward&quot;. The dedication is &quot;To the men and women of West Lothian – Labour, SNP, Conservative, Liberal, Communist – who, whatever their political opinions, were kind to me in all sorts of ways over 43 years as their representative in the House of Commons.&quot;

Dalyell died at the House of the Binns on 26 January 2017, at the age of 84, following a brief, undisclosed illness.

<text>A serial port is a serial communication interface through which information transfers in or out sequentially one bit at a time. This is in contrast to a parallel port, which communicates multiple bits simultaneously in parallel. Throughout most of the history of personal computers, data has been transferred through serial ports to devices such as modems, terminals, various peripherals, and directly between computers.

While interfaces such as Ethernet, FireWire, and USB also send data as a serial stream, the term &quot;serial port&quot; usually denotes hardware compliant with RS-232 or a related standard, such as RS-485 or RS-422.

Modern consumer personal computers (PCs) have largely replaced serial ports with higher-speed standards, primarily USB. However, serial ports are still frequently used in applications demanding simple, low-speed interfaces, such as industrial automation systems, scientific instruments, point of sale systems and some industrial and consumer products.

Server computers may use a serial port as a control console for diagnostics, while networking hardware (such as routers and switches) commonly use serial console ports for configuration, diagnostics, and emergency maintenance access. To interface with these and other devices, USB-to-serial converters can quickly and easily add a serial port to a modern PC.

==Hardware==
Modern devices use an integrated circuit called a UART to implement a serial port. This IC converts characters to and from asynchronous serial form, implementing the timing and framing of data specified by the serial protocol in hardware. The IBM PC implements its serial ports, when present, with one or more UARTs.

Very low-cost systems, such as some early home computers, would instead use the CPU to send the data through an output pin, using the bit banging technique. These early home computers often had proprietary serial ports with pinouts and voltage levels incompatible with RS-232.

Before large-scale integration (LSI) made UARTs common, serial ports were commonly used in mainframes and minicomputers, which would have multiple small-scale integrated circuits to implement shift registers, logic gates, counters, and all the other logic needed. As PCs evolved serial ports were included in the Super I/O chip and then in the chipset.

===DTE and DCE===
The individual signals on a serial port are unidirectional and when connecting two devices, the outputs of one device must be connected to the inputs of the other. Devices are divided into two categories: &quot;data terminal equipment&quot; (DTE) and &quot;data circuit-terminating equipment&quot; (DCE). A line that is an output on a DTE device is an input on a DCE device and vice versa, so a DCE device can be connected to a DTE device with a straight wired cable, in which each pin on one end goes to the same numbered pin on the other end.

Conventionally, computers and terminals are DTE, while peripherals such as modems are DCE. If it is necessary to connect two DTE (or DCE) devices together, a cable with reversed TX and RX lines, known as a cross-over, roll-over or null modem cable must be used.

===Gender===
Generally, serial port connectors are gendered, only allowing connectors to mate with a connector of the opposite gender. With D-subminiature connectors, the male connectors have protruding pins and female connectors have corresponding round sockets. Either type of connector can be mounted on equipment or a panel; or terminate a cable.

Connectors mounted on DTE are likely to be male, and those mounted on DCE are likely to be female (with the cable connectors being the opposite). However, this is far from universal; for instance, most serial printers have a female DB25 connector, but they are DTEs. In this circumstance, the appropriately gendered connectors on the cable or a gender changer can be used to correct the mismatch.

===Connectors===
The only connector specified in the original RS-232 standard was the 25-pin D-subminiature, however, many other connectors have been used to save money or save on physical space, among other reasons. In particular, since many devices do not use all of the 20 signals that are defined by the standard, connectors with fewer pins are often used. While specific examples follow, countless other connectors have been used for RS-232 connections.

The 9-pin DE-9 connector has been used by most IBM-compatible PCs since the Serial/Parallel Adapter option for the PC-AT, where the 9-pin connector allowed a serial and parallel port to fit on the same card. This connector has been standardized for RS-232 as TIA-574.

Some miniaturized electronics, particularly graphing calculators and hand-held amateur and two-way radio equipment, have serial ports using a phone connector, usually the smaller 2.5 or 3.5 mm connectors and the most basic 3-wire interface—transmit, receive and ground.

8P8C connectors are also used in many devices. The EIA/TIA-561 standard defines a pinout using this connector, while the rollover cable (or Yost standard) is commonly used on Unix computers and network devices, such as equipment from Cisco Systems.

Many models of Macintosh favor the related RS-422 standard, mostly using circular mini-DIN connectors. The Macintosh included a standard set of two ports for connection to a printer and a modem, but some PowerBook laptops had only one combined port to save space.

10P10C connectors can be found on some devices.

Another common connector is a pin header common on motherboards and add-in cards which is usually converted via a ribbon cable to the more standard 9-pin DE-9 connector (and frequently mounted on a free slot plate or other part of the housing).

===Pinouts===
The following table lists commonly used RS-232 signals and pin assignments:

&quot;Signal Ground&quot; is a common return for the other connections; it appears on two pins in the Yost standard but is the same signal. The DB-25 connector includes a second &quot;Protective Ground&quot; on pin 1, which is intended to be connected by each device to its own frame ground or similar. Connecting Protective Ground to Signal Ground is a common practice but not recommended.

Note that EIA/TIA 561 combines DSR and RI, and the Yost standard combines DSR and DCD.

===Hardware abstraction===
Operating systems usually create symbolic names for the serial ports of a computer, rather than requiring programs to refer to them by hardware address.

Unix-like operating systems usually label the serial port devices . &quot;TTY&quot; is a common trademark-free abbreviation for &quot;teletype&quot;, a device commonly attached to early computers&#x27; serial ports, and represents a string identifying the specific port; the syntax of that string depends on the operating system and the device. On Linux, 8250/16550 UART hardware serial ports are named , USB adapters appear as and various types of virtual serial ports do not necessarily have names starting with .

The DOS and Windows environments refer to serial ports as COM ports: COM1, COM2..etc.

==Common applications for serial ports==
This list includes some of the more common devices that are connected to the serial port on a PC. Some of these such as modems and serial mice are falling into disuse while others are readily available. Serial ports are very common on most types of microcontroller, where they can be used to communicate with a PC or other serial devices.
* Dial-up modems
* Configuration and management of networking equipment such as routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers
* GPS receivers (typically NMEA 0183 at )
* Bar code scanners and other point of sale devices
* LED and LCD text displays
* Satellite phones, low-speed satellite modems and other satellite-based transceiver devices
* Flat-panel displays to control screen functions by external computer, other AV components or remotes
* Test and measuring equipment such as digital multimeters and weighing systems
* Updating firmware on various consumer devices
* CNC controllers
* Uninterruptible power supply management and status reporting
* Stenography or Stenotype machines

* Console or debugger interface to microprocessor development or evaluation boards
* Industrial field buses
* Printers
* Computer terminal, teletype
* Networking (Macintosh AppleTalk using RS-422 at )
* Serial mouse
Since the control signals for a serial port can be driven by any digital signal, some applications used the control lines of a serial port to monitor external devices, without exchanging serial data. A common commercial application of this principle was for some models of uninterruptible power supply which used the control lines to signal loss of power, low battery, and other status information. At least some Morse code training software used a code key connected to the serial port to simulate actual code use; the status bits of the serial port could be sampled very rapidly and at predictable times, making it possible for the software to decipher Morse code. 

Serial computer mice may draw their operating power from the received data or control signals.

==Settings==
Serial standards provide for many different operating speeds as well as adjustments to the protocol to account for different operating conditions. The most well-known options are speed, number of data bits per character, parity, and number of stop bits per character.

In modern serial ports using a UART integrated circuit, all these settings can be software-controlled. Hardware from the 1980s and earlier may require setting switches or jumpers on a circuit board.

The configuration for serial ports designed to be connected to a PC has become a de facto standard, usually stated as 9600/8-N-1.

===Speed===
Serial ports use two-level (binary) signaling, so the data rate in bits per second is equal to the symbol rate in baud. The total speed includes bits for framing (stop bits, parity, etc.) and so the effective data rate is lower than the bit transmission rate. For example, with 8-N-1 character framing, only 80% of the bits are available for data; for every eight bits of data, two more framing bits are sent.

A standard series of rates is based on multiples of the rates for electromechanical teleprinters; some serial ports allow many arbitrary rates to be selected, but the speeds on both sides of the connection must match for data to be received correctly. Bit rates commonly supported include 75, 110, 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 and 115200 bit/s. Many of these standard modem baud rates are multiples of either 1.2 kbps (e.g., 19200, 38400, 76800) or 0.9 kbps (e.g., 57600, 115200). Crystal oscillators with a frequency of 1.843200 MHz are sold specifically for this purpose. This is 16 times the fastest bit rate, and the serial port circuit can easily divide this down to lower frequencies as required.

The capability to set a bit rate does not imply that a working connection will result. Not all bit rates are possible with all serial ports. Some special-purpose protocols such as MIDI for musical instrument control, use serial data rates other than the teleprinter standards. Some serial port implementations can automatically choose a bit rate by observing what a connected device is sending and synchronizing to it.

===Data bits===
The number of data bits in each character can be 5 (for Baudot code), 6 (rarely used), 7 (for true ASCII), 8 (for most kinds of data, as this size matches the size of a byte), or 9 (rarely used). 8 data bits are almost universally used in newer applications. 5 or 7 bits generally only make sense with older equipment such as teleprinters.

Most serial communications designs send the data bits within each byte least significant bit first. Also possible, but rarely used, is most significant bit first; this was used, for example, by the IBM 2741 printing terminal. The order of bits is not usually configurable within the serial port interface but is defined by the host system. To communicate with systems that require a different bit ordering than the local default, local software can re-order the bits within each byte just before sending and just after receiving.

===Parity===
&quot;Parity&quot; is a method of detecting errors in transmission. When parity is used with a serial port, an extra data bit is sent with each data character, arranged so that the number of 1 bits in each character, including the parity bit, is always odd or always even. If a byte is received with the wrong number of 1s, then it must have been corrupted. Correct parity does not necessarily indicate absence of corruption as a corrupted transmission with an even number of errors will pass the parity check. A single parity bit does not allow implementation of error correction on each character, and communication protocols working over serial data links will typically have higher-level mechanisms to ensure data validity and request retransmission of data that has been incorrectly received.

The parity bit in each character can be set to one of the following:

* None (N) means that no parity bit is sent and the transmission is shortened.
* Odd (O) means that the parity bit is set so that the number of 1 bits is odd.
* Even (E) means that the parity bit is set so that the number of 1 bits is even.
* Mark (M) parity means that the parity bit is always set to the mark signal condition (1 bit value).
* Space (S) parity always sends the parity bit in the space signal condition (0 bit value).

Aside from uncommon applications that use the last bit (usually the 9th) for some form of addressing or special signaling, mark or space parity is uncommon, as it adds no error detection information.

Odd parity is more useful than even parity since it ensures that at least one state transition occurs in each character, which makes it more reliable at detecting errors like those that could be caused by serial port speed mismatches. The most common parity setting, however, is &quot;none&quot;, with error detection handled by a communication protocol.

To allow detection of messages damaged by line noise, electromechanical teleprinters were arranged to print a special character when received data contained a parity error.

===Stop bits===
Stop bits sent at the end of every character allow the receiving signal hardware to detect the end of a character and to resynchronize with the character stream. Electronic devices usually use one stop bit. If slow electromechanical teleprinters are used, one-and-one-half or two stop bits may be required.

===Conventional notation===

The data/parity/stop (D/P/S) conventional notation specifies the framing of a serial connection. The most common configuration for the personal computing devices is 8-N-1 (also spelled as 8N1, 8-None-1), in which there is one start bit, eight (&quot;8&quot;) data bits, no (&quot;N&quot;) parity bit, and one (&quot;1&quot;) stop bit. In this notation, the parity bit is not included into the count of the data bits. For example, 7/E/1 (7E1) means that an even parity bit is added to the 7 data bits for a total of 8 bits between the start and stop bits.

The abbreviation is usually given together with the line speed in bits per second, as in &quot;9600–8-N-1&quot;. The speed (or baud rate) includes bits for framing (stop bits, parity, etc.), thus the effective data rate is lower than the baud rate. For 8-N-1 encoding, only 80% of the bits are available for data (for every eight bits of data, ten bits are sent over the serial link — one start bit, the eight data bits, and the one stop bit).

===Flow control===
Flow control is used in circumstances where a transmitter might be able to send data faster than the receiver is able to process it. To cope with this, serial lines often incorporate a handshaking method. There are &quot;hardware&quot; and &quot;software&quot; handshaking methods.

Hardware handshaking is done with extra signals, often the RS-232 RTS/CTS or DTR/DSR signal circuits. RTS and CTS are used to control data flow, signaling, for instance, when a buffer is almost full. Per the RS-232 standard and its successors, DTR and DSR are used to signal that equipment is present and powered up so are usually asserted at all times. However, non-standard implementations exist, for example, printers that use DTR as flow control.

Software handshaking is done for example with ASCII control characters XON/XOFF to control the flow of data. The XON and XOFF characters are sent by the receiver to the sender to control when the sender will send data, that is, these characters go in the opposite direction to the data being sent. The system starts in the &quot;sending allowed&quot; state. When the receiver&#x27;s buffers approach capacity, the receiver sends the XOFF character to tell the sender to stop sending data. Later, after the receiver has emptied its buffers, it sends an XON character to tell the sender to resume transmission. It is an example of in-band signaling, where control information is sent over the same channel as its data.
The advantage of hardware handshaking is that it can be extremely fast, it works independently of imposed meaning such as ASCII on the transferred data and it is stateless. Its disadvantage is that it requires more hardware and cabling, and both ends of the connection must support the hardware handshaking protocol used.
The advantage of software handshaking is that it can be done with absent or incompatible hardware handshaking circuits and cabling. The disadvantage, common to all in-band control signaling, is that it introduces complexities in ensuring that control messages get through even when data messages are blocked, and data can never be mistaken for control signals. The former is normally dealt with by the operating system or device driver; the latter normally by ensuring that control codes are escaped (such as in the Kermit protocol) or omitted by design (such as in ANSI terminal control).
If no handshaking is employed, an overrun receiver might simply fail to receive data from the transmitter. Approaches for preventing this include reducing the speed of the connection so that the receiver can always keep up, increasing the size of buffers so it can keep up averaged over a longer time, using delays after time-consuming operations (e.g. in termcap) or employing a mechanism to resend data which has not been received correctly (e.g. TCP).

<text>GNOME Files, formerly and internally known as Nautilus, is the official file manager for the GNOME desktop. GNOME Files, same as Nautilus, is a free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

==History==
Nautilus, the predecessor of the GNOME Files, was originally developed by Eazel and Andy Hertzfeld (founder of Eazel and a former Apple engineer) in 1999. The name &quot;Nautilus&quot; was a play on words, evoking the shell of a nautilus to represent an operating system shell.

At the beginning of 2000, Richard Hestgray published the first screenshots of &quot;Nautilus&quot; codice_1 preview release:

In December 2000, article under the title &quot;«Nautilus, GNOME’s new file manager»&quot; was published in the Linux Magazine.

Nautilus replaced Midnight Commander in GNOME 1.4 (2001) and has been the default file manager from version 2.0 onwards. Nautilus was the flagship product of the now-defunct Eazel Inc.

GNOME Files was first released in 2001 and development has continued ever since. The following is a brief timeline of its development history:
* Version 1.0 was released on March 13, 2001, and incorporated into GNOME 1.4.
* Version 2.0 was a port to GTK+ 2.0.
* Version 2.2 included changes to make it more compliant with User Interface Guidelines.
* Version 2.4 switched the desktop folder to codice_2 (the ~ represents the user&#x27;s &quot;Home&quot; folder) to be compliant with freedesktop.org standards.
* In the version included with GNOME 2.6, Nautilus switched to a spatial interface. Several Linux distributions have made &quot;browser&quot; mode the default. The &quot;classic&quot; interface is still available:
** By a filing cabinet shaped icon.
** By an option in the &quot;Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Behavior&quot; menu in Nautilus.
** In a folder&#x27;s context menu.
** By using the &quot;--browser&quot; switch when started by a command via a launcher or shell. 
* GNOME 2.14 introduced a version of Nautilus with improved searching, integrated optional Beagle support and the ability to save searches as virtual folders.
* With the release of GNOME 2.22, Nautilus was ported to the newly introduced GVfs, the replacement virtual file system for the aging GnomeVFS.
* The 2.24 stable release of Nautilus adds some new features, mainly tabbed browsing and better tab completion.
* With GNOME 2.30, Nautilus reverted from a spatial interface to a browser navigational model by default.
* The 2.32 release introduced a dialog for handling conflicts when performing copy or move operations, transparency icon effect when cutting files into folder and enhanced the Wastebucket with Restore files. Besides, this is the last version that is based on GTK2 before the move to GNOME 3.0 with GTK3. Nautilus 2.x was forked to Caja, as well as MATE Desktop from Gnome 2.x after Gnome 3.0. Today both Mate and Caja are based on GTK3.
* GNOME 3.0 completely revamped the UX of Nautilus with focus on sidebar and icons. Additionally, the Connect to Server dialog is also enhanced. Nautilus was ported to GTK3.
* Version 3.4 added Undo functionality.
* Version 3.6 introduced a revamped UI design, symbolic sidebar icon, new search feature, removal of many features such as setting window background, emblems, split pane mode, spatial mode, scripts, compact view mode and tree view. Nautilus&#x27; application name was renamed to Files, Though it is still called Nautilus internally in some distributions. These major changes led to a lot of criticism, and various vendors such as Linux Mint decided to fork version 3.4.
* Version 3.8 included a new option to view files and folders as a tree, a new Connect to Server item in the sidebar and incremental loading of search results. 
* Version 3.10 introduced a slightly revamped UI design in which titlebars and toolbars were merged into a single element called header bars.
* Version 3.18 introduced integration with Google Drive and GOA (gnome-online-accounts) settings.

==Features==

Bookmarks, window backgrounds, notes, and add-on scripts are all implemented, and the user has the choice between icon, list, or compact list views. In browser mode, Nautilus keeps a history of visited folders, similar to web browsers, permitting quick revisiting of folders.

Nautilus can display previews of files in their icons, be they text files, images, sound or video files via thumbnailers such as Totem. Audio files are previewed (played back over GStreamer) when the pointer is hovering over them.

In earlier versions, Nautilus included original vectorized icons designed by Susan Kare.

===File system abstraction===
GNOME Files relies on a file system abstraction layer (provided by GVfs) to browse local and remote file systems, including but not limited to FTP sites, Windows SMB shares, OBEX protocol (often implemented on cellphones), files transferred over shell protocol, HTTP and WebDAV and SFTP servers.

Using the GIO library, Nautilus tracks modification of local files in real time, eliminating the need to refresh the display. GIO internally supports Gamin and FAM, Linux&#x27;s inotify and Solaris&#x27; File Events Notification system.

===File indexing and file search framework===
GNOME Files relies on Tracker (formerly named &quot;MetaTracker&quot;) to index files and is hence able to provide fast file search results.

===Batch renaming===
Batch renaming was introduced with GNOME Files version 3.22 (2016).

===Archive handling===
GNOME Files version 3.22 adds native, integrated file compression and decompression. By default, handling of archive files (e.g. .tar.gz) was handed off to File Roller (or another tool). Users now benefit from a progress bar, undo support, and an archive creation wizard.

The new &quot;extract on open&quot; behavior, which automatically extracts an archive file by double clicking it, can be disabled in the preferences.

===MIME types===
MIME types (also called &quot;media type&quot; or &quot;content type&quot;) are standardized by the IANA, then the freedesktop.org project takes care that the implementation works across all free software desktops. codice_3 is the provided library. At this time, at least GNOME, KDE, Xfce and ROX use this database.

<doc id="77363" wikidata="Q130890" url="?curid=77363" title="Oedipus">
<text>Oedipus (, ; &quot;swollen foot&quot;) was a mythical Greek king of Thebes. A tragic hero in Greek mythology, Oedipus fulfilled a prophecy that he would end up killing his father and marrying his mother, thereby bringing disaster to his city and family.

The story of Oedipus is the subject of Sophocles&#x27; tragedy &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, which is followed in the narrative sequence by &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot; and then &quot;Antigone&quot;. Together, these plays make up Sophocles&#x27; three Theban plays. Oedipus represents two enduring themes of Greek myth and drama: the flawed nature of humanity and an individual&#x27;s role in the course of destiny in a harsh universe.

In the best-known version of the myth, Oedipus was born to King Laius and Queen Jocasta of Thebes. Laius wished to thwart the prophecy, so he sent a shepherd-servant to leave Oedipus to die on a mountainside. However, the shepherd took pity on the baby and passed him to another shepherd who gave Oedipus to King Polybus and Queen Merope to raise as their own. Oedipus learned from the oracle at Delphi of the prophecy that he would end up killing his father and marrying his mother but, unaware of his true parentage, believed he was fated to murder Polybus and marry Merope, and so he left for Thebes. On his way, he met an older man, who was (unbeknownst to him) his father, and killed him in a quarrel. Continuing on to Thebes, he found that the king of the city (Laius) had recently been killed and that the city was at the mercy of the Sphinx. Oedipus answered the monster&#x27;s riddle correctly, defeating it and winning the throne of the dead king – and the hand in marriage of the king&#x27;s widow, who was also (unbeknownst to him) his mother Jocasta.
Years later, to end a plague on Thebes, Oedipus searched to find who had killed Laius and discovered that he himself was responsible. Jocasta, upon realizing that she had married her own son, hanged herself. Oedipus then seized two pins from her dress and blinded himself with them.

The legend of Oedipus has been retold in many versions and was used by Sigmund Freud to name and give mythic precedent to the Oedipus complex.

==Basics of the myth==
Variations on the legend of Oedipus are mentioned in fragments by several ancient Greek poets including Homer, Hesiod, Pindar, Aeschylus and Euripides. However, the most popular version of the legend comes from the set of Theban plays by Sophocles: &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;, and &quot;Antigone&quot;.

Oedipus was the son of Laius and Jocasta, king and queen of Thebes. Having been childless for some time, Laius consulted the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi. The Oracle prophesied that any son born to Laius would kill him. In an attempt to prevent this prophecy&#x27;s fulfillment, when Jocasta indeed bore a son, Laius had his son&#x27;s ankles pierced and tethered together so that he could not crawl; Jocasta then gave the boy to a servant to abandon (&quot;expose&quot;) on the nearby mountain. However, rather than leave the child to die of exposure, as Laius intended, the servant passed the baby on to a shepherd from Corinth, who then gave the child to another shepherd.

The infant Oedipus was eventually adopted by Polybus and Merope, the king and queen of Corinth, as they were without children of their own. Little Oedipus was named after the swelling from the injuries to his feet and ankles (&quot;swollen foot&quot;).

After many years, Oedipus was told by a drunk that he was a &quot;bastard&quot;, meaning at that time that he was not their biological son. Oedipus confronted his parents (the king and queen of Corinth) with the news, but they denied this. Oedipus went to the same oracle in Delphi that his birth parents had consulted. The oracle informed him that he was destined to murder his father and marry his mother. In an attempt to avoid such a fate, he decided not to return home to Corinth, but to travel to Thebes, which was closer to Delphi.

On the way, Oedipus came to Davlia, where three roads crossed. There he encountered a chariot driven by his birth-father, King Laius. They fought over who had the right to go first and Oedipus killed Laius when the charioteer tried to run him over. The only witness of the king&#x27;s death was a slave who fled from a caravan of slaves also traveling on the road at the time.

Continuing his journey to Thebes, Oedipus encountered a Sphinx, who would stop all travelers to Thebes and ask them a riddle. If the travelers were unable to answer her correctly, they would be killed and eaten; if they were successful, they would be free to continue on their journey. The riddle was: &quot;What walks on four feet in the morning, two in the afternoon, and three at night?&quot;. Oedipus answered: &quot;Man: as an infant, he crawls on all fours; as an adult, he walks on two legs and; in old age, he uses a &#x27;walking&#x27; stick&quot;. Oedipus was the first to answer the riddle correctly; the Sphinx was so embarrassed that someone had solved her riddle that she killed herself by jumping off of a cliff; in some versions, however, Oedipus kills her.

Queen Jocasta&#x27;s brother, Creon, had announced that any man who could rid the city of the Sphinx would be made king of Thebes and given the recently widowed Queen Jocasta&#x27;s hand in marriage. This marriage of Oedipus to Jocasta fulfilled the rest of the prophecy. Oedipus and Jocasta had four children: sons Eteocles and Polynices (see &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;) and daughters Antigone and Ismene.

Many years later, a plague of infertility struck the city of Thebes, affecting crops, livestock, and the people. Oedipus asserted that he would end the pestilence. He sent Creon to the Oracle at Delphi, seeking guidance. When Creon returned, Oedipus learned that the murderer of King Laius must be brought to justice, and Oedipus himself cursed the killer of his wife&#x27;s late husband, saying that he would be exiled. Creon also suggested that they try to find the blind prophet Tiresias, who was widely respected. Oedipus sent for Tiresias, who warned him not to seek Laius&#x27; killer. In a heated exchange, Tiresias was provoked into exposing Oedipus himself as the killer, and the fact that Oedipus was living in shame because he did not know who his true parents were. Oedipus angrily blamed Creon for the false accusations, and the two argued. Jocasta entered and tried to calm Oedipus by telling him the story of her first-born son and his supposed death. Oedipus became nervous as he realized that he may have murdered Laius and so brought about the plague. Suddenly, a messenger arrived from Corinth with the news that King Polybus had died. Oedipus was relieved, for the prophecy could no longer be fulfilled if Polybus, whom he believed to be his birth father, was now dead.

Still, he knew that his mother was still alive and refused to attend the funeral at Corinth. To ease the tension, the messenger then said that Oedipus was, in fact, adopted. Jocasta, finally realizing that he was her son, begged him to stop his search for Laius&#x27; murderer. Oedipus misunderstood her motivation, thinking that she was ashamed of him because he might have been born of low birth. Jocasta, in great distress, went into the palace, where she hanged herself. Oedipus sought verification of the messenger&#x27;s story from the very same herdsman who was supposed to have left Oedipus to die as a baby. From the herdsman, Oedipus learned that the infant who was raised as the adopted son of Polybus and Merope, was the son of Laius and Jocasta. Thus, Oedipus finally realized that the man he had killed so many years before was his father and that he had married his mother.

Events after the revelation depend on the source. In Sophocles&#x27; plays, Oedipus went in search of Jocasta and found she had killed herself. Using the pin from a brooch he took off Jocasta&#x27;s gown, Oedipus blinded himself and was then exiled. His daughter Antigone acted as his guide as he wandered through the country, finally dying at Colonus where they had been welcomed by King Theseus of Athens. However, in Euripides&#x27; plays on the subject, Jocasta did not kill herself upon learning of Oedipus&#x27;s birth, and Oedipus was blinded by a servant of Laius. The blinding of Oedipus does not appear in sources earlier than Aeschylus. Some older sources of the myth, including Homer, state that Oedipus continued to rule Thebes after the revelations and after Jocasta&#x27;s death.

Oedipus&#x27;s two sons, Eteocles and Polynices, arranged to share the kingdom, each taking an alternating one-year reign. However, Eteocles refused to cede his throne after his year as king. Polynices brought in an army to oust Eteocles from his position and a battle ensued. At the end of the battle, the brothers killed each other, after which Jocasta&#x27;s brother, Creon, took the throne. He decided that Polynices was a &quot;traitor&quot;, and should not be given burial rites. Defying this edict, Antigone attempted to bury her brother. In Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Antigone&quot;, Creon had her buried in a rock cavern for defying him, whereupon she hanged herself. However, in Euripides&#x27; lost version of the story, it appears that Antigone survives.

==Ancient sources (5th century BC)==

Most, if not all, of our knowledge of Oedipus, comes from the 5th century BC. Though these stories principally deal with his downfall, various details still appear on how Oedipus rose to power.

King Laius of Thebes hears of a prophecy that his infant son will one day kill him. He pierces Oedipus&#x27; feet and leaves him out to die, but a shepherd finds him and carries him away. Years later, Oedipus, not knowing he was adopted, leaves home in fear of the same prophecy that he will kill his father and marry his mother. Laius journeys out to seek a solution to the Sphinx&#x27;s mysterious riddle. As prophesied, Oedipus and Laius cross paths, but they do not recognize each other. A fight ensues, and Oedipus kills Laius and most of his guards. Oedipus goes on to defeat the Sphinx by solving a riddle to become king. He marries the widowed Queen Jocasta, unaware that she is his mother. A plague falls on the people of Thebes. Upon discovering the truth, Oedipus blinds himself, and Jocasta hangs herself. After Oedipus is no longer king, Oedipus&#x27;s brother-sons kill each other.

Some differences with older stories emerge. The curse of Oedipus&#x27; sons was elaborated on retroactively to include Oedipus and his father, Laius. Oedipus now steps down from the throne instead of dying in battle. Additionally, rather than his children being by a second wife, Oedipus&#x27;s children are now by Jocasta (hence, they are his brothers as well).

===Pindar&#x27;s second &quot;Olympian Ode&quot;===

In his second &quot;Olympian Ode&quot;, Pindar writes:

=== Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot; trilogy (467 BC) ===

In 467 BC, the Athenian playwright, Aeschylus, most notably wrote a trilogy based on the myth of Oedipus, winning him the first prize at the City Dionysia. Of the plays, &quot;Laius&quot; was the first, &quot;Oedipus&quot; was second&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot; was the third play and the only one to have survived.

In &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;, Oedipus&#x27;s sons Eteocles and Polynices kill each other warring over the throne. Much like his &quot;Oresteia&quot;, the trilogy would have detailed the tribulations of a House over three successive generations. The satyr play that followed the trilogy was called &quot;The Sphinx&quot;.

===Sophocles&#x27; Theban plays===
The three surviving works of Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Theban plays&quot; consist of: &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; (also called &quot;Oedipus Tyrannus&quot; or &quot;Oedipus the King&quot;), &quot;Oedipus at Colonus,&quot; and &quot;Antigone&quot;. All three plays concern the fate of the City of Thebes, during and after the reign of King Oedipus, and have often been published under a single cover.

Originally, Sophocles had written the plays for three separate festival competitions, many years apart. Not only are the Theban plays not a true trilogy (three plays presented as a continuous narrative), they are not even an intentional series and contain some inconsistencies among them.

Sophocles also wrote other plays focused on Thebes, most notably the &quot;Epigoni&quot;, of which only fragments have survived.

====&quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;====

As Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; begins, the people of Thebes are begging the king for help, begging him to discover the cause of the plague. Oedipus stands before them and swears to find the root of their suffering and to end it. Just then, Creon returns to Thebes from a visit to the oracle. Apollo has made it known that Thebes is harboring a terrible abomination and that the plague will only be lifted when the true murderer of old King Laius is discovered and punished for his crime. Oedipus swears to do this, not realizing that he is himself the culprit. The stark truth emerges slowly over the course of the play, as Oedipus clashes with the blind seer Tiresias, who senses the truth. Oedipus remains in strict denial, though, becoming convinced that Tiresias is somehow plotting with Creon to usurp the throne.

Realization begins to slowly dawn in Scene II of the play when Jocasta mentions out of hand that Laius was slain at a place where three roads meet. This stirs something in Oedipus&#x27;s memory and he suddenly remembers the men he fought and killed one day long ago at a place where three roads met. He realizes, horrified, that he might be the man he&#x27;s seeking. One household servant survived the attack and now lives out his old age in a frontier district of Thebes. Oedipus sends immediately for the man to either confirm or deny his guilt. At the very worst, though, he expects to find himself to be the unsuspecting murderer of a man unknown to him. The truth has not yet been made clear.

The moment of epiphany comes late in the play. At the beginning of Scene III, Oedipus is still waiting for the servant to be brought into the city, when a messenger arrives from Corinth to declare that King Polybus of Corinth is dead. Oedipus, when he hears this news, feels much relieved, because he believed that Polybus was the father whom the oracle had destined him to murder, and he momentarily believes himself to have escaped fate. He tells this all to the present company, including the messenger, but the messenger knows that it is not true. He is the man who found Oedipus as a baby in the pass of Cithaeron and gave him to King Polybus to raise. He reveals, furthermore that the servant who is being brought to the city as they speak is the very same man who took Oedipus up into the mountains as a baby. Jocasta realizes now all that has happened. She begs Oedipus not to pursue the matter further. He refuses, and she withdraws into the palace as the servant is arriving. The old man arrives, and it is clear at once that he knows everything. At the behest of Oedipus, he tells it all.

Overwhelmed with the knowledge of all his crimes, Oedipus rushes into the palace where he finds his mother-wife, dead by her own hand. Ripping a brooch from her dress, Oedipus blinds himself with it. Bleeding from the eyes, he begs his uncle and brother-in-law Creon, who has just arrived on the scene, to exile him forever from Thebes. Creon agrees to this request. Oedipus begs to hold his two daughters Antigone and Ismene with his hands one more time to have their eyes full of tears and Creon out of pity sends the girls in to see Oedipus one more time.

====&quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;====

In Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;, Oedipus becomes a wanderer, pursued by Creon and his men. He finally finds refuge in the holy wilderness right outside Athens, where it is said that Theseus took care of Oedipus and his daughter, Antigone. Creon eventually catches up to Oedipus. He asks Oedipus to come back from Colonus to bless his son, Eteocles. Angry that his son did not love him enough to take care of him, he curses both Eteocles and his brother, condemning them both to kill each other in battle. Oedipus dies a peaceful death; his grave is said to be sacred to the gods.

====&quot;Antigone&quot;====

In Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Antigone&quot;, when Oedipus stepped down as king of Thebes, he gave the kingdom to his two sons, Eteocles and Polynices, both of whom agreed to alternate the throne every year. However, they showed no concern for their father, who cursed them for their negligence. After the first year, Eteocles refused to step down and Polynices attacked Thebes with his supporters (as portrayed in the &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot; by Aeschylus and the &quot;Phoenician Women&quot; by Euripides). The two brothers killed each other in battle. King Creon, who ascended to the throne of Thebes, decreed that Polynices was not to be buried. Antigone, Polynices&#x27; sister, defied the order but was caught. Creon decreed that she was to be put into a stone box in the ground, this in spite of her betrothal to his son Haemon. Antigone&#x27;s sister, Ismene, then declared she had aided Antigone and wanted the same fate, but Creon eventually declined to execute her. The gods, through the blind prophet Tiresias, expressed their disapproval of Creon&#x27;s decision, which convinced him to rescind his order, and he went to bury Polynices himself. However, Antigone had already hanged herself in her tomb, rather than suffering the slow death of being buried alive. When Creon arrived at the tomb where she had been interred, his son Haemon attacked him upon seeing the body of his deceased fiancée but failing to kill Creon he killed himself. When Creon&#x27;s wife, Eurydice, was informed of the death of Haemon, she too took her own life.

===Euripides&#x27; &quot;Phoenissae&quot;, &quot;Chrysippus&quot;, and &quot;Oedipus&quot;===

At the beginning of Euripides&#x27; &quot;Phoenissae&quot;, Jocasta recalls the story of Oedipus. Generally, the play weaves together the plots of the &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot; and &quot;Antigone&quot;. The play differs from the other tales in two major respects. First, it describes in detail why Laius and Oedipus had a feud: Laius ordered Oedipus out of the road so his chariot could pass, but proud Oedipus refused to move. Second, in the play Jocasta has not killed herself at the discovery of her incest – otherwise, she could not play the prologue, for fathomable reasons – nor has Oedipus fled into exile, but they have stayed in Thebes only to delay their doom until the fatal duel of their sons/brothers/nephews Eteocles and Polynices: Jocasta commits suicide over the two men&#x27;s dead bodies, and Antigone follows Oedipus into exile.

In &quot;Chrysippus&quot;, Euripides develops backstory on the curse: Laius&#x27; sin was to have kidnapped Chrysippus, Pelops&#x27; son, in order to violate him, and this caused the gods&#x27; revenge on all his family. Laius was the tutor of Chrysippus, and raping his student was a severe violation of his position as both guest and tutor in the house of the royal family hosting him at the time. Extant vases show a fury hovering over the lecherous Laius as he abducts the rape victim. Furies avenged violations of good order in households, as can be seen most clearly in such texts as The Libation Bearers by Aeschylus.

Euripides wrote also an &quot;Oedipus&quot;, of which only a few fragments survive. The first line of the prologue recalled Laius&#x27; hubristic action of conceiving a son against Apollo&#x27;s command. At some point in the action of the play, a character engaged in a lengthy and detailed description of the Sphinx and her riddle – preserved in five fragments from Oxyrhynchus, P.Oxy. 2459 (published by Eric Gardner Turner in 1962). The tragedy also featured many moral maxims on the theme of marriage, preserved in the Anthologion of Stobaeus. The most striking lines, however, state that in this play Oedipus was blinded by Laius&#x27; attendants and that this happened before his identity as Laius&#x27; son had been discovered, therefore marking important differences with the Sophoclean treatment of the myth, which is now regarded as the &#x27;standard&#x27; version. Many attempts have been made to reconstruct the plot of the play, but none of them is more than hypothetical, because of the scanty remains that survive from its text and of the total absence of ancient descriptions or résumés – though it has been suggested that a part of Hyginus&#x27; narration of the Oedipus myth might in fact derive from Euripides&#x27; play. Some echoes of the Euripidean Oedipus have been traced also in a scene of Seneca&#x27;s Oedipus (see below), in which Oedipus himself describes to Jocasta his adventure with the Sphinx.

===Other playwrights===
At least three other 5th-century BC authors who were younger than Sophocles wrote plays about Oedipus. These include Achaeus of Eretria, Nichomachus and the elder Xenocles.

==Later additions==

The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, a Roman-era mythological handbook, includes a riddle for the Sphinx, borrowing the poetry of Hesiod:

&quot;What is that which has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?&quot;

===Later addition to Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Seven against Thebes&quot;===

Due to the popularity of Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Antigone&quot; (c. 442 BC), the ending (lines 1005–78) of &quot;Seven against Thebes&quot; was added some fifty years after Aeschylus&#x27; death. Whereas the play (and the trilogy of which it is the last play) was meant to end with somber mourning for the dead brothers, the spurious ending features a herald announcing the prohibition against burying Polynices, and Antigone&#x27;s declaration that she will defy that edict.

==Post-Classical literature==
Oedipus was a figure who was also used in the Latin literature of ancient Rome. Julius Caesar wrote a play on Oedipus, but it has not survived into modern times. Ovid included Oedipus in &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, but only as the person who defeated the Sphinx. He makes no mention of Oedipus&#x27;s troubled experiences with his father and mother. Seneca the Younger wrote his own play on the story of Oedipus in the first century AD. It differs in significant ways from the work of Sophocles.

Some scholars have argued that Seneca&#x27;s play on the myth was intended to be recited at private gatherings and not actually performed. It has however been successfully staged since the Renaissance. It was adapted by John Dryden in his very successful heroic drama &quot;Oedipus&quot;, licensed in 1678. The 1718 &quot;Oedipus&quot; was also the first play written by Voltaire. A version of Oedipus by Frank McGuinness was performed at the National Theatre in late 2008, starring Ralph Fiennes and Claire Higgins.

In the late 1960s Ola Rotimi published a novel and play, &quot;The Gods Are Not to Blame&quot;, which retell the Oedipus myth happening in the Yoruba kingdom.

In 2011, U.S. writer David Guterson published his Oedipus-inspired novel &quot;Ed King&quot;.

In folkloristics, the myth of Oedipus is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as tale type ATU 931, &quot;Oedipus&quot;.

== Family tree ==

== Oedipus complex ==
Sigmund Freud used the name &quot;the Oedipus complex&quot; to explain the origin of certain neuroses in childhood. It is defined as a male child&#x27;s unconscious desire for the exclusive love of his mother. This desire includes jealousy towards the father and the unconscious wish for that parent&#x27;s death, as well as the unconscious desire for sexual intercourse with the mother. Oedipus himself, as portrayed in the myth, did not have this neurosis – at least, not towards Jocasta, whom he only met as an adult (if anything, such feelings would have been directed at Merope – but there is no hint of that). Freud reasoned that the ancient Greek audience, which heard the story told or saw the plays based on it, did know that Oedipus was actually killing his father and marrying his mother; the story being continually told and played therefore reflected a preoccupation with the theme.

<text>Etowah County is a county located in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census the population was 103,436. Its county seat is Gadsden. Its name is from a Cherokee word meaning &quot;edible tree&quot;. In total area, it is the smallest county in Alabama, albeit one of the most densely populated.
Etowah County comprises the Gadsden Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The area was split first among neighboring counties, with most of it belonging to DeKalb and Cherokee counties. On December 7, 1866, the first postwar legislature separated and established Baine County, named for David W. Baine, a politician and Confederate military officer who died in battle in 1862. Gadsden was designated as the county seat.

Because of postwar tensions and actions of insurgents against freedmen, at the state constitutional convention in 1868, the new county was abolished, replaced on December 1, 1868, by one aligned to the same boundaries and named Etowah County, from a Cherokee-language word. The Cherokee people in northeast Alabama had been forcibly removed in the 1830s to Indian Territory (now part of Oklahoma) west of the Mississippi River.

===20th century to present===
Etowah County had issues of racial discrimination and injustice, and Jim Crow. It had one documented lynching between 1877 and 1950, which occurred in 1906. Bunk Richardson, an innocent African-American, only because he was associated with a case in which a white woman was raped and killed. The whites were angry that the governor had commuted the death sentence of one defendant in the case (who was likely also innocent of charges), after two men had already been executed for the crime.

An F4 tornado struck here on Palm Sunday March 27, 1994. It destroyed Piedmont&#x27;s Goshen United Methodist Church twelve minutes after the National Weather Service of Birmingham issued a tornado warning for northern Calhoun, southeastern Etowah, and southern Cherokee counties.

<text>Winston County is a county of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 23,540. Its county seat is Double Springs. Known as Hancock County before 1858, the county is named in honor of John A. Winston, the fifteenth Governor of Alabama.

==History==
Winston County was established under the name Hancock County on February 12, 1850, from territory that was formerly part of Walker County (a county directly to the south of Winston County). It was originally named for John Hancock, Governor of Massachusetts and famous signer of the American Declaration of Independence, with its county seat at Houston. On January 22, 1858, the county was renamed Winston County to honor Alabama Gov. John A. Winston.

During the American Civil War, Winston County gained attention for its opposition to secession, a sentiment so strong that the county is sometimes referred to as the Free State of Winston. This area had few slaves and saw little benefit to secession. The county today plays on its reputation as the &quot;Free State of Winston&quot; to attract tourists. The county&#x27;s opposition to the Confederacy is briefly mentioned in the novels &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; and &quot;Addie Pray.&quot;

In 1883, the county seat was moved from Houston to Double Springs to be near the center of the county, since Cullman County was created from the eastern part of Winston County.

The civil-rights judge Frank Minis Johnson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit was born in Delmar, in Winston County.

==Government and politics==
Unlike nearly every other county in the Deep South, and in keeping with its history during the American Civil War, Winston County has always been a bastion of support for the Republican Party, even as the Democratic Party utterly dominated Alabama state politics from the end of Reconstruction until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. For example, in four consecutive presidential elections from 1936 to 1948, Winston County was the only county in the state to vote for the Republican ticket, and one of just 2 in the Deep South to vote Republican in those elections, that county being Fannin County in Georgia. In 1932, the county backed Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt by just a single vote, even while Roosevelt carried the state as a whole overwhelmingly. And in 1912, Winston County joined just three other Alabama counties in voting for the Bull Moose Party candidacy of Theodore Roosevelt. The county also voted for Populist candidate James B. Weaver in 1892.

The only Democrat to win the county since 1936 (or to get a majority in it since 1880) has been Jimmy Carter in 1976, and in recent times Winston County has become comparably Republican to the Texas Panhandle. Winston County did vote for George Wallace in 1968, who was the Democratic candidate in the state. Winston was the only county in Alabama to give a majority of its votes to Republican candidate Thomas E. Dewey in 1948 over Dixiecrat Strom Thurmond. In 2020, Republican Donald Trump won just over 90% of the vote in Winston County, the best for any candidate in the county&#x27;s history.

<text>Colbert County () is a county located in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census the county&#x27;s population was 57,227. The county seat is Tuscumbia. The largest city is Muscle Shoals.

The county is named in honor of brothers George and Levi Colbert, who were Chickasaw chiefs in the early 19th century in this territory. Ultimately the federal government forced the removal of most of the Chickasaw and other historic tribes from the Southeast.

Colbert County is part of the Florence–Muscle Shoals, AL metropolitan statistical area, also known as &quot;The Shoals&quot;.

==History==
The Chickasaw and Cherokee peoples are the earliest known inhabitants of Colbert County, an area that was part of their territories for hundreds of years. Before they emerged, there were earlier cultures of indigenous peoples who established settlements and seasonal villages for thousands of years in the area.

In the 1810s, settlers began to settle in an area at a crossroads that developed as Leighton, Alabama. Colbert County was originally established during the Reconstruction era after the American Civil War on February 6, 1867. The state legislature split it from Franklin County over political issues. It was abolished eight months later on November 29, 1867 by an Alabama constitutional convention, and reestablished by the legislature on February 24, 1870.

In 1890, the eastern boundary of Colbert County was changed from County Line Road to Town Creek; this resulted in all of the town of Leighton placed within Colbert County. Colbert County is the location of Ivy Green, the birthplace of noted author and activist Helen Keller. Colbert County includes the cities of Sheffield and Muscle Shoals, where many popular American and British musicians, such as Aretha Franklin and the Rolling Stones, respectively, recorded music.

Also located in Colbert County is the Key Underwood Coon Dog Memorial Graveyard established in 1937. Coon dogs were bred and trained for hunting in this region.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (4.7%) is water. The county&#x27;s elevation ranges from 410 feet at the Tennessee River in northwestern Colbert County to 980 feet in southeastern Colbert County at the broadcast facility&#x27;s tower of WQPR-FM/WFIQ-TV.

<text>Cleburne County is a county located in the east central portion of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 15,056. Its county seat is Heflin. Its name is in honor of Patrick R. Cleburne of Arkansas who rose to the rank of major general in the Confederate States Army. The eastern side of the county borders the state of Georgia.

==History==
Cleburne County was established on December 6, 1866, by an act of the state legislature. The county was made from territory in Benton (now Calhoun), Randolph, and Talladega counties. In 1867, Edwardsville was made the county seat. An election was held in 1905 to move the county seat to Heflin. The result of that election, which agreed to move the seat, was appealed to the Supreme Court, who decided on July 1, 1906, to uphold the election results. Heflin is still the county seat. Heflin was at one point thought of as a hub for nearby farmers to send their cotton. Shortly after the Civil War, a group of northern investors created the town of Fruithurst in Cleburne County as part of a wine-growing project. Fruithurst became a boomtown shortly thereafter.

==Geography==

Although not to the same extent as Winston or Chilton Counties, Cleburne County was at least in Presidential elections a Republican island in overwhelmingly Democratic Alabama during the &quot;Solid South&quot; era due to its unsuitable terrain for slave-based plantation agriculture. This led to considerable Populist support during the period of &quot;Redemption&quot; by white Democrats, which produced later support for the Republican Party even when in most of Alabama whites associated the &quot;Party of Lincoln&quot; with occupation and black political power.

Since the end of the dealigned political era of the 1960s and 1970s, Cleburne County has followed the same trajectory towards overwhelming Republican dominance as the rest of Appalachia: in 2020, Joe Biden gained nine percent of the county&#x27;s vote, a figure less than George McGovern in his landslide 1972 defeat.

<text>Conecuh County () is a county located in the south-central portion of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census the population was 11,597. Its county seat is Evergreen. Its name is believed to be derived from a Creek Indian term meaning &quot;land of cane.&quot;

==History==
The areas along the rivers had been used by varying cultures of indigenous peoples for thousands of years. French and Spanish explorers encountered the historic Creek Indians. Later, British colonial traders developed relationships with the Creek and several married high-status Creek women. As the tribe has a matrilineal system, children are considered born into their mother&#x27;s clan and take their status from her family.

During the American Revolutionary War, the Upper Creek chief Alexander McGillivray, whose father was Scottish, allied his tribe with the British, hoping they could stop colonial Americans from encroaching on Creek land. Commissioned a British colonel, McGillivray named Jean-Antoine Le Clerc, a French adventurer who lived with the Creeks for 20 years, as the war chief to lead the Creek warriors.

Conecuh County was established by Alabama on February 13, 1818. Some of its territory was taken in 1868 by the Republican state legislature during the Reconstruction era to establish Escambia County. Located in the coastal plain, 19th century Conecuh County was an area of plantations and cotton cultivation, and it is still quite rural today. Thousands of African American residents left in the 1940s, during the Second Great Migration, mostly for industrial regions in the major cities.

In September 1979, the county was declared a disaster area, due to damage caused by Hurricane Frederic.

Conecuh County was mentioned as the birthplace of Theodore Bagwell in the television series &quot;Prison Break&quot;.

==Sausage==
Known as &quot;The Sausage of the South&quot;, Conecuh County is also known as the birthplace of Conecuh sausage. In the days before most had freezers, a man named Henry Sessions formulated his recipe for hickory smoked pork sausage. After returning from World War II, Sessions worked as a salesman for a meatpacking plant in Montgomery, Alabama. He started Sessions Quick Freeze in Evergreen in 1947 so that people could bring their pigs and cattle, have them slaughtered, and store them and their vegetables in his rentable meat locker. But it was Sessions&#x27; high-quality smoked pork sausage that put his company on the map. Customer demand for the sausage made the family butcher 250 hogs a week to satisfy these cravings. Today the 100-employee company makes 35,000- 40,000 pounds of sausage a week.

<doc id="77373" wikidata="Q61725" url="?curid=77373" title="Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg">
<text>Berthold Alfred Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg (15 March 1905 – 10 August 1944) was a German aristocrat and lawyer who was a key conspirator in the plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944, alongside his younger brother, Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg. After the plot failed, Berthold was tried and executed by the Nazi regime.

==Early life==
Berthold was the oldest of three brothers (the second being Berthold&#x27;s twin Alexander Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg) born into an old and distinguished aristocratic South German Catholic family. His parents were the last &quot;Oberhofmarschall&quot; of the Kingdom of Württemberg, Alfred Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, and Caroline née von Üxküll-Gyllenband. Among his ancestors were several famous Prussians, including most notably August von Gneisenau.

In his youth, he and his brothers were members of the &quot;Neupfadfinder&quot;, a German Scout association and part of the German Youth movement.

After having studied law at Tübingen, he became assistant professor of international law at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Foreign and International Law in 1927. He and his brother Claus were introduced by Albrecht von Blumenthal to the circle of the mystic symbolist poet Stefan George, many of whose followers became members of the German Resistance to National Socialism. He worked at The Hague from 1930 to 1932 and in 1936 married Maria (Mika) Classen (1900–1977). They had two children: Alfred Claus Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg (1937–1987) and Elisabeth Caroline Margarete Maria Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg (b. 13 June 1939). He lived with his family in Berlin-Wannsee.

==Career and coup attempt==
In 1939, he joined the German Navy, working in the High Command as a staff judge and advisor for international law.

Berthold&#x27;s apartment at Tristanstraße in Berlin, where his brother Claus also lived for some time, was a meeting place for the 20 July conspirators, including their cousin Peter Yorck von Wartenburg. As Claus had access to the inner circle around Hitler, he was assigned to plant a bomb at the &quot;Führer&quot;″s briefing hut at the military high command in Rastenburg, East Prussia, on 20 July 1944. Claus then flew to Rangsdorf airfield south of Berlin where he met with Berthold. They went together to &quot;Bendlerstraße&quot;, which the coup leaders intended to use as the centre of their operations in Berlin.

Hitler survived the bomb blast and the coup failed. Berthold and his brother were arrested at Bendlerstraße the same night. Claus was executed by firing squad shortly afterwards.

After his arrest, Stauffenberg was questioned by the &quot;Gestapo&quot; about his views about the &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot;. Stauffenberg told the Gestapo that “he and his brother had basically approved of the racial principle of National Socialism, but considered it to be &#x27;exaggerated&#x27; and &#x27;excessive&#x27;.” Stauffenberg went on to state,
The racial idea has been grossly betrayed in this war in that the best German blood is being irrevocably sacrificed, while simultaneously Germany is populated by millions of foreign workers, who certainly cannot be described as of high racial quality.

Berthold was tried in the &quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Court&quot;) by Roland Freisler on 10 August and was one of eight conspirators executed by strangulation, hanged in Plötzensee Prison, Berlin, later that day. Before he was killed Berthold was strangled and then revived multiple times. The entire execution and multiple resuscitations were filmed for Hitler to view at his leisure.

<text>USS &quot;S-1&quot; (SS-105) was the lead boat of the S class of submarines of the United States Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
The U.S. Navy had awarded contracts for the first three S-boats under the same general specifications but of different design types. &quot;S-1&quot; was what was known as a &quot;Holland-type&quot;, while was a &quot;Lake-type&quot; and a &quot;Government-type&quot;.

&quot;S-1&quot;″s prime contractor, the Electric Boat Company, subcontracted her construction to the Fore River Shipbuilding Company of Quincy, Massachusetts. Her keel was laid down on 11 December 1917. She was launched on 26 October 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Emory S. Land, and commissioned on 5 June 1920.

==Service history==

===United States Navy===

====Inter-war period====
&quot;S-1&quot; began her service operations in July 1920 with a cruise to Bermuda attached to Submarine Division 2 (SubDiv 2), with subsequent operations out of New London, Connecticut, cruising the New England coast until 1923.
On 2 January 1923, she shifted to SubDiv Zero, a division created for experimental work, and conducted winter maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea. As a single-ship division, SubDiv Zero, she returned to New London in the spring to continue experimental duty.

As part of a series of studies conducted by the United States Navy after World War I into the possibility of submarine-borne observation and scouting aircraft, &quot;S-1&quot; became the experimental platform for this project late in 1923. She was altered by having a steel capsule mounted abaft the conning tower; a cylindrical pod which could house a small collapsible seaplane, the Martin MS-1. After surfacing, this plane could be rolled out, quickly assembled, and launched by ballasting the sub until the deck was awash. These experiments were carried out into 1926 using the Martin-built plane, constructed of wood and fabric, and the all-metal Cox-Klemin versions, XS-1 and XS-2. The first full cycle of surfacing, assembly, launching, retrieving, disassembly, and submergence took place on 28 July 1926, on the Thames River at New London.

Following the aircraft experiments, &quot;S-1&quot; served as flagship for SubDiv 2 until July 1927, when she was transferred to SubDiv 4. While attached to this division, she made operational cruises to the Panama Canal Zone in 1928–1930, during the spring months. She visited ports at Cristobal, Canal Zone and Coco Solo, Canal Zone; Cartagena, Colombia; Kingston, Jamaica; and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, during these cruises, and spent the remaining months of those years operating along the New England coast, out of New London.

January 1931 found her at Pearl Harbor. She remained there into 1937; first, attached to SubDiv 7, SubRon 4, then, from July 1932 – July 1933, attached to Rotating Reserve SubDiv 14. She was returned to SubDiv 7 in August, and remained with that division until departing in May 1937 for Philadelphia. &quot;S-1&quot; arrived at Philadelphia on 22 July and commenced overhaul for deactivation. She was decommissioned on 20 October.

====World War II====
On 16 October 1940, &quot;S-1&quot; was recommissioned at Philadelphia. She then made two cruises to Bermuda, training submariners, and returned to Philadelphia from the second cruise on 7 December 1941. There, she prepared for transfer to Britain under the Lend-Lease program. She was decommissioned and turned over to the British on 20 April 1942. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 June.

===Royal Navy===
&quot;S-1&quot; served the Royal Navy as &quot;HMS P.552&quot; as a training vessel for anti-submarine warfare. In poor condition after arriving in Durban, Natal, South Africa, she was often in repair and she was declared unseaworthy in January 1944.

She was returned to the U.S. Navy at Durban on 16 October 1944, where she was stripped of vital parts and machinery, and her hull was sold for local scrapping on 20 July 1945 and she was scrapped there on 14 September of that year.

==History==
Crenshaw County was established after the American Civil War on November 30, 1866, by the Reconstruction era legislature. It was formed from parts of Butler, Coffee, Covington, Pike and Lowndes counties. While part of the coastal area, this county had relatively infertile soils, limiting cotton and other agriculture. Its planters used enslaved African Americans for all needed types of labor. Many of their descendants stayed in the area, and nearly one-quarter of the county population is African American.

Crenshaw County became a center of timbering in the Piney Wood region, especially after the Montgomery and Florida Railroad Company constructed a line through the county in 1886. This provided transport to markets for timber. It connected with Sprague Junction in Montgomery County, Alabama. The timber camps were rough work areas where racial tensions sometimes flared.

==Geography==

<doc id="77378" wikidata="Q160892" url="?curid=77378" title="Thuringii">
<text>The Thuringii, or Thuringians were a Germanic people who lived in the kingdom of the Thuringians that appeared during the late Migration Period south of the Harz Mountains of central Germania, a region still known today as Thuringia. The Thuringian kingdom came into conflict with the Merovingian Franks, and it later came under their influence and Frankish control as a stem duchy. The name is still used for one of modern Germany&#x27;s federal states (&quot;Bundesländer&quot;).

==First appearances==

The Thuringians do not appear in classical Roman texts under that name, but some have suggested that they were the remnants of the Suebic Hermanduri, the last part of whose name (&quot;-duri&quot;) could represent the same sound as (&quot;-thuri&quot;) and the Germanic suffix &quot;-ing&quot;, suggests a meaning of &quot;descendants of (the [Herman]duri)&quot;. This people were living near the Marcomanni. Tacitus, in his &quot;Germania&quot;, describes their homeland as being where the Elbe starts, but also having colonies at the Danube, and even within the Roman province of Rhaetia. Claudius Ptolemy mentions neither the Hermunduri nor the Thuringians in his geography, but instead the Teuriochaemae, who are described as living just north of the Sudetes mountains in, what is thought to be, the Ore Mountains. These may also be connected to later Thuringians. (&quot;Chaemae&quot; may represent a version of the Germanic word for &quot;home&quot;. Ptolemy also for example mentions a people called the &quot;Bainochaimai&quot;, located to the west of the Elbe.) 

The name of the Thuringians appears to be first mentioned in the veterinary treatise of Vegetius, written early in the fifth century.

The formation of the Thuringian kingdom may have had also been influenced by two longer-known tribes more associated with the eastern bank of the lower Elbe river, northeast of Thuringia, because the Carolingian law code written for them was called the &quot;law of the Angles and Varini that is the Thuringians&quot;. Much earlier, in his &quot;Germania&quot; for example, Tacitus had grouped the Anglii and Varini among the more distant Suebic tribes, living beyond the Elbe, and near a sea where they worshipped a goddess called Nerthus. These two tribes are among Germanic groups known to have been found north of the Danube in this period. Procopius in his &quot;Gothic Wars&quot; describes the land of the Varini in the 6th century as being south of the Danes, but north of the Slavs, who were in turn north of the uncultivated lands which lay north of the Danube. Procopius describes a marriage alliance between the Angles of Britain and the Varni in the sixth century.

They appear in some lists of the peoples involved in Attila&#x27;s invasion of Gaul. Walter Pohl has also proposed that they may be the same as the Turcilingi (or Torcolingi) who were one of the tribes near the middle Danube after the collapse of the empire of Attila, to whom they had apparently all been subject. They are specifically associated with Odoacer, who later became King of Italy, and are sometimes thought to have formed a part of the Sciri. Other tribes in this region at the time included the Rugii and the Heruls. Sidonius Apollinaris, in his seventh poem, explicitly lists them among the allies who fought under Attila when he entered Gaul in 451. During the reign of Childeric I, Gregory of Tours and Fredegar record that the Frankish King married the runaway wife of the King of the Thuringians, but the story may be distorted. (For example, the area of Tongeren, now in Belgium, may have been intended.)

More clearly, correspondence is recorded with a kingdom of Thuringians by Procopius and Cassiodorus during the reigns of Theoderic the Great (454–526) and Clovis I (approx. 466–511), after the downfall of Attila and Odoacer. 

==Political history==
The Thuringii established an empire in the late fifth century. It reached its territorial peak in the first half of the sixth before it was conquered by the Franks in 531–532. Examination of Thuringian grave sites reveal cranial features which suggest the strong presence of Hunnic women or slaves, perhaps indicating that many Thuringians took Hunnic wives or Hunnic slaves following the collapse of the Hunnic Empire. There is also evidence from jewellery found in graves that the Thuringians sought marriages with Ostrogothic and Lombard women. Under the leadership of Alboin, a large group of Thuringii joined the Lombards on their migration into Italy. The Lombard king Agilulf (590–616) was of Thuringian descent.

After their conquest, the Thuringii were placed under Frankish dukes, but they rebelled and had regained their independence by the late seventh century under Radulf. Towards the end of this century, parts of Thuringia came under Saxon rule.

By the time of Charles Martel and Saint Boniface, they were again subject to the Franks and ruled by Frankish dukes, with their seat at Würzburg in the south. Under Martel, the Thuringian dukes&#x27; authority was extended over a part of Austrasia and the Bavarian plateau. The valleys of the Lahn, Main, and Neckar rivers were included. The Naab formed the south-eastern border of Thuringia at the time. The Werra and Fulda valleys were within it also and it reached as far as the Saxon plain in the north. Its central location in Germania, beyond the Rhine, was the reason it became the &quot;point d&#x27;appui&quot; of Boniface&#x27;s mission work.

The Thuringii had a separate identity as late as 785–786, when one of their leading men, Hardrad, led an abortive insurrection against Charlemagne. The Carolingians codified the Thuringian legal customs (but perhaps did not use them extensively) as the &quot;Lex Thuringorum&quot; and continued to exact a tribute of pigs, presumably a Merovingian imposition, from the province. In the tenth century, under the Ottonians, the centre of Thuringian power lay in the north-east, near Erfurt. As late as the end of the tenth century, the porcine tribute was still being accepted by the King of Germany.

==Ecclesiastical history==
Christianity had reached the Thuringii in the fifth century, but their exposure to it was limited. Their real Christianisation took place, alongside the ecclesiastical organisation of their territory, during the early and mid eighth century under Boniface, who felled their &quot;sacred oak&quot; at Geismar in 724, abolishing the vestiges of their paganism.

In the 1020s, Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz, began the minting of coins at Erfurt, the oldest market town in Thuringia with a history going back to the Merovingian period. The economy, especially trade (such as with the Slavs), greatly increased after that.

==Social history==
The Thuringian nobility, which had an admixture of Frankish, Thuringian, and Saxon blood, was not as landed as that of Francia. There was also a larger population of free peasant farmers than in Francia, though there was still a large number of serfs. The obligations of serfs there were also generally less oppressive. There were also fewer clergymen before Boniface came. There was a small number of artisans and merchants, mostly trading with the Slavs to the east. The town of Erfurt was the easternmost trading post in Frankish territory at the time.

==Historiography==
The history of the Thuringii is best known from the writings concerning their conquerors, the Franks. Gregory of Tours, a Gallo-Roman, includes the nearest account in time of the fall of the Thuringian Empire. Widukind of Corvey, writing in tenth-century Saxony, inundates his similar account with various legends.

The Thuringii make brief appearances in contemporary Italian sources when their activities affect the land south of the Alps. Procopius, the Eastern Roman author, mentions them and speaks of their fall. The seventh-century &quot;Origo Gentis Langobardorum&quot; mentions a king of the Thuringii, Fisud, as a contemporary of Theudebert I.

<text>Cullman County is a county located in the north central portion of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 87,866. Its county seat and largest city is Cullman. Its name is in honor of Colonel John G. Cullmann.

Cullman County comprises the Cullman, AL Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Birmingham-Hoover-Talladega, AL Combined Statistical Area.

It is served by TV stations and FM radio stations from both Huntsville and Birmingham and is part of the designated market area, or &quot;DMA,&quot; of Birmingham. Cullman is a &quot;moist&quot; county in terms of availability of alcoholic beverages; the cities of Cullman, Good Hope, and Hanceville allow sale of alcohol and are &quot;wet&quot; and the rest of the county is dry.

==History==
This area was inhabited for thousands of years by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. The historic Cherokee and Choctaw lived here at the time of European encounter, with the Cherokee moving in after the American Revolutionary War and in response to pressures from northern areas. Their settlements in Alabama were known as the Lower Towns.

People claiming descent from Cherokee who remained in the county after Indian Removal in the 1830s, organized as the &quot;Echota Cherokee Tribe of Alabama&quot; in the 1980s. The tribe was recognized by the state in 1984 but is not federally recognized. It claims 22,000 members in the state, mostly in northern Alabama.

Cullman County was organized in 1877 primarily by German American immigrants who had moved down from Cincinnati, Ohio. They founded an agricultural community and sought to create an agricultural revolution in what had been a frontier area, in the best traditions of innovation in the New South. However, hard geographical and social realities clashed with the often impractical vision of colonizer John G. Cullmann. His Germans, with their traditional work ethic and willingness to experiment with such new products as wine and strawberries, tried to make practical changes in southern farming. The Germans were outnumbered by more traditional families from neighboring regions, who replicated the traditional southern cotton culture.

On April 27, 2011, Cullman was hit by the 2011 Cullman tornado, which took place during the 2011 Super Outbreak.

<text>Dallas County is a county located in the central part of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, its population was 38,462. The county seat is Selma. Its name is in honor of United States Secretary of the Treasury Alexander J. Dallas, who served from 1814 to 1816.

Dallas County comprises the Selma, AL Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Dallas County was created by the Alabama territorial legislature on February 9, 1818, from Montgomery County. This was a portion of the Creek cession of lands to the US government of August 9, 1814. The Creek were known as one of the Five Civilized Tribes of the Southeast. The county was named for U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander J. Dallas of Pennsylvania.

Dallas County is located in what has become known as the Black Belt region of the west-central portion of the state. The name referred to its fertile soil, and the area was largely developed for cotton plantations, worked by numerous enslaved African Americans in the antebellum period. After emancipation following the Civil War, many of the African Americans stayed in the area and worked as sharecroppers and tenant farmers. The county has been majority black since before the war. 

Dallas County produced more cotton by 1860 than any other county in the state, requiring a large supply of workers, who were mostly enslaved. Dallas County slave owners on average had seventeen enslaved workers (compared to ten in Montgomery County, for instance); slave owners made up some 16% of the county&#x27;s white population, but if their families are added, at least a third of the county&#x27;s population was attached to a slaveholding family, according to historian Alston Fitts.

Well-known local slaveowners include Washington Smith, owner of a big plantation in Bogue Chitto, Alabama, near Selma, and founder of the Bank of Selma. After Emancipation he continued to exert great influence over the African-American people in the county. 
Shortly before the war, Smith had bought a West African girl, Redoshi, one of an illegal shipment of slaves in 1860. He called her Sally Smith. She was from Benin, kidnapped at age 12 and one of numerous African captives transported on the &quot;Clotilda&quot; to Mobile, Alabama, more than 50 years after the slave trade had been abolished.

The county is traversed by the Alabama River, flowing from northeast to southwest across the county. It is bordered by Perry, Chilton, Autauga, Lowndes, Wilcox, and Marengo counties. Originally, the Dallas county seat was at Cahaba, which also served as the state capital for a brief period. In 1865, the county seat was transferred to Selma, Alabama as the center of population had moved. Other towns and communities in the still mostly rural county include Marion Junction, Sardis, Orrville, Valley Grande, and Minter.

===20th century to present===
Cotton production suffered in the early 20th century due to infestation of boll weevil, which invaded cotton areas throughout the South. At the turn of the 20th century, the state legislature disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites through provisions of a new state constitution requiring payment of poll tax and passing a literacy test for voter registration. These largely survived legal challenges and blacks were excluded from the political system.

The period from 1877 to 1950 (and especially 1890 through 1930), was the height of lynchings across the South, as whites worked to impose white supremacy and Jim Crow. According to the third edition of &quot;Lynching in America&quot;, Dallas County had 19 lynchings in this period, the second-highest number of any county in the state after Jefferson County. The lynching mobs killed suspects of alleged crimes, but also for behavior that offended a white man, and for labor organizing. In the early and mid-20th century, a total of 6.5 million blacks left the South in the Great Migration to escape these oppressive conditions.

In the postwar era of the 1950s and 1960s, African Americans, including many veterans, mounted new efforts across the South to be able to exercise their constitutional right as citizens to register and vote.

The still mostly rural county reached a peak of population in 1960. Younger people have since left to seek work elsewhere. The county is working on new directions for economic development.

From 1963 through 1965, Selma and Dallas County were the sites of a renewed Voting Rights campaign. It was organized by locals of the Dallas County Voters League (DCVL), and joined by activists from Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). In late 1964 they invited help from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); with SCLC president Martin Luther King Jr. participating, this campaign attracted national and international news in February and March 1965. They planned a march from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery, Alabama. Two activists were killed during demonstrations before the final march took place.

On March 7, several hundred peaceful marchers were beaten by state troopers and county posse after they passed over the Edmund Pettus Bridge and into the county, intending to march to the state capital of Montgomery. The events were covered by national media. The protesters renewed their walk on March 21, having been joined by thousands of sympathizers from across the country and gained federal protection, to complete the Selma to Montgomery marches. More people joined them, so that some 25,000 people entered Montgomery on the last day of the march. In August of that year, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Millions of African-American citizens across the South have registered and voted in the subsequent years, participating again in the political system.

On March 5, 2018, Selma commemorated these marches. In addition, the city conducted a Community Remembrance Project, unveiling a new historic marker to memorialize the 19 African Americans who were lynched in Dallas County by whites during the late 19th and up to mid-20th century in acts of racial terrorism. This was done in cooperation with the Equal Justice Initiative, which published a report in 2015 that documented nearly 4,000 such lynchings, as well as Selma Center for Nonviolence Truth and Reconciliation at Healing Waters Retreat Center, Selma: Truth, Racial Healing &amp; Transformation, and the Black Belt Community Foundation.

The average household size was 2.57 and the average family size was 3.15.

In the county, the population was spread out, with 28.60% under the age of 18, 9.40% from 18 to 24, 26.20% from 25 to 44, 21.90% from 45 to 64, and 13.90% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 83.50 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 77.80 males.

The median income for a household in the county was $23,370, and the median income for a family was $29,906. Males had a median income of $31,568 versus $18,683 for females. The per capita income for the county was $13,638. About 27.20% of families and 31.10% of the population were below the poverty line, including 40.70% of those under age 18 and 27.60% of those age 65 or over.

==Government and politics==
Dallas County is governed by a five-member county commission, elected from single-member districts.

Along with the rest of the Black Belt, Dallas County is solidly Democratic. Although African Americans supported the Republican Party during Reconstruction and into the early 20th century, they have supported Democratic candidates since the mid-1960s. No Republican has carried the county since Richard Nixon&#x27;s 3,000-county-plus landslide in 1972.

<text>Luís Vaz de Camões (; or 1525 – 10 June 1580), sometimes rendered in English as Camoens or Camoëns ( ), is considered Portugal&#x27;s and the Portuguese language&#x27;s greatest poet. His mastery of verse has been compared to that of Shakespeare, Milton, Vondel, Homer, Virgil and Dante. He wrote a considerable amount of lyrical poetry and drama but is best remembered for his epic work &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot; (&quot;The Lusiads&quot;). His collection of poetry &quot;The Parnasum of Luís de Camões&quot; was lost during his life. The influence of his masterpiece &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot; is so profound that Portuguese is sometimes called the &quot;language of Camões&quot;.

The day of his death, 10 June OS, is Portugal&#x27;s national day.
==Life==
===Origins and youth===

Much of the information about Luís de Camões&#x27; biography raises doubts and, probably, much of what circulates about him is nothing more than the typical folklore that is formed around a famous figure. Only a few dates are documented that guide its trajectory. The ancestral home of the Camões family had its origins in the Kingdom of Galicia, not far from Cape Finisterre. On his paternal side, Luís de Camões was descended from Vasco Pires de Camões, Galician troubadour, warrior and fidalgo, who moved to Portugal in 1370 and received great benefits from the king in positions, honours and lands, and whose poetry, of a nationalist nature, contributed to ward off Breton and Italian influence and to shape a national troubadour style. His son Antão Vaz de Camões served in the Red Sea and married Dona Guiomar da Gama, related to Vasco da Gama. From this marriage were born Simão Vaz de Camões, who served in the Royal Navy and did trade in Guinea and India, and another brother, Bento, who followed the career of a man of letters and entered the priesthood, joining the Austin friars at the Monastery of Santa Cruz, which was a prestigious school for many young Portuguese gentlemen. Simão married Dona Ana de Sá e Macedo, also from a noble family, from Santarém. Her only son, Luís Vaz de Camões, according to Jayne, Fernandes and some other authors, was born in Lisbon in 1524. Three years later, the city was being threatened by the plague, the family moved, following the court, to Coimbra. However, other cities claim the honour of being his birthplace: Coimbra, Santarém and Alenquer. Although the first biographers of Camões, Severin de Faria and Manoel Correa, initially gave his year of birth as 1517, records of the Lists of the Casa da Índia, later consulted by Manuel de Faria e Sousa, seem to establish that Camões was actually born in Lisbon, in 1524. The arguments for placing his birth outside of Lisbon are weak; but neither is it completely beyond doubt, so the most recent scholarship considers his place and date of birth uncertain.

About his childhood much remains unknown. At twelve or thirteen he would have been protected and educated by his uncle Bento, who sent him to Coimbra to study. Tradition says that he was an undisciplined student, but eager for knowledge, interested in history, cosmography and classic and modern literature. However, his name does not appear in the records of the University of Coimbra, but it is certain from his elaborate style and the profusion of erudite quotes that appear in his works that in some way he received a solid education. It is possible that his uncle himself, a chancellor of the university and the prior of the Monastery of Santa Cruz, instructed him or that he studied at the monastery college. At about twenty years of age he probably moved to Lisbon, before completing his studies. His family was poor, but being noble, he could be admitted to the court of John III where he established fruitful intellectual contacts and began his career as a poet.

It was suggested that he earned his living as a preceptor of Francisco, son of the Count of Linhares, D. António de Noronha, but this now seems hardly plausible. It is also said that he adopted a bohemian lifestyle, frequenting taverns and getting involved in tumultuous love affairs. Several ladies are cited by name in late biographies of the poet as having been the object of his affection, but those identifications are currently considered apocryphal additions to his legend. Among them, for example, there was talk of a passion for Infanta Dona Maria, sister of the king, but that audacity would have earned him time in prison. Another was Catarina de Ataíde, with whom he allegedly had a frustrated love affair that resulted in his self-exile, first in Ribatejo, and then by enlisting as a soldier in Ceuta. The reason for the latter trip is doubtful, but the trip itself is accepted fact; he remained there two years and lost his right eye in a naval battle in the Strait of Gibraltar. Back in Lisbon, he wasted no time in resuming his bohemian life.

A document dating from 1550 states that he had enlisted to travel to India: &quot;&quot;Luís de Camões, son of Simão Vaz and Ana de Sá, living in Lisbon, at Mouraria; squire, 25 years old, ginger bearded, brought his father as guarantor; goes on the ship of S. Pedro dos Burgaleses ... among the men-at-arms&quot;. As it turns out, he didn&#x27;t board immediately. In a Corpus Christi procession, he got into an altercation with a certain Gonçalo Borges, employee of the Royal Palace, and wounded him with a sword. Sentenced to prison, he later received a letter of pardon and was released by royal order on 7 March 1553, which says: &quot;he is a young man and poor and he is going to serve in India this year&quot;&quot;. Manuel de Faria e Sousa found in the registers of the Armada of India, for that year 1553, under the title &quot;Gente de guerra&quot; (&quot;Men of war&quot;), the following statement: &quot;Fernando Casado, son of Manuel Casado and Branca Queimada, residents of Lisbon, squire; Luís de Camões, son of Simão Vaz and Ana de Sá, squire, took his place; and he received 2400 like the others&quot;.

Camões set sail on Palm Sunday, the 24th of March 1553. His last words, he says in a letter, were those of Scipio Africanus, “Ingrata patria, non possidebis ossa mea” (Ungrateful fatherland, you will not possess my bones).

===Journey to the East===
He traveled aboard the carrack São Bento, belonging to the fleet of Fernão Álvares Cabral, which left the Tagus on March 24, 1553. During the trip he passed through the regions where Vasco da Gama had sailed, faced a storm in the Cape of Good Hope Cabo da Boa Esperança where the three other ships in the fleet were lost, and landed in Goa in 1554. Soon he enlisted in the service of the viceroy D. Afonso de Noronha and fought in the expedition against the king of Chembé (or &quot;da Pimenta&quot;). In 1555, Noronha&#x27;s successor D. Pedro Mascarenhas ordered Manuel de Vasconcelos to fight the Moors in the Red Sea. Camões accompanied him, but the squadron did not find the enemy and went to winter in Ormuz, in the Persian Gulf.

Probably at this time he had already started writing Os Lusíadas. When he returned to Goa in 1556, he met D. Francisco Barreto in the government, and composed for him the &quot;Auto de Filodemo&quot;, which suggests that Barreto looked upon Camões with favor. The early biographers, however, differ about Camões&#x27; relations with that ruler. At the same time, an anonymous satire criticizing the prevalence of immorality and corruption, which was attributed to Camões, also was published. Since satires were condemned by the Ordinances of King Manuel, Camões would have been arrested for that. But it has also been hypothesized that the arrest was actually for debts that Camões had incurred. It is possible that he remained in prison until 1561, and that he may have been convicted of additional offenses before then. At any rate, when D. Francisco Coutinho assumed the governorship of India, Camões was released and came under that man&#x27;s employ and protection. He was appointed to the position of Superintendent for the Dead and Missing for Macau in 1562, serving &quot;de facto&quot; from 1563 until 1564 or 1565. At that time, Macau was a trading post still in formation and almost uninhabited. Tradition says that there he wrote part of Os Lusíadas in a cave, which later was named after him.

On the trip back to Goa, he was shipwrecked, as tradition says, near the mouth of the Mekong River, managing to save only himself and the manuscript of Os Lusíadas, an event that inspired the famous &quot;redondilha&quot; &quot;Sobre os rios que vão&quot;, considered by António Sérgio the &quot;backbone&quot; of the Camonian lyric, as is repeatedly cited in the critical literature. The trauma of the shipwreck, in the words of Leal de Matos, had the most profound impact on redefining the themes of Os Lusíadas, this being noticeable beginning with Canto VII, a fact already noted by Diogo do Couto, a friend of the poet who partly accompanied the work as it was being written.

His rescue took months to occur, and there is no record of how it happened, but he was taken to Malacca, where he received a new arrest warrant for misappropriating the assets of the dead that had been entrusted to him. The exact date of his return to Goa is not known, but he may have remained in prison there for some time. Couto says that in the shipwreck Dinamene, a Chinese maiden with whom Camões had fallen in love, died, but Ribeiro and others reject that story. The next viceroy, D. Antão de Noronha, was a longtime friend of Camões, having first met him during his Morocco adventure. Certain biographers claim that he was promised a position at the trading post at Chaul, but he did not take up the position. Severim de Faria said that the final years spent in Goa were occupied with poetry and military activities, where he always showed bravery, readiness and loyalty to the Crown.

It is difficult to determine what his daily life in the East would have been like, beyond what can be extrapolated from his military status. It seems certain that he always lived modestly and may have shared a house with friends, &quot;in one of those collective dwellings where it was customary for people from the homeland to associate&quot;, as Ramalho notes. Some of these friends must have been in possession of a certain degree of culture and would have provided illustrious companionship. Ribeiro, Saraiva and Moura admit that he may have encountered, among other figures, Fernão Mendes Pinto, Fernão Vaz Dourado, Fernão Álvares do Oriente, Garcia de Orta and the aforementioned Diogo do Couto, creating opportunities for debating literary topics and the like. He may also have attended lectures at one of Goa&#x27;s colleges or religious establishments. Ribeiro adds that

::&quot;These fellows who lived in Goa, far from their homeland and family, between campaigns against the Turk (which took place in the summer) and many of them having little to do (in winter), in addition to the aforementioned lectures and constant readings (including many of the classics: Ovid, Horace, Virgil), enjoying the company of women and musical gatherings, living among themselves without regard to social distinctions, their main objective was to have fun as much as possible, even when writing poetry. Thus their predilection for satire, which had a strongly negative social impact and exposed them to imprisonment per the Manueline Ordinances (Title LXXIX), and therefore carried an edge of adventure and risk. An example of this is the &quot;Tournament Satire&quot;, a mockery that is mentioned by Faria e Sousa and about which, unlike &quot;Os Disbarates da Índia&quot;, there is no scholarly contestation of its Camonian authorship; it may in fact be the reason for one of Camões&#x27; arrests.&quot;

At such meetings the participants were both men-at-arms and men of letters, and were in search not only of military success and material fortune, but also of the fame and glory born of culture. This was one of the great aspirations of the Humanism of that era, and from it may have sprung the idea of creating an academy, reproducing within the limitations of the local context, the model of Renaissance academies such as the one founded in Florence by Marsilio Ficino and his circle, where Neoplatonic ideals were cultivated.

===Return to Portugal===

Whether it was by invitation, or simply a matter of taking the chance to bridge part of the distance that separated him from his homeland, it is not known for certain, but in December 1567 Camões embarked on Pedro Barreto&#x27;s ship to Sofala, on the Island of Mozambique, where Barreto had been appointed governor, and there Camões would wait for transport to Lisbon at a future date. The early biographers say that Pedro Barreto was treacherous, making false promises to Camões, so that after two years Diogo do Couto found him in a precarious state:

::&quot;In Mozambique we found that Prince of Poets of his day, my companion and friend Luís de Camões, so poor that he was dependent on friends to feed him. Upon embarking for the kingdom we gathered all the clothing that he needed, and there was no shortage of people who gave him to eat. And that winter that he was in Mozambique, having just finished his Lusíadas in preparation for printing, he had been writing a great deal in another book which he entitled &quot;The Parnassus of Luís de Camões&quot;, it being a book of great erudition, doctrine and philosophy, but which was stolen from him.&quot;

While attempting to set sail with Couto, Camões found his departure embargoed in the amount of two hundred cruzados by Barreto, demanding reimbursement for monies spent on the poet&#x27;s behalf. His friends, however, collected the amount and Camões was released, arriving in Cascais aboard the carrack &quot;Santa Clara&quot; on April 7, 1570.

After so many adventures, he finally completed Os Lusíadas, presenting them in recitation to Sebastian. The king, still a teenager, ordered the work to be published in 1572, also granting a small pension to &quot;Luís de Camões, noble knight of my House&quot;, in payment for services rendered in India. The value of the pension did not exceed fifteen thousand réis a year, which, if not generous, was also not as miserly as has been suggested, considering that the Royal Palace&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting received around ten thousand réis. For a veteran soldier, the sum must have been considered sufficient and honorable at the time. But the pension would&#x27;ve only lasted for three years, and although the grant was renewable, it seems that it was paid irregularly, causing the poet to experience material difficulties.
Camões lived out his final years in a room in a house near the Convent of Santa Ana, in a state, according to tradition, of the most unworthy poverty, &quot;without a rag to cover him&quot;. Le Gentil considered this view a romantic exaggeration, as he was still able to keep a slave named Jau, whom he had brought with him from the east, and official documents attest that he had some means of livelihood. After being embittered by the Portuguese defeat at the Battle of Alcácer Quibir, in which Sebastian disappeared, leading Portugal to lose its independence to the Spanish crown, he was stricken by bubonic plague, according to Le Gentil. He was transported to a hospital and died on June 10, 1580, being buried, according to Faria e Sousa, in a shallow grave in the Convent of Santa Ana, or in the cemetery of the poor in the same hospital, according to Teófilo Braga. His mother, having survived him, began to receive his pension as an inheritance. The receipts, found at Torre do Tombo, the Portuguese national archive, document the date of the poet&#x27;s death, although an epitaph written by D. Gonçalo Coutinho has been preserved which mistakenly assigns his death to the year 1579. After the 1755 earthquake which destroyed most of Lisbon, attempts were made to find the remains of Camões, but to no avail. The bones deposited in 1880 in a tomb in the Jerónimos Monastery are, in all probability, someone else&#x27;s.

==Appearance, character, loves and iconography==
The testimonies of his contemporaries describe him as a man of average size, with reddish blond hair, blind in his right eye, skilled in all physical exercises and with a temperamental disposition, having little difficulty in engaging in fights. It is said that he had great value as a soldier, exhibiting courage, combativeness, a sense of honor and willingness to serve, a good companion in his spare time, liberal, cheerful and witty when the blows of fortune did not overwhelm his spirit and sadden him. He was aware of his merit as a man, as a soldier and as a poet.

All efforts made to discover the definitive identity of his muse were in vain and several contradictory proposals were made about alleged women present in his life. Camões himself suggested, in one of his poems, that there were several muses to inspire him, when he said &quot;in various flames it was often burning&quot;. The names of ladies supposed to have been his loved ones that appear in his poems are always used generically, and can therefore be ideal figures; no mention of any ladies identifiable by name is given in the poet&#x27;s first biographies, those of Pedro de Mariz and that of Severim de Faria, who only collected rumors about &quot;some loves in Paço da Rainha (the Queen’s Household)”. Reference to Catarina de Ataíde only appeared in the edition of Rimas de Faria e Sousa, in the middle of the 17th century and to the Infanta on José Maria Rodrigues, which was only published in the early 20th century. The celebrated Dinamene also appears to be a poetic image rather than a real person. Ribeiro proposed several alternatives to explain it: the name might have been a cryptonym of Dona Joana Meneses (DIna = D.Ioana + Mene), one of his possible loves, who died on the way to the Indies and was buried in the sea, daughter of Violante, countess of Linhares, whom he would also have loved in Portugal, and pointed out the occurrence of the name Dinamene in poems written probably around the arrival in India, before proceeding to China, where it is said that he would have found the girl. He also referred to the opinion of researchers who claim the mention of Couto, the only primitive reference to the Chinese outside of the Camonian work itself, to have been falsified, being introduced &quot;a posteriori&quot;, with the possibility that it is even a spelling error, a corruption of &quot;dignamente&quot; (&quot;worthily&quot;). In the final version of Couto&#x27;s manuscript, the name would not even have been cited, even though proving it is difficult with the disappearance of the manuscript.
Probably executed between 1573 and 1575, the so-called &quot;portrait painted in red&quot;, illustrated at the opening of the article, is considered by Vasco Graça Moura as &quot;the only and precious reliable document we have to know the features of the epic, portrayed in life by a professional painter &quot;. What is known of this portrait is a copy, made at the request of the 3rd Duke of Lafões, executed by Luís José Pereira de Resende between 1819 and 1844, from the original that was found in a green silk bag in the rubble of the fire at the palace of the Counts of Ericeira, which has since disappeared. It is a &quot;very faithful copy&quot; that:

Also surviving is a miniature painted in India in 1581, by order of Fernão Teles de Meneses and offered to the viceroy D. Luís de Ataíde, who, according to testimonies of the time, was very similar to him in appearance. Another portrait was found in the 1970s by Maria Antonieta de Azevedo, dated 1556 and showing the poet in prison. The first medal with its effigy appeared in 1782, ordered to mint by the Baron of Dillon in England, where Camões is crowned with laurels and dressed in coat of arms, with the inscription &quot;Apollo Portuguez / Honor de Hespanha / Nasceo 1524 / Morreo 1579&quot;. In 1793, a reproduction of this medal was coined in Portugal, by order of Tomás José de Aquino, Librarian of the Real Mesa Censória.

Over the centuries the image of Camões was represented numerous times in engraving, painting and sculpture, by Portuguese and foreign artists, and several monuments were erected in his honor, notably the great Monument to Camões installed in 1867 in Praça de Luís de Camões, in Lisbon, by Victor Bastos, which is the center of official public ceremonies and popular demonstrations. He was also honored in musical compositions, appeared with his effigy on medals, currency notes, stamps and coins, and as a character in novels, poetry and plays. The film Camões, directed by José Leitão de Barros, was the first Portuguese film to participate in the Cannes Film Festival, in 1946. Among the famous artists who took him as a model for his works are Bordalo Pinheiro, José Simões de Almeida, Francisco Augusto Metrass, António Soares dos Reis, Horace Vernet, José Malhoa, Vieira Portuense, Domingos Sequeira and Lagoa Henriques. A crater on the planet Mercury and an asteroid in the main belt were named after him.

==Work==
===Context===
Camões lived in the final phase of the European Renaissance, a period marked by many changes in culture and society, which mark the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Modern Age and the transition from feudalism to capitalism. It was called &quot;renaissance&quot; due to the rediscovery and revaluation of the cultural references of Classical Antiquity, which guided the changes of this period towards a humanist and naturalist ideal that affirmed the dignity of man, placing him at the center of the universe, making him the researcher par excellence of nature, and promoting reason and science as arbitrators of manifest life. During this period, several scientific instruments were invented and several natural laws and physical entities previously unknown were discovered; the knowledge of the face of the planet itself changed after the discoveries of the great navigations. The spirit of intellectual speculation and scientific research was on the rise, causing Physics, Mathematics, Medicine, Astronomy, Philosophy, Engineering, Philology and several other branches of knowledge to reach a level of complexity, efficiency and accuracy unprecedented, which led to an optimistic conception of human history as a continuous expansion and always for the better. In a way, the Renaissance was an original and eclectic attempt to harmonize pagan Neoplatonism with the Christian religion, eros with charitas, together with oriental, Jewish and Arab influences, and where the study of magic, astrology and the occult was not absent. It was also the time when strong national states began to be created, commerce and cities expanded and the bourgeoisie became a force of great social and economic importance, contrasting with the relative decline in the influence of religion in world affairs.

In the 16th century, the time in which Camões lived, the influence of the Italian Renaissance expanded throughout Europe. However, several of its most typical features were declining, in particular because of a series of political disputes and wars that altered the European political map, with Italy losing its place as a power, and the split of Catholicism, with the emergence of the Protestant Reformation. In the Catholic reaction, Counter-Reformation was launched, the Inquisition was reactivated and ecclesiastical censorship was rekindled. At the same time, Machiavelli&#x27;s doctrines became widespread, dissociating ethics from the practice of power. The result was the reaffirmation of the power of religion over the profane world and the formation of an agitated spiritual, political, social and intellectual atmosphere, with strong doses of pessimism, reverberating unfavorably on the former freedom that artists enjoyed. Despite this, the intellectual and artistic acquisitions of the High Renaissance that were still fresh and shining before the eyes could not be forgotten immediately, even if their philosophical substrate could no longer remain valid in the face of new political, religious and social facts. The new art that was made, although inspired by the source of classicism, translated it into restless, anxious, distorted, ambivalent forms, attached to intellectualist preciosities, characteristics that reflected the dilemmas of the century and define the general style of this phase as mannerist.

Since the middle of the 15th century, Portugal had established itself as a great naval and commercial power, its arts were developing and enthusiasm for maritime conquests was boiling. The reign of D. João II was marked by the formation of a feeling of national pride, and in the time of D. Manuel I, as Spina &amp; Bechara say, pride had given way to delirium, to the pure euphoria of world domination. At the beginning of the 16th century, Garcia de Resende lamented that there was no one who could celebrate so many feats worthily, claiming that there was epic material superior to that of the Romans and Trojans. Filling this gap, João de Barros wrote his cavalry novel, &quot;A Crónica do Imperador Clarimundo&quot; (1520), in epic format. Shortly thereafter, António Ferreira appeared, establishing himself as a mentor of the classicist generation and challenging his contemporaries to sing the glories of Portugal in high style. When Camões appeared, the land was prepared for the apotheosis of the homeland, a homeland that had fought hard to conquer its sovereignty, first of the Moors and after Castile, had developed an adventurous spirit that had taken it across the oceans, expanding the known borders of the world and opening new routes of trade and exploration, defeating enemy armies and the hostile forces of nature. But at this point, however, the political and cultural crisis was already being announced, materializing shortly after his death, when the country lost its sovereignty to Spain.

===Overview===

Camões&#x27; production is divided into three genres: lyrical, epic and theatrical. His lyrical work was immediately appreciated as a high achievement. He demonstrated his virtuosity especially in cantos and elegies, but his &quot;redondilhas&quot; are not far behind. In fact, he was a master in this form, giving new life to the art of gloss, instilling in it spontaneity and simplicity, a delicate irony and a lively phrasing, taking courtesan poetry to its highest level, and showing that he also knew how to express perfectly joy and relaxation. His epic production is synthesized in &#x27;Os Lusíadas&#x27;, an intense glorification of Portuguese feats, not only of his military victories, but also the conquest over elements and physical space, with recurring use of classic allegories. The idea of a national epic had existed in the Portuguese heart since the 15th century, when the navigations started, but it was up to Camões, in the following century, to materialize it. In his dramatic works he sought to fuse nationalist and classic elements.

Probably if he had remained in Portugal, as a courtly poet, he would never have achieved the mastery of his art. The experiences he accumulated as a soldier and navigator enriched his worldview and excited his talent. Through them, he managed to free himself from the formal limitations of courtesan poetry and the difficulties he went through, the profound anguish of exile, the longing for his country, indelibly impregnated his spirit and communicated with his work, and from there influenced in a marked way subsequent generations of Portuguese writers. His best poems shine exactly for what is genuine in the suffering expressed and the honesty of that expression, and this is one of the main reasons that put his poetry at such a high level.

Its sources were numerous. He dominated Latin and Spanish, and demonstrated a solid knowledge of Greco-Roman mythology, ancient and modern European history, Portuguese chroniclers and classical literature, with authors such as Ovid, Xenophon, Lucan, Valerius Flaccus, Horace standing out, but especially Homer and Virgil, from whom he borrowed various structural and stylistic elements and sometimes even passages in almost literal transcription. According to his quotations, he also seems to have had a good knowledge of works by Ptolemy, Diogenes Laërtius, Pliny the Elder, Strabo and Pomponius Mela, among other historians and ancient scientists. Among the moderns, he was aware of the Italian production of Francesco Petrarca, Ludovico Ariosto, Torquato Tasso, Giovanni Boccaccio and Jacopo Sannazaro, and of Castilian literature.

For those who consider the Renaissance to be a homogeneous historical period, informed by classical ideals and extending to the end of the 16th century, Camões is quite simply a Renaissance poet, but in general it is recognized that the 16th century was largely dominated by a stylistic derivation called Mannerism, which at various points is an anti-classical school and in many ways prefigures the Baroque. Thus, for many authors, it is more appropriate to describe the Camonian style as mannerist, distinguishing it from typical Renaissance classicism. This is justified by the presence of several language resources and an approach to its themes that are not in agreement with the doctrines of balance, economy, tranquility, harmony, unity and invariable idealism, which are the fundamental axes of Renaissance classicism. Camões, after a typically classic initial phase, moved on to other paths and anxiety and drama became his companions. Throughout The Lusiads the signs of a political and spiritual crisis are visible, the prospect of the decline of the empire and the character of the Portuguese remains in the air, censored by bad customs and the lack of appreciation for the arts, alternating with excerpts in which its enthusiastic apology. They are also typical of Mannerism, and would become even more Baroque, the taste for contrast, for emotional flare, for conflict, for paradox, for religious propaganda, for the use of complex figures of speech and preciousness, even for the grotesque and monstrous, many of them common features in Camonian work.

The mannerist nature of his work is also marked by the ambiguities generated by the rupture with the past and by the concomitant adherence to it, the first manifested in the visualization of a new era and in the use of new poetic formulas from Italy, and the second, in the use of archaisms typical of the Middle Ages. Along with the use of formal Renaissance and classicist models, he cultivated the medieval genres of vilancete, cantiga and trova. For Joaquim dos Santos, the contradictory character of his poetry is found in the contrast between two opposing premises: idealism and practical experience. He combined typical values of humanist rationalism with other derivatives of cavalry, crusades and feudalism, aligned the constant propaganda of the Catholic faith with ancient mythology, responsible in the aesthetic plan for all the action that materializes the final realization, discarding the mediocre aurea dear to classics to advocate the primacy of the exercise of weapons and the glorious conquest.

===Os Lusíadas===
Os Lusíadas, or The Lusiads is considered the Portuguese epic par excellence. The title itself already suggests its nationalist intentions, being derived from the ancient Roman denomination of Portugal, Lusitania. It is one of the most important epics of the modern age due to its greatness and universality. The epic tells the story of Vasco da Gama and the Portuguese heroes who sailed around the Cape of Good Hope and opened a new route to India. It is a humanist epic, even in its contradictions, in the association of pagan mythology with the Christian view, in the opposite feelings about war and empire, in the taste of rest and in the desire for adventure, in the appreciation of sensual pleasure and in the demands of an ethical life, in the perception of greatness and in the presentiment of decline, in the heroism paid for with suffering and struggle. The poem opens with the famous verses:

The ten cantos of the poem add up to 1,102 stanzas in a total of 8,816 decyllable verses, using the ottava rima (abababcc). After an introduction, an invocation and a dedication to King Sebastian, the action begins, which merges myths and historical facts. Vasco da Gama, sailing along the coast of Africa, is observed by the assembly of classical gods, who discuss the fate of the expedition, which is protected by Venus and attacked by Bacchus. Resting for a few days in Malindi, at the request of the local king Vasco da Gama narrates all Portuguese history, from its origins to the journey they undertake. The cantos III, IV and V contain some of the best passages of the entire epic: the episode of Inês de Castro, which becomes a symbol of love and death, the Battle of Aljubarrota, the vision of D. Manuel I, the description of St. Elmo&#x27;s fire, the story of the giant Adamastor. Back on the ship, the poet takes advantage of his free time to tell the story of the Twelve of England, while Bacchus summons the sea gods to destroy the Portuguese fleet. Venus intervenes and ships reach Calicut, India. There, Paulo da Gama receives the king&#x27;s representatives and explains the meaning of the banners that adorn the flagship. On the return trip the sailors enjoy the island created for them by Venus, rewarding the nymphs with their favors. One of them sings the glorious future of Portugal and the scene ends with a description of the universe by Tethys and Vasco da Gama. Then the journey continues home.
In Os Lusíadas, Camões achieves a remarkable harmony between classical scholarship and practical experience, developed with consummate technical skill, describing Portuguese adventures with moments of serious thought mixed with others of delicate sensitivity and humanism. The great descriptions of the battles, the manifestation of the natural forces, the sensual encounters, transcend the allegory and the classicist allusion that permeate all the work and present themselves as a fluent speech and always of a high aesthetic level, not only for its narrative character especially well achieved, but also by the superior mastery of all the resources of the language and the art of versification, with a knowledge of a wide range of styles, used in efficient combination. The work is also a serious warning for Christian kings to abandon small rivalries and unite against Muslim expansion.

The structure of the work is in itself worthy of interest, as, according to Jorge de Sena, nothing is arbitrary in Os Lusíadas. Among the arguments he presented was the use of the golden section, a defined relationship between the parts and the whole, organizing the set in ideal proportions that emphasize especially significant passages. Sena demonstrated that when applying the golden section to the whole work, it falls precisely on the verse that describes the arrival of the Portuguese in India. Applying the separate section to the two resulting parts, in the first part comes the episode that reports the death of Inês de Castro and, in the second, the stanza that narrates Cupid&#x27;s efforts to unite the Portuguese and the nymphs, which for Sena reinforces the importance of love throughout the composition. Two other elements give Os Lusíadas its modernity and distance it from classicism: the introduction of doubt, contradiction and questioning, in disagreement with the affirmative certainty that characterizes the classic epic, and the primacy of rhetoric over action, replacing the world of facts with that of words, which do not fully recover reality and evolve into metalanguage, with the same disruptive effect on the traditional epic.

According to Costa Pimpão, there is no evidence that Camões intended to write his epic before he traveled to India, although heroic themes were already present in his previous production. It is possible that he drew some inspiration from fragments of the &quot;Decades of Asia&quot;, by João de Barros, and the &quot;History of the Discovery and Conquest of India by the Portuguese&quot;, by Fernão Lopes de Castanheda. He was certainly well-informed on classical mythology before that, as well as on ancient epic literature. Apparently, the poem started to take shape as early as 1554, with Storck considering that his determination to write it was born during the sea voyage itself. He was seen working on it in Mozambique by his friend historian Diogo do Couto between 1568 and 1569.

The success of the publication of Os Lusíadas supposedly required a second edition in the same year as the &quot;princeps&quot; edition. The two differ in countless details and it was debated at length which one would in fact be the original. Nor is it clear to whom the amendments to the second text are due. Currently, the edition that shows the publisher&#x27;s brand, a pelican, with its neck turned to the left, which is called edition A, carried out under the supervision of the author, is recognized as original. However, edition B was for a long time taken as &quot;princeps&quot;, with disastrous consequences for the later critical analysis of the work. Apparently, edition B was produced later, around 1584 or 1585, in a clandestine manner, taking the fictitious date of 1572 to bypass the delays of censorship of the time if it were published as a new edition and to correct the serious defects of another 1584 edition, the so-called &quot;piscos&quot; edition. However, Maria Helena Paiva raised the hypothesis that editions A and B are only variants of the same edition, which was corrected after the typographic composition, but while printing was already in progress. According to the researcher, &quot;the need to make the most of the press led to the conclusion that, after printing a shape, which consisted of several folios, a first test was taken, which was corrected while the press continued, now with the corrected text. There were, therefore, uncorrected printed folios and corrected printed folios, which were grouped indistinctly in the same copy&quot;, so that there were no two copies exactly the same in the press system of that time.

===&quot;Rimas&quot;===

Camões&#x27; lyric work, dispersed in manuscripts, was collected and published posthumously in 1595 under the title &quot;Rimas&quot; (&quot;Rhymes&quot;). Throughout the 17th century, the growing prestige of his epic contributed to raise the appreciation for these other poems even more. The collection includes &quot;redondilhas&quot;, odes, glosses, cantigas, twists or variations, &quot;sextilhas&quot;, sonnets, elegies, eclogues and other small stanzas. His lyrical poetry comes from several different sources: the sonnets generally follow the Italian style derived from Petrarch, the songs took the model of Petrarch and Pietro Bembo. In the odes, the influence of the troubadour poetry of chivalry and classical poetry is verified, but with a more refined style; in the &quot;sextilhas&quot; the Provençal influence is clear; in the redondilhas it expanded the form, deepened the lyricism and introduced a theme, worked on antitheses and paradoxes, unknown in the old tradition of Cantigas de amigo, and the elegies are quite classicist. Its resorts follow an epistolary style, with moralizing themes. Eclogues are perfect pieces of the pastoral genre, derived from Virgil and the Italians. The influence of Spanish poetry by Garcilaso de la Vega, Jorge de Montemor, Juan Boscán, Gregorio Silvestre and several other names was also detected in many points of his lyric, as his commentator Faria e Sousa pointed out.

Despite the care of the first editor of &quot;Rimas&quot;, Fernão Rodrigues Lobo Soropita, in the 1595 edition, several apocryphal poems were included. Many poems were discovered over the next few centuries and attributed to him, but not always with careful critical analysis. The result was that, for example, while in the original Rhymes there were 65 sonnets, in the 1861 edition of Juromenha there were 352; in the 1953 edition of Aguiar e Silva 166 pieces were still listed. In addition, many editions modernized or &quot;embellished&quot; the original text, a practice that was particularly pronounced after the 1685 edition of Faria e Sousa, giving rise to and rooting a tradition of its own in this adulterated lesson that caused enormous difficulties for critical study. More scientific studies only began to be undertaken at the end of the 19th century, with the contribution of Wilhelm Storck and Carolina Michaëlis de Vasconcelos, who discarded several apocryphal compositions. At the beginning of the 20th century, work continued with José Maria Rodrigues and Afonso Lopes Vieira, who published Rimas in 1932 in an edition they called &quot;crítica&quot; (&quot;criticism&quot;), although it did not deserve the name: it adopted large parts of Faria and Sousa&#x27;s lesson, but editors claimed to have used the original editions, from 1595 and 1598. On the other hand, they definitely raised the issue of textual fraud that had been perpetuating for a long time and had tampered with the poems to the point of becoming unrecognizable. One example is enough:

*1595 edition: &quot;&quot;Aqui, ó Ninfas minhas, vos pintei / Todo de amores um jardim suave; / Das aves, pedras, águas vos contei, / Sem me ficar bonina, fera ou ave.&quot;
*1685 edition: &quot;Aqui, fremosas ninfas, vos pintei / Todo de amores um jardim suave; / De águas, de pedras, de árvores contei, / De flores, de almas, feras, de uma, outra ave.&quot;&quot;

It seems impossible to reach a definitive result in this purge. However, enough authentic material survives to guarantee his position as the best Portuguese lyricist and the greatest Renaissance poet in Portugal.
===Comedies===
The general content of his works for the stage combines, in the same way as in Os Lusíadas, nationalism and classic inspiration. His production in this field is limited to three works, all in the genre of comedy and in the format of self: &quot;El-Rei Seleuco&quot;, &quot;Filodemo&quot; and &quot;Anfitriões&quot;. The attribution of &quot;El-Rei Seleuco&quot; to Camões, however, is controversial. Its existence was not known until 1654, when it appeared published in the first part of Rimas in the Craesbeeck edition, which gave no details about its origin and had little care in editing the text. The play also differs in several aspects from the other two that survived, such as its much shorter length (an act), the existence of a prologue in prose, and the less profound and less erudite treatment of the love theme. The theme, of the complicated passion of Antiochus, son of King Seleucus I Nicator, for his stepmother, Queen Estratonice, was taken from a historical fact from Antiquity transmitted by Plutarch and repeated by Petrarch and the Spanish popular songwriter, working it in the style by Gil Vicente.

&quot;Anfitriões&quot;, published in 1587, is an adaptation of Plautus&#x27; Amphitryon, where it emphasizes the comic character of the Amphitryon myth, highlighting the omnipotence of love, which subdues even the immortals, also following the Vincentian tradition. The play was written in smaller &quot;redondilhas&quot; and uses bilingualism, using Castilian in the lines of the character Sósia, a slave, to mark his low social level in passages that reach the grotesque, a feature that appears in the other pieces as well. &quot;Filodemo&quot;, composed in India and dedicated to the viceroy D. Francisco Barreto, is a comedy of morality in five acts, according to the classical division, being, of the three, the one that remained most alive in the interest of the critic due to the multiplicity of human experiences it describes and for the sharpness of psychological observation. The theme is about the love of a servant, Filodemo, for the daughter, Dionisa, of the nobleman in the house of the one he serves, with autobiographical traits. Camões saw comedy as a secondary genre, of interest only as a diversion of circumstance, but he achieved significant results by transferring the comicality of the characters to the action and refining the plot, so he pointed out a path for the renewal of Portuguese comedy. However, his suggestion was not followed by the growers of the genus who succeeded him.

== Expansion of fame beyond Portugal ==
According to Monteiro, of the great epic poets of the west, Camões remains the least known outside his homeland and his masterpiece, Os Lusíadas, is the least known of the great poems in the style. However, from the time he lived and throughout the centuries after Camões was praised by several non-Lusophone luminaries of Western culture. Torquato Tasso, who claimed that Camões was the only rival he feared, dedicated a sonnet to him, Baltasar Gracián praised his sharpness and ingenuity, as did Lope de Vega. Cervantes – stated that he saw Camões as the &quot;singer of Western civilization.&quot; He was an influence on the work of John Milton and several other English poets, Goethe recognized his eminence, Sir Richard Burton considered him a master, Friedrich Schlegel called him the ultimate exponent of creation in epic poetry, opining that the &quot;perfection&quot; [Vollendung] of Portuguese poetry was evident in his &quot;beautiful poems,&quot; Humboldt regarded him as an admirable painter of nature. August-Wilhelm Schlegel wrote that Camões, by itself, is worth entire literary works.

Camões&#x27; fame began to spread across Spain, where he had several admirers since the 16th century, with two translations of Os Lusíadas appearing in 1580, the year of the poet&#x27;s death, possibly printed at the behest of Philip II of Spain, who at the time was also the king of Portugal. In Luis Gómez de Tápia&#x27;s edition, Camões is already mentioned as &quot;famous&quot;, and in Benito Caldera&#x27;s he was compared to Virgil. In addition, the king granted him the honorific title of &quot;Prince of the Poets of Spain,&quot; which was printed in one of the translations. Philip was perfectly aware of the advantages of using an already established culture for his own purposes rather than suppressing it. As the son of a Portuguese princess, he had no interest in annulling the Portuguese identity or its cultural achievements, and it was to his advantage to assimilate the poet into the Spanish orbit, both to ensure his legitimacy as sovereign of the united crowns, and to enhance the brilliance of Spanish culture.

Soon his fame would reach Italy; Tasso called his work &quot;cult and good&quot; and by 1658 Os Lusíadas would be translated twice, by Oliveira and Paggi. Later, associated with Tasso, it became an important paradigm in Italian Romanticism. By this time in Portugal, a body of exegetes and commentators had already been formed, giving the study of Camões great depth. In 1655 Os Lusíadas arrived in England in Fanshawe&#x27;s translation, but would only gain notoriety there about a century later, with the publication of William Julius Mickle&#x27;s poetic version in 1776, which, although successful, did not prevent the emergence of another dozen English translations until the end of the 19th century. It arrived in France at the beginning of the 18th century, when Castera published a translation of the epic. Voltaire criticized certain aspects of the work, namely its lack of unity in action and the mixture of Christian and pagan mythology, but he also admired the novelties it introduced in relation to other epics, contributing powerfully to its popularity. Montesquieu stated that Camões&#x27; poem had something of the charm of the Odyssey and the magnificence of the Aeneid. Between 1735 and 1874 no less than twenty French translations of the book appeared, not counting numerous second editions and paraphrases of some of the most striking episodes. In 1777 Pieterszoon translated Os Lusíadas into Dutch and by the 19th century, five more partial translations had appeared.

<text>Dale County is a county located in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census the population was 49,326. Its county seat and largest city is Ozark. Its name is in honor of General Samuel Dale.

Dale County comprises the Ozark, AL Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Dothan-Ozark, AL Combined Statistical Area. It was originally a part of Enterprise–Ozark micropolitan area before being split, and for a longer while was originally part of the Dothan-Enterprise-Ozark combined statistical area but Coffee County is now its own separate primary statistical area in later censuses.

The vast majority of Fort Novosel (formerly Fort Rucker) is located in Dale County.

==History==
The area now known as Dale County was originally inhabited by members of the Creek Indian nation, who occupied all of southeastern Alabama during this period. Between the years of 1764 and 1783 this region fell under the jurisdiction of the colony of British West Florida. The county, together with the surrounding area, was ceded to the United States in the 1814 Treaty of Fort Jackson, ending the Creek Indian Wars. A blockhouse had been constructed during the conflict on the northwestern side of the Choctawhatchee River, and the first non-Indian residents of Dale County would be veterans who began to settle in the area around 1820.

Dale County was established on December 22, 1824. It originally included the whole of what is now Coffee County and Geneva County, together with the &quot;panhandle&quot; portion of Houston County. The original county seat was located at Dale&#x27;s Court House (now the town of Daleville), but when Coffee County split from Dale in 1841, the seat was moved to Newton. Here it remained until 1870 when, following a courthouse fire in 1869 and the formation of Geneva County (which took the southern third of Dale County), the county seat was moved to the town of Ozark, where it remains. In 1903 a small portion of the southeast part of Dale county was joined to the newly formed Houston County.

Portions of the 15th Regiment of Alabama Infantry, which served with great distinction throughout the U.S. Civil War, were recruited in Dale County, with all of Co. &quot;E&quot; and part of Co. &quot;H&quot; being composed of Dale County residents. This unit is most famous for being the regiment that confronted the 20th Maine on the Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Despite several ferocious assaults, the 15th was ultimately unable to dislodge the Union troops, and was ultimately forced to retreat after a desperate bayonet charge led by the 20th Maine&#x27;s commander, Col. Joshua L. Chamberlain. This assault was vividly recreated in Ronald F. Maxwell&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;Gettysburg&quot;. The 15th would continue to serve until the final capitulation of Lee&#x27;s army at Appomattox Court House in 1865.

Another regiment recruited largely from Dale County was the 33rd Alabama; Companies B, G and I were recruited in the county, with Co. G coming from Daleville; Co. B from Newton, Skipperville, Clopton, Echo and Barnes Cross Roads; and o. I from Newton, Haw Ridge, Rocky Head, Westville and Ozark. This regiment fought with great distinction in the Army of Tennessee, mostly under famed General Patrick Cleburne, once winning the Thanks of the Confederate Congress for its action at Ringgold Gap. The regiment was largely annihilated during the battles of Perryville and Franklin, but a few men survived and returned to Dale County after the war.

However four municipalities have their own school districts: Daleville City School District, Dothan City School District, Enterprise City School District, and Ozark City School District. Additionally residents of Fort Novosel are assigned to schools operated by the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), for elementary school.
Students beyond the elementary level at Fort Novosel may attend non-DoDEA schools for secondary levels, with an on-post family choosing one of the following three options: Daleville City, Enterprise City, or Ozark City.

<doc id="77385" wikidata="Q143429" url="?curid=77385" title="Polyethylene">
<text>Polyethylene or polythene (abbreviated PE; IUPAC name polyethene or poly(methylene)) is the most commonly produced plastic. It is a polymer, primarily used for packaging (plastic bags, plastic films, geomembranes and containers including bottles, cups, jars, etc.). , over 100 million tonnes of polyethylene resins are being produced annually, accounting for 34% of the total plastics market.

Many kinds of polyethylene are known, with most having the chemical formula (C2H4)&quot;n&quot;. PE is usually a mixture of similar polymers of ethylene, with various values of &quot;n&quot;. It can be &quot;low-density&quot; or &quot;high-density&quot; and many variations thereof. Its properties can be modified further by crosslinking or copolymerization. All forms are nontoxic as well as chemically resilient, contributing to polyethylene&#x27;s popularity as a multi-use plastic. However, polyethylene&#x27;s chemical resilience also makes it a long-lived and decomposition-resistant pollutant when disposed of improperly. Being a hydrocarbon, polyethylene is colorless to opaque (without impurities or colorants) and combustible. 
==History==
Polyethylene was first synthesized by the German chemist Hans von Pechmann, who prepared it by accident in 1898 while investigating diazomethane. When his colleagues Eugen Bamberger and Friedrich Tschirner characterized the white, waxy substance that he had created, they recognized that it contained long −CH2− chains and termed it &quot;polymethylene&quot;.
The first industrially practical polyethylene synthesis (diazomethane is a notoriously unstable substance that is generally avoided in industrial syntheses) was again accidentally discovered in 1933 by Eric Fawcett and Reginald Gibson at the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) works in Northwich, England. Upon applying extremely high pressure (several hundred atmospheres) to a mixture of ethylene and benzaldehyde they again produced a white, waxy material. Because the reaction had been initiated by trace oxygen contamination in their apparatus, the experiment was difficult to reproduce at first. It was not until 1935 that another ICI chemist, Michael Perrin, developed this accident into a reproducible high-pressure synthesis for polyethylene that became the basis for industrial low-density polyethylene (LDPE) production beginning in 1939. Because polyethylene was found to have very low-loss properties at very high frequency radio waves, commercial distribution in Britain was suspended on the outbreak of World War II, secrecy imposed, and the new process was used to produce insulation for UHF and SHF coaxial cables of radar sets. During World War II, further research was done on the ICI process and in 1944, DuPont at Sabine River, Texas, and Union Carbide Corporation at South Charleston, West Virginia, began large-scale commercial production under license from ICI.

The landmark breakthrough in the commercial production of polyethylene began with the development of catalysts that promoted the polymerization at mild temperatures and pressures. The first of these was a catalyst based on chromium trioxide discovered in 1951 by Robert Banks and J. Paul Hogan at Phillips Petroleum. In 1953 the German chemist Karl Ziegler developed a catalytic system based on titanium halides and organoaluminium compounds that worked at even milder conditions than the Phillips catalyst. The Phillips catalyst is less expensive and easier to work with, however, and both methods are heavily used industrially. By the end of the 1950s both the Phillips- and Ziegler-type catalysts were being used for high-density polyethylene (HDPE) production. In the 1970s, the Ziegler system was improved by the incorporation of magnesium chloride. Catalytic systems based on soluble catalysts, the metallocenes, were reported in 1976 by Walter Kaminsky and Hansjörg Sinn. The Ziegler- and metallocene-based catalysts families have proven to be very flexible at copolymerizing ethylene with other olefins and have become the basis for the wide range of polyethylene resins available today, including very-low-density polyethylene and linear low-density polyethylene. Such resins, in the form of UHMWPE fibers, have (as of 2005) begun to replace aramids in many high-strength applications.

==Properties==
The properties of polyethylene depend strongly on type. The molecular weight, crosslinking, and presence of comonomers all strongly affect its properties. It is for this structure-property relation that intense effort has been invested into diverse kinds of PE. LDPE is softer and more transparent than HDPE. For medium- and high-density polyethylene the melting point is typically in the range . The melting point for average commercial low-density polyethylene is typically . These temperatures vary strongly with the type of polyethylene, but the theoretical upper limit of melting of polyethylene is reported to be . Combustion typically occurs above .

Most LDPE, MDPE, and HDPE grades have excellent chemical resistance, meaning that they are not attacked by strong acids or strong bases and are resistant to gentle oxidants and reducing agents. Crystalline samples do not dissolve at room temperature. Polyethylene (other than cross-linked polyethylene) usually can be dissolved at elevated temperatures in aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene or xylene, or in chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethane or trichlorobenzene.

Polyethylene absorbs almost no water; the gas and water vapour permeability (only polar gases) is lower than for most plastics. Oxygen, carbon dioxide and flavorings, on the other hand, can pass it easily.

Polyethylene burns slowly with a blue flame having a yellow tip and gives off an odour of paraffin (similar to candle flame). The material continues burning on removal of the flame source and produces a drip.

Polyethylene cannot be imprinted or bonded with adhesives without pretreatment. High-strength joints are readily achieved with plastic welding.

===Electrical===
Polyethylene is a good electrical insulator. It offers good electrical treeing resistance; however, it becomes easily electrostatically charged (which can be reduced by additions of graphite, carbon black or antistatic agents).
When pure, the dielectric constant is in the range 2.2 to 2.4 depending on the density and the loss tangent is very low, making it a good dielectric for building capacitors. For the same reason it is commonly used as the insulation material for high-frequency coaxial and twisted pair cables.

===Optical ===
Depending on thermal history and film thickness, PE can vary between almost clear (transparent), milky-opaque (translucent) and opaque. LDPE has the greatest, LLDPE slightly less, and HDPE the least transparency. Transparency is reduced by crystallites if they are larger than the wavelength of visible light.

==Manufacturing process==

===Monomer===

The ingredient or monomer is ethylene (IUPAC name ethene), a gaseous hydrocarbon with the formula C2H4, which can be viewed as a pair of methylene groups (−−) connected to each other. Typical specifications for PE purity are &lt;5 ppm for water, oxygen, and other alkenes contents. Acceptable contaminants include N2, ethane (common precursor to ethylene), and methane. Ethylene is usually produced from petrochemical sources, but is also generated by dehydration of ethanol.

===Polymerization===

Polymerization of ethylene to polyethylene is described by the following chemical equation:

: (gas) → − (solid)Δ/ = 

Ethylene is a stable molecule that polymerizes only upon contact with catalysts. The conversion is highly exothermic. Coordination polymerization is the most pervasive technology, which means that metal chlorides or metal oxides are used. The most common catalysts consist of titanium(III) chloride, the so-called Ziegler–Natta catalysts. Another common catalyst is the Phillips catalyst, prepared by depositing chromium(VI) oxide on silica. Polyethylene can be produced through radical polymerization, but this route has only limited utility and typically requires high-pressure apparatus.

==Joining==

Commonly used methods for joining polyethylene parts together include:

* Welding
** Hot gas welding
** Infrared welding
** Laser welding
** Ultrasonic welding
** Heat sealing
** Heat fusion
* Fastening
* Adhesives 
** Pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSAs) 
*** Dispersion of solvent-type PSAs
** Polyurethane contact adhesives
** Two-part polyurethane
** Epoxy adhesives
** Hot-melt adhesives
** Solvent bonding – Adhesives and solvents are rarely used as solvent bonding because polyethylene is nonpolar and has a high resistance to solvents. 
Pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA) are feasible if the surface chemistry or charge is modified with plasma activation, flame treatment, or corona treatment.

==Classification==
Polyethylene is classified by its density and branching. Its mechanical properties depend significantly on variables such as the extent and type of branching, the crystal structure, and the molecular weight. There are several types of polyethylene:

*Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE)
*Ultra-low-molecular-weight polyethylene (ULMWPE or PE-WAX)
*High-molecular-weight polyethylene (HMWPE)
*High-density polyethylene (HDPE)
*High-density cross-linked polyethylene (HDXLPE)
*Cross-linked polyethylene (PEX or XLPE)

With regard to sold volumes, the most important polyethylene grades are HDPE, LLDPE, and LDPE.

===Ultra-high-molecular-weight (UHMWPE)===
UHMWPE is polyethylene with a molecular weight numbering in the millions, usually between 3.5 and 7.5 million amu. The high molecular weight makes it a very tough material, but results in less efficient packing of the chains into the crystal structure as evidenced by densities of less than high-density polyethylene (for example, 0.930–0.935 g/cm3). UHMWPE can be made through any catalyst technology, although Ziegler catalysts are most common. Because of its outstanding toughness and its cut, wear, and excellent chemical resistance, UHMWPE is used in a diverse range of applications. These include can- and bottle-handling machine parts, moving parts on weaving machines, bearings, gears, artificial joints, edge protection on ice rinks, steel cable replacements on ships, and butchers&#x27; chopping boards. It is commonly used for the construction of articular portions of implants used for hip and knee replacements. As fiber, it competes with aramid in bulletproof vests.

===High-density (HDPE)===
HDPE is defined by a density of greater or equal to 0.941 g/cm3. HDPE has a low degree of branching. The mostly linear molecules pack together well, so intermolecular forces are stronger than in highly branched polymers. HDPE can be produced by chromium/silica catalysts, Ziegler–Natta catalysts or metallocene catalysts; by choosing catalysts and reaction conditions, the small amount of branching that does occur can be controlled. These catalysts prefer the formation of free radicals at the ends of the growing polyethylene molecules. They cause new ethylene monomers to add to the ends of the molecules, rather than along the middle, causing the growth of a linear chain.

HDPE has high tensile strength. It is used in products and packaging such as milk jugs, detergent bottles, butter tubs, garbage containers, and water pipes.

===Cross-linked (PEX or XLPE)===

PEX is a medium- to high-density polyethylene containing cross-link bonds introduced into the polymer structure, changing the thermoplastic into a thermoset. The high-temperature properties of the polymer are improved, its flow is reduced, and its chemical resistance is enhanced. PEX is used in some potable-water plumbing systems because tubes made of the material can be expanded to fit over a metal nipple and it will slowly return to its original shape, forming a permanent, water-tight connection.

===Medium-density (MDPE)===

MDPE is defined by a density range of 0.926–0.940 g/cm3. MDPE can be produced by chromium/silica catalysts, Ziegler–Natta catalysts, or metallocene catalysts. MDPE has good shock and drop resistance properties. It also is less notch-sensitive than HDPE; stress-cracking resistance is better than HDPE. MDPE is typically used in gas pipes and fittings, sacks, shrink film, packaging film, carrier bags, and screw closures.

===Linear low-density (LLDPE)===

LLDPE is defined by a density range of 0.915–0.925 g/cm3. LLDPE is a substantially linear polymer with significant numbers of short branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with short-chain alpha-olefins (for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene, and 1-octene). LLDPE has higher tensile strength than LDPE, and it exhibits higher impact and puncture resistance than LDPE. Lower-thickness (gauge) films can be blown, compared with LDPE, with better environmental stress cracking resistance, but they are not as easy to process. LLDPE is used in packaging, particularly film for bags and sheets. Lower thickness may be used compared to LDPE. It is used for cable coverings, toys, lids, buckets, containers, and pipe. While other applications are available, LLDPE is used predominantly in film applications due to its toughness, flexibility, and relative transparency. Product examples range from agricultural films, Saran wrap, and bubble wrap to multilayer and composite films.
===Low-density (LDPE)===

LDPE is defined by a density range of 0.910–0.940 g/cm3. LDPE has a high degree of short- and long-chain branching, which means that the chains do not pack into the crystal structure as well. It has, therefore, less strong intermolecular forces as the instantaneous-dipole induced-dipole attraction is less. This results in a lower tensile strength and increased ductility. LDPE is created by free-radical polymerization. The high degree of branching with long chains gives molten LDPE unique and desirable flow properties. LDPE is used for both rigid containers and plastic film applications such as plastic bags and film wrap.

The radical polymerization process used to make LDPE does not include a catalyst that &quot;supervises&quot; the radical sites on the growing PE chains. (In HDPE synthesis, the radical sites are at the ends of the PE chains, because the catalyst stabilizes their formation at the ends.) Secondary radicals (in the middle of a chain) are more stable than primary radicals (at the end of the chain), and tertiary radicals (at a branch point) are more stable yet. Each time an ethylene monomer is added, it creates a primary radical, but often these will rearrange to form more stable secondary or tertiary radicals. Addition of ethylene monomers to the secondary or tertiary sites creates branching.

===Very-low-density (VLDPE)===
VLDPE is defined by a density range of 0.880–0.915 g/cm3. VLDPE is a substantially linear polymer with high levels of short-chain branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with short-chain alpha-olefins (for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene). VLDPE is most commonly produced using metallocene catalysts due to the greater co-monomer incorporation exhibited by these catalysts. VLDPEs are used for hose and tubing, ice and frozen food bags, food packaging and stretch wrap as well as impact modifiers when blended with other polymers.

Much research activity has focused on the nature and distribution of long chain branches in polyethylene. In HDPE, a relatively small number of these branches, perhaps one in 100 or 1,000 branches per backbone carbon, can significantly affect the rheological properties of the polymer.

===Copolymers===
In addition to copolymerization with alpha-olefins, ethylene can be copolymerized with a wide range of other monomers and ionic composition that creates ionized free radicals. Common examples include vinyl acetate (the resulting product is ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, or EVA, widely used in athletic-shoe sole foams) and a variety of acrylates. Applications of acrylic copolymer include packaging and sporting goods, and superplasticizer, used in cement production.

=== Types of polyethylenes ===
The particular material properties of &quot;polyethylene&quot; depend on its molecular structure. Molecular weight and crystallinity are the most significant factors; crystallinity in turn depends on molecular weight and degree of branching. The less the polymer chains are branched, and the lower the molecular weight, the higher the crystallinity of polyethylene. Crystallinity ranges from 35% (PE-LD/PE-LLD) to 80% (PE-HD). Polyethylene has a density of 1.0 g/cm3 in crystalline regions and 0.86 g/cm3 in amorphous regions. An almost linear relationship exists between density and crystallinity.

The degree of branching of the different types of polyethylene can be schematically represented as follows:

The figure shows polyethylene backbones, short-chain branches and side-chain branches. The polymer chains are represented linearly.

=== Chain branches ===
The properties of polyethylene are highly dependent on type and number of chain branches. The chain branches in turn depend on the process used: either the high-pressure process (only PE-LD) or the low-pressure process (all other PE grades). Low-density polyethylene is produced by the high-pressure process by radical polymerization, thereby numerous short chain branches as well as long chain branches are formed. Short chain branches are formed by intramolecular chain transfer reactions, they are always butyl or ethyl chain branches because the reaction proceeds after the following mechanism:

==Environmental issues==

The widespread usage of polyethylene poses potential difficulties for waste management because it is not readily biodegradable. Since 2008, Japan has increased plastic recycling, but still has a large amount of plastic wrapping which goes to waste. Plastic recycling in Japan is a potential US$90 billion market. 

It is possible to rapidly convert polyethylene to hydrogen and graphene by heating. The energy needed is much less than for producing hydrogen by electrolysis.

===Biodegradability===
Several experiments have been conducted aimed at discovering enzyme or organisms that will degrade polyethylene. Several plastics - polyesters, polycarbonates, polyamides - degrade either by hydrolysis or air oxidation. In some cases the degradation is increased by bacteria or various enzyme cocktails. The situation is very different with polymers where the backbone consists solely of C-C bonds. These polymers include polyethylene, but also polypropylene, polystyrene and acrylates. At best, these polymers degrade very slowly, but these experiments are difficult because yields and rates are very slow. Further confusing the situation, even preliminary successes are greeted with enthusiasm by the popular press. Some technical challenges in this area include the failure to identify enzymes responsible for the proposed degradation. Another issue is that organisms are incapable of importing hydrocarbons of molecular weight greater than 500.

===Bacteria and insect case studies===
The Indian mealmoth larvae are claimed to metabolize polyethylene based on observing that plastic bags at a researcher&#x27;s home had small holes in them. Deducing that the hungry larvae must have digested the plastic somehow, he and his team analyzed their gut bacteria and found a few that could use plastic as their only carbon source. Not only could the bacteria from the guts of the &quot;Plodia interpunctella&quot; moth larvae metabolize polyethylene, they degraded it significantly, dropping its tensile strength by 50%, its mass by 10% and the molecular weights of its polymeric chains by 13%.

The caterpillar of &quot;Galleria mellonella&quot; is claimed to consume polyethylene. The caterpillar is able to digest polyethylene due to a combination of its gut microbiota and its saliva containing enzymes that oxidise and depolymerise the plastic.

=== Climate change ===
When exposed to ambient solar radiation the plastic produces trace amounts of two greenhouse gases, methane and ethylene. The plastic type which releases gases at the highest rate is low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Due to its low density it breaks down more easily over time, leading to higher surface areas. When incubated in air, LDPE emits gases at rates ~2 times and ~76 times higher in comparison to incubation in water for methane and ethylene, respectively. However, based on the rates measured in the study methane production by plastics is presently an insignificant component of the global methane budget.

== Chemically modified polyethylene ==
Polyethylene may either be modified in the polymerization by polar or non-polar comonomers or after polymerization through polymer-analogous reactions. Common polymer-analogous reactions are in case of polyethylene crosslinking, chlorination and sulfochlorination.

=== Non-polar ethylene copolymers ===

==== α-olefins ====
In the low pressure process α-olefins (e.g. 1-butene or 1-hexene) may be added, which are incorporated in the polymer chain during polymerization. These copolymers introduce short side chains, thus crystallinity and density are reduced. As explained above, mechanical and thermal properties are changed thereby. In particular, PE-LLD is produced this way.

==== Metallocene polyethylene (PE-MC) ====
Metallocene polyethylene (PE-M) is prepared by means of metallocene catalysts, usually including copolymers (z. B. ethene / hexene). Metallocene polyethylene has a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution, exceptionally high toughness, excellent optical properties and a uniform comonomer content. Because of the narrow molecular weight distribution it behaves less pseudoplastic (especially under larger shear rates). Metallocene polyethylene has a low proportion of low molecular weight (extractable) components and a low welding and sealing temperature. Thus, it is particularly suitable for the food industry.

====Polyethylene with multimodal molecular weight distribution====
Polyethylene with multimodal molecular weight distribution consists of several polymer fractions, which are homogeneously mixed. Such polyethylene types offer extremely high stiffness, toughness, strength, stress crack resistance and an increased crack propagation resistance. They consist of equal proportions higher and lower molecular polymer fractions. The lower molecular weight units crystallize easier and relax faster. The higher molecular weight fractions form linking molecules between crystallites, thereby increasing toughness and stress crack resistance. Polyethylene with multimodal molecular weight distribution can be prepared either in two-stage reactors, by catalysts with two active centers on a carrier or by blending in extruders.

==== Cyclic olefin copolymers (COC) ====
Cyclic olefin copolymers are prepared by copolymerization of ethene and cycloolefins (usually norbornene) produced by using metallocene catalysts. The resulting polymers are amorphous polymers and particularly transparent and heat resistant.

=== Polar ethylene copolymers ===
The basic compounds used as polar comonomers are vinyl alcohol (Ethenol, an unsaturated alcohol), acrylic acid (propenoic acid, an unsaturated acid) and esters containing one of the two compounds.

==== Ethylene copolymers with unsaturated alcohols ====
Ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) is (formally) a copolymer of PE and vinyl alcohol (ethenol), which is prepared by (partial) hydrolysis of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (as vinyl alcohol itself is not stable). However, typically EVOH has a higher comonomer content than the VAC commonly used.

EVOH is used in multilayer films for packaging as a barrier layer (barrier plastic). As EVOH is hygroscopic (water-attracting), it absorbs water from the environment, whereby it loses its barrier effect. Therefore, it must be used as a core layer surrounded by other plastics (like LDPE, PP, PA or PET). EVOH is also used as a coating agent against corrosion at street lights, traffic light poles and noise protection walls.

==== Ethylene/acrylic acid copolymers (EAA) ====
Copolymer of ethylene and unsaturated carboxylic acids (such as acrylic acid) are characterized by good adhesion to diverse materials, by resistance to stress cracking and high flexibility. However, they are more sensitive to heat and oxidation than ethylene homopolymers. Ethylene/acrylic acid copolymers are used as adhesion promoters.

If salts of an unsaturated carboxylic acid are present in the polymer, thermo-reversible ion networks are formed, they are called ionomers. Ionomers are highly transparent thermoplastics which are characterized by high adhesion to metals, high abrasion resistance and high water absorption.

=== Ethylene copolymers with unsaturated esters ===
If unsaturated esters are copolymerized with ethylene, either the alcohol moiety may be in the polymer backbone (as it is the case in ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer) or of the acid moiety (e. g. in ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer). Ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers are prepared similarly to LD-PE by high pressure polymerization. The proportion of comonomer has a decisive influence on the behaviour of the polymer.

The density decreases up to a comonomer share of 10% because of the disturbed crystal formation. With higher proportions it approaches to the one of polyvinyl acetate (1.17 g/cm3). Due to decreasing crystallinity ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers are getting softer with increasing comonomer content. The polar side groups change the chemical properties significantly (compared to polyethylene): weather resistance, adhesiveness and weldability rise with comonomer content, while the chemical resistance decreases. Also mechanical properties are changed: stress cracking resistance and toughness in the cold rise, whereas yield stress and heat resistance decrease. With a very high proportion of comonomers (about 50%) rubbery thermoplastics are produced (thermoplastic elastomers).

Ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymers behave similarly to ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers.

=== Crosslinking ===

A basic distinction is made between peroxide crosslinking (PE-Xa), silane crosslinking (PE-Xb), electron beam crosslinking (PE-Xc) and azo crosslinking (PE-Xd).

*Peroxide crosslinking (PE-Xa): The crosslinking of polyethylene using peroxides (e. g. dicumyl or di-tert-butyl peroxide) is still of major importance. In the so-called &quot;Engel process&quot;, a mixture of HDPE and 2% peroxide is at first mixed at low temperatures in an extruder and then crosslinked at high temperatures (between 200 and 250 °C). The peroxide decomposes to peroxide radicals (RO•), which abstract (remove) hydrogen atoms from the polymer chain, leading to radicals. When these combine, a crosslinked network is formed. The resulting polymer network is uniform, of low tension and high flexibility, whereby it is softer and tougher than (the irradiated) PE-Xc.
*Silane crosslinking (PE-Xb): In the presence of silanes (e.g. trimethoxyvinylsilane) polyethylene can initially be Si-functionalized by irradiation or by a small amount of a peroxide. Later Si-OH groups can be formed in a water bath by hydrolysis, which condense then and crosslink the PE by the formation of Si-O-Si bridges. [16] Catalysts such as dibutyltin dilaurate may accelerate the reaction.
*Irradiation crosslinking (PE-Xc): The crosslinking of polyethylene is also possible by a downstream radiation source (usually an electron accelerator, occasionally an isotopic radiator). PE products are crosslinked below the crystalline melting point by splitting off hydrogen atoms. β-radiation possesses a penetration depth of 10 mm, ɣ-radiation 100 mm. Thereby the interior or specific areas can be excluded from the crosslinking. However, due to high capital and operating costs radiation crosslinking plays only a minor role compared with the peroxide crosslinking. In contrast to peroxide crosslinking, the process is carried out in the solid state. Thereby, the cross-linking takes place primarily in the amorphous regions, while the crystallinity remains largely intact.
*Azo crosslinking (PE-Xd): In the so-called &quot;Lubonyl process&quot; polyethylene is crosslinked preadded azo compounds after extrusion in a hot salt bath.

===Chlorination and sulfochlorination===
Chlorinated Polyethylene (PE-C) is an inexpensive material having a chlorine content from 34 to 44%. It is used in blends with PVC because the soft, rubbery chloropolyethylene is embedded in the PVC matrix, thereby increasing the impact resistance. It also increases the weather resistance. Furthermore, it is used for softening PVC foils, without risking the migrate of plasticizers. Chlorinated polyethylene can be crosslinked peroxidically to form an elastomer which is used in cable and rubber industry. When chlorinated polyethylene is added to other polyolefins, it reduces the flammability.

Chlorosulfonated PE (CSM) is used as starting material for ozone-resistant synthetic rubber.

===Bio-based polyethylene===
Braskem and Toyota Tsusho Corporation started joint marketing activities to produce polyethylene from sugarcane. Braskem will build a new facility at their existing industrial unit in Triunfo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil with an annual production capacity of , and will produce high-density and low-density polyethylene from bioethanol derived from sugarcane.

==Nomenclature and general description of the process==
The name polyethylene comes from the ingredient and not the resulting chemical compound, which contains no double bonds. The scientific name &quot;polyethene&quot; is systematically derived from the scientific name of the monomer. The alkene monomer converts to a long, sometimes &quot;very&quot; long, alkane in the polymerization process. In certain circumstances it is useful to use a structure-based nomenclature; in such cases IUPAC recommends poly(methylene) (poly(methanediyl) is a non-preferred alternative). The difference in names between the two systems is due to the &quot;opening up&quot; of the monomer&#x27;s double bond upon polymerization. The name is abbreviated to &quot;PE&quot;. In a similar manner polypropylene and polystyrene are shortened to PP and PS, respectively. In the United Kingdom and India the polymer is commonly called &quot;polythene&quot;, from the ICI trade name, although this is not recognized scientifically.

<doc id="77390" wikidata="Q180919" url="?curid=77390" title="Natalie Wood">
<text>Natalie Wood (née Zacharenko; July 20, 1938 – November 29, 1981) was an American actress. She began acting at age four and co-starred at age eight in &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (1947). As a teenager, she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955), followed by a role in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956). Wood starred in the musical films &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961) and &quot;Gypsy&quot; (1962) and received nominations for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performances in &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; (1961) and &quot;Love with the Proper Stranger&quot; (1963). Her career continued with films such as &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot; (1964), &quot;The Great Race&quot; (1965), &quot;Inside Daisy Clover&quot; (1965), &quot;This Property Is Condemned&quot; (1966), and &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot; (1969).

During the 1970s, Wood began a hiatus from film and had two daughters: one with her second husband Richard Gregson, and one with Robert Wagner, her first husband whom she married again after divorcing Gregson. She acted in only two feature films throughout the decade, but she appeared slightly more often in television productions, including a remake of &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1979) for which she won a Golden Globe Award. Wood&#x27;s films represented a &quot;coming of age&quot; for her and for Hollywood films in general. Critics have suggested that her cinematic career represents a portrait of modern American womanhood in transition, as she was one of the few to take both child roles and those of middle-aged characters.

On November 29, 1981, at the age of 43, Wood drowned in the Pacific Ocean at Santa Catalina Island during a break from production of her would-be comeback film &quot;Brainstorm&quot; (1983). She was with her husband Wagner and &quot;Brainstorm&quot; co-star Christopher Walken. The events surrounding her death have been the subject of conflicting witness statements, prompting the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, under the instruction of the coroner&#x27;s office, to list her cause of death as &quot;drowning and other undetermined factors&quot; in 2012. In 2018, Wagner was named as a person of interest in the ongoing investigation into her death.

==Early life==
Wood was born Natalie Zacharenko in San Francisco, California on July 20, 1938, to Maria Zoudilova (sometimes transliterated Zoodiloff; 1908–1998) and second husband Nicholas Zacharenko (1912–1980). She was of Russian and Ukrainian descent and raised in the Russian Orthodox religion. Her mother (who also used the names Mary, Marie, and Musia) was from Barnaul. Wood&#x27;s maternal grandfather owned soap and candle factories, as well as an estate outside Barnaul. With the start of the Russian Civil War, his family fled Russia for China, settling as refugees in Harbin. Her mother was previously married to Armenian mechanic Alexander Tatuloff from 1925 to 1936. They had a daughter named Olga (1928–2015) and moved to America by ship in 1930 before divorcing six years later.

Wood&#x27;s father was a carpenter from Ussuriysk. Her paternal grandfather, a chocolate factory employee who joined the anti-Bolshevik civilian forces during the war, was killed in a street fight between the Red Army and White Russian soldiers in Vladivostok. After that, his widow and three sons fled to Shanghai, subsequently relocating to Vancouver at the time of Wood&#x27;s paternal grandmother&#x27;s remarriage in 1927. By 1933, they moved to the United States. Her parents met while her mother was still married to Tatuloff. They were married in February 1938, five months before Wood was born. A year after Natalie&#x27;s birth, her father changed the family&#x27;s surname to Gurdin. In 1942, they bought a home in Santa Rosa, California, where Wood was noticed by members of a crew during a film shoot downtown. After she started acting as a child, RKO executives David Lewis and William Goetz changed her surname to &quot;Wood&quot; to make it more appealing to English-speaking audiences and as a tribute to filmmaker Sam Wood. Her only full sibling, sister Svetlana, was born in Santa Monica in 1946 and later also became an actress under the name Lana Wood.

==Child actress==
===Early roles===

Wood&#x27;s first appearance on screen came when she was just four years old in the March 1943 release of &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; based on the John Steinbeck book of the same name. Shortly thereafter, she was cast again in a fifteen-second scene in the film &quot;Happy Land&quot; (1943). Despite the brief parts, she became a favorite of the director of both films, Irving Pichel. He remained in contact with Wood&#x27;s family for two years, advising them when another role came up. The director telephoned Wood&#x27;s mother and asked her to bring her daughter to Los Angeles for a screen test. Wood&#x27;s mother became so excited that she &quot;packed the whole family off to Los Angeles to live,&quot; writes Harris. Wood&#x27;s father opposed the idea, but his wife&#x27;s &quot;overpowering ambition to make Natalie a star&quot; took priority. According to Wood&#x27;s younger sister Lana, Pichel &quot;discovered her and wanted to adopt her.&quot;

Wood, then seven years old, got the part. She played a post-World War II German orphan, opposite Orson Welles as Wood&#x27;s guardian and Claudette Colbert, in &quot;Tomorrow Is Forever&quot; (1946). When Wood was unable to cry on cue, her mother tore a butterfly to pieces in front of her to ensure she would sob for a scene. Welles later said that Wood was a born professional, &quot;so good, she was terrifying.&quot; He also said &quot;Natalie doesn&#x27;t act from the script, she acts from the heart.&quot;

Wood acted in another film directed by Pichel, &quot;The Bride Wore Boots&quot;, and went on to 20th Century Fox to play Gene Tierney&#x27;s daughter in &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot; (1947).

===&quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;===
Wood&#x27;s best-known film as a child was &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (1947), starring Maureen O&#x27;Hara and John Payne at Fox. She plays a cynical girl who comes to believe a kindly department store holiday-season employee portrayed by Edmund Gwenn is the real Santa Claus. The film has become a Christmas classic; Wood was counted among the top child stars in Hollywood after the film and was so popular that Macy&#x27;s invited her to appear in the store&#x27;s annual Thanksgiving Day parade.

Film historian John C. Tibbetts wrote that for the next few years following her success in &quot;Miracle&quot;, Wood played roles as a daughter in a series of family films: &quot;Driftwood&quot; (1947), at Republic; &quot;Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay!&quot; (1948); &quot;Chicken Every Sunday&quot; (1949); &quot;The Green Promise&quot; (1949); Fred MacMurray&#x27;s daughter in &quot;Father Was a Fullback&quot; (1949), with O&#x27;Hara; Margaret Sullavan&#x27;s daughter in &quot;No Sad Songs for Me&quot; (1950); the youngest sister in &quot;Our Very Own&quot; (1950); &quot;Never a Dull Moment&quot; (1950); James Stewart&#x27;s daughter in &quot;The Jackpot&quot; (1950); &quot;Dear Brat&quot; (1951); Joan Blondell&#x27;s neglected daughter in &quot;The Blue Veil&quot; (1951); &quot;The Rose Bowl Story&quot; (1952); &quot;Just for You&quot; (1952); and as the daughter of Bette Davis&#x27; character in &quot;The Star&quot; (1952). In all, Wood appeared in over twenty films as a child. She also appeared on television in episodes of &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot; and &quot;Chevron Theatre&quot;.

Because Wood was a minor during her early years as an actress, she received her primary education on the studio lots wherever she was contracted. California law required that until age 18, child actors had to spend at least three hours per day in the classroom, notes Harris. &quot;She was a straight A student&quot;, and one of the few child actors to excel at arithmetic. Director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who directed her in &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot; (1947), said that, &quot;In all my years in the business, I never met a smarter moppet.&quot; Wood remembered that period in her life, saying, &quot;I always felt guilty when I knew the crew was sitting around waiting for me to finish my three hours. As soon as the teacher let us go, I ran to the set as fast as I could.&quot;

Wood&#x27;s mother continued to play a significant role in her daughter&#x27;s early career, coaching her and micromanaging aspects of her career even after Wood acquired agents. As a child actress, Wood received significant media attention. By age nine, she had been named the &quot;most exciting juvenile motion picture star of the year&quot; by &quot;Parents&quot; magazine.

==Teen stardom==

In the 1953–54 television season, Wood played Ann Morrison, the teenage daughter in &quot;The Pride of the Family,&quot; an ABC situation comedy. She appeared as a teenager on episodes of &quot;The Pepsi-Cola Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Public Defender&quot;, &quot;Mayor of the Town&quot;, &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;, and &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, and also appeared in a TV version of &quot;Heidi&quot;. She described the &quot;GE Theater&quot; episode, &quot;Carnival&quot;, as one of the best things she ever did.

She had roles in the feature films &quot;The Silver Chalice&quot; (1954) and &quot;One Desire&quot; (1955).

===&quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;===
Wood successfully made the transition from child star to ingénue at age 16 when she co-starred with James Dean and Sal Mineo in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955), Nicholas Ray&#x27;s film about teenage rebellion. Wood had to sign to a long-term contract with Warner Bros. but she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She later said it was the first script she read that she actually wanted to do as opposed to being told to do by her parents; she also said her parents were opposed to her doing it. &quot;Until then I did what I was told,&quot; she said.

She continued to guest star on anthology TV shows like &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Camera Three&quot;, &quot;Kings Row&quot;, &quot;Studio 57&quot;, &quot;Warner Brothers Presents&quot;, and &quot;The Kaiser Aluminum Hour&quot;.

She had a small but crucial role in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956) and was the female lead in &quot;A Cry in the Night&quot; (1956).

===Tab Hunter and &quot;Marjorie Morningstar&quot;===
Wood graduated from Van Nuys High School in 1956. She signed with Warner Brothers and was kept busy during the remainder of the decade in many &quot;girlfriend&quot; roles, which she found unsatisfying.

The studio cast her in two films opposite Tab Hunter, hoping to turn the duo into a box-office draw that never materialized: &quot;The Burning Hills&quot; (1956), a Western, and &quot;The Girl He Left Behind&quot; (1956). She guest starred in episodes of &quot;Conflict&quot;.

Warner Bros. tried teaming her with Efrem Zimbalist Jr. in &quot;Bombers B-52&quot; (1957). Then she was given the lead in a prestigious project, &quot;Marjorie Morningstar&quot; (1958). As Marjorie Morningstar, Wood played the role of a young Jewish girl in New York City who has to deal with the social and religious expectations of her family as she tries to forge her own path and separate identity.

==Adult career==

Tibbetts observed that Wood&#x27;s characters in &quot;Rebel&quot;, &quot;Searchers&quot;, and &quot;Morningstar&quot; began to show her widening range of acting styles. Her former &quot;childlike sweetness&quot; was now being combined with a noticeable &quot;restlessness that was characteristic of the youth of the 1950s.&quot;

She was leading lady to Frank Sinatra in &quot;Kings Go Forth&quot; (1958) then refused roles and was put on suspension by Warners. This lasted for a year until February 1959. She returned to be leading lady to James Garner in &quot;Cash McCall&quot; (1960). After Wood appeared in the box office flop &quot;All the Fine Young Cannibals&quot; (1960), she lost momentum. Wood&#x27;s career was in a transition period, having until then consisted of roles as a child or as a teenager.

===&quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot;===
Biographer Suzanne Finstad wrote that a &quot;turning point&quot; in Wood&#x27;s life as an actress took place when she saw the film &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1951): &quot;She was transformed, in awe of director Elia Kazan and of Vivien Leigh&#x27;s performance… [who] became a role model for Natalie.&quot; &quot;Her roles raised the possibility that one&#x27;s sensitivity could mark a person as a kind of victim,&quot; noted Tibbetts.

After a &quot;series of bad films, her career was already in decline&quot;, according to author Douglas Rathgeb. She was then cast in Kazan&#x27;s &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; (1961) with Warren Beatty. Kazan wrote in his 1997 memoir that the &quot;sages&quot; of the film community declared her &quot;washed up&quot; as an actress, but he still wanted to interview her for his next film:

Kazan cast Wood as the female lead in &quot;Splendor&quot;, and her career rebounded. He felt that despite her earlier innocent roles, she had the talent and maturity to go beyond them. In the film, Beatty&#x27;s character was deprived of sexual love with Wood&#x27;s character, and as a result turns to another, &quot;looser&quot; girl. Wood&#x27;s character could not handle the betrayal and after a breakdown was committed to a mental institution. Kazan writes that he cast her in the role partly because he saw in Wood&#x27;s personality a &quot;true-blue quality with a wanton side that is held down by social pressure,&quot; adding that &quot;she clings to things with her eyes,&quot; a quality he found especially &quot;appealing.&quot;

Finstad felt that although Wood had never trained in method acting techniques, &quot;working with Kazan brought her to the greatest emotional heights of her career. The experience was exhilarating, but wrenching for Natalie, who faced her demons on &quot;Splendor.&quot;&quot; She adds that a scene in the film, as a result of &quot;Kazan&#x27;s wizardry… produced a hysteria in Natalie that may be her most powerful moment as an actress.&quot; Actor Gary Lockwood, who also performed in the film, felt that &quot;Kazan and Natalie were a terrific marriage, because you had this beautiful girl, and you had somebody that could get things out of her.&quot; Kazan&#x27;s favorite scene in the film was the last one, when Wood goes back to see her lost first love, Bud (Beatty). &quot;It&#x27;s terribly touching to me. I still like it when I see it,&quot; wrote Kazan. He added, &quot;I didn&#x27;t have to give her any direction for that final scene; she knew exactly how to play it.&quot;

For her performance in &quot;Splendor&quot;, Wood received nominations for the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

===&quot;West Side Story&quot;===
Wood played Maria, a restless Puerto Rican girl on the West Side of Manhattan, in &quot;West Side Story&quot;, Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise&#x27;s 1961 film of the stage musical, which was a critical and box-office success. Tibbetts wrote of similarities in her role in this film and the earlier &quot;Rebel.&quot; She was to represent the &quot;restlessness of American youth in the 1950s&quot;, expressed by youth gangs and juvenile delinquency, along with early rock and roll. Both films, he observes, were &quot;modern allegories based on the &#x27;Romeo and Juliet&#x27; theme, including private restlessness and public alienation. Where in &quot;Rebel&quot; she falls in love with the character played by James Dean, whose gang-like peers and violent temper alienated him from his family, in &quot;West Side Story&quot; she enters into a romance with a white former gang member whose threatening world of outcasts also alienated him from lawful behavior.&quot;

Although Wood&#x27;s singing in the film was voiced by Marni Nixon, &quot;West Side Story&quot; is still regarded as one of Wood&#x27;s best films.

===Peak years of stardom===
Wood sang when she starred in the film &quot;Gypsy&quot; (1962) alongside Rosalind Russell. Her appearance in that film led critic Pauline Kael to comment &quot;clever little Natalie Wood… [the] most machine-tooled of Hollywood ingénues.&quot;

At the age of 25, Wood received her third Academy Award nomination for &quot;Love with the Proper Stranger&quot; (1963), making Wood (along with Teresa Wright) the youngest person to score three Oscar nominations. This record was later broken by Jennifer Lawrence in 2013 and Saoirse Ronan in 2017, both of whom scored their third nominations at the age of 23.

Wood made two comedies with Tony Curtis: &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Great Race&quot; (1965), the latter with Jack Lemmon, and Peter Falk. In &quot;The Great Race&quot;, her ability to speak Russian was an asset given to her character Maggie DuBois, justifying the character&#x27;s recording the progress of the race across Siberia and entering the race at the beginning as a contestant.

Director Sydney Pollack was quoted as saying about Wood, &quot;When she was right for the part, there was no one better. She was a damn good actress.&quot; For &quot;Inside Daisy Clover&quot; (1965) and &quot;This Property Is Condemned&quot; (1966), both of which co-starred Robert Redford, Wood received Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress. In the mid 1960s she was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood along with Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn.
Although many of Wood&#x27;s films were commercially successful, at times her acting was criticized. In 1966, Wood was given &quot;the Harvard Lampoon&quot; award for being the &quot;Worst Actress of Last Year, This Year, and Next&quot;. She was the first person to attend and accept the award in person. &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; wrote she was &quot;quite a good sport&quot;.

===Personal struggles and career break===
Following a disappointing reception of &quot;Penelope&quot; (1966), Wood took a three-year hiatus from acting. She was announced for &quot;I Never Promised You a Rose Garden&quot; but she did not appear in it. Wood later said making &quot;Penelope&quot; was difficult for her. &quot;I broke out in hives and suffered anguish that was very real pain every day we shot&quot;, she recalled. &quot;Arthur Hiller, the director, kept saying, &#x27;Natalie, I think you&#x27;re resisting this film&#x27;, while I rolled around the floor in agony.&quot;

By 1966, Wood suffered emotionally and in an attempt to overcome her emotional problems, she sought professional therapy. She paid Warner Bros. $175,000 to cancel her contract and fired her entire support team: agents, managers, publicist, accountant, and attorneys. In the following years, Wood focused on her mental health, and began a relationship with Richard Gregson, whom she married in 1969.

===&quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot;===
After a three-year break from movies, Wood co-starred with Dyan Cannon, Robert Culp and Elliott Gould in &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot; (1969), a comedy about sexual liberation. According to Tibbetts, this was the first film in which &quot;the saving leavening of humor was brought to bear upon the many painful dilemmas portrayed in her adult films.&quot; 

&quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot; became the signature film of Paul Mazursky and was a critical and commercial success. It was the sixth highest-grossing film of 1969. It grossed $50,000 in its first week, setting a house record. 

Wood did not capitalize on the success of &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot;. After becoming pregnant in 1970 with her first child, Natasha Gregson, she went into semi-retirement and would act in only four more theatrical films during the remainder of her life. She made a brief cameo appearance as herself in &quot;The Candidate&quot; (1972), working once more with Robert Redford.

===Semi-retirement and later career===

Wood reunited on the screen with Robert Wagner in the television film of the week &quot;The Affair&quot; (1973), and with Laurence Olivier and Wagner in an adaptation of &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1976) for the British series &quot;Laurence Olivier Presents&quot; broadcast as a special by NBC.

In between these she made &quot;Peeper&quot; (1975) with Michael Caine.

She made cameo appearances on Wagner&#x27;s prime-time detective series &quot;Switch&quot; in 1978 as Bubble Bath Girl, and his series &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; in 1979 as Movie Star.

After another lengthy break, she appeared in the ensemble disaster film &quot;Meteor&quot; (1979) with Sean Connery and the sex comedy &quot;The Last Married Couple in America&quot; (1980) with George Segal and Valerie Harper. Her performance in the latter was praised and considered reminiscent of her performance in &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot;. In &quot;Last Married Couple&quot;, Wood broke ground: although an actress with a clean, middle-class image, she used the word &quot;fuck&quot; in a frank marital discussion with her husband (Segal).

At the time of her death, Wood was filming the $15 million science fiction film &quot;Brainstorm&quot; (1983), co-starring Christopher Walken and directed by Douglas Trumbull. The ending of &quot;Brainstorm&quot; had to be re-written and Wood&#x27;s character written out of at least three scenes, while a stand-in and sound-alikes were used to replace Wood for some of her crucial shots. By this time, Wood had already completed all of her major scenes, and Trumbull proceeded to complete the film by rewriting the script and using Natalie Wood&#x27;s younger sister, Lana Wood, for Natalie Wood&#x27;s few remaining scenes. The film was released posthumously on September 30, 1983, and was dedicated to Wood in the closing credits.

===Television===
In this period, Wood had more success in television, receiving high ratings and critical acclaim in 1979 for &quot;The Cracker Factory&quot; and especially the miniseries remake of &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1979), with Kim Basinger and William Devane. Wood&#x27;s performance in the latter won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in 1980. She starred in &quot;The Memory of Eva Ryker&quot;, released in May 1980, which proved to be her last completed production.

She was scheduled to make her stage debut on February 12, 1982, in &quot;Anastasia&quot; at Ahmanson Theatre with Wendy Hiller. Wood had also purchased film rights to the Barbara Wersba book, &quot;Country of the Heart&quot;, and was planning to star with Timothy Hutton in the drama about the professional-romantic relationship between a tough-minded poet and her much younger student. (The material was eventually adapted into a 1990 television film starring Jane Seymour.) She expected to follow her performance as Anastasia on the stage with a starring stint in a film adaptation of the work. 

Wood appeared in 56 films for cinema and television. In one of her last interviews before her death, she was defined as &quot;our sexual conscience on the silver screen&quot;. Following her death, &quot;Time&quot; magazine noted that although critical praise for Wood had been sparse throughout her career, &quot;she always had work&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and relationships===

Wood&#x27;s two marriages to actor Robert Wagner were highly publicized. They first married on December 28, 1957, in Scottsdale, Arizona, when Wood was 19. At some point during the first half of 1961, according to several published accounts, she caught Wagner having an extramarital affair with another man. On June 20, 1961, the couple announced their separation in a joint press release and divorced ten months later on April 27, 1962.

Wood&#x27;s subsequent boyfriends included Warren Beatty, Michael Caine, and David Niven Jr. She also had a broken engagement in 1965 with Venezuelan shoe manufacturer Ladislav Blatnik.

On May 30, 1969, Wood married British producer Richard Gregson after dating for nearly three years. They had a daughter, Natasha (born September 29, 1970). Wood filed for divorce from Gregson on August 4, 1971, and it was finalized on April 12, 1972.

After a short-lived romance with future California governor Jerry Brown, Wood resumed her relationship with Wagner at the end of January 1972. They remarried on July 16 aboard the &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Rose&quot;, anchored off Paradise Cove in Malibu. Their daughter Courtney was born on March 9, 1974.

In 2015, after a third-party source had repeatedly published the claim, former FBI agent Donald G. Wilson openly stated that he and Wood had had a four-year affair, from 1973 to 1977, that began when she was pregnant with Courtney Wagner. In 2016, Wilson spoke on camera about his alleged affair with Wood in a documentary for the cable network Reelz.

===Rape allegation===
Suzanne Finstad&#x27;s 2001 biography of Wood alleges that she was raped by a powerful actor when she was 16, but in it, Finstad did not name the assailant. Through the recollection of Wood&#x27;s close friends, which included actors Scott Marlowe and Dennis Hopper, Finstad said:
During a 12-part podcast about Wood&#x27;s life in July 2018, Wood&#x27;s sister Lana stated that Wood was raped as a teenager, and she also stated that the attack had occurred inside the Chateau Marmont during an audition and it went on &quot;for hours&quot;. According to Professor Cynthia Lucia, who studied the claim, Wood&#x27;s rape was brutal and violent. In 2021, a year after the death of Kirk Douglas, Lana published the memoir &quot;Little Sister: My Investigation Into the Mysterious Death of Natalie Wood&quot; and identified Douglas as Wood&#x27;s alleged assailant.

== Death ==

On November 29, 1981, Wood died under mysterious circumstances at the age of 43 during the making of &quot;Brainstorm&quot;. She had been on a weekend boat trip to Santa Catalina Island on board her husband Robert Wagner&#x27;s motoryacht, &quot;Splendour&quot;. Many of the circumstances are unknown; for example, it has never been determined how she entered the water. Wood was with Wagner, her &quot;Brainstorm&quot; co-star Christopher Walken, and &quot;Splendour&quot;″s captain Dennis Davern on the evening of November 28. Authorities recovered her body at 8 a.m. on November 29, from the boat, with a small Valiant-brand inflatable dinghy beached nearby. Wagner said that she was not with him when he went to bed. The autopsy report revealed that she had bruises on her body and arms and an abrasion on her left cheek, but did not indicate how or when the injuries occurred.

Davern had previously stated that Wood and Wagner argued that evening, which Wagner denied at the time. In his memoir &quot;Pieces of My Heart&quot;, Wagner admitted that he had an argument with Wood before she disappeared. The autopsy found that Wood&#x27;s blood alcohol content was 0.14 and that there were traces of a motion-sickness pill and a painkiller in her bloodstream, both of which increase the effects of alcohol. The Los Angeles County coroner Thomas Noguchi ruled the cause of her death to be accidental drowning and hypothermia. According to Noguchi, Wood had been drinking and she may have slipped while trying to re-board the dinghy. Her sister Lana expressed doubts, alleging that Wood could not swim and had been &quot;terrified&quot; of water all her life, and that she would never have left the yacht on her own by dinghy. Two witnesses who were on a nearby boat stated that they had heard a woman scream for help during the night.
Wood was buried in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. Representatives of international media, photographers, and members of the public tried to attend her funeral, but all were required to remain outside the cemetery walls. Among the celebrities were Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor, Fred Astaire, Rock Hudson, David Niven, Gregory Peck, Gene Kelly, Elia Kazan, and Laurence Olivier. Olivier flew in from London in order to attend the service.

The case was reopened in November 2011 after Davern publicly stated that he had lied to police during the initial investigation and that Wood and Wagner had had an argument that evening. He alleged that Wood had been flirting with Walken, that Wagner was jealous and enraged, and that Wagner had prevented Davern from turning on the search lights and notifying authorities after Wood&#x27;s disappearance. Davern alleged that Wagner was responsible for her death. Wood&#x27;s sister, Lana Wood, spoke to CBS News, said that Davern called her over a decade after the incident to explain the events, though she did not know why, as he was &quot;not a close friend&quot;.

Wood claimed Davern told her, &quot;He said it appeared to him as though RJ [Wagner] shoved her away and she went overboard. Dennis panicked and RJ said, &#x27;Leave her there. Teach her a lesson.&#x27; Dennis said he was very panicky that he was sitting and RJ kept drinking and kept drinking. And he&#x27;d say, &#x27;Come on, let&#x27;s get her.&#x27; And he said RJ was in such a foul mood, at that point, that he then shut up and was waiting for when, when are they gonna go to her rescue, until all the sound stopped.&quot; Walken hired a lawyer, cooperated with the investigation, and was not considered a suspect by authorities.

In 2012, Los Angeles County Chief Coroner Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran amended Wood&#x27;s death certificate and changed the cause of death from accidental drowning to &quot;drowning and other undetermined factors&quot;. The amended document included a statement that it is &quot;not clearly established&quot; how Wood ended up in the water. Detectives instructed the coroner&#x27;s office not to discuss or comment on the case. On January 14, 2013, the Los Angeles County coroner&#x27;s office offered a 10-page addendum to Wood&#x27;s autopsy report. The addendum stated that Wood might have sustained some of the bruises on her body before she went into the water, but that this could not be definitively determined. Forensic pathologist Michael Hunter speculated that Wood was particularly susceptible to bruising because she had taken the drug Synthroid. In 2020, a medical doctor and former intern of Noguchi at the time of Wood&#x27;s death stated that the bruises were substantial and consistent with someone being thrown out of a boat. He claimed that he made those observations to Noguchi.

In February 2018, Wagner was named a person of interest by the police in the investigation. The police stated that they know that Wagner was the last person to be with Wood before she disappeared. In a 2018 report, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; cited the coroner&#x27;s report from 2013 by saying that Wood had unexplained fresh bruising on her right forearm, her left wrist, and her right knee, a scratch on her neck, and a superficial scrape on her forehead. Officials said that it is possible that she was assaulted before she drowned.

==Portrayals in film==
The 2004 TV film &quot;The Mystery of Natalie Wood&quot; chronicles Wood&#x27;s life and career. It was partly based on the biographies &quot;Natasha: the Biography of Natalie Wood&quot; by Suzanne Finstad and &quot;Natalie &amp; R.J.&quot; by Warren G. Harris. Justine Waddell portrays Wood.

==Legacy==
Wood was one of the few child actors who also achieved success as a movie star in adulthood. Wood&#x27;s career was also a bridge between Old Hollywood and New Hollywood. &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot; (1969), a successful film that Wood made after a period of professional and personal setbacks, cemented her place as an actress who was part of both worlds. Wood also achieved success in television, notably in the miniseries &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1979) for which she won a Golden Globe Award.

However, Wood&#x27;s professional legacy has, to a degree, been overshadowed by the enormous attention which has been given to her personal life. Her professional life has especially been overshadowed by the circumstances surrounding her death, as well as by her highly publicized marriage, her divorce and her remarriage to Robert Wagner, her relationships with several actors whom she dated in the 1960s, her mental health struggles, and her often troubled relationship with her mother. According to her daughter, Natasha Gregson Wagner, the focus on her death and the speculation about it &quot;overshadowed her life&#x27;s work and who she was as a person&quot;.

<text>The Abbey of the Paraclete () was a Benedictine monastery founded by Peter Abelard in Ferreux-Quincey, France, after he left the Abbey of St. Denis about 1121. &quot;Paraclete&quot; comes from the Greek word meaning &quot;one who consoles&quot; and is found in the Gospel of John (16:7) as a name for the Holy Spirit.

In 1125 Abelard was elected by the monks of the Abbey at Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys, near Vannes, Brittany, to be their abbot. He turned the Paraclete over to the recently displaced Héloïse, his wife, who had been in a nunnery in Argenteuil before its disbandment by Abbot Suger. The Paraclete was rededicated as a nunnery. Heloise became the Paraclete&#x27;s abbess and spent the rest of her life there.

She and Abelard were buried together there (Abelard , Heloise ) until 1792, when their remains were transferred to the church of Nogent-sur-Seine nearby. In 1817, their bodies were reportedly moved to a new tomb at Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, but whether they are both actually buried there remains a matter of dispute.

A large part of the abbey was demolished in the French Revolution. The remaining buildings are a barn and a dovecote from the early 17th century, and a conventual building from the 18th century. These are listed monuments, as well as the monument to Héloïse and Abélard. A chapel was built in the early 20th century.

<text>Leeds Castle is a castle in Kent, England, southeast of Maidstone. It is built on islands in a lake formed by the River Len to the east of the village of Leeds and is a historic Grade I listed estate.

A castle has existed on the site since 857. In the 13th century, it came into the hands of King Edward I, for whom it became a favourite residence; in the 16th century, Henry VIII used it as a dwelling for his first wife, Catherine of Aragon.

The present castle dates mostly from the early 19th century. Its last private owner, Olive, Lady Baillie, left the castle in trust to open it to the public. It has been open since 1976.

==History==

===Medieval and Tudor===

From 857, the site was owned by a Saxon chief called Led or Leed who built a wooden structure on two islands in the middle of the River Len. In 1119, Robert de Crevecoeur rebuilt it in stone as a Norman stronghold and Leeds Castle descended through the de Crevecoeur family until the 1260s. What form this Norman stronghold took is uncertain because it was rebuilt and transformed in the following centuries. Adrian Pettifer speculates that it may have been a motte and bailey.

In 1278, the castle was bought by King Edward I&#x27;s Queen, Eleanor of Castile, through the purchase of the debt bond from Jewish moneylenders forced to sell at a considerable discount as a result of Edward&#x27;s own excessive tax demands. As a favoured residence of Edward&#x27;s, it saw considerable investment. The king enhanced its defences, and it was probably Edward who created the lake that surrounds the castle. A barbican spanning three islands was also built and a gloriette with apartments for the king and queen was added. In the Late Middle Ages, the growth of the royal household meant fewer residences could accommodate the monarchy when they visited. As a result, expenditure on royal residences in south east England generally decreased except for the Tower of London and Windsor Castle. The activity at Leeds Castle during the reign of Edward I was a notable exception to this pattern.

The castle was captured on 31 October 1321 by the forces of Edward II from Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere, wife of the castle&#x27;s constable, Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere, who had left her in charge during his absence. The King had besieged Leeds after she had refused Edward&#x27;s consort Isabella of France admittance in her husband&#x27;s absence; when the latter sought to force an entry, Lady Badlesmere instructed her archers to shoot at Isabella and her party, six of whom were killed. Lady Badlesmere was kept prisoner in the Tower of London until November 1322. After Edward II died in 1327 his widow took over Leeds Castle as her primary residence.

Richard II&#x27;s first wife, Anne of Bohemia, spent the winter of 1381 at the castle on her way to be married to the king. In 1395, Richard received the French chronicler Jean Froissart there, as described in &quot;Froissart&#x27;s Chronicles&quot;.

Henry VIII transformed the castle in 1519 for his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. A painting commemorating his meeting with Francis I of France still hangs there. The glazier Galyon Hone reworked and restored the chapel windows in 1536. In 1544, Hone returned to repair windows in the lodgings and a banqueting house in the garden for a visit by Catherine Parr.

In 1552 Leeds Castle was granted to Sir Anthony St Leger (d.1559) of Ulcombe, Kent, whose grandfather Ralph I St Leger (d.1470), of Ulcombe, Sheriff of Kent in 1467/8, had been Constable of Leeds Castle.

===17th and 18th centuries===

The St Leger family continued to own the castle until Sir Warham St Leger sold it to Sir Richard Smythe in 1618. Smythe&#x27;s daughters sold the castle to Sir Thomas Colepeper of Hollingbourne. An early embroidered silk quilt from Bengal dating from the 1620s, held by the Colonial Williamsburg museum, has an ownership label of Catherine Colepeper, connecting it to Leeds Castle and the Smythe and Colepeper families. Richard Smythe&#x27;s brother Thomas Smythe was a founder and governor of the English East India Company.

The castle escaped destruction during the English Civil War because its owner, Sir Cheney Culpeper, sided with the Parliamentarians. The castle was used as both an arsenal and a prison during the war. Other members of the Culpeper family had sided with the Royalists, John Colepeper, 1st Baron Colepeper, having been granted more than of land in Virginia in reward for assisting the escape of the king&#x27;s son, Charles, the Prince of Wales. This legacy was to prove vital for the castle&#x27;s fortunes.

Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron was born at the castle in 1693 and settled in North America to oversee the Culpeper estates, cementing an ongoing connection between the castle and America. There is a commemorative sundial at the castle telling the time in Belvoir, Virginia and a corresponding sundial in America.
Fairfax was the great-grandson of Thomas Fairfax who led the parliamentarian attack at the nearby Battle of Maidstone in 1648 and whose doublet worn during the battle is on display.

===19th century===

Robert Fairfax owned the castle for 46 years until 1793 when it passed to the Wykeham Martins. Sale of the family estates in Virginia released a large sum of money that allowed extensive repair and the remodelling of the castle in a Tudor style, completed in 1823, that resulted in the appearance today.

===20th century===

The Wykeham Martins were forced to sell the castle and estate in 1924, in order to meet death duties. The last private owner was the Hon. Olive, Lady Baillie, daughter of Almeric Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough and his first wife, Pauline Payne Whitney, an American heiress. Lady Baillie bought the castle in 1926 for £180,000 (). She redecorated the interior, first working with the French architect and designer Armand-Albert Rateau, who oversaw exterior alterations and added interior features such as a 16th-century-style carved-oak staircase, then with the Paris decorator Stéphane Boudin. In total she spent $2 million on the project over the years.

During the early part of World War II the castle was used as a hospital where Lady Baillie and her daughters hosted burned Commonwealth airmen as part of their recovery. Survivors remembered the experience with fondness. Upon her death in 1974, Lady Baillie left the castle to the Leeds Castle Foundation, a private charitable trust whose aim is to preserve the castle and grounds for the benefit of the public.

An estimated £1.4 million (equivalent to £ million in ) was invested and a further £400,000 (£ million in ) was retrieved from the sale of the furniture to make improvements to the Castle and attract paying corporate conferences. However, it was quickly understood that it could not support the ongoing costs of running the Estate, so in 1975 the gardens were opened to the public, and the following year the Castle was also made available to visitors.

On 17 July 1978, the castle was the site of a meeting between Egyptian Foreign Minister Muhammad Ibrahim Kamel, Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and US Secretary of State Cyrus Vance in preparation for the Camp David Accords. The castle also hosted the Northern Ireland peace talks held in September 2004 led by Tony Blair.

In October 2021, Leeds Castle Foundation was one of 142 recipients across England to receive part of a £35 million grant from the government&#x27;s Culture Recovery Fund.

In 1952, the castle was named a Grade I listed building and recognised as an internationally important structure. The listing summary states: &quot;Castle. Early-to-mid C12, with C13, C14, C15 and C16 alterations. Partly rebuilt 1822&quot;. The research records at Historic England state that the castle was also &quot;extensively rebuilt in ... 1926&quot;.

==Tourism==
An aviary was added in 1980 and by 2011 contained over 100 species, but closed in 2012 to save its £200,000 a year running cost. The replacement Birds of Prey Centre, includes hawks on display and free-flying falconry displays.

The castle and its grounds are a major leisure destination with a golf course and what may be the world&#x27;s only museum of dog collars. There are two castle-themed children&#x27;s adventure play areas targeted at the under sevens and the under fourteens. A maze opened in 1988, constructed of 2,400 yew trees with the general appearance of a topiary castle. The centre is on a raised viewpoint, which also contains an exit through a shell grotto. The castle also offers accommodations for tourists including rental rooms and a campsite area with luxury tents called Knight&#x27;s Glamping.

In 1998, Leeds Castle was one of 57 heritage sites in England to receive more than 200,000 visitors. According to figures released by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, 539,971 people visited the castle in 2019. Due to travel and other restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of visitors in 2020 had declined to 389,363 in that year.

==Filming location==
The castle was a location for the Ealing Comedy film &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; (1949) as a stand-in for &#x27;Chalfont&#x27;, the ancestral home of the aristocratic d&#x27;Ascoyne family. It also appeared in the films &quot;The Moonraker&quot; (1958) and &quot;Waltz of the Toreadors&quot; (1962). It was used for filming of &quot;Purge of Kingdoms&quot; (2019) starring Armando Gutierrez and Angus Macfadyen.

On the small screen, the castle and grounds provided all the filming locations for a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial, &quot;The Androids of Tara&quot;, in 1978. Cliff Richard performed a live concert at the location (released on DVD), with Leeds Castle as a backdrop, titled &quot;Castles in the Air&quot;.

A more recent source states that the castle has been used for &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot; television series, for a Bollywood action movie called &quot;Rustom&quot; and for &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;, &quot;Casanova, Classic Mary Berry (BBC1), Who Do You Think You Are special with Danny Dyer, Antiques Roadtrip (BBC1), and What Would Your Kid Do? (ITV)&quot;.

<doc id="77393" wikidata="Q735795" url="?curid=77393" title="Roy Campanella">
<text>Roy Campanella (November 19, 1921 – June 26, 1993), nicknamed &quot;Campy&quot;, was an American professional baseball player, primarily as a catcher. The Philadelphia native played in the Negro leagues and Mexican League for nine years before entering the minor leagues in 1946. He made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut in 1948 for the Brooklyn Dodgers, for whom he played until 1957. His playing career ended when he was paralyzed in an automobile crash in January of 1958. He is considered one of the greatest catchers in the history of the game.

After he retired as a player as a result of the accident, Campanella held positions in scouting and community relations with the Dodgers. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969.

==Early life and education==
Roy Campanella was born in Philadelphia on November 19, 1921 to parents Ida, who was African American, and John Campanella, the son of Italian immigrants. Roy was the youngest of the four children born to the couple. They first lived in Germantown, and then moved to Nicetown in North Philadelphia, where the children attended integrated schools. 

He attended Gillespie Junior High School and Simon Gratz High School, although he left high school before graduating. Because of their mixed-race, Campanella and his siblings were sometimes taunted by other children in school who called them &quot;half-breed&quot;. Campanella had athletic gifts that he used to great effect; he was elected captain of every sports team he played on in high school, but baseball was his passion.

==Playing career==

===Negro leagues===
Of mixed race, Campanella was prohibited from MLB play as a result of the baseball color line. In 1937, at the age of 15, he began playing Negro league baseball for the Washington Elite Giants on weekends, subsequently dropping out of high school a few months later on his 16th birthday so he could play full time. The Elite Giants moved to Baltimore the following year, and Campanella became a star player with the team until 1945.

===Mexican and Venezuelan leagues===
During the 1942 season, Campanella left the Baltimore Elite Giants after a spat with owner Tom Wilson. He played the rest of the season and the following 1943 season in the Mexican League with the Monterrey Sultans. Lázaro Salazar, the team&#x27;s manager, told Campanella that one day he would play at the major league level. Campanella subsequently returned to the Elite Giants for the 1944–45 seasons.

In 1946, Campanella played in the newly formed Venezuelan Professional Baseball League on the Sabios de Vargas team, which he was co-coach and led to the league championship.

===Minor leagues===
Campanella moved into the Brooklyn Dodgers&#x27; minor league system in as the Dodger organization began preparations to break the MLB color barrier with Jackie Robinson. His easy-going personality and strong work ethic were credited with his being able to move successfully between the races. Although Branch Rickey considered hiring Campanella to break baseball&#x27;s color barrier, Rickey ultimately decided upon Robinson.

For the 1946 season, Robinson was assigned to the Montreal Royals, the Dodgers&#x27; affiliate in the Class AAA International League. On March 18, 1946, Campanella signed a contract to play for Danville Dodgers of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League. After the general manager of the Danville Dodgers reported that he did not feel the league was ready for racial integration, the organization sent Campanella and pitcher Don Newcombe to the Nashua Dodgers of the Class B New England League, where the Dodgers felt the climate would be more tolerant. The Nashua team thus became the first professional baseball team of the 20th century to field a racially integrated lineup in the United States.

Campanella&#x27;s 1946 season proceeded largely without racist incidents, and in one game Campanella assumed the managerial duties after manager Walter Alston was ejected. Campanella was the first African American to manage White players of an organized professional baseball team. Nashua was three runs down at the time Campanella took over. They came back to win, in part due to Campanella&#x27;s decision to use Newcombe as a pinch hitter during the seventh inning; Newcombe hit a game-tying two-run home run.

===Major League Baseball===

Jackie Robinson&#x27;s first season in the major leagues came in 1947, and Campanella began his MLB career with the Brooklyn Dodgers the following season, playing his first game on April 20, 1948. In later years, Robinson and his wife sometimes stayed with the Campanella family during some ballgames because adequate hotels for blacks could not be found in the city.

After spending most of the beginning of the 1948 season on the bench, Campanella was assigned to the Saint Paul Saints, the Dodgers&#x27; affiliate in the Class AAA American Association, where he resided in the Rondo neighborhood. On May 18, Campanella become the first person to break the color barrier in the American Association when he entered a game. By early July, after having success against the league&#x27;s pitching, he returned to the Dodgers.

Campanella stayed at the Major League level and played for the Dodgers from July through as their regular catcher. In 1948, he had three different uniform numbers (33, 39, and 56) before settling on 39 for the rest of his career.

Campanella was selected to the All-Star Game every year from through . With his 1949 All-Star selection, he was one of the first four African Americans so honored. (Jackie Robinson, Don Newcombe and Larry Doby were also All-Stars that year.) In 1950 Campanella hit home runs in five straight games; the only other Dodgers to homer in five consecutive games are Shawn Green (2001), Matt Kemp (2010), Adrián González (2014–15), and Joc Pederson (2015).

Campanella received the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in the National League three times: in , , and . In each of his MVP seasons, he batted over .300, hit more than 30 home runs, and had more than 100 runs batted in (RBI). His 142 RBI during 1953 exceeded the franchise record of 130, which had been held by Jack Fournier () and Babe Herman (). Today it is the second most in franchise history, Tommy Davis breaking it with 153 RBI in . That same year, Campanella hit 40 home runs in games in which he appeared as a catcher, a record that lasted until , when it was exceeded by Todd Hundley. In his career, he threw out 57% of the base runners who tried to steal a base on him, the highest percentage of any catcher in Major League history. Campanella had five of the seven top caught stealing percentages for a single season in Major League history.

In 1955, Campanella&#x27;s final MVP season, he helped Brooklyn win its first World Series championship. After the Dodgers lost the first two games of the series to the Yankees, Campanella began Brooklyn&#x27;s comeback by hitting a two-out, two-run home run in the first inning of Game 3. The Dodgers won that game, got another home run from Campanella in a Game 4 victory that tied the series, and then went on to claim the series in seven games when Johnny Podres shut out the Yankees 2–0 in Game 7.

Campanella caught three no-hitters during his career: Carl Erskine&#x27;s two, on June 19, and May 12, and Sal Maglie&#x27;s on September 25, 1956. &quot;In my no-hitter...I only shook Campy off once,&quot; Maglie recalled. &quot;He was doing the thinking, calling the pitches just right for every batter in every situation, and all I had to do was check the sign to see if I agreed and then throw.&quot;

After the 1957 season, the Brooklyn Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles and became the Los Angeles Dodgers, but Campanella&#x27;s playing career came to an end as a result of an automobile accident. He never played a game for Los Angeles.

==Automobile crash==
Campanella lived in Glen Cove, New York, on the North Shore of Long Island; he operated a liquor store in Harlem between regular-season games and during the off-season. After closing the store for the night on January 28, 1958, he began his drive home to Glen Cove. While he was traveling at about , his rented 1957 Chevrolet sedan hit a patch of ice at an S-curve on Dosoris Lane near Apple Tree Lane in Glen Cove, skidded into a telephone pole, and overturned, breaking Campanella&#x27;s neck. He fractured the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae and compressed the spinal cord. The crash left Campanella paralyzed from the shoulders down. With physical therapy, he was eventually able to regain substantial use of his arms and hands. He was able to feed himself, shake hands, and gesture while speaking, but he required a wheelchair for mobility for the remainder of his life.

Campanella wrote his autobiography, &quot;It&#x27;s Good to Be Alive&quot;, which was published in 1959; in it, he discussed his convalescence and partial recovery after the crash. Michael Landon directed a TV-movie based on the book, &quot;It&#x27;s Good to Be Alive&quot; (1974), which was considerably fictionalized. Campanella was portrayed by Paul Winfield.

==Post-playing career==
After his playing career and rehabilitation, Campanella remained involved with the Dodgers. In January 1959, the Dodgers named him assistant supervisor of scouting for the eastern United States and special coach at the team&#x27;s annual spring training camp in Vero Beach, Florida, serving each year as a mentor and coach to young catchers in the Dodger organization.

On September 27, 1959, Campanella appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;Lassie&quot; called &quot;The Mascot&quot; in which he coached the Calverton boys&#x27; baseball team and advised Timmy about a matter of cheating. 

On May 7, 1959, the Dodgers, then playing their second season in Los Angeles, honored him with &quot;Roy Campanella Night&quot; at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The New York Yankees agreed to make a special visit to Los Angeles (between road series in Kansas City and Chicago) to play an exhibition game against the Dodgers for the occasion.

The Yankees won the Thursday night game 6–2, with an attendance of 93,103, setting a record at that time for the largest crowd to attend a Major League Baseball game. The proceeds from the game went to defray Campanella&#x27;s medical bills.

On March 28, 1970, Campanella was named manager of the West team in the East-West Major League Baseball Classic, a charity exhibition All-Star game held in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. It was the first time he wore his Dodgers uniform since his career-ending accident.

In 1978, Campanella moved to California and accepted a job with the Dodgers as assistant to the director of community relations, Don Newcombe, his former teammate and longtime friend.

A historic marker was installed in Nashua, New Hampshire by the Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire to celebrate the achievements of Campanella and Newcombe in 2023.

==Personal life==
Campanella was married three times. His first marriage, to Bernice Ray on January 3, 1939, ended in divorce. They had two daughters together.

On April 30, 1945, he married Ruthe Willis, who brought her son David to the marriage. They had three children together (including a son, Roy Campanella II, who became a television director). Their marriage deteriorated after Campanella&#x27;s accident; they separated in 1960. Ruthe died of a heart attack at age 40 in January 1963.

On May 5, 1964, Campanella married Roxie Doles, who survived him.

===Death===
Campanella died of heart failure at age 71 on June 26, 1993, at his home in Woodland Hills, California. His body was cremated at the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Legacy==

In July 1969, Campanella was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, the second player of black heritage (actually bi-racial) so honored, after Jackie Robinson. The same year, he received the Bronze Medallion from the City of New York.

Campanella was elected to the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall Of Fame in 1971. On June 4, 1972, the Dodgers retired Campanella&#x27;s uniform number 39 alongside Jackie Robinson&#x27;s number 42 and Sandy Koufax&#x27;s number 32.

In 1999, Campanella ranked number 50 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Campanella at number 94 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

Campanella was featured on a United States postage stamp in 2006.The stamp is one of a block of four honoring baseball sluggers, the others being Mickey Mantle, Hank Greenberg, and Mel Ott. 

In September 2006, the Los Angeles Dodgers announced the creation of the Roy Campanella Award. The club&#x27;s players and coaches vote on it annually, and is given to the Dodger who best exemplifies &quot;Campy&#x27;s&quot; spirit and leadership. Shortstop Rafael Furcal was named the inaugural winner of the award.

Campanella is mentioned in the lyrics of multiple songs, including &quot;Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit that Ball?&quot;, written and recorded by Buddy Johnson in 1949 (and covered by Count Basie and his Orchestra that same year), &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot; by Billy Joel, and in the refrain of &quot;Talkin&#x27; Baseball&quot; by Terry Cashman.

Roy Campanella Park, a recreation center operated by the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation in unincorporated West Rancho Dominguez, California, is named after him.

<text>Admiralty law or maritime law is a body of law that governs nautical issues and private maritime disputes. Admiralty law consists of both domestic law on maritime activities, and private international law governing the relationships between private parties operating or using ocean-going ships. While each legal jurisdiction usually has its own legislation governing maritime matters, the international nature of the topic and the need for uniformity has, since 1900, led to considerable international maritime law developments, including numerous multilateral treaties.

Admiralty law, which mainly governs the relations of private parties, is distinguished from the law of the sea, a body of public international law regulating maritime relationships between nations, such as navigational rights, mineral rights, and jurisdiction over coastal waters. While admiralty law is adjudicated in national courts, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has been adopted by 167 countries and the European Union, and disputes are resolved at the ITLOS tribunal in Hamburg.

==History==
Shipping was one of the earliest channels of commerce, and rules for resolving maritime trade disputes were developed early. An ancient example was the Rhodian law (), of which no extensive written specimen has survived, but which is alluded to in other legal texts (Roman and Byzantine legal codes), and later the customs of the Consulate of the Sea and the Hanseatic League. In southern Italy the (1063) at Trani and the Amalfian Laws were in effect from an early date.

Bracton notes that admiralty law was also used as an alternative to the common law in Norman England, which previously required voluntary submission to it by entering a plea seeking judgment from the court.

A leading sponsor of admiralty law in Europe was the French Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. Eleanor had learned about admiralty law while on the Second Crusade in the eastern Mediterranean with her first husband, King Louis VII of France. Eleanor then established admiralty law on the island of Oléron, where it was published as the Rolls of Oléron. Some time later, while she was in London as regent for her son, King Richard I of England, Eleanor instituted admiralty law in England as well.

In England and Wales, a special Admiralty Court handles all admiralty cases. Despite early reliance upon civil law concepts derived from the of Justinian, the English Admiralty Court is a common law court, albeit &quot;sui generis,&quot; that was initially somewhat distinct from other English courts. After around 1750, as the Industrial Revolution took hold and English maritime commerce burgeoned, the Admiralty Court became a fertile source of legal innovation to meet the new situations of the modern economy. The Judicature Acts of 1873–1875 abolished the Admiralty Court as such, and it became conflated in the new Probate, Divorce and Admiralty division of the High Court. However, when the PDA was abolished and replaced by a new Family Division, admiralty jurisdiction passed to a so-called Admiralty Court which was effectively the King&#x27;s Bench sitting to hear nautical cases. The Senior Courts Act 1981 then clarified the admiralty jurisdiction of the Queen&#x27;s Bench, so England and Wales once again has a distinct Admiralty Court (albeit no longer based in the Royal Courts of Justice, but in the Rolls Building).

English Admiralty courts were prominent in the disputes leading to the American Revolution. For example, the phrase in the Declaration of Independence &quot;For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury&quot; refers to the practice of the UK Parliament giving the Admiralty Courts jurisdiction to enforce the Stamp Act 1765 in the American colonies. The Stamp Act was unpopular in America, so a colonial jury would be unlikely to convict a colonist of its violation. The Admiralty Court, which has never allowed trial by jury, was thus empowered to enforce the statute more effectively.

Admiralty law gradually became part of United States law through admiralty cases arising after the adoption of the U.S. Constitution in 1789. Many American lawyers prominent in the American Revolution were admiralty and maritime lawyers, including Alexander Hamilton in New York and John Adams in Massachusetts.

In 1787, Thomas Jefferson wrote to James Madison proposing that the U.S. Constitution, then under consideration by the States, be amended to include &quot;trial by jury in all matters of fact triable by the laws of the land and not by the laws of Nations&quot;. The result was the United States Bill of Rights. Alexander Hamilton and John Adams were both admiralty lawyers and Adams represented John Hancock in an admiralty case in colonial Boston involving seizure of one of Hancock&#x27;s ships for violations of customs regulations. In the more modern era, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes was an admiralty lawyer before ascending to the bench.

==Features==
Matters dealt by admiralty law include marine commerce, marine navigation, salvage, maritime pollution, seafarers&#x27; rights, and the carriage by sea of both passengers and goods. Admiralty law also covers land-based commercial activities that are maritime in character, such as marine insurance. Some lawyers prefer to reserve the term &quot;admiralty law&quot; for &quot;wet law&quot; (e.g. salvage, collisions, ship arrest, towage, liens and limitation), and use &quot;maritime law&quot; only for &quot;dry law&quot; (e.g. carriage of goods and people, marine insurance, and the Maritime Labour Convention).

===Maintenance and cure===
The doctrine of maintenance and cure is rooted in Article VI of the Rolls of Oléron promulgated in about 1160 A.D. The obligation to &quot;cure&quot; requires a shipowner to provide medical care free of charge to a seaman injured in the service of the ship, until the seaman has reached &quot;maximum medical cure&quot;. The concept of &quot;maximum medical cure&quot; is more extensive than the concept &quot;maximum medical improvement&quot;. The obligation to &quot;cure&quot; a seaman includes the obligation to provide him with medications and medical devices which improve his ability to function, even if they do not &quot;improve&quot; his actual condition. They may include long-term treatments that permit him to continue to function well. Common examples include prostheses, wheelchairs, and pain medications.

The obligation of &quot;maintenance&quot; requires the shipowner to provide a seaman with his basic living expenses while he is convalescing. Once a seaman is able to work, he is expected to maintain himself. Consequently, a seaman can lose his right to maintenance, while the obligation to provide cure is ongoing.

A seaman who is required to sue a shipowner to recover maintenance and cure may also recover his attorneys fees. &quot;Vaughan v. Atkinson&quot;, 369 U.S. 527 (1962). If a shipowner&#x27;s breach of the obligation to provide maintenance and cure is willful and wanton, the shipowner may be subject to punitive damages. See &quot;Atlantic Sounding Co. v. Townsend&quot;, 557 U.S. 404 (2009) (J. Thomas).

===Personal injuries to passengers===

Shipowners owe a duty of reasonable care to passengers. Consequently, passengers who are injured aboard ships may bring suit as if they had been injured ashore through the negligence of a third party. The passenger bears the burden of proving that the shipowner was negligent. While personal injury cases must generally be pursued within three years, suits against cruise lines may need to be brought within one year because of limitations contained in the passenger ticket. Notice requirements in the ticket may require a formal notice to be brought within six months of the injury. Most U.S. cruise line passenger tickets also have provisions requiring that suit to be brought in either Miami or Seattle.

In England, the 1954 case of &quot;Adler v Dickson (The Himalaya)&quot; [1954] allowed a shipping line to escape liability when a bosun&#x27;s negligence resulted in a passenger being injured. Since then, the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 has made it unlawful to exclude liability for death or personal injury caused by one&#x27;s negligence. (Since then, however, the so-called &quot;Himalaya clause&quot; has become a useful way for a contractor to pass on the protection of a limitation clause to his employees, agents and third-party contractors.)

===Maritime liens and mortgages===
Banks which loan money to purchase ships, vendors who supply ships with necessaries like fuel and stores, seamen who are due wages, and many others have a lien against the ship to guarantee payment. To enforce the lien, the ship must be arrested or seized. In the United States, an action to enforce a lien against a U.S. ship must be brought in federal court and cannot be done in state court, except for under the reverse Erie Doctrine whereby state courts can apply federal law.

===Salvage and treasure salvage===
When property is lost at sea and rescued by another, the rescuer (salvor) is entitled to claim a salvage award on the salvaged property. This applies only to the saving of property: there is no &quot;life salvage&quot;, as all mariners have a duty to save the lives of others in peril without expectation of reward.

There are two types of salvage: contract salvage and pure salvage (merit salvage). In contract salvage, the owner of the property and the salvor enter into a salvage contract prior to salvage operations, for an agreed payment. The most common form is a &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Open Form Salvage Contract&quot;.

In pure salvage, there is no contract between the owner of the goods and the salvor, and the relationship is imputed by law. The salvor must bring his claim for salvage in court, which awards salvage based upon the merit of the service and the value of the salvaged property.

Pure salvage claims are divided into &quot;high-order&quot; and &quot;low-order&quot; salvage. In high-order salvage, the salvor and his crew risk of injury and damage to equipment during salvage operations: for example boarding a sinking ship in heavy weather, boarding a ship on fire, raising a ship which has already sunk, or towing a ship away from the surf near shore. In low-order salvage, the salvor takes little or no personal risk, for example towing a vessel in calm seas, supplying fuel, or pulling a vessel off a sand bar. High-order salvage earns a substantially greater salvage award.

In both high-order and low-order salvage, the amount of the salvage award is based first upon the value of the property saved. If nothing is saved, or if additional damage is done, there will be no award. The other factors to be considered are the skills of the salvor, the peril to which the salvaged property was exposed, the value of the property which was risked in effecting the salvage, the amount of time and money expended, etc.

A pure or merit salvage award will seldom exceed 50 percent of the value of the property saved. The exception s in the case of treasure salvage. Because sunken treasure has generally been lost for hundreds of years, while the original owner (or insurer, if the vessel was insured) continues to have an interest in it, the salvor or finder will generally get the majority of the value of the property. While sunken ships from the Spanish Main (such as &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot; in the Florida Keys) are the most famous type of treasure salvage, other types – including German submarines from World War II which can hold valuable historical artifacts, American Civil War ships (the USS &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; in the St. Johns River, and the CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; in Chesapeake Bay), and sunken merchant ships (the SS &quot;Central America&quot; off Cape Hatteras) – have all been the subject of treasure salvage awards. Due to refinements in side-scanning sonars, many more ships are now being located and treasure salvage is less risky, although it is still highly speculative and expensive.

===Allision===

In maritime law, it is occasionally desirable to distinguish between the situation of a vessel striking a moving object and that of it striking a stationary object. The word &quot;&quot; is then used to mean the striking of a stationary object, while &quot;collision&quot; is used to mean the striking of a moving object. Thus, when two vessels run against each other, courts typically use the term &quot;collision&quot; whereas when one vessel runs against a stationary object, they typically use the term &quot;allision&quot;. The fixed object could be a bridge or dock.

While there is no great difference between the two terms and often they are even used interchangeably, determining the difference helps clarify the circumstances of emergencies and adapt accordingly.

==International conventions==
Before the mid-1970s, most international conventions concerning maritime trade and commerce originated in a private organization of maritime lawyers known as the Comité Maritime International (International Maritime Committee or CMI). Founded in 1897, the CMI drafted numerous international conventions, including the Hague Rules (International Convention on Bills of Lading), the Visby Amendments (amending the Hague Rules), the Salvage Convention, and many others. While the CMI continues to function in an advisory capacity, many of its functions have been taken over by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). In 1948 an international conference in Geneva adopted a convention formally establishing IMO (the original name was the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization, or IMCO, but the name was changed in 1982 to IMO with UN Convention on the Law of the Sea). The IMO Convention entered into force in 1958 and the new Organization met for the first time the following year (https://www.imo.org/en/About/HistoryOfIMO/Pages/Default.aspx). The IMO has prepared numerous international conventions concerning maritime safety, including the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), the Standards for Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping (STCW), the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (Collision Regulations or COLREGS), Maritime Pollution Regulations (MARPOL), International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR Convention) and others. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) defined a treaty regarding protection of the marine environment and various maritime boundaries. Restrictions on international fishing such as International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling also form part of the body of conventions in international waters. Other commercial conventions include the &quot;International Convention relating to the Limitation of the Liability of Owners of Sea-Going Ships&quot;, Brussels, 10 October 1957. and International Convention for Safe Containers.

Once adopted, most international conventions are enforced by the individual signatory nations, either through their Port State Control, or through their national courts. Cases within the ambit of the European Union&#x27;s EMSA may be heard by the CJEU in Luxembourg. By contrast, disputes involving the Law of the Sea may be resolved at ITLOS in Hamburg, provided that the parties are signatories to UNCLOS.

==Piracy==

Throughout history, piracy has been defined as &quot;hostis humani generis&quot;, or the enemy of all mankind. While the flag state normally has jurisdiction over a ship on the high seas, there is universal jurisdiction in the case of piracy, which means that any nation may pursue pirates on the high seas, including pursuing them into a country&#x27;s territorial waters. Most nations have signed onto the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which dictates the legal requirements for pursuing pirates.

Merchant vessels transiting areas of increased pirate activity (i.e. the Gulf of Aden, Somali Basin, Southern Red Sea and Bab-el-Mandeb straits) are advised to implement self-protective measures, in accordance with most recent best management practices agreed upon by the members of the merchant industry and endorsed by the NATO Shipping Centre, and the Maritime Security Centre Horn-of-Africa (MSCHOA).

==Individual countries==
===Great Britain and certain Commonwealth countries===
The common law of England and Wales, of Northern Ireland law, and of US law, contrast to the continental law (civil law) that prevails in Scottish law and in continental Europe, which trace back to Roman law. Although the English Admiralty court was a development of continental civil law, the Admiralty Court of England and Wales was a common law court, albeit somewhat distanced from the mainstream King&#x27;s Bench.

Most of the common law countries (including Pakistan, Singapore, India, and many other Commonwealth of Nations countries) follow English statute and case law. India still follows many Victorian-era British statutes such as the Admiralty Court Act 1861 [24 Vict c 10]. While Pakistan now has its own statute, the Admiralty Jurisdiction of High Courts Ordinance, 1980 (Ordinance XLII of 1980), it also follows English case law. One reason for this is that the 1980 Ordinance is partly modelled on old English admiralty law, namely the Administration of Justice Act 1956. The current statute dealing with the Admiralty jurisdiction of the England and Wales High Court is the Senior Courts Act 1981, ss. 20–24, 37. The provisions in those sections are, in turn, based on the International Arrest Convention 1952. Other countries which do not follow the English statute and case laws, such as Panama, also have established well-known maritime courts which decide international cases on a regular basis.

Admiralty courts assume jurisdiction by virtue of the presence of the vessel in its territorial jurisdiction irrespective of whether the vessel is national or not and whether registered or not, and wherever the residence or domicile or their owners may be. A vessel is usually arrested by the court to retain jurisdiction. State-owned vessels are usually immune from arrest.

===Canada===
Canadian jurisdiction in the area of navigation and shipping is vested in the Parliament of Canada by virtue of s. 91(10) of the Constitution Act, 1867.

Canada has adopted an expansive definition of its maritime law, which goes beyond traditional admiralty law. The original English admiralty jurisdiction was called &quot;wet&quot;, as it concerned itself with things done at sea, including collisions, salvage and the work of mariners, and contracts and torts performed at sea. Canadian law has added &quot;dry&quot; jurisdiction to this field, which includes such matters as:

* stevedoring,
* marine insurance,
* warehousing and security services,
* contracts of agency, and
* contracts of carriage.

This list is not exhaustive of the subject matter.

Canadian jurisdiction was originally consolidated in 1891, with subsequent expansions in 1934 following the passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931, and in 1971 with the extension to &quot;dry&quot; matters.

Recent jurisprudence at the Supreme Court of Canada has tended to expand the maritime law power, thus overriding prior provincial laws based on the provinces&#x27; power over property and civil rights.

===United States===
====Jurisdiction====
Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution grants original jurisdiction to U.S. federal courts over admiralty and maritime matters; however, that jurisdiction is not exclusive, and most maritime cases can be heard in either state or federal courts under the &quot;saving to suitors&quot; clause.

There are five types of cases which can only be brought in federal court:

* limitation of shipowner&#x27;s liability,
* vessel arrests &quot;in rem&quot;,
* property arrests &quot;quasi in rem&quot;,
* salvage cases, and
* petitory and possession actions.

The common element of those cases are that they require the court to exercise jurisdiction over maritime property. For example, in a petitory and possession action, a vessel whose title is in dispute, usually between co-owners, will be put in the possession of the court until the title dispute can be resolved. In a limitation action, the shipowner will post a bond reflecting the value of the vessel and her pending freight. A sixth category, that of prize, relating to claims over vessels captured during wartime, has been rendered obsolete due to changes in the laws and practices of warfare.

Aside from those five types of cases, all other maritime cases, such as claims for personal injuries, cargo damage, collisions, maritime products liability, and recreational boating accidents may be brought in either federal or state court.

From a tactical standpoint it is important to consider that in federal courts in the United States, there is generally no right to trial by jury in admiralty cases, although the 1920 Jones Act grants a jury trial to seamen suing their employers.

Maritime law is governed by a uniform three-year statute of limitations for personal injury and wrongful death cases. Cargo cases must be brought within two years (extended from the one-year allowance under the Hague-Visby Rules), pursuant to the adoption of the Rotterdam Rules. Most major cruise ship passenger tickets have a one-year statute of limitations.

====Applicable law====
A state court hearing an admiralty or maritime case is required to apply the admiralty and maritime law, even if it conflicts with the law of the state, under a doctrine known as the &quot;reverse-&quot;Erie&quot; doctrine&quot;. While the &quot;&quot;Erie&quot; doctrine&quot; requires that federal courts hearing state actions must apply substantive state law, the &quot;reverse-&quot;Erie&quot; doctrine&quot; requires state courts hearing admiralty cases to apply substantive federal admiralty law. However, state courts are allowed to apply state procedural law. This change can be significant.

====Features of U.S. admiralty law====

=====Cargo claims=====

Claims for damage to cargo shipped in international commerce are governed by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), which is the U.S. enactment of the Hague Rules. One of its key features is that a shipowner is liable for cargo damaged from &quot;hook to hook&quot;, meaning from loading to discharge, unless it is exonerated under one of 17 exceptions to liability, such as an &quot;act of God&quot;, the inherent nature of the goods, errors in navigation, and management of the ship. The basis of liability for the shipowner is a bailment and if the carrier is to be liable as a common carrier, it must be established that the goods were placed in the carrier&#x27;s possession and control for immediate carriage.

=====Personal injuries to seamen=====

Seamen injured aboard ship have three possible sources of compensation: the principle of maintenance and cure, the doctrine of unseaworthiness, and the Jones Act. The principle of maintenance and cure requires a shipowner to both pay for an injured seaman&#x27;s medical treatment until maximum medical recovery (MMR) is obtained and provide basic living expenses until completion of the voyage, even if the seaman is no longer aboard ship.

===Pakistan===
Admiralty law in Pakistan is also classified as shipping law. The Pakistan Merchant Shipping Ordinance 2001 has replaced the Merchant Shipping Act 1923. This replacement was done in 2001 to handle the constantly upgrading modern shipping industry. The purpose of the Pakistan Merchant Shipping Ordinance 2001 is to provide a strategy and rules under which the government authorities will function in dealing with stuff related to the shipping industry. This law also handles duties internationally required under the ILO (International Labour Organization) conventions as Pakistan is an active member of the ILO.

==Conspiracy theory==

A pseudolegal conspiracy theory of American origin, notably present among the anti-government sovereign citizen and freeman on the land movements, asserts that at some point maritime law, which they consider to be the law of international commerce, substituted for the original, legitimate &quot;common law&quot; system as part of a broader conspiracy which secretly replaced governments with corporations. The judiciary hence became admiralty courts with no actual jurisdiction over people. Sovereign citizens notably claim that the presence of gold fringes on the American flags displayed in courtrooms is evidence of maritime law being in effect.

One variation of this theory is based on a misinterpretation of the English Cestui Que Vie Act 1666 which stated that a person missing at sea shall be assumed to be dead after seven years; conspiracy theorists claim that the government uses this Act to secretly enslave people, by assuming any person to be legally dead from the age of seven and thereafter considering their person and/or property as its possessions.

The origin of the maritime law conspiracy theory is unknown, though it may stem from a misunderstanding of some nautical-sounding words in common usage in the English-language judiciary such as &quot;ownership&quot;, &quot;citizenship&quot;, &quot;dock&quot; or &quot;birth (berth) certificate&quot;. This theory is entirely devoid of merit: when invoked by litigants, it has been consistently dismissed as frivolous.

<doc id="77403" wikidata="Q2778950" url="?curid=77403" title="Deerhurst">
<text>Deerhurst is a village and civil parish in Gloucestershire, England, about southwest of Tewkesbury. The village is on the east bank of the River Severn. The parish includes the village of Apperley and the hamlet of Deerhurst Walton. The 2011 Census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 906, the majority of whom live in Apperley.

The place-name is derived from Old English and means &quot;deer-wood&quot;. It was spelt &quot;Deorhyrst&quot; in AD 804, &quot;Dorhirst&quot; in about 1050 and &quot;Derherste&quot; in the Domesday Book in 1086.

==Geography==
The parish has an area of about , bounded by the Severn to the west, the A38 road to the east and Coombe Hill Canal to the south.

The parish is low-lying and much of it is repeatedly flooded. After serious flooding in 1947 several cottages were abandoned and demolished. Deerhurst was inundated again by the floods of 2007.

==Priory and parish church==

By AD 804 there was a Benedictine monastery at Deerhurst, which also held the manor. In about 1060 King Edward the Confessor divided the manor. He granted the monastery, with one hide of land, to the Abbey of St Denis in France, making it an alien priory. But the larger part of the land, assessed at five hides, he granted to Westminster Abbey.

Deerhurst Priory ceased to be an alien house in 1443 and the Crown granted it to Tewkesbury Abbey in 1467. Both the abbey and the priory were dissolved in 1540.

The priory church of St Mary, built in the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries AD, survives as Deerhurst&#x27;s Church of England parish church. It has been described as &quot;an Anglo-Saxon monument of the first order&quot; and is a Grade I listed building.
Part of another building of the priory survives in Priory Farmhouse, which adjoins the church. In its cellar is an 11th- or 12th-century column, but most of the core of the building seems to be 14th-century and later. After the dissolution in 1540 the building was converted into a farmhouse. It is a Grade I listed building.

==Odda&#x27;s Chapel and Abbot&#x27;s Court==
Odda of Deerhurst founded Odda&#x27;s Chapel in 1056 as a chantry for his brother Ælfric, who had died in 1053. Chantries were abolished in the 16th century and the chapel ceased to be used for worship.

Early in the 17th century a timber-framed house, Abbot&#x27;s Court, was built next to it as the manor house for the Westminster Abbey&#x27;s estate. The former chapel was converted into the service wing of the house. The chapel is a Grade I listed building.

==Deerhurst Manor==
After dissolving the priory in 1540, the Crown leased its manor to a George Throckmorton. It remained with his heirs until 1604, when a Thomas Throckmorton sold it to Thomas Cassey of Wightfield Manor near Apperley.

In 1615 the Cassey sold the manor to Thomas Coventry, who in 1628 was created Baron Coventry. In 1697 the 5th Baron Coventry was created Earl of Coventry and at the subsidiary title &quot;Viscount Deerhurst&quot; was created for his heir apparent.

In 1964 trustees for the 11th Earl of Coventry still held an estate of at Deerhurst. The Coventry family has never lived at Deerhurst: its seat is at Croome Court in Worcestershire.

==School==

A National School was built in Deerhurst in 1856. Apperley had its own school until 1923, when it was closed and its pupils were transferred to Deerhurst. By 1964 it was a primary school, and children over the age of 11 attended secondary schools in Tewkesbury. The school has since moved to Apperley, and the building in Deerhurst has been converted into two private houses.

==Legend==
There is a local legend that a dragon once ravaged the area, until a man called John Smith killed it with an axe.

<text>The Canadian province of New Brunswick was a British crown colony before it joined Canada in 1867. It had a system of responsible government beginning in 1854, and has kept its own legislature to deal with provincial matters. New Brunswick has a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the premier is the leader of the party that has the confidence of the Legislative Assembly to form a government. The premier is New Brunswick&#x27;s head of government, and the king of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the lieutenant governor of New Brunswick. The premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of New Brunswick, and presides over that body.

Members are first elected to the legislature during general elections. General elections must be conducted every five years from the date of the last election, but the premier may ask for early dissolution of the Legislative Assembly. An election may also take place if the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.

New Brunswick has had 37 individuals serve as first minister. The province had five individuals as leaders while a colony, and 32 individuals after Canadian Confederation, of which two were from the Confederation Party, 11 from the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick, 16 from the New Brunswick Liberal Association, one from the Anti-Confederation Party, and seven with unofficial party affiliations.

<doc id="77412" wikidata="Q368853" url="?curid=77412" title="Aëdon">
<text>Aëdon () was in Greek mythology, the daughter of Pandareus of Ephesus. According to Homer, she was the wife of Zethus, and the mother of Itylus. Aëdon features in two different stories, one set in Thebes and one set in Western Asia Minor, both of which contain filicide and explain the origin of the nightingale, a bird in constant mourning.

== Etymology ==
The feminine noun translates to &#x27;nightingale&#x27;, and has a secondary meaning of &#x27;singer&#x27;. It shares the same root with the verb meaning &#x27;to sing, to chant, to praise&#x27;. This verb in turn derives from Proto-Hellenic &quot;&quot;, which might be from a Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*h₂weyd-&quot;.

== Family ==
Aëdon was the daughter of Pandareus and his wife Harmothoë, and thus sister to Chelidon, Cleothera, Merope and an unnamed brother. According to the geographer Pausanias, Polygnotus supplanted the names of the last two with Cameiro and Clytie instead.

Aëdon either married Zethus, king of Thebes, and bore him an only son named Itylus, or Polytechnus, a carpenter of Colophon in Lydia, and bore him an only son named Itys. In some authors she also has a daughter named Neis.

== Mythology ==
=== Thebes ===
Aëdon was the wife of Zethus, king of Thebes, and accidentally she ended up killing her own son Itylus, when &#x27;madness was upon her&#x27;. Her story is evidently a very old one, as it was referenced as early as Homer in his &quot;Odyssey&quot;, when Penelope speaks to her husband Odysseus in the lines:

Eustathius of Thessalonica and other scholiasts explain that Aëdon was envious of her sister-in-law, Amphion&#x27;s wife Niobe, who had fourteen children (seven sons and seven daughters) opposed to her single one (or two, as some authors also mention a daughter named Neis). Itylus however got along with his cousins, and often slept with them, in particular with Amaleus, Amphion and Niobe&#x27;s firstborn. One day, Aëdon instructed Itylus to sleep in the innermost position of the bed that night. However Itylus forgot his mother&#x27;s words, and so when Aëdon entered the bedroom with a knife at hand intending to kill Amaleus in his sleep, she killed her own son. Alternatively Aëdon could not tell who was which in the darkness. Another version states that she did manage to kill Amaleus as she wished, but then in fear of Niobe&#x27;s reaction to the murder she knowingly killed her own child as well.

Aëdon mourned her only son greatly, and thus Zeus, the father of Amphion and Zethus, transformed her into a nightingale when Zethus began to hunt her down following Itylus&#x27;s murder. A Homeric scholiast attributed the story of Aëdon killing her son in her effort to murder Niobe&#x27;s to Pherecydes, a historian who lived during the fifth century BC. In this story Aëdon becomes Niobe&#x27;s rival in the same way Leto does in the more known story concerning Niobe, both mothers of two children, boy and girl, who are threatened by Niobe&#x27;s vast progeny. Aëdon thus occupies the same position as the goddess, but unlike Leto, she does not have the power to smite Niobe, and instead her efforts end in grief.

In yet another version, Aëdon was married to Zetes, one of the sons of the north wind god Boreas (perhaps a mixing up of the names Zethus and Zetes, as Zetes is otherwise unrelated to the story). Aëdon began suspecting (perhaps correctly) that Zetes had fallen in love with a hamadryad nymph, and further suspected that their son Aëtylus knew and was helping his father carry out the affair and covering up for him. In anger, Aëdon killed her son after he returned one day from hunting. In pity, Aphrodite changed the mother into a nightingale, which to this day mourns for her child.

It has been argued that Penelope chooses to mention Aëdon&#x27;s story is because she is indirectly indicating her own desire to protect her son Telemachus, himself an only child who must hold his own against numerous male rivals and now as a grown-up acts independently of her like Itylus ignored his mother&#x27;s orders, against danger.

=== Asia Minor ===
According to a later tradition preserved in Antoninus Liberalis, Aëdon is instead the daughter of Pandareus and the wife of Polytechnus, an artist from Colophon. The couple boasted that they loved each other more than Hera and Zeus did. Hera sent Eris to cause trouble between the two of them. Polytechnus was then making a chair, and Aëdon a piece of embroidery, and they agreed that whoever should finish the work first should receive from the other a female slave as the prize. Polytechnos was furious when Aëdon (with Hera&#x27;s help) won.

Obligated to find his wife a slave, he went to Aëdon&#x27;s father, and pretending that his wife wished to see her sister Chelidon, he took her with him. On his way home he raped her, dressed her in slave&#x27;s attire, commanded her into silence, and gave her to his wife as the promised prize. After some time Chelidon, believing herself unobserved, lamented her own fate, but she was overheard by Aëdon, and the two sisters conspired against Polytechnus for revenge. They murdered Polytechnos&#x27; son Itys and served him up as a meal to his father.

Aëdon then fled with Chelidon to her father, who, when Polytechnus came in pursuit of his wife, had him bound, smeared with honey, and exposed to the insects. Aëdon now took pity upon the sufferings of her husband, and when her relations were on the point of killing her for this weakness, Zeus changed Polytechnus into a woodpecker, the brother of Aëdon into a whoop, her father into a sea-eagle, her mother into a kingfisher, Chelidon into a swallow, and Aëdon herself into a nightingale.

== Origin ==
All versions of the story provide an &quot;aetion&quot; for the nightingale&#x27;s song, as the mournful Aëdon (and Procne) spends her new life lamenting the death of her child. In reality however when it comes to nightingales the female of the species does not sing, only the male.

The Anatolian variation seems to have originated in mere etymologies, and is of the same class as that about Philomela and Procne; Procne was an Athenian princess who married Tereus, the king of Thrace, and had a son named Itys with him. Tereus then raped and mutilated Procne&#x27;s sister Philomela, who informed her sister of the deed with a tapestry. Procne and Philomela then slew Itys and served him to his father, who chased down the two sisters until all three were changed into birds.

Joseph Fontenrose identified five versions of Aëdon&#x27;s legend, dubbing them F, G, H, J and K (A through E cover the different versions of Athamas&#x27;s myth, which have structural similarities with Aëdon&#x27;s); F is the version with Aëtylus and the hamadryad, G the version with Niobe and Amaleus, H the one with Polytechnus and Chelidon set in Asia Minor, J is the most well-known one starring Procne and Philomela, with K as a variation of J in which Tereus lies about Procne dying in order to marry Philomela whom he later gives to another king named Lynceus.

Fontenrose noted the similarities of the Aëdon group with the Athamas group, namely the themes of polygamy, the birth and death of multiple children, the concealment or disguise of another woman, a rivalry of a wife and a mistress figure, and a woman killing her own child by mistake, which end in bird metamorphosis.

Homer knew about Pandareus&#x27;s daughter the Nightingale (Aëdon) who married to Zethus and killed her son Itys, but makes no mention of the Swallow (Chelidon); Hesiod and Sappho both say that the Swallow is the daughter of Pandion I (Athenian king, the father of Philomela). Moreover, a sixth-century BC metope from Apollo&#x27;s temple at Thermos depicts the Nightingale and the Swallow plotting together over something that has been broken off. It is thus likely that the version Pherecydes and Homer were familiar with was a form of version G, though the metope and Hesiod hint to an early story of the H-J-K type. The name Tereus is first attested in Aeschylus, as the husband of Aëdon/the Nightingale who killed her own son.

So while there is precedent for the child murder, it seems that the rape and mutilation of the sister were introduced by Sophocles in his lost &quot;Tereus&quot; play, where he likely also introduced &#x27;Procne&#x27; and &#x27;Philomela&#x27; as the names for the Nightingale and the Swallow, as well as the Thracian setting. The myth can thus be interpreted as F with the names from J-K and a sister-in-law in place of the hamadryad. Fontenrose suggests that Homer knew of a story of two rival wives, one of which plotted against the other&#x27;s child; the story then deviated in two ways; the second wife, which was identified with the swallow, became either a sister-in-law (husband&#x27;s brother&#x27;s wife) or a sister and a mistress to the husband.

Aëdon is traditionally the daughter of Pandareus, himself associated with Crete or the western coast of Asia Minor, while Procne&#x27;s father is the Athenian Pandion. It is possible that when Aëdon&#x27;s story crossed the Aegean, Pandareus became confused with Pandion due to their names&#x27; similarity, and thus the nightingale and the swallow joined the Athenian mythos, as foreign intruders; Philomela and Procne are otherwise detached from the rest of the traditions surrounding the Athenian royal family. Furthermore, in the Theban setting, Aëdon&#x27;s husband Zethus and rival Niobe also seem like an interpolation; Zethus and Amphion act as a parenthesis in the bloodline of Cadmus, and Niobe usually has a home at Mount Sipylus in Asia Minor.

<text>Charles VI (3 December 136821 October 1422), nicknamed the Beloved () and in the 19th century, the Mad ( or &quot;le Fou&quot;), was King of France from 1380 until his death in 1422. He is known for his mental illness and psychotic episodes that plagued him throughout his life.

Charles ascended the throne at age 11, his father Charles V leaving behind a favorable military situation, marked by the reconquest of most of the English possessions in France. Charles VI was placed under the regency of his uncles: Philip II, Duke of Burgundy; Louis I, Duke of Anjou; John, Duke of Berry; and Louis II, Duke of Bourbon. He decided in 1388, aged 20, to emancipate himself. In 1392, while leading a military expedition against the Duchy of Brittany, the king had his first attack of delirium, during which he attacked his own men in the forest of Le Mans. A few months later, following the &quot;Bal des Ardents&quot; (January 1393) where he narrowly escaped death from burning, Charles was again placed under the regency of his uncles, the Dukes of Berry and Burgundy.

From then on, and until his death, Charles alternated between periods of mental instability and lucidity. Power was held by his influential uncles and by his wife, Queen Isabeau. His younger brother, Louis I, Duke of Orléans, also aspired to the regency and saw his influence grow. The enmity between the Duke of Orléans and his cousin John the Fearless, successor of Philip the Bold as Duke of Burgundy, plunged France into the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War of 1407–1435, during which the king found himself successively controlled by one or the other of the two parties.

In 1415, Charles&#x27;s army was crushed by the English at the Battle of Agincourt. The king subsequently signed the Treaty of Troyes, which entirely disinherited his son, the Dauphin and future Charles VII, in favour of Henry V of England. Henry was thus made regent and heir to the throne of France, and Charles married his daughter Catherine to Henry. However, Henry died shortly before Charles, which gave the House of Valois the chance to continue the fight against the House of Lancaster, leading to eventual Valois victory and the end of the Hundred Years&#x27; War in 1453. Charles was succeeded in law by his grandson (Henry V&#x27;s son), the infant Henry VI of England, but Charles&#x27;s own son was crowned first in Reims Cathedral and was widely regarded even before his coronation as the true heir by the French people.

==Early life==
Charles VI was born in Paris, in the royal residence of the Hôtel Saint-Pol, on 3 December 1368, the son of King Charles V of the House of Valois and of Joanna of Bourbon. As the eldest son of the king, Charles was heir to the French throne and held the title Dauphin of France.

==King of France==
===Regency===
At his father&#x27;s death on 16 September 1380, Charles inherited the throne of France. His coronation took place on 4 November at Reims Cathedral. Charles was only eleven years old when he was crowned king. During his minority, France was ruled by Charles&#x27;s uncles as regents. Although the royal age of majority was 14 (the &quot;age of accountability&quot; under Roman Catholic canon law), Charles was 21 when he formally terminated the regency.

The regents were Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, Louis I, Duke of Anjou, and John, Duke of Berry – all brothers of Charles V – along with Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, Charles VI&#x27;s maternal uncle. Philip took the dominant role during the regency. Louis of Anjou was fighting for his claim to the Kingdom of Naples after 1382, dying in 1384; John of Berry was concerned only with his interests in Languedoc, and not particularly enthusiastic with royal politics; and Louis of Bourbon was a largely unimportant figure, owing to his eccentric personality (showing signs of mental illness) and low status (since he did not belong to the royal bloodline).

During the regency, the financial resources of the kingdom, painstakingly built up by Charles V, were squandered for the personal profit of the dukes, whose interests were frequently divergent or even opposing. The new royal administration took steps to centralize power by usurping control of political offices and reimposing several unpopular taxes. The latter policy represented a reversal of the deathbed decision by Charles V to repeal them, and led to tax revolts, known as the &quot;Harelle&quot;. The dukes also engaged in state capture; for instance, the Battle of Roosebeke (1382) was fought solely for Philip&#x27;s benefit.

Charles VI finally stripped his corrupt uncles of their positions in 1388. To guide his rule, he restored to office the highly competent advisors of Charles V, known as the Marmousets, who ushered in a new period of high esteem for the crown. Charles VI was initially referred to as &quot;Charles the Beloved&quot; by his subjects.
===Mental illness===

Charles VI&#x27;s early successes with the Marmousets as his counselors quickly dissipated as a result of the bouts of psychosis he experienced from his mid-twenties. Mental illness may have been passed on for several generations through his mother, Joanna of Bourbon with familial schizophrenia syndrome. Some mental illnesses Charles VI of France might have suffered from are familial schizophrenia syndrome, typhus, bipolar disorder, arsenic poisoning. Arsenic poisoning had more physical symptoms rather than psychological. Typhus can explain why he had a skin plaque/rash along with his fits of delirium. Although still called by his subjects &quot;Charles the Beloved&quot;, he became known also as &quot;Charles the Mad&quot;.

Charles&#x27;s first known episode occurred in 1392 when his friend and advisor, Olivier de Clisson, was the victim of an attempted murder. Although Clisson survived, the king was determined to punish the would-be assassin, Pierre de Craon, who had taken refuge in Brittany. John V, Duke of Brittany, was unwilling to hand him over, so Charles prepared a military expedition.

Contemporaries reported that Charles appeared to be in a &quot;fever&quot; to begin the campaign and was disconnected in his speech. He set off with an army on 1 July 1392. The progress of the army was slow, driving Charles into a frenzy of impatience. As the king and his escort were traveling through the forest near Le Mans on a hot August morning, a barefoot leper dressed in rags rushed up to the king&#x27;s horse and grabbed his bridle. &quot;Ride no further, noble King!&quot; he yelled: &quot;Turn back! You are betrayed!&quot; The king&#x27;s escorts beat the man back but did not arrest him, and he followed the procession for half an hour, repeating his cries.

After the company emerged from the forest at noon, a page who was drowsy from the sun dropped the king&#x27;s lance, which clanged loudly against a steel helmet carried by another page. Charles shuddered, drew his sword and yelled, &quot;Forward against the traitors! They wish to deliver me to the enemy!&quot; The king then drew his sword, spurred his mount, and attacked his own knights before one of his chamberlains and a group of soldiers were able to grab him from his mount and lay him on the ground. He lay still and did not react, but then fell into a coma; as a temporary measure, he was taken to the castle of Creil, where it was hoped that good air and pleasant surroundings might bring him to his senses. The king had killed a knight known as &quot;The Bastard of Polignac&quot; and several other men during the attack.

Periods of mental illness continued throughout Charles&#x27;s life. During one episode in 1393, he could not remember his name and did not know he was king. When his wife came to visit, he asked his servants who she was and ordered them to help her so he would be left alone. During another episode in 1395–96, the king claimed he was Saint George and that his coat of arms was a lion with a sword thrust through it. At this time, he recognized all the officers of his household, but did not know his wife nor his children. Sometimes the king ran wildly through the corridors of the Hôtel Saint-Pol, and to keep him inside, the entrances were walled up. In 1405, he refused to bathe or change his clothes for five months.

Charles&#x27;s later psychotic episodes were not described in detail, perhaps because of the similarity of his behavior and delusions. Pope Pius II, who was born during the reign of Charles VI, wrote in his &quot;Commentaries&quot; that there were times when Charles thought that he was made of glass, and thus tried to protect himself in various ways so that he would not break. He reportedly had iron rods sewn into his clothes so that he would not shatter if he came into contact with another person. This condition has come to be known as glass delusion.

Charles&#x27;s secretary, Pierre Salmon, spent much time in discussions with the king while he was intermittently psychotic. In an effort to find a cure for his illness, stabilize the turbulent political situation and secure his own future, Salmon supervised the production of two distinct versions of the beautifully illuminated guidebooks to good kingship known as his &quot;Dialogues&quot;.

===&quot;Bal des Ardents&quot;===

On 29 January 1393, a masked ball, which later became known as the &quot;Bal des Ardents&quot; (&quot;Ball of the Burning Men&quot;), was organized by Isabeau of Bavaria to celebrate the wedding of one of her ladies-in-waiting at the Hôtel Saint-Pol. At the suggestion of Huguet de Guisay, the king and four other lords dressed up as wild men and performed a dance while dressed &quot;in costumes of linen cloth sewn onto their bodies and soaked in resinous wax or pitch to hold a covering of frazzled hemp, so that they appeared shaggy &amp; hairy from head to foot.&quot;

At the suggestion of one Yvain de Foix, the king commanded that the torch-bearers were to stand at the side of the room. Nonetheless, the king&#x27;s younger brother Louis I, Duke of Orléans, who had arrived late, approached with a lighted torch to discover the identity of the dancers, and accidentally set one of them on fire. There was panic as the flames spread. The Duchess of Berry threw the train of her gown over the king to protect him. Several knights who tried to put out the flames were severely burned. Four of the dancers perished: Charles de Poitiers, son of the Count of Valentinois; Huguet de Guisay; Yvain de Foix; and the Count of Joigny. Another – Jean, son of the Lord of Nantouillet – saved himself by jumping into a dishwater tub.

===Expulsion of the Jews, 1394===
On 17 September 1394, Charles suddenly published an ordinance in which he declared, in substance, that for a long time he had been taking note of the many complaints provoked by the excesses and misdemeanors of the Jews against Christians, and that the prosecutors had made several investigations and discovered that the Jews broke the agreement with the king on many occasions. Therefore, the king decreed, as an irrevocable law and statute, that no Jew would dwell in his domains (&quot;Ordonnances&quot;, vii. 675). According to the Monk of St. Denis, the king signed this decree at the insistence of Isabeau (&quot;Chron. de Charles VI.&quot; ii. 119). The decree was not immediately enforced, a respite being granted to the Jews so that they have enough time to sell their property and pay their debts. Those indebted to them were enjoined to redeem their obligations within a set time; otherwise their pledges held in pawn were to be sold by the Jews. The provost was to escort the Jews to the frontier of the kingdom. Subsequently, the king released Christians from their debts.

===Struggles for power===
With Charles mentally ill, from 1393 his wife Isabeau presided over a regency council, on which sat the grandees of the kingdom. Philip the Bold, who acted as regent during the king&#x27;s minority (from 1380 to 1388), was initially a great influence on the queen. However, influence progressively shifted to Orléans, the king&#x27;s brother, who was not only another contender for power, but, it was suspected, the queen&#x27;s lover as well. Charles&#x27;s other uncles were less influential during the regency: Louis of Naples was still engaged managing the Kingdom of Naples, and John of Berry served as a mediator between the Orléans party (what would become the &quot;Armagnacs&quot;) and the Burgundy party (&quot;Bourguignons&quot;). The rivalry would increase bit by bit and eventually result in outright civil war.

The new regents dismissed the various advisers and officials Charles had appointed. On the death of Philip the Bold in April 1404, his son John the Fearless took over the political aims of his father, and the feud with Orléans escalated.

===Wars with Burgundy and England===
In 1407, Orléans was murdered in the &quot;rue Vieille du Temple&quot; in Paris. John the Fearless did not deny responsibility, claiming that Orléans was a tyrant who squandered money. Orléans&#x27; son Charles, the new Duke of Orléans, turned to his father-in-law, Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac, for support against John the Fearless. This resulted in the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War, which lasted from 1407 until 1435, beyond Charles&#x27;s reign, though the war with the English was still in progress.

With the English taking over much of France, John the Fearless sought to end the feud with the royal family by negotiating with the Dauphin Charles VII, the king&#x27;s heir. They met at the bridge at Montereau on 10 September 1419, but during the meeting, John the Fearless was killed by Tanneguy du Chastel, a follower of the Dauphin. His successor, Philip the Good, the new Duke of Burgundy, threw in his lot with the English.

===English invasion and death===
Charles VI&#x27;s reign was marked by the continuing conflict with the English, known as the Hundred Years&#x27; War. An early attempt at peace occurred in 1396 when his daughter, the almost seven-year-old Isabella of Valois, married the 29-year-old Richard II of England. By 1415, however, the feud between the French royal family and the House of Burgundy led to chaos and anarchy throughout France, a situation that Henry V of England was eager to take advantage of. Henry led an invasion that culminated in the defeat of the French army at the Battle of Agincourt in October.

On 21 May 1420, Henry V and Charles VI signed the Treaty of Troyes, which named Henry as Charles&#x27;s successor and stipulated that Henry&#x27;s heirs would succeed him on the throne of France. It disinherited the Dauphin Charles, then only aged 17. (In 1421, it was implied in Burgundian propaganda that the young Charles was illegitimate.) The treaty also betrothed Charles VI&#x27;s daughter, Catherine of Valois, to Henry. Disinheriting the Dauphin in favor of Henry was a blatant act against the interests of the French aristocracy, supported by the Duke of Burgundy. The Dauphin, who had declared himself regent for his father when the Duke of Burgundy invaded Paris and captured the king, had established a court at Bourges.

Charles VI died on 21 October 1422 in Paris, at the Hôtel Saint-Pol. He was interred in Saint Denis Basilica, where his wife Isabeau would join him after her death in September 1435.

Henry V died just a few weeks before Charles, in August 1422, leaving an infant son, who became King Henry VI of England. Therefore, according to the Treaty of Troyes, with the death of Charles VI, Henry VI became King of France. His coronation as such was in Paris (held by the English since 1418) at the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris on 26 December 1431.

The son disinherited by Charles VI, the Dauphin Charles, continued the fight to regain his kingdom. In 1429, Joan of Arc led his forces to victory against the English and took him to be crowned in Reims Cathedral as King Charles VII on 17 July 1429. He became known as &quot;Charles the Victorious&quot; and was able to restore the French line to the throne of France by defeating the English in 1450.

<doc id="77414" wikidata="Q171876" url="?curid=77414" title="Antinous">
<text>Antinous, also called Antinoös, (; ; – ) was a Greek youth from Bithynia and a favourite and lover of the Roman emperor Hadrian. Following his premature death before his 20th birthday, Antinous was deified on Hadrian&#x27;s orders, being worshipped in both the Greek East and Latin West, sometimes as a god () and sometimes merely as a hero ().

Little is known of Antinous&#x27;s life, although it is known that he was born in Claudiopolis (present day Bolu, Turkey), in the Roman province of Bithynia et Pontus. He was probably introduced to Hadrian in 123, before being taken to Italy for a higher education. He had become the favourite of Hadrian by 128, when he was taken on a tour of the Roman Empire as part of Hadrian&#x27;s personal retinue. Antinous accompanied Hadrian during his attendance of the annual Eleusinian Mysteries in Athens, and was with him when he killed the Marousian lion in Libya, an event highly publicised by the Emperor. In October 130, as they were part of a flotilla going along the Nile, Antinous died amid mysterious circumstances. Various suggestions have been put forward for how he died, ranging from an accidental drowning to an intentional human sacrifice or suicide.

Following his death, Hadrian deified Antinous and founded an organised cult devoted to his worship that spread throughout the Empire. Hadrian founded the city of Antinoöpolis close to Antinous&#x27;s place of death, which became a cultic centre for the worship of Osiris-Antinous. Hadrian also founded games in commemoration of Antinous to take place in both Antinoöpolis and Athens, with Antinous becoming a symbol of Hadrian&#x27;s dreams of pan-Hellenism. The worship of Antinous proved to be one of the most enduring and popular of cults of deified humans in the Roman empire, and events continued to be founded in his honour long after Hadrian&#x27;s death.

Antinous became a symbol of male homosexuality in Western culture, appearing in the work of Oscar Wilde, Fernando Pessoa and Marguerite Yourcenar.

==Biography==
===Birth and childhood===

Antinous was born to a Greek family near the city of Claudiopolis, which was located in the Roman province of Bithynia, in what is now north-west Turkey. He was born in the territory to the east of the city called Mantineion, a rural locality:

The year of Antinous&#x27;s birth is not recorded, although it is estimated that it was probably between 110 and 112 CE. Early sources record that his birthday was in November, and although the exact date is not known, Royston Lambert, one of Antinous&#x27;s biographers, asserted that it was probably on 27 November. Given the location of his birth and his physical appearance, it is likely that part of his ancestry was not Greek.

===Status===
There are various potential origins for the name &quot;Antinous&quot;; it is possible that he was named after the character of Antinous of Ithaca, who is one of Penelope&#x27;s suitors in Homer&#x27;s epic poem, the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Another possibility is that he was given the male equivalent of &quot;Antinoë&quot;, the name of a woman who was one of the founding figures of Mantineia, a city which probably had close relations with Bithynia. Although many historians from the Renaissance onward asserted that Antinous had been a slave, only one of around fifty early sources claims that. This possibility remains unlikely, as it would have proven heavily controversial to deify a former slave in Roman society. There is no surviving reliable evidence attesting to Antinous&#x27;s family background, although Lambert believed it most likely that his family would have been peasant farmers or small business owners, thereby being socially undistinguished yet not from the poorest sectors of society. Lambert also considered it likely that Antinous would have had a basic education as a child, having been taught how to read and write.

===Life with Hadrian===

The Emperor Hadrian spent much time during his reign touring his empire, and arrived in Claudiopolis in June 123, which was probably when he first encountered Antinous. Given Hadrian&#x27;s personality, Lambert thought it unlikely that they had become lovers at this point, instead suggesting it probable that Antinous had been selected to be sent to Italy, where he was probably schooled at the imperial paedagogium at the Caelian Hill. Hadrian meanwhile had continued to tour the empire, only returning to Italy in September 125, when he settled into his villa at Tibur. It was at some point over the following three years that Antinous became his personal favourite, for by the time he left for Greece three years later, he brought Antinous with him in his personal retinue:

Lambert described Antinous as &quot;the one person who seems to have connected most profoundly with Hadrian&quot; throughout the latter&#x27;s life. Hadrian&#x27;s marriage to Sabina was unhappy, and there is no reliable evidence that he ever expressed a sexual attraction for women, in contrast to much reliable early evidence that he was sexually attracted to boys and young men. For centuries, pederasty existed among Greece&#x27;s leisured and citizen classes, with an older (the &quot;lover,&quot; aged between 20 and 40) undertaking a sexual relationship with an (the &quot;beloved,&quot; aged between 12 and 18) and taking a key role in his (the latter&#x27;s) education. There is no historical evidence available to support at what age Antinous became a favourite of Hadrian. Such a societal institution of pederasty was not indigenous to Roman culture, although the practice was somewhat common among the patricians.

It is known that Hadrian believed Antinous to be intelligent and wise, and that they had a shared love of hunting, which was seen as a particularly manly pursuit in Roman culture. Although none survive, it is known that Hadrian wrote both an autobiography and erotic poetry about his boy favourites; it is therefore likely that he wrote about Antinous. During their relationship, there is no evidence that Antinous ever used his influence over Hadrian for personal or political gain.

In March 127, Hadrian – probably accompanied by Antinous – travelled through the Sabine area of Italy, Picenum, and Campania. From 127 to 129, the Emperor was then afflicted with an illness that doctors were unable to explain. In April 128, he laid the foundation stone for a temple of Venus and Rome in the city of Rome, during a ritual where he may well have been accompanied by Antinous. From there, Hadrian went on a tour of North Africa, during which he was accompanied by Antinous. In late 128, Hadrian and Antinous landed in Corinth, proceeding to Athens, where they remained until May 129, accompanied by Empress Sabina; the Caesernii brothers, frequent companions of the Emperor; and Pedanius Fuscus the Younger (a great-nephew of Hadrian). It was in Athens in September 128 that they attended the annual celebrations of the Great Mysteries of Eleusis, where Hadrian was initiated into the position of in the Telesterion. It is generally agreed, although not proven, that Antinous was also initiated at that time.

From there they headed to Asia Minor, settling in Antioch in June 129, where they were based for a year, visiting Syria, Arabia, and Judaea. From there, Hadrian became increasingly critical of Jewish culture, which he feared opposed Romanisation, and so introduced policies banning circumcision and building a Temple of Zeus-Jupiter on the former site of the Jewish Temple. From there, they headed to Egypt. Arriving in Alexandria in August 130, there they visited the sarcophagus of Alexander the Great. Although welcomed with public praise and ceremony, some of Hadrian&#x27;s appointments and actions angered the city&#x27;s Hellenic social elite, who began to gossip about his sexual activities, including those with Antinous.

Soon after, and probably in September 130, Hadrian and Antinous travelled west to Libya, where they had heard of a Marousian lion causing problems for local people. They hunted down the lion, and although the exact events are unclear, it is apparent that Hadrian saved Antinous&#x27;s life during their confrontation with it, before the beast itself was killed. Hadrian widely publicised the event, casting bronze medallions of it, getting historians to write about it, commissioning Pancrates to write a poem about it, and having a &quot;tondo&quot; depicting it created which was later placed on the Arch of Constantine. On this &quot;tondo&quot; it was clear that Antinous was no longer a youth, having become more muscular and hairier, perceptibly more able to resist his master; and thus, it is likely that his relationship with Hadrian was changing as a result.

Throughout history there has been much controversy concerning the relationship between Hadrian and Antinous. In Royston Lambert&#x27;s book &quot;Beloved and God&quot;, he writes &quot;But as far as the central issues go – the history of Antinous, his relationship with Hadrian and the death – we have precious little more information than the earliest writers.&quot; Many of these early writers were biased towards Hadrian especially in regard to his relationship with Antinous.

The controversy surrounding the relationship between Hadrian and Antinous is due to a lack of extant evidence for where Antinous was during the years from 123–130 CE. The first mention of Antinous is from Pancrates and his Lion Hunt poem from 130 CE.

Hard evidence regarding Antinous&#x27;s life is available in the form of the Pincian obelisk on Pincian Hill. On the west side of the relief is a mutilated phrase which states &quot;he grew up to be a beautiful youth&quot;. This would suggest that Antinous was already an ephebe and that he was established in his home in Bithynia when he met Hadrian. Many scholars believe, with the circumstantial evidence, that the relationship of Hadrian and Antinous lasted approximately three years: from 127 CE to October 130 CE, when Antinous drowned in the Nile. The conclusion is that there is little documentation for or about the actual relationship of Hadrian and Antinous.

===Death===

In late September or early October 130, Hadrian and his entourage, among them Antinous, assembled at Heliopolis to set sail upstream as part of a flotilla along the River Nile. The retinue included officials, the Prefect, army and naval commanders, as well as literary and scholarly figures. Possibly also joining them was Lucius Ceionius Commodus, a young aristocrat whom Antinous might have deemed a rival to Hadrian&#x27;s affections. On their journey up the Nile, they stopped at Hermopolis Magna, the primary shrine to the god Thoth. It was shortly after this, in October 130 – around the time of the festival of Osiris – that Antinous fell into the river and died, probably from drowning. Hadrian publicly announced his death, with gossip soon spreading throughout the Empire that Antinous had been intentionally killed. The nature of Antinous&#x27;s death remains a mystery to this day; however, various speculations have been put forward:

# One possibility is that he was murdered by a conspiracy at court. However, Lambert asserted that this was unlikely because it lacked any supporting historical evidence, and because Antinous himself seemingly exerted little influence over Hadrian, thus meaning that an assassination served little purpose. However, a faction looking to replace Hadrian&#x27;s attention or affection can&#x27;t be ruled out.
# Some scholars suggest that Antinous may have been killed by Hadrian himself, either in an attempt by the latter to regain his health, or during an argument between the two. Elizabeth Speller, one of Hadrian&#x27;s biographers, notes that the second idea aligns with the emperor&#x27;s well-documented fits of anger and violence. However, most scholars reject the notion that Hadrian murdered his own lover, judging by his overwhelming grief at Antinous&#x27;s death.
# Another suggestion is that Antinous had died during a voluntary castration as part of an attempt to retain his youth and thus his sexual appeal to Hadrian. However, this is improbable because Hadrian deemed both castration and circumcision to be abominations and, as Antinous was aged between 18 and 20 at the time of death, any such operation would have been ineffective.
# A fourth possibility is that the death was accidental, perhaps because Antinous was intoxicated. According to his now-lost memoirs, Hadrian himself believed this to be the case.
# Another possibility is that Antinous represented a voluntary human sacrifice. The earliest surviving suggestion of this comes from the writings of Dio Cassius, 80 years after the event, although it was subsequently repeated in many later sources. In the 2nd-century Roman Empire, a belief that the death of one could rejuvenate the health of another was widespread, and Hadrian had been ill for many years; in this scenario, Antinous could have sacrificed himself in the belief that Hadrian would have recovered. If this last situation were true, Hadrian might not have revealed the cause of Antinous&#x27;s death because he did not wish to appear either physically or politically weak. Conversely, opposing this possibility is the fact that Hadrian disliked human sacrifice and had strengthened laws against it in the Empire.

== Deification and the cult of Antinous ==
Hadrian was devastated by the death of Antinous, with contemporaries attesting that he &quot;wept like a woman.&quot; In Egypt, the local priesthood immediately deified Antinous by identifying him with Osiris due to the manner of his death. In keeping with Egyptian custom, Antinous&#x27;s body was probably embalmed and mummified by priests, a lengthy process which might explain why Hadrian remained in Egypt until spring 131. While there, in October 130, Hadrian proclaimed Antinous to be a deity and announced that a city should be built on the site of his death in commemoration of him, to be called Antinoöpolis. The deification of human beings was not uncommon in the Classical world. However, the public and formal divinisation of humans was reserved for the Emperor and members of the imperial family. Thus, Hadrian&#x27;s decision to declare Antinous a god and create a formal cult devoted to him was highly unusual, and he did so without the permission of the Roman Senate. The Emperor was criticised for his immense grief at Antinous&#x27;s death, especially considering that he had delayed the apotheosis of his own sister Paulina when she died. Although the cult of Antinous therefore had connections with the Roman imperial cult, it remained separate and distinct. Hadrian also identified a star in the sky between the Eagle and the Zodiac to be Antinous, and came to associate the rosy lotus that grew on the banks of the Nile as being the flower of Antinous.

It is unknown exactly where Antinous&#x27;s body was buried. It has been argued that either his body or some relics associated with him would have been interred at a shrine in Antinoöpolis, although this has yet to be identified archaeologically. However, a surviving obelisk contains an inscription strongly suggesting that Antinous&#x27;s body was interred at Hadrian&#x27;s country estate, the Villa Adriana at Tibur in Italy.

It is unclear whether Hadrian genuinely believed that Antinous had become a god. He would have also had political motives for creating the organised cult, for it enshrined political and personal loyalties specifically to him. In October 131, Hadrian proceeded to Athens, where from 131/32 he founded the Panhellenion, an attempt to nurture consciousness of Greek identity, to erode the feuding endemic to the Greek city-states, and to promote the worship of the ancient gods; being Greek himself, Antinous as a god assisted Hadrian&#x27;s cause in this, presenting a symbol of pan-Hellenic unity. In Athens, Hadrian also established a festival to be held in honour of Antinous in October, the Antinoeia.

Antinous was understood differently by his various worshippers, in part due to regional and cultural variation. In some inscriptions he is identified as a divine hero, in others as a god, and in others as both a divine hero and a god. In Egypt, he was often understood as a daemon. Inscriptions indicate that Antinous was seen primarily as a benevolent deity, who could be turned to aid his worshipers and cure them of ailments. He was also seen as a conqueror of death, with his name and image often being included in coffins. In the west, Antinous was associated with the Celtic sun-god Belenos.

Emperor Hadrian established quinquennial games and annual celebrations in honour of Antinous which were called Antinoea (τὰ Ἀντινόεια).

===Antinoöpolis===
The city of Antinoöpolis was erected on the site of Hir-we. All previous buildings were razed and replaced, with the exception of the Temple of Ramses II. Hadrian also had political motives for the creation of Antinoöpolis, which was to be the first Hellenic city in the Middle Nile region, thus serving as a bastion of Greek culture within the Egyptian area. To encourage Egyptians to integrate with this imported Greek culture, he permitted Greeks and Egyptians in the city to marry and allowed the main deity of Hir-we, Bes, to continue to be worshipped in Antinoöpolis alongside the new primary deity, Osiris-Antinous. He encouraged Greeks from elsewhere to settle in the new city, using various incentives to do so. The city was designed on a Hippodamian grid that was typical of Hellenic cities, and embellished with columns and many statues of Antinous, as well as a temple devoted to the deity.

Hadrian proclaimed that games would be held at the city in Spring 131 in commemoration of Antinous. Known as the Antinoeia, they would be held annually for several centuries, being noted as the most important in Egypt. Events included athletic competitions, chariot and equestrian races, and artistic and musical festivals, with prizes including citizenship, money, tokens, and free lifetime maintenance.

Antinoöpolis continued to grow into the Byzantine era, being Christianised with the conversion of the Empire. However, it retained an association with magic for centuries to come. Over the centuries, stone from the Hadrianic city was removed for the construction of homes and mosques. By the 18th century, the ruins of Antinoöpolis were still visible, being recorded by such European travellers as Jesuit missionary Claude Sicard in 1715 and Edme-François Jomard the surveyor . However, in the 19th century, Antinoöpolis was almost completely destroyed by local industrial production, as the chalk and limestone were burned for powder while stone was used in the construction of a nearby dam and sugar factory.

An excavation of the city in the early twentieth century revealed a relatively realistic funeral tondo painted on wood. Although the men in the portrait are traditionally identified as brothers, there is speculation that they were lovers, the reason for this being that behind the beardless figure is a representation of Antinous-Osiris, the only pictorial representation that has survived of a statue of the deified young man.

===The cult&#x27;s spread===

Hadrian was keen to disseminate the cult of Antinous throughout the Roman Empire. He focused on its spread within the Greek lands, and in Summer 131 travelled these areas promoting it by presenting Antinous in a syncretised form with the more familiar deity Hermes. On a visit to Trapezus in 131, he proclaimed the foundation of a temple devoted to Hermes, where the deity was probably venerated as Hermes-Antinous. Although Hadrian preferred to associate Antinous with Hermes, he was far more widely syncretised with the god Dionysus across the Empire.
The cult also spread through Egypt, and within a few years of its foundation, altars and temples to the god had been erected in Hermopolis, Alexandria, Oxyrhynchus, Tebytnis, Lykopolis, and Luxor.

The cult of Antinous was never as large as those of well-established deities such as Zeus, Dionysus, Demeter, or Asclepios, or even as large as those of cults which were growing in popularity at that time, such as Isis or Serapis and was also smaller than the official imperial cult of Hadrian himself. However, it spread rapidly throughout the Empire, with traces of the cult having been found in at least 70 cities. The cult was most popular in Egypt, Greece, Asia Minor, and the North African coast, but a large community of worshippers also existed in Italy, Spain, and northwestern Europe. Artefacts in honour of Antinous have been found in an area that spans from Britain to the Danube.

Although the adoption of the Antinous cult was in some cases done to please Hadrian, the evidence makes it clear that the cult was also genuinely popular among the different societal classes in the Empire. Archaeological finds point that Antinous was worshipped in both public and private settings. In Egypt, Athens, Macedonia, and Italy, children would be named after the deity. Part of the appeal was that Antinous had once been an ordinary person himself, and thus was more relatable than many other deities. It is also possible, however, that his cult borrowed power from parallels between Antinous and beautiful young male immortals in the Greco-Roman pantheon like Apollo, Dionysus, and Silvanus as well as mortal youths beloved by gods in classical mythology like Ganymede, Hylas, Hyacinth, and Narcissus, and that images of the sensuous youth invited imaginary erotic bonding between him and his worshippers. These characteristics were common also to the cults of Attis, Endymion, and Adonis. Like the latter, Antinous was treated as a dying-and-rising god not only in Egypt, but in Rome and Greece; the Obelisk of Antinous in Rome describes the honour and, &quot;Osirantinous&quot; as &quot;the Reborn&quot; and &quot;the Everlasting.&quot;
At least 28 temples were constructed for the worship of Antinous throughout the Empire, although most were fairly modest in design; those at Tarsos, Philadelphia, and Lanuvium consisted of a four-column portico. It is likely, however, that those which Hadrian was directly involved in, such as at Antinoöpolis, Bithynion, and Mantineia, were often grander, while in the majority of cases, shrines or altars to Antinous would have been erected in or near the pre-existing temples of the imperial cult, or Dionysus or Hermes. Worshippers would have given votive offerings to the deity at these altars; there is evidence that he was given gifts of food and drink in Egypt, with libations and sacrifices probably being common in Greece. Priests devoted to Antinous would have overseen this worship, with the names of some of these individuals having survived in inscriptions. There is evidence of oracles being present at a number of Antinoan temples.

Sculptures of Antinous became widespread, with Hadrian probably having approved a basic model of Antinous&#x27;s likeness for other sculptors to follow. These sculptures were produced in large quantities between 130 and 138, with estimates being in the region of around 2,000, of which at least 115 survive. Forty-four have been found in Italy, half of which were at Hadrian&#x27;s Villa Adriana, while 12 have been found in Greece and Asia Minor, and 6 in Egypt. Over 31 cities in the Empire, the majority in Greece and Asia Minor, issued coins depicting Antinous, chiefly between the years 134–35. Many were designed to be used as medallions rather than currency, some of them deliberately made with a hole so that they could be hung from the neck and used as talismans. Most production of Antinous-based artefacts ceased following the 130s, although such items continued to be used by the cult&#x27;s followers for several centuries. Later survivals of his cult largely rested in the Eastern Roman Empire, where his acceptance into the pantheon of gods was better received.

Games held in honour of Antinous were held in at least 9 cities and included both athletic and artistic components. The games at Bythynion, Antinoöpolis, and Mantineia were still active by the early 3rd century, while those at Athens and Eleusis were still operating in 266–67. Rumours spread throughout the Empire that at Antinous&#x27;s cultic centre in Antinoöpolis, there were &quot;sacred nights&quot; characterised by drunken revelries, perhaps including sexual orgies. The cult of Antinous endured far beyond Hadrian&#x27;s reign. Local coins depicting his effigy were still being struck during Caracalla&#x27;s reign, and he was invoked in a poem to celebrate the accession of Diocletian, who reigned more than a century after Antinous&#x27; death.

===Condemnation and decline===

The cult of Antinous was criticised by various individuals, both pagan and Christian. Critics included followers of other pagan cults, such as Pausanias, Lucian, and the Emperor Julian, who were all sceptical about the apotheosis of Antinous, as well as the Sibylline Oracles, who were critical of Hadrian more generally. The pagan philosopher Celsus also criticised it for what he perceived as the debauched nature of its Egyptian devotees, arguing that it led people into immoral behaviour, in this way comparing it to Christianity. Surviving examples of Christian condemnation of the Antinous cults come from figures like Tertullian, Origen, Jerome, and Epiphanios. Viewing the religion as a blasphemous rival to Christianity, they insisted that Antinous had simply been a mortal human and condemned his sexual activities with Hadrian as immoral. Associating his cult with malevolent magic, they argued that Hadrian had imposed his worship through fear.

During the struggles between Christians and pagan worshippers in Rome during the 4th century, Antinous was championed by members of the latter. As a result of this, the Christian poet Prudentius denounced his worship in 384, while a set of seven contorniates depicting Antinous were issued, based upon the designs of those issued in the 130s. Many sculptures of Antinous were destroyed by Christians, as well as by invading barbarian tribes, although in some instances were then re-erected; the Antinous statue at Delphi had been toppled and had its forearms broken off, before being re-erected in a chapel elsewhere. Many of the images of Antinous remained in public places until the official prohibition of pagan religions under the reign of Emperor Theodosius in 391.

Some contemporary Neo-Pagan groups have re-sacralized Antinous. Because of his same-sex relationship with Hadrian, Antinous&#x27;s modern cult mainly appeals to members of the LGBT community, especially gay men.

== In Roman sculpture ==
Hadrian &quot;turned to Greek sculptors to perpetuate the melancholy beauty, diffident manner, and lithe and sensuous frame of his boyfriend Antinous,&quot; creating in the process what has been described as &quot;the last independent creation of Greco-Roman art&quot;. It is traditionally assumed that they were all produced between Antinous&#x27;s death in 130 and that of Hadrian in 138, on the questionable grounds that no-one else would be interested in commissioning them. The assumption is that official models were sent out to provincial workshops all over the empire to be copied, with local variations permitted. It has been asserted that many of these sculptures &quot;share distinctive features – a broad, swelling chest, a head of tousled curls, a downcast gaze – that allow them to be instantly recognized&quot;.

About a hundred statues of Antinous have been preserved for modernity, a remarkable fact considering that his cult was the target of intense hostility by Christian apologists, many of whom vandalized and destroyed artefacts and temples built in honour of the youth. By 2005, classicist Caroline Vout could note that more images have been identified of Antinous than of any other figure in classical antiquity with the exceptions of Augustus and Hadrian. She also asserted that the Classical study of these Antinous images was particularly important because of his &quot;rare mix&quot; of &quot;biographical mystery and overwhelming physical presence&quot;.

Lambert believed that the sculptures of Antinous &quot;remain without doubt one of the most elevated and ideal monuments to pederastic love of the whole ancient world&quot;, also describing them as &quot;the final great creation of classical art&quot;.

There are also statues in many archaeological museums in Greece including the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, the archaeological museums of Patras, Chalkis and Delphi. Although these may well be idealised images, they demonstrate what all contemporary writers described as Antinous&#x27;s extraordinary beauty. Although many of the sculptures are instantly recognizable, some offer significant variation in terms of the suppleness and sensuality of the pose and features versus the rigidity and typical masculinity. In 1998, monumental remains were discovered at Hadrian&#x27;s Villa that archaeologists claimed were from the tomb of Antinous, or a temple to him, though this has been challenged both because of the inconclusive nature of the archaeological remains and the overlooking of patristic sources (Epiphanius, Clement of Alexandria) indicating that Antinous was buried at his temple in Antinoöpolis, the Egyptian city founded in his honour.

===Age===
The common image of Antinous is of an ephebic teenager which would be of the age of 18 or 19 years old. R. R. R. Smith suggests that the statues of Antinous are concerned with depicting the real age of Antinous at the age of his death, and that this is more likely to be &quot;around thirteen to fourteen&quot;. An &quot;ephebe&quot; of eighteen or nineteen would be depicted with full pubic hair, whereas the statues of Antinous depict him as prepubescent &quot;without pubic hair and with carefully represented soft groin tissue&quot;. As for the statues of Antinous portraying his real age, one must remember the statues are artistic representations. If the statues look young, it may only be how the artist envisioned him. Most of the artists never saw Antinous and based their works on sketches and examples. If the statues have no pubic hair, it is just as likely that the artist thought clumps of hair were unattractive and either left them off or painted them in lightly after the sculpting was done as almost all Roman statues were painted.

== Cultural references ==

Antinous remained a figure of cultural significance for centuries to come; as Vout noted, he was &quot;arguably the most notorious pretty boy from the annals of classical history.&quot; Sculptures of Antinous began to be reproduced from the 16th century; it remains likely that some of these modern examples have subsequently been sold as Classical artefacts and are still viewed as such.

Antinous has attracted attention from the homosexual subculture since the 18th century, the most illustrious examples for this being Prince Eugene of Savoy and Frederick the Great of Prussia. Vout noted that Antinous came to be identified as &quot;a gay icon.&quot; Novelist and independent scholar Sarah Waters identified Antinous as being &quot;at the forefront of the homosexual imagination&quot; in late 19th-century Europe. In this, Antinous replaced the figure of Ganymede, who had been the primary homoerotic representation in the visual arts during the Renaissance. Gay author Karl Heinrich Ulrichs celebrated Antinous in an 1865 pamphlet that he wrote under the pseudonym of &quot;Numa Numantius.&quot; In 1893, homophile newspaper &quot;The Artist&quot;, began offering cast statues of Antinous for £3 10s. At the time, Antinous&#x27;s fame was increased by the work of fiction and writers and scholars, many of whom were not homosexuals.

The author Oscar Wilde referenced Antinous in both &quot;The Young King&quot; (1891) and &quot;The Sphinx&quot; (1894). In &quot;The Young King&quot;, a reference is made to the king kissing a statue of &#x27;the Bithynian slave of Hadrian&#x27; in a passage describing the young king&#x27;s aesthetic sensibilities and his &quot;...strange passion for beauty...&quot;. Images of other classical paragons of male beauty, Adonis and Endymion, are also mentioned in the same context. Additionally, in Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, the artist Basil Hallward describes the appearance of Dorian Gray as an event as important to his art as &quot;the face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture.&quot; Furthermore, in a novel attributed to Oscar Wilde, &quot;Teleny, or The Reverse of the Medal&quot;, Des Grieux makes a passing reference to Antinous as he describes how he felt during a musical performance: &quot;I now began to understand things hitherto so strange, the love the mighty monarch felt for his fair Grecian slave, Antinous, who – like unto Christ – died for his master&#x27;s sake.&quot;

In &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, the character Enjolras is likened to Antinous. &quot;A charming young man who was capable of being a terror. He was angelically good-looking, an untamed Antinous.&quot; Hugo also remarks that Enjolras was &quot;seeming not to be aware of the existence on earth of a creature called woman.&quot;

In &quot;Klage um Antinous&quot;, &quot;Der neuen Gedichte anderer Teil&quot; (1908) by Rainer Maria Rilke, Hadrian scolds the gods for Antinous&#x27;s deification. &quot;Lament for Antinoüs&quot;, translation by Stephen Cohn.

In 1915 Fernando Pessoa wrote a long poem entitled &quot;Antinous&quot;, but he only published it in 1918, close to the end of World War I, in a slim volume of English verse.

In Marguerite Yourcenar&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;Hadrien&quot; (1951), the romantic relationship between Antinous and Hadrian is one of the main themes of the book.

In Aldous Huxley&#x27;s utopian novel &quot;Island&quot; (1963), the youthful character Murugan is likened to Antinous because of his relationship with dictatorial leader, Colonel Dipa. While on a trip to Rendang to pick up his mother, Murugan also secretly saw Dipa but did not want the island people of Pala to know because &quot;they think he&#x27;s awful.&quot; After Murugan called Dipa a &quot;remarkable man,&quot; Huxley wrote that &quot;Murugan&#x27;s sulky face lit up with enthusiasm and there, suddenly, was Antinous in all the fascinating beauty of ambiguous adolescence,&quot; and later, &quot;Will felt quite sure, he hadn&#x27;t been mistaken when he thought of Hadrian and Antinous&quot; while speaking to Murugan.

The story of Antinous&#x27; death was dramatized in the radio play &quot;The Glass Ball Game&quot;, Episode Two of the second series of the BBC radio drama &quot;Caesar!&quot;, written by Mike Walker, directed by Jeremy Mortimer and starring Jonathan Coy as &quot;Suetonius&quot;, Jonathan Hyde as &quot;Hadrian&quot; and Andrew Garfield as &quot;Antinous.&quot; In this story, Suetonius is a witness to the events before and after Antinous&#x27;s death by suicide, but learns that he himself was used as an instrument to trick Antinous into killing himself willingly to fulfil a pact made by Hadrian with Egyptian priests to give Hadrian more time to live so that Marcus Aurelius may grow up to become the next Emperor.

On 13 October 2018, in Toronto, the Canadian Opera Company premiered &quot;Hadrian&quot;, the second opera by Rufus Wainwright, which tells the tale of the Emperor&#x27;s grief and his all-consuming need to discover the details surrounding Antinous&#x27;s death.

In June 2023, Hadrian and Antinous were the subject of the podcast &quot;The Rest is History&quot; by Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook.

==Historiography==
The classicist Caroline Vout noted that most of the texts dealing with Antinous&#x27;s biography only dealt with him briefly and were post-Hadrianic in date, thus commenting that &quot;reconstructing a detailed biography is impossible.&quot; The historian Thorsten Opper of the British Museum noted that &quot;Hardly anything is known of Antinous&#x27;s life, and the fact that our sources get more detailed the later they are does not inspire confidence.&quot; Antinous&#x27;s biographer Royston Lambert echoed this view, commenting that information on him was &quot;tainted always by distance, sometimes by prejudice and by the alarming and bizarre ways in which the principal sources have been transmitted to us.&quot;

<text>Aeëtes ( ; , ), or Aeeta, was the ruler of the eponymous realm of Aea in Greek mythology, a wondrous realm which from the fifth century B.C.E. onward became identified with the kingdom of Colchis east in the Black Sea. The name comes from the ancient Greek word (, &quot;eagle&quot;).

== Family ==
Aeëtes was the son of Sun god Helios and the Oceanid Perseis, brother of Circe, Perses and Pasiphaë, and father of Medea, Chalciope and Absyrtus. His consort was either (1) Idyia, the youngest daughter of Oceanus, (2) Asterodeia, a Caucasian Oceanid, (3) the Nereid Neaera, (4) Clytia, (5) Ipsia or Eurylyte.

According to others, he was the brother of Perses, a king of Tauris, husband of his niece Hecate, and father of Medea, Chalciope and Absyrtus. Yet other versions make Aeëtes a native of Corinth and son of Ephyra, an Oceanid, or else of a certain Antiope. Asterope was also one of the possible mothers of Aeëtes. (For a comparative table of Aeëtes&#x27; family, see below).

== Mythology ==
=== Foundation of Colchis ===
Pausanias states that, according to the poet Eumelos, Aeëtes was the son of Helios (from northern Peloponnesus) and brother of Aloeus. Helios divided the land he ruled, and he gave Aloeus the part in Asopia (see Asopus) and Aeëtes the part of Ephyra (Corinth). Later, Aeëtes gave his kingdom to Bounos, a son of Hermes and Alkidameia, and went to Colchis, a country in western Caucasus. When Bounos died, Epopeus, a son of Aloeus who ruled in Asopia, became king of Ephyra too. Aeëtes built a new colony in Colchis, near the mouth of the large river Phasis, and called it Aea.

=== Flight of two siblings ===
Phrixus, son of Athamas and Nephele, along with his twin, Helle, were hated by their stepmother, Ino. Ino hatched a devious plot to get rid of the twins, roasting all the town&#x27;s crop seeds so they would not grow. The local farmers, frightened of famine, asked a nearby oracle for assistance. Ino bribed the men sent to the oracle to lie and tell the others that the oracle required the sacrifice of Phrixus but before they were able to kill him, Phrixus and Helle were rescued by a golden ram sent by Nephele, their natural mother. Helle fell off the ram into the Hellespont (which was named after her) and died, but Phrixus survived all the way to Colchis, where Aeëtes took him in and treated him kindly, giving Phrixus his daughter Chalciope in marriage. In gratitude, Phrixus gave the king the golden fleece of the ram, which Aeëtes hung on a tree in his kingdom. Aeëtes dedicated the golden fleece to Ares. Phrixus thus lived at the court of Aeëtes for a long time but one day Aeëtes learned from an oracle that he would die at the hands of a descendant of Aeolus and so he killed Phryxus. His sons, on the other hand, managed to return to Orchomenus.

===The Argonauts===
Some time later, Jason arrived to claim the fleece as his own. Aeëtes promised to give it to him only if he could perform certain tasks. First, Jason had to plow a field with fire-breathing oxen that he had to yoke himself. Then, Jason sowed into a field the teeth of a dragon which the Colchian king received from Athena, half of it was sowed before by Cadmus in Thebes. These teeth sprouted into an army of warriors. Jason was quick-thinking, however, and before they attacked him, he threw a rock into the crowd. Unable to determine whence the rock had come, the soldiers killed each other. Jason then ran away. Medea fled, too. Aeëtes pursued them in his own ship as they fled, but Medea distracted her father by killing and dismembering her brother, Absyrtus, and throwing pieces of his cadaver overboard. Aeëtes paused to gather the pieces of his son, and thus Jason and Medea escaped.

== Historicity ==
The mythical Aeetes may have reflected a memory of a historical personage. His name recurs in historical narratives of Classical authors who claim the enduring legacy of Aeëtes in Colchis. Arrian, touring the region in the 2nd century, reports seeing sites and ruins from Aeetes&#x27; time. The 5th-century author Zosimus mentions &quot;a palace of Aeetes&quot; standing at the mouth of the Phasis. Local rulers are claimed to have descended from Aeëtes, such as a king of the Phasians from Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot; and Saulaces, a gold-rich king of Colchis, from Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;. Strabo, who treated Aeetes as a historical person, writes that this was &quot;a local name among the Colchians&quot;. The name of Aeëtes was borne by a historical Colchian, a 6th-century nobleman in Lazica in the times of Lazic War known from Agathias&#x27;s account. If naming Aeëtes as the ancestor of the Colchian rulers was not the invention of the classical authors, it is possible that the Colchian rulers regarded themselves as descendants of Aeetes.

<doc id="77419" wikidata="Q743482" url="?curid=77419" title="Phrixus">
<text>In Greek mythology Phrixus (; also spelt Phryxus; means &quot;standing on end, bristling&quot;) was the son of Athamas, king of Boeotia, and Nephele (a goddess of clouds). He was the older brother of Helle and the father of Argus, Phrontis, Melas and Cytisorus by Chalciope (Iophassa), daughter of Aeetes, king of Colchis.

== Mythology ==
Phrixus and Helle were hated by their stepmother, Ino. She hatched a devious plot to get rid of the children, roasting all of Boeotia&#x27;s crop seeds so they would not grow. The local farmers, frightened of famine, asked a nearby oracle for assistance. Ino bribed the men sent to the oracle to lie and tell the others that the oracle required the sacrifice of Phrixus and Helle. Before they were killed, though, Phrixus and Helle were rescued by a flying, or swimming, ram with golden wool sent by Nephele, their natural mother; their starting point is variously recorded as Halos in Thessaly and Orchomenus in Boeotia. During their flight Helle, for unknown reasons, fell off the ram and drowned in the strait between Europe and Asia, which was named after her the Hellespont, meaning the sea of Helle (now the Dardanelles); Phrixus survived all the way to Colchis, where King Aeëtes, the son of the sun god Helios, took him in and treated him kindly, giving Phrixus his daughter, Chalciope, in marriage. In gratitude, Phrixus sacrificed the ram to Poseidon and gave the king the Golden Fleece of the ram, which Aeëtes hung in a tree in the holy grove of Ares in his kingdom, guarded by a dragon that never slept. Phrixus and Chalciope had four sons, who later joined forces with the Argonauts. The oldest was Argos/Argus, the others were Phrontis, Melas, and Cytisorus.
Phrixus thus lived at the court of Aeëtes but one day Aeëtes learned from an oracle that he would die at the hands of a descendant of Aeolus (the paternal grandfather of Phrixus) and so he killed Phrixus. However, other sources claim that Phrixus lived peacefully at Colchis and died of old age.

<doc id="77420" wikidata="Q1364648" url="?curid=77420" title="Oklahoma!">
<text>Oklahoma! is the first musical written by the duo of Rodgers and Hammerstein. The musical is based on Lynn Riggs&#x27;s 1931 play, &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot;. Set in farm country outside the town of Claremore, Indian Territory, in 1906, it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams and her courtship by two rival suitors, cowboy Curly McLain and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry. A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fiancée, Ado Annie.

The original Broadway production opened on March 31, 1943. It was a box office hit and ran for an unprecedented 2,212 performances, later enjoying award-winning revivals, national tours, foreign productions and an Oscar-winning 1955 film adaptation. It has long been a popular choice for school and community productions. Rodgers and Hammerstein won a special Pulitzer Prize for &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in 1944.

This musical, building on the innovations of the earlier &quot;Show Boat&quot;, epitomized the development of the &quot;book musical&quot;, a musical play in which the songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story, with serious dramatic goals, that is able to evoke genuine emotions other than amusement. In addition, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; features musical themes, or motifs, that recur throughout the work to connect the music and story. A fifteen-minute &quot;dream ballet&quot; reflects Laurey&#x27;s struggle with her feelings about two men, Curly and Jud.
==Background==
By the early 1940s, Rodgers and Hammerstein were each well known for creating Broadway hits with other collaborators. Rodgers, with Lorenz Hart, had produced over two dozen musicals since the 1920s, including such popular successes as &quot;Babes in Arms&quot; (1937), &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot; (1938) and &quot;Pal Joey&quot; (1940). Among other successes, Hammerstein had written the words for &quot;Rose-Marie&quot; (1924), &quot;The Desert Song&quot; (1926), &quot;The New Moon&quot; (1927) and &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1927). Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote musicals, songs and films, sharing an Academy Award for his song with Jerome Kern, &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot;, which was included in the 1941 film &quot;Lady Be Good&quot;. By the early 1940s, Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional turmoil, and he became unreliable, prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him.

===Conception===
In 1931, the Theatre Guild produced Lynn Riggs&#x27;s &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot;, a play about settlers in Oklahoma Indian Territory. Though the play was not successful, ten years later in 1941, Theresa Helburn, one of the Guild&#x27;s producers, saw a summer-stock production supplemented with traditional folk songs and square dances and decided the play could be the basis of a musical that might revive the struggling Guild. She contacted Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, whose first successful collaboration, &quot;The Garrick Gaieties&quot;, had been produced by the Theatre Guild in 1925. Rodgers wanted to work on the project and obtained the rights for himself and Hart. Rodgers had asked Oscar Hammerstein II to collaborate with him and Hart. During the tryouts of Rodgers and Hart&#x27;s &quot;By Jupiter&quot; in 1941, Hammerstein had assured Rodgers that if Hart was ever unable to work, he would be willing to take his place. Coincidentally in 1942, Hammerstein had thought of musicalizing &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot;, but when he had approached Jerome Kern about it, the latter declined. Hammerstein learned that Rodgers was seeking someone to write the book, and he eagerly took the opportunity. Hart lost interest in the musical; he preferred contemporary, urbane shows that would showcase his witty lyric writing, and he found the farmers and cowhands in &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot; corny and uninspiring. Moreover, spiraling downward, consumed by his longstanding alcoholism, Hart no longer felt like writing. He embarked on a vacation to Mexico, advising Rodgers that Hammerstein would be a good choice of a new collaborator.

This partnership allowed both Rodgers and Hammerstein to follow their preferred writing methods: Hammerstein preferred to write a complete lyric before it was set to music, and Rodgers preferred to set completed lyrics to music. In Rodgers&#x27; previous collaborations with Hart, Rodgers had always written the music first, since the unfocused Hart needed something on which to base his lyrics. Hammerstein&#x27;s previous collaborators included composers Rudolf Friml, Herbert Stothart, Vincent Youmans, and Kern, who all wrote music first, for which Hammerstein then wrote lyrics. The role reversal in the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership permitted Hammerstein to craft the lyrics into a fundamental part of the story so that the songs could amplify and intensify the story instead of diverting it. As Rodgers and Hammerstein began developing the new musical, they agreed that their musical and dramatic choices would be dictated by the source material, &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot;, not by musical comedy conventions. Musicals of that era featured big production numbers, novelty acts, and show-stopping specialty dances; the libretti typically focused on humor, with little dramatic development, punctuated with songs that effectively halted the story for their duration.

===Casting and development===
Between the world wars, roles in musicals were usually filled by actors who could sing, but Rodgers and Hammerstein chose, conversely, to cast singers who could act. Though Theresa Helburn, codirector of the Theatre Guild, suggested Shirley Temple as Laurey and Groucho Marx as Ali Hakim, Rodgers and Hammerstein, with director Rouben Mamoulian&#x27;s support, insisted that performers more dramatically appropriate for the roles be cast. As a result, there were no stars in the production, another unusual step. The production was choreographed by Agnes de Mille (her first time choreographing a musical on Broadway), who provided one of the show&#x27;s most notable and enduring features: a 15-minute first-act ballet finale (often referred to as the dream ballet) depicting Laurey&#x27;s struggle to evaluate her suitors, Jud and Curly.

The first title given to the work was &quot;Away We Go!&quot; which opened for out-of-town-tryouts in New Haven&#x27;s Shubert Theatre on March 11, 1943. Expectations for the show were low; Hammerstein had written six flops in a row, and the show had no star power. Producer Mike Todd walked out after the first act during the tryout and wisecracked, &quot;No girls, no gags, no chance.&quot; But Rodgers and Hammerstein were confident. The New Haven and Boston audiences were enthusiastic, although the reviews were only fair. Of the changes made before the show went to Broadway, two would prove significant: the dramatic restaging of the show-stopping musical number, &quot;Oklahoma&quot; and the decision to retitle the musical after that number.

Todd had been wrong; the show opened on Broadway to raves from the critics, sold out, and won a special Pulitzer Prize. Brooks Atkinson wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the show&#x27;s opening number, &quot;Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin&#x27;&quot; changed the history of musical theater: &quot;After a verse like that, sung to a buoyant melody, the banalities of the old musical stage became intolerable.&quot; The &quot;New York Post&quot; was the only major paper to give &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; a mixed review. Its critic felt that while the songs were pleasant enough, they sounded much alike. The show&#x27;s creativity stimulated Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s contemporaries and ushered in the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of American musical theatre.

==Plot==
=== Act I ===
In Oklahoma Territory, in 1906, cowboy Curly McLain looks forward to a beautiful day as he visits farm girl Laurey Williams&#x27;s yard (&quot;Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin&#x27;&quot;). He and Laurey tease each other, while her Aunt Eller looks on. There will be a box social dance that night, which includes an auction of lunch baskets prepared by the local women to raise funds for a schoolhouse. Each man who wins a basket will eat lunch with the lady who prepared it. Curly asks Laurey to go with him, but she refuses, feeling that he has waited too long. To persuade her, he says he will take her in the finest carriage money can buy (&quot;The Surrey with the Fringe on Top&quot;), but she teases him about it until he says he made it up to get back at her. She flounces off, not realizing that he really has rented such a surrey.

The lonely, disturbed farmhand Jud Fry has become obsessed with Laurey and asks her to the dance. She accepts to spite Curly, although she is afraid of Jud. Meanwhile, cowboy Will Parker returns from a trip to modern Kansas City, and shows off his souvenirs (&quot;Kansas City&quot;). He won $50 ($ today) at the fair, which, according to his girlfriend Ado Annie&#x27;s father, Andrew Carnes, is the amount he needs to marry Ado Annie. Unfortunately, he spent all the money on gifts for her and one for her father: a Little Wonder (a metal tube used for looking at pictures, but with a hidden blade inside). He is unaware of its deadly secret. Later, Ado Annie confesses to Laurey that while Will was away, she has spent a lot of time with Ali Hakim, a Persian peddler. Laurey says she&#x27;ll have to choose between them, but Ado Annie insists she loves them both (&quot;I Cain&#x27;t Say No&quot;). Laurey and her friends prepare for the social, while Gertie Cummings flirts with Curly. Laurey notices and tells her friends that she doesn&#x27;t really care about Curly (&quot;Many a New Day&quot;).

Andrew Carnes sees Annie with Ali Hakim; he forces Hakim at gunpoint to agree to marry her. Hakim and the other men lament the unfairness of the situation (&quot;It&#x27;s a Scandal! It&#x27;s a Outrage!&quot;). Curly discovers that Laurey is going to the box social with Jud and tries to convince her to go with him instead. Afraid to tell Jud she won&#x27;t go with him, Laurey protests that she does not love Curly (&quot;People Will Say We&#x27;re in Love&quot;). Hurt by her refusal, Curly goes to the smokehouse where Jud lives to talk with him. Curly jokingly suggests that since Jud does not feel appreciated, he could hang himself, and everyone would realize how much they care about him (&quot;Pore Jud Is Daid&quot;). Their talk turns into an ominous confrontation about Laurey. After Curly leaves, Jud&#x27;s resolve to win Laurey becomes even stronger, and he vows to make her his bride (&quot;Lonely Room&quot;).

Confused by her feelings for Curly and her fear of Jud, Laurey purchases a &quot;magic potion&quot; (laudanum) from Ali Hakim, which the unscrupulous peddler guarantees will reveal her true love. She muses on leaving her dreams of love behind and joining the man she loves (&quot;Out of My Dreams&quot;). Soon asleep under the influence of the opiate, in an extended ballet sequence, Laurey first dreams of marriage with Curly. Her dream takes a nightmarish turn when Jud appears and kills Curly; she cannot escape him, confused by her desires (&quot;Dream Ballet&quot;). Awakening, she realizes that Curly is the right man for her, but it is too late to change her mind about going to the dance with Jud, who arrives, and they leave for the box social.

===Act II===
At the social, during a square dance (&quot;The Farmer and the Cowman&quot;), the rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys over fences and water rights leads to fighting, which Aunt Eller ends by firing a gun to silence everyone. Laurey is upset when she sees Curly at the dance with Gertie. To rid himself of Ado Annie, Ali Hakim buys Will&#x27;s souvenirs from Kansas City for $50. Jud also contributes to this by purchasing Will&#x27;s Little Wonder, knowing of the blade concealed within it. The auction starts and Will bids $50 on Ado Annie&#x27;s basket, not realizing that without the $50, he would not have the money to pay her father. Desperate to be rid of Ado Annie, the peddler bids $51 to get the basket so that Will can approach Andrew Carnes with the $50 and claim Ado Annie as his bride. The auction becomes much more serious when Laurey&#x27;s basket comes up for auction. Jud has saved all his money so he can win Laurey&#x27;s basket. Various men bid, trying to protect Laurey, but Jud outbids them all. Curly and Jud engage in a ferocious bidding war, and Curly sells his saddle, his horse, and even his gun to raise money. Curly outbids Jud and wins the basket. Jud discreetly tries to kill Curly with the Little Wonder, but his plan is foiled when Aunt Eller (knowing what is happening) loudly asks Curly for a dance. Later that night, Will and Annie work out their differences, as she reluctantly agrees not to flirt with other men (&quot;All Er Nuthin&#x27;&quot;).

Jud confronts Laurey about his feelings for her. When she admits that she does not return them, he threatens her. She then fires him as her farmhand, demanding that he get off her property. Jud furiously threatens Laurey before he departs; she bursts into tears and calls for Curly. She tells him that she has fired Jud and is frightened by what Jud might do now. Curly reassures her and proposes to her, and she accepts (&quot;People Will Say We&#x27;re In Love&quot; (reprise)). He realizes that he must now become a farmer. Ali Hakim decides to leave the territory and bids Ado Annie goodbye, telling her Will is the man she should marry.

Three weeks later, Laurey and Curly are married as everyone celebrates the territory&#x27;s impending statehood (&quot;Oklahoma&quot;). Ali Hakim returns with Gertie, whom he has recently married after being threatened by her father with a shotgun. A drunken Jud reappears, kisses Laurey and punches Curly, and they begin a fistfight. Jud attacks Curly with a knife, and Curly dodges, causing Jud to fall on his own knife. Jud soon dies. The wedding guests hold a makeshift trial for Curly, at Aunt Eller&#x27;s urging. The judge, Andrew Carnes, declares the verdict: &quot;not guilty!&quot; Curly and Laurey depart on their honeymoon in the surrey with the fringe on top (&quot;Finale Ultimo&quot;).

==Production history==
===Original Broadway===
The original Broadway production opened on March 31, 1943, at the St. James Theatre in New York City. It was directed by Rouben Mamoulian, choreographed by Agnes de Mille and starred Alfred Drake (Curly), Joan Roberts (Laurey), Celeste Holm (Ado Annie), Howard da Silva (Jud Fry), Betty Garde (Aunt Eller), Lee Dixon (Will Parker), Joseph Buloff (Ali Hakim), Jane Lawrence (Gertie), Barry Kelley (Ike) and George S. Irving (Joe). Marc Platt danced the role of &quot;Dream Curly&quot;, Katharine Sergava danced the part of &quot;Dream Laurey&quot; and the small dancing part of Aggie was played by Bambi Linn. George Church danced the part of &quot;Dream Jud&quot;. Church was replaced by Vladimir Kostenko two months after the premiere. The production&#x27;s scenic designer was Lemuel Ayers.

The production ran for 2,212 performances, finally closing on May 29, 1948. &quot;The demand for tickets was unprecedented as the show became more popular in the months that followed&quot; the opening. &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; ran for over five years, a Broadway record that &quot;would not be bested until &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1956).&quot; The Tony Awards and other awards now given for achievement in musical theatre were not in existence in 1943, and therefore the original production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; received no theatrical awards.

===Early U.S. tours===
The first of several national tours began in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1944. A 1953 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the show was &quot;believed to be the only musical to have enjoyed a consecutive run of ten years. It ran on Broadway for five years and two months, grossing $7,000,000. The tour of the national company, which started late in 1943, has grossed $15,000,000.&quot; These tours reached 250 cities. John Raitt played Curly in the original production in Chicago. The United Service Organizations sponsored a tour to U.S. military bases in 1945 that lasted for several years. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 1953:

===Original West End===
&quot;Oklahoma!&quot; was the first of a post-war wave of Broadway musicals to reach London&#x27;s West End. It starred Howard Keel (then known as Harold Keel) and Betty Jane Watson, opening at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on April 30, 1947, to rave press reviews and sellout houses, running for 1,543 performances. A pre-London run opened a day late at the Manchester Opera House on April 18, 1947, after the ship carrying the cast, scenery, and costumes ran aground on a sandbank off Southampton.

=== Original Australian ===
An Australian production opened at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Melbourne, on February 19, 1949. Gemze de Lappe choreographed and played Dream Laurey. It transferred to the Theatre Royal, Adelaide, on September 17, 1949, the Theatre Royal, Sydney, on November 29, 1949, and His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Brisbane, on November 29, 1950.

===1951 and 1979 Broadway revivals===
A 1951 revival produced by the Theatre Guild opened at The Broadway Theatre on May 9, 1951, and ran for 100 performances. Ridge Bond played Curly, Patricia Northrop played Laurey, Henry Clarke was Jud, and Jacqueline Sundt played Ado Annie. Mamoulian and de Mille returned to direct and choreograph, and the production was restaged by Jerome Whyte. In 1953, a 10th anniversary revival opened on August 31 at the New York City Center Theatre. It ran for a limited engagement of 40 performances before going on tour. The cast included Florence Henderson as Laurey, Ridge Bond as Curly and Barbara Cook as Annie. Mamoulian and De Mille directed and choreographed.

A 1979 revival opened at the Palace Theatre on Broadway on December 13, 1979, and closed on August 24, 1980, running for 293 performances and nine previews. William Hammerstein (Oscar&#x27;s son) directed, and Gemze de Lappe recreated Agnes De Mille&#x27;s choreography. The show starred Christine Andreas as Laurey, Laurence Guittard as Curly, Mary Wickes as Aunt Eller, Christine Ebersole as Ado Annie, Martin Vidnovic as Jud Fry, Harry Groener as Will Parker and Bruce Adler as Ali Hakim. Andreas and Groener both received Tony Award nominations for their performances, and Vidnovic won a Drama Desk Award. This production started as a cross-country national tour, beginning at the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles on May 1, 1979.

===1980 West End revival===
The following year, James Hammerstein directed a production at the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester, in January 1980, produced by Cameron Mackintosh and Emile Litler. The De Mille choreography was again adapted by de Lappe. A UK tour followed, and it eventually settled in the West End, opening at the Palace Theatre, London, on September 17, 1980, and running until September 19, 1981. This production starred John Diedrich as Curly and Alfred Molina as Jud Fry, both of whom were nominated for Olivier Awards. Rosamund Shelley played Laurey, Madge Ryan was Aunt Eller and Linal Haft was Ali Hakim. The production was Maria Friedman&#x27;s debut in the West End, initially in the chorus role of Doris, but she was eventually promoted to the leading role. Sets and costumes were designed by Tim Goodchild. Ray Cook was Musical Director and John Owen Edwards Conductor (Owen Edwards became Musical Director for Mackintosh&#x27;s 1998 London revival). A cast recording of this production was issued by JAY Records and on the &quot;Showtime!&quot; label.

=== 1982 Australian revival ===
John Diedrich reprised his role as Curly for the national 1982–1983 tour of his native Australia. Again presented by Cameron Mackintosh, the tour was produced by the Adelaide Festival Centre Trust, Edgley International and The MLC Theatre Royal Company. It opened at the Adelaide Festival Theatre on April 30, 1982, transferred to the Theatre Royal, Sydney on June 5, 1982, then to Her Majestys Theatre, Melbourne on November 8, 1982, and concluded at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Brisbane in April 1983. The cast included Henri Szeps as Ali Hakin and Neil Melville as Cord Elan. Direction was again by William Hammerstein, the De Mille choreography again adapted by de Lappe, with sets and costumes again by Tim Goodchild. This was the musical theatre debut for Caroline O&#x27;Connor as an ensemble player and swing/understudy.

=== 1998 West End revival ===

A dark-themed production of the musical was presented by the National Theatre in London at the Olivier Theatre, opening on July 15, 1998. The production team included Trevor Nunn (director), Susan Stroman (choreographer) and William David Brohn (orchestrator). The international cast included Hugh Jackman as Curly, Maureen Lipman as Aunt Eller, Josefina Gabrielle as Laurey, Shuler Hensley as Jud Fry, Vicki Simon as Ado Annie, Peter Polycarpou as Ali Hakim and Jimmy Johnston as Will Parker. Musical director John Owen Edwards, Brohn and dance arranger David Krane adapted Robert Russell Bennett&#x27;s original orchestrations and extended some of the dance sequences. A new Dream Ballet was composed for Susan Stroman&#x27;s new choreography, and the dances to &quot;Kansas City&quot;, &quot;Many a New Day&quot; and &quot;The Farmer and the Cowman&quot; were all redesigned. The overture was also altered, at the request of Nunn. Jackman and Gabrielle performed the ballet themselves.

The production received nine Olivier Award nominations, winning for Outstanding Musical Production, supporting actor (Hensley), set design (Anthony Ward) and choreography (Stroman). According to the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Organization, the limited engagement was a sell-out and broke all previous box office records, and so the show was transferred to the Lyceum Theatre in the West End for a six-month run. Plans to transfer to Broadway with the London cast were thwarted by Actors&#x27; Equity, which insisted that American actors must be cast. Eventually a U.S. cast was selected. The production was filmed live and issued on DVD, as well as being broadcast on U.S. Public Television in November 2003. The live recording was given a limited theatrical re-release on July 16 and 19, 2023, celebrating its 25th anniversary and the musical&#x27;s 80th anniversary.

===2002 Broadway revival===
The London production was repeated on Broadway at the Gershwin Theatre on March 21, 2002, with direction by Nunn. The production closed on February 23, 2003, after 388 performances. Only two of the London cast, Josefina Gabrielle as Laurey and Shuler Hensley as Jud, were in the production, which also featured Patrick Wilson as Curly, Andrea Martin as Aunt Eller and Justin Bohon as Will. It was nominated for seven Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical, Best Featured Actress in a Musical and Best Featured Actor in a Musical (which was awarded to Hensley). The musical was also nominated for nine Drama Desk Awards, with Hensley winning as Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical and Susan Stroman winning for choreography.

Ben Brantley wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;At its best, which is usually when it&#x27;s dancing, this resurrection of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s epochal show is dewy with an adolescent lustiness, both carnal and naive, exuberant and confused.&quot; The review stated that &quot;Anthony Ward&#x27;s harmoniously curved set, in which the sky seems to stretch into eternity, again pulses with the promise of a land on the verge of transformation.&quot; The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; review commented that &quot;Visually, this one is stunning – at times, Anthony Ward&#x27;s sets have a pastoral, idyllic quality, like Thomas Hart Benton&#x27;s paintings. At other times, especially in lighting designer David Hersey&#x27;s lustrous palette, they convey the bleakness of the frontier.&quot; The review also stated that the Royal National Theatre &quot;brought it back to us in a way that makes it seem fresh and vital.&quot; However, &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the production a tepid assessment, its reviewer writing: &quot;A cold breeze blows through this beautiful mornin&#x27;, and that golden haze is never quite bright enough.&quot; The production went on to tour nationally from 2003 to 2005.

===2019 Broadway revival; 2022 London transfer===
Following a 2015 workshop at Bard College and a 2018 run at Brooklyn&#x27;s St. Ann&#x27;s Warehouse, a 75th anniversary staging of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; transferred to Broadway at Circle in the Square Theatre. The production was directed by Daniel Fish in an intimate, immersive in-the-round style, set in a community hall, with chili and cornbread served to the audience at intermission. The production&#x27;s most important tonal change involved the character of Jud Fry. Instead of the sinister brooding and threatening Jud of the original production, in the revival he is depicted in a positive, sympathetic light, and his death came, not as an accident, but as an intended act at the hands of Curly, followed by a sham trial to clear Curly of the blame.

The production began preview performances on March 19, 2019, and officially opened on April 7 for a limited run through January 19, 2020. It starred Rebecca Naomi Jones as Laurey, Damon Daunno as Curly, Ali Stroker as Ado Annie, James Davis as Will Parker, Will Brill as Ali Hakim, Patrick Vaill as Jud and Mary Testa as Aunt Eller. The production featured choreography by John Heginbotham and music arrangements by Daniel Kluger, performed by a seven-piece band. The production was nominated for eight Tony Awards and won Best Revival of a Musical and Best Featured Actress in a Musical for Stroker, making her the first wheelchair user to win a Tony.

For the 2021–2022 national tour, Fish rethought the presentation, which remained expressionistic but substituted a proscenium back-drop, which &quot;renders the original authorial intents far more in balance with the radical ideas of the production&quot;, allowing the cast to play their parts with a contemporary naturalism, according to &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Chris Jones. The cast included Sasha Hutchings as Laurey, Sean Grandillo as Curly and Barbara Walsh as Aunt Eller.

In May 2022, the production reopened at the Young Vic in London for a seven-week limited run, starring Arthur Darvill as Curly and Anoushka Lucas as Laurey, with Marisha Wallace as Ado Annie, Liza Sadovy as Aunt Eller, and James Davis and Patrick Vaill reprising their roles as Will Parker and Jud, respectively. The production transferred to the West End&#x27;s Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in February 2023. It received positive reviews and won the 2023 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival.

===Other notable productions===
====Discoveryland====
&quot;Oklahoma!&quot; was presented nightly except Sundays each summer at the Discoveryland amphitheater, an outdoor theatre in Sand Springs, Oklahoma, from 1977 until 2011. In 1993, Mary Rodgers (daughter of Richard Rodgers) and William Hammerstein (son of Oscar Hammerstein II) designated Discoveryland the &quot;National Home of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;

====2006 Japan====
In 2006, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; was performed in Japan by the all-female Takarazuka Revue. This revival starred Yuu Todoroki, Ai Shirosaki, and Hiromu Kiriya.

====2009 Chichester Theatre Festival====
In the summer of 2009, British director John Doyle directed the musical at the Chichester Festival Theatre. The production was dark in concept and featured new orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick. On a spare stage, decorated only with blue sheets, &quot;Confetti of rose petals stains the floor like drops of blood, and a nightmarish dream-dance sequence has Freudian overtones as Laurey&#x27;s bridal gown becomes her shroud.&quot; It received mixed reviews. &quot;The Times&quot; reviewer wrote: &quot;This is a very stylised, overdrilled production, no friend of intimate moments or quiet depth of emotion.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; liked it the most, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s a delight, with one brilliant tippy-tappy-toed song after another and a nugget of darkness lodged in its sweet heart.&quot; &quot;Whats On Stage&quot;, like most of the papers, gave the show three out of five stars and wrote that this is a &quot;downbeat vision&quot; and that &quot;all told it&#x27;s a somewhat disappointing show&quot;, but their &quot;average reader rating&quot; was four stars. A review in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; commented, &quot;Doyle uses shadow and silhouette to bring out the musical&#x27;s nightmarish aspects but doesn&#x27;t over-labour them. There are enough sunny spots – no more so than in Act 2&#x27;s rousing title song – to keep the tone evenly textured.&quot;

====2010 UK tour====
The show toured England for nine months in 2010 in a new staging by Julian Woolford, with Marti Webb as Aunt Eller and Mark Evans as Curly.

====2010 Washington, DC Arena Stage====
&quot;Oklahoma!&quot; opened in October 2010 at the Arena Stage to critical acclaim. Artistic Director Molly Smith cast African-American actresses as Laurey and Aunt Eller to mirror both modern Washington, D.C., demographics and the diverse population of the musical&#x27;s 1906 Oklahoma territory setting. The production received ten 2011 Helen Hayes Award nominations, winning as Outstanding Resident Musical (tying with Shakespeare Theatre&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;) and for choreography (Parker Esse), lead actor (Nicholas Rodriguez as Curly) and musical direction (George Fulginiti-Shakar). The production returned to the Arena Stage for a second run in 2011.

====2012, Seattle, Washington, 5th Avenue Theatre====
The 5th Avenue Theatre&#x27;s 2012 production, directed by Peter Rothstein, included African-American dancers and an African-American actor as Jud. The choice was intended, as in the Arena Stage production, to reflect the historical presence of African Americans in the Oklahoma territory, but it &quot;has some audience members squirming in their seats ... they&#x27;re seeing on stage one of the ugliest stereotypes in our history: an imposing black man ravaging a petite white woman [and] the white hero ... all but urges Jud to hang himself – and even pantomimes the act. Some see a clear reference to lynching.&quot; The &quot;Dream Ballet&quot; had a sinister, sexual tone and ended with Jud dragging Laurey away to be raped. One critic noted the historical &quot;license taken when an African-American farmhand is allowed to escort a white woman to the box dance. ... Maybe some people ... left with not so much a song in their head, but a question in their heart. And isn&#x27;t that part of what theater is supposed to do?&quot; Another wrote: &quot;Rothstein&#x27;s &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; is now the story of a crazy, sex obsessed black man ... lusting violently after his white mistress, who ends up murdered at the hands of a white man, who gets off scot free after a mock trial.&quot;

====2015 UK tour====
A UK tour ran from February to August 2015, directed by Rachel Kavanaugh and starring Ashley Day as Curly, Charlotte Wakefield as Laurey, Belinda Lang as Aunt Eller and Gary Wilmot as Ali Hakim.

===1955 film adaptation===

The 1955 film adaptation starred Gordon MacRae, Shirley Jones (in her film debut), Rod Steiger, Charlotte Greenwood, Gloria Grahame, Gene Nelson, James Whitmore and Eddie Albert. It was the only musical film directed by Fred Zinnemann, and Agnes de Mille choreographed. It was the first feature film photographed in the Todd-AO 70 mm widescreen process.

Rodgers and Hammerstein personally oversaw the film to prevent the studio from making the changes that were then typical of stage-to-film musical adaptations, such as interpolating new songs by others. The film followed the stage version more closely than any other Rodgers and Hammerstein stage-to-film adaptation, although it divided the long first scene into several shorter scenes, changing the locations of several of the songs. For example, &quot;Kansas City&quot; is performed at the train station, where Aunt Eller and other cowboys meet Will Parker just after he returns from Kansas City. Lyrics in the song about a burlesque stripteaser were slightly changed to pass film censorship. In a nod to &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot;, which was the basis of the musical, Jud attempts revenge on Curly and Laurey by burning a haystack they stand on, before Curly jumps down, landing on Jud and causing him to fall on his own knife. The film omits only &quot;It&#x27;s a Scandal, It&#x27;s a Outrage&quot; and &quot;Lonely Room&quot;. The film won Academy Awards for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture and Best Sound, Recording.
==Recordings==
Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra both recorded versions of &quot;People Will Say We’re In Love&quot; and &quot;Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin&#x27;&quot; in 1943. Due to the 1942–1944 musicians&#x27; strike, however, these recordings featured no instrumental accompaniment and instead &quot;were lugubriously weighed down by &quot;a cappella&quot; backup.&quot; Producers of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; lamented the lack of high-quality official recordings, with Theresa Helburn writing to a colleague in August 1943: &quot;There are no records of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; that we can send you. As you know, the Petrillo ban on the union musicians still holds. They cannot play for broadcasting so the only record that has been made is a singing of &quot;People Will Say We’re in Love&quot; with Frank Sinatra, which if it sounds anything like his radio singing of the same must be terrible.&quot; Decca Records president Jack Kapp settled with the union in September 1943, and three weeks later he hastily booked the original cast and orchestra of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; into a recording studio.

At a time when Broadway numbers were typically recorded by popular singers with smaller bands, it was unique for &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; to record its original cast with full orchestration. Although some tunes were not included due to time and cost constraints, most of the songs from &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; were released on a record album by Decca Records in 1943 containing six 10-inch double-sided discs in 78 RPM format. It sold more than one million copies, prompting the label to call the cast back into the studio to record three additional selections that had been left out of the first set. These were issued as &quot;Oklahoma! Volume Two&quot;. In 1949, Decca re-released the first set on LP but not the second set, which soon became a very rare collectors&#x27; item. All subsequent LP releases were similarly incomplete. Finally in 2000, Decca Broadway went back to the original glass masters to generate a new high fidelity transfer of the complete song program and released it on CD, utilizing the original 78 album artwork.

The success of the original &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; cast album set a precedent for the production of original cast recordings of Broadway musicals, which became an essential part of a musical&#x27;s dissemination and endurance in popular culture. Later cast recordings of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; include the 1979 Broadway cast recording, the 1980 London cast recording, the 1998 Royal National Theatre cast recording, the 2019 Broadway cast recording, and a soundtrack album of the 1955 film. There have also been more than 20 studio cast recordings of the show, featuring stars such as Nelson Eddy, John Raitt and Florence Henderson in the leading roles.

==Reception==
The original production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; was an unprecedented critical and popular success. John Anderson of the &quot;New York Journal American&quot; pronounced the musical &quot;a beautiful and delightful show, fresh and imaginative, as enchanting to the eye as Richard Rodgers&#x27;s music is to the ear. It has, at a rough estimate, practically everything&quot;. In the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, Howard Barnes wrote, &quot;Songs, dances, and a story have been triumphantly blended. ... The Richard Rodgers score is one of his best, and that is saying plenty. Oscar Hammerstein 2nd has written a dramatically imaginative libretto and a string of catchy lyrics; Agnes de Mille has worked small miracles in devising original dances to fit the story and the tunes, while Rouben Mamoulian has directed an excellent company with great taste and craftsmanship.&quot; Louis Kronenberger of &quot;PM&quot; opined that &quot;Mr. Hammerstein&#x27;s lyrics have less crispness and wit than Lorenz Hart&#x27;s at their best, but the songs in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; call for less sophisticated words, and Mr. Hammerstein has found very likeable ones.&quot;

In the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, Burns Mantle declared that &quot;&quot;Oklahoma!&quot; really is different – beautifully different. With the songs that Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; seems to me to be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since Edna Ferber&#x27;s &quot;Show Boat&quot;&quot;. &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; critic Burton Rascoe particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that &quot;Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet [corps], is actually the biggest hit of the show. The &quot;Out of My Dreams&quot; and &quot;All Er Nuthin&#x27;&quot; dances are such supreme aesthetic delights. ... They are spinetingling, out of this world.&quot; In &quot;The New York Sun&quot;, Ward Morehouse commented that &quot;&quot;Oklahoma!&quot; is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical,&quot; as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. &quot;It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night&#x27;s audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B.&quot; Lorenz Hart himself &quot;pushed his way through the crowd at the after-show party in Sardi&#x27;s restaurant and threw his arms around his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear. He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life.&quot;

The only negative review of the musical appeared in the &quot;New York Post&quot;: The critic wrote that &quot;it all seemed just a trifle too cute&quot;, stating that the score consisted of &quot;a flock of Mr. Rodgers&#x27;s songs that are pleasant enough, but still manage to sound quite a bit alike ... without much variety in the presentation.&quot; She concluded that the show was &quot;very picturesque in a studied fashion, reminding us that life on a farm is apt to become a little tiresome.&quot;

==Antecedents and influence==
According to playwright and theatre writer Thomas Hischak, &quot;Not only is &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; the most important of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, it is also the single most influential work in the American musical theatre. ... It is the first fully integrated musical play and its blending of song, character, plot and even dance would serve as the model for Broadway shows for decades.&quot; William Zinsser observed that &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; broke the old &quot;musical comedy conventions&quot;, with the songs &quot;delving into character&quot; and advancing the plot. The show &quot;became a milestone, so that later historians writing about important moments in twentieth-century theatre would begin to identify eras according to their relationship to &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;&quot; &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; made Rodgers and Hammerstein &quot;the most important contributors to the musical-play form. ... The examples they set in creating vital plays, often rich with social thought, provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own&quot;.

Theater historian Ethan Mordden points out that, although &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; has been called &quot;the first integrated musical, the first American folk musical&quot;, &quot;Show Boat&quot; &quot;got there first on both counts.&quot; Even earlier, the Princess Theatre musicals, following Gilbert and Sullivan and French &quot;opéra bouffe&quot;, began the reintegration of song and story after decades of thinly plotted British and American musicals, paving the way for &quot;Show Boat&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; by showing that a musical could combine popular entertainment with continuity between its story and songs. These Princess Theatre shows, which featured modern American settings, &quot;built and polished the mold from which almost all later major musical comedies evolved. ... The characters and situations were, within the limitations of musical comedy license, believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters. Kern&#x27;s exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization.&quot; Mordden also notes that &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; was called the first great dance musical, but other musicals had earlier focused on dance, among them &quot;Gay Divorce&quot; and &quot;On Your Toes&quot;. He concludes: &quot;But &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; was the first American musical with an ethnic sound, words and music entirely in the folk idiom.&quot;

Critic Andrea Most argues that the musical reflected its author&#x27;s and composer&#x27;s Jewish heritage and desires for Jewish Americans. Most asserts that the musical was written at a time when America presented Jews with an opportunity to gain privileged status by assimilating into mainstream American culture and passing as white Americans. Most claims that although there were rarely any identifiably Jewish characters in plays of this time period, characters such as Ali and Jud allowed for subtle Jewish representation, Ali embodying an accepted and friendly ideal for Jewish-Americans and Jud embodying Jewish-Americans&#x27; fear of becoming a marginalized minority like black Americans.

<doc id="77423" wikidata="Q297" url="?curid=77423" title="Diego Velázquez">
<text>Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez (baptized 6 June 15996 August 1660) was a Spanish painter, the leading artist in the court of King Philip IV of Spain and Portugal, and of the Spanish Golden Age. He is generally considered one of the greatest artists in the history of Western art.

He was an individualistic artist of the Baroque period (). He began to paint in a precise tenebrist style, later developing a freer manner characterized by bold brushwork. In addition to numerous renditions of scenes of historical and cultural significance, he painted scores of portraits of the Spanish royal family and commoners, culminating in his masterpiece (1656).

Velázquez&#x27;s paintings became a model for 19th century realist and impressionist painters. In the 20th century, artists such as Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí, and Francis Bacon paid tribute to Velázquez by re-interpreting some of his most iconic images.

Most of his work entered the Spanish royal collection, and by far the best collection is in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, although some portraits were sent abroad as diplomatic gifts, especially to the Austrian Habsburgs.

==Early life==

Velázquez was born in Seville, Spain, the first child of Juan Rodríguez de Silva, a notary, and Jerónima Velázquez. He was baptized at the church of St. Peter in Seville on Sunday, 6 June 1599. The baptism most probably occurred a few days or weeks after his birth. His paternal grandparents, Diego da Silva and María Rodríguez, were Portuguese and had moved to Seville decades earlier. When Velázquez was offered knighthood in 1658, he claimed descent from the lesser nobility in order to qualify, however, his grandparents may have been tradespeople. Some authors have suggested that his grandparents were Jewish &quot;conversos&quot;. Rafael Cómez proposes Velázquez may have had &quot;Morisco&quot; lineage.

Raised in modest circumstances, he showed an early gift for art, and was apprenticed to Francisco Pacheco, an artist and teacher in Seville. An early-18th century biographer, Antonio Palomino, said Velázquez studied for a short time under Francisco de Herrera before beginning his apprenticeship under Pacheco, but this is undocumented. A contract signed on 17 September 1611, formalized a six-year apprenticeship with Pacheco, backdated to December 1610, and it has been suggested that Herrera may have substituted for a traveling Pacheco between December 1610 and September 1611.

Although considered a dull and undistinguished painter, Pacheco sometimes expressed a simple, direct realism, though his work remained essentially Mannerist. As a teacher, he was highly learned and encouraged his students&#x27; intellectual development. In Pacheco&#x27;s school, Velázquez studied the classics, was trained in proportion and perspective, and witnessed the trends in the literary and artistic circles of Seville.
On 23 April 1618, Velázquez married Juana Pacheco (1 June 160210 August 1660), the daughter of his teacher. They had two daughters. The elder, Francisca de Silva Velázquez y Pacheco (1619–1658), married painter Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo at the Church of Santiago in Madrid on 21 August 1633. The younger, Ignacia de Silva Velázquez y Pacheco, born in 1621, died in infancy.

Velázquez&#x27;s earliest works are bodegones (kitchen scenes with prominent still-life). He was one of the first Spanish artists to paint such scenes, and his &quot;Old Woman Frying Eggs&quot; (1618) demonstrates the young artist&#x27;s unusual skill in realistic depiction. The realism and dramatic lighting of this work may have been influenced by Caravaggio&#x27;s work—which Velázquez could have seen second-hand, in copies—and by the polychrome sculpture in Sevillian churches. Two of his bodegones, &quot;Kitchen Scene with Christ in the House of Martha&quot; (1618) and &quot;Kitchen Scene with Christ at Emmaus&quot; (), feature religious scenes in the background, painted in a way that creates ambiguity as to whether the religious scene is a painting on the wall, a representation of the thoughts of the kitchen maid in the foreground, or an actual incident seen through a window. &quot;The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception&quot; (1618–19) follows a formula used by Pacheco, but replaces the idealized facial type and smoothly finished surfaces of his teacher with the face of a local girl and varied brushwork. His other religious works include &quot;The Adoration of the Magi&quot; (1619) and &quot;Saint John the Evangelist on the Island of Patmos&quot; (1618–19), both of which begin to express his more pointed and careful realism.

Also from this period are the portrait of &quot;Sor Jerónima de la Fuente&quot; (1620)—Velázquez&#x27;s first full-length portrait—and the genre &quot;The Water Seller of Seville&quot; (1618–1622). &quot;The Water Seller of Seville&quot; has been termed &quot;the peak of Velázquez&#x27;s &quot;bodegones&quot;&quot; and is admired for its virtuoso rendering of volumes and textures as well as for its enigmatic gravitas.

==To Madrid (early period)==

Velázquez had established his reputation in Seville by the early 1620s. He traveled to Madrid in April 1622, with letters of introduction to Don Juan de Fonseca, chaplain to the King. Velázquez was not allowed to paint the new king, Philip IV, but portrayed the poet Luis de Góngora at the request of Pacheco. The portrait showed Góngora crowned with a laurel wreath, which Velázquez later painted over. He returned to Seville in January 1623 and remained there until August.

In December 1622, Rodrigo de Villandrando, the king&#x27;s favorite court painter, died. Velázquez received a command to come to the court from Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, the powerful minister of PhilipIV. He was offered 50 ducats (175 g of gold) to defray his expenses, and he was accompanied by his father-in-law. Fonseca lodged the young painter in his home and sat for a portrait, which, when completed, was conveyed to the royal palace. A portrait of the king was commissioned, and on 30 August 1623, PhilipIV sat for Velázquez. The portrait pleased the king, and Olivares commanded Velázquez to move to Madrid, promising that no other painter would ever paint Philip&#x27;s portrait and all other portraits of the king would be withdrawn from circulation. In the following year, 1624, he received 300 ducats from the king to pay the cost of moving his family to Madrid, which became his home for the remainder of his life.

Velázquez secured admission to the royal service with a salary of 20 ducats per month, lodgings and payment for the pictures he might paint. His portrait of Philip was exhibited on the steps of San Felipe and received with enthusiasm. It is now lost (as is the portrait of Fonseca). The Museo del Prado, however, has two of Velázquez&#x27;s portraits of the king (nos. 1070 and 1071) in which the severity of the Seville period has disappeared and the tones are more delicate. The modeling is firm, recalling that of Antonio Mor, the Dutch portrait painter of Philip II, who exercised a considerable influence on the Spanish school. Velázquez depicts Philip wearing the &quot;golilla&quot; (es), a stiff linen collar projecting at right angles from the neck. The &quot;golilla&quot; replaced the earlier court fashion of elaborate ruffed collars as part of Philip&#x27;s dress reform laws during a period of economic crisis.

The Prince of Wales (afterwards Charles I) arrived at the court of Spain in 1623. Records indicate that he sat for Velázquez, but the picture is now lost.

In 1627, Philip set a competition for the best painters of Spain with the subject to be the expulsion of the Moors. Velázquez won, with a painting (destroyed in a fire at the palace in 1734) which records say depicted Philip III pointing with his baton to a crowd of men and women being led away by soldiers, while the female personification of Spain sits in calm repose. Velázquez was appointed gentleman usher as reward. Later he also received a daily allowance of 12 réis, the same amount allotted to the court barbers, and 90 ducats a year for dress.

In September 1628, Peter Paul Rubens was positioned in Madrid as an emissary from the Infanta Isabella, and Velázquez accompanied him to view the Titians at the Escorial. Rubens, who demonstrated his brilliance as painter and courtier during the seven months of the diplomatic mission, had a high opinion of Velázquez but had no significant influence on his painting. He did, however, galvanize Velázquez&#x27;s desire to see Italy and the works of the great Italian masters.

In 1629, Velázquez received 100 ducats for the picture of Bacchus (&quot;The Triumph of Bacchus&quot;), also called &quot;Los Borrachos&quot; (The Drunks), a painting of a group of men in contemporary dress paying homage to a half-naked ivy-crowned young man seated on a wine barrel. Velázquez&#x27;s first mythological painting, it has been interpreted variously as a depiction of a theatrical performance, as a parody, or as a symbolic representation of peasants asking the god of wine to give them relief from their sorrows. The style shows the naturalism of Velázquez&#x27;s early works slightly touched by the influence of Titian and Rubens.

==Italian period==
In 1629, Velázquez was given permission to spend a year and a half in Italy. Although this first visit is recognized as a crucial chapter in the development of his style—and in the history of Spanish Royal Patronage, since PhilipIV sponsored his trip—few details and specifics are known of what the painter saw, whom he met, how he was perceived and what innovations he hoped to introduce into his painting.

He traveled to Venice, Ferrara, Cento, Loreto, Bologna, and Rome. In 1630, he visited Naples to paint the portrait of Maria Anna of Spain, and there he probably met Ribera. The major works from his first Italian period are &quot;Joseph&#x27;s Bloody Coat brought to Jacob&quot; (1629–30) and &quot;Apollo in the Forge of Vulcan&quot; (1630), both of which reveal his ambition to rival the Italians as a history painter in the grand manner. The two compositions of several nearly life-sized figures have similar dimensions, and may have been conceived as pendants—the biblical scene depicting a deception, and the mythological scene depicting the revelation of a deception. As he had done in &quot;The Triumph of Bacchus&quot;, Velázquez presented his characters as contemporary people whose gestures and facial expressions were those of everyday life. Following the example of Bolognese painters such as Guido Reni, Velázquez painted &quot;Apollo in the Forge of Vulcan&quot; on canvas prepared with a light gray ground rather than the dark reddish ground of all his earlier works. The change resulted in a greater luminosity than he had previously achieved, and he made the use of light-gray grounds his regular practice.

===Return to Madrid (middle period)===

Velázquez returned to Madrid in January 1631. That year he completed the first of his many portraits of the young prince, beginning with &quot;Prince Balthasar Charles with a Dwarf&quot; (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts). ln portraits such as &quot;Equestrian portrait of prince Balthasar Charles&quot; (1635), Velázquez depicts the prince looking dignified and lordly, or in the dress of a field marshal on his prancing steed. In one version, the scene is in the riding school of the palace, the king and queen looking on from a balcony, while Olivares attends as master of the horse to the prince.

To decorate the king&#x27;s new palace, the Palacio del Buen Retiro, Velázquez painted equestrian portraits of the royal family. In &quot;PhilipIV on Horseback&quot; (1634–35), the king is represented in profile in an image of imperturbable majesty, demonstrating expert horsemanship by executing an effortless levade. The large &quot;The Surrender of Breda&quot; (1634–35), also painted for the Palacio, is Velázquez&#x27;s only extant painting depicting contemporary history. Its symbolic treatment of a Spanish military victory over the Dutch eschews the rhetoric of conquest and superiority that is typical in such scenes, in which a general on horseback looks down on his vanquished, kneeling opponent. Instead, Velázquez shows the Spanish general standing before his Dutch counterpart as an equal, and extending to him a hand of consolation.

The impassive, saturnine face of the influential minister Olivares is familiar to us from the many portraits painted by Velázquez. Two are notable: one is full-length, stately and dignified, in which he wears the green cross of the order of Alcantara and holds a wand, the badge of his office as master of the horse; in the other, &quot;The Count-Duke of Olivares on Horseback&quot; (), he is flatteringly represented as a field marshal during action. In these portraits, Velázquez well repaid the debt of gratitude that he owed to the patron who had first brought him to the king&#x27;s attention.

The sculptor Juan Martínez Montañés modeled a statue on one of Velázquez&#x27;s equestrian portraits of the king (painted in 1636; now lost) which was cast in bronze by the Florentine sculptor Pietro Tacca and now stands in the Plaza de Oriente in Madrid. Velázquez was in close attendance to Philip, and accompanied him to Aragon in 1644, where the artist painted a portrait of the monarch in the costume as he reviewed his troops in Fraga.

Velázquez&#x27;s paintings of &quot;Aesop&quot; and &quot;Menippus&quot; (both ) portray ancient writers in the guise of portraits of beggars. &quot;Mars Resting&quot; () is both a depiction of a mythological figure and a portrait of a weary-looking, middle-aged man posing as Mars. The model is painted with attention to his individuality, while his unkempt, oversized mustache is a faintly comic incongruity. The equivocal image has been interpreted in various ways: Javier Portús describes it as a &quot;reflection on reality, representation, and the artistic vision&quot;, while Alfonso E. Pérez Sánchez says it &quot;has also been seen as a melancholy meditation on the arms of Spain in decline&quot;.

Had it not been for his royal appointment, which enabled Velázquez to escape the censorship of the Inquisition, he would not have been able to release his &quot;La Venus del espejo&quot; (, English: &quot;Venus at her Mirror&quot;) also known as &quot;The Rokeby Venus&quot;. It is the first known female nude painted by a Spanish artist, and the only surviving female nude by Velázquez.

====Portraiture====
Besides the many portraits of Philip by Velázquez—thirty-four by one count—he painted portraits of other members of the royal family: Philip&#x27;s first wife, Elisabeth of Bourbon, and her children, especially her eldest son, Don Baltasar Carlos, whom Velázquez first depicted at about two years of age. Cavaliers, soldiers, churchmen, and the poet Francisco de Quevedo (now at Apsley House), sat for Velázquez.

Velázquez also painted several buffoons and dwarfs in Philip&#x27;s court, whom he depicted sympathetically and with respect for their individuality, as in &quot;The Jester Don Diego de Acedo&quot; (1644), whose intelligent face and huge folio with ink-bottle and pen by his side show him to be a wise and well-educated man. &quot;Pablo de Valladolid&quot; (1635), a buffoon evidently acting a part, and &quot;The Buffoon of Coria&quot; (1639) belong to this middle period.

As court painter, Velázquez had fewer commissions for religious works than any of his contemporaries. &quot;Christ Crucified&quot; (1632), painted for the Convent of San Plácido in Madrid, depicts Christ immediately after death. The Savior&#x27;s head hangs on his breast and a mass of dark tangled hair conceals part of the face, visually reinforcing the idea of death. The figure is presented alone before a dark background.

Velázquez&#x27;s son-in-law Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo had succeeded him as usher in 1634, and Mazo himself had received a steady promotion in the royal household. Mazo received a pension of 500 ducats in 1640, increased to 700 in 1648, for portraits painted and to be painted, and was appointed inspector of works in the palace in 1647.

Philip now entrusted Velázquez with the mission of procuring paintings and sculpture for the royal collection. Rich in pictures, Spain was weak in statuary, and Velázquez was commissioned once again to proceed to Italy to make purchases.

===Second visit to Italy===

When he set out in 1649, he was accompanied by his assistant Juan de Pareja who at this point in time was a slave and who had been trained in painting by Velázquez. Velázquez sailed from Málaga, landed at Genoa, and proceeded from Milan to Venice, buying paintings of Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese as he went. At Modena he was received with much favor by the duke, and here he painted the portrait of the duke at the Modena gallery and two portraits that now adorn the Dresden gallery, for these paintings came from the Modena sale of 1746.

Those works presage the advent of the painter&#x27;s third and latest manner, a noble example of which is the great portrait of Pope Innocent X in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery in Rome, where Velázquez now proceeded. There he was received with marked favor by the Pope, who presented him with a medal and golden chain. Velázquez took a copy of the portrait—which Sir Joshua Reynolds thought was the finest picture in Rome—with him to Spain. Several copies of it exist in different galleries, some of them possibly studies for the original or replicas painted for Philip. Velázquez, in this work, had now reached the &quot;manera abreviada&quot;, a term coined by contemporary Spaniards for this bolder, sharper style. The portrait shows such ruthlessness in Innocent&#x27;s expression that some in the Vatican feared that it would be seen unfavorably by the Pope; in fact Innocent was pleased with the work, and hung it in his official visitor&#x27;s waiting room.
In 1650 in Rome Velázquez also painted a &quot;portrait of Juan de Pareja&quot;, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, US. This portrait procured his election into the Accademia di San Luca. Purportedly Velázquez created this portrait as a warm-up of his skills before his portrait of the Pope. It captures in great detail Pareja&#x27;s countenance and his somewhat worn and patched clothing with an economic use of brushwork. In November 1650, Juan de Pareja was freed from slavery by Velázquez.

To this period also belong two small landscape paintings both titled &quot;View of the Garden of the Villa Medici&quot;. As landscapes apparently painted directly from nature, they were exceptional for their time, and reveal Velázquez&#x27;s close study of light at different times of day.

As part of his mission to procure decorations for the &quot;Room of Mirrors&quot; at the Royal Alcazar of Madrid, Velázquez commissioned Matteo Bonuccelli to cast twelve bronze copies of the Medici lions. The copies are now in the Royal Palace of Madrid and the Museo del Prado.

During his time in Rome, Velázquez fathered a natural son, Antonio, whom he is not known ever to have seen.

==Return to Spain and later career==
From February 1650, Philip repeatedly sought Velázquez&#x27;s return to Spain. Accordingly, after visiting Naples—where he saw his old friend Jose Ribera—and Venice, Velázquez returned to Spain via Barcelona in 1651, taking with him many pictures and 300 pieces of statuary, which afterwards were arranged and catalogued for the king.

Elisabeth of France had died in 1644, and the king had married Mariana of Austria, whom Velázquez now painted in many attitudes. In 1652 he was specially chosen by the king to fill the high office of &quot;aposentador mayor&quot;, which imposed on him the duty of looking after the quarters occupied by the court—a responsible function which was no sinecure and one which interfered with the exercise of his art. Yet far from indicating any decline, his works of this period are amongst the highest examples of his style.

One of the &quot;infantas&quot;, Margaret Theresa, the eldest daughter of the new queen, appears to be the subject of (1656, English: &quot;The Maids of Honour&quot;), Velázquez&#x27;s magnum opus.
Created four years before his death, it serves as an outstanding example of European baroque art. Luca Giordano, a contemporary Italian painter, referred to it as the &quot;theology of painting&quot;, and in 1827 the president of the Royal Academy of Arts Sir Thomas Lawrence described it in a letter as &quot;the true philosophy of the art&quot;. However, it is unclear as to who or what is the true subject of the picture. Is it the royal daughter, or perhaps the painter himself? The king and queen are seen reflected in a mirror on the back wall, but the source of the reflection is a mystery: are the royal pair standing in the viewer&#x27;s space, or does the mirror reflect the painting on which Velázquez is working? Dale Brown says Velázquez may have conceived the faded image of the king and queen on the back wall as a foreshadowing of the fall of the Spanish Empire that was to gain momentum following Philip&#x27;s death.

In the 1966 book &quot;Les Mots et Les Choses&quot; (&quot;The Order of Things&quot;), philosopher Michel Foucault devotes the opening chapter to a detailed analysis of . He describes the ways in which the painting problematizes issues of representation through its use of mirrors, screens, and the subsequent oscillations that occur between the image&#x27;s interior, surface, and exterior.

It is said the king painted the honorary &quot;Cross of Saint James&quot; of the Order of Santiago on the breast of the painter as it appears today on the canvas. However, Velázquez did not receive this honor of knighthood until three years after execution of this painting. Even the King of Spain could not make his favorite court painter a belted knight without the consent of the commission established to inquire into the purity of his lineage. The aim of these inquiries would be to prevent the appointment to positions of anyone found to have even a taint of heresy in their lineage—that is, a trace of Jewish or Moorish blood or contamination by trade or commerce in either side of the family for many generations. The records of this commission have been found among the archives of the Order of Santiago. Velázquez was awarded the honor in 1659. His occupation as plebeian and tradesman was justified because, as painter to the king, he was evidently not involved in the practice of &quot;selling&quot; pictures.

===Final years===
There were essentially only two patrons of art in Spain—the church and the art-loving king and court. Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, who toiled for a rich and powerful church, left little means to pay for his burial, while Velázquez lived and died in the enjoyment of a good salary and pension.

One of his final works was &quot;Las hilanderas&quot; (&quot;The Spinners&quot;), painted circa 1657, a depiction of Ovid&#x27;s Fable of Arachne. The tapestry in the background is based on Titian&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of Europa&quot;, or, more probably, the copy that Rubens painted in Madrid. It is full of light, air and movement, featuring vibrant colors and careful handling. Anton Raphael Mengs said this work seemed to have been painted not by the hand but by the pure force of will. It displays a concentration of all the art-knowledge Velázquez had gathered during his long artistic career of more than forty years. The scheme is simple—a confluence of varied and blended red, bluish-green, gray and black.

Velázquez&#x27;s final portraits of the royal children are among his finest works and in the &quot;Infanta Margarita Teresa in a Blue Dress&quot; the painter&#x27;s personal style reached its high-point: shimmering spots of color on wide painting surfaces produce an almost impressionistic effect—the viewer must stand at a suitable distance to get the impression of complete, three-dimensional spatiality.

His only surviving portrait of the delicate and sickly Prince Felipe Prospero is remarkable for its combination of the sweet features of the child prince and his dog with a subtle sense of gloom. The hope that was placed at that time in the sole heir to the Spanish crown is reflected in the depiction: fresh red and white stand in contrast to late autumnal, morbid colors. A small dog with wide eyes looks at the viewer as if questioningly, and the largely pale background hints at a gloomy fate: the little prince was barely four years old when he died. As in all of the artist&#x27;s late paintings, the handling of the colors is extraordinarily fluid and vibrant.

In 1660, a peace treaty between France and Spain was consummated by the marriage of Maria Theresa with Louis XIV, and the ceremony took place on the Island of Pheasants, a small swampy island in the Bidassoa. Velázquez was charged with the decoration of the Spanish pavilion and with the entire scenic display. He attracted much attention from the nobility of his bearing and the splendor of his costume. On 26 June he returned to Madrid, and on 31 July he was stricken with fever. Feeling his end approaching, he signed his will, appointing as his sole executors his wife and his firm friend named Fuensalida, keeper of the royal records. He died on 6 August 1660. He was buried in the Fuensalida vault of the church of San Juan Bautista, and within eight days his wife Juana was buried beside him. This church was destroyed by the French around 1809, so his place of interment is now unknown.

There was much difficulty in adjusting the tangled accounts outstanding between Velázquez and the treasury, and it was not until 1666, after the death of King Philip, that they were finally settled.

==Style and technique==
It is canonical to divide Velázquez&#x27;s career by his two visits to Italy. He rarely signed his pictures, and the royal archives give the dates of only his most important works. Internal evidence and history pertaining to his portraits supply the rest to a certain extent.

Although acquainted with all the Italian schools and a friend of the foremost painters of his day, Velázquez was strong enough to withstand external influences and work out for himself the development of his own nature and his own principles of art. He rejected the pomp that characterized the portraiture of other European courts, and instead brought an even greater reserve to the understated formula for Habsburg portraiture established by Titian, Antonio Mor, and Alonso Sánchez Coello. He is known for using a rather limited palette, but he mixed the available paints with great skill to achieve varying hues. His pigments were not significantly different from those of his contemporaries and he mainly employed azurite, smalt, vermilion, red lake, lead-tin-yellow and ochres. His early works were painted on canvases prepared with a red-brown ground. He adopted the use of light-gray grounds during his first trip to Italy, and continued using them for the rest of his life. The change resulted in paintings with greater luminosity and a generally cool, silvery range of color.

Few drawings are securely attributed to Velázquez. Although preparatory drawings for some of his paintings exist, his method was to paint directly from life, and x-rays of his paintings reveal that he frequently made changes in his composition as a painting progressed.

==Legacy==
Velázquez was not prolific; he is estimated to have produced between 110 and 120 known canvases. He produced no etchings or engravings, and only a few drawings are attributed to him.

Velázquez is the most influential figure in the history of Spanish portraiture. Although he had few immediate followers, Spanish court painters such as his son-in-law Juan Bautista Martinez del Mazo and Juan Carreño de Miranda took inspiration from his work. Mazo closely mimicked his style and many paintings and copies by Mazo were formerly attributed to Velázquez. Velázquez&#x27;s reputation languished in the eighteenth century, when Spanish court portraiture was dominated by artists of foreign birth and training. Towards the end of the century, his importance was increasingly recognized by intellectuals close to the Spanish court—an essay published In 1781 by Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos said of Velázquez that &quot;when he died, the glory of Painting in Spain died with him.&quot; In 1778, Goya made a set of etchings after paintings by Velázquez, as part of a project by the Count of Floridablanca to produce prints of paintings in the Royal Collection. Goya&#x27;s free copies reveal a searching engagement with the older master&#x27;s work, which remained a model for Goya for the rest of his career.

Velázquez&#x27;s work was little known outside of Spain until the nineteenth century. His paintings mostly escaped being stolen by the French marshals during the Peninsular War. In 1828, Sir David Wilkie wrote from Madrid that he felt himself in the presence of a new power in art as he looked at the works of Velázquez, and at the same time found a wonderful affinity between this artist and the British school of portrait painters, especially Henry Raeburn. He was struck by the &quot;sparkle and vivacity&quot; pervading Velázquez&#x27;s works.

Velázquez is often cited as a key influence on the art of Édouard Manet, who is often considered the bridge between realism and impressionism. Calling Velázquez the &quot;painter of painters&quot;, Manet admired the immediacy and vivid brushwork of Velázquez&#x27;s work, and built upon Velázquez&#x27;s motifs in his own art. In the late nineteenth century, artists such as James McNeill Whistler and John Singer Sargent were strongly influenced by Velázquez.

===Modern recreations of classics===
The respect with which twentieth century painters regard Velázquez&#x27;s work attests to its continuing importance. Pablo Picasso paid homage to Velázquez in 1957 when he recreated in 44 variations, in his characteristic style. Although Picasso was concerned that his reinterpretations of Velázquez&#x27;s painting would be seen merely as copies rather than as unique representations, the enormous works—the largest he had produced since &quot;Guernica&quot; (1937)—entered the canon of Spanish art.

Salvador Dalí, as with Picasso, in anticipation of the tercentennial of Velázquez&#x27;s death, created in 1958 a work entitled&quot; Velázquez Painting the Infanta Margarita With the Lights and Shadows of His Own Glory&quot;. The color scheme shows Dalí&#x27;s serious tribute to Velázquez; the work also functioned, as in Picasso&#x27;s case, as a vehicle for the presentation of newer theories in art and thought—nuclear mysticism, in Dalí&#x27;s case.

The Anglo-Irish painter Francis Bacon found Velázquez&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Innocent X&quot; to be &quot;one of the greatest portraits ever&quot;. He created several expressionist variations of this piece in the 1950s; however, Bacon&#x27;s paintings sometimes presented a more gruesome image of Innocent. One such famous variation, entitled &quot;Figure with Meat&quot; (1954), shows the pope between two halves of a bisected cow.

Some South American artists also pay tribute to him such as Fernando Botero with his portraits of oversized characters extracted from some of Vélasquez paintings and Herman Braun-Vega with his series &quot;Velasquez exposed accompanied by the Menines&quot; from which the main polyptych is exhibited at the Antioquia Museum in Medellín, Colombia and the quadriptych &quot;Velasquez going to his easel&quot; is at the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas.

===Recent rediscoveries of Velázquez originals===
In 2009, the &quot;Portrait of a Man&quot; in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which had long been associated with the followers of Velázquez&#x27; style of painting, was cleaned and restored. It was found to be by Velázquez himself, and the features of the man match those of a figure in the painting &quot;the Surrender of Breda&quot;. The newly cleaned canvas may therefore be a study for that painting. Although the attribution to Velázquez is regarded as certain, the identity of the sitter is still open to question. Some art historians consider this new study to be a self-portrait by Velázquez.

In 2010, it was reported that a damaged painting long relegated to a basement of the Yale University Art Gallery might be an early work by Velázquez. Thought to have been given to Yale in 1925, the painting has previously been attributed to the 17th century Spanish school. Some scholars are prepared to attribute the painting to Velázquez, although the Prado Museum in Madrid is reserving judgment. The work, which depicts the Virgin Mary being taught to read, will be restored by conservators at Yale.

In October 2011, it was confirmed by art historian Dr. Peter Cherry of Trinity College Dublin through X-ray analysis that a portrait found in the UK in the former collection of the 19th century painter Matthew Shepperson is a previously unknown work by Velázquez. The portrait is of an unidentified man in his fifties or sixties, who could possibly be Juan Mateos, the Master of the Hunt for Velázquez&#x27;s patron, King Philip IV of Spain. The painting measures 47 x 39 cm and was sold at auction on 7 December 2011, for £3,000,000.

===Descendants===
Velázquez, through his daughter Francisca de Silva Velázquez y Pacheco (1619–1658), is an ancestor of the Marquesses of Monteleone, including Enriquetta (Henrietta) Casado de Monteleone (1725–1761) who in 1746 married Heinrich VI, Count Reuss zu Köstritz (1707–1783). Through them are descended a number of European royalty, among them King Felipe VI of Spain through his mother Sophia of Greece and Denmark, King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, King Albert II of Belgium, Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein, and Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg.

==In popular culture==
Velázquez has been portrayed by Julián Villagrán in a Spanish fantasy television series, &quot;El ministerio del tiempo&quot;, and is a recurring character in the series.

<text>In Greek mythology, Athamas (; ) was a Boeotian king.

== Family ==
Athamas was formerly a Thessalian prince and the son of King Aeolus of Aeolia and Enarete, daughter of Deimachus. He was the brother of Salmoneus, Sisyphus, Cretheus, Perieres, Deioneus, Magnes, Calyce, Canace, Alcyone, Pisidice and Perimede. 

Athamas sired several children by his first wife, the goddess Nephele, and his other wives Ino and Themisto. Nephele first bore to him twins, a son Phrixus and a daughter Helle; and also a second son, Makistos. He subsequently married Ino, daughter of Cadmus, with whom he had two children: Learches and Melicertes. By the daughter of Hypseus, Themisto, he was the father of Sphincius and Orchomenus or Schoeneus and Leucon and also, Erythrius and Ptous.

== Mythology ==

Phrixus and Helle were hated by their stepmother, Ino. Ino hatched a devious plot to get rid of the twins, roasting all the town&#x27;s crop seeds so they would not grow. The local farmers, frightened of famine, asked a nearby oracle for assistance. Ino bribed the men sent to the oracle to lie and tell the others that the oracle required the sacrifice of Phrixus. Athamas reluctantly agreed. But, before Phrixus could be killed, he and Helle were spirited away by a flying golden ram sent by Nephele, their natural mother. Helle fell off the ram into the Hellespont (which was named after her) and died, but Phrixus survived all the way to Colchis, where King Aeëtes took him in and treated him kindly, giving Phrixus his daughter Chalciope in marriage. In gratitude, Phrixus gave the king the golden fleece of the ram, which Aeëtes hung in a tree in his kingdom. Later, Ino raised Dionysus, her nephew, son of her sister Semele, causing Hera&#x27;s intense jealousy. In vengeance, Hera struck Athamas with insanity. Athamas went mad and slew one of his sons, Learchus; Ino, to escape the pursuit of her frenzied husband, threw herself into the sea with her son Melicertes. Both were afterwards worshipped as marine divinities, Ino as Leucothea, Melicertes as Palaemon. In another version Ino killed Melicertes after finding out that Athamas was sleeping with a slave woman named Antiphera.

Athamas, with the guilt of his son&#x27;s murder upon him, was obliged to flee from Boeotia. He was ordered by the oracle to settle in a place where he should receive hospitality from wild beasts. This he found at Phthiotis in Thessaly, where he surprised some wolves eating sheep; on his approach they fled, leaving him the bones. Athamas, regarding this as the fulfilment of the oracle, settled there and married a third wife, Themisto (sons: Schoeneus, Leucon, Ptous and/or others). The spot was afterwards called the Athamanian plain. When Athamas returned to his second wife, Ino, Themisto sought revenge by dressing her children in white clothing and Ino&#x27;s in black. Ino switched their clothes without Themisto&#x27;s knowledge, and she killed her own children.

According to some accounts, Athamas was succeeded on the throne by Presbon. A part of Kingdom of Athamas, and himself, moved in a northwesterly direction and took roots in a part of Pindus mountains in Epirus, called Athamanian mountains. So this population was called the Athamanians.

<text>Bithynia (; ) was an ancient region, kingdom and Roman province in the northwest of Asia Minor (present-day Turkey), adjoining the Sea of Marmara, the Bosporus, and the Black Sea. It bordered Mysia to the southwest, Paphlagonia to the northeast along the Pontic coast, and Phrygia to the southeast towards the interior of Asia Minor.

Hellenistic Bithynia was an independent kingdom from the 4th century BC. Its capital Nicomedia was rebuilt on the site of ancient Astacus in 264 BC by Nicomedes I of Bithynia. Bithynia was bequeathed to the Roman Republic in 74 BC, and became united with the Pontus region as the province of Bithynia and Pontus. In the 7th century it was incorporated into the Byzantine Opsikion theme.
It became a border region to the Seljuk Empire in the 13th century, and was eventually conquered by the Ottoman Turks between 1325 and 1333.

==Description==
Several major cities sat on the fertile shores of the Propontis (which is now known as Sea of Marmara): Nicomedia, Chalcedon, Cius and Apamea. Bithynia also contained Nicaea, noted for being the birthplace of the Nicene Creed.

According to Strabo, Bithynia was bounded on the east by the river Sangarius (modern Sakarya river), but the more commonly received division extended it to the Parthenius, which separated it from Paphlagonia, thus comprising the district inhabited by the Mariandyni. On the west and southwest it was separated from Mysia by the river Rhyndacus and on the south it adjoined Phrygia and Galatia.

It is occupied by mountains and forests, but has valleys and coastal districts of great fertility. The most important mountain range is the (so-called) &quot;Mysian&quot; Olympus (), which towers above Bursa and is clearly visible as far away as Istanbul (). Its summits are covered with snow for a great part of the year.

East of this the range extends for more than , from the Sakarya to Paphlagonia. Both of these ranges are part of the border of mountains which bound the great tableland of Anatolia, Turkey. The broad tract which projects towards the west as far as the shores of the Bosporus, though hilly and covered with forests—the Turkish &quot;Ağaç Denizi&quot;, or &quot;The sea of Trees&quot;—is not traversed by any mountain chain. The west coast is indented by two deep inlets, the northernmost, the Gulf of İzmit (ancient Gulf of Astacus), penetrating between into the interior as far as İzmit (ancient Nicomedia), separated by an isthmus of only about from the Black Sea; and the Gulf of Mudanya or Gemlik (Gulf of Cius), about long. At its extremity is situated the small town of Gemlik (ancient Cius) at the mouth of a valley, communicating with the lake of Iznik, on which was situated Nicaea.

The principal rivers are the Sangarios which traverses the province from south to north; the Rhyndacus, which separated it from Mysia; and the Billaeus (Filyos), which rises in the Aladağ, about from the sea, and after flowing by modern Bolu (ancient Bithynion-Claudiopolis) falls into the Euxine, close to the ruins of the ancient Tium, about northeast of Heraclea Pontica (the modern Karadeniz Ereğli), having a course of more than . The Parthenius (modern Bartın), the eastern boundary of the province, is a much less considerable stream.

The valleys towards the Black Sea abound in fruit trees of all kinds, such as oranges, while the valley of the Sangarius and the plains near Bursa and Iznik (Nicaea) are fertile and well cultivated. Extensive plantations of mulberry trees supply the silk for which Bursa has long been celebrated, and which is manufactured there on a large scale.

==History==
===Iron Age===
Bithynia is named for the Thracian tribe of the &quot;Bithyni&quot;, mentioned by Herodotus (VII.75) alongside the &quot;Thyni&quot;. The &quot;Thraco-Phrygian&quot; migration from the Balkans to Asia Minor would have taken place at some point following the Bronze Age collapse or during the early Iron Age. The Thyni and Bithyni appear to have settled simultaneously in the adjoining parts of Asia, where they expelled or subdued the Mysians, Caucones and other minor tribes, the Mariandyni maintaining themselves in the northeast. Herodotus mentions the Thyni and Bithyni as settling side by side. No trace of their original language has been preserved, but Herodotus describes them as related to the tribes of Thracian extraction.

Later the Greeks established on the coast the colonies of Cius (modern Gemlik); Chalcedon (modern Kadıköy), at the entrance of the Bosporus, nearly opposite Byzantium (modern Istanbul) and Heraclea Pontica (modern Karadeniz Ereğli), on the Euxine, about east of the Bosporus.

The Bithynians were incorporated by king Croesus within the Lydian monarchy, with which they fell under the dominion of Persia (546 BC), and were included in the satrapy of Phrygia, which comprised all the countries up to the Hellespont and Bosporus.

===Kingdom of Bithynia===

Even before the conquest by Alexander the Bithynians appear to have asserted their independence, and successfully maintained it under two native princes, Bas and Zipoites, the latter of whom assumed the title of king (&quot;basileus&quot;) in 297 BC.

His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign ( BC), as well as those of his successors, Prusias I, Prusias II and Nicomedes II (149–91 BC), the kings of Bithynia had a considerable standing and influence among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. But the last king, Nicomedes IV, was unable to maintain himself in power against Mithridates VI of Pontus. After being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate, he bequeathed his kingdom through his will to the Roman Republic (74 BC).

The coinage of these kings show their regal portraits, which tend to be engraved in an extremely accomplished Hellenistic style.

===Roman province===

As a Roman province, the boundaries of Bithynia changed frequently. During this period, Bithynia was commonly united for administrative purposes with the province of Pontus within the Roman Empire. This was the situation at the time of Emperor Trajan, when Pliny the Younger was appointed governor of the combined provinces (109/110111/112), a circumstance which has provided historians with valuable information concerning the Roman provincial administration at that time.

=== Byzantine province ===
Under the Byzantine Empire, Bithynia was again divided into two provinces, separated by the Sangarius. Only the area to the west of the river retained the name of Bithynia.

Bithynia attracted much attention because of its roads and its strategic position between the frontiers of the Danube in the north and the Euphrates in the south-east. To secure communications with the eastern provinces, the monumental bridge across the river Sangarius was constructed around 562. Troops frequently wintered at Nicomedia.

During this time, the most important cities in Bithynia were Nicomedia, founded by Nicomedes, and Nicaea. The two had a long rivalry with each other over which city held the rank of capital.
