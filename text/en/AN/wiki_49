<text>Biodiversity plays an essential role in the global economy. This includes its role in providing ecosystem services - the benefits that humans get from ecosystems. Biodiversity plays a major role in the productivity and functioning of ecosystems, affects their ability to provide ecosystem services. For example, biodiversity is a source of food, medication, and materials used in industry. Recreation and tourism are also examples of human economic activities that rely on these benefits. In 2018, the WWF Living Planet Report argues that the whole global economy of US$125 trillion ultimately relies on nature.

The benefits of biodiversity are often evaluated in an anthropocentric way and the inherent value of biodiversity, outside of its benefits to humanity, has been debated by economists. Despite these benefits, economic activities often result in harm to biodiversity, such as through deforestation.

The majority of species have yet to be evaluated for their current or future economic importance. Raw materials, pharmaceuticals and drug production all directly and indirectly depend upon biodiversity.

==Agriculture and food==

Biodiversity plays an essential economic role in agriculture as the origin of all crops and domesticated livestock, contributing both to food security and to livelihoods. Around 25% of the global population is estimated to work in agriculture. Estimating the economic value of biodiversity (and the costs of its continued loss) in agriculture and through the use of wild species for food is both challenging and controversial. 

Agricultural biodiversity (agrobiodiversity) refers to all the components of biodiversity that are relevant to food and agriculture, and that make up agricultural ecosystems. More specifically, the term food biodiversity refers to the diversity of organisms used for food. Agrobiodiversity provides income through food and raw materials, as well as by supporting ecosystem services that are essential for agricultural productivity, including pollination, pest control, nutrient cycling, and climate regulation. 

Income is generated from the harvest and sale of wild species, as well as from those that have been cultivated and domesticated. This can play an important role in supporting the livelihoods of people living in developing economies. For example, wild meat (bushmeat) is harvested by rural households in some countries to support dietary requirements and as a source of subsistence income, though the practice is controversial. The trade in bushmeat occurs both legally and illegally, for cultural reasons as well as socio-economic ones.

Biodiversity includes genetic diversity, providing genetic resources for food and agriculture. The term genetic resources refers to &quot;genetic material of actual or potential value&quot;, according to the Convention on Biological Diversity. These resources are important as the raw material for evolution by natural and artificial selection to enable the development of new cultivars with higher yields, greater tolerance to abiotic stresses, and greater resistance to pests and diseases. The role of genetic diversity in reducing risk to commercial output from farms or forests has been said to contribute to the indirect economic value of biodiversity. Genetic resources may also be used in biotechnology, such as for genetic engineering, though concerns have been raised that the use of such methods could increase genetic erosion. Estimating the economic value of conserving such resources is difficult and their global value is largely unquantified as a result.

About 70% of crop genetic diversity and 30% of livestock genetic diversity has been lost. The loss of genetic diversity reduces the resilience of food systems to pests, diseases, abiotic stresses, and climate change, posing a threat to food security. These risks can reduce yields, therefore having an economic and social impact. In addition, species diversity (an aspect of biodiversity) in the global food system is relatively low when compared to the total number of described species; it was estimated that only 40 species of mammals and birds have been domesticated for agriculture and less than 200 plant species are produced on a significant scale globally. This compares to a total of approximately 6,400 mammal species, 11,000 avian species, and 391,000 plant species (out of which 6,000 have been cultivated for food and agriculture).

Despite the importance of biodiversity to agriculture and its role in the global economy, the global food system is thought to be a primary driver of biodiversity loss, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. For example, this may occur as a result of deforestation and land use change for agricultural expansion.

===Biological pest control===

An important ecosystem function associated with biodiversity is pest control. Control species can suppress pest populations and reduce loss of crop yields without the negative impacts of chemical pesticides. This has economic benefits and maintaining natural pest control is important to humanity&#x27;s ability to grow crops. It can also be applied within horticulture. 

Biological pest control can reduce economic losses incurred as a result of pests, disease vectors, and invasive species. However, its use can have unintended effects where control species are introduced without adequate research. For example, the cane toad was introduced to Queensland, Australia in 1935 to control cane beetles that attack sugarcane roots but are now regarded as an invasive species through their damaging impacts on native species.

=== Horticulture ===
Horticulture refers to the small-scale cultivation of plants, such as for use in gardening. It encompasses both domesticated and wild species, cultivars, genotypes, and alleles. These plants may be used for food, medicine, or aesthetic and ornamental purposes. Horticultural plant biodiversity can be highly profitable and provides opportunities for employment. In the UK, growth of ornamental plants was worth £1.7 billion in 2023.

Originally, plants for horticultural use were sourced from wild populations, but now tend to come from nurseries, botanical gardens, and private collections. 

=== Aquaculture and fishing ===
Aquaculture and fishing are underpinned by biodiversity, with significant economic importance globally. By 2006, over 3 billion people were dependent on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods and 38 million people were estimated to be directly employed by fishing. In 2023, the global fishing market was estimated to be worth $656.96 billion, based on revenue. 

==Medicine==

Biodiversity plays a vital role in the maintenance of human health and a wide variety of products derived from plants, animals, and fungi are used in medicine. Biodiversity acts as a source of medicinal compounds, impacts the provision of ecosystem services that improve health and protect against disease, and as an inspiration for biomedical techniques that could be utilised to cure diseases (such as CRISPR/Cas9). Over 40% of pharmaceutical products are derived from nature, identified through indigenous knowledge and scientific methods, and 70% of all cancer drugs are natural or bioinspired products. This has significant economic implications. For example, the market for traditional medicine was predicted to reach a value of $115 billion by the end of 2023.

Wild plant species have been used for medicinal purposes since pre-historic times and over 60% of the world&#x27;s population still depends on herbal medicine as their primary source of healthcare. Some major antimalarial drugs are derived from plants. For example, quinine, derived from the bark of South American &quot;Cinchona&quot; trees is used as an anti-malarial. Artemisinin, another anti-malarial, was isolated from sweet wormwood by Tu Youyou. In addition, anti-cancer drugs like Taxol, Vincristine, and Vinblastine were isolated from plants.

==Industry==

Beyond agriculture and pharmaceuticals, biodiversity plays an important role in industry. It acts as a source of natural resources, materials, and products that are sold, consumed, or used in manufacturing. Many livelihoods are dependent on biodiversity as a result. Examples of some of the raw materials that originate from biodiversity include wood, plant fibers (such as cotton), animal fibers (such as wool and silk).

Ecosystem services, relied upon by industry and businesses, are underpinned by biodiversity. As a result, estimates of the value of these services to the global economy have been made, though this practice is controversial, with an estimate of US$125 trillion a year worldwide by WWF&#x27;s 2018 Living Planet Report. 

Biodiversity includes the morphological diversity of life forms. This can provide economic opportunities as inspiration for research and development of industrial materials and structures. For example, the ridges on pectoral fins of humpback whales have inspired the shape of wind turbine blades. The field of biomimetics is dedicated to the emulation of models, systems, and elements from nature to solve complex human problems. In the United States, biomimicry is estimated to account for $425 billion of the country&#x27;s GDP, according to the Fermanian Business and Economic Institute. This provides potential economic opportunities for developing countries with high levels of biodiversity, but has mainly been explored in developed economies.

==Tourism and recreation==

Through cultural ecosystem services, biodiversity provides economic benefits in the form of recreation and tourism, while also benefitting human wellbeing. Biodiversity influences the potential of ecosystems to provide recreational services. This includes outdoor recreation, such as hiking, hunting, fishing, and wildlife watching.

Another form of recreation supported by biodiversity is tourism. Biodiversity is &quot;at the heart of what drives the tourism industry&quot;, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. The beauty of tourist destinations or the species they support can attract tourists to visit certain areas. For example, destinations like rainforests, beaches, national parks, and nature reserves are attractive to tourists. The revenue generated through tourism is vital to many economies worldwide and accounts for 10% of the global job market.

Nature-based tourism, such as to visit protected areas, also has an important economic impact. For example, ecotourism, where the motivation of tourists is to observe and appreciate nature and the cultures in natural areas, while supporting their maintenance. In 2023, the global ecotourism market was estimated to be worth US$216.49 billion.

Despite the economic benefits from biodiversity through tourism, the tourism industry has negative impacts on biodiversity. For example, through habitat destruction and pollution. As a result, sustainable tourism emerged with the aim of reducing the negative impacts of tourism on the environment.

== Illegal wildlife trade ==

The illegal wildlife trade profits from biodiversity through the sale of products derived from non-domesticated animals, including those classed as endangered by the IUCN. According to the Zoological Society of London, the illegal wildlife trade is estimated to be worth $23 billion a year. Cultural demand (such as for bushmeat or use in traditional medicine) is one factor motivating the illegal wildlife trade, however, terrorist and criminal organisations engage in illicit trafficking of plants and animals to fund the purchase of weapons, fund civil conflicts, and other illegal activities.

Exploitation of biodiversity through wildlife smuggling has a negative impact on biodiversity itself, including by driving population declines, species extinctions, and the loss of genetic diversity. It can also impact biodiversity through biosecurity risks, including the potential to spread diseases that native populations may not be resistant to and through the introduction of alien species. 

== Impact of economic activity on biodiversity ==
Despite the role of biodiversity in underpinning the economy, economic activities often cause harm to biodiversity and the economic incentives they provide mean that they are often favoured over conservation and restoration activities. This contributes to the loss of biodiversity observed on a global scale with numerous causes, such as habitat loss, land-use change, pollution, and overexploitation. 

According to an estimate from BCG, more than 90% of the anthropogenic drivers of biodiversity loss result from economic activities linked to agriculture, infrastructure, fashion, and energy. In addition, the IUCN estimates that 79% of threatened species are impacted by agriculture, infrastructure, and energy and mining activities.

The failure to halt terrestrial biodiversity loss between 2000 and 2010 was estimated to cost the global economy $500 billion. Continued biodiversity loss and environmental degradation poses a long-term risk to society and the economy, such as by increasing the risk of pandemics, floods, and droughts.

<text>codice_1 is a utility command on Unix, Plan 9, Inferno, and Unix-like operating systems which, when fed a text file or standard input, outputs the text with adjacent identical lines collapsed to one, unique line of text.

==Overview==
The command is a kind of filter program. Typically it is used after codice_2. It can also output only the duplicate lines (with the codice_3 option), or add the number of occurrences of each line (with the codice_4 option). For example, the following command lists the unique lines in a file, sorted by the number of times each occurs:
$ sort file | uniq -c | sort -n
Using codice_5 like this is common when building pipelines in shell scripts.

==History==
First appearing in Version 3 Unix, codice_5 is now available for a number of different Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX and the Single Unix Specification.

The version bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Richard Stallman and David MacKenzie.

A codice_5 command is also part of ASCII&#x27;s &quot;MSX-DOS2 Tools&quot; for MSX-DOS version 2.

The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the GnuWin32 project and the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities.

The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

<text>The Sandman is a mythical character originating in Germanic and Scandinavian folklore who puts people to sleep and encourages and inspires beautiful dreams by sprinkling magical sand onto their eyes.

==Representation in traditional folklore==
The Sandman is a traditional character in many children&#x27;s stories and books. In Scandinavian folklore, he is said to sprinkle sand or dust on or into the eyes of children at night to bring on sleep and dreams. The grit or &quot;sleep&quot; (rheum) in one&#x27;s eyes upon waking is the supposed result of the Sandman&#x27;s work the previous night.

==Literature==


E. T. A. Hoffmann (1776–1822) wrote a short story in 1816 titled &quot;Der Sandmann&quot;, which showed how sinister such a character could be made. According to the protagonist&#x27;s nurse, he threw sand in the eyes of children who would not go to sleep, with the result of those eyes falling out and being collected by the Sandman, who then takes the eyes to his iron nest on the Moon and uses them to feed his children. The protagonist of the story grows to associate this nightmarish creature with the genuinely sinister figure of his father&#x27;s associate, Coppelius. In Romanian folklore, there is a similar character, Moș Ene (Ene the Elder). Hoffmann&#x27;s version of the sandman is also similar to the French Canadian character known as the (Goodman Seven O’Clock), who, in some versions, throws sand in children&#x27;s eyes to blind them so that he may capture them. Contrarily to the sandman, his bag is the place where he traps children who do not go to bed.

Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s 1841 folk tale &quot;Ole Lukøje&quot; introduced the Sandman, named Ole Lukøje, by relating dreams he gave to a young boy in a week through his magical technique of sprinkling dust in the eyes of the children. &quot;Ole&quot; is a Danish first name and &quot;Lukøje&quot; means &quot;close eye&quot;. Andersen wrote:

In Norway and Sweden, he is called John Blund or Jon Blund (&quot;blunda&quot; is a verb that means both &quot;to shut one&#x27;s eyes&quot; and &quot;to keep one&#x27;s eyes shut&quot;, and &quot;[en] blund&quot; is a noun that means both &quot;[an] occurrence of eyes shut&quot; and &quot;[an] occurrence of sleep&quot;), and in the Netherlands, Belgium and parts of southern Africa, he is referred to as &quot;Klaas Vaak&quot;.

Klaas Vaak is a character in a Dutch Musical &#x27;De sprookjesmusical Klaas Vaak&quot;, has its own TV-series &#x27;Fairytales of Klaas Vaak&#x27; and is one of the entertainers in the amusement park &#x27;Efteling&#x27;.

==Film and television==

The East German stop motion children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Unser Sandmännchen&quot; (&quot;Our Little Sandman&quot;), based on Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s Ole Lukøje character and the story by E. T. A. Hoffmann, has been broadcast since 1959, along with a West German version which was discontinued after reunification.

In the 1990s, Nilus the Sandman aired on Anglophone Canadian television.

In the 1970s, &quot;Bonne nuit les petits&quot; aired on French television. The show featured Nounours, a bear who took care of two toddlers, Nicolas and Pimprenelle. He would arrive on a cloud driven by his friend Sandman (“Le marchand de sable” in French) playing a flute as the sun set, and would only leave once he&#x27;d accompanied the children to bed. At the end of every episode, Nounours would say “Bonne nuit les petits” (which means “Good night, little ones”) before Sandman created a light shower of sand, putting the two siblings, Nicolas and Pimprenelle, to sleep. The bear and Sandman would then take their leave on the same cloud, once Nounours had climbed back up the ladder that he&#x27;d descended at the beginning of the episode. Here, Sandman has a major role to play, with his flute, driving the cloud, interacting with the other characters from time to time and, most importantly, inducing the children to fall asleep. 
The show was broadcast nightly at 7:50 pm, and each episode lasted 10 minutes, marking 8 pm as the bed-time when children, duly reassured, could sleep peacefully. It was later reduced to 5 minutes in the 1990s for the reboot series. In francophone Canada, it airs on Ici Radio-Canada Télé immediately before Le Téléjournal.

The Sandman appears in &quot;The Smurfs&quot; episodes &quot;Darkness Monster&quot; and &quot;Lazy&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;, voiced by Frank Welker.

In 1991, Paul Berry directed a stop-motion short film titled &quot;The Sandman&quot; based on the short story &quot;Der Sandmann&quot; by E. T. A. Hoffmann.

In 1998, the Sandman also appears in &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, where he appears in the episode &quot;Dream Scheme&quot;.

The Sandman appears in &quot;The Santa Clause 2&quot; and &quot;The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause&quot;, portrayed by Michael Dorn. He is shown to be a member of the Council of Legendary Figures and tends to doze off during meetings, giving the other members cause to wake him up.

The Sandman is supposedly represented as the demon Der Kindestod in the series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;.

Among the earlier productions of the British sci-fi television show &quot;Doctor Who&quot; following 2005 is an episode revolving around Sandmen. The ninth episode of the ninth season (2015), titled &quot;Sleep No More&quot;, is a found footage video narrated by Gagan Rassmussen (Reece Shearsmith), a scientist and professor from the 38th century. Rassmussen manufactures a dangerous adventure involving Sandmen, intended to engage people to watch the video and by which an electronic signal transmits to the brains of others in order to create further Sandmen. The episode also makes use of the song &quot;Mr. Sandman&quot;, written by Pat Ballard in 1954, as the Morpheus-machine theme.

The Sandman appears in &quot;Rise of the Guardians&quot; as a member of the Guardians.

Netflix released &quot;The Sandman&quot; series in 2022, an adaptation of the Neil Gaiman comics.

==Comics==
In &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot;, the Sandman lives in the Land of Dreams, which is located in the Realm of Fairies within the potentially imaginary world of Nowhere. The Sandman ruled over the realm and would place a blanket over it every day. Those who grabbed a dream from the dream tree would have a dream based on whatever they grabbed from the tree and awaken again when the Sandman removed the blanket over his land. Anyone who did not grab a dream would end up in an eternal, dreamless sleep.

Several fictional characters by the name of Sandman have appeared in comic books published by DC Comics. These include fantasy writer Neil Gaiman&#x27;s 75-part comic book series called &quot;The Sandman&quot; for Vertigo Comics (an imprint of DC Comics). The original series ran from 1989 to 1996. It tells the story of Dream of the Endless, who rules over the world of dreams. He is an anthropomorphic personification of dreams known to various characters throughout the series as Morpheus, Oneiros, the Shaper of Form, Lord of the Dreaming, the Dream King, Dream-Sneak, the Cat of Dreams, Murphy, Kai&#x27;ckul, and Lord L&#x27;Zoril. He possesses three symbols of office: a helm, an amulet known as the Dreamstone, and a sand pouch.

A comics adaption of the above-mentioned German TV show &quot;Unser Sandmännchen&quot; has also been published. Most notably on the back pages of FF Dabei focusing on Pittiplatsch and his friends.

==Music==
Songs based on the figure of the Sandman include the 1950s classic &quot;Mr. Sandman&quot; by The Chordettes, Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;In Dreams&quot; in which the singer is put to sleep by &quot;a candy-colored clown they call the sandman&quot; to dream of his lost love, and Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; whose lyrics &quot;juxtapose childhood bedtime rituals and nightmarish imagery&quot; and originally included a reference to crib death. The Sandman also appears in the song &quot;Blood Red Sandman&quot; by Lordi, &quot;Mein Herz brennt&quot; by Rammstein, &quot;Dream Weaver&quot; by Sandman and Kids Music. &quot;Sandmann&quot; by Oomph!, &quot;Sandman&quot; by Manchester-based duo Hurts, the 1971 song &quot;Sandman&quot; by America and the version of the lullaby &quot;Morningtown Ride&quot; recorded by The Seekers and is mentioned briefly in the songs &quot;Headfirst Slide into Cooperstown on a Bad Bet&quot; by Fall Out Boy and &quot;Farewell and Goodnight&quot; from the Smashing Pumpkins album &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;. Ed Sheeran&#x27;s album &quot;= (Equals)&quot; contains a song name &quot;Sandman&quot; that refers to the sandman bringing magical dreams. Oranger also released a song titled &quot;Mr. Sandman&quot; with reference to the mythical character. In 2021 SYML record a song at St. Mark&#x27;s Cathedral called &quot;Mr. Sandman&quot;. American rapper ASAP Rocky released a song called Sandman on his 2021 re-release of his debut mixtape Live. Love. ASAP.

==Video games==

The sandman also appears as the main antagonist in the horror role-playing game The Sandman, the second installment of the Strange Man series by Uri. In the game, the sandman is a fairy who suffers from insomnia and so decides to put the whole world to sleep. Completing the game unlocks an extra story where the sandman is a playable character.

<text>In computing, the utility diff is a data comparison tool that computes and displays the differences between the contents of files. Unlike edit distance notions used for other purposes, diff is line-oriented rather than character-oriented, but it is like Levenshtein distance in that it tries to determine the smallest set of deletions and insertions to create one file from the other. The utility displays the changes in one of several standard formats, such that both humans or computers can parse the changes, and use them for patching.

Typically, &quot;diff&quot; is used to show the changes between two versions of the same file. Modern implementations also support binary files. The output is called a &quot;diff&quot;, or a patch, since the output can be applied with the Unix program . The output of similar file comparison utilities is also called a &quot;diff&quot;; like the use of the word &quot;grep&quot; for describing the act of searching, the word &quot;diff&quot; became a generic term for calculating data difference and the results thereof. The POSIX standard specifies the behavior of the &quot;diff&quot; and &quot;patch&quot; utilities and their file formats.

== History ==
diff was developed in the early 1970s on the Unix operating system, which was emerging from Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey. It was part of the 5th Edition of Unix released in 1974, and was written by Douglas McIlroy, and James Hunt. This research was published in a 1976 paper co-written with James W. Hunt, who developed an initial prototype of . The algorithm this paper described became known as the Hunt–Szymanski algorithm.

McIlroy&#x27;s work was preceded and influenced by Steve Johnson&#x27;s comparison program on GECOS and Mike Lesk&#x27;s program. also originated on Unix and, like , produced line-by-line changes and even used angle-brackets (&quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&quot;) for presenting line insertions and deletions in the program&#x27;s output. The heuristics used in these early applications were, however, deemed unreliable. The potential usefulness of a diff tool provoked McIlroy into researching and designing a more robust tool that could be used in a variety of tasks, but perform well in the processing and size limitations of the PDP-11&#x27;s hardware. His approach to the problem resulted from collaboration with individuals at Bell Labs including Alfred Aho, Elliot Pinson, Jeffrey Ullman, and Harold S. Stone.

In the context of Unix, the use of the  line editor provided with the natural ability to create machine-usable &quot;edit scripts&quot;. These edit scripts, when saved to a file, can, along with the original file, be reconstituted by into the modified file in its entirety. This greatly reduced the secondary storage necessary to maintain multiple versions of a file. McIlroy considered writing a post-processor for where a variety of output formats could be designed and implemented, but he found it more frugal and simpler to have be responsible for generating the syntax and reverse-order input accepted by the command.

In 1984, Larry Wall created a separate utility, patch,
releasing its source code on the &quot;mod.sources&quot; and &quot;net.sources&quot; newsgroups. This program modifies files using output from and has the ability to match context.

X/Open Portability Guide issue 2 of 1987 includes diff. Context mode was added in POSIX.1-2001 (issue 6). Unified mode was added in POSIX.1-2008 (issue 7).

In &#x27;s early years, common uses included comparing changes in the source of software code and markup for technical documents, verifying program debugging output, comparing filesystem listings and analyzing computer assembly code. The output targeted for was motivated to provide compression for a sequence of modifications made to a file. The Source Code Control System (SCCS) and its ability to archive revisions emerged in the late 1970s as a consequence of storing edit scripts from .

== Algorithm ==
The operation of is based on solving the longest common subsequence problem.

In this problem, given two sequences of items:

 h q 

 e i k r x y 

and we want to find a longest sequence of items that is present in both original sequences in the same order. That is, we want to find a new sequence which can be obtained from the first original sequence by deleting some items, and from the second original sequence by deleting other items. We also want this sequence to be as long as possible. In this case it is

 a b c d f g j z

From a longest common subsequence it is only a small step to get -like output: if an item is absent in the subsequence but present in the first original sequence, it must have been deleted (as indicated by the &#x27;-&#x27; marks, below). If it is absent in the subsequence but present in the second original sequence, it must have been inserted (as indicated by the &#x27;+&#x27; marks).

== Usage ==
The codice_1 command is invoked from the command line, passing it the names of two files: codice_2. The output of the command represents the changes required to transform the &quot;original&quot; file into the &quot;new&quot; file.

If &quot;original&quot; and &quot;new&quot; are directories, then will be run on each file that exists in both directories. An option, codice_3, will recursively descend any matching subdirectories to compare files between directories.

Any of the examples in the article use the following two files, &quot;original&quot; and &quot;new&quot;:

The command codice_4 produces the following &quot;normal diff output&quot;:
Note: &quot;Here, the diff output is shown with colors to make it easier to read. The diff utility does not produce colored output; its output is plain text. However, many tools can show the output with colors by using syntax highlighting.&quot;

In this traditional output format, &lt;samp&gt;a&lt;/samp&gt; stands for &quot;added&quot;, &lt;samp&gt;d&lt;/samp&gt; for &quot;deleted&quot; and &lt;samp&gt;c&lt;/samp&gt; for &quot;changed&quot;. Line numbers of the original file appear before &lt;samp&gt;a&lt;/samp&gt;/&lt;samp&gt;d&lt;/samp&gt;/&lt;samp&gt;c&lt;/samp&gt; and those of the new file appear after. The less-than and greater-than signs (at the beginning of lines that are added, deleted or changed) indicate which file the lines appear in. Addition lines are added to the original file to appear in the new file. Deletion lines are deleted from the original file to be missing in the new file.

By default, lines common to both files are not shown. Lines that have moved are shown as added at their new location and as deleted from their old location. However, some diff tools highlight moved lines.

== Output variations ==

=== Edit script ===
An ed script can still be generated by modern versions of diff with the codice_5 option. The resulting edit script for this example is as follows:

 &quot;This paragraph contains&quot;

 &quot;the beginning of this&quot;
 &quot;document!&quot;
 .

In order to transform the content of file &quot;original&quot; into the content of file &quot;new&quot; using , we should append two lines to this diff file, one line containing a codice_6 (write) command, and one containing a codice_7 (quit) command (e.g. by ). Here we gave the diff file the name &quot;mydiff&quot; and the transformation will then happen when we run .

=== Context format ===
The Berkeley distribution of Unix made a point of adding the &quot;context format&quot; () and the ability to recurse on filesystem directory structures (), adding those features in 2.8 BSD, released in July 1981. The context format of diff introduced at Berkeley helped with distributing patches for source code that may have been changed minimally.

In the context format, any changed lines are shown alongside unchanged lines before and after. The inclusion of any number of unchanged lines provides a &quot;context&quot; to the patch. The &quot;context&quot; consists of lines that have not changed between the two files and serve as a reference to locate the lines&#x27; place in a modified file and find the intended location for a change to be applied regardless of whether the line numbers still correspond. The context format introduces greater readability for humans and reliability when applying the patch, and an output which is accepted as input to the patch program. This intelligent behavior is not possible with the traditional diff output.

The number of unchanged lines shown above and below a change &quot;hunk&quot; can be defined by the user, even zero, but three lines is typically the default. If the context of unchanged lines in a hunk overlap with an adjacent hunk, then diff will avoid duplicating the unchanged lines and merge the hunks into a single hunk.

A &quot; represents a change between lines that correspond in the two files, whereas a &quot; represents the addition of a line, and a &quot;&quot; the removal of a line. A blank space represents an unchanged line. At the beginning of the patch is the file information, including the full path and a time stamp delimited by a tab character. At the beginning of each hunk are the line numbers that apply for the corresponding change in the files. A number range appearing between sets of three asterisks applies to the original file, while sets of three dashes apply to the new file. The hunk ranges specify the starting and ending line numbers in the respective file.

The command produces the following output:

*** /path/to/original timestamp
--- /path/to/new timestamp
*** 1,3 ****
--- 1,9 ----

Note: &quot;Here, the diff output is shown with colors to make it easier to read. The diff utility does not produce colored output; its output is plain text. However, many tools can show the output with colors by using syntax highlighting.&quot;

=== Unified format ===
The &quot;unified format&quot; (or &quot;unidiff&quot;) inherits the technical improvements made by the context format, but produces a smaller diff with old and new text presented immediately adjacent. Unified format is usually invoked using the &quot;codice_8&quot; command-line option. This output is often used as input to the patch program. Many projects specifically request that &quot;diffs&quot; be submitted in the unified format, making unified diff format the most common format for exchange between software developers.

Unified context diffs were originally developed by Wayne Davison in August 1990 (in unidiff which appeared in Volume 14 of comp.sources.misc). Richard Stallman added unified diff support to the GNU Project&#x27;s diff utility one month later, and the feature debuted in GNU diff 1.15, released in January 1991. GNU diff has since generalized the context format to allow arbitrary formatting of diffs.

The format starts with the same two-line header as the context format, except that the original file is preceded by &quot;&lt;samp&gt;---&lt;/samp&gt;&quot; and the new file is preceded by &quot;&lt;samp&gt;+++&lt;/samp&gt;&quot;. Following this are one or more change hunks that contain the line differences in the file. The unchanged, contextual lines are preceded by a space character, addition lines are preceded by a plus sign, and deletion lines are preceded by a minus sign.

A hunk begins with range information and is immediately followed with the line additions, line deletions, and any number of the contextual lines. The range information is surrounded by double at signs, and combines onto a single line what appears on two lines in the context format (above). The format of the range information line is as follows:

<text>Ecotourism is a form of nature-oriented tourism intended to contribute to the conservation of the natural environment, generally defined as being minimally impactful, and including providing both contributions to conservation and environmental education. The definition sometimes also includes being financially beneficial to the host community or making conservation financially possible. There are a range of different definitions, and the correct definition of the term was an active subject of debate as of 2009. The term is also used more widely by many organizations offering nature tourism, which do not focus on being beneficial to the environment.

Since the 1980s, ecotourism has been considered an important endeavor by environmentalists for conservation reasons. Organizations focusing on ecotourism often make direct or indirect contributions to conservation or employ practices or technology that reduce impacts on the environment. However (according to Buckley), very few organizations make a net-positive impact on the environment overall. Ecotourism has also been criticized for often using the same infrastructure and practices of regular tourism under a different name. Like most long-distance travel, ecotourism often depends on air transportation, which contributes to climate change.

Generally, ecotourism deals with interaction with living parts of natural environments, in contrast to geotourism, which is associated with geology. In contrast to nature tourism and sustainable tourism in general, ecotourism also usually intended to foster a greater appreciation in tourists of natural habitats and threats they experience, as well as local culture. Responsible ecotourism programs include those that minimize the negative aspects of conventional tourism on the environment and enhance the cultural integrity of local people. Therefore, in addition to evaluating environmental and cultural factors, an integral part of ecotourism is the promotion of recycling, energy efficiency, water conservation, and the creation of economic opportunities for local communities.

== Risks and benefits ==
Ecotourism is a sub-component of the field of sustainable tourism. Ecotourism must serve to maximize ecological benefits while contributing to the economic, social, and cultural wellbeing of communities living close to ecotourism venues.

Even while ecotourism is often presented as a responsible form of tourism, it nonetheless carries several risks. Potential ecological, economic, and sociocultural benefits associated with ecotourism are described below.

=== Ecological risk ===

Ecotourism activities, or merely the presence of travelers in a particular region or location, may negatively impact the ecological integrity of protected areas.

=== Risks to local communities ===

Local communities may be negatively impacted by ecotourism. For example, as is the case with other forms of tourism, ecotourism may result in friction between tourists and local community members, and may potentially increase the cost of rent, rates, and property values, thereby marginalizing local community members.

=== Health risks ===

Ecotourism carries known health risks for tourists and local community members, along with wildlife and ecosystems. Travelers may bring pathogens to ecologically sensitive areas, putting wildlife as well as local communities at risk. Ecotourism activities may also place travelers at risk of health problems or injuries.

=== Potential ecological benefits ===
Ecotourism may also have positive ecological consequences, and some of them are listed as follows:

==== Direct benefits ====

* Incentive to protect natural environments
* Incentive to rehabilitate modified environments and lands
* Provides funds to manage and expand protected areas
* Ecotourists assist with habitat maintenance and enhancement through their actions 
* Ecotourists serving as watchdogs or guardians who personally intervene in situations where the environment is perceived to be threatened
*The locals may also learn new skills from the ecotourists

==== Indirect benefits ====

* Exposure to ecotourism fosters a broader sense of environmentalism
* Communities experience changes in environmental attitude and behavior
* Areas protected for ecotourism provide environmental benefits
* It sharpens the future of well-being of the locals

=== Potential economic benefits ===
For some decision-makers, economic factors are more compelling than ecological factors in deciding how natural resources should be used. Potential ecotourism economic benefits are presented below:

==== Direct benefits ====

* Generates revenue (related to visitor expenditures) and creates employment that is directly related to the sector 
* Provides economic opportunities for peripheral regions

==== Indirect benefits ====

* High multiplier effect and indirect revenue employment
* Supports cultural and heritage tourism, sectors that are highly compatible with ecotourism.

=== Potential socio-cultural benefits ===
A holistic approach to ecotourism must promote socio-cultural as well as economic and ecological practices. The direct and indirect socio-cultural benefits are outlined as follows:

==== Direct and indirect benefits ====

* Foster community stability and well-being through economic benefits and local participation
* Aesthetic and spiritual benefits and enjoyment for locals and tourists
* Accessible to a broad spectrum of the population

When assessing the potential positive impacts of ecotourism, it is necessary to mention that ecotourism can have unintended negative effects as well. Negative impacts can be mitigated through regulations and codes of conduct that effectively and persuasively impart messages about appropriate visitor behavior.

== Terminology and history ==

Ecotourism is a late 20th-century neologism compounded and . According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, &quot;ecotour&quot; was first recorded in 1973 and &quot;ecotourism&quot;, &quot;probably after &quot;ecotour&quot;&quot;, in 1982.
*ecotour, &quot;n&quot;. ... A tour of or visit to an area of ecological interest, usually with an educational element; (in later use also) a similar tour or visit designed to have as little detrimental effect on the ecology as possible or undertaken with the specific aim of helping conservation efforts.
*ecotourism, &quot;n&quot;. ... Tourism to areas of ecological interest (typically exotic and often threatened natural environments), esp. to support conservation efforts and observe wildlife; spec. access to an endangered environment controlled to have the least possible adverse effect.

Some sources suggest the terms were used nearly a decade earlier. Claus-Dieter (Nick) Hetzer, an academic and adventurer from Forum International in Berkeley, CA, coined &quot;ecotourism&quot; in 1965, according to the Contra Costa Times, and ran the first &quot;ecotours&quot; in the Yucatán during the early 1970s.

The definition of ecotourism adopted by Ecotourism Australia is: &quot;Ecotourism is ecologically sustainable tourism with a primary focus on experiencing natural areas that foster environmental and cultural understanding, appreciation and conservation.&quot;

The Global Ecotourism Network (GEN) defines ecotourism as &quot;responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the well-being of the local people, and creates knowledge and understanding through interpretation and education of all involved (visitors, staff, and the visited)&quot;.

Ecotourism is often misinterpreted as any form of tourism that involves nature (see jungle tourism). Self-proclaimed practitioners and hosts of ecotourism experiences assume it is achieved by simply creating destinations in natural areas. According to critics of this commonplace and assumptive practice, true ecotourism must, above all, sensitize people to the beauty and fragility of nature. These critics condemn some operators as greenwashing their operations: using the labels of &quot;green&quot; and &quot;eco-friendly&quot;, while behaving in environmentally irresponsible ways.

Although academics disagree about who can be classified as an ecotourist and there is little statistical data, some estimate that more than five million ecotourists—the majority of the ecotourist population—come from the United States, with many others from Western Europe, Canada, and Australia.

Currently, there are various moves to create national and international ecotourism certification programs. National ecotourism certification programs have been put in place in countries such as Costa Rica, Australia, Kenya, Estonia, and Sweden.

== Improving sustainability ==
=== Principles ===
Ecotourism in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems can benefit conservation, provided the complexities of history, culture, and ecology in the affected regions are successfully navigated. Catherine Macdonald and colleagues identify the factors that determine conservation outcomes, namely whether: animals and their habits are sufficiently protected; conflict between people and wildlife is avoided or at least suitably mitigated; there is good outreach and education of the local population into the benefits of ecotourism; there is effective collaboration with stakeholders in the area; and there is proper use of the money generated by ecotourism to conserve the local ecology. They conclude that ecotourism works best to conserve predators when the tourism industry is supported both politically and by the public, and when it is monitored and controlled at local, national, and international levels.

=== Regulation and accreditation ===
Because the regulations of ecotourism may be poorly implemented, ecologically destructive greenwashed operations like underwater hotels and helicopter tours can be categorized as ecotourism along with canoeing, camping, photography, and wildlife observation. The failure to acknowledge responsible, low-impact ecotourism puts legitimate ecotourism companies at a competitive disadvantage.

Management strategies to mitigate destructive operations include but are not limited to establishing a carrying capacity, site hardening, sustainable design, visitation quotas, fees, access restrictions, and visitor education.

Many environmentalists have argued for a global standard that can be used for certification, differentiating ecotourism companies based on their level of environmental commitment, creating a standard to follow. A national or international regulatory board would enforce accreditation procedures, with representation from various groups including governments, hotels, tour operators, travel agents, guides, airlines, local authorities, conservation organizations, and non-governmental organizations. The decisions of the board would be sanctioned by governments so that non-compliant companies would be legally required to disassociate themselves from the use of the ecotourism brand.

In 1998, Crinion suggested a Green Stars System, based on criteria including a management plan, benefits for the local community, small group interaction, education value, and staff training. Ecotourists who consider their choices would be confident of a genuine ecotourism experience when they see the higher star rating.

In 2008 the Global Sustainable Tourism Council Criteria was launched at the IUCN World Conservation Congress. The Criteria, managed by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, created a global standard for sustainable travel and tourism and includes criteria and performance indicators for destinations, tour operators and hotels. The GSTC provides accreditation through a third party to Certification Bodies to legitimize claims of sustainability.

Environmental impact assessments could also be used as a form of accreditation. Feasibility is evaluated on a scientific basis, and recommendations could be made to optimally plan infrastructure, set tourist capacity, and manage the ecology. This form of accreditation is more sensitive to site-specific conditions.

Some countries have their certification programs for ecotourism. Costa Rica, for example, runs the GSTC-Recognized Certification of Sustainable Tourism (CST) program, which is intended to balance the effect that business has on the local environment. The CST program focuses on a company&#x27;s interaction with natural and cultural resources, the improvement of quality of life within local communities, and the economic contribution to other programs of national development. CST uses a rating system that categorizes a company based on how sustainable its operations are. CST evaluates the interaction between the company and the surrounding habitat; the management policies and operation systems within the company; how the company encourages its clients to become active contributors towards sustainable policies; and the interaction between the company and local communities/the overall population. Based upon these criteria, the company is evaluated for the strength of its sustainability. The measurement index goes from 0 to 5, with 0 being the worst and 5 being the best.

===Labels and certification===
Over 50 ecolabels on tourism exist. These include (but are not limited to):
* Austrian Ecolabel for Tourism
* Asian Ecotourism Standard for Accommodations (AESA)
* Eco-certification Malta
* EarthCheck 
* Ecotourism Australia
* Ecotourism Ireland
* Ecotourism Kenya
* European Ecotourism Labelling Standard (EETLS)
* Korean Ecotourism Standard

===Guidelines and education===
An environmental protection strategy must address the issue of ecotourists removed from the cause-and-effect of their actions on the environment. More initiatives should be carried out to improve their awareness, sensitize them to environmental issues, and care about the places they visit.

Tour guides are an obvious and direct medium to communicate awareness. With the confidence of ecotourists and intimate knowledge of the environment, tour guides can actively discuss conservation issues. Informing ecotourists about how their actions on the trip can negatively impact their environment and the local people. A tour guide training program in Costa Rica&#x27;s Tortuguero National Park has helped mitigate negative environmental impacts by providing information and regulating tourists on the parks&#x27; beaches used by nesting endangered sea turtles.

===Small scale, slow growth, and local control===
The underdevelopment theory of tourism describes a new form of imperialism by multinational corporations that control ecotourism resources. These corporations finance and profit from the development of large-scale ecotourism that causes excessive environmental degradation, loss of traditional culture and way of life, and exploitation of local labor. In Zimbabwe and Nepal&#x27;s Annapurna region, where underdevelopment is taking place, more than 90 percent of ecotourism revenues are expatriated to the parent countries, and less than 5 percent go into local communities.

The lack of sustainability highlights the need for small-scale, slow-growth, and locally-based ecotourism. Local peoples have a vested interest in the well-being of their community and are therefore more accountable to environmental protection than multinational corporations, though they receive very little of the profits. The lack of control, westernization, adverse impacts to the environment, and loss of culture and traditions outweigh the benefits of establishing large-scale ecotourism. Additionally, culture loss can be attributed to cultural commodification, in which local cultures are commodified to make a profit.

The increased contributions of communities to locally managed ecotourism create viable economic opportunities, including high-level management positions, and reduce environmental issues associated with poverty and unemployment. Because the ecotourism experience is marketed to a different lifestyle from large-scale ecotourism, the development of facilities and infrastructure does not need to conform to corporate Western tourism standards, and can be much simpler and less expensive. There is a greater multiplier effect on the economy, because local products, materials, and labor are used. Profits accrue locally and import leakages are reduced. The Great Barrier Reef Park in Australia reported over half of a billion dollars of indirect income in the area and added thousands of indirect jobs between 2004 and 2005. However, even this form of tourism may require foreign investment for promotion or start-up. When such investments are required, communities must find a company or non-governmental organization that reflects the philosophy of ecotourism; is sensitive to their concerns, and is willing to cooperate at the expense of profit. The basic assumption of the multiplier effect is that the economy starts with unused resources, for example, that many workers are cyclically unemployed and much of industrial capacity is sitting idle or incompletely used. By increasing demand in the economy, it is then possible to boost production. If the economy was already at full employment, with only structural, frictional, or other supply-side types of unemployment, any attempt to boost demand would only lead to inflation. For various laissez-faire schools of economics which embrace Say&#x27;s law and deny the possibility of Keynesian inefficiency and under-employment of resources, therefore, the multiplier concept is irrelevant or wrong-headed.

As an example, consider the government increasing its expenditure on roads by $1  million, without a corresponding increase in taxation. This sum would go to the road builders, who would hire more workers and distribute the money as wages and profits. The households receiving these incomes will save part of the money and spend the rest on consumer goods. These expenditures, in turn, will generate more jobs, wages, profits, and so on with the income and spending circulating the economy.

The multiplier effect arises because of the induced increases in consumer spending which occur due to the increased incomes – and because of the feedback into increasing business revenues, jobs, and income again. This process does not lead to an economic explosion not only because of the supply-side barriers at potential output (full employment) but because at each &quot;round&quot;, the increase in consumer spending is less than the increase in consumer incomes. That is, the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is less than one so that each round some extra income goes into saving, leaking out of the cumulative process. Each increase in spending is thus smaller than that of the previous round, preventing an explosion.

=== Efforts to preserve ecosystems at risk ===
Some of the world&#x27;s most exceptional biodiversity is located in the Galapagos Islands. These islands were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979, then added to UNESCO&#x27;s List of World Heritage in Danger in 2007. IGTOA is a non-profit dedicated to preserving this unique living laboratory against the challenges of invasive species, human impact, and tourism. For travelers who want to be mindful of the environment and the impact of tourism, it is recommended to use an operator that is endorsed by a reputable ecotourism organization. In the case of the Galapagos, IGTOA has a list of the world&#x27;s premiere Galapagos Islands tour companies dedicated to the lasting protection and preservation of the destination.

== Natural resource management ==
Natural resource management can be used as a specialized tool for the development of ecotourism. There are several places throughout the world where several natural resources are abundant, but with human encroachment and habitats, these resources are depleting. Without the sustainable use of certain resources, they are destroyed, and floral and fauna species are becoming extinct. Ecotourism programs can be introduced for the conservation of these resources. Several plans and proper management programs can be introduced so that these resources remain untouched, and there are many organizations–including nonprofits–and scientists working on this field.

Natural resources of hill areas like Kurseong in West Bengal are plenty in number with various flora and fauna, but tourism for business purpose poised the situation. Researchers from Jadavpur University are presently working in this area for the development of ecotourism to be used as a tool for natural resource management.

In Southeast Asia government and nongovernmental organizations are working together with academics and industry operators to spread the economic benefits of tourism into the kampungs and villages of the region. A recently formed alliance, the South-East Asian Tourism Organization (SEATO), is bringing together these diverse players to discuss resource management concerns.

A 2002, summit held in Quebec led to the 2008 Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria–a collaborative effort between the UN Foundation and other advocacy groups. The criteria, which are voluntary, involve the following standards: &quot;effective sustainability planning, maximum social and economic benefits for local communities, minimum negative impacts on cultural heritage, and minimum negative impacts on the environment.&quot;There is no enforcing agency or system of punishments for summit.

== Impact on indigenous people and indigenous land ==
Valorization of the Indigenous territories can be important for designation as a protected area, which can deter threats such as deforestation. Ecotourism can help bring in revenue for Indigenous peoples.

However, there needs to be a proper business plan and organizational structure, which helps to ensure that the generated money from ecotourism indeed flows towards the Indigenous peoples themselves, and the protection of the Indigenous territory. Debates around ecotourism focus on how profits off of Indigenous lands are enjoyed by international tourist companies, who do not share back with the people to whom those lands belong. Ecotourism offers a tourist-appealing experience of the landscape and environment, one that is different from the experience of the residents; it commodifies the lives of Indigenous people and their land which is not fair to its inhabitants.

Indigenous territories are managed by governmental services (i.e. FUNAI in Brazil, ...) and these governmental services can thus decide whether or not to implement ecotourism in these Indigenous territories.

Ecotourism can also bring in employment to the local people (which may be Indigenous people). Protected areas for instance require park rangers, and staff to maintain and operate the ecolodges and accommodation used by tourists. Also, the traditional culture can act as a tourist attraction, and can create a source of revenue by asking payment for the showing of performances (i.e., traditional dance, ...) Ecotourism can also help mitigate deforestation that happens when local residents, under economic stress, clear lands and create smallholder plots to grow cash crops. Such land clearing hurts the environment. Ecotourism can be a sustainable and job-creating alternative for local populations.

Depending on how protected areas are set up and handled, it can lead to local people losing their homes, usually with no compensation. Pushing people onto marginal lands with harsh climates, poor soils, lack of water, and infested with livestock and disease does little to enhance livelihoods even when a proportion of ecotourism profits are directed back into the community. Harsh survival realities and deprivation of traditional use of land and natural resources by local people can occur. Local Indigenous people may also feel strong resentment towards the change, especially if tourism has been allowed to develop with virtually no controls. Without sufficient control mechanisms, too many lodges may be built, and tourist vehicles may drive off-track and harass the wildlife. Vehicle use may erode and degrade the land&quot;.

There is a longstanding failure by the Peruvian government to acknowledge and protect Indigenous lands, and therefore the Indigenous peoples have been forced to protect their own land. The land has a better chance of staying safe and free from deforestation if the people who care about the land are the ones maintaining it.

==Criticism==

===Definition===
In the continuum of tourism activities that stretch from conventional tourism to ecotourism, there has been a lot of contention to the limit at which biodiversity preservation, local social-economic benefits, and environmental impact can be considered &quot;ecotourism&quot;. For this reason, environmentalists, special interest groups, and governments define ecotourism differently. Environmental organizations have generally insisted that ecotourism is nature-based, sustainably managed, conservation supporting, and environmentally educated. The tourist industry and governments, however, focus more on the product aspect, treating ecotourism as equivalent to any sort of tourism based in nature. As a further complication, many terms are used under the rubric of ecotourism. Nature tourism, low impact tourism, green tourism, bio-tourism, ecologically responsible tourism, and others have been used in literature and marketing, although they are not necessarily synonymous with ecotourism.

The problems associated with defining ecotourism have often led to confusion among tourists and academics. Many problems are also subject of considerable public controversy and concern because of green washing, a trend towards the commercialization of tourism schemes disguised as sustainable, nature based, and environmentally friendly ecotourism. According to McLaren, these schemes are environmentally destructive, economically exploitative, and culturally insensitive at its worst. They are also morally disconcerting because they mislead tourists and manipulate their concerns for the environment. The development and success of such large scale, energy intensive, and ecologically unsustainable schemes are a testament to the tremendous profits associated with being labeled as ecotourism.

=== Negative impact ===
Ecotourism has become one of the fastest-growing sectors of the tourism industry. One definition of ecotourism is &quot;the practice of low-impact, educational, ecologically and culturally sensitive travel that benefits local communities and host countries&quot;. Many of the ecotourism projects are not meeting these standards. Even if some of the guidelines are being executed, the local communities are still facing many of the negative impacts.The other negative side of ecotourism is that it transforms nature and the environment into commodities people are interested in paying and visiting. When the environment becomes a product with economic value, people try to advertise and sell it. Some of the ecotourism sites are turning to private sectors, and the government cut off their funding. Hence, they are obligated to make money on their own. Private natural parks and sites are looking for their own advantage by advertising the soundness of natural parks or coastal marines in the Caribbean. They try to show they are protecting nature and attract people interested in ecotourism. However, they will focus on the phenomenon that might be more interesting for tourists and neglect other aspects of nature when they prioritize their profits. Consequently, this policy will result in abandoning rich ecological sites or destroying those valuable sites. For example, in Montego Bay, hotel staff cut the seagrass that appeared to drive back tourists; conversely, they are crucial for local nutrient cycles.

The other problem is that the companies try to hide the truth behind the ecotourism to maintain their profit. They do not cover the fact that traveling from other countries to the natural sites burns extensive amounts of aircraft fuel. In Montego Bay and Negril, a considerable amount of run-off is released to the coastal water produced directly or indirectly by ecotourists. Hotels in Jamaica release much more wastewater than a city. The tourists generate a lot of waste that ends up in the coastal water. The indirect effect of ecotourism in Jamaica is that many people migrated to the town near the natural site because of the more job opportunities due to construction increase, resulting in destroying the environment. South Africa is one of the countries that is reaping significant economic benefits from ecotourism, but the negative effects far outweigh the positive—including forcing people to leave their homes, gross violations of fundamental rights, and environmental hazards—far outweigh the medium-term economic benefits. A tremendous amount of money and human resources continue to be used for ecotourism despite unsuccessful outcomes, and even more, money is put into public relation campaigns to dilute the effects of criticism. Ecotourism channels resources away from other projects that could contribute more sustainable and realistic solutions to pressing social and environmental problems. &quot;The money tourism can generate often ties parks and managements to ecotourism&quot;. But there is a tension in this relationship because ecotourism often causes conflict and changes in land-use rights, fails to deliver promises of community-level benefits, damages environments, and has many other social impacts. Indeed, many argue repeatedly that ecotourism is neither ecologically nor socially beneficial, yet it persists as a strategy for conservation and development due to the large profits. While several studies are being done on ways to improve the ecotourism structure, some argue that these examples provide a rationale for stopping it altogether. However, there are some positive examples, among them the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA) and the Virunga National Park, as judged by WWF.

The ecotourism system exercises tremendous financial and political influence. The evidence above shows that a strong case exists for restraining such activities in certain locations. Funding could be used for field studies aimed at finding alternative solutions to tourism and the diverse problems Africa faces in result of urbanization, industrialization, and the overexploitation of agriculture.

At the local level, ecotourism has become a source of conflict over control of land, resources, and tourism profits. In this case, ecotourism has harmed the environment and local people and has led to conflicts over profit distribution. Very few regulations or laws stand in place as boundaries for the investors in ecotourism. Calls have been made for more efforts toward educating tourists of the environmental and social effects of their travels, and for laws to prohibit the promotion of unsustainable ecotourism projects and materials which project false images of destinations and demean local and Indigenous cultures.

Though conservation efforts in East Africa are indisputably serving the interests of tourism in the region it is important to make the distinction between conservation acts and the tourism industry. Eastern African communities are not the only of developing regions to experience economic and social harms from conservation efforts. Conservation in the Southwest Yunnan Region of China has similarly brought drastic changes to traditional land use in the region. Prior to logging restrictions imposed by the Chinese Government the industry made up 80 percent of the regions revenue. Following a complete ban on commercial logging the Indigenous people of the Yunnan region now see little opportunity for economic development. Ecotourism may provide solutions to the economic hardships suffered from the loss of industry to conservation in the Yunnan in the same way that it may serve to remedy the difficulties faced by the Maasai. As stated, the ecotourism structure must be improved to direct more money into host communities by reducing leakages for the industry to be successful in alleviating poverty in developing regions, but it provides a promising opportunity.

Drumm and Moore (2002) discuss the price increase and economic leakage in their paper; saying that prices might augment since the visitors are more capable to pay higher rates for goods and services in opposition to the locals. Also, they have mentioned two solutions regarding the previous issue: (1) either a two pricing system represented as two separate price lists (the first for the locals and the second for the tourists with respect to the local&#x27;s purchase power ability); (2) design unique goods and services subject only or the tourists&#x27; consumption. Leakage appears when international investors import foreign products instead of using local resources; thus, the tourists will be using international products and in-turn contributing to the outside economy rather than the local one (Drumm &amp; Moore, 2002).

=== Direct environmental impacts ===
Ecotourism operations occasionally fail to live up to conservation ideals. It is sometimes overlooked that ecotourism is a highly consumer-centered activity, and that environmental conservation is a means to further economic growth.

Although ecotourism is intended for small groups, even a modest increase in population, however temporary, puts extra pressure on the local environment and necessitates the development of additional infrastructure and amenities. The construction of water treatment plants, sanitation facilities, and lodges come with the exploitation of non-renewable energy sources and the use of already limited local resources. The conversion of natural land to such tourist infrastructure is implicated in deforestation and habitat deterioration of butterflies in Mexico and squirrel monkeys in Costa Rica. In other cases, the environment suffers because local communities are unable to meet the infrastructure demands of ecotourism. The lack of adequate sanitation facilities in many East African parks results in the disposal of campsite sewage in rivers, contaminating the wildlife, livestock, and people who draw drinking water from it.

Aside from environmental degradation with tourist infrastructure, population pressures from ecotourism also leaves behind garbage and pollution associated with the Western lifestyle. An example of this is seen with ecotourism in Antarctica. Since it is such a remote location, it takes a lot of fuel to get there; resulting in ships producing large pollution through waste disposal and green house gas emissions. Additionally, there is a potential for oil spills from damaged ships traversing through aggressive waters filled with natural obstacles such as icebergs. Although ecotourists claim to be educationally sophisticated and environmentally concerned, they rarely understand the ecological consequences of their visits and how their day-to-day activities append physical impacts on the environment. As one scientist observes, they &quot;rarely acknowledge how the meals they eat, the toilets they flush, the water they drink, and so on, are all part of broader regional economic and ecological systems they are helping to reconfigure with their very activities.&quot; Nor do ecotourists recognize the great consumption of non-renewable energy required to arrive at their destination, which is typically more remote than conventional tourism destinations. For instance, an exotic journey to a place 10,000 kilometers away consumes about 700 liters of fuel per person.

Ecotourism activities are, in and of themselves, issues in environmental impact because they may disturb fauna and flora. Ecotourists believe that because they are only taking pictures and leaving footprints, they keep ecotourism sites pristine, but even harmless-sounding activities such as nature hikes can be ecologically destructive. In the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal, ecotourists have worn down the marked trails and created alternate routes, contributing to soil impaction, erosion, and plant damage. Where the ecotourism activity involves wildlife viewing, it can scare away animals, disrupt their feeding and nesting sites, or acclimate them to the presence of people. In Kenya, wildlife-observer disruption drives cheetahs off their reserves, increasing the risk of inbreeding and further endangering the species. In a study done from 1995 to 1997 off the Northwestern coast of Australia, scientists found that whale sharks&#x27; tolerance for divers and swimmers decreased. The whale sharks showed an increase in behaviors over the course of the study, such as diving, porpoising, banking, and eye rolling that are associated with distress and attempt to avoid the diver. The average time the whale sharks spent with the divers in 1995 was 19.3 minutes, but in 1997 the average time the whale sharks spent with the divers was 9.5 minutes. There was also an increase in recorded behaviors from 56% of the sharks showing any sort of diving, porpoising, eye rolling or banking in 1995 to 70.7% in 1997. Some whale sharks were also observed to have scars that were consistent with being struck by a boat.

=== Environmental hazards ===
The industrialization, urbanization and agricultural practices of human society are having a serious impact on the environment. Ecotourism is now also considered to be playing a role in environmental depletion including deforestation, disruption of ecological life systems and various forms of pollution, all of which contribute to environmental degradation. For example, the number of motor vehicles crossing a park increases as tour drivers search for rare species. The number of roads disrupts the grass cover, which has serious consequences on plant and animal species. These areas also have a higher rate of disturbances and invasive species due to increasing traffic off of the beaten path into new, undiscovered areas. Ecotourism also has an effect on species through the value placed on them. &quot;Certain species have gone from being little known or valued by local people to being highly valued commodities. The commodification of plants may erase their social value and lead to overproduction within protected areas. Local people and their images can also be turned into commodities&quot;. Kamuaro points out the relatively obvious contradiction that any commercial venture into unspoiled, pristine land inevitably means a higher pressure on the environment. The people who live in the areas now becoming ecotourism spots have very different lifestyles than those who come to visit. Ecotourism has created many debates based on if the economic benefits are worth the possible environmental sacrifices.

=== Who benefits? ===
Most forms of ecotourism are owned by foreign investors and corporations that provide few benefits to the local people. An overwhelming majority of profits are put into the pockets of investors instead of reinvestment into the local economy or environmental protection leading to further environmental degradation. The limited numbers of local people who are employed in the economy enter at its lowest level and are unable to live in tourist areas because of meager wages and a two-market system.

In some cases, the resentment by local people results in environmental degradation. As a highly publicized case, the Maasai nomads in Kenya killed wildlife in national parks but are now helping the national park to save the wildlife to show aversion to unfair compensation terms and displacement from traditional lands. The lack of economic opportunities for local people also constrains them to degrade the environment as a means of sustenance. The presence of affluent ecotourists encourage the development of destructive markets in wildlife souvenirs, such as the sale of coral trinkets on tropical islands and animal products in Asia, contributing to illegal harvesting and poaching from the environment. In Suriname, sea turtle reserves use a very large portion of their budget to guard against these destructive activities.

=== Eviction of Indigenous peoples ===

Fortress conservation is a conservation model based on the belief that biodiversity protection is best achieved by creating protected areas where ecosystems can function in isolation from human disturbance. It is argued that money generated from ecotourism is the motivating factor to drive Indigenous inhabitants off the land. Up to 250,000 people worldwide have been forcibly evicted from their homes to make way for conservation projects since 1990, according to the UN special rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous peoples.

=== Mismanagement by government ===
While governments are typically entrusted with the administration and enforcement of environmental protection, they often lack the commitment or capability to manage ecotourism sites. The regulations for environmental protection may be vaguely defined, costly to implement, hard to enforce, and uncertain in effectiveness. Government regulatory agencies, are susceptible to making decisions that spend on politically beneficial but environmentally unproductive projects. Because of prestige and conspicuousness, the construction of an attractive visitor center at an ecotourism site may take precedence over more pressing environmental concerns like acquiring habitat, protecting endemic species, and removing invasive ones. Finally, influential groups can pressure, and sway the interests of the government to their favor. The government and its regulators can become vested in the benefits of the ecotourism industry which they are supposed to regulate, causing restrictive environmental regulations and enforcement to become more lenient.

Management of ecotourism sites by private ecotourism companies offers an alternative to the cost of regulation and deficiency of government agencies. It is believed that these companies have a self-interest in limited environmental degradation because tourists will pay more for pristine environments, which translates to higher profit. However, theory indicates that this practice is not economically feasible and will fail to manage the environment.

The model of monopolistic competition states that distinctiveness will entail profits, but profits will promote imitation. A company that protects its ecotourism sites is able to charge a premium for the novel experience and pristine environment. But when other companies view the success of this approach, they also enter the market with similar practices, increasing competition and reducing demand. Eventually, the demand will be reduced until the economic profit is zero. A cost-benefit analysis shows that the company bears the cost of environmental protection without receiving the gains. Without economic incentive, the whole premise of self-interest through environmental protection is quashed; instead, ecotourism companies will minimize environment related expenses and maximize tourism demand.

The tragedy of the commons offers another model for economic unsustainability from environmental protection, in ecotourism sites used by many companies. Although there is a communal incentive to protect the environment, maximizing the benefits in the long run, a company will conclude that it is in their best interest to use the ecotourism site beyond its sustainable level. By increasing the number of ecotourists, for instance, a company gains all the economic benefit while paying only a part of the environmental cost. In the same way, a company recognizes that there is no incentive to actively protect the environment; they bear all the costs, while the benefits are shared by all other companies. The result, again, is mismanagement.

Taken together, the mobility of foreign investment and lack of economic incentive for environmental protection means that ecotourism companies are disposed to establishing themselves in new sites once their existing one is sufficiently degraded.

In addition, the systematic literature review conducted by Cabral and Dhar (2019) have identified several challenges due to slow progression of ecotourism initiatives such as (a) economic leakages, (b) lack of government involvement, (c) skill deficiency among the local communities, (d) absence of disseminating environmental education, (e) sporadic increase in pollution, (f) conflict between tourism management personnel and local communities and (g) inadequate infrastructure development.

=== Case studies ===
The purpose of ecotourism is to engage tourists in low impact, non-consumptive and locally oriented environments to maintain species and habitats – especially in underdeveloped regions. While some ecotourism projects, including some found in the United States, can support such claims, many projects have failed to address some of the fundamental issues that nations face in the first place. Consequently, ecotourism may not generate the very benefits it is intended to provide to these regions and their people, and in some cases leaving economies in a state worse than before.

The following case studies illustrate the rising complexity of ecotourism and its impacts, both positive and negative, on the environment and economies of various regions in the world.

<text>A dog breed is a particular type of dog that was purposefully bred by humans to perform specific tasks, such as herding, hunting, and guarding. Dogs are the most variable mammal on Earth, with artificial selection producing upward of 360 globally recognized breeds. These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size and shape, tail phenotype, fur type, etc, but are only one species of dog. Their behavioral traits include guarding, herding, and hunting, and personality traits such as hyper-social behavior, boldness, and aggression. Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years. As a result of their adaptability to many environments and breedability for human needs, today dogs are the most abundant carnivore species and are dispersed around the world.

A dog breed will consistently produce the physical traits, movement and temperament that were developed over decades of selective breeding. For each breed they recognize, kennel clubs and breed registries usually maintain and publish a breed standard which is a written description of the ideal specimen of the breed. Other uses of the term &quot;breed&quot; when referring to dogs include pure breeds, cross-breeds, mixed breeds and natural breeds. 

Prior to the standardization of dog breeds, there were many different types of dogs that were defined by their own, unique functions. Many different terms were used to describe dogs, such as breed, strain, type, kind, and variety. By the end of the Victorian era, society had changed and so did the role of dogs. The form was given a more prominent role than function. Different types or breeds of dog were being developed by breeders who wanted to define specific characteristics and desirable features in their dogs. Driven by dog shows and the groups that hosted them, the term dog breed took on an entirely new meaning. Dog show competitions included best-in-breed winners, and the purebreds were winning. Breed standards are the reason the breed came to be, and with those standards are key features, including form, function and fitness for purpose. The Kennel Club in the UK was founded in 1873, and was the world&#x27;s first national kennel club and breed registry. The International Canine Federation was founded in 1911 as a worldwide organization. Its objective is to bring global uniformity to the breeding, exhibiting and judging of pure-bred dogs. It now has 99 member countries. According to BigThink, over 40% of the world’s dog breeds come from the United Kingdom, France and Germany. It states: &quot;Great Britain and France are the ground zero of dog fancying, with 57 registered breeds each. Germany is not far behind, with 47 breeds. These three countries alone represent more than 40% of all dog breeds recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.&quot;

==First dog breeds==


In 2017, a study showed that 9,000 years ago the domestic dog was present at what is now Zhokhov Island, arctic north-eastern Siberia, which was connected to the mainland at that time. The dogs were selectively bred as either sled dogs or as hunting dogs, which implies that a sled dog standard and a hunting dog standard existed at that time. The optimal maximum size for a sled dog is based on thermo-regulation, and the ancient sled dogs were between . The same standard has been found in the remains of sled dogs from this region 2,000 years ago and in the modern Siberian Husky breed standard. Other dogs were larger at and appear to be dogs that had been crossed with wolves and used for polar-bear hunting.

Between 3,000 and 4,000 years ago greyhound-types of dogs were depicted on pottery and paintings in Egypt and Western Asia. Mastiff-type dogs were kept for guarding and hunting, and short-legged dogs were also bred. Most modern dog breeds are the products of the controlled breeding practices of the Victorian era (1830–1900), and the accurate documenting of pedigrees with the establishment of the English Kennel Club in 1873 in imitation of other stud book registries for cattle and horses.

==Genetic evidence==
The domestic dog is the first species, and the only large carnivore, to have been domesticated. The first dogs were certainly wolflike, but the phenotypic changes that coincided with the dog–wolf genetic divergence are not known. Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally recognized dog breeds. In the Victorian era, directed human selection developed the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes. Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years, and since then dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and were formed into today&#x27;s modern breeds due to artificial selection imposed by humans. These breeds can vary in size and weight from a teacup poodle to a giant mastiff. The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type and colour. The difference in size has been attributed to a lncRNA variant in the IGF1 region arisen in wolves from northern latitudes c. 53.000 years ago and fixed by natural and subsequently by human selection. Their behavioral traits include guarding, herding, and hunting, retrieving, and scent detection. Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression, which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs. As a result, today dogs are the most abundant carnivore species and are dispersed around the world. The most striking example of this dispersal is that of the numerous modern breeds of European lineage during the Victorian era.

A genetic study identified 51 regions of the dog genome which were associated with phenotype variation among breeds in the 57 traits studied, which included body, cranial, dental, and long bone shape and size. There were three quantitative trait loci that explained most of the phenotype variation. Indicators of recent selection were shown by many of the 51 genomic regions that were associated with traits that define a breed, which include body size, coat characteristics, and ear floppiness.

===Ancient dog breeds===
&quot;Ancient breed&quot; is a term formerly, but no longer, used for a particular group of dog breeds by the American Kennel Club. These breeds were referred to as &quot;ancient&quot;, as opposed to modern, breeds because historically it was believed their origins dated back more than 500 years. 

In 2004, a study looked at the microsatellites of 414 purebred dogs representing 85 breeds. The study found that dog breeds were so genetically distinct that 99% of individual dogs could be correctly assigned to their breed based on their genotype, indicating that breeding barriers (purebred breeding) have led to distinct genetic units. The study identified 9 breeds that could be represented on the branches of a phylogenetic tree which grouped together with strong statistical support and could be separated from the other breeds with a modern European origin. These 9 breeds had been referred to as &quot;ancient breeds&quot;. The study found that the Pharaoh Hound and Ibizan Hound were not as old as once believed; rather, they had been recreated from combinations of other breeds, and that the Norwegian Elkhound grouped with the other European dogs despite reports of direct Scandinavian origins dating back 5,000 years.

===Dog types===


Dog types are broad categories of dogs based on form, function or style of work, lineage, or appearance. In contrast, modern dog breeds are particular breed standards, sharing a common set of heritable characteristics, determined by the kennel club that recognizes the breed. 

The spread of modern dog breeds has been difficult to resolve because many are the product of the controlled breeding practices of the Victorian era (1830–1900). In 2010, a study looked at 48,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms that gave a genome-wide coverage of 912 dogs representing 85 breeds.

The study found distinct genetic clusters within modern dogs that largely corresponded to phenotype or function. These included spitz-breeds, toy dogs, spaniels, Mastiff-like breeds, small terriers, retrievers, herding dogs, scent-hounds, and sight-hounds. There were 17 breeds that conflicted with phenotype or function and these were thought to be the result of crossing some of the other phenotypes. As in a 2004 study that found 9 &#x27;ancient breeds&#x27; to be genetically divergent, the study found 13 breeds that were genetically divergent from the modern breeds: the Basenji, Saluki, Afghan hound, Samoyed, Canaan dog, New Guinea singing dog, dingo, Chow Chow, Chinese Shar Pei, Akita, Alaskan malamute, Siberian husky and American Eskimo dog.

The study found that there were three well-supported groups that were highly divergent and distinct from modern domestic dogs. 
*an &quot;Asian group&quot; (Dingo, New Guinea singing dog, chow chow, Akita and Shar Pei)
*a &quot;Middle Eastern&quot; group (Afghan hound and Saluki)
*a &quot;northern group&quot; (Alaskan Malamute and Siberian Husky).
The earliest books in the English language to mention numbers of dog types are from the &quot;Cynegetica&quot; (hunting literature), namely, &quot;The Art of Venery&quot; (1327) by Twiti (Twici), a treatise that describes hunting with the limer (a leashed bloodhound type); the pack of &quot;running hounds&quot;, which included &quot;barcelets&quot; and &quot;brachetz&quot; (both scent hounds); and the sighthound and greyhound. More significant in recording the use and description of various dog types is &quot;The Master of Game&quot; (circa 1406) by Edward of York, a treatise that describes dogs and their work, such as the alaunt, greyhound, pack scent hounds, spaniel, and mastiff, used by the privileged and wealthy for hunting purposes. &quot;The Master of Game&quot; is a combination of the earlier &quot;Art of Venery&quot; and the French hunting treatise &quot;Livre de Chasse&quot; by Gaston Phoebus (circa 1387). &quot;The Book of Saint Albans&quot;, published in 1486, a &quot;school&quot; book about hawking, hunting, fishing, and heraldry, attributed to Juliana Berners (Barnes), lists dogs of the time mainly by function: &quot;First there is a greyhound, a bastard, a mongrel, a mastiff, a limer, a spaniel, &quot;raches&quot; (small-to-medium-sized scenthounds), &quot;kennets&quot; (small hunting dogs), terriers, &quot;butcher&#x27;s hounds&quot;, dung-heap dogs, &quot;trundel tails&quot; (lapdogs?) and prick-eared curs, and small ladies puppies that bear away the fleas and diverse small sorts.&quot;

===Basal breeds===
A study in 2012 examined 49,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms that gave a genome-wide coverage of 1,375 dogs representing 35 breeds, 19 wolves, and previous published genetic signatures of other breeds, giving a total of 121 breeds covered. The study found a deep genetic split between old-world and new-world wolves, and confirmed the genetic divergence of 13 breeds from a 2010 study (Afghan Hound, Akita, Alaskan Malamute, American Eskimo, Basenji, Canaan dog, Chow Chow, Dingo, New Guinea singing dog, Saluki, Samoyed, Shar-Pei, Siberian Husky), plus another three: the Eurasier, Finnish Spitz and Shiba Inu. The study referred to these 16 as basal breeds, as opposed to ancient breeds, as they exhibited genetic divergence but not all of them were historically considered to be &quot;ancient breeds&quot;.

The 2012 study found that modern breeds only emerged in the 19th century and that claims of their antiquity are based on little or no historical or empirical evidence. The study indicated that throughout history, global dog populations experienced numerous episodes of diversification and homogenization, with each round further reducing the power of genetic data derived from modern breeds to help infer their early history.

Of the basal breeds, the American Eskimo Dog and Eurasier were the very recent product of cross-breeding other basal breeds. Most basal breeds have hybridized with other lineages in the past. If those other lineages were other basal breeds then a basal genetic signature remains. The combination of introgression and past population bottlenecks suggested that basal breeds have little or no genetic connections to their ancestral populations and that their genetic distinctiveness does not signify ancient heritage. They are distinctive from the modern breeds because the genetic heritage of the modern breeds has become blurred due to admixture, and the basal breeds have mostly avoided admixture with them due to geographic or cultural barriers.

===Medical research===
As dogs are a subspecies but their breeds are distinct genetic units, and because only certain breeds share the same type of cancers as humans, the differences in the genes of different breeds may be useful in human medical research.

===Breed temperament===
In 2014, a study indicated that some breed-temperaments, such as anxiety or fear, may be linked to gene mutations. Other temperaments may be due to the legacies of &#x27;ancient&#x27; ancestry.

==Breeds==

===Pure breeds===
====Kennel clubs====
Groups of owners that have dogs of the same breed and have an interest in dog breeding can form national Kennel clubs. Kennel Clubs maintain breed standards, record pedigrees in a breed registry (or studbook), and issue the rules for conformation dog shows and trials and accreditation of judges. They often serve as registries, which are lists of adult purebred dogs and lists of litters of puppies born to purebred parents.

A dog breed is represented by a sufficient number of individuals to stably transfer its specific characteristics over generations. Dogs of same breed have similar characteristics of appearance and behavior, primarily because they come from a select set of ancestors who had the same characteristics. Dogs of a specific breed breed true, producing young that are very similar to their parents. An individual dog is identified as a member of a breed through proof of ancestry, using genetic analysis or written records of ancestry. Without such proof, identification of a specific breed is not reliable. Such records, called stud books, may be maintained by individuals, clubs, or other organizations.

Kennel clubs provide the recognition of distinct dog breeds, but there are many independent clubs with differing, and sometimes inconsistent standards and they need not apply scientific standards. Four varieties of the Belgian Shepherd Dog are recognised as four distinct breeds by the New Zealand Kennel Club. Further, some groups of dogs which clearly share a persistent set of characteristics and documented descent from a known foundation stock may still not be recognized by some clubs as breeds. For instance, the feist is a hunting dog raised in the Southern United States for hunting small game. Feists have a consistent set of characteristics that reliably differentiate them from other dog types and breeds. However, the United Kennel Club recognizes one breed of feist, the Treeing Feist, while the American Kennel Club does not recognize any feist breed.

A dog is said to be purebred if their parents were purebred and if the dog meets the standards of the breed. The American Kennel Club allows mixed-breed dogs to be shown but under the condition the animals have been spayed or neutered, are not a wolf hybrid, and not eligible for the AKC Foundation Stock Service Program or an AKC Purebred Alternative Listing (PAL). 

In Canada, the &quot;Animal Pedigree Act&quot; lays out strict standards for the documenting of what it calls &quot;evolving breeds&quot;.

====Breed standards====
The breed standard for each breed of dog is a detailed description of the appearance and behaviour of an idealized dog of that breed. Included in the breed standard description are externally observable aspects of appearance and behaviour that are considered by the breed club to be the most important for the breed, and externally observable details of appearance or temperament that are considered by the breed club to be unacceptable (called &quot;faults&quot;). In addition, most breed standards include a historical section, describing the place of origin and the original work done by the breed or its ancestor types.

====Major registries====
Dogs with a breed standard may be accepted into one or more of the major registries (kennel clubs) of dog breeds, including The Kennel Club (1873, UK), American Kennel Club (1884), New Zealand Kennel Club (1886), Canadian Kennel Club (1888), United Kennel Club (1898), United Kennel Clubs International (UCI, Germany 1976), Australian National Kennel Council (1958), and other national breed registries. Recognized dog breeds are classified by groups, such as Hound, Terrier, Working, Herding, Sporting, Non-Sporting, Toy and Miscellaneous; some groups may be further subdivided by some registries. 

Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) is neither a breed registry nor does it issue pedigrees or keep addresses for breeders. It is a global canine organization with member and contract partners (one member per country) that conduct international conformation shows, working/hunting/herding trials, and various other events. The results are submitted to FCI for processing, approval and international recognition. Each of the member and contract partners issue and maintain their own pedigrees and respective breed standards, and train their own judges. FCI ensures that each member mutually recognizes the pedigrees and judges of all FCI members.

==== Health issues ====
Purebred dogs have more health problems than mongrel dogs, and require more veterinary visits, and tend to have lower longevity. Indeed, studies have reported lifespans that are shorter by between one and almost two years.
Notably, dog breeds with flat faces and short noses have breathing difficulties, eye trouble and other health issues.

====List of pure breeds====
:&quot;Refer: List of dog breeds&quot;
The Fédération Cynologique Internationale is a global organisation with 98 members and contract partners (one member per country) that recognize 356 purebreds.

===Cross-breeds===

A dog crossbreed is the result of mating two different breeds. &quot;Designer Dog&quot; became a fad in the late 20th century. Dog crossbreeds are combinations of lineages of the domestic dog; they are distinguished from canid hybrids, which are interspecific crosses between &quot;Canis&quot; species (wolves, coyotes, jackals, etc.). Notable canid hybrids include the coydog, coywolf, dingo–dog hybrid, jackal–dog hybrid, and wolfdog.

  Historically, crosses between dogs of different types were more well accepted at a time when modern purebred breeds (based on the eugenics principles) did not yet exist. Some crossbred dogs, created by breeding two purebred dogs of different breeds, may have the advantage of heterosis, or crossbreed vigor. This advantage can be progressively diluted when two crossbreeds are bred in the attempt to create a breed, narrowing the gene pool. The best way to continue taking advantage of crossbreed vigor is from the breeding of dogs of purebred ancestry, as this vigor is typically seen only in the first generation cross of two purebred animals of separate breeds, thus taking advantage of genetic diversity.

===Mixed-breeds===

A mongrel, mixed-breed dog or mutt is a dog that does not belong to one officially recognized breed but can be a mix of two breeds and is not the result of intentional breeding.

In the United States, the term &quot;mixed-breed&quot; is a favored synonym over &quot;mongrel&quot; among individuals who wish to avoid negative connotations associated with the latter term. The implication that such dogs must be a mix of defined breeds may stem from an inverted understanding of the origins of dog breeds. Purebred dogs have been, for the most part, artificially created from random-bred populations by human selective breeding with the purpose of enhancing desired physical, behavioral, or temperamental characteristics. Dogs that are not &quot;purebred&quot; are not necessarily a mix of such defined breeds. Therefore, among some experts and fans of such dogs, &quot;mongrel&quot; is still the preferred term.

===Natural breeds===
:&quot;See further: Landraces&quot;
Natural breeds rose through time in response to a particular environment and in isolation from other populations of the species. This environment included humans but with little or no selective breeding by humans.

<text>The Sandman is a comic book written by Neil Gaiman and published by DC Comics. Its artists include Sam Kieth, Mike Dringenberg, Jill Thompson, Shawn McManus, Marc Hempel, Bryan Talbot, and Michael Zulli, with lettering by Todd Klein and covers by Dave McKean. The original series ran for 75 issues from January 1989 to March 1996. Beginning with issue No. 47, it was placed under DC&#x27;s Vertigo imprint, and following Vertigo&#x27;s retirement in 2020, reprints have been published under DC&#x27;s Black Label imprint.

The main character of &quot;The Sandman&quot; is Dream, also known as Morpheus and other names, who is one of the seven Endless. The other Endless are Destiny, Death, Desire, Despair, Delirium (formerly Delight), and Destruction (also known as the Prodigal). The series is famous for Gaiman&#x27;s trademark use of anthropomorphic personification of various metaphysical entities, while also blending mythology and history in its horror setting within the DC Universe. &quot;The Sandman&quot; is a story about how Morpheus, the Lord of Dreams, is captured and subsequently learns that sometimes change is inevitable. &quot;The Sandman&quot; was Vertigo&#x27;s flagship title, and is available as a series of ten trade paperbacks, a recolored five-volume &quot;Absolute&quot; hardcover edition with slipcase, a three-volume omnibus edition, a black-and-white &quot;Annotated&quot; edition; it is also available for digital download.

Critically acclaimed, &quot;The Sandman&quot; was among the first graphic novels to appear on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, along with &quot;Maus&quot;, &quot;Watchmen,&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. It was one of six graphic novels to make &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s &quot;100 best reads from 1983 to 2008&quot;, ranking at No. 46. Norman Mailer described the series as &quot;a comic strip for intellectuals&quot;. The series has exerted considerable influence over the fantasy genre and graphic novel medium since its publication and is often regarded as one of the greatest graphic novels of all time.

Various film and television versions of &quot;Sandman&quot; have been developed. In 2013, Warner Bros. announced that a film adaptation starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt was in production, but Gordon-Levitt dropped out in 2016. In July 2020, September 2021 and September 2022, three full-cast audio dramas were released exclusively through Audible starring James McAvoy, which were narrated by Gaiman and dramatized and directed by Dirk Maggs. In August 2022, Netflix released a television adaptation starring Tom Sturridge.

==Publication history==
===Creation===
&quot;The Sandman&quot; grew out of a proposal by Neil Gaiman to revive DC&#x27;s 1974–1976 series &quot;The Sandman&quot;, written by Joe Simon and Michael Fleisher and illustrated by Jack Kirby and Ernie Chua. Gaiman had considered including characters from the &quot;Dream Stream&quot; (including the Kirby Sandman, Brute, Glob, and the brothers Cain and Abel) in a scene for the first issue of his 1988 miniseries &quot;Black Orchid&quot;. While the scene did not make it into later drafts because Roy Thomas was using the characters in &quot;Infinity, Inc.&quot;, Gaiman soon began constructing a treatment for a new series, and mentioned his treatment in passing to DC editor Karen Berger. He was unsure his &quot;Sandman&quot; pitch would be accepted, but weeks later, Berger asked Gaiman if he was interested in doing a &quot;Sandman&quot; series. Gaiman recalled, &quot;I said, &#x27;Um ... yes. Yes, definitely. What&#x27;s the catch?&#x27; [Berger said,] &#x27;There&#x27;s only one. We&#x27;d like a new Sandman. Keep the name. But the rest is up to you.

Gaiman crafted the new character from an initial image of &quot;a man, young, pale and naked, imprisoned in a tiny cell, waiting until his captors passed away... deathly thin, with long dark hair, and strange eyes&quot;. Gaiman patterned the character&#x27;s black attire on a print of a Japanese kimono as well as his own wardrobe. Gaiman wrote an eight-issue outline and gave it to Dave McKean and Leigh Baulch, who drew character sketches. Berger reviewed the sketches (along with some drawn by Gaiman) and suggested Sam Kieth as the series&#x27; artist. Mike Dringenberg, Todd Klein, Robbie Busch, and Dave McKean were hired as inker, letterer, colorist, and cover artist, respectively. McKean&#x27;s approach towards comics covers was unconventional, and he convinced Berger that the series&#x27; protagonist did not need to appear on every cover.

The first seven issues were inspired and influenced by early DC and EC Comics, and authors like Dennis Wheatley, Clive Barker, Ramsey Campbell, Robert Heinlein and Alan Moore, but with issue eight he says he finally found his own voice.

Gaiman&#x27;s approach to scripting the series became more difficult as the complex storyline and characters developed. &quot;When I began writing &quot;Sandman&quot;, it would take me a couple of weeks to write a script. As time went by I got slower and slower, until a script was taking me six weeks to a month to write.&quot;

===Original series===
The debut issue of &quot;The Sandman&quot; went on sale November 29, 1988 and was cover-dated January 1989. Gaiman described the early issues as &quot;awkward&quot;, since he, as well as Kieth, Dringenberg, and Busch, had never worked on a regular series before. Kieth quit after the fifth issue; he was replaced by Dringenberg as penciler, who was in turn replaced by Malcolm Jones III as inker. Dave McKean was the cover artist for the series through its entire run.

The character then appeared in two of DC&#x27;s &quot;Suggested for Mature Readers&quot; titles. In &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; vol. 2 No. 84 (March 1989), Dream and Eve allow Matthew Cable to live in the Dreaming because he died there, resurrecting him as a raven. He then meets John Constantine in &quot;Hellblazer&quot; No. 19 leading into the latter&#x27;s guest appearance in &quot;Sandman&quot; No. 3 (March 1989).

Gaiman revisited Hell as depicted by Alan Moore in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, beginning with a guest appearance by Jack Kirby&#x27;s Etrigan the Demon in issue No. 4 (April 1989). The story introduces Hell&#x27;s Hierarchy (as their entry is titled in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the DC Universe&quot;), headed by Lucifer (who would spin off into his own series in 1999), Beelzebub (later adversary to Kid Eternity), and Azazel, whom Dream defeated later in the series. Dream visited the Justice League International in the following issue, No. 5 (May 1989). Although multiple mainstream DC characters appeared in the series throughout its run, such as Martian Manhunter and Scarecrow, this would not be the norm. Gaiman and artist Mike Dringenberg introduced Death, the older sister of Dream, in issue No. 8 (August 1989).

Gaiman began incorporating elements of the Kirby &quot;Sandman&quot; series in issue No. 11 (December 1989), including the changes implemented by Roy Thomas. Joe Simon and Michael Fleisher had treated the character, who resembled a superhero, as the &quot;true&quot; Sandman. The Thomas and Gaiman stories revealed that the character&#x27;s existence was a sham created by two nightmares who had escaped to a pocket of the Dreaming. Brute and Glob would later attempt this again on Sanderson Hawkins, sidekick to Wesley Dodds, the Golden Age Sandman. Gaiman gave Jed Walker a surname and made him related to several new characters. The Thomas Sandman was Hector Hall, who married the already-pregnant Fury in the Dreaming in &quot;Infinity, Inc.&quot; No. 51. It was explained that Dr. Garrett Sanford, the 1970s Simon and Kirby version of the Sandman, had gone insane from the loneliness of the Dream Dimension and taken his own life. Brute and Glob put the spirit of Hector Hall, which had been cast out of his own body, into Sanford&#x27;s body, and it eventually began to resemble Hall&#x27;s. Fury, in her civilian guise as Lyta Hall, was the only superhero recurring character in the series. Even at that, her powers had come to her via the Fury Tisiphone, and the Furies, under the euphemism, &quot;the Kindly Ones&quot;, a translation of &quot;Eumenides&quot;, a name they earned during the events of Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Oresteia&quot; trilogy, are major characters in the series.

The series follows a tragic course in which Dream, having learned a great deal from his imprisonment, tries to correct the things he has done wrong in the past. Ultimately, this causes him to mercy kill his own son, which leads to his own death at the hands of the Furies. Dream, having found himself a replacement early on in Daniel Hall, dies in issue No. 69 (July 1995). The remaining issues deal with Dream&#x27;s funeral, Hob Gadling choosing to remain immortal in spite of Dream&#x27;s death, and two stories from the past. The series wraps with the story of William Shakespeare creating his other commission for Dream, &quot;The Tempest&quot;, his last work not in collaboration with other writers.

&quot;The Sandman&quot; became a cult success for DC Comics and attracted an audience unlike that of mainstream comics: much of the readership was female, many were in their twenties, and many read no other comics at all. Comics historian Les Daniels called Gaiman&#x27;s work &quot;astonishing&quot; and noted that &quot;The Sandman&quot; was &quot;a mixture of fantasy, horror, and ironic humor such as comic books had never seen before&quot;. DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that &quot;&quot;The Sandman&quot; became the first extraordinary success as a series of graphic novel collections, reaching out and converting new readers to the medium, particularly young women on college campuses, and making Gaiman himself into an iconic cultural figure.&quot; Gaiman had a finite run in mind for the series, and it concluded with issue No. 75. Gaiman said in 1996, &quot;Could I do another five issues of Sandman? Well, damn right. And would I be able to look at myself in the mirror happily? No. Is it time to stop because I&#x27;ve reached the end, yes, and I think I&#x27;d rather leave while I&#x27;m in love.&quot; The final issue, No. 75, was dated March 1996.

===Additions and spin-offs===
The Sandman has inspired numerous spin-offs. While most of these are not written by Gaiman, he did write two miniseries focusing on the character of Death. &quot;&quot; was published from March to May 1993 and was based on the fable that Death takes human form once a century to remain grounded and in touch with humanity. This was followed in 1996 by &quot;&quot;, featuring the characters of Foxglove and Hazel from &quot;A Game of You&quot;. Other spin-offs include &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, &quot;Lucifer,&quot; and &quot;Dead Boy Detectives&quot;.

A set of &quot;Sandman&quot; trading cards was issued in 1994 by SkyBox International.

In 1999, Gaiman wrote &quot;The Sandman: The Dream Hunters,&quot; a novella illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano. As in many of the single-issue stories throughout &quot;The Sandman&quot;, Morpheus appears in &quot;Dream Hunters&quot;, but only as a supporting character. In Gaiman&#x27;s afterword to the book, he describes the story as a retelling of an existing Japanese legend. There is no trace of it in the primary source he cites, and when asked, Gaiman has stated that he made up the &quot;legend&quot;. The novel was later adapted into a four-issue miniseries by P. Craig Russell and released by Vertigo from January 2009 to April 2009.

Gaiman and Matt Wagner co-wrote &quot;Sandman Midnight Theatre&quot;, a 1995 prestige format one-shot in which Dream and Wesley Dodds meet in person after the events in the storyline, &quot;The Python&quot;, which ended with Dodds&#x27;s lover, Dian Belmont, going to England, which eventually brings both her and Dodds to Roderick Burgess&#x27;s mansion. In 2001, Dream appeared in a flashback in &quot;Green Arrow&quot; vol. 3, No. 9, which takes place at a point during the 70 years of the first issue.

Gaiman wrote several new stories about Morpheus and his siblings, one story for each, which were published in 2003 as the &quot;Endless Nights&quot; anthology. The stories are set throughout history, but two take place after the final events of the monthly series. It was written by Gaiman and featured a different illustrator for each story. This collection was the first hardcover graphic novel ever to appear on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Hardcover Best Seller list.

Writer/artist Jill Thompson wrote and illustrated several stories featuring the Sandman characters. These include the manga-style book &quot;&quot;, one of DC&#x27;s best-selling books of 2003, set during the events of &quot;Season of Mists&quot;, and &quot;The Little Endless Storybook&quot;, a children&#x27;s book using childlike versions of the Endless.

To commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of &quot;The Sandman&quot;, Gaiman wrote a new tale involving the battle that had exhausted Morpheus prior to the beginning of the original story. Written by Gaiman and with art by J. H. Williams III, &quot;Overture&quot; tells the previously hinted story of Dream&#x27;s adventure prior to &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot;, which had exhausted him so much that it made Burgess&#x27;s actions capable of capturing him. The limited series had six issues. Issue #1 was released on October 30, 2013, and although it was planned to have a bi-monthly release schedule, issue 2 was delayed until March 2014, which Gaiman explained was &quot;mostly due to the giant signing tour I was on from June, and me not getting script written on the tour, with knock-on effects&quot;. Special editions were released approximately a month after the original editions, which contain interviews with the creative team, alongside rare artwork. &quot;Overture&quot; also reveals that Night and Time respectively are mother and father to the seven Endless siblings.

In 2018, DC announced &quot;The Sandman Universe&quot;, a new line of comics exploring &quot;The Sandman&quot;″s part of the DC Universe. It started in August 2018.

Dream of The Endless makes an appearance in Dark Nights: Metal, as Daniel.

==Summary==

&quot;The Sandman&quot;″s main character is Dream, the eponymous Sandman, who is the anthropomorphic personification of dreams. At the start of the series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual that was trying to capture his sibling Death and is held prisoner by its caster for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom which has fallen into disrepair in his absence while reclaiming his gear and hunting down the escaped dreams and nightmares like Corinthian, Brute and Glob, and Fiddler&#x27;s Green. 

The character&#x27;s initial haughty and often cruel manner begins to soften after his years of imprisonment at the start of the series, but the challenge of undoing past sins and changing old ways is an enormous one for a being who has been set in his ways for billions of years. In its beginnings, the series is a very dark horror comic. Later, the series evolves into an elaborate fantasy series, incorporating elements of classical and contemporary mythology, ultimately placing its protagonist in the role of a tragic hero.

The storylines primarily take place in the Dreaming, Morpheus&#x27;s realm, and the waking world, with occasional visits to other domains, such as Hell, Faerie, Asgard, and the domains of the other Endless. Many stories take place in the contemporary United States of America and the United Kingdom. The DC Universe was the official setting of the series, but well-known DC characters and places were rarely featured after 1990. A notable exception is Lyta Hall, formerly Fury of the 1980s super-team Infinity, Inc., who figures prominently in the &quot;Kindly Ones&quot; story arc. Most of the storylines take place in modern times, but many short stories are set in the past, taking advantage of the immortal nature of many of the characters, and deal with historical individuals and events, such as in the short story &quot;Men of Good Fortune&quot;.

==Characters==
==Themes and genre==
&quot;The Sandman&quot; comic book series falls within the dark fantasy genre, albeit in a more contemporary and modern setting. Critic Marc Buxton described the book as a &quot;masterful tale that created a movement of mature dark fantasy&quot; which was largely unseen in previous fantasy works before it. The comic book also falls into the genres of urban fantasy, epic fantasy, historical drama, and superhero. It is written as a metaphysical examination of the elements of fiction, which Neil Gaiman accomplished through the artistic use of unique anthropomorphic personifications, mythology, legends, historical figures and occult culture, making up most of the major and minor characters as well as the plot device and even the settings of the story. In its earliest story arcs, the &quot;Sandman&quot; mythos existed primarily in the DC Universe, and as such numerous DC characters made some appearances or were mentioned. Later, the series would reference the DCU less often, while continuing to exist in the same universe.

Critic Hilary Goldstein described the comic book as &quot;about the concept of dreams more so than the act of dreaming&quot;. In the early issues, responsibility and rebirth were the primary themes of the story. As Dream finally liberates himself from his occultist captors, he returns to his kingdom which had fallen on hard times due to his absence, while also facing his other siblings, who each have their own reaction to his return. The story is structured not as a series of unconnected events nor as an incoherent dream, but by having each panel have a specific purpose in the flow of the story. Dreams became the core of every story arc written in the series, and the protagonist&#x27;s journey became more distinct and deliberate. Many Vertigo books since, such as &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; and &quot;&quot;, have adopted this kind of format in their writing, creating a traditional prose only seen in the imprint.

==Collected editions==
&quot;The Sandman&quot; was initially published as a monthly serial, in 32-page comic books with some exceptions to this pattern. The stories within were usually 24 pages long, with eight exceptions within the main story arc: issue #1, &quot;Sleep of the Just&quot; (40 pages); issue #14, &quot;Collectors&quot; (38 pages); issue #32, &quot;Slaughter on Fifth Avenue&quot; (25 pages); issue #33, &quot;Lullabies of Broadway&quot; (23 pages); issue #36, &quot;Over the Sea to Sky&quot; (39 pages); issue #50, &quot;Distant Mirrors—Ramadan&quot; (32 pages); issue #52, &quot;Cluracan&#x27;s Tale&quot; (25 pages); issue #75, &quot;The Tempest&quot; (38 pages). As the series increased in popularity, DC Comics began to reprint them in hardcover and trade paperback editions, each representing either a complete novel or a collection of related short stories.

DC first published &quot;The Doll&#x27;s House&quot; storyline in a collection called simply &quot;The Sandman&quot;. Shortly thereafter, the first three volumes were published and named independently and collected in a boxed set. (Death&#x27;s debut story, &quot;The Sound of Her Wings&quot; from issue #8, appeared both at the beginning of early editions of &quot;The Doll&#x27;s House&quot; and at the end of &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot;, creating overlap between the first two volumes.) In 1998, the cover images from &quot;The Sandman&quot; were released as one compiled volume titled &quot;&quot;. Dave McKean&#x27;s covers use techniques such as painting, sculpture, photography, drawing, and computer manipulation.

===Trade paperbacks===

===Annotated editions===

While initially hesitant about releasing annotated editions, Gaiman eventually changed his mind when he forgot a reference when asked about it by a reader. The task of annotating the series was undertaken by Gaiman&#x27;s friend Leslie S. Klinger of &quot;The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes&quot; who worked from the original scripts given to him by Gaiman.

The first volume of &quot;The Annotated Sandman&quot; was published by DC Comics in January 2012 as a large 12&quot; by 12&quot; black-and-white book with an introduction by Gaiman and included issues #1–20. The annotations are presented on a page-by-page, panel-by-panel basis, with quoted sections from Gaiman&#x27;s scripts and insight into the various historical, mythological and DC Universe references included in the comic. The second volume annotating issues #21–39 was released in November 2012. The third volume covering issues #40–56, &quot;The Sandman Special&quot; No. 1 and the story &quot;How They Met Themselves&quot; from &quot;Vertigo: Winter&#x27;s Edge&quot; #3 was released in October 2014. The fourth volume including issues #57–75 and the story &quot;The Castle&quot; from &quot;Vertigo Jam&quot; #1 was released in December 2015.

The first volume was nominated for the 2012 Bram Stoker Award for Best Non-Fiction.

===Omnibus editions===
&quot;The Sandman Omnibus&quot;, a massive two-volume hardcover edition, was released in 2013 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of &quot;The Sandman&quot;. &quot;Volume 1&quot; collects issues #1–37 and &quot;The Sandman Special&quot; No. 1 with &quot;Volume 2&quot; collecting issues #38–75 with stories from &quot;Vertigo Jam&quot; No. 1 and &quot;Vertigo: Winter&#x27;s Edge&quot;.

==Adaptations into other media==

===Film===
Throughout the late 1990s, a film adaptation of the comic was periodically planned by Warner Bros., parent company of DC Comics. Roger Avary was originally attached to direct after the success of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, collaborating with &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio in 1996 on a revision of their first script draft, which merged the &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot; storyline with that of &quot;The Doll&#x27;s House&quot;. Avary intended the film to be in part visually inspired by animator Jan Švankmajer&#x27;s work. Avary was fired after disagreements over the creative direction with executive producer Jon Peters, best known for the 1989 film &quot;Batman&quot; and the abandoned project &quot;Superman Lives&quot;. It was due to their meeting on the &quot;Sandman&quot; film project that Avary and Gaiman collaborated one year later on the script for &quot;Beowulf&quot;. The project carried on through several more writers and scripts. A later draft by William Farmer, reviewed at &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Cool News&quot;, was met with scorn from fans. Gaiman called the last screenplay that Warner Bros. would send him &quot;not only the worst &quot;Sandman&quot; script I&#x27;ve ever seen, but quite easily the worst script I&#x27;ve ever read&quot;. Gaiman has said that his dissatisfaction with how his characters were being treated had dissuaded him from writing any more stories involving the Endless, although he has since written &quot;Endless Nights&quot; and &quot;Sandman Overture&quot;.

By 2001, the project had become stranded in development hell. In a Q&amp;A panel at San Diego Comic-Con in 2007, Gaiman remarked, &quot;I&#x27;d rather see no &quot;Sandman&quot; movie made than a bad &quot;Sandman&quot; movie. But I feel like the time for a &quot;Sandman&quot; movie is coming soon. We need someone who has the same obsession with the source material as Peter Jackson had with &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; or Sam Raimi had with &quot;Spider-Man&quot;.&quot; That same year, he stated that he could imagine Terry Gilliam as a director for the adaptation: &quot;I would always give anything to Terry Gilliam, forever, so if Terry Gilliam ever wants to do &quot;Sandman&quot; then as far as I&#x27;m concerned Terry Gilliam should do Sandman.&quot; In 2013, DC President Diane Nelson said that a &quot;Sandman&quot; film would be as rich as the Harry Potter universe. David S. Goyer announced in an interview in early December that he would be producing an adaptation of the graphic novel, alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Neil Gaiman. Jack Thorne was hired to write the script. On October 16, 2014, Gaiman clarified that while the film was not announced with the DC slate by Warner Bros., it would instead be distributed by Vertigo and announced with those slate of films. Goyer told &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; in an interview that the studio was very happy with the film&#x27;s script. According to &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot;, the film was to be distributed by New Line Cinema. In October 2015, Goyer revealed that a new screenwriter was being brought on board to revise the script by Jack Thorne and stated that he believed the film would go into production the following year. In March 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; revealed that Eric Heisserer was hired to rewrite the film&#x27;s script. The next day, Gordon-Levitt announced that he had dropped out due to disagreements with the studio over the creative direction of the film. On November 9, 2016, i09 reported that Heisserer had turned in his draft of the script but left the film, stating that the film should be an HBO series instead.

Death
* In a &quot;DC Showcase&quot; animated short, Death made her first official appearance outside of comics. In the short, Death (voiced by Jamie Chung) meets Vincent (voiced by Leonardo Nam), a failed artist struggling with his personal demons. It was directed by Sam Liu, and written by J. M. DeMatteis. The short was released as a special feature with the &quot;Wonder Woman: Bloodlines&quot; Blu-Ray.

===Television===
====&quot;The Sandman&quot;====

Due to the prolonged development period of the film, in 2010, DC Entertainment shifted focus onto developing a television series adaptation. Film director James Mangold pitched a series concept to cable channel HBO, whilst consulting with Gaiman himself on an unofficial basis, but this proved to be unsuccessful. It was reported in September 2010 that Warner Bros. Television was licensing the rights to produce a TV series, and that &quot;Supernatural&quot; creator Eric Kripke was their preferred candidate to adapt the saga. In March 2011, it was announced via Neil Gaiman&#x27;s web blog that while he and DC liked Eric Kripke and his approach, it did not feel quite right. The author hoped to launch the series in another form but plans for a television adaptation are on hold as production moves forward on the film. As the film adaptation of Morpheus&#x27;s story was being planned, DC and Fox discussed a possible TV series based on the &quot;Sandman&quot; character Lucifer.

Netflix announced in June 2019 that it had completed a deal with Warner Bros. to develop &quot;Sandman&quot; into a live-action television series run by Allan Heinberg, with Gaiman and Goyer serving as executive producers. The cast, including Tom Sturridge as the title character, was announced in January and May 2021.

The series premiered on August 5, 2022, and adapts &quot;Preludes &amp; Nocturnes&quot;, &quot;The Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, and the beginning of &quot;Dream Country&quot;. On 1 February 2025, it was announced that the show would end after the upcoming second season.

====&quot;Lucifer&quot;====
On September 16, 2014, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that DC and Fox were developing a television series based on the &quot;Sandman&quot; character Lucifer created by Neil Gaiman. On February 19, 2015, the official pilot order was given. According to the premise reported by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, the potential series would greatly differ from the comic book version of the character featured in &quot;The Sandman&quot; and his own solo comic book series. Lucifer was featured in a &quot;&quot;-like or &quot;Elementary&quot; style television show with supernatural elements. The show began airing on January 25, 2016, and concluded on September 10, 2021

====&quot;Dead Boy Detectives&quot;====
Sebastian Croft and Ty Tennant portrayed Payne and Rowland in the third season of the &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; TV series. The series also features their medium companion Crystal Palace, portrayed by Madalyn Horcher.

HBO Max has ordered a pilot for a potential &quot;Dead Boy Detectives&quot; series in September 2021. The pilot was written by Steve Yockey, also acting as an executive producer alongside Jeremy Carver. The pilot also features Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, and David Madden as executive producers under Berlanti Productions. The main cast for the pilot, as announced in November 2021, includes Jayden Revri as Edwin Payne, George Rexstrew as Charles Rowland, and Kassius Nelson as Crystal Palace. The series was picked up by HBO Max for an eight-episode first season in April 2022, but transferred to Netflix in February 2023. Additional cast members include Briana Cuoco as Jenny the Butcher, Yuyu Kitamura as Niko, Jenn Lyon as Esther, and Ruth Connell reprising her &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; role of Night Nurse.

===Audio===

On July 15, 2020, Audible released an adaptation of the comic book series as a multi-part audio drama directed by Dirk Maggs with music by James Hannigan, adapting &quot;Preludes &amp; Nocturnes&quot;, &quot;The Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, and &quot;Dream Country&quot;. The voice cast included Gaiman as the Narrator, James McAvoy as Dream, Kat Dennings as Death, Taron Egerton as John Constantine, Michael Sheen as Lucifer, Riz Ahmed as the Corinthian, Andy Serkis as Matthew the Raven, Samantha Morton as Urania Blackwell, Bebe Neuwirth as the Siamese Cat, Arthur Darvill as William Shakespeare, Justin Vivian Bond as Desire, and Miriam Margolyes as Despair.

&quot;The Sandman: Act II&quot; was released on September 22, 2021, and featured most of the original cast, adapting &quot;Season of Mists&quot;, &quot;A Game of You&quot;, and seven stories of &quot;Fables &amp; Reflections&quot;. New additions to the cast included: Regé-Jean Page as Orpheus, Jeffrey Wright as Destiny, Brian Cox as Augustus, Emma Corrin as Thessaly, John Lithgow as Joshua Norton, David Tennant as Loki, Bill Nighy as Odin, Kristen Schaal as Delirium, Kevin Smith as Merv Pumpkinhead, and Niamh Walsh as Nuala. Neuwirth also returned, but portrayed Bast.

&quot;The Sandman: Act III&quot; was released on September 28, 2022, without a prior announcement, and featured most of the cast from the first two acts, adapting &quot;Brief Lives&quot;, and &quot;Worlds&#x27; End&quot;. New additions to the cast included: David Harewood as Destruction, Wil Wheaton as Brant Tucker, and K.J. Apa as Prez.

<text>The North Central Conference (NCC), also known as North Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, was a college athletic conference which operated in the north central United States. It participated in the NCAA&#x27;s Division II.

==History==
The NCC was formed in 1922. Charter members of the NCC were South Dakota State College (now South Dakota State University), College of St. Thomas (now the University of St. Thomas), Des Moines University, Creighton University, North Dakota Agricultural College (now North Dakota State University), the University of North Dakota, Morningside College (now Morningside University), the University of South Dakota, and Nebraska Wesleyan University.

The University of Northern Iowa was a member of the NCC from 1934 until 1978. UNI currently competes in Division I in the Missouri Valley Conference; in FCS football, it competes in the Missouri Valley Football Conference. In 2002 Morningside College left the NCC to join the NAIA. The University of Northern Colorado left the conference in 2003, followed in 2004 by North Dakota State University and South Dakota State University. These three schools all transitioned their athletics programs from Division II to Division I; they became founding members of the Division I FCS Great West Football Conference, which started play in the fall of 2004. Since that time, Northern Colorado moved on to the Big Sky Conference in all sports in 2006. In the fall of 2006, North Dakota State and South Dakota State were admitted to The Summit League; they have also moved on to rejoin old conference mate Northern Iowa in the Missouri Valley Football Conference.

It was announced on November 29, 2006, that the 2007–08 athletic season would be the final season for the NCC and that the conference would cease operations on July 1, 2008.

*The University of North Dakota and the University of South Dakota both announced in 2006 that they would reclassify its athletic programs to Division I, and both left the North Central Conference after the 2007–08 academic year. Both have since joined North Dakota State, South Dakota State, and Northern Iowa as members of the Missouri Valley Football Conference in football, and the Summit League in other sports together with NDSU, SDSU and UNO.
*Augustana College, the University of Minnesota Duluth, Minnesota State University, Mankato and St. Cloud State University were admitted to the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference beginning July 1, 2008.
*The University of Nebraska at Omaha joined the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association starting July 1, 2008. UNO has since moved to Division I and is now in The Summit League with many of its former conference members.
*Central Washington University and Western Washington University, both football-only affiliates of the NCC, joined up with football independents Western Oregon, Humboldt State, and Dixie State (now known as Utah Tech) and restarted football in their full-time home of the Great Northwest Athletic Conference. Central Washington has since moved their program to the Lone Star Conference, while Western Washington ceased sponsoring football after the 2008 season.

===Chronological timeline===
* In 1922, the North Central Conference (also known as the North Central Intercollegiate Conference) was founded with nine charter members: College of St. Thomas, Creighton University, Des Moines University, Morningside College, Nebraska Wesleyan University, North Dakota Agricultural College, University of North Dakota, South Dakota State College of Agricultural and Mechanical Arts, and the University of South Dakota. St. Thomas leaves after the 1922 season.
* In 1926, Des Moines University left the NCC, and the school eventually would close its doors in 1929. Nebraska Wesleyan also left, joining the Nebraska Conference. St. Thomas rejoins the conference after a brief stint as an independent.
* In 1928, Creighton University and the College of St. Thomas (now University of St. Thomas) left the NCC. St. Thomas became a full member of the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference while Creighton left to join the Missouri Valley Conference. The NCC was left with five members.
* In 1934, Iowa State Teachers College joined the NCC from the Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. Also, Omaha University joined the NCC to bring membership back up to seven schools.
* In 1942, Augustana College left the South Dakota Intercollegiate Conference to join the North Central Conference as its eighth member.
* In 1946, Omaha University left the NCC to join the Central Intercollegiate Conference. The NCC was left with seven members.
* In 1960, North Dakota Agricultural College was renamed North Dakota State University.
* In 1961, the Iowa State Teachers College was renamed the State College of Iowa.
* In 1964, South Dakota State College was renamed South Dakota State University.
* In 1967, State College of Iowa was renamed to the University of Northern Iowa.
* In 1968, Mankato State College joined the NCC from the Northern Intercollegiate Conference, bringing league membership up to eight teams.
* In 1975, Mankato State College was renamed Mankato State University.
* In 1976, the University of Nebraska at Omaha (Omaha University was renamed to UNO in 1968) rejoined the NCC, while Mankato State University left the NCC due to not fielding a team in the 1976 season. Membership in the NCC remained at eight schools.
* In 1978, the University of Northern Colorado left the Great Plains Athletic Conference to join the North Central Conference. In the same year, the University of Northern Iowa left the NCC to move to the Association of Mid-Continent Universities. Membership remained at eight schools.
* In 1981, Mankato State University and St. Cloud State University joined the NCC from the Northern Intercollegiate Conference, giving the NCC its largest membership total in history at 10 schools and it would remain at this level for the next 21 years. Membership at this time included: Augustana, Mankato State, Morningside, Nebraska-Omaha, North Dakota, North Dakota State, Northern Colorado, South Dakota, South Dakota State, and St. Cloud State.
* In 1998, Mankato State University was officially renamed to Minnesota State University, Mankato.
* In 2002, Morningside College, one of the North Central Conference&#x27;s charter members, left the league and moved out of NCAA Division II to the NAIA level. The NCC is left with nine members.
* In 2003, the University of Northern Colorado moved up to NCAA Division I, leaving the NCC with eight members.
* In 2004, charter members North Dakota State and South Dakota State also announced plans to move to Division I and leave the NCC. SDSU, NDSU and Northern Colorado founded the FCS Great West Football Conference. The University of Minnesota-Duluth left the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference to join the NCC as its seventh member.
* In 2006, Central Washington University and Western Washington University of the Great Northwest Athletic Conference joined the North Central Conference as affiliate members in the sport of football only to give the conference nine football schools.
* In 2008, the two remaining charter members of the NCC, the University of South Dakota and the University of North Dakota, announced plans to leave the conference and move up to Division I. This move led to the rest of the league members making a move. Central Washington and Western Washington joined up with other schools in the Pacific Northwest to form a football league in the GNAC. Augustana, Minnesota-Duluth, Minnesota State and St. Cloud State remained in NCAA Division II by joining the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference. Finally, Nebraska-Omaha also remained in Division II by joining the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) before moving to Division I a year later. These moves resulted in the dissolution of the North Central Conference after having existed for 86 years.

==Member schools==
===Final members===
The NCC had seven full members in the conference&#x27;s final season, one was a private school:

===Membership timeline===
==Sports==
The NCC sponsored baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, football, cross-country, golf, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball, and wrestling.

Six of the seven members of the NCC sponsored Division I ice hockey, and five still do. In men&#x27;s hockey, after a major conference realignment that took effect in 2013, Minnesota–Duluth, Nebraska–Omaha, North Dakota, and St. Cloud State field teams in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference, while Minnesota State–Mankato is a member of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). Before the realignment, all of these schools had been members of the WCHA for men&#x27;s hockey. All of these schools, except for Omaha, have women&#x27;s teams in the WCHA (Omaha women&#x27;s hockey is a club sport). The women&#x27;s side of the WCHA was not affected by this realignment.

<text>Euboea ( ; , ), also known by its modern spelling Evia ( ; , ), is the second-largest Greek island in area and population, after Crete, and the sixth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is separated from Boeotia in mainland Greece by the narrow Euripus Strait (only at its narrowest point). In general outline it is a long and narrow island; it is about long, and varies in breadth from to . Its geographic orientation is from northwest to southeast, and it is traversed throughout its length by a mountain range, which forms part of the chain that bounds Thessaly on the east, and is continued south of Euboia in the lofty islands of Andros, Tinos and Mykonos.

It forms most of the regional unit of Euboea, which also includes Skyros and a small area of the Greek mainland.

==Name==

Like most of the Greek islands, Euboea was known by other names in antiquity, such as &quot;Macris&quot; (Μάκρις) and &quot;Doliche&quot; (Δολίχη) from its elongated shape, or &quot;Ellopia&quot; (after Ellops the son of Ion), &quot;Aonia&quot; and &quot;Abantis&quot; from the tribes inhabiting it, or &quot;Ocha/Oche&quot; (Ὄχη), which is also the name of one of the highest mountains on the island.
Its ancient and current name, Εὔβοια, derives from the words εὖ &quot;good&quot;, and βοῦς &quot;ox&quot;, meaning &quot;(the land of) the well(-fed) oxen&quot;. Strabo writes that it took the name Euboea either by the heroine Euboea or because of a cave on the island at the Aegaean coast which was called Boösaule (, meaning ) and there Io was said to have given birth to Epaphus.

In the Middle Ages, the island was often referred to by Byzantine authors by the name of its capital, &quot;Chalcis&quot; (Χαλκίς) or &quot;Euripos&quot; (Εὔριπος,) the name of the strait that separates the island from the Greek mainland, although the ancient name Euboea remained in use by classicizing authors until the 16th century.

The phrase στὸν Εὔριπον &#x27;to Evripos&#x27;, rebracketed as στὸ Νεὔριπον &#x27;to Nevripos&#x27;, became &quot;Negroponte&quot; (&quot;Black Bridge&quot;) in Italian by folk etymology, the &quot;ponte&quot; &#x27;bridge&#x27; being interpreted as the bridge of Chalcis. This name was most relevant when the island was under Venetian rule. That name entered common use in the West in the 13th century, with other variants being Egripons, Negripo, and Negropont.

Under Ottoman rule, the island and its capital were known as &quot;Eğriboz&quot; or &quot;Ağriboz&quot;, again after the Euripos strait.

==Geography and climate==


Euboea was believed to have originally formed part of the mainland, and to have been separated from it by an earthquake. This is fairly probable, because it lies in the neighbourhood of a fault line, and both Thucydides and Strabo write that the northern part of the island had been shaken at different periods. In the neighbourhood of Chalcis, both to the north and the south, the bays are so confined as to make plausible the story of Agamemnon&#x27;s fleet having been detained there by contrary winds. At Chalcis itself, where the strait is narrowest at only 40 m, it is called the Euripus Strait. The extraordinary changes of tide that take place in this passage have been a subject of note since classical times, and it was so feared by sailors that the principal line of traffic from the north of the Aegean to Athens used to bypass Chalcis and the Euboic Sea. At one moment the current runs like a river in one direction, and shortly afterwards with equal velocity in the other. A bridge was first constructed here in the twenty-first year of the Peloponnesian War (410 BC).

Geography and nature divide the island itself into three distinct parts: the fertile and forested north (which suffered major damage in the August 2021 forest fires); the forested mountainous centre, with agriculture limited to the coastal valleys; and the barren south.

The main mountains include Dirfi (), Kantili (), Pyxaria () in the northeast and Ochi () in the south. The neighboring gulfs are the Pagasetic Gulf in the north, Malian Gulf, North Euboean Gulf in the west, the Euboic Sea and the Petalion Gulf. The Petalioi archipelago lies to the southwest, while the Monilia islands lie to the west.

With a total land area of , the island had a population of 198,130 at the 2001 census.

Most of the island features a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;) with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters.

==History==

===Antiquity===

The history of the island of Euboea is largely that of its two principal cities, Chalcis and Eretria, both mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships. Both cities were settled by Ionian Greeks from Attica, and would eventually settle numerous colonies in Magna Graecia and Sicily, such as Cumae and Rhegium, and on the coast of Macedonia. This opened new trade routes to the Greeks, and extended the reach of Western Civilization. The commercial influence of these city-states is evident in the fact that the Euboic scale of weights and measures was used among the Ionic cities generally, and in Athens until the end of the 7th century BC, during the time of Solon. The classicist Barry B. Powell has proposed that Euboea may have been where the Greek alphabet was first employed, c. 775–750 BC, and that Homer may have spent part of his life on the island.

Chalcis and Eretria were rival cities, and appear to have been equally powerful for a while. One of the earliest major military conflicts in Greek history took place between them, known as the Lelantine War, in which many other Greek city-states also took part. In 490 BC, Eretria was utterly ruined by the Persian armies. Eretria, Athens, and other Ionian Greek states had previously burned the Persian city of Sardis and participated in the Ionian revolution. After Eretria was destroyed, its inhabitants were transported as captives to Persia. Though it was restored nearby its original site after the Battle of Marathon, the city never regained its former eminence. Following the battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium in 480 BC, Persian forces occupied Euboea along with Attica and Boeotia. Following their decisive defeat at the Battle of Plataea the following year, the Persians withdrew from all of their European possessions, including Euboea.

Both cities gradually lost influence to Athens, which saw Euboea as a strategic territory. Euboea was an important source of grain and cattle, and controlling the island meant Athens could prevent invasion and better protect its trade routes from piracy.
Athens invaded Chalcis in 506 BC and settled 4,000 Attic Greeks on their lands. After this conflict, the whole of the island was gradually reduced to an Athenian dependency. Another struggle between Euboea and Athens broke out in 446. Led by Pericles, the Athenians subdued the revolt, and captured Histiaea in the north of the island for their own settlement.

By 410 BC, during the Peloponnesian War, the island succeeded in regaining its independence. Euboea participated in Greek affairs until it fell under the control of Philip II of Macedon after the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. It was incorporated into the Roman Republic in the second century BC. Aristotle died on the island in 322 BC soon after fleeing Athens for his mother&#x27;s family estate in Chalcis. From the early Hellenistic period to well into the Roman Imperial period, the island was organized into the Euboean League.

===Middle Ages===


Unlike much of Byzantine Greece, Euboea was spared the bulk of the barbarian raids during late antiquity and the early medieval period, due to its relatively isolated location. The Vandals raided its shores in 466 and in 475, but the island seems to have been left alone by the Avars and Slavs, and it was not until a failed Arab attack on Chalcis in the 870s that the island again came under threat. As a result, the island preserved a relative prosperity throughout the early medieval period, as attested by finds of mosaics, churches and sculpture throughout the 7th century, &quot;even from remote areas of the island&quot;. In the 6th century, the &quot;Synecdemus&quot; listed four cities on the island, Aidipsos, Chalcis, Porthmos (modern Aliveri) and Karystos, and a number of other sites are known as bishoprics in the subsequent centuries (Oreoi and Avlon), although their urban character is unclear. In the 8th century, Euboea formed a distinct fiscal district (&quot;dioikesis&quot;), and then formed part of the theme of Hellas.

In 1157 all the coastal towns of Euboea were destroyed by a Sicilian force, while Chalcis was burned down by the Venetians in 1171. During the 13th century, the Greek element of the island was strengthened by the Byzantine Emperor Michael Palaiologos.

Euboea came into prominence following the Fourth Crusade. In the partition of the Byzantine Empire by the crusaders after 1204, the island was occupied by a number of Lombard families, who divided it into three baronies, the Triarchy of Negroponte; each barony was split in 1216, giving six sestiere. The island&#x27;s rulers came early on under the influence of the Venetian Republic, which secured control of the island&#x27;s commerce in the War of the Euboeote Succession (1256–1258) and gradually expanded its control, until they acquired full sovereignty by 1390.

On 12 July 1470, during the Ottoman–Venetian War of 1463–1479 and after a protracted and bloody siege, the well-fortified city of Negroponte (Chalcis) was wrested from Venice by Mehmed II and the whole island fell into the hands of the Ottoman Empire. The Doge Francesco Morosini besieged the city in 1688, but was forced to withdraw after three months.

Albanians started settling Euboea gradually, since 1402, encouraged by the Venetians. In 1425, a total of 10,000 Albanians from various regions were settled in Euboea. A further indeterminate number of Albanians settled in the island in 1435. These Albanians intermingled with the local Greeks of the island. A contemporary report (1687) notes that in 1471 Greeks had abandoned the island and by 1687 almost all of the island was inhabited by Albanians. This isn&#x27;t corroborated in other reports so it likely presents a doubtful depiction of the demographic situation in the island. According to Johann Georg Von Hahn (1854), Albanians were present in all of the cities of southern Euboea, excluding the town of Karystos which was inhabited solely by Greeks. According to Hahn, the Albanians numbered 25,000 in south Euboea, out of 72,368 total population of the island as a whole.

The Greek inhabitants of south Euboea spoke a certain dialect related to Old Athenian. This dialect was spoken in Kymi, Avlonari, Konistres, Aliveri, Karystos and other places.

Although the name Negroponte remained current in European languages until the 19th century, the Turks themselves called the city and the island Eğriboz or Ağriboz after the Euripos Strait. Under Ottoman rule, Ağriboz was the seat of a sanjak that also encompassed much of Continental Greece.

At the conclusion of the Greek War of Independence in 1830, the island returned to Greece and constituted a part of the newly established independent Greek kingdom.

=== Modern period ===
In 1982, in the Greek-speaking village of Antia in southern Euboea, the entire population knew the local whistled language called &quot;sfyria&quot; (from the Greek word &quot;sfyrizo&quot; &#x27;whistle&#x27;), but only a few whistlers remain in the 21st century. &quot;Sfyria&quot; is &quot;a whistled version of spoken Greek, in which letters and syllables correspond to distinct tones and frequencies.&quot;

Beginning in late 1943, 1,000 Greek Jews were smuggled from Thessaloniki and Athens via the island by the Greek Resistance and British MI11 to Çeşme in neutral Turkey, thereby escaping the Holocaust in Greece.

Euboea is linked to the mainland by two bridges, one that runs through Chalcis and is also accessible from Thebes, and another which bypasses Chalcis and is accessed from Athens. All of Euboea&#x27;s modern bridges are suspended.

In the 1980s, the Dystos lake was filled with grass which was set on fire by farmers to make more farmland. This act caused devastation of much of the plants and the environment in that area. A part of the lake later regenerated. Also the municipalities of Anthidona and Avlida in the mid to late 20th century, which once were part of Boeotia, reverted to Chalcis. Since then, the postal codes have corresponded with the rest of Euboea, including Skyros. 

A week-long major forest fire in 2021 destroyed over 50,000 hectares of forest and agricultural land in the north of the island, one of the largest forest fires in modern Greek history.

==Mythology==
The promontory of Canaeum, which lies opposite the Malian Gulf, together with the neighbouring coast of Trachis, was the scene of the events connected with the death of Heracles, as described by Sophocles in the &quot;Trachiniae&quot;.

Based on the records of the 2nd century AD geographer Pausanias, it is suspected that the Titan god Crius is an indigenous deity.

==Demographics==

The population of the island, according to the census of 2001, was 198,130, making it the second most populous island of Greece. As a whole the Euboeans share a cultural identity similar to that of the people in the rest of Central Greece and speak a southern variety of Greek. In the southern part of the island there are Arvanite communities. Until the 1970s there were still monolingual speakers of Arvanitika in southern Euboea. As of the late 20th century, in southern Euboea there were about 60 villages inhabited by Arvanites. Sarakatsani and Vlachs could be found mainly in the mountainous areas in central and northern Euboea respectively, but nowadays they have abandoned the nomadic way of life and live permanently in the towns and villages across the island.

==Economics==

The mining areas include magnesite in Mantoudi and Limni, lignite in Aliveri and iron and nickel from Dirfys. Marble is mined north of Eretria which include &quot;Marmor Chalcidicum&quot; and asbestos in the northeastern part of Carystus in the Okhi mountain. The trees include chestnuts.

==Transport==
*Greek National Road 44, Cen., S, SE
*Greek National Road 77 NW, N, W, Cen.

==Local administration==

The island belongs to Euboea Prefecture which also includes two municipalities on the mainland, Anthidona and Avlida, as well as the island municipality of Skyros. At the 2001 census the prefecture had a population of 215,136 inhabitants, whereas the island itself had a population of 198,130. The prefecture&#x27;s land area is 4, whereas the total land area of the municipalities actually on the island is 3, which includes that of numerous small offshore islets (Petalioi) near Euboea&#x27;s southeastern tip.

<text>The Rutaceae () is a family, commonly known as the rue or citrus family, of flowering plants, usually placed in the order Sapindales.

Species of the family generally have flowers that divide into four or five parts, usually with strong scents. They range in form and size from herbs to shrubs and large trees.

The most economically important genus in the family is &quot;Citrus&quot;, which includes the orange (&quot;C.&quot; × &quot;sinensis&quot;), lemon (&quot;C.&quot; × &quot;limon&quot;), grapefruit (&quot;C.&quot; × &quot;paradisi&quot;), and lime (various). &quot;Boronia&quot; is a large Australian genus, some members of which are plants with highly fragrant flowers and are used in commercial oil production. Other large genera include &quot;Zanthoxylum,&quot; several species of which are cultivated for Sichuan pepper, &quot;Melicope&quot;, and &quot;Agathosma&quot;. About 160 genera are in the family Rutaceae.

== Characteristics ==
Most species are trees or shrubs, a few are herbs (the type genus &quot;Ruta&quot;, &quot;Boenninghausenia&quot; and &quot;Dictamnus&quot;), frequently aromatic with glands on the leaves, sometimes with thorns. The leaves are usually opposed and compound, and without stipules. Pellucid glands, a type of oil gland, are found in the leaves responsible for the aromatic smell of the family&#x27;s members; traditionally they have been the primary synapomorphic characteristic to identify the Rutaceae.

Flowers are bractless, solitary or in cyme, rarely in raceme, and mainly pollinated by insects. They are radially or (rarely) laterally symmetric, and generally hermaphroditic. They have four or five petals and sepals, sometimes three, mostly separate, eight to ten stamen (five in &quot;Skimmia&quot;, many in &quot;Citrus&quot;), usually separate or in several groups. Usually a single stigma with 2 to 5 united carpels, sometimes ovaries separate but styles combined.

The fruit of the Rutaceae are very variable: berries, drupes, hesperidia, samaras, capsules, and follicles all occur. Seed number also varies widely.

== Taxonomy ==
The family is closely related to the Sapindaceae, Simaroubaceae, and Meliaceae, and all are usually placed into the same order, although older systems separate that order into Rutales and Sapindales. The families Flindersiaceae and Ptaeroxylaceae are sometimes kept separate, but nowadays generally are placed in the Rutaceae, as are the former Cneoraceae.

===Subfamilies===
In 1896, Engler published a division of the family Rutaceae into seven subfamilies. One, Rhabdodendroideae, is no longer considered to belong to the Rutaceae, being treated as the segregate family Rhabdodendraceae, containing only the genus &quot;Rhabdodendron&quot;. Two monogeneric subfamilies, Dictyolomatoideae and Spathelioideae, are now included in the subfamily Cneoroideae, along with genera Engler placed in other families. The remaining four Engler subfamilies were Aurantioideae, Rutoideae, Flindersioideae and Toddalioideae. Engler&#x27;s division into subfamilies largely relied on the characteristics of the fruit, as did others used until molecular phylogenetic methods were applied.

Molecular methods have shown that only Aurantioideae can be clearly differentiated from other members of the family based on fruit. They have not supported the circumscriptions of Engler&#x27;s three other main subfamilies. In 2012, Groppo et al. divided Rutaceae into only two subfamilies, retaining Cneoroideae but placing all the remaining genera in a greatly enlarged subfamily Rutoideae &quot;s.l.&quot; A 2014 classification by Morton and Telmer also retained Engler&#x27;s Aurantioideae, but split the remaining Rutoideae &quot;s.l.&quot; into a smaller Rutoideae and a much larger Amyridoideae &quot;s.l.&quot;, containing most of Engler&#x27;s Rutoideae. Until 2021, molecular phylogenetic methods had only sampled between 20% and 40% of the genera of Rutaceae. A 2021 study by Appelhans et al. sampled almost 90% of the genera. The two main clades recognized by Groppo et al. in 2012 were upheld, but Morton and Telmer&#x27;s Rutoideae was paraphyletic and their Amyridoideae was polyphyletic and did not include the type genus. Applehans et al. divided the family into six subfamilies, shown below in the cladogram produced in their study. The large subfamily Zanthoxyloideae was shown to contain distinct clades, but the authors considered that a revised classification at the tribal level was not yet feasible at the time their paper was published.

== Notable species ==
The family is of great economic importance in warm temperate and subtropical climates for its numerous edible fruits of the genus &quot;Citrus&quot;, such as the orange, lemon, calamansi, lime, kumquat, mandarin and grapefruit.

Non-citrus fruits include the white sapote (&quot;Casimiroa edulis&quot;), orangeberry (&quot;Glycosmis pentaphylla&quot;), limeberry (&quot;Triphasia trifolia&quot;), and the bael (&quot;Aegle marmelos&quot;).

The curry tree, &quot;Murraya koenigii&quot;, is of culinary importance in the Indian subcontinent and elsewhere, as its leaves are used as a spice to flavour dishes. Spices are also made from a number of species in the genus &quot;Zanthoxylum&quot;, notably Sichuan pepper.

Other plants are grown in horticulture: &quot;Murraya&quot; and &quot;Skimmia&quot; species, for example. &quot;Ruta&quot;, &quot;Zanthoxylum&quot; and &quot;Casimiroa&quot; species are medicinals. Several plants are also used by the perfume industry, such as the Western Australian &quot;Boronia megastigma&quot;.

The genus &quot;Pilocarpus&quot; has species (&quot;P. jaborandi&quot;, and &quot;P. microphyllus&quot; from Brazil, and &quot;P. pennatifolius&quot; from Paraguay) from which the medicine pilocarpine, used to treat glaucoma, is extracted.

<doc id="79686" wikidata="Q733940" url="?curid=79686" title="Yankee Doodle">
<text>&quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; is a traditional song and nursery rhyme, the early versions of which predate the Seven Years&#x27; War and American Revolutionary War. It is often sung patriotically in the United States today. It is the state song of the U.S. state of Connecticut. Its Roud Folk Song Index number is 4501.

==Origin==

The tune of &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; is thought to be much older than the lyrics, being well known across western Europe, including England, France, Netherlands, Hungary, and Spain. The melody of the song may have originated from an Irish tune &quot;All the way to Galway&quot;, in which the second strain is identical to Yankee Doodle. There are rumors that the earliest words of &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; came from a Middle Dutch harvest song which is thought to have followed the same tune, supposedly dating back as far as 15th-century Holland. It supposedly contained mostly nonsense words in English and Dutch: &quot;Yanker, didel, doodle down, Diddle, dudel, lanther, Yanke viver, voover vown, &quot;Botermilk&quot; und &quot;tanther&quot;.&quot; Farm laborers in Holland were paid &quot;as much buttermilk (&quot;Botermelk&quot;) as they could drink, and a tenth (&quot;tanther&quot;) of the grain&quot;.

The term &quot;Doodle&quot; first appeared in English in the early 17th century and is thought to be derived from the Low German &quot;dudel,&quot; meaning &quot;playing music badly&quot;, or &quot;Dödel&quot;, meaning &quot;fool&quot; or &quot;simpleton&quot;. The &quot;Macaroni&quot; wig was an extreme fashion in the 1770s and became slang for being a fop. Dandies were men who placed particular importance upon physical appearance, refined language, and leisure hobbies. A self-made dandy was a British middle-class man who impersonated an aristocratic lifestyle. They notably wore silk strip cloth, stuck feathers in their hats, and carried two pocket watches with chains—&quot;one to tell what time it was and the other to tell what time it was not&quot;.

The macaroni wig was an example of such Rococo dandy fashion, popular in elite circles in Western Europe and much-mocked in the London press. The term &quot;macaroni&quot; was used to describe a fashionable man who dressed and spoke in an outlandishly affected and effeminate manner. The term pejoratively referred to a man who &quot;exceeded the ordinary bounds of fashion&quot; in terms of clothes, fastidious eating, and gambling.

In British conversation, the term &quot;Yankee doodle dandy&quot; implied unsophisticated misappropriation of upper-class fashion, as though simply sticking a feather in one&#x27;s cap would transform the wearer into a noble. Peter McNeil, a professor of fashion studies, claims that the British were insinuating that the colonists were lower-class men who lacked masculinity, emphasizing that the American men were womanly.

===Early versions===
The song was a pre-Revolutionary War song originally sung by British military officers to mock the disheveled, disorganized colonial &quot;Yankees&quot; with whom they served in the French and Indian War. It was written at Fort Crailo around 1755 by British Army surgeon Richard Shuckburgh while campaigning in Rensselaer, New York. The British troops sang it to mock their stereotype of the American soldier as a Yankee simpleton who thought that he was stylish if he simply stuck a feather in his cap. It was also popular among the Americans as a song of defiance, and they added verses to it that mocked the British and hailed George Washington as the Commander of the Continental army. By 1781, &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; had turned from being an insult to being a song of national pride.

According to one account, Shuckburgh wrote the original lyrics after seeing the appearance of Colonial troops under Colonel Thomas Fitch, the son of Connecticut Governor Thomas Fitch. According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, &quot;the current version seems to have been written in 1776 by Edward Bangs, a Harvard sophomore who also was a Minuteman.&quot; He wrote a ballad with 15 verses which circulated in Boston and surrounding towns in 1775 or 1776.

A bill was introduced to the House of Representatives on July 25, 1999, recognizing Billerica, Massachusetts, as &quot;America&#x27;s Yankee Doodle Town&quot;. After the Battle of Lexington and Concord, a Boston newspaper reported:

The earliest known version of the lyrics comes from 1755 or 1758 (the date of origin is disputed):

The sheet music which accompanies these lyrics reads, &quot;The Words to be Sung through the Nose, &amp; in the West Country drawl &amp; dialect.&quot; The tune also appeared in 1762 in one of America&#x27;s first comic operas &quot;The Disappointment&quot;, with bawdy lyrics about the search for Blackbeard&#x27;s buried treasure by a team from Philadelphia. An alternate verse that the British are said to have marched to is attributed to an incident involving Thomas Ditson of Billerica, Massachusetts. Ditson attempted to purchase a Brown Bess musket from a British soldier in the 47th Regiment of Foot in Boston in March 1775; after a group of the soldier&#x27;s comrades spotted the transaction as it was occurring, they tarred and feathered Ditson in order to prevent any such illegal purchases from happening in the future. Ditson eventually managed to secure a musket and fought at the Battles of Lexington and Concord. For this reason, the town of Billerica is called the home of &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;:

Another pro-British set of lyrics believed to have used the tune was published in June 1775 following the Battle of Bunker Hill:

&quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; was played at the British surrender at Saratoga in 1777. A variant is preserved in the 1810 edition of &quot;Gammer Gurton&#x27;s Garland: Or, The Nursery Parnassus&quot;, collected by Francis Douce, now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford:

==Full version==
The full version of the song as it is known today:

==Tune==
The tune shares with the English language nursery rhymes &quot;Simple Simon&quot;, &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;, and &quot;Lucy Locket&quot;. It also inspired the theme tune for the children&#x27;s television series, &quot;Barney &amp; the Backyard Gang&quot;, &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot;, and the 1960s US cartoon series &quot;Roger Ramjet&quot;. Danish band Toy-Box sampled the tune in their song &quot;E.T&quot;.

==Notable renditions==

The American state broadcaster Voice of America (VOA) uses the tune of Yankee Doodle as their interval signal. There is uncertainty over the origin of the VOA&#x27;s decision to use the tune. In his 1990 memoir &quot;Being Red&quot;, Howard Fast claimed that while working as the VOA&#x27;s chief news writer and news director in 1943, he selected &quot;as a joke&quot; Yankee Doodle for the broadcaster&#x27;s interval signal.

 I established contact at the Soviet embassy with people who spoke English and were willing to feed me important bits and pieces from their side of the wire. I had long ago, somewhat facetiously, suggested “Yankee Doodle” as our musical signal, and now that silly little jingle was a power cue, a note of hope everywhere on earth, conveyed by short wave as well as by our four-hour American BBC. When I sat down to write “Good morning, this is the Voice of America,” I now has a grasp of things.

<doc id="79693" wikidata="Q792596" url="?curid=79693" title="Axminster">
<text>Axminster is a market town and civil parish on the eastern border of the county of Devon in England. It is from the county town of Exeter. The town is built on a hill overlooking the River Axe which heads towards the English Channel at Axmouth, and is in the East Devon local government district. At the 2001 census, it had a population of 5,626, increasing to 5,761 at the 2011 census. The town contains two electoral wards (town and rural) whose combined population is 7,110. The market is still held every Thursday.

Axminster gave its name to a type of carpet. An Axminster-type power loom is capable of weaving high-quality carpets with many varying colours and patterns. While Axminster carpets are made in the town by Axminster Carpets Ltd, this type of carpet is now manufactured all over the world as well.

==History==

The town dates back to the Celtic times of around 300 BC. It lies on two major Roman roads: the Fosse Way from Lincoln to Seaton, and the Dorchester to Exeter road. There was a Roman fort on the crossroads at Woodbury Farm, just south of the present town. Axminster appears on the Peutinger Map, one of only 15 British towns on that Roman era map.

Axminster was recorded in the late 9th century as and in the Domesday Book of 1086 as . The name means &quot;monastery or large church by the River Axe&quot; and is a mixture of languages; the river name &quot;Axe&quot; has Celtic origins and is an Old English word.

There was allegedly a castle in the town, as reported in the 1600s by Sir William Pole, and believed to have been close to the current Market Square.

The later history of the town is very much linked to the carpet industry, started by Thomas Whitty at Court House near the church in 1755. The completion of the early hand-tufted carpets was marked by a peal of bells from the parish church as it took a great amount of time and labour to complete them. Axminster carpets continue to this day providing carpets for Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and other royal buildings.

In 1210, a charter was granted to the town that included the right to hold a weekly cattle market; this was held in the market square until it was moved to Trinity Square in 1834. It then moved in October 1912 to a site off South Street, where it was held for 94 years. It finally closed in 2006 in the aftermath of the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak. A building on the site then continued to be used for a general auction until all the buildings were demolished and replaced by a housing development.
The town was on the coaching route from London to Exeter. In 1760 a coaching inn named The George Hotel was opened on the corner of Lyme Street and Chard Street on the site of an old inn called the Cross Keys that was destroyed by fire in 1759. Over 16 coaches a day would stop at the hotel in its heyday for refreshments and to change horses. The building was refurbished in 2020. Axminster was on the route of The Trafalgar Way which is the name given to the historic route used to carry dispatches with the news of the Battle of Trafalgar overland from Falmouth, Cornwall, to the Admiralty in London in 1805, There is a plaque commemorating this fact in the town centre.

Part of the parish of Axminster had historically been an exclave of Dorset until the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, when it was fully incorporated into Devon.

Axminster railway station was opened on 19 July 1860, with the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) offering direct services between Queen Street station in Exeter and Yeovil. The station building was designed by the LSWR&#x27;s architect Sir William Tite in mock gothic style. In 1903, the branch line from Axminster to Lyme Regis was opened. This branch line was closed with the Beeching cuts, in the 1960s. One engine has been preserved on the Bluebell Line, in Sussex, while the station was dismantled and reconstructed at New Alresford, on the Watercress Line, in Hampshire.

Axminster is the southern starting point of the Taunton Stop Line, a World War II defensive line consisting of pillboxes and anti-tank obstacles, which runs north to the Somerset coast near Highbridge.

Nearby Kilmington was used as a location for the 1998 LWT adaptation of &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;. The celebrity chef and TV presenter Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has his River Cottage HQ at a farm in the Axe valley. His &quot;River Cottage Canteen&quot; was until 2021 located in the premises of the New Commercial Inn, owned by Palmer&#x27;s Brewery of Bridport, and which housed the ballroom of the town.

==Geography==
The hamlet of Abbey Gate lies to the south of the town near the A35 and A358 intersection.

<text>Richard (5 January 1209 – 2 April 1272) was an English prince who was King of the Romans from 1257 until his death in 1272. He was the second son of John, King of England, and Isabella, Countess of Angoulême. Richard was nominal Count of Poitou from 1225 to 1243, and he also held the title Earl of Cornwall since 1225. He was one of the wealthiest men in Europe and joined the Barons&#x27; Crusade, where he achieved success as a negotiator for the release of prisoners and assisted with the building of the citadel in Ascalon.

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was born 5 January 1209 at Winchester Castle, the second son of John, King of England, and Isabella, Countess of Angoulême. He was made High Sheriff of Berkshire at age eight, was styled Count of Poitou from 1225 and in the same year, at the age of sixteen, his brother King Henry III gave him Cornwall as a birthday present, making him High Sheriff of Cornwall. Richard&#x27;s revenues from Cornwall helped make him one of the wealthiest men in Europe. Though he campaigned on King Henry&#x27;s behalf in Poitou and Brittany, and served as regent three times, relations were often strained between the brothers in the early years of Henry&#x27;s reign, once Henry took rule for himself. Richard rebelled against him three times and had to be bought off with lavish gifts.

In 1225, Richard traded with Gervase de Tintagel, swapping the land of Merthen (originally part of the manor of Winnianton) for Tintagel Castle. It has been suggested that a castle was built on the site by Richard in 1233 to establish a connection with the Arthurian legends that were associated by Geoffrey of Monmouth with the area. Richard hoped that, in this way, he could gain the Cornish people&#x27;s trust. The castle itself held no real strategic value.

The dating to the period of Richard has superseded Ralegh Radford&#x27;s interpretation which attributed the earliest elements of the castle to Earl Reginald de Dunstanville and later elements to Earl Richard. Sidney Toy, however, has suggested an earlier period of construction for the castle.

===Marriage to Isabel, 1231–1240===
In March 1231, he married Isabel Marshal, the wealthy widow of the Earl of Gloucester, much to the displeasure of his brother King Henry, who feared the Marshal family because they were rich, influential, and often opposed to him, as did Richard by this point. The joining of Richard to the Marshal family increased the power behind these rebellions, and the potential risk for Henry. Richard became stepfather to Isabel&#x27;s six children from her first husband. In that same year he acquired his main residence, Wallingford Castle in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), and spent much money on developing it. He had other favoured properties at Marlow and Cippenham and was a notable lord of the manor at Earls Risborough, all in Buckinghamshire.

Isabel and Richard had four children, of whom only their son, Henry of Almain, survived to adulthood. Richard opposed Simon de Montfort and rose in rebellion in 1238 to protest against the marriage of his sister, Eleanor, to Simon. Once again he was placated with rich gifts. When Isabel was on her deathbed in 1240, she asked to be buried next to her first husband at Tewkesbury, but Richard had her interred at Beaulieu Abbey instead. As a pious gesture, however, he sent her heart to Tewkesbury.

===On Crusade and marriage to Sanchia, 1240–1243===
Later that year, Richard departed for the Holy Land, leading the second host of crusaders to arrive during the Barons&#x27; Crusade. He did not fight any battles but managed to negotiate for the release of prisoners (most notably Amaury de Montfort) and the burials of crusaders killed at a battle in Gaza in November 1239. He also refortified Ascalon, which had been demolished by Saladin. On his return from the Holy Land, Richard visited his sister Isabella, the empress of Frederick II.

After the birth of Prince Edward in 1239, provisions were made in case of the king&#x27;s death, which favoured the Queen and her Savoyard relatives and excluded Richard. To keep him from becoming discontented King Henry and Queen Eleanor brought up the idea of a marriage with Eleanor&#x27;s sister Sanchia shortly after his return on 28 January 1242. On his journey to the Holy Land, Richard had met Sanchia in Provence, where he was warmly welcomed by her father Raymond Berenger IV. Richard and Sanchia were married at Westminster in November 1243. Marriage to Sanchia had the advantage of tying Richard closely to the royal couple and their interests.

Eleanor and Sanchia&#x27;s youngest sister Beatrice married Charles I of Naples, while their oldest sister Margaret had married Louis IX of France. The marriages of the kings of France and England and their two brothers to the four sisters from Provence improved the relationship between the two countries that led to the Treaty of Paris in 1259.

===Poitou and Sicily===
Richard was appointed count of Poitou some time before August 1225. However, Richard&#x27;s claims to Gascony and Poitou were never more than nominal, and in 1241, King Louis IX of France invested his own brother Alphonse with Poitou. Moreover, Richard and Henry&#x27;s mother, Isabella of Angoulême, claimed to have been insulted by the French queen. They were encouraged to recover Poitou by their stepfather, Hugh X of Lusignan, but the expedition turned into a military fiasco after Lusignan betrayed them. Richard conceded Poitou around December 1243.

Pope Innocent IV offered Richard the crown of Sicily, but according to Matthew Paris, he responded to the extortionate price by saying, &quot;You might as well say, &#x27;I will sell or give you the moon, rise up and take it&#x27;&quot;. Instead, his brother King Henry attempted to purchase the kingdom for his own son Edmund.

===Elected King of Germany, 1257===

Richard was elected in 1257 as King of Germany by four of the seven German Electoral Princes:

*Konrad von Hochstaden, the Archbishop of Cologne; 
*, Archbishop of Mainz; 
*Louis II, the Count Palatine;
*Ottokar II, King of Bohemia.

His candidacy was opposed by Alfonso X of Castile, who was supported by three electors:

*Albert I, Duke of Saxony; 
*John I, Margrave of Brandenburg; 
*Arnold II of Isenburg, Archbishop of Trier.

Pope Alexander IV and King Louis IX of France favoured Alfonso, but both were ultimately convinced by the powerful relatives of Richard&#x27;s wife Sanchia, and his sister-in-law, Eleanor of Provence, to support Richard. Ottokar II of Bohemia, who at first voted for Richard but later elected Alfonso, eventually agreed to support the Earl of Cornwall, thus establishing the required simple majority. So Richard had to bribe only four of them, but this came at a huge cost of 28,000 marks. On 17 May 1257, Konrad von Hochstaden, Archbishop of Cologne, himself crowned Richard King of the Romans in Aachen; however, like his lordships in Gascony and Poitou, his title never held much significance, and he made only four brief visits to Germany between 1257 and 1269.

===Later life, death and successors===

He founded Burnham Abbey in Buckinghamshire in 1263, and the , Aachen in 1266.

He joined King Henry in fighting against Simon de Montfort&#x27;s rebels in the Second Barons&#x27; War (1264–1267). After the shattering royalist defeat at the Battle of Lewes, Richard took refuge in a windmill, was discovered, and was imprisoned until September 1265.

Richard bought the feudal barony of Trematon in 1270.

In March 1271 Richard&#x27;s son and heir Henry of Almain was murdered in Viterbo at the Church of San Silvestro by Guy and Simon de Montfort the Younger in revenge for their father and brother Henry de Montfort being killed at the Battle of Evesham. Simon and Guy were Richard&#x27;s nephews and sources say that Richard did not recover from the shock. In December 1271, he had a stroke. His right side was paralysed and he lost the ability to speak. On 2 April 1272, Richard died at Berkhamsted Castle in Hertfordshire. He was buried next to his second wife Sanchia of Provence and Henry of Almain, his son by his first wife, at Hailes Abbey, which he had founded.

After his death, a power struggle ensued in Germany, which only ended in 1273 with the emergence of Rudolph I of Habsburg, the first scion of a long-lasting noble family to rule the empire. In Cornwall, Richard was succeeded by Edmund, son of his second wife Sanchia.

==Wives and progeny==
Richard of Cornwall married three times and had six legitimate children, none of whom themselves had children, and he also had illegitimate progeny:

===First wife===

Richard married first, on 30 March 1231 at Fawley, Buckinghamshire, to Isabel Marshal (d. 1240) was the daughter of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, by his wife Isabel de Clare, who in turn was daughter of Sir Richard &quot;Strongbow&quot; de Clare and Aoife MacMurrough. Isabel Marshal died on 17 January 1240 while giving birth at Berkhamsted Castle and was buried at Beaulieu Abbey. By Isabel Marshal he had four children, of whom only one reached adulthood:
*John of Cornwall (31 January 1232 – 22 September 1232), born and died at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, buried at Reading Abbey.
*Isabel of Cornwall (c. 9 September 1233 – 6 October 1234), born and died at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, buried at Reading Abbey.
*Henry of Cornwall (2 November 1235 – 13 March 1271). Known as &quot;Henry of Almain&quot; (Germany). He was buried at Hailes Abbey in Gloucestershire. He had no children.
*Nicholas of Cornwall (b. &amp; d. 17 January 1240 at Berkhamsted Castle), died shortly after birth; buried at Beaulieu Abbey with his mother.

===Second wife===

Richard&#x27;s second marriage took place nearly four years after the death of his first wife. His new bride, whom he married in Westminster Abbey on 23 November 1243, was Sanchia of Provence ( – 9 November 1261), the third of four daughters of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence, by his wife Beatrice of Savoy. She was a younger sister of the Queens of France and England, while the youngest sister would later become Queen of Sicily. The match was arranged by Sanchia&#x27;s elder sister Eleanor of Provence, wife of Richard&#x27;s elder brother King Henry III of England. Sanchia died on 9 November 1261 at Berkhamsted Castle and was buried 15 November in Hailes Abbey in Gloucestershire. By Sanchia of Provence, Richard had a further two sons:
*unnamed son (Jul 1246 – 15 Aug 1246), died in infancy.
*Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall (26 December 1249 – before 25 September 1300), usually styled &quot;Edmund of Almain&quot;. Edmund married Margaret de Clare (1250 – shortly before November 1312), daughter of Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, but by her had no children.

===Third wife===
The third marriage of Richard was to Beatrice of Falkenburg, said to be one of the most beautiful women of her time. Her father, Dietrich I, Count of Falkenburg, of Valkenburg Castle in the Netherlands, was a supporter of Richard&#x27;s claim to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire. The two men fought on the same side in a battle, at which time Richard met Beatrice and grew besotted by her. They married on 16 June 1269 at Kaiserslautern, when she was about fifteen years old while he was in his sixty-first year and his youngest child was only four years older than Beatrice. Richard doted on his young wife, and she had a high regard for him, but they produced no children. Beatrice survived Richard by only five years and never married again. She died on 17 October 1277 and was buried before the high altar at the Church of the Grey Friars in Oxford.

===Illegitimate children===
Richard had several documented out-of-wedlock children. One of Richard&#x27;s mistresses was Joan de Vautort, widow of Ralph de Vautort (d. 1267), feudal baron of Harberton, Devon and Trematon, Cornwall. Joan later married Sir Alexander Okeston, lord of the manor of Modbury in Devon, a part of the Vautorts&#x27; feudal barony of Harberton that had been granted him by Roger de Vautort. Joan bore Alexander a son and heir, Sir James Okeston.

By Joan de Vautort or other mistresses, the Earl of Cornwall had at least three sons and a daughter as follows:
* Philip of Cornwall, a priest.
* Sir Richard of Cornwall, who received a grant from his half-brother Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall (d. 1300), in which he was called &quot;brother&quot;. He married Joan, allegedly daughter of John Fitzalan III, and by her had three sons and a daughter. He was slain by an arrow at the Siege of Berwick in 1296. His daughter Joan of Cornwall married Sir John Howard, from whom the Howard family, Dukes of Norfolk, are descended.
* Sir Walter of Cornwall, who received a grant of the royal manor of Brannel, Cornwall, from his half-brother Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall, in which he was called &quot;brother&quot;. He was ancestor of the Cornwalls of Branell.
* Joan of Cornwall, daughter of Joan de Vautort, in 1283 received a grant from her half-brother Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall, in which she was called &quot;sister&quot;. The younger Joan married (1st) Richard de Champernoun and (2nd) Sir Peter de Fishacre of Combe Fishacre and Coleton Fishacre, Devon, having no issue by the second. Her childless half-brother Sir James Okeston made her son (or grandson) Richard de Champernoun his heir.

<text>The Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference (NSIC) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division II level, which operates in the Upper Midwest of the United States. Nine of its members are in Minnesota, with three members in South Dakota, two members in North Dakota, and one member in Nebraska. It was founded in 1932. With the recent NSIC expansion, the original six member schools have been reunited. 

The conference sponsors 18 sports; ten for women and eight for men. Both men and women compete in basketball, cross country, golf, and indoor and outdoor track and field. Men compete in baseball, football, and wrestling. Women compete in soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, and volleyball. The NSIC is the only Division II conference that sponsors soccer for women but not men (two other D-II conferences do not sponsor soccer for either sex).

==History==
The Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference was founded in 1932 as the Northern Teachers Athletic Conference. Charter members included Bemidji State Teachers College (Bemidji State University), Duluth State Teachers College (University of Minnesota Duluth), Mankato State Teachers College (Minnesota State University, Mankato), Moorhead State Teachers College (Minnesota State University Moorhead), St. Cloud State Teachers College (St. Cloud State University), and Winona State Teachers College (Winona State University). In 1942 the conference name was changed to the State Teacher&#x27;s College Conference of Minnesota. The conference switched its name to the Northern Intercollegiate Conference (NIC) in 1962. In the spring of 1992 the NSIC was formed out of the merger of the NIC, the men&#x27;s conference, and the women&#x27;s Northern Sun Conference (NSC).

In 1992, the NSIC joined NCAA Division II after being long time
members of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA).

In the 1998–99 academic year, the NSIC became an expanded eight-team league from a previous seven-member conference by adding Wayne State College, and in 1999–2000 became a 10-member conference by adding Concordia University, St. Paul, and the University of Minnesota Crookston. The conference existed as an eight-member league from 2004–05 until 2005–06 with the departure of Minnesota–Duluth to the now defunct North Central Conference, and the University of Minnesota Morris to NCAA Division III. The University of Mary and Upper Iowa University were admitted in the fall of 2006 to again expand the NSIC to 10 members.

In 2007 the NSIC Board of Directors voted to expand the conference to 14 schools. League presidents voted to accept into membership Augustana College (now Augustana University), St. Cloud State, Minnesota–Duluth, and Minnesota State. These four schools were members of the North Central Conference which disbanded after the 2007–2008 academic year. They became official members of the NSIC on July 1, 2008.

On January 20, 2010, the NSIC Board of Directors voted to expand the conference again, this time to 16 members. The league accepted into membership the University of Sioux Falls and Minot State University. Both schools moved from the NAIA, with USF leaving the Great Plains Athletic Conference, and Minot State leaving the Dakota Athletic Conference. The two schools became active members in the 2012–13 academic year.

The NSIC and its member institutions have been members of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). Mankato State won the NAIA wrestling national titles in 1958 and 1959, while Moorhead State won a wrestling national title in 1964. Forty-one wrestlers have claimed individual national titles in wrestling. Nine individuals have won national titles in Men&#x27;s Swimming and Diving.

<text>Anchors Aweigh is a 1945 American musical comedy film starring Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson, and Gene Kelly, with songs by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn. Directed by George Sidney, the film also features José Iturbi, Pamela Britton, and Dean Stockwell.

The plot concerns two sailors on a four-day shore leave in Hollywood, who meet a young boy and his aunt, an aspiring young singer, and try to help her get an audition with the famed pianist and conductor Iturbi at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In a sequence, Kelly dances with the animated Jerry Mouse from &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;.

The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning one, for best scoring. It received highly positive reviews and became a financial success.

==Plot==
Gunner&#x27;s Mate Second Class Joe Brady and Seaman First Class Clarence Doolittle are United States Navy sailors who have a four-day leave in San Diego, which they decide to spend in Hollywood. Joe has his heart set on making up for eight months at sea with his girl, Lola. Clarence, a shy choir boy turned sailor, asks Joe to teach him how to get girls. Donald, a little boy who wants to join the navy, is found wandering around the boulevard by a policeman, who takes him to the station. Clarence and Joe end up being picked up by the police to help convince Donald to go home. After the two sailors wait at home and entertain the little boy, his Aunt Susie arrives. Clarence is smitten with the beautiful, friendly young woman from the beginning. Susan goes on to tell them that she has been trying to become a singer, and longs to perform with the famous pianist and conductor José Iturbi. Trying to impress Susan with Clarence, Joe lies that Clarence is a personal friend of Iturbi, and can arrange an audition for her with him. That night they go out to a café, where Clarence meets a girl from Brooklyn and they hit it off. The next day Joe visits Donald&#x27;s school and tells the kids the story of how he earned his medal, by bringing happiness to a lonesome young king (portrayed by the animated Jerry Mouse from Tom and Jerry) and joy to his kingdom.

Meanwhile, both Clarence and Joe have been trying to get into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios to find Iturbi, with no luck. When all hope seems lost, the pair seek to come clean with Susan and tell her there is no audition, but fail at doing so. On their last day of leave Susan runs into Iturbi in the studio commissary, who has no idea who she is. Devastated, she tells him the whole story. Taken with her charm, beauty, and sincerity, he agrees to get her a screen test, which turns out smashing. The movie ends with Iturbi conducting the Navy band while its choir sings &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; and Joe and Susan, and Clarence and the &quot;Girl from Brooklyn,&quot; kiss.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was written by Natalie Marcin (story) and Isobel Lennart (screenplay), and directed by George Sidney. It was the first of three buddy pictures teaming the cocky dancing Kelly with the (against type) shy, singing Sinatra, followed by &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; and &quot;On the Town&quot;, both in 1949. The production tried to mix some of the more successful story elements and set-pieces from earlier MGM musical hits, such as &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944).

The movie is remembered for the musical number in which Gene Kelly dances seamlessly with the animated Jerry Mouse (voiced by Sara Berner). Tom Cat appears briefly as a butler in the sequence supervised by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. The animation was entirely undertaken by Kenneth Muse, Ray Patterson and Ed Barge. Originally, the producers wanted to use Mickey Mouse for this segment. Some sources claim Walt Disney initially agreed to loan out Mickey, but Roy Disney rejected the deal. According to Bob Thomas&#x27;s book on Roy Disney, the studio was in debt after World War II and they were focusing on trying to release their own films out on time. According to Roy, they had no business making cartoons for other people. Kelly next went to Fred Quimby, the head of MGM&#x27;s cartoon studio. Quimby was also not interested, but Kelly persisted, reportedly showing up at Hanna and Barbera&#x27;s office to press the case. The dance sequence required meticulous storyboarding; after the live dancing was filmed, the animators used rotoscoping to painstakingly match the animated character&#x27;s movement to Kelly&#x27;s, even down to their shadows cast on the polished dance floor.

The film offers rare color glimpses of the wartime MGM studio, including the Thalberg Building, the front gate, the backlot, the commissary, and one of the scoring stages, which included an on-screen performance by real members of the MGM studio orchestra. During the soundstage scenes the operation of MGM&#x27;s latest camera mounted on a heavy boom is extensively demonstrated, including a side-bolted cutout viewfinder for the cinematographer to line up the shots and the operators deftly swiveling the pan controls or pulling the focus.

There is also a memorable exterior scene at the Hollywood Bowl, where Sinatra sings &quot;I Fall in Love Too Easily&quot;, after Iturbi and a group of young pianists have performed an arrangement of Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2&quot;. In the audition scene with Iturbi, Grayson sings a special arrangement by Earl Brent for coloratura soprano and orchestra of the waltz from Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Serenade for Strings&quot;. At the film&#x27;s end Iturbi conducts the United States Navy Band for a patriotic rendition of &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;. Some of the scenes in this film were later featured in the &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; (1974) tributes to MGM.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was highly popular at the box office, and extremely profitable to MGM. According to company records it earned $4,498,000 in the US and Canada and $2,977,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $2,123,000.

===Critical reviews===
Contemporary reviews were overwhelmingly positive.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Another humdinger of a musical has been produced by Joe Pasternak for Metro ... for a popular entertainment, &#x27;Anchors Aweigh&#x27; is hard to beat.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;solid musical fare for all situations. The production numbers are zingy; the songs are extremely listenable; the color treatment outstanding.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote: &quot;Very good mass entertainment. Photographed in Technicolor, the production is extremely lavish, has good comedy, a romance, tuneful songs, and effective dancing. The story is thin, but it has some human interest, and there are so many humorous situations that one is kept laughing most of the way.&quot; &quot;Film Daily&quot; wrote: &quot;Everything that could possibly be crammed into a musical is in evidence in this production ... It is hard to think of an MGM musical excelling it. There is no reason why the film should not gain recognition as one of the year&#x27;s best of its type.&quot;

Rotten Tomatoes gives a score of 53% based on 15 reviews.

<doc id="79703" wikidata="Q1624178" url="?curid=79703" title="Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference">
<text>The Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division II level. The conference was originally formed in 1951 as the State Teachers Conference, and was temporarily named the Pennsylvania State Teachers College Conference in 1956 before being assuming its current name in 1964.

The conference&#x27;s 17 full-time members include 16 based in Pennsylvania and one in West Virginia. The conference&#x27;s headquarters are in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania and staffed by a commissioner, two assistant commissioners, and a director of media relations.

==History==
The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education organized the conference in 1951 to promote competition in men&#x27;s sports amongst the system&#x27;s 14 universities.

In 1977, following growing interest, the conference was expanded to offer competition in women&#x27;s sports. From its inception, each conference member selected its own competitive division within the NCAA (I, II, or III).

In 1980, however, the presidents voted to reclassify the entire conference to Division II within the NCAA.
Membership remained unchanged until the conference announced on June 18, 2007, that it had invited three private universities—Gannon University and Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pennsylvania and C.W. Post of Brookville, New York—to join the conference. Gannon and Mercyhurst left the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference to join the PSAC, effective July 1, 2008. C.W. Post became an associate member for football and field hockey.

In 2010, Seton Hill University was accepted to join the conference as an associate member for field hockey. With the transition of West Chester from Division I to Division II, the number of teams competing in field hockey increased from 10 to 12 for the 2011 season.

On August 19, 2012, the PSAC announced that Seton Hill and the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, formerly members of the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC), would become full members beginning with the 2013–14 school year. This announcement was fallout from a split in the WVIAC that ultimately led to the formation of the Mountain East Conference (MEC). Although Seton Hill was one of the schools that initially broke away from the WVIAC, it chose not to join the MEC. The arrival of these two schools brought the PSAC to 18 full members, making it the largest NCAA all-sports conference in terms of membership at that time. While two other conferences briefly expanded to more members, the D-II Lone Star Conference to 19 in 2019–20 and the D-III USA South Athletic Conference to the same number in 2021–22, both have since reduced their memberships to less than 18, once again giving the PSAC the largest membership of any NCAA all-sports conference.

In March 2018, charter member Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, facing crises in enrollment, graduation rates, and finances, announced that it would leave NCAA Division II and the PSAC at the end of the 2017–18 school year. The school had dropped football in December 2017.

Later that year, the conference announced that it would expand into West Virginia, bringing in Shepherd University from the MEC as a full member effective with the 2019–20 school year. Shepherd is the first full PSAC member outside of Pennsylvania.

As of April 4, 2024, Mercyhurst announced that it will leave the PSAC to transition to NCAA Division I and join the Northeast Conference, beginning the 2024–25 academic year.

===Role in Division I conference realignment===
The PSAC played a little-known but nonetheless significant role in the history of NCAA Division I conference realignment. In 1986, the conference was seeking a way out of a football scheduling conundrum. The PSAC had 14 members at the time, and had been split into divisions for decades. One of the methods it historically used to determine a football champion involved a championship game between the winners of its two divisions. However, due to NCAA limits on regular-season games, every PSAC team had to leave a schedule spot open, with only the two division winners getting to play all of their allowed regular-season games. Then-conference commissioner Tod Eberle asked Dick Yoder, then athletic director at West Chester and member of the Division II council, to draft NCAA legislation that would allow the PSAC to play a conference title game that would be exempt from regular-season limits. The initial draft required that a qualifying league have 14 members and play a round-robin schedule within each division; only the PSAC then qualified.

Before Yoder formally introduced the proposal, he was approached by the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association, which was interested in co-sponsoring the legislation because it was also split into football divisions and wanted the option of a championship game. Since the CIAA then had 12 members, Yoder changed the legislation to require 12 members instead of 14. Although at the time all NCAA legislation had to be approved by the entire membership, regardless of divisional alignment, the proposal passed with little notice. It was generally seen as a non-issue by Division I-A (now FBS) schools since no conference in that group then had more than 10 members. While the PSAC planned to stage its first exempt title game in 1988, it decided against doing so at that time because the D-II playoffs expanded from 8 to 16 teams that season, and it feared that the result of a title game could cost the league a playoff berth. The new NCAA rule would not see its first use until the Southeastern Conference took advantage of it by expanding to 12 members in 1991 and launching a title game the following year. In 2014, then-&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Andy Staples said that the rule &quot;helped dictate the terms of conference realignment for more than 20 years.&quot;

<text>The Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (RMAC), commonly known as the Rocky Mountain Conference (RMC) from approximately 1910 through the late 1960s, is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division II level, which operates in the western United States. Most member schools are in Colorado, with additional members in Nebraska, New Mexico, South Dakota, and Utah.

==History==
Founded in 1909, the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference is the fifth oldest active college athletic conference in the United States, the oldest in NCAA Division II, and the sixth to be founded after the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the Big Ten Conference, the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the Ohio Athletic Conference, and the Missouri Valley Conference. For its first 30 years, the RMAC was considered a major conference, equivalent to today&#x27;s NCAA Division I, before seven of its larger members left in 1938 to form the Mountain States Conference, also called the Skyline Conference.

The original name of Colorado Faculty Athletic Conference was changed to Rocky Mountain Faculty Athletic Conference (RMFAC) on May 7, 1910. The presidents assumed control of the league from the faculty in 1967 and changed the name to Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference. The Colorado Athletic Conference dissolved in 1996, with the RMAC absorbing the remaining CAC teams. The RMAC became an NCAA member in 1992 after competing in the NAIA through 1991.

===Timeline===
* 1909: On 6 March 1909, the Colorado Faculty Athletic Conference was formed. The four charter members were: the University of Colorado, Colorado Agricultural College (now Colorado State University), Colorado College, and the Colorado School of Mines.
* 1910: After its debut season, the league changed its name to the Rocky Mountain Faculty Athletic Conference (RMFAC). The University of Denver and the University of Utah joined the league, but Colorado College dropped out after a falling out with Colorado Mines. Membership was at five schools.
* 1914: Colorado College re-joined the RMFAC. Utah State University also joined the league to bring membership up to seven.
* 1917: Montana State University joined the RMFAC as the eighth member.
* 1918: Brigham Young University (BYU) joined the RMFAC as the ninth member.
* 1921: The University of Wyoming joined the RMFAC to bring membership up to ten.
* 1924: Western State College (now Western Colorado University) and the University of Northern Colorado joined the RMFAC, bringing membership up to 12 members.
* 1937: Colorado, Colorado State, Brigham Young, Utah, Utah State, Wyoming, and Denver left the conference to form the Skyline Conference. The five remaining members of the RMFAC were Colorado College, Colorado Mines, Montana State, Northern Colorado, and Western State.
* 1948: Idaho State University joined the RMFAC as the sixth member.
* 1956: Adams State College (now Adams State University) joined the RMFAC as the seventh member.
* 1958: Idaho State left the RMFAC, and membership was brought back down to six.
* 1959: Montana State left the RMFAC, and membership was brought back down to five.
* 1967: The RMFAC changed its name to the current Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (RMAC). Eleven schools joined the conference in 1967. They were: Emporia State University, Fort Hays State University, Fort Lewis College, the University of Nebraska at Omaha (now athletically branded as Omaha), Pittsburg State University, the University of Southern Colorado (now Colorado State University Pueblo), Southern Utah State University (now Southern Utah University), Regis College (now Regis University), Washburn University, Western New Mexico University and Westminster College (now Westminster University) of Utah.

* 1968: New Mexico Highlands University joined the RMAC.
* 1969: New Mexico Highlands left the RMAC due to financial aid restrictions.
* 1972: For economic reasons, the two divisions were split into two separate conferences. The Mountain Division kept the RMAC name while the Plains Division became known as the Great Plains Athletic Conference. The two allied conferences worked under the name of the Mountain and Plains Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MPIAA). RMAC membership stood at eight with Adams State, Colorado Mines, Fort Lewis, Regis, Southern Utah State, Western New Mexico, Western State, and Westminster. Northern Colorado ended up leaving the association to become independent.

<doc id="79707" wikidata="Q1638847" url="?curid=79707" title="Massachusetts Route 128">
<text>Route 128, known as the Yankee Division Highway, is an expressway in the U.S. state of Massachusetts maintained by the Highway Division of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). Spanning , it is one of two beltways (the other being Interstate 495 [I-495]) around Boston, and is known as the &quot;inner&quot; beltway, especially around areas where it is or less outside of Boston. The route&#x27;s current southern terminus is at the junction of I-95 and I-93 in Canton, and it is concurrent with I-95 around Boston for before it leaves the Interstate and continues on its own in a northeasterly direction towards Cape Ann. The northern terminus lies in Gloucester a few hundred feet from the Atlantic Ocean. All but the northernmost are a freeway, with the remainder being an expressway. Its concurrency with I-95 makes up most of its length.

Originally designated in 1927 along a series of surface streets, Route 128 provided a circumferential route around the city of Boston. The original route extended from the seaport of Gloucester, on the North Shore, to the beach resort community of Hull on the South Shore. Construction of the present circumferential highway began in Gloucester in the early 1950s and progressed southward, in part on new alignments and in part by the improvement of older roads, and came to completion with the final link into the Southeast Expressway (Route 3/John Fitzgerald Expressway/Pilgrim Highway) at a three-way flying junction known as the Braintree Split. With the completion of the final segment of the Yankee Division Highway in Braintree in 1960, the segment of Route 128 through Braintree, Weymouth and Hingham was rerouted to run concurrently with Route 3 on the Southeast Expressway/Pilgrim Highway between the Braintree Split (Route 3 exit 42 [old exit 19], Route 128 exit 67) and exit 35 (old exit 14), then along Pond Street in Norwell to Queen Anne&#x27;s Corner on the Hingham–Norwell line, retaining its original route from Queen Anne&#x27;s corner to its terminus in Hull. Subsequent upgrades on the northern segment in the 1960s completed a full freeway from Braintree in the south to Gloucester in the north.

In local culture, &quot;Route 128&quot; is generally recognized as the demarcation between the more urban inner suburbs and the less densely developed suburbs surrounding the city of Boston. It also approximately delimits the region served by the rapid transit and trolley system operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). It is furthermore used to reference the high-technology industry that developed from the 1960s to the 1980s in the suburban areas along the highway.

==Route description==

=== Concurrency with I-95 (Canton–Peabody) ===
Route 128 begins in the south in Norfolk County, at the interchange with I-93, I-95, and U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Canton. It immediately begins as a freeway. Until the 1990s, its southern terminus was located at the junction of I-93, US 1, and Route 3 (the Braintree Split) in Braintree. At this present-day terminus, Route 128 runs concurrently with I-95, and follows the mileage-based exit numbering scheme used by I-95 as it enters Massachusetts from Pawtucket, Rhode Island. It also begins a wrong-way concurrency with US 1; as Route 128 and I-95 are signed traveling north, US 1 is signed traveling south, and vice versa. US 1 splits onto its own roadbed at exit 29 (old exit 15) in Dedham.

==== The decision to route Interstate 95 through Route 128 ====
In response to the outcome of the 1970 Boston Transportation Planning Review, Massachusetts focused federal highway funding on public mass transportation rather than building new highways through Boston and the inner suburbs (&quot;inside of Route 128&quot;), cancelling plans for completion of a northeast Expressway and construction of a southwest expressway to carry I-95 through downtown Boston. This policy cascaded into designation of the segment of the Yankee Division Highway between the existing I-95 junction in Canton and the new I-95 junction in Peabody as I-95 rather than building a new highway to complete the connection, coupled with a decision to extend I-93 southward along the Central Artery and John Fitzgerald Expressway and onto the southern end of the Yankee Division Highway to the I-95 junction in Canton. After completion of the I-95/Route 128 interchange in Peabody in 1988, the State Highway Department changed the numbers of all exits south of the newly completed junction to those of the respective Interstate Highway designations. Since then, the highway has had three sets of exit numbers: I-93 exits 7–1 from the southern terminus to the I-95 junction in Canton, I-95 exits 26–64 (old exits 12–45) from the I-95 junction in Canton to the I-95 junction in Peabody, and the original Route 128 exits 37–55 (old exits 29–12) from the I-95 junction in Peabody to the northern terminus. The interchange with I-93 in Woburn, which was Route 128 exit 37 before the renumbering, became I-93 exit 37 (now exit 28) in the renumbering and thus coincidentally retained its number until the switchover with the mileage-based system in 2021. Along with other highways in the commonwealth, exits were renumbered with a mileage-based system in 2021.

As a result of this political decision, about two thirds of Route 128 runs in tandem with I-95 from Canton north to Peabody, and after I-95 splits off and continues north from Peabody toward New Hampshire, Route 128 runs eastward on its own right-of-way from Peabody to Gloucester. The I-95 and I-93 signage were added in the mid-1970s when plans to construct I-95 through Boston, directly connecting the two I-95/Route 128 interchanges, were cancelled leaving a gap filled using Route 128. An unused cloverleaf in Canton, partially removed circa 1977, was one of the leftover structures from this plan as well as the existing expressway (part of US 1 since 1989).

The decision to reroute I-95 onto Route 128 rather than building a new highway inside of Route 128 has contributed to three significant problems.

* At the junction in Canton, I-95 northbound uses the original cloverleaf, which is fairly tight, to transition from the southern segment to the Yankee Division Highway. More than a few unsuspecting truckers have entered the cloverleaf at full highway speed and thus managed to flip over their rigs. As a result, the cloverleaf has been referred to as &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve&quot; to locals.
* The I-95 overhead traffic also has become a major contributor to congestion on the segment of the highway known as I-95.
* The Southeast Expressway, as the only highway coming into Boston from the south, carries more than double its capacity on a daily basis. The highway is prone to some of the worst traffic in the region, as all traffic from south of the city (coming from three different highways) must merge onto this one route.

The political decision not to build new highways inside of Route 128 also led to abandonment of plans to extend the US 3 freeway from its current interchange with the Yankee Division Highway in Burlington to a junction with Route 2 in Lexington as originally planned. This decision caused a temporary reroute of US 3 onto the Yankee Division Highway, but in the opposite direction, to connect with its original route, one interchange to the north of the current junction, to become permanent.

A metropolitan planning organization for the Boston area studied the Route 128/I-95 Corridor from approximately 2005 to 2010. The study focused on the heavily congested section from I-90 (Newton) to US 3 (Burlington), and was completed in November 2010. As of 2010, the highway carried over 200,000 vehicles per day. Some possible improvements to Route 128 include HOV Lanes, reconstruction of shoulders, ramp metering, bus on shoulder, and fiber optic traffic system improvements. More studies will need to be completed before projects will begin.

=== Northern end (Peabody–Gloucester) ===
The segment of the highway that still carries the sole designation as Route 128, which is a four-lane freeway for most of its length, was not originally built as a freeway. Many junctions in this segment were constructed as signaled intersections at grade in the 1950s and subsequently reconstructed with grade separation and interchanges in the 1960s—often with local streets that happened to be in convenient locations doubling as ramps for access to the highway. However, four junctions nearest the northern end in the town of Gloucester were not improved. Proceeding in the direction signed as northward beyond exit 55 (old exit 12, the interchange with Crafts Road), the route runs eastward as a four-lane expressway through two rotaries, named Grant Circle (intersection with Washington Street) and Blackburn Circle (intersection with Dory Road going northward and Schoolhouse Road going southward) and another intersection at Route 127 (Eastern Avenue) to its terminus in another intersection at Route 127A (East Main Street/Bass Avenue).

==History==
As designated in 1927, the original Route 128, called the &quot;Circumferential Highway&quot;, followed existing roadways from Gloucester to Hull through Boston&#x27;s suburbs. The first (northernmost) segment of the present freeway, which is still just four lanes wide, opened in 1951. Construction progressed southward. The final (southernmost) segment, originally built as the present eight-lane highway that spliced into the John Fitzgerald Expressway (then Route 3 for its entire length, and popularly also known as the Southeast Expressway) at a wye junction now known as the Braintree Split in Braintree. This segment, which opened in 1960, replaced a two-lane undivided road to complete the first circumferential highway around any major city.

Upon completion of the final segment of the Yankee Division Highway, the agency then known as the Massachusetts Highway Department (subsequently reorganized the Highway Division of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation) assigned the concurrent designation of Route 128 to the segment of the Southeast Expressway (Route 3) from exit 35 (old exit 14) to the Braintree Split (exit 42, old exit 19), linking to the segment of the original Route 128 from the intersection with Route 53 at Queen Anne&#x27;s Corner at the Hingham-Norwell line to the southern terminus in Hull. That action removed the designation as Route 128 from Blue Hill River Road in Randolph and Braintree, which is now closed to traffic, and West Street, Franklin Street, segments of Washington Street and Plain Street, and Grove Street in Braintree, a segment of Columbian Street, Park Avenue, and a segment of Ralph Talbot Street in Weymouth, and Derby Street and a segment of Whiting Street (Route 53) in Hingham, all of which remain in service for local traffic. However, fate was not so kind to the rest of the original route. Although some segments of remain in service as local parallel streets, other segments became part of the present right of way, but with connections severed at both ends, and some segments were severed where they cross the present right of way and even closed if no longer used by local traffic. Thus, it is no longer feasible to drive the original route between Braintree and Gloucester.

In 1965, the Massachusetts Highway Department truncated Route 128 at the Braintree Split and redesignated the non-freeway section of Route 128 from Route 3 through Hingham and Hull as Route 228, with its direction reversed to reflect the actual geographical direction of that segment of the route. This action ended the concurrent route designation on the John Fitzgerald Expressway.

In the wake of a political decision not to complete the Northeast Expressway and to construct a Southwest Expressway to connect I-95 through Boston as originally planned, the United States Department of Transportation and the Massachusetts Highway Department redesignated the segment of the Yankee Division Highway between the junction with the completed segment of I-95 from Peabody to the New Hampshire border and the junction with the completed segment of I-95 from Canton to the Rhode Island border as I-95 to complete that highway. Concurrently, these agencies extended I-93 from its original terminus in Boston southward on the John Fitzgerald Expressway to the Braintree Split, then westward on the southern segment of the Yankee Division Highway to the junction with the completed southern segment of I-95 from Canton. At that time, the Massachusetts Highway Department officially truncated Route 128 at its intersection with I-95 in Peabody, began removal of Route 128 signage, and assigned I-93 and I-95 exit numbers to the interchanges on both affected segments of the Yankee Division Highway. The Massachusetts Highway Department subsequently restored the designation of Route 128 and reinstalled signage on the segment of the Yankee Division Highway designated as I-95, partly in response to public protest and partly due to the fact that an Amtrak and MBTA commuter rail station adjacent to the highway at the University Avenue interchange in Canton bears the name &quot;Route 128&quot; (RTE on the railroad timetables and in the Amtrak reservation system). The station is located at the first interchange north of the junction of I-93 and I-95 in Canton.

Despite no longer officially carrying the designation, the section of the Yankee Division Highway between Braintree and Canton is popularly called Route 128 within Massachusetts. However, signage for Route 128 has gradually disappeared from the segment designated as I-95 as the Massachusetts Department of Transportation has replaced signage along that segment of the road and on the intersecting roads.

At its current southern terminus, Route 128 begins running concurrently with I-95 (same direction) and US 1 (opposite direction). While its concurrency with US 1 ends in Dedham, its concurrency with I-95 continues as it intersects with expressways including I-90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike) in Weston; US 20 in Waltham; Route 2 in Lexington; US 3 in Burlington (with which it runs concurrently within the town); and I-93 and US 1 again in Reading and Lynnfield, respectively. Route 128 and I-95 split in Peabody; as I-95 continues north towards New Hampshire, Route 128 travels east towards its northern terminus at an interchange with Route 127A in Gloucester.

Route 128 was assigned by 1927 along local roads, running from Route 138 in Milton around the west side of Boston to Route 107 (Essex Street or Bridge Street) in Salem. Its route was as follows:
By 1928, it had been extended east to Quincy from its south end along the following streets, ending at the intersection of Route 3 and Route 3A (current Route 3A and Route 53):
The first section of the new Circumferential Highway, in no way the freeway that it is now, was the piece from Route 9 in Wellesley around the south side of Boston to Route 3 (current Route 53) in Hingham. Parts of this were built as new roads, but most of it was along existing roads that were improved to handle the traffic. In 1931, the Massachusetts Department of Public Works acquired a right-of-way from Route 138 in Canton through Westwood, Dedham and Needham to Route 9 in Wellesley. This was mostly wide, only shrinking to in Needham, in the area of Great Plain Avenue and the Needham Line. Much of this was along new alignment, but about half—mostly in Needham—was along existing roads:
*Royall Street from west of Route 138 to east of Green Street (Canton)
*Green Lodge Street from Royall Street (cut off by Route 128) to Route 128 Station (Canton and Westwood)
*Greendale Avenue from Lyons Street and Common Street just south of the Charles River to Hunting Avenue (Dedham and Needham)
*Fremont Street north from Highland Avenue (Needham)
*Reservoir Street from Central Avenue to Route 9 (Needham and Wellesley)

From Route 138 in Canton east through the Blue Hills Reservation in Canton, Milton, Quincy and Braintree, Norfolk County acquired right-of-way in 1927 and built the Blue Hill River Road. This tied into West Street in northwest Braintree, which itself had been taken over by the county in 1923.

West Street led to Route 37, which ran southeast to Braintree center. This part of Route 37 had been taken over by the state in 1919 (to Braintree center) and 1917 (in Braintree center).

The rest of the new highway, from Route 37 east to Route 3 (now Route 53), through Braintree, Weymouth and Hingham, was taken over by the state in 1929. This was all along existing roads, except possibly the part of Park Avenue west of Route 18 in Weymouth.

By 1933, the whole Circumferential Highway had been completed, and, except for the piece from Route 9 in Wellesley south to Highland Avenue in Needham, was designated as Route 128. Former Route 128 along Highland Avenue into Needham center was left unnumbered (as was the Circumferential Highway north of Highland Avenue), but the rest of former Route 128, from Needham center east to Quincy, became part of Route 135. Thus the full route of the Circumferential Highway, as it existed by 1933, is now the following roads:

At the same time as Route 128 was extended along the new Circumferential Highway, it was extended further into Hull. This alignment, not part of the Circumferential Highway, ran southeast on Route 3 (now Route 53) (Whiting Street) to the border of Hingham and Norwell, where it turned north on present Route 228 (Main Street) through Hingham and into Hull. The exact route through Hingham was Main Street, Short Street, Leavitt Street, East Street, and Hull Street. The end of the numbered route was at the south end of Nantasket Beach, where Nantasket Avenue curves northwest to follow the shore of Massachusetts Bay.

In 1941, the road was named the Yankee Division Highway in honor of the U.S. Army unit first formed in Boston in 1917.

In 1955, &quot;Business Week&quot; ran an article titled &quot;New England Highway Upsets Old Way of Life&quot; and referred to Route 128 as &quot;the Magic Semicircle&quot;. In 1957, there were 99 companies employing 17,000 workers along Route 128; in 1965, 574; in 1973, 1,212. The development of college-like suburban campuses and marketing to technology companies was intentional on the part of real estate developers such as Gerald W. Blakeley Jr.
In the 1980s, the area was often compared to California&#x27;s Silicon Valley, and the positive effects of this growth on the Massachusetts economy were dubbed the &quot;Massachusetts Miracle&quot;. By 1958, it became apparent that due to premature traffic congestion, the highway needed to be widened from four to six lanes, as business growth continued, often driven by technology out of Harvard University and MIT.
This widening project was completed in 1964, and involved replacement of all of the old overpasses with new ones.

In 1967, with the enaction of a policy that limited each road to one route number a decision was made to drop the designation of Route 128 from the Southeast Expressway and to redesignate the orphaned segment from exit 35 (old exit 14) of the Southeast Expressway to the terminus in Hull as Route 228—but with its designated directions reversed to reflect the actual geographical direction of the new route. This shifted the southern terminus of Route 128 to the Braintree Split.

The area along the western part of Route 128 is home to a number of high-technology firms and corporations. This part of Route 128 was officially named &quot;America&#x27;s Technology Highway&quot; in October 1982. Two years later, those blue signs were changed to read &quot;America&#x27;s Technology Region&quot; after complaints from veterans groups that noted the highway already had the Yankee Division Highway designation.

With the designation of the part of the highway as I-95 in 1973, the need to upgrade it to Interstate Highway standards became apparent. By the 1980s, traffic levels had also increased on the section significantly due to the change. In 1988, this section was finally brought to Interstate standards, and the new interchanges with I-95 were finally completed.

In 1991, parts of the roadway had their shoulder converted into travel lanes at peak travel periods.

In late 2001, a project to resurface the road in Lexington and Burlington was completed.

Starting in 1998 and continuing through 2002, signs were replaced through a $1.1 million project between Reading and Lynnfield. Progress continued in 2005 and 2006 during a $2.2 million project which replaced the signs on from Peabody to Gloucester, and continued with a $1.4 million project in 2008 and 2009 that replaced signs in Peabody and the remaining ones in Lynnfield. A $2.9 million federal stimulus project helped replace exit and highway signs in 2010 and 2011 along Route 128/I-95 from US 3 in Lexington to I-93 in Reading.

A project begun in the fall of 2012 and completed in the fall of 2015 replaced exit and guide signs on Route 128/I-95 from Route 9 (exit 36, old exit 20) in Wellesley to Route 4/Route 225 (exit 49, old exit 31) in Lexington and, as part of the Add-A-Lane project discussed above, new signs were put up along a section of the I-95/Route 128 project completed in 2015 from Great Plain Avenue in Needham to Route 109 in Dedham. New signage was put up between I-95 and US 1 in 2010 and most of the signage between I-95 and Route 24 (on I-93/US 1) had been replaced by the end of 2011. Future projects would replace the signs on I-95 (south of Route 128) between the Rhode Island state line and the interchange with I-93, US 1, and Route 128 in Canton in 2018 and (along I-95/Route 128) between I-93 in Reading and US 1 in Peabody in 2019. New mileage markers were placed every of a mile along the highway in 2010 (except for the area covered by the widening project) for I-93 between Braintree and Canton and I-95/Route 128 from Canton to Peabody. New markers put along Route 128 (north of I-95) from Peabody to Gloucester reflect the state highway&#x27;s total mileage from Canton, indicating MassDOT&#x27;s change of heart in decommissioning the route where it shares the road with I-95. The previous mile markers (reflected in the exit list below) had mile 0 in Peabody.

During the 1960s reconstruction of Route 128, a provision had been made for a fourth lane within the widely spaced median along the length of Route 128 running from just north of the US 1 interchange in Dedham, Massachusetts, northwestwards to the Route 109 interchange, and this would finally be used for the Add-A-Lane project. The $315 million MassDOT Highway Division project has widened the existing six-lane section of highway to eight lanes from north of Route 9 in Wellesley to Route 24 in Randolph. The project consists of adding a lane on the inside of each carriageway, complete with a inside shoulder. The existing 1950s bridges, 22 in total, also were replaced. The project also included construction of a new two-lane ramp from Route 128 to I-95 in Canton and installation of a new interchange at Kendrick Street in Needham, designated as exit 35A (old exit 19A) with the ramps to Highland Avenue become exits 35B and 35C (old exits 19B and 19C). Construction on phase 1 was officially completed in October 2009. Construction of phase 2 of the project began in summer 2006. This phase of the project consisted of the replacement of the Route 1 and Route 1A bridges over Route 128 in Dedham along with the road widening between exits 27 and 29 (old exits 13 and 15, US 1). Construction of four sound barriers between the US 1 and I-95 interchanges were also included. This phase was completed in the spring of 2011. Construction on phase 3, begun in April 2009, widened I-93/US 1 to four lanes in each direction from Route 24 to the I-95 interchange. Phase 4 of the project, which began in March 2011, is replacing seven bridges and widens Route 128 (I-95) to four lanes in each direction from Route 109 to south of Highland Avenue in Needham. The southeastern freeway (Pilgrims Highway) that extends from Braintree to Cape Cod, Route 3, is also in the process of undergoing a similar &quot;add-a-lane&quot; project for much of its own length. Construction on the sixth and final segment in Needham and Wellesley began in January 2015, and included wider bridges and more auxiliary lanes and a new collector road. Major road construction ended in October 2018, and the project wrapped up with painting and landscaping in the spring of 2019.

== Future ==
=== Monorail proposal ===
In 2015, the mayor of the City of Waltham, Jeannette McCarthy, noted that traffic was exceeding the capacity of Route 128 and proposed that communities located along the highway jointly consider a plan of establishing a form of monorail to add further mass transit options to businesses along the Route 128 corridor.

==Exit list==
The exit numbers along the I-93 portion of the Yankee Division Highway (indicated by an asterisk in the table below because that segment of the highway is no longer officially part of Route 128) are in accordance with I-93&#x27;s exit numbering scheme in Massachusetts. Exit numbers along the I-95/Route 128 overlap portion are in accordance to the I-95 exit numbering scheme in Massachusetts. The stretch north of I-95, as well as the rest of the length before I-95 exit numbering was applied, previously had decreasing exit numbers traveling northbound, contrary to almost all highways in the US with numbered exits. Route 128 currently has 18 numbered interchanges, which previously started at exit 37 (old exit 29, southbound) and continued downwards to old exit 9 (former exit 27, an at-grade intersection, was removed, and the last two exits are at-grade intersections). However, upon Massachusetts switching to mileage-based exit numbers, the exit numbers now abide by standard numbering rules. The new numbers along the stretch of highway north of I-95 increase from 37 in Peabody to 55 in Gloucester, with the traffic circles and at-grade intersections no longer receiving numbers. On January 27, 2021, MassDOT announced that renumbering the exits along Route 128 would start on February 3 and would go on for two weeks, but it was delayed until February 11 due to weather and a delay on renumbering the exits along US 3.





















==Influence==
In 2002, American mathematician Robert P. C. de Marrais named the routons, or the 128-dimensional hypercomplex numbers, after Route 128.

<text>The South Atlantic Conference (SAC) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division II level, which operates in the southeastern United States. The SAC was founded in 1975 as a football-only conference and became an all-sports conference beginning with the 1989–90 season.

The league currently sponsors 10 sports for men (football, cross country, soccer, basketball, wrestling, baseball, lacrosse, outdoor track &amp; field, tennis, golf) and 10 sports for women (volleyball, cross country, field hockey, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, outdoor track &amp; field, softball, tennis, and golf).

==History==
The distant forerunner of the South Atlantic Conference was the North State Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (NSIAC). The NSIAC was formed when the &quot;Little Six&quot;, as it was called, broke from the North Carolina Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 1930. The charter members included Appalachian State Teachers College (now Appalachian State University), Lenoir–Rhyne College (now Lenoir–Rhyne University), Atlantic Christian College (now Barton College), Catawba College, Guilford College, Elon College (now Elon University), and High Point College (now High Point University).

The North State continued to grow over the next 30 years, adding Western Carolina University (1933), East Carolina University (1947) and Pfeiffer College (now Pfeiffer University; 1960). A name change became necessary when the league accepted Newberry College as its first member from the state of South Carolina in 1961. The league took on the name Carolinas Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (CIAC) on May 20 of that year.

The CIAC saw several changes in the following years as East Carolina withdrew from the league in 1962. Appalachian State and Western Carolina followed in 1971 and 1976. All three landed in the Southern Conference (SoCon).

The South Atlantic Conference was founded in 1975 solely as a football conference. The league received its name from a contest in which Kurt Brenneman of Greensboro, North Carolina became the first to submit the SAC-8 moniker.

The SAC-8 consisted of Carson–Newman College (now Carson–Newman University), Catawba College, Elon College, Gardner–Webb College (now Gardner–Webb University), Lenoir–Rhyne College (now Lenoir-Rhyne University), Mars Hill College (now Mars Hill University), Newberry College, and Presbyterian College. Dr. Fred Bentley, of Mars Hill College, was named league president for its inaugural year, by a vote of the member institutions.

After the first season of play in the SAC-8, the Bears of Lenoir–Rhyne College captured the first football title.

In 1989, the league&#x27;s 15th year of operation, the South Atlantic Conference became a comprehensive, multi-sport conference. Doug Echols was named the league&#x27;s first Commissioner. That year the South Atlantic Conference sponsored 10 sports – football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, baseball, softball, men&#x27;s soccer, volleyball, men&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis. Later the conference grew to 14 championship sports by adding women&#x27;s soccer (1990), men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country (1993) and women&#x27;s golf (1999). In 2013, the sports of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field were added, increasing the number of championship sports to 18.

The South Atlantic Conference was composed of the same eight member institutions from 1975–76 until 1988–89, when Wingate College (now Wingate University) replaced Newberry College as the eighth member institution. Newberry College later re-joined the conference in the 1996–97 season.

In July 1998, Tusculum College (now Tusculum University) was admitted as a member of the league, and Lincoln Memorial University began play in the conference in the 2006–07 academic year. Brevard College was admitted to the SAC as a provisional member in 2007 and a full member in 2008.

In 2008, Echols retired after serving as Commissioner for 19 years and Patrick Britz was hired as the new Commissioner.

In July 2010, Anderson University became the league&#x27;s 10th member. Three years later in July 2013, Coker College (now Coker University) and Queens University of Charlotte joined the conference. On April 13, 2018, UVA Wise (in full, the University of Virginia&#x27;s College at Wise) announced that it was joining the South Atlantic Conference for the 2019-20 season. A more recent change to the conference membership was announced on April 5, 2019, when Limestone College, which had joined as a football-only member in 2017 and added field hockey to its SAC membership the next year, was announced as a new full member effective in 2020–21, the same time it became Limestone University.

The SAC and Conference Carolinas entered into a partnership in the 2018–19 school year by which the two leagues would operate as a single conference in field hockey and men&#x27;s wrestling, with championships immediately conducted in both sports. The leagues agreed that the SAC would coordinate the field hockey championship, while CC would fill the same role for men&#x27;s wrestling. Accordingly, all CC field hockey programs became SAC affiliates, and all SAC men&#x27;s wrestling programs became CC affiliates. The SAC–CC alliance is officially branded as &quot;South Atlantic Conference Carolinas&quot;.

A more recent change in conference membership was announced on November 17, 2020. Emory &amp; Henry College, now a university, then in the Division III Old Dominion Athletic Conference, started a transition to Division II in July 2021 and began SAC competition in 2022.

In December 2021, the SAC and CC jointly announced that they would extend their existing partnership to include two women&#x27;s sports, triathlon and wrestling, with triathlon competition starting in 2022–23 and wrestling in 2023–24. At the same time, both conferences agreed that after the 2021–22 school year, the SAC would become the only one of the two conferences to sponsor field hockey. The joint men&#x27;s wrestling league will continue to operate through the 2022–23 season, after which both conferences will establish their own men&#x27;s wrestling leagues.

The most recent change was officially announced on May 10, 2022, when the Division I Atlantic Sun Conference (then branded as the ASUN Conference) announced that Queens would leave the SAC to start a transition to D-I on July 1 as a new ASUN member.

Starting in 2023–24, the SACC men&#x27;s wrestling league was dissolved. Originally the intent was for the SAC and CC to each begin their own wrestling league; however, all the SAC schools that sponsored wrestling instead became CC affiliates in that sport. At the same time, SACC added women&#x27;s wrestling and beach volleyball.

===Chronological timeline===
* 1975 – The South Atlantic Conference (SAC) was founded as a football-only conference. Charter members included Carson–Newman College (now Carson–Newman University), Catawba College, Elon College (now Elon University), Gardner–Webb College (now Gardner–Webb University), Lenoir–Rhyne College (now Lenoir–Rhyne University), Mars Hill College (now Mars Hill University), Newberry College and Presbyterian College, beginning the 1975 fall season (1975–76 academic year).
* 1989 – Newberry left the SAC-8 after the 1988 fall season (1988–89 academic year).
* 1989 – The SAC-8 added more sports to be a full-fledged multi-sport athletic conference in the 1989–90 academic year.
* 1989 – Wingate College (now Wingate University) joined the SAC (while replacing Newberry) in the 1989–90 academic year.
* 1996 – Newberry returned to the SAC as an all-sports member in the 1996–97 academic year.
* 1996 – Elon left the SAC to join the Division I ranks of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as an NCAA D-I Independent (which would later join the Big South Conference as a provisional member, beginning the 1998–99 school year) after the 1996–97 academic year.
* 1998 – Tusculum College (now Tusculum University) joined the SAC in the 1998–99 academic year.
* 2000 – Gardner–Webb left the SAC to join the NCAA Division I ranks as an NCAA D-I Independent (which would later join the Atlantic Sun Conference as a provisional member, beginning the 2002–03 school year) after the 1999–2000 academic year.
* 2006 – Lincoln Memorial University joined the SAC effective in the 2006–07 academic year.
* 2007 – Presbyterian left the SAC to join the NCAA Division I ranks as an NCAA D-I Independent (which would later join the Big South as a provisional member, beginning the 2008–09 school year) after the 2006–07 academic year.
* 2007 – Brevard College joined the SAC (as a provisional member) in the 2007–08 academic year.
* 2010 – Anderson University joined the SAC in the 2010–11 academic year.
* 2013 – Coker College (now Coker University) and Queens University joined the SAC in the 2013–14 academic year.
* 2017 – Brevard left the SAC to join the NCAA Division III ranks and the USA South Athletic Conference (USA South) after the 2016–17 academic year.
* 2017 – Limestone College (now Limestone University) joined the SAC as an affiliate member for football in the 2017 fall season (2017–18 academic year).
* 2018 – Effective with the 2018–19 academic year, the SAC and Conference Carolinas (CC) established a partnership known as &quot;South Atlantic Conference Carolinas&quot; (SACC) for field hockey and men&#x27;s wrestling. Under the partnership, the SAC operated the joint field hockey championship, with CC filling the same role for men&#x27;s wrestling. Accordingly, Belmont Abbey College and Converse College (now Converse University) joined the SAC as affiliate members for field hockey at that time. Limestone added that sport to its SAC affiliate membership.
* 2019 – The University of Virginia&#x27;s College at Wise (UVA Wise) joined the SAC in the 2019–20 academic year.
* 2020 – Limestone became a full SAC member for all sports in the 2020–21 academic year.
* 2022:
** Queens left the SAC for the D-I Atlantic Sun Conference (then known as the ASUN Conference) after the 2021–22 academic year.
** Emory and Henry College (now Emory and Henry University) joined the SAC as a full member in the 2022–23 academic year.
** Barton College and Erskine College joined the SAC as affiliates members for football in the 2022 fall season (2022–23 academic year).
** Effective with the 2022–23 academic year, field hockey became no longer part of the SACC partnership, with that sport now being fully governed by the SAC. The existing CC field hockey schools continued to compete as SAC affiliates. At the same time, women&#x27;s triathlon was placed under the SACC umbrella.
* 2023 – Effective with the 2023–24 academic year, the SACC men&#x27;s wrestling league was dissolved. Originally the intent was for the SAC and CC to each begin their own wrestling league; however, all the SAC schools that sponsored wrestling instead became CC affiliates in that sport. At the same time, SACC added women&#x27;s wrestling and beach volleyball.
* 2024 – Erskine left the SAC as an affiliate member for football after the 2023 fall season (2023–24 academic year).
* 2025 – Barton will leave the SAC as an affiliate member for football after the 2024 fall season (2024–25 academic year).

<doc id="79710" wikidata="Q221608" url="?curid=79710" title="Domino theory">
<text>The domino theory is a geopolitical theory which posits that changes in the political structure of one country tend to spread to neighboring countries in a domino effect. It was prominent in the United States from the 1950s to the 1980s in the context of the Cold War, suggesting that if one country in a region came under the influence of communism, then the surrounding countries would follow. It was used by successive United States administrations during the Cold War as justification for American intervention around the world. U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower described the theory during a news conference on April 7, 1954, when referring to communism in Indochina as follows:

Moreover, Eisenhower&#x27;s deep belief in the domino theory in Asia heightened the &quot;perceived costs for the United States of pursuing multilateralism&quot; because of multifaceted events including the &quot;1949 victory of the Chinese Communist Party, the June 1950 North Korean invasion, the 1954 Quemoy offshore island crisis, and the conflict in Indochina constituted a broad-based challenge not only for one or two countries, but for the entire Asian continent and Pacific.&quot; This connotes a strong magnetic force to give in to communist control, and aligns with the comment by General Douglas MacArthur that &quot;victory is a strong magnet in the East.&quot;

==History==
During 1945, the Soviet Union brought most of the countries of eastern Europe and Central Europe into its influence as part of the post-World War II new settlement, prompting Winston Churchill to declare in a speech in 1946 at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri that:

Following the Iran crisis of 1946, Harry S. Truman declared what became known as the Truman Doctrine in 1947, promising to contribute financial aid to the Greek government during its Civil War and to Turkey following World War II, in the hope that this would impede the advancement of Communism into Western Europe. Later that year, diplomat George Kennan wrote an article in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; magazine that became known as the &quot;X Article&quot;, which first articulated the policy of containment, arguing that the further spread of Communism to countries outside a &quot;buffer zone&quot; around the USSR, even if it happened via democratic elections, was unacceptable and a threat to U.S. national security. Kennan was also involved, along with others in the Truman administration, in creating the Marshall Plan, which also began in 1947, to give aid to the countries of Western Europe (along with Greece and Turkey), in large part with the hope of keeping them from falling under Soviet domination.

In 1949, a Communist-backed government, led by Mao Zedong, overthrew the earlier government of China (officially Zedong&#x27;s regime instated the People&#x27;s Republic of China). The installation of the new government was established after the People&#x27;s Liberation Army defeated the Nationalist Republican Government of China in the aftermath of the Chinese Civil War (1927-1949). Two Chinas were formed – mainland &quot;Communist China&quot; (People&#x27;s Republic of China) and &#x27;Nationalist China&#x27; Taiwan (Republic of China). The takeover by Communists of the world&#x27;s most populous nation was seen in the West as a great strategic loss, prompting the popular question at the time, &quot;Who lost China?&quot; The United States subsequently ended diplomatic relations with the newly founded People&#x27;s Republic of China in response to the communist takeover in 1949. The United States and communist China did not re-instate diplomatic relations again until under president Nixon&#x27;s visit in 1972.

Korea had also partially fallen under Soviet domination at the end of World War II, split from the south of the 38th parallel where U.S. forces subsequently moved into. By 1948, as a result of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the U.S., Korea was split into two regions, with separate governments, each claiming to be the legitimate government of Korea, and neither side accepting the border as permanent. In 1950 fighting broke out between Communists and Republicans that soon involved troops from China (on the Communists&#x27; side), and the United States and 15 allied countries (on the Republicans&#x27; side). Though the Korean conflict has not officially ended, the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice that left Korea divided into two nations, North Korea and South Korea. Mao Zedong&#x27;s decision to take on the U.S. in the Korean War was a direct attempt to confront what the Communist bloc viewed as the strongest anti-Communist power in the world, undertaken at a time when the Chinese Communist regime was still consolidating its own power after winning the Chinese Civil War.

The first figure to propose the domino theory was President Harry S. Truman in the 1940s, where he introduced the theory in order to &quot;justify sending military aid to Greece and Turkey.&quot; However, the domino theory was popularized by President Dwight D. Eisenhower when he applied it to Southeast Asia, especially South Vietnam during the First Indochina War. Moreover, the domino theory was utilized as one of the key arguments in the &quot;Kennedy and Johnson administrations during the 1960s to justify increasing American military involvement in the Vietnam War.&quot; 

In May 1954, the Viet Minh, a Communist and nationalist army, defeated French troops in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and took control of what became North Vietnam. This caused the French to fully withdraw from the region then known as French Indochina, a process they had begun earlier. The regions were then divided into four independent countries (North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos) after a deal and truce was brokered at the 1954 Geneva Conference to end the First Indochina War.

This would give them a geographical and economic strategic advantage, and it would make Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand the front-line defensive states. The loss of regions traditionally within the vital regional trading area of countries like Japan would encourage the front-line countries to compromise politically with communism.

Eisenhower&#x27;s domino theory of 1954 was a specific description of the situation and conditions within Southeast Asia at the time, and he did not suggest a generalized domino theory as others did afterward.

During the summer of 1963, Buddhists protested about the harsh treatment they were receiving under the Diem government of South Vietnam. Such actions of the South Vietnamese government made it difficult for the Kennedy administration&#x27;s strong support for President Diem. President Kennedy was in a tenuous position, trying to contain Communism in Southeast Asia, but on the other hand, supporting an anti-Communist government that was not popular with its domestic citizens and was guilty of acts objectionable to the American public. The Kennedy administration intervened in Vietnam in the early 1960s to, among other reasons, keep the South Vietnamese &quot;domino&quot; from falling. When Kennedy came to power there was concern that the communist-led Pathet Lao in Laos would provide the Viet Cong with bases, and that eventually they could take over Laos.

=== Arguments in favor of the domino theory ===
The primary evidence for the domino theory is the spread of communist rule in three Southeast Asian countries in 1975, following the communist takeover of Vietnam: South Vietnam (by the Viet Cong), Laos (by the Pathet Lao), and Cambodia (by the Khmer Rouge). It can further be argued that before they finished taking Vietnam prior to the 1950s, the communist campaigns did not succeed in Southeast Asia. Note the Malayan Emergency, the Hukbalahap Rebellion in the Philippines, and the increasing involvement with Communists by Sukarno of Indonesia from the late 1950s until he was deposed in 1967. All of these were unsuccessful Communist attempts to take over Southeast Asian countries which stalled when communist forces were still focused in Vietnam, while Robert Grainger Thompson argued that US involvement even turned those within Communist nations toward the West.

Walt Whitman Rostow and the then Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew have argued that the U.S. intervention in Indochina, by giving the nations of ASEAN time to consolidate and engage in economic growth, prevented a wider domino effect. Meeting with President Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger in 1975, Lee Kuan Yew argued that &quot;there is a tendency in the U.S. Congress not to want to export jobs. But we have to have the jobs if we are to stop Communism. We have done that, moving from simple to more complex skilled labor. If we stop this process, it will do more harm than you can every [sic] repair with aid. Don&#x27;t cut off imports from Southeast Asia.&quot;

McGeorge Bundy argued that the prospects for a domino effect, though high in the 1950s and early 1960s, were weakened in 1965 when the Indonesian Communist Party was destroyed via death squads in the Indonesian genocide. However, proponents believe that the efforts during the containment (i.e., Domino Theory) period ultimately led to the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.

Linguist and political theorist Noam Chomsky wrote that he believes that the domino theory is roughly accurate, writing that communist and socialist movements became popular in poorer countries because they brought economic improvements to those countries in which they took power. For this reason, he wrote, the U.S. put so much effort into suppressing so-called &quot;people&#x27;s movements&quot; in Chile, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Laos, Grenada, El Salvador, Guatemala, etc. &quot;The weaker and poorer a country is, the more dangerous it is as an example. If a tiny, poor country like Grenada can succeed in bringing about a better life for its people, some other place that has more resources will ask, &#x27;Why not us? Chomsky refers to this as the &quot;threat of a good example&quot;.

Some supporters of the domino theory note the history of communist governments supplying aid to communist revolutionaries in neighboring countries. For instance, China supplied the Viet Minh and later the North Vietnamese army with troops and supplies, while the Soviet Union supplied them with tanks and heavy weapons. The fact that the Pathet Lao and Khmer Rouge were both originally part of the Vietminh, not to mention Hanoi&#x27;s support for both in conjunction with the Viet Cong, also give credence to the theory. The Soviet Union also heavily supplied Sukarno with military supplies and advisors from the time of the Guided Democracy in Indonesia, especially during and after the 1958 civil war in Sumatra.

=== Criticism of the domino theory ===
In a memorandum sent to CIA Director John McCone on 9 June 1964, the Board of National Estimates generally discounted the idea of the domino theory as applied to Vietnam:

In the spring of 1995, despite having been a strong proponent of it during his time in office, former US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara said he believed the domino theory to have been a mistake. &quot;I think we were wrong. I do not believe that Vietnam was that important to the communists. I don’t believe that its loss would have led – it didn’t lead – to Communist control of Asia.&quot; Professor Tran Chung Ngoc, an overseas Vietnamese living in the US, said: &quot;The US does not have any plausible reason to intervene in Vietnam, a small, poor, undeveloped country that does not have any ability to do anything that could harm America. Therefore, the US intervention in Vietnam regardless of public opinion and international law is &quot;using power over justice&quot;, giving itself the right to intervene anywhere that America wants.&quot;

== Significance of the domino theory==

The domino theory is significant because it underlines the importance of alliances, which may vary from rogue alliances to bilateral alliances. This implies that the domino theory is useful in evaluating a country&#x27;s intent and purpose of forging an alliance with others, including a cluster of other countries within a particular region. While the intent and purpose may differ for every country, Victor Cha portrays the asymmetrical bilateral alliance between the United States and countries in East Asia as a strategic approach, where the United States is in control and power to either mobilize or stabilize its allies. This is supported by how the United States created asymmetrical bilateral alliances with the Republic of Korea, Republic of China and Japan &quot;not just to contain but also constrain potential &#x27;rogue alliances&#x27; from engaging in adventurist behavior that might it into larger military contingencies in the region or that could trigger a domino effect, with Asian countries falling to communism.&quot; Since the United States struggled with the challenge of &quot;rogue alliances and the threat of falling dominoes combined to produce a dreaded entrapment scenario for the United States,&quot; the domino theory further underscores the importance of bilateral alliances in international relations. This is evident in how the domino theory provided the United States with a coalition approach, where it &quot;fashioned a series of deep, tight bilateral alliances&quot; with Asian countries including Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan to &quot;control their ability to use force and to foster material and political dependency on the United States.&quot; Hence, this indicates that the domino theory assists in observing the effect of forged alliances as a stepping stone or stumbling block within international relations. This underscores the correlation between domino theory and path dependency, where a retrospective collapse of one country falling to communism may not only have adverse effects to other countries but more importantly, on one&#x27;s decision-making scope and competence in overcoming present and future challenges. Therefore, the domino theory is indubitably a significant theory which deals with the close relationship between micro-cause and macro-consequence, where it suggests such macro-consequences may result in long-term repercussions.

==Applications to communism outside Southeast Asia==
Michael Lind has argued that though the domino theory failed regionally, there was a global wave, as communist or socialist regimes came to power in Benin, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Angola, Afghanistan, Grenada, and Nicaragua during the 1970s. The global interpretation of the domino effect relies heavily upon the &quot;prestige&quot; interpretation of the theory, meaning that the success of Communist revolutions in some countries, though it did not provide material support to revolutionary forces in other countries, did contribute morale and rhetorical support.

In this vein, Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara wrote an essay, the &quot;Message to the Tricontinental&quot;, in 1967, calling for &quot;two, three ... many Vietnams&quot; across the world. Historian Max Boot wrote, &quot;In the late 1970s, America&#x27;s enemies seized power in countries from Mozambique to Iran to Nicaragua. American hostages were seized aboard the SS &quot;Mayaguez&quot; (off Cambodia) and in Tehran. The Soviet Army invaded Afghanistan. There is no obvious connection with the Vietnam War, but there is little doubt that the defeat of a superpower encouraged our enemies to undertake acts of aggression that they might otherwise have shied away from.&quot;

In addition, this theory can be further bolstered by the rise in terrorist incidents by left-wing terrorist groups in Western Europe, funded in part by Communist governments, between the 1960s and 1980s. In Italy, this includes the kidnapping and assassination of former Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro, and the kidnapping of former US Brigadier General James L. Dozier, by the Red Brigades.

In West Germany, this includes the terrorist actions of the Red Army Faction. In the far east the Japanese Red Army carried out similar acts. All four, as well as others, worked with various Arab and Palestinian terrorists, which like the red brigades were backed by the Soviet Bloc.

In the 1977 Frost/Nixon interviews, Richard Nixon defended the United States&#x27; destabilization of the Salvador Allende regime in Chile on domino theory grounds. Borrowing a metaphor he had heard, he stated that a Communist Chile and Cuba would create a &quot;red sandwich&quot; that could entrap Latin America between them. In the 1980s, the domino theory was used again to justify the Reagan administration&#x27;s interventions in Central America and the Caribbean region.

In his memoirs, former Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith described the successive rise of authoritarian left-wing governments in Sub-Saharan Africa during decolonization as &quot;the communists&#x27; domino tactic&quot;. The establishment of pro-communist governments in Tanzania (1961–64) and Zambia (1964) and explicitly Marxist–Leninist governments in Angola (1975), Mozambique (1975), and eventually Rhodesia itself (in 1980) are cited by Smith as evidence of &quot;the insidious encroachment of Soviet imperialism down the continent&quot;.

==Other applications==
Some foreign-policy analysts in the United States have referred to the potential spread both of Islamic theocracy and of liberal democracy in the Middle East as two different possibilities for a domino-theory scenario. During the Iran–Iraq War of 1980 to 1988 the United States and other western nations supported Ba&#x27;athist Iraq, fearing the spread of Iran&#x27;s radical theocracy throughout the region. In the 2003 invasion of Iraq, some neoconservatives argued that when a democratic government is implemented, it would then help spread democracy and liberalism across the Middle East. This has been referred to as a &quot;reverse domino theory&quot;, or a &quot;democratic domino theory&quot;, so called because its effects are considered positive, not negative, by Western democratic states.

Russian analysis of a perceived pattern of pro-democratic movements in the post-Soviet era resulted in Vladimir Putin&#x27;s &quot;domino theory of colour revolutions, reiterated by other siloviki and found in military and national security doctrines&quot;.

Some views of successive Russian military interventions - in Georgia in 2008, in Kazakhstan (2022) and in Ukraine (2014 onwards), for example - postulate a domino theory whereby Putin might expand Russian influence in eastern and central Europe.

<text>The cantaloupe ( ) is a type of true melon (&quot;Cucumis melo&quot;) with sweet, aromatic, and usually orange flesh. Originally, &quot;cantaloupe&quot; refers to the true cantaloupe or European cantaloupe with non- to slightly netted and often ribbed rind. Today, it also refers to the muskmelon with strongly netted rind, which is called cantaloupe in North America (hence the name American cantaloupe), rockmelon in Australia and New Zealand, and spanspek in Southern Africa. Cantaloupes range in mass from .

==Etymology and origin==
The cantaloupe is said to have been introduced to Europe from Armenia. It acquired its name because it was first cultivated at Cantalupo, the Pope&#x27;s country estate. It was first mentioned in English literature in 1739. The cantaloupe most likely originated in a region from South Asia to Africa. It was later introduced to Europe, and around 1890, became a commercial crop in the United States.

The South African English name dates back at least as far as 18th-century Dutch Suriname: J. van Donselaar wrote in 1770, &quot; is the name for the form that grows in Suriname which, because of its thick skin and little flesh, is less consumed.&quot; A common etymology involves the Spanish-born , who ate canteloupe for breakfast while her husband and 19th-century governor of Cape Colony, Sir Harry Smith, ate bacon and eggs; the fruit was termed &quot;Spanish bacon&quot; (Afrikaans &quot;&quot;) by locals as a result. However, the term had been in use long before that point.

==Types==
The true or European cantaloupe (Cantalupensis Group &quot;sensu stricto&quot;), which has non- to slightly netted rind and orange flesh, includes the following types:

* Sub-group Prescott with deeply ribbed rind, such as &#x27;Prescott Fond Blanc&#x27;.
* Sub-group Saccharinus with speckled and slightly ribbed rind, such as &#x27;Sucrin de Honfleur&#x27;
* Sub-group Charentais with non-speckled, slightly ribbed and green-sutured rind.

The Israeli cantaloupe (Sub-group Ha&#x27;Ogen) is similar to the European one, but it has green flesh.

The muskmelon or American cantaloupe (formerly Reticulatus Group but now merged into Cantalupensis Group), which has strongly netted rind and orange flesh, includes the following types:

* Sub-group American Western with non- to slightly ribbed and wholly netted rind.
* Sub-group American Eastern with more or less ribbed rind of which the sutures are not or less netted.

=== Other similar types ===
A melon with netted rind is not necessarily a cantaloupe. Many varieties of Chandalak Group and Ameri Group also have netted rind.

The Japanese muskmelon (Sub-group Earl&#x27;s) resembles the American cantaloupe in netted rind, but differs in green flesh and non-dehiscent peduncles (which means the melon does not detach from the stalk when it is ripe). Therefore, some horticulturists classify the Japanese muskmelon under Inodorus Group instead of Cantalupensis or Reticulatus Group.

==Production==
In 2016, global production of melons, including cantaloupes, totaled 31.2 million tons, with China accounting for 51% of the world total (15.9 million tons). Other significant countries growing cantaloupe were Turkey, Iran, Egypt, and India producing 1 to 1.9 million tons, respectively.

California grows 75% of the cantaloupes in the US.

==Uses==
===Culinary===

Cantaloupe is normally eaten as a fresh fruit, as a salad, or as a dessert with ice cream or custard. Melon pieces wrapped in prosciutto are a familiar antipasto. The seeds are edible and may be dried for use as a snack.

Because the surface of a cantaloupe can contain harmful bacteria—in particular, &quot;Salmonella&quot;—it is recommended that a melon be washed and scrubbed thoroughly before cutting and consumption to prevent risk of &quot;Salmonella&quot; or other bacterial pathogens.

A moldy cantaloupe in a Peoria, Illinois, market in 1943 was found to contain the highest yielding strain of mold for penicillin production, after a worldwide search.

===Nutrition===

Raw cantaloupe is 90% water, 8% carbohydrates, 0.8% protein and 0.2% fat (table). In a reference amount of , raw cantaloupe supplies of food energy, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin A (29% DV) and a moderate source of vitamin C (13% DV). Other micronutrients are in negligible amounts (less than 10% DV) (table).

<text>The Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division II level. Formed in 1913, it consists mostly of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), with all but one member located in the Southern United States.

The SIAC has led all NCAA Division II conferences in football attendance.

==History==
Only three charter members are still part of the conference—Clark Atlanta University (formerly Clark College), Tuskegee University, and Morehouse (which briefly left before returning). Before 2014, all members had been southern HBCUs, but four of the SIAC&#x27;s five newest members include its only non-HBCU, Spring Hill College (joined in 2014), and its only member outside the South, Central State University of Ohio (joined in 2015). Their last three recent members were former member schools in their first stints: Savannah State University returned to the SIAC in 2019 after a 19-year absence, Allen University returned to the SIAC in 2020 after a 51-year absence, and Edward Waters University returned to the SIAC in 2021 after a nearly 86-year absence. The U.S. Army&#x27;s 24th Infantry Division teams competed as members of the SIAC from 1930 until 1935.

On March 31, 2021, Paine College left the SIAC and the NCAA and joined the NCCAA.

<text>The West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) was a collegiate athletic conference which historically operated exclusively in the state of West Virginia, but briefly had one Kentucky member in its early years, and expanded into Pennsylvania in its final years. It participated in the Division II ranks of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), originally affiliated in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) until 1995, but held its final athletic competitions in spring 2013, and officially disbanded on September 1 of that year. Its football-playing members announced in June 2012 that they planned to withdraw to form a new Division II conference at the end of the 2012–13 season; this led to a chain of conference moves that saw all but one of the WVIAC&#x27;s members find new conference homes.

==History==
The conference was one of the oldest in intercollegiate athletics, dating back to its founding in 1924 by the West Virginia Department of Education.

In its final school year of 2012–13, the WVIAC offered championships in 16 sports and was headquartered in Princeton, West Virginia. Men&#x27;s championships were offered in football, basketball, baseball, track, cross country, soccer, tennis, and golf. Women&#x27;s titles were contested in volleyball, softball, basketball, cross country, soccer, track, tennis, and golf.

The WVIAC moved into the NCAA Division II in 1995 after its long affiliation with the NAIA.

Its post-season basketball tournament, which was first conducted in 1936, was at the time of the conference&#x27;s demise one of the oldest college post-season tournaments in continuous existence—only the Southern Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament, established in 1922, was older.

* 1988 – West Virginia Wesleyan rejoined the WVIAC in the 1988–89 academic year.
* 1993 – The WVIAC joined the NCAA ranks, while still being affiliated with the NAIA, beginning the 1993–94 academic year.
* 1995 – The WVIAC had achieved full membership status within the NCAA Division II ranks after years being mostly affiliated in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) in the 1995–96 academic year.
* 1999 – Ohio Valley University joined the WVIAC in the 1999–2000 academic year.
* 2006 – West Virginia Tech left the WVIAC to return to the NAIA and join the Mid-South Conference after the 2005–06 academic year.
* 2006 – The University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown (Pittsburgh–Johnstown) and Seton Hill University joined the WVIAC as provisional members, becoming the first two institutions to join the conference from outside the state of West Virginia since the departure of Morehead in 1933 in the 2006–07 academic year.
* 2010 – Salem left the WVIAC to become an NCAA D-II Independent after the 2009–10 academic year.
* 2013 – The WVIAC ceased operations as an athletic conference after the 2012–13 academic year; as many schools left to join their respective new home primary conferences, beginning the 2013–14 academic year: Alderson–Broaddus, Davis &amp; Elkins and Ohio Valley joined the Great Midwest Athletic Conference (G-MAC); Concord, Charleston, Fairmont State, Glenville State, Shepherd, West Liberty, West Virginia State, West Virginia Wesleyan and Wheeling Jesuit joined alongside Notre Dame College of Ohio (former D-II Independent school), Urbana University (from the G-MAC), and the University of Virginia&#x27;s College at Wise (from the Mid-South Conference of the NAIA) to form the Mountain East Conference; and Pittsburgh–Johnstown and Seton Hill joined the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC). The only school since the conference&#x27;s breakup who hadn&#x27;t still found a new conference home was Bluefield State, which ultimately ended up as a D-II Independent (until it rejoined the CIAA beginning the 2023–24 school year) alongside former member Salem (who would later join the G-MAC from 2013–14 to 2015–16, before returning as an independent).

== WVIAC breakup ==
On June 18, 2012, nine football-playing members of the WVIAC announced they would withdraw from the league to form a new regional all-sports conference.

The WVIAC officially ceased to exist on September 1, 2013. Eight of the nine football-playing members (Concord, Charleston, Fairmont State, Glenville State, Shepherd, West Liberty, West Virginia State, and West Virginia Wesleyan) and one non-football playing member (Wheeling Jesuit) of the conference joined a provisional D-II member from Virginia (UVA-Wise) and two associate Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference members from Ohio (Notre Dame and Urbana) to form a new all-sports conference, the Mountain East Conference. Seton Hill and Pitt-Johnstown joined the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference. Three of the remaining non-football members (Alderson–Broaddus, Davis &amp; Elkins, and Ohio Valley) accepted invitations to join the Great Midwest Athletic Conference. The final remaining member, Bluefield State, competed as a D-II independent for 9 years before being invited to rejoin its former conference in the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 2023.

<text>U.S. Route 66 or U.S. Highway 66 (US 66 or Route 66) is one of the original highways in the United States Numbered Highway System. It was established on November 11, 1926, with road signs erected the following year. The highway, which became one of the most famous roadways in the United States, ran from Chicago, Illinois, through Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona before terminating in Santa Monica in Los Angeles County, California, covering a total of .

It was recognized in popular culture by both the 1946 hit song &quot;(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66&quot; and the &quot;Route 66&quot; television series, which aired on CBS from 1960 to 1964. It was also featured in the Disney/Pixar animated feature film franchise &quot;Cars,&quot; beginning in 2006. In John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1939), the highway symbolizes escape, loss, and the hope of a new beginning; Steinbeck dubbed it the Mother Road. Other designations and nicknames include the Will Rogers Highway and the Main Street of America, the latter nickname shared with U.S. Route 40.

US 66 was a primary route for those who migrated west, especially during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, and it supported the economies of the communities through which it passed. People doing business along the route became prosperous, and they later fought to keep it alive in the face of the growing threat of being bypassed by the more advanced controlled-access highways of the Interstate Highway System in the 1960s and 1970s.

US 66 underwent many improvements and realignments over its lifetime, but it was officially removed from the United States Highway System in 1985 after it was entirely replaced by segments of the Interstate Highway System. Portions of the road that passed through Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Arizona have been communally designated a National Scenic Byway by the name &quot;Historic Route 66&quot;, returning the name to some maps. Several states have adopted significant bypassed sections of the former US 66 into their state road networks as State Route 66 and much of the former route within San Bernardino County, California, is designated as County Route 66. The corridor is also being redeveloped into U.S. Bicycle Route 66, a part of the United States Bicycle Route System that was developed in the 2010s.

===Before the U.S. Highway System===
In 1857, Lt. Edward Fitzgerald Beale, a naval officer in the service of the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, was ordered by the War Department to build a government-funded wagon road along the 35th Parallel. His secondary orders were to test the feasibility of the use of camels as pack animals in the southwestern desert. This road became part of US 66.

Parts of the original Route 66 from 1913, prior to its official naming and commissioning, can still be seen north of the Cajon Pass. The paved road becomes a dirt road, south of Cajon, which was also the original Route 66.

Before a nationwide network of numbered highways was adopted by the states, auto trails were marked by private organizations. The route that became US 66 was covered by three highways:
*The Lone Star Route passed through St. Louis on its way from Chicago to Cameron, Louisiana (although US 66 would take a shorter route through Bloomington rather than Peoria).
*The transcontinental National Old Trails Road led via St. Louis to Los Angeles, but was not followed until New Mexico. Instead, US 66 used one of the main routes of the Ozark Trails system, which ended at the National Old Trails Road just south of Las Vegas, New Mexico. Again, a shorter route was taken, here following the Postal Highway between Oklahoma City and Amarillo.
*The National Old Trails Road became the rest of the route to Los Angeles.

Legislation for public highways first appeared in 1916, with revisions in 1921, but the government did not execute a national highway construction plan until Congress enacted an even more comprehensive version of the act in 1925. The original inspiration for a road between Chicago and Los Angeles was planned by entrepreneurs Cyrus Avery of Tulsa, Oklahoma, and John Woodruff of Springfield, Missouri, who lobbied the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) for the creation of a route following the 1925 plans.

From the outset, public road planners intended US 66 to connect the main streets of rural and urban communities along its course for the most practical of reasons: Most small towns had no prior access to a major national thoroughfare.

===Birthplace and rise of US 66===

The numerical designation 66 was assigned to the Chicago-to-Los Angeles route on April 30, 1926, in Springfield, Missouri. A placard in Park Central Square was dedicated to the city by the Route 66 Association of Missouri, and traces of the &quot;Mother Road&quot; are still visible in downtown Springfield, along Kearney Street, Glenstone Avenue, College, and St. Louis streets and on Route 266 to Halltown, Missouri.

Championed by Avery when the first talks about a national highway system began, US 66 was first signed into law in 1927 as one of the original U.S. Highways, although it was not completely paved until 1938. Avery was adamant that the highway have a round number and had proposed number 60 to identify it. A controversy erupted over the number 60, largely from delegates from Kentucky who wanted a Virginia Beach–Los Angeles highway to be US 60 and US 62 between Chicago and Springfield, Missouri. Arguments and counterarguments continued throughout February, including a proposal to split the proposed route through Kentucky into Route 60 North (to Chicago) and Route 60 South (to Newport News). The final conclusion was to have US 60 run between Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Springfield, Missouri, and the Chicago–L.A. route be US 62. Avery and highway engineer John Page settled on &quot;66&quot;, which was unassigned, despite the fact that in its entirety, US 66 was north of US 60.

The state of Missouri released its 1926 state highway map with the highway labeled as US 60.

After the new federal highway system was officially created, Cyrus Avery called for the establishment of the U.S. Highway 66 Association to promote the complete paving of the highway from end to end and to promote travel down the highway. In 1927, in Tulsa, the association was officially established with John T. Woodruff of Springfield, Missouri, elected the first president. In 1928, the association made its first attempt at publicity, the &quot;Bunion Derby&quot;, a footrace from Los Angeles to New York City, of which the path from Los Angeles to Chicago would be on US 66.

The publicity worked: several dignitaries, including Will Rogers, greeted the runners at certain points on the route. The race ended in Madison Square Garden, where the $25,000 first prize (equal to $ in ) was awarded to Andy Hartley Payne, a Cherokee runner from Oklahoma. The U.S. Highway 66 Association also placed its first advertisement in the July 16, 1932, issue of the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;. The ad invited Americans to take US 66 to the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. A U.S. Highway 66 Association office in Oklahoma received hundreds of requests for information after the ad was published. The association went on to serve as a voice for businesses along the highway until it disbanded in 1976.

Traffic grew on the highway because of the geography through which it passed. Much of the highway was essentially flat and this made the highway a popular truck route. The Dust Bowl of the 1930s saw many farming families, mainly from Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, and Texas, heading west for agricultural jobs in California. US 66 became the main road of travel for these people, often derogatorily called &quot;Okies&quot; or &quot;Arkies&quot;. During the Depression, it gave some relief to communities located on the highway. The route passed through numerous small towns and, with the growing traffic on the highway, helped create the rise of mom-and-pop businesses, such as service stations, restaurants, and motor courts, all readily accessible to passing motorists.


Much of the early highway, like all the other early highways, was gravel or graded dirt. Due to the efforts of the U.S. Highway 66 Association, US 66 became the first highway to be completely paved in 1938. Several places were dangerous: more than one part of the highway was nicknamed &quot;Bloody 66&quot; and gradually work was done to realign these segments to remove dangerous curves. One section through the Black Mountains outside Oatman, Arizona, was fraught with hairpin turns and was the steepest along the entire route, so much so that some early travellers, too frightened at the prospect of driving such a potentially dangerous road, hired locals to navigate the winding grade. The section remained as US 66 until 1953 and is still open to traffic today as the Oatman Highway. Despite such hazards in some areas, US 66 continued to be a popular route.

Notable buildings include the art deco–styled U-Drop Inn, constructed in 1936 in Shamrock, in Wheeler County east of Amarillo, Texas, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A restored Magnolia fuel station is also located in Shamrock as well as Vega, in Oldham County, west of Amarillo.

During World War II, more migration west occurred because of war-related industries in California. US 66, already popular and fully paved, became one of the main routes and also served for moving military equipment. Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri was located near the highway, which was locally upgraded quickly to a divided highway to help with military traffic. When Richard Feynman was working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, he used to travel nearly to visit his wife, who was dying of tuberculosis, in a sanatorium located on US 66 in Albuquerque.

In the 1950s, US 66 became the main highway for vacationers heading to Los Angeles. The road passed through the Painted Desert and near the Grand Canyon. Meteor Crater in Arizona was another popular stop. This sharp increase in tourism in turn gave rise to a burgeoning trade in all manner of roadside attractions, including teepee-shaped motels, frozen custard stands, Indian curio shops, and reptile farms. Meramec Caverns near St. Louis, began advertising on barns, billing itself as the &quot;Jesse James hideout&quot;. The Big Texan advertised a free steak dinner to anyone who could consume the entire meal in one hour. It also marked the birth of the fast-food industry: Red&#x27;s Giant Hamburg in Springfield, Missouri, site of the first drive-through restaurant, and the first McDonald&#x27;s in San Bernardino, California. Changes like these to the landscape further cemented 66&#x27;s reputation as a near-perfect microcosm of the culture of America, now linked by the automobile.

===Changes in routing===

Many sections of US 66 underwent major realignments.

In 1930, between the Illinois cities of Springfield and East St. Louis, US 66 was shifted farther east to what is now roughly Interstate 55 (I-55). The original alignment, marked as Temporary 66, followed the current Illinois Route 4 (IL 4).

From downtown St. Louis to Gray Summit, Missouri, US 66 originally went down Market Street and Manchester Road, which is largely Route 100. In 1932, this route was changed and the original alignment was never viewed as anything more than temporary. The planned route was down Watson Road, which is now Route 366 but Watson Road had not been completed yet.

In Oklahoma, from west of El Reno to Bridgeport, US 66 turned north to Calumet and then west to Geary, then southwest across the South Canadian River over a suspension toll bridge into Bridgeport. In 1933, a straighter cut-off route was completed from west of El Reno to south of Bridgeport, crossing over a 38-span steel pony truss bridge over the South Canadian River, bypassing Calumet and Geary by several miles.

From west of Santa Rosa, New Mexico, to north of Los Lunas, New Mexico, the road originally turned north from current I-40 along much of what is now US 84 to near Las Vegas, New Mexico, followed (roughly) I-25—then the decertified US 85 through Santa Fe and Albuquerque to Los Lunas and then turned northwest along the present New Mexico State Road 6 (NM 6) alignment to a point near Laguna. In 1937, a straight-line route was completed from west of Santa Rosa through Moriarty and east–west through Albuquerque and west to Laguna. This newer routing saved travelers as much as four hours of travel through New Mexico. According to legend, the rerouting was done at the behest of Democratic Governor Arthur T. Hannett to punish the Republican Santa Fe Ring, which had long dominated New Mexico out of Santa Fe.

In 1940, the first freeway in Los Angeles was incorporated into US 66; this was the Arroyo Seco Parkway, later known as the Pasadena Freeway; now again known as Arroyo Seco Parkway.
In 1953, the Oatman Highway through the Black Mountains was completely bypassed by a new route between Kingman, Arizona, and Needles, California; by the 1960s, Oatman, Arizona, was virtually abandoned as a ghost town.

Since the 1950s, as Interstates were being constructed, sections of US 66 not only saw the traffic drain to them, but often the route number itself was moved to the faster means of travel. In some cases, such as to the east of St. Louis, this was done as soon as the Interstate was finished to the next exit. The displacement of US 66 signage to the new freeways, combined with restrictions in the 1965 Highway Beautification Act that often denied merchants on the old road access to signage on the freeway, became factors in the closure of many established US 66 businesses as travelers could no longer easily find or reach them.

In 1936, US 66 was extended from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica to end at US 101 Alt., today the intersection of Olympic and Lincoln Boulevards. Even though there is a plaque dedicating US 66 as the &quot;Will Rogers Highway&quot; placed at the intersection of Ocean Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard, the highway never terminated there.

US 66 was rerouted around several larger cities via bypass or beltline routes to permit travelers to avoid city traffic congestion. Some of those cities included Springfield, Illinois; St. Louis, Missouri; Rolla, Missouri; Springfield, Missouri; Joplin, Missouri; and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The route was also a foundation for many chain stores back in the 1920s, sprouting up next to it to increase business and sales.

===Decline===


The beginning of the decline for US 66 came in 1956 with the signing of the Interstate Highway Act by President Dwight D. Eisenhower who was influenced by his experiences in 1919 as a young Army officer crossing the country in a truck convoy (following the route of the Lincoln Highway), and his appreciation of the Autobahn network as a necessary component of a national defense system.

During its nearly 60-year existence, US 66 was under constant change. As highway engineering became more sophisticated, engineers constantly sought more direct routes between cities and towns. Increased traffic led to a number of major and minor realignments of US 66 through the years, particularly in the years immediately following World War II when Illinois began widening US 66 to four lanes through virtually the entire state from Chicago to the Mississippi River just east of St. Louis, and included bypasses around virtually all of the towns. By the early to mid-1950s, Missouri also upgraded its sections of US 66 to four lanes complete with bypasses. Most of the newer four-lane 66 paving in both states was upgraded to freeway status in later years.

One notable remnant of US 66 is Veterans Parkway, signed as the Interstate 55 Business route, in Bloomington, Illinois. The sweeping curve on the southeast side of the city originally was intended to easily handle traffic at speeds up to , as part of an effort to make US 66 an &quot;Autobahn&quot; equivalent for military transport.

In 1953, the first major bypassing of US 66 occurred in Oklahoma with the opening of the Turner Turnpike between Tulsa and Oklahoma City. The new toll road paralleled US 66 for its entire length and bypassed each of the towns along US 66. The Turner Turnpike was joined in 1957 by the new Will Rogers Turnpike, which connected Tulsa with the Oklahoma-Missouri border west of Joplin, Missouri, again paralleling US 66 and bypassing the towns in northeastern Oklahoma in addition to its entire stretch through Kansas. Both Oklahoma turnpikes were soon designated as I-44, along with the US 66 bypass at Tulsa that connected the city with both turnpikes.

In some cases, such as many areas in Illinois, the new Interstate Highway not only paralleled the old US 66, it actually used much of the same roadway. A typical approach was to build one new set of lanes, then move one direction of traffic to it, while retaining the original set of lanes for traffic flowing in the opposite direction. Then a second set of lanes for traffic flowing in the other direction would be constructed, finally followed by abandoning the other old set of lanes or converting them into a frontage road.

The same scenario was used in western Oklahoma, when US 66 was initially upgraded to a four-lane highway such as from Sayre to Erick to the Texas border at Texola in 1957 and 1958 where the old paving was retained for westbound traffic and a new parallel lane built for eastbound traffic (much of this section was entirely bypassed by I-40 in 1975), and on two other sections; from Canute to Elk City in 1959 and Hydro to Weatherford in 1960, both of which were upgraded with the construction of a new westbound lane in 1966 to bring the highway up to full interstate standards and demoting the old US 66 paving to frontage road status. In the initial process of constructing I-40 across western Oklahoma, the state also included projects to upgrade the through routes in El Reno, Weatherford, Clinton, Canute, Elk City, Sayre, Erick, and Texola to four-lane highways not only to provide seamless transitions from the rural sections of I-40 from both ends of town but also to provide easy access to those cities in later years after the I-40 bypasses were completed.
In New Mexico, as in most other states, rural sections of I-40 were to be constructed first with bypasses around cities to come later. However, some business and civic leaders in cities along US 66 were completely opposed to bypassing fearing loss of business and tax revenues. In 1963, the New Mexico Legislature enacted legislation that banned the construction of interstate bypasses around cities by local request. This legislation was short-lived, however, due to pressures from Washington and threat of loss of federal highway funds so it was rescinded by 1965.

In 1964, Tucumcari and San Jon became the first cities in New Mexico to work out an agreement with state and federal officials in determining the locations of their I-40 bypasses as close to their business areas as possible in order to permit easy access for highway travelers to their localities. Other cities soon fell in line including Santa Rosa, Moriarty, Grants and Gallup although it wasn&#x27;t until well into the 1970s that most of those cities would be bypassed by I-40.

By the late 1960s, most of the rural sections of US 66 had been replaced by I-40 across New Mexico with the most notable exception being the strip from the Texas border at Glenrio west through San Jon to Tucumcari, which was becoming increasingly treacherous due to heavier and heavier traffic on the narrow two-lane highway. During 1968 and 1969, this section of US 66 was often referred to by locals and travelers as &quot;Slaughter Lane&quot; due to numerous injury and fatal accidents on this stretch.

Local and area business and civic leaders and news media called upon state and federal highway officials to get I-40 built through the area. Disputes over proposed highway routing in the vicinity of San Jon held up construction plans for several years as federal officials proposed that I-40 run some north of that city while local and state officials insisted on following a proposed route that touched the northern city limits of San Jon. In November 1969, a truce was reached when federal highway officials agreed to build the I-40 route just outside the city, therefore providing local businesses dependent on highway traffic easy access to and from the freeway via the north–south highway that crossed old US 66 in San Jon. I-40 was completed from Glenrio to the east side of San Jon in 1976 and extended west to Tucumcari in 1981, including the bypasses around both cities.
Originally, highway officials planned for the last section of US 66 to be bypassed by interstates in Texas, but as was the case in many places, lawsuits held up construction of the new interstates. The US Highway 66 Association had become a voice for the people who feared the loss of their businesses. Since the interstates only provided access via ramps at interchanges, travelers could not pull directly off a highway into a business. At first, plans were laid out to allow mainly national chains to be placed in interstate medians. Such lawsuits effectively prevented this on all but toll roads.

Some towns in Missouri threatened to sue the state if the US 66 designation was removed from the road, though lawsuits never materialized. Several businesses were well known to be on US 66, and fear of losing the number resulted in the state of Missouri officially requesting the designation &quot;Interstate 66&quot; for the St. Louis to Oklahoma City section of the route, but it was denied. In 1984, Arizona also saw its final stretch of highway decommissioned with the completion of I-40 just north of Williams, Arizona. Finally, with decertification of the highway by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials the following year, US 66 officially ceased to exist.

With the decommissioning of US 66, no single interstate route was designated to replace it, with the route being covered by Interstate 55 from Chicago to St. Louis, Interstate 44 from St. Louis to Oklahoma City, Interstate 40 from Oklahoma City to Barstow; Interstate 15 from Barstow to San Bernardino, and a combination of California State Route 66, I-210 and State Route 2 (SR 2) or I-10 from San Bernardino across the Los Angeles metropolitan area to Santa Monica.

===After decertification===
When the highway was decommissioned, sections of the road were disposed of in various ways. Within many cities, the route became a &quot;business loop&quot; for the interstate. Some sections became state roads, local roads, or private drives, or were abandoned completely. Although it is no longer possible to drive US 66 uninterrupted all the way from Chicago to Los Angeles, much of the original route and alternate alignments are still drivable with careful planning. Some stretches are quite well preserved, including one between Springfield, Missouri, and Tulsa, Oklahoma. Some sections of US 66 still retain their historic &quot;sidewalk highway&quot; form, never having been resurfaced to make them into full-width highways. These old sections have a single, paved lane, concrete curbs to mark the edge of the lane, and gravel shoulders for passing.

Some states have kept the 66 designation for parts of the highway, albeit as state roads. In Missouri, Routes 366, 266, and 66 are all original sections of the highway. State Highway 66 (SH-66) in Oklahoma remains as the alternate &quot;free&quot; route near its turnpikes. &quot;Historic Route 66&quot; runs for a significant distance in and near Flagstaff, Arizona. Farther west, a long segment of US 66 in Arizona runs significantly north of I-40, and much of it is designated as State Route 66 (SR 66). This runs from Seligman to Kingman, Arizona, via Peach Springs. A surface street stretch between San Bernardino and La Verne (known as Foothill Boulevard) to the east of Los Angeles retains its number as SR 66. Several county roads and city streets at various places along the old route have also retained the &quot;66&quot; number.

===Revival===
The first Route 66 associations were founded in Arizona in 1987 and, in 1989, Missouri (incorporated in 1990) and Illinois. Other groups in the other US 66 states soon followed. In 1990, the state of Missouri declared US 66 in that state a &quot;State Historic Route&quot;. The first &quot;Historic Route 66&quot; marker in Missouri was erected on Kearney Street at Glenstone Avenue in Springfield, Missouri (now replaced—the original sign has been placed at Route 66 State Park near Eureka). Other historic markers now line—at times sporadically—the entire length of road. In many communities, local groups have painted or stenciled the &quot;66&quot; and U.S. Route shield or outline directly onto the road surface, along with the state&#x27;s name. This is common in areas where conventional signage for &quot;Historic Route 66&quot; is a target of repeated theft by souvenir hunters.
Various sections of the road itself have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Arroyo Seco Parkway in the Los Angeles Area and US 66 in New Mexico have been made into National Scenic Byways. Williams Historic Business District and Urban Route 66, Williams were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and 1989, respectively. In 2005, the State of Missouri made the road a state scenic byway from Illinois to Kansas. In the cities of Rancho Cucamonga, Rialto, and San Bernardino in California, there are US 66 signs erected along Foothill Boulevard, and also on Huntington Drive in the city of Arcadia. &quot;Historic Route 66&quot; signs may be found along the old route on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, and along Foothill Boulevard in San Dimas, La Verne, and Claremont, California. The city of Glendora, California, renamed Alosta Avenue, its section of US 66, by calling it &quot;Route 66&quot;. Flagstaff, Arizona, renamed all but a few blocks of Santa Fe Avenue as &quot;Route 66&quot;. Until 2017, when it was moved to the nearby Millennium Park, the annual June Chicago Blues Festival was held each year in Grant Park and included a &quot;Route 66 Roadhouse&quot; stage on Columbus Avenue, a few yards north of old US 66/Jackson Boulevard (both closed to traffic for the festival), and a block west of the route&#x27;s former eastern terminus at US 41 Lake Shore Drive. Since 2001, Springfield, Illinois has annually held its &quot;International Route 66 Mother Road Festival&quot; in its downtown district surrounding the Old State Capitol.

Many preservation groups have tried to save and even landmark the old motels and neon signs along the road in some states.

In 1999, President Bill Clinton signed a &quot;National Route 66 Preservation Bill&quot; that provided for $10 million in matching fund grants for preserving and restoring the historic features along the route.

In 2008, the World Monuments Fund added US 66 to the World Monuments Watch as sites along the route such as gas stations, motels, cafés, trading posts and drive-in movie theaters are threatened by development in urban areas and by abandonment and decay in rural areas. The National Park Service developed a Route 66 &quot;Discover Our Shared Heritage&quot; Travel Itinerary describing over one hundred individual historic sites. As the popularity and mythical stature of US 66 has continued to grow, demands have begun to mount to improve signage, return US 66 to road atlases and revive its status as a continuous routing.

The U.S. Route 66 Recommissioning Initiative is a group that seeks to recertify US 66 as a US Highway along a combination of historic and modern alignments. The group&#x27;s redesignation proposal does not enjoy universal support, as requirements that the route meet modern US Highway system specifications could force upgrades that compromise its historic integrity or require US 66 signage be moved to Interstate highways for some portions of the route.

In 2018, the AASHTO designated the first sections of U.S. Bicycle Route 66, part of the United States Bicycle Route System, in Kansas and Missouri.

===National Museum of American History===
The National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. has a section on US 66 in its &quot;America on the Move&quot; exhibition. In the exhibit is a portion of pavement of the route taken from Bridgeport, Oklahoma and a restored car and truck of the type that would have been driven on the road in the 1930s. Also on display is a &quot;Hamons Court&quot; neon sign that hung at a gas station and tourist cabins near Hydro, Oklahoma, a &quot;CABINS&quot; neon sign that pointed to Ring&#x27;s Rest tourist cabins in Muirkirk, Maryland, as well as several post cards a traveler sent back to his future wife while touring the route.

===Museums and monuments in Oklahoma===
Elk City, Oklahoma has the National Route 66 &amp; Transportation Museum, which encompasses all eight states through which the Mother Road ran. Clinton has the Oklahoma Route 66 Museum, designed to display the iconic ideas, images, and myths of the Mother Road. A memorial museum to the Route&#x27;s namesake, Will Rogers, is located in Claremore, while his birthplace ranch is maintained in Oologah. In Sapulpa, the Heart of Route 66 Auto Museum features a replica gas pump, the world&#x27;s tallest.

Tulsa has multiple sites, starting with the Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza, located at the east end of the historic 11th Street Bridge over which the route passed, and which includes a giant sculpture weighing called &quot;East Meets West&quot;. The sculpture depicts the Avery family riding west in a Model T Ford meeting an eastbound horse-drawn carriage. In 2020, Avery Plaza Southwest opened, at the west end of the bridge, which features a &quot;neon park&quot; with replicas of the neon signs from Tulsa-area Route 66 motels of the era, including the Tulsa Auto Court, the Oil Capital Motel, and the famous bucking-bronco sign of the Will Rogers Motor Court. Future plans for that site also include a Route 66 Museum. Also, Tulsa has installed &quot;Route 66 Rising&quot;, a sculpture on the road&#x27;s former eastern approach to town at East Admiral Place and Mingo Road.

On Tulsa&#x27;s Southwest Boulevard, between W. 23rd and W. 24th Streets there is a granite marker dedicated to Route 66 as the Will Rogers Highway which features an image of namesake Will Rogers together with information on the route from Michael Wallis, author of &quot;Route 66: The Mother Road&quot;; and, at Howard Park just past W. 25th Street, three Indiana limestone pillars are dedicated to Route 66 through Tulsa, with Route 66 #1 devoted to Transportation, Route 66 #2 devoted to Tulsa Industry and Native American Heritage, and Route 66 #3 devoted to Art Deco Architecture and American Culture.

At 3770 Southwest Blvd. is the Route 66 Historical Village, which includes a tourism information center modeled after a 1920s-1930s gas station, and other period-appropriate artifacts such as the Frisco 4500 steam locomotive with train cars. Elsewhere, Tulsa has constructed twenty-nine historical markers scattered along the 26-mile route of the highway through Tulsa, containing tourist-oriented stories, historical photos, and a map showing the location of historical sites and the other markers. The markers are mostly along the highway&#x27;s post-1932 alignment down 11th Street, with some along the road&#x27;s 1926 path down Admiral Place.

===Museum and Hall of Fame in Illinois===
The Route 66 Association of Illinois maintains their Museum and Hall of Fame in Pontiac. This free museum contains memorabilia and artifacts relating to Route 66, particularly in Illinois, as well as displays relating to the members of the Hall of Fame. Among items on display are the VW Microbus and &quot;land yacht&quot; belonging to the late Bob Waldmire.

==Route description==
Over the years, US 66 received numerous nicknames. Right after US 66 was commissioned, it was known as &quot;The Great Diagonal Way&quot; because the Chicago-to-Oklahoma City stretch ran northeast to southwest. Later, US 66 was advertised by the U.S. Highway 66 Association as &quot;The Main Street of America&quot;. The title had also been claimed by supporters of US 40, but the US 66 group was more successful. In the John Steinbeck novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, the highway is called &quot;The Mother Road&quot;, its prevailing title today. Lastly, US 66 was unofficially named &quot;The Will Rogers Highway&quot; by the U.S. Highway 66 Association in 1952, although a sign along the road with that name appeared in the John Ford film, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath,&quot; which was released in 1940, twelve years before the association gave the road that name. A plaque dedicating the highway to Will Rogers is still located in Santa Monica, California. There are more plaques like this; one can be found in Galena, Kansas. It was originally located on the Kansas-Missouri state line, but moved to the Howard Litch Memorial Park in 2001.

===California===

US 66 had its western terminus in California, and covered in the state. The terminus was located at the Pacific Coast Highway, then US 101 Alternate and now SR 1, at Lincoln and Olympic Boulevards in Santa Monica, California. The highway ran through major cities such as Santa Monica, Los Angeles, Pasadena, and San Bernardino. San Bernardino also contains one of the two surviving Wigwam Motels along US 66. The highway had major intersections with US 101 in Hollywood, I-5 in Los Angeles, I-15, and I-40 in Barstow, and US 95 in Needles. It also ran concurrent to I-40 at California&#x27;s very eastern end.

===Arizona===
In Arizona, the highway originally covered in the state. Along much of the way, US 66 paralleled I-40. It entered across the Topock Gorge, passing through Oatman along the way to Kingman. Between Kingman and Seligman, the route is still signed as SR 66. Notably, just between Seligman and Flagstaff, Williams was the last point on US 66 to be bypassed by an Interstate. The route also passed through the once-incorporated community of Winona. Holbrook contains one of the two surviving Wigwam Motels on the route.

===New Mexico===
US 66 covered in the state and passed through many Indian reservations in the western half of New Mexico. East of those reservations, the highway passed through Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Las Vegas. As in Arizona, in New Mexico, U.S. 66 paralleled I-40.

===Texas===

US 66 covered in the Texas Panhandle, travelling in an east–west line between Glenrio, New Mexico and Texas and Texola, Oklahoma. Adrian, in the western Panhandle, was notable as the midpoint of the route. East of there, the highway passed through Amarillo (famous for the Cadillac Ranch), Conway, Groom, and Shamrock.

===Oklahoma and Kansas===
The highway covered in Oklahoma. Today, it is marked by I-40 west of Oklahoma City, and SH-66 east of there. After entering at Texola, US 66 passed through Sayre, Elk City, and Clinton before entering Oklahoma City. Beyond Oklahoma City, the highway passed through Edmond on its way to Tulsa. Past there, US 66 passed through Miami, North Miami, Commerce, and Quapaw before entering Kansas where it covered only . Only three towns are located on the route in Kansas: Galena, Riverton and Baxter Springs.

===Missouri===
US 66 covered in Missouri. Upon entering from Galena, Kansas, the highway passed through Joplin. From there, it passed through Carthage, Springfield, where Red&#x27;s Giant Hamburg, the world&#x27;s first drive-thru stands, Waynesville, Devils Elbow, Lebanon and Rolla before passing through St. Louis.

===Illinois===
US 66 covered in Illinois. It entered Illinois in East St. Louis after crossing the Mississippi River. Near there, it passed by Cahokia Mounds, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The highway then passed through Hamel, Springfield, passing by the Illinois State Capitol, Bloomington-Normal, Pontiac, and Gardner. It then entered the Chicago area, originally through Joliet and later through Plainfield. After passing through the suburbs, U.S. 66 entered Chicago itself, where it terminated at Lake Shore Drive starting in 1938, having originally ended at Michigan Avenue.

==Special routes==
Several alternate alignments of US 66 occurred because of traffic issues. Business routes (BUS), bypass routes (BYP),
alternate routes (ALT), and &quot;optional routes&quot; (OPT) (an early designation for alternate routes) came into being.

==In popular culture==
US 66 has been a fixture in popular culture. American pop-culture artists publicized US 66 and the experience, through song and television. Bobby Troup wrote &quot;(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66&quot;, which was popularized by Nat King Cole with the King Cole Trio, and later covered by artists ranging from Chuck Berry and Glenn Frey to The Manhattan Transfer, John Mayer, and Brian Setzer, as well as the Rolling Stones in their eponymous debut album. The highway lent its name to the &quot;Route 66&quot; TV series in the 1960s, which itself had a popular theme song written and arranged by Nelson Riddle. The novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, adapted to film in 1940, depicts the Joad family traveling to California on US 66 after being evicted from their small farm in Oklahoma.

66 is the path of a people in flight, refugees from dust and shrinking land, from the thunder of tractors and shrinking ownership, from the desert&#x27;s slow northward invasion, from the twisting winds that howl up out of Texas, from the floods that bring no richness to the land and steal what little richness is there. From all of these the people are in flight, and they come into 66 from the tributary side roads, from the wagon tracks and the rutted country roads. 66 is the mother road, the road of flight.

The 2006 animated film &quot;Cars&quot; had the working title &quot;Route 66&quot;, and described the decline of the fictional Radiator Springs, nearly a ghost town once its mother road, US 66, was bypassed by Interstate 40. The title was eventually changed to simply &quot;Cars&quot; to avoid confusion with the 1960s television series.

On April 30, 2022, the 96th anniversary of the route&#x27;s numerical designation, Route 66 was honored with a video Google Doodle.

<doc id="79720" wikidata="Q16876104" url="?curid=79720" title="Luther (surname)">
<text>As a German surname, Luther is derived from a Germanic personal name compounded from the words &quot;liut&quot;, &quot;salvation&quot;, and &quot;heri&quot;, &quot;army&quot;. As a rare English surname, it means lute player. Luther is also derived from the Greek name &quot;Eleutherius&quot;. &quot;Eleutherius&quot; is a cognate of the Greek word &quot;eleutheros&quot; (ἐλεύθερος) which means &quot;free&quot;. 

As a personal name, Luther is a boy&#x27;s name of German origin meaning &quot;the salvation army&quot;. It was once restricted to Evangelical Protestants honoring the ecclesiastical reformer and theologian Martin Luther, founder of the Protestant Church.

<text>A toll road, also known as a turnpike or tollway, is a public or private road for which a fee (or &quot;toll&quot;) is assessed for passage. It is a form of road pricing typically implemented to help recoup the costs of road construction and maintenance.

Toll roads have existed in some form since antiquity, with tolls levied on passing travelers on foot, wagon, or horseback; a practice that continued with the automobile, and many modern tollways charge fees for motor vehicles exclusively. The amount of the toll usually varies by vehicle type, weight, or number of axles, with freight trucks often charged higher rates than cars.
Tolls are often collected at toll plazas, toll booths, toll houses, toll stations, toll bars, toll barriers, or toll gates. Some toll collection points are automatic, and the user deposits money in a machine which opens the gate once the correct toll has been paid. To cut costs and minimise time delay, many tolls are collected with electronic toll collection equipment which automatically communicates with a toll payer&#x27;s transponder or uses automatic number-plate recognition to charge drivers by debiting their accounts.

Criticisms of toll roads include the time taken to stop and pay the toll, and the cost of the toll booth operators—up to about one-third of revenue in some cases. Automated toll-paying systems help minimise both of these. Others object to paying &quot;twice&quot; for the same road, namely in fuel taxes and in tolls.

In addition to toll roads, toll bridges and toll tunnels are also used by public authorities to generate funds to repay the cost of building the structures. Some tolls are set aside to pay for future maintenance or enhancement of infrastructure, or are applied as a general fund by local governments, not being earmarked for transport facilities. This is sometimes limited or prohibited by central government legislation. Also, road congestion pricing schemes have been implemented in a limited number of urban areas as a transportation demand management tool to try to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution.

==History==


===Ancient times===
Toll roads have existed for at least the last 2,700 years, as tolls had to be paid by travellers using the Susa–Babylon highway under the regime of Ashurbanipal, who reigned in the seventh century BC.

Aristotle and Pliny refer to tolls in Arabia and other parts of Asia. In India, before the fourth century BC, the Arthashastra notes the use of tolls. Germanic tribes charged tolls to travellers across mountain passes.

===Middle Ages===

Most roads were not freely open to travel on in Europe during the Middle Ages, and the toll was one of many feudal fees paid for rights of usage in everyday life. Some major European &quot;highways&quot;, such as the Via Regia and Via Imperii, offered protection to travelers in exchange for paying the royal toll.

Many modern European roads were originally constructed as toll roads in order to recoup the costs of construction and maintenance, and to generate revenue from passing travelers. In 14th-century England, some of the most heavily used roads were repaired with money raised from tolls by pavage grants. Widespread toll roads sometimes restricted traffic so much, by their high tolls, that they interfered with trade and cheap transportation needed to alleviate local famines or shortages.

Tolls were used in the Holy Roman Empire in the 14th and 15th centuries.

===17th-century Dahomey===
After significant road construction undertaken by the West African kingdom of Dahomey, toll booths were also established with the function of collecting yearly taxes based on the goods carried by the people of Dahomey and their occupation. In some cases, officials imposed fines for public nuisance before allowing people to pass.

===19th century===
Industrialisation in Europe needed major improvements to the transport infrastructure which included many new or substantially improved roads, financed from tolls. The A5 road in Britain was built to provide a robust transport link between Britain and Ireland and had a toll house every few miles.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, road tolls were introduced in Europe to finance the construction of motorway networks and specific transport infrastructure such as bridges and tunnels. 
Italy was the first country in the world to build motorways reserved for fast traffic and for motor vehicles only. The &quot;Autostrada dei Laghi&quot; (&quot;Lakes Motorway&quot;), the first built in the world, connecting Milan to Lake Como and Lake Maggiore, and now parts of the Autostrada A8 and Autostrada A9, was devised by Piero Puricelli and was inaugurated in 1924. Piero Puricelli, a civil engineer and entrepreneur, received the first authorization to build a public-utility fast road in 1921, and completed the construction (one lane in each direction) between 1924 and 1926. Piero Puricelli decided to cover the expenses by introducing a toll.

It was followed by Greece, which made users pay for the network of motorways around and between its cities in 1927. Later in the 1950s and 1960s, France, Spain, and Portugal started to build motorways largely with the aid of concessions, allowing rapid development of this infrastructure without massive state debts. Since then, road tolls have been introduced in the majority of the EU member states.
In the United States, prior to the introduction of the Interstate Highway System and the large federal grants supplied to states to build it, many states constructed their first freeways by floating bonds backed by toll revenues. The first major fully grade separated toll road was the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1940. This was followed up by other toll roads, such as the Maine Turnpike in 1947, the Blue Star Turnpike in 1950, the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951, the Garden State Parkway in 1952, the West Virginia Turnpike and New York State Thruway in 1954, the Massachusetts Turnpike in 1957, and the Chicago Skyway and Indiana Toll Road in 1958. Other toll roads were also established around this time. With the establishment of the Interstate Highway System in the late 1950s, toll road construction in the U.S. slowed down considerably, as the federal government now provided the bulk of funding to construct new freeways, and regulations required that such Interstate highways be free from tolls. Many older toll roads were added to the Interstate System under a grandfather clause that allowed tolls to continue to be collected on toll roads that predated the system. Some of these such as the Connecticut Turnpike and the Richmond–Petersburg Turnpike later removed their tolls when the initial bonds were paid off. Many states, however, have maintained the tolling of these roads as a consistent source of revenue.

As the Interstate Highway System approached completion during the 1980s, states began constructing toll roads again to provide new freeways which were not part of the original interstate system funding. Houston&#x27;s outer beltway of interconnected toll roads began in 1983, and many states followed over the last two decades of the 20th century adding new toll roads, including the tollway system around Orlando, Florida, Colorado&#x27;s E-470, and Georgia State Route 400.

===21st century===

London, in an effort to reduce traffic within the city, instituted the London congestion charge in 2003, effectively making all roads within the centre of the city tolled.

In the United States, as states looked for ways to construct new freeways without federal funding again, to raise revenue for continued road maintenance, and to control congestion, new toll road construction saw significant increases during the first two decades of the 21st century. Spurred on by two innovations, the electronic toll collection system, and the advent of high-occupancy and express lane tolls, many areas of the U.S. saw large road building projects in major urban areas. Electronic toll collection, first introduced in the 1980s, reduces operating costs by removing toll collectors from roads. Tolled express lanes, by which certain lanes of a freeway are designated &quot;toll only&quot;, increases revenue by allowing a free-to-use highway to collect revenue by allowing drivers to bypass traffic jams by paying a toll.

The E-ZPass system, compatible with many state systems, is the largest ETC system in the U.S., and is used for both fully tolled highways and tolled express lanes. Maryland Route 200 and the Triangle Expressway in North Carolina were the first toll roads built without toll booths, with drivers charged via ETC or by optical license plate recognition and are billed by mail. In addition, many older toll roads are also being upgraded to an all-electronic tolling system, abandoning the hybrid systems they adopted during the late 20th century. These include the Massachusetts Turnpike, one of the oldest American toll roads, which went all-electronic in 2016, and the Pennsylvania Turnpike, America&#x27;s oldest toll freeway, which went all-electronic in 2020, along with the Illinois Tollway, which both accelerated their transitions to such due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
==By country==
===Toll roads in the United Kingdom===
Turnpike trusts were established in England and Wales from about 1706 in response to the need for better roads than the few and poorly-maintained tracks then available. Turnpike trusts were set up by individual Acts of Parliament, with powers to collect road tolls to repay loans for building, improving, and maintaining the principal roads in Britain. At their peak, in the 1830s, over 1,000 trusts administered around of turnpike road in England and Wales, taking tolls at almost 8,000 toll-gates.

The trusts were ultimately responsible for the maintenance and improvement of most of the main roads in England and Wales, which were used to distribute agricultural and industrial goods economically. The tolls were a source of revenue for road building and maintenance, paid for by road users and not from general taxation. The turnpike trusts were gradually abolished from the 1870s. Most trusts improved existing roads, but some new roads, usually only short stretches, were also built. Thomas Telford&#x27;s Holyhead road followed Watling Street from London but was exceptional in creating a largely new route beyond Shrewsbury, and especially beyond Llangollen. Built in the early 19th century, with many toll booths along its length, most of it is now the A5. In the modern day, one major toll road is the M6 Toll, relieving traffic congestion on the M6 in Birmingham. A few notable bridges and tunnels continue as toll roads including the Dartford Crossing and Mersey Gateway bridge.
===Toll roads in Canada===
Some cities in Canada had toll roads in the 19th century. Roads radiating from Toronto required users to pay at toll gates along the street (Yonge Street, Bloor Street, Davenport Road, Kingston Road) but the toll gates disappeared after 1895.

===Toll roads in the United States===

In the eastern United States of the 18th and 19th century, hundreds of private turnpikes were created to facilitate travel between towns and cities, typically outside built-up areas.

19th-century plank roads were usually operated as toll roads. One of the first US motor roads, the Long Island Motor Parkway (which opened on October 10, 1908) was built by William Kissam Vanderbilt II, the great-grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt. The road was closed in 1938 when it was taken over by the state of New York in lieu of back taxes.

=== Toll roads in Russia ===
The first toll road in St. Petersburg appeared in the 2000s. The Western High-Speed Diameter (WHSD) is a multilane motorway running from the South to the North. The road connects the southwest of the city, including the Sea Port area, with the Ring Road, Vasilievsky Island, Kurortny district and the Scandinavia motorway. The WHSD is divided into three sections: Southern, Central and Northern. The entire stretch of the WHSD was opened for traffic in 2016.

There are 16 toll plazas on the WHSD. Paying toll by transponder is mostly recommended for frequent drivers. The Flow+ toll collection system was implemented on the WHSD. The system was designed for automatic calculation of the driving distance of a vehicle equipped with a transponder. The system does not require constructing toll plazas at each entrance to or exit from the highway. Transponders mounted on vehicles are read by signal receivers installed at the entrance and exit ramps.

=== Toll roads in Italy ===

In Italy the only toll roads are the &quot;autostrade&quot; (Italian for motorways). Major exceptions are the beltways around some larger cities (&quot;tangenziali&quot;) which are not part of a thoroughfare motorway, and the Autostrada A2 between Salerno and Reggio di Calabria which is operated by the government-owned ANAS. Both are toll free.

On Italian motorways, the toll applies to almost all motorways not managed by Anas. The collection of motorway tolls, from a tariff point of view, is managed mainly in two ways: either through the &quot;closed motorway system&quot; (km travelled) or through the &quot;open motorway system&quot; (flat-rate toll).

Given the multiplicity of operators, the toll is only requested when exiting the motorway and not when the motorway operator changes. This system was made possible following article 14 of law 531 of 12 August 1982.

From a technical point of view, however, the mixed barrier/free-flow system is active where, at the entrance and exit from the motorways, there are lanes dedicated to the collection of a ticket (on entry) and the delivery of the ticket with simultaneous payment (on exit) and other lanes where, during transit without the need to stop, an electronic toll system present in the vehicles records the data and debits the toll, generally into the bank account previously communicated by the customer, to the manager of his device. In Italy, this occurs through the Autostrade per l&#x27;Italia interchange system.

The Autostrada A36, Autostrada A59 and Autostrada A60 are exclusively free-flow. On these motorways, those who do not have the electronic toll device on board must proceed with the payment by subsequently communicating the data to the motorway manager (by telephone, online or by going to the offices dedicated to payment).

The closed motorway system is applied to most Italian motorways. It requires the driver of the vehicle to collect a special ticket at the entrance to the motorway and pay the amount due upon exit. If equipped with an electronic toll system the two procedures are completely automatic and the driver on the detection lanes located at the entrances and exits from the motorways subject to toll payment must only proceed at a maximum speed of without the need to stop. The amount is directly proportional to the distance travelled by the vehicle, the coefficient of its class and a variable coefficient from motorway to motorway, called the kilometre rate. 

Unlike the closed motorway system, in the open system, the road user does not pay based on the distance travelled. Motorway barriers are arranged along the route (however not at every junction), at which the user pays a fixed sum, depending only on the class of the vehicle. The user can therefore travel along sections of the motorway without paying any toll as the barriers may not be present on the section travelled.

== Charging methods ==

Road tolls were levied traditionally for a specific access (e.g. city) or for a specific infrastructure (e.g. roads, bridges). These concepts were widely used until the last century. However, the evolution in technology made it possible to implement road tolling policies based on different concepts. The different charging concepts are designed to suit different requirements regarding purpose of the charge, charging policy, the network to the charge, tariff class differentiation, et cetera:

* Time-based charges and access fees: In a time-based charging regime, a road user has to pay for a given period of time in which they may use the associated infrastructure. For the practically identical access fees, the user pays for the access to a restricted zone for a period or several days.
* Motorway and other infrastructure tolling: The term tolling is used for charging a well-defined special and comparatively costly infrastructure, like a bridge, a tunnel, a mountain pass, a motorway concession, or the whole motorway network of a country. Classically a toll is due when a vehicle passes a tolling station, be it a manual barrier-controlled toll plaza or a free-flow multi-lane station.
* Distance or area charging: In a distance or area charging system concept, vehicles are charged per total distance driven in a defined area.

Some toll roads charge a toll in only one direction. Examples include the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour Tunnel, and Eastern Distributor (these all charge tolls city-bound) in Australia, in the United States, crossings between Pennsylvania and New Jersey operated by Delaware River Port Authority and crossings between New Jersey and New York operated by Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. This technique is practical where the detour to avoid the toll is large or the toll differences are small.

==Collection methods==

Traditionally, tolls were paid by hand at a toll gate. Although payments may still be made in cash, it is more common now to pay using an electronic toll collection system. In some places, payment is made using transponders which are affixed to the windscreen.

Three systems of toll roads exist: &quot;open&quot; (with mainline barrier toll plazas); &quot;closed&quot; (with entry/exit tolls); and &quot;open road&quot; (no toll booths, only electronic toll collection gantries at entrances and exits or at strategic locations on the median of the road). Some toll roads use a combination of the three systems.

On an open toll system, all vehicles stop at various locations along the highway to pay a toll. (This is different from &quot;open road tolling&quot;, where &quot;no&quot; vehicles stop to pay a toll.) While this may save money from the lack of need to construct toll booths at every exit, it can cause traffic congestion while traffic queues at the mainline toll plazas (toll barriers). It is also possible for motorists to enter an &#x27;open toll road&#x27; after one toll barrier and exit before the next one, thus travelling on the toll road toll-free. Most open toll roads have ramp tolls or partial access junctions to prevent this practice, known in the U.S. as &quot;shunpiking&quot;.

With a closed toll system, vehicles collect a ticket when entering the highway. In some cases, the ticket displays the toll to be paid on exit. Upon exit, the driver must pay the amount listed for the given exit. Should the ticket be lost, a driver must typically pay the maximum amount possible for travel on that highway. Short toll roads with no intermediate entries or exits may have only one toll plaza at one end, with motorists travelling in either direction paying a flat fee either when they enter or when they exit the toll road. In a variant of the closed toll system, mainline barriers are present at the two endpoints of the toll road, and each interchange has a ramp toll that is paid upon exit or entry. In this case, a motorist pays a flat fee at the ramp toll and another flat fee at the end of the toll road; no ticket is necessary. In addition, with most systems, motorists may pay tolls only with cash or change; debit and credit cards are not accepted. However, some toll roads may have travel plazas with ATMs so motorists can stop and withdraw cash for the tolls.

The toll is calculated by the distance travelled on the toll road or the specific exit chosen. In the United States, for instance, the Kansas Turnpike, Ohio Turnpike, New Jersey Turnpike, most of the Indiana Toll Road, New York State Thruway, and Florida&#x27;s Turnpike currently implement closed systems.

The Union Toll Plaza on the Garden State Parkway was the first ever to use an automated toll collection machine. A plaque commemorating the event includes the first quarter collected at its toll booths.

The first major deployment of an RFID electronic toll collection system in the United States was on the Dallas North Tollway in 1989 by Amtech (see TollTag). The Amtech RFID technology used on the Dallas North Tollway was originally developed at Sandia Labs for use in tagging and tracking livestock. In the same year, the Telepass active transponder RFID system was introduced across Italy. Several US states now use mobile tolling platforms to facilitate use of payment via smartphones.

Highway 407 in the province of Ontario, Canada, has no toll booths, and instead reads a transponder mounted on the windshields of each vehicle using the road (the rear licence plates of vehicles lacking a transponder are photographed when they enter and exit the highway). This made the highway the first all-automated toll highway in the world. A bill is mailed monthly for usage of the 407. Lower charges are levied on frequent 407 users who carry electronic transponders in their vehicles. The approach has not been without controversy: In 2003 the 407 ETR settled a class action with a refund to users.

Throughout most of the East Coast of the United States, E-ZPass (operated under the brand I-Pass in Illinois) is accepted on almost all toll roads. Similar systems include SunPass in Florida, FasTrak in California, Good to Go in Washington state, and ExpressToll in Colorado. The systems use a small radio transponder mounted in or on a customer&#x27;s vehicle to deduct toll fares from a pre-paid account as the vehicle passes through the toll barrier. This reduces manpower at toll booths and increases traffic flow and fuel efficiency by reducing the need for complete stops to pay tolls at these locations.

By designing a toll gate specifically for electronic collection, it is possible to carry out open-road tolling, where the customer does not need to slow at all when passing through the toll gate. The U.S. state of Texas is using a system that has no toll booths. Drivers without a TollTag have their license plate photographed automatically and the registered owner will receive a monthly bill, at a higher rate than those vehicles with TollTags. A similar variation of automatic collection is the Toll Roads in Orange County, CA, US, wherein all entry or collection points are equipped with high-speed cameras which read license plates and users will have 7 calendar days to pay online using their plate number or else set up an account for automatic debits.

The first all-electronic toll road in the northeastern United States, the InterCounty Connector (Maryland Route 200) was partially opened to traffic in February 2011, and the final segment was completed in November 2014. The first section of another all-electronic toll road, the Triangle Expressway, opened at the beginning of 2012 in North Carolina.

==Financing and management==
Some toll roads are managed under such systems as the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) system. Private companies build the roads and are given a limited franchise. Ownership is transferred to the government when the franchise expires. This type of arrangement is prevalent in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. The BOT system is a fairly new concept that is becoming more popular in the United States, with California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia already building and operating toll roads under this scheme. Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Tennessee are also considering the BOT methodology for future highway projects.

The more traditional means of managing toll roads in the United States is through semi-autonomous public authorities. Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia manage their toll roads in this manner. While most of the toll roads in California, Delaware, Florida, Texas, and Virginia are operating under the BOT arrangement, a few of the older toll roads in these states are still operated by public authorities.

In France, some toll roads are operated by private or public companies, with specific taxes collected by the state.

== Arguments against toll roads ==
Toll roads have been criticised as being inefficient in various ways:
# They require vehicles to stop or slow down (except open road tolling); manual toll collection wastes time and raises vehicle operating costs.
# Collection costs can reduce revenue by up to a third, and revenue theft is considered to be comparatively easy.
# Where the tolled roads are less congested than the parallel &quot;free&quot; roads, the traffic diversion resulting from the tolls increases congestion on the road system and reduces its usefulness.
# There are concerns about government surveillance associated with both electronic tolls and some forms of &quot;classical&quot; toll collection.

A number of additional criticisms are also directed at toll roads in general:
# Toll roads are a form of regressive taxation; that is, compared to conventional taxes for funding roads, they benefit wealthier citizens more than poor citizens.
# If toll roads are owned or managed by private for profit entities, the citizens may lose money overall compared to conventional public funding because the private owners or operators of the toll system will naturally seek to profit from the roads.
# The managing entities, whether public or private, may not correctly account for the overall social costs, particularly to the poor, when setting pricing and thus may hurt the neediest segments of society.

== Arguments in favor of toll roads==
* Tolls help internalize some of the externalities of automobiles, that is costs automobile traffic imposes on society that are not borne by users.
* Through dynamic pricing trips that do not have to occur at rush hour can be moved to other times of the day or be avoided altogether. This makes more efficient use of existing road capacity.

<text>The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s is a 1945 American musical comedy-drama film, produced and directed by Leo McCarey and starring Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman. Written by Dudley Nichols and based on a story by McCarey, the film is about a priest and a nun who, despite their good-natured rivalry, try to save their school from being shut down. The character Father O&#x27;Malley had been previously portrayed by Crosby in the 1944 film &quot;Going My Way&quot;, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film was produced by Leo McCarey&#x27;s production company, Rainbow Productions.

==Plot==
The unconventional Father Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; O&#x27;Malley is assigned to St. Mary&#x27;s parish. Upon arriving at his quarters, the housekeeper warns him that their last priest prematurely aged while there. His duties include overseeing a nun-run, run-down inner-city school.

The first time Father O&#x27;Malley has been responsible for a school, he&#x27;s nervous he must address the large group of nuns. While he&#x27;s trying to make some opening remarks, they continually giggle which disconcerts him. Finally he discovers a playful kitten was upstaging him.

Getting a tour by Sister Superior Mary Benedict, O&#x27;Malley is to recommend whether or not the school should be closed and the children sent to another school with modern facilities. However, the sisters feel that God will provide for them and put their hopes in Horace P. Bogardus, a businessman who has constructed a modern building next door to the school on land he had bought from them. They are hoping he will donate it to them.

Father O&#x27;Malley and the dedicated but stubborn Sister Benedict both wish to save the school, but their different views and methods often lead to disagreements. The Father has admitted eighth-grade student, Patsy of Syracuse, New York, whom the parish has taken in while her mother attempts to get back on her feet. He is told that, although she had been married to the father, the musician had gone to Cincinnati but broke his promise to send for her.

When Patsy falls behind, Benedict questions O&#x27;Malley, concerned about her background. Respecting the mother&#x27;s privacy, he deflects her questions.

They have another clash involving student Eddie, who is being bullied by another, newer student. Concerned, the former tomboy although at first teaching the children to turn the other cheek, decides to teach him boxing from a manual.

The Father &quot;coaches&quot; Patsy to be original in a paper for Sister Benedict, earning her a high mark. When the bully next trips Eddie, the Sister coaches from the sidelines, and not only does he hold his own, but he makes peace and offers friendship to him.

They plant a seed of an idea to Mr. Bogardus. After being shown around the building, they point out that his donation of the building to the school would be his great legacy. Later, when he gets worked up over another costly delay, his doctor points out the stress is bad for his heart.

Father O&#x27;Malley surprises Patsy&#x27;s mother with a reunion with her estranged husband. He found him via the musicians&#x27; union, as he&#x27;s a musician. They reconcile, surprising Patsy when she sees them kiss, who had come to show her mother her graduation dress.

At her exams, Patsy is upset. The Father visits Sister Benedict, who tells him her marks are too low to pass. When he tries to convince her to pass her anyway, they butt heads. He points out the self-esteem issues that come with failing and talks about a very successful business owner in town who had had difficulties at school.

Mr. Bogardus, convinced by his doctor that doing so will prolong his life, starts to do selfless acts. He gives a blind beggar money, helps an older woman to get on the bus, adopts a homeless dog and ultimately gives the sisters his building for the school.

Patsy is finally introduced to the man she had seen kissing her mother, her father. She admits to sister Benedict that she intentionally failed her exams so she could be held back a year and stay with Sister Benedict. Patsy demonstrates knowing the material that was on the exam. Knowing this, Sister Benedict allows Patsy to graduate.

Preparations are being made with getting the new building set, and Sister Benedict enthusiastically oversees setting up the new facility. Unfortunately, Father O&#x27;Malley has to break the news that her placement has changed.

As Sister Benedict contracted tuberculosis, the physician recommends to Father O&#x27;Malley that she be transferred to a dry climate with non-parochial duties, but without telling her the reason. She assumes the transfer is because of her disagreements with O&#x27;Malley and struggles to understand the reasons for the path set out for her. Just before Sister Benedict departs, Father O&#x27;Malley reveals the true reason for her temporary transfer, and she then leaves happily, looking forward to her return.

==Cast==


==Reception==
The film holds rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews, with an average rating of . 
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that the film was too similar to &quot;Going My Way&quot;, and &quot;although a plenteous and sometimes winning show, lacks the charm of its predecessor—and that comparison cannot be escaped.&quot; The reviewer for &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Picture is packed with many simple scenes that tug at the heart and loosen the tears as directed by McCarey and played by the outstanding cast.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; commented: &quot;As in &quot;Going My Way&quot;, which he also wrote, produced, and directed, Leo McCarey has proved again that great pictures do not require pretentious stories ... The acting of the entire cast is excellent. Crosby delights one with his ease and natural charm, and Miss Bergman will undoubtedly rise to new heights of popularity because of the effective way in which she portrays her role.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote derisively: &quot;Mr. McCarey seems to view the Roman Catholic Church, which is quite a formidable and venerable organization, as a kind of settlement house where good works and jollity provide a lively substitute for religion ... Everything, of course, turns out quite happily, except, perhaps, for those captious souls who regard religion as an adult matter.&quot;

&quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; placed fourth on &quot;Film Daily&quot;″s year-end nationwide poll of 559 critics naming the best films of 1946.

===Box-office===
The film earned receipts of $8 million in North America during its initial run, making it the highest-grossing movie of 1945 in the USA.

It made a profit of $3,715,000, making it the most profitable film in the history of RKO. Adjusted for inflation, it is considered the 57th highest-grossing film of all time.

==Soundtrack==
* &quot;Aren&#x27;t You Glad You&#x27;re You?&quot; (Jimmy Van Heusen / Johnny Burke) sung by Bing Crosby
* &quot;Adeste Fideles&quot; sung by Bing Crosby and children&#x27;s choir
* &quot;In the Land of Beginning Again&quot; (George W. Meyer / Grant Clarke) sung by Bing Crosby
* &quot;O Sanctissima&quot; sung by Bing Crosby
* &quot;It&#x27;s Spring&quot; (&quot;Vårvindar friska&quot; in Swedish) sung by Ingrid Bergman
* &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; sung by Bing Crosby and choir

Bing Crosby recorded four of the songs for Decca Records and these were issued as singles as well as a 2-disc 78 rpm album titled &quot;Selections from The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;. &quot;Aren&#x27;t You Glad You&#x27;re You&quot; was in the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for nine weeks with a peak position of #8. &quot;In the Land of Beginning Again&quot; and &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; both charted briefly also. Crosby&#x27;s songs were also included in the &quot;Bing&#x27;s Hollywood&quot; series.

==Awards==
At the Academy Awards, it won for Best Sound Recording (Stephen Dunn). It was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Bing Crosby), Best Actress in a Leading Role (Ingrid Bergman), Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, Best Music, Song (for Jimmy Van Heusen (music) and Johnny Burke (lyrics) for &quot;Aren&#x27;t You Glad You&#x27;re You&quot;) and Best Picture.

Bing Crosby&#x27;s Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Father Chuck O&#x27;Malley made him the first actor in history to receive two nominations for portraying the same character in different films. This was following the previous year&#x27;s nomination anomaly, where Barry Fitzgerald received nominations in both supporting and lead for the &quot;same&quot; film (as the same character), the prequel &quot;Going My Way&quot;. While he lost in lead to his co-star Crosby, Fitzgerald won for Best Supporting Actor.

==Adaptations==
* The screenplay was adapted into a novel by George Victor Martin.
* There were two radio adaptations of &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; on &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot; radio program. Both starred Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman. They were broadcast on August 26, 1946, and October 6, 1947.
* A television adaptation on videotape of &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; was shown in 1959, starring Claudette Colbert, Marc Connelly, Glenda Farrell, Nancy Marchand, Barbara Myers, Robert Preston, and Charles Ruggles. It was directed by Tom Donovan.

== Cultural impact ==
&quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; has come to be associated with the Christmas season, probably because of the inclusion of a scene involving a Christmas pageant at the school, a major plot point involving an unlikely (yet prayed for) gift, and the film&#x27;s having been released in December 1945.

In the film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946), in which Henry Travers, a co-star of &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;, plays the guardian angel Clarence Odbody, the title of &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; appears on the marquee of a movie theater in Bedford Falls, New York. In &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972), Michael and Kay see &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; at Radio City Music Hall.

<text>Michelin ( , ), in full (&quot;General Company of the Michelin Enterprises P.L.S.&quot;), is a French multinational tyre manufacturing company based in Clermont-Ferrand in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes &quot;région&quot; of France. It is the second largest tyre manufacturer in the world behind Bridgestone and larger than both Goodyear and Continental. In addition to the Michelin brand, it also owns the Kléber tyres company, Uniroyal-Goodrich Tire Company, SASCAR, Bookatable and Camso brands. Michelin is also notable for its Red and Green travel guides, its roadmaps, the Michelin stars that the Red Guide awards to restaurants for their cooking, and for its company mascot Bibendum, colloquially known as the Michelin Man, who is a humanoid consisting of tyres.

Michelin&#x27;s numerous inventions include the removable tyre, the pneurail (a tyre for rubber-tyred metros) and the radial tyre. Michelin manufactures tyres for Space Shuttles, aircraft, automobiles, heavy equipment, motorcycles, and bicycles. In 2012, the group produced 166 million tyres at 69 facilities located in 18 countries.

==History==

In 1889, two brothers, Édouard Michelin (1859–1940) and André Michelin (1853–1931), ran a farm implement business in Clermont-Ferrand, France. One day a cyclist whose pneumatic tyre needed repair turned up at the factory. The tyre was glued to the rim, and it took over three hours to remove and repair the tyre, which then needed to be left overnight to dry. The next day, Édouard Michelin took the repaired bicycle into the factory yard to test. After only a few hundred metres, the tyre failed. Despite the setback, Édouard was enthusiastic about the pneumatic tyre, and he and his brother worked on creating their own version, one that did not need to be glued to the rim. Michelin was incorporated on 28 May 1889. In 1891 Michelin took out its first patent for a removable pneumatic tyre which was used by Charles Terront to win the world&#x27;s first long-distance cycle race, the 1891 Paris–Brest–Paris.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Michelin operated large rubber plantations in Vietnam. Conditions at these plantations led to the famous labour movement Phú Riềng Đỏ.

In 1934, Michelin introduced a tyre which, if punctured, would run on a special foam lining, a design now known as a run-flat tyre (self-supporting type).

Michelin developed and patented a key innovation in tyre history, the 1946 radial tyre, and successfully exploited this technological innovation to become one of the world&#x27;s leading tyre manufacturers. The radial was initially marketed as the &quot;X&quot; tyre. It was developed with the front-wheel-drive Citroën Traction Avant and Citroën 2CV in mind. Michelin had bought the then-bankrupt Citroën in the 1930s. Because of its superiority in handling and fuel economy, use of this tyre quickly spread throughout Europe and Asia. In the U.S., the outdated bias-ply tyre persisted, with a market share of 87% in 1967.

In 1966, Michelin partnered with Sears to produce radial tyres under the Allstate brand and was selling 1 million units annually by 1970.

In 1968, Michelin opened its first North American sales office, and was able to grow that market for its products rapidly; by 1989 the company had a 10% market share for OEM tyres purchased by American automobile makers.

Also in 1968, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;, an influential American magazine, acknowledged the superiority of the radial construction, setting off a rapid decline in Michelin&#x27;s competitor technology. In the U.S., the radial tyre now has a market share of 100%.

In addition to the private label and replacement tyre market, Michelin scored an early OEM tyre win in North America, when it received the contract for the 1970 Continental Mark III, the first American car with radial tyres fitted as standard.

In 1989, Michelin acquired the recently merged tyre and rubber manufacturing divisions of the American firms B.F. Goodrich Company (founded in 1870) and Uniroyal, Inc. (founded in 1892 as the United States Rubber Company) from Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice. Uniroyal Australia had already been bought by Bridgestone in 1980. This purchase included the Norwood, North Carolina manufacturing plant which supplied tyres to the U.S. Space Shuttle Program.

As of 1 September 2008, Michelin is again the world&#x27;s largest tyre manufacturer after spending two years as number two behind Bridgestone. Michelin produces tyres in France, Serbia, Poland, Spain, Germany, the US, the UK, Canada, Brazil, Thailand, Japan, India, Italy and several other countries. On 15 January 2010, Michelin announced the closing of its Ota, Japan plant, which employs 380 workers and makes the Michelin X-Ice tyre. Production of the X-Ice will be moved to Europe, North America, and elsewhere in Asia. In 2019, Michelin announced that plants in Germany and France are to be closed soon.

Michelin also controls 90% of Taurus Tyre in Hungary, as well as Kormoran, a Polish brand.

In December 2018, Michelin acquired Camso, a manufacturer of off-the-road tyres, tracks, and accessories for power sports, agriculture, material handling and construction markets.

On 22 January 2019, it was announced that Michelin had acquired Indonesian manufacturer Multistrada Arah Sarana, which produces Achilles Radial and Corsa tyres. On 19 June that year, Michelin owns 99.64% of the share capital of Multistrada.

==Motorsport==
===MotoGP===
Michelin participated in MotoGP from 1972 to 2008. They introduced radial construction to MotoGP in 1984, and multi-compound tyres in 1994. They achieved 360 victories in 36 years, and from 1993 to 2006, the world championship had gone to a rider on Michelins.

In 2007, Casey Stoner on Bridgestone tyres won the world championship in dominating fashion, and Valentino Rossi and other top riders complained that Michelins were inferior. Rossi wanted Bridgestones for the 2008 season, but Bridgestone was reluctant to provide them; Dorna threatened to impose a control tyre on the series, after which Bridgestone relented.

In 2008, Michelin committed errors of judgment in allocating adequate tyres for some of the race weekends. Dani Pedrosa&#x27;s team switched to Bridgestones in the midst of the season, a highly unusual move that caused friction between Honda Racing Corporation and their sponsor Repsol YPF. Other riders also expressed concerns and it seemed that Michelin might not have any factory riders for the 2009 season, leading to rumours that Michelin would withdraw from the series altogether. Dorna and the FIM announced that a control tyre would be imposed on MotoGP for the 2009 season and Michelin did not enter a bid, effectively ending its participation in the series at the end of 2008. 

Michelin returned to MotoGP in 2016 as the official tyre supplier after Bridgestone&#x27;s withdrawal from the series at the end of 2015.

===Formula One===

Michelin first competed in the 1977 Formula One season, when Renault started the development of their turbocharged F1 car. Michelin introduced radial tyre technology to Formula One and won the Formula One Drivers&#x27; Championship with Brabham and McLaren, before withdrawing at the end of 1984.

The company returned to Formula One in 2001, supplying the Williams, Jaguar, Benetton (renamed Renault in 2002), Prost and Minardi teams. Toyota joined F1 in 2002 with Michelin tyres, and McLaren also signed up with the company. Michelin Tyres were initially uncompetitive but by the 2005 season were dominant. This was partly because the new regulations stated that tyres must last the whole race distance (and qualifying), and partly because only one top team (Ferrari) was running Bridgestones, and so had to do much of the development work. Michelin in contrast had much more testing and race data provided by the larger number of teams running their tyres.

Following the debacle of the 2005 United States Grand Prix where, because of safety concerns, Michelin would not allow the teams it supplied to race, Michelin&#x27;s share price fell by 2.5% (though it recovered later the same day). On 28 June, Michelin announced that it would offer compensation to all race fans who had bought tickets for the Grand Prix. The company committed to refunding the price of all tickets for the race. Additionally, it announced that it would provide 20,000 complimentary tickets for the 2006 race to spectators who had attended the 2005 event.

Michelin has had a difficult relationship with the sport&#x27;s governing body (the FIA) since around 2003 and this escalated to apparent disdain between the two parties during the 2005 season. The most high-profile disagreement was at the United States Grand Prix and the acrimony afterwards. Michelin criticised the FIA&#x27;s intention to move to a single source (i.e. one brand) tyre from 2008 and threatened to withdraw from the sport. In a public rebuke, FIA President Max Mosley wrote: &quot;There are simple arguments for a single tyre, and if [Michelin boss Édouard Michelin] is not aware of this, he shows an almost comical lack of knowledge of modern Formula One.&quot; Another bone of contention has been the reintroduction of tyre changes during pit-stops from 2006. Michelin criticised the move claiming &quot;this event illustrates F1&#x27;s problems of incoherent decision-making and lack of transparency&quot;. 

In December 2005, and as a result of the difficult relationship with the sport&#x27;s governing body, Michelin announced that it would not extend its involvement in Formula One beyond the 2006 season. Bridgestone was then the sole supplier of tyres to Formula One until the end of the 2010 season, with Pirelli providing tyres for 2011.

The last race won on Michelin tyres in Formula One was the 2006 Japanese Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso benefitted after the Ferrari engine of Michael Schumacher failed during the race. This gave Michelin a second consecutive Constructors&#x27; Championship win, with the 2005 and 2006, after Bridgestone&#x27;s seven-year winning streak, and brought to a total of four the number of titles for Michelin since this championship&#x27;s inception back in the 1958 Formula One season; Michelin&#x27;s other titles were in the 1979, and 1984 seasons.

===Endurance racing===
Michelin is involved in endurance races such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the American Le Mans Series. Involvement in Le Mans began with supplying tyres for the winner of the inaugural 1923 24 Hours of Le Mans as well as nine others of the 33 entrants. In 2009 Michelin supplied tyres for 41 of the 55 cars that entered in Le Mans. In 2016 they provided tyres to the Audi, Porsche and Toyota LMP1 teams, as well as the AF Corse, BMW, Corvette, Ford Ganassi, Porsche and Risi teams in GTE-Pro / GTLM. Beginning in 2019, Michelin will replace Continental as the official tyre of the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. Along with supplying tyres for IMSA&#x27;s top three series, the partnership includes naming rights for the Sports Car Challenge series and the North American Endurance Cup.

Michelin has also supplied tyres in the European Le Mans Series. They have been the exclusive supplier of the LMP3 class since 2015.

===Rallying===
In the World Rally Championship, Michelin has been the supplier of the Audi, Citroën, Ford, Lancia, Mitsubishi, Peugeot, Toyota and Volkswagen factory teams. Michelin Group brand BFGoodrich represented the brand in 2006 and 2007. The company was absent from 2008 to 2010, when Pirelli was signed as the official supplier, after which they returned to the series as an official supplier from 2011 to 2020 until Pirelli won the tender to once again become an official supplier from 2021 onwards.

==Recent developments==
*Pax System
*Tweel
*X One
*Agri
*BAZ Technology. Michelin employs specific tread construction, that uses spiral-wrapped nylon strips. The strips are applied in the tread area above steel belts in order to oppose centrifugal force, in order to avoid tyre distortion at high speeds.
*EverGrip Technology. This is a patented safety technology that allows combining tread groove design. This way, it does not just wear down, but evolves due to high traction tread compound, which makes driving safer on snowy and wet roads.
*Zero Pressure Technology means a reinforced sidewall that is designed to continue supporting the vehicle&#x27;s weight even when air pressure is lost. The technology allows driving at speeds between 50 and 55 mph for some time.

===Active Wheel===
Active Wheel from Michelin includes in-wheel electric motors and a motorised suspension to free up space in the front or rear of the vehicle. This model also eliminates the need for other notorious space hogs like transmissions and exhaust systems. The wheels already have a vehicle ready to receive them, the Heuliez Will from Opel, and are also expected to come standard on the Venturi Volage sometime in 2012. The project was interrupted in 2014.

==Other products==
===Tyre retailer===
Michelin operates tyre retail and distribution in Europe under Euromaster and Blackcircles brands, and in the US with its wholly owned subsidiary TCI Tire Centers. TCI tire centers was folded into NTW, when Michelin partnered with Sumitomo to form the entity. The company also manages its own e-commerce store, michelinman.com.

===Tour guides===

Michelin has long published two guidebook series, the Red Guides for Hotels and Restaurants, and the Green Guides for tourism. It now publishes several additional guides, as well as digital maps and guide products. The city maps in both the Red and the Green guides are of high quality, and are linked to the smaller-scale road maps.

===Maps===
Michelin publishes a variety of road maps, mostly of France but also of other European countries, countries in Africa, Thailand and the United States. They have recently embarked on e-commerce selling Michelin maps and guides directly to the public through, for example, their UK website. The Michelin roadmaps were reproduced in England for the Allied invasion during World War II. In 1940, the Germans also reproduced the 1938 edition of Michelin maps for the invasion.

===Online mapping===

ViaMichelin is a wholly owned subsidiary of Michelin Group, and was started in 2001, to represent Michelin&#x27;s digital mapping services. As of August 2008, ViaMichelin generates 400 million maps and routes per month on its main website.

ViaMichelin provides mapping for internet, mobile and satellite navigation products with street level coverage of Europe, USA, Australia, and parts of Asia and South America.

=== Michelin Challenge Bibendum / Movin&#x27;On (since 2017) ===
The Michelin Challenge Bibendum is a major sustainable mobility event.

===Michelin Truck and Bus===

In 1952, 6 years after Michelin patented its Radial Casing, Michelin adapted the radial technology to truck tyres.

==Management==

From 1999, the company was headed by CEO Édouard Michelin. On 26 May 2006, Édouard drowned while fishing near the island of Sein, off the coast of Brittany. His death brought Michel Rollier, a 2nd cousin of Édouard Michelin, to the head of the company. Rollier was replaced in May 2012 by Jean-Dominique Senard. In 2018, Jean-Dominique Senard announced he would not seek re-election at the shareholders&#x27; meeting in 2019. As a result, the shareholders elected Florent Menegaux to succeed Senard starting in 2019.

The company also has its headquarters in Greenville, South Carolina, United States as Michelin North America. They first manufactured in the city in 1975 before opening up their headquarters a decade later.

* San Gabriel – consisted of the western San Gabriel Valley and foothill communities, including present-day Alhambra and Pasadena. Centered on the Mission San Gabriel

== Law, government, and politics ==
=== Government ===
The Government of Los Angeles County is defined and authorized under the California Constitution, California law and the Charter of the County of Los Angeles. Much of the Government of California is in practice the responsibility of local governments such as the Government of Los Angeles County.

The county&#x27;s voters elect a governing five-member Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. The small size of the board means each supervisor represents over 2million people. The board operates in a legislative, executive, and quasi-judicial capacity. As a legislative authority, it can pass ordinances for the unincorporated areas (ordinances that affect the whole county, like posting of restaurant ratings, must be ratified by the individual city). As an executive body, it can tell the county departments what to do, and how to do it. As a quasi-judicial body, the Board is the final venue of appeal in the local planning process, and holds public hearings on various agenda items.

As of 2020, the Board of Supervisors oversees a $35.5billion annual budget and over 112,000 employees. The county government is managed on a day-to-day basis by a chief executive officer and is organized into many departments, each of which is enormous in comparison to equivalent county-level (and even many state-level) departments anywhere else in the United States. Some of the larger or better-known departments include:

* Los Angeles County Department of Consumer and Business Affairs – offers consumers in the county a variety of services including: consumer and real estate counseling, mediation, and small claims counseling investigates consumer complaints, real estate fraud and identity theft issues. The department also provides small business certifications and helps entrepreneurs navigate the process of opening a business.
* Los Angeles County Superior Court - The primary trial court for Los Angeles County, handling civil, criminal, family, and probate cases.

* Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services – administers foster care
* Los Angeles County Fire Department – provides firefighting and emergency medical services for the unincorporated parts and 58 cities of Los Angeles County, as well as for the city of La Habra in Orange County. A 2021 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; investigation revealed that more than 54 percent of all fires requiring an LAFD response were associated with homelessness. That is equivalent to more than 24 fires every day. Arson-related fires constituted one-third of overall incidents, rising along with homeless-related fire incidents. The city&#x27;s arson clearance rate was 6 percent, meaning that most perpetrators went unpunished.
* Los Angeles County Department of Health Services – operates several county hospitals and a network of primary care clinics.
* Los Angeles County Department of Public Health – administers public health programs including STD programs, smoking cessation, and restaurant inspection. The cities of Long Beach and Pasadena have their own autonomous Public Health departments assuming county functions, and county public health orders are not applicable in those cities.
* Los Angeles County Department of Public Social Services – administers many federal and state welfare programs
* Los Angeles County Department of Public Works – operates countywide flood control system, constructs and maintains roads in unincorporated areas.
* Los Angeles County District Attorney – prosecutes criminal suspects.
* Los Angeles County Office of the Public Defender – defends indigent people accused of criminal offenses.
* Los Angeles County Probation Department
* Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department – provides law enforcement services for the unincorporated parts of Los Angeles County, as well as 42 cities.

The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, despite its name, is a County department. Technically it is a state-mandated county transportation commission that also operates a large bus and rail system in the county.

=== Politics ===

















==== Overview ====

==== Voter registration ====
In the United States House of Representatives, Los Angeles County is split between 17 congressional districts. 
In the California State Senate, Los Angeles County is split between 13 legislative districts.
In the California State Assembly, Los Angeles County is split between 24 legislative districts.

On November 4, 2008, Los Angeles County was almost evenly split over Proposition 8, which amended the California Constitution to ban same-sex marriages. The county voted for the amendment 50.04% with a margin of 2,385 votes.

=== Legal system ===
The Los Angeles County Superior Court is the county&#x27;s court of general jurisdiction, while the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California may hear cases where federal jurisdiction is present. Both are headquartered in a large cluster of government buildings in the city&#x27;s Civic Center.

Historically, the courthouses were county-owned buildings that were maintained at county expense, which created significant friction since the trial court judges, as officials of the state government, had to lobby the county Board of Supervisors for facility renovations and upgrades. In turn, the state judiciary successfully persuaded the state Legislature to authorize the transfer of all courthouses to the state government in 2008 and 2009 (so that judges would have direct control over their own courthouses). Courthouse security is still provided by the county government under a contract with the state.

Unlike the largest city in the United States, New York City, all of the city of Los Angeles and most of its important suburbs are located within a single county. As a result, both the county superior court and the federal district court are respectively the busiest courts of their type in the nation.

Many celebrities have been seen in Los Angeles courts. In 2003, the television show &quot;Extra&quot; (based in nearby Glendale) found itself running so many reports on the legal problems of local celebrities that it spun them off into a separate show, &quot;Celebrity Justice&quot;.

State cases are appealed to the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District, which is also headquartered in the Civic Center, and then to the California Supreme Court, which is headquartered in San Francisco but also hears argument in Los Angeles (again, in the Civic Center). Federal cases are appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which hears them at its branch building in Pasadena. The court of last resort for federal cases is the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C.

==Ecology==
According to the authors of &quot;Wild L.A.&quot;, a book about urban biodiversity, &quot;Los Angeles is the birdiest county in the country with over 500 recorded species.&quot; LA&#x27;s amenable climate supports a large number of introduced, tropical and migratory species. Because of the county&#x27;s wide range of biomes it is possible to see desert bighorn sheep and green sea turtles in the same day, without crossing the county line. The range of habitats in the county is &quot;greater than in many states, with mountains, wetlands, desert, ocean, meadows and chaparral, each with its own endemic species.&quot; There are at least 100 species of trees, and 1000 species of non-native plants, in the urban areas of the county. Charismatic biodiversity indicator species native to the area include three species of amphibian (Baja California chorus frog, black-bellied slender salamander, western toad), 14 species of bird (acorn woodpecker, California quail, canyon wren, cinnamon teal, great blue heron, great horned owl, greater roadrunner, hooded merganser, Northern harrier, red-tailed hawk, red-winged blackbird, spotted towhee, western bluebird, western meadowlark), nine kinds of invertebrates (Behr&#x27;s metalmark, bramble green hairstreak, bumblebees, El Segundo blue butterfly, harvester ants, Lorquin&#x27;s admiral, North American Jerusalem crickets, Sara orangetip, velvet ants), five mammals (bobcat, dusky footed woodrat, gray fox, mountain lion, mule deer), and six reptiles (California kingsnake, coachwhip snake, gopher snake, side-blotched lizard, western pond turtle, western rattlesnake). Any observations of these species within the county are considered ecologically significant indicators of ecosystem health and may be documented using the iNaturalist app.

==Economy==

Los Angeles County is commonly associated with the entertainment and digital media industry; all five major film studios—Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, and Walt Disney Studios—are located within the county. Numerous other major industries also define the economy of Los Angeles County, including international trade supported by the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach, music recording and production, aerospace and defense, fashion, and professional services such as law, medicine, engineering and design services, financial services. High-tech sector employment within Los Angeles County is 368,500 workers, and manufacturing employment within Los Angeles County is 365,000 workers. Despite a business exodus from Downtown Los Angeles since the COVID-19 pandemic, the city&#x27;s urban core is evolving as a cultural center with the world&#x27;s largest showcase of architecture designed by Frank Gehry.

The following major companies have headquarters in Los Angeles County:
== Education ==
The Los Angeles County Office of Education provides a supporting role for school districts in the area. The county office also operates two magnet schools, the International Polytechnic High School and Los Angeles County High School for the Arts. There are a number of private schools in the county, most notably those operated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese. The county&#x27;s public education sector is run by numerous school districts with the Los Angeles Unified School District being the largest one running public schools primarily within the city of Los Angeles and its immediately neighboring cities.

=== Rail ===
Los Angeles is a major freight-railroad transportation center, largely due to the large volumes of freight moving in and out of the county&#x27;s sea port facilities. The ports are connected to the downtown rail yards and to the main lines of Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe headed east via a grade-separated, freight rail corridor known as the Alameda Corridor.

Passenger rail service is provided in the county by Amtrak, Los Angeles Metro Rail and Metrolink.

Amtrak has the following intercity Amtrak service at Union Station in the city of Los Angeles:

Light rail, subway (heavy rail), and long-distance bus service are all provided by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro). Other smaller regional transit agencies that provide public transit to specific regions of Los Angeles County include LADOT, Long Beach Transit, Montebello Bus Lines, Norwalk Transit, Santa Monica&#x27;s Big Blue Bus serving the western LA region, Santa Clarita Transit, Torrance Transit, Glendale Beeline, Foothill Transit serving the San Gabriel Valley region, and the Antelope Valley Transit Authority serving the Lancaster and Palmdale area in the Antelope Valley region.

=== Sea ===
The county&#x27;s two main seaports are the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach. Together they handle over a quarter of all container traffic entering the United States, making the complex the largest and most important port in the country, and the third-largest port in the world by shipping volume.

The Port of Los Angeles is the largest cruise ship center on the West Coast, handling more than 1million passengers annually.

The Port of Long Beach is home to the Sea Launch program, which uses a floating launch platform to insert payloads into orbits that would be difficult to attain from existing land-based launch sites.

Catalina Express ferries link the Catalina Island city of Avalon to the mainland at San Pedro and Long Beach, as well as Dana Point in Orange County.

==Water==

Water is provided by at least 200 independent water districts or agencies. Statewide droughts in California have placed a strain on the county&#x27;s water security. Statewide droughts in California have further strained Los Angeles County&#x27;s water security.

<text>A cluster munition is a form of air-dropped or ground-launched explosive weapon that releases or ejects smaller submunitions. Commonly, this is a cluster bomb that ejects explosive bomblets that are designed to kill personnel and destroy vehicles. Other cluster munitions are designed to destroy runways or electric power transmission lines.

Because cluster bombs release many small bomblets over a wide area, they pose risks to civilians both during attacks and afterwards. Unexploded bomblets can kill or maim civilians and unintended targets long after a conflict has ended, and are costly to locate and remove. This failure rate ranges from 2 percent to over 40 percent.

Cluster munitions are prohibited for those nations that ratified the Convention on Cluster Munitions, adopted in Dublin, Ireland, in May 2008. The Convention entered into force and became binding international law upon ratifying states on 1 August 2010, six months after being ratified by 30 states. As of 10 February 2022, a total of 123 states have joined the Convention, as 110 states parties and 13 signatories.

==Development==
The first significantly operationally used cluster bomb was the German SD-2 or &quot;Sprengbombe Dickwandig 2 kg&quot;, commonly referred to as the Butterfly Bomb. It was used in World War II to attack both civilian and military targets, including on Tokyo and Kyushu. The technology was developed independently by the United States, Russia and Italy (see Thermos bomb). The US used the M41 fragmentation bomb wired together in clusters of 6 or 25 with highly sensitive or proximity fuzes.

From the 1970s to the 1990s cluster bombs became standard air-dropped munitions for many nations, in a wide variety of types. They have been produced by 34 countries and used in at least 23.

Artillery shells that employ similar principles have existed for decades. They are typically referred to as ICM (Improved Conventional Munitions) shells. The US military slang terms for them are &quot;firecracker&quot; or &quot;popcorn&quot; shells, for the many small explosions they cause in the target area.

==Types==
A basic cluster bomb consists of a hollow shell and then two to more than 2,000 submunitions or bomblets contained within it. Some types are dispensers that are designed to be retained by the aircraft after releasing their munitions. The submunitions themselves may be fitted with small parachute retarders or streamers to slow their descent (allowing the aircraft to escape the blast area in low-altitude attacks).

Modern cluster bombs and submunition dispensers can be multiple-purpose weapons containing a combination of anti-armor, anti-personnel, and anti-materiel munitions. The submunitions themselves may also be multi-purpose, such as combining a shaped charge, to attack armour, with a fragmenting case, to attack infantry, material, and light vehicles. They may also have an incendiary function.

Since the 1990s submunition-based weapons have been designed that deploy smart submunitions, using thermal and visual sensors to locate and attack particular targets, usually armored vehicles. Weapons of this type include the US CBU-97 sensor-fuzed weapon, first used in combat during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Some munitions specifically intended for anti-tank use can be set to self-destruct if they reach the ground without locating a target, theoretically reducing the risk of unintended civilian deaths and injuries. Although smart submunition weapons are much more expensive than standard cluster bombs, fewer smart submunitions are required to defeat dispersed and mobile targets, partly offsetting their cost. Because they are designed to prevent indiscriminate area effects and unexploded ordnance risks, some smart munitions are excluded from coverage by the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

===Incendiary===
Incendiary cluster bombs are intended to start fires, just like conventional incendiary bombs (firebombs). They contain submunitions of white phosphorus or napalm, and can be combined anti-personnel and anti-tank submunitions to hamper firefighting efforts. In urban areas they have been preceded by the use of conventional explosive bombs to fracture the roofs and walls of buildings to expose their flammable contents. One of the earliest examples is the so-called Molotov bread basket used by the Soviet Union in the Winter War of 1939–40. Incendiary clusters were extensively used by both sides in the strategic bombings of World War II. They caused firestorms and conflagrations in the bombing of Dresden in World War II and the firebombing of Tokyo. Some modern bomb submunitions deliver a highly combustible thermobaric aerosol that results in a high pressure explosion when ignited.

===Anti-personnel===
Anti-personnel cluster bombs use explosive fragmentation to kill troops and destroy soft (unarmored) targets. Along with incendiary cluster bombs, these were among the first types of cluster bombs produced by Nazi Germany during World War II. They were used during the Blitz with delay and booby-trap fusing to hamper firefighting and other damage-control efforts in the target areas. They were also used with a contact fuze when attacking entrenchments. These weapons were widely used during the Vietnam War when many thousands of tons of submunitions were dropped on Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.

===Anti-tank===
Most anti-armor munitions contain shaped charge warheads to pierce the armor of tanks and armored fighting vehicles. In some cases, guidance is used to increase the likelihood of successfully hitting a vehicle. Modern guided submunitions, such as those found in the US CBU-97, can use either a shaped charge or an explosively formed penetrator. Unguided shaped-charge submunitions are designed to be effective against entrenchments that incorporate overhead cover. To simplify supply and increase battlefield effectiveness by allowing a single type of round to be used against nearly any target, submunitions that incorporate both fragmentation and shaped-charge effects are produced.

===Anti-electrical===
An anti-electrical weapon, the CBU-94/B, was first used by the US in the Kosovo War in 1999. These consist of a TMD (Tactical Munitions Dispenser) filled with 202 submunitions. Each submunition contains a small explosive charge that disperses 147 reels of fine conductive fiber of either carbon or aluminum-coated glass. Their purpose is to disrupt and damage electric power transmission systems by producing short circuits in high-voltage power lines and electrical substations. On the initial attack, these knocked out 70% of the electrical power supply in Serbia.

==History of use==

=== Vietnam War ===

During the Vietnam War, the US used cluster bombs in air strikes against targets in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

Of the 260 million cluster bomblets that rained down on Laos between 1964 and 1973, particularly on Xieng Khouang province, 80 million failed to explode. As of 2009 about 7,000 people have been injured or killed by explosives left from the Vietnam War era in Vietnam&#x27;s Quảng Trị province alone.

===South Lebanon conflict, 1978===
During the South Lebanon conflict in 1978, the IDF used cluster bombs provided by the United States. According to US President Jimmy Carter, this use of the cluster bombs violated the legal agreement between Israel and the US because the weapons had been provided for defensive purposes against an attack on Israel. Israel also transferred American weapons to Saad Haddad&#x27;s Lebanese militia, a violation of American law. Carter&#x27;s administration prepared to notify Congress that American weapons were being used illegally, which would have resulted in military aid to Israel being cut off. The American consul in Jerusalem informed the Israeli government of their plans and, according to Carter, Prime Minister Begin said that the operation was over.

=== Western Sahara war, 1975–1991 ===
During the 16-year-long conflict on the territory of Western Sahara, the Royal Moroccan Army (RMA) dropped cluster bombs.

The RMA used both artillery-fired and air-dropped cluster munitions. BLU-63, M42 and MK118 submunitions were used at multiple locations in Bir Lahlou, Tifarity, Mehaires, Mijek and Awganit.

More than 300 cluster strike areas have been recorded in the MINURSO Mine Action Coordination Center database.

=== Soviet–Afghan War, 1979–1989 ===
During the Soviet-Afghan War, the Soviets dealt harshly with Mujaheddin rebels and those who supported them, including leveling entire villages to deny safe havens to their enemy and the usage of cluster bombs.

===Falklands War===
Sea Harriers of the Royal Navy dropped BL755 cluster bombs on Argentinian positions during the Falklands War of 1982.

===Grenada, 1983===
The United States dropped 21 Rockeye cluster bombs during its invasion of Grenada.

=== Nagorno Karabakh War, 1992–1994, 2016, 2020 ===
The armed conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in Nagorno Karabakh in 1992–1994 led to the use of cluster munitions against military and civilian targets in the region. As of 2010, remain off-limits due to contamination with unexploded cluster ordnance. HALO Trust has made major contributions to the cleanup effort.

During renewed hostilities in April 2016, HALO Trust reported the use of cluster bombs by Azerbaijan, having found cluster munitions in the villages of Nerkin Horatagh and Kiçik Qarabəy. Azerbaijan reported that the Armenian forces had used cluster munition against Azerbaijani civilians in the given period.

According to the Cluster Munition Monitor report in 2010, neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan not acceded to become a member of the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

Further use of cluster munition was reported during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war. The Armenian-populated city of Stepanakert came under bombardment throughout the war, beginning on the first day. Human Rights Watch reported that residential neighborhoods in Stepanakert which lacked any identifiable military targets were hit by the Azerbaijani Army with cluster munitions. Human Rights Watch also identified Azerbaijani usage of cluster munitions in Hadrut. Human Rights Watch also reported the use of cluster munitions by the Armenian forces during the months-long bombardment of Tartar, missile attacks on Barda and on Goranboy. Amnesty International also confirmed that the Armenian forces had used cluster munitions in Barda, which resulted in the deaths of 25 Azerbaijani civilians, according to Azerbaijan.

=== First Chechen War, 1995 ===
* Used by Russia, see also 1995 Shali cluster bomb attack

=== Yugoslavia, 1999 ===

* Used by the US, the UK and Netherlands.
About 2,000 cluster bombs containing 380,000 sub-munitions were dropped on Yugoslavia during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, in 1999, of which the Royal Air Force dropped 531 RBL755 cluster bombs. Both the Americans and the British utilised cluster bombs.

On 7 May 1999, between the time of 11:30 and 11:40, a NATO attack was carried out with two containers of cluster bombs and fell in the central part of the city:
* The Pathology building next to the Medical Center of Nis in the south of the city,
* Next to the building of &quot;Banovina&quot; including the main market, bus station next to the Niš Fortress and &quot;12th February&quot; Health Centre
* Parking of &quot;Niš Express&quot; near river Nišava River.

Reports claimed that 15 civilians were killed, 8 civilians were seriously injured, 11 civilians had sustained minor injuries, 120 housing units were damaged and 47 were destroyed and that 15 cars were damaged.

Overall during the operation, at least 23 Serb civilians were killed by cluster munitions. At least six Serbs, including three children were killed by bomblets after the operation ended, and up to in six areas remain &quot;cluster contaminated&quot;, according to Serbian government, including on Mt. Kopaonik near the slopes of the ski resort. The UK contributed £86,000 to the Serbian Mine Action Centre.

=== Afghanistan, 2001–2002 ===
* The United States used cluster munitions during the initial stages of Operation Enduring Freedom.

=== Iraq, 1991, 2003–2006 ===
* Used by the United States and the United Kingdom

1991: During the Gulf War, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom dropped 61,000 cluster bombs, containing 20 million submunitions, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). The US accounted for 57,000 of these droppings. The US Department of Defense estimated that 1.2 to 1.5 million submunitions did not explode. According to human rights organizations, unexploded submunitions have caused over 4,000 civilian casualties, including 1,600 deaths, in Iraq and Kuwait.

2003–2006: United States and allies attacked Iraq with 13,000 cluster munitions, containing two million submunitions during Operation Iraqi Freedom, according to the HRW. The majority were DPICMs, or Dual-purpose improved conventional munitions. At multiple times, coalition forces used cluster munitions in residential areas, and the country remains among the most contaminated to this day, bomblets posing a threat to both US military personnel in the area, and local civilians.

When these weapons were fired on Baghdad on 7 April 2003 many of the bomblets failed to explode on impact. Afterward, some of them exploded when touched by civilians. &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that &quot;the Pentagon presented a misleading picture during the war of the extent to which cluster weapons were being used and of the civilian casualties they were causing.&quot; On 26 April, General Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the US had caused only one civilian casualty.

=== Lebanon, 1978, 1982 and 2006 ===
* Extensively used by Israel during the 1978 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the 1982–2000 occupation of Lebanon and also by Hezbollah in the 2006 Lebanon War.

During the Israeli-Lebanese conflict in 1982, Israel used cluster munitions, many of them American-made, on targets in southern Lebanon. Israel also used cluster bombs in the 2006 Lebanon War.

Two types of cluster munitions were transferred to Israel from the US The first was the CBU-58 which uses the BLU-63 bomblet. This cluster bomb is no longer in production. The second was the MK-20 Rockeye, produced by Honeywell Incorporated in Minneapolis. The CBU-58 was used by Israel in Lebanon in both 1978 and 1982. The Israeli Defense company Israel Military Industries also manufactures the more up-to-date M-85 cluster bomb.

Hezbollah fired Chinese-manufactured cluster munitions against Israeli civilian targets, using 122 mm rocket launchers during the 2006 war, hitting Kiryat Motzkin, Nahariya, Karmiel, Maghar, and Safsufa. A total of 113 rockets and 4,407 submunitions were fired into Israel during the war.

According to the United Nations Mine Action Service, Israel dropped up to four million submunitions on Lebanese soil, of which one million remain unexploded. According to a report prepared by Lionel Beehner for the Council on Foreign Relations, the United States restocked Israel&#x27;s arsenal of cluster bombs, triggering a State Department investigation to determine whether Israel had violated secret agreements it had signed with the United States on their use.

As Haaretz reported in November 2006, the Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Dan Halutz wanted to launch an investigation into the use of cluster bombs during the Lebanon war. Halutz claimed that some cluster bombs had been fired against his direct order, which stated that cluster bombs should be used with extreme caution and not be fired into populated areas. The IDF apparently disobeyed this order.

Human Rights Watch said there was evidence that Israel had used cluster bombs very close to civilian areas and described them as &quot;unacceptably inaccurate and unreliable weapons when used around civilians&quot; and that &quot;they should never be used in populated areas&quot;. Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of using cluster munitions in an attack on Bilda, a Lebanese village, on 19 July which killed 1 civilian and injured 12, including 7 children. The Israeli &quot;army defended ... the use of cluster munitions in its offensive with Lebanon, saying that using such munitions was &#x27;legal under international law&#x27; and the army employed them &#x27;in accordance with international standards. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mark Regev added, &quot;[I]f NATO countries stock these weapons and have used them in recent conflicts – in FR Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq – the world has no reason to point a finger at Israel.&quot;

=== Georgia, 2008 ===
* Georgia and Russia both were accused of using cluster munitions during the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. Georgia admitted use; Russia denied it.

Georgia admitted using cluster bombs during the war, according to Human Rights Watch but stressed they were only used against military targets. The Georgian army used LAR-160 multiple rocket launchers to fire MK4 LAR 160 type rockets (with M-85 bomblets) with a range of 45 kilometers the Georgian Minister of Defense (MoD) said.

Human Rights Watch accused the Russian Air Force of using RBK-250 cluster bombs during the conflict. A high-ranking Russian military official denied use of cluster bombs. The Dutch government, after investigating the death of a Dutch citizen, claimed that a cluster munition was propelled by an 9K720 Iskander tactical missile (used by Russia at the time of conflict, and not used by Georgia).

==== Sri Lanka, 2008/2009 ====
In 2009, the US Department of State prepared a report on incidents in Sri Lanka between January and May 2009 that could constitute violations of international humanitarian law or crimes against humanity. This report documented the use of cluster munitions by Sri Lanka’s government forces. Photos and eyewitness accounts described the use of such weapons in several attacks on civilian areas, including an incident on March 7, 2009, in Valayanmadam, where two cluster bombs exploded, causing significant civilian casualties and injuries. The reports suggest that cluster munitions were used in areas declared as safe zones for civilians. 

According to Gordon Weiss, who was the spokesperson for the UN in Colombo, the &quot;largest remaining functioning hospital&quot; in the Vanni region of Sri Lanka was bombed. The Sri Lankan military has been accused of bombing the hospital with cluster munitions, but cluster bombs were not used in the bombing of the hospital. The government has denied using cluster munitions, but in 2012 unexploded cluster bombs were found, according to Allan Poston, who was the technical advisor for the UN Development Program’s mine action group in Sri Lanka. An article published by The Guardian in 2016 provided photographic evidence and testimonies from former de-miners and civilians pointing to the use of Russian-made cluster bombs in areas that the government had declared as &quot;no-fire zones.&quot;

=== Libya, 2011 ===
It was reported in April 2011 that Colonel Gaddafi&#x27;s forces had used cluster bombs in the conflict between government forces and rebel forces trying to overthrow Gaddafi&#x27;s government, during the battle of Misrata These reports were denied by the government, and the Secretary of State of the US, Hillary Clinton said she was &quot;not aware&quot; of the specific use of cluster or other indiscriminate weapons in Misurata even though a &quot;New York Times&quot; investigation refuted those claims.

===Syria, 2012===
During the Syrian uprising, a few videos of cluster bombs first appeared in 2011, but escalated in frequency near the end of 2012. As Human Rights Watch reported on 13 October 2012, &quot;Eliot Higgins, who blogs on military hardware and tactics used in Syria under the pseudonym &#x27;Brown Moses&#x27;, compiled a list of the videos showing cluster munition remnants in Syria&#x27;s various governorates.&quot; The type of bombs have been reported to be RBK-250 cluster bombs with AO-1 SCH bomblets (of Soviet design). Designed by the Soviet Union for use on tank and troop formations, PTAB-2.5M bomblets were used on civilian targets in Mare&#x27; in December 2012 by the Syrian government. According to the seventh annual Cluster Munition Report, there is ″compelling evidence″ that Russia has used cluster munitions during their involvement in Syria.

=== South Sudan, 2013 ===
Cluster bombs remnants were discovered by a UN de-mining team in February 2014 on a section of road near the Jonglei state capital, Bor. The strategic town was the scene of heavy fighting, changing hands several times during the South Sudanese Civil War, which erupted in the capital Juba on 15 December 2013 before spreading to other parts of the country. According to UNMAS, the site was contaminated with the remnants of up to eight cluster bombs and an unknown quantity of bomblets.

=== Ukraine, 2014 ===
Human Rights Watch reported that &quot;Ukrainian government forces used cluster munitions in populated areas in Donetsk city in early October 2014.&quot; Also &quot;circumstances indicate that anti-government forces might also have been responsible for the use of cluster munitions&quot;.

===Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, 2015–2022===

British-supplied and US-supplied cluster bombs have been used by Saudi Arabian-led military coalition against Houthi militias in Yemen, according to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.

Saudi Arabia is not signatory to the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

===Ethiopia, 2021===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; journalist Christiaan Triebert revealed that the Ethiopian Air Force bombings of Samre during the Tigray War are evidenced by multiple photos of the tails of Soviet-era cluster bombs, likely RBK-250.

Ethiopia is not signatory to the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

===Russian invasion of Ukraine, 2022===
Human Rights Watch reported the use of cluster munitions by the Russian Armed Forces during the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. HRMMU reported 16 credible allegations that Russian armed forces used cluster munitions in
populated areas, resulting in civilian casualties and other damage.

On 24 February 2022, a Russian 9M79-series Tochka ballistic missile with a 9N123 cluster munition warhead containing 50 9N24 fragmentation submunitions impacted outside a hospital in Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. The attack killed four civilians and wounded ten. Further use of cluster munitions, such as the Uragan 9M27K and BM-30 Smerch 9M55K cluster rockets, is being investigated by Bellingcat through a public appeal for evidence on Twitter. According to HRW and Amnesty International, Russian troops used cluster munition during an attack on the city of Okhtyrka on the morning of 25 February 2022. A 220 mm Uragan rocket dropped cluster munitions on a kindergarten in the town. As a result of that, people were killed, including a child. The same day, non-precision guided missiles bearing cluster munitions were deployed against Kharkiv, killing at least nine civilians and injuring 37.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights announced on 30 March 2022 that they had credible reports indicating that Russian armed forces had used cluster munitions in populated areas of Ukraine at least 24 times since the start of the conflict on 24 February.

In early March 2022, The New York Times reported the first use of a cluster munition by Ukrainian troops during the invasion near Husarivka farm. It landed close to the Russian army&#x27;s headquarters. According to the report, nobody died in that strike.

On 14 March 2022, an attack with a Tochka-U missile equipped with cluster sub-munitions was reported in the city of Donetsk. HRMMU confirmed at least 15 civilian deaths, and 36 injured in this incident, and at the time of its report was working to corroborate other alleged casualties and whether they were caused by cluster sub-munitions.

On 7 December 2022, it was revealed that Ukraine was seeking access to US stockpiles of cluster munitions, due to a shortage of ammunition for HIMARS type and 155 mm artillery systems. The US has stockpiled its cluster munitions and had been considering the Ukrainian request. Ukraine claimed it would give them an edge over Russian artillery, as well as preventing depletion of other US and Western stocks.

On 6 July 2023, US president Joe Biden approved the provision of DPICM cluster munitions to Ukraine to help Ukrainian forces with the ongoing counteroffensive to liberate Russian-occupied southeastern Ukraine, bypassing US law prohibiting the transfer of cluster munitions with a failure rate greater than one percent. The weapon system could be used in both HIMARS and 155 mm shell projectiles. Defense Department official Laura Cooper said that the munitions &quot;would be useful, especially against dug-in Russian positions on the battlefield.&quot; According to the Pentagon, Ukraine will receive an &quot;improved&quot; version of cluster munitions with a failure rate of about 2 percent, while the Russian cluster bombs fail at 40 percent or more. However, according to a report prepared for Congress, experts in cleanup operations &quot;have frequently reported failure rates of 10% to 30%.&quot; The failure rate of cluster munitions used by Ukraine is reportedly as high as 20 percent. Paul Hannon, of the Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC), said the Biden administration&#x27;s decision will &quot;contribute to the terrible casualties being suffered by Ukrainian civilians both immediately and for years to come&quot;.

On 10 July, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen warned Ukraine of using cluster munitions on Twitter writing: &quot;It would be the greatest danger for Ukrainians for many years or up to a hundred years if cluster bombs are used in Russian-occupied areas in the territory of Ukraine,&quot; Sen further cited his country&#x27;s &quot;painful experience&quot; from the Vietnam War that has killed or maimed tens of thousands of Cambodians.

On the same day, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) released a study citing the use of cluster munitions from the Vietnam War. United States Army studies from that war showed that it takes approximately 13.6 high explosive shells for each enemy soldier killed. A shell firing DPICMs relied on average only 1.7 shells to kill an enemy soldier. RUSI used an example of a trench, a direct hit by a high explosive round will spread shrapnel &quot;within line of sight of the point of detonation&quot;. This also reduces the wear and tear on the barrels of 155 mm artillery weapons systems. 

On 16 July 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that Russia had &quot;sufficient stockpiles&quot; of its own cluster munitions and threatened to take &quot;reciprocal action&quot; if Ukraine used US-supplied cluster munitions against Russian forces in Ukraine.

On 20 July 2023, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Ukrainian forces had begun to use US-supplied cluster munitions against Russian forces in the south-east of the country, according to Ukrainian officials.

==Threat to civilians==

While all weapons are dangerous, cluster bombs pose a particular threat to civilians for two reasons: they have a wide area of effect, and they consistently leave behind a large number of unexploded bomblets. The unexploded bomblets can remain dangerous for decades after the end of a conflict. For example, while the United States cluster bombing of Laos stopped in 1973, cluster bombs and other unexploded munitions continued to cause over 100 casualties per year to Laotian civilians .

Cluster munitions are opposed by many individuals and hundreds of groups, such as the Red Cross, the Cluster Munition Coalition and the United Nations, because of the high number of civilians that have fallen victim to the weapon. Since February 2005, Handicap International called for cluster munitions to be prohibited and collected hundreds of thousands of signatures to support its call. 98% of 13,306 recorded cluster munitions casualties that are registered with Handicap International are civilians, while 27% are children.

The area affected by a single cluster munition, known as its footprint, can be very large; a single unguided M26 MLRS rocket can effectively cover an area of . In US and most allied services, the M26 has been replaced by the M30 guided missile fired from the MLRS. The M30 has greater range and accuracy but a smaller area of coverage.

Because of the weapon&#x27;s broad area of effect, they have often been documented as striking both civilian and military objects in the target area. This characteristic of the weapon is particularly problematic for civilians when cluster munitions are used in or near populated areas, as documented in a research report by Human Rights Watch. In some cases, like the Zagreb rocket attack, civilians were deliberately targeted by such weapons.

===Unexploded ordnance===
The other serious problem, also common to explosive weapons is unexploded ordnance (UXO) of cluster bomblets left behind after a strike. These bomblets may be duds or in some cases the weapons are designed to detonate at a later stage. In both cases, the surviving bomblets are live and can explode when handled, making them a serious threat to civilians and military personnel entering the area. In effect, the UXOs can function like land mines.

Even though cluster bombs are designed to explode prior to or on impact, there are always some individual submunitions that do not explode on impact. As of 2000, the US-made MLRS with M26 warhead and M77 submunitions which were supposed to have a 5% dud rate, but studies have shown that some have a much higher rate. The rate in acceptance tests prior to the Gulf War for this type ranged from 2% to a high of 23% for rockets cooled to before testing. The M483A1 DPICM artillery-delivered cluster bombs have a reported dud rate of 14%. In July 2023, the failure rate of Russian cluster bombs during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine was reported to be at 40 percent or more.

Given that each cluster bomb can contain hundreds of bomblets and be fired in volleys, even a small failure rate can lead each strike to leave behind hundreds or thousands of UXOs scattered randomly across the strike area. For example, after the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, UN experts estimated that as many as one million unexploded bomblets may contaminate the hundreds of cluster munition strike sites in Lebanon.

In addition, some cluster bomblets, such as the BLU-97/B used in the CBU-87, are brightly colored to increase their visibility and warn off civilians. However, the yellow color, coupled with their small and nonthreatening appearance, is attractive to young children who wrongly believe them to be toys. This problem was exacerbated in the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021), when US forces dropped humanitarian rations from airplanes with similar yellow-colored packaging as the BLU-97/B, yellow being the NATO standard colour for high explosive filler in air weapons. The rations packaging was later changed first to blue and then to clear in the hope of avoiding such hazardous confusion.

As of 1993, the US military was developing new cluster bombs that it claimed could have a much lower (less than 1%) dud rate. Sensor-fused weapons that contain a limited number of submunitions that are capable of autonomously engaging armored targets may provide a viable, if costly, alternative to cluster munitions that will allow multiple target engagement with one shell or bomb while avoiding the civilian deaths and injuries consistently documented from the use of cluster munitions.

In the 1980s the Spanish firm Esperanza y Cia developed a 120 mm caliber mortar bomb which contained 21 anti-armor submunitions. What made the 120 mm &quot;Espin&quot; unique was the electrical impact fusing system which totally eliminated dangerous duds. The system operated on a capacitor in each submunition which was charged by a wind generator in the nose of the projectile after being fired. If for whatever reason the electrical fuse fails to function on impact, approximately 5 minutes later the capacitor bleeds out, therefore neutralizing the submunition&#x27;s electronic fuse system.

====Civilian deaths====
* In Vietnam, people are still being killed as a result of cluster bombs and other objects left by the US and Vietnamese military forces. Hundreds of people are killed or injured annually by unexploded ordnance.
* Some 270 million cluster submunitions were dropped on Laos in the 1960s and 1970s; approximately one third of these submunitions failed to explode and continue to pose a threat today.
* Within the first year after the end of the Kosovo War, more than 100 civilians died from unexploded bombs and mines. During the war, NATO planes dropped nearly 1,400 cluster bombs in Kosovo. Cluster bombs make up to 40% of mines and unexploded bombs in Kosovo.
* Israel used cluster bombs in Lebanon in 1978 and in the 1980s. Those weapons used more than two decades ago by Israel continue to affect Lebanon. During the 2006 war in Lebanon, Israel fired large numbers of cluster bombs in Lebanon, containing an estimated more than 4 million cluster submunitions. In the first month following the ceasefire, unexploded cluster munitions killed or injured an average of 3–4 people per day.

====Locations====
Countries and disputed territories (listed in italic) that have been affected by cluster munitions as of August 2023 include:
* Afghanistan

As of August 2019, it is unclear, whether Colombia and Georgia are contaminated. Albania, the Republic of the Congo, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Mozambique, Norway, Zambia, Uganda, and Thailand completed clearance of areas contaminated by cluster munition remnants in previous years.

==International legislation==
Cluster bombs fall under the general rules of international humanitarian law, but were not specifically covered by any currently binding international legal instrument until the signature of the Convention on Cluster Munitions in December 2008. This international treaty stemmed from an initiative by Stoltenberg&#x27;s Second Cabinet known as the Oslo Process which was launched in February 2007 to prohibit cluster munitions. More than 100 countries agreed to the text of the resulting Convention on Cluster Munitions in May 2008 which sets out a comprehensive ban on these weapons. This treaty was signed by 94 states in Oslo on 3–4 December 2008. The Oslo Process was launched largely in response to the failure of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) where five years of discussions failed to find an adequate response to these weapons. The Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC) is campaigning for the widespread accession to and ratification of the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

A number of sections of the Protocol on explosive remnants of war (Protocol V to the 1980 Convention), 28 November 2003 occasionally address some of the problems associated with the use of cluster munitions, in particular Article 9, which mandates States Parties to &quot;take generic preventive measures aimed at minimising the occurrence of explosive remnants of war&quot;. In June 2006, Belgium was the first country to issue a ban on the use (carrying), transportation, export, stockpiling, trade and production of cluster munitions, and Austria followed suit on 7 December 2007.

There has been legislative activity on cluster munitions in several countries, including Austria, Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States. In some of these countries, ongoing discussions concerning draft legislation banning cluster munitions, along the lines of the legislation adopted in Belgium and Austria will now turn to ratification of the global ban treaty. Norway and Ireland have national legislation prohibiting cluster munitions and were able to deposit their instruments of ratification to the Convention on Cluster Munitions immediately after signing it in Oslo on 3 December 2008.

===International treaties===
Other weapons, such as land mines, have been banned in many countries under specific legal instruments for several years, notably the Ottawa Treaty to ban land mines, and some of the Protocols in the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons that also help clearing the lands contaminated by left munitions after the end of conflicts and provides international assistance to the affected populations. However, until the adoption of the Convention on Cluster Munitions in Dublin in May 2008 cluster bombs were not banned by any international treaty and were considered legitimate weapons by some governments.

To increase pressure for governments to come to an international treaty on 13 November 2003, the Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC) was established with the goal of addressing the impact of cluster munitions on civilians.

International governmental deliberations in the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons turned on the broader problem of explosive remnants of war, a problem to which cluster munitions have contributed in a significant way. There were consistent calls from the Cluster Munition Coalition, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and a number of UN agencies, joined by approximately 30 governments, for international governmental negotiations to develop specific measures that would address the humanitarian problems cluster munitions pose. This did not prove possible in the conventional multilateral forum. After a reversal in the US position, in 2007 deliberations did begin on cluster munitions within the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. There was a concerted effort led by the US to develop a new protocol to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, but this proposal was rejected by over 50 states, together with civil society, ICRC and UN agencies. The discussions ended with no result in November 2011, leaving the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions as the single international standard on the weapons.

In February 2006, Belgium announced its decision to ban the weapon by law. Then Norway announced a national moratorium in June and Austria announced its decision in July to work for an international instrument on the weapon. The international controversy over the use and impact of cluster munitions during the war between Lebanon and Israel in July and August 2006 added weight to the global campaign for a ban treaty.

A new flexible multilateral process similar to the process that led to the ban on anti-personnel land mines in 1997 (the Ottawa Treaty) began with an announcement in November 2006 in Geneva as well at the same time by the Government of Norway that it would convene an international meeting in early 2007 in Oslo to work towards a new treaty prohibiting cluster munitions. Forty-nine governments attended the meeting in Oslo 22–23 February 2007 in order to reaffirm their commitment to a new international ban on the weapon.

A follow-up meeting in this process was held in Lima in May where around 70 states discussed the outline of a new treaty, Hungary became the latest country to announce a moratorium and Peru launched an initiative to make Latin America a cluster munition free zone.

In addition, the ICRC held an experts meeting on cluster munitions in April 2007 which helped clarify technical, legal, military and humanitarian aspects of the weapon with a view to developing an international response.

Further meetings took place in Vienna on 4–7 December 2007, and in Wellington on 18–22 February 2008 where a declaration in favor of negotiations on a draft convention was adopted by more than 80 countries. In May 2008 after around 120 countries had subscribed to the Wellington Declaration and participated in the Dublin Diplomatic Conference from 19 to 30 May 2008. At the end of this conference, 107 countries agreed to adopt the Convention on Cluster Munitions, that bans cluster munitions and was opened for signature in Oslo on 3–4 December 2008 where it was signed by 94 countries.
In July 2008, United States Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates implemented a policy to eliminate by 2018 all cluster bombs that do not meet new safety standards.

In November 2008, ahead of the signing Conference in Oslo, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on all European Union governments to sign and ratify the Convention.

On 16 February 2010 Burkina Faso became the 30th state to deposit its instrument of ratification for the Convention on Cluster Munitions. This means that the number of States required for the Convention to enter into force had been reached. The treaty&#x27;s obligations became legally binding on the 30 ratifying States on 1 August 2010 and subsequently for other ratifying States.

===Convention on Cluster Munitions===
Taking effect on 1 August 2010, the Convention on Cluster Munitions bans the stockpiling, use and transfer of virtually all existing cluster bombs and provides for the clearing up of unexploded munitions. It had been signed by 108 countries, of which 38 had ratified it by the affected date, but many of the world&#x27;s major military powers including the United States, Russia, India, Brazil and China are not signatories to the treaty.

The Convention on Cluster Munitions entered into force on 1 August 2010, six months after it was ratified by 30 states. As of 26 September 2018, a total of 120 states had joined the Convention, as 104 States parties and 16 signatories.

For an updated list of countries, see Convention on Cluster Munitions#State parties

===United States policy===
According to the US State Department, the US suspended operational use of cluster munitions in 2003, however, Amnesty International published a report that the US used them in Yemen during the 2009 al-Majalah camp attack.

US arguments favoring the use of cluster munitions are that their use reduces the number of aircraft and artillery systems needed to support military operations and if they were eliminated, significantly more money would have to be spent on new weapons, ammunition, and logistical resources. Also, militaries would need to increase their use of massed artillery and rocket barrages to get the same coverage, which would destroy or damage more key infrastructures.

The US was initially against any CCW limitation negotiations, but dropped its opposition in June 2007. Cluster munitions have been determined as needed for ensuring the country&#x27;s national security interests, but measures were taken to address humanitarian concerns of their use, as well as pursuing their original suggested alternative to a total ban of pursuing technological fixes to make the weapons no longer viable after the end of a conflict.

In May 2008, then-Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Stephen Mull stated that the US military relies upon cluster munitions as an important part of their war strategy. Mull emphasized that &quot;US forces simply cannot fight by design or by doctrine without holding out at least the possibility of using cluster munitions.&quot;

The US Army ceased procurement of GMLRS cluster rockets in December 2008 because of a submunition dud rate as high as five percent. Pentagon policy was to have all cluster munitions used after 2018 to have a submunition unexploded ordnance rate of less than one percent. To achieve this, the Army undertook the Alternative Warhead Program (AWP) to assess and recommend technologies to reduce or eliminate cluster munition failures, as some 80 percent of US military cluster weapons reside in Army artillery stockpiles. In July 2012, the US fired at a target area with 36 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) unitary warhead rockets. Analysis indicated that capability gaps existed as cluster munitions require approval by the Combatant Commander which reduced the advantage of responsive precision fire. The same effect could have been made by four Alternative Warhead (AW) GMLRS rockets under development by the AWP to engage the same target set as cluster munitions. Without access to the AW, the operation required using nine times as many rockets, cost nine times as much ($3.6 million compared to $400,000), and took 40 times as long (more than 20 minutes compared to less than 30 seconds) to execute.

Starting with the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8) annual Consolidated Appropriations Act legislation has placed export moratorium language on cluster weapons since then. On 19 May 2011 the Defense Security Cooperation Agency issued a memorandum prohibiting the sale of all but the CBU-97B CBU-105 Sensor Fuzed Weapon because the others have been demonstrated to have a unexploded ordnance rate of greater than 1%.

On 30 November 2017, the Pentagon put off indefinitely their planned ban on using cluster bombs after 2018, as they had been unable to produce submunitions with failure rates of 1% or less. Since it is unclear how long it might take to achieve that standard, a months-long policy review concluded the deadline should be postponed; deployment of existing cluster weapons is left to commanders&#x27; discretion to authorize their use when deemed necessary &quot;until sufficient quantities&quot; of safer versions are developed and fielded.

In addition, at least three countries that no longer exist (the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan) used cluster bombs. In some cases, the responsibility or even the use of cluster munition is denied by the local government.

===Non-state armed groups===

Very few violent non-state actors have used cluster munitions and their delivery systems due to the complexity. As of August 2019, cluster munitions have been used in conflicts by non-state actors in at least six countries.

==Producers==
At least 31 nations have produced cluster munitions in recent history (since the creation of the United Nations). Many of these nations still have stocks of these munitions. Most (but not all) of them are involved in recent wars or long unsolved international conflicts; however most of them did not use the munitions they produced. Countries listed in bold have signed and ratified the Convention on Cluster Munitions, agreeing in principle to ban cluster bombs. As of February 2024, countries marked with an Asterisk (*) officially ceased production of cluster munitions; countries marked with two asterisks (**) unofficially ceased production of cluster munitions.
