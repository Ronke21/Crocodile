<text>Sacrifice is the offering of material possessions or the lives of animals or humans to a deity as an act of propitiation or worship. Evidence of ritual animal sacrifice has been seen at least since ancient Hebrews and Greeks, and possibly existed before that. Evidence of ritual human sacrifice can also be found back to at least pre-Columbian civilizations of Mesoamerica as well as in European civilizations. Varieties of ritual non-human sacrifices are practiced by numerous religions today.

== Terminology ==

The Latin term &quot;sacrificium&quot; (a sacrifice) derived from Latin &quot;sacrificus&quot; (performing priestly functions or sacrifices), which combined the concepts &quot;sacra&quot; (sacred things) and &quot;facere&quot; (to make, to do).
The Latin word &quot;sacrificium&quot; came to apply to the Christian eucharist in particular, sometimes named a &quot;bloodless sacrifice&quot; to distinguish it from blood sacrifices. In individual non-Christian ethnic religions, terms translated as &quot;sacrifice&quot; include the Indic &quot;yajna&quot;, the Greek &quot;thusia&quot;, the Germanic &quot;blōtan&quot;, the Semitic &quot;qorban&quot;/&quot;qurban&quot;, Slavic żertwa, etc.

The term usually implies &quot;doing without something&quot; or &quot;giving something up&quot; (see also self-sacrifice). But the word &quot;sacrifice&quot; also occurs in metaphorical use to describe doing good for others or taking a short-term loss in return for a greater power gain, such as in a game of chess.

== Theories of Sacrifice ==
While no scholarly consensus on the origins and function of sacrifice exist, multiple scholars have developed theories on sacrifice.

E.B. Tylor suggested that sacrifice could be understood as a gift to the divine, either valued by the divinity on its own merits, valued as an act of homage, or valued based on the hardship of the sacrifice itself.

William Robertson Smith in &quot;The Religion of the Semites&quot; argued that the sole function of sacrifice was for humans to achieve communion with the divine. Robertson Smith based his theory on the sacrificial system of the Hebrew Bible, where the eating of burnt offerings by priests brought them closer to God. Robertson Smith linked Ancient Hebrew sacrifice to sacrifices of totem animals, a claim which was rejected by later anthropologists.

Influenced by Robertson Smith, Émile Durkheim in &quot;The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life&quot; argued that sacrifice served a dual function: social communion and divine communion. Working from ethnographies of the Aboriginal Australians published by Walter Baldwin Spencer and Francis James Gillen, Durkheim argued that the Aboriginal Australians sacrificed to reinforce communal ties, as sacrifices took place during periods of social gathering. Both the broader functionalist explanations of Durkheim and the accuracy of his ethnographic sources have been questioned by later scholars.

Building from Durkheim&#x27;s functionalist theories of sacrifice Durkheim’s nephew and disciple Marcel Mauss collaborated with historian Henri Hubert to argue that sacrifice is a form of gift directed to the gods with the social expectation that the gods would offer a greater gift at a later date.

Sigmund Freud, influenced by the Robertson Smith’s theories of sacrifice and by Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, argued in &quot;Totem and Taboo&quot; that the sacrifice of a totem animal was a symbolic recapitulation of the murder and cannibalization of the primal father. Sacrifice, Freud argued, was a neurotic ritual to displace guilt for inner-psychic tension produced by repressing the Oedipal Complex.

René Girard argued that sacrifice functioned as a temporary catharsis for the mimetic desire individuals have to possess what others have. Thus, sacrifice functions as a form of displaced aggression on an innocent scapegoat. Girard rejected Freud’s interpretation that the victim of the sacrifice was guilty, emphasizing that the victim is a surrogate target for, not a symbol of, collective violence.

Nancy Jay argued that sacrifice creates and maintains patrilineal kinship structures. Jay observed that sacrificial rituals were almost exclusively performed by men. Jay argued that the shedding of “pure” blood in sacrifice by men contrasted with the shedding of “impure” blood in childbirth and menstruation by women, allowing patriarchs to ideologically justify the patrilineal inheritance of wealth and power.

Georges Bataille in the &quot;The Accursed Share&quot; argued that sacrifice in pre-modern societies was a deliberate form of conspicuous consumption of surplus value.

== Animal sacrifice ==
Animal sacrifice is the ritual killing of an animal as part of a religion. It is practiced by adherents of many religions as a means of appeasing a god or gods or changing the course of nature. It also served a social or economic function in those cultures where the edible portions of the animal were distributed among those attending the sacrifice for consumption. Animal sacrifice has turned up in almost all cultures, from the Hebrews to the Greeks and Romans (particularly the purifying ceremony Lustratio), Egyptians (for example in the cult of Apis) and from the Aztecs to the Yoruba. The religion of the ancient Egyptians forbade the sacrifice of animals other than sheep, bulls, calves, male calves and geese.

Animal sacrifice is still practiced today by the followers of Santería and other lineages of Orisa as a means of curing the sick and giving thanks to the Orisa (gods). However, in Santeria, such animal offerings constitute an extremely small portion of what are termed &quot;ebos&quot;—ritual activities that include offerings, prayer and deeds. Christians from some villages in Greece also sacrifice animals to Orthodox saints in a practice known as kourbánia. The practice, while publicly condemned, is often tolerated.

== Human sacrifice ==

Human sacrifice was practiced by many ancient cultures. People would be ritually killed in a manner that was supposed to please or appease a god or spirit.

Some occasions for human sacrifice found in multiple cultures on multiple continents include:
* Human sacrifice to accompany the dedication of a new temple or bridge.
* Sacrifice of people upon the death of a king, high priest or great leader; the sacrificed were supposed to serve or accompany the deceased leader in the next life.
* Human sacrifice in times of natural disaster. Droughts, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, etc. were seen as a sign of anger or displeasure by deities, and sacrifices were supposed to lessen the divine ire.

There is evidence to suggest Pre-Hellenic Minoan cultures practiced human sacrifice. Corpses were found at a number of sites in the citadel of Knossos in Crete. The north house at Knossos contained the bones of children who appeared to have been butchered. The myth of Theseus and the Minotaur (set in the labyrinth at Knossos) suggests human sacrifice. In the myth, Athens sent seven young men and seven young women to Crete as human sacrifices to the Minotaur. This ties up with the archaeological evidence that most sacrifices were of young adults or children.

The Phoenicians of Carthage were reputed to practise child sacrifice, and though the scale of sacrifices may have been exaggerated by ancient authors for political or religious reasons, there is archaeological evidence of large numbers of children&#x27;s skeletons buried in association with sacrificial animals. Plutarch (ca. 46–120 AD) mentions the practice, as do Tertullian, Orosius, Diodorus Siculus and Philo. They describe children being roasted to death while still conscious on a heated bronze idol.

Human sacrifice was practiced by various Pre-Columbian civilizations of Mesoamerica. The Aztec in particular are known for the practice of human sacrifice. Current estimates of Aztec sacrifice are between a couple of thousand and twenty thousand per year. Some of these sacrifices were to help the sun rise, some to help the rains come, and some to dedicate the expansions of the great &quot;Templo Mayor&quot;, located in the heart of Tenochtitlán (the capital of the Aztec Empire). There are also accounts of captured conquistadores being sacrificed during the wars of the Spanish invasion of Mexico.

In Scandinavia, the old Scandinavian religion contained human sacrifice, as both the Norse sagas and German historians relate. See, e.g. Temple at Uppsala and Blót.

In the &quot;Aeneid&quot; by Virgil, the character Sinon claims (falsely) that he was going to be a human sacrifice to Poseidon to calm the seas.

Human sacrifice is no longer officially condoned in any country, and any cases which may take place are regarded as murder.

== By religion ==
=== Ancient China and Confucianism ===

During the Shang and Zhou dynasty, the ruling class had a complicated and hierarchical sacrificial system. Sacrificing to ancestors was an important duty of nobles, and an emperor could hold hunts, start wars, and convene royal family members in order to get the resources to hold sacrifices,
 serving to unify states in a common goal and demonstrate the strength of the emperor&#x27;s rule.
Archaeologist Kwang-chih Chang states in his book &quot;Art, Myth and Ritual: the Path to Political Authority in Ancient China&quot; (1983) that the sacrificial system strengthened the authority of ancient China&#x27;s ruling class and promoted production, e.g. through casting ritual bronzes.

Confucius supported the restoration of the Zhou sacrificial system, which excluded human sacrifice, with the goal of maintaining social order and enlightening people. Mohism considered any kind of sacrifice to be too extravagant for society.
=== Chinese folk religion ===
Members of Chinese folk religions often use pork, chicken, duck, fish, squid, or shrimp in sacrificial offerings. For those who believe the high deities to be vegetarian, some altars are two-tiered: The high one offers vegetarian food, and the low one holds animal sacrifices for the high deities&#x27; soldiers. Some ceremonies of supernatural spirits and ghosts, like the Ghost Festival, use whole goats or pigs. There are competitions of raising the heaviest pig for sacrifice in Taiwan and Teochew.
=== Christianity ===
In Nicene Christianity, God became incarnate as Jesus, sacrificing his son to accomplish the reconciliation of God and humanity, which had separated itself from God through sin (see the concept of original sin). According to a view that has featured prominently in Western theology since early in the 2nd millennium, God&#x27;s justice required an atonement for sin from humanity if human beings were to be restored to their place in creation and saved from damnation. However, God knew limited human beings could not make sufficient atonement, for humanity&#x27;s offense to God was infinite, so God created a covenant with Abraham, which he fulfilled when he sent his only Son to become the sacrifice for the broken covenant. According to this theology, Christ&#x27;s sacrifice replaced the insufficient animal sacrifice of the Old Covenant; Christ the &quot;Lamb of God&quot; replaced the lambs&#x27; sacrifice of the ancient &quot;Korban Todah&quot; (the Rite of Thanksgiving), chief of which is the Passover in the Mosaic law.

In the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Churches, the Lutheran Churches, the Methodist Churches, and the Irvingian Churches, the Eucharist or Mass, as well as the Divine Liturgy of the Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodox Church, is seen as a sacrifice. Among the Anglicans the words of the liturgy make explicit that the Eucharist is a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving and is a material offering to God in union with Christ using such words, as &quot;with these thy holy gifts which we now offer unto Thee&quot; (1789 BCP) or &quot;presenting to you from the gifts you have given us we offer you these gifts&quot; (Prayer D BCP 1976) as clearly evidenced in the revised Books of Common Prayer from 1789 in which the theology of Eucharist was moved closer to the Catholic position. Likewise, the United Methodist Church in its Eucharistic liturgy contains the words &quot;Let us offer ourselves and our gifts to God&quot; (A Service of Word and Table I). The United Methodist Church officially teaches that &quot;Holy Communion is a type of sacrifice&quot; that re-presents, rather than repeats the sacrifice of Christ on the Cross; She further proclaims that: 

A formal statement by the USCCB affirms that &quot;Methodists and Catholics agree that the sacrificial language of the Eucharistic celebration refers to &#x27;the sacrifice of Christ once-for-all,&#x27; to &#x27;our pleading of that sacrifice here and now,&#x27; to &#x27;our offering of the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving,&#x27; and to &#x27;our sacrifice of ourselves in union with Christ who offered himself to the Father.&#x27;&quot;

Roman Catholic theology speaks of the Eucharist not being a separate or additional sacrifice to that of Christ on the cross; it is rather exactly the same sacrifice, which transcends time and space (&quot;the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world&quot; – Rev. 13:8), renewed and made present, the only distinction being that it is offered in an unbloody manner. The sacrifice is made present without Christ dying or being crucified again; it is a re-presentation of the &quot;once and for all&quot; sacrifice of Calvary by the now risen Christ, who continues to offer himself and what he has done on the cross as an oblation to the Father. The complete identification of the Mass with the sacrifice of the cross is found in Christ&#x27;s words at the last supper over the bread and wine: &quot;This is my body, which is given up for you,&quot; and &quot;This is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed...unto the forgiveness of sins.&quot; The bread and wine, offered by Melchizedek in sacrifice in the old covenant (Genesis 14:18; Psalm 110:4), are transformed through the Mass into the body and blood of Christ (see transubstantiation; note: the Orthodox Church and Methodist Church do not hold as dogma, as do Catholics, the doctrine of transubstantiation, preferring rather to not make an assertion regarding the &quot;how&quot; of the sacraments), and the offering becomes one with that of Christ on the cross. In the Mass as on the cross, Christ is both priest (offering the sacrifice) and victim (the sacrifice he offers is himself), though in the Mass in the former capacity he works through a solely human priest who is joined to him through the sacrament of Holy Orders and thus shares in Christ&#x27;s priesthood as do all who are baptized into the death and resurrection of Jesus, the Christ. Through the Mass, the effects of the one sacrifice of the cross can be understood as working toward the redemption of those present, for their specific intentions and prayers, and to assisting the souls in purgatory. For Catholics, the theology of sacrifice has seen considerable change as the result of historical and scriptural studies. For Lutherans, the Eucharist is a &quot;sacrifice of thanksgiving and praise…in that by giving thanks a person acknowledges that he or she is in need of the gift and that his or her situation will change only by receiving the gift&quot;. The Irvingian Churches, teach the &quot;real presence of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ in Holy Communion&quot;: 

The concept of self-sacrifice and martyrs are central to Christianity. Often found in Roman Catholicism is the idea of joining one&#x27;s own life and sufferings to the sacrifice of Christ on the cross. Thus one can offer up involuntary suffering, such as illness, or purposefully embrace suffering in acts of penance. Some Protestants criticize this as a denial of the all-sufficiency of Christ&#x27;s sacrifice, but according to Roman Catholic interpretation it finds support in St. Paul: &quot;Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ&#x27;s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church&quot; (Col 1:24). Pope John Paul II explained in his Apostolic Letter &quot;Salvifici Doloris&quot; (11 February 1984):In the Cross of Christ not only is the Redemption accomplished through suffering, but also human suffering itself has been redeemed. ...Every man has his own share in the Redemption. Each one is also called to share in that suffering through which the Redemption was accomplished. ...In bringing about the Redemption through suffering, Christ has also raised human suffering to the level of the Redemption. Thus each man, in his suffering, can also become a sharer in the redemptive suffering of Christ. ...The sufferings of Christ created the good of the world&#x27;s redemption. This good in itself is inexhaustible and infinite. No man can add anything to it. But at the same time, in the mystery of the Church as his Body, Christ has in a sense opened his own redemptive suffering to all human suffering&quot; (&quot;Salvifici Doloris&quot; 19; 24).

Some Christians reject the idea of the Eucharist as a sacrifice, inclining to see it as merely a holy meal (even if they believe in a form of the real presence of Christ in the bread and wine, as Reformed Christians do). The more recent the origin of a particular tradition, the less emphasis is placed on the sacrificial nature of the Eucharist. The Roman Catholic response is that the sacrifice of the Mass in the New Covenant is that one sacrifice for sins on the cross which transcends time offered in an unbloody manner, as discussed above, and that Christ is the real priest at every Mass working through mere human beings to whom he has granted the grace of a share in his priesthood. As &quot;priest&quot; carries connotations of &quot;one who offers sacrifice&quot;, some Protestants, with the exception of Lutherans and Anglicans, usually do not use it for their clergy. Evangelical Protestantism emphasizes the importance of a decision to accept Christ&#x27;s sacrifice on the Cross consciously and personally as atonement for one&#x27;s individual sins if one is to be saved—this is known as &quot;accepting Christ as one&#x27;s personal Lord and Savior&quot;.

The Eastern Orthodox Churches see the celebration of the Eucharist as a continuation, rather than a reenactment, of the Last Supper, as Fr. John Matusiak (of the OCA) says: &quot;The Liturgy is not so much a reenactment of the Mystical Supper or these events as it is a continuation of these events, which are beyond time and space. The Orthodox also see the Eucharistic Liturgy as a bloodless sacrifice, during which the bread and wine we offer to God become the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ through the descent and operation of the Holy Spirit, Who effects the change.&quot; This view is witnessed to by the prayers of the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, when the priest says: &quot;Accept, O God, our supplications, make us to be worthy to offer unto thee supplications and prayers and bloodless sacrifices for all thy people,&quot; and &quot;Remembering this saving commandment and all those things which came to pass for us: the cross, the grave, the resurrection on the third day, the ascension into heaven, the sitting down at the right hand, the second and glorious coming again, Thine own of Thine own we offer unto Thee on behalf of all and for all,&quot; and &quot;… Thou didst become man and didst take the name of our High Priest, and deliver unto us the priestly rite of this liturgical and bloodless sacrifice…&quot;

=== Hinduism ===
The modern practice of Hindu animal sacrifice is mostly associated with Shaktism, and in currents of folk Hinduism strongly rooted in local popular or tribal traditions. Animal sacrifices were part of the ancient Vedic religion in India, and are mentioned in scriptures such as the Yajurveda. For instance, these scriptures mention the use of mantras for goat sacrifices as a means of abolishing human sacrifice and replacing it with animal sacrifice. Even if animal sacrifice was common historically in Hinduism, contemporary Hindus believe that both animals and humans have souls and may not be offered as sacrifices. This concept is called ahimsa, the Hindu law of non-injury and no harm. Some Puranas forbid animal sacrifice.

=== Islam ===

An animal sacrifice in Arabic is called &quot;ḏabiḥa&quot; (ذَبِيْحَة) or &quot;Qurban&quot; (قُرْبَان) . The term may have roots from the Jewish term &quot;Korban&quot;; in some places like Bangladesh, India or Pakistan, &quot;qurbani&quot; is always used for Islamic animal sacrifice. In the Islamic context, an animal sacrifice referred to as &quot;ḏabiḥa&quot; (ذَبِيْحَة) meaning &quot;sacrifice as a ritual&quot; is offered only in Eid ul-Adha. The sacrificial animal may be a sheep, a goat, a camel, or a cow. The animal must be healthy and conscious.
&quot;...Therefore to the Lord turn in Prayer and Sacrifice.&quot; (Quran 108:2) 
Qurban is an Islamic prescription for the affluent to share their good fortune with the needy in the community.

On the occasion of Eid ul Adha (Festival of Sacrifice), affluent Muslims all over the world perform the Sunnah of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) by sacrificing a cow or sheep. The meat is then divided into three equal parts. One part is retained by the person who performs the sacrifice. The second is given to his relatives. The third part is distributed to the poor.

The Quran states that the sacrifice has nothing to do with the blood and gore (Quran 22:37: &quot;It is not their meat nor their blood that reaches God. It is your piety that reaches Him...&quot;). Rather, it is done to help the poor and in remembrance of Abraham&#x27;s willingness to sacrifice his son Ismael at God&#x27;s command.

The Urdu and Persian word &quot;Qurbani&quot; comes from the Arabic word &#x27;Qurban&#x27;. It suggests that associate act performed to hunt distance to Almighty God and to hunt His sensible pleasure. Originally, the word &#x27;Qurban&#x27; enclosed all acts of charity as a result of the aim of charity is nothing however to hunt Allah&#x27;s pleasure. But, in precise non-secular nomenclature, the word was later confined to the sacrifice of associate animal slaughtered for the sake of Allah.

A similar symbology, which is a reflection of Abraham and Ismael&#x27;s dilemma, is the stoning of the Jamaraat which takes place during the pilgrimage.

=== Judaism ===
Ritual sacrifice was practiced in Ancient Israel, with the opening chapters of the book Leviticus detailing parts of an overview referring to the exact methods of bringing sacrifices. Although sacrifices could include bloodless offerings (grain and wine), the most important were animal sacrifices. Blood sacrifices were divided into burnt offerings (Hebrew: עלה קרבנות) in which the whole unmaimed animal was burnt, guilt offerings (in which part was burnt and part left for the priest) and peace offerings (in which similarly only part of the undamaged animal was burnt and the rest eaten in ritually pure conditions).

After the destruction of the Second Temple, ritual sacrifice ceased except among the Samaritans. Maimonides, a medieval Jewish rationalist, argued that God always held sacrifice inferior to prayer and philosophical meditation. However, God understood that the Israelites were used to the animal sacrifices that the surrounding pagan tribes used as the primary way to commune with their gods. As such, in Maimonides&#x27; view, it was only natural that Israelites would believe that sacrifice was a necessary part of the relationship between God and man. Maimonides concludes that God&#x27;s decision to allow sacrifices was a concession to human psychological limitations. It would have been too much to have expected the Israelites to leap from pagan worship to prayer and meditation in one step. In the &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, he writes:

:&quot;But the custom which was in those days general among men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up consisted in sacrificing animals... It was in accordance with the wisdom and plan of God...that God did not command us to give up and to discontinue all these manners of service. For to obey such a commandment would have been contrary to the nature of man, who generally cleaves to that to which he is used; it would in those days have made the same impression as a prophet would make at present [the 12th Century] if he called us to the service of God and told us in His name, that we should not pray to God nor fast, nor seek His help in time of trouble; that we should serve Him in thought, and not by any action.&quot; (Book III, Chapter 32. Translated by M. Friedlander, 1904, &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, Dover Publications, 1956 edition.)

In contrast, many others such as Nachmanides (in his Torah commentary on Leviticus 1:9) disagreed, contending that sacrifices are an ideal in Judaism, completely central.

The teachings of the Torah and Tanakh reveal the Israelites&#x27;s familiarity with human sacrifices, as exemplified by the near-sacrifice of Isaac by his father Abraham (Genesis 22:1–24) and some believe, the actual sacrifice of Jephthah&#x27;s daughter (Judges 11:31–40), while many believe that Jephthah&#x27;s daughter was committed for life in service equivalent to a nunnery of the day, as indicated by her lament over her &quot;weep for my virginity&quot; and never having known a man (v37). The king of Moab gives his firstborn son and heir as a whole burnt offering, albeit to the pagan god Chemosh. In the book of Micah, one asks, &#x27;Shall I give my firstborn for my sin, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?&#x27; (), and receives a response, &#x27;It hath been told thee, O man, what is good, and what the LORD doth require of thee: only to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.&#x27; () Abhorrence of the practice of child sacrifice is emphasized by Jeremiah. See Jeremiah 7:30–32.

<text>The 1983 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday 9 June 1983. It gave the Conservative Party under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher the most decisive election victory since that of the Labour Party in 1945, with a majority of 144 seats and the first of two consecutive landslide victories.

Thatcher&#x27;s first term as Prime Minister had not been an easy time. Unemployment increased during the first three years of her premiership and the economy went through a recession. However, the British victory in the Falklands War led to a recovery of her personal popularity, and economic growth had begun to resume.

By the time Thatcher called the election in May 1983, opinion polls pointed to a Conservative victory, with most national newspapers backing the re-election of the Conservative government. The resulting win earned the Conservatives their biggest parliamentary majority of the post-war era, and their second-biggest majority as a majority government, behind only the 1924 general election (they earned even more seats in the 1931 general election, but were part of the National Government).

The Labour Party had been led by Michael Foot since the resignation of former Prime Minister James Callaghan as Leader of the Labour Party in 1980, and its new policies were considered more left-wing than before. Several moderate Labour MPs had defected from the party to form the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which then formed the SDP–Liberal Alliance with the existing Liberal Party. Labour was further harmed by its promise to withdraw from the European Economic Community, which alienated Pro-European groups.

The opposition vote split almost evenly between the Alliance and Labour. With its worst electoral performance since 1931, the Labour vote fell by over 3,000,000 votes from 1979, accounting for both a national swing of almost 4% towards the Conservatives and their larger parliamentary majority of 144 seats, even though the Conservatives&#x27; total vote fell by almost 700,000. This was the last general election until 2015 in which a governing party increased its number of seats.

The Alliance finished in third place but came within 700,000 votes of out-polling Labour; by gaining 25.4% of the vote it won the largest percentage for any third party since 1923. Despite this, it won only 23 seats, whereas Labour won 209. The Liberals argued that a proportional electoral system would have given them a more representative number of MPs. Changing the electoral system from First-Past-The-Post had been a long-running campaign plank of the Liberal Party and would later be adopted by its successor, the Liberal Democrats.

The election night was broadcast live on the BBC and was presented by David Dimbleby, Sir Robin Day and Peter Snow. It was also broadcast on ITV and presented by Alastair Burnet, Peter Sissons and Martyn Lewis.

Three future leaders of the Labour Party were first elected to Parliament at this election: Tony Blair (1994–2007), Gordon Brown (2007–2010) and Jeremy Corbyn (2015–2020). In addition, two future Leaders of the Liberal Democrats, Paddy Ashdown and Charles Kennedy, were first elected. Michael Howard, who later served the Conservatives as Home Secretary in government and as party leader from 2003 to 2005, was also first elected to Parliament in 1983.

At the same time, a number of prominent Members of Parliament stepped aside or lost their seats. Former Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson stood down from Parliament after 38 years, while the Alliance&#x27;s Shirley Williams and Bill Pitt lost their seats only a short time after having won them. Joan Lestor and Tony Benn as well as former Liberal leader Jo Grimond and Speaker of the House of Commons and former Labour Cabinet Minister George Thomas also departed from Parliament at this election, although Benn would return after winning a by-election in Chesterfield the following year, and Lestor returned to Parliament after winning a seat at the next general election in 1987. 

==Background and campaign==
Michael Foot was elected leader of the Labour Party at the end of 1980, replacing James Callaghan. The election of Foot signalled that the core of the party was swinging to the left and the move exacerbated divisions within the party. During 1981, a group of senior figures including Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams left Labour to found the Social Democratic Party (SDP). The SDP agreed to a pact with the Liberals for the 1983 election and stood as &quot;The Alliance&quot;. For a while the Alliance topped the opinion polls and looked capable of achieving their goal of forming a coalition government at the next general election, but the success of the Falklands campaign in 1982 saw the political tide turn in favour of the Conservative government.

The election did not have to be held until 1984. Although political circumstances were clearly favourable for the government and opposition parties anticipated that Mrs Thatcher would go to the country in June, earlier in 1983 the Conservatives were split on the timing of the election. One faction favoured a June election, but another group wanted to wait until October before going to the country, while some within the Party even advocated delaying the contest until 1984. Supporters of waiting to a later time to hold an election included Thatcher&#x27;s deputy and Home Secretary William Whitelaw and John Biffen who was then serving as Leader of the House of Commons. On 27 April it was reported that all the Conservative party&#x27;s regional agents had unanimously expressed a preference to Thatcher for a June election, although some members of her cabinet were advising her to wait until October. On 8 May senior Conservatives met at Chequers and agreed to go to the country on 9 June. The election was formally called the next day and Parliament was dissolved on 13 May for a four-week official election campaign.

The campaign displayed the huge divisions between the two major parties. Thatcher had been highly unpopular during her first two years in office until the swift and decisive victory in the Falklands War, coupled with an improving economy, considerably raised her standings in the polls. The Conservatives&#x27; key issues included reducing unemployment (which had increased from 1.5 million in 1979 to more than 3 million by 1982), continuing economic growth following the recent recession, and defence. Labour&#x27;s campaign manifesto involved leaving the European Economic Community, abolishing the House of Lords, abandoning the United Kingdom&#x27;s nuclear deterrent by cancelling Trident and removing cruise missiles — a programme dubbed by Labour MP Gerald Kaufman &quot;the longest suicide note in history&quot;; &quot;Although, at barely 37 pages, it only seemed interminable&quot;, noted Roy Hattersley. Pro-Labour political journalist Michael White, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, commented: &quot;There was something magnificently brave about Michael Foot&#x27;s campaign but it was like the Battle of the Somme.&quot;

The Alliance had had a setback ahead of the campaign at the Darlington by-election in March. The contest was one that had looked promising ground for the SDP, but despite heavily campaigning in the Labour-held seat, the SDP candidate, who struggled when interviewed for television by Vincent Hanna finished a poor third, which stalled the momentum of the Alliance. During the campaign, on Sunday 29 May, David Steel held a meeting with Jenkins and other Alliance leaders at his Ettrickbridge home. Steel, who polls showed was more popular proposed that Jenkins take a lower profile and that Steel take over as leader of the campaign. Jenkins rejected Steel&#x27;s view and remained &quot;Prime Minister designate&quot;, but Steel did have a heightened role on television for the last 10 days of the election campaign. According to Steve Richards the meeting meant Jenkins&#x27; &quot;confidence was undermined and he staggered to the finishing line with less verve than he had displayed in the early days of the SDP&quot; and showed little sign of his earlier &quot;exuberance&quot;.

==Notional election, 1979==

Following boundary changes in 1983, the BBC and ITN (Independent Television News) co-produced a calculation of how the 1979 general election would have gone if fought on the new 1983 boundaries. The following table shows the effects of the boundary changes on the House of Commons:&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC/ITN(1983)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 



==Timeline==
The Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited Buckingham Palace on the afternoon of 9 May and asked the Queen to dissolve Parliament on 13 May, announcing that the election would be held on 9 June. The key dates were as follows:
==Results==

The election saw the Conservatives win a landslide victory, improving on their 1979 result and achieving their best results since 1935. Although there was a slight drop in their share of the vote, they made significant gains at the expense of Labour. The Tories have yet to match their 1983 seat total in any subsequent general election, although they recorded a higher share of the popular vote in 2019.

The night was a disaster for the Labour Party; their share of the vote fell by over 9%, which meant they were only 700,000 votes ahead of the newly formed third party, the SDP–Liberal Alliance. The massive increase of support for the Alliance at the expense of Labour meant that, in many seats, the collapse in the Labour vote allowed the Conservatives to gain. Despite winning over 25% of the national vote, the Alliance got fewer than 4% of seats, 186 fewer than Labour. The most significant Labour loss of the night was Tony Benn, who was defeated in the revived Bristol East seat. SDP President Shirley Williams, then a prominent leader in the Social Democratic Party, lost her Crosby seat which she had won in a by-election in 1981. Bill Rodgers, another leading figure in the Alliance (like Williams, one of the &quot;Gang of Four&quot;) also failed to win his old seat that he previously held as a Labour MP.

In Scotland, both Labour and the Conservatives sustained modest losses to the Alliance. Labour remained by far the largest party, with 41 seats to 21 for the Scottish Conservatives. The Scottish Conservatives have been unable to match their 1983 Westminster seat total since, although they did record a slightly larger share of the Scottish vote in 2017, by which time the Scottish National Party had become the dominant party in Scotland with the Conservatives being the largest unionist party, with 13 seats won in 2017; their strongest performance in Scotland in 34 years.

On a nationwide basis, the 1983 UK general election was the worst result in Labour&#x27;s modern history until the 2019 general election, in terms of seats won. The result in 1983 remains the worst-ever modern performance for Labour in England.

<doc id="80332" wikidata="Q119094" url="?curid=80332" title="Human sacrifice">
<text>Human sacrifice is the act of killing one or more humans as part of a ritual, which is usually intended to please or appease gods, a human ruler, public or jurisdictional demands for justice by capital punishment, an authoritative/priestly figure, spirits of dead ancestors or as a retainer sacrifice, wherein a monarch&#x27;s servants are killed in order for them to continue to serve their master in the next life. Closely related practices found in some tribal societies are cannibalism and headhunting. Human sacrifice is also known as ritual murder.

Human sacrifice was practiced in many human societies beginning in prehistoric times. By the Iron Age with the associated developments in religion (the Axial Age), human sacrifice was becoming less common throughout Africa, Europe, and Asia, and came to be looked down upon as barbaric during classical antiquity. In the Americas, however, human sacrifice continued to be practiced, by some, to varying degrees until the European colonization of the Americas. Today, human sacrifice has become extremely rare.

Modern secular laws treat human sacrifices as murder. Most major religions in the modern day condemn the practice. For example in Hinduism, the Shrimad Bhagavatam condemns human sacrifice and cannibalism, warning of severe punishment in the afterlife for those who commit such acts.
==Evolution and context==

Human sacrifice has been practiced on a number of different occasions and in many different cultures. The various rationales behind human sacrifice are the same that motivate religious sacrifice in general. Human sacrifice is typically intended to bring good fortune and to pacify the gods, for example in the context of the dedication of a completed building like a temple or bridge. Fertility was another common theme in ancient religious sacrifices, such as sacrifices to the Aztec god of agriculture Xipe Totec.

In ancient Japan, legends talk about &quot;hitobashira&quot; (&quot;human pillar&quot;), in which maidens were buried alive at the base of or near some constructions to protect the buildings against disasters or enemy attacks, and almost identical accounts appear in the Balkans (The Building of Skadar and Bridge of Arta).

For the re-consecration of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in 1487, the Aztecs reported that they killed about 80,400 prisoners over the course of four days. According to Ross Hassig, author of &quot;Aztec Warfare&quot;, &quot;between 10,000 and 80,400 persons&quot; were sacrificed in the ceremony.

Human sacrifice can also have the intention of winning the gods&#x27; favor in warfare. In Homeric legend, Iphigeneia was to be sacrificed by her father Agamemnon to appease Artemis so she would allow the Greeks to wage the Trojan War.

In some notions of an afterlife, the deceased will benefit from victims killed at his funeral. Mongols, Scythians, early Egyptians and various Mesoamerican chiefs could take most of their household, including servants and concubines, with them to the next world. This is sometimes called a &quot;retainer sacrifice&quot;, as the leader&#x27;s retainers would be sacrificed along with their master, so that they could continue to serve him in the afterlife.
Another purpose is divination from the body parts of the victim. According to Strabo, Celts stabbed a victim with a sword and divined the future from his death spasms.

Headhunting is the practice of taking the head of a killed adversary, for ceremonial or magical purposes, or for reasons of prestige. It was found in many pre-modern tribal societies.

Human sacrifice may be a ritual practiced in a stable society, and may even be conducive to enhancing societal unity (see: Sociology of religion), both by creating a bond unifying the sacrificing community, and by combining human sacrifice and capital punishment, by removing individuals that have an adverse effect on societal stability (criminals, religious heretics, foreign slaves or prisoners of war). However, outside of civil religion, human sacrifice may also result in outbursts of blood frenzy and mass killings that destabilize society.

Many cultures show traces of prehistoric human sacrifice in their mythologies and religious texts, but ceased the practice before the onset of historical records. Some see the story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22) as an example of an etiological myth, explaining the abolition of human sacrifice. The Vedic &quot;Purushamedha&quot; (literally &quot;human sacrifice&quot;) is already a purely symbolic act in its earliest attestation. According to Pliny the Elder, human sacrifice in ancient Rome was abolished by a senatorial decree in 97 BCE, although by this time the practice had already become so rare that the decree was mostly a symbolic act. Human sacrifice once abolished is typically replaced by either animal sacrifice, or by the mock-sacrifice of effigies, such as the Argei in ancient Rome.

==History by region==
===Ancient Near East===
Successful agricultural cities had already emerged in the Near East by the Neolithic, some protected behind stone walls. Jericho is the best known of these cities but other similar settlements existed along the coast of the Levant extending north into Asia Minor and west to the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Most of the land was arid and the religious culture of the entire region centered on fertility and rain. Many of the religious rituals, including human sacrifice, had an agricultural focus. Blood was mixed with soil to improve its fertility.

====Ancient Egypt====
There may be evidence of retainer sacrifice in the early dynastic period at Abydos, when on the death of a King he would be accompanied by servants, and possibly high officials, who would continue to serve him in eternal life. The skeletons that were found had no obvious signs of trauma, leading to speculation that the giving up of life to serve the King may have been a voluntary act, possibly carried out in a drug-induced state. At about 2800 BCE, any possible evidence of such practices disappeared, though echoes are perhaps to be seen in the burial of statues of servants in Old Kingdom tombs.

Servants of both royalty and high court officials were slain to accompany their masters into the next world. The number of retainers buried surrounding the king&#x27;s tomb was much greater than those of high court officials, however, again suggesting the greater importance of the pharaoh. For example, King Djer had 318 retainer sacrifices buried in his tomb, and 269 retainer sacrifices buried in enclosures surrounding his tomb.

====Biblical accounts====
References in the Bible point to an awareness of and disdain of human sacrifice in the history of ancient Near Eastern practice. During a battle with the Israelites, the King of Moab gives his firstborn son and heir as a whole burnt offering (&quot;olah&quot;, as used of the Temple sacrifice) (2 Kings 3:27). The Bible then recounts that, following the King&#x27;s sacrifice, &quot;There was great indignation [or wrath] against Israel&quot; and that the Israelites had to raise their siege of the Moabite capital and go away. This verse had perplexed many later Jewish and Christian commentators, who tried to explain what the impact of the Moabite King&#x27;s sacrifice was, to make those under siege emboldened while disheartening the Israelites, make God angry at the Israelites or the Israelites fear his anger, make Chemosh (the Moabite god) angry, or otherwise. Whatever the explanation, evidently at the time of writing, such an act of sacrificing the firstborn son and heir, while prohibited by Israelites (Deuteronomy 12:31; 18:9–12), was considered as an emergency measure in the Ancient Near East, to be performed in exceptional cases where divine favor was desperately needed.

The binding of Isaac appears in the Book of Genesis (22), where God tests Abraham by asking him to present his son as a sacrifice on Moriah. Abraham agrees to this command without arguing. The story ends with an angel stopping Abraham at the last minute and providing a ram, caught in some nearby bushes, to be sacrificed instead. Many Bible scholars have suggested this story&#x27;s origin was a remembrance of an era when human sacrifice was abolished in favour of animal sacrifice.

Another probable instance of human sacrifice mentioned in the Bible is Jephthah&#x27;s sacrifice of his daughter in Judges 11. Jephthah vows to sacrifice to God whatever comes to greet him at the door when he returns home if he is victorious in his war against the Ammonites. The vow is stated in the Book of Judges 11:31: &quot;Then whoever comes of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return victorious from the Ammonites, shall be the Lord&#x27;s, to be offered up by me as a burnt offering (NRSV).&quot; When he returns from battle, his virgin daughter runs out to greet him, and Jephthah laments to her that he cannot take back his vow. She begs for, and is granted, &quot;two months, so that I may go and wander on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, my companions and I&quot;, after which &quot;[Jephthah] did with her according to the vow he had made.&quot;

Two kings of Judah, Ahaz and Manassah, sacrificed their sons. Ahaz, in 2 Kings 16:3, sacrificed his son. &quot;... He even made his son pass through fire, according to the abominable practices of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel (NRSV).&quot; King Manasseh sacrificed his sons in 2 Chronicles 33:6. &quot;He made his son pass through fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom ... He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking him to anger (NRSV).&quot; The valley symbolized hell in later religions, such as Christianity, as a result.

====Phoenicia====

According to Roman and Greek sources, Phoenicians and Carthaginians sacrificed infants to their gods. The bones of numerous infants have been found in Carthaginian archaeological sites in modern times, but their cause of death remain controversial. In a single child cemetery called the &quot;Tophet&quot; by archaeologists, an estimated 20,000 urns were deposited.

Plutarch () mentions the practice, as do Tertullian, Orosius, Diodorus Siculus and Philo. Livy and Polybius do not. The Bible asserts that children were sacrificed at a place called the tophet (&quot;roasting place&quot;) to the god Moloch. According to Diodorus Siculus&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot;, &quot;There was in their city a bronze image of Cronus extending its hands, palms up and sloping toward the ground, so that each of the children when placed thereon rolled down and fell into a sort of gaping pit filled with fire.&quot;

Plutarch, however, claims that the children were already dead at the time, having been killed by their parents, whose consent – as well as that of the children – was required. Tertullian explains the acquiescence of the children as a product of their youthful trustfulness.

The accuracy of such stories is disputed by some modern historians and archaeologists.

==== Mesopotamia ====
Retainer sacrifice was practised within the royal tombs of ancient Mesopotamia. Courtiers, guards, musicians, handmaidens, and grooms were presumed to have committed ritual suicide by taking poison.
A 2009 examination of skulls from the royal cemetery at Ur, discovered in Iraq in the 1920s by a team led by C. Leonard Woolley, appears to support a more grisly interpretation of human sacrifices associated with elite burials in ancient Mesopotamia than had previously been recognized. Palace attendants, as part of royal mortuary ritual, were not dosed with poison to meet death serenely. Instead, they were put to death by having a sharp instrument, such as a pike, driven into their heads.

===Europe===
====Neolithic Europe====

There is archaeological evidence of human sacrifice in Neolithic to Eneolithic Europe.

====Greco-Roman antiquity====

The ancient ritual of expelling certain slaves, cripples, or criminals from a community to ward off disaster (known as pharmakos), would at times involve publicly executing the chosen prisoner by throwing them off of a cliff.

References to human sacrifice can be found in Greek historical accounts as well as mythology. The human sacrifice in mythology, the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; salvation in some versions of Iphigeneia (who was about to be sacrificed by her father Agamemnon) and her replacement with a deer by the goddess Artemis, may be a vestigial memory of the abandonment and discrediting of the practice of human sacrifice among the Greeks in favour of animal sacrifice.

In ancient Rome, human sacrifice was infrequent but documented. Roman authors often contrast their own behavior with that of people who would commit the heinous act of human sacrifice, as human sacrifice was often looked down upon. These authors make it clear that such practices were from a much more uncivilized time in the past, far removed. It is thought that many ritualistic celebrations and dedications to gods used to involve human sacrifice but have now been replaced with symbolic offerings. Dionysius of Halicarnassus says that the ritual of the Argei, in which straw figures were tossed into the Tiber river, may have been a substitute for an original offering of elderly men. Cicero claimed that puppets thrown from the &quot;Pons Sublicius&quot; by the Vestal Virgins in a processional ceremony were substitutes for the past sacrifice of old men.

After the Roman defeat at Cannae, two Gauls and two Greeks in male-female couples were buried under the Forum Boarium, in a stone chamber used for the purpose at least once before. In Livy&#x27;s description of these sacrifices, he distances the practice from Roman tradition and asserts that the past human sacrifices evident in the same location were &quot;wholly alien to the Roman spirit.&quot; The rite was apparently repeated in 113 BCE, preparatory to an invasion of Gaul. They buried the two Greeks and the two Gauls alive as a plea to the gods to save Rome from destruction at the hands of Hannibal.

According to Pliny the Elder, human sacrifice was banned by law during the consulship of Publius Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus in 97 BCE, although by this time it was so rare that the decree was largely symbolic. Sulla&#x27;s &quot;Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis&quot; in 82 BC also included punishments for human sacrifice. The Romans also had traditions that centered around ritual murder, but which they did not consider to be sacrifice. Such practices included burying unchaste Vestal Virgins alive and drowning visibly intersex children. These were seen as reactions to extraordinary circumstances as opposed to being part of Roman tradition. Vestal Virgins who were accused of being unchaste were put to death, and a special chamber was built to bury them alive. This aim was to please the gods and restore balance to Rome.
Human sacrifices, in the form of burying individuals alive, were not uncommon during times of panic in ancient Rome. However, the burial of unchaste Vestal Virgins was also practiced in times of peace. Their chasteness was thought to be a safeguard of the city, and even in punishment, the state of their bodies was preserved in order to maintain the peace.

Captured enemy leaders were only occasionally executed at the conclusion of a Roman triumph, and the Romans themselves did not consider these deaths a sacrificial offering. Gladiator combat was thought by the Romans to have originated as fights to the death among war captives at the funerals of Roman generals, and Christian polemicists, such as Tertullian, considered deaths in the arena to be little more than human sacrifice. Over time, participants became criminals and slaves, and their death was considered a sacrifice to the Manes on behalf of the dead.

Political rumors sometimes centered around sacrifice and in doing so, aimed to liken individuals to barbarians and show that the individual had become uncivilized. Human sacrifice also became a marker and defining characteristic of magic and bad religion.
==== Carthage ====
There is literary evidence for infant sacrifice being practiced in Carthage, however, current anthropological analyses have not found physical evidence to back up these claims. There is a Tophet, where infant remains have been found, but after current analytical techniques, it has been concluded this area is more representative of the naturally high infant mortality rate.

====Celtic peoples====
There is some evidence that ancient Celtic peoples practiced human sacrifice. Accounts of Celtic human sacrifice come from Roman and Greek sources. Julius Caesar and Strabo wrote that the Gauls burnt animal and human sacrifices in a large wickerwork figure, known as a wicker man, and said the human victims were usually criminals; while Posidonius wrote that druids who oversaw human sacrifices foretold the future by watching the death throes of the victims. Caesar also wrote that slaves of Gaulish chiefs would be burnt along with the body of their master as part of his funeral rites. In the 1st century AD, Roman writer Lucan mentioned human sacrifices to the Gaulish gods Esus, Teutatis and Taranis. In a 9th-century commentary on Lucan, an unnamed author added that sacrifices to Esus were hanged from a tree, those to Teutates were drowned, and those to Taranis were burned. According to the 2nd-century Roman writer Cassius Dio, Boudica&#x27;s forces impaled Roman captives during her rebellion against the Roman occupation, to the accompaniment of revelry and sacrifices in the sacred groves of Andate. It is important to note, however, that the Romans benefited from making the Celts sound barbaric, and scholars are more skeptical about these accounts now than in the past.

There is some archaeological evidence of human sacrifice among Celtic peoples, although it is rare. Ritual beheading and headhunting was a major religious and cultural practice that has found copious support in the archaeological record, including the numerous skulls found in Londinium&#x27;s River Walbrook and the twelve headless corpses at the Gaulish sanctuary of Gournay-sur-Aronde.

Several ancient Irish bog bodies have been interpreted as kings who were ritually killed, presumably after serious crop failures or other disasters. Some were deposited in bogs on territorial boundaries (which were seen as liminal places) or near royal inauguration sites, and some were found to have eaten a ceremonial last meal. Some academics suggest there are allusions to kings being sacrificed in Irish mythology, particularly in tales of threefold deaths.

The medieval &quot;Dindsenchas&quot; (Lore of Places) says that, in pagan Ireland, first-born children were sacrificed at an idol called Crom Cruach, whose worship was ended by Saint Patrick. However, this account was written by Christian scribes centuries after the supposed events and may be based on biblical traditions about the god Moloch.

In Britain, the medieval legends of Dinas Emrys and of Saint Oran of Iona mention foundation sacrifices, whereby people were ritually killed and buried under foundations to ensure the building&#x27;s safety. The Waldensians sect was later accused of child sacrifice by the Church.

====Baltic peoples====

According to written sources from the 13th–14th centuries, the Lithuanians and Prussians made sacrifices to their pagan gods at their sacred places, alka hills, battlefields and near natural objects (sea, rivers, lakes, etc.). In 1389 following the military victories in the land of Medininkai the Samogitians cast lots which indicated Marquard von Raschau, the commander of Klaipėda (Memel), as a suitable victim for gods and burnt him on horseback in full armour. It possibly was the last human sacrifice in medieval Europe.

====Finnic peoples====

Pope Gregory IX described in a papal letter how the Tavastians in Finland sacrificed Christians to their pagan gods:
&quot;The little children, to whom the light of Christ was revealed in baptism, they violently tore from this light and killed, and adult men, after pulling out their entrails, they sacrifice them to evil spirits and force others to run around trees until death, and some of the priests they blind, from others they brutally sever their hands and other limbs and wrap what is left behind in straws and burn them alive.&quot;

There have been found bog graves in Estonia that have been interpreted to have been part of human sacrifice. According to Aliis Moora, mostly enemy prisoners of war were sacrificed, the main reason indicated in the &quot;Livonian Chronicle&quot; as alleviating crop failure. Sacrifices were also performed as a show of gratitude after a victorious battle. Ritual cannibalism also took place, in order to gain the power of the enemy. The &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; by Adam of Bremen written at the end of the 11th century claims that behind the island of Kuramaa there is an island called Aestland (Estonia), whose inhabitants do not believe in the Christian God. Instead, they worship dragons and birds (dracones adorant cum volucribus) to whom people bought from slavers are sacrificed. According to the &quot;Livonian Chronicle&quot;, describing the events after the Battle of Ümera, &quot;Estonians had seized some Germans, Livs, and Latvians, and some of them they simply killed, others they burned alive and tore the shirts off some of them, carved crosses on their backs with a sword and then beheaded&quot;. The Chronicle explicitly states they were sacrificed &quot;to their gods&quot; (diis suis).

====Germanic peoples====
Human sacrifice was not particularly common among the Germanic peoples, being resorted to in exceptional situations arising from environmental crises (crop failure, drought, famine) or social crises (war), often thought to derive at least in part from the failure of the king to establish or maintain prosperity and peace () in the lands entrusted to him. In later Scandinavian practice, human sacrifice appears to have become more institutionalised and was repeated periodically as part of a larger sacrifice (according to Adam of Bremen, every nine years).

Evidence of human sacrifice by Germanic pagans before the Viking Age depend on archaeology and on a few accounts in Greco-Roman ethnography. Roman writer Tacitus reported the Suebians making human sacrifices to gods he interpreted as Mercury and Isis. He also claimed that Germans sacrificed Roman commanders and officers as a thanksgiving for victory in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Jordanes reported the Goths sacrificing prisoners of war to Mars, suspending the victims&#x27; severed arms from tree branches. Tacitus further refers to those who have transgressed certain societal rules being drowned and placed in wetlands. This potentially explains finds of bog bodies dating to the Roman Iron Age although none show signs of having died by drowning.

By the 10th century, Germanic paganism had become restricted to the Norse people. One account by Ahmad ibn Fadlan in 922 claims Varangian warriors were sometimes buried with enslaved women, in the belief they would become their wives in Valhalla. He describes the funeral of a Varangian chieftain, in which a slave girl volunteered to be buried with him. After ten days of festivities, she was given an intoxicating drink, repeatedly raped by other chiefs, stabbed to death by a priestess, and burnt together with the dead chieftain in his boat (see ship burial). This practice is evidenced archaeologically, with many male warrior burials (such as the ship burial at Balladoole on the Isle of Man, or that at Oseberg in Norway) also containing female remains with signs of trauma.

According to Adémar de Chabannes, just before his death in 932 or 933, Rollo (founder and first ruler of the Viking Duchy of Normandy) performed human sacrifices to appease the pagan gods while at the same time giving gifts to the churches in Normandy.

In the 11th century, Adam of Bremen wrote that human and animal sacrifices were made at the Temple at Gamla Uppsala in Sweden. He wrote that every ninth year, nine men and nine of every animal were sacrificed and their bodies hung in a sacred grove.

The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; and &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; refer to the willing sacrifice of King Dómaldi after bad harvests. The same saga also relates that Dómaldi&#x27;s descendant king Aun sacrificed nine of his own sons to Odin in exchange for longer life, until the Swedes stopped him from sacrificing his last son, Egil.

In the &quot;Saga of Hervor and Heidrek&quot;, Heidrek agrees to the sacrifice of his son in exchange for command over half the army of Reidgotaland. With this, he seizes the whole kingdom and prevents the sacrifice of his son, dedicating those fallen in his rebellion to Odin instead.

====Slavic peoples====

In the 10th century, Persian explorer Ahmad ibn Rustah described funerary rites for the Rus&#x27; (Scandinavian Norsemen traders in northeastern Europe) including the sacrifice of a young female slave. Leo the Deacon describes prisoner sacrifice by the Rus&#x27; led by Sviatoslav during the Russo-Byzantine War &quot;in accordance with their ancestral custom.&quot;

According to the 12th-century Primary Chronicle, prisoners of war were sacrificed to the supreme Slavic deity Perun. Sacrifices to pagan gods, along with paganism itself, were banned after the Christianization of Rus&#x27; by Grand Prince Vladimir the Great in the 980s.

In 1066, the Bishop of Mecklenburg John Scotus was sacrificed to Radegast in Rethra by the Slavic Lutici.

Archeological findings indicate that the practice may have been widespread, at least among slaves, judging from mass graves containing the cremated fragments of a number of different people.

=== East Asia ===

==== China ====

The history of human sacrifice in China may extend as early as 2300 BCE. Excavations of the ancient fortress city of Shimao in the northern part of modern Shaanxi province revealed 80 skulls ritually buried underneath the city&#x27;s eastern wall. Forensic analysis indicates the victims were all teenage girls.

The ancient Chinese are known to have made drowned sacrifices of men and women to the river god Hebo. They also have buried slaves alive with their owners upon death as part of a funeral service. This was especially prevalent during the Shang and Zhou dynasties. During the Warring States period, Ximen Bao of Wei outlawed human sacrificial practices to the river god. In Chinese lore, Ximen Bao is regarded as a folk hero who pointed out the absurdity of human sacrifice.

The sacrifice of a high-ranking male&#x27;s slaves, concubines, or servants upon his death (called &quot;Xun Zang&quot; 殉葬 or &quot;Sheng Xun&quot; 生殉) was a more common form. The stated purpose was to provide companionship for the dead in the afterlife. In earlier times, the victims were either killed or buried alive, while later they were usually forced to commit suicide.

Funeral human sacrifice was widely practiced in the ancient Chinese state of Qin. According to the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; by Han dynasty historian Sima Qian, the practice was started by Duke Wu, the tenth ruler of Qin, who had 66 people buried with him in 678 BCE. The 14th ruler Duke Mu had 177 people buried with him in 621 BCE, including three senior government officials.
Afterwards, the people of Qin wrote the famous poem &quot;Yellow Bird&quot; to condemn this barbaric practice, later compiled in the Confucian &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;.
The tomb of the 18th ruler Duke Jing of Qin, who died in 537 BCE, has been excavated. More than 180 coffins containing the remains of 186 victims were found in the tomb.
The practice would continue until Duke Xian of Qin (424–362 BCE) abolished it in 384 BCE. Modern historian Ma Feibai considers the significance of Duke Xian&#x27;s abolition of human sacrifice in Chinese history comparable to that of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s abolition of slavery in American history.

After the abolition by Duke Xian, funeral human sacrifice became relatively rare throughout the central parts of China. However, the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty revived it in 1395, following the Mongolian Yuan precedent, when his second son died and two of the prince&#x27;s concubines were sacrificed. In 1464, the Tianshun Emperor, in his will, forbade the practice for Ming emperors and princes.

Human sacrifice was also practised by the Manchus. Following Nurhaci&#x27;s death, his wife, Lady Abahai, and his two lesser consorts committed suicide. During the Qing dynasty, sacrifice of slaves was banned by the Kangxi Emperor in 1673.

==== Japan ====
In the practice known as Hitobashira (人柱, &quot;human pillar&quot;), a person was buried alive at the base of large structures such as dams, castles, and bridges.

==== Tibet ====
Human sacrifice was practiced in Tibet prior to the arrival of Buddhism in the 7th century.
Historical practices such as burying bodies under the cornerstones of houses may have been practiced during the medieval era, but few concrete instances have been recorded or verified.

The prevalence of human sacrifice in medieval Buddhist Tibet is less clear. The Lamas, as professing Buddhists, could not condone blood sacrifices, and they replaced the human victims with effigies made from dough which is still to this day dyed partially red to symbolize sacrifice. This replacement of human victims with effigies is attributed to Padmasambhava, a Tibetan saint of the mid-8th century, in Tibetan tradition.

Nevertheless, there is some evidence that outside of orthodox Buddhism, there were practices of tantric human sacrifice which survived throughout the medieval period, and possibly into modern times. The 15th century Blue Annals reports that in the 13th century so-called &quot;18 robber-monks&quot; slaughtered men and women in their ceremonies. Grunfeld (1996) concludes that it cannot be ruled out that isolated instances of human sacrifice did survive in remote areas of Tibet until the mid-20th century, but they must have been rare. Grunfeld also notes that Tibetan practices unrelated to human sacrifice, such as the use of human bone in ritual instruments, have been depicted without evidence as products of human sacrifice.

===Indian subcontinent===
In India, human sacrifice is mainly known as &quot;Narabali&quot;. Here &quot;nara&quot; means human and &quot;bali&quot; means sacrifice. It takes place in some parts of India mostly to find lost treasure. In Maharashtra, the government made it illegal to practice with the Anti-Superstition and Black Magic Act. Currently human sacrifice is very rare in modern India. There have been at least three cases through 2003–2013 where men have been murdered allegedly in the name of human sacrifice.
Thuggees, or thugs, were an organized gang of professional robbers and murderers who traveled in groups across the Indian subcontinent for several hundred years. They were first mentioned in Ẓiyā&#x27;-ud-Dīn Baranī&#x27;s () dated around 1356. Thugs would join travellers and gain their confidence. This would allow them to then surprise and strangle them by tossing a handkerchief or noose around their necks. They would then rob the bodies of valuables and bury them. This led them to also be called &quot;Phansigar&quot; (), a term more commonly used in southern India.

Regarding possible Vedic mention of human sacrifice, the prevailing 19th-century view, associated above all with Henry Colebrooke, was that human sacrifice did not actually take place. Those verses which referred to &quot;purushamedha&quot; were meant to be read symbolically, or as a &quot;priestly fantasy&quot;. However, Rajendralal Mitra published a defence of the thesis that human sacrifice, as had been practised in Bengal, was a continuation of traditions dating back to Vedic periods. Hermann Oldenberg held to Colebrooke&#x27;s view; but Jan Gonda underlined its disputed status.

Human and animal sacrifice became less common during the post-Vedic period, as &quot;ahimsa&quot; (non-violence) became part of mainstream religious thought. The Chandogya Upanishad (3.17.4) includes ahimsa in its list of virtues. The impact of Sramanic religions such as Buddhism and Jainism also became known in the Indian subcontinent.

In the 7th century, Banabhatta, in a description of the dedication of a temple of Chandika, describes a series of human sacrifices; similarly, in the 9th century, Haribhadra describes the sacrifices to Chandika in Odisha. The town of Kuknur in North Karnataka there exists an ancient Kali temple, built around the 8-9th century CE, which has a history of human sacrifices.
Human sacrifice is reputed to have been performed on the altars of the Hatimura Temple, a Shakti (Great Goddess) temple located at Silghat, in the Nagaon district of Assam. It was built during the reign of king Pramatta Singha in 1667 &quot;Sakabda&quot; (1745–1746 CE). It used to be an important center of Shaktism in ancient Assam. Its presiding goddess is Durga in her aspect of &quot;Mahisamardini&quot;, slayer of the demon Mahisasura. It was also performed in the Tamresari Temple which was located in Sadiya under the Chutia kings.

Open human sacrifices were carried out in connection with the worship of Shakti until approximately the early modern period, and in Bengal perhaps as late as the early 19th century. Although not accepted by larger section of Hindu culture certain Tantric cults performed human sacrifice until around the same time, both actual and symbolic; it was a highly ritualised act, and on occasion took many months to complete. An occasional ritual murder, to Kali, periodically appears in the contemporary press.

The free or forced burning of widows, in a Vedic practise known as Sati, was noted during Alexander&#x27;s invasion, of 327 BCE. A practice that was codified during the Gupta empire, and later prohibited, in Bengal via Bengal Sati Regulation, 1829, later across India, the last explicit legislation, in India, being the Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987.

===Pacific===
In Ancient Hawaii, a luakini temple, or luakini heiau, was a Native Hawaiian sacred place where human and animal blood sacrifices were offered. &quot;Kauwa&quot;, the outcast or slave class, were often used as human sacrifices at the &quot;luakini heiau&quot;. They are believed to have been war captives, or the descendants of war captives. They were not the only sacrifices; law-breakers of all castes or defeated political opponents were also acceptable as victims. Rituals for the Hawaiian god Kūkaʻilimoku included human sacrifice, which was not part of the worship of other gods.

According to an 1817 account, in Tonga, a child was strangled to assist the recovery of a sick relation.

===Pre-Columbian Americas===

Some of the most famous forms of ancient human sacrifice were performed by various Pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas that included the sacrifice of prisoners as well as voluntary sacrifice. Friar Marcos de Niza (1539), writing of the Chichimecas, said that from time to time &quot;they of this valley cast lots whose luck (honour) it shall be to be sacrificed, and they make him great cheer, on whom the lot falls, and with great joy they lund him with flowers upon a bed prepared in the said ditch all full of flowers and sweet herbs, on which they lay him along, and lay great store of dry wood on both sides of him, and set it on fire on either part, and so he dies&quot; and &quot;that the victim took great pleasure&quot; in being sacrificed.

====North America====
The Mixtec players of the Mesoamerican ballgame were sacrificed when the game was used to resolve a dispute between cities. The rulers would play a game instead of going to battle. The losing ruler would be sacrificed. The ruler &quot;Eight Deer&quot;, who was considered a great ball player and who won several cities this way, was eventually sacrificed, because he attempted to go beyond lineage-governing practices, and to create an empire.

=====Maya=====

The Maya held the belief that cenotes or limestone sinkholes were portals to the underworld and sacrificed human beings and tossed them down the cenote to please the water god Chaac. The most notable example of this is the &quot;Sacred Cenote&quot; at Chichén Itzá. Extensive excavations have recovered the remains of 42 individuals, half of them under twenty years old.

Only in the Post-Classic era did this practice become as frequent as in central Mexico. In the Post-Classic period, the victims and the altar are represented as daubed in a hue now known as Maya blue, obtained from the añil plant and the clay mineral palygorskite.

=====Aztecs=====
The Aztecs were particularly noted for practicing human sacrifice on a large scale; an offering to Huitzilopochtli would be made to restore the blood he lost, as the sun was engaged in a daily battle. Human sacrifices would prevent the end of the world that could happen on each cycle of 52 years. In the 1487 re-consecration of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan some estimate that 80,400 prisoners were sacrificed though numbers are difficult to quantify, as all obtainable Aztec texts were destroyed by Christian missionaries during the period 1528–1548. The Aztec, also known as Mexica, periodically sacrificed children as it was believed that the rain god, Tlāloc, required the tears of children.

According to Ross Hassig, author of &quot;Aztec Warfare&quot;, &quot;between 10,000 and 80,400 people&quot; were sacrificed in the ceremony. The old reports of numbers sacrificed for special feasts have been described as &quot;unbelievably high&quot; by some authors and that on cautious reckoning, based on reliable evidence, the numbers could not have exceeded at most several hundred per year in Tenochtitlan. The real number of sacrificed victims during the 1487 consecration is unknown.
Michael Harner, in his 1997 article &quot;The Enigma of Aztec Sacrifice&quot;, estimates the number of persons sacrificed in central Mexico in the 15th century as high as 250,000 per year. Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl, a Mexica descendant and the author of &quot;Codex Ixtlilxochitl&quot;, claimed that one in five children of the Mexica subjects was killed annually. Victor Davis Hanson argues that an estimate by Carlos Zumárraga of 20,000 per annum is more plausible. Other scholars believe that, since the Aztecs always tried to intimidate their enemies, it is far more likely that they inflated the official number as a propaganda tool.

=====Mississippian Cultures=====

The peoples of what is now the Southeastern United States known as the Mississippian culture (800 to 1600 CE) have been suggested to have practiced human sacrifice, because some artifacts have been interpreted as depicting such acts. Mound 72 at Cahokia (the largest Mississippian site), located near modern St. Louis, Missouri, was found to have numerous pits filled with mass burials thought to have been retainer sacrifices. One of several similar pit burials had the remains of 53 young women who had been strangled and neatly arranged in two layers. Another pit held 39 men, women, and children who showed signs of dying a violent death before being unceremoniously dumped into the pit. Several bodies showed signs of not having been fully dead when buried and of having tried to claw their way to the surface. On top of these people another group had been neatly arranged on litters made of cedar poles and cane matting. Another group of four individuals found in the mound were interred on a low platform, with their arms interlocked. They had had their heads and hands removed. The most spectacular burial at the mound is the &quot;Birdman burial&quot;. This was the burial of a tall man in his 40s, now thought to have been an important early Cahokian ruler. He was buried on an elevated platform covered by a bed of more than 20,000 marine-shell disc beads arranged in the shape of a falcon, with the bird&#x27;s head appearing beneath and beside the man&#x27;s head, and its wings and tail beneath his arms and legs. Below the birdman was another man, buried facing downward. Surrounding the birdman were several other retainers and groups of elaborate grave goods.

A ritual sacrifice of retainers and commoners upon the death of an elite personage is also attested in the historical record among the last remaining fully Mississippian culture, the Natchez. Upon the death of &quot;Tattooed Serpent&quot; in 1725, the war chief and younger brother of the &quot;Great Sun&quot; or Chief of the Natchez; two of his wives, one of his sisters (nicknamed &quot;La Glorieuse&quot; by the French), his first warrior, his doctor, his head servant and the servant&#x27;s wife, his nurse, and a craftsman of war clubs all chose to die and be interred with him, as well as several old women and an infant who was strangled by his parents. Great honor was associated with such a sacrifice, and their kin were held in high esteem. After a funeral procession with the chief&#x27;s body carried on a litter made of cane matting and cedar poles ended at the temple (which was located on top of a low platform mound), the retainers, with their faces painted red and drugged with large doses of nicotine, were ritually strangled. Tattooed Serpent was then buried in a trench inside the temple floor and the retainers were buried in other locations atop the mound surrounding the temple. After a few months&#x27; time the bodies were dis-interred and their defleshed bones were stored as bundle burials in the temple.

=====Pawnee=====
The Pawnee may have occasionally conducted the Morning Star Ceremony, which included the sacrifice of a young girl. Though the ritual continued, the sacrifice was discontinued in the 19th century.

====South America====
The Incas practiced human sacrifice, especially at great festivals or royal funerals where retainers died to accompany the dead into the next life. The Moche sacrificed teenagers en masse, as archaeologist Steve Bourget found when he uncovered the bones of 42 male adolescents in 1995.

The study of the images seen in Moche art has enabled researchers to reconstruct the culture&#x27;s most important ceremonial sequence, which began with ritual combat and culminated in the sacrifice of those defeated in battle. Dressed in fine clothes and adornments, armed warriors faced each other in ritual combat. In this hand-to-hand encounter the aim was to remove the opponent&#x27;s headdress rather than kill him. The object of the combat was the provision of victims for sacrifice. The vanquished were stripped and bound, after which they were led in procession to the place of sacrifice. The captives are portrayed as strong and sexually potent. In the temple, the priests and priestesses would prepare the victims for sacrifice. The sacrificial methods employed varied, but at least one of the victims would be bled to death. His blood was offered to the principal deities in order to please and placate them.

The Inca of Peru also made human sacrifices. As many as 4,000 servants, court officials, favorites, and concubines were killed upon the death of the Inca Huayna Capac in 1527, for example. A number of mummies of sacrificed children have been recovered in the Inca regions of South America, an ancient practice known as &quot;qhapaq hucha&quot;. The Incas performed child sacrifices during or after important events, such as the death of the Sapa Inca (emperor) or during a famine.

==== West Africa ====
JuJu Human sacrifice is still covertly practiced in some parts of West Africa, though it is illegal in all West African countries. The Annual customs of Dahomey was the most notorious example, but sacrifices were carried out all along the West African coast and further inland. Sacrifices were particularly common after the death of a king or queen, and there are many recorded cases of hundreds or even thousands of slaves being sacrificed at such events. Sacrifices were particularly common in Dahomey, in what is now Benin, and in the small independent states in what is now southern Nigeria. According to Rudolph Rummel, &quot;Just consider the Grand Custom in Dahomey: When a ruler died, hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of prisoners would be slain. In one of these ceremonies in 1727, as many as 4,000 were reported killed. In addition, Dahomey had an Annual Custom during which 500 prisoners were sacrificed.&quot;

In the Ashanti Region of modern-day Ghana, human sacrifice was often combined with capital punishment.

The &quot;Leopard men&quot; were a West African secret society active into the mid-1900s that practised cannibalism. It was believed that the ritual cannibalism would strengthen both members of the society and their entire tribe. In Tanganyika, the &quot;Lion men&quot; committed an estimated 200 murders in a single three-month period.

==== Canary Islands ====
It has been reported from Spanish chronicles that the Guanches (ancient inhabitants of these islands) performed both animal and human sacrifices.

During the summer solstice in Tenerife children were sacrificed by being thrown from a cliff into the sea. These children were brought from various parts of the island for the purpose of sacrifice. Likewise, when an aboriginal king died his subjects should also assume the sea, along with the embalmers who embalmed the Guanche mummies.

In Gran Canaria, bones of children were found mixed with those of lambs and goat kids and on Tenerife, amphorae have been found with the remains of children inside. This suggests a different kind of ritual infanticide from those who were thrown off the cliffs.

==Prohibition in major religions==
===Greek polytheism===
In Greek polytheism, Tantalus was said to have been condemned to Tartarus for eternity for the human sacrifice of his son Pelops.

===Abrahamic religions===

Many traditions of Abrahamic religions such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam consider that God commanded Abraham to sacrifice his son to examine obedience of Abraham to His commands. To prove his obedience, Abraham intended to sacrifice his son. However, seeing Abraham&#x27;s resolve, God commanded Abraham to sacrifice a ram instead of his son.

====Judaism====
Judaism explicitly forbids human sacrifice, regarding it as murder. Jews view the &quot;Akedah&quot; as central to the abolition of human sacrifice. Some Talmudic scholars assert that its replacement is the sacrificial offering of animals at the Temple – using Exodus 13:2–12ff; 22:28ff; 34:19ff; Numeri 3:1ff; 18:15; Deuteronomy 15:19 – others view that as being superseded by the symbolic &quot;pars-pro-toto&quot; sacrifice of the covenant of circumcision. Leviticus 20:2 and Deuteronomy 18:10 specifically outlaw the giving of children to Moloch, making it punishable by stoning; the Tanakh subsequently denounces human sacrifice as barbaric customs of Moloch worshippers (e.g. Psalms 106:37ff).

Judges chapter 11 features a Judge named Jephthah vowing that &quot;whatsoever cometh forth from the doors of my house to meet me shall surely be the Lord&#x27;s, and I will offer it up as a burnt-offering&quot; in gratitude for God&#x27;s help with a military battle against the Ammonites. Much to Jephthah&#x27;s dismay, his only daughter greeted him upon his triumphant return. Judges 11:39 states that Jephthah did as he had vowed, but &quot;shies away from explicitly depicting her sacrifice, which leads some ancient and modern interpreters (e.g., Radak) to suggest that she was not actually killed.&quot;

According to the Mishnah he was under no obligation to keep the ill-phrased, illegal vow. According to Rabbi Jochanan, in his commentary on the Mishnah, it was Jephthah&#x27;s obligation to pay the vow in money. According to some commentators of the rabbinic Jewish tradition during the Middle Ages, Jepthah&#x27;s daughter was not sacrificed, but was forbidden to marry and remained a spinster her entire life.

The 1st-century CE Jewish-Hellenistic historian Flavius Josephus, however, stated that Jephthah &quot;sacrificed his child as a burnt-offering – a sacrifice neither sanctioned by the law nor well-pleasing to God; for he had not by reflection probed what might befall or in what aspect the deed would appear to them that heard of it&quot;. Latin philosopher pseudo-Philo, late wrote that Jephthah burnt his daughter because he could find no sage in Israel who would cancel his vow. In other words, in the opinion of the Latin philosopher, this story of an ill-phrased vow consolidates that human sacrifice is not an order or requirement by God, but the punishment for those who illegally vowed to sacrifice humans.

Allegations accusing Jews of committing ritual murder – called the &quot;blood libel&quot; – were widespread during the Middle Ages, often leading to the slaughter of entire Jewish communities. In the 20th century, similar accusations of ritual child killing by non-Christians were made as part of the satanic ritual abuse moral panic.

====Christianity====
Christianity developed the belief that the story of Isaac&#x27;s binding was a foreshadowing of the sacrifice of Christ, whose death and resurrection are believed to have enabled the salvation and atonement for man from its sins, including original sin. There is a tradition that the site of Isaac&#x27;s binding, Moriah, later became Jerusalem, the city of Jesus&#x27;s future crucifixion. The beliefs of many Christian denominations hinge upon the substitutionary atonement of the sacrifice of God the Son, which was necessary for salvation in the afterlife. According to Christian teaching, each individual person on earth must participate in, and / or receive the benefits of, this divine human sacrifice for the atonement of their sins. Early Christian sources explicitly described this event as a sacrificial offering, with Christ in the role of both priest and human sacrifice, although starting with the Enlightenment, some writers, such as John Locke, have disputed the model of Jesus&#x27; death as a propitiatory sacrifice.

Although early Christians in the Roman Empire were accused of being cannibals, &quot;theophages&quot; (Greek for &quot;god eaters&quot;) practices such as human sacrifice were abhorrent to them. Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Christians believe that this &quot;pure sacrifice&quot; as Christ&#x27;s self-giving in love is made present in the sacrament of the Eucharist. In this tradition, bread and wine becomes the &quot;real presence&quot; (the literal carnal Body and Blood of the Risen Christ). Receiving the Eucharist is a central part of the religious life of Catholic and Orthodox Christians. Most Protestant traditions do not share the belief in the real presence but otherwise are varied, for example, they may believe that in the bread and wine, Christ is present only spiritually, not in the sense of a change in substance (Methodism) or that the bread and wine of communion are a merely symbolic reminder (Baptist).

In medieval Irish Catholic texts, there is mention of the early church in Ireland supposedly containing the practice of burying sacrificial victims underneath churches in order to consecrate them. This may have a relation to pagan Celtic practices of foundation sacrifice. The most notable example of this is the case of Odran of Iona a companion of St Columba who (according to legend) volunteered to die and be buried under the church of the monastery of Iona. However, there is no evidence that such things ever happened in reality and contemporary records closer to the time period have no mention of a practice like this.

==== Islam ====
Islam considers human sacrifice to be repugnant to the &quot;true religion&quot;. It is also described as a common practice in pre-Islamic civilization, from Greece to Arabia. The binding of Prophet Ismaeel story is interpreted as Allah showing the superiority of animal sacrifices over human sacrifices.

===Indian religions===

Many Indian religions, including Buddhism, Jainism and some sects of Hinduism, embrace the teaching of &quot;ahimsa&quot; (non-violence) which imposes vegetarianism and outlaws animal as well as human sacrifice.
====Buddhism====
In the case of Buddhism, both &quot;bhikkhus&quot; (monks) and &quot;bhikkhunis&quot; (nuns) were forbidden to take life in any form as part of the monastic code, while non-violence was promoted among laity through encouragement of the Five Precepts. Across the Buddhist world both meat and alcohol are strongly discouraged as offerings to a Buddhist altar, with the former being synonymous with sacrifice, and the latter a violation of the Five Precepts.

In their effort to discredit Tibetan Buddhism, the People&#x27;s Republic of China as well as Chinese nationalists in the Republic of China make frequent and emphatic references to the historical practice of human sacrifice in Tibet, portraying the 1950 People&#x27;s Liberation Army invasion of Tibet as an act of humanitarian intervention.
According to Chinese sources, in the year 1948, 21 individuals were murdered by state sacrificial priests from Lhasa as part of a ritual of enemy destruction, because their organs were required as magical ingredients.
The &quot;Tibetan Revolutions Museum&quot; established by the Chinese in Lhasa has numerous morbid ritual objects on display to illustrate these claims.

====Hinduism====
In many sects of Hinduism, based on the principle of &quot;ahimsa&quot;, any human or animal sacrifice is forbidden. In the 19th and 20th centuries, prominent figures of Indian spirituality such as Swami Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi, The importance of ahimsa has been emphasised by Swami Sivananda, and A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.

==Modern cases==
=== The Americas ===

==== Brazil ====
In the city of Altamira, State of Pará, several children were raped, with their genitalia mutilated for what appear to be ritual purposes, and then stabbed to death, between 1989 and 1993. It is believed that the boys&#x27; sexual organs were used in rites of black magic.

==== Chile ====
In the coastal village Collileufu, native Lafkenches carried out a ritual human sacrifice in the days following the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. Collileufu, located in the Budi Lake area, south of Puerto Saavedra, was highly isolated in 1960. The Mapuche spoke primarily Mapudungun. The community had gathered in Cerro La Mesa, while the lowlands were struck by successive tsunamis. Juana Namuncura Añen, a local machi, demanded the sacrifice of the grandson of Juan Painecur, a neighbor, in order to calm the earth and the ocean. The victim was 5 year-old José Luis Painecur, &quot;called&quot; an &quot;orphan&quot; (&quot;huacho&quot;) because his mother had gone to Santiago, for employment as a domestic worker, and left her son under the care of her father.

José Luis Painecur had his arms and legs removed by Juan Pañán and Juan José Painecur (the victim&#x27;s grandfather), and was stuck into the sand of the beach like a stake. The waters of the Pacific Ocean then carried the body out to sea. The authorities only learned about the sacrifice after a boy in the commune of Nueva Imperial denounced to local leaders the theft of two horses; these were allegedly eaten during the sacrifice ritual. The two men were charged with the crime and confessed, but later recanted. They were released after two years. A judge ruled that those involved in these events had &quot;acted without free will, driven by an irresistible natural force of ancestral tradition.&quot; The story was mentioned in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article, although with meagre detail.

==== Mexico ====

During the 1980s, a case of serial murders that involved human sacrifices rituals occurred in Tamaulipas, Mexico. The drug dealer and cult leader Adolfo Constanzo orchestrated several executions during rituals that included the victims&#x27; dismemberment.

Between 2009 and 2010, in Sonora, Mexico, a serial killer named Silvia Meraz committed three murders in sacrifice rituals. With the help of her family, she beheaded two boys (both relatives) and one woman in front of an altar dedicated to Santa Muerte.

==== Panama ====
The &quot;New Light Of God&quot; sect in the town of El Terrón, Ngäbe-Buglé Comarca, Panama, believed they had a mandate from God to sacrifice members of their community who failed to repent to their satisfaction. In 2020, 5 children, their pregnant mother, and a neighbor were killed and decapitated at the sect&#x27;s church building, with 14 other wounded victims being rescued. Victims were hacked with machetes, beaten with Bibles and cudgels, and burned with embers. A goat was ritually sacrificed at the scene as well. The cult&#x27;s beliefs were a syncretic blend of Pentecostalism with indigenous beliefs and some New Age ideas including emphasis on the third eye. A leader of the Ngäbe-Buglé region labeled the sect &quot;satanic&quot; and demanded its eradication.

===Asia===

====India====
Several incidents of human sacrifice have been reported in India since independence. In 1996, a nine-year-old boy was sacrificed by Jharkhand-native Sushil Murmu as an offering to goddess Kali. Murmu was sentenced to death by the court but later got commuted to life imprisonment by the president of India. According to the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, there was an incident of human sacrifice in western Uttar Pradesh in 2003. Police in Khurja reported &quot;dozens of sacrifices&quot; in the period of half a year in 2006, by followers of Kali, the goddess of death and time. In 2010, a two-year-old boy was murdered in Chhattisgarh in a Tantric human sacrifice.

According to the National Crime Records Bureau, more than 100 cases of human sacrifices have been reported in India between 2014 and 2021. In 2015, during the Granite scam investigations of Tamil Nadu, there were reports of possible human sacrifices in the Madurai area to pacify goddess Shakthi for getting power to develop the illegal granite business. Bones and skulls were retrieved from the alleged sites in presence of the special judicial officer appointed by the high court of Madras.

Between June and October 2022, two women were killed and reportedly cannibalised as part of a human sacrifice in Elanthoor in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala. In October 2022, a six-year-old boy was killed in Delhi by two men to please a deity. In 2023, five men were arrested for the killing and decapitation of a woman with a machete in 2019, as part of a religious rite to mark the anniversary of the ringleader&#x27;s brother&#x27;s death, after visiting a Hindu temple in Guwahati.

===Africa===
Human sacrifice is no longer legal in any country, and such cases are prosecuted. As of 2020 however, there is still black market demand for child abduction in countries such as Kenya for purposes which include human sacrifice.

In January 2008, Milton Blahyi of Liberia confessed to being part of human sacrifices which &quot;included the killing of an innocent child and plucking out the heart, which was divided into pieces for us to eat.&quot; He fought against Charles Taylor&#x27;s militia.

In 2019, an Anti-balaka leader in Satema in Central African Republic killed a 14-year-old girl in ritualistic way to increase profit from mines.

On 22 March 2014, a group of motorcycle taxi drivers discovered the Ibadan forest of horror, a dilapidated building believed to have been used for human trafficking and ritual sacrifice located in Soka forest in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria.

==Ritual murder==

Ritual killings perpetrated by individuals or small groups within a society that denounces them as simple murder are difficult to classify as either &quot;human sacrifice&quot; or mere pathological homicide because they lack the societal integration of sacrifice proper.

The Satanic groups Order of Nine Angles and the Temple of the Black Light promote human sacrifice. During the Satanic Panic some conspiracy theorists falsely claimed there were more than a million human sacrifices in the United States.

==Non-lethal &quot;sacrifice&quot;==
In India there is a festival (Seega Maramma) where a person is chosen as a &quot;sacrifice&quot;, and is believed by participants to die during the ritual, although they actually remain alive and are &quot;raised&quot; from the dead at the end after a period of lying still. Thus, this does not have the same legal implications as a true human sacrifice although participants consider it to be one.

<text>Real Club Recreativo de Huelva, S.A.D. () is a Spanish football club based in Huelva, Andalucia, Spain. Founded on 23 December 1889, they are the oldest football club in Spain, and currently play in , holding home games at &quot;Estadio Nuevo Colombino&quot;, which has a 21,670 seating-capacity.

Team colours are white shirts with blue vertical stripes and white shorts.

==History==
===Background===
Huelva was introduced to football by the British employees of the Rio Tinto Company Limited (RTCL), who began to arrive in 1873 to work at the copper mines of Rio Tinto. Huelva thus became the home to a vast British colony, among whom a certain William Bice stood out, as he was the one who began organizing the first &quot;kick-abouts&quot; between the club&#x27;s members, which were possibly the very first kick to a football ball on Spanish soil. This colony eventually gave birth to a club in 1878, the Rio Tinto English Club (known in Huelva as &quot;Club Inglés Bella Vista&quot;), where the mine workers played their favorite sports, such as cricket, rugby, and football. The first president of this club was the Scot John Sutherland Mackay, the newly-arrived company doctor. There are reports of football games between Rio Tinto and Huelva as early as 1882, but these teams were never officially established, so there is no legal record of their existence.

Rio Tinto FC was the catalyst of the &quot;Sociedad de Juego de Pelota&quot; (), which was founded in 1884 by Dr. William Alexander Mackay, the brother of John Sutherland, who was a lover of sports and thus wanted to use physical exercise to improve the health of his patients. He began organizing football and cricket games, usually between his compatriots living in Riotinto and those crews of the British ships, which were held in a large area of marshes filled with flooded soil opposite the Gas Factory run by fellow Scotsman Charles Wilson Adam, who also played in some cricket matches himself.

The earliest known example of this dates dating to March 1888, when the club played football and cricket matches against the sailors of a merchant ship called &quot;Jane Cory&quot; who had just arrived in port; Mackay even invited a Spaniard Ildefonso Martínez to play. Eventually, in the late 1880s, the local population began gathering there to watch this curious sport, which soon gained followers among the local youth, and as they became familiar with its rules, some of them asked Mackay to participate, which he happily accepted, as he did not conceive of his recreational club as something exclusive to the British colony. Ildefonso Martínez, José García Almansa, Alfonso Le Bourg, and some others, thus became the first Spaniards to play football.

===Foundation and first matches===
After a few years of consolidating these sports practices, Mackay and Adam decided to take a further step, so on 18 December 1889, they were among the seven men who founded &quot;Huelva Recreation Club&quot;, thus becoming the first-ever football club in Spain, although it was originally founded as a sports club that provided physical recreation for the Rio Tinto mineworkers to improve their health. The remaining five founding members were Edward Palin, Alfred Gough, Gavin Speirs, and the only two Spaniards: Pedro Nolasco de Soto and José Muñoz Pérez, both of whom had studied in Britain and thus had a great knowledge of the English language, with Nolasco having previous experience as a director of a sailing club, while Muñoz had a position within the local press. Even though Mackay was the fundamental head behind the club&#x27;s creation, it was Adam who was elected as the club&#x27;s first-ever president since he was the eldest of the group and owner of the land where the games were played. This position was then ratified as such at the meeting of 23 December 1889, in which four more members were added for a total of 11; the 27-year-old Speirs, an engineer, was named vice-president, and Palin was named secretary, while Mackay was appointed only as a member of the club&#x27;s first board of directors.
After Recreativo de Huelva, Sevilla FC is the next-oldest club in Spain, having been founded just a month later, on 25 January 1890, by Isaias White and Edward Farquharson Johnston, the British vice-consul of Seville, and unlike the Huelva clubs, Sevilla was solely devoted to football, so many considered Spain&#x27;s first football club. Two months later, on 8 March 1890, these two clubs played the first official football match in Spain at the Hipódromo de Tablada, which was refereed by Johnston, the president of Sevilla, who won the match 2–0; Huelva line-up the following players: William Alcock, Yates, George Wakelin, Guillermo Duclós, Coto, Kirk, Benito Daniel, Curtis, Gibbon, Geraldo Brady, and Smith.

Following the success of the first match, the clubs decided to play a return fixture in Huelva just three weeks later, on 7 April 1890, in front of a crowd of 500, and even though Sevilla scored the opening goal via Gilbert Pollock, thus becoming the first-ever player to score an away goal on Spanish soil, Huelva managed to fight back to win 2–1, partly because they had been fortified by &quot;some athletes from the British colony of Rio-Tinto&quot;.

===1890s===

The &quot;Recreation Club&quot; demonstrated an organizational capacity that was out of the ordinary for a sports club of that time, playing many more matches against Sevilla and the &quot;Club de Río Tinto&quot; in the early 1890s, fielding the likes of Wakelin, Alcock, James Reeves, and captain Almansa, who scored a late winner against Sevilla in February 1892. In 1892, Mackay created the club&#x27;s first crest, the blue and white heart, because those were the colors of the Mackay clan crest, the flags of Scotland and Huelva, and even Lybster FC, his hometown club.

In that same year, Mackay and Adam formed the club&#x27;s subcommittee charged with planning and supervising the works of the so-called &quot;Campo del Velódromo&quot; on the plot of land located on the Seville road opposite the &quot;Hotel Colon&quot;, which was the first sports venue built in Spain for the practice of football, and which was inaugurated on 20 August, just in time to host the sporting events that had been organized by Recreativo in commemoration of the IV Centenary of the Discovery of America. After the departure of Edward Palin in 1891, Muñoz became the new secretary of the club, and as such, he played a key role in the organization of this event that took place between August and October 1892, and whose program remains the oldest surviving original document from Recreativo, in which the club has specific and established rules for football, cricket, and tennis games, hence making them the oldest rules that had been created in Spain in relation to the practice of football.

Charles Adam held the club&#x27;s presidency from its foundation on 18 December 1889 until his resignation on 29 November 1896, being replaced by Mackay, who, in turn, held this position for nearly three decades until 1924, except for a brief period in 1903. In March 1915 it was William Alexander Mackay himself who hand-delivered to the Minister of the Interior the letter requesting the King Alfonso VIII to accept the Honorary Presidency of the Club, and since then Recreativo has been Royal.

===First cups===

In 1891, most of the founders and promoters of Recreativo, including Adam, founded an organization called &quot;Seamen&#x27;s Institute&quot;, which was meant to provide shelter, entertainment, and company to the English sailors who anchored their ships at the port of Huelva for relatively long periods while they waited for the mineral and finished loading it onto the ships. In 1903, after many years as secretary, Muñoz became the vice-president of Recreativo, and later that year, his proposal to create an annual football tournament between Recreativo and the British sailors of the Seamen&#x27;s Institute was approved at the board meeting held on 9 December 1903. Muñoz decided to follow the footsteps of the Copa del Rey, which had been inaugurated earlier that year with a cup donated by Alfonso XIII, and also ordered a cup made of silver in London, with the first match taking place on 2 January 1904, and being won by the British. This was followed by another match on 30 April, which was postponed to 6 November to coincide with the inauguration of the new facilities at the Velodrome, but the British won again 4–2. It was only two weeks later, on 20 November, that Recreativo finally won this cup, and despite some indications that the club had lifted the &quot;Copa de la Raza&quot; in 1893 and the &quot;Copa Heráldica&quot; in 1898, it can be reliably and based on strict documentary evidence that the &quot;Copa Seamen&#x27;s Institute&quot; was the first time that a captain of Recreativo lifted a trophy; it was William Alcock, near the Anglican Chapel of the &quot;Seamen&#x27;s Institute&quot;.

After declining invitations in previous years due to financial problems, Recreativo decided to participate in the 1906 edition of the Copa del Rey, playing two matches at the &quot;Hipódromo de la Castellana&quot; against Athletic Club and Madrid FC (currently known as Athletic Bilbao and Madrid FC), both ending in losses. The Huelva squad that played in this tournament included the likes of Antonio Tellechea, Tomás Estrada, Robert Geoghegham, and William Waterston.

On 1 January 1911, Recreativo achieved its third consecutive victory over the Seamen&#x27;s (12–0), and in doing so, the &quot;Copa Muñoz&quot; became the definitive property of Huelva, and it still is the oldest trophy kept by Recreativo in its museum. Muñoz held the club&#x27;s vice-presidency for three years, until 1906, when he was replaced by the Spaniard Manuel Pérez de Guzmán, whose six sons all played for the club between 1903 and 1920. In the first half of the 1910s, two of the Pérez de Guzmán brothers (Manuel and José), along with Tomás Estrada, played a crucial role in helping the team win three non-official Andalusian regional championships, which Recreativo itself organized, and the &quot;Copa Centenario de las Cortes de Cádiz&quot; in 1912, beating Español de Cádiz 3–0 in the final. During this period, Estrada was everything at Recreativo: player, captain, referee, and manager, and also correspondent in Huelva for the weekly &quot;Madrid Sport&quot;.

Huelva also became the first Spanish side to defeat a Portuguese team, winning against Sporting Clube de Portugal. In 1940, it first reached &quot;Segunda División&quot;, only lasting however one year and not returning until 1957. Since 1965, the team also began hosting the &quot;Trofeo Colombino&quot;.

===Later years===
In 1977–78, led by, amongst others, former Real Madrid youth graduate Hipólito Rincón, Recreativo first gained promotion to the top flight. After just one season, it returned to level two, staying there until 1990, the year of a &quot;Segunda División B&quot; relegation.

In 1999–2000, Recreativo were due to be relegated to the third division, but were redeemed when Atlético Madrid descended into the second and thus their reserves were ejected. With a new stadium and the appointment of Luis Alcaraz as manager, and the club returned to the top flight for the first time in 23 years on 19 May 2002 with a 2–1 home win over fellow Andalusians Xerez CD. After this one season at the top, the team was immediately relegated back. However, in the same campaign, it reached the final of the Copa del Rey for the first time, being defeated by Mallorca 0–3 in Elche.

In 2005–06, after beating Numancia on 4 June 2006, Marcelino García Toral&#x27;s Recreativo mathematically secured promotion with two matches left to be played. Ahead of the new season, the club bought players including France youth international striker Florent Sinama Pongolle from Liverpool, and young winger Santi Cazorla from Villarreal CF, with a budget of only €15 million. The club finished eighth in the table, at 54 points, a best-ever, and made headlines with a 3–0 win against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. The club&#x27;s leading goalscorer was Sinama Pongolle with 12 goals to his name, while García Toral left at its conclusion for Racing de Santander.

&quot;Recre&quot; narrowly avoided relegation the following season, and in 2008–09, one win in its last 15 matches led to it coming in last place and returning to &quot;Segunda&quot; after three years. Overspending in aim of returning to the top flight led to debts. At the end of the 2014–15 season, the team fell into Segunda B for the first time in 18 years. A year later, the club was nearing extinction due to financial problems. In May 2021, due to restructuring of the Spanish football league system, the club was relegated two tiers to the fifth level for the first time in its history. Journalist Damián Ortiz of the &quot;Diario de Huelva&quot; called the entire squad &quot;bastards without honour&quot; and &quot;a black mark on the history of Recreativo de Huelva&quot;. In April 2022, &quot;Recre&quot; achieved promoted back to fourth division. In June 2023, &quot;Recre&quot; achieved second consecutive promoted to third division after beating Cacereño in last playoff.

<doc id="80334" wikidata="Q1019517" url="?curid=80334" title="Bezique">
<text>Bezique () or bésigue () is a 19th-century French melding and trick-taking card game for two players, which was imported to Britain and is still played today. The game is derived from piquet, possibly via marriage (sixty-six) and briscan, with additional scoring features, notably the peculiar liaison of the and that is also a feature of pinochle, Binokel, and similarly named games that vary by country.

==History==
An early theory that appeared in the 1864 edition of &quot;The American Hoyle&quot; was that bezique originated in Sweden as the result of a royal competition. This much repeated, but unsubstantiated, tale is recounted thus:

What is known is that the first rules – for a game played with a single pack of 32 cards – appeared in Paris in 1847 where Méry described it as a new game. Another early theory was that bezique was developed in France from piquet and that the word &quot;bezique&quot;, formerly &quot;bésique&quot; or &quot;bésigue&quot;, was known in France in the 17th century, coming probably from the Italian card game bazzica. However, more recently, French historians have traced the origins of bezique to a game called &quot;bezi&quot; or &quot;bezit&quot; which descended through a form of single bezique also known as cinq cents or binage to early modern bezique. This appears to be corroborated by Anton (1879) who tells us that &quot;Besigue&quot; originally came from the regions of Angouleme, Poitou, and Saintonge on France&#x27;s Atlantic coast where it was called &quot;besit&quot;.

The word &quot;bezique&quot; once meant &quot;correspondence&quot; or &quot;association&quot;. In English-speaking nations, Binocles, meaning eyeglasses with this pronunciation, became the name for Bezique with minor rule variations, ultimately evolving into Pinochle. Two-handed Pinochle, two-handed bezique and two-handed binokel are almost identical, the main difference is that the last-named is played with two packs of 24, German-suited, cards, instead of two packs of 32, French-suited, ones. The former, together with six-pack bezique and Rubicon bezique, is still played in the United States.

The game achieved its greatest popularity in Paris by 1860 and had reached England by 1861. Perhaps the most famous proponent of the game was Winston Churchill, an avid player and early expert of six-pack, or &quot;Chinese&quot; bezique. There is some evidence that the English writers Wilkie Collins and Christina Rossetti were also enthusiasts. However, since the late nineteenth century the game has declined in popularity.

Although the original 1847 game was played with a single piquet pack of 32 cards, the rules already suggested that the game might be played with two packs which would double the number of available points. and, by no later than 1864 in the US, the standard two-hand game had evolved to use two or even three euchre packs (also 32 cards).}

==Overview==
A two-handed bezique pack is a 64-card pack, consisting of the ace down to the seven of each suit doubled (i.e. the twos to sixes are stripped from two packs and the remaining cards combined), The players cut for deal, with the highest card having preference. The rank of the cards in cutting, and in play, is , , , , , , and . Eight cards are dealt in batches of three, two and three, to each player with the next card being placed face up between the two players to establish the trump suit. The remaining cards, known as the &quot;talon&quot; or &quot;stock&quot;, are placed face down beside it. Should the turn-up card be a the dealer scores ten.

The non-dealer leads any card from hand and the dealer may then play any card. The normal requirement to follow suit if possible does not apply to bezique. If a second player chooses to play a higher card of the same suit or any trump, that player wins the trick. If the two cards of the same rank are played, the trick belongs to the first player. Once played, tricks are placed face down by the player who wins each trick. The holder of the trump is entitled to exchange it for the turn-up card at any time when &quot;on lead&quot;, scoring 10 points. The holder of the duplicate trump also scores 10 when it is played.

The winner of each trick declares one meld face up on the table and scores points for it, takes a card from the top of the stock and then leads to the next trick. The other player draws the second card from the stock but may not declare a meld. The game proceeds until the stock is exhausted, at which point 8 more tricks are played to exhaust the players&#x27; hands. Finally, brisques are scored. The game is usually played as first to 1000 points.

===Points for melds and brisques===


===Further notes on scoring===
In order to score for a meld, the cards comprising the given combination must all be in hand at the same time; thus cards played to previous tricks may not be included in melds. However, cards already declared may be used for other melds of a different type as long as the point score is greater, for example four kings may be declared using a king previously declared for a marriage. A marriage can not be later declared using a king previously declared in a meld of four kings as the point score is less.

A card played to a trick is no longer available for game play. It is taken by the winner of the trick and placed face down on a separate pile. At the game&#x27;s conclusion, each player counts the number of brisques (aces and tens) they have won in tricks. Each is worth ten points.

A player can declare a meld only after winning a trick. The winner of each trick is entitled to score one meld, or several melds, depending on local rules, laying the cards forming it face upwards on the table. If the cards exposed show two combinations, both may be declared but only one may be scored until another trick is won. Thus, having scores 40 for bezique with another 20 to score after the next trick is won.

Once a card has been melded it cannot be used again in the same combination, but it may be used for a different type of meld, that is, , once married, cannot be married to the other , but it may be used as part of four queens and as part of a sequence if it is of the trump suit. Also a card which has been declared may not be declared again in a combination of an inferior order, i.e., if a king and queen have been declared as part of a sequence, they may not be used subsequently in a marriage, though the reverse is allowable.

The declared cards, left face upwards on the table, still form part of the hand, and are played to subsequent tricks at the discretion of the holder. When no more cards are left in the stock, the method of play alters. No further declarations may be made and the only additional score now possible is for brisques in the remaining tricks, scored by the winner of the trick.

The mode of play for these last eight tricks is according to normal whist rules in that each player must now follow suit if possible, with the additional constraint that they must win the trick if possible, by playing a higher card or by ruffing.

==Step-by-step guide to the game (two-player version)==

Bezique is not generally perceived to be a difficult game, though remembering the possible meld combinations and scoring can be confusing for the complete novice. There are also a number of small rules, such as the high ranking of cards with a face value of ten, the ability to swap sevens with the trump card and so on, that beginners should keep in mind.

Once the general pattern of playing a trick, declaring a meld (if any) and then drawing a new card from the talon is established in the mind, the player should then focus on tactics.

===Preparing to play===
Required are two packs of cards and a sheet of paper and pen to collate scores. Special bezique markers were made at the height of the game&#x27;s popularity but mostly these are rare now.

* Take the packs of cards and remove all cards with a value below seven, along with the jokers or wildcards. Remaining should be the cards with the numerical values of seven through to ten, the face cards and the aces.
* Shuffle the two packs together.
* A cut is made. The player with the highest valued card is given the privilege of dealing.
* In both the cut and the game player, the value of the cards from highest to lowest is as follows:

===The deal===
The dealing sequence is as follows:

Deal three cards to the opponent, three cards to the self, two cards to the opponent, two cards to the self, three cards to the opponent once more and finally, three more cards to the self. (In other words, it is in a pattern of 3, 2, 3.)

The remaining cards are placed in a stack or talon in the middle of the table. The top card from the talon is turned over and placed face up alongside the talon. This card designates what the trump suit will be. If the dealer turns over the seven as the trump card, ten points are awarded. This card is available to be swapped by any player who wins a trick and holds the 7 of trumps (which replaces it as the face up card). The face up card (whether it is the original or a 7 of trumps) is the last to be taken (by the loser of the trick just played) at the end of the first phase of play.

In a variation of the game, if a player finds no face card in his hand (, , , or ), a &quot;carte blanche&quot; may be declared which receives 50 points from the opponent. All cards must be shown to the opponent to claim these points. This is not a standard rule of two-player bezique but is allowed in some regions.

===The play (phase one)===
The non-dealer may lead any card. This card is placed face upwards on the table. The dealer must respond by playing a card. If it is a card of the same suit but has a higher value or any card of the trump suit and the leading card is not of the trump suit, it wins the trick. If it is a lower or equal card of the same suit or a card of any other suit bar the trump suit, it loses.

Whoever wins the trick takes the cards and places them in a separate pile. These cards play no further part in the round. They are only used for scoring brisques

Note that there is no obligation to follow suit or to trump in this part of the game.

The only time a player would have a strong motivation to win the trick is when there are aces or tens being played or the player has a meld they wish to declare.

The winner of the trick has an opportunity to present a meld by declaring his combination and placing them face upwards on the table. They are still part of his hand but must remain on the table in view of the opponent until played in later tricks.

Only one meld can be declared per trick won. Scores for these are written immediately. The list of melds and their scores are listed in the table above.

Note that a card used in one meld cannot be played in the same meld later on. For example, married to cannot later be married to the second . However, it can be used for a sequence of four kings as this is a different meld. Were both the other king and queen of clubs to be presented, the first king and queen could be part of the marriage.

A special meld declaration involves the seven of trumps. It is not placed on the table with the others. Instead, it can be swapped for the upturned trump card. The second seven of trumps can also be declared in this way.

The winner of the trick draws from the talon once they have declared their meld. The loser then also draws a card from the talon, thus maintaining eight cards in their hand at all times at this stage of the game. If no melds are declared by the winner of the trick, the cards are drawn immediately.

Whoever wins the trick then leads first in playing the next trick.

===The play (phase two)===
Once the talon is exhausted, the game play changes somewhat in nature.

The winner of the final trick draws the last card from the talon, whilst the loser takes the upturned trump card. The final eight tricks are played in this way:

* From now on, the player must follow suit and play a higher card than the leader if they can. If they cannot follow suit, they must trump to win the trick. If they cannot follow suit or trump, they can only then play any other card.
* Melds cannot be declared in this part of the game.
* The winner of the final trick is granted ten bonus points.

===Counting the brisques===
After the last trick is played, each player gathers the cards they have won and counts the number of aces and tens. Each of these is worth ten points. This number is added to the total score already earned from the various melds the player has declared.

Traditionally, the first player to reach 1,000 points wins, which normally involves an average of three to four rounds being played. However, a different target figure may be agreed upon before play begins, such as the first person to reach 2,000 points.

===Penalties===
*A player holding more than eight cards awards 100 points to their opponent.

*A player not drawing a card after a trick in phase one awards 10 points to their opponent.

*A player not winning a trick or following suit where it was possible in phase two concedes all remaining brisques to their opponent.

Her early period roles saw her typecast as a virginal &quot;English rose&quot;, a label with which she was uncomfortable.

For her role as Kate Croy in &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; (1997), Bonham Carter received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth in &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; (2010), she won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

For her role as children&#x27;s author Enid Blyton in the BBC Four biographical film &quot;Enid&quot; (2009), she won the 2010 International Emmy Award for Best Actress and was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. Her other television films include &quot;Fatal Deception: Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald&quot; (1993), &quot;Live from Baghdad&quot; (2002), &quot;Toast&quot; (2010), and &quot;Burton &amp; Taylor&quot; (2013).

==Ancestry==

===Paternal===

Bonham Carter&#x27;s paternal grandparents were British Liberal politicians Sir Maurice Bonham-Carter and Lady Violet Bonham Carter. Helena is descended on her father&#x27;s side from John Bonham Carter, Member of Parliament for Portsmouth. Helena&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather was H. H. Asquith, 1st Earl of Oxford and Asquith and Prime Minister of Britain 1908–1916. She is the great-niece of Asquith&#x27;s son, Anthony Asquith, English director of such films as &quot;Carrington V.C.&quot; and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, and a first cousin of the economist Adam Ridley and of politician Jane Bonham Carter.

Bonham Carter is a distant cousin of actor Crispin Bonham-Carter. Her other prominent distant relatives include Lothian Bonham Carter, who played first-class cricket for Hampshire, his son, Vice Admiral Sir Stuart Bonham Carter, who served in the Royal Navy in both world wars, and pioneering English nurse Florence Nightingale.

===Maternal===

Her maternal grandfather, Spanish diplomat Eduardo Propper de Callejón, saved thousands of Jews from the Holocaust during the Second World War, for which he was recognised as Righteous Among the Nations, and posthumously received the Courage to Care Award from the Anti-Defamation League. His own father was a Bohemian Jew, and his wife, Helena&#x27;s grandmother, was a Jewish convert to Catholicism. He later served as Minister-Counselor at the Spanish Embassy in Washington, D.C.

Her maternal grandmother, Baroness Hélène Fould-Springer, was from an upper-class Jewish family; she was the daughter of Baron Eugène Fould-Springer (a French banker descended from the Ephrussi family and the Fould dynasty) and Marie-Cécile von Springer (whose father was Austrian-born industrialist Baron Gustav von Springer, and whose mother was from the de Koenigswarter family). Hélène Fould-Springer converted to Catholicism after the Second World War. Hélène&#x27;s sister was the French philanthropist Liliane de Rothschild (1916–2003), the wife of Baron Élie de Rothschild, of the prominent Rothschild family (who had also married within the von Springer family in the 19th century); Liliane&#x27;s other sister, Therese Fould-Springer, was the mother of British writer David Pryce-Jones.

==Early life and education==
Bonham Carter was born in Islington, London. Her father, Raymond Bonham Carter, who came from a prominent British political family, was a merchant banker and served as the alternative British director representing the Bank of England at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, DC, during the 1960s. Her mother, Elena (née Propper de Callejón), is a psychotherapist who is of Spanish and mostly Bohemian and French-Jewish background, and whose parents were diplomat Eduardo Propper de Callejón from Spain and painter Baroness Hélène Fould-Springer. Bonham Carter&#x27;s paternal grandmother was politician and feminist Violet Bonham Carter, daughter of H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during the first half of the First World War.

Bonham Carter has two older brothers; Edward and Thomas. They were brought up in Golders Green, and she was educated at South Hampstead High School, and completed her A-levels at Westminster School. Bonham Carter applied to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, but was rejected &quot;because officials were afraid that she would leave mid-term to pursue an acting career.&quot;

When Bonham Carter was five, her mother had a serious nervous breakdown, from which she needed three years to recover. Soon afterwards, her mother&#x27;s experience in therapy led her to become a psychotherapist herself. Bonham Carter has since paid her to read her scripts and deliver opinions on the characters&#x27; psychological motivations. Five years after her mother&#x27;s recovery, her father was diagnosed with acoustic neuroma. He suffered complications during an operation to remove the tumour, which led to a stroke, leaving him half-paralysed and using a wheelchair. With her brothers at college, Bonham Carter was left to help her mother cope. She later studied her father&#x27;s movements and mannerisms for her role in &quot;The Theory of Flight&quot;. He died in January 2004.

==Career==
===Early work and breakthrough (1980s–1990s)===
Bonham Carter, who has had no formal acting training, entered the field winning a national writing contest in 1979, and used the money to pay for her entry into the actors&#x27; &quot;Spotlight&quot; directory. She made her professional acting debut at the age of 16 in a television commercial. She also had a minor part in the 1983 TV film &quot;A Pattern of Roses&quot;.

Bonham Carter&#x27;s first lead film role was as Lady Jane Grey in &quot;Lady Jane&quot; (1986), which was given mixed reviews by critics. Her breakthrough role was as Lucy Honeychurch in &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1985), an adaptation of E. M. Forster&#x27;s 1908 novel, which was filmed after &quot;Lady Jane&quot;, but released two months earlier. She also appeared in episodes of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; as Don Johnson&#x27;s love interest during the 1986–87 season, and then in 1987 with Dirk Bogarde in &quot;The Vision&quot;, Stewart Granger in &quot;A Hazard of Hearts&quot;, and John Gielgud in &quot;Getting It Right&quot;. Bonham Carter was originally cast for the role of Bess McNeill in &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot;, but backed out during production owing to &quot;the character&#x27;s painful psychic and physical exposure&quot;, according to Roger Ebert. The role went to Emily Watson, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance.

Her early films led to her being typecast as a &quot;corset queen&quot; and &quot;English rose&quot;, playing pre- and early 20th century characters, particularly in Merchant Ivory films. Uncomfortable with this image, she states: &quot;I looked, as someone said, like a bloated chipmunk&quot;. In 1994, Bonham Carter appeared in a dream sequence during the second series of the British sitcom &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, as Edina Monsoon&#x27;s daughter Saffron, who was normally played by Julia Sawalha. Throughout the series, references were made to Saffron&#x27;s resemblance to Bonham Carter.

Bonham Carter, who speaks French fluently, starred in a 1996 French film titled &quot;Portraits chinois&quot;. That same year, she played Olivia in Trevor Nunn&#x27;s film version of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. One of the high points of her early career was her performance as the scheming Kate Croy in the 1997 film adaption of &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot;, which was highly acclaimed internationally and saw her receive her first Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations. Then followed &quot;Fight Club&quot; in 1999, in which she played Marla Singer, a role for which she won the 2000 Empire Award for Best British Actress.

===Worldwide recognition and blockbuster films (2000s–2020s)===
In August 2001, she was featured in &quot;Maxim&quot;. She played her second Queen of England when she was cast as Anne Boleyn in the ITV1 miniseries &quot;Henry VIII&quot;; however, her role was restricted, as she was pregnant with her first child at the time of filming. In 2005, she voiced Lady Tottingham, a wealthy aristocratic spinster in the 2005 stop-motion animated comedy &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;. Starring alongside Ralph Fiennes and Peter Sallis, the film serves as part of the Wallace &amp; Gromit series.

She was a member of the 2006 Cannes Film Festival jury that unanimously selected &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley&quot; as best film. In May 2006, Bonham Carter launched her own fashion line, &quot;The Pantaloonies&quot;, with swimwear designer Samantha Sage. Their first collection, called Bloomin&#x27; Bloomers, is a Victorian style selection of camisoles, mob caps, and bloomers. The duo worked on Pantaloonies customised jeans, which Bonham Carter describes as &quot;a kind of scrapbook on the bum&quot;.

Bonham Carter played the evil witch Bellatrix Lestrange in the final four &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films (2007–2011). While filming &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, she accidentally perforated the eardrum of Matthew Lewis (playing Neville Longbottom) when she stuck her wand into his ear canal. Bonham Carter received positive reviews as Bellatrix, described as a &quot;shining but underused talent&quot;. She played Mrs. Lovett, Sweeney Todd&#x27;s (Johnny Depp) amorous accomplice, in the film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s Broadway musical, &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;, directed by Burton. 
Bonham Carter received a nomination for the Golden Globe for Best Actress for her performance. She won the Best Actress award in the 2007 Evening Standard British Film Awards for her performances in &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; and &quot;Conversations With Other Women&quot;, along with another Best Actress award at the 2009 Empire Awards. Bonham Carter also appeared in the fourth &quot;Terminator&quot; film, entitled &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;, playing a small but pivotal role as a personification of Skynet.

In 2009, Bonham Carter was the mother squirrel narrator in the 30-minute animated film adaptation of the best-selling children&#x27;s book &quot;The Gruffalo&quot;, which was broadcast on BBC One on 25 December 2009.

In April 2012, she appeared in Rufus Wainwright&#x27;s music video for his single &quot;Out of the Game&quot;, featured on the album of the same name.

Spivet&quot;) of Reif Larsen&#x27;s book &quot;The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet&quot;. Her casting was announced alongside that of Kathy Bates, Kyle Catlett and Callum Keith Rennie, with Jean-Pierre Jeunet directing.

In 2022 Bonham Carter was appointed to the honorary position of the London Library’s president, making her their first female president. She has been a member of the London Library since 1986.

===Relationships===
In 1994, Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh met while filming &quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot;. They began an affair while Branagh was still married to Emma Thompson. At the time, Thompson&#x27;s career was soaring, while Branagh was struggling to make a success of his first big-budget film. Following the affair, Branagh and Thompson divorced in 1995. In 1999, after five years together, Bonham Carter and Branagh separated.

Thompson has said she has &quot;no hard feelings&quot; towards Bonham Carter, calling her affair with Branagh &quot;blood under the bridge&quot;. She explained: &quot;You can&#x27;t hold on to anything like that. It&#x27;s pointless. I haven&#x27;t got the energy for it. Helena and I made our peace years and years ago. She&#x27;s a wonderful woman.&quot; Thompson, Branagh, and Bonham Carter all later went on to appear in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series (none of them shared any scenes); Thompson and Bonham Carter both appeared in &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;.

In 2001, Bonham Carter began a relationship with American director Tim Burton, whom she met while filming &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. Burton cast her in a number of his other films, including &quot;Big Fish&quot;, &quot;Corpse Bride&quot;, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, and &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. After their separation, Bonham Carter said, &quot;It might be easier to work together without being together anymore. He always only cast me with great embarrassment.&quot;
Bonham Carter and Burton lived in adjoining houses in Belsize Park, London. She owned one of the houses; Burton later bought the other, and they connected the two. In 2006, they bought the Mill House in Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire. It was previously leased by her grandmother, Violet Bonham Carter, and owned by her great-grandfather H. H. Asquith.

Bonham Carter and Burton have a son and daughter together. She told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; of her struggles with infertility and the difficulties she had during her pregnancies. She said that before the conception of her daughter, she and Burton had been trying for a baby for two years and, although they conceived naturally, they were considering in vitro fertilisation.

On 23 December 2014, the two announced that they had &quot;separated amicably&quot; earlier that year. Of the separation, Bonham Carter told &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;: &quot;Everyone always says you have to be strong and have a stiff upper lip, but it&#x27;s okay to be fragile. ...You&#x27;ve got to take very small steps, and sometimes you won&#x27;t know where to go next because you&#x27;ve lost yourself.&quot; She added: &quot;With divorce, you go through massive grief—it is a death of a relationship, so it&#x27;s utterly bewildering. Your identity, everything, changes.&quot;

Since 2018, Bonham Carter has been in a relationship with art historian Rye Dag Holmboe. Holmboe is 21 years her junior. Regarding their age gap, Bonham Carter told &quot;The Times&quot; in 2019: &quot;Everybody ages at a different rate. My boyfriend is unbelievably mature. He&#x27;s an old soul in a young body, what more could I want? People are slightly frightened of older women, but he isn&#x27;t. Women can be very powerful when they&#x27;re older.&quot;

==Public image==
Bonham Carter is known for her unconventional and eccentric sense of fashion. &quot;British Vogue&quot; described her dark style in clothing and acting as &quot;quirky and irreverent&quot;. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; named her on its 2010 Best-Dressed List and she was selected by Marc Jacobs to be the face of his Autumn/Winter 2011 advertising campaign. She has cited Vivienne Westwood and Marie Antoinette as her main style influences.

In May 2021, Bonham Carter featured in a commercial for British furniture retailer Sofology, taking viewers through the quirks and stylistic flourishes of her home. In 2021, she wrote an article for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; on the influence of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; on her life since she first read the book as a child: &quot;As far back as I can remember, I’ve been a wannabe Alice&quot;, adding, &quot;everywhere I look at home, every view has some reference to &quot;Alice&quot;: frog footman candlesticks, teacup constructions, a teapot lamp, a chessboard teapot, an oversized pocket watch, undersized doors, bunnies, internal windows that look like mirrors, and mirrors that look like windows&quot;.

<text> is a traditional medicine practice in Southern Africa as far north as Lake Tanganyika.

==Name==

In South African English, the word is derived from the Zulu/Xhosa/Northern Ndebele , meaning &#x27;tree&#x27;, whose root is . In Southern Africa, and other cognates of are in widespread use in most indigenous African languages as well as in South African English and Afrikaans, which sometimes use as a slang word for medicine in general.

This noun is of the &quot;umu&quot;/&quot;imi&quot; class so the singular (&#x27;tree&#x27;) is &quot;umuthi&quot; and the plural (&#x27;trees&#x27;) is &quot;imithi&quot;. Since the pronunciation of the initial vowel of this class is unstressed, the singular is sometimes pronounced &quot;muthi&quot;. The word is rendered as &quot;muti&quot; by the historical effects of the British colonial spelling.

In colloquial English and Afrikaans the word is often used to refer to medicines in general or medicines that have a &#x27;miraculous&#x27; effect, e.g.
* &quot; (The doctor rubbed on the wound and the next day it was completely healed.)
* &quot; (&quot;My doctor gave me some for my sore throat.&quot;)

==Traditional medicine==
African traditional medicine makes use of various natural products, many derived from trees and other plants. Botanical medicine prescribed by an inyanga or herbal healer is generally known as &quot;muthi&quot;, but the term can apply to other traditional medical formulations, including those that are zoological or mineral in composition.

Vulture brains are used for prophecy in muthi.

==Use of Isicakathi in the Eastern Cape==

&quot;Isicakathi&quot; is a term that is used by Xhosa people when referring to plants with supposed pharmacological
and therapeutic properties that are used as medicine for various ailments.

The people in the Eastern Cape of South Africa still strongly rely on traditional medicine and believe in its potency as an alternative to western medicine. There are various herbs that fall under &quot;isicakathi&quot; , used for pre-natal and post-natal medicine (although they can also be used for non-pregnancy related health issues). The plants that fall under the &quot;isicakathi&quot; category differ according to the districts in the Eastern Cape, hence it is a general term used when referring to traditional medicine. There are eleven species of plants that fall under &quot;isicakathi&quot;, namely &quot;Commelina africana&quot;, &quot;Agapanthus praecox&quot;, &quot;Chlorophytum comosum&quot;, &quot;Ledebouria ovatifolia&quot;, &quot;Ranunculus multifidus&quot;, &quot;Thunbergia atriplicifolia&quot;, &quot;Kohautia amatymbica&quot;, &quot;Plantago major&quot;, &quot;Gazania linearis&quot;, &quot;Helichrysum pedunculatum&quot; and &quot;Senecio coronatus&quot;. The use of these plants differs according to the various areas/ districts of the Eastern Cape. &quot;Commelina africana&quot; is used for menstrual problems, pelvic pains and bladder related issues. &quot;Agapanthus&quot; is found in pre-natal and post-natal medicine, which is used by pregnant women. &quot;Chlorophytum comosum&quot; is used as a protective charm against evil spirits for both mother and child. &quot;Ledebouria ovatifolia&quot; is used for medicinal purposes, including pregnancy, diarrhoea, influenza, backaches, skin irritations and wounds. &quot;Ranunculus multifidus&quot; is used for epileptic fits in adults, lung problems and used as an emetic. &quot;Kohautia amatymbica&quot; is also used as an emetic. &quot;Plantago major&quot; is used for wounds, inflammations, and eye irritations. &quot;Gazania linearis&quot; is applied on small cuts made on the body close to the joints to protect someone from evil spirits. &quot;Helichrysum pedunculatum&quot; is used as a dressing after circumcision and to prevent the wound from getting septic. &quot;Senecio coronatus&quot; is used to get rid of pubic lice. Generally, &quot;isicakathi&quot; or plants that are regarded to fall under &quot;isicakathi&quot; are mostly used by pregnant women and children. Thus, it is also used as a protective measure against sorcery during pregnancy.

===Isicakathi for pre-natal and post-natal care===
&quot;Agapanthus praecox&quot; is one of the plants that falls under &quot;isicakathi&quot; used during pregnancy. It is taken orally from the six month of pregnancy until delivery. The plant is put in a container full of water and half a cup of that water is taken orally, twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. It is believed that the plant’s growth determines the health of the unborn baby. The wilting of the plant is regarded as a symbol with regards to the baby&#x27;s health, usually associated with death.
&quot;Isicakathi&quot; is widely used to induce easy childbirth. It ensures that excess water is drained, reduces vaginal discharge and placental size. The plants treat high blood pressure in both antenatal and postnatal care for women, whilst also preventing constipation.

&quot;Rhoicissus tidentata&quot; is used to induce labour; its root can be used to prepare an enema. &quot;Erythrina lysistemon&quot; is used to induce labour pains during the childbirth process via pieces of the trunk&#x27;s bark bound together and infused for the woman to drink. The crushed bulb of &quot;Gunnera perpensa&quot; is used to reduce swelling of the feet by infusing with boiling water and ingesting.

===The use of Isicakathi on the baby===
&quot;Salvia scabra&quot;, mixed with the mother’s milk, is given as medicine to infants. The mixture is given to the baby to ingest every day for two months.
&quot;Isicakathi&quot; is generally used to induce growth and prevent diseases. It is also used as an alternative to the mother’s milk and to counteract the milk’s sourness. The use of &quot;Agapanthus praecox&quot; ensures that the baby is strong, whilst preventing bowel problems and crusts on its head.

An ointment is used to hasten the parturition of the baby and placenta using the leaves of &quot;Scutia mytina&quot;. &quot;Erythrina humeana&quot; is used to heal the umbilical cord of the baby by burning the bark and using the powder to apply on the baby.

== Muti killings ==

Occasions of murder with mutilation associated with some traditional medicine practices in South Africa have been termed &quot;muti killings&quot;. These are not human sacrifices directly, but rather involve the murder of someone in order to harvest body parts for incorporation into traditional medicines and rituals.

In February 2010, Deputy Provincial Commissioner William Mpembe of the South African Police Service (SAPS) in North West Province said that &quot;muti murders, particularly those involving young children, seem to be on the rise in the Tshwane areas including Soshanguve, Garankuwa and Rietgat&quot;. That same month, African traditional healers and the Gauteng government convened at a seminar in Pretoria, South Africa to root out the &quot;evil practice of mutilating human bodies for purposes of muti making.&quot;

<text>The Bilderberg Meeting (also known as the &quot;Bilderberg Group&quot;, &quot;Bilderberg Conference&quot; or &quot;Bilderberg Club&quot;) is an annual off-the-record forum established in 1954 to foster dialogue between Europe and North America. The group&#x27;s agenda, originally to prevent another world war, is now defined as bolstering a consensus around free market Western capitalism and its interests around the globe. Participants include political leaders, experts, captains of industry, finance, academia, numbering between 120 and 150. Attendees are entitled to use information gained at meetings, but not attribute it to a named speaker (known as the Chatham House Rule). The group states that the purpose of this is to encourage candid debate while at the same time maintaining privacy, but critics from a wide range of viewpoints have called it into question, and it has provoked conspiracy theories from both the left and right.

Meetings were chaired by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands until 1975. The current Chairman is French businessman Henri de Castries. Since 1954, the meeting has taken place every year except in 1976, when it was cancelled due to the Lockheed bribery scandals involving Prince Bernhard, and in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lisbon hosted the 69th meeting in 2023.

== Origin ==
The first conference was held at the Bilderberg Hotel (Hotel de Bilderberg) in Oosterbeek, Netherlands, from 29 to 31 May 1954. The hotel gave its name both to the group and to the &quot;Bilderbergers&quot; who participate in its activities. The hotel is situated in a quiet location, approximately 7 km west of the city of Arnhem. It is owned and operated by the Bilderberg hotel chain, which runs 12 hotels and an event location in the Netherlands and one hotel in Germany. At the time of the 1954 conference, it was a medium-sized family-run hotel.

The conference was initiated by several people, including Polish politician-in-exile Józef Retinger who, concerned about the growth of anti-Americanism in Western Europe, proposed an international conference at which leaders from European countries and the United States would be brought together with the aim of promoting Atlanticism—better understanding between the cultures of the United States and Western Europe to foster cooperation on political, economic, and defense issues.

Retinger approached Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands who agreed to promote the idea, together with former Belgian prime minister Paul van Zeeland, and the then head of Unilever, Paul Rijkens. Bernhard in turn contacted Walter Bedell Smith, the then head of the CIA, who asked Eisenhower adviser Charles Douglas Jackson to deal with the suggestion. The guest list was to be drawn up by inviting two attendees from each nation, one of each to represent &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; points of view. Fifty delegates from 11 countries in Western Europe attended the first conference, along with 11 Americans.

The success of the meeting led the organizers to arrange an annual conference. A permanent steering committee was established with Retinger appointed as permanent secretary. As well as organizing the conference, the steering committee also maintained a register of attendee names and contact details with the aim of creating an informal network of individuals who could call upon one another in a private capacity. Conferences were held in France, Germany, and Denmark over the following three years. In 1957, the first U.S. conference was held on St. Simons Island, Georgia, with $30,000 from the Ford Foundation. The foundation also supplied funding for the 1959 and 1963 conferences.

== Participants ==

The participants are between 120 and 150 people, including political leaders, experts from industry, finance, NATO, academia and the media. About two thirds of the participants come from Europe and the rest from North America; one third from politics and government and the rest from other fields. Historically, attendee lists have been weighted toward bankers, politicians, directors of large businesses and board members from large publicly traded corporations, including Wallenberg-owned conglomerate holding company Investor AB and other Wallenberg-owned multinationals such as Ericsson and ABB, IBM, Xerox, Royal Dutch Shell, Nokia and Daimler. Heads of state, including former King Juan Carlos I of Spain and former Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, have attended meetings. A source connected to the group told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2013 that other individuals, whose names are not publicly issued, sometimes turn up &quot;just for the day&quot; at the group&#x27;s meetings.

The banker and industrialist Marcus Wallenberg Jr. was a member of the steering committee and attended the meeting twenty-two times from the 1950s to 1981, a year prior to his death. His grandson Marcus Wallenberg has attended it eight times and his other grandson, Jacob Wallenberg, seventeen times.

== Meetings ==
== Activities and goals ==
The group&#x27;s original goal of promoting Atlanticism, strengthening U.S.-European relations, and preventing another world war has grown. According to Andrew Kakabadse, the Bilderberg Group&#x27;s theme is to &quot;bolster a consensus around free-market Western capitalism and its interests around the globe&quot;. In 2001, Denis Healey, a Bilderberg group founder and a steering committee member for 30 years, said, &quot;To say we were striving for a one-world government is exaggerated, but not wholly unfair. Those of us in Bilderberg felt we couldn&#x27;t go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and rendering millions homeless. So we felt that a single community throughout the world would be a good thing.&quot;

According to the web page of the group, the meetings are conducted under the Chatham House Rule, allowing the participants to use any information they gained during the meeting, but not to disclose the names of the speakers or any other participants. According to former chairman Étienne Davignon in 2011, a major attraction of Bilderberg group meetings is that they provide an opportunity for participants to speak and debate candidly and to find out what major figures really think, without the risk of off-the-cuff comments becoming fodder for controversy in the media. A 2008 press release from the &quot;American Friends of Bilderberg&quot; stated that &quot;Bilderberg&#x27;s only activity is its annual Conference and that at the meetings, no resolutions were proposed, no votes taken, and no policy statements issued.&quot; However, in November 2009, the group hosted a dinner meeting at the Château of Val-Duchesse in Brussels outside its annual conference to promote the candidacy of Herman Van Rompuy for President of the European Council.

== Organizational structure ==
Meetings are organized by a steering committee with two members from each of approximately 18 nations. Official posts include a chairman and an Honorary Secretary General. The group&#x27;s rules do not contain a membership category but former participants receive the annual conference reports. The only category that exists is &quot;member of the steering committee&quot;. Besides the committee, there is a separate advisory group with overlapping membership.

Dutch economist Ernst van der Beugel became permanent secretary in 1960, upon Retinger&#x27;s death. Prince Bernhard continued to serve as the meeting&#x27;s chairman until 1976, the year of his involvement in the Lockheed affair. The position of Honorary American Secretary General has been held successively by Joseph E. Johnson of the Carnegie Endowment; William Bundy of Princeton University; Theodore L. Eliot Jr., former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan; and Casimir A. Yost of Georgetown University&#x27;s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy.

According to James A. Bill, the &quot;steering committee usually met twice a year to plan programs and to discuss the participant list&quot;.

In 2002, in &quot;&quot;, author Jon Ronson wrote that the group has a small central office in Holland which each year decides what country will host the forthcoming meeting. The host country then has to book an entire hotel for four days, plus arrange catering, transport and security. To fund this, the host solicits donations from sympathetic corporations such as Barclays, Fiat Automobiles, GlaxoSmithKline, Heinz, Nokia and Xerox.

== Chairmen of the Steering Committee ==

== Criticism==

There have been long standing concerns about lobbying, since senior policymakers meet with corporate lobbyists, and in the case of the 2015 meeting even with senior figures at Transparency International.

Partly because of its working methods to ensure strict privacy and secrecy, the Bilderberg Group has been criticised for its lack of transparency and accountability. 
Ian Richardson sees Bilderberg as the transnational power elite, &quot;an integral, and to some extent critical, part of the existing system of global governance&quot;, that is &quot;not acting in the interests of the whole&quot;. Many of these critics have emphasized that they do not accept or do not believe that there is enough evidence to support the diversity of conspiracy theories that have arisen in regard to the group and that they disapprove of what they regard as their unpleasant associations and connotations. For example, an article by the English commentator Charlie Skelton in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in June 2017 criticized the world view expressed in an agenda published by the Bilderberg group without engaging in speculation about conspiratorial activities.

==Conspiracy theories ==
The secrecy of the proceedings has led not only to varied criticism of the group and its activities from across the political spectrum but also to a number of conspiracy theories, which have grown especially popular within certain political movements, although the different factions of theorists often disagree about the exact nature of the group&#x27;s intentions and use different sources and levels of evidentiary rigor to back up their conjectures. Some on the left, or of less specific political affiliations, accuse the Bilderberg group either of covertly imposing or generally propping up capitalist domination and corporate power, while some on the right have accused the group of imposing or helping to prepare the way for a world government and a global planned economy. The right-wing theorists tend to treat the group as the central directorate or planning arm of the conspiracy or at least attribute considerable importance to its role, whereas most of the left-wing and more loosely-affiliated or apolitical theorists treat it as just one of a set of institutions that help to advance international corporate interests and ideology.

In 2005, Davignon discussed accusations of the group striving for a one-world government with the BBC: &quot;It is unavoidable and it doesn&#x27;t matter. There will always be people who believe in conspiracies but things happen in a much more incoherent fashion. ... When people say this is a secret government of the world I say that if we were a secret government of the world we should be bloody ashamed of ourselves.&quot;

In a 1994 report, &quot;Right Woos Left&quot;, published by the Political Research Associates, investigative journalist Chip Berlet argued that right-wing populist conspiracy theories about the Bilderberg group date back to as early as 1964 and can be found in Phyllis Schlafly&#x27;s self-published book &quot;A Choice, Not an Echo&quot;, which promoted a conspiracy theory in which the Republican Party was secretly controlled by elitist intellectuals dominated by members of the Bilderberg group, whose internationalist policies would pave the way for world communism.

In August 2010, former Cuban president Fidel Castro wrote an article for the Cuban Communist Party newspaper &quot;Granma&quot; in which he cited Daniel Estulin&#x27;s 2006 book &quot;The Secrets of the Bilderberg Club&quot;, which, as quoted by Castro, describes &quot;sinister cliques and the Bilderberg lobbyists&quot; manipulating the public &quot;to install a world government that knows no borders and is not accountable to anyone but its own self.&quot;

Proponents of Bilderberg conspiracy theories in the United States include such groups and individuals such as the John Birch Society, political activist Phyllis Schlafly, writer Jim Tucker, political activist Lyndon LaRouche, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and politician Jesse Ventura, who made the Bilderberg group a topic of a 2009 episode of his TruTV series &quot;Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura&quot;. Although conspiracy theories about the Bilderberg Group have gained the most widespread credence by far in the United States, some high-profile non-American proponents have raised them as well, including Lithuanian writer Daniel Estulin and British politician Nigel Farage.

<doc id="80351" wikidata="Q13369" url="?curid=80351" title="Rimini">
<text>Rimini ( , ; or ; ) is a city in the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy.

Sprawling along the Adriatic Sea, Rimini is situated at a strategically-important north-south passage along the coast at the southern tip of the Po Valley. It is one of the most notable seaside resorts in Europe, with a significant domestic and international tourist economy. The first bathing establishment opened in 1843. The city is also the birthplace of the film director Federico Fellini, and the nearest Italian city to the independent Republic of San Marino.

The ancient Romans founded the &quot;colonia&quot; of in 268 BC, constructing the Arch of Augustus and the Ponte di Tiberio at the start of strategic roads that ended in Rimini. During the Renaissance, the city benefited from the court of the House of Malatesta, hosting artists like Leonardo da Vinci and producing the Tempio Malatestiano. In the 19th century, Rimini hosted many movements campaigning for Italian unification. Much of the city was destroyed during World War II, and it earned a gold medal for civic valour for its partisan resistance. In recent years, the Rimini Fiera has become one of the largest sites for trade fairs and conferences in Italy.

As of 31 December 2019, Rimini&#x27;s urban area was home to 151,200 people, with approximately 325,000 living in the eponymous province, making it the twenty-eighth largest city in Italy.

== History ==

=== Ancient history ===

The area was inhabited by Etruscans until the arrival of the Celts, who held it from the 6th century BC until their defeat by the Umbri in 283 BC. In 268 BC at the mouth of the Ariminus (now called the Marecchia), the Roman Republic founded the &quot;colonia&quot; of Ariminum.

Ariminum was seen as a bastion against Celtic invaders and also as a springboard for conquering the Padana plain. The city was involved in the civil wars of the first century, aligned with the popular party and its leaders, first Gaius Marius, and then Julius Caesar. After crossing the Rubicon, the latter made his legendary appeal to the legions in the Forum of Rimini.

As the terminus of the Via Flaminia, which ended in the town at the surviving prestigious Arch of Augustus (erected 27 BC), Rimini was a road junction connecting central and northern Italy by the Via Aemilia that led to Piacenza and the Via Popilia that extended northwards; it also opened up trade by sea and river.

Remains of the amphitheatre that could seat 12,000 people, and a five-arched bridge of Istrian stone completed by Tiberius (21 AD), are still visible. Later Galla Placidia built the church of Santo Stefano.

The evidence that Rimini is of Roman origins is illustrated by the city being divided by two main streets, the Cardo and the Decumanus.

The end of Roman rule was marked by destruction caused by invasions and wars, but also by the establishment of the palaces of the Imperial officers and the first churches, the symbol of the spread of Christianity that held the important Council of Ariminum in the city in 359.

=== Middle Ages ===

When the Ostrogoths conquered Rimini in 493, Odoacer, besieged in Ravenna, had to capitulate. During the Gothic War (535–554), Rimini was taken and retaken many times. In its vicinity the Byzantine general Narses overthrew (553) the Alamanni. Under the Byzantine rule, it belonged to the Duchy of the Pentapolis, part of the Exarchate of Ravenna.

In 728, it was taken with many other cities by Liutprand, King of the Lombards but returned to the Byzantines about 735. Pepin the Short gave it to the Holy See, but during the wars of the popes and the Italian cities against the emperors, Rimini sided with the latter.

In the 13th century, it suffered from the discords of the Gambacari and Ansidei families. The city became a municipality in the 14th century, and with the arrival of the religious orders, numerous convents and churches were built, providing work for many illustrious artists. In fact, Giotto inspired the 14th-century School of Rimini, which was the expression of original cultural ferment.

The House of Malatesta emerged from the struggles between municipal factions with Malatesta da Verucchio, who in 1239 was named podestà (chief magistrate) of the city. Despite interruptions, his family held authority until 1528. In 1312 he was succeeded by Malatestino Malatesta, first &quot;signore&quot; (lord) of the city and Pandolfo I Malatesta, the latter&#x27;s brother, named by Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, as imperial vicar of Romagna.

Ferrantino, son of Malatesta II (1335), was opposed by his cousin Ramberto and by Cardinal Bertrand du Pouget (1331), legate of Pope John XXII. Malatesta II was also lord of Pesaro. He was succeeded by Malatesta Ungaro (1373) and Galeotto I Malatesta, uncle of the former (1385), lord also of Fano (from 1340), Pesaro, and Cesena (1378).

His son, Carlo I Malatesta, one of the most respected condottieri of the time, enlarged the Riminese possessions and restored the port. Carlo died childless in 1429, and the lordship was divided into three parts, Rimini going to Galeotto Roberto Malatesta, a Catholic zealot inadequate for the position.

The Pesarese line of the Malatestas tried, in fact, to take advantage of his weakness and to capture the city, but Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, Carlo&#x27;s nephew, who was only 14 at the time, intervened to save it. Galeotto retired to a convent, and Sigismondo obtained the rule of Rimini.

Sigismondo Pandolfo was the most famous lord of Rimini. In 1433, Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, sojourned in the city and for a while he was the commander-in-chief of the Papal armies. A skilled general, Sigismondo often acted as &quot;condottiero&quot; for other states to gain money to embellish it (he was also a dilettante poet). He had the famous Tempio Malatestiano rebuilt by Leon Battista Alberti. However, after the rise of Pope Pius II, he had to fight constantly for the independence of the city.

In 1463, he was forced to submit to Pius II, who left him only Rimini and little more; Roberto Malatesta, his son (1482), under Pope Paul II, nearly lost his state, but under Pope Sixtus IV, became the commanding officer of the pontifical army against Ferdinand of Naples. Sigismondo was, however, defeated by Neapolitan forces in the battle of Campomorto (1482). Pandolfo IV, his son (1500), lost Rimini to Cesare Borgia, after whose overthrow it fell to Venice (1503–1509), but it was later retaken by Pope Julius II and incorporated into the Papal States.

After the death of Pope Leo X, Pandolfo returned for several months, and with his son Sigismondo Malatesta held a rule which looked tyrannous even for the time. Pope Adrian VI expelled him again and gave Rimini to the Duke of Urbino, the pope&#x27;s vicar in Romagna.

In 1527, Sigismondo managed to regain the city, but in the following year the Malatesta dominion died forever.

=== Renaissance and Enlightenment ===

At the beginning of the 16th century, Rimini, now a secondary town of the Papal States, was ruled by an Apostolic Legate. Towards the end of the 16th century, the municipal square (now Piazza Cavour), which had been closed off on a site where the Poletti Theatre was subsequently built, was redesigned. The statue of Pope Paul V has stood in the centre of the square next to the fountain since 1614.

In the 16th century, the &#x27;grand square&#x27;, which was where markets and tournaments were held, underwent various changes. A small temple dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua and a clock tower were built there, giving the square its present shape and size.

Until the 18th century raiding armies, earthquakes, famines, floods and pirate attacks ravaged the city. In this gloomy situation and due to a weakened local economy, fishing took on great importance, a fact testified by the construction of structures such as the fish market and Rimini Lighthouse.

In 1797, Rimini, along with the rest of Romagna, was affected by the passage of the Napoleonic army and became part of the Cisalpine Republic. Napoleonic policy suppressed the monastic orders, confiscating their property and thus dispersing a substantial heritage, and demolished many churches including the ancient cathedral of Santa Colomba.

=== Modern history ===
The troops of Joachim Murat, King of Naples, marched through Rimini on 30 March 1815. In a last attempt to gain allies before his defeat in the Neapolitan War, Murat published the Rimini Proclamation, one of the earliest calls for Italian unification. In 1845, a band of adventurers commanded by Ribbotti entered the city and proclaimed a constitution which was soon abolished. In 1860, Rimini and Romagna were incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy.

The city was transformed after the 1843 founding of the first bathing establishment and the Kursaal, a building constructed to host sumptuous social events, became the symbol of Rimini&#x27;s status as a tourist resort. In just a few years, the seafront underwent considerable development work, making Rimini &#x27;the city of small villas&#x27;.

During World War I, Rimini and its surrounding infrastructure was one of the primary targets of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. After Italy&#x27;s declaration of war on 15 May 1915, the Austro-Hungarian fleet left its harbours the same day and started its assault on the Adriatic coast between Venice and Barletta. The 1916 Rimini earthquakes, on 17 May and 16 August, led to the demolition of 615 buildings in the city, with many historic churches severely damaged. 4,174 people were displaced between Rimini and Riccione. On 19 October 1922, Riccione was separated from Rimini to form a separate .

In World War II, Rimini suffered sustained Allied aerial bombardment from November 1943 until its liberation on 21 September 1944. 82% of Rimini&#x27;s buildings were destroyed, the highest figure among Italian cities with over 50,000 inhabitants. Around 55,000 refugees fled to the north, to the hinterland, and to San Marino, where they sheltered in the country&#x27;s railway tunnels. As the Allied frontline approached the city, naval bombardment followed, and remaining citizens hid in makeshift shelters or in caves by the Covignano hill. Partisan resistance was also notable in Rimini, with official reports of 400 young people involved in resistance cells. On 16 August 1944, three partisans were hanged in Rimini&#x27;s central square, which would later be renamed in their honour. The Battle of Rimini was a major engagement in the Gothic Line. Oliver Leese, the British Eighth Army&#x27;s commander, called the advance to liberate Rimini &quot;one of the hardest battles of the Eighth Army ... comparable to El Alamein, Mareth, and the Gustav Line (Monte Cassino)&quot;. Within 37 days of the battle, over 10,000 soldiers had died between the Allied and Axis forces. For its role in liberating Rimini, the 3rd Greek Mountain Brigade was awarded the honorific title &quot;Rimini Brigade&quot;. 1,939 Allied soldiers, of which 1,413 are British, were buried in the Coriano Ridge War Cemetery in Coriano. 114 Greek soldiers were buried in a cemetery in Riccione&#x27;s Fontanelle area, and an Indian cemetery with 618 burials is located on the San Marino Highway.

Following Rimini&#x27;s liberation, reconstruction work began, culminating in huge development of the tourist industry in the city.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
Rimini is situated at 44°03′00″ north and 12°34′00″ east, along the coast of the Adriatic Sea, at the southeastern edge of Emilia-Romagna, at a short distance from Montefeltro and Marche. Rimini extends for 135.71 square km and borders the municipalities of Bellaria-Igea Marina, San Mauro Pascoli, and Santarcangelo di Romagna towards NW, Verucchio and Serravalle, San Marino towards SW, Coriano towards S, and Riccione towards SE.

Rimini is the main centre of a coastal conurbation, which extends from Cervia to Gabicce Mare, including the seaside resorts of Cesenatico, Gatteo a Mare, Bellaria-Igea Marina, Riccione, Misano Adriatico and Cattolica. The conurbation is a result of urban sprawl as the tourist economy developed along the .

=== Natural features ===
Rimini&#x27;s natural geography provides a strategically-important passage along the Adriatic Sea at the boundary between northern Italy, characterised by the plains of the Po Valley, and central Italy, characterised by more mountainous terrain. For its geographical position and its climatic features, Rimini is situated on the edge between the Mediterranean and the central European microclimates, providing an environment of notable naturalistic value.

==== Beach ====
Rimini&#x27;s coastal strip, made of recent marine deposits, is edged by a fine sandy beach, long and up to wide, interrupted only by river mouths and gently shelving towards the sea. Along the coastline, there is a low sandy cliff, created by the rising sea in around 4000 BC, partly conserved north of Rimini, between Rivabella and Bellaria-Igea Marina, approximately from the coast.

Rimini&#x27;s ancient coastline was situated much farther inland: it gradually shifted outward over centuries, with new land developed throughout the 20th century.

==== Rivers and streams ====

Rimini&#x27;s city centre was founded between two rivers: the Marecchia and the Ausa. Until the 1960s, the Ausa flowed south of Rimini&#x27;s city centre, running between the present-day Rimini Sud junction of the A14 tolled highway and the Arch of Augustus, where it turned north-east along the old city walls to empty at Piazzale Kennedy. From the 1960s, the Ausa was diverted to flow parallel to the state road along cemented banks, and empty into the Marecchia. The diversion was completed in 1972, with the Ausa&#x27;s former route reduced to a sewage outlet, and redeveloped into a series of public parks.

The Marecchia itself, which flows north of Rimini, was also deviated to empty into the Adriatic Sea further north, between San Giuliano Mare and Rivabella. The deviation was prompted because the river was subjected to periodic, destructive floods near its mouth, where the riverbed became narrow after various bends. The ancient riverbed is still used as Rimini&#x27;s harbour.

Rimini&#x27;s southern boundary with the municipality of Riccione is marked by the Rio dell&#x27;Asse, a minor stream.

==== Hills ====
To its southwest, Rimini is surrounded by several rolling hills: Covignano ( altitude), Vergiano ( altitude), San Martino Monte l&#x27;Abbate ( altitude) and San Lorenzo in Correggiano ( altitude). The hills are widely cultivated, with vineyards, olive groves and orchards, and historic villas.

=== Districts ===

==== City centre and boroughs ====
Rimini&#x27;s city centre, bounded by the Malatesta city walls, was divided in the medieval era into four &quot;rioni&quot;. Clodio, in the city&#x27;s north, was popular and a peculiar urban structure tied with the Marecchia. Pomposo, in the city&#x27;s east, was the largest district, and included large orchards and convents. Cittadella, in the city&#x27;s west, was the most important district, including the municipal palaces, Castel Sismondo, and the Cathedral of Santa Colomba. Montecavallo, in the city&#x27;s south, is characterised today by bowed, irregular streets of medieval origins, by the Fossa Patara creek and a small hill called Montirone. The boundaries of these &quot;rioni&quot; are not known, but it is assumed that they followed the current Corso d&#x27;Augusto, Via Garibaldi, and Via Gambalunga.
Outside Rimini&#x27;s city centre were four ancient boroughs: San Giuliano, San Giovanni, San Andrea, and Marina. These were entirely incorporated to the city by the urban sprawl in the early 20th century:

* Borgo San Giuliano, along Via Emilia, dates to the 11th century and was originally a fishermen&#x27;s settlement. Dominated by the Church of San Giuliano, it is one of the most picturesque spots of the city, with narrow streets and squares, colourful small houses and many frescoes representing characters and places of Federico Fellini&#x27;s films.
* Borgo San Giovanni, on both sides of Via Flaminia, was populated by artisans and the middle class.
* Borgo Sant&#x27;Andrea, located outside of Porta Montanara on the city&#x27;s southwestern gate, was tied with agriculture and commerce of cows.
* Borgo Marina, on the right bank of the Marecchia, was heavily transformed by Fascist demolitions and World War II bombings, which hit this area due to its proximity to the bridges and railway station of the city.

San Giovanni and Sant&#x27;Andrea were developed in the 15th century; they burned in a fire in 1469 and were rebuilt in the 19th century, relocating small industries and manufactures, including a brick factory and a phosphorus matches factory.

Rimini&#x27;s municipality includes the coastal districts of , Viserbella, Viserba, Rivabella, and San Giuliano Mare to the city centre&#x27;s north. To the city centre&#x27;s south are the coastal districts of Bellariva, Marebello, Rivazzurra, and Miramare. These coastal districts are characterised by their tourist economy, with hotels and entertainment venues.

Along the Via Flaminia, to Rimini&#x27;s southeast, are the suburbs of Colonnella and Lagomaggio.

=== Climate ===
Rimini has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) moderated by the influence of the Adriatic Sea, featuring autumn and winter mean temperatures and annual low temperatures among the very highest in Emilia-Romagna.

Precipitations are equally distributed during the year, with a peak in October and minimums in January and July. In spring, autumn, and winter, precipitations mainly come from oceanic fronts, while in summer, they are brought by thunderstorms, coming from the Apennines or the Po Valley.

Humidity is high all year round, averaging a minimum of approximately 72% in June and July and a maximum of approximately 84% in November and December. Prevailing winds blow from west, south, east, and northwest. Southwesterly winds, known as libeccio or garbino, are foehn winds, which may bring warm temperatures in each season. On average, there are over 2,040 sunshine hours per year.

==Demographics==
===Population===
, Rimini has 150,951 inhabitants, with a density of about 1,100 inhabitants per square kilometre within the city limits.

In 1861, by the time of the first Italian census, the population was around 28,000; in 1931 it was more than double, 57,000.

With the increasing tourism development, population rapidly grew between 1951 and 1981, the fastest growing period for Rimini in the 20th century, when the city&#x27;s population grew from 77,000 to over 128,000.

During the 20th century, two former districts of Rimini got administrative autonomy, causing two distinct temporary drops in population totals: Riccione in 1922 and Bellaria-Igea Marina in 1956.

Foreign population is 18,396, (12.5% of the total), mainly from Eastern Europe, East Asia and North Africa. Between 1992 and 2014, foreign population grew from around 1,800 to over 18,000 units. The most important foreign communities are Albanians (3,479), Romanians (2,904), Ukrainians (2,409), Chinese (1,197) and Moldovans (1,023). Other notable foreign groups in the city are Senegalese, Moroccans, Macedonians, Tunisians, Russians, Bangladeshis and Peruvians.

===Religion===
Rimini&#x27;s population is mostly Catholic. The city is the seat of the Diocese of Rimini, a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia.

The first cathedral of the diocese was the former Cathedral of Santa Colomba until 1798, when the title was transferred to the church of Sant&#x27;Agostino. Since 1809, Rimini&#x27;s cathedral is the Tempio Malatestiano.

Besides Roman Catholic churches, there are also Orthodox, Evangelical and Adventist churches. Between the 13th and 14th century, Rimini had a flourishing Jewish community, which built three distinct synagogues, all destroyed, formerly located around the area of Piazza Cavour, Via Cairoli and Santa Colomba.

==Government==
In its post-war history, Rimini has largely voted for left-wing parties. In the 1975 regional elections, the Italian Communist Party won 49.9% of votes in Rimini, its best-ever electoral result.

For much of Rimini&#x27;s modern history, the city&#x27;s municipal government has been politically subordinate to other cities in Romagna. From 1540 until 1797, with a brief restoration in 1815, Rimini was part of the Papal States&#x27; Legation of Romagna, headquartered in Ravenna. In 1797, the Cisalpine Republic incorporated Rimini into the Rubicon Department, headquartered in Forlì. With the return of the Papal States in 1816, Rimini came under the Legation of Forlì. In 1850, Rimini came under the reformed Legation of Romagna, now with Bologna as its capital. Finally, on 27 December 1859, with Romagna&#x27;s annexation into the Kingdom of Italy, Rimini became part of the Province of Forlì.

On 16 April 1992, for the first time in its modern history, Rimini became a provincial capital with the formation of the Province of Rimini.

== Economy ==
=== Tourism ===
Rimini is a major international tourist destination and seaside resort, among the most well known in Europe and the Mediterranean basin, thanks to a long sandy beach, bathing establishments, theme parks and opportunities for leisure and spare time. The economy of the city is mainly based on tourism, whose development started in the first half of the 19th century and increased after World War II. In 2017, the city welcomed over 57 million tourists.
Rimini&#x27;s origins as a seaside resort date to the foundation of the first bathing establishment, the oldest on the Adriatic Sea, in 1843. The width of the beach, the gentle gradient of the sea bed, the equipment of bathing establishments, the luxurious hotels, the mildness of the climate, the richness of curative waters, the prestigious social events, made Rimini a renowned tourist destination among the Italian and European aristocracy during the Belle Époque.Tourism in Rimini started as therapeutic stay (thalassotherapy, hydrotherapy and heliotherapy), evolving into elite vacation in the late 19th century, into middle-class tourism during the fascist era and finally into mass tourism in the postwar period.

The touristic season in Rimini includes the annual (Pink Night), a weekend cultural festival held in early July that includes exhibitions, music concerts, and firework displays. The festival is held across the , over which it is estimated to attract two million visitors and revenues exceeding . Italy&#x27;s third and fourth oldest theme parks were opened in Rimini: in Rivazzura (1965) and Italia in Miniatura, a miniature park in Viserba (1970).

Rimini concentrates about a quarter of Emilia-Romagna&#x27;s hotels, with over 1,000 hotels, more than 220 of which are open all year round, aside from apartment hotels, apartments, holiday homes, bed &amp; breakfast and campings. Tourism is mainly based on seaside holidays, but also includes events, nightlife, culture, wellness, food and wine.

=== Trade fairs and conventions ===

Rimini is among Italy&#x27;s leading trade fair and convention sites. Relocated in 2001 to the city&#x27;s west, Rimini Fiera comprises sixteen pavilions with of exhibit floor, and hosts trade fairs, sporting events, and musical performances, as well as the annual Rimini Meeting, a religious and cultural festival organised by Communion and Liberation, a lay Catholic movement. The majority of Rimini&#x27;s hotels reopen for the conference season, which provides a flow of visitors to the city outside of the summer beach season. The dates of conferences are also used to set municipal regulations on the touristic season along the riviera.

The Fiera&#x27;s previous site, on Via Monte Titano, was redeveloped in 2011 into Rimini Palacongressi, a smaller conference space. In 2015, the Fiera and Palacongressi were estimated to be worth about a tenth of the province of Rimini&#x27;s gross domestic product.

=== Industry and produce ===
The city&#x27;s other economic sectors, such as services, commerce, construction industry, have been influenced by the development of tourism. Commerce is one of the main economic sectors, thanks to the presence of a large wholesale center, two hypermarkets, department stores, supermarkets and hundreds of shops and boutiques. Industry, less developed than tourism and services, includes various companies active in food industry, woodworking machineries, building constructions, furnishing, clothing and publishing. Notable companies are Bimota (motorcycles), SCM (woodworking machines), Trevi S.p.A. (electronic goods). Rimini is also seat of a historic railway works plant.

Agriculture and fishing were the city&#x27;s main economic sources until the early 20th century. The most common crops, in terms of surface area, are alfalfa, wheat, durum wheat, grape vine, olive tree, barley and sorghum. Among fruit trees dominates apricot, peach and plum trees. Important are the traditional productions of wine (Sangiovese, Trebbiano, Rebola, Pagadebit, Albana wines) and extra virgin olive oil. The fishing industry can count on a fleet of about 100 fishing boats, the most consistent of Rimini&#x27;s fishing department, which includes the coast between Cattolica and Cesenatico.

== Arts and culture ==
=== Museums ===
==== City Museum ====
The City Museum (), is Rimini&#x27;s main and oldest museum. It was inaugurated in 1872 as the Archaeology Gallery, at the ground floor of Palazzo Gambalunga, thanks to Riminese historian Luigi Tonini, who researched and studied the city&#x27;s archaeological heritage. The Archaeology Gallery was conceived as a collection of Etruscan civilization and Roman antiquities, found in Rimini and in the surrounding countryside. In 1923, it moved to the monastery of San Francesco, and was expanded with a section of medieval art in 1938. Its collections avoided the destruction of the Second World War after they were moved to shelters in Spadarolo and Novafeltria. In 1964, the collections moved to Palazzo Visconti and finally, from 1990, to the , a large Jesuit convent designed by Bolognese architect Alfonso Torreggiani, built in 1749.

In the Archaeological department are exhibited grave goods from Villanovian tombs of Verucchio and Covignano, architectural pieces, sculptures, mosaics, ceramics, coins of Republican and Imperial eras, and the exceptional medical kit from the Domus del Chirurgo. The collection of the Roman Lapidary, exhibited in the inner courtyard of the convent, has funerary monuments, epigraphies and milestones.The Medieval and Modern Art departments include collections of paintings, sculptures and art objects by artists from Romagna (Giovanni da Rimini, Giuliano da Rimini, Guido Cagnacci), Emilia (Guercino, Vittorio Maria Bigari), Tuscany (Domenico Ghirlandaio, Agostino di Duccio) and Veneto (Giovanni Bellini), from 14th to 19th century.

=== Theatre and film ===
The first stable theatre in Rimini is documented since 1681, when the city council decided on the transformation of the &#x27;s main hall into a large theatre hall, hosting shows of amateur dramatics companies and the young Carlo Goldoni, who was studying philosophy in Rimini at that time. Between 1842 and 1857, the Teatro Nuovo Comunale, now the Amintori Galli Theatre, was built to a neoclassical design by Luigi Poletti; it is considered one of his architectural masterpieces. On 16 August 1857, the theatre hosted the world premiere of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aroldo,&quot; which was a major event in the city, attracting many foreign visitors. During the Second World War, the theatre was severely damaged by Allied bombardment. Following a complete restoration in the 2010s, the theatre reopened on 28 October 2018.

Rimini appeared on the movie screen for the first time in some early footages, such as the documentary &quot;Rimini l&#x27;Ostenda d&#x27;Italia&quot; (1912), and in various Istituto Luce&#x27;s newsreels in the Thirties. The film director Federico Fellini, was born and raised in Rimini, portrayed characters, places and atmospheres of his hometown through his movies, which however were almost entirely shot in Cinecittà&#x27;s studios in Rome: I Vitelloni, 8 e ½ (Oscar award in 1964), I clowns, Amarcord (Oscar award in 1975).

=== Music ===
The earliest musician from Rimini was Saint Arduino (10th century); a musical tradition of some distinction was witnessed in the following century by the presence of a music school, named &quot;Scuola cantorum&quot;, at the Cathedral of Santa Colomba. French composer Guillaume Dufay stayed in Rimini, at Malatesta&#x27;s court until 1427. In 1518 Pietro Aaron became the first choirmaster of the Cathedral&#x27;s chapel. In 1690 Carlo Tessarini, violinist and composer, was born in Rimini. The city also gave birth to the musician Benedetto Neri, professor at the Academy of Music in Milan. On 16 August 1857, Rimini&#x27;s New Municipal Theatre hosted the world premiere of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aroldo.&quot;

Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many social events and dance parties took place at the Bathing Establishment, hosting celebrities such as soprano Elena Bianchini-Cappelli and tenor Enrico Caruso.

In recent years, the city inspired the homonymous music album by Fabrizio De André, released in 1978, and it is cited in various popular Italian and foreign songs by Fabrizio De André, Francesco Guccini, Nino Rota, Elvis Costello, Fred Buscaglione. Also born in Rimini were the songwriter Samuele Bersani and the composer and music producer Carlo Alberto Rossi, author of some of Mina&#x27;s songs.

=== Cuisine ===
Rimini&#x27;s cuisine is simple and characterized by intense flavours and it is indissolubly related to the traditions of rural culture, influenced by the city&#x27;s location—between the sea and the hills and near the border between Romagna and Marche.

The traditional first course is pasta, which includes regular pasta, pasta in broth and baked pasta, prepared in many different shapes. Almost all pasta dishes require a base of &quot;sfoglia&quot;, a dough of eggs and flour, handmade with a rolling pin. First courses include cappelletti, passatelli in broth, lasagne, cannelloni, nidi di rondine, ravioli, tagliatelle, garganelli, maltagliati, gnocchi and strozzapreti, seasoned with bolognese sauce or a dressing of butter and sage.

Second courses include meat dishes, such as pollo alla cacciatora, rabbit in porchetta, meat-filled zucchini, sausages and mixed grilled meats, and fish dishes, like barbecues of atlantic mackerels, sardines, rotisseries of oily fishes, sepias with peas, fried squids and gianchetti (known here as &quot;omini nudi&quot;).

Piada is a flatbread of ancient traditions, thin and crumbly, obtained from a dough of flour, water, lard and salt, and baked on a scorching &quot;testo&quot; of terracotta or cast iron. It is often accompanied by grilled meats or fishes, sausages, gratinée vegetables, salami, prosciutto, fresh cheeses and country herbs. Cassoni are stuffed flatbreads similar to piada, with various fillings: country herbs, potatoes and sausages, tomato and mozzarella. Side dishes include mixed salads, gratinée vegetables, roasted potatoes, sautée bladder campion leaves, marinated olives with dill, garlic and orange zest.

Traditional desserts are ciambella, Carnevale&#x27;s fried fiocchetti and castagnole, zuppa inglese (a rich dessert with custard, savoiardi and liqueurs), caramelized figs, peaches in white wine and strawberries in red wine. Native to Rimini, &quot;piada dei morti&quot; is a sweet focaccia topped with raisins, almonds, walnuts, and pine nuts, traditionally eaten in November for All Souls&#x27; Day.

Typical local products are squacquerone (a fresh cheese) and saba, a grape syrup used to prepare desserts. Quality extra virgin olive oil is traditionally produced in Rimini area since ancient times. The wines include Sangiovese, Trebbiano, Pagadebit, Rebola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Albana, a dessert wine of Roman origins.

== Cityscape ==
=== Architecture ===
Rimini has a varied historical and artistic heritage which includes churches and monasteries, villas and palaces, fortifications, archaeological sites, streets and squares, as a result of the succession of various civilizations, dominations and historical events through its history, from the Romans to the Byzantines, the medieval &quot;comune&quot;, the Malatesta seignory, the Venetian Republic and the Papal States dominations.

The city has always been a key gate to the Orient and the southern areas of the Mediterranean for the Po Valley, thanks to its geographical position and its harbour, and a meeting point between cultures of Northern and Central Italy.

Rimini has monuments of different eras, with important examples of architecture from the Roman age, such as the Arch of Augustus, the Tiberius Bridge, the Amphitheatre and the Domus del Chirurgo; from the Middle Ages, such as the Palazzo dell&#x27;Arengo, the church of Sant&#x27;Agostino and Castel Sismondo; from the Renaissance, with the Tempio Malatestiano, masterpiece of Leon Battista Alberti.

Rimini&#x27;s archaeological heritage includes some domus of Republican and Imperial age, characterized by polychrome or black and white mosaics, necropolis and sections of the pavement of the ancient Roman streets. The city, along with its boroughs and the seaside district of Marina Centro, also preserves buildings from the Baroque, the Neoclassical and Art Nouveau periods, with churches, palaces, hotels and mansions which reveal its role of cultural and trading centre and seaside resort.

The city centre has a Roman structure, partly modified by following medieval transformations. Urban evolution, through the renovation of the Malatesta, earthquakes and the suppressions of monasteries, has led to a stratification of historic sites and buildings. The bombings of World War II caused extensive destruction and damage, compromising the monumental heritage and the integrity of the city centre, which has been reconstructed and restored in order to valorize its historic places and buildings.

== Transport ==
Rimini is an important road and railway junction due to its geographic position at the southern tip of the Po Valley, where Adriatic coastal routes meet those extending northwest along the plains.

=== Roads ===
Rimini is the terminus of three ancient Roman roads: the Via Flaminia, which runs southeast along the Adriatic Sea, turning at (Fano) to finish in (Rome); the Via Aemilia, which runs northwest to reach (Piacenza); and the Via Popilia, which runs north along the Adriatic Sea to reach (Adria), where it joined the Via Annia. Modern state roads replicate these roads:

* The state road runs from Rimini to San Donato Milanese, replicating the Via Aemilia.
* The state road runs along the Adriatic Sea from Padua to Otranto, replicating the Via Popilia and the coastal section of the Via Flaminia. Bulging inland, the SS16 constitutes Rimini&#x27;s bypass road.

Provincial roads connect Rimini to towns in its hinterland, including Coriano and Montescudo. Two other state roads provide connections to Rimini&#x27;s hinterland:

* The SS72 state road connects Rimini to the border with the Republic of San Marino at Dogana, continuing in Sammarinese territory as the San Marino Highway up to Borgo Maggiore, from which the San Marino cablecar system connects with the City of San Marino.
* The state road connects Rimini to Sansepolcro, in Tuscany, through the valley of the Marecchia.

The tolled A14 Adriatic motorway runs from Bologna to Taranto through Rimini, relieving the SS9 and SS16. Rimini has two exits on the A14: Rimini North, in the locality of San Vito, and Rimini Sud, nearer the city centre, close to where the SS72 meets the SS16. Both exits opened on 13 August 1966 as part of the Cesena–Rimini section. Rimini&#x27;s municipal government supports a new A14 exit onto the SS9 near Santa Giustina to relieve arterial roads near Rimini Fiera; the junction is included in the regional mobility development plan.

=== Railway ===

Rimini railway station is at the midpoint of the Bologna–Ancona railway, and the terminus of the . Regional and national trains of all categories call at the station.

Rimini was formerly the terminus of two disused lines:

* Between 1916 and 1960, the Rimini–Novafeltria railway ran between , opposite the main railway station, and Novafeltria along the Marecchia valley, notably serving Verucchio and Talamello. The line included several stops in Rimini&#x27;s territory.
* Between 1932 and 1944, the Rimini–San Marino railway connected Rimini to the City of San Marino through the Sammarinese towns of Dogana, Serravalle, Domagnano, and Borgo Maggiore. The line included a station and depot on Via Giovanni Pascoli, known as Rimini Marina. Both the Sammarinese and Italian governments have expressed interest in reopening the line.

Rimini has four minor railway stations that are served by regional trains: Torre Pedrera and Viserba on the Ferrara–Rimini railway; and Rimini Fiera and Rimini Miramare on the Bologna–Ancona railway.

=== Aviation ===

The city is served by Rimini Fellini Airport, in the southern suburb of Miramare. The airport is a crucial nexus in the local economy, particularly for tourists visiting the . It recorded 215,767 passengers in 2022, rendering it the second-busiest airport in Emilia-Romagna. The airport is mainly served by low-cost carriers and charter traffic.

The airport was built in 1929 as an aerodrome, on the site of the former of the army&#x27;s Aeronautical Service. It ranked among Italy&#x27;s busiest airports during the 1960s, supported by international tourists visiting Rimini&#x27;s beaches. Its passenger use declined with the opening of the A14 tolled highway in 1966. Since the end of the Cold War, Fellini Airport has been specially popular among tourists from the countries of the former Soviet Union. Russian and Ukrainian passengers together represented 61% of Fellini Airport&#x27;s passengers before the 2022 invasion, which was projected to lose the airport 300,000 passengers annually. Alongside its civilian history, the airport has a notable military history: it was the home of the of the Italian Air Force between 1956 and 2010, and during the Cold War, it was identified by the Warsaw Pact as a strategic target in the event of an all-out war, housing several thousand Italian and NATO soldiers and thirty B61 nuclear bombs. Helicopters belonging to the 7th Army Aviation Regiment &quot;Vega&quot; remain at the airport.

After Fellini Airport, the closest major airports are Luigi Ridolfi Airport in Forlì, Raffaello Sanzio Airport in Ancona, and Guglielmo Marconi Airport in Bologna. A coach service operated by Shuttle Italy Airport connects Rimini with Bologna Airport.

Between 1959 and 1969, a helicopter service flew between Rimini&#x27;s port and a heliport next to Borgo Maggiore&#x27;s cablecar terminus in San Marino. Operated by Compagnia Italiana Elicotteri, the service ran several times per day, using a fleet of four-seater Bell 47J Rangers and a three-seater Agusta-Bell AB-47G, which were serviced at Rimini&#x27;s airport. In 1964, the line was extended to San Leo. Tickets would cost up to 12,500 lire, including the cablecar to the City of San Marino and a shuttle to the Leonine fortress. The service would take fifteen minutes to reach Borgo Maggiore and twenty-five minutes to reach San Leo.

=== Buses and coaches ===
Rimini and Riccione&#x27;s combined bus network, operated by Start Romagna SpA, includes twenty-two suburban lines and twenty-six interurban lines. As well as serving the city&#x27;s suburbs, the lines connect Rimini to towns and villages in the hinterland and to neighbouring along the Adriatic coast.

Rimini&#x27;s trolleybus system comprises two trolleybus lines that connect the city centres of Rimini and Riccione; both are run by Start Romagna SpA. Route 11 runs from Rimini&#x27;s railway station to Riccione Terme along the principal seafront avenue, serving the touristic seafront. The line originated as a horse-drawn omibus service in 1844, running between Rimini and the present-day Parco Federico Fellini. It was converted to a horse-drawn tram in 1877, and electrified in 1921. Between 1921 and 1927, it was progressively extended southwards to reach Riccione, and converted to a trolleybus line in 1939.

The newer trolleybus route, Metromare, launched on 23 November 2019, provisionally using motorbuses because of a delay in the delivery of the trolleybus fleet. The bus rapid transit line runs on a segregated track adjacent to the Bologna-Ancona railway between the stations of Rimini and Riccione. Intermediate stops serve the Fiabilandia amusement park in Rivazzurra, Miramare&#x27;s railway station, and Federico Fellini International Airport. The trolleybuses entered service on the line on 28 October 2021. A northern extension to Rimini Fiera has been approved, with construction starting in summer 2024.

Rimini is served by six FlixBus stops; its principal stop, on Via Annabile Fada, is served by international routes. Local companies, including Bonelli Bus, Autolinee Benedettini, and Adriabus, provide regular and seasonal coach services to other Italian cities, San Marino, and regional historic sites such as Urbino and Gradara.

== Utilities ==
HERA Group (), a multi-utility company based in Bologna, is responsible for the province of Rimini&#x27;s gas, water, energy, and waste management.

Rimini has three ecological stations () for waste sorting: Rimini Viserba, between the coastline and Italia in Miniatura; Rimini Via Nataloni, west of the city centre; and Rimini Via Macanno, south of Le Befane shopping centre.

Rimini is served by the wastewater treatment plant of Rimini-Santa Giustina, which serves eleven municipalities and the Republic of San Marino. The plant has a water flow rate of , and capable of treating the equivalent of 560,000 inhabitants in the summer and 370,000 inhabitants the winter. The purification plant was inaugurated on 31 May 1972, and doubled in capacity between 2013 and 2015, to become Europe&#x27;s largest purifier.

In 2013, the municipal government, HERA, and Romagna Acque instituted an eleven-year, 154-million-euro Optimised Bathing Protection Plan (). The plan sought to reduce sewage discharges into the sea after rainfall or thunderstorms, which would lead to temporary bathing bans along Rimini&#x27;s coastline, hurting its tourist economy. A rainwater collection tank, with a capacity, and a lamination tank, with a capacity, was installed under Piazzale Kennedy. As part of the plan, Rimini&#x27;s sewage system was remodelled between 2014 and 2020.

== Sports ==
The main football team of the city is Rimini Calcio. It played for nine years (between 1976 and 2009) in Serie B, the second-highest division in the Italian football league system. Its better positioning was the fifth place of the 2006–07 season (when Rimini was also undefeated in both games against Juventus).

Rimini has also a notable basketball team, the Basket Rimini Crabs, which played for several years in Serie A and two times in the European Korać Cup. About baseball, Rimini Baseball Club won 12 national championships and it was also European champion three times.

Every Easter weekend, Rimini hosts Paganello, a beach ultimate tournament. First held in 1991, the event takes place over a stretch of beach, between beaches 39 and 47. In 2023, the competition included 136 teams and 1,600 athletes. The tournament runs between Maundy Thursday and Easter Monday, and is accompanied by cultural shows along Rimini&#x27;s beach. There are two competitions: a Frisbee tournament, and the Freestyle, which is more acrobatic.

<text>The International Commission on Illumination (usually abbreviated CIE for its French name Commission internationale de l&#x27;éclairage) is the international authority on light, illumination, colour, and colour spaces. It was established in 1913 as a successor to the Commission Internationale de Photométrie, which was founded in 1900, and is today based in Vienna, Austria.

==Organization==
The CIE has six active divisions, each of which establishes technical committees to carry out its program:

* Division 1: Vision and Colour 
* Division 2: Physical Measurement of Light and Radiation 
* Division 3: Interior Environment and Lighting Design 
* Division 4: Transportation and Exterior Applications 
* Division 6: Photobiology and Photochemistry 
* Division 8: Image Technology 
Two divisions are no longer active.

* Division 5: Exterior Lighting and Other Applications 
* Division 7: General Aspects of Lighting 

The President of the CIE from 2023 is Jennifer Veitch from Canada.

CIE publishes Technical Reports (TRs), International Standards (ISs) and Technical Notes (TNs). International Standards (ISs) are often further developed as dual standards with the ISO or IEC.

==Milestones==
* In 1924 it established the standard photopic observer defined by the spectral luminous efficiency function &quot;V&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;), followed in 1951 by the standard scotopic observer defined by the function &quot;V&quot;’(&quot;λ&quot;).
* Building on the Optical Society of America&#x27;s report on colorimetry in 1922, the CIE convened its eighth session in 1931, with the intention of establishing an international agreement on colorimetric specifications and updating the OSA&#x27;s 1922 recommendations based on the developments during the past decade. The meeting, held in Cambridge, United Kingdom, concluded with the formalization of the CIE 1931 XYZ color space &amp; RGB color space and definitions of the 1931 CIE 2° standard observer with the corresponding color matching functions, and standard illuminants A, B, and C.

* In 1964 the 10° CIE standard observer and its corresponding color matching functions as well as the new standard daylight illuminant D6500 were added, as well as a method for calculating daylight illuminants at correlated color temperatures other than 6500 kelvins.
* In 1976, the commission developed the CIELAB and CIELUV color spaces, which are widely used today.
* Based on CIELAB, color difference formulas CIEDE94 and CIEDE2000 were recommended in the corresponding years.

<text>The pre-history of Vietnam can be traced back to the arrival of Ancient East Eurasian hunter-gatherers that arrived at least 40,000 years ago. As part of the Initial Upper Paleolithic wave, the Hoabinhians, along with the Tianyuan man, are early members of the Ancient Basal East and Southeast Asian lineage deeply related to present-day East and Southeast Asians. Human migration into Vietnam continued during the Neolithic period, characterized by movements of Southern East Asian populations that expanded from Southern China into Vietnam and Southeast Asia. See also Genetic history of East Asians. The earliest agricultural societies that cultivated millet and wet-rice emerged around 1700 BCE in the lowlands and river floodplains of Vietnam are associated with this Neolithic migration, indicated by the presences of major paternal lineages that are represented by East Eurasian-affiliated Y-haplogroups O, C2, and N.

The Red River valley formed a natural geographic and economic unit, bounded to the north and west by mountains and jungles, to the east by the sea and to the south by the Red River Delta. The need to have a single authority to prevent floods of the Red River, to cooperate in constructing hydraulic systems, trade exchange, and to repel invaders, led to the creation of the first legendary Vietnamese states approximately 2879 BC. Ongoing research from archaeologists has suggested that the Vietnamese Đông Sơn culture were traceable back to northern Vietnam, Guangxi and Laos around 1000 BC.

Vietnam&#x27;s long coastal and narrowed lands, rugged mountainous terrains, with two major deltas, were soon home to several different ancient cultures and civilizations. In the north, the Dong Son culture and its indigenous chiefdoms of Văn Lang and Âu Lạc flourished by 500 BC. In Central Vietnam, the Sa Huỳnh culture of Austronesian Chamic peoples also thrived. Both were swept away by the Han dynasty expansion from the north, with the Han conquest of Nanyue bringing parts of Vietnam under Chinese rule in 111 BC. In 40 AD, the Trưng sisters led the first uprising of indigenous tribes and peoples against Chinese domination. The rebellion was defeated, but as the Han dynasty began to weaken by the late 2nd century AD and China started to descend into a state of turmoil, the indigenous peoples of Vietnam rose again and some became free. In 192 AD, the Cham of Central Vietnam revolted against the Chinese and subsequently formed the independent kingdom of Champa, while the Red River Delta saw a loosening of Chinese control. At that time, with the introduction of Buddhism and Hinduism by the 2nd century AD, Vietnam was the first place in Southeast Asia which shared influences of both Chinese and Indian cultures, and the rise of the first Indianized kingdoms Champa and Funan.

During these 1,000 years there were many uprisings against Chinese domination, and at certain periods Vietnam was independently governed under the Trưng Sisters, Early Lý, Khúc and Dương Đình Nghệ—although their triumphs and reigns were temporary. When Ngô Quyền (King of Vietnam, 939–944) restored sovereign power in the country after the victory at the battle of Bạch Đằng, the next millennium was advanced by the accomplishments of successive local dynasties: Ngô, Đinh, Early Lê, Lý, Trần, Hồ, Later Trần, Later Lê, Mạc, Revival Lê (Trịnh and Nguyễn), Tây Sơn, and Nguyễn. At various points during the imperial dynasties, Vietnam was ravaged and divided by civil wars and witnessed interventions by the Song, Yuan, Cham, Ming, Siamese, Qing, French, and Imperial Japan. Vietnam also conquered and colonized the Champa states and parts of Cambodia (today known as the Mekong Delta) between 1471 and 1760.

The Chinese Ming Empire conquered and had ruled Vietnam for a while before native Vietnamese regained control. France reduced Vietnam to a French dependency in 1883, followed by an occupation of Japanese army. Political upheaval and communist insurrection put an end to the monarchy after World War II, and the country was proclaimed a republic in 1945. Internal conflicts between communists and non-communists broke out immediately. The French returned to Indochina and a conflict broke out. France recognized partial independence of the anti-communist State of Vietnam in 1949 and full independence in June 1954, but French defeat led to the communists taking power in the North in July. A war between the two Vietnams broke out and ended with the defeat of the South in 1975. Vietnam was unified under communism in 1976.

== Pre-historic period ==


Vietnam is a multi-ethnic country on Mainland Southeast Asia and has great ethnolinguistic diversity. Vietnam&#x27;s demography consists of 54 different ethnicities belonging to five major ethnolinguistic families: Austronesian, Austroasiatic, Hmong-Mien, Kra-Dai, Sino-Tibetan. Among 54 groups, the majority ethnic group is the Vietic-speaking Kinh, alone comprising 85.32% of total population in the 2019 census. The rest is made up of 53 other ethnic groups. Vietnam&#x27;s ethnic mosaic results from the peopling process in which various peoples came and settled the territory, leading to the modern state of Vietnam by many stages, often separated by thousands of years over a duration of tens of thousands of years. Vietnam&#x27;s entire history, thus, is an embroidery of polyethnicity.

Holocene Vietnam began during the Late Pleistocene period. Early anatomically modern human settlement in Mainland Southeast Asia dates back 65 to 10,5 kya (65,000 years ago). Probably the foremost hunter-gatherers were the Hoabinhians, a large group that gradually settled across Southeast Asia. An analysis of individuals from the Con Co Ngua site in Thanh Hoa, Vietnam about 6.2 k cal BP, when restricted to Vietnamese comparisons, showed the closest distance to peoples from Mai Da Dieu, followed by present-day Vietnamese populations. Based on craniometric and dental nonmetric analysis, the Con Co Ngua individuals were phenotypically similar to Late Pleistocene Southeast Asians and modern Melanesians and Aboriginal Australians.

Starting from the third millennium BCE, rice farming-based agriculture spread from southern East Asia into Mainland and Insular Southeast Asia. This technological spread was a result of the migration of East Asian agriculturalists that carried Ancient Southern East Asian ancestry. These Neolithic farmers took two routes: an inland route into Mainland Southeast Asia carried out by Austroasiatic speakers, and a maritime route that originated from Taiwan by Austronesian speakers. In 2018, researchers conducted a genetic analysis on samples taken two ancient burial sites in Northern Vietnam, Mán Bạc and Núi Nấp, dating from 1,800 BCE and 100 BCE, respectively. The individuals at Mán Bạc show a mix of East Asian farmer and east Eurasian hunter-gatherer ancestry, with close genetic affinity for modern Austroasiatic groups like the Mlabri, the Nicobarese, and the Cambodians, while Nui Nap projects close to present-day Vietnamese and Dai. A 2018 study by George van Driem et al. demonstrated that East Asian farmers intermixed with the native inhabitants and contrary to popular opinion, did not replace them. These farmers also shared ancestry with present-day Austroasiatic-speaking hill tribes themselves. 

The Cham people, who for over one thousand years settled in controlled and civilized present-day central and southern coastal Vietnam from around the 2nd century AD, are of Austronesian origin. The southernmost sector of modern Vietnam, the Mekong Delta and its surroundings were, until the 18th century, of integral yet shifting significance within the Austroasiatic Proto-Khmer – and Khmer principalities like Funan, Chenla, the Khmer Empire and the Khmer kingdom.

Situated on the southeast edge of monsoon Asia, much of ancient Vietnam enjoyed a combination of high rainfall, humidity, heat, favorable winds, and fertile soil. These natural sources combined to generate an unusually prolific growth of rice and other plants and wildlife. This region&#x27;s agricultural villages held well over 90 percent of the population. The high volume of rainy season water required villagers to concentrate their labor in managing floods, transplanting rice, and harvesting. These activities produced a cohesive village life with a religion in which one of the core values was the desire to live in harmony with nature and with other people. The way of life, centered in harmony, featured many enjoyable aspects that the people held beloved, typified by not needing many material things, the enjoyment of music and poetry, and living in harmony with nature.

Fishing and hunting supplemented the main rice crop. Arrowheads and spears were dipped in poison to kill larger animals such as elephants. Betel nuts were widely chewed and the lower classes rarely wore clothing more substantial than a loincloth. Every spring, a fertility festival was held which featured huge parties and sexual abandon.
Since around 2000 BC, stone hand tools and weapons improved extraordinarily in both quantity and variety. After this, Vietnam later became part of the Maritime Jade Road, which existed for 3,000 years between 2000 BC to 1000 AD. Pottery reached a higher level of technique and decoration style. The early farming multilinguistic societies in Vietnam were mainly wet rice Oryza cultivators, which became the main staple of their diet. During the later stage of the first half of the 2nd millennium BC, the first appearance of bronze tools took place despite these tools still being rare. By about 1000 BC, bronze replaced stone for about 40 percent of edged tools and weapons, rising to about 60 percent. Here, there were not only bronze weapons, axes, and personal ornaments, but also sickles and other agriculture tools. Toward the closure of the Bronze Age, bronze accounts for more than 90 percent of tools and weapons, and there are exceptionally extravagant graves – the burial places of powerful chieftains – containing some hundreds of ritual and personal bronze artifacts, such as musical instruments, bucket-shaped ladles, and ornament daggers. After 1000 BC, the ancient peoples of Vietnam became skilled agriculturalists as they grew rice and kept buffaloes and pigs. They were also skilled fishermen and bold sailors, whose long dug-out canoes traversed the eastern sea.

== Ancient period (c. 500–111 BC) ==


=== Đông Sơn culture and the Legend of Hồng Bàng dynasty ===
According to a Vietnamese legend which first appeared in the 14th century book &quot;Lĩnh nam chích quái&quot;, the tribal chief Lộc Tục (c. 2919 – 2794 BC) proclaimed himself as Kinh Dương Vương and founded the state of Xích Quỷ in 2879 BC, that marks the beginning of the Hồng Bàng dynastic period. However, modern Vietnamese historians assume, that statehood was only developed in the Red River Delta by the second half of 1st millennium BC. Kinh Dương Vương was succeeded by Sùng Lãm (c. 2825 BC – ?). The next royal dynasty produced 18 monarchs, known as the Hùng Kings, who renamed their country Văn Lang. The administrative system includes offices like military chief (&quot;lạc tướng&quot;), paladin (&quot;lạc hầu&quot;) and mandarin (&quot;bố chính&quot;).

Great numbers of metal weapons and tools excavated at various Phung Nguyen culture sites in northern Indochina are associated with the beginning of the Copper Age in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, the beginning of the Bronze Age has been verified for around 500 BC at Đông Sơn. Vietnamese historians usually attribute the Đông Sơn culture with the kingdoms of Văn Lang, Âu Lạc, and the Hồng Bàng dynasty. The local Lạc Việt community had developed a highly sophisticated industry of quality bronze production, processing and the manufacturing of tools, weapons and exquisite Bronze drums. Certainly of symbolic value, they were intended to be used for religious or ceremonial purposes. The craftsmen of these objects required refined skills in melting techniques, in the lost-wax casting technique and acquired master skills of composition and execution for the elaborate engravings.
The Legend of Thánh Gióng tells of a youth, who leads the Văn Lang kingdom to victory against the Ân invaders from the north, saves the country and goes straight to heaven. He wears iron armor, rides an armored horse and wields an iron sword. The image implies a society of a certain sophistication in metallurgy as well as An Dương Vương&#x27;s &quot;Legend of the Magic Crossbow&quot;, a weapon, that can fire thousands of bolts simultaneously, seems to hint at the extensive use of archery in warfare. The about 1,000 traditional craft villages of the Hồng River Delta near and around Hanoi represented throughout more than 2,000 years of Vietnamese history the national industrial and economic backbone. Countless, mostly small family run manufacturers have over the centuries preserved their ethnic ideas by producing highly sophisticated goods, built temples and dedicated ceremonies and festivals in an unbroken culture of veneration for these legendary popular spirits.

=== Âu Lạc kingdom (257–179 BC) ===
By the 3rd century BC, another Viet group, the Âu Việt, emigrated from present-day southern China to the Hồng River delta and mixed with the indigenous Văn Lang population. In 257 BC, a new kingdom, Âu Lạc, emerged as the union of the Âu Việt and the Lạc Việt, with Thục Phán proclaiming himself &quot;An Dương Vương&quot; (&quot;King An Dương&quot;). Some modern Vietnamese believe that Thục Phán came upon the Âu Việt territory (modern-day northernmost Vietnam, western Guangdong, and southern Guangxi province, with its capital in what is today Cao Bằng Province).

After assembling an army, he defeated and overthrew the eighteenth dynasty of the Hùng kings, in 257 BC. He then renamed his newly acquired state from Văn Lang to Âu Lạc and established the new capital at Phong Khê in the present-day Phú Thọ town in northern Vietnam, where he tried to build the Cổ Loa Citadel (Cổ Loa Thành), the spiral fortress approximately ten miles north of that new capital. However, records showed that espionage resulted in the downfall of An Dương Vương. At his capital, Cổ Loa, he built many concentric walls around the city for defensive purposes. These walls, together with skilled Âu Lạc archers, kept the capital safe from invaders.

=== Nanyue (179 BC–111 BC) ===
In 207 BC, the former Qin general Zhao Tuo (Triệu Đà in Vietnamese) established an independent kingdom in the present-day Guangdong/Guangxi area of China&#x27;s southern coast. He proclaimed his new kingdom as Nam Việt (&quot;pinyin:&quot; Nanyue), to be ruled by the Zhao dynasty. Zhao Tuo later appointed himself a commandant of central Guangdong, closing the borders and conquering neighboring districts and titled himself &quot;King of Nanyue&quot;. In 179 BC, he defeated King An Dương Vương and annexed Âu Lạc.

The period has been given some controversial conclusions by Vietnamese historians, as some consider Zhao&#x27;s rule as the starting point of the Chinese domination, since Zhao Tuo was a former Qin general; whereas others consider it still an era of Vietnamese independence as the Zhao family in Nanyue were assimilated into local culture. They ruled independently of what then constituted the Han Empire. At one point, Zhao Tuo even declared himself Emperor, equal to the Han Emperor in the north.

== Chinese rule (111 BC–AD 939) ==
=== First Chinese domination (111 BC–AD 40) ===

In 111 BC, the Chinese Han dynasty conquered Nanyue and established its new territories, dividing Vietnam into &quot;Giao Chỉ&quot; (&quot;pinyin&quot;: Jiaozhi), i.e. the Red River Delta; &quot;Cửu Chân&quot; from Thanh Hóa to Hà Tĩnh; and &quot;Nhật Nam&quot; (&quot;pinyin&quot;: Rinan), from Quảng Bình to Huế. While governors and top officials were Chinese, the original Vietnamese nobles (Lạc Hầu, Lạc Tướng) from the Hồng Bàng period still managed in some of the highlands. During this period, Buddhism was introduced into Vietnam from India via the Maritime Silk Road, while Taoism and Confucianism spread to Vietnam through the Chinese rules.

=== Trưng Sisters&#x27; rebellion (40–43) ===

In February AD 40, the Trưng Sisters led a successful revolt against Han Governor Su Ding (&quot;Vietnamese:&quot; Tô Định) and recaptured 65 states (including modern Guangxi). Trưng Trắc, angered by the killing of her husband by Su Dung, led the revolt together with her sister, Trưng Nhị. Trưng Trắc later became the Queen (Trưng Nữ Vương). In 43 AD, Emperor Guangwu of Han sent his famous general Ma Yuan (&quot;Vietnamese:&quot; Mã Viện) with a large army to quell the revolt. After a long, difficult campaign, Ma Yuan suppressed the uprising and the Trung Sisters committed suicide to avoid capture. To this day, the Trưng Sisters are revered in Vietnam as the national symbol of Vietnamese women.

=== Second Chinese domination (43–544) ===
Learning a lesson from the Trưng revolt, the Han and other successful Chinese dynasties took measures to eliminate the power of the Vietnamese nobles. The Vietnamese elites were educated in Chinese culture and politics. A Giao Chỉ prefect, Shi Xie, ruled Vietnam as an autonomous warlord for forty years and was posthumously deified by later Vietnamese monarchs. Shi Xie pledged loyalty to Eastern Wu of the Three Kingdoms era of China. The Eastern Wu was a formative period in Vietnamese history. According to Stephen O&#x27;Harrow, Shi Xie was essentially &quot;the first Vietnamese&quot;. Nearly 200 years passed before the Vietnamese attempted another revolt. In 248 a Yue woman, Triệu Thị Trinh with her brother Triệu Quốc Đạt, popularly known as Lady Triệu (Bà Triệu), led a revolt against the Wu dynasty. Once again, the uprising failed. Eastern Wu sent Lu Yin and 8,000 elite soldiers to suppress the rebels. He managed to pacify the rebels with a combination of threats and persuasion. According to the &quot;Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư&quot; (Complete Annals of Đại Việt), Lady Triệu had long hair that reached her shoulders and rode into battle on an elephant. After several months of warfare she was defeated and committed suicide.

=== Early Cham kingdoms (192–7th century) ===
At the same time, in present-day Central Vietnam, there was a successful revolt of Cham nations in 192. Chinese dynasties called it Lin-Yi (Lin village; Vietnamese: &quot;Lâm Ấp&quot;). It later became a powerful kingdom, Champa, stretching from Quảng Bình to Phan Thiết (Bình Thuận). The Cham developed the first native writing system in Southeast Asia, oldest surviving literature of any Southeast Asian language, leading Buddhist, Hindu, and cultural expertise in the region.

=== Funan kingdom (1st century–627) ===

In the early first century AD, on the lower Mekong, the first Indianized kingdom of Southeast Asia which the Chinese called them &quot;Funan&quot; emerged and became the great economic power in the region, its prime city Óc Eo attracted merchants and craftmen from China, India, and even Rome. The first ruler of Funan, Queen Liǔyè, got married with Kaundinya, a man from the west with a magic bow. Kaundinya then became the ruler of Funan. Funan is said to be the first Khmer state, or Austronesian, or multiethnic. According to Chinese annals, the last king of Funan, Rudravarman (r. 514–545) sent many embassies to China. Also according to Chinese annals, Funan might have been conquered by another kingdom called Zhenla around AD 627, ending the kingdom of Funan.

=== Kingdom of Vạn Xuân (544–602) ===

In the period between the beginning of the Chinese Age of Fragmentation and the end of the Tang dynasty, several revolts against Chinese rule took place, such as those of Lý Bôn and his general and heir Triệu Quang Phục. All of them ultimately failed, yet most notable were those led by Lý Bôn and Triệu Quang Phục, who ruled the briefly independent Van Xuan kingdom for almost half a century, from 544 to 602, before Sui China reconquered the kingdom.

=== Golden Age of Cham Civilization and wars with Angkor Empire (7th century–1203) ===

The Cham Lâm Ấp kingdom, with capital located in Simhapura, became prosperous through benefiting from the ancient maritime trade routes from the Middle East to China. The wealthy of Lâm Ấp attracted attention from the Chinese Empire. In 605, emperor Yang Guang of the Sui Empire ordered general Liu Fang, who had just reconquered and pacificed northern Vietnam, to invade Lâm Ấp. The kingdom was quickly overwhelmed by the invaders who pillaged and looted Cham sanctuaries. Despite that, king Sambhuvarman of Lâm Ấp (r. 572–629) quickly reasserted his independence, beginning the unified period of Champa in 629.

From the 7th to the 10th centuries, the Cham controlled the trade in spices and silk between China, India, the Indonesian islands, and the Abbasid empire in Baghdad. They supplemented their income from the trade routes not only by exporting ivory and aloe, but also by engaging in piracy and raiding. This period of prosperity and cultural flourishing is often referred to as the golden age of Champa.

In 875, a new Mahayana Buddhist monarch named Indravarman II (r. 854–893) founded a new dynasty with Buddhism as state religion. Indravarman II built a new capital city in Indrapura (modern-day Quảng Nam) and a large Buddhist temple in Dong Duong. The dynasty of Indravarman II continued to rule until the late 10th century, when a Vietnamese invasion in 982 murdered the ruling king Jaya Paramesvaravarman I (r. 972–982). A Vietnamese usurper named Lưu Kế Tông took advance of unsettling situation and seized Indrapura in 983, declared himself the king of Champa in 986, disrupted the Cham kingdom. In Vijaya (present-day Binh Dinh) from the south, a new Hindu dynasty was founded in 989 and relocated Cham capital to Vijaya in 1000.

Champa and the emerging Khmer Empire had waged war on each other for three centuries, from the 10th to 13th century. The Khmer first invaded Champa in Kauthara (Khanh Hoa) in 950. In 1080, they attacked Vijaya and central Champa. The Cham under Harivarman IV launched counteroffensive against the Cambodian and plundered temples across east of the Mekong river. Tensions escalated during the next century. Suryavarman II of Khmer Empire invaded Champa in 1145 and 1149 after Cham ruler Indravarman refused to join with the Khmer campaign against the Vietnamese. It was believed that Suryavarman II died during the war against Champa in 1150. In 1177 Cham king Jaya Indravarman IV led a surprised attacked on Khmer capital Yasodharapura (Angkor) and defeated them at the Battle of Tonlé Sap.

The new Cambodian ruler, Jayavarman VII, arose to power, repelled the Cham and began his conquest of Champa in 1190. He finally defeated the Cham in 1203 and put Champa under Khmer governance for 17 years. In 1220, as the Khmer voluntary withdraw from Champa, a Cham prince named Angsaraja proclaimed Jaya Paramesvaravarman II of Champa and restored Cham independence.

Champa expanded its commerce to the Philippines in the 1200s. The &quot;History of Song&quot; notes that to the east of Champa through a two-day journey lay the country of Ma-i, at Mindoro, Philippines; while Pu-duan (Butuan) at Mindanao, need a seven-day journey, and there were mentions of Cham commercial activities in Butuan. Butuan resented Champa commercial supremacy and their king, Rajah Kiling spearheaded a diplomatic rivalry for China trade against Champa hegemony. Meanwhile, at the nation of the future Sultanate of Sulu which by then was still Hindu, there was a mass migration of men from Champa and they were locally known as Orang Dampuan, and they caused conflicts (which were then resolved) with the local Sulu people. They became the ancestors of the local Yakan people.

=== Third Chinese domination (602–AD 905) ===
During the Tang dynasty, Vietnam was called Annam until AD 866. With its capital around Bắc Ninh, Annam became a flourishing trading outpost, receiving goods from the southern seas. The &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; recorded that in 166 the first envoy from the Roman Empire to China arrived by this route, and merchants were soon to follow. The 3rd-century &quot;Tales of Wei&quot; (&quot;Weilüe&quot;) mentioned a &quot;water route&quot; (the Red River) from Annam into what is now southern Yunnan. From there, goods were taken over land to the rest of China via the regions of modern Kunming and Chengdu. The capital of Annam, Tống Bình or Songping (today Hanoi) was a major urbanized settlement in the southwest region of Tang Empire. From 858 to 864, disturbances in Annan gave Nanzhao, a Yunnan kingdom, opportunity to intervene the region, provoking local tribes to revolt against the Chinese. The Yunnanese and their local allies launched the Siege of Songping in early 863, defeating the Chinese, and captured the capital in three years. In 866, Chinese jiedushi Gao Pian recaptured the city and drove out the Nanzhao army. He renamed the city to Daluocheng (大羅城, Đại La thành).

In 866, Annan was renamed Tĩnh Hải quân. Early in the 10th century, as China became politically fragmented, successive lords from the Khúc clan, followed by Dương Đình Nghệ, ruled Tĩnh Hải quân autonomously under the Tang title of Jiedushi (&quot;Vietnamese&quot;: Tiết Độ Sứ), (governor), but stopped short of proclaiming themselves kings.

=== Autonomous era (905–939) ===
Since 905, Tĩnh Hải circuit had been ruled by local Vietnamese governors like an autonomous state. Tĩnh Hải circuit had to paid tributes for Later Liang dynasty to exchange political protection. In 923, the nearby Southern Han invaded Jinghai but was repelled by Vietnamese leader Dương Đình Nghệ. In 938, the Chinese state Southern Han once again sent a fleet to subdue the Vietnamese. General Ngô Quyền (r. 939–944), Dương Đình Nghệ&#x27;s son-in-law, defeated the Southern Han fleet at the Battle of Bạch Đằng (938). He then proclaimed himself King Ngô, established a monarchy government in Cổ Loa and effectively began the age of independence for Vietnam.

== Dynastic period (939–1945) ==


The basic nature of Vietnamese society changed little during the nearly 1,000 years between independence from China in the 10th century and the French conquest in the 19th century. Viet Nam, named Đại Việt (Great Viet) was a stable nation, but village autonomy was a key feature. Villages had a unified culture centered around harmony related to the religion of the spirits of nature and the peaceful nature of Buddhism. While the sovereign was the ultimate source of political authority, a saying was, &quot;The Sovereign&#x27;s Laws end at the village gate&quot;. The sovereign was the final dispenser of justice, law, and supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces, as well as overseer of religious rituals. Administration was carried out by mandarins who were trained exactly like their Chinese counterparts (i.e. by rigorous study of Confucian texts). Overall, Vietnam remained very efficiently and stably governed except in times of war and dynastic breakdown. Its administrative system was probably far more advanced than that of any other Southeast Asian states and was more highly centralized and stably governed among Asian states. No serious challenge to the sovereign&#x27;s authority ever arose, as titles of nobility were bestowed purely as honors and were not hereditary. Periodic land reforms broke up large estates and ensured that powerful landowners could not emerge. No religious/priestly class ever arose outside of the mandarins either. This stagnant absolutism ensured a stable, well-ordered society, but also resistance to social, cultural, or technological innovations. Reformers looked only to the past for inspiration.

Literacy remained the province of the upper classes. Originally, only Chữ Hán was used to write, but by the 11th century, a set of derivative characters known as Chữ Nôm emerged that allowed native Vietnamese words to be written. However, it remained limited to poetry, literature, and practical texts like medicine while all state and official documents were written in Classical Chinese. Aside from some mining and fishing, agriculture was the primary activity of most Vietnamese, and economic development and trade were not promoted or encouraged by the state.

=== First Dai Viet period ===
==== Ngô, Đinh, &amp; Early Lê dynasties (939–1009) ====

Ngô Quyền in 939 declared himself king, but died after only 6 years. His untimely death after a short reign resulted in a power struggle for the throne, resulting in the country&#x27;s first major civil war, the upheaval of the Twelve Warlords (&quot;Loạn Thập Nhị Sứ Quân&quot;). The war lasted from 944 to 968, until the clan led by Đinh Bộ Lĩnh defeated the other warlords, unifying the country. Đinh Bộ Lĩnh founded the Đinh dynasty in 968 and proclaimed himself Đinh Tiên Hoàng (Đinh the Majestic Emperor) and renamed the country from Tĩnh Hải quân to Đại Cồ Việt (literally &quot;Great Viet&quot;), with its capital in the city of Hoa Lư (Ninh Bình Province). In relations with China since Đinh Bộ Lĩnh, Vietnamese dynasties had considered their leaders &quot;kings&quot; although they had still implicitly considered their leaders emperors. 

In 979, Emperor Đinh Tiên Hoàng and his crown prince Đinh Liễn were assassinated by Đỗ Thích, a government official, leaving his lone surviving son, the 6-year-old Đinh Toàn, to assume the throne. Taking advantage of the situation, the Song dynasty invaded Đại Cồ Việt. Facing such a grave threat to national independence, the commander of the armed forces, (Thập Đạo Tướng Quân) Lê Hoàn took the throne, replaced the house of Đinh and established the Early Lê dynasty. A capable military tactician, Lê Hoan realized the risks of engaging the mighty Song troops head on; thus, he tricked the invading army into Chi Lăng Pass, then ambushed and killed their commander, quickly ending the threat to his young nation in 981. The Song dynasty withdrew their troops and Lê Hoàn was referred to in his realm as Emperor Đại Hành (Đại Hành Hoàng Đế). Emperor Lê Đại Hành was also the first Vietnamese monarch who began the southward expansion process against the kingdom of Champa.

Emperor Lê Đại Hành&#x27;s death in 1005 resulted in infighting for the throne amongst his sons. The eventual winner, Lê Long Đĩnh, became the most notorious tyrant in Vietnamese history. He devised sadistic punishments of prisoners for his own entertainment and indulged in deviant sexual activities. Toward the end of his short lifehe died at the age of 24 – Lê Long Đĩnh had become so ill, that he had to lie down when meeting with his officials in court.

==== Lý dynasty, Trần dynasty &amp; Hồ dynasty (1009–1407) ====

When the emperor Lê Long Đĩnh died in 1009, a palace guard commander named Lý Công Uẩn was nominated by the court to take over the throne, and founded the Lý dynasty. This event is regarded as the beginning of another golden era in Vietnamese history, with the following dynasties inheriting the Lý dynasty&#x27;s prosperity and doing much to maintain and expand it. The way Lý Công Uẩn ascended to the throne was rather uncommon in Vietnamese history. As a high-ranking military commander residing in the capital, he had all opportunities to seize power during the tumultuous years after Emperor Lê Hoàn&#x27;s death, yet preferring not to do so out of his sense of duty. He was in a way being &quot;elected&quot; by the court after some debate before a consensus was reached.
The Lý monarchs are credited for laying down a concrete foundation for the nation of Vietnam. In 1010, Lý Công Uẩn issued the Edict on the Transfer of the Capital, moving the capital Đại Cồ Việt from Hoa Lư, a natural fortification surrounded by mountains and rivers, to the new capital, Đại La (Hanoi), which was later renamed Thăng Long (Ascending Dragon) by Lý Công Uẩn, after allegedly seeing a dragon flying upwards when he arrived at the capital. Moving the capital, Lý Công Uẩn thus departed from the militarily defensive mentality of his predecessors and envisioned a strong economy as the key to national survival. The third emperor of the dynasty, Lý Thánh Tông renamed the country &quot;Đại Việt&quot; (大越, Great Viet). Successive Lý emperors continued to accomplish far-reaching feats: building a dike system to protect rice farms; founding the Quốc Tử Giám the first noble university; and establishing court examination system to select capable commoners for government positions once every three years; organizing a new system of taxation; establishing humane treatment of prisoners. Women were holding important roles in Lý society as the court ladies were in charge of tax collection. Neighboring Dali kingdom&#x27;s Vajrayana Buddhism traditions also had influences on Vietnamese beliefs at the time. Lý kings adopted both Buddhism and Taoism as state religions.

The Vietnamese during Lý dynasty had one major war with Song China, and a few invasive campaigns against neighboring Champa in the south. The most notable conflict took place on Chinese territory Guangxi in late 1075. Upon learning that a Song invasion was imminent, the Vietnamese army under the command of Lý Thường Kiệt, and Tông Đản used amphibious operations to preemptively destroy three Song military installations at Yongzhou, Qinzhou, and Lianzhou in present-day Guangdong and Guangxi, and killed 100,000 Chinese. The Song dynasty took revenge and invaded Đại Việt in 1076, but the Song troops were held back at the Battle of Như Nguyệt River commonly known as the Cầu river, now in Bắc Ninh province about 40 km from the current capital, Hanoi. Neither side was able to force a victory, so the Vietnamese court proposed a truce, which the Song emperor accepted. Champa and the powerful Khmer Empire took advantage of Đại Việt&#x27;s distraction with the Song to pillage Đại Việt&#x27;s southern provinces. Together they invaded Đại Việt in 1128 and 1132. Further invasions followed in the subsequent decades.
Toward the declining Lý monarch&#x27;s power in the late 12th century, the Trần clan from Nam Định eventually rise to power. In 1224, powerful court minister Trần Thủ Độ forced the emperor Lý Huệ Tông to become a Buddhist monk and Lý Chiêu Hoàng, Huệ Tông&#x27;s 8-year-old young daughter, to become ruler of the country. Trần Thủ Độ then arranged the marriage of Chiêu Hoàng to his nephew Trần Cảnh and eventually had the throne transferred to Trần Cảnh, thus begun the Trần dynasty.

Trần Thủ Độ viciously purged members of the Lý nobility; some Lý princes escaped to Korea, including Lý Long Tường. After the purge, the Trần emperors ruled the country in similar manner to the Lý kings. Noted Trần monarch accomplishments include the creation of a system of population records based at the village level, the compilation of a formal 30-volume history of Đại Việt (Đại Việt Sử Ký) by Lê Văn Hưu, and the rising in status of the Nôm script, a system of writing for Vietnamese language. The Trần dynasty also adopted a unique way to train new emperors: when a crown prince reached the age of 18, his predecessor would abdicate and turn the throne over to him, yet holding the title of Retired Emperor (Thái Thượng Hoàng), acting as a mentor to the new Emperor.

During the Trần dynasty, the armies of the Mongol Empire and the Mongol Yuan dynasty of China under Möngke Khan and Kublai Khan invaded Đại Việt in 1258, 1285, and 1287–88. Đại Việt repelled all attacks of the Yuan Mongols during the reign of Kublai Khan. Three Mongol armies said to have numbered from 300,000 to 500,000 men were defeated. The key to Annam&#x27;s successes was to avoid the Mongols&#x27; strength in open field battles and city sieges—the Trần court abandoned the capital and the cities. The Mongols were then countered decisively at their weak points, which were battles in swampy areas such as Chương Dương, Hàm Tử, Vạn Kiếp and on rivers such as Vân Đồn and Bạch Đằng. The Mongols also suffered from tropical diseases and loss of supplies to Trần army&#x27;s raids. The Yuan-Trần war reached its climax when the retreating Yuan fleet was decimated at the Battle of Bạch Đằng (1288). The military architect behind Annam&#x27;s victories was Commander Trần Quốc Tuấn, more popularly known as Trần Hưng Đạo. In order to avoid further disastrous campaigns, the Tran and Champa acknowledged Mongol supremacy. 

In 1288, Venetian explorer Marco Polo visited Champa and Đại Việt.
It was also during this period that the Vietnamese waged war against the southern kingdom of Champa, continuing the Vietnamese long history of southern expansion (known as Nam tiến) that had begun shortly after gaining independence in the 10th century. Often, they encountered strong resistance from the Chams. After the successful alliance with Champa during the Mongol invasion, king Trần Nhân Tông of Đại Việt gained two Champa provinces, located around present-day Huế, through the peaceful means of the political marriage of Princess Huyền Trân to Cham king Jaya Simhavarman III. Not long after the nuptials, the king died, and the princess returned to her northern home in order to avoid a Cham custom that would have required her to join her husband in death. Champa was made a tributary state of Vietnam in 1312, but ten years later they regained independence and eventually waged a 30-years long war against the Vietnamese, in order to regain these lands and encouraged by the decline of Đại Việt in the course of the 14th century. Cham troops led by king Chế Bồng Nga (Cham: Po Binasuor or Che Bonguar, r. 1360–1390) killed king Trần Duệ Tông through a battle in Vijaya (1377). Multiple Cham northward invasions from 1371 to 1390 put Vietnamese capital Thăng Long and Vietnamese economy in destruction. However, in 1390 the Cham naval offensive against Hanoi was halted by the Vietnamese general Trần Khát Chân, whose soldiers made use of cannons.

The wars with Champa and the Mongols left Đại Việt exhausted and bankrupt. The Trần family was in turn overthrown by one of its own court officials, Hồ Quý Ly. Hồ Quý Ly forced the last Trần emperor to abdicate and assumed the throne in 1400. He changed the country name to Đại Ngu and moved the capital to Tây Đô, Western Capital (Thanh Hóa). Thăng Long was renamed Đông Đô, Eastern Capital. Although widely blamed for causing national disunity and losing the country later to the Ming Empire, Hồ Quý Ly&#x27;s reign actually introduced a lot of progressive, ambitious reforms, including the addition of mathematics to the national examinations, the open critique of Confucian philosophy, the use of paper currency in place of coins, investment in building large warships and cannons, and land reform. He ceded the throne to his son, Hồ Hán Thương, in 1401 and assumed the title Thái Thượng Hoàng, in similar manner to the Trần kings.

=== Champa from 1220 to 1471 ===

After having been restored from Khmer domination in 1220, Champa continued to face another counter-power from the north. After their invasion of 982, the Vietnamese had been pushing war against Champa in 1020, 1044, and 1069, plundered Cham capital. In 1252 king Tran Thai Tong of the new dynasty of Dai Viet led an incursion into Cham territories, captured many Cham concubines and women. This might be the reason for the death of Jaya Paramesvaravarman II as he died in the same year. His younger brother, Prince Harideva of Sakanvijaya, was crowned as Jaya Indravarman VI (r. 1252–1257). The new king was however assassinated by his nephew in 1257, who became Indravarman V (r. 1257–1288).

The new Mongol Yuan threat soon dragged two hostile kingdoms Champa and Dai Viet close together. The Yuan emperor Kublai demanded Cham submission in 1278 and 1280, both refused. In early 1283 Kublai sent a sea expedition led by Sogetu to invade Champa. The Cham retreated to the mountains, successfully waged a guerrilla resistance that bogged down the Mongols. Sogetu was driven to the north, and later killed by joint Cham–Vietnamese forces in June 1285. Although having repulsed the Mongol yokes, the Cham king sent an ambassador to the great Khan in October 1285. His successor, Jaya Simhavarman III (r. 1288–1307), married with a Vietnamese Queen (daughter of the ruling Vietnamese king) in 1306, and Dai Viet acquired two northern provinces.

In 1307 the new Cham king Simhavarman IV (r. 1307–1312), set out to retake the two provinces to protest against the Vietnamese agreement but was defeated and taken as a prisoner. Champa thus became a Vietnamese vassal state. The Cham revolted in 1318. In 1326 they managed to defeat the Vietnamese and reasserted independence. Royal upheaval within the Cham court resumed until 1360, when a strong Cham king was enthroned, known as Po Binasuor (r. 1360–90). During his thirty-year reign, Champa gained its momentum peak. Po Binasuor annihilated the Vietnamese invaders in 1377, ransacked Hanoi in 1371, 1378, 1379, and 1383, nearly had united all Vietnam for the first time by the 1380s. During a naval battle in early 1390, the Cham conqueror however was killed by Vietnamese firearm units, thus ending the short-lived rising period of the Cham kingdom. During the next decades, Champa returned to its status quo of peace. After much warfare and dismal conflicts, king Indravarman VI (r. 1400–41) reestablished relations with the second kingdom of Dai Viet&#x27;s ruler Le Loi in 1428.

The Islamization of Champa began in the 8th century to 11th century, being faster proselytized during the 14th and 15th centuries. Ibn Battuta during his visit to Champa in 1340, described a princess who met him, spoke in Turkish, was literate in Arabic, and wrote out the bismillah in the presence of the visitor. Islam further got more popular in Cham society after the fall of Champa in 1471. After the death of Indravarman VI, succession disputes escalated into civil war between Cham princes, weakening the kingdom. The Vietnamese took advantage, raided Vijaya in 1446. In 1471 Dai Viet king Le Thanh Tong conquered Champa, killed 60,000 people, and took away 30,000 prisoners included the Cham king and the royal family. Champa was reduced to the rump state of Panduranga, which persisted to exist until being fully absorbed in 1832 by the Vietnamese Empire.

=== Fourth Chinese domination (1407–1428) ===
In 1407, under the pretext of helping to restore the Trần monarchs, Chinese Ming troops invaded Đại Ngu and captured Hồ Quý Ly and Hồ Hán Thương. The Hồ family came to an end after only 7 years in power. The Ming occupying force annexed Đại Ngu into the Ming Empire after claiming that there was no heir to the Trần throne. Vietnam, weakened by dynastic feuds and the wars with Champa, quickly succumbed. The Ming conquest was harsh. Vietnam was annexed directly as a province of China, the old policy of cultural assimilation again imposed forcibly, and the country was ruthlessly exploited. However, by this time, Vietnamese nationalism had reached a point where attempts to sinicize them could only strengthen further resistance. Almost immediately, Trần loyalists started a resistance war. The resistance, under the leadership of Trần Quý Khoáng at first gained some advances, yet as Trần Quý Khoáng executed two top commanders out of suspicion, a rift widened within his ranks and resulted in his defeat in 1413.

=== Restored Dai Viet period (1428–1527) ===
==== Later Lê dynasty – primitive period (1428–1527) ====


In 1418, Lê Lợi was the son of a wealthy aristocrat in Thanh Hóa, led the Lam Sơn uprising against the Ming from his base of Lam Sơn (Thanh Hóa province). Overcoming many early setbacks and with strategic advice from Nguyễn Trãi, Lê Lợi&#x27;s movement finally gathered momentum. In September 1426, the Lam Sơn rebellion marched northward, ultimately defeated the Ming army in the Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động in south of Hanoi by using cannons. Then Lê Lợi&#x27;s forces launched a siege at Đông Quan (Hanoi), the capital of the Ming occupation. The Xuande Emperor of Ming China responded by sent two reinforcement forces of 122,000 men, but Lê Lợi staged an ambush and killed the Ming commander Liu Shan in Chi Lăng. Ming troops at Đông Quan surrendered. The Lam Sơn rebels defeated 200,000 Ming soldiers.

In April 1428, Lê Lợi reestablished the independent of Vietnam under his Lê dynasty. Lê Lợi renamed the country back to Đại Việt and moved the capital back to Thăng Long, renamed it Đông Kinh.
The Lê kings carried out land reforms to revitalize the economy after the war. Unlike the Lý and Trần kings, who were more influenced by Buddhism, the Lê kings leaned toward Confucianism. A comprehensive set of laws, the Hồng Đức code was introduced in 1483 with some strong Confucian elements, yet also included some progressive rules, such as the rights of women. Art and architecture during the Lê dynasty also became more influenced by Chinese styles than during previous Lý and Trần dynasties. The Lê dynasty commissioned the drawing of national maps and had Ngô Sĩ Liên continue the task of writing Đại Việt&#x27;s history up to the time of Lê Lợi.

Overpopulation and land shortages stimulated a Vietnamese expansion south. In 1471, Đại Việt troops led by king Lê Thánh Tông invaded Champa and captured its capital Vijaya. This event effectively ended Champa as a powerful kingdom, although some smaller surviving Cham states lasted for a few centuries more. It initiated the dispersal of the Cham people across Southeast Asia. With the kingdom of Champa mostly destroyed and the Cham people exiled or suppressed, Vietnamese colonization of what is now central Vietnam proceeded without substantial resistance. However, despite becoming greatly outnumbered by Vietnamese settlers and the integration of formerly Cham territory into the Vietnamese nation, the majority of Cham people nevertheless remained in Vietnam and they are now considered one of the key minorities in modern Vietnam. Vietnamese armies also raided the Mekong Delta, which the decaying Khmer Empire could no longer defend. The city of Huế, founded in 1600 lies close to where the Champa capital of Indrapura once stood. In 1479, Lê Thánh Tông also campaigned against Laos in the Vietnamese–Lao War and captured its capital Luang Prabang, in which later the city was totally ransacked and destroyed by the Vietnamese. He made further incursions westwards into the Irrawaddy River region in modern-day Burma before withdrawing. After the death of Lê Thánh Tông, Đại Việt fell into a swift decline (1497–1527), with 6 rulers in within 30 years of failing economy, natural disasters and rebellions raged through the country. European traders and missionaries, reaching Vietnam in the midst of the Age of Discovery, were at first Portuguese, and started spreading Christianity since 1533.

=== Decentralized period (1527–1802) ===
==== Mạc &amp; Later Lê dynasties – restored period (1527–1789) ====
The Lê dynasty was overthrown by its general named Mạc Đăng Dung in 1527. He killed the Lê emperor and proclaimed himself emperor, starting the Mạc dynasty. After defeating many revolutions for two years, Mạc Đăng Dung adopted the Trần dynasty&#x27;s practice and ceded the throne to his son, Mạc Đăng Doanh, and he became Thái Thượng Hoàng.

Meanwhile, Nguyễn Kim, a former official in the Lê court, revolted against the Mạc and helped king Lê Trang Tông restore the Lê court in the Thanh Hóa area. Thus a civil war began between the Northern Court (Mạc) and the Southern Court (Restored Lê). Nguyễn Kim&#x27;s side controlled the southern part of Annam (from Thanhhoa to the south), leaving the north (including Đông Kinh-Hanoi) under Mạc control. When Nguyễn Kim was assassinated in 1545, military power fell into the hands of his son-in-law, Trịnh Kiểm. In 1558, Nguyễn Kim&#x27;s son, Nguyễn Hoàng, suspecting that Trịnh Kiểm might kill him as he had done to his brother to secure power, asked to be governor of the far south provinces around present-day Quảng Bình to Bình Định. Hoàng pretended to be insane, so Kiểm was fooled into thinking that sending Hoàng south was a good move as Hoàng would be quickly killed in the lawless border regions. However, Hoàng governed the south effectively while Trịnh Kiểm, and then his son Trịnh Tùng, carried on the war against the Mạc. Nguyễn Hoàng sent money and soldiers north to help the war but gradually he became more and more independent, transforming their realm&#x27;s economic fortunes by turning it into an international trading post.

The civil war between the Lê-Trịnh and Mạc dynasties ended in 1592, when the army of Trịnh Tùng conquered Hanoi and executed king Mạc Mậu Hợp. Survivors of the Mạc royal family fled to the northern mountains in the province of Cao Bằng and continued to rule there until 1677 when Trịnh Tạc conquered this last Mạc territory. The Lê monarchs, ever since Nguyễn Kim&#x27;s restoration, only acted as figureheads. After the fall of the Mạc dynasty, all real power in the north belonged to the Trịnh lords. Meanwhile, the Ming court reluctantly decided on a military intervention into the Vietnamese civil war, but Mạc Đăng Dung offered ritual submission to the Ming Empire, which was accepted. Since the late 16th century, trades and contacts between Japan and Vietnam increased as they established relationship in 1591. The Tokugawa Shogunate of Japan and governor Nguyễn Hoàng of Quảng Nam exchanged total 34 letters from 1589 to 1612, and a Japanese town was established in the city of Hội An in 1604.
==== Trịnh &amp; Nguyễn lords (1627-1777) ====


In the year 1600, Nguyễn Hoàng also declared himself Lord (officially &quot;Vương&quot;, popularly &quot;Chúa&quot;) and refused to send more money or soldiers to help the Trịnh. He also moved his capital to Phú Xuân, modern-day Huế. Nguyễn Hoàng died in 1613 after having ruled the south for 55 years. He was succeeded by his 6th son, Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên, who likewise refused to acknowledge the power of the Trịnh, yet still pledged allegiance to the Lê monarch.

Trịnh Tráng succeeded Trịnh Tùng, his father, upon his death in 1623. Tráng ordered Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên to submit to his authority. The order was refused twice. In 1627, Trịnh Tráng sent 150,000 troops southward in an unsuccessful military campaign. The Trịnh were much stronger, with a larger population, economy and army, but they were unable to vanquish the Nguyễn, who had built two defensive stone walls and invested in Portuguese artillery.

The Trịnh–Nguyễn War lasted from 1627 until 1672. The Trịnh army staged at least seven offensives, all of which failed to capture Phú Xuân. For a time, starting in 1651, the Nguyễn themselves went on the offensive and attacked parts of Trịnh territory. However, the Trịnh, under a new leader, Trịnh Tạc, forced the Nguyễn back by 1655. After one last offensive in 1672, Trịnh Tạc agreed to a truce with the Nguyễn Lord Nguyễn Phúc Tần. The country was effectively divided in two.

==== Advent of Europeans &amp; southward expansion ====

The West&#x27;s exposure to Annam and Annamese exposure to Westerners dated back to 166 AD with the arrival of merchants from the Roman Empire, to 1292 with the visit of Marco Polo, and the early 16th century with the arrival of Portuguese in 1516 and other European traders and missionaries. Alexandre de Rhodes, a Jesuit priest from the Papal States, improved on earlier work by Portuguese missionaries and developed the Vietnamese romanized alphabet chữ Quốc ngữ in &quot;Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum&quot; in 1651. Jesuits in the 17th century established a firm foundation of Christianity in both domains of &quot;Đàng Ngoài&quot; (Tonkin) and &quot;Đàng Trong&quot; (Cochinchina). Various European efforts to establish trading posts in Vietnam failed, but missionaries were allowed to operate for some time until the mandarins began concluding that Christianity (which had succeeded in converting up to a tenth of the population by 1700) was a threat to the Confucian social order since it condemned ancestor worship as idolatry. Vietnamese authorities&#x27; attitudes to Europeans and Christianity hardened as they began to increasingly see it as a way of undermining society.

Between 1627 and 1775, two powerful families had partitioned the country: the Nguyễn lords ruled the South and the Trịnh lords ruled the North. The Trịnh–Nguyễn War gave European traders the opportunities to support each side with weapons and technology: the Portuguese assisted the Nguyễn in the South while the Dutch helped the Trịnh in the North. The Trịnh and the Nguyễn maintained a relative peace for the next hundred years, during which both sides made significant accomplishments. The Trịnh created centralized government offices in charge of state budget and producing currency, unified the weight units into a decimal system, established printing shops to reduce the need to import printed materials from China, opened a military academy, and compiled history books.

Meanwhile, the Nguyễn lords continued the southward expansion by the conquest of the remaining Cham land. Việt settlers also arrived in the sparsely populated area known as &quot;Water Chenla&quot;, which was the lower Mekong Delta portion of the former Khmer Empire. Between the mid-17th century to mid-18th century, as the former Khmer Empire was weakened by internal strife and Siamese invasions, the Nguyễn Lords used various means, political marriage, diplomatic pressure, political and military favors, to gain the area around present-day Saigon and the Mekong Delta. The Nguyễn army at times also clashed with the Siamese army to establish influence over the former Khmer Empire.

==== Tây Sơn dynasty (1778–1802) ====

In 1771, the Tây Sơn revolution broke out in Quy Nhon, which was under the control of the Nguyễn lord. The leaders of this revolution were three brothers named Nguyễn Nhạc, Nguyễn Lữ, and Nguyễn Huệ, not related to the Nguyễn lord&#x27;s family. In 1773, Tây Sơn rebels took Quy Nhon as the capital of the revolution. Tây Sơn brothers&#x27; forces attracted many poor peasants, workers, Christians, ethnic minorities in the Central Highlands and Cham people who had been oppressed by the Nguyễn Lord for a long time, and also attracted to ethnic Chinese merchant class, who hope the Tây Sơn revolt will spare down the heavy tax policy of the Nguyễn Lord, however their contributions later were limited due to Tây Sơn&#x27;s nationalist anti-Chinese sentiment. By 1776, the Tây Sơn had occupied all of the Nguyễn Lord&#x27;s land and killed almost the entire royal family. The surviving prince Nguyễn Phúc Ánh (often called Nguyễn Ánh) fled to Siam, and obtained military support from the Siamese king. Nguyễn Ánh came back with 50,000 Siamese troops to regain power, but was defeated at the Battle of Rạch Gầm–Xoài Mút and almost killed. Nguyễn Ánh fled Vietnam, but he did not give up.
The Tây Sơn army commanded by Nguyễn Huệ marched north in 1786 to fight the Trịnh Lord, Trịnh Khải. The Trịnh army failed and Trịnh Khải committed suicide. The Tây Sơn army captured the capital in less than two months. The last Lê emperor, Lê Chiêu Thống, fled to Qing China and petitioned the Qianlong Emperor in 1788 for help. The Qianlong Emperor supplied Lê Chiêu Thống with a massive army of around 200,000 troops to regain his throne from the usurper. In December 1788, Nguyễn Huệ–the third Tây Sơn brother–proclaimed himself Emperor Quang Trung and defeated the Qing troops with 100,000 men in a surprise 7 day campaign during the lunar new year (Tết). There was even a rumor saying that Quang Trung had also planned to conquer China, although it was unclear. During his reign, Quang Trung envisioned many reforms but died by unknown reason on the way march south in 1792, at the age of 40. During the reign of Emperor Quang Trung, Đại Việt was in fact divided into three political entities. The Tây Sơn leader, Nguyễn Nhạc, ruled the centre of the country from his capital Qui Nhơn. Emperor Quang Trung ruled the north from the capital Phú Xuân Huế. In the South, he officially funded and trained the Pirates of the South China Coast – one of the most strongest and feared pirate army in the world late 18th century – early 19th century. Nguyễn Ánh, assisted by many talented recruits from the South, captured Gia Định (Saigon) in 1788 and established a strong base for his force.
In 1784, during the conflict between Nguyễn Ánh, the surviving heir of the Nguyễn lords, and the Tây Sơn dynasty, a French Roman Catholic prelate, Pigneaux de Behaine, sailed to France to seek military backing for Nguyễn Ánh. At Louis XVI&#x27;s court, Pigneaux brokered the Little Treaty of Versailles which promised French military aid in exchange for Vietnamese concessions. However, because of the French Revolution, Pigneaux&#x27;s plan failed to materialize. He went to the French territory of Pondichéry (India), and secured two ships, a regiment of Indian troops, and a handful of volunteers and returned to Vietnam in 1788. One of Pigneaux&#x27;s volunteers, Jean-Marie Dayot, reorganized Nguyễn Ánh&#x27;s navy along European lines and defeated the Tây Sơn at Quy Nhon in 1792. A few years later, Nguyễn Ánh&#x27;s forces captured Saigon, where Pigneaux died in 1799. Another volunteer, Victor Olivier de Puymanel would later build the Gia Định fort in central Saigon. 

After Quang Trung&#x27;s death in September 1792, the Tây Sơn court became unstable as the remaining brothers fought against each other and against the people who were loyal to Nguyễn Huệ&#x27;s young son. Quang Trung&#x27;s 10-years-old son Nguyễn Quang Toản succeeded the throne, became Cảnh Thịnh Emperor, the third ruler of the Tây Sơn dynasty. In the South, lord Nguyễn Ánh and the Nguyễn royalists were assisted with French, Chinese, Siamese and Christian supports, sailed north in 1799, capturing Tây Sơn&#x27;s stronghold Quy Nhon. In 1801, his force took Phú Xuân, the Tây Sơn capital. Nguyễn Ánh finally won the war in 1802, when he sieged Thăng Long (Hanoi) and executed Nguyễn Quang Toản, along with many Tây Sơn royals, generals and officials. Nguyễn Ánh ascended the throne and called himself Emperor Gia Long. Gia is for Gia Định, the old name of Saigon; Long is for Thăng Long, the old name of Hanoi. Hence Gia Long implied the unification of the country. The Nguyễn dynasty lasted until Bảo Đại&#x27;s abdication in 1945. As China for centuries had referred to Đại Việt as Annam, Gia Long asked the Manchu Qing emperor to rename the country, from Annam to Nam Việt. To prevent any confusion of Gia Long&#x27;s kingdom with Triệu Đà&#x27;s ancient kingdom, the Manchu emperor reversed the order of the two words to Việt Nam. The name Vietnam is thus known to be used since Emperor Gia Long&#x27;s reign. Recently historians have found that this name had existed in older books in which Vietnamese referred to their country as Vietnam.

The Period of Division with its many tragedies and dramatic historical developments inspired many poets and gave rise to some Vietnamese masterpieces in verse, including the epic poem &quot;The Tale of Kiều&quot; (&quot;Truyện Kiều&quot;) by Nguyễn Du, &quot;Song of a Soldier&#x27;s Wife&quot; (&quot;Chinh Phụ Ngâm&quot;) by Đặng Trần Côn and Đoàn Thị Điểm, and a collection of satirical, erotically charged poems by a female poet, Hồ Xuân Hương.

=== Unified Vietnam period (1802–1862) ===
==== Nguyễn dynasty (1802–1945) ====

After Nguyễn Ánh, the last Nguyễn lord, established the unified Nguyễn dynasty in 1802, he tolerated Catholicism and employed some Europeans in his court as advisors. His successors were more conservative Confucians and resisted Westernization. The next Nguyễn emperors, Minh Mạng, Thiệu Trị, and Tự Đức brutally suppressed Catholicism and pursued a &#x27;closed door&#x27; policy, perceiving the Westerners as a threat, following events such as the Lê Văn Khôi revolt when a French missionary, Fr. Joseph Marchand, was accused of encouraging local Catholics to revolt in an attempt to install a Catholic emperor. Catholics, both Vietnamese and foreign-born, were persecuted in retaliation. Trade with the West slowed during this period. There were frequent uprisings against the Nguyễns, with hundreds of such events being recorded in the annals. These acts were soon being used as excuses for France to invade Vietnam. The early Nguyễn dynasty had engaged in many of the constructive activities of its predecessors, building roads, digging canals, issuing a legal code, holding examinations, sponsoring care facilities for the sick, compiling maps and history books, and exerting influence over Cambodia and Laos. 

==== Relations with China ====
According to a 2018 study in the &quot;Journal of Conflict Resolution&quot; covering Vietnam-China relations from 1365 to 1841, the relations could be characterized as a &quot;hierarchic tributary system&quot;. The study found that &quot;the Vietnamese court explicitly recognized its unequal status in its relations with China through a number of institutions and norms. Vietnamese rulers also displayed very little military attention to their relations with China. Rather, Vietnamese leaders were clearly more concerned with quelling chronic domestic instability and managing relations with kingdoms to their south and west.&quot;

=== French conquest ===

The French colonial empire was heavily involved in Vietnam in the 19th century; often French intervention was undertaken in order to protect the work of the Paris Foreign Missions Society in the country. In response to many incidents in which Catholic missionaries were persecuted, harassed and in some cases executed, and also to expand French influence in Asia, Napoleon III of France ordered Charles Rigault de Genouilly with 14 French gunships to attack the port of Đà Nẵng (Tourane) in 1858. The attack caused significant damage, yet failed to gain any foothold, in the process being afflicted by the humidity and tropical diseases. De Genouilly decided to sail south and captured the poorly defended city of Gia Định (Saigon). From 1859 during the Siege of Saigon to 1867, French colonial troops expanded their control over all six provinces on the Mekong delta and formed a colony known as Cochinchina.
A few years later, French troops landed in Northern Vietnam (which they called Tonkin) and captured Hà Nội twice in 1873 and 1882. The French managed to keep their grip on Tonkin although, twice, their top commanders Francis Garnier and Henri Rivière, were ambushed and killed fighting pirates of the Black Flag Army hired by the mandarins. The Nguyễn dynasty surrendered to France via the Treaty of Huế (1883), marking the colonial era (1883–1954) in the history of Vietnam. France assumed control over the whole of Vietnam after the Tonkin Campaign (1883–1886). French Indochina was formed in October 1887 from Annam (Trung Kỳ, central Vietnam), Tonkin (Bắc Kỳ, northern Vietnam) and Cochinchina (Nam Kỳ, southern Vietnam), with Cambodia and Laos added in 1893. Within French Indochina, Cochinchina had the status of a colony, Annam and Tonkin were nominally two French protectorates where the Nguyễn dynasty still &quot;de jure&quot; ruled.

== French colonial period (1862–1945) ==
=== French colonial conquest of Vietnam (1858–1896) ===

After the Vietnamese Nguyễn dynasty lost Gia Định, the island of Poulo Condor, and three southern provinces to France with the Treaty of Saigon signed between the Nguyễn dynasty, Spain, and France in 1862, many resistance movements in the south refused to recognize the treaty and continued to fight the French, some led by former court officers, such as Trương Định, some by farmers and other rural people, such as Nguyễn Trung Trực, who sank the French gunship L&#x27;Esperance using guerilla tactics. In the north, most movements were led by former court officers, and fighters were from the rural population. Sentiment against the invasion ran deep in the countryside—well over 90 percent of the population—because the French seized and exported most of the rice, creating widespread malnutrition from the 1880s onward. And, an ancient tradition existed of repelling all invaders. These were two reasons that the vast majority opposed the French invasion. However, Vietnam still became two protectorates ruled by France in 1883, confirmed by the Treaty of Huế (1884).
Some of the resistance movements lasted decades, with Phan Đình Phùng fighting in Central Vietnam until 1896, and in the northern mountains, former bandit leader Hoàng Hoa Thám fought until 1911. Even the teenage Nguyễn Emperor Hàm Nghi left the Imperial Palace of Huế in 1885 with regent Tôn Thất Thuyết and started the Cần Vương (&quot;Save the King&quot;) movement, trying to rally the people to resist the French. He was captured in November 1888 and exiled to French Algeria.

During this period, many Catholic converts collaborated with the French. This gave Catholics “an aura of subversion and treachery,” stated Neil Sheehan in &quot;A Bright Shining Lie&quot;, and people who sided with the French were called “country sellers.” By siding with the invaders, Catholics gained “the impression of being a foreign body,” said cultural expert Huu Ngoc. Catholics assisted, Jean Chesneaux wrote, in “breaking the isolation of the French troops.” Likewise, Paul Isoart reported: “The insurrection in Annam was liquidated thanks to the information the French received from the Vietnamese Catholics.” Some information was obtained in confessionals. Vicar Paul Francois Puginier of Ha Noi sent regular reports to secular authorities, including information about unrest and possible uprisings. In contrast, in Cambodia, which is also a part of French-Cochinchina, like Vietnam, the French restored the Kingdom of Cambodia as a Protectorate from its previous invader, Thailand, which occupied and destroyed Cambodia. Fulfilling a past promise by Spanish-Philippines to restore Cambodia, which the French-Vietnamese instead fulfilled, and both peoples being mostly Catholics. In 1887, Vietnamese protectorates and Cochinchina colony became parts of the French Indochinese Federation.

The invaders seized many farmlands and gave them to Frenchmen and collaborators, who were usually Catholics. By 1898, these seizures created a large class of poor people with little or no land, and a small class of wealthy landowners dependent on the French. In 1905, a Frenchman observed that “Traditional Annamite society, so well organized to satisfy the needs of the people has, in the final analysis, been destroyed by us.” This split in society lasted into the war in the 1960s.

Guerrillas of the Cần Vương movement killed around a third of Vietnam&#x27;s Christian population during the resistance war. Decades later, two more Nguyễn emperors, Thành Thái and Duy Tân were also exiled to Africa for having anti-French tendencies. The former was deposed on the pretext of insanity and Duy Tân was caught in a conspiracy with the mandarin Trần Cao Vân trying to start an uprising. However, lack of modern weapons and equipment prevented these resistance movements from being able to engage the French in open combat. The various anti-French started by mandarins were carried out with the primary goal of restoring the old feudal society. However, by 1900 a new generation of Vietnamese were coming of age who had never lived in precolonial Vietnam. These young activists were as eager as their grandparents to see independence restored, but they realized that returning to the feudal order was not feasible and that modern technology and governmental systems were needed. Having been exposed to Western philosophy, they aimed to establish a republic upon independence, departing from the royalist sentiments of the Cần Vương movements. Some of them set up Vietnamese independence societies in Japan, which many viewed as a model society (i.e. an Asian nation that had modernized, but retained its own culture and institutions).

===French Indochina and modern Vietnamese nationalism (1896–1945) ===

There emerged two parallel movements of modernization. The first was the &quot;Đông Du&quot; (&quot;Travel to the East&quot;) Movement started in 1905 by Phan Bội Châu. Châu&#x27;s plan was to send Vietnamese students to the Empire of Japan to learn modern skills, so that in the future they could lead a successful armed revolt against the French. With Prince Cường Để, he started two organizations in Japan: &quot;Duy Tân Hội&quot; and &quot;Việt Nam Công Hiến Hội&quot;. Due to French diplomatic pressure, Japan later deported Châu. Phan Châu Trinh, who favored a peaceful, non-violent struggle to gain independence, led a second movement, &quot;Duy Tân&quot; (&quot;Modernization&quot;), which stressed education for the masses, modernizing the country, developing economy, fostering understanding and tolerance between the French and the Vietnamese, and peaceful transitions of power. In 1907, he and associates Lương Văn Can, Nguyễn Quyền opened a patriotic modern school in Hanoi for young Vietnamese men and women. The school was called Tonkin Free School (Vietnamese: &quot;Đông Kinh Nghĩa Thục&quot;), used new translated books like Kang Youwei&#x27;s &quot;Datong Shu&quot; and Liang Qichao&#x27;s &quot;Ice-Drinker&#x27;s studio Collection&quot; (Vietnamese: &quot;Lương Khải Siêu – Đại đồng Thư, Khang Hữu Vi – Ẩm Băng thất Tùng thư&quot;) . He was a lecturer at the school, and Sào Nam&#x27;s writings were also used. Lương Văn Can was the headteacher, Nguyễn Quyền was the school supervisor. Nguyễn Văn Vĩnh, Phạm Duy Tốn were responsible for applying for the open license of school. The purpose of &quot;Đông Kinh Nghĩa Thục&quot; is &quot;broaden the people’s mind without taking money&quot;. Its ideas attacked the brutality of the French occupation of Vietnam, but also wanted to learn modernisation from the French. The school required scholars to renounce their elitist traditions and learn from the masses. It also offered the peasants a modern education. The early part of the 20th century saw the growing in status of the Romanized &quot;Quốc Ngữ&quot; alphabet for the Vietnamese language. Vietnamese patriots realized the potential of &quot;Quốc Ngữ&quot; as a useful tool to quickly reduce illiteracy and to educate the masses. The traditional Chinese scripts or the &quot;Nôm&quot; script were seen as too cumbersome and too difficult to learn. The use of prose in literature also became popular with the appearance of many novels; most famous were those from the &quot;Tự Lực Văn Đoàn&quot; literary circle. 
As the French suppressed both movements, and after witnessing revolutionaries in action in China and Russia, Vietnamese revolutionaries began to turn to more radical paths. Phan Bội Châu created the &quot;Việt Nam Quang Phục Hội&quot; in Guangzhou, planning armed resistance against the French. In 1925, French agents captured him in Shanghai and spirited him to Vietnam. Due to his popularity, Châu was spared from execution and placed under house arrest until his death in 1940. In 1927, the &quot;Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng&quot; (Vietnamese Nationalist Party or VNQDĐ), modeled after the Kuomintang in China, was founded, and the party launched the armed Yên Bái mutiny in 1930 in Tonkin which resulted in its chairman, Nguyễn Thái Học and many other leaders captured and executed by the guillotine. 

Marxism was also introduced into Vietnam with the emergence of three separate Communist parties; the Indochinese Communist Party, Annamese Communist Party and the Indochinese Communist Union, joined later by a Trotskyist movement led by Tạ Thu Thâu. In 1930, the Communist International (Comintern) sent Nguyễn Ái Quốc to Hong Kong to coordinate the unification of the parties into the Vietnamese Communist Party (CPV) with Trần Phú as the first Secretary General. Later the party changed its name to the Indochinese Communist Party as the Comintern, under Stalin, did not favor nationalistic sentiments. Being a leftist revolutionary living in France since 1911, Nguyễn Ái Quốc (Hồ Chí Minh) participated in founding the French Communist Party and in 1924 traveled to the Soviet Union to join the Comintern. Through the late 1920s, he acted as a Comintern agent to help build Communist movements in Southeast Asia. The communists rebelled with the 1930-31 Nghệ-Tĩnh Soviets and 1940 Cochinchina uprising against the French colonialists, but failed.

=== Second World War and Independence Declaration===
During World War II, Japanese army invaded Indochina in September 1940, keeping the Vichy French colonial administration in place as a puppet. In 1941 Hồ Chí Minh, arrived in northern Vietnam to form the Viet Minh Front. Although it was supposed to be an umbrella group for all elements fighting for Vietnam&#x27;s independence and democratic republic, it was &quot;de facto&quot; dominated by the Communist Party. The Viet Minh had a modest armed force and during the war worked with the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) to collect intelligence on the Japanese.

On March 9, 1945, the Japanese removed Vichy France&#x27;s control of Indochina. Under Japanese military occupation, emperor Bảo Đại declared the short-lived Empire of Vietnam with Trần Trọng Kim as the Prime Minister. A famine broke out in 1944–45, leaving from 600,000 to 2,000,000 dead.

Japan&#x27;s defeat by the World War II Allies created a power vacuum for Vietnamese nationalists of all parties to seize power in August 1945, forcing Emperor Bảo Đại to abdicate and ending the Nguyễn dynasty on August 25. On September 2, 1945, Hồ Chí Minh of the communist Viet Minh read the Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in Ba Đình flower garden, now known as Ba Đình square, officially creating the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. During and after the revolution, most of Vietnam was in communist hands, the rest was in non-communist hands. Their success in staging uprisings and in seizing control of most of the country by September 1945 was soon vandalized, however, by the return of the French. In addition, internal conflicts between communist and non-communist factions also occurred despite the new state not yet declaring itself communist in the early stages and a coalition government was &quot;de jure&quot; formed in March 1946. The conflict formed anti-communism of the non-communist faction, who opposed class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat of communism, leading to ideological wars between the Vietnamese in the future (1949-75).

== Modern period (1945–present) ==
=== First Indochina war (1946–1954) ===

On 2 September 1945, communist leader Hồ Chí Minh proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in Hanoi and held the position of Chairman (&quot;Chủ tịch&quot;). On the same day, Imperial Japan signed a treaty to officially surrender to the Allies, leading to the official end of World War II. The rule of communist Viet Minh led by Hồ over all of Vietnam was ended 21 days later, however, by Franco-British military forces attacking them south of the 16th parallel. In January 1946, Vietnam had its first National Assembly election, which drafted the first constitution. This is considered a fraudulent election. The situation was precarious: the French colonialists tried to regain power in Vietnam while the non-communist and communist forces of Vietnam were in internal conflicts. France had previously issued a declaration on 24 March 1945 promising to grant Indochina (including protectorates of Vietnam) a much greater democracy. The northern part of Vietnam was initially occupied by the army of the Republic of China led by General Lu Han, but later France received China&#x27;s consent to advance to the North, which pushed the Viet Minh&#x27;s DRV government to make peace with the French colonialists and legalize their return. In fact, the British and Chinese military occupations in Indochina (including Vietnam) to disarm the Japanese and the return of the French to Indochina were recognized by the Allies. At the initial stage, no country recognized the DRV government of the communist Viet Minh. On 6 March 1946, in a preliminary agreement, the Viet Minh accepted that their state became a free one within the French Union while Cochinchina remained under French rule. The preliminary agreement stipulated that French troops would only stay in Vietnam for five years. The Viet Minh then demanded complete independence and unification of Vietnam within the French Union, but de Gaulle&#x27;s French right-wing faction was rigid and only accepted Vietnam&#x27;s high autonomy while arguing that the future of Cochinchina would be decided through a referendum with an undetermined date and method. The Viet Minh condemned France&#x27;s establishment of an autonomous republic in Cochinchina even though this was a colony directly ruled by the French. The Viet Minh army also refused to come under French control as stipulated in the agreements, leading to clashes.

Hồ&#x27;s communist party and its national-front Viet Minh hunted down and executed left-opposition Trotskyists who had a significant presence in Saigon. In the interregnum between the surrender of the Japanese occupiers in August 1945 and the British-assisted French reconquest of the city in late September, the &quot;Fourth Internationalists&quot; and other popular groupings—the nationalist VNQDĐ and the syncretic Cao Dai and Hòa Hảo sects—had formed their own militias. A year later in Paris, asked by Daniel Guerin about the fate of Trotskyist leader Tạ Thu Thâu (executed in September), Hồ Chí Minh, while allowing that &quot;Thâu was a great patriot&quot;, replied: &quot;All those who do not follow the line which I have laid down will be broken.&quot; At his direction, the Viet Minh broke or substantially weakened all rival anti-colonial forces, but in the talks in France of 1946 Hồ failed to secure national unity and independence from the French.

Both the Viet Minh and right-wing government of France showed their toughness. At the peak: in late 1946, after Hồ&#x27;s return from France, France attacked with a naval bombardment of Haiphong that killed over 6000 people; communist government later attacked France in Hanoi capital despite the agreements signed, leading to the First Indochina war on 19 December 1946. The city was finally captured by the French army on 17 February the following year. In Operation Léa 1947, French army had a big victory against the communists, inflicting severe casualties on the Việt Minh. However it was strategically inconclusive because it failed to capture the Việt Minh leadership or seriously cripple its military forces. The leftist government of France of Paul Ramadier claimed to support Vietnamese independence and unity in 1947 but France still opposed communism. As a political alternative to Ho Chi Minh and his DRV, France decided, following his service to the Japanese, to bring back the former Vietnamese emperor Bảo Đại. The Vietnamese anti-communist faction formed a political alliance in February 1947, they supported cooperation with France and the Bảo Đại Solution to fight communism while gaining independence gradually and building a Western democracy for Vietnam within the French Union. As part of decolonization after WWII when both the U.S. and USSR opposed colonialism, after negotiations between French left-wing government and Vietnamese anti-communist politicians led by Bảo Đại, France recognized independence of Vietnam as a member state within the French Union with the Élysée Accords on 8 March 1949, leading the establishment of the State of Vietnam (predecessor of the Republic of Vietnam), its capital was located in Saigon, and the transfer of autonomous functions to the Vietnamese took place gradually based on the gradual maturation of the indigenous state apparatus. The Accords took effect on 14 June 1949. It received final ratification by the French National Assembly on 29 January 1950 and was signed by French President Vincent Auriol on 2 February, completely &quot;de jure&quot; abolishing the Treaty of Huế (1884) and French colonial rule in Vietnam (1883-1949). The establishment of pro-French Vietnamese state made this French colonial war in Indochina contain elements of Cold War ideological conflict; the French fought against the Viet Minh having Chinese help, they sought to retake their new-style colony (Indochina) in the name of anti-communism and helping native states with the support of the U.S., no longer in the name of colonialism like the Algerian War or before 1945. Both sides wanted the same thing: a unified Vietnam. But while the communist Viet Minh led by Hồ Chí Minh wanted a nation modeled after other communist countries, the State of Vietnam led by Bảo Đại wanted a Vietnam with close economic and cultural ties to the West. The United States recognized the new Vietnam on 3 February 1950. The two countries established diplomatic relations on February 17. After Vietnam gained independence, on September 7, 1951, the United States signed a treaty with Vietnam to provide direct economic aid to Vietnam, however military aid remained through France until February 1955. At the time France accepted Vietnam&#x27;s complete independence in the future as long as France&#x27;s economic and cultural interests were guaranteed through the French Union, the French Union was much different from the old French colonial empire and was much progressive, Vietnam was &quot;de facto&quot; still ruled by France but Vietnam&#x27;s autonomy was much more extensive compared to pre-1945 period. A Provisional Central Government was formed in May 1948 and later signed a preliminary treaty with France that recognized Vietnamese independence in Hạ Long Bay on June 5, partly reuniting the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin, but the Bảo Đại refused his assent insisting that on a complete reunification and strong independence of Vietnam. In Saigon, the French had designated the direct-rule colony of Cochinchina as a separate autonomous republic. With the Élysée Accords officially recognizing Vietnamese independence in March 1949, Vietnam regained Cochinchina after legal procedures in June and the State of Vietnam was proclaimed as an independent associated state within the French Union in July, and Bảo Đại became its Head of State (&quot;Quốc trưởng&quot;). The Vietnamese government was not satisfied with the level of independence they gained, so they continued negotiations to demand more autonomy for the country and achieved success in this. The country was still part of the French Indochinese Federation, but its autonomy became much greater and the new Vietnam gained power gradually. On December 8, 1950, the State of Vietnam was allowed to establish its own army (Vietnamese National Army, predecessor of the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces) and it fought side by side with the French army (French Union army) against communism. This army gradually matured under the support of France and the United States. The fact that France was at a disadvantage during the war forced the French to accelerate the transfer of power to Vietnam. On July 3, 1953, France announced that it would complete Vietnam&#x27;s independence and on April 28 of the following year, the two countries agreed that they would sign two treaties making Vietnam completely independent from France but still remain within the French Union. On 4 June 1954, French Prime Minister Joseph Laniel signed the Matignon Accords with Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam (future South Vietnam) Nguyễn Phúc Bửu Lộc to recognize the complete independence of Vietnam within the French Union. The Accords was never ratified by the heads of both countries but it still took effect at the day of signing. On 7 September 1954 the French handed the Norodom Palace over to the independent South Vietnamese government. On 30 December 1954, the Indochinese Federation was completely dissolved. In December 1955, South Vietnam withdrew from the French Union.

=== Partition and the Vietnam War (1954–1975) ===

During the period 1946–1950, France held the advantage on the battlefield in Indochina. However, in China, communists (CCP) of Mao established their own state in October 1949. After the Soviets recognized the Viet Minh government in early 1950, under Stalin&#x27;s pressure, the government of the Viet Minh publicly declared itself a communist organization even though it had not yet defeated France and began implementing land reform in 1953. Despite substantial U.S. assistance from 1950 and victories such as at Vĩnh Yên and Nà Sản, the French were persuaded to stop their war in Indochina after the Viet Minh with the help of communist China also from 1950 defeated them, specially a decisive defeat of their forces at Dien Bien Phu, causing them to get seriously bogged down. China&#x27;s help caused the communist Viet Minh (DRV) to reverse the situation in their favor when the Viet Minh&#x27;s immature government apparatus and army were much improved. The United States supported Bảo Đại&#x27;s capitalist and anti-communist Vietnam. Americans supported Vietnam&#x27;s independence but opposed communists using the guise of &quot;national liberation&quot;. On 21 July 1954, an agreement negotiated at Geneva, signed by the communist DRV and France, provisionally divided Vietnam along the 17th Parallel, with Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s communist DRV government ruling the North from Hanoi and Bảo Đại&#x27;s State of Vietnam, governing the South from Saigon. After the Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm overthrew Bảo Đại, the State of Vietnam became the Republic of Vietnam with Diệm being President (&quot;Tổng thống&quot;) in October 1955, still pursuing capitalism and anti-communism. With this 1954 Geneva agreement, the State of Vietnam lost the North to the communists. The armies of France and the State of Vietnam had to withdraw to the South, but the 1954 agreement did not require France to withdraw its troops from the South. In October 1956, a year after the Republic of Vietnam replaced the State of Vietnam, South Vietnam formed its own parliament and created its own constitution. On 20 May 1955, French Union forces (French forces) withdrew from Saigon to a coastal base and on 28 April 1956, the last French forces left South Vietnam. The French military withdrawal was due to pressure from the U.S. and Diệm. The last vestiges of French colonialism in Vietnam gradually disappeared based on full independence treaty on 4 June 1954 when France transferred the rest of its power to a sovereign South Vietnam. According to the 1954 Geneva agreement, a nation-wide election for a united administration was to be held in July 1956. The anti-communist State of Vietnam opposed the division of Vietnam, they condemned the French High Command&#x27;s arbitrarily handing over the North to the communists and setting a deadline for general elections, threatening to push all of Vietnam into communism. Diệm&#x27;s regime rejected the agreement and had the legal right to do so, while the United States merely &quot;took note&quot; of the ceasefire agreements and declared that it would &quot;refrain from the threat or use of force to disturb them. Fearing that young South Vietnam would fall to communism, which would create a big &quot;red&quot; wave, the United States immediately tried to protect the independence of South Vietnam to prevent the spread of communism from the North and restrain the influence of the Soviet Union. Partitition came into force, but the promised elections were never held. 

Between 1953 and 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms, including &quot;rent reduction&quot; and &quot;land reform&quot;, which resulted in significant political oppression. During the land reform, testimony from North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents, which extrapolated nationwide would indicate nearly 100,000 executions. Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the Red River Delta area, a lower estimate of 50,000 executions became widely accepted by scholars at the time. However, declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time, although likely greater than 13,500. In the South, Diem went about crushing political and religious opposition, imprisoning or killing of thousands.

Along with the split between northern and southern Vietnam in geographical territory came the divergence in their distinctive choices for institutional political structure. Northern Vietnam opted for a centralized bureaucratic regime while the south was based on a patron-client mechanism heavily relied on personalized rule. During this period, due to this structural difference, the north and south revealed different patterns in their economic activities, the long-term effects of which still persist today. Citizens that previously lived in the bureaucratic state are more likely to have higher household consumption and become more engaged in civic activities; the state itself tends to have the stronger fiscal capacity for taxation inherited from the previous institution. The Diệm&#x27;s regime in particular and anti-communist South Vietnam in general were dictatorial and pseudo-democratic, but not totalitarian and much more open than the communist North. The fall of Diệm&#x27;s effective regime in November 1963, although bringing about democratization, weakened anti-communist South Vietnam.

As a result of the Vietnam War (1955–75), a purely ideological conflict, the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) forces of the communist DRV unified the country under communist rule. In this Cold War conflict, a proxy and civil war, the North—with support from the Soviet Union and China—defeated the South that had the help from the U.S. Both North and South considered themselves the only legitimate representative of all of Vietnam. The war also spread to Laos and Cambodia. The communist side propagated that this war was to fight against the American &quot;imperialists&quot; who were &quot;invading&quot; South Vietnam and they equated the U.S. with France, but in fact the Americans completely only wanted to create a &quot;dyke&quot; to prevent communism by helping South Vietnam maintain independence. Communist army of the North defeated the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces of the South, which sought to maintain South Vietnamese independence from communism with the direct support of the foreign military (mainly the U.S.). The U.S. military presence in Vietnam peaked in April 1969, with 543,000 military personnel stationed in the country. The North also had direct help from foreign armies (mainly Chinese), although they did not join communist North Vietnam in invading the anti-communist South. The American goal in intervening in South Vietnam before and during the Vietnam War was not to make it a &quot;colony&quot; but completely to help the state here face the threat of the North and maintain an anti-communist capitalist outpost as part of a strategy to contain international communism; the United States did not invade Vietnam as communist propaganda claimed, but according to their domino theory, communism taking over the entire country would cause other countries in Southeast Asia to turn to communism and more, so they were determined not to let all of Vietnam fall under the influence of the Soviet Union. Anti-communist South Vietnam and its allies always had to deal with the invasion of communist forces from the North, although the U.S.-South Vietnamese coalition carried out air strikes on the North in retaliation. Despite the defeat of the communists against South Vietnamese army having U.S. help in their 1972 invasion campaign such as the Second Battle of Quảng Trị, an agreement unfavorable to the South was still signed. The North did not abide by the terms of the 1973 Paris Agreement, which officially settled the war by calling for free elections in the South and peaceful reunification. Two years after the withdrawal of the last U.S. forces in 1973, Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, fell to the communists, and the South Vietnamese army surrendered to the North on 30 April 1975. The defeat of South Vietnam marked that dissidents of the communist government no longer had any legal place of operation in Vietnam. After the fall of anti-communist and capitalist government in South Vietnam, for a year it had been administered by a transitional regime, a &quot;de facto&quot; communist government under the control of communist North Vietnam, before an official reunification under communism happened. In July 1976, the government of unified Vietnam renamed Saigon as Hồ Chí Minh City in honor of Hồ, who died in 1969. The war left Vietnam devastated, with the total death toll standing at between 966,000 and 3.8 million, with many thousands more crippled by weapons and substances such as napalm and Agent Orange. The government of Vietnam states that 4 million of its citizens were exposed to Agent Orange, and as many as 3 million have suffered illnesses because of it. These figures include the children of people who were exposed. The Red Cross of Vietnam estimates that up to 1 million people are disabled or have health problems due to contamination from Agent Orange. The United States government has challenged these figures as being unreliable.

=== Post-war and unified era (1975–1986) ===


On 2 July 1976, the communist states in North and South Vietnam were united into a single communist government in Hanoi, known as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Vietnam&#x27;s increasing closeness with the USSR in turn alarmed Chinese leadership, which feared encirclement by the USSR. The Socialist Republic of Vietnam joined the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon) on 28 June 1978. Soviet military aid to Vietnam increased from $75-$125 million in 1977 to $600-$800 million in 1978. On 3 November 1978, Vietnam and the Soviet Union signed a formal military alliance. In the post-1975 period, it was immediately apparent that the effectiveness of Communist Party (CPV) policies did not necessarily extend to the party&#x27;s peacetime nation-building plans. Having unified North and South politically, the CPV still had to integrate them socially and economically. In this task, CPV policy makers were confronted with the South&#x27;s resistance to communist transformation, as well as traditional animosities arising from cultural and historical differences between North and South. In the aftermath of the war, under Lê Duẩn&#x27;s administration, there were no mass executions of South Vietnamese who had collaborated with the U.S. or the Republic of Vietnam government, confounding Western fears. However, up to 300,000 South Vietnamese were sent to re-education camps, where many endured torture, starvation, and disease while being forced to perform hard labor. The New Economic Zones program was implemented by the Vietnamese communist government after the Fall of Saigon. Between 1975 and 1980, more than 1 million northerners migrated to the south and central regions formerly under the Republic of Vietnam. This program, in turn, displaced around 750,000 to over 1 million Southerners from their homes and forcibly relocated them to uninhabited mountainous forested areas. Many South Vietnamese left the country on their own by boats.

Compounding economic difficulties were new military challenges. In the late 1970s, Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge regime started harassing and raiding Vietnamese villages at the common border. To neutralize the threat, the PAVN invaded Cambodia in 1978 and overran its capital of Phnom Penh, driving out the incumbent Khmer Rouge regime. In response, as an action to support the pro-Beijing Khmer Rouge regime, China increased its pressure on Vietnam, and sent troops into Northern Vietnam in 1979 to &quot;punish&quot; Vietnam. Relations between the two countries had been deteriorating for some time. Territorial disagreements along the border and in the South China Sea that had remained dormant during the Vietnam War were revived at the war&#x27;s end, and a postwar campaign engineered by Hanoi against the ethnic Chinese Hoa community elicited a strong protest from Beijing. China was displeased with Vietnam&#x27;s alliance with the Soviet Union. During its prolonged military occupation of Cambodia in 1979–89, Vietnam&#x27;s international isolation extended to relations with the United States. The United States, in addition to citing Vietnam&#x27;s minimal cooperation in accounting for Americans who were missing in action (MIAs) as an obstacle to normal relations, barred normal ties as long as Vietnamese troops occupied Cambodia. Washington also continued to enforce the trade embargo imposed on Hanoi at the conclusion of the war in 1975.

The harsh postwar crackdown on remnants of capitalism in the South led to the collapse of the economy during the 1980s. With the economy in shambles, the communist government altered its course and adopted consensus policies that bridged the divergent views of pragmatists and communist traditionalists. Throughout the 1980s, Vietnam received nearly $3 billion a year in economic and military aid from the Soviet Union and conducted most of its trade with the USSR and other Comecon countries. In December 1986, Nguyễn Văn Linh, who was elevated to CPV general secretary the following year, launched a campaign for political and economic renewal (&quot;Đổi Mới&quot;). His policies were characterized by political and economic experimentation that was similar to simultaneous reform agenda undertaken in the Soviet Union. Reflecting the spirit of political compromise, Vietnam phased out its re-education effort. The communist government stopped promoting agricultural and industrial cooperatives. Farmers were permitted to till private plots alongside state-owned land, and in 1990 the communist government passed a law encouraging the establishment of private businesses.

=== Đổi Mới and contemporary era (1986–present) ===

Both Vietnam and China planned the normalization of their relations in a secret summit in Chengdu in September 1990, and officially normalized ties on 5 November 1991, right before the fall of the Soviet Union a month.
In February 1994, the United States lifted its economic embargo against Vietnam, and in June 1995, the United States and Vietnam normalized relations.
After American President Bill Clinton visited Vietnam in November 2000, a new era in relations between the two countries began. No other U.S. leader had ever officially visited Hanoi and Clinton was the first to visit Vietnam since the 1975 fall of Saigon. Vietnam has become an increasingly attractive destination for economic development. Over time, Vietnam has played an increasingly significant role on the world stage. Its economic reforms have significantly changed Vietnamese society and increased Vietnamese relevance in both Asian and broader international affairs. Also, due to Vietnam&#x27;s strategic geopolitical position near the intersection of the Pacific and Indian oceans, many world powers have begun to take on a much more favorable stance towards Vietnam.

On 11 January 2007, Vietnam became the 150th member of the WTO (World Trade Organization). According to the World Bank, Vietnam has been a development success story. Its economic reforms since the beginning of Đổi Mới in late 1986 have helped to change Vietnam from being one of the world’s poorest nations to a middle-income economy in one generation.

However, Vietnam also faces disputes, mostly with Cambodia over their shared border, and especially with China, over the South China Sea. In 2016, President Barack Obama became the 3rd U.S. Head of State to visit Vietnam. His historic visit helped to normalize relations with Vietnam. This improvement of U.S-Vietnam relations was further increased by the lifting of a lethal arms embargo, allowing the Vietnamese government to buy lethal weapons and modernize its military.

On 27–28 February 2019, the 2019 North Korea–United States Hanoi Summit was held between North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. president Donald Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam.

Vietnam is expected to be a newly industrialized country, and a regional power in the future. Vietnam has been named as one of the Next Eleven nations, a term describing eleven economies which could have BRIC-like potential to rival G7 nations.

In 2021, General Secretary of the Communist Party, Nguyen Phu Trong, was re-elected for his third term in office, meaning he is Vietnam&#x27;s most powerful leader in decades.

In 2023, a three-person collective leadership was responsible for governing Vietnam. President Vo Van Thuong (since 2023), Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh (since 2021) and the most powerful leader Nguyễn Phú Trọng (since 2011) as the Communist Party of Vietnam’s General Secretary.

During a visit to Vietnam on 10 September 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden visited with General Secretary Nguyễn Phú Trọng. Following this, the Vietnamese government recognized the relationship between the United States and Vietnam as a &quot;Comprehensive Strategic Partnership&quot;, emphasizing the increasing importance of bilateral links between the two countries.

<doc id="80362" wikidata="Q155596" url="?curid=80362" title="Philippe II, Duke of Orléans">
<text>Philippe II, Duke of Orléans (Philippe Charles; 2 August 1674 – 2 December 1723), was a French prince, soldier, and statesman who served as Regent of the Kingdom of France from 1715 to 1723. He is referred to in French as &quot;le Régent&quot;. He was the son of Philippe I, Duke of Orleans, and Elisabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orléans. Born at his father&#x27;s palace at Saint-Cloud, he was known from birth by the title of Duke of Chartres.

In 1692, Philippe married his first cousin Françoise Marie de Bourbon, the youngest legitimised daughter (&quot;légitimée de France&quot;) of King Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. Named regent of France during the minority of Louis XV, his great-nephew and first cousin twice removed, the period of his &quot;de facto&quot; rule was known as the Regency () (1715–1723). The Regency came to an end in February 1723, and the Duke of Orléans died at Versailles in December.

==Parents==
In March 1661, Monsieur Philippe I, Duke of Orleans, married his first cousin Princess Henrietta of England, known as &quot;Madame&quot; at court; she was the sister of King Charles II of England. The marriage was stormy; Henrietta was a famed beauty, sometimes depicted as flirtatious by those at the court of Versailles. Nonetheless, the marriage produced three children: Marie Louise, later Queen of Spain; Philippe Charles, Duke of Valois, who died in infancy; and Anne Marie, later Queen of Sardinia. Madame Henriette died at Saint-Cloud in 1670; rumors abounded that she had been poisoned by her husband or his long-term lover, the Chevalier de Lorraine; the two would remain together till the death of the Duke of Orléans in 1701.

In the following year, the Duke of Orléans married Princess Elisabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, only daughter of Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine, and Landgravine Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel. The new Duchess of Orléans, who had converted from Protestantism to Catholicism just before entering France, was popular at court upon her arrival in 1671. In 1673 the Duke and Duchess had a son named Alexandre Louis, another short-lived Duke of Valois. The next year, the Duchess gave birth to Philippe Charles, the future Regent. A daughter, Élisabeth Charlotte, later Duchess of Lorraine, was born in 1676.

==Youth==

Philippe Charles d&#x27;Orléans was born at the Château de Saint-Cloud, some ten kilometers west of Paris. As the grandson of King Louis XIII of France, Philippe was a &quot;petit-fils de France&quot;. This entitled him to the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; from birth, as well as the right to be seated in an armchair in the king&#x27;s presence.

At his birth, he was titled Duke of Chartres and was formally addressed as &quot;Monseigneur le Duc de Chartres&quot;. As the second living son of his parents, his birth was not greeted with the enthusiasm the Duke of Valois had received in 1673.

Philippe was born fourth in line to the throne, coming after Louis, Dauphin of France, his own father, and his older brother. When Philippe was born, his uncle Louis XIV was at the height of his power.

In 1676, his older brother the Duke of Valois died at the Palais-Royal in Paris, making Philippe the new heir to the House of Orléans; the future heirs of the family would be known as Duke of Chartres (&quot;Duc de Chartres&quot;) for the next century. The distraught mother of Philippe was pregnant at the time with Élisabeth Charlotte d&#x27;Orléans (1676–1744), future Duchess and regent of Lorraine. Élisabeth Charlotte and Philippe would always remain close.

The Duke of Chartres grew up at his father&#x27;s &quot;private&quot; court at Saint-Cloud and in Paris at the Palais-Royal, the Parisian residence of the Orléans family until the arrest of Philippe Égalité (his grandson) in April 1793, during the French Revolution. The Palais-Royal was frequented by, among others, Marie Anne Mancini, Duchess of Bouillon, part of Philippe&#x27;s father&#x27;s libertine circle.

==Education==

A program of how best to educate a prince was drawn up exclusively for him by Guillaume Dubois, his preceptor. Dubois had entered Philippe&#x27;s household in 1683 as his &quot;under-preceptor&quot;. Philippe&#x27;s education was carried out by the respected instructor Nicholas-François Parisot de Saint-Laurent until 1687.

Each course of study taught the &quot;Duc de Chartres&quot; the &quot;principles&quot; or &quot;elements&quot; of a subject. Some of the best historians, genealogists, scientists and artists in the kingdom participated in this educational experiment, which started around 1689. For example, Philippe learned physics and mathematics from Joseph Sauveur; and from Étienne Loulié he learned musical notation, elementary musical theory, plus the basics of playing the viol and the recorder.

Chartres was reared alongside Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon, later famous for his memoirs and defense of the rights of the peerage of France; Saint-Simon often accompanied the duke, and his wife was later a lady-in-waiting to Philippe&#x27;s daughter, Louise Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans, Duchesse de Berry.

Next, collaborating to link physics and music, Sauveur and Loulié demonstrated vibrating strings and the Galilean pendulum, and how the mathematical principles on which these devices depend are related to music. Finally, in 1693 the prince studied composition with Marc-Antoine Charpentier. With Charpentier&#x27;s help, he composed an opera, &quot;Philomèle&quot;, performed at his residence in 1694; and in 1705 the prince wrote a second opera, &quot;Penthée&quot;, to a libretto by the Marquis de La Fare. In the late 1690s Chartres studied the viol with Antoine Forqueray the elder. Meanwhile, he was studying diplomacy and riding, as preparations for a military career.

In May 1685 the &quot;Duc de Chartres&quot;, then just ten years old, made his first public appearance at Versailles; the occasion was the arrival of the Doge of Genoa, Francesco Maria Imperiale Lercari, at the French court. Chartres was put on a stage with his uncle, cousin and father. On 2 June 1686 Chartres was invested with the Order of the Holy Spirit at Versailles; on the same day his future brother-in-law, Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, Duc du Maine, also joined the order as did his cousins Louis III, prince de Condé and François Louis, Prince de Conti.

==Military career==
His father gained military distinction in the Battle of Cassel and during the decisive French victory against William of Orange, Chartres would similarly demonstrate military prowess. He had his first experience of battle at the siege of Mons in 1691, the year before his marriage. He fought with great distinction at the Battle of Steenkerque on 3 August 1692. In the same year he also served at the Siege of Namur. The following year he served at the Battle of Landen; he fought alongside the &quot;prince de Conti&quot;, who was wounded.

During a hiatus between military assignments, Chartres studied natural science.

In the next century, he would serve in the War of the Spanish Succession. He was next given a command in Italy (1706) and gained much credit for the Battle of Turin. Later he went to Spain and took part in the Battle of Almansa, a major step in the consolidation of Spain under the Bourbons (1707), where he achieved some important successes.

==Marriage==

Constant wars with many of the major powers in Europe rendered a significant marriage with a foreign princess unlikely, or so Louis XIV told his brother, &quot;Monsieur&quot;, when persuading him to accept the king&#x27;s legitimised daughter, Françoise Marie de Bourbon (known as &quot;Mademoiselle de Blois&quot;), as wife for Philippe. The king offered a dowry of two million &quot;livres&quot; with his daughter&#x27;s hand (not to be paid until the Nine Years&#x27; War was over), as well as the &quot;Palais-Royal&quot; for the bridegroom&#x27;s parents. Upon hearing that her son had agreed to the marriage, Philippe&#x27;s mother slapped his face in full view of the court and turned her back on the king as he bowed to her. Nonetheless, on 18 February 1692, the cousins were married.

The lavish ceremony took place in the chapel of the Palace of Versailles. The service was conducted by the Cardinal de Bouillon—a member of the House of La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne. In 1685, the Cardinal de Bouillon had refused to take part in the marriage of the Duke of Bourbon and Françoise Marie&#x27;s sister, &quot;Mademoiselle de Nantes&quot;, and, as a result, had been sent into exile, but he was recalled for the wedding of Françoise-Marie and the Duke of Chartres. After the ceremony, a banquet was given in the Hall of Mirrors with all the princes and princesses of the blood royal in attendance. Guests included the exiled James II of England and his consort, Mary of Modena. At the newlyweds&#x27; bedding ceremony later that evening, the exiled Queen of England had the honour of handing the new Duchess of Chartres her bed clothes. &quot;Madame de Montespan&quot; had not been invited to the wedding of her daughter.

The young couple, mismatched from the start, never grew to like each other, and soon the young Philippe gave his wife the nickname of &quot;Madame Lucifer&quot;. In spite of this, they had eight children (see below).

There were contemporary rumors of an incestuous relationship between the duke and his daughter, Marie Louise Elisabeth of Berry.
These rumors were never confirmed, although the duke reacted to them by demonstrating affectionate behavior towards her at court. The rumors were also used by the opposition during his period as regent, and were the inspiration of libelous songs and poems

==Court life==
On the death of his father in June 1701, Philippe inherited the Dukedoms of Orléans, Anjou, Montpensier and Nemours, as well as the princedom of Joinville. Philippe had died at Saint-Cloud after an argument with Louis XIV at Marly about Chartres&#x27; flaunting his pregnant mistress, Marie-Louise de Séry, before Françoise Marie. It has also been claimed that Philippe became so infuriated with Louis for not paying his daughter&#x27;s dowry that he suffered a stroke.

Throughout his life Philippe had many mistresses; his wife came to prefer living quietly at Saint-Cloud, the Palais-Royal, or her house at Bagnolet. His most famous mistress was arguably Marie-Thérèse de Parabère, who was his main mistress during almost the entire regency, with other high profile affairs being those with Madame de Sabran, Madame d&#x27;Averne and Marie-Thérèse Blonel de Phalaris. 

Upon the death of the &quot;prince de Condé&quot; in 1709, the rank of &quot;Premier Prince du Sang&quot; passed from the House of Condé to the House of Orléans. Philippe was thus entitled to the style of &quot;Monsieur le Prince&quot;. But the rank of &quot;petit-fils de France&quot; being higher than that of &quot;premier prince&quot;, Philippe did not change his style; nor did his son or other heirs make use of the &quot;Monsieur le Prince&quot; style, which had been so long associated with the cadet branch of the &quot;Princes de Condé&quot; that the heads of the House of Orléans preferred to be known at court by their ducal title.

In December 1697, the son of the Dauphin Louis de France married Princess Marie-Adélaïde of Savoy, eldest daughter of Philippe&#x27;s half sister Anne Marie. The match was negotiated as part of the Treaty of Turin, which ended Franco-Savoyard conflict during the Nine Years&#x27; War. The couple were the parents of two dauphins of France, Louis, Duke of Brittany, who died in 1712, and Louis, Duke of Anjou, the future Louis XV.

In 1705, he became Grandmaster of the Ordre du Temple, reforming the Statutes, and bring the Order into semi-public view.

In 1710, his eldest (and favourite) surviving daughter Louise Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans married her first cousin Charles, Duke of Berry; he was a son of the Dauphin and thus outranked Philippe and his wife; this meant that Louise Élisabeth took precedence over her parents. The Berry couple would have no children that lived more than a year.

In 1711, the Dauphin died at Meudon at the age of forty-nine and the title passed to his son, who died in 1712. Until his death in 1723, Orléans was generally considered to be first in line to the throne, although legitimists considered that Philip V of Spain, &quot;né&quot; Duke of Anjou and &quot;fils de France&quot;, held that place, on the contention that his renunciation in 1700 was constitutionally invalid. The deaths within three years of the Dauphin, two of his three sons, his daughter-in-law and the little Duke of Brittany led to widespread rumours that Orléans had poisoned them all to gain the throne. In fact, the Dauphin died of smallpox, the Duc de Berry in a riding accident and the others of measles, but they did great damage to Orléans&#x27; reputation, and even Louis XIV seems to have at least half-believed them. Only in Orléans&#x27; last years did the obvious affection between himself and Louis XV, and the young King&#x27;s robust health, cause the rumours to die away.

In his will, Louis XIV appointed Orléans president of the council of regency for the young king Louis XV.

==The Regency==

Months before the death of Louis XIV, Philippe was present at the Persian embassy to Louis XIV. Mohammad Reza Beg was a high-ranking official to the Persian governor of the Yerevan province (Armenia). He had been chosen by the Safavid Persian emperor Sultan Husayn for the mission and travelled with a grand entourage, as suitable to the diplomat of a mighty empire.

The scene of the Persian ambassador&#x27;s entry into Paris, 7 February 1715, was described by François Pidou de Saint-Olon (1646–1720), a nobleman who was delegated the diplomatic position of liaison officer to the Persian delegation.

===Louis XIV&#x27;s will===
On 29 July 1714, upon the insistence of his morganatic wife, the marquise de Maintenon, Louis XIV elevated his legitimised children to the rank of Princes of the Blood, which &quot;entitled them to inherit the crown if the legitimate lines became extinct&quot;. Thus, Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, &quot;Duke of Maine&quot; and Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, &quot;Count of Toulouse&quot; were officially inserted into the line of hereditary succession following all of the legitimate, acknowledged &quot;princes du sang&quot;.

Mme de Maintenon would have preferred Philip V [King of Spain] to be Regent and the duc du Maine to be Lieutenant Général and consequently in control. Fearing a revival of the war, Louis named the duc d&#x27;Orléans joint President of a Regency Council, but one that would be packed with his enemies, reaching its decisions by a majority vote that was bound to go against him. The real power would be in the hands of the duc du Maine, who was also appointed guardian of the young sovereign.

On 25 August 1715, a few days before his death, Louis XIV added a codicil to his will:

He sent for the Chancellor and wrote a last codicil to his will, in the presence of Mme de Maintenon. He was yielding, out of sheer fatigue, to his wife and confessor, probably with the reservation that his extraordinary action would be set aside after his death, like the will itself. Otherwise he would have been deliberately condemning his kingdom to perpetual strife, for the codicil appointed the duc du Maine commander of the civil and military Household, with Villeroy as his second-in-command. &quot;By this arrangement they became the sole masters of the person and residence of the King; of Paris ... and all the internal and external guard; of the entire service ... so much so that the Regent did not have even the shadow of the slightest authority and found himself at their mercy.&quot;
The evening of 25 August, Louis XIV had a private audience with the Duke of Orléans, his nephew and son-in-law, re-assuring him: 
&quot;You will find nothing in my will that should displease you. I commend the Dauphin to you, serve him as loyally as you have served me. Do your utmost to preserve his realm. If he were to die, you would be the master. [...] I have made what I believed to be the wisest and fairest arrangements for the well-being of the realm, but, since one cannot anticipate everything, if there is something to change or to reform, you will do whatever you see fit...&quot;

Louis XIV died at Versailles on 1 September 1715, and was succeeded by his five-year-old great-grandson, Louis XV. On 2 September, the Duke of Orléans went to meet the &quot;parlementaires&quot; in the &quot;Grand-Chambre du Parlement&quot; in Paris in order to have Louis XIV&#x27;s will annulled and his previous right to the regency restored. After a break that followed a much-heated session, the &quot;Parlement&quot; abrogated the recent codicil to Louis XIV&#x27;s will and confirmed the Duke of Orléans as regent of France.

On 30 December 1715, the regent decided to bring the young Louis XV from the Château de Vincennes to the Tuileries Palace in Paris where he lived until his return to Versailles in June 1722. The regent governed from his Parisian residence, the &quot;Palais-Royal&quot;.

Philippe disapproved of the hypocrisy of Louis XIV&#x27;s reign and opposed censorship, ordering the reprinting of books banned during the reign of his uncle. Reversing his uncle&#x27;s policies again, Philippe formed an alliance with Great Britain, Austria, and the Netherlands, and fought a successful war against Spain that established the conditions of a European peace. During this time he opened up diplomatic channels with Russia which resulted in a state visit by Tsar Peter the Great.

He acted in plays of Molière and Racine, composed an opera, and was a gifted painter and engraver. Philippe favoured Jansenism which, despite papal condemnation, was accepted by the French bishops, and he revoked Louis XIV&#x27;s compliance with the bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot;.

At first, he decreased taxation and dismissed 25,000 soldiers. But the inquisitorial measures which he had begun against the financiers led to disturbances, notably in the province of Brittany where a rebellion known as the Pontcallec conspiracy unfolded. He countenanced the risky operations of the banker John Law, whose bankruptcy led to the Mississippi bubble, a disastrous crisis for the public and private affairs of France. It was an early example of the bursting of an economic bubble.

On 6 June 1717, under the influence of Law and the duc de Saint-Simon, the Regent persuaded the Regency Council to purchase from Thomas Pitt for £135,000 the world&#x27;s largest known diamond, a 141 carat (28.2 g) cushion brilliant, for the crown jewels of France. The diamond was known from then on as &quot;Le Régent&quot;.

===Cellamare conspiracy===
There existed a party of malcontents who wished to transfer the regency from Orléans to his cousin, the young king&#x27;s uncle, King Philip V of Spain. A conspiracy was formed, under the inspiration of Cardinal Alberoni, the first minister of Spain. It was directed in France by the Prince of Cellamare, the Spanish ambassador, with the complicity of the Duchess of Orléans&#x27; older brother, the duc du Maine, and Anne Louise Bénédicte de Bourbon, the latter&#x27;s wife. In 1718, the Cellamare conspiracy was discovered and its participants exiled. Two years later its aims were revived in the Pontcallec conspiracy, four leaders of which were executed.

Guillaume Dubois, formerly tutor to the Duke of Orléans, and now his chief minister, caused war to be declared against Spain, with the support of Austria, England and the Netherlands (Quadruple Alliance). After some successes of the French marshal, the Duke of Berwick, in Spain, and of the imperial troops in Sicily, Philip V made peace with the regent (1720).

From the beginning of 1721, Philip V of Spain, and the Duke of Orléans had been negotiating the project of three Franco-Spanish marriages in order to cement tense relations between Spain and France. The young Louis XV of France would marry the three-year-old Infanta Mariana Victoria who would thus become Queen of France; the Infante Luis would marry the fourth surviving daughter of Philippe, Louise Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans; and the Infante Charles would be engaged to the pretty Philippine Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans who was the fifth surviving daughter of Philippe. Only one of these marriages actually ever occurred.

In March 1721, the Infanta Mariana Victoria arrived in Paris amid much joy. Known as &quot;l&#x27;infante Reine&quot; (Queen-Infanta) while in France, she was placed in the care of the old Dowager Princess of Conti, Philippe&#x27;s sister in law, and lived in the Tuileries Palace.

In November 1721, at the age of twelve, Louise Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans was married by proxy in Paris, Louise Élisabeth and her younger sister left for Madrid. Despite a cold reception from the Spanish royal family, especially by Elisabeth of Parma, the stepmother of her husband, she married Louis of Spain on 20 January 1722 at Lerma. Her dowry was of 4 million livres. The last of this triple alliance was Philippine Élisabeth who never married Charles; the marriage, though never officially carried out was annulled; the French sent back Mariana Victoria and in retaliation, Louise Élisabeth and Philippine Élisabeth were sent back to France. Franco-Spanish relations only recovered in 1743 when Louis XV&#x27;s son Louis de France married Mariana Victoria&#x27;s sister Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain.

On 15 June 1722, Louis XV and the court left the Tuileries Palace for the Palace of Versailles where the young king wanted to reside. The decision had been taken by the Duke of Orléans who, after the fall of Law&#x27;s System, was feeling the loss of his personal popularity in Paris. Philippe took the apartments of his cousin the late Dauphin on the first floor of the Palace; the King&#x27;s apartments were above his.

On 25 October of that year, the twelve-year-old Louis XV was anointed King of France in the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Reims. At the end of the ceremony, he threw himself in the arms of Orléans.

In December 1722, the Regent lost his mother to whom he had always been close; the Dowager Duchess of Orléans died at Saint-Cloud at the age of seventy, with her son at her side, but he did not attend her funeral service because he had been called away on official business. Philippe was greatly affected by his mother&#x27;s death.

On the majority of the king, which was declared on 15 February 1723, the Duke stepped down as regent. At the death of Cardinal Dubois on 10 August of that year, the young king offered the Duke the position of prime minister, and he remained in that office until his death a few months later.

The regent died in Versailles on 2 December 1723 in the arms of his mistress the duchesse de Falari. Louis XV mourned him greatly. The Duke of Bourbon took on the role of Prime Minister of France.

On 3 December, the Duke of Orléans&#x27; body was taken to Saint-Cloud where funeral ceremonies began the following day. His heart was taken to the &quot;Val de Grâce&quot; church in Paris and his body to the Basilica of Saint Denis, (about 10 km north of Paris), the necropolis of the French kings and their family.

The heart of the Duke of Orléans is now at the Chapelle Royale de Dreux, the necropolis of all the members of the Orléans family, built in 1816 by his descendant Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon, Duchess of Orléans, wife of Philippe Égalité. The chapel was completed as the Orléans family royal Chapel during the reign of his great-great-grandson Louis-Philippe I, King of the French.

The Cellamare conspiracy is the subject of one of Alexandre Dumas&#x27; novels, &quot;The Conspirators&quot; (&quot;Le Chevalier d&#x27;Harmental&quot;).

===Legacy===
*The duke assembled the Orléans Collection, one of the finest collections of paintings ever made by a non-monarch, which was mostly sold in London after the French Revolution.
*As Grandmaster and reformer of the Ordre du Temple, he left a legacy of Templarism that exists to this day as the Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem.
*He promoted education, making the Sorbonne tuition-free and opening the Royal Library to the public (1720).
*The city of New Orleans, in Louisiana, U.S., was named after him.

<text>The German diaspora (, ) consists of German people and their descendants who live outside of Germany. The term is used in particular to refer to the aspects of migration of German speakers from Central Europe to different countries around the world. This definition describes the &quot;German&quot; term as a sociolinguistic group as opposed to the national one since the emigrant groups came from different regions with diverse cultural practices and different varieties of German. For instance, the Alsatians and Hessians were often simply called &quot;Germans&quot; once they set foot in their new homelands.

==Terminology==

&quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; (&quot;ethnic Germans&quot;) is a historical term which arose in the early 20th century and was used by the Nazis to describe ethnic Germans, without German citizenship, living outside of Nazi Germany, although many had been in other areas for centuries. During World War II, Hitler forbade the use of the term because it was being used in a derogatory way against the many ethnic Germans in the SS. It is used by many historians who either deliberately or innocently are unaware of its Nazi history.

&quot;Auslandsdeutsche&quot; (adj. &quot;auslandsdeutsch&quot;) is a concept that connotes German citizens, regardless of which ethnicity, living abroad, or alternatively ethnic Germans entering Germany from abroad. Today, this means a citizen of Germany living more or less permanently in another country (including expatriates such as long-term academic exchange lecturers and the like), who are allowed to vote in the Republic&#x27;s elections, but who usually do not pay taxes to Germany but in their resident states. In a looser but still valid sense, and in general discourse, the word is frequently used in lieu of the ideologically tainted term &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;, denoting persons living abroad without German citizenship but defining themselves as Germans (culturally or ethnically speaking).

== Distribution ==
Ethnic Germans are a minority group in many countries. The following sections briefly detail the historical and present distribution of ethnic Germans by region, but generally exclude modern expatriates, who have a presence in the United States, Scandinavia and major urban areas worldwide.

In 1980, the first year of the US Census national origins questionnaire, Americans self-identifying as being of German ancestry formed the second-largest group. With the introduction of the &quot;American&quot; ethnic category between 1990-2010 (it was eliminated in the 2020 Census), millions of Americans ceased identifying as being of English ancestry, instead opting to identify only as &quot;American&quot; (or ignoring the ancestry question altogether). English is the most widespread ancestry in the United States, and still the largest white demographic in both &#x27;Alone&#x27;, and &#x27;Alone and In Combination&#x27; categories in the 2020 Census, though demographers still consider this an under-count due to previous national origin studies showing over 2x more English ancestry than German as recent as &#x27;Recent Social Trends in the United States: Report of the President&#x27;s Research Committee on Social Trends (1933).. People of partial German ancestry form an important minority group in several countries, including Canada (roughly 10% of the population), Argentina (roughly 8% of the population), Brazil (roughly 3% of the population), Australia (roughly 4.5% of the population), Chile (roughly 3% of the population), 
Namibia and in central and eastern Europe—(Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Russia).

Distribution of German citizens and people claiming German ancestry (figures are only estimates and actual population could be higher, because of misleadingly formulated questions in censuses in various countries (for example in Poland) and other different factors, f.e. related to participant in a census):

===Europe===
====Alpine nations====

Austria, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein each have a German-speaking majority, though the vast majority of the population do not identify themselves as German anymore. Austrians historically were identified as and considered themselves Germans until after the defeat of Nazi Germany and the end of World War II. Post-1945 a broader Austrian national identity began to emerge, and over 90% of the Austrians now see themselves as an independent nation.

==== East-Central Europe ====
Aside from the Germans who migrated to other parts of Europe, the German diaspora also covered the Eastern and Central European states such as Croatia, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, along with several post-Soviet states. There has been a continued historical presence of Germans in these regions due to the interrelated processes of conquest and colonization as well as migration and border changes. During the periods of colonization, for instance, there was an influx of Germans who came to Bohemia and parts of Romania as colonizers. Settlements due to border changes were largely 20th century developments caused by the new political order after the two world wars.

====Baltic states====

====Belgium====
In Belgium, there is an ethnic German minority. It is the majority in its region of 71,000 inhabitants. Ethnologue puts the national total of German speakers at 150,000, not including Limburgish and Luxembourgish.

====Bulgaria====
====Czech Republic and Slovakia====

Before World War II, some 30% of the population in Czechia were ethnic Germans, and in the border regions and certain other areas they were in the majority. There are about 21,000 Germans in the Czech Republic (number of Czechs who have at least partly German ancestry probably runs into the hundreds of thousands). Their number has been consistently decreasing since World War II. According to the 2011 census, there remain 11 municipalities and settlements in Czech Republic with more than 6% Germans.

The situation in Slovakia was different from that in Czech Republic, in that the number of Germans was considerably lower and that the Germans from Slovakia were almost completely evacuated to German states as the Soviet army was moving west through Slovakia, and only a fraction of those who returned to Slovakia after the end of the war were deported with the Germans from the Czech lands.

Many representatives of expellee organizations support the erection of bilingual signs in all formerly German-speaking territory as a visible sign of the bilingual linguistic and cultural heritage of the region. The erection of bilingual signs is permitted if a minority constitutes 10% of the population.

====Denmark====
In Denmark, the part of Schleswig that is now South Jutland County (or Northern Schleswig) is inhabited by about 12,000–20,000 ethnic Germans They speak mainly Standard German and South Jutlandic. A few speak Schleswigsch, a Northern Low Saxon dialect.

====France====
In France, over 100,000 German nationals residing in the French country. The exact number is not known; some statistics indicate more than 300,000 Germans in France, but they are not officially sanctioned. There, the Germans live mainly in the northeastern area of France, i.e., in regions close to the Franco-German border (i.e. Alsace), and the island of Corsica.

==== Hungary ====

Prior to World War II, approximately 1.5 million Danube Swabians lived in Hungary, Romania, and Yugoslavia. Today the German minority in Hungary have minority rights, organisations, schools and local councils, but spontaneous assimilation is well under way. Many of the deportees visited their old homes after the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1990. Around 178,000 Germans live in Hungary.

====Italy====
There are smaller, unique populations of Germans who arrived so long ago that their dialect retains many archaic features heard nowhere else: the Cimbrians are concentrated in various communities in the Carnic Alps, north of Verona, and especially in the Sugana Valley on the high plateau northwest of Vicenza in the Veneto region; the Walsers, who originated in the Swiss Wallis, live in the provinces of Aostatal, Vercelli, and Verbano-Cusio-Ossola; the Mòchenos live in the Fersina Valley. Smaller German-speaking communities also exist in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region: the Carinthians in the Canale Valley (municipalities of Tarvisio, Malborghetto Valbruna and Pontebba) and the Zahren and Timau Germans in Carnia.

Contrarily to the before-mentioned minorities, the German-speaking population of the province of South Tyrol cannot be categorized as &quot;ethnic German&quot; according to the definition of this article, but as Austrian minority. However, as Austrians saw themselves as ethnic Germans until the end of World War II they can technically also be called Germans. The province was part of the Austrian County of Tyrol before the 1919 dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. South Tyroleans were part of the over 3 million German speaking Austrians who in 1918 found themselves living outside of the newborn Austrian Republic as minorities in the newly formed or enlarged respective states of Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary and Italy. Their dialect is Austro-Bavarian German. Both standard German and dialect are used in schooling and media. German enjoys co-official status with the national language of Italian throughout this region.

Germans have been present in the Iglesiente mining region in the south west of Sardinia since the 13th century. Successively since 1850 groups of specialised workers from Styria, Austria, followed by German miners from Freiburg settled in the same area. Some Germans influenced building and toponym is still visible in this area.

==== Norway ====

In Norway, there are 27,770 Germans making them the ninth largest ethnic minority in the country, thus constituting 0.52% of Norway&#x27;s total population, and 2.94% of all foreign residents in Norway. Immigration from Germany to Norway has occurred since the Middle Ages. There have been many Germans who migrated to Bergen during the Middle Ages and also during Norway&#x27;s union with Denmark. During the Union with Denmark, a lot of German miners migrated to the town of Kongsberg. As of 2020, there are 1,446 Germans in the city of Bergen, making up 0.51% of the total population, and in the town of Kongsberg there are 114 Germans, making up 0.41% of the total population respectively. The city with the biggest population of Germans is Oslo. 3,743 Germans live in the city, thereby making up 0.55% of the total population. Germany is also the country that sends the most foreign exchange students to Norway, in 2016, 1,570 exchange students came to Norway from Germany.

==== Poland ====

The remaining German minority in Poland (109,000 people were registered in the 2011 census) enjoys minority rights according to Polish minority law. There are German speakers throughout Poland, and most of the Germans live in the Opole Voivodeship in Silesia. Bilingual signs are posted in some towns of the region. In addition, there are bilingual schools and German can be used instead of Polish in dealings with officials in several towns.

====Portugal====
As of December 2022, there are 20,500 German nationals residing in Portugal. This number only include foreign nationals and thus excludes German citizens who have acquired Portuguese citizenship (around 400 people since 2008), as well as Portuguese people of German descent. 

Around 6,000 Germans live in the municipalities of Lisbon, Oeiras, Sintra or Cascais, in the Portuguese Riviera. On the other hand, around 5,000 Germans live in the southern region of Algarve. The German community is especially noticeable in Lisbon and Porto. Each city hosts a German Evangelical Church, a German school and offers German libraries. There is also a German church as well as a German school in Algarve while Madeira hosts a German Evangelical Church. Lisbon also hosts a Catholic German Church and a German cemetery since 1821. Many Luso-Germans have acquired fame throughout the years. Individuals of the community include Alfredo Keil (1850–1907), composer of &quot;A Portuguesa&quot;, the Portuguese national anthem, archaeologist Virgínia Rau (1907–1973), banker and industrialist António Champalimaud (1918–2004), architect Francisco Keil do Amaral (1910–1975) and former prime minister Ernesto Hintze Ribeiro (1849–1907). Contemporary figures of German descent include football player Diego Moreira, Eurovision song contest winner Salvador Sobral, surfer Nic von Rupp, actresses Catarina Wallenstein and Vera Kolodzig, and tennis player Maria João Koehler. Amongst the most notable Luso-Germans there is undoubtedly João Frederico Ludovice, who was commissioned the project for the Mafra National Palace in 1711.

==== Romania ====

As of 2022, according to the Romanian Census, there were circa 22,900 ethnic Germans recorded in Romania.

Since the High Middle Ages, the territory of present-day Romania has been continuously inhabited by German-speaking groups, firstly by Transylvanian Saxons then, gradually, by other immigrant groups of ethnic German origin. They are all politically represented by the Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania (FDGR/DFDR).

====Sweden====

During the 11th century, Sweden was visited by missionaries from Germany. During the Middle Ages, Hanseatic merchants had a great influence on Swedish trade and also the Swedish language. According to a survey, the proportion of German loanwords in Swedish is 24–30 percent (slightly depending on how you calculate). During the period of great power, a number of German congregations were formed in Sweden. Including Karlskrona German parish, which then became part of Karlskrona Admiralty parish. Today, there are two more active German congregations in Sweden. They are part of the parishes of the Church of Sweden, the German Christinae parish and the German St. Gertrude&#x27;s parish consists of German citizens or Swedes of German origin. In connection with the two world wars, several German children of war came to Sweden. Between the late 1940s and early 1990s, many East German refugees also came to Sweden. On 31 December 2014, there were 49,359 people in Sweden who were born in Germany, of whom 23,195 were men (47.0%) and 26,164 women (53.0%). The corresponding figure for 31 December 2000 was 38,155, of which 16,965 men (44.5%) and 21,190 women (55.5%).There were 28,172 people in Sweden with German citizenship. In 2019, according to Statistics Sweden, German immigrants together with the Chinese were the most highly educated who migrate to Sweden, with a proportion of 70 per cent who are highly educated, which is well above the average for Sweden&#x27;s population which is 30 per cent. Around 29,505 German Citizens living in Sweden in 2020.

====United Kingdom====

In the United Kingdom, a German-Briton ethnic group of around 300,000 exists. Some are descended from 19th-century immigrants. Others are 20th-century immigrants and their descendants, and others are World War II prisoners of war held in Great Britain who decided to stay there. Others arrived as spouses of English soldiers from post-war marriages in Germany, when the British were occupying forces. Many of the more recent immigrants have settled in the London and southeast part of England, in particular, Richmond (South West London).

The British royal family are partially descended from German monarchs.

Due to Brexit, the number of Germans in the UK has declined significantly. In 2021, there were only 135,000 Germans in the UK.

===Africa===

During the long decline of the Roman Empire and the ensuing great migrations Germanic tribes such as the Vandals (who sacked Rome) migrated into North Africa and settled mainly in the lands corresponding to modern Tunisia and northeastern Algeria. While it is likely that some of the people living there at present are descended from these Germanic peoples, they did not leave visible cultural traces.

====Cameroon====
The first German trading post in the Duala area on the Kamerun River delta was established in 1868 by the Hamburg trading company C. Woermann. The firm&#x27;s agent in Gabon, Johannes Thormählen, expanded activities to the Kamerun River delta. In 1874, together with the Woermann agent in Liberia, Wilhelm Jantzen, the two merchants founded their own company, Jantzen &amp; Thormählen there. At the outbreak of World War I, French, Belgian and British troops invaded the German colony in 1914 and fully occupied it during the Kamerun campaign. The last German fort to surrender was the one at Mora in the north of the colony in 1916. Following Germany&#x27;s defeat, the Treaty of Versailles divided the territory into two League of Nations mandates (Class B) under the administration of Great Britain and France. French Cameroun and part of British Cameroons reunified in 1961 as Cameroon, though some Germans still remain in Cameroon.

====Namibia====

Germany was not as involved in colonizing Africa as other major European powers of the 20th century, and lost its overseas colonies, including German East Africa and German South West Africa, after World War I. Similarly to those in Latin America, the Germans in Africa tended to isolate themselves and were more self-sufficient than other Europeans. In Namibia there are 30,000 ethnic Germans, though it is estimated that only a third of those retain the language. Most German-speakers live in the capital, Windhoek, and in smaller towns such as Swakopmund and Lüderitz, where German architecture is highly visible.

====South Africa====

In South Africa, a number of Afrikaners and Boers are of partial German ancestry, being the descendants of German immigrants who intermarried with Dutch settlers and adopted Afrikaans as their mother tongue. Professor JA Heese in his book &quot;Die Herkoms van die Afrikaner&quot; (&quot;The Origins of Afrikaners&quot;) claims the modern Afrikaners (who total around 3.5 million) have 34.4% German ancestry.

Germans also emigrated to South Africa during the 1850s and 1860s, and settled in the Eastern Cape area around Stutterheim, and in Kwazulu-Natal in the Wartburg area, where there is still a large German-speaking community. Mostly originating from different waves of immigration during the 19th and 20th centuries, an estimated 12,000 people speak German or a German variety as a first language in South Africa. Germans settled quite extensively in South Africa, with many Calvinists immigrating from Northern Europe. Later on, more Germans settled in the KwaZulu-Natal and elsewhere. Here, one of the largest communities are the speakers of &quot;Nataler Deutsch&quot;, a variety of Low German, who are concentrated in and around Wartburg. German is slowly disappearing elsewhere, but a number of communities still have a large number of speakers and some even have German language schools. Around 17,000 German Nationals lived in South Africa in 2020.

====Tanzania====
When mainland Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi were under German control, they were named German East Africa; they received some migration from German communities. After Tanganyika and Ruanda-Urundi became British and Belgian mandates following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I, some of these communities remained. 

=== North America ===

In the United States are ca. 160,000 German Citizens Registered.
* Belize: 5,763 Mennonite Low-German speakers.
* Canada (3.3 million, 9,6% of the population), see also German Canadians.
* Mexico: See German immigration to Mexico, 22% of Mennonites also speak Low German which is not Standard German but derived from Old Saxon, 30% speak Spanish, 5% speak English and 5% speak Russian as a second language. Sources estimate that there are around 15,000 German citizens and Mexicans of German-citizen origin account for about 75,000 today. Also of note, the &#x27;Colegio Alemán Alexander von Humboldt&#x27;, or Alexander von Humboldt school in Mexico City is the largest German school outside Germany.
* In the United States, &quot;German&quot; has been the largest self-identified ancestry group since 1990. There are around 50 million Americans of at least partial German ancestry in the United States, or 17% of the U.S. population, the country&#x27;s largest self-reported ancestral group. including various groups such as the Pennsylvania Dutch. Of these, 23 million are of German ancestry alone (&quot;single ancestry&quot;), and another 27 million are of partial German ancestry, making them the largest group in the United States, followed by the Irish. Of those who claim partial ancestry, 22 million identify their primary ancestry (&quot;first ancestry&quot;) as German. The 22 million Americans of primarily German ancestry are by far the largest part of the German diaspora, a figure equal to over a quarter of the population of Germany itself. Germans form just under half the population in the Upper Midwest.
* Central America: In 1940, there were 16,000 Germans living in Central America; half of them in Guatemala, and most of the remainder were established in Costa Rica.

===South America===


* Argentina: Those of German ancestry constitute about 8% of the Argentine population — over 3 million — most of them Volga Germans alone — about 2 million. There are more than 400,000 of other German ancestries including Mennonites and German Swiss. These two groups are more common in Southern Argentina, and also in Santa Fe, Entre Rios and Cordoba provinces. A notable example is the town of Villa General Belgrano, founded by Germans in the 1930s. In the 1960s it became the site of the Fiesta Nacional de la Cerveza, or Oktoberfest, which has become a major attraction in Argentina. By 1940, there were 250,000 people of German descent living in the country. The German embassy in Argentina estimates that 660,000 Argentines, or 1.5% of the total population, are descendants of Germans who emigrated directly from Germany (It means that it doesn&#x27;t includes other ethnic Germans who emigrated from Austria, Switzerland, Russia/USSR, etc.). 50,000 German citizens live in Argentina.

:Nazi Minister Walther Darré was born in Argentina. After the Second World War, almost a thousand prominent Nazi leaders and politicians fled to Argentina. Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele were among them. Kurt Tank, who developed some of the greatest World War II aircraft fighters, also entered Argentina in the late 1940s.

:There are about 500,000 German-speakers in Argentina, slightly over 1% of population.

:Furthermore, a wave of Ashkenazi immigrants came after the rise of Nazism in 1933, followed by as many as 19,000 German Jews. From 1939 until the end of World War II, immigration was put to a halt by anti-immigrant feelings in the country and restrictions on immigration from Germany.

* Bolivia: There are two different German groups: the descendants of those who emigrated from Germany and Brazil (estimated in about 160,000, 2% of Bolivian population) and the descendants of Mennonites that emigrated from Canada and Mexico (at least 85,000 of them live in agrarian communities). Germans are 237,000 or 2,5% of Bolivian population.

:There are over 20,000 Standard German-speakers, plus 85,000 Mennonite Low German-speakers.

* Brazil: Mostly living in Southern Brazil. Brazil received 250,000 Germans between the 19th and 20th centuries. According to Born and Dickgiesser (1989, p. 55) the number of Brazilians of German descent in 1986 was 3.6 million. According to a 1999 survey by IBGE researcher Simon Schwartzman, in a representative sample of the Brazilian population 3,6% said they had German ancestry, a percentage that in a population of about 200 million amount to 7.2 million descendants. In 2004, Deutsche Welle cited the number of 5 million Brazilians of German descent. Hunsrückisch and East Pomeranian are some of the most prominent groups.
:By 1940, the German diaspora in Brazil amounted about a million.
:Around 14,000 German Citizens Registered in Brazil.
:There are 3 million German-speakers in Brazil, slightly over 1.5% of population.

* Chile: The German-Chilean Chamber of Commerce estimated at 500,000 the descendants of Germans, about 3% of the total population of Chile estimated at 16 million (in the same source). There are 40,000 Standard German-speakers.
* Ecuador: Ecuador has only few people of German descent. Notable is a small German population on the Island of Floreana (Galapagos): Between 1929 and circa 1950, roughly half a dozen &quot;Aussteiger&quot;s were living on the Island. In 1934 three of them died under unclear circumstances, these events caused international media attention called &quot;Galapagos-affair&quot;. Today, the descendants of the Floreana-Germans have been assimilated into the local Ecuadorian population or re-immigrated to Germany.
* Paraguay : 166,000 Standard German-speakers (including 18,000 Mennonites, who don&#x27;t speak &quot;Plattdeutsch&quot; or &quot;Mennonite Low German&quot;), most Germans in Paraguay are of Brazilian descent and Portuguese speakers; plus 20,000 Mennonite Low German, spoken by Mennonites who live in Chaco and Eastern Paraguay The Mennonites emigrated to Paraguay from Chihuahua State (in Mexico), the Soviet Union, Canada, and Bolivia. Non-Mennonites German emigrated to Paraguay mainly from Brazil, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the German Empire.

:Those of German ancestry are 290,000, or 4.4% of Paraguayan population.

* Peru: The communities of Oxapampa, Pozuzo, and Villa Rica in the high jungles of the Peruvian Amazon basin were settled in the middle of the 19th century by Austrian and Prussian immigrants. Many of its present-day inhabitants speak German In the 18th century, German immigrants settled the areas of Tingo Maria, Tarapoto, Moyobamba, and the Amazonas Department. German immigrants largely settled in Lima, and to a lesser extent Arequipa.
* Uruguay: By 1940, there were 50,000 Germans living in the country.
* Venezuela:

===Asia===
In Japan, during the Meiji period (1868–1912), many Germans came to work in Japan as advisors to the new government. Despite Japan&#x27;s isolationism and geographic distance, there have been a few Germans in Japan, since Germany&#x27;s and Japan&#x27;s fairly parallel modernization made Germans ideal &quot;O-yatoi gaikokujin&quot;. (See also Germany–Japan relations)

In China, the German trading colony of Jiaozhou Bay in what is now Qingdao existed until 1914, and did not leave much more than breweries, including Tsingtao Brewery

In South Korea, there are Germans in Korea.
In Indonesia, some of them became well-known figures in history, such as C.G.C. Reinwardt (founder and first director of Bogor Botanical Garden), Walter Spies (German of Russian origin, who became the artist that made Bali known to the world), and Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn (owner of a big plantation in the south of Bandung and dubbed &quot;the Humboldt of the East&quot; because of his ethno-geographical notes).

Members of the German religious group known as Templers settled in Palestine in the late 19th century and lived there for several generations, but were expelled by the British from Mandatory Palestine during World War II, due to pro-Nazi sympathies expressed by many of them.

Communist East Germany had relations with Vietnam and Uganda in Africa, but in these cases population movement went mostly to, not from, Germany. After the German reunification, a large percentage of &quot;guest workers&quot; from Communist nations sent to East Germany returned to their home countries.

===Oceania===
* Australia has received a significant number of ethnic-German immigrants from Germany and elsewhere. Numbers vary depending on who is counted, but moderate criteria give an estimate of 750,000 (4% of the population). The first wave of German immigration to Australia began in 1838, with the arrival of Prussian Lutheran settlers in South Australia (see &quot;German settlement in Australia&quot;). After the Second World War, Australia received a large influx of displaced ethnic Germans. In the 1950s and 1960s, German immigration continued as part of a large post-war wave of European immigration to Australia.

There have been ethnic Germans in Australia since the founding of the New South Wales colony in 1788, Governor Arthur Phillip (the first Governor of New South Wales) had a German father. But, the first significant wave of German immigration was in 1838. These Germans, mostly Prussian immigrants (but also winegrowers from the Hesse-Nassau state and the Rheingau). From there after, thousands of Germans emigrated to Australia until World War I. Also, German Australian was the most identified ethnicity behind English and Irish in Australia until World War I.

After World War II, large numbers of Germans emigrated to Australia to escape war-torn Europe.

* New Zealand has received modest, but steady, ethnic German immigration from the mid-19th century. Today the number of New Zealanders with German ancestry is estimated to be approximately 200,000 (5% of the population). Many German New Zealanders anglicized their names during the 20th century due to the negative perception of Germans fostered by World War I and World War II. New Zealanders of German descent include the late former Prime Minister David Lange. The vast majority of Germans in New Zealand settled in the North Island, with a couple settling in the Christchurch area. Cities such as Tauranga, Nelson and, to a lesser extent, Auckland have been somewhat influenced by German culture and values.

== History ==


From Celtic times, the early Germanic tribes settled from the Baltic all the way to the Black Sea until the great migrations of the 4-6th century AD.

Medieval Germans migrated eastwards during the medieval period Ostsiedlung until the flight, evacuation and expulsion of Germans after World War II; many areas in Central and Eastern Europe had an ethnic German population. In the Middle Ages, Germans were invited to migrate to Poland and the central and eastern regions of the German Holy Roman Empire and also the Kingdom of Hungary following the Mongol invasions of the 12th century, and then once again during the late 17th century after the Austrian-Ottoman wars to set up farms and repopulate the eastern regions of the Austrian Empire and Balkans.

The Nazi government termed such ethnic Germans &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;, regardless of how long they had been residents of other countries. (Now they would be considered &quot;Auslandsdeutsche&quot;). During World War II, Nazi Germany classified ethnic Germans as Übermenschen, while Jews, Gypsies, Slavic peoples, mainly ethnic Poles and Serbs, along with Black and mixed-race people were called Untermenschen. After the war, Central European nations such as Poland, the Czechoslovakia, Hungary, as well as the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, and Yugoslavia in the Balkan region of Southern Europe, expelled most of the ethnic Germans living in their territories.

There were significant ethnic German populations in such areas as Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine at one time. As recently as 1990, there were one million standard German speakers and 100,000 Plautdietsch speakers in Kazakhstan alone, and 38,000, 40,000 and 101,057 standard German speakers in Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan, respectively.

There were reportedly 500,000 ethnic Germans in Poland in 1998. Recent official figures show 147,000 (as of 2002). Of the 745,421 Germans in Romania in 1930, only about 60,000 remain. In Hungary the situation is quite similar, with only about 220,000. There are up to one million Germans in the former Soviet Union, mostly in a band from southwestern Russia and the Volga valley, through Omsk and Altai Krai (597,212 Germans in Russia, 2002 Russian census) to Kazakhstan (353,441 Germans in Kazakhstan, 1999 Kazakhstan census). Germany admitted approximately 1.63 million ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union between 1990 and 1999.

These &quot;Auslandsdeutsche&quot;, as they are now generally known, have been streaming out of the former Eastern Bloc since the early 1990s. For example, many ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union have taken advantage of the German &quot;Law of Return&quot;, a policy which grants citizenship to all those who can prove to be a refugee or expellee of German ethnic origin or the spouse or descendant of such a person. This exodus has occurred despite the fact that many of the ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union were highly assimilated and spoke little or no German.

===Historical countries===

====Former Soviet Union====

====Former Yugoslavia====
According to the 1921 census, the German community was the largest minority group in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (505,790 inhabitants or 4.22%).

==Groupings==

Note that many of these groups have since migrated elsewhere. This list simply gives the region with which they are associated, and does not include people from countries with German as an official national language. In general, it also omits some collective terms in common use defined by political border changes where this is antithetical to the current structure. Such terms include:

==German-language media worldwide==

A visible sign of the geographical extension of the German language is the German-language media outside the German-speaking countries.
German is the second most commonly used scientific language as well as the third most widely used language on websites after English and Russian.

Deutsche Welle (German pronunciation: [ˈdɔʏtʃə ˈvɛlə]; &quot;&quot;German Wave&quot; in German), or DW, is Germany&#x27;s public international broadcaster. The service is available in 30 languages. DW&#x27;s satellite television service consists of channels in German, English, Spanish, and Arabic.

German-speaking people living abroad (and people wanting to learn German) can visit the websites of German-language newspapers and TV- and radio stations. The free software MediathekView allows the downloading of videos from the websites of some public German, Austrian, and Swiss TV stations and of the public Franco-German TV network ARTE. With the webpage &quot;onlinetvrecorder.com,&quot; it is possible to record programs of many German and some international TV stations.

Note that some material is region-restricted for legal reasons and cannot be accessed from everywhere in the world. Some websites have a paywall or limit the access for free/unregistered users.

==Germany&#x27;s policy on dual citizenship==

Since June 27, 2024, unrestricted dual citizenship has been possible.

Prior to that date, German nationality law allowed dual citizenship only with other EU countries and Switzerland; with other countries, in some cases:

# With special permission (&quot;Beibehaltungsgenehmigung&quot;&quot;), for which German citizens must apply &quot;before&quot; taking the other citizenship (otherwise, German citizenship is &quot;automatically lost&quot;). Non-EU and non-Swiss citizens wanting to be naturalized in Germany must usually renounce their old citizenship, but may keep it if their country does not allow the renunciation of citizenship, or if the renunciation process is too difficult/humiliating/expensive, or, rarely, in individual cases if the renunciation of the old citizenship means enormous disadvantages for the concerned person.
# If dual citizenship was obtained at birth. Some countries do not accept the &quot;dual-citizenship-by-birth principle,&quot; so the concerned person must later choose one citizenship and renounce the other.
# Under Article 116 par. 2 of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz), former German citizens who between 30 January 1933, and 8 May 1945, were deprived of their German citizenship on political, racial, or religious grounds may re-invoke their citizenship and the same applies to their descendants, and are permitted to hold dual (or multiple) citizenship.

A law adopted in June 2019 allows the revocation of the German citizenship of dual citizens who have joined or supported a terror militia such as the Islamic State and are at least 18 years old.

Naturalized Germans can lose their German citizenship if it is found out that they got it by willful deceit / bribery / menacing / giving intentionally false or incomplete information that had been important for the naturalization process. In June 2019, it was decided to prolong the deadline from 5 to 10 years after naturalization.

==Visa requirements==


As of July 2024, German citizens can visit 194 countries without a visa or with visa on arrival. The Henley Passport Index ranks the German passport second in the world in terms of travel freedom.

===Freedom of movement within other EU countries and the EFTA countries===

As EU citizens, Germans can live and work indefinitely in other EU countries and the EFTA countries; however, the right to vote and work in certain sensitive fields (such as government, police, military) might in some cases be restricted to the local citizens only. The EU/EFTA countries can exclude immigrants from getting welfare for a certain time period to avoid &quot;welfare tourism,&quot; and they can refuse welfare completely if the immigrants do not have a job after a certain period of time and do not try to get one. Immigrants convicted of welfare fraud can be deported and be refused the re-entry of the country.

===Right to consular protection in non-EU countries===
When in a non-EU country where there is no German embassy, Germans as EU citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country. See List of diplomatic missions of Germany and List of diplomatic missions in Germany.

German citizens can be extradited only to other EU countries or to international courts of justice, and only if a law allows this (German Basic Law, Art. 16). Before the introduction of the European Arrest Warrant, the extradition of German citizens was generally prohibited by the German Basic Law.

Germany regularly publishes travel warnings on the website of the Auswärtiges Amt (Federal Foreign Office) to its citizens. The Office allows German citizens to register online in a special list, the Krisenvorsorgeliste (&quot;Crisis-Prevention List&quot;) before they travel abroad (&quot;Elektronische Erfassung von Deutschen im Ausland [ELEFAND]&quot; Electronic Registration of Germans Being Abroad). With a password, the registered persons can change or update their data. The registration is voluntary and free of charge. It can be used for longer stays (longer than 6 months), but also for a vacation of only two weeks. The earliest date of registration is 10 days before the planned trip.

<text>In music theory, a tetrachord (; ) is a series of four notes separated by three intervals. In traditional music theory, a tetrachord always spanned the interval of a perfect fourth, a 4:3 frequency proportion (approx. 498 cents)—but in modern use it means any four-note segment of a scale or tone row, not necessarily related to a particular tuning system.

==History==
The name comes from &quot;tetra&quot; (from Greek—&quot;four of something&quot;) and &quot;chord&quot; (from Greek &quot;chordon&quot;—&quot;string&quot; or &quot;note&quot;). In ancient Greek music theory, &quot;tetrachord&quot; signified a segment of the greater and lesser perfect systems bounded by &quot;immovable&quot; notes (); the notes between these were &quot;movable&quot; (). It literally means &quot;four strings&quot;, originally in reference to harp-like instruments such as the lyre or the kithara, with the implicit understanding that the four strings produced adjacent (i.e., conjunct) notes.

Modern music theory uses the octave as the basic unit for determining tuning, where ancient Greeks used the tetrachord. Ancient Greek theorists recognized that the octave is a fundamental interval but saw it as built from two tetrachords and a whole tone.

===Ancient Greek music theory===

Ancient Greek music theory distinguishes three &quot;genera&quot; (singular: &quot;genus&quot;) of tetrachords. These genera are characterized by the largest of the three intervals of the tetrachord:

;Diatonic
: A diatonic tetrachord has a characteristic interval that is less than or equal to half the total interval of the tetrachord (or approximately 249 cents). This characteristic interval is usually slightly smaller (approximately 200 cents), becoming a whole tone. Classically, the diatonic tetrachord consists of two intervals of a tone and one of a semitone, e.g. A–G–F–E.
;Chromatic
: A chromatic tetrachord has a characteristic interval that is greater than about half the total interval of the tetrachord, yet not as great as four-fifths of the interval (between about 249 and 398 cents). Classically, the characteristic interval is a minor third (approximately 300 cents), and the two smaller intervals are equal semitones, e.g. A–G–F–E.
;Enharmonic

: An enharmonic tetrachord has a characteristic interval that is greater than about four-fifths the total tetrachord interval. Classically, the characteristic interval is a ditone or a major third, and the two smaller intervals are variable, but &quot;approximately&quot; quarter tones, e.g. 

When the composite of the two smaller intervals is less than the remaining (incomposite) interval, the three-note group is called the &quot;pyknón&quot; (from &quot;pyknós&quot;, meaning &quot;compressed&quot;). This is the case for the chromatic and enharmonic tetrachords, but not the diatonic (meaning &quot;stretched out&quot;) tetrachord.

Whatever the tuning of the tetrachord, its four degrees are named, in ascending order, &quot;hypate&quot;, &quot;parhypate&quot;, &quot;lichanos&quot; (or &quot;hypermese&quot;), and &quot;mese&quot; and, for the second tetrachord in the construction of the system, &quot;paramese&quot;, &quot;trite&quot;, &quot;paranete&quot;, and &quot;nete&quot;. The &quot;hypate&quot; and &quot;mese&quot;, and the &quot;paramese&quot; and &quot;nete&quot; are fixed, and a perfect fourth apart, while the position of the &quot;parhypate&quot; and &quot;lichanos&quot;, or &quot;trite&quot; and &quot;paranete&quot;, are movable.

As the three genera simply represent ranges of possible intervals within the tetrachord, various &quot;shades&quot; (&quot;chroai&quot;) with specific tunings were specified. Once the genus and shade of tetrachord are specified, their arrangement can produce three main types of scales, depending on which note of the tetrachord is taken as the first note of the scale. The tetrachords themselves remain independent of the scales that they produce, and were never named after these scales by Greek theorists.

;Dorian scale : The first note of the tetrachord is also the first note of the scale.
:Diatonic: E–D–C–B | A–G–F–E
:Chromatic: E–D–C–B | A–G–F–E
:Enharmonic: E–D–C–B │ A–G–F–E

;Phrygian scale: The second note of the tetrachord (in descending order) is the first of the scale.

:Diatonic: D–C–B | A–G–F–E | D
:Chromatic: D–C–B | A–G–F–E | D
:Enharmonic: D–C–B | A–G–F–E | D

; Lydian scale: The third note of the tetrachord (in descending order) is the first of the scale.
:Diatonic: C–B | A–G–F–E | D–C
:Chromatic: C–B | A–G–F–E | D–C
:Enharmonic: C–B | A–G–F–E | D–C

In all cases, the extreme notes of the tetrachords, E – B, and A – E, remain fixed, while the notes in between are different depending on the genus.

===Pythagorean tunings===
Here are the traditional Pythagorean tunings of the diatonic and chromatic tetrachords:


Here is a representative Pythagorean tuning of the enharmonic genus attributed to Archytas:

The number of strings on the classical lyre varied at different epochs, and possibly in different localities – four, seven and ten having been favorite numbers. Larger scales are constructed from conjunct or disjunct tetrachords. Conjunct tetrachords share a note, while disjunct tetrachords are separated by a &quot;disjunctive tone&quot; of 9/8 (a Pythagorean major second). Alternating conjunct and disjunct tetrachords form a scale that repeats in octaves (as in the familiar diatonic scale, created in such a manner from the diatonic genus), but this was not the only arrangement.

The Greeks analyzed genera using various terms, including diatonic, enharmonic, and chromatic. Scales are constructed from conjunct or disjunct tetrachords.

This is a partial table of the superparticular divisions by Chalmers after Hofmann.

==Variations==

===Romantic era===


Tetrachords based upon equal temperament tuning were used to explain common heptatonic scales. Given the following vocabulary of tetrachords (the digits give the number of semitones in consecutive intervals of the tetrachord, adding to five):

the following scales could be derived by joining two tetrachords with a whole step (2) between:

All these scales are formed by two complete disjunct tetrachords: contrarily to Greek and Medieval theory, the tetrachords change here from scale to scale (i.e., the C major tetrachord would be C–D–E–F, the D major one D–E–F–G, the C minor one C–D–E–F, etc.). The 19th-century theorists of ancient Greek music believed that this had also been the case in Antiquity, and imagined that there had existed Dorian, Phrygian or Lydian tetrachords. This misconception was denounced in Otto Gombosi&#x27;s thesis (1939).

===20th-century analysis===
Theorists of the later 20th century often use the term &quot;tetrachord&quot; to describe any four-note set when analysing music of a variety of styles and historical periods. 
The expression &quot;chromatic tetrachord&quot; may be used in two different senses: to describe the special case consisting of a four-note segment of the chromatic scale,
or, in a more historically oriented context, to refer to the six chromatic notes used to fill the interval of a perfect fourth, usually found in descending bass lines.
It may also be used to describes sets of fewer than four notes, when used in scale-like fashion to span the interval of a perfect fourth.

===Atonal usage===
Allen Forte occasionally uses the term &quot;tetrachord&quot; to mean what he elsewhere calls a &quot;tetrad&quot; or simply a &quot;4-element set&quot; – a set of any four pitches or &quot;pitch classes&quot;. In twelve-tone theory, the term may have the special sense of any consecutive four notes of a twelve-tone row.

==Non-Western scales==

Tetrachords based upon equal-tempered tuning were also used to approximate common heptatonic scales in use in Indian, Hungarian, Arabian and Greek musics. Western theorists of the 19th and 20th centuries, convinced that any scale should consist of two tetrachords and a tone, described various combinations supposed to correspond to a variety of exotic scales. For instance, the following diatonic intervals of one, two or three semitones, always totaling five semitones, produce 36 combinations when joined by whole step:

===India-specific tetrachord system===
Tetrachords separated by a halfstep are said to also appear particularly in Indian music. In this case, the lower &quot;tetrachord&quot; totals six semitones (a tritone). The following elements produce 36 combinations when joined by halfstep. These 36 combinations together with the 36 combinations described above produce the so-called &quot;72 karnatic modes&quot;.

===Persian===
Persian music divides the interval of a fourth differently than the Greek. For example, Al-Farabi describes four genres of the division of the fourth:
* The first genre, corresponding to the Greek diatonic, is composed of a tone, a tone, and a semitone, as G–A–B–C.
* The second genre is composed of a tone, a three-quarter tone, and a three-quarter tone, as G–A–B–C.
* The third genre has a tone and a quarter, a three-quarter tone, and a semitone, as G–A–B–C.
* The fourth genre, corresponding to the Greek chromatic, has a tone and a half, a semitone, and a semitone, as G–A–B–C.
He continues with four other possible genres &quot;dividing the tone in quarters, eighths, thirds, half thirds, quarter thirds, and combining them in diverse manners&quot;. Later, he presents possible positions of the frets on the lute, producing ten intervals dividing the interval of a fourth between the strings:
If one considers that the interval of a fourth between the strings of the lute (Oud) corresponds to a tetrachord, and that there are two tetrachords and a major tone in an octave, this would create a 25 tone scale. A more inclusive description (where Ottoman, Persian, and Arabic overlap), of the scale divisions is that of 24 quarter tones (see also Arabian maqam). It should be mentioned that Al-Farabi&#x27;s, among other Islamic musical treatises, also contained additional division schemes as well as providing a gloss of the Greek system, as Aristoxenian doctrines were often included.

==Compositional forms==
The tetrachord, a fundamentally incomplete fragment, is the basis of two compositional forms constructed upon repetition of that fragment: the complaint and the litany.

The descending tetrachord from tonic to dominant, typically in minor (e.g. A–G–F–E in A minor), had been used since the Renaissance to denote a lamentation. Well-known cases include the ostinato bass of Dido&#x27;s aria &quot;When I am laid in earth&quot; in Henry Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;, the &quot;Crucifixus&quot; in Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor, BWV 232, or the &quot;Qui tollis&quot; in Mozart&#x27;s Mass in C minor, KV 427, etc. This tetrachord, known as &quot;lamento&quot; (&quot;complaint&quot;, &quot;lamentation&quot;), has been used until today. A variant form, the full chromatic descent (e.g. A–G–G–F–F–E in A minor), has been known as &quot;Passus duriusculus&quot; in the Baroque &quot;Figurenlehre&quot;.

There exists a short, free musical form of the Romantic Era, called &quot;complaint&quot; or &quot;complainte&quot; (Fr.) or lament. It is typically a set of harmonic variations in homophonic texture, wherein the bass descends through some tetrachord, possibly that of the previous paragraph, but usually one suggesting a minor mode. This tetrachord, treated as a very short ground bass, is repeated again and again over the length of the composition.

Another musical form, of the same time period, is the &quot;litany&quot; or &quot;litanie&quot; (Fr.), or &quot;lytanie&quot; (OE spur). It is also a set of harmonic variations in homophonic texture, but in contrast to the lament, here the tetrachordal fragment – ascending or descending and possibly reordered – is set in the upper voice in the manner of a chorale prelude. Because of the extreme brevity of the theme and number of repetitions required, and free of the binding of chord progression to tetrachord in the lament, the breadth of the harmonic excursion in litany is usually notable.

<text>The Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) (; ) is a Semi-presidential republic determined by the Sri Lankan Constitution. It administers the island from both its commercial capital of Colombo and the administrative capital of Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte.

==Constitution==
The Constitution of Sri Lanka has been the constitution of the island nation of Sri Lanka since its original promulgation by the National State Assembly on 7 September 1978. It is Sri Lanka&#x27;s second republican constitution and its third constitution since the country&#x27;s independence (as Ceylon) in 1948, after the Donoughmore Constitution, Soulbury Constitution, and Constitution of 1972. As of October 2020, it has been formally amended 21 times.

==Executive branch==
The President, directly elected for a five-year term, is head of state, head of government, chief executive, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The election occurs under the Sri Lankan form of the contingent vote. Responsible to Parliament for the exercise of duties under the constitution and laws, the president may be removed from office by a two-thirds vote of Parliament with the concurrence of the Supreme Court.

The President appoints and heads a cabinet of ministers responsible to Parliament. The president&#x27;s deputy is the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, who leads the ruling party in Parliament. The President can dissolve the cabinet and appoint a new one at any time.

==Legislative branch==
The Parliament has 225 members, elected for a six-year term, 196 members elected in multi-seat constituencies and 29 by proportional representation. The President may summon, suspend, or end a legislative session and dissolve Parliament any time after it has served for one year. Parliament reserves the power to make all laws.

The primary modification is that the party that receives the largest number of valid votes in each constituency gains a unique &quot;bonus seat&quot; (&quot;see&quot; Hickman, 1999). Since its independence in 1948, Sri Lanka has remained a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.

==Judicial branch==


The judiciary is the system of courts that interprets and applies the law in the country. It is set out in the constitution, which defines courts as independent institutions within the traditional framework of checks and balances. The Sri Lankan courts are presided over by professional judges, judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President with the nomination of the Parliamentary Council, others by the Judicial Service Commission.

Sri Lanka has a legal system which is an amalgam of English common law, Roman-Dutch civil law and Customary Law.

==Elections==

Sri Lanka elects on the national level a head of state - the president - and a legislature. The president is elected for a five-year term by the people. The Parliament has 225 members, elected for a five-year term, and 196 members elected in multi-seat constituencies through a proportional representation system where each party is allocated a number of seats from the quota for each district according to the proportion of the total vote that the party obtains in the district.

*1st - United National Party - from 1947 to 1951
*2nd - United National Party - from 1951 to 1956

<text>Health has a variety of definitions, which have been used for different purposes over time. In general, it refers to physical and emotional well-being, especially that associated with normal functioning of the human body, absent of disease, pain (including mental pain), or injury.

Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular physical exercise and adequate sleep, and by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities or situations, such as smoking or excessive stress. Some factors affecting health are due to individual choices, such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while others are due to structural causes, such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it easier or harder for people to get necessary healthcare services. Still, other factors are beyond both individual and group choices, such as genetic disorders.

== History ==

The meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the biomedical perspective, early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body&#x27;s ability to function; health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by disease. An example of such a definition of health is: &quot;a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and psychological integrity; ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with physical, biological, psychological, and social stress&quot;. Then, in 1948, in a radical departure from previous definitions, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a definition that aimed higher, linking health to well-being, in terms of &quot;physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity&quot;. Although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative, it was also criticized for being vague and excessively broad and was not construed as measurable. For a long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal, with most discussions of health returning to the practicality of the biomedical model.

Just as there was a shift from viewing disease as a state to thinking of it as a process, the same shift happened in definitions of health. Again, the WHO played a leading role when it fostered the development of the health promotion movement in the 1980s. This brought in a new conception of health, not as a state, but in dynamic terms of resiliency, in other words, as &quot;a resource for living&quot;. In 1984, WHO revised the definition of health defined it as &quot;the extent to which an individual or group is able to realize aspirations and satisfy needs and to change or cope with the environment. Health is a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living; it is a positive concept, emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities.&quot; Thus, health referred to the ability to maintain homeostasis and recover from adverse events. Mental, intellectual, emotional and social health referred to a person&#x27;s ability to handle stress, to acquire skills, to maintain relationships, all of which form resources for resiliency and independent living. This opens up many possibilities for health to be taught, strengthened and learned.

Since the late 1970s, the federal Healthy People Program has been a visible component of the United States&#x27; approach to improving population health. In each decade, a new version of Healthy People is issued, featuring updated goals and identifying topic areas and quantifiable objectives for health improvement during the succeeding ten years, with assessment at that point of progress or lack thereof. Progress has been limited to many objectives, leading to concerns about the effectiveness of Healthy People in shaping outcomes in the context of a decentralized and uncoordinated US health system. Healthy People 2020 gives more prominence to health promotion and preventive approaches and adds a substantive focus on the importance of addressing social determinants of health. A new expanded digital interface facilitates use and dissemination rather than bulky printed books as produced in the past. The impact of these changes to Healthy People will be determined in the coming years.

Systematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good health in humans are undertaken by health care providers. Applications with regard to animal health are covered by the veterinary sciences. The term &quot;healthy&quot; is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans, such as in the sense of healthy communities, healthy cities or healthy environments. In addition to health care interventions and a person&#x27;s surroundings, a number of other factors are known to influence the health status of individuals. These are referred to as the &quot;determinants of health&quot;, which include the individual&#x27;s background, lifestyle, economic status, social conditions and spirituality; Studies have shown that high levels of stress can affect human health.

In the first decade of the 21st century, the conceptualization of health as an ability opened the door for self-assessments to become the main indicators to judge the performance of efforts aimed at improving human health. It also created the opportunity for every person to feel healthy, even in the presence of multiple chronic diseases or a terminal condition, and for the re-examination of determinants of health (away from the traditional approach that focuses on the reduction of the prevalence of diseases).

==Determinants==
In general, the context in which an individual lives is of great importance for both his health status and quality of life. It is increasingly recognized that health is maintained and improved not only through the advancement and application of health science, but also through the efforts and intelligent lifestyle choices of the individual and society. According to the World Health Organization, the main determinants of health include the social and economic environment, the physical environment, and the person&#x27;s individual characteristics and behaviors.

More specifically, key factors that have been found to influence whether people are healthy or unhealthy include the following:
* Education and literacy
* Employment/working conditions
* Income and social status
* Physical environments
* Social environments
* Social support networks

* Biology and genetics
* Culture
* Gender
* Health care services
* Healthy child development
* Personal health practices and coping skills
An increasing number of studies and reports from different organizations and contexts examine the linkages between health and different factors, including lifestyles, environments, health care organization and health policy, one specific health policy brought into many countries in recent years was the introduction of the sugar tax. Beverage taxes came into light with increasing concerns about obesity, particularly among youth. Sugar-sweetened beverages have become a target of anti-obesity initiatives with increasing evidence of their link to obesity.—such as the 1974 Lalonde report from Canada; the Alameda County Study in California; and the series of World Health Reports of the World Health Organization, which focuses on global health issues including access to health care and improving public health outcomes, especially in developing countries.

The concept of the &quot;health field,&quot; as distinct from medical care, emerged from the Lalonde report from Canada. The report identified three interdependent fields as key determinants of an individual&#x27;s health. These are:
* Biomedical: all aspects of health, physical and mental, developed within the human body as influenced by genetic make-up.
* Environmental: all matters related to health external to the human body and over which the individual has little or no control;
* Lifestyle: the aggregation of personal decisions (i.e., over which the individual has control) that can be said to contribute to, or cause, illness or death;

The maintenance and promotion of health is achieved through different combination of physical, mental, and social well-being—a combination sometimes referred to as the &quot;health triangle.&quot; The WHO&#x27;s 1986 &quot;Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion&quot; further stated that health is not just a state, but also &quot;a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities.&quot;

Focusing more on lifestyle issues and their relationships with functional health, data from the Alameda County Study suggested that people can improve their health via exercise, enough sleep, spending time in nature, maintaining a healthy body weight, limiting alcohol use, and avoiding smoking. Health and illness can co-exist, as even people with multiple chronic diseases or terminal illnesses can consider themselves healthy.
The environment is often cited as an important factor influencing the health status of individuals. This includes characteristics of the natural environment, the built environment and the social environment. Factors such as clean water and air, adequate housing, and safe communities and roads all have been found to contribute to good health, especially to the health of infants and children. Some studies have shown that a lack of neighborhood recreational spaces including natural environment leads to lower levels of personal satisfaction and higher levels of obesity, linked to lower overall health and well-being. It has been demonstrated that increased time spent in natural environments is associated with improved self-reported health, suggesting that the positive health benefits of natural space in urban neighborhoods should be taken into account in public policy and land use.

Genetics, or inherited traits from parents, also play a role in determining the health status of individuals and populations. This can encompass both the predisposition to certain diseases and health conditions, as well as the habits and behaviors individuals develop through the lifestyle of their families. For example, genetics may play a role in the manner in which people cope with stress, either mental, emotional or physical. For example, obesity is a significant problem in the United States that contributes to poor mental health and causes stress in the lives of many people. One difficulty is the issue raised by the debate over the relative strengths of genetics and other factors; interactions between genetics and environment may be of particular importance.

===Potential issues===
A number of health issues are common around the globe. Disease is one of the most common. According to GlobalIssues.org, approximately 36 million people die each year from non-communicable (i.e., not contagious) diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease.

Among communicable diseases, both viral and bacterial, AIDS/HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria are the most common, causing millions of deaths every year.

Another health issue that causes death or contributes to other health problems is malnutrition, especially among children. One of the groups malnutrition affects most is young children. Approximately 7.5 million children under the age of 5 die from malnutrition, usually brought on by not having the money to find or make food.

Bodily injuries are also a common health issue worldwide. These injuries, including bone fractures and burns, can reduce a person&#x27;s quality of life or can cause fatalities including infections that resulted from the injury (or the severity injury in general).

Lifestyle choices are contributing factors to poor health in many cases. These include smoking cigarettes, and can also include a poor diet, whether it is overeating or an overly constrictive diet. Inactivity can also contribute to health issues and also a lack of sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, and neglect of oral hygiene. There are also genetic disorders that are inherited by the person and can vary in how much they affect the person (and when they surface).

Although the majority of these health issues are preventable, a major contributor to global ill health is the fact that approximately 1 billion people lack access to health care systems. Arguably, the most common and harmful health issue is that a great many people do not have access to quality remedies.

== Mental health ==

The World Health Organization describes mental health as &quot;a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community&quot;. Mental health is not just the absence of mental illness.

Mental illness is described as &#x27;the spectrum of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral conditions that interfere with social and emotional well-being and the lives and productivity of people. Having a mental illness can seriously impair, temporarily or permanently, the mental functioning of a person. Other terms include: &#x27;mental health problem&#x27;, &#x27;illness&#x27;, &#x27;disorder&#x27;, &#x27;dysfunction&#x27;.

Approximately twenty percent of all adults in the US are considered diagnosable with a mental disorder. Mental disorders are the leading cause of disability in the United States and Canada. Examples of these disorders include schizophrenia, ADHD, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and autism.

 Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:
* Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry
* Family history of mental health problems
* Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse

==Maintaining==
Achieving and maintaining health is an ongoing process, shaped by both the evolution of health care knowledge and practices as well as personal strategies and organized interventions for staying healthy.

===Diet===

An important way to maintain one&#x27;s personal health is to have a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide nutrients to the body. Such nutrients provide the body with energy and keep it running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones, muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e., blood pressure). Water is essential for growth, reproduction and good health. Macronutrients are consumed in relatively large quantities and include proteins, carbohydrates, and fats and fatty acids. Micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – are consumed in relatively smaller quantities, but are essential to body processes. The food guide pyramid is a pyramid-shaped guide of healthy foods divided into sections. Each section shows the recommended intake for each food group (i.e., protein, fat, carbohydrates and sugars). Making healthy food choices can lower one&#x27;s risk of heart disease and the risk of developing some types of cancer, and can help one maintain their weight within a healthy range.

The Mediterranean diet is commonly associated with health-promoting effects. This is sometimes attributed to the inclusion of bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds, isoprenoids and alkaloids.

===Exercise===

Physical exercise enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. It strengthens one&#x27;s bones and muscles and improves the cardiovascular system. According to the National Institutes of Health, there are four types of exercise: endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance. The CDC states that physical exercise can reduce the risks of heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, depression, and anxiety. For the purpose of counteracting possible risks, it is often recommended to start physical exercise gradually as one goes. Participating in any exercising, whether it is housework, yardwork, walking or standing up when talking on the phone, is often thought to be better than none when it comes to health.

===Sleep===

Sleep is an essential component to maintaining health. In children, sleep is also vital for growth and development. Ongoing sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk for some chronic health problems. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to correlate with both increased susceptibility to illness and slower recovery times from illness. In one study, people with chronic insufficient sleep, set as six hours of sleep a night or less, were found to be four times more likely to catch a cold compared to those who reported sleeping for seven hours or more a night. Due to the role of sleep in regulating metabolism, insufficient sleep may also play a role in weight gain or, conversely, in impeding weight loss. Additionally, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is the cancer research agency for the World Health Organization, declared that &quot;shiftwork that involves circadian disruption is probably carcinogenic to humans&quot;, speaking to the dangers of long-term nighttime work due to its intrusion on sleep. In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation released updated recommendations for sleep duration requirements based on age, and concluded that &quot;Individuals who habitually sleep outside the normal range may be exhibiting signs or symptoms of serious health problems or, if done volitionally, may be compromising their health and well-being.&quot;

===Role of science===
Health science is the branch of science focused on health. There are two main approaches to health science: the study and research of the body and health-related issues to understand how humans (and animals) function, and the application of that knowledge to improve health and to prevent and cure diseases and other physical and mental impairments. The science builds on many sub-fields, including biology, biochemistry, physics, epidemiology, pharmacology, medical sociology. Applied health sciences endeavor to better understand and improve human health through applications in areas such as health education, biomedical engineering, biotechnology and public health.

Organized interventions to improve health based on the principles and procedures developed through the health sciences are provided by practitioners trained in medicine, nursing, nutrition, pharmacy, social work, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy and other health care professions. Clinical practitioners focus mainly on the health of individuals, while public health practitioners consider the overall health of communities and populations. Workplace wellness programs are increasingly being adopted by companies for their value in improving the health and well-being of their employees, as are school health services to improve the health and well-being of children.

===Role of medicine and medical science===
Contemporary medicine is in general conducted within health care systems. Legal, credentialing and financing frameworks are established by individual governments, augmented on occasion by international organizations, such as churches. The characteristics of any given health care system have significant impact on the way medical care is provided.

From ancient times, Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals and the Catholic Church today remains the largest non-government provider of medical services in the world. Advanced industrial countries (with the exception of the United States) and many developing countries provide medical services through a system of universal health care that aims to guarantee care for all through a single-payer health care system, or compulsory private or co-operative health insurance. This is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay. Delivery may be via private medical practices or by state-owned hospitals and clinics, or by charities, most commonly by a combination of all three.

Most tribal societies provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole. In such societies, healthcare is available to those that can afford to pay for it or have self-insured it (either directly or as part of an employment contract) or who may be covered by care financed by the government or tribe directly.

Transparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system. Access to information on conditions, treatments, quality, and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients/consumers and, therefore, the incentives of medical professionals. While the US healthcare system has come under fire for lack of openness, new legislation may encourage greater openness. There is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other.

====Delivery====
Provision of medical care is classified into primary, secondary, and tertiary care categories.
Primary care medical services are provided by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care. These occur in physician offices, clinics, nursing homes, schools, home visits, and other places close to patients. About 90% of medical visits can be treated by the primary care provider. These include treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, preventive care and health education for all ages and both sexes.

Secondary care medical services are provided by medical specialists in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient. Referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists. These include both ambulatory care and inpatient services, Emergency departments, intensive care medicine, surgery services, physical therapy, labor and delivery, endoscopy units, diagnostic laboratory and medical imaging services, hospice centers, etc. Some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting.

Tertiary care medical services are provided by specialist hospitals or regional centers equipped with diagnostic and treatment facilities not generally available at local hospitals. These include trauma centers, burn treatment centers, advanced neonatology unit services, organ transplants, high-risk pregnancy, radiation oncology, etc.

Modern medical care also depends on information – still delivered in many health care settings on paper records, but increasingly nowadays by electronic means.

In low-income countries, modern healthcare is often too expensive for the average person. International healthcare policy researchers have advocated that &quot;user fees&quot; be removed in these areas to ensure access, although even after removal, significant costs and barriers remain.

Separation of prescribing and dispensing is a practice in medicine and pharmacy in which the physician who provides a medical prescription is independent from the pharmacist who provides the prescription drug. In the Western world there are centuries of tradition for separating pharmacists from physicians. In Asian countries, it is traditional for physicians to also provide drugs.

===Role of public health===


Public health has been described as &quot;the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals.&quot; It is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). Public health has many sub-fields, but typically includes the interdisciplinary categories of epidemiology, biostatistics and health services. environmental health, community health, behavioral health, and occupational health are also important areas of public health.

The focus of public health interventions is to prevent and manage diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behavior, communities, and (in aspects relevant to human health) environments. Its aim is to prevent health problems from happening or re-occurring by implementing educational programs, developing policies, administering services and conducting research. In many cases, treating a disease or controlling a pathogen can be vital to preventing it in others, such as during an outbreak. Vaccination programs and distribution of condoms to prevent the spread of communicable diseases are examples of common preventive public health measures, as are educational campaigns to promote vaccination and the use of condoms (including overcoming resistance to such).

Public health also takes various actions to limit the health disparities between different areas of the country and, in some cases, the continent or world. One issue is the access of individuals and communities to health care in terms of financial, geographical or socio-cultural constraints. Applications of the public health system include the areas of maternal and child health, health services administration, emergency response, and prevention and control of infectious and chronic diseases.

The great positive impact of public health programs is widely acknowledged. Due in part to the policies and actions developed through public health, the 20th century registered a decrease in the mortality rates for infants and children and a continual increase in life expectancy in most parts of the world. For example, it is estimated that life expectancy has increased for Americans by thirty years since 1900, and worldwide by six years since 1990.

===Self-care strategies===


Personal health depends partially on the active, passive, and assisted cues people observe and adopt about their own health. These include personal actions for preventing or minimizing the effects of a disease, usually a chronic condition, through integrative care. They also include personal hygiene practices to prevent infection and illness, such as bathing and washing hands with soap; brushing and flossing teeth; storing, preparing and handling food safely; and many others. The information gleaned from personal observations of daily living – such as about sleep patterns, exercise behavior, nutritional intake and environmental features – may be used to inform personal decisions and actions (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;I feel tired in the morning so I am going to try sleeping on a different pillow&quot;), as well as clinical decisions and treatment plans (&quot;e.g.&quot;, a patient who notices his or her shoes are tighter than usual may be having exacerbation of left-sided heart failure, and may require diuretic medication to reduce fluid overload).

Personal health also depends partially on the social structure of a person&#x27;s life. The maintenance of strong social relationships, volunteering, and other social activities have been linked to positive mental health and also increased longevity. One American study among seniors over age 70, found that frequent volunteering was associated with reduced risk of dying compared with older persons who did not volunteer, regardless of physical health status. Another study from Singapore reported that volunteering retirees had significantly better cognitive performance scores, fewer depressive symptoms, and better mental well-being and life satisfaction than non-volunteering retirees.

Prolonged psychological stress may negatively impact health, and has been cited as a factor in cognitive impairment with aging, depressive illness, and expression of disease. Stress management is the application of methods to either reduce stress or increase tolerance to stress. Relaxation techniques are physical methods used to relieve stress. Psychological methods include cognitive therapy, meditation, and positive thinking, which work by reducing response to stress. Improving relevant skills, such as problem solving and time management skills, reduces uncertainty and builds confidence, which also reduces the reaction to stress-causing situations where those skills are applicable.

==Occupational==

In addition to safety risks, many jobs also present risks of disease, illness and other long-term health problems. Among the most common occupational diseases are various forms of pneumoconiosis, including silicosis and coal worker&#x27;s pneumoconiosis (black lung disease). Asthma is another respiratory illness that many workers are vulnerable to. Workers may also be vulnerable to skin diseases, including eczema, dermatitis, urticaria, sunburn, and skin cancer. Other occupational diseases of concern include carpal tunnel syndrome and lead poisoning.

As the number of service sector jobs has risen in developed countries, more and more jobs have become sedentary, presenting a different array of health problems than those associated with manufacturing and the primary sector. Contemporary problems, such as the growing rate of obesity and issues relating to stress and overwork in many countries, have further complicated the interaction between work and health.

Many governments view occupational health as a social challenge and have formed public organizations to ensure the health and safety of workers. Examples of these include the British Health and Safety Executive and in the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which conducts research on occupational health and safety, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which handles regulation and policy relating to worker safety and health.

<text>In Greek mythology, Lotis (Ancient Greek: Λωτίς) was a nymph mentioned by Ovid.

== Mythology ==
In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot;, at the Liberalia festival, Priapus tried to rape the nymph Lotis when everyone had fallen asleep, but she was awakened by a sudden cry of Silenus&#x27;s donkey and ran off, leaving Priapus in embarrassment as everyone else woke up too and became aware of his intentions. In another work of his however, the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Lotis escaped Priapus only when she was changed into a lotus, either a plant or the lotus tree; later, Dryope picked a flower off the tree Lotis had become, and was transformed into a black poplar. This narrative is only found in one more author, Servius.

In Book 6 of the &quot;Fasti&quot; Ovid tells much the same story, but with the goddess Vesta rather than Lotis as the intended victim. According to some sources, Lotis was the daughter of Nereus. Ovid suggests that Priapus later kills the donkey.

What the &#x27;lotus&#x27; (if not the tree) that Lotis turned into is has stirred much debate. Ovid describes it as having reddish-purple flowers and growing near water; the Indian lotus and the water lily have both been suggested but also rejected by a number of scholars on account of them growing &quot;in&quot; water and not &quot;near&quot; it. Counter-arguments in favour of those plants include the fact that while they are rooted in sediments of water bodies, they do not grow in water over eight feet deep (that is, they grow in very shallow water). Servius, on the other hand, writes that Lotis became the tree.

The story does not seem to feature in Ancient Greek vase-painting, and only occasionally in later art. Priapus and Lotis appear in the right foreground of &quot;The Feast of the Gods&quot; by Giovanni Bellini (c. 1514), in an engraving by Giovanni Battista Palumba (c. 1510), and a drawing by Parmigianino of the 1530s. Bellini keeps Priapus&#x27;s aroused state visible under his clothes, Palumba has it out in the open, as Parmigianino originally did, but this has been altered subsequently, as very explicit details often were in art. There are also some depictions of Lotis as a tree.

<doc id="80387" wikidata="Q619300" url="?curid=80387" title="Hamadryad">
<text>In Greek mythology, a Hamadryad or Hamadryas (; ) is a tree nymph. They are born bonded to a certain tree on which their life depends. Some maintain that a Hamadryad is the tree itself, with a normal dryad being simply the indwelling entity, or spirit, of the tree. If the tree should die, the Hamadryad associated with it would die as well. For this reason, both dryads and the other gods would punish mortals who harmed trees.

==Etymology==
The name of the Hamadryades was compounded from the ancient Greek words háma (, Doric: , &quot;together, concurrently&quot;) and dryás (, &quot;tree, wood nymph&quot;). This informs the understanding that the life of a Hamadryas is concurrent with that of its tree: one cannot exist without the other.

==List of Hamadryads==

The Deipnosophistae of Athenaeus lists eight Hamadryads, the daughters of Oxylus and Hamadryas:

* Karya (walnut or hazelnut)
* Balanos (oak)
* Kraneia (dogwood)
* Morea (mulberry)
* Aigeiros (black poplar)
* Ptelea (elm)
* Ampelos (vines, especially &quot;Vitis&quot;)
* Syke/Sykea (fig)

=== Other Hamadryads ===

* Atlanteia
* Chrysopeleia
* Phoebe
* Byblis
* Dryope
* Heliades
* Hesperides

==Scientific names==
The mother, Hamadryas, is immortalized in three scientific names, two of which are still valid: the generic name of the cracker butterfly, the specific name of the northernmost monkey in Asia Minor, the hamadryas baboon, and the original (but no longer valid) genus name of the king cobra (originally &quot;Hamadryas hannah&quot;, now &quot;Ophiophagus hannah&quot;). The cracker butterfly is more arboreal than most butterflies, as it commonly camouflages itself on trees. It feeds on sap, rotting fruit and dung. The hamadryas baboon is one of the least arboreal monkeys, but was the most common monkey in Hellenic lands. The king cobra is sometimes considered arboreal or semi-arboreal, and is also referred to by the common name &quot;hamadryad&quot;, especially in older literature.

<doc id="80388" wikidata="Q744147" url="?curid=80388" title="Iole">
<text>In Greek mythology, Iole (; ) was the daughter of King Eurytus of Oechalia. According to the brief epitome in the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, Eurytus had a beautiful young daughter named Iole who was eligible for marriage. Iole was claimed by Heracles for a bride, but Eurytus refused her hand in marriage. Iole was indirectly the cause of Heracles&#x27; death because of his wife&#x27;s jealousy of her.

There are different versions of the mythology of Iole from many ancient sources. The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; gives the most complete story followed by slight variations of this from Seneca and Ovid. Other ancient sources (i.e. Diodorus Siculus, Gaius Julius Hyginus, and Pseudo-Plutarch) have similar information on Iole with additional variations.

== Mythology ==
=== Heracles&#x27; love for Iole leads to his death ===
Apollodorus recounted the tale in his &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;. King Eurytus was an expert archer who taught his sons his knowledge of the bow and arrow. He promised his daughter Iole to whoever could beat him and his sons in an archery contest. The sons shot so well that they beat all the others from the kingdom. Heracles then heard of the prize and eagerly entered the contest, for he desired the maiden. Heracles shot with keenness and even beat Eurytus&#x27; scores. It is ironic because Eurytus, in his early years, had taught Heracles to become an archer.

When the king realized that Heracles was winning, he stopped the contest and forbade him to participate. Eurytus was well-aware of Heracles&#x27; murder of his previous wife Megara and their children, and was thus afraid that Iole and her offspring by him would suffer the same fate. Eventually, Heracles had won the contest but was not entitled to the prize because of his reputation. Eurytus broke his promise to give his royal daughter to the winner of the archery contest.

Iphitos urged his father to reconsider, but Eurytus did not pay any heed and stood by his decision. Heracles had not left the city yet when Eurytus&#x27; mares were run off, presumably by Autolycus, a notorious thief. Iphitos asked Heracles to help him find them, which he agreed to do so. Heracles, in one display of his madness, hurled Iphitos over the city walls, murdering him. According to Diodorus Siculus, it was Heracles himself who drove off the mares of Eurytus in revenge. The hero had failed in his courtship to win Iole.

After the archery contest, Heracles went to Calydon, where, on the steps of the temple, he saw Deianira, Prince Meleager&#x27;s sister. He forgot about Iole for a while and wooed her, eventually won her over and married her. Heracles, after acquiring a kingdom and in control of an army, went about to kill Eurytus in revenge for not giving up his promised prize. Hyginus added that Heracles not only murdered Eurytus, but also slew Iole&#x27;s brothers and other relatives as well.

The hero plundered Oechalia and overthrew its walls, while Iole threw herself down from the high city wall to escape. It turned out that the garment she was wearing opened up and acted like a parachute, which ensured her soft and safe descent. Heracles took Iole as a captive. His wife, Deianira, did not want Iole to become Heracles&#x27; concubine but she forbore to object and tolerated it temporarily.

Deianira feared she would lose Heracles to the younger and more beautiful Iole. Years earlier, the centaur Nessus had ferried her across the river Evenus and attempted to rape her when they were on the other side. Heracles saved her from Nessus by shooting him with poisoned arrows. She had kept some of Nessus&#x27; blood, for the centaur told her, with his dying breath, that if she were to give Heracles a cloak (chiton) soaked in his blood, it would be a love charm. Deianira, concerned by Heracles&#x27; infidelity, believed Nessus’ lie that Heracles would no longer desire any other woman after he was under the spell of the love philter. This seemed like the solution to her problem of reclaiming her husband&#x27;s love from Iole, the foreign concubine. The cloak was delivered to Heracles and, when he put it on, the poison went into his body. Deianira had unwittingly poisoned her husband with this purported love potion. Upon realizing the mistake she had made, Deianira killed herself. Because of his love for Iole, Heracles asked his eldest son Hyllus to marry her so that she would be well taken care of. Iole and Hyllus had a son called Cleodaeus, and also three daughters, Evaechme, Aristaechme, and Hyllis.
=== Versions of the tale ===
====Ovid&#x27;s account====
Ovid&#x27;s version of this story (&quot;Heroides&quot; 9) has Heracles under the erotic control of Iole. She specifically has Heracles wear women&#x27;s clothing and perform women&#x27;s work. Heracles, all the while, is bragging about his heroic deeds. However, Deianira reminds him how he is dressed in feminine attire and Iole is wearing his clothing while carrying his club. Deianira ultimately urges silence from him. The same version shows the disgrace and shame of Heracles, who was once a strong warrior fighter, outwitted by Iole in being made to do effeminate acts. In this skillful crafty manner, she had avenged her father&#x27;s death.

====Sophocles&#x27; account====
According to Sophocles&#x27; play &quot;Women of Trachis&quot;, Iole&#x27;s mother was Antiope and her siblings were Iphitos, Clytius, Toxeus, Deioneus, Molion, and Didaeon. In the play, Iole is described as the daughter of King Eurytus, the royal princess of Oechalia. She is among the captive maidens of Oechalia when Heracles ransacks the city. She is to become the concubine of Heracles. Toward the end of the play, Heracles asks his son Hyllus to marry her when he dies, so she will be well taken care of. Hyllus agrees to do this for his father.

====Seneca&#x27;s account====
According to Seneca, Deianira is concerned that the captive Iole, who Heracles took as his concubine, will give brothers to her sons. She fears that Iole will become a daughter-in-law of Jove. He explains how Deianira thinks of the possible children of Heracles by Iole and her chance for vengeance on them. He shows the same jealousy Deianira has of Iole as does Apollodorus.

==Appearances in popular culture==
Iole appeared in cinema as early as the 1958 film &quot;Hercules&quot;. She was portrayed by model/actress Sylva Koscina. She is the daughter of King Pelias of Iolcus and cousin of Jason. She first meets Hercules after he saves her from a wild chariot ride and returns her safely home. She vouches for Hercules&#x27; identity as the man hired by her father to train her brother Iphitus in the art of war. While he remains in the kingdom, Iole quickly falls in love with Hercules but their romance sours over the death of Iphitis during Hercules&#x27; battle with a lion. Despite her outward rejection of Hercules, she continues to love him and waits for his return once he joins Jason&#x27;s quest for the Golden Fleece. It is eventually revealed Iole&#x27;s father plotted the murder of his brother Aeson so he could inherit the rule of Iolcus. Once Hercules and Jason return and confront Pelias with the truth, Pelias&#x27; army is defeated and he commits suicide. After Jason assumes the throne as King of Iolcus, Iole leaves with Hercules aboard the Argo to begin a new life together. Koscina reprised the role the following year in &quot;Hercules Unchained&quot;. In the sequel, Iole is happily married to Hercules and they return to Hercules&#x27; homeland of Thebes to start their married life. Iole, however, becomes a prisoner of Thebes&#x27; deranged king Eteocles in his attempt to punish Hercules for allegedly siding with Eteocles&#x27; brother Polinices in their civil war for the throne of Thebes. Aided in her attempt to escape Thebes, Iole is then captured by Polinices&#x27; mercenary army of Argives. After the final battle between Thebes and the Argives, she is rescued by Hercules.

Iole appears in the 1963 film &quot;Hercules, Samson and Ulysses&quot;. The film is a sequel to the 1959 film &quot;Hercules Unchained&quot;; however, the role of Iole is portrayed by Diletta D&#x27;Andrea, replacing Sylva Koscina. She is still married to Hercules and is mother to a little boy who she raises in the house of King Laertes of Ithaca. She shows grave concern for Hercules&#x27; newest mission to destroy a sea monster menacing the fishing waters off the coast of the kingdom. When news is returned home that Hercules and his crew have been shipwrecked, she urges King Laertes to muster a rescue party. She joins the voyage aboard the &quot;Argo&quot; and reunites with Hercules off the coast of Judea where the couple bid farewell to Hercules&#x27; newest ally Samson and sail home.

Iole appears in &quot;Hercules in the Underworld&quot;, played by Marley Shelton. She is a Neurian Maiden, one trained in the art of seduction. She recruits Hercules to help her village because a portal to the underworld has opened up. Though she already has a boyfriend named Lycastus, in an effort to persuade Hercules to help, she attempts to seduce him and manages to kiss him, but he remains faithful to his wife Deianeira and says he&#x27;ll help her village because it is the right thing to do. Similar to the original myth, Deianeira becomes suspicious of the two spending time together as they travel to her village and sends Hercules a cloak smeared with Nessus&#x27;s blood, thinking it will keep Hercules faithful to her. Instead, the cloak tries to strangle him when he puts it on, but he manages to destroy it. After Hercules manages to solve the portal problem, Iole decides to start a family with Lycastus.

Iole appears as a little girl in 2005&#x27;s mini-series &quot;Hercules&quot;; she is the daughter of Eurystheus and Megara. In an attempt to bring peace between the two branches of the family, Hercules asks for his son Hyllas to be betrothed to Iole should he fulfill one of his Labours: capturing/shooting the Cerynian Hind; he&#x27;s successful, but Eurystheus refuses, having been foretold that Iole&#x27;s husband would eventually kill him. This is later proved true when Hyllas throws a knife at the king.

Iole was a pseudonym adopted by Letitia Elizabeth Landon over a period from 1825 to 1826.

=== Middle Age tradition ===
She is remembered in &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot;, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 136162. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.

<text>In Greek mythology, Amphissus (Ancient Greek: Ἄμφίσσος) was the son of Apollo and Dryope. In Ovid&#x27;s accounts, he is mentioned to be the son of Andraemon and Dryope. Amphissus eventually built a temple to his father in the city he founded, Amphissa.

== Mythology ==
Apollo found Dryope tending her sheep on a mountainside while she was being accompanied by other dryads. The god hid behind a tree and watched her, and later on, he disguised himself as a turtle in order for him to get closer to her. Dryope claimed the turtle as hers. Then, to scare away the other dryads, Apollo turned into a snake to chased them away and coupled with Dryope. This is how she came with child, Amphissus.

In Ovid&#x27;s accounts, his mother Dryope picked a lotus for him, which turned out to be a nymph. It caused Dryope to become a lotus tree.

<text>In Greek mythology the name Andraemon (; ) may refer to:

*Andraemon, son of Oxylus and husband of Dryope.
*Andraemon, possible father of another Oxylus.
*Andraemon, an Aetolian king and husband of Gorge of Calydon. By the latter, he became the father of Thoas. Andraemon succeeded his father-in-law Oeneus&#x27; power over Aetolia. He and his wife were buried in one tomb which was shown in the city of Amphissa.
*Andraemon, brother of Leonteus. He married Amphinome, a daughter of Pelias.
*Andraemon, one of the Suitors of Penelope who came from Dulichium along with other 56 wooers. He, with the other suitors, was slain by Odysseus with the aid of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus.
*Andraemon, a son of King Codrus. He participated in the colonization of Asia Minor and drove the Carians out of the city of Lebedus. His tomb was shown near Colophon. Mimnermus related that Andraemon was a native of Pylos and founder of Colophon.

Similarly Andraemonides was a patronymic, frequently used to refer to Thoas, son of Andraemon and Gorge.

<text>Echidnas (), sometimes known as spiny anteaters, are quill-covered monotremes (egg-laying mammals) belonging to the family Tachyglossidae , living in Australia and New Guinea. The four extant species of echidnas and the platypus are the only living mammals that lay eggs and the only surviving members of the order Monotremata. The diet of some species consists of ants and termites, but they are not closely related to the American true anteaters or to hedgehogs. Their young are called puggles.

Echidnas evolved between 20 and 50 million years ago, descending from a platypus-like monotreme. This ancestor was aquatic, but echidnas adapted to life on land.

==Etymology==
Echidnas are possibly named after Echidna, a creature from Greek mythology who was half-woman, half-snake, as the animal was perceived to have qualities of both mammals and reptiles.
An alternative explanation is a confusion with .
==Physical characteristics==
Echidnas are medium-sized, solitary mammals covered with coarse hair and spines. The spines are modified hairs and are made of keratin, the same fibrous protein that makes up fur, claws, nails, and horn sheaths in animals.

Superficially, they resemble the anteaters of South America and other spiny mammals such as hedgehogs and porcupines. They are usually black or brown in coloration. There have been several reports of albino echidnas with pink eyes and white spines. They have elongated and slender snouts, or proboscises, that function as both mouth and nose, and which have electrosensors to find earthworms, termites, ants, and other burrowing prey. This is similar to the platypus, which has 40,000 electroreceptors on its bill, but the long-beaked echidna has only 2,000, while the short-beaked echidna, which lives in a drier environment, has no more than 400 at the tip of its snout. 

Echidnas have short, strong limbs with large claws, and are powerful diggers. Their hind claws are elongated and curved backwards to aid in digging. Echidnas have tiny mouths and toothless jaws, and feed by tearing open soft logs, anthills and the like, and licking off prey with their long, sticky tongues. The ears are slits on the sides of their heads under the spines. The external ear is created by a large cartilaginous funnel, deep in the muscle. At 33 °C (91.4 °F), echidnas also possess the second-lowest active body temperature of all mammals, behind the platypus.

Despite their appearance, echidnas are capable swimmers, as they evolved from platypus-like ancestors. When swimming, they expose their snout and some of their spines, and are known to journey to water to bathe.

The first European drawing of an echidna was made in Adventure Bay, Tasmania by &#x27;s third lieutenant George Tobin during William Bligh&#x27;s second breadfruit voyage.

==Diet==
The short-beaked echidna&#x27;s diet consists mostly of ants and termites, while the &quot;Zaglossus&quot; (long-beaked) species typically eat worms and insect larvae. The tongues of long-beaked echidnas have sharp, tiny spines that help them capture their prey. They have no teeth, so they break down their food by grinding it between the bottoms of their mouths and their tongues. Echidnas&#x27; faeces are long and are cylindrical in shape; they are usually broken and unrounded, and composed largely of dirt and ant-hill material.

Like all mammals, echidnas feed their young on milk, which contains various factors to sustain their growth and development.

==Habitat==
Echidnas do not tolerate extreme temperatures; they shelter from harsh weather in caves and rock crevices. Echidnas are found in forests and woodlands, hiding under vegetation, roots or piles of debris. They sometimes use the burrows (both abandoned and in use) of animals such as rabbits and wombats. Individual echidnas have large, mutually overlapping territories.

==Anatomy==
Echidnas and platypuses are the only egg-laying mammals, the monotremes.
The average lifespan of an echidna in the wild is estimated at 14–16 years. Fully grown females can weigh about , the males 33% larger, at about . Though the internal reproductive organs differ, both sexes possess an identical single cloaca opening for urination, defecation, and mating.

Male echidnas have non-venomous spurs on the hind feet, similar to the venomous male platypus.

Due to their low metabolism and accompanying stress resistance, echidnas are long-lived for their size; the longest recorded lifespan for a captive echidna is 50 years, with anecdotal accounts of wild individuals reaching 45 years. 

The echidna&#x27;s brain is half neocortex, compared to 80% of a human brain. Contrary to previous research, the echidna does enter REM sleep, but only in a comfortable temperature around 25 °C (77 °F). At lower or higher temperatures of 15 °C (59 °F) and 28 °C (82 °F), REM sleep is suppressed.

==Reproduction==
The female lays a single soft-shelled, leathery egg 22 days after mating, and deposits it directly into her pouch. An egg weighs and is about long. While hatching, the baby echidna opens the leather shell with a reptile-like egg tooth. Hatching takes place after 10 days of gestation; the young echidna, called a puggle, born larval and fetus-like, then sucks milk from the pores of the two milk patches (monotremes have no teats) and remains in the pouch for 45 to 55 days, at which time it starts to develop spines. The mother digs a nursery burrow and deposits the young, returning every five days to suckle it until it is weaned at seven months. Puggles will stay within their mother&#x27;s den for up to a year before leaving.Male echidnas have a four-headed penis. During mating, the heads on one side &quot;shut down&quot; and do not grow in size; the other two are used to release semen into the female&#x27;s two-branched reproductive tract. Each time it copulates, it alternates heads in sets of two. When not in use, the penis is retracted inside a preputial sac in the cloaca. The male echidna&#x27;s penis is long when erect, and its shaft is covered with penile spines. These may be used to induce ovulation in the female.
&lt;section begin=ejaculation /&gt;
It is a challenge to study the echidna in its natural habitat, and they show no interest in mating while in captivity. Prior to 2007, no one had ever seen an echidna ejaculate. There have been previous attempts, trying to force the echidna to ejaculate through the use of electrically stimulated ejaculation in order to obtain semen samples but this has only resulted in the penis swelling.
&lt;section end=ejaculation /&gt;
Breeding season begins in late June and extends through September. During mating season, a female may be followed by a line or &quot;train&quot; of up to ten males, the youngest trailing last, and some males switching between lines.

==Threats==
Echidnas are very timid. When frightened, they attempt to partially bury themselves and curl into a ball similar to a hedgehog. Strong front arms allow echidnas to dig in and hold fast against a predator pulling them from the hole.

Their many predators include feral cats, foxes, domestic dogs, and goannas. Snakes pose a large threat when they slither into echidna burrows and prey on the spineless young puggles.

They are easily stressed and injured by handling. Some ways to help echidnas include picking up litter, causing less pollution, planting vegetation for shelter, supervising pets, reporting hurt echidnas, and leaving them undisturbed.

In June 2024, scientists reported a first-of-its-kind encounter when they witnessed a tiger shark regurgitating a whole echidna off the cost of an island near Australia. Sharks are known to eat a wide range of animals, and occasionally objects, according to a news release by the researchers from James Cook University in North Queensland who also noted that sharks had previously been observed eating rocks for no apparent reason. 

==Evolution==

The divergence between oviparous (egg-laying) and viviparous (offspring develop internally) mammals is believed to date to the Triassic period. Most findings from genetics studies (especially of nuclear genes) are in agreement with the paleontological dating, but some other evidence, like mitochondrial DNA, give slightly different dates.

Molecular clock data suggest echidnas split from platypuses between 19 and 48 million years ago, so that platypus-like fossils dating back to over 112.5 million years ago represent basal forms, rather than close relatives of the modern platypus. This would imply that echidnas evolved from water-foraging ancestors that returned to land living, which put them in competition with marsupials. Although extant monotremes lack adult teeth (platypuses have teeth only as juveniles), many extinct monotreme species have been identified based on the morphology of their teeth. Of the eight genes involved in tooth development, four have been lost in both platypus and echidna, indicating that the loss of teeth occurred before the echidna-platypus split. 

Further evidence of water-foraging ancestors can be found in some of the echidna&#x27;s anatomy, including hydrodynamic streamlining, dorsally projecting hind limbs acting as rudders, and locomotion founded on hypertrophied humeral long-axis rotation, which provides an efficient swimming stroke. 

Oviparous reproduction in monotremes may give them an advantage over marsupials in some environments. Their observed adaptive radiation contradicts the assumption that monotremes are frozen in morphological and molecular evolution.

It has been suggested that echidnas originally evolved in New Guinea when it was isolated from Australia and from marsupials. This would explain their rarity in the fossil record, their abundance in present times in New Guinea, and their original adaptation to terrestrial niches, presumably without competition from marsupials.

==Taxonomy==
Echidnas are a small clade with two extant genera and four species. The genus &quot;Zaglossus&quot; includes three extant and two fossil species, with only one extant species from the genus &quot;Tachyglossus&quot;. 

===&quot;Zaglossus&quot;===

The three living &quot;Zaglossus&quot; species are endemic to New Guinea. They are rare and are hunted for food. They forage in leaf litter on the forest floor, eating earthworms and insects. The species are
*Western long-beaked echidna (&quot;Z. bruijni&quot;), of the highland forests;
*Sir David&#x27;s long-beaked echidna (&quot;Z. attenboroughi&quot;), discovered by Western science in 1961 (described in 1998) and preferring a still higher habitat;
*Eastern long-beaked echidna (&quot;Z. bartoni&quot;), of which four distinct subspecies have been identified.

===&quot;Tachyglossus&quot;===

The short-beaked echidna (&quot;Tachyglossus aculeatus&quot;) is found in southern, southeast and northeast New Guinea, and also occurs in almost all Australian environments, from the snow-clad Australian Alps to the deep deserts of the Outback, essentially anywhere ants and termites are available. It is smaller than the &quot;Zaglossus&quot; species, and it has longer hair.
Despite the similar dietary habits and methods of consumption to those of an anteater, there is no evidence supporting the idea that echidna-like monotremes have been myrmecophagic (ant or termite-eating) since the Cretaceous. The fossil evidence of invertebrate-feeding bandicoots and rat-kangaroos, from around the time of the platypus–echidna divergence and pre-dating &quot;Tachyglossus&quot;, show evidence that echidnas expanded into new ecospace despite competition from marsupials.

Additionally, extinct echidnas continue to be described by taxonomists;

===&quot;Megalibgwilia&quot;===
The genus &quot;Megalibgwilia&quot; is known only from fossils:

*&quot;M. owenii&quot; from Late Pleistocene sites in Australia;
*&quot;M. robusta&quot; from Pliocene sites in Australia.

===&quot;Murrayglossus&quot;===
The genus &quot;Murrayglossus&quot; is known only from fossils:
* &quot;M. hacketti&quot; (previously classified in the genus &quot;Zaglossus&quot;) from Pleistocene of Western Australia.

== As food ==
The Kunwinjku people of Western Arnhem Land (Australia) call the echidna &quot;ngarrbek&quot;, and regard it as a prized food and &quot;good medicine&quot;. The echidna is hunted at night, gutted, and filled with hot stones and mandak (&quot;Persoonia falcata&quot;) leaves. According to Larrakia elders Una Thompson and Stephanie Thompson Nganjmirra, once captured, an echidna is carried attached to the wrist like a thick bangle.

==In popular culture==
* The echidna appears on the reverse of the Australian five-cent coin.
* An echidna named Millie was one of the three official mascots for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.
* The &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; franchise features a race of anthropomorphic echidnas, the most prominent being Knuckles.

<text>What Makes Sammy Run? (1941) is a novel by Budd Schulberg inspired by the life of his father, early Hollywood mogul B. P. Schulberg. It is a rags to riches story chronicling the rise and fall of Sammy Glick, a Jewish boy born in New York&#x27;s Lower East Side who, very early in his life, makes up his mind to escape the ghetto and climb the ladder of success by deception and betrayal. It was made into a 1965 Broadway musical.

==Plot summary==
Told in first person narrative by Al Manheim, drama critic of &quot;The New York Record&quot;, this is the tale of Sammy Glick, a young uneducated boy who rises from copyboy to the top of the screenwriting profession in 1930s Hollywood by backstabbing others.

Manheim recalls how he first met the 16-year-old Sammy Glick when Sammy was working as a copyboy at Manheim&#x27;s newspaper. Both awed and disturbed by Sammy&#x27;s aggressive personality, Manheim becomes Sammy&#x27;s primary observer, mentor and, as Sammy asserts numerous times, best friend.

Tasked with taking Manheim&#x27;s column down to the printing room, one day Glick rewrites Manheim&#x27;s column, impressing the managing editor and gaining a column of his own. Later he steals a piece by an aspiring young writer, Julian Blumberg, sending it under his own name to the famous Hollywood talent agent Myron Selznick. Glick sells the piece, &quot;Girl Steals Boy&quot;, for $10,000 and leaves the paper to go to work in Hollywood, leaving behind his girlfriend, Rosalie Goldbaum. When the film of &quot;Girl Steals Boy&quot; opens, Sammy is credited for &quot;original screenplay&quot; and Blumberg is not acknowledged.

Glick rises to the top in Hollywood over the succeeding years, paying Blumberg a small salary under the table to be his ghost writer. He even manages to have &quot;his&quot; stageplay, &quot;Live Wire&quot;, performed at the Hollywood Playhouse. Although the script is actually a case of plagiarism, &quot;The Front Page&quot; in flimsy disguise, no one except Manheim seems to notice. Sammy&#x27;s bluffing also includes talking about books he has never read.

Manheim, whose ambitions are much more modest, is both fascinated and disgusted by the figure of Sammy Glick, and Manheim carefully chronicles his rise. In Hollywood, Manheim is disheartened to learn that Catherine &quot;Kit&quot; Sargent, a novelist and screenwriter he greatly admires, has fallen for Sammy&#x27;s charms. Although Manheim is quite open about his feelings for Kit, she makes it clear she prefers Sammy, especially in bed. When she met Sammy, she told Manheim, she had &quot;this crazy desire to know what it felt like to have all that driving ambition and frenzy and violence inside me.&quot;

Manheim also describes the Hollywood system in detail, as a money machine oppressive to talented writers. The bosses prefer to have carte blanche when dealing with their writers, ranging from having them work on a week-to-week basis to giving them a seven-year contract. In the film industry, Manheim remarks at one point in the novel, it is the rule rather than the exception that &quot;convictions are for sale,&quot; with people double-crossing each other whenever the slightest chance presents itself to them. Hollywood, he notices, regularly and efficiently turns out three products: moving pictures, ambition, and fear. Manheim becomes an eyewitness to the birth of what was to become the Writers Guild, an organization created to protect the interests of the screenwriters.

After one of the studio&#x27;s periodic reshufflings, Manheim finds himself out of work and goes back to New York. There, still preoccupied with Sammy Glick&#x27;s rise to stardom, he investigates Sammy&#x27;s past. He comes to understand, at least to some degree, &quot;the machinery that turns out Sammy Glicks&quot; and &quot;the anarchy of the poor&quot;. Manheim realizes that Sammy grew up in the &quot;dog-eat-dog world&quot; of New York&#x27;s Lower East Side (Rivington Street), much like the more sophisticated dog-eat-dog world of Hollywood. The one connection between Sammy&#x27;s childhood days and his present position seems to be Sheik, someone who went to school with Sammy and regularly beat him up. Now Sheik is working as Glick&#x27;s personal servant (or quasi-slave)—possibly some kind of belated act of revenge on Sammy&#x27;s part, or the &quot;victim&#x27;s triumph&quot;.

When Manheim returns to Hollywood he becomes one of Glick&#x27;s writers. There he realizes that there is also a small minority of honorable men working in pictures, especially producer Sidney Fineman, Glick&#x27;s boss. Manheim teams up with Kit Sargent to write several films for Glick, who has successfully switched to production and moved into a gigantic manor in Beverly Hills.

Fineman&#x27;s position becomes compromised by a string of flops, and Manheim attempts to convince Harrington, a Wall Street banker representing the film company&#x27;s financiers, that Fineman is still the right man for the job. This is the moment when Glick sees his chance to get rid of Fineman altogether and take his place. At a reception, Glick meets Laurette, Harrington&#x27;s daughter; he immediately and genuinely falls in love with this &quot;golden girl,&quot; discarding his girlfriend. He feels that he is about to kill two birds with one stone by uniting his personal ambition and his love life.

Fineman, only 56, dies soon after losing his job to Sammy—of a broken heart, it is rumoured. Sammy&#x27;s wedding is described by Manheim as &quot;a marriage-to-end-all-marriages&quot; staged in the beautiful setting of Sammy&#x27;s estate. Manheim and Kit Sargent, who have finally decided to get married, slip away early to be by themselves. Sammy discovers Laurette making love in the guest room to Carter Judd, an actor Sammy has just hired. Laurette is not repentant: She coldbloodedly admits that she considers their marriage to be purely a business affair.

Sammy calls Manheim and asks him to come over to his place immediately. Once there, Manheim for the first time witnesses a self-conscious, desperate, and suffering Sammy Glick who cannot stand being alone in his big house. In the end, Sammy orders Sheik to get him a prostitute, while Manheim drives home.

== Analysis ==
The leitmotif of the novel, which is also expressed in the title, is Sammy&#x27;s running. Sammy Glick is &quot;running people down&quot;; he is running &quot;with death as the only finish line&quot;; &quot;without a single principle to slow him down&quot;; &quot;always thinking satisfaction is just around the bend.&quot; Manheim realizes that &quot;everybody&quot; is running, but that Sammy Glick is just running faster than the rest. Sammy&#x27;s running is highly symbolic: he runs both literally and metaphorically. At one point, Manheim talks about Sammy&#x27;s &quot;undeclared war against the world&quot;, at another about Sammy Glick&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. Convinced that Jews should help each other, Manheim himself continuously tries to &quot;revive the victims he left behind him as he kept hitting-and-running his way to the top&quot;. For example, he intervenes on Blumberg&#x27;s behalf so that eventually his name appears in the credits.

== Reception and legacy ==
In &quot;Goldwyn: A Biography of the Man Behind the Myth&quot; (1976), Arthur Marx reveals that Samuel Goldwyn offered Schulberg money to not have it published because Goldwyn felt that the author was &quot;doublecrossing the Jews&quot; and perpetuating anti-Semitism by making Sammy Glick so venal. In his introduction to the 1990 reissue of the novel, Schulberg wrote, &quot;Since Sammy is obviously Jewish, I thought it should be clear that nearly all his victims—Rosalie, Manheim, Blumberg, Fineman, his brother, Israel—were also Jewish, suggesting the wide range of personalities and attitudes under the one ethnic umbrella.&quot;

When Schulberg wrote the novel, he was a member of the Communist Party of the USA. High-ranking party member John Howard Lawson ordered Schulberg to make extensive changes to the novel to better fit Communist principles. Schulberg refused and quit the party in protest, and a decade later testified before the House Unamerican Activities Committee about Communist influence in Hollywood and to identify other party members.

When the book was published, there was much speculation that the character of Sammy Glick was based on producer Jerry Wald. Schulberg later admitted that Wald was one of his models, but &quot;not the only one.&quot; In his book &quot;Competing With Idiots,&quot; writer Nick Davis points to his great-uncle Joseph L. Mankiewicz as another possible model for Glick: &quot;Sammy Glick was a beautiful embodiment of all of [Hollywood&#x27;s] most horrible characters rolled up into one hugely unsympathetic, grasping ball of ambition, who reminded more than one Hollywood reader of Joe.&quot;

==Dramatizations==
*&quot;What Makes Sammy Run?&quot; was first dramatized as a live television drama starring José Ferrer on April 10, 1949, on &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot;.
*On September 27 and October 4, 1959, on &quot;NBC Sunday Showcase&quot;, Larry Blyden starred as Sammy Glick in a two-part television broadcast on NBC-TV. John Forsythe played Al Manheim, Barbara Rush was Kit Sargent, and Dina Merrill was Laurette Harrington.
*On February 27, 1964, Steve Lawrence opened at the 54th Street Theatre in a Broadway musical version of &quot;What Makes Sammy Run?&quot; which ran for 540 performances, closing on June 12, 1965. Robert Alda played Al Manheim and Sally Ann Howes played Kit Sargent. The music and lyrics were by Ervin Drake and Budd Schulberg and his brother, Stuart Schulberg, wrote the book. Abe Burrows directed.&lt;ref name=&quot;CT/44701&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*A heavily revised revival of the musical opened on January 19, 2006, at the West End Theatre in New York City. Ervin Drake wrote several new songs and reinserted several songs that were not used in the 1964 production.
*The book has yet to be made into a theatrical film. In 1956, Fred Finklehoffe acquired the rights but these expired before he could make a film. In 1989, Budd Schulberg completed a screenplay of his 1941 novel, for director Sidney Lumet. According to a 2001 article in &quot;Variety&quot;, DreamWorks paid US$2.6 million to acquire the rights to the novel from Warner Brothers for a proposed movie version starring and/or directed by Ben Stiller, although production was never begun. Budd Schulberg, who died in 2009, told &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot; in 2006 that he doubted that a film would ever be made, saying &quot;I still think there&#x27;s a sense that it&#x27;s too anti-industry&quot;. In a 2009 newspaper interview, Schulberg quoted Steven Spielberg as saying that the book was &quot;anti-Hollywood and should never be filmed&quot;.

<text>Anne of Austria (; ; born Ana María Mauricia; 22 September 1601 – 20 January 1666) was Queen of France from 1615 to 1643 by marriage to King Louis XIII. She was also Queen of Navarre until the kingdom&#x27;s annexation into the French crown in 1620. After her husband&#x27;s death, Anne was regent to her son Louis XIV during his minority until 1651.

Anne was born in Valladolid to King Philip III of Spain and Margaret of Austria. She was betrothed to King Louis XIII of France in 1612 and they married three years later. The two had a difficult marital relationship, exacerbated by her miscarriages and the anti-Habsburg stance of Louis&#x27; first minister, Cardinal Richelieu. Despite a climate of distrust amidst the Franco-Spanish War and twenty-three years of childlessness in which she suffered five miscarriages, Anne gave birth to an heir, Louis, in 1638 and a second son, Philippe two years later.

When Louis XIII died in 1643, Anne outmaneuvered her opponents to become sole regent to her four-year-old son, Louis XIV, and appointed Cardinal Mazarin as chief minister. The Fronde, a major revolt by the French nobility against Anne and Mazarin&#x27;s government, broke out but was ultimately suppressed. In 1651, Anne&#x27;s regency formally ended when Louis was declared of age. Accounts of French court life of her era emphasize her closeness to her son, and her disapproval of his infidelity to her niece and daughter-in-law Maria Theresa. She retired from active politics in 1661 and moved to the convent she had commissioned, Val-de-Grâce, where she died of breast cancer five years later.

==Early life==
Born at the in Valladolid, Spain, and baptised Ana María Mauricia, she was the eldest daughter of King Philip III of Spain and his wife Margaret of Austria. She held the titles of Infanta of Spain and of Portugal (since her father was king of Portugal as well as Spain) and Archduchess of Austria. Despite her Spanish birth, she was referred to as Anne of Austria because the rulers of Spain belonged to the senior branch of the House of Austria, known later as the House of Habsburg, a designation relatively uncommon before the 19th century.

Anne was raised mainly at the Royal Alcázar of Madrid. Unusually for a royal princess, Anne grew up close to her parents, who were very religious. She was raised to be religious too, and was often taken to visit monasteries during her childhood. In 1611, she lost her mother, who died in childbirth. Despite her grief, Anne did her best to take care of her younger siblings, who referred to her with affection as their mother.

==Queen of France==

At age eleven, Anne was betrothed to King Louis XIII of France. Her father gave her a dowry of 500,000 crowns and many beautiful jewels. For fear that Louis XIII would die early, the Spanish court stipulated that she would return to Spain with her dowry, jewels, and wardrobe if he did die. Prior to the marriage, Anne renounced all succession rights she had for herself and her descendants by Louis, with a provision that she would resume her rights should she be left a childless widow. On 18 October 1615, Louis and Anne were married by proxy in Burgos while Louis&#x27;s sister, Elisabeth of France, and Anne&#x27;s brother, Philip IV of Spain, were married by proxy in Bordeaux. These marriages followed the tradition of cementing military and political alliances between France and Spain that began with the marriage of Philip II of Spain to Elisabeth of Valois in 1559 as part of the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis. Anne and Elisabeth were exchanged on the Isle of Pheasants between Hendaye and Fuenterrabía. She was lively and beautiful during her youth. She was also a noted equestrian, a taste her son, Louis, would inherit. At the time, Anne had many admirers, including the handsome Duke of Buckingham, although her intimates believed their flirtations remained chaste. Historian Desmond Seward alleges that during his 1625 visit to France, when the French court took official leave of the English embassy at Amiens, &quot;Buckingham climbed into a private garden where the Queen was taking an evening walk&quot;, and &quot;may even have tried to rape her&quot;, although &quot;Anne&#x27;s shrieks summoned her attendants.&quot;
Anne and Louis, both fourteen years old, were pressured to consummate their marriage in order to forestall any possibility of future annulment, but Louis ignored his bride. Louis&#x27;s mother, Marie de&#x27; Medici, continued to conduct herself as queen of France, without showing any deference to her daughter-in-law. Anne, surrounded by her entourage of high-born Spanish ladies-in-waiting headed by Inés de la Torre, continued to live according to Spanish etiquette and failed to improve her French.

In 1617, Louis conspired with his favourite Charles d&#x27;Albert de Luynes to dispense with the influence of his mother in a palace &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and had her favourite Concino Concini assassinated on 26 April of that year. During the years he was in the ascendancy Luynes attempted to remedy the formal distance between Louis and his queen. He sent away Inés de la Torre and the other Spanish ladies and replaced them with French ones, notably the Princess of Conti (Louise Marguerite of Lorraine) and his wife Marie de Rohan, with whom he organized court events that would bring the couple together under amiable circumstances. Anne began to dress in the French manner and, in 1619, Luynes pressed the king to bed his queen. Some affection developed, to the point where it was noted that Louis was distracted during a serious illness of the queen.

A series of miscarriages disenchanted the king and served to chill their relations. On 14 March 1622, while playing with her ladies, Anne fell and suffered her second stillbirth. Louis blamed her for the incident and was angry with Marie de Rohan, now the Dowager Duchess of Luynes, for having encouraged the queen in what was seen as negligence. The king&#x27;s already strained relationship with the duchess worsened after the incident, leading him to demand her departure from the court. However, Rohan returned just a few months later with her new husband Claude, Duke of Chevreuse.

Louis turned now to Cardinal Richelieu as his advisor, who served as his first minister from 1624 until his death in 1642. Richelieu&#x27;s foreign policy of struggle against the Habsburgs, who surrounded France on two fronts, inevitably created tension between Louis and Anne, who remained childless for another sixteen years.

Under the influence of Marie de Rohan, the queen let herself be drawn into political opposition to Richelieu and became embroiled in several intrigues against his policies. Vague rumours of betrayal circulated in the court, notably her supposed involvement, first, with the Chalais conspiracy that Marie organized in 1626, and then those of the king&#x27;s treacherous favorite, Cinq-Mars, who had been introduced to him by Richelieu.

In 1626, the Cardinal placed Madeleine du Fargis as &quot;Dame d&#x27;atour&quot; in the household of the queen to act as a spy, but she was instead to become a trusted confidant and favourite of the queen. In December 1630, Louis XIII reduced Anne&#x27;s court and purged a great amount of her favourites as punishment for a plot in which the queen had cooperated with queen dowager Marie de&#x27; Medici in an attempt to depose Cardinal Richelieu, and among those fired were Madame de Motteville and Madeleine du Fargis. Queen Anne asked the Cardinal to intervene so that she might keep du Fargis. When he refused, she swore that she would never forgive him. Du Fargis left for Brussels, where her spouse had sided with the king&#x27;s brother Gaston, Duke of Orléans against the monarch. After the invasion of Gaston in 1632, letters were discovered from du Fargis to people in Paris describing the plans of a marriage between Gaston and Anne after the death of Louis XIII. Anne was questioned and confirmed that the letters were written by du Fargis, but denied any knowledge of the plans.

In 1635, France declared war on Spain, placing the queen in an untenable position. Her secret correspondence with her brother Philip IV of Spain was not the only communication she had with the Spanish. She also corresponded with the Spanish ambassador Mirabel and the governor of the Spanish Netherlands. With the assistance of Anne&#x27;s servant La Porte, who acted as courier, Madeleine du Fargis and Marie de Rohan acted as agents for her secret correspondence and channelled her letters to other contacts. In July 1637, Anne gave du Fargis the mission to examine whether there was any truth to the rumour of an alliance between France and England, as this would force Spain to cut off diplomatic connections to France and disturb her network of couriers between the Spanish embassies of Paris and Brussels.

On 11 August 1637, Anne came under so much suspicion that Richelieu issued an investigation. Her courier La Porte as well as the abbess of Anne&#x27;s favourite convent Val-de-Grâce (where Anne had written many of her secret letters) were questioned and admitted to having participated in channelling the queen&#x27;s secret correspondence. Anne initially swore on the Holy Sacrament that she had participated in no illegal correspondence, but finally admitted her guilt on 15 August. On 17 August, Queen Anne was forced to sign covenants regarding her correspondence, which was henceforth open to inspection; she was further banned from visiting convents without permission and was never to be left alone but was always to be in the presence of one of her ladies-in-waiting. This was soon followed up by a purge of her household, where those officials loyal to the queen were replaced by those loyal to the king and the Cardinal. Consequently, count Jean de Galard de Bearn de Brassac, known to be loyal to Richelieu, was appointed chamberlain of her household, and his spouse Catherine de Brassac replaced Marie-Catherine de Senecey as her &quot;Première dame d&#x27;honneur&quot; to keep the queen and her household under control.
===Birth of an heir===

Despite a climate of distrust, the queen became pregnant once more, a circumstance attributed to a single stormy night in December 1637 or, as historians deem more likely, to a royal tour that occurred sometime during the previous month. Louis XIV was born on 5 September 1638, an event that secured the Bourbon line. At this time, Anne was 37. The official newspaper &quot;Gazette de France&quot; called the birth &quot;a marvel when it was least expected&quot;.

The birth of a living son failed to re-establish confidence between the royal couple. However, she conceived again fifteen months later. At Saint-Germain-en-Laye on 21 September 1640, Anne gave birth to her second son, Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, who later founded the modern House of Orléans. Both of her children were placed under the supervision of the royal governess Françoise de Lansac, who was disliked by Anne and loyal to the king and the cardinal. 

Richelieu made Louis XIII a gift of his palatial hôtel, the &quot;Palais Cardinal&quot;, north of the Louvre, in 1636, but the king never took possession of it. Anne left the Louvre Palace to install herself there with her two small sons and remained as regent, hence the name Palais-Royal that the structure still carries.

===Issue===
The couple had the following children:
==Regent of France==

Upon Louis&#x27; death in 1643, Anne was named regent, despite his attempts to prevent her from obtaining the position. With the aid of Pierre Séguier, she had the Parlement of Paris revoke the will of the late king, which would have limited her powers. Their four-year-old son was crowned King Louis XIV of France. Anne assumed the regency but to general surprise entrusted the government to the chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin, who was a protégé of Cardinal Richelieu and figured among the council of the regency. Mazarin took up residence at the Palais Royal near Queen Anne. Before long he was believed to be her lover, and, it was hinted, even her husband.

With Mazarin&#x27;s support, Anne overcame the aristocratic revolt, led by Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé, that became known as the Fronde. In 1651, when her son Louis XIV officially came of age, her regency legally ended. However, she kept much power and influence over her son until the death of Mazarin.

In January 1648, while acting as regent, Anne received a request on behalf of artists who were affiliated with the crown or aristocracy. The artists, led by painter Charles Le Brun, wanted independence from the monopoly control of the guild, which fined the artists or seized their work. The painters and sculptors petitioned Louis XIV and the Queen Regent to form a new organization. They wanted to found an academy that would be for the visual arts what Académie Française was for French literature; this was to become the Académie Royale.

==Later life==
Anne&#x27;s regency formally ended in 1651, when Louis XIV was declared of legal majority at the age of thirteen.

In 1659, the war with Spain ended with the Treaty of the Pyrenees. The following year, peace was cemented by the marriage of the young king to Anne&#x27;s niece, the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Theresa of Spain.

In 1661, the same year as the death of Mazarin, an heir to the throne was born, Anne&#x27;s first grandchild Louis. Many other children would follow, but all in the legitimate line would die except for Louis. Sometime after, Anne retired to the convent of Val-de-Grâce, where she died of breast cancer five years later.

==Conventual patronage and the Val-de-Grâce==
As part of her role as a member of French royalty, Anne visited churches and convents across France, where she met Marguerite de Veny d&#x27;Arbouze at the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce de la-Ville-d&#x27;Evêque. As well as securing from the King the position of Abbess at the Benedictine Val-de-Grâce de Notre-Dame-de-la-Crèche for Marguerite in 1618, Anne purchased lands and transferred the convent to Paris in 1621. She was named the new foundress of the convent in the same year. Her patronage included the building of a small church and an apartment for herself between 1620 and 1625, against the wishes of both Louis and Cardinal Richelieu.

The Val-de-Grâce was commissioned by Anne in 1645, which was undertaken initially by Francois Mansart, who was dismissed in 1646 and succeeded by Jacques Lemercier. This church became Anne&#x27;s main place of worship and would later gain dynastic significance during the Fronde when she was queen regent. In 1662, she acquired the heart of her ancestor, Anne Elizabeth of France, and placed it in the 
Chapel of Saint Anne. In 1666, Anne&#x27;s own body was interred next to Louis XIII&#x27;s at the Basilica of St Denis in Paris, but her heart in the Chapel of Saint Sacrament, alongside the body of Marguerite d&#x27;Arbouze.

== In fiction ==
She is one of the central figures in Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s 1844 novel &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and its sequels &quot;Twenty Years After&quot; (1845) and &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot; (1847–1850), and has thus been portrayed in numerous film adaptations.

Her lady-in-waiting Madame de Motteville wrote the story of the queen&#x27;s life in her &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;Anne d&#x27;Autriche&quot;. 

She was portrayed by Geraldine Chaplin in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot;.

She appears in a French film based on the life of Louis XIV, Le Roi danse, portrayed by Collette Emmanuelle, and King Louis portrayed by Benoît Magimel (2000). 

She was portrayed by Alexandra Dowling in the BBC series &quot;The Musketeers&quot; (2014–2016).

She first appears as a character in the &quot;Dinosaur King&quot; season two episode &quot;The French Conniption&quot; as a young teen along with a young King Louis and others.

She appeared in &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;″s second-season premiere episode &quot;Out of Time&quot;, played by Rebecca Roberts.

She appeared in final episode of the third season of series &quot;As If&quot;, played by Yeşim Ceylan.

She was portrayed by Vicky Krieps in the 2023 French film &quot;The Three Musketeers: D&#x27;Artagnan&quot; and &quot;The Three Musketeers: Milady&quot;.

Anne of Austria has a cameo in television series &quot;Versailles&quot; (season 1, episode 1).
