<text>Fort Detrick () is a United States Army Futures Command installation located in Frederick, Maryland. Fort Detrick was the center of the U.S. biological weapons program from 1943 to 1969. Since the discontinuation of that program, it has hosted most elements of the United States biological defense program.

As of the early 2010s, Fort Detrick&#x27;s campus supports a multi-governmental community that conducts biomedical research and development, medical materiel management, global medical communications and the study of foreign plant pathogens. The lab is known to research pathogens such as Ebola and smallpox.

Fort Detrick US Army facility is home to the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC), with its bio-defense agency, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). It also hosts the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Frederick Campus, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research and is home to the National Interagency Confederation for Biological Research (NICBR), National Interagency Biodefense Campus (NIBC), National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center and the National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI).

In August 2019, its deadly germ research operations were shut down following serious safety violations, in particular relating to the disposal of dangerous materials.

Fort Detrick is the largest employer in Frederick County, Maryland.

==History==
Five farms originally constituted what is today known as &quot;Area A&quot; with , or the main post area of Fort Detrick, where most installation activities are located. &quot;Area B&quot; – known as &quot;The Farm&quot; and consisting of nearly – was purchased in 1946 to provide a test area west of Rosemont Avenue, then called Yellow Springs Pike. In addition, the post&#x27;s water and waste water treatment plants comprise about on the banks of the Monocacy River.

===Detrick Field (1931–43)===
Fort Detrick traces its roots to a small municipal airport established at Frederick, Maryland, in 1929. It was operated by a single person and the field was one of a string of emergency airfields between Cleveland, Ohio, and Washington, D.C., until 1938. The field was named in honor of squadron flight surgeon Major Frederick L. Detrick who served in France during World War I and died in June 1931 of a heart attack. The first military presence there was the encampment, on 10 August 1931 (two months after the Major&#x27;s death), of his unit: the 104th Observation Squadron of the 29th Division, Maryland National Guard. The Squadron flew de Havilland observation biplanes and Curtiss JN-4 &quot;Jennies&quot;.

A concrete and tarmac airfield replaced the grass field in 1939, and an upgraded Detrick Field served as a Cadet Pilot Training Center until the country&#x27;s entry into World War II. Detrick Field was formally leased from the City of Frederick in 1940 (having previously been leased from the state for just two weeks per year). The last airplanes departed Detrick Field in December 1941 and January 1942 after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. All aircraft and pilots in the 104th and the cadet program were reassigned after the Declaration of War to conduct antisubmarine patrols off the Atlantic Coast. The 2nd Bombardment Squadron, U.S. Army Air Corps was reconstituted at Detrick Field between March and September 1942, when it deployed to England to become the nucleus of the new Eighth Air Force headquarters. Thereafter, the base ceased to be an aviation center. The airfields buildings, runway and tarmac have all disappeared which ran along today&#x27;s Hamilton Street from Beasley Drive to about Neiman Street.

===Camp Detrick (1943–56)===
On 9 March 1943, the government purchased encompassing the original and re-christened the facility &quot;Camp Detrick&quot;. The same year saw the establishment of the U.S. Army Biological Warfare Laboratories (USBWL), responsible for pioneering research into biocontainment, decontamination, gaseous sterilization, and agent purification. The first commander, Lt. Col. William S. Bacon, and his successor, Col. Martin B. Chittick, oversaw the initial $1.25 million renovation and construction of the base.

====World War II and BW research (1943–45)====

During World War II, Camp Detrick and the USBWL became the site of intensive biological warfare (BW) research using various pathogens. This research was originally overseen by pharmaceuticals executive George W. Merck and for many years was conducted by Ira L. Baldwin, professor of bacteriology at the University of Wisconsin. Baldwin became the first scientific director of the labs. He chose Detrick Field for the site of this exhaustive research effort because of its balance between remoteness of location and proximity to Washington, D.C. – as well as to Edgewood Arsenal, the focal point of U.S. chemical warfare research. Buildings and other facilities left from the old airfield – including the large hangar – provided the nucleus of support needed for the startup. The of Detrick Field were also surrounded by extensive farmlands that could be procured if and when the BW effort was expanded.

The Army&#x27;s Chemical Warfare Service was given responsibility and oversight for the effort that one officer described as &quot;cloaked in the deepest wartime secrecy, matched only by … the Manhattan Project for developing the Atomic Bomb&quot;. Three months after the start of construction, an additional $3 million was provided for five additional laboratories and a pilot plant. Lt. Col. Bacon was authorized 85 officers, 373 enlisted personnel, and 80 enlisted Women&#x27;s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) members under two WAAC officers. At its peak strength in 1945, Camp Detrick had 240 officers and 1,530 enlisted personnel including WACs.

After the defeat of Japan, the researchers working at Unit 731 were given immunity from prosecution. In return, director Shirō Ishii provided &quot;8,000 slides of tissue from human and animal dissections&quot; from the experiments, which were reportedly stored at Fort Detrick.

====Post-war years (1946–55)====
The elaborate security precautions taken at Camp Detrick were so effective that it was not until January 1946, four months after VJ Day that the public learned of the war-time research in biological weapons.

In 1952, the Army purchased over more of land located between West 7th Street and Oppossumtown Pike to expand the permanent research and development facilities.

Two workers at the base died from exposure to anthrax in the 1950s. Another died in 1964 from viral encephalitis.

There was a building on the base, Building 470, locally referred to as &quot;Anthrax Tower&quot;. Building 470 was a pilot plant for testing optimal fermentor and bacterial purification technologies. The information gained in this pilot plant shaped the fermentor technology that was ultimately used by the pharmaceutical industry to revolutionize the production of antibiotics and other drugs. Building 470 was torn down in 2003 without any adverse effects on the demolition workers or the environment. The facility acquired the nickname &quot;Fort Doom&quot; while offensive biological warfare research was undertaken there. 5,000 bombs containing anthrax spores were produced at the base during World War II.

From 1945 to 1955 under Project Paperclip and its successors, the U.S. government recruited over 1,600 German and Austrian scientists and engineers in a variety of fields such as aircraft design, missile technology and biological warfare. Among the specialists in the latter field who ended up working in the U.S. were Walter Schreiber, Erich Traub and Kurt Blome, who had been involved with medical experiments on concentration camp inmates to test biological warfare agents. Since Britain, France and the Soviet Union were also engaged in recruiting these scientists, the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) wished to deny their services to other powers, and therefore altered or concealed the records of their Nazi past and involvement in war crimes.

====Testing performed on Seventh-day Adventists (1940–1974)====
The U.S. General Accounting Office issued a report on September 28, 1994, which stated that between 1940 and 1974, DOD and other national security agencies studied hundreds of thousands of human subjects in tests and experiments involving hazardous substances.

The quote from the study:

Many experiments that tested various biological agents on human subjects, referred to as Operation Whitecoat, were carried out at Fort Detrick, Maryland, in the 1950s. The human subjects originally consisted of volunteer enlisted men. However, after the enlisted men staged a sitdown strike to obtain more information about the dangers of the biological tests, Seventh-day Adventists (SDAs) who were conscientious objectors were recruited for the studies.

The Army purchased an additional in 1946 to increase the size of the original &quot;Area A&quot; as well as located west of Area A, but not contiguous to it, to provide a test area known as Area B. In 1952, another were purchased between West 7th Street and Oppossumtown Pike to expand the permanent research and development facilities.

Jeffrey Alan Lockwood wrote in 2009 that the biological warfare program at Ft. Detrick began to research the use of insects as disease vectors going back to World War II and also employed German and Japanese scientists after the war who had experimented on human subjects among POWs and concentration camp inmates. Scientists used or attempted to use a wide variety of insects in their biowar plans, including fleas, ticks, ants, lice and mosquitoes – especially mosquitoes that carried the yellow fever virus. They also tested these in the United States. Lockwood thinks that it is very likely that the U.S. did use insects dropped from aircraft during the Korean War to spread diseases, and that the Chinese and North Koreans were not simply engaged in a propaganda campaign when they made these allegations, since the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of Defense had approved their use in the fall of 1950 at the &quot;earliest practicable time&quot;. At that time, it had five biowarfare agents ready for use, three of which were spread by insect vectors.

===Fort Detrick (1956–present)===

====Cold War years (1956–89)====
Camp Detrick was designated a permanent installation for peacetime biological research and development shortly after World War II, but that status was not confirmed until 1956, when the post became Fort Detrick. Its mandate was to continue its previous mission of biomedical research and its role as the world&#x27;s leading research campus for biological agents requiring specialty containment. 
The most recent land acquisition for the fort was a parcel of less than along the Rosemont Avenue fence in 1962, completing the present .

On Veterans Day, November 11, 1969, President Richard M. Nixon asked the Senate to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of chemical and biological weapons. Nixon assured Fort Detrick its research would continue. On November 25, 1969, Nixon made a statement outlawing offensive biological research in the United States. Since that time any research done at Fort Detrick has allegedly been purely defensive in nature, focusing on diagnostics, preventives and treatments for BW infections. This research is undertaken by the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) which transitioned from the previous U.S. Army Medical Unit (USAMU) and was renamed in 1969.

As he ended the offensive biological research done at Fort Detrick, Nixon pledged to make former laboratories and land available by the disestablishment of the offensive biological warfare program transferred to the U.S Department of Health and Human Services during the 1970s and later. The Frederick National Cancer Research and Development Center (now the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research) was established in 1971 on a parcel in Area A ceded by the installation.

In 1989 base researchers identified the Ebola virus in a monkey imported to the area from the Philippines.

====Post-Cold War (1990–present)====
In 1990, Hazelton Research Products&#x27; Reston Quarantine Unit in Reston, Virginia suffered a mysterious outbreak of fatal illness among a shipment of crab-eating macaque monkeys imported from the Philippines. The company&#x27;s veterinary pathologist sent tissue samples from dead animals to the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick, where a laboratory test known as an ELISA assay showed antibodies to Ebola virus.
Thereafter, a team from USAMRIID euthanized the surviving monkeys, bringing the carcasses to Ft. Detrick for study by the veterinary pathologists and virologists, and eventual disposal under safe conditions. The Philippines and the United States had no previous cases of Ebola infection, and upon further study researchers concluded it was another strain of Ebola, or a new filovirus of Asian origin, which they named &quot;Reston ebolavirus&quot; (REBOV) after the location of the incident.
In 2009, author H. P. Albarelli published the book &quot;A Terrible Mistake: The Murder of Frank Olson and the CIA&#x27;s Secret Cold War Experiments&quot; about Frank Olson&#x27;s death and the experiments conducted at Fort Detrick. The book is based on documents released under FOIA and numerous other documents and interviews to the police and investigators.

In the 1980s and 1990s, KGB disinformation agent Jakob Segal claimed that Fort Detrick was the site where the United States government &quot;invented&quot; HIV.

USAMRIID had been the principal consultant to the FBI on scientific aspects of the 2001 Anthrax Attacks, which had infected 22 people and killed five. While assisting with the science from the beginning, it also soon became the focus of the FBI&#x27;s investigation of possible perpetrators (see Steven Hatfill). In July 2008, a top U.S. biodefense researcher at USAMRIID committed suicide just as the FBI was about to lay charges relating to the incidents. The scientist, Bruce Edwards Ivins, who had worked for 18 years at USAMRIID, had been told about the impending prosecution. The FBI&#x27;s identification of Ivins in August 2008 as the Anthrax Attack perpetrator remains controversial and several independent government investigations which will address his culpability are ongoing. Although the anthrax preparations used in the attacks were of different grades, all of the material derived from the same bacterial strain. Known as the Ames strain, it was first researched at USAMRIID. The Ames strain was subsequently distributed to at least fifteen bio-research labs within the U.S. and six locations overseas.

In June 2008 the Environmental Protection Agency said it planned to add the base to the Superfund list of the most polluted places in the country. On 9 April 2009, &quot;Fort Detrick Area B Ground Water&quot; was added to the list which currently includes 18 other sites within Maryland.

The Forest Glen Annex of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Silver Spring, Maryland was transferred to the command of Fort Detrick in 2008 as a result of the Base Realignment and Closure process.

 about 7,900 people worked at Fort Detrick. The base has been the largest employer in Frederick County and contributed more than $500 million into the local economy annually.

In 2020, a conspiracy theory regarding COVID-19 arose that alleged that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was developed by the United States Army at Fort Detrick. This allegation has been promoted by Chinese government officials, most notably Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Zhao Lijian, who has called for an inspection of the facility, although the allegation remains baseless. A petition organized by the Chinese Communist Party-owned tabloid &quot;Global Times&quot; urging the WHO to investigate Fort Detrick for COVID origins reportedly amassed 25 million signatures.

==Environmental contamination==
Fort Detrick Area B is a 399-acre proving ground and was a disposal area for chemical, biological, and radiological material until 1970. In 2009, it was listed as a superfund site on the National Priorities List with four so-called &quot;source areas&quot;: chemical waste disposal pits, a landfill, the Area B-Grid and the Area B-20 South burn area. There are 30 additional possible areas. Groundwater has been known to be contaminated with volatile organic compounds trichloroethylene (TCE) since 1992, as well as tetrachloroethene, both onsite and offsite. Eight 55-gallon drums of TCE buried in Area B in 1968 are believed to be one source of the contamination. Groundwater plume modeling is difficult due to underlying karst formations. No &quot;Records of Decision&quot; about how each site will be remediated have been signed by EPA and Army.

In 2012, the United States National Research Council published a report after reviewing two investigations of potential health hazards at Fort Detrick: a 2009 public health assessment conducted by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and a cancer investigation in Frederick County by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Frederick County Health Department. The report found neither study could show whether people were harmed by contaminated groundwater from Area B. It is unlikely that additional studies could establish a link, because no data on early exposures were collected and data cannot be obtained or reliably estimated now.

In May 2014, a developer who had bought 92 acres near the Center for Biological Research sued the U.S. Army for negligence in its chemical disposal practices, which led to levels of TCE of up to 42 times the federal maximum contaminant level. A U.S. attorney representing Fort Detrick argued in July 2014 that nonexistent EPA regulation at the time is an exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act and &quot;protects the Army&#x27;s waste disposal practices&quot;. The $37 million lawsuit was dismissed in January 2015.

After the Army denied claims of health problems in 106 Frederick families and individuals in February 2015, the residents filed a class action lawsuit, seeking $750 million for wrongful death and pain and suffering in August 2015.

The installation&#x27;s Restoration Advisory Board has released a report on some of the findings in relation to the spillage of waste. The public Fort Detrick website provided a copy of the archive from the meeting of an environmental committee.

==2019 closure and resumption of operations==
During an inspection by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories at Ft Detrick in June 2019, six violations including two breaches of containment were identified. The inspection was followed up by a letter of concern from the CDC on July 12, 2019 and then a cease and desist order on July 15, 2019.

Following the cease and desist order from the CDC the USAMRIID laboratories at the base were shut down in August 2019. The announcement to resume operations on a &quot;limited scale&quot; was made on November 25, 2019. 

The CDC cited &quot;“national security reasons”&quot; as the reason for not informing the public about its decision. The two breaches reported to the CDC by USAMRIID staff demonstrated failures of biosafety level 3 and 4 protocols in the Army laboratory to &quot;implement and maintain containment procedures sufficient to contain select agents or toxins&quot;.

After approximately eight months of closure and restrictions, the USAMRIID BSL-4 lab had been authorized to resume full operational status by April 2020, to the applause of Maryland lawmakers including Senator Ben Cardin, who stated &quot;it is a relief to have USAMRIID fully operational with the current COVID-19 outbreak&quot;&#x27;.

==Tenant units and organizations==
Each branch of the U.S. military is represented among Fort Detrick&#x27;s 7,800 military, federal and contractor employees. Four cabinet-level agencies are represented by activities on the garrison: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Department of Defense. The offices and laboratories include the Agriculture Department&#x27;s Foreign Disease and Weed Science Research Institute, the National Cancer Institute, the Naval Medical Logistics Command and the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center. Currently under construction is a biotechnology campus that will house civilian and military research centers including units of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), as well as USAMRIID.

==On post historic sites==
Fort Detrick has three sites (and four structures) on the National Register of Historic Places:
* The Nallin Farm House (&quot;circa&quot; 1835)
* The Nallin Farm Springhouse and Bank Barn (pre-1798)
* The One Million Liter Sphere, the &quot;Eight Ball&quot; (1947–48)

In addition, the following sites on the installation are of historic interest:

* A rocky knoll overlooking Frederick, and located near the Old Farm Gate (northwest gate) of Fort Detrick, was the site of historic structures. The Novitiate Academy of Frederick built an impressive estate, Saint Joseph&#x27;s Villa, on the hill in 1895. This was located there because of Restoration Spring just to the north at the base of the hill. The Academy moved to New York in 1903 and the Villa was subsequently demolished. Dr. Rudolph Rau, a Frederick surgeon, bought the land in 1911 and constructed an imposing white mansion with colossal columns, a third-floor ballroom and carriage house. This estate, &quot;Wide Pastures&quot;, also included an extensive Italianate woodland and terraced garden. This property was sold in 1929 to Robert Bright who used it as a summerhouse until 1943. Three years later, the U.S. government bought it and it was used as the Fort Detrick post commander&#x27;s residence until it too was demolished in 1977. Today, only retaining walls and some flagstone paths remain, but photos of both the Novitiate Academy building and Dr. Rau&#x27;s mansion can be seen as part of interpretive signage at the site.

<doc id="80880" wikidata="Q272706" url="?curid=80880" title="Georgette Heyer">
<text>Georgette Heyer (; 16 August 1902 – 4 July 1974) was an English novelist and short-story writer, in both the Regency romance and detective fiction genres. Her writing career began in 1921, when she turned a story conceived for her ailing younger brother into the novel &quot;The Black Moth&quot;. In 1925 Heyer married George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer. The couple spent several years living in Tanganyika Territory and Macedonia before returning to England in 1929. After her novel &quot;These Old Shades&quot; became popular despite its release during the General Strike, Heyer determined that publicity was not necessary for good sales. For the rest of her life she refused to grant interviews, telling a friend: &quot;My private life concerns no one but myself and my family.&quot;

Heyer essentially established the historical romance genre and its subgenre Regency romance. Her Regencies were inspired by Jane Austen. To ensure accuracy, Heyer collected reference works and kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life. Whilst some critics thought the novels were too detailed, others considered the level of detail to be Heyer&#x27;s greatest asset. Her meticulous nature was also evident in her historical novels; Heyer even recreated William the Conqueror&#x27;s crossing into England for her novel &quot;The Conqueror&quot;.

Beginning in 1932 Heyer released one romance novel and one thriller each year. (See List of works by Georgette Heyer.) Her husband often provided basic outlines for the plots of her thrillers, leaving Heyer to develop character relationships and dialogue so as to bring the story to life. Although many critics describe Heyer&#x27;s detective novels as unoriginal, others such as Nancy Wingate praise them &quot;for their wit and comedy as well as for their well-woven plots&quot;.

Her success was sometimes clouded by problems with tax inspectors and alleged plagiarists. Heyer chose not to file lawsuits against the suspected literary thieves but tried multiple ways of minimizing her tax liability. Forced to put aside the works she called her &quot;magnum opus&quot; (a trilogy covering the House of Lancaster) to write more commercially successful works, Heyer eventually created a limited liability company to administer the rights to her novels. She was accused several times of providing an overly large salary for herself, and in 1966 she sold the company and the rights to seventeen of her novels to Booker-McConnell. Heyer continued writing until her death in July 1974. At that time 48 of her novels were still in print; her last book, &quot;My Lord John&quot;, was published posthumously.

==Early years==
Georgette Heyer was born in Wimbledon, London, in 1902. She was named after her father, George Heyer. Her mother, Sylvia Watkins, studied both cello and piano and was one of the top three students in her class at the Royal College of Music. Heyer&#x27;s paternal grandfather had emigrated from Russia, whilst her maternal grandparents owned tugboats on the River Thames.

Heyer was the eldest of three children; her brothers, George Boris (known as Boris) and Frank, were four and nine years younger than she. For part of her childhood the family lived in Paris but they returned to England shortly after World War I broke out in 1914. Although the family&#x27;s surname had been pronounced &quot;higher&quot;, the advent of war led her father to switch to the pronunciation &quot;hair&quot; so they would not be mistaken for Germans. During the war her father served as a requisitions officer for the British Army in France. After the war he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). He left the army in 1920 with the rank of captain, taught at King&#x27;s College London and sometimes wrote for &quot;The Granta&quot;.

George Heyer strongly encouraged his children to read and never forbade any book. Georgette read widely and often met her friends Joanna Cannan and Carola Oman to discuss books. Heyer and Oman later shared their works-in-progress with each other and offered criticism.

When she was 17 Heyer began a serial story to amuse her brother Boris, who suffered from a form of haemophilia and was often weak. Her father enjoyed listening to her story and asked her to prepare it for publication. His agent found a publisher for her book, and &quot;The Black Moth&quot;, about the adventures of a young man who took responsibility for his brother&#x27;s card-cheating, was issued in 1921. According to her biographer, Jane Aiken Hodge, the novel contained many of the elements that would become standard for Heyer&#x27;s novels, the &quot;saturnine male lead, the marriage in danger, the extravagant wife, and the group of idle, entertaining young men&quot;. The following year one of her contemporary short stories, &quot;A Proposal to Cicely&quot;, was published in &quot;Happy Magazine&quot;.

==Marriage==
While holidaying with her family in December 1920 Heyer met George Ronald Rougier, who was two years her senior. The two became regular dance partners while Rougier was studying at the Royal School of Mines to become a mining engineer. In the spring of 1925, shortly after the publication of her fifth novel, they became engaged. One month later Heyer&#x27;s father died of a heart attack. He left no pension and Heyer assumed financial responsibility for her brothers, aged 19 and 14. Two months after her father&#x27;s death, on 18 August, Heyer and Rougier married in a simple ceremony.

In October 1925 Rougier was sent to work in the Caucasus Mountains, partly because he had learned Russian as a child. Heyer remained at home and continued to write. In 1926 she released &quot;These Old Shades&quot;, in which the Duke of Avon courts his own ward. Unlike her first novel, &quot;These Old Shades&quot; focused more on personal relationships than on adventure. The book appeared in the midst of the 1926 United Kingdom general strike; as a result the novel received no newspaper coverage, reviews or advertising. Nevertheless, the book sold 190,000 copies. Because the lack of publicity had not harmed the novel&#x27;s sales, Heyer refused for the rest of her life to promote her books, even though her publishers often asked her to give interviews. She once wrote to a friend that &quot;as for being photographed at Work or in my Old World Garden, that is the type of publicity which I find nauseating and quite unnecessary. My private life concerns no one but myself and my family.&quot;

Rougier returned home in the summer of 1926, but within months he was sent to the East African territory of Tanganyika. Heyer joined him there the following year. They lived in a hut made of elephant grass in the bush; Heyer was the first white woman her servants had ever seen. While in Tanganyika Heyer wrote &quot;The Masqueraders&quot;; set in 1745, the book follows the romantic adventures of siblings who pretend to be of the opposite sex in order to protect their family, all former Jacobites. Although Heyer did not have access to all of her reference material, the book contained only one anachronism: she placed the opening of White&#x27;s a year too early. She also wrote an account of her adventures, entitled &quot;The Horned Beast of Africa&quot;, which was published in 1929 in the newspaper &quot;The Sphere&quot;.

In 1928 Heyer followed her husband to Macedonia, where she almost died after a dentist improperly administered an anaesthetic. She insisted they return to England before starting a family. The following year Rougier left his job, making Heyer the primary breadwinner. After a failed experiment running a gas, coke and lighting company Rougier purchased a sports shop in Horsham with money they borrowed from Heyer&#x27;s aunts. Heyer&#x27;s brother Boris lived above the shop and helped Rougier, while Heyer continued to provide the bulk of the family&#x27;s earnings with her writing.

==Regency romances==
Heyer&#x27;s earliest works were romance novels, most set before 1800. In 1935 she released &quot;Regency Buck&quot;, her first novel set in the Regency period. This bestselling novel essentially established the genre of Regency romance. Unlike romantic fiction of the period by other writers, Heyer&#x27;s novels featured the setting as a plot device. Many of her characters exhibited modern-day sensibilities; more conventional characters in the novels would point out the heroine&#x27;s eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love. The books were set almost entirely in the world of the wealthy upper class and only occasionally mention poverty, religion or politics.
Although the British Regency lasted only from 1811 to 1820, Heyer&#x27;s romances were set between 1752 and 1825. According to the literary critic Kay Mussell, the books revolved around a &quot;structured social ritual – the marriage market represented by the London season&quot; where &quot;all are in danger of ostracism for inappropriate behavior&quot;. Her Regency romances were inspired by the writings of Jane Austen, whose novels were set in the same era. Austen&#x27;s works, however, were contemporary novels, describing the times in which she lived. According to Pamela Regis in her work &quot;A Natural History of the Romance Novel&quot;, because Heyer&#x27;s stories took place amidst events that had occurred more than 100 years earlier, she had to include more detail on the period in order for her readers to understand it. Whilst Austen could ignore the &quot;minutiae of dress and decor&quot;, Heyer included those details &quot;to invest the novels ... with &#x27;the tone of the time&#x27;&quot;. Later reviewers, such as Lillian Robinson, criticized Heyer&#x27;s &quot;passion for the specific fact without concern for its significance&quot;, and Marghanita Laski wrote that &quot;these aspects on which Heyer is so dependent for her creation of atmosphere are just those which Jane Austen ... referred to only when she wanted to show that a character was vulgar or ridiculous&quot;. Others, including A.S. Byatt, believe that Heyer&#x27;s &quot;awareness of this atmosphere – both of the minute details of the social pursuits of her leisured classes and of the emotional structure behind the fiction it produced – is her greatest asset&quot;. When a critic said her picture of Regency England was no more like the real thing than he was like Queen Anne, Heyer remarked: &quot;He knows best whether he is like Queen Anne, but what the hell does he know about the Regency?&quot;

Determined to make her novels as accurate as possible, Heyer collected reference works and research materials to use while writing. At the time of her death she owned more than 1,000 historical reference books, including &quot;Debrett&#x27;s&quot; and an 1808 dictionary of the House of Lords. In addition to the standard historical works about the medieval and eighteenth-century periods, her library included histories of snuff boxes, sign posts and costumes. She often clipped illustrations from magazine articles and jotted down interesting vocabulary or facts onto note cards but rarely recorded where she found the information. Her notes were sorted into categories, such as Beauty, Colours, Dress, Hats, Household, Prices and Shops, and even included details such as the cost of candles in a particular year. Other notebooks contained lists of phrases, covering such topics as &quot;Food and Crockery&quot;, &quot;Endearments&quot;, and &quot;Forms of Address.&quot; One of her publishers, Max Reinhardt, once attempted to offer editorial suggestions about the language in one of her books but was promptly informed by a member of his staff that no one in England knew more about Regency language than Heyer.

In the interests of accuracy Heyer once purchased a letter written by the Duke of Wellington so that she could precisely employ his style of writing. She claimed that every word attributed to Wellington in &quot;An Infamous Army&quot; was actually spoken or written by him in real life. Her knowledge of the period was so extensive that Heyer rarely mentioned dates explicitly in her books; instead, she situated the story by casually referring to major and minor events of the time.

===Character types===
Heyer specialised in two types of romantic male lead, which she called Mark I and Mark II. Mark I, with overtones of Mr Rochester, was (in her words) &quot;rude, overbearing, and often a bounder&quot;. Mark II by contrast was debonair, sophisticated and often a style-icon. Similarly, her heroines (reflecting Austen&#x27;s division between lively and gentle) fell into two broad groups: the tall and dashing, mannish type, and the quiet bullied type.

When a Mark I hero meets a Mark I heroine, as in &quot;Bath Tangle&quot; or &quot;Faro&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, high drama ensues, whilst an interesting twist on the underlying paradigm is provided by &quot;The Grand Sophy&quot;, where the Mark I hero considers himself a Mark II and has to be challenged for his true nature to emerge.

==Thrillers==

&quot;The Conqueror&quot; (1931) was Heyer&#x27;s first novel of historical fiction to give a fictionalized account of real historical events. She researched the life of William the Conqueror thoroughly, even travelling the route that William took when crossing into England. The following year, Heyer&#x27;s writing took an even more drastic departure from her early historical romances when her first thriller, &quot;Footsteps in the Dark&quot; was published. The novel&#x27;s appearance coincided with the birth of her only child, Richard George Rougier, whom she called her &quot;most notable (indeed peerless) work&quot;. Later in her life, Heyer requested that her publishers refrain from reprinting &quot;Footsteps in the Dark&quot;, saying &quot;This work, published simultaneously with my son ... was the first of my thrillers and was perpetuated while I was, as any Regency character would have said, increasing. One husband and two ribald brothers all had fingers in it, and I do not claim it as a Major Work.&quot;

For the next several years Heyer published one romance novel and one thriller each year. The romances were far more popular: they usually sold 115,000 copies, while her thrillers sold 16,000 copies. According to her son, Heyer &quot;regarded the writing of mystery stories rather as we would regard tackling a crossword puzzle – an intellectual diversion before the harder tasks of life have to be faced&quot;. Heyer&#x27;s husband was involved in much of her writing. He often read the proofs of her historical romances to catch any errors that she might have missed, and served as a collaborator for her thrillers. He provided the plots of the detective stories, describing the actions of characters &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Heyer would then create the characters and the relationships between them and bring the plot points to life. She found it difficult at times to rely on someone else&#x27;s plots; on at least one occasion, before writing the last chapter of a book, she asked Rougier to explain once again how the murder was really committed.

Her detective stories, which, according to critic Earl F. Bargainnier, &quot;specialize[d] in upper-class family murders&quot;, were known primarily for their comedy, melodrama, and romance. The comedy derived not from the action but from the personalities and dialogue of the characters. In most of these novels, all set in the time they were written, the focus relied primarily on the hero, with a lesser role for the heroine. Her early mystery novels often featured athletic heroes; once Heyer&#x27;s husband began pursuing his lifelong dream of becoming a barrister, the novels began to feature solicitors and barristers in lead roles.

In 1935, Heyer&#x27;s thrillers began following a pair of detectives named Superintendent Hannasyde and Sergeant (later Inspector) Hemingway. The two were never as popular as other contemporary fictional detectives such as Agatha Christie&#x27;s Hercule Poirot and Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27;s Lord Peter Wimsey. One of the books featuring Heyer&#x27;s characters, &quot;Death in the Stocks&quot;, was dramatized in New York City in 1937 as &quot;Merely Murder&quot;. The play focused on the comedy rather than the mystery, and although it had a good cast, including Edward Fielding as Hannasyde, it closed after three nights.

According to critic Nancy Wingate, Heyer&#x27;s detective novels, the last written in 1953, often featured unoriginal methods, motives, and characters, with seven of them using inheritance as the motive. The novels were always set in London, a small village, or at a houseparty. Critic Erik Routley labelled many of her characters clichés, including the uneducated policeman, an exotic Spanish dancer, and a country vicar with a neurotic wife. In one of her novels, the characters&#x27; surnames were even in alphabetical order according to the order they were introduced. According to Wingate, Heyer&#x27;s detective stories, like many of the others of the time, exhibited a distinct snobbery towards foreigners and the lower classes. Her middle-class men were often crude and stupid, while the women were either incredibly practical or exhibited poor judgement, usually using poor grammar that could become vicious. Despite the stereotypes, however, Routley maintains that Heyer had &quot;a quite remarkable gift for reproducing the brittle and ironic conversation of the upper middle class Englishwoman of that age (immediately before 1940)&quot;. Wingate further mentions that Heyer&#x27;s thrillers were known &quot;for their wit and comedy as well as for their well-woven plots&quot;.

==Financial problems==
In 1939, Rougier was called to the Bar, and the family moved first to Brighton, then to Hove, so that Rougier could easily commute to London. The following year, they sent their son to a preparatory school, creating an additional expense for Heyer. The Blitz bombing of 1940–41 disrupted train travel in Britain, prompting Heyer and her family to move to London in 1942 so that Rougier would be closer to his work.

After having lunch with a representative from Hodder &amp; Stoughton, who published her detective stories, Heyer felt that her host had patronized her. The company had an option on her next book; partly to make them break her contract, she wrote &quot;Penhallow&quot;, which the 1944 &quot;Book Review Digest&quot; described as &quot;a murder story but not a mystery story&quot;. Hodder &amp; Stoughton turned the book down, thus ending their association with Heyer, and Heinemann agreed to publish it instead. Her publisher in the United States, Doubleday, also disliked the book and ended their relationship with Heyer after its publication.

During World War II, her brothers served in the armed forces, alleviating one of her monetary worries. Her husband, meanwhile, served in the Home Guard, besides continuing as a barrister. As he was new to his career, Rougier did not earn much money, and paper rationing during the war caused lower sales of Heyer&#x27;s books. To meet their expenses Heyer sold the Commonwealth rights for &quot;These Old Shades&quot;, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Cub&quot;, and &quot;Regency Buck&quot; to her publisher, Heinemann, for £750. A contact at the publishing house, her close friend A.S. Frere, later offered to return the rights to her for the same amount of money she was paid. Heyer refused to accept the deal, explaining that she had given her word to transfer the rights. Heyer also reviewed books for Heinemann, earning 2 guineas for each review, and she allowed her novels to be serialized in &quot;Women&#x27;s Journal&quot; prior to their publication as hardcover books. The appearance of a Heyer novel usually caused the magazine to sell out completely, but she complained that they &quot;always like[d] my worst work&quot;.

To minimize her tax liability, Heyer formed a limited liability company called Heron Enterprises around 1950. Royalties from new titles would be paid to the company, which would then furnish Heyer&#x27;s salary and pay directors&#x27; fees to her family. She would continue to receive royalties from her previous titles, and foreign royalties – except for those from the United States – would go to her mother. Within several years, however, a tax inspector found that Heyer was withdrawing too much money from the company. The inspector considered the extra funds as undisclosed dividends, meaning that she owed an additional £3,000 in taxes. To pay the tax bill, Heyer wrote two articles, &quot;Books about the Brontës&quot; and &quot;How to be a Literary Writer&quot;, that were published in the magazine &quot;Punch&quot;. She once wrote to a friend, &quot;I&#x27;m getting so of writing books for the benefit of the Treasury and I can&#x27;t tell you how utterly I resent the squandering of money on such fatuous things as Education and Making Life Easy and Luxurious for So-Called Workers.&quot;

In 1950, Heyer began working on what she called &quot;the magnum opus of my latter years&quot;, a medieval trilogy intended to cover the House of Lancaster between 1393 and 1435. She estimated that she would need five years to complete the works. Her impatient readers continually clamored for new books; to satisfy them and her tax liabilities, Heyer interrupted herself to write Regency romances. The manuscript of volume one of the series, &quot;My Lord John&quot;, was published posthumously.

The limited liability company continued to vex Heyer, and in 1966, after tax inspectors found that she owed the company £20,000, she finally fired her accountants. She then asked that the rights to her newest book, &quot;Black Sheep&quot;, be issued to her personally. Unlike her other novels, &quot;Black Sheep&quot; did not focus on members of the aristocracy. Instead, it followed &quot;the moneyed middle class&quot;, with finance a dominant theme in the novel.

Heyer&#x27;s new accountants urged her to abandon Heron Enterprises; after two years, she finally agreed to sell the company to Booker-McConnell, which already owned the rights to the estates of novelists Ian Fleming and Agatha Christie. Booker-McConnell paid her approximately £85,000 for the rights to the 17 Heyer titles owned by the company. This amount was taxed at the lower capital transfer rate, rather than the higher income tax rate.

==Imitators==
As Heyer&#x27;s popularity increased, other authors began to imitate her style. In May 1950, one of her readers notified her that Barbara Cartland had written several novels in a style similar to Heyer&#x27;s, reusing names, character traits and plot points and paraphrased descriptions from her books, particularly &quot;A Hazard of Hearts&quot;, which borrowed characters from &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot;, and &quot;The Knave of Hearts&quot; which took off &quot;These Old Shades&quot;. Heyer completed a detailed analysis of the alleged plagiarisms for her solicitors, and while the case never came to court and no apology was received, the copying ceased. Her lawyers suggested that she leak the copying to the press. Heyer refused.

In 1961, another reader wrote of similarities found in the works of Kathleen Lindsay, particularly the novel &quot;Winsome Lass&quot;. The novels borrowed plot points, characters, surnames, and plentiful Regency slang. After fans accused Heyer of &quot;publishing shoddy stuff under a pseudonym&quot;, Heyer wrote to the other publisher to complain. When the author took exception to the accusations, Heyer made a thorough list of the borrowings and historical mistakes in the books. Among these were repeated use of the phrase &quot;to make a cake of oneself&quot;, which Heyer had discovered in a privately printed memoir unavailable to the public. In another case, the author referenced a historical incident that Heyer had invented in an earlier novel. Heyer&#x27;s lawyers recommended an injunction, but she ultimately decided not to sue.

==Later years==
In 1959, Rougier became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel. The following year, their son Richard fell in love with the estranged wife of an acquaintance. Richard assisted the woman, Susanna Flint, in leaving her husband, and the couple married after her divorce was finalized. Heyer was shocked at the impropriety but soon came to love her daughter-in-law, later describing her as &quot;the daughter we never had and thought we didn&#x27;t want&quot;. Richard and his wife raised her two sons from her first marriage and provided Heyer with her only biological grandchild in 1966, when their son Nicholas Rougier was born.

As Heyer aged she began to suffer more frequent health problems. These may have been exacerbated by her occasional practice of writing into the wee hours fueled by gin and Benzedrine. In June 1964, she underwent surgery to remove a kidney stone. Although the doctors initially predicted a six-week recovery, after two months they predicted that it might be a year or longer before she felt completely well. The following year, she suffered a mosquito bite that turned septic, prompting the doctors to offer skin grafts. In July 1973 she suffered a slight stroke and spent three weeks in a nursing home. When her brother Boris died later that year, Heyer was too ill to travel to his funeral. She suffered another stroke in February 1974. Three months later, she was diagnosed with lung cancer, which her biographer attributed to the 60–80 cork-tipped cigarettes that Heyer smoked each day (although she said she did not inhale). On 4 July 1974, Heyer died. Her fans learned her married name for the first time from her obituaries.

==Legacy==

Besides her success in the United Kingdom, Heyer&#x27;s novels were very popular in the United States and Germany and achieved respectable sales in Czechoslovakia. A first printing of one of her novels in the Commonwealth often consisted of 65,000–75,000 copies, and her novels collectively sold over 100,000 copies in hardback each year. Her paperbacks usually sold over 500,000 copies each. At the time of her death 48 of her books were still in print, including her first novel, &quot;The Black Moth&quot;.

Her books were very popular during the Great Depression and World War II. Her novels, which journalist Lesley McDowell described as containing &quot;derring-do, dashing blades, and maids in peril&quot;, allowed readers to escape from the mundane and difficult elements of their lives. In a letter describing her novel &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot;, Heyer commented, &quot;&#x27;I think myself I ought to be shot for writing such nonsense. ... But it&#x27;s unquestionably good escapist literature and I think I should rather like it if I were sitting in an air-raid shelter or recovering from flu.&quot;

Heyer essentially invented the historical romance and created the subgenre of the Regency romance. When first released as mass market paperbacks in the United States in 1966, her novels were described as being &quot;in the tradition of Jane Austen&quot;. Heyer herself said her style was &quot;. . . really a mixture of Johnson and Austen--what I rely on is a certain gift for the farcical.&quot;. As other novelists began to imitate her style and continue to develop the Regency romance, their novels have been described as &quot;following in the romantic tradition of Georgette Heyer&quot;. According to Kay Mussell, &quot;virtually every Regency writer covets [that] accolade&quot;.

Due to Heyer&#x27;s identification with the Regency romance genre, her humour often is overlooked, but many observers have commented upon it. Stephen Fry, for instance, has written that Heyer &quot;. . . is one of the wittiest, most insightful and rewarding prose writers imaginable.&quot; Heyer enjoyed being humorous, remarking: &quot;Talk about my humour if you want to talk about me at all!&quot;. Kim Sherwood has pointed out that Heyer is &quot;frequently linked to P. G. Wodehouse in reviews and in online discussions by her fans&quot;. One reviewer said of Venetia that Heyer was &quot;. . . a past master of juggle buggle, which may be defined rather broadly as P. G. Wodehouse translated back into the 19th century English Regency period . . .&quot; The same critic referred to Sprig Muslin as &quot;. . . one of the most delightful bits of flimflamery this side of P.G. Wodehouse in his early days,&quot; and of Friday&#x27;s Child he wrote that several of its characters &quot;. . . are straight out of Wodehouse . . . if you can imagine Wodehouse&#x27;s young men translated to the Mayfair of 130 years ago . . .&quot;

Heyer has been criticised for antisemitism, in particular for a scene in &quot;The Grand Sophy&quot; (published in 1950). Courtney Milan has said that &quot;Georgette Heyer was a racist, and so her depiction of the era was deeply imperfect&quot;. Examination of family papers by Jennifer Kloester confirms she held prejudiced personal opinions. Psychoanalyst author, and Heyer fan, Amy Street, has written about her struggle to come to terms with Heyer&#x27;s antisemetism. In 2023, Heyer&#x27;s USA publisher, Sourcebooks, released an edited version of &quot;The Grand Sophy&quot; to change antisemitic language with the permission of the Georgette Heyer Estate. The estate decided to remove an afterword by Shakespeare Professor Mary Bly, who is also the romance author, Eloisa James, that provided context for the changed text, prompting Bly to withdraw her editing and commentary/context work from the project.

Despite her popularity and success, Heyer was largely ignored by critics other than Dorothy L. Sayers, who reviewed &quot;The Unfinished Clue&quot; and &quot;Death in the Stocks&quot; for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. Although none of her novels was ever reviewed in a serious newspaper, according to Duff Hart-Davis, &quot;the absence of long or serious reviews never worried her. What mattered was the fact that her stories sold in ever-increasing numbers&quot;. Heyer was also overlooked by the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. The 1974 edition of the encyclopædia, published shortly after her death, included entries on popular writers Agatha Christie and Sayers, but did not mention Heyer.

<doc id="80883" wikidata="Q1248840" url="?curid=80883" title="My World and Welcome to It">
<text>My World ... and Welcome to It is an American half-hour television sitcom based on the humor and cartoons of James Thurber.

It starred William Windom as John Monroe, a Thurber-like writer and cartoonist who works for a magazine closely resembling &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called &quot;The Manhattanite&quot;. Wry, fanciful and curmudgeonly, Monroe observes and comments on life, to the bemusement of his wife Ellen (Joan Hotchkis) and daughter Lydia (Lisa Gerritsen). Monroe&#x27;s frequent daydreams and fantasies are usually based on Thurber material.

The series, which ran for one season during the 1969–70 season on NBC, was created by Mel Shavelson, who wrote and directed the pilot episode and was one of its principal writers. Sheldon Leonard was executive producer. The show&#x27;s producer, Danny Arnold, co-wrote or directed numerous episodes, and appeared as Santa Claus in &quot;Rally Round the Flag&quot;.

==Series description==
Most episodes open with Monroe arriving in front of the house from the Thurber cartoon &quot;Home,&quot; which in the original cartoon has a woman&#x27;s face on one side of it. In the show, the house is initially house-shaped. The woman&#x27;s face is often animated to appear, as Ellen says something to John. The &quot;Home&quot; house, without the face, is used as an establishing shot throughout the episodes. Other Thurber cartoons are similarly animated over the course of the series—sometimes in the opening sequence, sometimes later in the episode. The episode &quot;Cristabel&quot; begins with Monroe lying on top of a cartoon doghouse, a reference to the non-Thurber cartoon character Snoopy. Animation for the series was by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises.

Henry Morgan had a recurring role as Philip Jensen, a writer for &quot;The Manhattanite&quot;, who was based on humorist Robert Benchley. Harold J. Stone played the editor, with whom Monroe is often at odds about the cartoon content. A female writer who appeared in one episode was loosely based on Dorothy Parker. Guest-stars included Lee Meriwether, Paul Ford, Joe Besser, Ray Walston, Craig Stevens, Danny Bonaduce, Talia Shire (as Talia Coppola), Cindy Williams, James Gregory and Noam Pitlik.

Live action adaptations of Thurber&#x27;s writing were another show staple. For example, &quot;Rally Round the Flag,&quot; in which Monroe purchases a very large flag as a gift, is loosely based on a Thurber piece called &quot;There&#x27;s a Time for Flags&quot;. An incident with a policeman in &quot;Cristabel&quot; is an almost verbatim transcription of the Thurber story &quot;The Topaz Cufflinks Mystery&quot;. &quot;Fables for Our Time&quot; is another source, as when John Monroe sees a unicorn in the back yard, a reference to &quot;The Unicorn in the Garden.&quot; Many of the episode titles are taken from Thurber&#x27;s &quot;Fables for Our Time&quot; (e.g., &quot;The Shrike and the Chipmunks&quot;) and other writings (&quot;Rules for a Happy Marriage&quot; and many more).

The character name of John Monroe is Thurber’s alter-ego in his book &quot;Owl in the Attic&quot;. Monroe and his family first came to television in a 1959 &quot;Alcoa Theatre/Goodyear Theatre&quot; production called &quot;Cristabel (The Secret Life of John Monroe)&quot; also written by Mel Shavelson. The dog Cristabel was named after a dog Thurber gave to his daughter. John Monroe also appears in a 1961 episode of &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot; called &quot;The Country Mouse&quot;, starring Orson Bean. This also uses animated versions of Thurber&#x27;s cartoons, and the story - cartoonist Monroe struggles to finish his work under the pressures of home and office - that could be regarded as an unofficial pilot for the My World series.

Despite the use of &quot;drawings, stories, inspirational pieces and things that go bump in the night by James Thurber&quot; (as stated in the opening credits), the show also contains character and story elements that owe little or nothing to Thurber&#x27;s work. For example, there is no Thurber basis for Monroe and daughter Lydia playing chess throughout &quot;Little Girls Are Sugar &amp; Spice - And Not Always Nice!&quot; Although Thurber material is woven around it, the episode&#x27;s storyline itself is fairly conventional situation comedy. William Windom, though, was a tournament chess player, so he most likely added that to the storyline as a personal touch.

Despite many positive reviews, moderate Nielsen ratings (aired opposite &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;) led NBC to cancel the series after one season. It was replaced by &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;, which NBC had poached from CBS. It then went on to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Comedy Series.

CBS reran &quot;My World and Welcome to It&quot; in the summer of 1972. Airings of the show after that were rare, as it was never syndicated nationally. Currently, the series has not been distributed on DVD, although bootlegs exist. 

==Episodes==

==Awards==
&quot;My World and Welcome to It&quot; won two Emmy Awards in 1970:
* Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Comedy Series (William Windom)
* Outstanding Comedy Series

It was also nominated for:
*Outstanding Achievement in any area of Creative Arts (&quot;Rally &#x27;Round the Flag Boys&quot; - special photographic effects).

==Book==

The similarly titled book by James Thurber, &quot;My World — And Welcome to It&quot;, was published in 1942 by Harcourt, Brace and Company. The current edition is . Part One of this collection contains 22 assorted Thurber short stories and humorous essays, many of them illustrated with his cartoons. Part Two consists of an eight-part comic memoir about France, written in 1937 and 1938, about twenty years after Thurber first arrived there near the conclusion of World War I. None of these stories, however, feature any of Thurber&#x27;s &quot;Monroe Family&quot; characters.

The tone of these pieces ranges from lighthearted wordplay and dialect (&quot;What Do You Mean It &quot;Was&quot; Brillig?&quot;) to literary satire (&quot;The Macbeth Murder Mystery&quot;) to psychological horror (&quot;The Whip-Poor-Will&quot; and &quot;A Friend to Alexander&quot;). The most famous story is &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,&quot; which bears little resemblance to the 1947 film of the same name.

<doc id="80888" wikidata="Q244985" url="?curid=80888" title="Unas">
<text>Unas or Wenis, also spelled Unis (, hellenized form Oenas or Onnos; died 2345), was a king, the ninth and last ruler of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt during the Old Kingdom. Unas reigned for 15 to 30 years in the mid-24th century BC (c. 2345–2315 BC), succeeding Djedkare Isesi, who might have been his father.

Little is known of Unas&#x27; activities during his reign, which was a time of economic decline. Egypt maintained trade relations with the Levantine coast and Nubia, and military action may have taken place in southern Canaan. The growth and decentralization of the administration in conjunction with the lessening of the king&#x27;s power continued under Unas, ultimately contributing to the collapse of the Old Kingdom some 200 years later.

Unas built a pyramid in Saqqara, the smallest of the royal pyramids completed during the Old Kingdom. The accompanying mortuary complex with its high and valley temples linked by a causeway was lavishly decorated with painted reliefs, whose quality and variety surpass the usual royal iconography. Furthermore, Unas was the first pharaoh to have the &quot;Pyramid Texts&quot; carved and painted on the walls of the chambers of his pyramid, a major innovation that was followed by his successors until the First Intermediate Period (). These texts identify the king with Ra and with Osiris, whose cult was on the rise in Unas&#x27; time, and were meant to help the king reach the afterlife.

Unas had several daughters and possibly one or two sons who are believed to have predeceased him. Manetho, a third-century BC Egyptian priest of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and author of the first history of Egypt, claims that with Unas&#x27; death the Fifth Dynasty came to an end. Unas was succeeded by Teti, the first pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty, possibly after a short crisis. However, the archaeological evidence suggests that the Egyptians at the time made no conscious break with the preceding dynasty and the distinction between the Fifth and Sixth dynasties might be illusory.

The funerary cult of Unas established at his death continued until the end of the Old Kingdom and may have survived during the chaotic First Intermediate Period. The cult was still in existence or revived during the later Middle Kingdom (c. 2050 – c. 1650 BC). This did not prevent Amenemhat I and Senusret I (c. 1990 – c. 1930 BC) from partially dismantling the mortuary complex of Unas for its materials.

In parallel to the official cult, Unas may have received popular veneration as a local god of Saqqara until as late as the Late Period (664–332 BC), nearly 2,000 years after his death.

==Attestations==

===Historical sources===
Unas is well attested by historical sources with three ancient Egyptian king lists dating to the New Kingdom period mentioning him. He occupies the 33rd entry of the Abydos King List, which was written during the reign of Seti I (1290–1279 BC). Unas&#x27; name is also present on the Saqqara Tablet (32nd entry) and on the Turin canon (third column, 25th row), both of which were written during the reign of Ramses II (1279–1213 BC). The Turin canon further credits Unas with 30 years of reign. These sources all place Unas as the ninth and final ruler of the Fifth Dynasty, succeeding Djedkare Isesi and preceding Teti on the throne. This relative chronology is corroborated by archaeological evidence, for example in the tomb of officials serving under these kings.

In addition to these sources, Unas was also likely mentioned in the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;, a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II (283–246 BC) by the Egyptian priest Manetho. No copies of the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; have survived to this day and it is known to us only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. Africanus relates that the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; mentioned a pharaoh &quot;Onnos&quot; reigning for 33 years at the end of the Fifth Dynasty. Onnos is believed to be the hellenized form for Unas, and Africanus&#x27; 33-year figure fits well with the 30 years of reign given to Unas on the Turin canon.

===Contemporaneous sources===

The primary contemporaneous sources attesting to Unas&#x27; activities are the many reliefs from his pyramid complex. Excluding these, surprisingly few documents dating to Unas&#x27; reign have survived to this day, considering the 30-year length that later records give for his reign. Excavations at Abusir, the royal necropolis of the Fifth Dynasty, have produced only four dated inscriptions safely attributable to Unas. They explicitly mention his third, fourth, sixth and eighth years on the throne. Unas also left a rock inscription on the island of Elephantine, next to the First Cataract of the Nile in Nubia.

In addition, several alabaster vases bearing Unas&#x27; cartouche are known. A complete vessel and additional fragments originating from Byblos on the Levantine coast are now in the National Museum of Beirut. A vase of unknown provenance is located in the National Archaeological Museum of Florence and reads &quot;Horus Wadjtawy, living eternally, king of Upper and Lower Egypt, son of Ra, Unas, living eternally&quot;. Another vessel, of unknown origins, is on display at the Louvre Museum. It is a , globular alabaster vase finely decorated with a falcon with outstretched wings and two uraei, or rearing cobras, holding ankh signs surrounding Unas&#x27; cartouche. An ointment jar bearing Unas&#x27; cartouche and Horus name is in the Brooklyn Museum. Finally, a fragment of a calcite vase rim bearing two cartouches of Unas is on display in the Petrie Museum.

Unas assumed the throne at the death of his predecessor Djedkare Isesi. Djedkare is thought to have been Unas&#x27; father, in spite of the complete lack of evidence bearing on the question. The succession from Djedkare Isesi to Unas seems to have been smooth.

Unas had at least two queens, Nebet and Khenut, who were buried in a large double mastaba adjacent to their husband&#x27;s pyramid. Unas and Nebet possibly had a son, the &quot;king&#x27;s son&quot;, &quot;royal chamberlain&quot;, &quot;priest of Maat&quot; and &quot;overseer of Upper Egypt&quot; Unas-Ankh, who died about 10 years into Unas&#x27; reign. The filiation of Unas-Ankh is indirectly hinted at by his name and titles and by the presence of his tomb near those of Nebet and Unas but is not universally accepted. Two other sons have been proposed, Nebkauhor and Shepsespuptah, but these filiations are conjectural and contested. Unas likely died without a male heir.

Unas had at least five daughters named Hemetre Hemi, Khentkaues, Neferut, Nefertkaues Iku, and Sesheshet Idut. The status of another possible daughter, Iput, is uncertain.
===Duration===

The duration of Unas&#x27; reign is uncertain. As indicated above, historical sources credit him with 30 and 33 years on the throne, figures that have been adopted by many Egyptologists, including Flinders Petrie, William C. Hayes, Darrell Baker, Peter Munro, and Jaromir Malek. In favor of such a long reign are scenes of a Sed festival found in Unas&#x27; mortuary temple. This festival was normally celebrated only after 30 years of reign and was meant to rejuvenate the pharaoh&#x27;s strength and power. Mere depictions of the festival do not necessarily imply a long reign, however. For example, a relief showing pharaoh Sahure in the tunic of the Sed festival has been found in his mortuary temple, although both historical sources and archeological evidence agree that he ruled Egypt for less than 14 full years.

Other Egyptologists suspect a reign of less than 30 years for Unas, owing to the scarcity of artefacts datable to his reign as well as the lack of documents dated to beyond his eighth year on the throne. Hence, Jürgen von Beckerath believes that Unas ruled Egypt for 20 years while Rolf Krauss, David Warburton and Erik Hornung shortened this number to 15 years in their 2012 study of Egyptian chronology. Krauss and Miroslav Verner further question the credibility of the Turin Canon concerning the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties, so that the 30-year figure credited to Unas by the canon might not be reliable.

Excavations of the tomb of Nikau-Isesi under the direction of Naguib Kanawati at Saqqara have yielded evidence in support of a shorter reign. Nikau-Isesi was an official who started his career during the reign of Djedkare Isesi. He lived through that of Unas and died as overseer of Upper-Egypt under Unas&#x27; successor Teti. Nikau-Isesi is known to have died on the year of the eleventh cattle count during Teti&#x27;s reign, an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom and every year during the later Middle Kingdom (). Thus, Nikau-Isesi would have lived for 22 years after Teti took the throne and together with the 30 years of reign credited to Unas, would have died past 70 years old. However, forensic examination of his mummy yielded an age at death of no more than 45 years old. This suggests that the cattle count occurred more than once every two years during Unas and Teti&#x27;s time, possibly irregularly. If so, Unas&#x27; 30-year figure on the Turin canon, understood to mean 15 cattle counts, could translate into as little as 15 years, which together with just 11 years during Teti&#x27;s reign would account for Nikau-Isesi&#x27;s death at around 40 to 45 years of age.

===Activities===

; Trade and warfare
Owing to the scarcity of evidence dating to Unas&#x27; reign, we know very little about his activities. Existing trade relations with foreign countries and cities, in particular Byblos, seem to have continued during Unas&#x27; time on the throne. Reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex show two large seagoing ships coming back from an expedition to the Levantine coast with Syro-Canaanite men, who were either the boat crews or slaves. Another relief depicts a military campaign, Egyptians armed with bows and daggers attacking Canaanite nomads called the Shasu. Similar reliefs have been found in preceding pyramid complexes, such as that of Sahure, and they may thus be standard themes rather than depictions of actual events. Other sources tend to confirm the accuracy of these depictions; for example, the autobiography of Weni relates many punitive raids against Canaanite nomads in the early Sixth Dynasty.

To the South of Egypt, inscriptions of Unas on Elephantine record a visit of the king to Lower Nubia, possibly to receive tribute from local chieftains or because of growing unrest in the region. In addition, a relief from the causeway of Unas leading to his pyramid shows a giraffe, suggesting trade relations with Nubia.

; Domestic

Unas&#x27; reign was a time of economic decline although, as the French Egyptologist Nicolas Grimal writes, it was &quot;by no means a time of decadence&quot;. Indeed, the Egyptian state was still capable of mounting important expeditions to provide building stones for the king&#x27;s pyramid complex. These expeditions are depicted on unique reliefs found in Unas&#x27; causeway and are also referred to in the autobiographical stela of an administration official. This official reports the transport of palmiform columns of red granite from Elephantine to Saqqara in only four days, a feat for which he was praised by the king. In addition to the important construction works undertaken in Saqqara for the construction of his pyramid complex, building activities also took place on Elephantine.

Until 1996, the domestic situation during Unas&#x27; reign was thought to have been disastrous, based on reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex showing emaciated people and thus suggesting times of famine. This changed when excavations at Abusir in 1996 yielded similar reliefs in the mortuary complex of Sahure, who reigned at a prosperous time in the early Fifth Dynasty. In addition, research showed that the starving people are likely to be desert dwellers, nomads distinguished by their specific hair-style, rather than Egyptians. Thus, these reliefs are now understood to be standard representations of the generosity of the king towards the destitute and of the hardships of life in the desert regions bordering Egypt rather than referring to actual events.

===Death and end of a dynasty===
In his history of Egypt, Manetho states that with the death of Unas the Fifth Dynasty came to an end. This may be because Unas died without a male heir, his probable son Unas-Ankh having predeceased him. This might have caused a succession crisis hinted at by the personal name chosen by Teti upon his accession to the throne: &quot;Seheteptawy&quot; meaning &quot;He who reconciles/pacifies the two lands&quot;. Teti&#x27;s claim to the throne could have relied on his marriage to Iput, who may have been a daughter of Unas. This possibility is heavily debated, as the interpretation of Iput&#x27;s titles that would indicate that she was the daughter of a king is uncertain. Furthermore, the idea that Teti could legitimate his claim by marrying into the royal family is rejected by many Egyptologists, including Munro, Dobrev, Baud, Mertz, Pirenne, and Robin, who do not think that the right to the pharaonic throne passed through the female line.

In addition to Manetho&#x27;s statement, the Turin king list presents a special break point between Unas and his successor Teti.
Although the king list is not organized in dynasties–which were invented by Manetho–the Egyptologist Jaromir Malek explains that &quot;the criterion for such divisions in the Turin Canon invariably was the change of location of the capital and royal residence.&quot; Malek thus suggests that the capital of Egypt, then known as Inbu-Hedj, was indeed supplanted at the time by settlements located to the South, East of South Saqqara, where Unas&#x27; palace may have been located. In the second millennium BC these cities finally merged and gave rise to Memphis.

Whatever the basis for Manetho&#x27;s choice to end the Fifth Dynasty with Unas, Egyptians living at the time probably perceived no particular change from one dynasty to the next. The administration of the state shows no evidence of disturbances, with many officials continuing their careers from Unas&#x27; onto Teti&#x27;s reign. These include the viziers Mehu, Kagemni and Nikau-Isesi and the overseer of the province of Edfu Isi. Given that the Egyptians of the Old Kingdom might not have conceived of dynasties, the distinction between the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties might be illusory.

==Evolution of religion and kingship==
The reigns of Djedkare Isesi and of Unas were a time of changes in Ancient Egyptian religion and in the ideology of kingship, changes that are first demonstrable under Unas. A statistical analysis of clay seal fragments bearing Horus names of pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty points to a marked decline of the cult of the king during Unas&#x27; time on the throne. This continued under Unas&#x27; successor Teti, for whom we know only two seals bearing his Horus name. This trend reflects the lessening of the king&#x27;s power in conjunction with the growth of the administration and priesthood.

Meanwhile, the cult of Osiris was becoming more important with this god replacing the king as the guarantor of life after death for the pharaoh&#x27;s subjects. The German Egyptologist Hartwig Altenmüller writes that for an Egyptian of the time &quot;the [...] afterlife no longer depends on the relationship between the individual mortal and the king, [...] instead it is linked to his ethical position in direct relation to Osiris&quot;. In contrast, the cult of the sun god Ra was in apparent decline, even though Ra was still the most important deity of the Egyptian pantheon. Thus, Djedkare Isesi and Unas did not build a sun temple in contrast with most of their Fifth Dynasty predecessors. In addition, the names of Menkauhor Kaiu and Unas do not incorporate any reference to Ra, in rupture with a tradition which held since the reign of Userkaf, about a century earlier. The &quot;Pyramid Texts&quot; found in Unas&#x27; pyramid demonstrate the importance of Osiris and Ra in ancient Egyptian religion at the time. Both gods were believed to play the key roles in accessing the afterlife, with Ra as the source of life and Osiris as the force through which the next life would be attained.

==Pyramid complex==
Unas had a pyramid built for himself in North Saqqara, between the pyramid of Sekhemkhet and the southwestern corner of the pyramid complex of Djoser, in symmetry with the pyramid of Userkaf located at the northeastern corner. In the process, workers leveled and covered older tombs located in the area, most notably the tomb of the Second Dynasty pharaoh Hotepsekhemwy (c. 2890 BC).

The original Egyptian name of the pyramid was &quot;Nefer Isut Unas&quot;, meaning &quot;Beautiful are the places of Unas&quot;. The pyramid of Unas is the smallest of the pyramids completed during the Old Kingdom, having a square base of for a height of .

===Mortuary complex===

The pyramid of Unas is part of a larger mortuary complex built around it. It was approached via an ancient lake on the shores of which Unas&#x27; valley temple was located. This temple received the provisions for the cult of the king and the offerings to be made were prepared there. At the back of the valley temple was the beginning of a causeway, equaled only by that of Khufu, and leading to an upper temple adjacent to the pyramid. A thin slit in the roof of the causeway allowed the light to illuminate its walls covered for their entire length in painted reliefs. These depicted the Egyptian seasons, processions of people from the nomes of Egypt, craftsmen at work, offerings bearers, battle scenes and the transport of granite columns for the construction of the pyramid complex.

At the end of the causeway was a large hall leading to a pillared open court surrounded by magazine chambers. The court led into the mortuary temple proper which housed statues of the king and where the offerings to the deceased took place. This was immediately adjacent to the eastern side of the pyramid, which was surrounded by an enclosure wall defining the sacred space. At the southeast corner of the enclosure was a small satellite pyramid for the Ka of the king. The internal chambers of the pyramid were entered in 1881 by Gaston Maspero, who thus discovered the pyramid texts. The burial chamber housed nothing but a black greywacke sarcophagus sunk into the floor and a canopic chest. The sarcophagus proved to contain scattered bones, which may belong to Unas.

===Pyramid Texts===
The main innovation of the pyramid of Unas is the first appearance of the Pyramid Texts, one of the oldest religious texts in Egypt to have survived to this day. In doing so, Unas initiated a tradition that would be followed in the pyramid of the kings and queens of the Sixth to Eighth Dynasties, until the end of the Old Kingdom circa 200 years later.

In total 283 magical spells, also known as utterances, were carved and the signs painted blue on the walls of the corridor, antechamber, and burial chamber of Unas&#x27; pyramid. They constitute the most complete rendition of the Pyramid Texts existing today. These spells were intended to help the king in overcoming hostile forces and powers in the Underworld and thus join with the sun god Ra, his divine father in the afterlife. By writing the texts on the walls of the pyramid&#x27;s internal chambers, the architects of Unas&#x27; pyramid ensured that the king would benefit from their potency even if the funerary cult was to cease.
Hence, the Pyramid Texts of the pyramid of Unas incorporate instructions for ritual actions and words to be spoken, suggesting that they were precisely those performed and recited during the cult of the king in his mortuary temple.

The good preservation of the texts in Unas&#x27; pyramid shows that they were arranged so as to be read by the Ba of Unas, as it arose from the sarcophagus thanks to resurrection utterances and surrounded by protective spells and ritual offerings. The Ba would then leave the burial chamber, which incorporates texts identifying the king with Osiris in the Duat, and would move to the antechamber symbolizing the Akhet. Included in the spells written on the walls of the antechamber of Unas are two utterances known as the Cannibal Hymn, which portrays the pharaoh as flying to heaven through a stormy sky and eating both gods and men. In doing so the king would receive the life force of the gods. At this point the Ba of Unas would face east, the direction of the sunrise, and beyond the pyramid masonry, the false door of the mortuary temple where funerary rituals were performed. Finally, turning left the Ba would join Ra in the sky by passing through the pyramid corridor.

An example of a spell from the pyramid of Unas is Utterance 217:Re-Atum, this Unas comes to you&lt;br&gt;A spirit indestructible&lt;br&gt;Your son comes to you&lt;br&gt; This Unas comes to you&lt;br&gt; May you cross the sky united in the dark&lt;br&gt; May you rise in lightland, the place in which you shine!

==Legacy==

Unas&#x27; most immediate legacy is his funerary cult, which continued at least until the end of the Old Kingdom. This cult is attested by the tombs at Saqqara of seven priests responsible for the religious duties to be performed in the funerary complex. Three of these tombs date to the early Sixth Dynasty in the time following the death of Pepi I. Three more tombs date to the reign of Pepi II and the last one dates to the very end of the Old Kingdom (c. 2180 BC). The priests of the cult of Unas adopted basilophorous names, incorporating that of the king, possibly upon taking office.

Unas&#x27; funerary cult appears to have survived during the chaotic First Intermediate Period until the Middle Kingdom. By the time of the 12th Dynasty (c. 1990–c. 1800 BC), the lector-priest Unasemsaf and his family were involved in the cult of Unas. In spite of this, Unas&#x27; funerary complex was partially dismantled and its materials reemployed for the construction of Amenemhat I and Senusret Is&#x27; own pyramid complexes.

In addition to his official cult, Unas was deified and became a local god of the Saqqara necropolis. Grimal attributes this directly to the grandeur of his funerary complex. Malek doubts the existence of a popular cult of Unas during the Old Kingdom but acknowledges it from the Middle Kingdom onwards. He attributes this Middle Kingdom revival to the geographic position of Unas&#x27; complex making it a natural gateway to the Saqqara necropolis. The popular cult of the deified Unas continued for nearly 2,000 years as shown by the numerous scarabs bearing Unas&#x27; name found in Saqqara and dated from the New Kingdom (c. 1550–c. 1077 BC) until the Late Period (664–332 BC). The epicenter of this cult was not the pyramid of Unas nor the associated mortuary temple but rather the statues of the king in the valley temple.
This activity could explain why the pyramid complex of Unas was the object of restoration works under the impulse of Prince Khaemweset, a son of Ramesses II (1279–1213 BC).

<doc id="80895" wikidata="Q192408" url="?curid=80895" title="Taiping Rebellion">
<text>The Taiping Rebellion, also known as the Taiping Civil War or the Taiping Revolution, was a civil war in China between the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the Hakka-led Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. The conflict lasted 14 years, from its outbreak in 1850 until the fall of Taiping-controlled Nanjing—which they had renamed &quot;Tianjing&quot; &quot;heavenly capital&quot;—in 1864. The last rebel forces were defeated in August 1871. Estimates of the conflict&#x27;s death toll range between 20 and 30 million people, representing 5–10% of China&#x27;s population at that time. While the Qing ultimately defeated the rebellion, the victory came at a great cost to the state&#x27;s economic and political viability.

The uprising was led by Hong Xiuquan, an ethnic Hakka who had proclaimed himself to be the brother of Jesus Christ. Hong sought the religious conversion of the Han people to his syncretic version of Christianity, as well as the political overthrow of the Qing dynasty, and a general transformation of the mechanisms of state. Rather than supplanting China&#x27;s ruling class, the Taiping rebels sought to entirely upend the country&#x27;s social order. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom located at Nanjing managed to seize control of significant portions of southern China. At its peak, the Heavenly Kingdom ruled over a population of nearly 30 million people.

For more than a decade, Taiping armies occupied and fought across much of the mid- and lower Yangtze valley, ultimately devolving into civil war. It was the largest war in China since the Ming–Qing transition, involving most of Central and Southern China. It ranks as one of the bloodiest wars in human history, the bloodiest civil war, and the largest conflict of the 19th century, comparable to World War I in terms of deaths. Thirty million people fled the conquered regions to foreign settlements or other parts of China. The war was characterized by extreme brutality on both sides. Taiping soldiers carried out widespread massacres of Manchus, the ethnic minority of the ruling Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro. Meanwhile, the Qing government also engaged in massacres, most notably against the civilian population of Nanjing.

Weakened severely by internal conflicts following an attempted coup and the failure of the siege of Beijing, the Taiping rebels were defeated by decentralised provincial armies such as the Xiang Army organised and commanded by Zeng Guofan. After moving down the Yangtze River and recapturing the strategic city of Anqing, Zeng&#x27;s forces besieged Nanjing during May 1862. After two more years, on June 1, 1864, Hong Xiuquan died during the siege, caused from the consumption of weeds in the palace grounds as well as suspicions of poison. Nanjing fell barely a month later.

The 14-year civil war coincided with internal and external conflicts of the Opium Wars and the future Boxer Rebellion to further weaken the Qing dynasty&#x27;s grasp on central China. The Taiping rebellion gave incentive for an initially successful period of reform and self-strengthening, although shadowed by social and religious unrest within China, exacerbating ethnic disputes and accelerating the rise of provincial power. Historians debate whether these developments played a role in the start of the Warlord Era, the loss of central control after the establishment of the Republic of China in 1912.

== Names ==

The terms which writers use for the conflict and its participants often represent their different opinions. During the 19th century, the Qing did not describe the conflict as either a civil war or a movement, because doing so would have lent credibility to the Taiping. Instead, they referred to the tumultuous civil war as a period of chaos (), rebellion () or military ascendancy (). They often referred to it as the Hong-Yang Rebellion (), referring to the two most prominent leaders. It was also dismissively referred to as the Red Sheep Rebellion () because the two names sound similar in Chinese.

In modern China, the war is often referred to as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement, due to the fact that the Taiping espoused a doctrine which was both nationalist and communist, and the Taiping represented a popular ideology which was based on either Han nationalism or protocommunist values. The scholar Jian Youwen is among those who refer to the rebellion as the &quot;Taiping Revolutionary Movement&quot; on the grounds that it worked towards a complete change in the political and social system, rather than working towards the replacement of one dynasty with another.

Many Western historians refer to the conflict in general as the &quot;Taiping Rebellion&quot;. In 2013, scholars such as [Tobie Meyer-Fong and Stephen Platt argued that the term &quot;Taiping Rebellion&quot; is biased, because it insinuates that the Qing government was a legitimate government which was fighting against the illegitimate Taiping rebels. Instead, they argue that the conflict should be called a &quot;civil war&quot;. Other historians such as Jürgen Osterhammel term the conflict the &quot;Taiping Revolution&quot; because of the rebels&#x27; radical transformational objectives and the social revolution that they initiated.

Little is known about how the Taiping referred to the war, but the Taiping often referred to the Qing in general and the Manchus in particular as some variant of demons or monsters (), representing Hong&#x27;s proclamation that they were fighting a holy war to rid the world of demons and establish paradise on earth. The Qing referred to the Taiping as &quot;Yue Bandits&quot; ( or ) in official sources, a reference to their origins in the southeastern province of Guangdong.

More colloquially, the Chinese called the Taiping some variant of Long-Hairs (), because they did not shave their foreheads and braid their hair into a queue as Qing subjects were obligated to do, allowing their hair to grow long.

== Background ==

During the 19th century, the Qing dynasty experienced a series of famines, natural disasters, economic problems and defeats at the hands of foreign powers. Farmers were heavily overtaxed, rents rose dramatically, and peasants started to desert their lands in droves. The Qing military had recently suffered a disastrous defeat in the First Opium War, while the Chinese economy was severely impacted by a trade imbalance caused by the large-scale and illicit importation of opium. Banditry became common, and numerous secret societies and self-defense units formed, all of which led to an increase in small-scale warfare.

Meanwhile, the population of China had nearly doubled between 1766 and 1833, while the amount of cultivated land remained the same. The government, commanded by ethnic Manchus, had become increasingly corrupt, and was weak in southern regions where local clans dominated. Anti-Manchu sentiment was strongest in southern China among the Hakka community, a Han Chinese subgroup. Meanwhile, Christian missionaries were active.

In 1837, Hong Huoxiu, a Hakka from a poor village in Guangdong, failed the imperial examination for the third time, frustrating his ambition to become a scholar-official in the civil service and leading him to a nervous breakdown. While recovering, Hong dreamed of visiting Heaven, where he discovered that he possessed a celestial family distinct from his earthly family. His heavenly father lamented that men were worshiping demons rather than himself and informed Hong that his given name violated taboos and had to be changed, suggesting &quot;Hong Xiuquan&quot;, the moniker ultimately adopted by Hong. In later embellishments, Hong declared that he saw Confucius being punished by his celestial father for leading the people astray.

In 1843, Hong failed the imperial examinations for the fourth and final time. It was only then, prompted by a visit by his cousin, that Hong took time to carefully examine Christian pamphlets he had received from a Protestant Christian missionary several years earlier. After reading these pamphlets, Hong came to believe that they had given him the key to interpreting his visions: his celestial father was God the Father (whom he identified with Shangdi from Chinese tradition), the elder brother that he had seen was Jesus Christ, and he had been directed to rid the world of demons, including the corrupt Qing government and Confucian teachings. 

In 1847, Hong went to Guangzhou, where he studied the Bible with Issachar Jacox Roberts, an American Baptist missionary. Roberts refused to baptize him and later stated that Hong&#x27;s followers were &quot;bent on making their burlesque religious pretensions serve their political purpose&quot;.
In 1844, soon after Hong began preaching across Guangxi, his follower Feng Yunshan founded the God Worshipping Society, a movement which followed Hong&#x27;s fusion of Christianity, Taoism, Confucianism and indigenous millenarianism, which Hong presented as a restoration of the ancient Chinese faith in Shangdi. The Taiping faith, says one historian, &quot;developed into a dynamic new Chinese religion ... Taiping Christianity&quot;.

In the late 1840s, the movement at first grew by suppressing groups of bandits and pirates in southern China. Suppression by Qing authorities led it to evolve into guerrilla warfare and subsequently a widespread civil war. Eventually, two other God Worshipers claimed to possess the ability to speak as members of the &quot;Celestial Family&quot;, the Father in the case of Yang Xiuqing and Jesus Christ in the case of Xiao Chaogui.

==1851–1853: Outbreak and initial stages==
The Taiping Rebellion began in the southern province of Guangxi when local officials launched a campaign of religious persecution against the God Worshipping Society. In early January 1851, following a small-scale battle in late December 1850, a 10,000-strong rebel army organized by Feng Yunshan and Wei Changhui routed Qing forces stationed in Jintian (present-day Guiping, Guangxi). Taiping forces successfully repulsed an attempted imperial reprisal by the Green Standard Army against the Jintian uprising.

On January 11, 1851, Hong declared himself the Heavenly King of the Heavenly Kingdom of Peace, or Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, from which comes the term &quot;Taipings&quot; commonly used for them in English-language studies. In September 1851, the Taipings began marching north to escape Qing forces closing in on them. The Taiping army pressed north into Hunan following the Xiang River, besieging Changsha, occupying Yuezhou, and capturing Wuchang in December 1852 after reaching the Yangtze River. At this point the Taiping leadership decided to move east along the Yangtze River. In February 1853, Anqing was captured .

Taiping leaders may have reached out to Triad organizations, which had many cells in South China and among government troops. Taiping titles echoed Triad usage, whether consciously or not, which made it more attractive for Triads to join the movement. In 1852, Qing government troops captured Hong Daquan, a rebel who had assumed the title &quot;Tian De Wang&quot; (King of Heavenly Virtue). Hong Daquan&#x27;s confession claimed that Hong Xiuquan had made him co-sovereign of the Heavenly Kingdom and given him that title, but was more likely an echo of an earlier but unconnected White Lotus Rebellion. However, the capture of Nanjing in that year led to a deterioration of relations between the Taiping rebels and the triads.

== 1853–1860: Control of Nanjing and expeditions ==

On March 19, 1853, the Taipings captured the city of Nanjing and Hong renamed it &quot;Tianjing&quot;, or the &#x27;heavenly capital&#x27; of his kingdom. Since the Taipings considered the Manchus to be demons, they first killed all the Manchu men, then forced the Manchu women outside the city and burned them to death. Shortly thereafter, the Taiping launched concurrent Northern and Western expeditions, in an effort to relieve pressure on Nanjing and achieve significant territorial gains. The Northern expedition was a complete failure but the Western achieved limited success.

In 1853, Hong Xiuquan withdrew from active control of policies and administration to rule exclusively by written proclamations. He lived in luxury and had many women in his inner chamber, and often issued religious strictures. He clashed with Yang Xiuqing, who challenged his often impractical policies, and became suspicious of Yang&#x27;s ambitions, his extensive network of spies and his claims of authority when &quot;speaking as God&quot;. This tension culminated in the 1856 Tianjing Incident, with Yang and his followers slaughtered by Wei Changhui, Qin Rigang, and their troops on Hong Xiuquan&#x27;s orders.

Shi Dakai&#x27;s objection to the bloodshed led to his family and retinue being killed by Wei and Qin with Wei ultimately planning to imprison Hong. Wei&#x27;s plans were ultimately thwarted and he and Qin were executed by Hong. Shi Dakai was given control of five Taiping armies, which were consolidated into one. Fearing for his life, he departed from Tianjing and headed west towards Sichuan.

With Hong withdrawn from view and Yang out of the picture, the remaining Taiping leaders tried to widen their popular support and forge alliances with European powers, but failed on both counts. The Europeans decided to stay officially neutral, though European military advisors served with the Qing army.

Inside China, the rebellion faced resistance from the traditionalist rural classes because of hostility to Chinese culture and Confucian values. The landowning upper class, unsettled by the Taiping ideology and the policy of strict separation of the sexes, even for married couples, sided with government forces.

In Hunan, the local irregular Xiang Army under the personal leadership of Zeng Guofan, became the main force fighting the Taiping on behalf of the Qing. Zeng&#x27;s Xiang Army proved effective in gradually turning back the Taiping advance in the western theater of the war and ultimately retaking much of Hubei and Jiangxi provinces. In December 1856 Qing forces retook Wuchang for the final time. In May 1858, the Xiang Army captured Jiujiang and then the rest of Jiangxi by September.

In 1859, Hong Rengan, Hong Xiuquan&#x27;s cousin, joined the Taiping forces in Nanjing and was given considerable power by Hong. Hong Rengan developed an ambitious plan to expand the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom&#x27;s boundaries.

In May 1860, the Taiping defeated the imperial forces that had been besieging Nanjing since 1853, eliminating them from the region and opening the way for a successful invasion of southern Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the wealthiest region of the Qing Empire. The Taiping rebels were successful in taking Hangzhou on March 19, 1860, Changzhou on May 26, and Suzhou on June 2 to the east. While Taiping forces were preoccupied in Jiangsu, Zeng&#x27;s forces moved down the Yangtze River.

== 1861–1864: Faltering and collapse ==

An attempt to take Shanghai begun in June 1861 was repulsed after 15 months by an army of Qing troops supported by European officers under the command of Frederick Townsend Ward. This army would become known as the &quot;Ever Victorious Army&quot;, a seasoned and well-trained Qing military force commanded by Charles George Gordon, and was instrumental in the defeat of the Taiping rebels.

In 1861, around the time of the death of the Xianfeng Emperor and ascension of the Tongzhi Emperor, Zeng Guofan&#x27;s Xiang Army captured Anqing with help from a naval blockade imposed by the Royal Navy on the city. Near the end of 1861 the Taipings launched a final Eastern Expedition. Ningbo was easily captured on 9 December. Hangzhou was besieged and captured on 31 December. In January 1862, Taiping troops surrounded Shanghai, but were unable to capture it.

in 1862, the Ever-Victorious Army repulsed another attack on Shanghai and helped to defend other treaty ports such as Ningbo, reclaimed on 10 May. They also aided imperial troops in reconquering Taiping strongholds along the Yangtze River.

In 1863, Shi Dakai surrendered to the Qing near the Sichuan capital Chengdu and was executed by slow-slicing. Some of his followers escaped or were released and continued the fight against the Qing.

Qing forces were reorganized under the command of Zeng Guofan, Zuo Zongtang and Li Hongzhang, and the Qing reconquest began in earnest. Zeng Guofan had initially failed so badly that he attempted suicide, but he then adopted the teachings of the 16th-century Ming general Qi Jiguang. He bypassed the professional regular armies and recruited from local villages, paying and drilling them well. Zeng, Zuo and Li led personally loyal soldiers. By early 1864, Qing control in most areas had been reestablished.

In May 1862, the Xiang Army besieged Nanjing. Attempts to break the siege by the numerically superior Taiping Army failed. Hong Xiuquan declared that God would defend the city. The city&#x27;s food supplies ran low. Hong contracted food poisoning from eating wild vegetables; the intent may have been suicide. He died in June 1864 after a 20-day illness. A few days later, the Qing took the city in the Third Battle of Nanjing. On 1 August, Zeng Guofan ordered Hong&#x27;s body exhumed for verification, and desecrated as spiritual punishment. After exhumation, it was dismembered, cremated, and its ashes were fired from a cannon to scatter them irretrievably.

Four months before the fall of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Hong Xiuquan abdicated in favor of his eldest son Hong Tianguifu, who was 15 years old. The younger Hong was inexperienced and powerless, so the kingdom was quickly destroyed when Nanjing fell in July 1864 to the imperial armies after protracted street-by-street fighting. Tianguifu and few others escaped but were soon caught and executed. Most of the Taiping princes were executed.

A small remainder of loyal Taiping forces had continued to fight in northern Zhejiang, rallying around Tianguifu. After Tianguifu&#x27;s capture on 25 October 1864, Taiping resistance was gradually pushed into the highlands of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian and finally Guangdong, where one of the last Taiping loyalists, Wang Haiyang, was defeated on January 29, 1866.

== Aftermath ==
Although the fall of Nanjing in 1864 marked the destruction of the Taiping regime, the fight was not yet over. There were still several hundred thousand Taiping troops continuing the fight, with more than a quarter-million fighting in the border regions of Jiangxi and Fujian alone. In August 1871, the last Taiping army led by Shi Dakai&#x27;s commander, Li Fuzhong (), was completely wiped out by government forces in the border region of Hunan, Guizhou and Guangxi.

Taiping wars also spilled over into Vietnam with devastating effects. In 1860, Wu Lingyun (), an ethnic Zhuang Taiping leader, proclaimed himself King of Dingling () in the Sino-Vietnamese border regions. Dingling was destroyed during a Qing campaign in 1868. His son Wu Yazhong, also called Wu Kun (), fled to Vietnam. He was killed in 1869 in Thái Nguyên by a Qing-Vietnamese coalition headed by Feng Zicai.

Wu Kun&#x27;s troops broke up and became marauding armies such as the Yellow Flag Army led by Huang Chongying () and the Black Flag Army led by Liu Yongfu. Liu Yongfu became a prominent warlord in Upper Tonkin and later helped the Nguyễn dynasty to engage against the French during the Sino-French War in the 1880s. He later became the second and last leader of the short-lived Republic of Formosa.

Other &quot;Flag Gangs&quot; armed with the latest weapons, disintegrated into bandit groups that plundered remnants of the Lan Xang kingdom. They were then engaged in the Haw wars (misnamed due to conflation with Chinese Muslims) against the incompetent forces of King Rama V until 1890, when the last of the groups eventually disbanded.

=== Death toll ===
With no reliable census at the time, estimates of the death toll of the Taiping Rebellion are speculative. The most widely cited sources estimate the total number of deaths during the almost 14 years of the rebellion to be approximately 20 to 30 million civilians and soldiers. Most of the deaths were attributed to plague and famine. Some analysts have claimed that the death toll may have reached 100 million.

=== Concurrent rebellions ===

The Nian Rebellion (1853–1868), and several Chinese Muslim rebellions in the southwest (the Panthay Rebellion, 1855–1873) and the northwest (Dungan revolt, 1862–1877) continued to pose considerable problems for the Qing dynasty.

Occasionally, the Nian rebels collaborated with Taiping forces, for instance, they collaborated during the Northern Expedition. As the Taiping rebellion lost ground, particularly after the fall of Nanjing in 1864, former Taiping soldiers and commanders like Lai Wenguang were incorporated into Nian ranks.

After the failure of the Red Turban Rebellion (1854–1856) to capture Guangzhou, their soldiers retreated north into Jiangxi and joined forces with Shi Dakai. After the defeat of the Li Yonghe and Lan Chaoding rebellion in Sichuan, remnants combined with Taiping forces in Shaanxi. Remnant forces of the Small Swords Society uprising in Shanghai regrouped with the Taiping army.

Du Wenxiu, who led the Panthay Rebellion in Yunnan, was in contact with the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. He was not waging his rebellion against Han Chinese, instead, he was anti-Qing and he wanted to destroy the Qing government. Du&#x27;s forces led many non-Muslim forces, including Han Chinese, Li, Bai, and Hani peoples. They were assisted by non-Muslim Shan and Kachin people and other hill tribes in the revolt.

The other Muslim rebellion, the Dungan revolt, was the reverse: it was not aiming to overthrow the Qing dynasty because its leader Ma Hualong had accepted an imperial title. Instead, it erupted as a result of intersectional fighting between Muslim factions and Han Chinese. During the Dungan revolt, various groups fought against each other without any coherent goal. According to modern researchers, the Dungan rebellion began in 1862, not as a planned uprising but as a coalescence of local brawls and riots triggered by trivial causes. Among these causes were false rumors that the Hui Muslims were aiding the Taiping rebels. The Hui Ma Xiaoshi claimed that the Shaanxi Muslim rebellion was connected to the Taiping. Jonathan Spence claims that a key reason for the Taiping&#x27;s defeat was its inability to coordinate its rebellion with other rebellions.

==Policies==
The rebels announced social reforms, including strict separation of the sexes, abolition of foot binding, land socialisation, and &quot;suppression&quot; of private trade. They also outlawed the importation of opium into all Taiping territories. In regard to religion, the Kingdom replaced Confucianism, Buddhism and Chinese folk religion with the Taiping Christianity, God Worshipping, which held that Hong Xiuquan was the younger brother of Jesus and the second son of Shangdi. Buddhist libraries were burned. Because Hong saw Confucianism was a shadow of its noble origin, being now a tool of the Qing to tyrannize Han people, libraries of the Confucian monasteries were destroyed—in the Yangtze delta, almost entirely—and the temples were often defaced or turned into temples of his new religion or hospitals and libraries.

Traditionalist works like those of Confucius were burned and their sellers executed. The Taiping were especially opposed to idolatry, destroying idols wherever found with great prejudice. Though the destruction of idols was initially welcomed by foreign missionaries, missionaries eventually came to fear the zealotry of the Taiping that they had a hand in creating.

Separation of the sexes was strictly enforced in the first few years, although it tapered off in later years. Part of the extremeness came from a mistranslation of the Ten Commandments, which led to the seventh commandment also forbidding &quot;licentiousness&quot; as well as adultery. It was so severe that parents and children of the opposite sex could not interact, and even married couples were discouraged from having sex.

== Military ==

The rebels used brilliant unorthodox strategies that nearly toppled the dynasty but inspired it to adopt what one historian calls &quot;the most significant military experimentation since the seventeenth century.&quot; The Taiping army was the rebellion&#x27;s key strength. It was marked by a high level of discipline and fanaticism. They typically wore a uniform of red jackets with blue trousers, and grew their hair long so in China they were nicknamed &quot;long hair&quot;. In the beginning of the rebellion, the large numbers of women serving in the Taiping army also distinguished it from other 19th-century armies. However, after 1853 there ceased being many women in the Taiping army. Hong Xuanjiao, Su Sanniang and Qiu Ersao are examples of women who became leaders of the Taiping army&#x27;s female soldiers.

Combat was always bloody and extremely brutal, with little artillery but huge forces equipped with small arms. Both armies would attempt to push each other off of the battlefield, and though casualties were high, few battles were decisively won. The Taiping army&#x27;s main strategy of conquest was to take major cities, consolidate their hold on the cities, then march out into the surrounding countryside to recruit local farmers and battle government forces.

Estimates of the size of the Taiping army are around 500,000 soldiers in 1852. The army&#x27;s organization was allegedly inspired by that of the Qin dynasty. Each army corps consisted of roughly 13,000 men. These corps were placed into armies of varying sizes. In addition to the main Taiping forces organised along the above lines, there were also thousands of pro-Taiping groups fielding their own forces of irregulars.

The rebels were relatively well equipped with modern weapons. They were not supported by foreign governments, but they bought modern munitions—including firearms, artillery, and ammunition—from foreign suppliers. The rebels were buying weapons by 1853. Munitions—partially sourced from Western manufacturers and military stores—were smuggled into China, mainly by the English and Americans. An April 1862 shipment from an American dealer &quot;well known for their dealings with rebels&quot; included 2,783 (percussion cap) muskets, 66 carbines, 4 rifles, and 895 field artillery guns; the dealer carried passports signed by the Loyal King.

The rebels also manufactured weapons, and imported manufacturing equipment. In the summer of 1862, a Western observer noted that rebel factories in Nanjing were producing superior guns—including heavy cannon—than the Qing. The rebels augmented their modern arsenal with captured equipment. Just before his execution, Taiping Loyal King Li Xiucheng advised the Qing to buy, and to learn how to replicate, the best foreign cannon and gun carriages to prepare for war with foreign powers.

As early as 1853, foreigners from various countries joined the rebels in combat and administrative roles, and were in a position to observe the Taiping in battle. The rebels were courageous under fire, erected defensive works quickly, and used mobile pontoon bridges. One tactic was to ring a Qing emplacement in fire and kill the fleeing Qing troops as they emerged individually.

There was also a small Taiping Navy, composed of captured boats, that operated along the Yangtze and its tributaries. Among the Navy&#x27;s commanders was the Hang king Tang Zhengcai.

=== Demographics ===


Ethnically, the Taiping army was at the outset formed largely from these groups: the Hakka, a Han Chinese subgroup; the Cantonese, local residents of Guangdong; and the Zhuang (a non-Han ethnic group). It is no coincidence that Hong Xiuquan and the other Taiping royals were Hakka.

As a Han subgroup, the Hakka were frequently marginalised economically and politically, having migrated to the regions which their descendants presently inhabit only after other Han groups were already established there. For example, when the Hakka settled in Guangdong and parts of Guangxi, Yue Chinese speakers were already the dominant regional Han group there and they had been so for some time, just as speakers of various dialects of Min are locally dominant in Fujian province.

The Hakka settled throughout southern China and beyond, but as latecomers they generally had to establish their communities on rugged, less fertile land scattered on the fringes of the local majority group&#x27;s settlements. As their name (&quot;guest households&quot;) suggests, the Hakka were generally treated as migrant newcomers, and often subjected to hostility and derision from the local majority Han populations. Consequently, the Hakka, to a greater extent than other Han Chinese, have been historically associated with popular unrest and rebellion.

The other significant ethnic group in the Taiping army was the Zhuang, an indigenous people of Tai origin and China&#x27;s largest non-Han ethnic minority group. Over the centuries, Zhuang communities had been adopting Han Chinese culture. This was possible because Han culture in the region accommodates a great deal of linguistic diversity, so the Zhuang could be absorbed as if the Zhuang language were just another Han Chinese dialect, which it is not. Because Zhuang communities were integrating with the Han at different rates, a certain amount of friction between the Han and the Zhuang was inevitable, with Zhuang unrest leading to armed uprisings on occasion.

=== Social structure ===
Socially and economically, the Taiping rebels came almost exclusively from the lowest classes. Many of the southern Taiping troops were former miners, especially those coming from the Zhuang. Very few Taiping rebels, even in the leadership caste, came from the imperial bureaucracy. Almost none were landlords and in occupied territories landlords were often executed.

=== Qing forces ===

Opposing the rebellion was an imperial army with over a million regulars and unknown thousands of regional militias and foreign mercenaries operating in support. Among the imperial forces was the elite Ever Victorious Army, consisting of Chinese soldiers led by a Western officer corps (see Frederick Townsend Ward and Charles Gordon) and supplied by European arms companies like Willoughbe &amp; Ponsonby.

A particularly famous imperial force was Zeng Guofan&#x27;s Xiang Army. Zuo Zongtang from Hunan province was another important Qing general who contributed in suppressing the Taiping Rebellion. Where the armies under the control of dynasty itself were unable to defeat the Taiping, these gentry-led Yong Ying armies were able to succeed.

Although keeping accurate records was something imperial China traditionally did very well, the decentralized nature of the imperial war effort (relying on regional forces) and the fact that the war was a civil war and therefore very chaotic, meant that reliable figures are impossible to find. The destruction of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom also meant that the majority of any records it possessed were destroyed, the percentage of records said to have survived is around 10%.

Over the course of the conflict, around 90% of recruits to the Taiping side were killed or defected.

Aside from local militias, the organisation of the Qing army was:
* Eight Banners Army: 250,000 soldiers
* Green Standard Army: 611,200 soldiers in 1851
* Xiang Army (Hunan): 130,000 soldiers
* Huai Army (Anhui): 60,000–70,000 soldiers
* Chu Army: 40,000 soldiers in 1864
* Ever Victorious Army: 3,500–5,000 soldiers in 1862

== Relationship with the Western powers ==
The Taiping government maintained an ambivalent relationship with the Western powers who were active in China during this period. Due to the religious aspects of the rebellion, the Taiping government perceived Westerners as &quot;brothers and sisters from overseas&quot;. The Taiping government proved especially welcoming to Western missionaries. In 1853, Hong Xiuquan invited American missionary Issachar Jacox Roberts to come to Nanjing to aid in the administration of his government. After Roberts arrived in Nanjing in 1861 and met with Hong, he was commissioned by him as the director of foreign affairs.

While some missionaries like Roberts were enthusiastic in the first few years about the Taiping rebellion, Western skepticism existed from the inception of the rebellion. According to historian Prescott Clarke, Westerners in China became separated into two different groups in regards to their views on the rebellion, with one side depicting the rebels as mere robbers whose intention was to gather wealth through revolting against the Qing, and the other side depicting the rebel army as religious fanatics provoked by skillful leaders to fight against the Qing to the death.

The government officials of the Western powers were optimistic about the Taiping government&#x27;s chance of victory in the early stages. According to historian Eugene P. Boardman, the Qing dynasty&#x27;s enforcement of the treaty of 1842–1844 was frustrating US and British officials, especially in terms of open trade. According to Boardman the Christian nature of the Taiping opened up the possibility for a more cooperative trade partnership. Many Western officials visited the capital of Taiping between 1863 and 1864, and American commissioner Robert Milligan McLane considered granting official recognition of the Taiping government.

According to Clarke the Western missionaries changed their opinions upon further inspections of the rebellion. That change was captured in a letter from the American missionary Divie Bethune McCartee. Upon visiting Nanjing, McCartee described the situation in the city as &quot;Dreadful destruction of life.&quot; As for the actual practice of Christianity in the city, McCartee said &quot;I saw no signs of anything resembling Christianity in or near [Nanjing]&quot;. Similarly to McCartee, Hong&#x27;s director of foreign affairs I. J. Roberts wrote, &quot;His religious toleration, and multiplicity of chapels turns out to be a farce, of no avail in the spread of Christianity—worse than useless.&quot;

After the conclusion of the Second Opium War, Royal Navy officer Sir James Hope led an expedition to Nanjing in February 1861. This expedition was the largest party of Westerners to visit Taiping territories, with the inclusion of many British military personnel, entrepreneurs, missionaries, other unofficial observers and two French representatives. Upon visiting the capital, some members of the expedition wrote that &quot;devastation marked our journey&quot; in reference to the conditions in Taiping territories. Some reports suggested a great deal of indiscriminate slaughter of civilians conducted by the Taiping army in newly controlled areas.

In late 1861, Hope made a brief visit to Nanjing to come to an agreement with the Taiping rebels not to attack the city of Shanghai, a proposal which was refused by the Taiping government. According to Clarke, this refusal of cooperation and Taiping&#x27;s occupation of Ningbo in December led to the limited intervention against the rebellion by the British and French in the following years. Western assistance for the Qing was also driven by the fear that a successful rebellion would lead to a stronger China able to resist Western power.

== Total war ==

The Taiping Rebellion was a total war. Almost every citizen who had not fled the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was given military training and conscripted into the army to fight against Qing imperial forces. Under the Taiping household registration system, one adult male from each household was to be conscripted into the army.

During this conflict, both sides tried to deprive each other of the resources which they needed in order to continue the war and it became standard practice for each to destroy the opposing side&#x27;s agricultural areas, butcher the populations of cities and generally exact a brutal price from the inhabitants of captured enemy lands in order to drastically weaken the opposition&#x27;s war effort. This war was total in the sense that civilians on both sides participated in the war effort to a significant extent and the armies on both sides waged war against both the civilian population and military forces. Contemporary accounts describe the amount of desolation which befell rural areas as a result of the conflict.

In every area which they captured, the Taiping immediately exterminated the entire Manchu population. In the province of Hunan one Qing loyalist who observed the genocidal massacres which the Taiping forces committed against the Manchus wrote that the &quot;pitiful Manchus&quot;—men, women and children—were executed by the Taiping forces. The Taiping rebels were seen chanting while slaughtering the Manchus in Hefei. After capturing Nanjing, Taiping forces killed about 40,000 Manchu civilians. On 27 October 1853, they crossed the Yellow River in Cangzhou and murdered 10,000 Manchus.

Since the rebellion began in Guangxi, Qing forces allowed no rebels speaking its dialect to surrender. Reportedly in the province of Guangdong, it is written that one million were executed, because after the collapse of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Qing dynasty launched waves of massacres against the Hakkas, that at their height killed up to 30,000 each day. These policies of mass murder of civilians occurred elsewhere in China, including Anhui and Nanjing. This resulted in a massive civilian flight and death toll with some 600 towns destroyed and other bloody policies resulting.

== Legacy ==
Beyond staggering human and economic devastation, the Taiping Rebellion left changes within the late Qing dynasty. Power was, to a limited extent, decentralized, and ethnic Han Chinese officials were more widely employed in high positions than they had previously been. The traditional Manchu banner forces upon which the Qing dynasty depended failed and were gradually replaced with gentry-organized local armies. Franz H. Michael, wrote that these evolved into armies used by local warlords who dominated China after the fall of the Qing dynasty. Diana Lary, in a review-of-the-field article, cited studies that were skeptical of these claims, since the armies created to put down the Taiping operated in a different context from later regional armies.

The Taiping example of insurgent organization and its mix of Christianity and radical social equality influenced Sun Yat-sen and other future revolutionaries. Some Taiping veterans joined the Revive China Society, whose Christian members organized short-lived Heavenly Kingdom of the Great Mingshun in 1903. Although Karl Marx wrote several articles about the Taipings, he did not perceive a social program or agenda for change, only violence and destruction. Chinese Communist historians, following the lead of Mao Zedong, characterized the rebellion as a proto-communist uprising. Both Communist and Nationalist commanders studied Taiping organization and strategy during the Chinese Civil War. American General Joseph Stilwell, who commanded Chinese troops during the Second Sino-Japanese War, praised Zeng Guofan&#x27;s campaigns for combining &quot;caution with daring&quot; and &quot;initiative with perseverance.&quot;

Famine, disease, massacres, and social disruption led to a sharp decline in population, especially in the Yangtze delta. The result was a shortage in labor supply for the first time in centuries, making labor relatively more valuable than land. The Xiang Army used scorched earth tactics, refusing to take prisoners. Anhui, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Zhejiang and Northern Jiangxi were severely depopulated and had to be repopulated with migrants from Henan. The landed gentry of the Lower Yangtze region were reduced in numbers and concentration of land ownership was reduced.

The defeat of the Taiping Rebellion by military forces from Hunan led to the dramatic increase of Hunanese representation in the government, who played a role in reform efforts. By 1865, five of the eight viceroys were Hunanese. The Hunanese gentry, based on their experience with the Taiping, were more guarded against the influence of Westerners than other provinces.

Merchants in Shanxi and the Huizhou region of Anhui became less prominent because the rebellion disrupted trade in much of the country. Trade in coastal regions, especially in Guangzhou and Ningbo was less affected by violence than trade in inland areas was. Streams of refugees who entered Shanghai contributed to the economic development of the city, which was previously less commercially relevant than other cities in the area were. Only a tenth of Taiping-published records survive to this day because they were mostly destroyed by the Qing in an attempt to rewrite the history of the conflict.

Historian John King Fairbank compares the Taiping rebels with the communists under Mao Zedong who came to power a century later:
== In popular culture ==
The Taiping Rebellion has been treated in historical novels. Robert Elegant&#x27;s 1983 &quot;Mandarin&quot; depicts the time from the point of view of a Jewish family living in Shanghai. In &quot;Flashman and the Dragon&quot;, the fictional Harry Paget Flashman recounts his adventures during the Second Opium War and the Taiping Rebellion. In Lisa See&#x27;s novel &quot;Snow Flower and the Secret Fan&quot; the title character is married to a man who lives in Jintian and the characters get caught up in the action.

Amy Tan&#x27;s &quot;The Hundred Secret Senses&quot; takes place in part during the time of the Taiping Rebellion. &quot;Rebels of the Heavenly Kingdom&quot; by Katherine Paterson is a young adult novel set during the Taiping Rebellion. Li Bo&#x27;s &quot;Tienkuo: The Heavenly Kingdom&quot; takes place within the Taiping capital at Nanjing.

The war has been depicted in a few television shows and films. In 1988, a 45-episode drama series about the Taiping Rebellion called &quot;Twilight of a Nation&quot; was produced in Hong Kong by TVB. In 2000, China Central Television produced &quot;The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom&quot;, a 46-episode series about the Taiping Rebellion. &quot;The Warlords&quot; is a 2007 historical film set in the 1860s showing Gen. Pang Qinyun, leader of the Shan Regiment, as responsible for the capture of Suzhou and Nanjing.

<text>Frank Frederick Borman II (March 14, 1928 – November 7, 2023) was an American United States Air Force (USAF) colonel, aeronautical engineer, NASA astronaut, test pilot, and businessman. He was the commander of Apollo 8, the first mission to fly around the Moon, and together with crewmates Jim Lovell and William Anders, became the first of 24 humans to do so, for which he was awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.

Four days before he graduated with the West Point Class of 1950, in which he was ranked eighth out of 670, Borman was commissioned in the USAF. He qualified as a fighter pilot and served in the Philippines. He earned a Master of Science degree at Caltech in 1957, and then became an assistant professor of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics at West Point. In 1960, he was selected for Class 60-C at the USAF Experimental Flight Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California and qualified as a test pilot. On graduation, he was accepted as one of five students in the first class at the Aerospace Research Pilot School.

Borman was selected as a NASA astronaut with the second group, known as the Next Nine, in 1962. In 1966, he set a fourteen-day spaceflight endurance record as commander of Gemini 7. He served on the NASA review board which investigated the Apollo 1 fire, and then flew to the Moon with Apollo 8 in December 1968. The mission is known for the &quot;Earthrise&quot; photograph taken by Anders of the Earth rising above the lunar horizon as the Command/Service Module orbited the Moon, and for the reading from Genesis, which was televised to Earth from lunar orbit on Christmas Eve. During the Apollo 11 Moon landing mission, he was the NASA liaison at the White House, where he viewed the launch on television with President Richard Nixon.

After retiring from NASA and the Air Force in 1970, Borman became senior vice president for operations at Eastern Air Lines. He became chief executive officer of Eastern in 1975, and chairman of the board in 1976. Under his leadership, Eastern went through the four most profitable years in its history, but airline deregulation and the additional debt that it took on to purchase new aircraft led to pay cuts and layoffs, and ultimately to conflict with unions, resulting in his resignation in 1986. He moved to Las Cruces, New Mexico, where he ran a Ford dealership with his son, Fred. In 1998, they bought a cattle ranch in Bighorn, Montana.

== Early life and education ==
Frank Frederick Borman II was born on March 14, 1928, at 2162 West 11th Avenue in Gary, Indiana, the only child of Edwin Otto Borman (1901–1994), who owned an Oldsmobile car dealership there, and his wife Marjorie Ann Borman (née Pearce; 1903–1989), who named him after his paternal grandfather. He was of German descent. His great-grandfather Christopher Borman immigrated from Germany in the late 19th century and worked as a tuba player in a traveling circus. Because he suffered from numerous sinus and mastoid problems in the cold and damp weather, his family moved to the better climate of Tucson, Arizona, which Borman considered his hometown. His father bought a lease on a Mobil service station.

Borman attended Sam Hughes Elementary School in Tucson, where he played soccer and baseball. He then went to Mansfeld Junior High School, where he tried out for the football team. He was not good enough, so he formed his own team with some local boys, sponsored by a local jewelry store. He earned some money with a newspaper route, delivering copies of the &quot;Arizona Daily Star&quot;.

After Mansfeld, Borman went on to Tucson High School, where he was an honor student. He played quarterback on the junior varsity team, and then became the second-string quarterback on the varsity team. The first-string quarterback broke his arm during the first game, and was out for most of the season. Although every one of the four forward passes he attempted that year was incomplete, the team went on to win the state championship. He also started dating Susan Bugbee, a sophomore at his school.

After the United States entered World War II in 1941, his parents found work at a new Consolidated Vultee aircraft factory in Tucson. His first ride in an airplane had been when he was five years old. He learned to fly at the age of 15, taking lessons with a female instructor, Bobbie Kroll, at Gilpin Field. When he obtained his student pilot certificate, he joined a local flying club. He also built model airplanes out of balsa wood.
Borman was helping a friend build model planes, when his friend&#x27;s father asked him about his plans for the future. Borman told him that he wanted to go to college and study aeronautical engineering, but his parents did not have the money to send him to an out-of-state university, and neither the University of Arizona nor Arizona State University offered top-notch courses in aeronautical engineering at that time. His football skills were insufficient to secure an athletic scholarship, and he lacked the political connections to secure an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He therefore planned to join the Army, which would allow him to qualify for free college tuition under the G.I. Bill.

His friend&#x27;s father told him that he knew Richard F. Harless, the congressman who represented Arizona. Harless already had a principal nominee for West Point, but Borman&#x27;s friend&#x27;s father convinced Harless to list Borman as a third alternative. Borman took the West Point entrance examination, but since his chances of a West Point appointment were slim, he also took the Army physical, and passed both. But the end of the war had changed attitudes towards joining the military, and the three nominees ahead of him all dropped out. Instead of reporting to Fort MacArthur on graduation from high school, he went to West Point.

Borman entered West Point on July 1, 1946, with the Class of 1950. It was a difficult year to enter. Many members of the class were older than he, and had seen active service in World War II. Hazing by the upperclassmen was common. Another challenge was learning how to swim. He tried out for the plebe football team; his skills were insufficient, but head coach Earl Blaik took him on as an assistant manager. In his final year, Borman was a cadet captain, commanding his company, and manager of the varsity football team.

Borman chose to be commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force (USAF) on June 2, 1950. Before the United States Air Force Academy was built, the USAF was authorized to accept up to a quarter of each West Point graduating class. So that USAF officers graduating from West Point had equal seniority with those graduating from the United States Naval Academy, the entire class was commissioned four days ahead of their graduation. Borman graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree on June 6, 1950, ranked eighth in his class of 670.

Borman drove back to Tucson with his parents in his brand-new Oldsmobile 88 for the traditional sixty-day furlough after graduation. He had split up with Susan while he was at West Point, but had since reconsidered. She had earned a dental hygiene degree at the University of Pennsylvania, and was planning to commence a liberal arts degree at the University of Arizona. He persuaded her to see him again, and proposed to her. She accepted, and they were married on July 20, 1950, at St. Philip&#x27;s in the Hills Episcopal Church in Tucson.

== Air Force ==
After a brief honeymoon in Phoenix, Arizona, Borman reported to Perrin Air Force Base in Texas for basic flight training in a North American T-6 Texan in August 1950. The top students in the class had the privilege of choosing which branch of flying they would pursue; Borman elected to become a fighter pilot. He was therefore sent to Williams Air Force Base, near Phoenix, in February 1951 for advanced training, initially in the North American T-28 Trojan, and then the F-80 jet fighter. Fighter pilots were being sent to Korea, where the Korean War had broken out the year before. He asked for, and was assigned to, Luke Air Force Base near Phoenix—Susan was eight months pregnant—but at the last minute his orders were changed to Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. There, he practiced aerial bombing and gunnery. His first child, a son called Frederick Pearce, was born there in October. Borman received his pilot wings on December 4, 1951.
Soon after, Borman suffered a perforated eardrum while practicing dive bombing with a bad head cold. Instead of going to Korea, he was ordered to report to Camp Stoneman, from whence he boarded a troop transport, the on December 20, 1951, bound for the Philippines. Susan sold the Oldsmobile to buy air tickets to join him. He was assigned to the 44th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, which was based at Clark Air Base, and commanded by Major Charles McGee, a veteran fighter pilot. Initially, Borman was restricted to non-flying duties due to his eardrum; although it had healed, the base doctors feared it would rupture again if he flew. He persuaded McGee to take him for flights in a T-6, and then a Lockheed T-33, the trainer version of the Shooting Star. This convinced the doctors, and Borman&#x27;s flight status was restored on September 22, 1952. His second son, Edwin Sloan, was born at Clark in July 1952.

Borman returned to the United States, where he became a jet instrument flight instructor at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia, mainly in the T-33. In 1955, he secured a transfer to Luke Air Force Base. Most of his flying was in F-80s, F-84s, swept-wing F-84Fs and T-33s. In 1956, he received orders to join the faculty at West Point, after first completing a master&#x27;s degree in aeronautical engineering. Not wanting to spend two years qualifying for a non-flying posting that could last for another three years, he searched for a master&#x27;s degree course that took only one year, and settled on the one at the California Institute of Technology. He received his Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering in June 1957, and then became an assistant professor of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics at West Point, where he served until 1960. He found he enjoyed teaching, and was still able to fly a T-33 from Stewart Air Force Base on weekends. One summer he also attended the USAF Survival School at Stead Air Force Base in Nevada.

In June 1960, Borman was selected for Class 60-C at the USAF Experimental Flight Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California, and became a test pilot. His class, which included Michael Collins and James B. Irwin, who also later became astronauts, graduated on April 21, 1961. Thomas P. Stafford, another future astronaut, was one of the instructors. On graduation, Borman was accepted as one of five students in the first class at the Aerospace Research Pilot School, a postgraduate school for test pilots to prepare them to become astronauts. Fellow members of the class included future astronaut Jim McDivitt. Classes included a course on orbital mechanics at the University of Michigan, and there were zero-G flights in modified Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker and Convair C-131 Samaritan aircraft. Borman introduced training with the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. It would be flown up to , where the engine would cut out for lack of oxygen, and then coast up to . This would be followed by a powerless descent, and restarting the engine on the way down. A pressure suit was required.

On April 18, 1962, NASA formally announced that it was accepting applications for a new group of astronauts who would assist the Mercury Seven astronauts selected in 1959 with Project Mercury, and join them in flying Project Gemini missions. The USAF conducted its own internal selection process, and submitted the names of eleven candidates. It ran them through a brief training course in May 1962 on how to speak and conduct themselves during the NASA selection process. The candidates called it a &quot;charm school&quot;. Borman&#x27;s selection as one of the Next Nine was publicly announced on September 17, 1962. Chuck Yeager, the commandant of the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards, told him: &quot;you can kiss your godamned Air Force career goodbye.&quot; During his Air Force service, Borman logged 3,600 hours of flying time, of which 3,000 was in jet aircraft.

== NASA ==
Borman moved with his family to Houston, Texas, where the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) was still being established, and signed his first home construction contract, for $26,500 (). Following the precedent set by the Mercury Seven, each of the Nine was assigned a special area in which to develop expertise that could be shared with the others, and to provide astronaut input to the designers and engineers. Borman&#x27;s assignment was the Titan II booster used by Project Gemini, although he had no experience in that area. The assignment involved many trips to the Martin Marietta plants in Denver, Colorado, and Baltimore, Maryland, where the Titan IIs were built. His responsibility included the Emergency Detection System (EDS) developed for an abort situation. Borman agreed with Wernher von Braun that reliance would have to be placed on automated systems in situations where human reaction time would not be fast enough. This was much to the consternation of old hands like Warren J. North, the NASA Chief of the Flight Crew Support Division, who did not accept the notion that an automated system was superior to the skill of a human being.

There was also classroom work. Initially, each of the astronauts was given four months of classroom instruction on subjects such as spacecraft propulsion, orbital mechanics, astronomy, computing, and space medicine. There was also familiarization with the Gemini spacecraft, Titan II and Atlas boosters, and the Agena target vehicle. Jungle survival training was conducted at the USAF Tropic Survival School at Albrook Air Force Station in Panama, desert survival training at Stead Air Force Base in Nevada, and water survival training on the Dilbert Dunker at the Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida and on Galveston Bay. There were fifty hours of instruction in geology, with field trips to the Grand Canyon and Meteor Crater in Arizona. Borman thought it was a waste of time. &quot;I didn&#x27;t care about picking up rocks,&quot; he later told an interviewer, &quot;I wanted to beat the Soviets to the Moon&quot;.

=== Project Gemini ===
When the Chief of the Flight Crew Operations, Mercury Seven astronaut Deke Slayton, drew up a tentative schedule of Project Gemini flights, he assigned Mercury Seven astronaut Alan Shepard command of the first crewed flight, Gemini 3, with Next Nine astronaut Tom Stafford as his co-pilot. Mercury Seven astronaut Gus Grissom would command the backup crew, with Borman as his co-pilot. Under the crew rotation system Slayton devised, the backup crew of one mission would become the prime of the third mission after. Borman would therefore become the co-pilot of Gemini 6, which was planned as a long-duration fourteen-day mission.

An Apollo mission to the Moon was expected to take at least a week, so one of the objectives of Project Gemini was to test the ability of the crew and spacecraft components to operate in space for that length of time. When Shepard was grounded in October 1963, Grissom and Borman became the prime crew of Gemini 3. Grissom invited Borman to his house to talk to him about the mission, and after a long discussion, decided that he could not work with Borman. According to Gene Cernan, &quot;the egos of Grissom and Borman were too big to fit into a single spacecraft&quot;. Slayton therefore replaced Borman with John Young.

Slayton still wanted Borman for the two-week flight, which had now slipped to Gemini 7, so Borman was assigned as backup commander of Gemini 4, with Jim Lovell as his co-pilot. This was officially announced on July 27, 1964, and their assignment to Gemini 7 followed on July 1, 1965, with Ed White and Michael Collins as their backups. Borman was one of four members of his group chosen to command their first missions, the others being McDivitt, Neil Armstrong, and Elliot See, although See was killed in a jet crash three months before his mission. Prime and backup crews trained for the mission together, and Borman found the experience as a backup valuable, amounting to a dress rehearsal of their own mission.
That Gemini 7 would last for fourteen days was known from the beginning, and gave Borman time to prepare. To keep fit, he and Lovell jogged a day, and played handball after work. They visited the McDonnell Aircraft plant in St. Louis, Missouri, where their spacecraft was built. At , it was heavier than any previous Gemini spacecraft. Special procedures were developed for the stowage of consumables and garbage. A lightweight space suit was developed to make the astronauts more comfortable.

A major change affecting the mission occurred when the Agena target vehicle for Gemini 6 suffered a catastrophic failure. This mission was intended to practice orbital rendezvous, a requirement of Project Apollo and therefore an objective of Project Gemini. Borman was at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to observe the launch of Gemini 6, and heard two McDonnell officials, spacecraft chief Walter Burke and his deputy, John Yardley, discuss the possibility of using Gemini 7 as a rendezvous target. Borman rejected the idea of docking the two spacecraft, but otherwise thought the idea had merit.

After some discussion about how it could be accomplished, it was approved. The 6555th Aerospace Test Wing dismantled Gemini 6 and assembled Gemini 7 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 19. Gemini 7 was launched at 14:30 local time on December 6, 1965. Then the race was on to launch Gemini 6 with Wally Schirra and Tom Stafford on board, which was accomplished at 08:37 local time on December 15. Gemini 6 completed the rendezvous with Gemini 7 at 14:33. The two craft came within of each other. At one point Schirra held up a sign in the window for Borman to read that said: &quot;Beat Army&quot;. Schirra, Stafford and Lovell were all United States Naval Academy graduates; Borman was outnumbered.
When Schirra and Stafford pulled away and returned to Earth, Borman and Lovell still had three days to go, in a space the size of the front seat of a small car. Borman began hoping that something would go wrong and excuse an early return. Finally, on December 18, it was time to return. The two astronauts were pumped up with the help of the stimulant dexedrine. The re-entry was accomplished flawlessly, and the Gemini 7 spacecraft splashed down from the recovery vessel, the aircraft carrier . Borman had never been on an aircraft carrier before, and was awed by its size. Borman was awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal for this mission, and was promoted to colonel. At 37, he was the youngest full colonel in the Air Force.

=== Project Apollo ===
==== Apollo 1 ====

In planning for Project Apollo, Slayton designated new crews under the command of the experienced astronauts who commanded the early Gemini missions. On missions with a lunar module, the senior pilot (later known as the command module pilot) would also be an experienced astronaut, as he would have to fly the command module solo. Borman was given the assignment of backup for the second mission, an Earth-orbital mission without a lunar module. He would then command the fourth, a medium Earth orbit mission with a lunar module. He was given Charles Bassett for a senior pilot and Bill Anders as the pilot (later known as the lunar module pilot); Bassett was expected to fly on Gemini 9, but he died in the air crash that also killed See. Borman was then given Stafford as senior pilot and Collins as pilot. Subsequently, Stafford was given his own crew, and Anders was reassigned to Borman&#x27;s crew. As Collins had spaceflight experience on Gemini 10, he became the senior pilot. The second mission was scrubbed, but Borman&#x27;s remained unchanged, although now it was to be the third mission, and he had no backup responsibility. The crew selection was officially announced in a NASA press release on December 22, 1966.
On January 27, 1967, the crew members of the first crewed Apollo mission (Apollo 1 — then designated AS-204), Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger B. Chaffee, were killed in a fire aboard their command module. Following this deadly accident, the AS-204 Accident Review Board was charged with investigating the root causes of the fire and recommending corrective measures. Borman was chosen as the only astronaut to serve on the nine-member review board. He inspected the burnt-out command module and verified the positions of the switches and circuit breakers. In April 1967, while serving on the board, Borman was one of five astronauts who testified before the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate committees investigating the Apollo 1 fire (the others were Shepard, Schirra, Slayton and McDivitt). Borman faced tough and sometimes hostile questioning. Borman&#x27;s testimony helped convince Congress that Apollo would be safe to fly again. He told them: &quot;We are trying to tell you that we are confident in our management, and in our engineering and in ourselves. I think the question is really: Are you confident in us?&quot;

In the aftermath of the disaster, Joe Shea resigned as manager of the Apollo project. Robert Gilruth, the director of the MSC, offered the position to Borman, who turned it down. The job was given to Gilruth&#x27;s deputy, George Low; Borman accepted a temporary posting to the North American Aviation plant in Downey, California, where the command modules were made, to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the AS-204 Accident Review Board. Borman was forced to confront one of the root causes of the disaster: the natural tension between getting the job done on time and building the spacecraft as well as possible.

Borman argued with test pilot Scott Crossfield, who was in charge of safety engineering at North American, over the design of an effective emergency oxygen system. Borman refused to accept the design because it did not protect the crew from noxious fumes. Crossfield then opposed the delivery of North American&#x27;s S-II, the second stage of the Saturn V Moon rocket, which Crossfield deemed unsafe. Borman informed management at North American that he could not work with Crossfield, and Crossfield eventually left the company. A redesigned hatch that allowed the astronauts to exit within seconds instead of minutes added to the weight of the spacecraft. The parachutes had to be redesigned to ensure they could hold the additional weight, and re-testing them cost $250,000. This led to a clash with George Mueller, who thought the cost was excessive.

==== Apollo 8 ====
Borman&#x27;s medium Earth orbit lunar module test mission was now planned as Apollo 9, and tentatively scheduled for early 1969, after a low Earth orbit one commanded by McDivitt in December 1968. The crew assignments were officially announced on November 20, 1967, but in July 1968 Collins suffered a cervical disc herniation that required surgery to repair. He was replaced by Lovell in July 1968, reuniting Borman with his Gemini 7 crewmate. When Apollo 8&#x27;s LM-3 arrived at the KSC in June 1968, more than a hundred significant defects were discovered, leading Gilruth to conclude that there was no prospect of LM-3 being ready to fly in 1968.

In August 1968, in response to a report from the CIA that the Soviet Union were considering a lunar fly-by before the end of the year, Low proposed a bold solution to keep the Apollo program on track. Since the next Command/Service Module (CSM) (designated as &quot;CSM-103&quot;) would be ready three months before LM-3, a CSM-only mission could be flown in December 1968. Instead of repeating the flight of Apollo 7, it could be sent to the Moon, entering lunar orbit before returning to Earth. This also meant that the medium Earth orbit mission could be dispensed with, keeping to the schedule for a lunar landing in mid-1969. With the change in mission for Apollo 8, Slayton asked McDivitt if he still wanted to fly it. McDivitt turned it down; his crew had spent a great deal of time preparing to test the LM, and that was what he still wanted to do. When Borman was asked the same question, he answered &quot;yes&quot; without any hesitation. Slayton then decided to swap the crews and spacecraft of the Apollo 8 and 9 missions.
Apollo 8 was launched at 12:51:00 UTC (07:51:00 Eastern Standard Time) on December 21, 1968. On the second day Borman awoke feeling ill. He vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea; this left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces, which the crew cleaned up as best they could. Borman did not want anyone to know about his medical problems, but Lovell and Anders wanted to inform Mission Control. The Apollo 8 crew and Mission Control medical personnel concluded that there was little to worry about and that Borman&#x27;s illness was either a 24-hour flu, as Borman thought, or an adverse reaction to a sleeping pill. Researchers now believe that he was suffering from space adaptation syndrome, which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their vestibular system adapts to weightlessness. Space adaptation syndrome had not occurred on Mercury and Gemini missions because those astronauts could not move freely in the small cabins of those spacecraft. The increased cabin space in the Apollo command module afforded astronauts greater freedom of movement, contributing to symptoms of space sickness.

On December 24, Apollo 8 went into lunar orbit. The crew made ten orbits of the Moon in twenty hours before returning to Earth. The mission is known for the &quot;Earthrise&quot; photograph taken by Bill Anders of the Earth rising above the lunar horizon as the command module orbited the Moon, and for the televised reading from Genesis in lunar orbit, released for worldwide broadcast. About six weeks before the launch, NASA&#x27;s deputy director for public affairs, Julian Scheer, had told Borman that a television broadcast was scheduled for this time, and suggested that they find something appropriate to say. Borman had consulted with Simon Bourgin, who worked at the United States Information Agency, and had accompanied Borman and Lovell on a goodwill tour of the Far East after the Gemini 7 mission. Bourgin, in turn, consulted Joe Laitin, a former United Press International reporter, who suggested that the Apollo 8 crew read from the Book of Genesis after his wife Christine had come up with the idea. The text was transcribed onto fireproof paper for the broadcast. &quot;One of the things that was truly historic&quot;, Borman later joked, &quot;was that we got that good Catholic Bill Anders to read from the King James Version of the bible.&quot;
The Apollo 8 spacecraft splashed down in darkness at 10:51:42 UTC (05:51:42 EST) on Friday, December 27. Borman had argued for this; a daylight landing would have required orbiting the Moon at least twelve times, and Borman did not think this was necessary. When the spacecraft hit the water, Borman did not flick the switch to release the parachutes quickly enough. They dragged the spacecraft over and left it upside down. In this position, the flashing light beacon could not be seen by the recovery helicopters. Borman inflated the bags in the nose of the spacecraft, which then righted itself. Mission ground rules required a daylight recovery, so the crew had to wait 45 minutes until local sunrise before the frogmen could open the hatches. Borman became seasick and threw up, and was glad when he could be taken on board the recovery ship, the aircraft carrier .

Apollo 8 came at the end of 1968, a year that had seen much upheaval in the United States and most of the world. They were the first human beings to orbit another celestial body, having survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as having only a fifty-fifty chance of fully succeeding. The effect of Apollo 8 was summed up in a telegram from a stranger, received by Borman after the mission, that stated simply, &quot;Thank you Apollo 8. You saved 1968.&quot;

The crew were accorded ticker tape parades in New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C., where they were awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, which was presented by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Borman was also awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal. Afterward, Borman was sent on a goodwill tour of Europe, with a secondary objective of finding out more about the space programs of other NATO countries. He was accompanied by Bourgin and Nicholas Ruwe, the assistant chief of protocol at the State Department. Borman met with Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip and a teenage Princess Anne at Buckingham Palace in the UK, with President Charles de Gaulle in France, Pope Paul VI in Rome, and King Baudouin and Queen Fabiola of Belgium.

==== Apollo 11 ====

Space journalist Andrew Chaikin claims that, following the death of Gus Grissom, Borman became Slayton&#x27;s choice to command the first Moon landing attempt. In the fall of 1968, Slayton offered command of the first landing to Borman, who turned it down. Long before Apollo 8 lifted off, Borman had decided that it would be his last flight, and that he would retire in 1970. After twenty years&#x27; service in the Air Force, he would qualify for a pension. Borman told an interviewer in 1999 that &quot;my reason for joining NASA was to participate in the Apollo Program, the lunar program, and hopefully beat the Russians. I never looked at it for any individual goals. I never wanted to be the first person on the Moon and frankly, as far as I was concerned, when Apollo 11 was over the mission was over. The rest was frosting on the cake.&quot;

For the Apollo 11 Moon landing mission in July 1969, Borman was assigned as NASA liaison to President Richard Nixon at the White House. He viewed the launch from the President&#x27;s office. Nixon initially had prepared a long speech to read to the astronauts on the Moon during a phone call, but Borman persuaded him to keep his words brief and non-partisan. He also convinced the President to omit the playing of the &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot;, which would have required the astronauts to waste two and a half minutes of their time on the surface standing still. He accompanied the President in Marine One, when it flew to the recovery ship, the aircraft carrier to meet the crew of Apollo 11 on their return.

====Other military activities====
In June 1970, Borman retired from NASA and the U.S. Air Force as a colonel. He later cited family stress as a major reason for leaving the astronaut corps, in particular his wife&#x27;s alcohol dependency. For his services as an astronaut, the Air Force awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Legion of Merit.

In August 1970, he undertook another special presidential mission, a worldwide tour to seek support for the release of American prisoners of war held by North Vietnam. At the conclusion of his 25-day mission to 25 countries, Borman briefed Nixon on September 1 at the Western White House in San Clemente, California. While the mission was not an abject failure, his fame failed to compensate for his lack of political experience and gravitas. On September 22, he appeared before an unusual joint meeting of Congress conducted at the request of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia in his capacity as presidential envoy. He noted that the POWs were being treated poorly, and urged Congress &quot;not to forsake your countrymen who have given so much for you.&quot;

Borman performed one more assignment for the military. In 1976, there was a major cheating scandal at West Point. Faculty noticed remarkably similar answers to an examination paper for Electrical Engineering 304, a required course, that had been given to over 800 cadets to complete on their own. Cheating was a violation of the Cadet Honor Code, and cheaters were subject to expulsion. Cadets were tried by 12-member honor boards of cadets that functioned as grand juries; but the system was prone to abuse, and those cleared on appeal to the five‐member appeal boards of officers that functioned as courts were often punished with &quot;silence&quot;, a form of shunning. Borman was appointed to head a special commission to investigate and report to the Secretary of the Army. Eventually, 92 cadets were readmitted, and graduated with the Class of 1978; more than 60 others declined the offer of amnesty, and chose to complete their education elsewhere.

Borman&#x27;s son Frederick, of the West Point Class of 1974, was accused of taking a bribe. It was alleged that while a member of a cadet honor code board he had accepted a $1,200 payment to fix a case involving two cadets accused of cheating. Frederick was cleared of all charges after taking a polygraph test. Borman&#x27;s younger son, Edwin, of the West Point Class of 1975, was also accused of improprieties, but there was no evidence to support the allegations, and they were dismissed.

== Eastern Air Lines ==
In early 1969, Borman became a special advisor to Eastern Air Lines. The following year he completed Harvard Business School&#x27;s six-week Advanced Management Program. He joined Eastern Air Lines on July 1, 1970, and moved to Miami. In December he became its senior vice president for operations. On the evening of December 29, 1972, Borman received a phone call informing him that Eastern Air Lines Flight 401 had disappeared off the radar near Florida&#x27;s Everglades. He took a helicopter, which was able to land in the darkness from the crash site, and waded waist-deep through the murky swamp, helping rescue crash victims and load survivors into rescue helicopters.
The accident put the spotlight on the airline&#x27;s Lockheed L-1011 TriStar aircraft, which suffered from maintenance problems, particularly with the turbine blades of the Rolls-Royce RB211 engine. This made it difficult to fly them at a profit. The airline also had 25 Boeing 727-100QC aircraft capable of being quickly changed from passenger to cargo aircraft. These weighed more than the airline&#x27;s standard 727-100s, and therefore consumed more fuel, which made them only marginally profitable when fuel prices were low, but jet fuel prices quadrupled in the 1970s. Eastern also spent $200,000 on a down payment for two Concordes, although it had no suitable routes to fly them on.

Borman was promoted to executive vice president-general operations manager and was elected to Eastern&#x27;s board of directors in July 1974. In May 1975, he was elected president and chief operating officer by the board. He was named chief executive officer of Eastern in December 1975, and became chairman of the board in December 1976. Borman disliked aspects of American corporate culture, such as plush offices, luxury Cadillac and Mercedes company cars and a Lockheed JetStar corporate jet for executives, while firing or furloughing employees. After he became Eastern&#x27;s CEO, he saved the company $9 million annually in salaries by firing 81 middle managers and 31 vice presidents. He drove to work in a second-hand Chevrolet Camaro with an engine he rebuilt himself. He sold the JetStar, and, as at North American, banned drinking on company time, which he considered also included lunchtime. The end of the three-martini lunch came as a shock to many executives.

Eastern had not turned a profit since 1969. To reduce costs, Borman convinced employees to accept a wage freeze in 1976, with an eight percent raise in 1977, and then a five-year Variable Earnings Program (VEP). Under the VEP, employees contributed 3.5 percent of their annual salaries to a special profit insurance fund. If Eastern did not achieve a two percent return on each revenue dollar, the fund was used to make up the difference. If the company did earn more than two percent, the excess money was returned to the employees, who could earn back up to twice their contributions. To get his changes through, Borman visited the airline&#x27;s facilities in 28 states to bring his proposals to his employees.

With the VEP in hand, Borman was able to refinance the debt on the company&#x27;s 254 aircraft. Profits jumped to a record $67.3 million in 1978. During this time, the employees received double their VEP payments. Borman ordered $1.4 billion worth of new, more fuel-efficient aircraft, and the company&#x27;s debt ballooned to $2.3 billion. But 1979 was the last profitable year until 1985. In the intervening five years, Eastern ran at a loss, accumulating $380 million in losses. The company&#x27;s debt-to-equity ratio stood at 8:1, and servicing the debt required $235 million annually in interest payments, representing about cents in every dollar earned.

The cause of the decline in profitability was only partly due to the company&#x27;s debt; there was also airline deregulation in 1978, which caused the number of airlines in the United States to increase from 30 to nearly 100. Some of the newcomers offered unprofitable and unsustainable low prices to gain market share. In just the first three-quarters of 1984, Eastern lost $128 million. Borman negotiated an agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) for a 22 percent pay cut, while the International Association of Machinists (IAM) and the Transport Workers Union (TWU) (representing the flight attendants) accepted an 18 percent cut. Employees were nominally compensated with grants of company stock, but its value declined from $60 a share in 1966 to $6 a share in 1983.

Eastern posted a profit of $6.3 million on gross revenues of $4 billion in 1984, but this was not enough to satisfy the creditors, who demanded a two percent profit. Borman laid off 1,000 flight attendants and cut the pay of 6,000 more by over 20 percent. He also slashed the pay of executives and middle managers by 20 to 25 percent. In the first quarter of 1985, earnings were up to $24.3 million, 35 cents a share, after setting aside $28.9 million for the employees. It was the third consecutive profitable quarter in a row. Borman attempted to negotiate further cuts with the unions, threatening bankruptcy. The ALPA and TWU accepted, but the IAM did not. Over ten years, the three unions had given up $836 million in wages and benefits, and the company had little to show for it. Charlie Bryan, the head of the IAM, said that the union would accept the deal only if Borman resigned. In response, Eastern&#x27;s board decided to sell the airline to Texas Air Corporation, headed by Frank Lorenzo. Borman resigned from Eastern in June 1986. It was a personal defeat, but hardly a personal financial disaster; he received a severance payment of $900,000, and drew a consultant&#x27;s fee of $150,000 a year from it until 1991.

Borman served on the South African Board of Inquiry into the 1986 aircraft crash that killed Mozambican president Samora Machel.

== Retirement ==

Borman and Susan left Miami, and moved to Las Cruces, New Mexico. For a time, he was the majority owner of a Las Cruces Ford dealership founded by his son, Fred. He was a member of the boards of directors of Home Depot, National Geographic, Outboard Marine Corporation, Automotive Financial Group, Thermo Instrument Systems and American Superconductor. He was CEO of Patlex Corporation, a small company that held patents in lasers, from July 1988 to August 1996. That year, he published an autobiography, &quot;Countdown&quot;, co-written with Robert J. Serling.

In 1998, Borman purchased a cattle ranch in the Bighorn Mountains of southern Montana, running 4,000 head of cattle on . In addition to tending cattle, Borman continued his hobbies in rebuilding and modeling aircraft. Notably, he owned and painstakingly rebuilt a very rare World War II single-engine fighter, the Bell P-63 Kingcobra. It won the prestigious Grand Champion Warbird award when Borman exhibited it at Oshkosh in 1998. He also personally flew it in airshows. He was a member of the Society of Antique Modelers (SAM). In 1998, he moved to Billings, Montana. His wife Susan suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and he spent much of his time caring for her. Eventually she was placed in a nursing home, where he visited her each day, until her death on September 7, 2021.

Following John Glenn&#x27;s death in December 2016, Borman became the oldest living American astronaut. He was eleven days older than his Apollo 8 crewmate, Jim Lovell. Both celebrated their 90th birthdays in March 2018. Borman gave the commencement address to the University of Arizona&#x27;s 2008 graduating class, and was reunited with Lovell and Anders for celebrations of the 50th anniversary of Apollo 8 in December 2018 at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, where the spacecraft in which they orbited the Moon is on display. &quot;I have never said it before publicly&quot;, declared Borman, &quot;but these two talented guys, I&#x27;m just proud that I was able to fly with them. It was a tough job done in four months, and we did a good job.&quot;

Borman died from a stroke at the Billings Clinic on November 7, 2023, at the age of 95.

==Character and views==
Borman was once described by a NASA psychiatrist as the least complicated man he had ever met. In his business career he was described as autocratic. He had a Tolstoy quotation on a wall in his office: &quot;The only legitimate happiness is honest hard work and the surmounting of obstacles.&quot;

== Awards and honors ==

Borman, along with his Gemini 7 crewmate Lovell and the Gemini 6 crew, received the 1965 Harmon Trophy. He and Lovell were awarded the trophy a second time for the Apollo 8 mission in 1968. The Apollo 8 crew was also awarded the Robert J. Collier Trophy for &quot;achievement in astronautics&quot;. Former deputy administrator of NASA and then Secretary of the Air Force Robert Seamans Jr. awarded them the General Thomas D. White USAF Space Trophy at the National Geographic Society, and Vice President Spiro Agnew presented them with the society&#x27;s Hubbard Medal. &quot;Time&quot; magazine chose the crew of Apollo 8 as its Men of the Year for 1968, recognizing them as the people who most influenced events in the year, and they were featured on the January 3, 1969, cover. Jim Lovell accepted the Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy for space achievement from President Richard Nixon on behalf of the Apollo 8 crew. On October 1, 1978, Borman was awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor for his command of Apollo 8.

Borman, who built model airplanes throughout much of his life, was awarded the Academy of Model Aeronautics Distinguished Service Award in 1968. Borman, along with other recipients such as baseball player Mickey Mantle and actress Polly Bergen, was awarded the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1969. Borman received the honor for the science and exploration category. He was also awarded the Society of Experimental Test Pilots James H. Doolittle Award in 1976, the Tony Jannus Award in 1986, the Airport Operators Council International Downes Award in 1990, and the NASA Ambassador of Exploration Award in 2012. He was awarded honorary doctorates from Whittier College, the University of Arizona, South Dakota School of Mines, Illinois Wesleyan University, the University of Pittsburgh, Indiana University, Arizona State University, Clarkson University, Hope College, and the Air University.

Borman was one of ten Gemini astronauts inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1982. He and Senator Barry Goldwater were two of four individuals inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1982. In 1990, Borman was selected for the Arizona Aviation Hall of Fame&#x27;s inaugural class. He was among the second class that was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1993. He was also inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame in 1990 and the DeMolay International Hall of Fame.

== In media ==
In &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, a 1998 HBO miniseries, Borman was played by David Andrews. He was interviewed in the 2008 Discovery Channel documentary &quot;When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions&quot;, and appeared in the 2005 documentary &quot;Race to the Moon&quot;, which was shown as part of the PBS &quot;American Experience&quot; series. The film centered on the events that led up to the Apollo 8 mission. On November 13, 2008, Borman, Lovell and Anders appeared on the NASA TV channel to discuss Apollo 8 on the 40th anniversary of the mission. Borman was featured on Episode 655 of the radio program &quot;This American Life&quot; titled &quot;The Not-So-Great Unknown&quot;, airing on August 24, 2018; his interview with David Kestenbaum in Act One of the episode titled &quot;So Over the Moon&quot; centered on his unconventional outlook towards space travel. Borman&#x27;s face was used on the cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s second album.

<text>Walloon Brabant ( ; ; ) is a province located in Belgium&#x27;s French-speaking region of Wallonia. It borders on (clockwise from the North) the province of Flemish Brabant (Flemish Region) and the provinces of Liège, Namur and Hainaut. Walloon Brabant&#x27;s capital and largest city is Wavre.

The provincial population was recorded at about 414,000 as of January 2024, and an area of 1,097 square kilometres (424 sq mi).

==Etymology==
Walloon is a Belgian version of an old West Germanic word reconstructed as *walh (“foreigner, stranger, speaker of Celtic or Latin”). Brabant is from Old Dutch *brākbant (attested in Medieval Latin as pāgus brācbatensis, Bracbantum, Bracbantia), from Frankish, a compound of Proto-Germanic *brēk-, *brekaną (“fallow, originally &#x27;to break&#x27;”) + *bant-, *bantō, *banti (“district, region”)

Like the terms &quot;Belgium&quot; and &quot;Flanders&quot;, the terms &quot;Walloon&quot; and &quot;Brabant&quot; are much older than the modern political entities which they represent today, but were already being used in the region when political boundaries were different. For example, Louis de Haynin wrote as follows in 1628:
:The Belgian [region (&quot;contrée&quot; or &quot;province&quot;)] is a large country (&quot;pays&quot;) between France, Germany and the North Sea. This country is typically divided into two regions [&quot;régions&quot;] which are about equal, which is to say, Belgian Wallonia and Belgian, or according to some, Flemish Germany [&quot;belge wallonne et belge allemagne ou flamande, selons aucun&quot;].&quot;

De Haynin noted that the distinction people made in his time between Walloon and German or Flemish Belgium was apparently based upon language, with the Walloons speaking French, and the others speaking what he described as a type of Low German (&quot;un bas alleman&quot;) which people, especially foreigners, referred to as Flemish. Among the provinces within these two large Belgian regions he contrasted &quot;French or Walloon Flanders&quot;, now largely within France, with the rest of &quot;Flanders&quot;, and &quot;Lothier or Walloon Brabant (&quot;brabant wallon&quot;)&quot; with the larger &quot;German or Flemish&quot; part of Brabant, which at that time stretched into what is now the Netherlands. Note that for de Haynin and his contemporaries &quot;Belgium&quot; was much larger than modern Belgium, corresponding to the old Burgundian Netherlands and its associated church-ruled principalities. &quot;Belgium&quot; therefore included all of the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and a part of France. In contrast, the term &quot;Flanders&quot; could be used for a smaller region than today, equivalent to the region once dominated by the County of Flanders, near the north sea. As already noted, de Haynin himself used the adjective &quot;Flemish&quot; to refer to the Dutch language, including dialects outside the old Flemish region, but he noted that the term &quot;Flemish&quot; was now being used to cover a bigger area than it originally applied to, because of the prestige of the old medieval county, which was also well-known to foreigners.

== History ==
The Battle of Waterloo took place in this province in June 1815.

Walloon Brabant was created in 1995 when the former Province of Brabant was split into three parts: two new provinces, Walloon Brabant and Flemish Brabant; and the Brussels Capital Region, which no longer belongs to any province. The split was made to accommodate the federalisation of Belgium in three regions (Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels).

==Subdivisions==

It has an area of and contains only one administrative district (&quot;arrondissement&quot; in French), the arrondissement of Nivelles, with 27 municipalities.

Nivelles District:

==Economy==
The regional Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 19.3 billion € in 2018, accounting for only 4.2% of Belgium&#x27;s economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €42,300 in the same year, equivalent to 140% of the EU27 average. GDP per person employed was still higher, at 157% of the EU27 average. Compared to other Belgian provinces, Walloon Brabant is thus relatively small, but it is the wealthiest. The other four Walloon provinces to Brabant&#x27;s south all have a significantly lower GDP per capita, none being above €30,000 in 2018. This wealth is at least partly due to the economy of the neighbouring capital city region of Brussels, which is not a province, because many residents of Walloon Brabant are employed there. For comparison, Brussels had a GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power of €61,300, equivalent to 203% of the EU average, but unlike Walloon Brabant it is significantly lower, at 161%, when calculated per person employed.

Historically the greater Walloon region was one of the earliest regions of industrialization, mainly concentrated in the so-called &quot;Sillon industriel&quot;, which is to the south of Walloon Brabant. There was also steel production in Clabecq in Walloon Brabant, which is still operating. The Ronquières inclined plane on the Brussels-Charleroi Canal which passes through the province, connects canal traffic between Charleroi, one of the main cities of the &quot;Sillon industriel&quot;, with Brussels and the Port of Antwerp, to the north of Walloon Brabant.

Today, the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) is located in Walloon Brabant. The Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park is developing cooperation between industry and UCLouvain and is contributing to regional economic development. It covers 231 hectares spread over the area of the town of Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve and the municipality of Mont-Saint-Guibert (30 km away from Brussels). The main areas of activity are life sciences, fine chemistry, information technologies and engineering. The park is made up of 135 innovative companies, 4,500 employees, and the university&#x27;s business incubator.

Piétrain is a breed of domestic pig taking its name from &quot;Piétrain&quot;, a little village of Jodoigne in Walloon Brabant.

The most important town of this province is Nivelles, which has the Collegiate Church of Saint Gertrude and its westwork.

In Rixensart, the company Recherche et Industrie Thérapeutiques (changed to &quot;GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals&quot; in 2000) is one of the world&#x27;s leading vaccine manufacturers, supplying around 25% of the world&#x27;s vaccines: GSK Biologicals employs a little over 5,300 persons on the Walloon sites of Rixensart, Wavre and Gembloux. The company distributes 36 doses of vaccines every second.

The castle of &quot;Corroy-le-Château&quot;, one of the best conserved castles of this period in Northern Europe was bought by 21st-century Flemish artist Wim Delvoye for EUR 3.3 million. He is planning to convert the Corroy-le-Château into a museum of modern art.

<doc id="80899" wikidata="Q189503" url="?curid=80899" title="Place de la Concorde">
<text>The Place de la Concorde (; ) is a public square in Paris, France. Measuring in area, it is the largest square in the French capital. It is located in the city&#x27;s eighth arrondissement, at the eastern end of the Champs-Élysées.

It was the site of many notable public executions, including those of the Carmelite Martyrs of Compiegne, Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and Maximilien Robespierre in the course of the French Revolution, during which the square was temporarily renamed the Place de la Révolution (&#x27;Revolution Square&#x27;). It received its current name in 1795 as a gesture of reconciliation in the later years of the revolution. A metro station is located at the northeastern corner of Place de la Concorde on Lines 1, 8, and 12 of the Paris Métro.

== History ==
=== Design and construction ===
The square was originally designed to be the site of an equestrian statue of King Louis XV, commissioned in 1748 by the merchants of Paris, to celebrate the recovery of King Louis XV from a serious illness. The site chosen for the statue was the large esplanade, or space between the revolving gate, the Tuileries Garden and the Cour-la-Reine, a popular lane for horseback riding at the edge of the city. At the time, the Concorde bridge and the Rue de Rivoli did not exist, and the Rue Royale was a muddy lane that descended down to a marsh beside the Seine.

The architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel made a plan for the site and the square was finished by 1772. It was in the form of an octagon, bordered by a sort of moat twenty meters wide, crossed by stone bridges, and surrounded by a stone balustrade. At the eight corners Gabriel placed stone stairways to descend into the square, which was divided into flowerbeds. In the center of the gardens was the pedestal on which the statue stood. The statue, by Edmé Bouchardon, depicted the King on horseback as the victor of the Battle of Fontenoy, dressed as a Roman general, with a laurel wreath on his head. On the four corners of the pedestal, designed by Jean Chalgrin, are bronze statues by Jean-Baptiste Pigalle, depicting the virtues of great monarchs; Force, Justice, Prudence, and Peace.

The statue was dedicated on 20 June 1763, but by this time the King had lost much of his popularity. A few days after its dedication, someone hung a placard on the statue, proclaiming: &quot;Oh, the beautiful statue! Oh, the fine pedestal! The Virtues are under the feet, and Vice is in the saddle!&quot;

On the north side of the square, between 1760 and 1775, Gabriel planned and built two palatial buildings with identical façades. The classical façades were inspired by those created by Claude Perrault, the royal architect, for the façade of the Louvre. They were originally intended to be occupied by embassies, but in the end the east building became a depot for the Royal furnishings, then the headquarters of the French Navy, the Hôtel de la Marine. The west building was divided into individual properties for the nobility.

=== French Revolution ===
Beginning in 1789, the square was a central stage for the events of the French Revolution. On 13 July 1789, a mob came to the Hôtel de la Marine and seized a store of weapons, including two old cannon, gifts from the King of Siam, which fired the first shots during the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789. On 11 August 1792, the statue of Louis XV was pulled down and taken to a foundry, where it was melted down. A few months later, a new statue, &quot;Liberty&quot;, by the sculptor François-Frédéric Lemot, took its place; it was a figure wearing a red liberty cap and holding a lance. The Place Louis XV (&quot;Louis XV Square&quot;) became the Place de la Revolution (&quot;Revolution Square&quot;).

In October 1792, the first executions by guillotine in the square took place. The two people who were executed were thieves who had stolen the royal crown diamonds from the Hotel de la Marine. On 21 January 1793, King Louis XVI was executed there, followed in the same year on 16 October by Queen Marie Antoinette. As the Reign of Terror commenced, the guillotine was set up again on 11 May 1793, midway between the Statue of Liberty and the turning bridge at the entrance to the Tuileries Garden, and remained there for thirteen months. Of the 2,498 persons guillotined in Paris during the Revolution, 1,119 were executed on the Place de la Concorde, 73 on the Place de la Bastille and 1,306 on the Place de la Nation. Besides Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, others executed on the same site included Charlotte Corday and Madame du Barry. During the later days of the Reign of Terror in 1794, Georges Danton, Camille Desmoulins, Antoine Lavoisier, Maximilien Robespierre, and Louis de Saint-Just were executed there. The last executions, those of the Prairial riot participants, were carried out on the Place de la Concorde in May 1795.

=== 18th and 19th century: Monuments and fountains ===
In 1795, under the Directory, the square was renamed the Place de la Concorde (&quot;Concord Square&quot;) as a gesture of reconciliation after the turmoil of the revolution. After the Bourbon Restoration of 1814, the name was changed back to the Place Louis XV, and in 1826 the square was renamed the Place Louis XVI (&quot;Louis XVI Square&quot;). After the July Revolution of 1830, the name was returned to the Place de la Concorde.

In 1790, early in the French Revolution, the Concorde bridge was constructed, and, at the suggestion of Jacques-Louis David, the statues of the &quot;Marly Horses by Guillaume Coustou the Elder, were placed on the north side, at the entrance of the Champs-Élysées. In 1806, Napoleon Bonaparte began to construct the Rue de Rivoli along the edge of the square.

Under King Louis-Philippe and his prefect of the Seine, Claude-Philibert Barthelot de Rambuteau, the square was remade. In 1832, Jacques Ignace Hittorff was named chief architect of the project. In October 1835 Hittorff installed the new centrepiece of the square, the Luxor Obelisk, a gift to the King from the wali Muhammad Ali of Egypt. It was hoisted into place, before a huge crowd, on 25 October 1836. Hittorff commissioned celebrated sculptors, including James Pradier and Jean-Pierre Cortot to make eight statues representing the major cities of France, which were placed in 1838 on columns which had earlier been put in place around the square by Gabriel. These statues form something of a rudimentary map, such that when viewing the Place de la Concorde from a birdseye perspective, the north-eastern states represent north-eastern cities, in the appropriate arrangement relative to one another, and so on. A ring of twenty columns with lanterns were put in place during the same time.

Between 1836 and 1840, Hittorff erected two monumental fountains, the Fontaine Maritime to the side of the Seine, and the Fontaine Fluviale to the side of the Rue Royale. The design, consisting of two fountains each nine meters high, was modeled after that of the fountains of St. Peter&#x27;s Square in Rome. In 1853, under Napoleon III, the deep moats around the square, which had turned into rendez-vous points for prostitutes, were filled in.

=== 20th century: Expositions, occupation and triumphs ===

The square was the entry point of two major international expositions: the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900, which left behind the Grand Palais and the Petit Palais, and the 1925 International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts, which gave its name to the Art Deco architectural style of the 20th century. It was also the site of great national celebrations, including the victory celebrations of the end of the First World War and the Liberation of Paris in the Second World War. It experienced violent confrontations. A far-right demonstration in 1934 turned violent, with eleven deaths and two hundred injured. It also hosted triumphant celebrations of sporting events such as the French national team&#x27;s victory in the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

=== 21st century: Olympic and Paralympic Games, removal of traffic ===

The square continues to be the location for the focal point of the Bastille Day military parade down the Champs-Élysées, with the President of France and invited guests watching the parade from the square.

In 2024, the square was the venue for 4 sports at the 2024 Summer Olympics (BMX freestyle, Breaking, Skateboarding and Basketball 3x3), as well as the venue for the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games. Temporary stands and sporting facilities were built, while protecting items such as the Luxor Obelisk. Over 25,000 people attended the square each day during the Olympics, and the Paralympics opening ceremony was watched by 35,000 people in the square.

Following the Games, vehicle traffic did not return to the majority of the square, after Anne Hidalgo, the Mayor of Paris announced a partial pedestrianisation of the square in January 2024, with plans for a substantial redesign of the square in future.

== Description ==
=== Luxor Obelisk ===
The centrepiece of the Place de la Concorde is an ancient Egyptian obelisk decorated with hieroglyphics exalting the reign of the pharaoh Ramesses II. It is one of two which the Egyptian government gave to the French in the 19th century. The other one stayed in Egypt, too difficult and heavy to move to France with the technology at that time. On 26 September 1981 President François Mitterrand formally returned the title of the second obelisk to Egypt.

The obelisk once marked the entrance to the Luxor Temple. The wali of Egypt, or hereditary governor, Muhammad Ali Pasha, offered the 3,300-year-old Luxor Obelisk as a diplomatic gift to France in 1829. It arrived in Paris on 21 December 1833. Three years later, it was hoisted into place, on top of the pedestal which originally supported the statue of Louis XV, destroyed during the Revolution. The raising of the column was a major feat of engineering, depicted by illustrations on the base of the monument. King Louis Philippe dedicated the obelisk on 25 October 1836.

The obelisk, a yellow granite column, rises high, including the base, and weighs over . Given the technical limitations of the day, transporting it was no easy feat – on the pedestal are drawn diagrams explaining the machinery that was used for the transportation. The government of France added a gold-leafed pyramidal cap to the top of the obelisk in 1998, replacing the missing original, believed stolen in the 6th century BC.

=== Fountains ===
When he had completed the installation of the Luxor Obelisk, in 1836, Jacques-Ignace Hittorff, chief architect of the square, moved ahead with two new fountains to complement the obelisk. Hittorff had been a student of the Neoclassical designer Charles Percier at the École des Beaux-Arts. He had spent two years studying the architecture and fountains of Rome, particularly the Piazza Navona and Piazza San Pietro, each of which had obelisks aligned with fountains.

Hittorff&#x27;s fountains were each nine meters high, matching the height of the earlier columns and statues around the square representing great French cities. The Maritime Fountain was on the south, between the obelisk and Seine, and illustrated the seas bordering France, while the Fluvial Fountains or river fountain, on the north, between the Obelisk and the Rue Royale, illustrated the great rivers of France. It is located in the same place where the guillotine which executed Louis XVI had been placed. 

Both fountains had the same form: a stone basin; six figures of tritons or naiads holding fish spouting water; six seated allegorical figures, their feet on the prows of ships, supporting the pedestal, of the circular &quot;vasque&quot;; four statues of different forms of genius in arts or crafts supporting the upper inverted upper vasque; whose water shot up and then cascaded down to the lower vasque and then the basin.

The north fountain was devoted to the Rivers, with allegorical figures representing the Rhone and the Rhine, the arts of the harvesting of flowers and fruits, harvesting and grape growing; and the geniuses of river navigation, industry, and agriculture.

The south fountain, closer to the Seine, represented the seas, with figures representing the Atlantic and the Mediterranean; harvesting coral; harvesting fish; collecting shellfish; collecting pearls; and the geniuses of astronomy, navigation, and commerce.

===North side ===
 
The north side of the square, along the Rue de Rivoli, is occupied by two palatial buildings, whose matching façades were designed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel. They are separated by the Rue Royale, which enters the square from the north and was also designed by Gabriel. He planned the harmonious façades of the buildings along Rue Royale, including the façade and interior of his own residence at Number eight.

The Neoclassical facades of the two major buildings on the Place de la Concorde are nearly identical. Their design was inspired by the Louvre Colonnade, begun in 1667 by Louis Le Vau, architect of Louis XIV, Charles Le Brun, and Charles Perrault. The front is decorated with sculpted medallions and guerlands, another feature borrowed from the Louvre east front. The long front of colonnades is balanced at either end two sections with triangular frontons and Corinthian columns.

The building on the east, the Hôtel de la Marine, was originally the royal Garde-Meuble, the depot for all the royal furnishings. Marie Antoinette also had a small apartment there. In 1792, during the Revolution, it became the headquarters of the French Navy. The Navy departed in 2015, and the building is now a national monument and museum. The ceremonial rooms of the Navy and the apartments of the original intendants before the Revolution have been restored. Since 2021 the building is also home to the Al Thani Collection, a collection of ancient art from early civilisations brought together by Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, first cousin of the Emir of Qatar.

The building on the west is divided into four separate buildings, which were originally occupied by members of the French Nobility. 
* Number 4 was first occupied by the Marquise de Coislin, then, from 1805 to 1807, by the author and diplomat François-René de Chateaubriand (1805–1807). 
* Number 6 was first occupied by the Rouillé de l&#x27;Estaing, secretary of the King, and later by the Marquise de Plessis-Bellière, who left it in her will to Pope Leo XIII. The Pope in turn sold it to the Automobile Club of France in 1901, and they still occupy it. 
* Number 8, was occupied by the royal architect Pierre-Louis Moreau-Desproux. It was eventually also sold and now houses the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) which sanctions Formula 1 races.
* Number 10 was occupied in 1775 by the 6th Duke of Aumont beginning in 1775. He ceded it in 1788 to the Duke of Crillon, who emigrated from France during the French Revolution. The Duchess of Crillon returned and she and her descendants occupied it from 1820 until 1904. in 1909 it became a hotel for wealthy travellers, the Hôtel de Crillon. In 2010 it was bought by a Saudi prince, Mutaib bin Abdullah Al Saud.

=== East side: The Tuileries Garden, Jeu de Paume and Orangerie ===

On the east the Place de la Concorde is bordered by the two terraces of the Tuileries Garden, the park of the Tuileries Palace. The palace was burned by the Paris Commune in 1871, and few vestiges remain. The highly-ornate gilded gateway to the garden was designed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel, the architect to the square, and leads to the grand promenade of the garden which extends east as far as the Louvre. The gateway is flanked by two monumental equestrian sculptures by Antoine Coysevox, &quot;Fame Riding Pegasus&quot; and &quot;Mercury Riding Pegasus&quot;, made for the Château de Marly of Louis XIV, and installed at the Tuileries in 1719. They are copies; the originals are now in the Louvre.

The early west gateway of Paris, the Port de la Conference, was located at the south end of the square, next to the Seine. It was built by Henry III of France, and as the city grew was demolished in 1730. A revolving bridge originally gave entry to the gardens; it was located where the ornamental is today.

The terraces of the Garden overlooking the square are the home of two museums. At the north end, near the Rue de Rivoli, is the National Gallery of the Jeu de Paume. It was built under Emperor Napoleon III as the imperial tennis court in 1861 and was enlarged in 1878. During the Second World War it was used by the Germans as a depot for storing looted art. From 1947 until 1986 it displayed the Impressionist paintings of the Louvre. In 1997, it was entirely rebuilt, and now displays temporary exhibitions of contemporary art.

Closer to the Seine is the Orangerie Museum, which was built in 1852 by architect Firmin Bourgeois as a winter shelter for the Tuileries citrus trees, also under Napoleon III. It was later converted into an art exhibition hall, and since 1927 it has been the home of one of the most famous groups of works of Impressionism, the eight paintings of the &quot;Water Lilies&quot; series by Claude Monet. It also displays the Walter Guillaume collection of impressionist and paintings and works from the school of Paris.

The terrace overlooking the square also displays a number of important works of sculpture. These include, since 1998, four works by Auguste Rodin: &quot;The Kiss&quot; (1881–1888); a bronze copy of the marble original, cast in 1934; &quot;Eve&quot; (1881); The &quot;Grand Shadow&quot; (1881); and &quot;Meditation, with arms&quot; (1881–1905). It also displays more modern works, including &quot;Le Belle Costumé&quot; (1973) by Jean Dubuffet, and &quot;Le Grand Commandement Blanc&quot; by Alain Kirili (1986). Two marble statues of lions are also displayed on the terrace, dating from the 18th century, and made by Giuseppe Franchi.

== Redesign of the square ==
First proposed by Anne Hidalgo, the Mayor of Paris in January 2021, the square is planned to be redesigned to increase pedestrian space, reduce car traffic, and add more green space and trees. Traffic will be directed around the outside edges of the square, with the number of traffic lanes greatly reduced. Four large areas of trees and greenery will be created in the corners of the square around the obelisk and monuments and open space in the centre – with of new green space. Work is scheduled to begin in 2026.

<text>Ahmose I (&quot;Amosis&quot;, &quot;Aahmes&quot;; meaning &quot;Iah (the Moon) is born&quot;) was a pharaoh and founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt in the New Kingdom of Egypt, the era in which ancient Egypt achieved the peak of its power. His reign is usually dated to the mid-16th century BC at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age.

During his reign, Ahmose completed the conquest and expulsion of the Hyksos from the Nile Delta, restored Theban rule over Lower- and Upper Egypt, and successfully reasserted Egyptian power in its formerly subject territories of Nubia and Canaan. He then reorganized the administration of the country, reopened quarries, mines and trade routes and began massive construction projects of a type that had not been undertaken since the time of the Middle Kingdom. This building program culminated in the construction of the last pyramid built by native Egyptian rulers. Ahmose&#x27;s reign laid the foundations for the New Kingdom, under which Egyptian power reached its peak.

==Family==

He was a member of the Theban royal house, the son of pharaoh Seqenenre Tao and brother of the last pharaoh of the Seventeenth Dynasty, Kamose. During the reign of his father or grandfather, Thebes rebelled against the Hyksos, the rulers of Lower Egypt. When he was seven years old, his father was killed, and he was about ten when his brother died of unknown causes after reigning only three years. Ahmose I assumed the throne after the death of his brother, and upon coronation became known as Nebpehtyre, -- &quot;The Lord of Strength is Ra&quot;.

Ahmose descended from the Theban Seventeenth Dynasty. His grandfather and grandmother, Senakhtenre Ahmose and Tetisheri, had at least twelve children, including Seqenenre Tao and Ahhotep I. The brother and sister, according to the tradition of Egyptian queens, married, and had sons Kamose and Ahmose I, as well as several daughters. Ahmose I followed in the tradition of his father and married several of his sisters, making Ahmose-Nefertari his chief wife. They had several children including daughters Meritamun B, Sitamun A and sons Siamun A, Ahmose-ankh, Amenhotep I and Ramose A (the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; designations after the names are a convention used by Egyptologists to distinguish between royal children and wives that otherwise have the same name). They may also have been the parents of Mutnofret, who would become the wife of later successor Thutmose I. Ahmose-ankh was Ahmose&#x27;s heir apparent, but he preceded his father in death sometime between Ahmose&#x27;s 17th and 22nd regnal year. Ahmose was succeeded instead by his eldest surviving son, Amenhotep I, with whom he might have shared a short coregency.

=== Manetho ===
There was no distinct break in the line of the royal family between the Seventeenth and Eighteenth dynasties. The priest and historian Manetho author of a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II (283 – 246 BC), the now lost &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; (), considered the final expulsion of the Hyksos after nearly a century and the restoration of native Egyptian rule over the whole country a significant enough event to warrant the start of a new dynasty.

==Reign==
Ahmose I ascended the throne as a &quot;boy king&quot; at the age of 10. He went on to rule about 25 regnal years before he died around the age of 35. The beginning of his reign would have been under a regency until his coming of age. During his reign he successfully defeated the Hyksos in Lower Egypt, reuniting the Two Lands, becoming the &quot;patriarch&quot; of the New Kingdom. He also started military raids into the Levant pursuing the Hyksos.

===Regency===
Ahmose ascended the throne when he was still a child, so his mother, Ahhotep, reigned as regent until he was of age. Judging by some of the descriptions of her regal roles while in power, including the general honorific &quot;carer for Egypt&quot;, she effectively consolidated the Theban power base in the years before Ahmose assumed full control. If in fact Apepi II was a successor to Apepi I, then he is thought to have remained bottled up in the delta during Ahhotep&#x27;s regency, because his name does not appear on any monuments or objects south of Bubastis.

===Campaigns===

The conflict between the local kings of Thebes and the Hyksos king Apepi had started during the reign of Ahmose&#x27;s father, Seqenenre Tao, and would be concluded, after almost 30 years of intermittent conflict and war, during his own reign. Seqenenre Tao was possibly killed in a battle against the Hyksos, as his much-wounded mummy gruesomely suggests, and his successor Kamose (likely Ahmose&#x27;s elder brother) is known to have attacked and raided the lands around the Hyksos capital, Avaris (modern Tell el-Dab&#x27;a). Kamose evidently had a short reign, as his highest attested regnal year is year 3, and was succeeded by Ahmose I. Apepi died around a decade later.

====Conquest of the Hyksos====
Ahmose began the conquest of Lower Egypt held by the Hyksos starting around the 11th year of Khamudi&#x27;s reign, but the sequence of events is not universally agreed upon.

Analyzing the events of the conquest prior to the siege of the Hyksos capital of Avaris is extremely difficult. Almost everything known comes from a brief but invaluable military commentary on the back of the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, consisting of brief diary entries, one of which reads:


While in the past this regnal year date was assumed to refer to Ahmose, it is today believed instead to refer to Ahmose&#x27;s Hyksos opponent Khamudi since the Rhind papyrus document refers to Ahmose by the inferior title of &#x27;Prince of the South&#x27; rather than king or pharaoh, as a Theban supporter of Ahmose surely would have called him. Anthony Spalinger, in a JNES 60 (2001) book review of Kim Ryholt&#x27;s 1997 book, &quot;The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, 1800–1550 BC&quot;, notes that Ryholt&#x27;s translation of the middle portion of the Rhind text chronicling Ahmose&#x27;s invasion of the Delta reads instead as the &quot;1st month of Akhet, 23rd day. &quot;He-of-the-South&quot; (i.e. Ahmose) strikes against Sile.&quot; Spalinger stresses in his review that he does not question Ryholt&#x27;s translation of the Rhind text but instead asks whether:

The Rhind Papyrus illustrates some of Ahmose&#x27;s military strategy when attacking the Delta. Entering Heliopolis in July, he moved down the eastern delta to take Tjaru, the major border fortification on the Horus Road, the road from Egypt to Canaan, in October, totally avoiding Avaris. In taking Tjaru he cut off all traffic between Canaan and Avaris. This indicates he was planning a blockade of Avaris, isolating the Hyksos capital from help or supplies coming from Canaan.

Records of the latter part of the campaign were discovered on the tomb walls of a participating soldier, Ahmose, son of Ebana. These records indicate that Ahmose I led three attacks against Avaris, the Hyksos capital, but also had to quell a small rebellion further south in Egypt. After this, in the fourth attack, he conquered the city. He completed his victory over the Hyksos by conquering their stronghold Sharuhen near Gaza after a three-year siege. Ahmose would have conquered Avaris by the 18th or 19th year of his reign at the very latest. This is suggested by &quot;a graffito in the quarry at Tura whereby &#x27;oxen from Canaan&#x27; were used at the opening of the quarry in Ahmose&#x27;s regnal year 22.&quot; Since the cattle would probably have been imported after Ahmose&#x27;s siege of the town of Sharuhen which followed the fall of Avaris, this means that the reign of Khamudi must have terminated by Year 18 or 19 of Ahmose&#x27;s 25-year reign at the very latest.

====Levantine campaigns====
After defeating the Hyksos, Ahmose began campaigning in Syria and Nubia. A campaign during his 22nd year reached Djahy in the Levant and perhaps as far as the Euphrates, although the later Pharaoh Thutmose I is usually credited with being the first to campaign that far. Ahmose did, however, reach at least as far as Kedem (thought to be near Byblos), according to an ostracon in the tomb of his wife, Ahmose-Nefertari. Details on this particular campaign are scarce, as the source of most of the information, Ahmose, son of Ebana, served in the Egyptian navy and did not take part in this land expedition. However, it can be inferred from archaeological surveys of southern Canaan that during the late 16th century BC Ahmose and his immediate successors intended only to break the power of the Hyksos by destroying their cities and not to conquer Canaan. Many sites there were completely laid waste and not rebuilt during this period—something a Pharaoh bent on conquest and tribute would not be likely to do.

====Nubian campaigns====
Ahmose I&#x27;s campaigns in Nubia are better documented. Soon after the first Nubian campaign, a Nubian named Aata rebelled against Ahmose, but was crushed. After this attempt, an anti-Theban Egyptian named Tetian gathered many rebels in Nubia, but he too was defeated. Ahmose restored Egyptian rule over Nubia, which was controlled from a new administrative center established at Buhen. When re-establishing the national government, Ahmose appears to have rewarded various local princes who supported his cause and that of his dynastic predecessors.

===Art and monuments===

With the re-unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Ahmose, a renewal of royal support for the arts and monumental construction occurred. Ahmose reportedly devoted a tenth of all the productive output towards the service of the traditional gods, reviving massive monumental constructions as well as the arts. However, as the defeat of the Hyksos occurred relatively late in Ahmose&#x27;s reign, his subsequent building program likely lasted no more than seven years, and much of what was started was probably finished by his son and successor Amenhotep I.

Work from Ahmose&#x27;s reign is made of much finer material than anything from the Second Intermediate Period, though the craftsmanship from his reign does not always match the best work from either the Old or Middle Kingdoms. With the Delta and Nubia under Egyptian control once more, access was gained to resources not available in Upper Egypt. Gold and silver were received from Nubia, lapis lazuli from distant parts of central Asia, cedar from Byblos, and in the Sinai the Serabit el-Khadim turquoise mines were reopened. Although the exact nature of the relationship between Egypt and Crete is uncertain, at least some Minoan designs have been found on objects from this period, and Egypt considered the Aegean to be part of its empire. Ahmose reopened the Tura limestone quarries to provide stone for monuments and used Asiatic cattle from Phoenicia to haul the stone, according to his quarry inscription.
The art during Ahmose I&#x27;s reign was similar to the Middle Kingdom royal Theban style, and stelae from this period were once more of the same quality. This reflects a possibly natural conservative tendency to revive fashions from the pre-Hyksos era. Despite this, only three positively identified statuary images of Ahmose I survive: a single shabti kept at the British Museum, presumably from his tomb (which has never been positively located), and two life-size statues; one of which resides in the New York Metropolitan Museum, the other in the Khartoum Museum. All display slightly bulging eyes, a feature also present on selected stelae depicting the pharaoh. Based on style, a small limestone sphinx that resides at the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, has also been tentatively identified as representing Ahmose I.

The art of glass making is thought to have developed during Ahmose&#x27;s reign. The oldest samples of glass appear to have been defective pieces of faience, but intentional crafting of glass did not occur until the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty. One of the earliest glass beads found contains the names of both Ahmose and Amenhotep I, written in a style dated to about the time of their reigns. If glassmaking was developed no earlier than Ahmose&#x27;s reign and the first objects are dated to no later than his successor&#x27;s reign, it is quite likely that it was one of his subjects who developed the craft.

Ahmose resumed large construction projects like those before the Second Intermediate Period. In the south of the country he began constructing temples mostly built of brick, one of them in the Nubian town of Buhen. In Upper Egypt he made additions to the existing temple of Amun at Karnak and to the temple of Montu at Armant. According to an inscription at Tura, he used white limestone to build a temple to Ptah and the southern harem of Amun, but did not finish either project. He built a cenotaph for his grandmother, Queen Tetisheri, at Abydos.

Excavations at the site of Avaris by Manfred Bietak have shown that Ahmose had a palace constructed on the site of the former Hyksos capital city&#x27;s fortifications. Bietak found fragmentary Minoan-style remains of the frescoes that once covered the walls of the palace; there has subsequently been much speculation as to what role this Aegean civilization may have played in terms of trade and in the arts.

Under Ahmose&#x27;s reign, the city of Thebes became the capital for the whole of Egypt, as it had been under the 11th Dynasty in the early Middle Kingdom. It also became the center for a newly established professional civil service, where there was a greater demand for scribes and the literate as the royal archives began to fill with accounts and reports. Having Thebes as the capital was probably a strategic choice as it was located at the center of the country, the logical conclusion from having had to fight the Hyksos in the north as well as the Nubians to the south. Any future opposition at either border could be met easily.

Perhaps the most important shift was a religious one: Thebes effectively became the religious as well as the political center of the country, its local god Amun credited with inspiring Ahmose in his victories over the Hyksos. The importance of the temple complex at Karnak (on the east bank of the Nile north of Thebes) grew and the importance of the previous cult of Ra based in Heliopolis diminished.

Several stelae detailing the work done by Ahmose were found at Karnak, two of which depict him as a benefactor to the temple. In one of these stelae, known as the &quot;Tempest Stele&quot;, he claims to have rebuilt the pyramids of his predecessors at Thebes that had been destroyed by a major storm. The Thera eruption in the Aegean has been implicated by some scholars as the source of the damages described in the Tempest Stele.

=== Length and date of reign ===

According to Josephus in &quot;Contra Apionem&quot; and Theophilus of Antioch in his &quot;Apologia ad Autolycum&quot;, Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; stated that the pharaoh who expelled the Hyksos from Egypt was named &quot;Tethmôsis&quot; and reigned for 25 years and 4 months. At the opposite, according to the Byzantine scholar George Syncellus, Sextus Julius Africanus wrote that the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; reported the king to be named &quot;Amôs&quot;. Syncellus also notes that Eusebius in his &quot;Chronicon&quot; told that an &quot;Amôsis&quot; or &quot;Amoses&quot;—depending on the version of Eusebius—is mentioned in the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; as reigning 25 years and founding the eighteenth dynasty from Thebes. The 25 years figure is seemingly supported by a &#x27;Year 22&#x27; inscription from his reign at the stone quarries of Tura. A medical examination of his mummy indicates that he died when he was about thirty-five, supporting a 25-year reign if he came to the throne at the age of 10. 

Ahmose&#x27;s reign can be fairly accurately dated using the Heliacal rise of Sirius in his successor&#x27;s reign, but because of disputes over from where the observation was made, he has been assigned a reign from 1570 to 1546 BC, 1560–1537 BC, 1551–1527 BC and 1539–1514 BC by various sources. The radiocarbon date range for the start of his reign is 1570–1544 BC, the mean point of which is 1557 BC.
==Death==
===Pyramid===
The remains of Ahmose&#x27;s pyramid in Abydos were discovered in 1899 and identified as his in 1902. Most of its outer casing stones had been robbed for use in other building projects over the years, and the mound of rubble upon which it was built has collapsed. However, two rows of intact casing stones were found by Arthur Mace, who estimated its steep slope as about 60 degrees, based on the evidence of the limestone casing (compare to the less acute 51 degrees of the Great Pyramid of Giza). Adjacent to the main pyramid temple and to its east, Harvey has identified two temples constructed by Ahmose&#x27;s queen, Ahmose-Nefertary. One of these structures also bears bricks stamped with the name of Chief Treasurer Neferperet, the official responsible for re-opening the stone quarries at el-Ma&#x27;asara (Tura) in Ahmose&#x27;s year 22. A third, larger temple (Temple C) is similar to the pyramid temple in form and scale, but its stamped bricks and details of decoration reinforce that it was a cult place for Ahmose-Nefertary.

The axis of the pyramid complex may be associated with a series of monuments strung out along a kilometer of desert. Along this axis are several key structures: 1) a large pyramid dedicated to his grandmother Tetisheri which contained a stele depicting Ahmose providing offerings to her; 2) a rock-cut underground complex which may either have served as a token representation of an Osirian underworld or as an actual royal tomb; and 3) a terraced temple built against the high cliffs, featuring massive stone and brick terraces. These elements reflect in general a similar plan undertaken for the cenotaph of Senwosret III and in general its construction contains elements which reflect the style of both Old and Middle Kingdom pyramid complexes.
There is some dispute as to if this pyramid was Ahmose&#x27;s burial place, or if it was a cenotaph. Although earlier explorers Mace and Currelly were unable to locate any internal chambers, it is unlikely that a burial chamber would have been located in the midst of the pyramid&#x27;s rubble core. In the absence of any mention of a tomb of King Ahmose in the tomb robbery accounts of the Abbott Papyrus, and in the absence of any likely candidate for the king&#x27;s tomb at Thebes, it is possible that the king was interred at Abydos, as suggested by Harvey. Certainly the great number of cult structures located at the base of the pyramid located in recent years, as well as the presence at the base of the pyramid of a cemetery used by priests of Ahmose&#x27;s cult, argue for the importance of the king&#x27;s Abydos cult. However, other Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was constructed (like Tetisheri&#x27;s pyramid at Abydos) as a cenotaph and that Ahmose may have originally been buried in the southern part of Dra&#x27; Abu el-Naga&#x27; with the rest of the late Seventeenth and early Eighteenth Dynasties.

This pyramid was the last pyramid ever built as part of a mortuary complex in Egypt. The pyramid would be abandoned by subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom, for both practical and religious reasons. The Giza plateau offered plenty of room for building pyramids; but this was not the case with the confined, cliff-bound geography of Thebes and any burials in the surrounding desert were vulnerable to flooding. The pyramid form was associated with the sun god Re, who had been overshadowed by Amun in importance. One of the meanings of Amun&#x27;s name was &quot;the hidden one&quot;, which meant that it was now theologically permissible to hide the Pharaoh&#x27;s tomb by fully separating the mortuary template from the actual burial place. This provided the added advantage that the resting place of the pharaoh could be kept hidden from necropolis robbers. All subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom would be buried in rock-cut shaft tombs in the Valley of the Kings.

===Mummy===

Ahmose I&#x27;s mummy was discovered in 1881 within the Deir el-Bahri Cache, located in the hills directly above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut. He was interred along with the mummies of other Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasty leaders Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose II, Thutmose III, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II and Ramesses IX, as well as the Twenty-first Dynasty pharaohs Pinedjem I, Pinedjem II and Siamun.

Ahmose I&#x27;s mummy was unwrapped by Gaston Maspero on June 9, 1886. It was found within a coffin that bore his name in hieroglyphs, and on his bandages his name was again written in hieratic script. While the cedarwood coffin&#x27;s style dates it squarely to the time of the Eighteenth Dynasty, it was neither of royal style nor craftsmanship, and any gilding or inlays may have been stripped in antiquity. He had evidently been moved from his original burial place, re-wrapped and placed within the cache at Deir el-Bahri during the reign of the Twenty-first Dynasty priest-king Pinedjem II, whose name also appeared on the mummy&#x27;s wrappings. Around his neck a garland of &quot;Delphinium&quot; flowers had been placed. The body bore signs of having been plundered by ancient grave-robbers, his head having been broken off from his body and his nose smashed.

The body was in height. The mummy had a small face with no defining features, though he had slightly prominent front teeth; this may have been an inherited family trait, as this feature can be seen in some female mummies of the same family, as well as the mummy of his descendant, Thutmose II.
A short description of the mummy by Gaston Maspero sheds further light on familial resemblances:

Initial studies of the mummy were first thought to reveal a man in his 50s, but subsequent examinations have shown that he was instead likely to have been in his mid-30s when he died. The identity of this mummy (Cairo Museum catalog n° 61057) was called into question in 1980 by the published results of Dr. James Harris, a professor of orthodontics, and Egyptologist Edward Wente. Harris had been allowed to take x-rays of all of the supposed royal mummies at the Cairo Museum. While history records Ahmose I as being the son or possibly the grandson of Seqenenre Tao, the craniofacial morphology of the two mummies are quite different. It is also different from that of the female mummy identified as Ahmes-Nefertari, thought to be his sister. These inconsistencies, and the fact that this mummy was not posed with arms crossed over chest, as was the fashion of the period for male royal mummies, led them to conclude that this was likely not a royal mummy, leaving the identity of Ahmose I unknown.

The mummy is now in the Luxor Museum alongside the purported one of Ramesses I, as part of a permanent exhibition called &quot;The Golden Age of the Egyptian Military&quot;.

===Succession===

Ahmose I was succeeded by his son, Amenhotep I. A minority of scholars have argued that Ahmose had a short co-regency with Amenhotep, potentially lasting up to six years. If there was a co-regency, Amenhotep could not have been made king before Ahmose&#x27;s 18th regnal year, the earliest year in which Ahmose-ankh, the heir apparent, could have died. There is circumstantial evidence indicating a co-regency may have occurred, although definitive evidence is lacking.

The first piece of evidence consists of three small objects which contain both of their praenomen next to one another: the aforementioned small glass bead, a small feldspar amulet and a broken stele, all of which are written in the proper style for the early Eighteenth Dynasty. The last stele said that Amenhotep was &quot;given life eternally&quot;, which is an Egyptian idiom meaning that a king is alive, but the name of Ahmose does not have the usual epithet &quot;true of voice&quot; which is given to dead kings. Since praenomen are only assumed upon taking the throne, and assuming that both were in fact alive at the same time, it is indicated that both were reigning at the same time. There is, however, the possibility that Amenhotep I merely wished to associate himself with his beloved father, who reunited Egypt.

Second, Amenhotep I appears to have nearly finished preparations for a Sed festival, or even begun celebrating it; but Amenhotep I&#x27;s reign is usually given only 21 years and a Sed festival traditionally cannot be celebrated any earlier than a ruler&#x27;s 30th year. If Amenhotep I had a significant co-regency with his father, some have argued that he planned to celebrate his Sed festival on the date he was first crowned instead of the date that he began ruling alone. This would better explain the degree of completion of his Sed festival preparations at Karnak. There are two contemporary New Kingdom examples of the breaking of this tradition; Hatshepsut celebrated her Heb Sed festival in her 16th year and Akhenaten celebrated a Sed festival near the beginning of his 17-year reign.

Third, Ahmose&#x27;s wife, Ahmose Nefertari, was called both &quot;King&#x27;s Great Wife&quot; and &quot;King&#x27;s Mother&quot; in two stelae which were set up at the limestone quarries of Ma&#x27;sara in Ahmose&#x27;s 22nd year. For her to literally be a &quot;King&#x27;s Mother,&quot; Amenhotep would already have to be a king. It is possible that the title was only honorific, as Ahhotep II assumed the title without being the mother of any known king; though there is a possibility that her son Amenemhat was made Amenhotep I&#x27;s co-regent, but preceded him in death.

Because of this uncertainty, a co-regency is currently impossible to prove or disprove. Both Redford&#x27;s and Murnane&#x27;s works on the subject are undecided on the grounds that there is too little conclusive evidence either for or against a coregency. Even if there was one, it would have made no difference to the chronology of the period because in this kind of institution Amenhotep would have begun counting his regnal dates from his first year as sole ruler. However, co-regency supporters note that since at least one rebellion had been led against Ahmose during his reign, it would certainly have been logical to crown a successor before one&#x27;s death to prevent a struggle for the crown.

<doc id="80903" wikidata="Q712592" url="?curid=80903" title="Billie Joe Armstrong">
<text>Billie Joe Armstrong (born February 17, 1972) is an American musician and actor. He is best known for being the lead vocalist, guitarist, and primary songwriter of the rock band Green Day, which he co-founded with Mike Dirnt in 1987. He is also a guitarist and vocalist for the punk rock band Pinhead Gunpowder, and provides lead vocals for Green Day&#x27;s side projects Foxboro Hot Tubs, the Network, the Longshot and the Coverups. Armstrong has been considered by critics as one of the greatest punk rock guitarists of all time.

Armstrong developed an interest in music at a young age, and recorded his first song at the age of five. He met Dirnt while attending elementary school, and the two instantly bonded over their mutual interest in music, forming the band Sweet Children when the two were 14 years old. The band later changed its name to Green Day. Armstrong has also pursued musical projects including numerous collaborations with other musicians.

Armstrong has acted in several films and TV series, including &quot;Like Sunday, Like Rain&quot;, &quot;Ordinary World&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;Haunted&quot;, and &quot;Drunk History&quot;. In addition to co-writing the book and lyrics for &quot;American Idiot&quot;, a jukebox musical featuring several of Green Day&#x27;s songs, Armstrong portrayed the role of St. Jimmy in the show for several weeks during its run on Broadway.

Armstrong&#x27;s business ventures include founding Adeline Records to help support other bands in 1997, coinciding with the release of &quot;Nimrod&quot;. Adeline signed acts such as the Frustrators, AFI, and Dillinger Four. The record company shut down two decades later in August 2017. Armstrong also co-founded Punk Bunny Coffee (formerly Oakland Coffee Works) in 2015.

==Early life==
Armstrong was born in Oakland, California, on February 17, 1972, the youngest of six children of Ollie Jackson (born 1932) and Andrew Marsicano Armstrong (1928–1982). He was raised in Rodeo, California. His father, a jazz musician and truck driver for Safeway, died of esophageal cancer on September 10, 1982, when Armstrong was 10 years old. The song &quot;Wake Me Up When September Ends&quot; is a memorial to his father. Armstrong has five siblings, including three older sisters, Marci, Hollie, and Anna, and two older brothers, David and Alan. His mother worked as a waitress at Rod&#x27;s Hickory Pit in El Cerrito, California, where he and Mike Dirnt later played their first gig in 1987. His great-great-grandparents Pietro Marsicano and Teresa Nigro were Italian immigrants from Viggiano, who settled in Boston prior to relocating to Berkeley, California, in 1869.

Armstrong attended Hillcrest Elementary School in Rodeo, where a teacher encouraged him to record a song titled &quot;Look for Love&quot; at the age of five on the Bay Area label Fiat Records. After his father died, his mother married a man whom her children disliked, which resulted in Armstrong&#x27;s further retreat into music. At the age of 10, he met future bandmate Mike Dirnt in the school cafeteria, and they immediately bonded over their love of music. He became interested in punk rock after being introduced to the genre by his brothers. He has cited Van Halen, Ramones, the Replacements, and Hüsker Dü as musical influences. The first concert he ever attended was Van Halen in 1984. After Hillcrest Elementary, Armstrong attended Carquinez Middle School and John Swett High School, both in Crockett, California, and later transferred to Pinole Valley High School in Pinole, California. On his 18th birthday, he dropped out to pursue a musical career.

==Career==
In 1987, aged 15, Armstrong formed a band called Sweet Children with his childhood friend Mike Dirnt. In the beginning, Armstrong and Dirnt both played guitar, with Raj Punjabi on drums and Sean Hughes on bass. Punjabi was later replaced on drums by John Kiffmeyer, also known as Al Sobrante. After a few performances, Hughes left the band in 1988; Dirnt then began playing bass and they became a three-piece band. They changed their name to Green Day in April 1989, choosing the name because of their fondness for marijuana.

In 1989, Green Day released their debut EP &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; through Lookout! Records. They recorded their debut studio album &quot;39/Smooth&quot; and the extended play &quot;Slappy&quot; in 1990, which were later combined with &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; into the compilation &quot;1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours&quot; in 1991.

In 1990, Armstrong provided lead guitar and backing vocals on three songs for the Lookouts&#x27; final EP &quot;IV&quot;, which featured Tré Cool on drums. Tré became Green Day&#x27;s drummer in late 1990 after Sobrante left to go to college. Cool made his debut on Green Day&#x27;s second album, &quot;Kerplunk&quot; (1991).

In 1991, Armstrong joined the band Pinhead Gunpowder, consisting of bassist Bill Schneider, drummer Aaron Cometbus, and fellow vocalist/guitarist Sarah Kirsch. Kirsch left the group in 1992, and was replaced by Jason White. The group has released several extended plays and albums from 1991 to the present, and performs live shows on an intermittent basis.

In 1993, Armstrong played live several times with California punk band Rancid. Rancid&#x27;s lead singer, Tim Armstrong, asked Billie Joe Armstrong to join his band, but he refused due to his progress with Green Day. However, Billie Joe Armstrong was credited as a co-writer on Rancid&#x27;s 1993 song, Radio.

With their third LP, &quot;Dookie&quot; (1994), Green Day broke through into the mainstream, and have remained one of the most popular rock bands of the 1990s and 2000s with over 60 million records sold worldwide. The album was followed by &quot;Insomniac&quot; (1995), &quot;Nimrod&quot; (1997), and &quot;Warning&quot; (2000).

Armstrong collaborated with many artists. He co-wrote the Go-Go&#x27;s 2001 song &quot;Unforgiven&quot;. He has also co-written songs with Penelope Houston (&quot;The Angel and The Jerk&quot; and &quot;New Day&quot;), and sung backing vocals with Melissa Auf der Maur on Ryan Adams&#x27; &quot;Do Miss America&quot; (where they acted as the backing band for Iggy Pop on his album &quot;Skull Ring&quot; (&quot;Private Hell&quot; and &quot;Supermarket&quot;). Armstrong produced an album for the Riverdales. He was part of the Green Day side project the Network from 2003 to 2005, which became active again in 2020. The Network released two albums: 2003&#x27;s &quot;Money Money 2020&quot; and 2020&#x27;s &quot;Money Money 2020 Part II: We Told Ya So!&quot;.

Hoping to clear his head and develop new ideas for songs, Armstrong traveled to New York City alone for a few weeks in 2003, renting a small apartment in the East Village of Manhattan. He spent much of this time taking long walks and participating in jam sessions in the basement of Hi-Fi, a bar in Manhattan. However, the friends he made during this time drank too much for his liking, which was the catalyst for Armstrong&#x27;s return to the Bay Area. After returning home, Armstrong was arrested for driving under the influence on January 5, 2003, and released on $1,200 bail.
In 2004, Green Day debuted &quot;American Idiot&quot;, their first rock opera. The album has sold more than 15,000,000 copies worldwide, fueled by the hit singles &quot;American Idiot&quot;, &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot; and &quot;Wake Me Up When September Ends&quot;. In 2009, Green Day released &quot;21st Century Breakdown&quot;, the band&#x27;s second rock opera, which was another commercial success. Between these two projects, Armstrong was the lead vocalist of the Green Day side project Foxboro Hot Tubs, who formed in 2007 and have performed intermittent live shows ever since. Foxboro Hot Tubs released one album, &quot;Stop Drop and Roll!!!&quot;, in 2008.

In 2009, Armstrong formed a band called Rodeo Queens, along with members of Green Day and NYC punk rocker Jesse Malin. They released one song, along with a video, called &quot;Depression Times&quot;.

In 2009, &quot;American Idiot&quot; was adapted into a Broadway musical, also called &quot;American Idiot&quot;. The musical won two Tony Awards. Armstrong appeared in &quot;American Idiot&quot; in the role of St. Jimmy for two stints in late 2010 and early 2011.

In 2012, Green Day released a trio of albums: &quot;¡Uno!&quot;, &quot;¡Dos!&quot;, and &quot;¡Tré!&quot;. In 2013, Armstrong appeared on Season 3 of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Voice&quot; as an assistant mentor for Christina Aguilera&#x27;s team. In 2013, Armstrong and singer-songwriter Norah Jones released the album &quot;Foreverly&quot;, consisting of covers of songs from the Everly Brothers&#x27; album &quot;Songs Our Daddy Taught Us&quot;. The first single from the album, &quot;Long Time Gone&quot;, was released on October 23.

===2012 substance abuse===
On September 21, 2012, during a Green Day performance at Las Vegas&#x27; iHeartRadio Music Festival, Armstrong became agitated onstage and stopped the band&#x27;s set midway through their performance of the 1994 hit song &quot;Basket Case&quot;. In an expletive-filled rant, Armstrong criticized the event&#x27;s promoters for allegedly cutting short the band&#x27;s performance, before smashing his guitar and storming off stage. The band later issued a statement apologizing for the incident and clarifying that their set had not actually been cut short. The incident occurred just four days prior to the release of Green Day&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;¡Uno!&quot;

Two days after the incident at the iHeartRadio Music Festival, Green Day announced that Armstrong was seeking treatment for an unspecified substance abuse problem. As a result, scheduled appearances on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot; and &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; were canceled. According to Claudia Suarez Wright, Tre Cool&#x27;s ex-wife and the mother of Armstrong&#x27;s godson, Armstrong had been drinking heavily in Las Vegas prior to the iHeartRadio Music Festival, following approximately one year of sobriety.

Armstrong gave an interview to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in March 2013 in which he said that he had &quot;been trying to get sober since 1997, right around &quot;Nimrod&quot;&quot;. He discussed how, during the 21st Century Breakdown tour of 2009–2010, &quot;There were meltdowns on that tour that were huge&quot;. Armstrong detailed his addiction, in particular how it had escalated in the months prior to the release of the &quot;¡Uno!&quot;, &quot;¡Dos!&quot;, and &quot;¡Tre!&quot; albums and the performance at iHeartRadio, stating that during the band&#x27;s 2011 summer tour of Europe, &quot;I was at my pill-taking height at that time, medicating the shit out of myself&quot;. Armstrong gave details of a gig at Irving Plaza in New York just over a week before the iHeartRadio incident, in which he &quot;Threw back four or five beers before we went on and probably had four or five when we played. Then I drank my body weight in alcohol after that. I ended up hungover on the West Side Highway, laying in a little park.&quot;

Green Day canceled all remaining concert dates for 2012 and early 2013 as Armstrong continued dealing with his personal problems. In late December 2012, the band announced they would return to touring at the end of March 2013. Armstrong later said that the substances he had been abusing were alcohol and prescription pills for anxiety and insomnia.

===2013 onward===

Armstrong also collaborated with the comedy hip hop group Lonely Island in their song &quot;I Run NY&quot; from &quot;The Wack Album&quot; released on June 7, 2013. He starred alongside Leighton Meester in the 2014 film &quot;Like Sunday, Like Rain&quot;. For his work in the film, Bilie Joe won the Breakout Performance Award at the 2014 Williamsburg Independent Film Festival. Armstrong wrote songs for &quot;These Paper Bullets&quot;, a rock musical adaptation of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, which premiered at Yale Repertory Theater in March 2014.

In 2014, Armstrong joined the Replacements for a number of shows beginning on April 19 at Coachella. Frontman Paul Westerberg had been suffering with back problems and spent the majority of the gig lying on a sofa while Armstrong helped play his parts. Westerberg referred to Billie Joe as an &quot;expansion of the band&quot;. Armstrong joined the Replacements on stage again at the Shaky Knees Music Festival in Atlanta in May.

In November 2014, Armstrong moved with his son Joseph to New York and began working on another acting role, in the film &quot;Ordinary World&quot;. It was Armstrong&#x27;s first lead acting role. The film centers on the mid-life crisis of a husband and father who attempts to revisit his punk past, and was released in 2016. It included new songs written and performed by Armstrong. The film got mixed reviews, although Armstrong&#x27;s own performance was generally praised, with &quot;The Village Voice&quot; writing that he had &quot;a low-key charm suggesting that, if he desired it, he could get more onscreen gigs in between albums.&quot;

In October 2016, Green Day released their album &quot;Revolution Radio&quot;. In July 2017, Armstrong formed a supergroup with Tim Armstrong of Rancid, named the Armstrongs.

In April 2018, Armstrong formed the rock band the Longshot, and on April 20, the band released their debut studio album &quot;Love Is for Losers&quot;. Shortly after, Armstrong announced that he and the Longshot would embark on a summer tour. Aside from Armstrong, the band&#x27;s lineup consists of Kevin Preston and David S. Field of the band Prima Donna on lead guitar and drums, respectively, and longtime Green Day live member Jeff Matika on bass.

In 2019, Armstrong co-wrote and performed the track &quot;Strangers &amp; Thieves&quot; on the album &quot;Sunset Kids&quot; by Jesse Malin.

In February 2020, Green Day released their thirteenth album, &quot;Father of All Motherfuckers&quot;.

Green Day&#x27;s fourteenth album, &quot;Saviors&quot;, was released on January 19, 2024.

==Artistry==
Armstrong is known for his frequent use of palm-muted, power chord-driven guitar riffs, and melodic guitar solos. His strumming style makes use of techniques such as stubbing and fret hand muting, which allows him to strum power chords harder while attacking all six strings on the guitar.

==Instruments==
Armstrong&#x27;s first guitar was a Cherry Red Hohner acoustic, which his father bought for him. He received his first electric guitar, a Fernandes The Revival RST-50 Stratocaster that he named &quot;Blue&quot;, when he was ten years old in 1982, the same year his father died. His mother got &quot;Blue&quot; from George Cole, who taught Armstrong to play guitar for 10 years. Armstrong says in a 1995 MTV interview, &quot;Basically, it wasn&#x27;t like guitar lessons because I never really learned how to read music. So he just taught me how to put my hands on the thing.&quot; Cole bought the guitar new from David Margen of the band Santana. Cole installed the Bill Lawrence L500XL Humbucker pickup in the bridge position at an angle, similar to Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s guitar Frankenstrat, which caused Armstrong to be very influenced by Van Halen. The L500XL is the same pickup that was used by Dimebag Darrell of Pantera, Armstrong replaced the L500XL with a white Yamaha Pacifica humbucker at Woodstock &#x27;94.

Armstrong later reinstalled the Bill Lawrence L500XL pickup before recording Insomniac, although he switched to a black Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB in 1995. He toured with this guitar from the band&#x27;s early days and still uses it to this day.

Marc Spitz writes that, &quot;Armstrong fetishized his teacher&#x27;s guitar, partly because the blue instrument had a sound quality and Van Halen-worthy fluidity he couldn&#x27;t get from his little red Hohner. He prized it mostly, however, because of his relationship with Cole, another father figure after the death of Andy.&quot;

Both middle and neck pickups are disconnected and the pickup selector is locked in the bridge position. This also applies to his backup guitar and &quot;Blue&quot; copies, mainly Fender Stratocasters. &quot;Blue&quot; appears in a number of Green Day music videos such as &quot;Longview&quot;, &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot;, &quot;Basket Case&quot;, &quot;Geek Stink Breath&quot;, &quot;Stuck with Me&quot;, &quot;Brain Stew/Jaded&quot;, &quot;Hitchin&#x27; a Ride&quot;, and &quot;Minority&quot;. &quot;Blue&quot; also appears on the album cover of &quot;Insomniac&quot;. The &quot;BJ&quot; on Blue stands for Billie Joe, inspired by Stevie Ray Vaughan, whose Stratocaster has his own initials (&quot;SRV&quot;) on the pickguard.

Today, Armstrong mainly uses Gibson and Fender guitars. Twenty of his Gibson guitars are Les Paul Junior models from the mid- to late-1950s. His Fender collection includes Stratocasters, Jazzmasters, Telecasters, a Gretsch hollowbody, Rickenbacker 360 and his copies of &quot;Blue&quot; from Fender Custom Shop. Recently he has begun giving away guitars to audience members invited to play on stage with Green Day, usually during the songs &quot;Knowledge&quot; or &quot;Longview&quot;. He states that his favorite guitar is a 1956 Gibson Les Paul Junior he calls &quot;Floyd&quot;, which he bought in 2000 just before recording the album &quot;Warning&quot;.

Armstrong also has three of his own Les Paul Junior signature models from Gibson. The first has been in production since 2006 and is modeled closely after &quot;Floyd&quot;. The second began production in 2012 and is a TV Yellow double-cutaway Junior. Both models include a Gibson &quot;H-90&quot; pickup, exclusive to Armstrong&#x27;s models. Gibson has also released an extremely limited run of acoustic signature guitars. Epiphone has release lower-priced version of his signature Gibson Les Paul Junior in 2022.

Armstrong&#x27;s amplifiers consist of a pair of Marshall 100-watt 1959 Super Lead reissues he acquired sometime before Green Day&#x27;s Woodstock &#x27;94 performance and had modified for increased distortion. Nicknamed &quot;Meat&quot; and &quot;Pete,&quot; the two amps are run in conjunction for a fuller sound, with a Boss BD-2 Blues Driver used for solos. For clean tones, Armstrong uses a rackmount Custom Audio Electronics 3+ SE tube preamp, and all three amplifiers are run through a pair of Marshall 1960B cabinets with Celestion Vintage 30 speakers. In 2019, MXR released Armstrong&#x27;s signature overdrive pedal, the Dookie Drive, which aimed to reproduce his dual-Marshall setup and was decorated with the cover art from the &quot;Dookie&quot; album. MXR later rebranded the pedal as the FOD Drive.

Armstrong plays several other instruments as well as guitar. He recorded harmonica and mandolin parts on &quot;Nimrod&quot; and &quot;Warning&quot;, piano parts on &quot;21st Century Breakdown&quot;, &quot;American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording&quot; (2010), &quot;¡Tré!&quot;, and Revolution Radio, and plays drums and bass occasionally.

==Personal life==

In June 2018, Armstrong was given honorary citizenship of Viggiano, the Italian commune from where his paternal great-great-grandparents hailed, by Viggiano&#x27;s mayor Amedeo Cicala. Armstrong is a member of the board of directors of Project Chimps, a sanctuary for former research chimpanzees funded in large part by the Humane Society of the United States. In 2024, Green Day saw several Las Vegas radio stations pull their songs after Armstrong described the city as a &quot;shithole&quot; following the relocation of the Oakland Athletics to the city.

Armstrong is a fan of soccer and is one of the co-owners of Oakland Roots SC.

===Business ventures===
In 1997, Armstrong co-founded Adeline Records, a rock and punk rock record label which had, in recent years, been managed by Pat Magnarella, Green Day&#x27;s manager. Adeline Records closed in August 2017 following Magnarella&#x27;s split from Green Day.

In April 2015, Armstrong opened &quot;Broken Guitars&quot; (now Oakland Guitars), a guitar shop in Oakland, California with fellow Pinhead Gunpowder member and longtime Green Day associate, Bill Schneider.

In December 2015, Armstrong and Mike Dirnt launched a coffee company, Oakland Coffee Works. The company sells organic coffee beans and is said to be the first company to use mass-produced compostable bags and pods.

===Fashion===

Armstrong has been noted for his punk fashion style, which influenced his followers of previous and current generations to the point of being known as a &quot;style icon&quot;. He also launched an eye liner with Kat Von D named &quot;Basket Case&quot;, which is a cosmetic that he implemented as part of his singing character since his beginnings.

===Political views===
Armstrong supported Barack Obama during the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, and Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential election. Following Sanders&#x27; defeat in the Democratic primaries, Armstrong declared his support for Hillary Clinton. He was critical of Donald Trump during the election and throughout Trump&#x27;s presidency, calling him a &quot;fascist&quot; and a &quot;puppet of the Illuminati&quot;, comparing him to Adolf Hitler, and blaming &quot;uneducated white working-class people&quot; for his rise to power. In a 2017 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, he stated that he does not align himself with any political party and described himself as an independent. He again supported Sanders during the 2020 presidential election, later endorsing Joe Biden after Sanders lost the primary. Following the U.S. Supreme Court decision &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, Armstrong announced his plans to renounce his United States citizenship. Armstrong endorsed Kamala Harris on the day of the 2024 election.

Armstrong has spoken out in support of transgender people. In a 2024 interview with &quot;the Times&quot;, Armstrong spoke to the ways that he is still weaving his queerness into his songwriting. The newspaper asked him about Green Day&#x27;s opinions on the moral panic surrounding transgender youth, to which the singer responded, &quot;I just think they&#x27;re fucking close-minded.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s like people are afraid of their children,&quot; he told the newspaper. &quot;Why would you be afraid? Why don&#x27;t you let your kid just be the kid that they are?&quot;

===Relationships and sexuality===

Armstrong has identified himself as bisexual, saying in a 1995 interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot;, &quot;I think I&#x27;ve always been bisexual. I mean, it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;ve always been interested in. I think people are born bisexual, and it&#x27;s just that our parents and society kind of veer us off into this feeling of, &#x27;Oh, I can&#x27;t.&#x27; They say it&#x27;s taboo. It&#x27;s ingrained in our heads that it&#x27;s bad, when it&#x27;s not bad at all. It&#x27;s a very beautiful thing.&quot; In February 2014, he again discussed his bisexuality in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article about the Green Day album &quot;Dookie&quot;, which he described as &quot;touch[ing] on bisexuality a lot&quot;.

Armstrong met his first serious girlfriend, Arica Pelino, at 924 Gilman Street on his 16th birthday. She became known as the &quot;first official Green Day fan,&quot; listening to the first four-track recordings by Armstrong and Sean Hughes, encouraging the band, touring with them and acting as an occasional photographer for them. She inspired many of Green Day&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Christie Road&quot;, which was written about the local railroad tracks where she and Armstrong would sneak out to meet. When Armstrong began living in punk houses and warehouses at the age of seventeen, including the warehouse above a West Oakland brothel which ultimately inspired the song &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot;, she would often stay with him, later saying, &quot;I would stay with him sometimes in these warehouses full of crusty punks.&quot; The couple split in late 1991. Arica is the sister of former Green Day touring member Mike Pelino and the sister-in-law of Janna White, who is married to Green Day touring guitarist Jason White.

Shortly after his split with Pelino, Armstrong began dating a woman he has identified only as &quot;Amanda&quot;. She produced and distributed her own fan zine and was an &quot;iron-willed&quot; feminist, which enthralled Armstrong. Amanda, however, was unimpressed with Armstrong; though the couple dated for some time, she ultimately left him in 1994 and joined the Peace Corps, leaving him feeling suicidal. Armstrong stated in an interview with &quot;Spin&quot; about the inspiration behind the Green Day song &quot;Armatage Shanks&quot; in 1995: &quot;It was right before &quot;Dookie&quot; came out and I was really at odds with myself. I was like, &#x27;Man, do I really want to do this?&#x27; A lot of time I was thinking about suicide, how it&#x27;s so easy to kill yourself, but it&#x27;s so hard to stay alive. I was in a break-up with my then-girlfriend, a total, raving punk rocker who didn&#x27;t approve of me being on a major label. She moved down to Ecuador saying she couldn&#x27;t live in a world with McDonald&#x27;s and such. It was fucking me up pretty bad.&quot; Armstrong has written many songs about Amanda, both during their relationship and afterwards, including &quot;She&quot;, &quot;Good Riddance&quot;, &quot;Stuart and the Ave&quot;, &quot;Sassafras Roots&quot;, &quot;Amanda&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s a Rebel&quot;, &quot;Extraordinary Girl&quot;, and &quot;Whatsername&quot;. The character of Whatsername on the album &quot;American Idiot&quot;, and in the &quot;American Idiot&quot; musical, is based on Amanda.

In 1990, Armstrong met Adrienne Nesser (the sister of professional skateboarder Steve Nesser) at one of Green Day&#x27;s early performances in Minneapolis. They married on July 2, 1994, with Nesser discovering that she was pregnant the day after their wedding. Their first son, Joseph Marciano &quot;Joey&quot; Armstrong, was born on February 28, 1995. Joey went on to play drums in the Oakland-based band SWMRS. Their second son, Jakob Danger Armstrong, was born on September 12, 1998. Jakob is a guitarist and singer-songwriter who released his first material online in 2015 and currently plays with the band Ultra Q (formerly Mt. Eddy). In a February 2014 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Armstrong described his sudden marriage and fatherhood: &quot;I was very impulsive at that time. I think that impulsive behavior was meant to counteract the chaos in my life.&quot;

<text>Year 377 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Mamercinus, Poplicola, Cicurinus, Rufus (or Praetextatus), Cincinnatus and Cincinnatus (or, less frequently, year 377 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 377 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

==== Greece ====
* Timotheus wins over the Acarnanians and Molossians as friends of Athens.
* Athens, in preparing for participation in the Spartan-Theban struggle, reorganises its finances and its taxation, inaugurating a system whereby the richer citizens are responsible for the collection of taxes from the less rich.
* The Peace of Antalcidas (387 BC), includes a clause guaranteeing the Greek cities their independence. The Spartan King Agesilaus II uses this clause as an excuse to force the dissolution of Thebes&#x27; Boeotian League. In two sieges, he reduces Thebes to near starvation.

<text>The state of the art (SOTA or SotA, sometimes cutting edge, leading edge, or bleeding edge) refers to the highest level of general development, as of a device, technique, or scientific field achieved at a particular time. However, in some contexts it can also refer to a level of development reached at any particular time as a result of the common methodologies employed at the time.

The term has been used since 1910, and has become both a common term in advertising and marketing, and a legally significant phrase with respect to both patent law and tort liability.

In advertising, the phrase is often used to convey that a product is made with the best or latest available technology, but it has been noted that &quot;the term &#x27;state of the art&#x27; requires little proof on the part of advertisers&quot;, as it is considered mere puffery. The use of the term in patent law &quot;does not connote even superiority, let alone the superlative quality the ad writers would have us ascribe to the term&quot;.

== Origin and history ==
The concept of the &quot;state of the art&quot; originated at the beginning of the 20th century. The earliest use of the term &quot;state of the art&quot; documented by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates back to 1910, from an engineering manual by Henry Harrison Suplee (1856 – after 1943), an engineering graduate (University of Pennsylvania, 1876), titled &quot;The Gas Turbine: Progress in the Design and Construction of Turbines Operated by Gases of Combustion&quot;. The relevant passage reads: &quot;In the present state of the art this is all that can be done&quot;. The term &quot;art&quot; refers to technics, rather than performing or fine arts.

Over time, use of the term increased in all fields where this kind of art has a significant role. In this relation it has been quoted by the author that &quot;although eighteenth-century writers did not use the term, there was indeed in existence a collection of scientific and engineering knowledge and expertise that can be identified as the state of the art for that time&quot;.

Despite its actual meaning, which does not convey technology that is ahead of the industry, the phrase became so widely used in advertising that a 1985 article described it as &quot;overused&quot;, stating that &quot;[it] has no punch left and actually sounds like a lie&quot;. A 1994 essay listed it among &quot;the same old tired clichés&quot; that should be avoided in advertising.

== Legal importance ==

=== Patent law ===

In the context of European and Australian patent law, the term &quot;state of the art&quot; is a concept used in the process of assessing and asserting novelty and inventive step, and is a synonym of the expression &quot;prior art&quot;. In the European Patent Convention (EPC), &quot;[t]he state of the art shall be held to comprise everything made available to the public by means of a written or oral description, by use, or in any other way, before the date of filing of the European patent application&quot; according to . Due account should be taken of as well, but merely for the examination of novelty.

The expression &quot;background art&quot; is also used in certain legal provisions, such as (previously ), and has the same meaning.

=== Tort liability ===
The state of the art is important in the law of tort liability, specifically in the areas of negligence and product liability. With respect to negligence, &quot;an engineer may defend against a claim of negligence by contending that he met the standards of his profession and the state of the art&quot;. With respect to product liability, manufacturers generally have strict liability for any injury caused by defects in their products. However, in some jurisdictions a manufacturer may raise as a legal defense the assertion that their product represents the &quot;state of the art&quot;, and that the manufacturer therefore could not have made the product any safer in light of the knowledge available at the time. For example, &quot;[u]nder German law, the producer can also raise the state-of-the-art defense: general tort law does not hold him liable if he could not know or discover the defect for lack of fault, and the Product Liability Statute expressly provides for this defense&quot;. This defense is available throughout the European Community under the Product Liability Directive, art. 7(e). Pursuant to this article:

In the United States, the state of an industry is &quot;merely evidence of due care rather than a controlling factor&quot;, but a number of states have state-of-the-art statutes that &quot;make a manufacturer&#x27;s compliance with technological feasibility an absolute defense to a products liability suit&quot;. Because the state of the art is constantly advancing, the ability of manufacturers to claim that their products are &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; tracks their potential liability when these products are defective. As an industry magazine explained in 1984:

<text>Battleground is a 1949 American war film directed by William A. Wellman and starring Van Johnson, John Hodiak, Ricardo Montalbán, George Murphy, and James Whitmore. It follows a fictional company of the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division as they fight in the siege of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, in World War II. The screenplay was written by Robert Pirosh, based on his own experiences during the battle.

The film portrays American soldiers as vulnerable and human. While they remain steadfast and courageous, each soldier has at least one moment in the film when he seriously considers running away, schemes to get sent back from the front line, slacks off, or complains about the situation he is in. One writer – disregarding Warner&#x27;s successful &quot;Fighter Squadron&quot; of 1948 – describes &quot;Battleground&quot; as the first significant American film about World War II to be made and released after the end of the war.

&quot;Battleground&quot; premiered in Washington, D.C. on November 9, 1949, and was distributed in the United States by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. A widespread critical and commercial success, the film won Best Story and Screenplay (Pirosh) and Best Cinematography – Black-and-White (Paul C. Vogel) at the 22nd Academy Awards, out of six total nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director for Wellman. James Whitmore, for his second-ever film role, was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe Award for his performance.

The film was nominated for the American Film Institute&#x27;s 2001 list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills.

==Plot==

In mid-December 1944, Privates Jim Layton and William J. Hooper are assigned to the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. As a newcomer, Layton receives a chilly welcome from his squad. Private First Class Holley returns to the company after recuperating from a wound.

Instead of going on leave in Paris, the squad is trucked back to the front because of a surprise German breakthrough in the Ardennes. They stop that night in Bastogne and are put up for the night in the apartment of a young woman, Denise, to whom Holley is attracted.

Jarvess later stands guard in the village, where he runs into some battle-weary soldiers making a &quot;strategic withdrawal&quot;. The next morning, led by Platoon Sergeant Kinnie, the men are ordered to dig in on the outskirts of town. Just as they are nearly done, they are sent elsewhere and must dig in all over again.

Holley, Layton, and Kippton man a roadblock that night. German soldiers disguised as Americans infiltrate their position and later blow-up a nearby bridge. In the morning, Roderigues, a Latino from Los Angeles, is delighted by the novelty of snow from a heavy winter storm, but &quot;Pop&quot; Stazak, awaiting a &quot;dependency discharge&quot; that will send him home, is unimpressed. Layton goes to see Hooper, only to find he had been killed, and no one in his company had even known his name.

Kinnie informs the squad about the infiltration and dispatches a patrol comprising Holley, Roderigues, and Jarvess. Just before they start out, the platoon is shelled by German artillery, causing Bettis to panic and desert. Holley&#x27;s patrol briefly skirmishes with the infiltrators. Roderigues is wounded by machine-gun fire from an enemy tank. Holley conceals him under a disabled jeep half-buried in snow, promising to return for him. Unfortunately, by the time Holley can return, Roderigues has died.

Sgt. Wolowicz, wounded by shrapnel, and a sick Cpl. Standiferd are sent to a field hospital. Later, Doc informs the 2nd Squad that the hospital has been captured.

Holley is appointed the new squad leader and partnered with Layton, while Pop is paired with Hansan. Pop&#x27;s discharge finally comes in, but they learn from Kipp they are surrounded, meaning he&#x27;s stuck and unable to leave.

Moved repeatedly, the 3rd Platoon is attacked at dawn. When it appears the platoon will be overrun, Hansan is wounded, Holley flees, and Layton follows Holley. Ashamed, Holley turns around and leads a flanking counterattack that stops the Germans, during which Abner Spudler is killed reaching for his boots, as he can&#x27;t sleep with them on.

After they get Hanson to an aid station, the squad runs into Bettis, who is doing K.P. duty. Holley finds Layton being entertained by Denise. Later, while on guard duty, they encounter some Germans who have come under a flag of truce to offer Brigadier General McAuliffe surrender terms; his famous reply - &quot;Nuts!&quot; - puzzles the Germans.

The squad is short of supplies, as bad weather has grounded the supply transport aircraft. Several men attend impromptu outdoor Christmas services held by a chaplain. (The chaplain had previously served as clergy at a Hanukkah ceremony, and when he asks a Jewish soldier how he did he responds, &quot;Not bad for a beginner, sir.&quot;) The chaplain gives a short speech on the importance of the fight against fascism. He then asks &quot;The 64 dollar question is: was this trip worth it?&quot; After giving an affirmative explanation, he says that people will forget, but they won&#x27;t, and &quot;don&#x27;t let anyone ever tell you that you were a sucker to fight against fascism.&quot; That night, the Luftwaffe bombs Bastogne. Denise dies, and Bettis, slowed by his fear of returning to the lines, is killed by a collapsing house. The &quot;walking wounded&quot;, including Hansan and a mess sergeant he befriends, are recalled for a last-ditch defense of the town.

As the platoon is down to its last few rounds of ammunition, the weather finally clears, allowing Allied fighter aircraft to attack the Germans and C-47 transports to drop supplies, enabling the 101st to hold. Afterward, Kinnie leads the platoon&#x27;s survivors rearward for a well-earned rest.

==Cast==
===Casting notes===
Several of the cast members had served in the U.S. armed forces during World War II: Jerome Courtland served in the Army in the Pacific Theatre, Don Taylor served in the Army Air Forces, James Whitmore was a 2nd Lieutenant with the 4th Marine Division in Saipan, Douglas Fowley served in the Navy, Richard Jaeckal was in the Merchant Marine from 1944 to 1949, James Arness served in the 7th Infantry Regiment of the Army and received a Bronze Star and Purple Heart for actions during the Battle of Anzio, Brett King served in the Army Air Forces and received both a Purple Heart and the Distinguished Flying Cross. Neville Brand, a veteran of the 83rd Infantry Division and Silver Star recipient, made his film debut with an uncredited minor role, playing a soldier singing &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;.

==Historical accuracy==
Although the film is a fictionalized version of the siege of Bastogne, there were no Germans disguised as Americans GIs operating around Bastogne. Operation Greif only focused on the front of the 6th Panzer Army, many miles to the north. The scenes depicting US troops quizzing each other about their culture (like sports and films) to verify they were not German infiltrators did occur once news of the operation became known.

The unit portrayed in the film is the fictional &quot;2nd Squad, 3rd Platoon of Item Company&quot; of the real 327th Glider Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. The 327th Glider Infantry Regiment never had an Item Company. When the airborne divisions were conceived early in World War II, glider regiments were given two battalions; the first had companies named Able, Baker, Charlie, and Dog while the second got Easy, Fox, George, and How. The 327th held the western perimeter of Bastogne.

==Production==

===Background===
Robert Pirosh had based the script on his own experiences during the Battle of the Bulge, although he did not serve with the 101st Airborne, but with the 35th Infantry Division. 

Many of the incidents in the film were based on actual events, including the rejection of a German demand for surrender on December 22, 1944, with Brig. Gen. Anthony McAuliffe&#x27;s one word response, &quot;Nuts!&quot;. Other events in the film, like Private Kipp&#x27;s continual loss of his false teeth and Private Roderigues&#x27; having never seen snow before, were from Pirosh&#x27;s experiences.

===Development and casting===
&quot;Battleground&quot; was originally an RKO property, titled &quot;Prelude to Love&quot; to hide its subject matter, but was shelved when production head Dore Schary resigned, despite $100,000 having been put into the property to that point. When Schary went to MGM, he purchased the rights to the script from RKO, over the objections of Louis B. Mayer, who believed the public was tired of war films. At MGM, Robert Taylor and Keenan Wynn were reported to have been penciled in for the film, along with Van Johnson and John Hodiak, and the project was budgeted at $2 million. Wellman put the cast through some military training with Robert Taylor, a former navy officer who dropped out believing the role was not right for him. He was replaced by Van Johnson.

Twenty veterans of the 101st were hired to train the actors and appeared in the film as extras. Lt Col Harry Kinnard, who had been the 101st&#x27;s deputy divisional commander at Bastogne, was the film&#x27;s technical advisor. Pirosh also consulted with McAuliffe, who was enthusiastic about Pirosh&#x27;s intention to show World War II strictly from the grunt&#x27;s eye view.

The role of Staff Sergeant Kinnie was first offered to Spencer Tracy, but he turned it down. Wellman and Pirosh&#x27;s second choice was James Whitmore, a Broadway theatre actor and former Marine Corps officer, who also bore resemblance to Tracy. However, the producers insisted a more well-known actor be cast. James Mitchell took on the role, but was fired before shooting, as Wellman thought he lacked the proper physicality and attitude to play a Staff Sergeant.

===Filming===
The film was in production from April 5 to June 3, 1949, with location shooting in northern California, Oregon, and Washington state. Fort Lewis, Washington was used for the tank sequence showing the relief of the 101st Airborne by Patton&#x27;s Third Army. Shooting took 20 days less than was scheduled, due in part to innovative measures taken by Schary such as processing film as it was shot, then dubbing and cutting it so that scenes could be previewed within two days of being shot. The film came in almost $100,000 under budget.

Upon the conclusion of filming, cinematographer Paul C. Vogel described his work in a professional journal:

Except for the opening scenes (filmed at Sawtelle General Hospital) and the climax (shot at Fort McArthur), &quot;Battleground&quot; was filmed indoors on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s Stage 15. This is a cavernous affair, measuring 130x320 feet with a ceiling height of 70 feet, nearly three million cubic feet of air...All lighting...was from overhead...However, it frequently left actors&#x27; faces black under their regulation G.I. helmets. Supplementary lighting for face modelling was used from the floor up...despite the constant 40 degrees temperature maintained by the stepped-up air conditioning system, we discovered that soon after lighting the set each morning, the lamp heat started the air currents flowing—but not always in the same direction! We turned this meteorological oddity to advantage placing our fog machines—spraying vaporized light machine oil—at strategic positions, allowing the indoor currents to waft our fog into the desired place...En passant, the constant fog—chemical, not mental—in which we worked for more than seven weeks killed the desire to smoke. Cinematographers overly addicted to nicotine might try this effective, but drastic cure.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Battleground&quot; received a number of premieres before its general release. A private showing for President Harry S. Truman was arranged even before the premiere in Washington D.C. on November 9, 1949, which was attended by McAuliffe, who commanded the 101st during the siege. Two days later, the film premiered in New York City, and then on December 1 in Los Angeles.

==Reception==
&quot;Battleground&quot; was MGM&#x27;s largest grossing film in five years. According to studio records it earned $4,722,000 in the US and Canada and $1,547,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $2,388,000, making it the studio&#x27;s most profitable picture of the year. It was rated by &quot;Photoplay&quot; as the best picture of the year.

MGM released a similar film in 1951, &quot;Go for Broke!&quot;, also starring Van Johnson and directed by Pirosh.

===Awards and nominations===
The film was nominated for the American Film Institute&#x27;s 2001 list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills.

<doc id="80917" wikidata="Q847471" url="?curid=80917" title="Full Throttle (1995 video game)">
<text>Full Throttle is a 1995 graphic adventure video game developed by LucasArts and designed by Tim Schafer. It was Schafer&#x27;s first game as project lead and head writer and designer, after having worked on other LucasArts titles including &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; (1990), &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1991), and &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot; (1993). Set in the near future, the story follows motorcycle gang leader Ben, who must clear his name after being framed for the murder of a beloved motorcycle manufacturing mogul. A remastered version of the game was developed by Double Fine Productions and was released in April 2017 for Windows, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, with later ports for iOS and Xbox One.

&quot;Full Throttle&quot; was LucasArts&#x27; eleventh adventure game overall and the tenth to use the company&#x27;s in-house game engine, SCUMM. It featured full-motion video and action sequences, using LucasArts&#x27; INSANE animation engine, which was previously utilized in &quot;Star Wars: Rebel Assault II: The Hidden Empire&quot;. It was the first LucasArts game to be distributed only on CD-ROM. as well as the last SCUMM game on MS-DOS. It also introduced a contextual pie menu through which the player controls interactions with objects and characters. In contrast to other computer games of the era, which mostly relied on in-house talent for their voice acting, &quot;Full Throttle&quot; used mostly professional voice actors, including Roy Conrad as Ben, Mark Hamill as the villainous Adrian Ripburger, Hamilton Camp as the elderly Malcolm Corley, and Kath Soucie as Ben&#x27;s ally Maureen. It was one of the few LucasArts games to use licensed music, featuring songs by San Francisco-area rock band The Gone Jackals.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Full Throttle&quot; is a single-player video game in which the player controls the actions of the player character from a third-person perspective using a point and click interface. Players can move the player character to any place on the scene, interact with objects that are highlighted by the cursor, or leave scenes via exits - either on foot for most scenes, or via the character&#x27;s motorbike, both types denoted by their own icon. As with other LucasArts graphic adventure games of the era, dialogue plays a large part in the game, presenting story elements and information necessary to advance, as well as fleshing out the characters. During conversations with other characters, several choices of dialogue are presented. The currently selected choice is highlighted, and once clicked, the player character responds with the selected choice. Choosing the correct response allows the player to advance the conversation and ultimately advance the scene.

Following on from LucasArts&#x27; previous graphic adventure, &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; (1993), which introduced a new inventory and interaction system to replace those of their prior games, &quot;Full Throttle&quot; continued to refine on the changes introduced in &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot;: objects or characters with which Ben can interact are indicated by a red square appearing around the cursor&#x27;s crosshairs when it is placed over the object. When this occurs, holding down the control on this causes a contextual pie menu to appear - designed upon the emblem of Ben&#x27;s biker gang: a flaming circle topped by a skull and flanked by a boot and a gloved hand. The player hovers the cursor over elements of the emblem and then releases the mouse button to attempt various interactions with the object; for example, selecting the skull&#x27;s mouth to speak to a character, its eyes to examine an object, or the hand to pick up, use, or pull the object. Right-clicking anywhere on the screen brings up the player&#x27;s inventory of collected objects, which can be examined or dragged and dropped in order to use them with other items in the inventory, or with objects or characters in the scene.

==Plot==
The last domestic motorcycle manufacturer in the country is Corley Motors, whose founder and CEO, the elderly Malcolm Corley (Hamilton Camp), is en route to a shareholders meeting at the Corley factory, accompanied by his vice president, Adrian Ripburger (Mark Hamill). Malcolm suspects that Ripburger is scheming to take over the company, and is suspicious of Ripburger&#x27;s plan to recruit a biker gang to ride with them to the meeting. Malcolm&#x27;s limousine is overtaken by one such gang, the Polecats, and he is immediately impressed with them. Catching up to them at a biker bar, he quickly befriends their leader, Ben (Roy Conrad). Ripburger offers to hire the Polecats to escort Malcolm to the meeting, but when Ben declines, he is knocked out by Ripburger&#x27;s flunkies, Bolus (Jack Angel) and Nestor (Maurice LaMarche).

Ben awakens to learn that the Polecats have been duped into escorting Malcolm, and that an ambush is planned for them further up the road. He tries to catch up, but his motorcycle has been sabotaged, resulting in a fiery crash. He is rescued by young photographer Miranda (Pat Musick) and taken to the town of Melonweed, where he is treated by a mechanic named Maureen (Kath Soucie). Maureen describes how her father taught her about motorcycles, and repairs Ben&#x27;s bike after he retrieves necessary parts, adding a booster to it as well. Ben catches up to the Polecats at a rest area, but is too late: Ripburger murders Malcolm and frames the Polecats for the crime. Miranda manages to catch the murder on film, but her camera is snatched by Bolus. Before dying, Malcolm tells Ben of Ripburger&#x27;s plan to take over Corley Motors and produce minivans instead of motorcycles. He reveals that Maureen is secretly his illegitimate daughter and begs Ben to convince her to take over the company. Bolus tries to kill Maureen, but she gets the drop on him and escapes with the film from Miranda&#x27;s camera.

With the Polecats jailed for Malcolm&#x27;s murder, Ben is a fugitive. Miranda tells him about her film, and Ben convinces semi-trailer truck driver Emmet to sneak him and his motorcycle past a police roadblock and to an abandoned mink farm where Maureen is hiding. He is stranded there when Emmet steals his motorcycle&#x27;s fuel line and Maureen steals his booster fuel. Emmet&#x27;s truck is blown up by a biker gang called the Cavefish, destroying the bridge over Poyahoga Gorge, which Ben needs to cross. Having replaced his fuel line and gotten advice from the Polecats&#x27; former leader, Father Torque (Hamilton Camp), Ben outwits Nestor and Bolus and does battle with members of rival biker gangs in order to acquire hover equipment, booster fuel, and a ramp, with which he is able to jump his motorcycle over the gorge.

Ben locates Maureen, who is a member of rival biker gang the Vultures, at the Vulture&#x27;s hideout, a large cargo aircraft. Maureen believes Ben killed her father and is about to have him executed, but Ben reveals personal information that Malcolm shared with him and convinces her to develop Miranda&#x27;s film, which shows that Ripburger was the murderer. Ben suggests exposing Ripburger at the shareholders meeting, but Ripburger has postponed the meeting until he is sure Ben and Maureen are dead. The Vultures come up with a plan to fake Ben and Maureen&#x27;s deaths by entering them in a demolition derby under false identities that will be obvious to Ripburger. Their cars are rigged to explode, but Ben is protected by a fireproof suit and Maureen&#x27;s car ejects her safely out of the stadium. The plan works and results in the deaths of Bolus and Nestor, while the Vultures recover the winner&#x27;s prize: a special motorcycle built by Malcolm and Maureen that contains a hidden pass code to Malcolm&#x27;s safe, in which Ben finds Malcolm&#x27;s recorded will and testament. Ben exposes Ripburger during the shareholders meeting by projecting Miranda&#x27;s photos of the murder and playing Malcolm&#x27;s will, in which he leaves leadership of Corley Motors to Maureen and exposes Ripburger as a sham.

Ripburger flees in a semi-trailer truck, but as Ben and Maureen ride away he reappears and rams them. The Vultures arrive driving their flightless cargo plane, which scoops up the truck along with Ben, Maureen, and Ben&#x27;s bike. The plane and truck wind up hanging precariously over the edge of Poyahoga Gorge, and Ripburger falls to his death. Maureen and the Vultures flee the plane while Ben makes it out at the last second by jumping his bike out the back cargo door just as the truck explodes and it and the plane fall into the gorge. Members of the biker gangs attend Malcolm&#x27;s funeral, at which Father Torque delivers a eulogy. Maureen takes over Corley Motors, and Ben rides away into the sunset.

==Development==
The concept of &quot;Full Throttle&quot; originated following the 1993 release of LucasArts’ previous adventure game &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot;. The company wanted to create a game that could revitalize the genre, and could offer LucasArts greater financial success than its earlier projects, such as the commercially unsuccessful &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series. Convening its designers, LucasArts expressed to them the idea and encouraged the staff to suggest potential conceptual avenues for the game. The company specifically asked &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot; co-designers Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman to submit a design document outlining games that the two planned to develop afterward. At LucasArts’ request, Schafer and Grossman collaborated to propose prospective third entries in the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; series. However, Schafer was willing to helm a project by himself, and he proceeded to develop concepts separately from Grossman that summer. &quot;Full Throttle&quot; was among the five concepts that Schafer submitted to LucasArts; according to Schafer, he produced &quot;a pitch for a spy game, a Day of the Dead game, and a biker game&quot; that later evolved into &quot;Full Throttle&quot;. Schafer later said that management &quot;hated&quot; the initial pitch, but he revised the design and repitched it with greater success. &quot;Edge&quot; reported that &quot;it was eventually greenlit on Schafer&#x27;s assurance that it would be a hit&quot;, as he felt that its protagonist and concept were &quot;more commercial&quot; than the company&#x27;s earlier adventures.

According to Schafer, he came up with the idea for &quot;Full Throttle&quot; while listening to a traveller&#x27;s tales about time spent in an Alaskan biker bar. As he listened, it occurred to him that &quot;bikers are kind of like pirates — like another culture that people don&#x27;t have a window into most of the time, but [which] has its own rules&quot;, and might provide a neat alternative to a fantasy setting. He began his research into biker culture, reading Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs&quot;. The game originally would have featured an interactive sequence where Ben undergoes a peyote-induced hallucinogenic trip. This was eventually cut from the game, because the developers couldn&#x27;t get it to &quot;work out&quot; with the publisher. The concept eventually became the basis of &quot;Psychonauts&quot;. Schafer recalls the reaction from the management at LucasArts as being one of &quot;&#x27;We can&#x27;t believe we paid you to write this&#x27;&quot;. &quot;They hated it&quot;. In an interview with Gamasutra, Schafer said that the biker aesthetics of the game were an appeal to fantasy. He stated that the team was depending &quot;on the [player&#x27;s] secret desire to be a biker: big, tough, cool. Riding a huge hog...&quot; On the game&#x27;s setting he noted that often it was mistaken for a post apocalyptic world, but he clarified that the setting was simply an alternate world which was more desolate than our own.

Developed for CD-ROM with a budget of $1.5 million, &quot;Full Throttle&quot; was powered primarily by LucasArts&#x27; SCUMM engine, however elements of the company&#x27;s INSANE animation engine, previously used in &quot;Star Wars: Rebel Assault II: The Hidden Empire&quot;, were also implemented so as to allow for improved full-motion video (FMV). The game featured completely voiced dialogue, full-motion video, and a digital audio soundtrack. Project leader Schafer also served as the game&#x27;s writer and designer. &quot;Full Throttle&quot; has thus been called Schafer&#x27;s first &quot;solo&quot; project, leading Schafer to quip, &quot;I did it all on my own with about 30 other people&quot;. Production lasted one and a half years, which Schafer considered to be &quot;crazy&quot; for the era.

&quot;Full Throttle&quot; employed several skilled voice acting professionals, such as Roy Conrad, Kath Soucie, Maurice LaMarche, Tress MacNeille, Hamilton Camp, Steven Jay Blum and Mark Hamill. &quot;Full Throttle&quot; was the first computer game to employ mostly SAG-registered professional voice actors instead of relying on in-house talent, and also featured a few pieces of licensed music. Schafer stated that Conrad&#x27;s voice was a &quot;huge part of making Ben Throttle a charming character&quot;. It was one of the few LucasArts games to use externally recorded music, courtesy of The Gone Jackals. Certain tracks from their album, &quot;Bone to Pick&quot;, were featured in the game.

== Release ==
&quot;Full Throttle&quot; was released on May 19, 1995. At the time of its release, LucasArts adventure games were aiming to sell about 100,000 copies; &quot;Full Throttle&quot; broke that mark by selling over one million units. According to &quot;Edge&quot;, it was the very first LucasArts adventure to reach this number.

==Reception==
At aggregate review website Metacritic the game received generally favorable reviews, and has over time become a cult classic among adventure games. Critics generally praised the game&#x27;s animation, voice acting and soundtrack, but many reviewers felt the game was too short.

A &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewer called &quot;Full Throttle&quot; &quot;the kind of game the Mac was meant for&quot; and &quot;a sheer joy to behold, even if you loathed &quot;Monkey Island&quot; with a seething, purple passion&quot;. Citing the futuristic setting, &quot;kick-butt&quot; soundtrack, outstanding voice acting, understated humor, and overall cinematic presentation, the reviewer gave it four out of five stars. &quot;Full Throttle&quot; later won &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1995 Readers&#x27; Choice award for &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot;, although it was not among the editors&#x27; nominees. &quot;PC Gamer&quot;&#x27;s Steve Poole also praised the game&#x27;s sound, citing both the inclusion of The Gone Jackals&#x27; music and the professional voice acting as points of high praise. Poole did note that puzzles can at times be too simple, with an aesthetic of &quot;find item A to use on item B&quot;. Commenting on the game&#x27;s length, he noted that while short, &quot;it&#x27;s one wild ride while it lasts&quot;. Bernard H. Yee of &quot;PC Magazine&quot; had similar thoughts in his review. He too felt the game was short, but praised the game&#x27;s cartoon-like animation and visuals, voice acting and soundtrack. He noted that some adventure gamers might &quot;grouse at the action-arcade fight sequences or grumble at the long narrative sequences&quot; but felt that the game as &quot;impressive and attention-grabbing&quot;. &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s editors later presented the game with a &quot;Special Achievement in Musical Score&quot; award, and argued that it &quot;showed the world that every game can benefit greatly from a good musical score&quot;. The editors nominated &quot;Full Throttle&quot; as their 1995 &quot;Best Adventure Game&quot;, although it lost to &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head in Virtual Stupidity&quot;.

Charles Ardai of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; felt that the puzzles were not challenging enough compared to similar games of the era. He did note that this was the &quot;ideal starter game&quot; for those players who were not comfortable with more complex and difficult puzzles. Ardai stated that players experienced in the adventure genre could still enjoy the game by treating it as a &quot;highly interactive movie&quot;. Macworld&#x27;s Tom Negrino felt that the new pie menu system was a refreshing change to the traditional adventure game interface. He also gave high marks for the lack of a game over sequence and noted that any time the player fails a sequence it simply resets. He further praised the game&#x27;s writing, voice acting and soundtrack. In a review for GameSpot Jeffrey Adam called &quot;Full Throttle&quot; &quot;arguably LucasArts&#x27; finest graphic adventure creation&quot;. Adam did note two flaws in his review. The first is during on-motorcycle action sequences with rival gang members, in which he notes that, even considering an unlimited number of attempts, the sequences relied too much on twitch responses. The second frustration Adam noted was that he felt sometimes he resorted to randomly clicking on whole areas of the screen in hopes of finding a clue. He felt that this method did not allow players to use deductive reasoning.

The game&#x27;s humor was praised by &quot;PC Gamer&quot;″s Steve Poole for its many LucasFilm and other cultural references. Specifically he cited two &quot;Star Wars&quot; references in the game. The first is during the demolition derby sequence in which rival driver is illustrated to look like George Lucas. The second is during a scene where Ben is talking to the reporter, Miranda. She says &quot;Help me Ben, you&#x27;re my only hope!&quot;, a play on Princess Leia&#x27;s dialogue to Obi-Wan Kenobi from &quot;Star Wars: A New Hope&quot;. Other references found by Poole were nods to the 1964 film &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and the 1993 LucasArts adventure game &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the game a B+ and praised the soundtrack, and the humor.

&quot;Full Throttle&quot; was the second-place finalist for &quot;Computer Game Review&quot;″s 1995 &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; award, which went to &quot;Mission Critical&quot;. The editors noted that &quot;it had wonderful graphics, animation and voice work and the story was good, too&quot;. It was also a finalist for &quot;MacUser&quot;″s award for the best strategy game of 1995, which went to &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Cancelled sequels===
In spring 2000, LucasArts began production of &quot;Full Throttle 2&quot;, an official sequel to continue the storyline of &quot;Full Throttle&quot;. Since Tim Schafer had already left the company at the time, Larry Ahern, who was involved in the original game&#x27;s development, was appointed the project lead and Bill Tiller, the art director. The story would have focused on Ben&#x27;s efforts to foil a plan by a &quot;large corporation&quot; and the local governor to replace all paved highways with hover pads, robbing the bikers and truckers of their traditional ground. In the first half of the game, Ben would have prevented an assassination attempt on Father Torque, who now leads the anti-hovercraft rally, then team up with a &quot;persistent undercover female reporter&quot; to bring down the villainous governor. In Tiller&#x27;s opinion, the sequel &quot;was going to capture the feel of the first game yet expand upon the milieu&quot;. At the early stages, the project received positive feedback from other LucasArts employees but according to Tiller, it eventually fell apart because of disagreements on the game style between the production team and &quot;a particularly influential person&quot; within the management, which led to a series of &quot;mistakes&quot;. The production ceased in November 2000, when 25% of the levels and about 40% of the preproduction art were complete. LucasArts never released an official statement regarding the game cancellation. Both Ahern and Tiller left LucasArts in 2001, after the game was cancelled.

In mid-2002, LucasArts announced &quot;Full Throttle: Hell on Wheels&quot; for Windows and, for the first time, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The game was to be an action-adventure, with more emphasis on action and fighting than adventure, because the designers wanted the game to feel more physical than the first. &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; would have been set in El Nada, Ben&#x27;s &quot;old stomping ground&quot;, whose roads have been mysteriously destroyed. Ben believes that one of the new gangs introduced in the game, the Hound Dogs, are behind this but soon discovers a more sinister and murderous plot. Together with Father Torque and Maureen, he would have thwarted the unnamed villain&#x27;s plan and protected &quot;the freedom of the open road&quot;. Sean Clark was named the project lead of &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; and the development progressed smoothly until late 2003, when it was abruptly canceled. Just months prior to that, at E3 2003, a playable demo was shown and a teaser trailer was released by LucasArts. Simon Jeffery (then president of LucasArts) said that &quot;We do not want to disappoint the many fans of &quot;Full Throttle&quot;, and hope everyone can understand how committed we are to delivering the best-quality gaming experience that we possibly can&quot; in the official press release. Critics cited poor graphics compared to other 3D action adventures of the time and Tim Schafer&#x27;s lack of involvement in the project as possible reasons for its cancellation. Additionally, Roy Conrad, the original voice actor for Ben, died in 2002.

Critics considered development of new sequels to &quot;Full Throttle&quot; unlikely. LucasArts&#x27; interest shifted away from the adventure genre in later years, and failure to develop two sequels presumably hindered the possibility of a third. Also, nearly all developers who were involved with the original &quot;Full Throttle&quot; in 1995 had since left LucasArts. LucasArts ceased all internal development in 2013, shortly after their parent company Lucasfilm was purchased by The Walt Disney Company. In a 2017 interview discussing the work on the remaster, Schafer said that he feels that the story of &quot;Full Throttle&quot; was essentially complete with the game, and does not envision creating a sequel himself.

===&quot;Remastered&quot;===
A remastered version of &quot;Full Throttle&quot;, titled &quot;Full Throttle Remastered&quot;, was developed by Schafer&#x27;s Double Fine Productions for release on Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. The PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita versions are cross-buy and cross-save. The remastered version was released on April 18, 2017. Like &quot;Day of the Tentacle Remastered&quot; and &quot;Grim Fandango Remastered&quot;, the remastered version of &quot;Full Throttle&quot; includes updated graphics and sound, improved controls, and developer commentary. Similarly, the game allows the player to swap between the original graphics and sound with the remastered versions.

The game uses the original voice actors&#x27; dialog pulled from the original recordings, with Schafer calling Conrad&#x27;s voice &quot;irreplaceable&quot;. The remastered version premiered at the 2017 Game Developers Conference, where Schafer presented a remaking of a magazine pack-in demo that included recorded lines that had not been included in the full game. Schafer said that fans had been critical of &quot;Full Throttle&quot;″s relatively short length of about eight hours compared to other LucasArts games at the time which could take up to 40 hours. However, as he worked at the remaster, player expectations have changed, and he felt that &quot;Full Throttle&quot; would be much better suited at its length in 2017, comparing it to other fully polished, short games like &quot;Inside&quot;.

A port for the Xbox One was released on October 29, 2020.

===Potential film adaptation===
Duncan Jones had written a screenplay based on &quot;Full Throttle&quot; in 2021, and reached out to fans of the game in 2022 to try to help convince Disney to fund production of the work for the Disney+ service.

<text>A Letter to Three Wives is a 1949 American romantic drama directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and starring Jeanne Crain, Linda Darnell and Ann Sothern. The film was adapted by Vera Caspary and written for the screen by Mankiewicz from &quot;A Letter to Five Wives&quot;, a story by John Klempner that appeared in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, based on Klempner&#x27;s 1945 novel.

The film won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Picture.

==Plot==
Friends Deborah Bishop, Rita Phipps and Lora Mae Hollingsway are just about to take a group of children on a riverboat outing when they receive a message from Addie Ross informing them that she has taken one of their husbands as a lover. However, Addie does not specify which woman&#x27;s husband is involved in the affair. In flashbacks, each woman considers reasons why it might be her husband.

The first flashback involves Deborah, who was raised on a farm. Her first experience with the outside world came when she joined the Navy WAVES during World War II, where she met her future husband Brad. When they return to civilian life, Deborah does not feel welcome in Brad&#x27;s sophisticated social circle. Adding to her insecurity, she learns that everyone expected Brad to marry Addie, a woman on whom all three husbands lavish their attention.

Deborah is comforted by Brad&#x27;s friend Rita, who writes stories for radio soap operas. Her husband George is an English teacher. While Rita wishes that George would be more ambitious, he is disappointed that his wife caters to her boss, Mrs. Manleigh. Rita is so intent on pleasing Mrs. Manleigh that she forgets her husband&#x27;s birthday and invites the Manleighs for dinner. George forgives Rita&#x27;s mistake but, to George&#x27;s delight, a birthday gift of a rare Brahms recording arrives from Addie.

Lora Mae grew up in poverty. She pursues Porter, the older, divorced owner of a statewide chain of department stores where she works. Matters come to a head when Lora Mae sees a picture of Addie on the piano in Porter&#x27;s mansion. She tells him that she wants her picture on a piano and his home to become hers. He tells her that he is not interested in marriage, and she ends the relationship. However, he proposes to Lora Mae and skips a party at Addie&#x27;s house.

Back in real time, the women return from the outing. Rita is overjoyed to find George at home after attending a play rehearsal. They reconcile and she vows to not allow herself to be at Mrs. Manleigh&#x27;s mercy any longer.

Porter is late coming home, causing Lora Mae to think he has left with Addie. When he appears and hears his wife&#x27;s suspicions, he accuses her of being happy at the thought of establishing grounds to divorce him and reap a big chunk of his fortune.

A domestic worker tells Deborah that Brad will not be coming home that night. Heartbroken at her perceived loss, she visits the country club dance unaccompanied along with the two other couples.

When Porter complains about Lora Mae dancing with another man, Deborah tells him that he has no idea how much she really loves him; still, Porter is certain that Lora Mae only sees him as a money source. Unable to take the strain any longer, Deborah decides to leave, announcing that Brad has left with Addie. Porter stops her, confessing it was he who planned to flee with Addie, but had changed his mind. As Deborah happily leaves to find her late-working husband, Porter tells Lora Mae that admitting his intended abandonment in front of witnesses is enough for her to divorce him and claim everything she wants. To his shock, she declares that she did not hear a word he said. Finally convinced of her love, Porter is overjoyed and asks her to dance.

The melancholy voice of the still unseen Addie Ross then bids the audience a good night.

==Production==

=== Script ===
Seven months after it was first published in a magazine, film rights to John Klempner&#x27;s &quot;A Letter to Five Wives&quot; were acquired by 20th Century-Fox in February 1946. Melville Baker and Dorothy Bennett wrote the first treatments of the script. Although he was not credited for the final film, Baker offered the idea for the character of Addie to be heard but not seen. In October 1946, F. Hugh Herbert was assigned to write the screen adaptation. His final participation was not confirmed.

The project was shelved until Mankiewicz returned to work on drafts of the script between March and late April 1948. Studio head Darryl F. Zanuck and Mankiewicz decided in mid-1948 to reduce the number of marriages to three, and Vera Caspary adapted the story to &quot;A Letter to Four Wives&quot;. By June 1948, the project was listed at the top of 20th Century-Fox&#x27;s films to be produced over the following ten months.

==== Casting ====
Even before a script was finished, Gene Tierney, Linda Darnell, Maureen O&#x27;Hara, Dorothy McGuire and Alice Faye were cast in the proposed &quot;A Letter to Five Wives&quot; in November 1946. To reduce expenses, the studio removed Tierney&#x27;s role. By May 1948, Anne Baxter, Crain, Darnell and Sothern were set to play the title roles, and Macdonald Carey campaigned for a secondary role. Baxter&#x27;s part was eliminated when Mankiewicz and studio head Darryl F. Zanuck reduced the number of wives to three. Joan Crawford, Ida Lupino and Tallulah Bankhead all desired to play the unbilled voice role of Addie that was awarded to Celeste Holm.

In October 1946, it was announced that Samuel G. Engel had assumed producer duties, but Sol C. Siegel replaced Engel in 1948.

=== Filming ===
Production began in early June 1948.

The scenes on the riverboat were filmed on the Hudson River in Cold Spring, New York, and the children were underprivileged students from the Paulist School in New York&#x27;s Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood who were each paid $15 per day. Other area filming locations included Lake Mahopac, Stamford, Connecticut and Hook Mountain State Park.

Darnell and Sothern were reported to have feuded on set.

==Differences between novel and film==

John Klempner&#x27;s novel was titled &quot;A Letter to Five Wives&quot;, but two wives were dropped in the transition to the screen. Joseph L. Mankiewicz intended for the fourth wife to be the granddaughter of the state&#x27;s governor but said &quot;we never got around to her.&quot;

All of the major characters differ substantially between the novel and film, as do the nature of the problems with their marriages. In the novel, Lora May is not a gold-digger but a woman who has always been dominated by her wealthy husband; Rita is trying to succeed in a second marriage with a man about whom she has never felt passionate; and Deborah is a former spinster whose husband is disappointed by her lack of success in society. The two wives who do not appear in the film are Martha, who argues with her husband about child-rearing issues, and Geraldine, who devotes herself to her singing career with meager results.

The novel also provides no indication that any of the couples will work through their problems, and the identity of the unfaithful husband is different from that within the film, although his rationale is the same.

== Release ==
&quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot; was made available for preview by critics in December 1948, including the National Legion of Decency, which classified the film as A-III (for adults only).

The film premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York on January 20, 1949.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Bosley Crowther wrote:[I]n the reflections of these ladies, Mr. Mankiewicz cleverly evolves an interesting cross-sectioned picture of the small-town younger-married set. And as writer as well as director, he has capably brought forth a film which has humor, , satire and gratifying romance. The fact that so many paces are put on display in this film forewarns that a certain unevenness is likely to occur. And it must be admitted frankly that the whole thing is not in perfect time. The earlier phases are draggy and just a bit obvious. ... But the final romantic remembrance—that of the hard-boiled wife—is a taut and explosive piece of satire, as funny and as poignant as it is shrewd. ... It wouldn&#x27;t be fair to tell you whose husband it is that runs away. But the outcome is thoroughly satisfactory—and so is the film—by us.In the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, reviewer Mae Tinee wrote: &quot;Here&#x27;s a picture that actually deserves some of the adjectives so often lavished on Hollywood products. It&#x27;s smart, cute and funny—well- rounded entertainment of a sort that&#x27;s all too rare these days. ... The conclusion is a clever mixture of humor and pathos—and the film so expert that you hate to see it end.&quot;

Critic Edwin Schallert of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Its ultimate message is to put trust in your husband, though it never states this with any bald emphasis. ... The picture is likely to score a noteworthy hit especially with the feminine audience.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s review praised the film, especially its &quot;unique story&quot; being given &quot;a nifty screenplay.&quot;

==Adaptations==
In 1985, the film was remade as a television movie of the same name starring Loni Anderson as Lora Mae, Michele Lee as Rita, Stephanie Zimbalist as Debra, Charles Frank as Brad, Michael Gross as George and Ben Gazzara as Porter, with Ann Sothern appearing in a small role.

==In popular culture==
The 21st-season episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;Moe Letter Blues&quot; parodies the plot of &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot;.

<doc id="80928" wikidata="Q1411498" url="?curid=80928" title="The Dig (video game)">
<text>The Dig is a 1995 point-and-click adventure game developed by LucasArts for PC and Macintosh. Like other LucasArts adventure games, it uses the SCUMM video game engine, as well as the last SCUMM game on MS-DOS. It features a full voice-acting cast, including voice actors Robert Patrick and Steve Blum, and a digital orchestral score. The game uses a combination of drawn two-dimensional artwork and limited, pre-rendered three-dimensional clips, with the latter created by Industrial Light &amp; Magic.

The game is inspired by an idea originally created for Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; series. Unlike other LucasArts adventure games, which typically includes humor, &quot;The Dig&quot; took a somber approach to its science fiction motif. In the game, the player takes the role of Commander Boston Low, part of a five-man team planting explosives on an asteroid in order to avert its collision course with Earth. Discovering the asteroid is hollow, Low and two of his team are transported to a long-abandoned complex, filled with advanced technology, on a strange alien world. Low and his companions must utilize xenoarchaeology to learn how the technology works, discover the fate of the alien race that built it, and solve other mysteries to find a way to return home.

&quot;The Dig&quot; received mixed-to-positive reviews, with critics primarily praising its atmosphere and soundtrack. Multiple reviewers said the game&#x27;s puzzles were too difficult, and other aspects, such as its graphics, voice acting, and dialogue, received mixed receptions. A novelization was written by science fiction author Alan Dean Foster in conjunction with the game&#x27;s development.

==Gameplay==
&quot;The Dig&quot; is a point-and-click adventure game, where the player, as Commander Boston Low, uses the mouse cursor to point to people, objects, and other parts of the environment to look at or interact with them, collect and use items in their inventory, and talk to non-player characters. The game runs on the SCUMM game engine, and was the eleventh LucasArts game to do so. A minigame can be found on the communicator menu, consisting of &quot;Asteroid Lander&quot;, a &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; like game. During development, there were plans to include role-playing game elements, but these were scrapped before the game&#x27;s release.

==Plot==
A radio telescope detects the approach of a large asteroid on a collision course with Earth; authorities dub it &quot;Attila&quot; after the ancient conqueror Attila the Hun. Scientists determine explosives planted on the surface of the asteroid may divert it into a stable orbit around Earth. A five-person expedition uses the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; to rendezvous with the asteroid and plant the charges. The crew consists of Commander Boston Low (voiced by Robert Patrick); Dr. Ludger Brink (Steven Blum), a German archaeologist and geologist; Maggie Robbins (Mari Weiss), a linguistics expert and reporter; pilot Ken Borden (David Lodge); and NASA technician Cora Miles (Leilani Jones), who is also running for Congress.

Low, Brink, and Robbins spacewalk to the asteroid and set the charges. While they are successful in altering the orbit of Attila, they find the inside of the asteroid appears hollow, and proceed to explore. When they enter a central chamber, they are trapped as the asteroid transforms into a dodecahedron pod and rapidly accelerates away into deep space. When the three recover and can exit the pod, they find themselves on an alien planet, on a central island surrounded by five smaller, spire-shaped islands; in the game&#x27;s novelization, they name the planet Cocytus. It shows signs of former intelligent life, but as they explore, they find no evidence of any sentient creatures that remain, and the one advanced complex they are in shows signs of long-term deterioration. They encounter a strange form of spirit-like energy that guides them to a particular patch of ground, which they find to be soft and consistent with an opening that has been buried by time. Shortly after Brink begins digging, the ground gives way beneath him, opening a cavern into a subterranean structure. Robbins and Low find Brink dead at the bottom of the rubble.

Robbins insists they explore the structure separately and the two part ways, keeping in contact with their communicators. In what appears to be a museum, Low discovers a pair of crystals containing a glowing green liquid. After seeing a demonstration in the museum of similar crystals being used in what looks like a resurrection ceremony, Low tries one on Brink, bringing him back to life. They search for a means to return to Earth, using Brink&#x27;s and Robbins&#x27; talents for xenoarchaeology to decipher alien text and images.

As the trio continue to explore, they find Brink has become addicted to the crystals and started hoarding them for himself, leading to conflict within the group. Low discovers a pyramid that houses a preserved alien, whom he is able to reanimate by use of the life crystals. Through Robbins, the alien explains that his species had become obsessed with eternal life and had decided to travel to a new universe, Spacetime Six, from the current one, which they call Spacetime Four. The alien chose to remain behind to warn others about the crystals and the dangers of transcending to Spacetime Six. However, the rest of the species have been unable to find a way to return to Spacetime Four, and only they would be able to provide the humans with a spacecraft to return to Earth.

Low offers to travel to Spacetime Six to show the aliens how to return, but this requires them to repower the portal that was used. They are able to retrieve two life crystals from a machine that generates them, but Low and Brink fight over the crystals, and Brink falls to his death. During the process of opening the portal, Robbins is killed. The player has the option of reviving Robbins with a life crystal after the portal is opened; however, if they do, she immediately jumps to her death, with no crystals left to revive her a second time. With no other options, Low uses the portal to meet the rest of the aliens in Spacetime Six; with the portal open, the aliens can perceive the route home and return to Cocytus. They restore Brink and Robbins to life and cure Brink of his addiction to the crystals, though this leaves him as an elderly man. If Low left Robbins dead, she is happy to see him, but if Low revived her, she is angry and scorns him. As promised, the aliens reconstruct a spacecraft for the humans, and representatives of the species join the humans as they return to Earth.

==Development==
&quot;The Dig&quot; was originally conceived by Steven Spielberg as an episode of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, and later as a film, but was later concluded that the concept would be prohibitively expensive to film. As a result, the idea was temporarily shelved. Eventually, it was decided the story could be adapted into the adventure game format. The initial video game design meeting was held in 1989 at Skywalker Ranch; it included Spielberg, George Lucas, Ron Gilbert, and Noah Falstein, the latter two of whom had created a video game based on &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; that had impressed Spielberg. Writing is credited to Spielberg, author Orson Scott Card, who wrote the dialogue, and interactive fiction author Brian Moriarty, whose previous LucasArts engagement was with &quot;Loom&quot;. Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) created some of the CG imagery.

&quot;The Dig&quot; had by far the longest development time of all LucasArts adventure games. The game&#x27;s design team met for the first time at the Skywalker Ranch on the day the 1989 San Francisco earthquake struck. The game was not released until 1995. During its development there were four successive project leaders, starting with Falstein, followed by Moriarty, then Dave Grossman. &quot;The Dig&quot;″s final project leader was LucasArts&#x27; Sean Clark.

The original production involved a story that took place in the distant future. In this story, a crew of explorers in a spaceship visit an abandoned planet, discovering signs of an extraterrestrial civilization that left behind technological artifacts. The explorers initially assume that the occupants of the planet had died off, seeing no sign of them, but as the story progresses, the player was meant to discover something very different. This premise is similar to the finished game&#x27;s story, but contains clear differences.

When Moriarty took over, he decided to start again from scratch. This version of the production was more similar to the released game, but it contained one extra character: a Japanese business tycoon and science-hobbyist named Toshi Olema, who uses his money to buy his way onto the Attila project crew. Toshi would have met a gruesome death when he stumbled into a cavern with acid dripping from the ceiling, and the other astronauts would have been unable to safely retrieve his body and bring him back with life crystals. He was later removed from the story. This version of the game was very bloody and intended for an adult audience. Initially, Spielberg thought this feel was very fitting. After the release of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; in 1993, Spielberg received numerous complaints from parents who had ignored the PG-13 rating and brought their young children to see the film, only to discover that it contained some sequences of horror, blood, and violence. Thus, worrying that parents would make a similar mistake and purchase &quot;The Dig&quot; for their children, Spielberg requested the violence be toned down. Other notable design ideas which were dropped during the game&#x27;s production include a survival game angle, which forced the player to keep water and food supplies for life support, and exploration of cities on the planet. Although &quot;The Dig&quot; was announced for release in Q2 1992, it ultimately did not launch until December 1995.

The game was re-released using the Steam content delivery system on July 8, 2009.

==Soundtrack==
Final project leader Sean Clark said the music of &quot;The Dig&quot; was crucial in &quot;establishing the overall mood of the piece&quot;. During production, LucasArts desired a soundtrack with a &quot;Wagnerian&quot; feeling. Composed by Michael Land, the music consisted of Land&#x27;s original score performed on a Kurzweil K2000 synthesizer, enriched by hundreds of short chord samples from the works of Wagner. Land cited the music he personally composed for &quot;The Dig&quot; as the type closest to his own individual style.

The music is relatively static during most of the game, used more as a backdrop than a prominent aspect of gameplay, and has been described as consisting mostly of &quot;vague cadenzas, modulations and movements without much consequence for the material&quot;. When important sequences and cut scenes occur, however, the music comes to the forefront and becomes significantly more dynamic.

&quot;The Dig&quot; was the first LucasArts game to have its soundtrack sold separately as an audio CD, adapted as a linear continuity of finite pieces. Land played the piano and synthesizer and produced the album. He was assisted by Hans Christian Reumschüssel (cello), Emily Bezar (vocals), and Paul McCandless (woodwinds). The soundtrack was bundled with a CD-ROM that included demos for five LucasArts games, and was intended as a first step in cross-promotional efforts.

==Reception==

According to LucasArts, &quot;The Dig&quot;″s global sales reached 300,000 copies by early 1998, the highest sales of a LucasArts adventure title at the time of its release. However, the company&#x27;s Bill Tiller later said that upper management considered it a commercial letdown, and speculated that its &quot;budget had run so high that it couldn&#x27;t make its money back.&quot; He remarked, &quot;The whole project had been way over hyped. I think Lucas Arts management thought it would make a bazillion dollars, and when it sold a substantial amount less than a bazillion dollars, they were disappointed.&quot;

&quot;The Dig&quot;″s graphics, voice acting, and writing were given an uneven reception by critics. Its puzzles were generally viewed as more difficult than most LucasArts games. However, the cut scenes were more favorably received, and the music was universally praised.

Evan Dickens of Adventure Gamers stated, &quot;&quot;The Dig&quot; is a lot more reminiscent of &quot;Myst&quot; than any other LucasArts adventure.&quot; He said the game was a bit too difficult, with very challenging puzzles. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; similarly said that the puzzles were generally more frustrating than in other LucasArts games, citing as an example a door puzzle for which the clues &quot;are so confusingly drawn&quot; that the player ultimately must use trial and error. GameSpot&#x27;s Jeffrey Adam Young agreed, saying of the puzzles, &quot;some follow logic, others just call for trial and error, and yet others will leave you clueless&quot;. A reviewer for &quot;Maximum&quot; disagreed, saying that &quot;with the exception of one or two that were just too obscure, [the puzzles are] set at just the right level to keep a serious adventure freak riveted (and not too hacked off).&quot; Joshua Roberts of Allgame praised the puzzles, saying there were &quot;only a few real brain twisters&quot; and that most could be solved with patience and consideration. Bernard H. Yee of &quot;PC Magazine&quot; said that some of the puzzles were &quot;a bit more frustrating than others&quot;.

Dickens noted that the graphics looked a bit dated. Roberts was more complimentary, saying, &quot;You&#x27;ll be impressed with the scope of the alien landscape&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; praised the visuals as becoming &quot;more and more bizarre&quot; as Low goes deeper into the alien world. The reviewer for &quot;Maximum&quot; acknowledged that the graphics were stylistically outdated, but still considered them &quot;stunning&quot;. Young called the character animations &quot;tired&quot; and &quot;lo-res&quot;. Yee was also unimpressed, saying the graphics are &quot;a bit blocky&quot; and commenting that the characters &quot;lack fine detail&quot;. Dickens felt the cut scenes animated by ILM were excellent, as did Yee, who said they have a &quot;truly grand, cinematic feel&quot;.

Dickens had mixed feelings about the game&#x27;s audio, calling its score &quot;majestic&quot; and saying it was the best part of the game. At the same time, he thought the voice acting was &quot;mediocre&quot;, saying Robert Patrick was the right voice for protagonist Boston Low, but that he missed some emotional nuances in his portrayal. Young thought the voice acting was acceptable but &quot;stereotypical.&quot; He also noted the &quot;grand music score&quot; as the highlight of the game. Yee called the voice acting &quot;top notch&quot; and compared it favorably with &quot;Full Throttle&quot;.

Dickens thought the writing was hit and miss, panning the dialogue as &quot;relentlessly cheesy and clichéd&quot;, but approving of the overall storyline and its suspenseful atmosphere. The reviewer for &quot;Maximum&quot; noted that the story has a much more serious tone than LucasArts&#x27; usual wacky fare, and praised the &quot;well developed storyline and characters&quot;. Young commented that the game takes itself too seriously to be as enjoyable as other, funnier LucasArts games such as &quot;Full Throttle&quot;, and said the dialogue was &quot;deplorable&quot;. Roberts disagreed, calling it &quot;excellent&quot; and saying Low was a &quot;likable&quot; character.

Yee summarized his review by saying, &quot;&quot;The Dig&quot; brings otherworldly adventure, a real sense of exploration, and a true cinematic style to your earthbound PC.&quot; Young said, &quot;In almost every sense, &quot;The Dig&quot; represents a leap backwards from LucasArts&#x27; previous group of adventure games.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot;″s reviewer assessed, &quot;Although it&#x27;s not perfect, &quot;The Dig&quot; is yet another solid graphic adventure [from LucasArts] with some great attributes.&quot; &quot;Maximum&quot; stated &quot;We have no hesitation in recommending this to all adventure fanatics, though inexperienced adventurers may want to wet their feet with something a little less taxing the first time out.&quot; Roberts concluded his review by saying, &quot;&quot;The Dig&quot; is the kind of adventure we&#x27;ve all come to expect from LucasArts. With an imaginative story, an attractive visual backdrop and a wealth of intelligent puzzles, it belongs near the top of the adventure game class.&quot; Dickens recommended &quot;The Dig&quot; to science fiction fans more than average gamers.

Its soundtrack was well received. Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online gave the soundtrack 9 out of 10, calling it &quot;accessible yet abstract, simple yet deep&quot;. About &quot;Mission to the Asteroid&quot;, the opening song, he wrote, &quot;Much of the composition conveys beauty and serenity, yet there is a certain tragic element created with the sweeping chord changes and sometimes elegiac motifs&quot;. He noted that while much of the album is quite ambient and subdued, it contains numerous subtle variations in its themes. He concluded by saying the album is &quot;surprisingly fulfilling even on a stand-alone basis&quot; and that it &quot;never fails to immerse and fascinate me&quot;.

In 2011, Adventure Gamers rated &quot;The Dig&quot; at No. 92 on its list of the 100 best adventure games of all time, noting that gamers did not know what to make of the game at the time of its release, but adding, &quot;Strip away the preconceptions, however, and what’s left is a very good game in its own right&quot;. In 1996, GamesMaster ranked The Dig 75th on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot;

==Novel==
Science fiction author Alan Dean Foster, known for having written novelizations of films such as &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Alien 3&quot;, wrote a novel based on &quot;The Dig&quot;. An audiobook version of the novel was also released.

The novel is not completely consistent with the game, and sections of the story are presented from the point-of-view of the indigenous alien civilization, something not seen in the game. The novel also provides some background detail (such as the reaction on Earth after the discovery of Attila), in addition to explaining several mysteries left unexplored in the game.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; panned the novelization, claiming it was severely restricted by the fact that it was based on a computer game, in which the hero merely collects objects and solves puzzles. The review also said it suffered from stereotypical characters and a &quot;simplistic metaphysics&quot;, again blamed on its computer game origins.

* A fresh peace congress is summoned at Sparta. At the peace conference, the Spartan King Agesilaus II (with the support of Athens) refuses to allow the Thebans to sign the treaty on behalf of all Boeotia. The Theban Epaminondas, who is boeotarch (one of the five magistrates of the Boeotian federation), maintains Thebes&#x27; position, even when it leads to the exclusion of Thebes from the peace treaty.
* Thebes&#x27; actions at the peace congress lead to a war between Sparta and Thebes. The Spartans have an army stationed on Thebes&#x27; western frontier, waiting to follow up their diplomatic success by a crushing military attack. However, at the Battle of Leuctra, the Theban generals, Epaminondas and Pelopidas, win a decisive victory over the Spartans under the other Spartan king, Cleombrotus I (who is killed in the battle). Epaminondas wins the battle with a tactical innovation which involves striking the enemy first at their strongest, instead of their weakest, point, with such crushing force that the attack is irresistible. As a result of this battle, the Boeotian federation is saved.
* Athens does not welcome the Theban victory, fearing the rising aggressiveness of Thebes. After the Theban victory, the old alliance between the Persians and the Thebans is restored.
* With the unexpected defeat of Sparta by the Thebans, the Arcadians decide to re-assert their independence. They rebuild Mantinea, form an Arcadian League and build a new federal city, Megalopolis.
* Agesipolis II succeeds his father Cleombrotus I as king of Sparta.

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* After driving off the Spartan army that has threatened Mantinea, Epaminondas of Thebes moves south and crosses the Evrotas River (the frontier of Sparta), which no hostile army has breached in historical memory. The Spartans, unwilling to engage the massive Theban army in battle, remain inside their city while the Thebans and their allies ravage Laconia.
* Epaminondas briefly returns to Arcadia, then marches south to Messenia, a territory which the Spartans had conquered some 200 years before. There, Epaminondas starts the rebuilding of the ancient city of Messene on Mount Ithome, with fortifications that are among the strongest in Greece. He then issues a call to Messenian exiles all over Greece to return and rebuild their homeland. The loss of Messenia is particularly damaging to the Spartans, since the territory comprises one-third of Sparta&#x27;s territory and contains half of their helot population.
* On returning to Thebes, Epaminondas is put on trial by his political enemies who charge that he has retained his command longer than constitutionally permitted. While this charge is considered to be true, Epaminondas persuades the Thebans that this has been necessary to protect Thebes and its allies and reduce the power of Sparta. As a result, the charges against him are dropped.
* In a search for a balance of power against the now powerful Thebes, Athens responds to an appeal for help from Sparta and allies itself with its traditional enemy.
* On the death of the Macedonian King Amyntas III, his eldest son Alexander II becomes king. The young king is simultaneously faced with an Illyrian invasion from the north-west and an attack from the east by the pretender of the Macedonian throne, Pausanias (who quickly captures several cities and threatens the queen mother, Eurydice). Alexander defeats his enemies with the help of the Athenian general Iphicrates, who has been sailing along the Macedonian coast on the way to recapture Amphipolis.
* Alexander of Pherae becomes tyrant of Thessaly following the death of his father. Alexander&#x27;s tyranny causes the Aleuadae of Larissa to seek the help of Alexander II of Macedon. Alexander II successfully gains control of Larissa and several other cities but, betraying a promise he has made, put garrisons in them. This provokes a hostile reaction from Thebes. The Theban general Pelopidas drives the Macedonians from Thessaly.
* Pelopidas forces Alexander to abandon his alliance with Athens in favour of Thebes by threatening to support Alexander&#x27;s brother-in-law, Ptolemy of Aloros. As part of this new alliance, Alexander is compelled to hand over hostages, including his younger brother Philip, the future conqueror of Greece.
* Cleomenes II succeeds his brother Agesipolis II as Agiad king of Sparta.

<doc id="80933" wikidata="Q128985" url="?curid=80933" title="Harold Macmillan">
<text>Maurice Harold Macmillan, 1st Earl of Stockton (10 February 1894 – 29 December 1986) was a British statesman and Conservative politician who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1957 to 1963. Nicknamed &quot;Supermac&quot;, he was known for his pragmatism, wit, and .

Macmillan was seriously injured as an infantry officer during the First World War. He suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life. After the war he joined his family book-publishing business, then entered Parliament at the 1924 general election for Stockton-on-Tees. Losing his seat in 1929, he regained it in 1931, soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton. He opposed the appeasement of Germany practised by the Conservative government. He rose to high office during the Second World War as a protégé of Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In the 1950s Macmillan served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Anthony Eden.

When Eden resigned in 1957 following the Suez Crisis, Macmillan succeeded him as prime minister and Leader of the Conservative Party. He was a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition and supported the post-war consensus. He supported the welfare state and the necessity of a mixed economy with some nationalised industries and strong trade unions. He championed a Keynesian strategy of deficit spending to maintain demand and pursuit of corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth. Benefiting from favourable international conditions, he presided over an age of affluence, marked by low unemployment and high—if uneven—growth. In his speech of July 1957 he told the nation it had &quot;never had it so good&quot;, but warned of the dangers of inflation, summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s. He led the Conservatives to success in 1959 with an increased majority.

In international affairs, Macmillan worked to rebuild the Special Relationship with the United States from the wreckage of the 1956 Suez Crisis (of which he had been one of the architects), and facilitated the decolonisation of Africa. Reconfiguring the nation&#x27;s defences to meet the realities of the nuclear age, he ended National Service, strengthened the nuclear forces by acquiring Polaris, and pioneered the Nuclear Test Ban with the United States and the Soviet Union. After the Skybolt Crisis undermined the Anglo-American strategic relationship, he sought a more active role for Britain in Europe, but his unwillingness to disclose United States nuclear secrets to France contributed to a French veto of the United Kingdom&#x27;s entry into the European Economic Community and independent French acquisition of nuclear weapons in 1960. Near the end of his premiership, his government was rocked by the Vassall Tribunal and the Profumo affair, which to cultural conservatives and supporters of opposing parties alike seemed to symbolise moral decay of the British establishment. Following his resignation, Macmillan lived out a long retirement as an elder statesman, being an active member of the House of Lords in his final years. He died in December 1986 at the age of 92.

==Early life==

===Family===
Macmillan was born on 10 February 1894, at 52 Cadogan Place in Chelsea, London, to Maurice Crawford Macmillan, a publisher, and the former Helen (Nellie) Artie Tarleton Belles, an artist and socialite from Spencer, Indiana. He had two brothers, Daniel, eight years his senior, and Arthur, four years his senior. His paternal grandfather, Daniel MacMillan, who founded Macmillan Publishers, was the son of a Scottish crofter from the Isle of Arran. Macmillan considered himself a Scot.

===Education and early political views===
Macmillan received an intensive early education, closely guided by his American mother. He learned French at home every morning from a succession of nursery maids, and exercised daily at Mr Macpherson&#x27;s Gymnasium and Dancing Academy, around the corner from the family home. From the age of six or seven he received introductory lessons in classical Latin and Greek at Mr Gladstone&#x27;s day school, close by in Sloane Square.

Macmillan attended Summer Fields School, Oxford (1903–06). He was Third Scholar at Eton College, but his time there (1906–10) was blighted by recurrent illness, starting with a near-fatal attack of pneumonia in his first half (term); he missed his final year after being taken ill, and was taught at home by private tutors (1910–11), notably Ronald Knox, who did much to instil his High Church Anglicanism. He won an exhibition (scholarship) to Balliol College, Oxford.

In his youth, he was an admirer of the policies and leadership of a succession of Liberal prime ministers, starting with Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who came to power when Macmillan was 11 years old and H. H. Asquith, whom he later described as having &quot;intellectual sincerity and moral nobility&quot;, and particularly of Asquith&#x27;s successor, David Lloyd George, whom he regarded as a &quot;man of action&quot;, likely to accomplish his goals.

Macmillan went up to Balliol College in 1912, where he joined many political societies. His political opinions at this stage were an eclectic mix of moderate conservatism, moderate liberalism and Fabian socialism. He read avidly about Disraeli, but was also particularly impressed by a speech by Lloyd George at the Oxford Union Society in 1913, where he had become a member. Macmillan was a protégé of the president of the Union Society Walter Monckton, later a Cabinet colleague; as such, he became secretary then junior treasurer (elected unopposed in March 1914, then an unusual occurrence) of the Union, and would in his biographers&#x27; view &quot;almost certainly&quot; have been president had the war not intervened. He obtained a First in Honour Moderations, informally known as &#x27;Mods&#x27; (consisting of Latin and Greek, the first half of the four-year Oxford &quot;Literae Humaniores&quot; course, informally known as &quot;Classics&quot;), in 1914. With his final exams over two years away, he enjoyed an idyllic Trinity term at Oxford, just before the outbreak of the First World War.

===War service===
Volunteering as soon as war was declared, Macmillan was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps on 19 November 1914. Promoted to lieutenant on 30 January 1915, he soon transferred to the Grenadier Guards. He fought on the front lines in France, where the casualty rate was high, including the probability of an &quot;early violent death&quot;. He served with distinction and was wounded on three occasions. Shot in the right hand and receiving a glancing bullet wound to the head in the Battle of Loos in September 1915, Macmillan was sent to Lennox Gardens in Chelsea for hospital treatment, then joined a reserve battalion at Chelsea Barracks from January to March 1916, until his hand had healed. He then returned to the front lines in France. Leading an advance platoon in the Battle of Flers–Courcelette (part of the Battle of the Somme) in September 1916, he was severely wounded, and lay for over twelve hours in a shell hole, sometimes feigning death when Germans passed, and reading Aeschylus in the original Greek. Raymond Asquith, eldest son of the prime minister, was a brother officer in Macmillan&#x27;s regiment and was killed that month.

Macmillan spent the final two years of the war in King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital in Grosvenor Gardens undergoing a series of operations. He was still on crutches at the Armistice of 11 November 1918. His hip wound took four years to heal completely, and he was left with a slight shuffle to his walk and a limp grip in his right hand from his previous wound, which affected his handwriting.

Macmillan saw himself as both a &quot;gownsman&quot; and a &quot;swordsman&quot; and would later display open contempt for other politicians (e.g. Rab Butler, Hugh Gaitskell, Harold Wilson) who, often through no fault of their own, had not seen military service in either World War.

===Canadian aide-de-campship===
Of the scholars and exhibitioners of his year, only he and one other survived the war. As a result, he refused to return to Oxford to complete his degree, saying the university would never be the same; in later years he joked that he had been &quot;sent down by the Kaiser&quot;.

Owing to the impending contraction of the Army after the war, a regular commission in the Grenadiers was out of the question. However, at the end of 1918 Macmillan joined the Guards Reserve Battalion at Chelsea Barracks for &quot;light duties&quot;. On one occasion he had to command reliable troops in a nearby park as a unit of Guardsmen was briefly refusing to reembark for France, although the incident was resolved peacefully. The incident prompted an inquiry from the War Office as to whether the Guards Reserve Battalion &quot;could be relied on&quot;.

Macmillan then served in Ottawa, Canada, in 1919 as aide-de-camp (ADC) to Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire, then Governor General of Canada, and his future father-in-law. The engagement of Captain Macmillan to the Duke&#x27;s daughter Lady Dorothy was announced on 7 January 1920. He relinquished his commission on 1 April 1920. As was common for contemporary former officers, he continued to be known as &#x27;Captain Macmillan&#x27; until the early 1930s and was listed as such in every general election between 1923 and 1931. As late as his North African posting of 1942–43 he reminded Churchill that he held the rank of captain in the Guards reserve.

===Macmillan Publishers===
On his return to London in 1920 he joined the family publishing firm Macmillan Publishers as a junior partner. In 1936, Harold and his brother Daniel took control of the firm, with the former focusing on the political and non-fiction side of the business. Harold resigned from the company on appointment to ministerial office in 1940. He resumed working with the firm from 1945 to 1951 when the party was in opposition.

==Personal life==
According to Michael Bloch, there have long been rumours that Macmillan was expelled from Eton for homosexuality. Macmillan&#x27;s biographer D. R. Thorpe is of the view that he was removed by his mother when she discovered that he was being &quot;used&quot; by older boys. Dick Leonard reports that Alistair Horne refers to &quot;inevitable rumours&quot; and that &quot;he left for the &#x27;usual reasons&#x27; for boys to be expelled from public schools&quot;.

===Marriage===
Macmillan married Lady Dorothy Cavendish, the daughter of the 9th Duke of Devonshire, on 21 April 1920. Her great-uncle was Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire, who was leader of the Liberal Party in the 1870s, and a close colleague of William Ewart Gladstone, Joseph Chamberlain and Lord Salisbury. Lady Dorothy was also descended from William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, who served as prime minister from 1756 to 1757 in communion with Newcastle and Pitt the Elder. Her nephew William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, married Kathleen Kennedy, a sister of John F. Kennedy.

In 1929, Lady Dorothy began a lifelong affair with the Conservative politician Robert Boothby, an arrangement that scandalised high society but remained unknown to the general public. Philip Frere, a partner in Frere Cholmely solicitors, urged Macmillan not to divorce his wife, which at that time would have been fatal to a public career even for the &quot;innocent party&quot;. Macmillan and Lady Dorothy lived largely separate lives in private thereafter. The stress caused by that may have contributed to Macmillan&#x27;s nervous breakdown in 1931. He was often treated with condescension by his aristocratic in-laws and was observed to be a sad and isolated figure at Chatsworth in the 1930s. John Campbell suggests that Macmillan&#x27;s humiliation was first a major cause of his odd and rebellious behaviour in the 1930s then, in subsequent decades, made him a harder and more ruthless politician than his rivals Eden and Butler.

The Macmillans had four children:
* Maurice Macmillan, Viscount Macmillan of Ovenden (1921–1984), Conservative politician and publisher. Married The Hon Katharine Ormsby-Gore, daughter of the 4th Baron Harlech. His father outlived him by nearly three years.
* Lady Caroline Macmillan (1923–2016). Married Julian Faber; five children.
* Lady Catherine Macmillan (1926–1991). Married Julian Amery (later Baron Amery of Lustleigh), Conservative politician; four children.
* Sarah Macmillan (1930–1970). A family rumour that Boothby was her natural father has been discounted by the most recent and detailed study. Married Andrew Heath in 1953; two children. Having had an abortion in 1951, she was unable to have children of her own and the couple adopted two sons. She had an unhappy life, which was blighted by a drinking problem, and died aged only 40, her father outliving her by 16 years.

Lady Dorothy died on 21 May 1966, aged 65.

In old age, Macmillan was a close friend of Ava Anderson, Viscountess Waverley, &quot;née&quot; Bodley, the widow of John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley. Eileen O&#x27;Casey, &quot;née&quot; Reynolds, the actress wife of Irish dramatist Seán O&#x27;Casey, was another female friend, Macmillan publishing her husband&#x27;s plays. Although she is said to have replaced Lady Dorothy in Macmillan&#x27;s affections, there is disagreement over how intimate they became after the deaths of their respective spouses, and whether he proposed.

==Political career, 1924–1951==

===Member of Parliament (1924–1929)===
Macmillan contested the depressed northern industrial constituency of Stockton-on-Tees in 1923. The campaign cost him about £200-£300 out of his own pocket; at that time candidates were often expected to fund their own election campaigns. The collapse in the Liberal vote let him win in 1924. In 1927, four MPs, including Boothby and Macmillan, published a short book advocating radical measures. In 1928, Macmillan was described by his political hero, and now Parliamentary colleague, David Lloyd George, as a &quot;born rebel&quot;.

Macmillan lost his seat in 1929 in the face of high regional unemployment. He almost became Conservative candidate for the safe seat of Hitchin in 1931. However the sitting MP, Guy Kindersley cancelled his retirement plans, in part because of his own association with the anti-Baldwin rebels and his suspicion of Macmillan&#x27;s sympathy for Oswald Mosley&#x27;s promises of radical measures to reduce unemployment. Instead, the resignation of the new candidate at Stockton allowed Macmillan to be re-selected there, and he returned to the House of Commons for his old seat in 1931.

===Member of Parliament (1931–1939)===
Macmillan spent the 1930s on the backbenches. In March 1932 he published &quot;The State and Industry&quot; (not to be confused with his earlier pamphlet &quot;Industry and the State&quot;). In September 1932 he made his first visit to the Soviet Union. Macmillan also published &quot;The Next Step&quot;. He advocated cheap money and state direction of investment. In 1933 he was the sole author of &quot;Reconstruction: A Plea for a National Unity&quot;. In 1935 he was one of 15 MPs to write &quot;Planning for Employment&quot;. His next publication, &quot;The Next Five Years&quot;, was overshadowed by Lloyd George&#x27;s proposed &quot;New Deal&quot; in 1935. Macmillan Press also published the work of the economist John Maynard Keynes.

Macmillan resigned the government whip (but not the Conservative party one) in protest at the lifting of sanctions on Italy after her conquest of Abyssinia. &quot;Chips&quot; Channon described him as the &quot;unprepossessing, bookish, eccentric member for Stockton-on-Tees&quot; and recorded (8 July 1936) that he had been sent a &quot;frigid note&quot; by Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. Baldwin later mentioned that he had survived by steering a middle course between Macmillan and John Gretton, an extreme right-winger.

The Next Five Years Group, to which Macmillan had belonged, was wound up in November 1937. His book &quot;The Middle Way&quot; appeared in June 1938, advocating a broadly centrist political philosophy both domestically and internationally. Macmillan took control of the magazine &quot;New Outlook&quot; and made sure it published political tracts rather than purely theoretical work.

In 1936, Macmillan proposed the creation of a cross-party forum of antifascists to create democratic unity but his ideas were rejected by the leadership of both the Labour and Conservative parties.

Macmillan supported Chamberlain&#x27;s first flight for talks with Hitler at Berchtesgaden, but not his subsequent flights to Bad Godesberg and Munich. After Munich he was looking for a &quot;1931 in reverse&quot;, i.e. a Labour-dominated coalition in which some Conservatives would serve, the reverse of the Conservative-dominated coalition which had governed Britain since 1931. He supported the independent candidate, Lindsay, at the 1938 Oxford by-election. He wrote a pamphlet &quot;The Price of Peace&quot; calling for alliance between Britain, France and the USSR, but expecting Poland to make territorial &quot;accommodation&quot; to Germany (i.e. give up the Danzig corridor). In &quot;Economic Aspects of Defence&quot;, early in 1939, he called for a Ministry of Supply.

===Phoney War (1939–1940)===
Macmillan visited Finland in February 1940, then the subject of great sympathy in Britain as it was being invaded by the USSR, then loosely allied to Nazi Germany. His last speech from the backbenches was to attack the government for not doing enough to help Finland. Britain was saved from a potentially embarrassing commitment when the Winter War ended in March 1940.

Macmillan voted against the Government in the Norway Debate of May 1940, helping to bring down Neville Chamberlain as prime minister, and tried to join in with Colonel Josiah Wedgwood singing &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; in the House of Commons Chamber.

===Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Supply (1940–1942)===
Macmillan finally attained office by serving in the wartime coalition government as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply from 1940. Channon commented (29 May 1940) that there was &quot;some amusement over Harold Macmillan&#x27;s so obvious enjoyment of his new position&quot;.

Macmillan&#x27;s job was to provide armaments and other equipment to the British Army and Royal Air Force. He travelled up and down the country to co-ordinate production, working with some success under Lord Beaverbrook to increase the supply and quality of armoured vehicles.

===Colonial Under-Secretary (1942)===

Macmillan was appointed Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1942, in his own words &quot;leaving a madhouse to enter a mausoleum&quot;. Though a junior minister he was a member of the Privy Council, and he spoke in the House of Commons for Colonial Secretaries Lord Moyne and Lord Cranborne. Macmillan was given responsibility for increasing colonial production and trade, and signalled the future policy direction when in June 1942 he declared:

Macmillan predicted that the Conservatives faced landslide defeat after the war, causing Channon to write (6 Sep 1944) of &quot;the foolish prophecy of that nice ass Harold Macmillan&quot;. In October 1942 Harold Nicolson recorded Macmillan as predicting &quot;extreme socialism&quot; after the war. Macmillan nearly resigned when Oliver Stanley was appointed Secretary of State in November 1942, as he would no longer be the spokesman in the Commons as he had been under Cranborne. Brendan Bracken advised him not to quit.

===Minister Resident in the Mediterranean (1942–1945)===
After Harry Crookshank had refused the job, Macmillan attained real power and Cabinet rank late in 1942 as British Minister Resident at Algiers in the Mediterranean, recently liberated in Operation Torch. He reported directly to the Prime Minister instead of to the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden. Oliver Lyttelton had a similar job at Cairo, while Robert Murphy was Macmillan&#x27;s US counterpart. Macmillan built a rapport with US General Dwight D. Eisenhower, then Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean (SACMED), which proved helpful in his career, and Richard Crossman later recalled that Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;Greeks in the Roman Empire&quot; metaphor dated from this time (i.e., that as the US replaced Britain as the world&#x27;s leading power, British politicians and diplomats should aim to guide her in the same way that Greek slaves and freedmen had advised powerful Romans). Macmillan told Crossman: &quot;We, my dear Crossman, are the Greeks in the American empire. You will find the Americans much as the Greeks found the Romans—great big, vulgar bustling people, more vigorous than we are and also more idle, with more unspoiled virtues, but also more corrupt. We must run AFHQ (Allied Forces Headquarters) as the Greek slaves ran the operations of the Emperor Claudius&quot;. At the Casablanca Conference Macmillan helped to secure US acceptance, if not recognition, of the Free French leader Charles de Gaulle. Macmillan wrote in his diary during the Casablanca conference: &quot;I christened the two personalities the Emperor of the East and the Emperor of the West and indeed it was rather like a meeting of the late Roman empire&quot;. For Macmillan, the &quot;remarkable and romantic episodes&quot; as President Roosevelt met Prime Minister Churchill in Casablanca convinced him that personal diplomacy was the best way to deal with Americans, which later influenced his foreign policy as prime minister.

On 22 February 1943, Macmillan was badly burned in a plane crash, trying to climb back into the plane to rescue a Frenchman. He had to have a plaster cast put on his face. In his delirium he imagined himself back in a Somme casualty clearing station and asked for a message to be passed to his mother, now dead.

Together with Gladwyn Jebb he helped to negotiate the Italian armistice in August 1943, between the fall of Sicily and the Salerno Landings. This caused friction with Eden and the Foreign Office. He was based at Caserta for the rest of the war. He was appointed UK High Commissioner for the Advisory Council for Italy late in 1943. He visited London in October 1943 and again clashed with Eden. Eden appointed Duff Cooper as Representative to the Free French government in Algeria (after the liberation of mainland France, he later continued as Ambassador to France from November 1944) and Noel Charles as Ambassador to Italy to reduce Macmillan&#x27;s influence. In May 1944 Macmillan infuriated Eden by demanding an early peace treaty with Italy (at that time a pro-Allied regime under Badoglio held some power in the southern, liberated, part of Italy), a move which Churchill favoured. In June 1944 he argued for a British-led thrust up the Ljubljana Gap into Central Europe (Operation &quot;Armpit&quot;) instead of the planned diversion of US and Free French forces to the South of France (Operation Dragoon). This proposal impressed Churchill and General Alexander, but did not meet with American approval. Eden sent out Robert Dixon to abolish the job of Resident Minister, there being then no job for Macmillan back in the UK, but he managed to prevent his job being abolished. Churchill visited Italy in August 1944. On 14 September 1944 Macmillan was appointed Chief Commissioner of the Allied Control Commission for Italy (in succession to General Noel Mason-MacFarlane). He continued to be British Minister Resident at Allied Headquarters and British political adviser to &quot;Jumbo&quot; Wilson, now Supreme Commander, Mediterranean. On 10 November 1944 he was appointed Acting President of the Allied Commission (the Supreme Commander being President).

Macmillan visited Greece on 11 December 1944. As the Germans had withdrawn, British troops under General Scobie had deployed to Athens, but there were concerns that the pro-communist Greek resistance, EAM and its military wing ELAS, would take power (see Dekemvriana) or come into conflict with British troops. Macmillan rode in a tank and was under sniper fire at the British Embassy. Despite the hostility of large sections of British and American opinion, who were sympathetic to the guerrillas and hostile to what was seen as imperialist behaviour, he persuaded a reluctant Churchill, who visited Athens later in the month, to accept Archbishop Damaskinos as Regent on behalf of the exiled King George II. A truce was negotiated in January 1945, enabling a pro-British regime to remain in power, as Churchill had demanded in the Percentages agreement the previous autumn. In 1947 the US would take over Britain&#x27;s role as &quot;protector&quot; of Greece and Turkey, to keep the Soviets out of the Mediterranean, the so-called &quot;Truman Doctrine&quot;.

Macmillan was also the minister advising General Keightley of V Corps, the senior Allied commander in Austria responsible for Operation Keelhaul, which included the forced repatriation of up to 70,000 prisoners of war to the Soviet Union and Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Yugoslavia in 1945. The deportations and Macmillan&#x27;s involvement later became a source of controversy because of the harsh treatment meted out to Nazi collaborators and anti-partisans by the receiving countries, and because in the confusion V Corps went beyond the terms agreed at Yalta and Allied Forces Headquarters directives by repatriating 4000 White Russian troops and 11,000 civilian family members.

===Air Secretary (1945)===
Macmillan toyed with an offer to succeed Duff Cooper as MP for the safe Conservative seat of Westminster St George&#x27;s. Criticised locally for his long absence, he suggested that Lady Dorothy stand for Stockton in 1945, as she had been nursing the seat for five years. She was apparently willing. However, it was thought better for him to be seen to defend his seat, and Lord Beaverbrook had already spoken to Churchill to arrange that Macmillan be given another seat in the event of defeat.

Macmillan returned to England after the European war, feeling himself &#x27;almost a stranger at home&#x27;. He was Secretary of State for Air for two months in Churchill&#x27;s caretaker government, &#x27;much of which was taken up in electioneering&#x27;, there being &#x27;nothing much to be done in the way of forward planning&#x27;.

===Opposition (1945–1951)===
Macmillan indeed lost Stockton in the landslide Labour victory of July 1945, but returned to Parliament in the November 1945 by-election in Bromley. In his diary Harold Nicolson noted the feelings of the Tory backbenchers: &quot;They feel that Winston is too old and Anthony (Eden) too weak. They want Harold Macmillan to lead them.&quot;

He was a member of the British delegation to the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe from 1949 to 1951, and played a prominent role – as a key aide and ally of Winston Churchill – in pressing for greater European integration as a bulwark against Soviet totalitarianism and to prevent a recurrence of the horrors of Nazi rule.

Although Macmillan played an important role in drafting the &quot;Industrial Charter&quot; (&quot;Crossbencher&quot; in the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; called it the second edition of &quot;The Middle Way&quot;) he now, as MP for a safe seat, adopted a somewhat more right-wing public persona, defending private enterprise and fiercely opposing the Labour government in the House of Commons.

==Political career, 1951–1957==

===Housing Minister (1951–1954)===
With the Conservative victory in 1951 Macmillan became Minister of Housing &amp; Local Government under Churchill, who entrusted him with fulfilling the pledge to build 300,000 houses per year (up from the previous target of 200,000 a year), made in response to a speech from the floor at the 1950 Party Conference. Macmillan thought at first that Housing, which ranked 13 out of 16 in the Cabinet list, was a poisoned chalice, writing in his diary (28 October 1951) that it was &quot;not my cup of tea at all ... I really haven&#x27;t a clue how to set about the job&quot;. It meant obtaining scarce steel, cement and timber when the Treasury were trying to maximise exports and minimise imports. &#x27;It is a gamble—it will make or mar your political career,&#x27; Churchill said, &#x27;but every humble home will bless your name if you succeed.&#x27;

By July 1952 Macmillan was already criticising Butler (then Chancellor of the Exchequer) in his diary, accusing him of &quot;dislik(ing) and fear(ing) him&quot;; in fact there is no evidence that Butler regarded Macmillan as a rival at this stage. In April 1953 Beaverbrook encouraged Macmillan to think that in a future leadership contest he might emerge in a dead heat between Eden and Butler, as the young Beaverbrook (Max Aitken as he had been at the time) had helped Bonar Law to do in 1911. In July 1953 Macmillan considered postponing his gall bladder operation in case Churchill, who had just suffered a serious stroke while Eden was also in hospital, had to step down.

Macmillan achieved his housing target by the end of 1953, a year ahead of schedule.

===Minister of Defence (1954–1955)===

Macmillan was Minister of Defence from October 1954, but found his authority restricted by Churchill&#x27;s personal involvement. In the opinion of &quot;The Economist&quot;: &#x27;He gave the impression that his own undoubted capacity for imaginative running of his own show melted way when an august superior was breathing down his neck.&#x27;

A major theme of his tenure at Defence was the ministry&#x27;s growing reliance on the nuclear deterrent, in the view of some critics, to the detriment of conventional forces. The Defence White Paper of February 1955, announcing the decision to produce the hydrogen bomb, received cross-party support.

&quot;It breaks my heart to see the lion-hearted Churchill begin to sink into a sort of Petain&quot;, Macmillan wrote in his diary as the Prime Minister&#x27;s mental and physical powers visibly decayed. Macmillan was one of the few ministers brave enough to tell Churchill to his face that it was time for him to retire. Petain, a successful French general in the First World War, had become senile while heading the pro-German Vichy Regime.

During the Second World War Macmillan&#x27;s toothy grin, baggy trousers and rimless glasses had given him, as his biographer puts it, &quot;an air of an early Bolshevik leader&quot;. By the 1950s he had had his teeth capped, grew his hair in a more shapely style, wore Savile Row suits and walked with the ramrod bearing of a former Guards officer, acquiring the distinguished appearance of his later career. Campbell writes &quot;there has been no more startling personal reinvention in British politics&quot;. He very often wore either an Old Etonian or a Brigade of Guards tie. Campbell also suggests that Harold Wilson&#x27;s image change during Macmillan&#x27;s premiership from &quot;boring young statistician into lovable Yorkshire comic&quot; was made in conscious imitation of Macmillan.

===Foreign Secretary (1955)===
Macmillan was Foreign Secretary in April–December 1955 in the government of Anthony Eden, who had taken over as prime minister from the retiring Churchill. Returning from the Geneva Summit of that year he made headlines by declaring: &#x27;There ain&#x27;t gonna be no war.&#x27; Of the role of Foreign Secretary Macmillan observed:

===Chancellor of the Exchequer (1955–1957)===

====Budget====
Macmillan was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in December 1955. He had enjoyed his eight months as Foreign Secretary and did not wish to move. He insisted on being &quot;undisputed head of the home front&quot; and that Eden&#x27;s de facto deputy Rab Butler, whom he was replacing as Chancellor, not have the title &quot;Deputy Prime Minister&quot; and not be treated as senior to him. He even tried (in vain) to demand that Salisbury, not Butler, should preside over the Cabinet in Eden&#x27;s absence. Macmillan later claimed in his memoirs that he had still expected Butler, his junior by eight years, to succeed Eden, but correspondence with Lord Woolton at the time makes clear that Macmillan was very much thinking of the succession. As early as January 1956 he told Eden&#x27;s press secretary William D. Clark that it would be &quot;interesting to see how long Anthony can stay in the saddle&quot;.

Macmillan planned to reverse the 6d cut in income tax which Butler had made a year previously, but backed off after a &quot;frank talk&quot; with Butler, who threatened resignation, on 28 March 1956. He settled for spending cuts instead, and himself threatened resignation until he was allowed to cut bread and milk subsidies, something the Cabinet had not permitted Butler to do.

One of his innovations at the Treasury was the introduction of premium bonds, announced in his budget of 17 April 1956. Although the Labour Opposition initially decried them as a &#x27;squalid raffle&#x27;, they proved an immediate hit with the public, with £1,000 won in the first prize draw in June 1957.

A young John Major attended the presentation of the budget, and attributes his political ambitions to this event.

====Suez====
In November 1956, Britain invaded Egypt in collusion with France and Israel in the Suez Crisis. According to Labour Shadow Chancellor Harold Wilson, Macmillan was &#x27;first in, first out&#x27;: first very supportive of the invasion, then a prime mover in Britain&#x27;s humiliating withdrawal in the wake of the financial crisis caused by pressure from the US government. Since the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, relations between Britain and Egypt had deteriorated. The Egyptian government, which came to be dominated by Gamal Abdel Nasser, was opposed to the British military presence in the Arab World. The Egyptian nationalisation of the Suez Canal by Nasser on 26 July 1956 prompted the British government and the French government of Guy Mollet to commence plans for invading Egypt, regaining the canal, and toppling Nasser. Macmillan wrote in his diary: &quot;If Nasser &#x27;gets away with it&#x27;, we are done for. The whole Arab world will despise us ... Nuri [es-Said, British-backed Prime Minister of Iraq] and our friends will fall. It may well be the end of British influence and strength forever. So, in the last resort, we must use force and defy opinion, here and overseas&quot;.

Macmillan threatened to resign if force was not used against Nasser. He was heavily involved in the secret planning of the invasion with France and Israel. It was he who first suggested collusion with Israel. On 5 August 1956 Macmillan met Churchill at Chartwell, and told him that the government&#x27;s plan for simply regaining control of the canal was not enough and suggested involving Israel, recording in his diary for that day: &quot;Surely, if we landed we must seek out the Egyptian forces; destroy them; and bring down Nasser&#x27;s government. Churchill seemed to agree with all this.&quot; Macmillan knew President Eisenhower well, but misjudged his strong opposition to a military solution. Macmillan met Eisenhower privately on 25 September 1956 and convinced himself that the US would not oppose the invasion, despite the misgivings of the British Ambassador, Sir Roger Makins, who was also present. Macmillan failed to heed a warning from Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that whatever the British government did should wait until after the US presidential election on 6 November, and failed to report Dulles&#x27; remarks to Eden.

The treasury was his portfolio, but he did not recognise the financial disaster that could result from US government actions. Sterling was draining out of the Bank of England at an alarming rate. The canal was blocked by the Egyptians, and most oil shipments were delayed as tankers had to go around Africa. The US government refused any financial help until Britain withdrew its forces from Egypt. When he did realise this, he changed his mind and called for withdrawal on US terms, while exaggerating the financial crisis. On 6 November Macmillan informed the Cabinet that Britain had lost $370m in the first few days of November alone. Faced with Macmillan&#x27;s prediction of doom, the cabinet had no choice but to accept these terms and withdraw. The Canal remained in Egyptian hands, and Nasser&#x27;s government continued its support of Arab and African national resistance movements opposed to the British and French presence in the region and on the continent.

In later life Macmillan was open about his failure to read Eisenhower&#x27;s thoughts correctly and much regretted the damage done to Anglo-American relations, but always maintained that the Anglo-French military response to the nationalisation of the Canal had been for the best. D. R. Thorpe rejects the charge that Macmillan deliberately played false over Suez (i.e. encouraged Eden to attack in order to destroy him as prime minister), noting that Macmillan privately put the chances of success at 51–49.

====Succession to Eden====
Britain&#x27;s humiliation at the hands of the US caused deep anger among Conservative MPs. After the ceasefire a motion on the Order Paper attacking the US for &quot;gravely endangering the Atlantic Alliance&quot; attracted the signatures of over a hundred MPs.
Macmillan tried, but failed, to see Eisenhower (who was also refusing to see Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd) behind Butler&#x27;s and Eden&#x27;s back. Macmillan had a number of meetings with US Ambassador Winthrop Aldrich, in which he said that if he were prime minister the US Administration would find him much more amenable. Eisenhower encouraged Aldrich to have further meetings. Macmillan and Butler met Aldrich on 21 November. Eisenhower spoke highly of Macmillan (&quot;A straight, fine man, and so far as he is concerned, the outstanding one of the British he served with during the war&quot;).

On the evening of 22 November 1956 Butler, who had just announced British withdrawal, addressed the 1922 Committee (Conservative backbenchers) with Macmillan. After Butler&#x27;s downbeat remarks, ten minutes or so in length, Macmillan delivered a stirring 35-minute speech described by Enoch Powell as &quot;one of the most horrible things that I remember in politics ... (Macmillan) with all the skill of the old actor manager succeeded in false-footing Rab. The sheer devilry of it verged upon the disgusting.&quot; He expounded on his metaphor that henceforth the British must aim to be &quot;Greeks in the Roman Empire&quot;, and according to Philip Goodhart&#x27;s recollection almost knocked Butler off his chair with his expansive arm gestures. Macmillan wrote &quot;I held the Tory Party for the weekend, it was all I intended to do&quot;. Macmillan had further meetings with Aldrich and Winston Churchill after Eden left for Jamaica (23 November) while briefing journalists (disingenuously) that he planned to retire and go to the Lords. He was also hinting that he would not serve under Butler.

Butler later recorded that during his period as acting Head of Government at Number 10, he noticed constant comings and goings of ministers to Macmillan&#x27;s study in Number 11 next door, and that those who attended all seemed to receive promotions when Macmillan became prime minister. Macmillan had opposed Eden&#x27;s trip to Jamaica and told Butler (15 December, the day after Eden&#x27;s return) that younger members of the Cabinet wanted Eden out. Macmillan argued at Cabinet on 4 January that Suez should be regarded as a &quot;strategic retreat&quot; like Mons or Dunkirk. This did not meet with Eden&#x27;s approval at Cabinet on 7 January.

His political standing destroyed, Eden resigned on grounds of ill health on 9 January 1957. At that time the Conservative Party had no formal mechanism for selecting a new leader, and Queen Elizabeth II appointed Macmillan Prime Minister after taking advice from Churchill and the Marquess of Salisbury, who had asked the Cabinet individually for their opinions, all but two or three opting for Macmillan. This surprised some observers who had expected that Eden&#x27;s deputy Rab Butler would be chosen. The political situation after Suez was so desperate that on taking office on 10 January he told the Queen he could not guarantee his government would last &quot;six weeks&quot;, though ultimately he would be in charge of the government for more than six years.

==Prime Minister (1957–1963)==

===First government, 1957–1959===
From the start of his premiership, Macmillan set out to portray an image of calm and style, in contrast to his excitable predecessor. He silenced the klaxon on the Prime Ministerial car, which Eden had used frequently. He advertised his love of reading Anthony Trollope and Jane Austen, and on the door of the Private Secretaries&#x27; room at Number Ten he hung a quote from &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;: &quot;Quiet, calm deliberation disentangles every knot&quot;.

Macmillan filled government posts with 35 Old Etonians, seven of them in Cabinet. He was also devoted to family members: when Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire was later appointed (Minister for Colonial Affairs from 1963 to 1964 among other positions) he described his uncle&#x27;s behaviour as &quot;the greatest act of nepotism ever&quot;. Macmillan&#x27;s Defence Minister, Duncan Sandys, wrote at the time: &quot;Eden had no gift for leadership; under Macmillan as PM everything is better, Cabinet meetings are quite transformed&quot;. Many ministers found Macmillan to be more decisive and brisk than either Churchill or Eden had been. Another of Macmillan&#x27;s ministers, Charles Hill, stated that Macmillan dominated Cabinet meetings &quot;by sheer superiority of mind and of judgement&quot;. Macmillan frequently made allusions to history, literature and the classics at cabinet meetings, giving him a reputation as being both learned and entertaining, though many ministers found his manner too authoritarian. Macmillan had no &quot;inner cabinet&quot;, and instead maintained one-on-one relationships with a few senior ministers such as Rab Butler who usually served as acting prime minister when Macmillan was on one of his frequent visits abroad. Selwyn Lloyd described Macmillan as treating most of his ministers like &quot;junior officers in a unit he commanded&quot;. Lloyd recalled that Macmillan: &quot;regarded the Cabinet as an instrument to play upon, a body to be molded to his will...very rarely did he fail to get his way&quot; Macmillan generally allowed his ministers much leeway in managing their portfolios, and only intervened if he felt something had gone wrong. Macmillan was especially close to his three private secretaries, Tom Bligh, Freddie Bishop and Philip de Zulueta, who were his favourite advisers. Many cabinet ministers often complained that Macmillan took the advice of his private secretaries more seriously than he did their own.

He was nicknamed &quot;Supermac&quot; in 1958 by the cartoonist Victor Weisz, who intended to suggest that Macmillan was trying set himself up as a &quot;Superman&quot; figure. It was intended as mockery but backfired, coming to be used in a neutral or friendly fashion. Weisz tried to label him with other names, including &quot;Mac the Knife&quot; at the time of widespread cabinet changes in 1962, but none caught on.

====Economy====
Besides foreign affairs, the economy was Macmillan&#x27;s other prime concern. His One Nation approach to the economy was to seek high or full employment, especially with a general election looming. This contrasted with the Treasury ministers who argued that support of sterling required spending cuts and, probably, a rise in unemployment. Their advice was rejected and in January 1958 the three Treasury ministers — Peter Thorneycroft, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Birch, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, and Enoch Powell, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury and seen as their intellectual ringleader — resigned. D. R. Thorpe argues that this, coming after the resignations of Labour ministers Aneurin Bevan, John Freeman and Harold Wilson in April 1951 (who had wanted &quot;higher&quot; expenditure), and the cuts made by Butler and Macmillan as Chancellors in 1955–56, was another step in the development of &quot;stop-go&quot; economics, as opposed to prudent medium-term management. Macmillan, away on a tour of the Commonwealth, brushed aside this incident as &quot;a little local difficulty&quot;. He bore no grudge against Thorneycroft and brought him and Powell, of whom he was more wary, back into the government in 1960.

This period also saw the first stirrings of more active monetary policy. Official bank rate, which had been kept low since the 1930s, was hiked in September 1958. The change in bank rate prompted rumours in the City that some financiers – who were Bank of England directors with senior positions in private firms – took advantage of advance knowledge of the rate change in what resembled insider trading. Political pressure mounted on the Government, and Macmillan agreed to the 1957 Bank Rate Tribunal. Hearing evidence in the winter of 1957 and reporting in January 1958, this inquiry exonerated all involved in what some journalists perceived to be a whitewash.

====Domestic policies====
During his time as prime minister, average living standards steadily rose while numerous social reforms were carried out. The Clean Air Act 1956 was passed during his time as Chancellor; his premiership saw the passage of the Housing Act 1957, the Offices Act 1960, the Noise Abatement Act 1960, and the Factories Act 1961; the introduction of a graduated pension scheme to provide an additional income to retirees, the establishment of a Child&#x27;s Special Allowance for the orphaned children of divorced parents, and a reduction in the standard work week from 48 to 42 hours.

====Foreign policy====
Macmillan took close control of foreign policy. He worked to narrow the post-Suez Crisis (1956) rift with the United States, where his wartime friendship with Eisenhower was key; the two had a productive conference in Bermuda as early as March 1957.

In February 1959, Macmillan visited the Soviet Union. Talks with Nikita Khrushchev eased tensions in east–west relations over West Berlin and led to an agreement in principle to stop nuclear tests and to hold a further summit meeting of Allied and Soviet heads of government.

In the Middle East, faced by the 1958 collapse of the Baghdad Pact and the spread of Soviet influence, Macmillan acted decisively to restore the confidence of Persian Gulf allies, using the Royal Air Force and special forces to defeat a revolt backed by Saudi Arabia and Egypt against the Sultan of Oman, Said bin Taimur, in July 1957; deploying airborne battalions to defend Jordan against United Arab Republican subversion in July 1958; and deterring Iraqi demands of Kuwait by landing a brigade group in June 1961 during the Iraq–Kuwait crisis of 1961 .

Macmillan was a major proponent and architect of decolonisation. The Gold Coast was granted independence as Ghana, and the Federation of Malaya achieved independence within the Commonwealth of Nations in 1957. &quot;The material strength of the Old Commonwealth members, if joined with the moral influence of the Asiatic members, meant that a united Commonwealth would always have a very powerful voice in world affairs,&quot; said Macmillan in a 1957 speech during a tour of the former British Empire.

====Nuclear weapons====

In April 1957, Macmillan reaffirmed his strong support for the British nuclear weapons programme. A succession of prime ministers since the Second World War had been determined to persuade the United States to revive wartime co-operation in the area of nuclear weapons research. Macmillan believed that one way to encourage such co-operation would be for the United Kingdom to speed up the development of its own hydrogen bomb, which was successfully tested on 8 November 1957.

Macmillan&#x27;s decision led to increased demands on the Windscale and (subsequently) Calder Hall nuclear plants to produce plutonium for military purposes. As a result, safety margins for radioactive materials inside the Windscale reactor were eroded. This contributed to the Windscale fire on the night of 10 October 1957, which broke out in the plutonium plant of Pile No. 1, and nuclear contaminants travelled up a chimney where the filters blocked some, but not all, of the contaminated material. The radioactive cloud spread to south-east England and fallout reached mainland Europe. Although scientists had warned of the dangers of such an accident for some time, the government blamed the workers who had put out the fire for &#x27;an error of judgement&#x27;, rather than the political pressure for fast-tracking the megaton bomb.

Concerned that public confidence in the nuclear programme might be shaken and that technical information might be misused by opponents of defence co-operation in the US Congress, Macmillan withheld all but the summary of a report into the fire prepared for the Atomic Energy Authority by Sir William Penney, director of the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment. Subsequently released files show that &#x27;Macmillan&#x27;s cuts were few and covered up few technical details&#x27;, and that even the full report found no danger to public health, but later official estimates acknowledged that the release of polonium-210 may have led directly to 25 to 50 deaths, and anti-nuclear groups linked it to 1,000 fatal cancers.

On 25 March 1957, Macmillan acceded to Eisenhower&#x27;s request to base 60 Thor IRBMs in England under joint control to replace the nuclear bombers of the Strategic Air Command, which had been stationed under joint control since 1948 and were approaching obsolescence. Partly as a consequence of this favour, in late October 1957 the US McMahon Act was eased to facilitate nuclear co-operation between the two governments, initially with a view to producing cleaner weapons and reducing the need for duplicate testing. The Mutual Defence Agreement followed on 3 July 1958, speeding up British ballistic missile development, notwithstanding unease expressed at the time about the impetus co-operation might give to atomic proliferation by arousing the jealousy of France and other allies.

Macmillan saw an opportunity to increase British influence over the United States with the launching of the Soviet satellite Sputnik, which caused a severe crisis of confidence in the United States as Macmillan wrote in his diary: &quot;The Russian success in launching the satellite has been something equivalent to Pearl Harbour. The American cockiness is shaken...President is under severe attack for the first time...The atmosphere is now such that almost anything might be decided, however revolutionary&quot;. The &quot;revolutionary&quot; change that Macmillan sought was a more equal Anglo-American partnership as he used the Sputnik crisis to press Eisenhower to in turn press Congress to repeal the 1946 MacMahon Act, which forbade the United States to share nuclear technology with foreign governments, a goal accomplished by the end of 1957.

In addition, Macmillan succeeded in having Eisenhower to agree to set up Anglo-American &quot;working groups&quot; to examine foreign policy problems and for what he called the &quot;Declaration of Interdependence&quot; (a title not used by the Americans who called it the &quot;Declaration of Common Purpose&quot;), which he believed marked the beginning of a new era of Anglo-American partnership. Subsequently, Macmillan was to learn that neither Eisenhower nor Kennedy shared the assumption that he applied to the &quot;Declaration of Interdependence&quot; that the American president and the British Prime Minister had equal power over the decisions of war and peace. Macmillan believed that the American policies towards the Soviet Union were too rigid and confrontational, and favoured a policy of détente with the aim of relaxing Cold War tensions.

====1959 general election====
Macmillan led the Conservatives to victory in the 1959 general election, increasing his party&#x27;s majority from 60 to 100 seats. The campaign was based on the economic improvements achieved as well as the low unemployment and improving standard of living; the slogan &quot;Life&#x27;s Better Under the Conservatives&quot; was matched by Macmillan&#x27;s own 1957 remark, &quot;indeed let us be frank about it—most of our people have never had it so good,&quot; usually paraphrased as &quot;You&#x27;ve never had it so good.&quot; Such rhetoric reflected a new reality of working-class affluence; it has been argued that &quot;the key factor in the Conservative victory was that average real pay for industrial workers had risen since Churchill&#x27;s 1951 victory by over 20 per cent&quot;. The scale of the victory meant that not only had the Conservatives won three successive general elections, but they had also increased their majority each time. It sparked debate as to whether Labour (now led by Hugh Gaitskell) could win a general election again. The standard of living had risen enough that workers could participate in a consumer economy, shifting the working class concerns away from traditional Labour Party views.

===Second government, 1959–1963===

====Economy ====
Britain&#x27;s balance of payments problems led Chancellor Selwyn Lloyd to impose a seven-month wage freeze in 1961 and, amongst other factors, this caused the government to lose popularity and a series of by-elections in March 1962, of which the most famous was Orpington on 14 March. Butler leaked to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; on 11 July 1962 that a major reshuffle was imminent. Macmillan feared for his own position and later (1 August) claimed to Lloyd that Butler, who sat for a rural East Anglian seat likely to suffer from EC agricultural protectionism, had been planning to split the party over EC entry (there is no evidence that this was so).

In the 1962 cabinet reshuffle known as the &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot;, Macmillan sacked eight Ministers, including Selwyn Lloyd. The Cabinet changes were widely seen as a sign of panic, and the young Liberal MP Jeremy Thorpe said of Macmillan&#x27;s dismissals, &quot;greater love hath no man than this, than to lay down his friends for his life&quot;. Macmillan was openly criticised by his predecessor Lord Avon, an almost unprecedented act.

Macmillan supported the creation of the National Economic Development Council (NEDC, known as &quot;Neddy&quot;), which was announced in the summer of 1961 and first met in 1962. However, the National Incomes Commission (NIC, known as &quot;Nicky&quot;), set up in October 1962 to institute controls on income as part of his growth-without-inflation policy, proved less effective. This was largely due to employers and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) boycotting it. A further series of subtle indicators and controls was introduced during his premiership.

The report &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot; (or Beeching I report) was published on 27 March 1963. The report starts by quoting the brief provided by the prime minister, Harold Macmillan, from 1960, &quot;First, the industry must be of a size and pattern suited to modern conditions and prospects. In particular, the railway system must be modelled to meet current needs, and the modernisation plan must be adapted to this new shape&quot;, and with the premise that the railways should be run as a profitable business. This led to the notorious Beeching Axe, destroying many miles of permanent way and severing towns from the railway network.

====Foreign policy====

In the age of jet aircraft Macmillan travelled more than any previous prime minister, apart from Lloyd George who made many trips to conferences in 1919–22. Macmillan planned an important role in setting up a four power summit in Paris to discuss the Berlin crisis that was supposed to open in May 1960, but which Khrushchev refused to attend owing to the U-2 incident. Macmillan pressed Eisenhower to apologise to Khrushchev, which the president refused to do. Macmillan&#x27;s failure to make Eisenhower &quot;say sorry&quot; to Khrushchev forced him to reconsider his &quot;Greeks and Romans&quot; foreign policy as he privately conceded that could no &quot;longer talk usefully to the Americans&quot;. The failure of the Paris summit changed Macmillan&#x27;s attitude towards the European Economic Community, which he started to see as a counterbalance to American power. At the same time, the Anglo-American &quot;working groups&quot;, which Macmillan attached such importance to turned out to be largely ineffective as the Americans did not wish to have their options limited by a British veto; by in-fighting between agencies of the U.S. government such as the State Department, Defense Department, etc.; and because of the Maclean-Burgess affair of 1951 the Americans believed the British government was full of Soviet spies and thus could not be trusted.

===Relations with the United States===
The special relationship with the United States continued after the election of President John F. Kennedy, whose sister Kathleen Cavendish had married William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, the nephew of Macmillan&#x27;s wife. Macmillan initially was concerned that the Irish-American Catholic Kennedy might be an Anglophobe, which led Macmillan, who knew of Kennedy&#x27;s special interest in the Third World, to suggest that Britain and the United States spend more money on aid to the Third World. The emphasis on aid to the Third World also coincided well with Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;one nation conservatism&quot; as he wrote in a letter to Kennedy advocating reforms to capitalism to ensure full employment: &quot;If we fail in this, Communism will triumph, not by war or even by subversion but by seemingly to be a better way of bringing people material comforts&quot;.

Macmillan was scheduled to visit the United States in April 1961, but with the Pathet Lao winning a series of victories in the Laotian civil war, Macmillan was summoned on what he called the &quot;Laos dash&quot; for an emergency summit with Kennedy in Key West on 26 March 1961. Macmillan was strongly opposed to the idea of sending British troops to fight in Laos, but was afraid of damaging relations with the United States if he did not, making him very apprehensive as he set out for Key West, especially as he had never met Kennedy before. Macmillan was especially opposed to intervention in Laos as he had been warned by his Chiefs of Staff on 4 January 1961 that if Western troops entered Laos, then China would probably intervene in Laos as Mao Zedong had made it quite clear he would not accept Western forces in any nation that bordered China. The same report stated that a war with China in Laos would &quot;be a bottomless pit in which our limited military resources would rapidly disappear&quot;. Kennedy for his part wanted Britain to commit forces to Laos if the United States did for political reasons. The meeting in Key West was very tense as Macmillan was heard to mutter &quot;He&#x27;s pushing me hard, but I won&#x27;t give way&quot;. However, Macmillan did reluctantly agree if the Americans intervened in Laos, then so too would Britain. The Laos crisis had a major crisis in Anglo-Thai relations as the Thais pressed for armed forces of all SEATO members to brought to &quot;Charter Yellow&quot;, a state of heightened alert that the British representative to SEATO vetoed. The Thais wanted to change the voting procedure for SEATO from requiring unanimous consent to a three-quarter majority, a measure that Britain vetoed, causing the Thais to lose interest in SEATO.

The failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961 made Kennedy distrust the hawkish advice he received from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the CIA, and he ultimately decided against intervention in Laos, much to Macmillan&#x27;s private relief. Macmillan&#x27;s second meeting with Kennedy in April 1961 was friendlier and his third meeting in London in June 1961 after Kennedy had been bested by Khrushchev at a summit in Vienna even more so. It was at his third meeting in London that Macmillan started to assume the mantle of an elder statesman, who offered Kennedy encouragement and his experience that formed a lasting friendship. Believing that personal diplomacy was the best way to influence Kennedy, Macmillan appointed David Ormsby-Gore as his ambassador in Washington as he was a long-time friend of the Kennedy family, whom he had known since the 1930s when Kennedy&#x27;s father had served as the American ambassador in London.

He was supportive throughout the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and Kennedy consulted him by telephone every day. The Ambassador David Ormsby-Gore was a close family friend of the president and actively involved in White House discussions on how to resolve the crisis. About the Congo crisis, Macmillan clashed with Kennedy as he was against having United Nations forces put an end to the secessionist regime of Katanga backed by Belgium and the Western mining companies, which he claimed would destabilise the Central African Federation. By contrast, Kennedy felt that the regime of Katanga was a Belgian puppet state and its mere existence was damaging to the prestige of the West in the Third World. Over Macmillan&#x27;s objections, Kennedy decided to have the United Nations forces to evict the white mercenaries from Katanga and reintegrate Katanga into the Congo. For his part, Kennedy pressed Macmillan unsuccessfully to have Britain join the American economic embargo against Cuba. Macmillan told his Foreign Secretary, Lord Home &quot;there is no reason for us to help the Americans with Cuba&quot;.

Macmillan was a supporter of the nuclear test ban treaty of 1963, and in the first half of 1963 he had Ormsby-Gore quietly apply pressure on Kennedy to resume the talks in the spring of 1963 when negotiations became stalled. Feeling that the Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, was being obstructionist, Macmillan telephoned Kennedy on 11 April 1963 to suggest a joint letter to Khrushchev to break the impasse. Through Khrushchev&#x27;s reply to the Macmillan-Kennedy letter was mostly negative, Macmillan pressed Kennedy to take up the one positive aspect in his reply, namely that if a senior Anglo-American team would arrive in Moscow, he would welcome them to discuss how best to proceed about a nuclear test ban treaty. The two envoys who arrived in Moscow were W. Averell Harriman representing the United States and Lord Hailsham representing the United Kingdom. Through Lord Hailsham&#x27;s role was largely that of an observer, the talks between Harriman and the Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko resulted in the breakthrough that led to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of August 1963, banning all above ground nuclear tests. Macmillan had pressing domestic reasons for the nuclear test ban treaty. Newsreel footage of Soviet and American nuclear tests throughout the 1950s had terrified segments of the British public who were highly concerned about the possibility of weapons with such destructive power being used against British cities, and this led to the foundation of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), whose rallies in the late 1950s-early 1960s calling for British nuclear disarmament were well attended. Macmillan believed in the value of nuclear weapons both as a deterrent against the Soviet Union and to maintain Britain&#x27;s claim to be a great power, but he was also worried about the popularity of the CND. For Macmillan, banning above-ground nuclear tests, which generated film footage of the ominous mushroom clouds raising far above the earth, was the best way to dent the appeal of the CND, and in this the Partial Nuclear Ban Treaty of 1963 was successful.

===Wind of Change===
Macmillan&#x27;s first government had seen the first phase of the sub-Saharan African independence movement, which accelerated under his second government. The most problematic of the colonies was the Central African Federation, which had united Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland together in 1953 largely out of the fear that the white population of Southern Rhodesia (modern Zimbabwe) might want to join South Africa, which had since 1948 had been led by Afrikaner nationalists distinctly unfriendly to Britain. Through the Central African Federation had been presented as a multi-racial attempt to develop the region, the federation had been unstable right from the start with the black population charging that the whites had been given a privileged position.

Macmillan felt that if the costs of holding onto a particular territory outweighed the benefits then it should be dispensed with. During the Kenyan Emergency, the British authorities tried to protect the Kikuyu population from the Mau Mau guerrillas (who called themselves the &quot;Land and Freedom Army&quot;) by interning the Kikuyu in camps. A scandal erupted when the guards at the Hola camp publicly beat 11 prisoners to death on 3 March 1959, which attracted much adverse publicity as the news filtered out from Kenya to the United Kingdom. Many in the British media compared the living conditions in the Kenyan camps to the concentration camps of Nazi Germany, saying that the people in the camps were emaciated and sickly. The report of the Devlin Commission in July 1959 concerning the suppression of demonstrators in Nyasaland (modern-day Malawi) called Nyasaland &quot;a police state&quot;. In the aftermath of criticism about colonial policies in Kenya and Nyasland, Macmillan from 1959 onward started to see the African colonies as a liability, arguing at cabinet meetings that the level of force required to hang onto them would result in more domestic criticism, international opprobrium, costly wars, and would allow the Soviet Union to establish influence in the Third World by supporting self-styled &quot;liberation&quot; movements that would just make things worse. After securing a third term for the Conservatives in 1959 he appointed Iain Macleod as Colonial Secretary. Macleod greatly accelerated decolonisation and by the time he was moved to Conservative Party chairman and Leader of the Commons in 1961 he had made the decision to give independence to Nigeria, Tanganyika, Kenya, Nyasaland (as Malawi) and Northern Rhodesia (as Zambia). Macmillan embarked on his &quot;Wind of Change&quot; tour of Africa, starting in Ghana on 6 January 1960. He made the famous &#x27;wind of change&#x27; speech in Cape Town on 3 February 1960. It is considered a landmark in the process of decolonisation.

Nigeria, the Southern Cameroons and British Somaliland were granted independence in 1960, Sierra Leone and Tanganyika in 1961, Trinidad and Tobago and Uganda in 1962, and Kenya in 1963. Zanzibar merged with Tanganyika to form Tanzania in 1963. All remained within the Commonwealth except British Somaliland, which merged with Italian Somaliland to form Somalia.

Macmillan&#x27;s policy overrode the hostility of white minorities and the Conservative Monday Club. South Africa left the multiracial Commonwealth in 1961 and Macmillan acquiesced to the dissolution of the Central African Federation by the end of 1963.

In Southeast Asia, Malaya, Sabah (British North Borneo), Sarawak and Singapore became independent as Malaysia in 1963. Because Singapore with its ethnic Chinese majority was the largest and wealthiest city in the region, Macmillan was afraid that a federation of Malaya and Singapore together would result in a Chinese majority state, and insisted on including Sarawak and British North Borneo into the federation of Malaysia to ensure the new state was a Malay majority state. During the Malaya Emergency, the majority of the Communist guerrillas were ethnic Chinese, and British policies tended to favour the Muslim Malays whose willingness to follow their sultans and imams made them more anti-communist. Southeast Asia was a region where racial-ethno-religious politics predominated, and the substantial Chinese minorities in the region were widely disliked on the account of their greater economic success. Macmillan wanted Britain to retain military bases in the new state of Malaysia to ensure that Britain was a military power in Asia and thus he wanted the new state of Malaysia to have a pro-Western government. This aim was best achieved by having the same Malay elite who had worked with the British colonial authorities serve as the new elite in Malaysia, hence Macmillan&#x27;s desire to have a Malay majority who would vote for Malay politicians. Macmillan especially wanted to keep the British base at Singapore, which he like other prime ministers saw as the linchpin of British power in Asia.

The Indonesian president Sukarno strongly objected to the new federation. On 8 December 1962, Indonesia sponsored a rebellion in the British protectorate of Brunei, leading to Macmillan to dispatch Gurkhas to put down the rebellion against the sultan. In January 1963 Sukarno started a policy of &quot;konfrontasi&quot; (&quot;confrontation&quot;) with Britain. Macmillan detested Sukarno, partly because he had been a Japanese collaborator in World War Two, and partly because of his fondness for elaborate uniforms despite never having personally fought in a war offended the World War I veteran Macmillan, who had a strong contempt for any man who had not seen combat. In his diary, Macmillan called Sukarno &quot;a cross between Liberace and Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;. Macmillan felt that giving in to Sukarno&#x27;s demands would be &quot;appeasement&quot; and clashed with Kennedy over the issue. Sukarno was the leader of the most populous nation in Southeast Asia and though officially neutral in the Cold War, tended to take anti-Western positions, and Kennedy favoured accommodating him to bring him closer to the West; for example, supporting Indonesia&#x27;s claim to Dutch New Guinea even through the Netherlands was a NATO ally. Macmillan feared the expenses of an all-out war with Indonesia, but also felt to give in to Sukarno would damage British prestige, writing on 5 August 1963 that Britain&#x27;s position in Asia would be &quot;untenable&quot; if Sukarno were to triumph over Britain in the same manner he had over the Dutch in New Guinea. To help reduce the expenses of the war, Macmillan appealed to the Australian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies to send troops to defend Malaysia. On 25 September 1963, Sukarno announced in a speech that Indonesia would &quot;ganyang Malaysia&quot; (&quot;gobble Malaysia raw&quot;) and on the same day a mob burned down the British embassy in Jakarta. The result was the Indonesian Confrontation, an undeclared war between Britain vs. Indonesia that began in 1963 and continued to 1966.

The speedy transfer of power maintained the goodwill of the new nations, but critics contended it was premature. In justification Macmillan quoted Lord Macaulay in 1851:

====Skybolt crisis====

Macmillan cancelled the Blue Streak ballistic missile in April 1960 over concerns about its vulnerability to a pre-emptive attack, but continued with the development of the air-launched Blue Steel stand-off missile, which was about to enter trials. For the replacement for Blue Steel he opted for Britain to join the American Skybolt missile project. From the same year Macmillan permitted the US Navy to station Polaris submarines at Holy Loch, Scotland, as a replacement for Thor. When Skybolt was unilaterally cancelled by US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Macmillan negotiated with President Kennedy the purchase of Polaris missiles under the Nassau agreement in December 1962.

====Europe====
Macmillan worked with states outside the European Communities (EC) to form the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which from 3 May 1960 established a free-trade area. As the EC proved to be an economic success, membership of the EC started to look more attractive compared to the EFTA. A report from Sir Frank Lee of the Treasury in April 1960 predicated that the three major power blocs in the decades to come would be those headed by the United States, the Soviet Union and the EC, and argued to avoid isolation Britain would to have decisively associate itself with one of the power blocs. Macmillan wrote in his diary about his decision to apply to join the EC: &quot;Shall we be caught between a hostile (or at least less and less friendly) America and a boastful, powerful &#x27;Empire of Charlemagne&#x27;-now under French, but later bound to come under German control?...It&#x27;s a grim choice&quot;.

Through Macmillan had decided upon joining the EC in 1960, he waited until July 1961 to formally make the application, for he feared the reaction of the Conservative Party backbenchers, the farmers&#x27; lobby and the populist newspaper chain owned by the right-wing Canadian millionaire Lord Beaverbrook, who saw Britain joining the EC as a betrayal of the British empire. As expected, the Beaverbrook newspapers whose readers tended to vote Conservative offered up ferocious criticism of Macmillan&#x27;s application to join the EC, accusing him of betrayal. Negotiations to join the EC were complicated by Macmillan&#x27;s desire to allow Britain to continue its traditional policy of importing food from the Commonwealth nations of Australia, New Zealand and Canada, which led the EC nations, especially France, to accuse Britain of negotiating in bad faith.

Macmillan also saw the value of rapprochement with the EC, to which his government sought belated entry, but Britain&#x27;s application was vetoed by French president Charles de Gaulle on 29 January 1963. De Gaulle was always strongly opposed to British entry for many reasons. He sensed the British were inevitably closely linked to the Americans. He saw the European Communities as a continental arrangement primarily between France and Germany, and felt that if Britain joined, France&#x27;s role would diminish.

====Partial Test Ban Treaty (1963)====
Macmillan&#x27;s previous attempt to create an agreement at the May 1960 summit in Paris had collapsed due to the 1960 U-2 incident. He was a force in the negotiations leading to the signing of the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty by the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union. He sent Lord Hailsham to negotiate the Test Ban Treaty, a sign that he was grooming him as a potential successor.

President Kennedy visited Macmillan&#x27;s country home, Birch Grove, on 29–30 June 1963, for talks about the planned Multilateral Force. They never met again, and this was to be Kennedy&#x27;s last visit to the UK. He was assassinated in November, shortly after the end of Macmillan&#x27;s premiership.

===End of premiership===
By the early 1960s, many were starting to find Macmillan&#x27;s courtly and urbane Edwardian manners anachronistic, and satirical journals such as &quot;Private Eye&quot; and the television show &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot; mercilessly mocked him as a doddering, clueless leader. Macmillan&#x27;s handling of the Vassall affair – in which an Admiralty clerk, John Vassall, was convicted in October 1962 of passing secrets to the Soviet Union – undermined his &quot;Super-Mac&quot; reputation for competence. D. R. Thorpe writes that from January 1963 &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s strategy lay in ruins&quot;, leaving him looking for a &quot;graceful exit&quot;. The Vassall affair turned the press against him. In the same month, opposition leader Hugh Gaitskell died suddenly at the age of 56. With a general election due before the end of the following year, Gaitskell&#x27;s death threw the future of British politics into fresh doubt. The following month Harold Wilson was elected as the new Labour leader, and he proved to be a popular choice with the public.

====Profumo affair====
The Profumo affair of 1963 permanently damaged the credibility of Macmillan&#x27;s government. The revelation of the affair between John Profumo (Secretary of State for War) and an alleged call-girl, Christine Keeler, who was simultaneously sleeping with the Soviet naval attache Captain Yevgeny Ivanov made it appear that Macmillan had lost control of his government and of events in general. In the ensuing Parliamentary debate he was seen as a pathetic figure, while Nigel Birch declared, in the words of Browning on Wordsworth, that it would be &quot;Never glad confident morning again!&quot;. On 17 June 1963, he survived a Parliamentary vote with a majority of 69, one fewer than had been thought necessary for his survival, and was afterwards joined in the smoking room only by his son and son-in-law, not by any Cabinet minister. However, Butler and Reginald Maudling (who was very popular with backbench MPs at that time) declined to push for his resignation, especially after a tide of support from Conservative activists around the country. Many of the salacious revelations about the sex lives of &quot;Establishment&quot; figures during the Profumo affair damaged the image of &quot;the Establishment&quot; that Macmillan was seen as a part of, giving him the image by 1963 of a &quot;failing representative of a decadent elite&quot;.

====Resignation====
By the summer of 1963 Conservative Party Chairman Lord Poole was urging the ageing Macmillan to retire. The full Denning report into the Profumo Scandal was published on 26 September 1963.

Macmillan had a meeting with Butler on 11 September and was careful to keep his options open (retire now, retire in the New Year, or fight the next election). He talked the matter over with his son Maurice and other senior ministers. Over lunch with Lord Swinton on 30 September he favoured stepping down, but only if Baron Hailsham could be shoehorned in as his successor. He saw Butler on the morning of 7 October and told him he planned to stay on to lead the Conservatives into the next General Election, then was struck down by prostate problems on the night of 7–8 October, on the eve of the Conservative Party conference.

Macmillan was operated on at 11:30 am on 10 October. Although it is sometimes stated that he believed himself to have inoperable prostate cancer, he in fact knew it was benign before the operation. Macmillan was almost ready to leave hospital within ten days of the diagnosis and could easily have carried on, in the opinion of his doctor Sir John Richardson. His illness gave him a way out.

====Succession====
While recovering in hospital, Macmillan wrote a memorandum (dated 14 October) recommending the process by which &quot;soundings&quot; would be taken of party opinion to select his successor, which was accepted by the Cabinet on 15 October. This time backbench MPs and junior ministers were to be asked their opinion, rather than just the Cabinet as in 1957, and efforts would be made to sample opinion amongst peers and constituency activists.

Enoch Powell claimed that it was wrong of Macmillan to seek to monopolise the advice given to the Queen in this way. In fact, this was done at the Palace&#x27;s request, so that the Queen was not being seen to be involved in politics as had happened in January 1957, and had been decided as far back as June when it had looked as though the government might fall over the Profumo scandal. Ben Pimlott later described this as the &quot;biggest political misjudgement of her reign&quot;. 

Macmillan was succeeded by Foreign Secretary Alec Douglas-Home in a controversial move; it was alleged that Macmillan had pulled strings and utilised the party&#x27;s grandees, nicknamed &quot;The Magic Circle&quot;, who had slanted their &quot;soundings&quot; of opinion among MPs and Cabinet Ministers to ensure that Butler was (once again) not chosen.

He finally resigned, receiving the Queen from his hospital bed, on 18 October 1963, after nearly seven years as prime minister. He felt privately that he was being hounded from office by a backbench minority:

==Retirement, 1963–1986==

Macmillan initially refused a peerage and retired from politics in September 1964, standing down at the following month&#x27;s election, which the Conservatives narrowly lost to Labour, now led by Harold Wilson. His service in the House of Commons totalled 37 years.

===Oxford chancellor (1960–1986)===
Macmillan had been elected Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 1960, in a campaign masterminded by Hugh Trevor-Roper, and held this office for the rest of his life, frequently presiding over college events, making speeches and tirelessly raising funds. According to Sir Patrick Neill QC, the vice-chancellor, Macmillan &quot;would talk late into the night with eager groups of students who were often startled by the radical views he put forward, well into his last decade.&quot;

===Return to Macmillan Publishers===
In retirement Macmillan took up the chairmanship of his family&#x27;s publishing house, Macmillan Publishers, from 1964 to 1974. The publishing firm remained in family hands until a majority share was purchased in 1995 by the Holtzbrinck Publishing Group; the imprint persists.
Macmillan brought out a six-volume autobiography:

# &quot;Winds of Change, 1914–1939&quot; (1966) 
# &quot;The Blast of War, 1939–1945&quot; (1967) 
# &quot;Tides of Fortune, 1945–1955&quot; (1969) 
# &quot;Riding the Storm, 1956–1959&quot; (1971) 
# &quot;Pointing the Way, 1959–1961&quot; (1972) 
# &quot;At the End of the Day, 1961–1963&quot; (1973) 

Macmillan&#x27;s biographer acknowledges that his memoirs were considered &quot;heavy going&quot;. Reading these volumes was said by Macmillan&#x27;s political enemy Enoch Powell to induce &quot;a sensation akin to that of chewing on cardboard&quot;. Butler wrote in his review of &quot;Riding the Storm&quot;: &quot;Altogether this massive work will keep anybody busy for several weeks.&quot;

Macmillan&#x27;s wartime diaries were better received.
* &quot;War Diaries: Politics and War in the Mediterranean, January 1943 – May 1945&quot; (London: Macmillan, 1984) 

Since Macmillan&#x27;s death, his diaries for the 1950s and 1960s have also been published, both edited by Peter Catterall:
* &quot;The Macmillan Diaries: The Cabinet Years 1950–57&quot; (London: Macmillan, 2003) 
* &quot;The Macmillan Diaries Vol II: Prime Minister and After 1957–1966&quot; (London: Macmillan, 2011) 

Macmillan burned his diary for the climax of the Suez Affair, supposedly at Eden&#x27;s request, although in Campbell&#x27;s view more likely to protect his own reputation.

===London clubs===
Macmillan was a member of many clubs. On his first evening as prime minister he made a public show of taking the Chief Whip Edward Heath for oysters at the Turf Club.

He became president of the Carlton Club in 1977 and would often stay at the club when he had to stay in London overnight. Within a few months of becoming president, he merged the Carlton and Junior Carlton. He was also a member of Buck&#x27;s, Pratt&#x27;s, the Turf Club and Beefsteak Club. He also once commented that White&#x27;s was 75% gentlemen and 25% crooks, the perfect combination for a club.

===Political interventions===
Macmillan made occasional political interventions in retirement. Responding to a remark made by Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson about not having boots in which to go to school, Macmillan retorted: &#x27;If Mr Wilson did not have boots to go to school that is because he was too big for them.&#x27;

Macmillan accepted the Order of Merit in 1976. In October of that year he called for &quot;a Government of National Unity&quot; including all parties, which could command the public support to resolve the economic crisis. Asked who could lead such a coalition, he replied: &quot;Mr Gladstone formed his last Government when he was eighty-three. I&#x27;m only eighty-two. You mustn&#x27;t put temptation in my way.&quot; He discussed the idea with Eden, but the IMF loan saved the country and the Labour government.

Macmillan still travelled widely, visiting China in October 1979, where he held talks with senior Vice-Premier Deng Xiaoping.

===Relations with Margaret Thatcher===

Macmillan found himself drawn more actively into politics after Margaret Thatcher became Conservative leader in February 1975. After she ended Labour&#x27;s five-year rule and became prime minister in May 1979, he told Nigel Fisher (his biographer, and himself a Conservative MP): &quot;Ted [Heath] was a very good No2 {pause} not a leader {pause}. Now, you have a &quot;real&quot; leader. {long pause} Whether she&#x27;s leading you in the right direction ...&quot;

The record of Macmillan&#x27;s own premiership came under attack from the monetarists in the party, whose theories Thatcher supported. In a celebrated speech he wondered aloud where such theories had come from:

Macmillan was one of several people who advised Thatcher to set up a small War Cabinet to manage the Falklands War. On his advice she excluded the Treasury from this body. Having first inquired whether Argentina was known to have atomic weapons, Macmillan&#x27;s advice was to appoint a senior military advisor, as Pug Ismay had been in the Second World War (in the event Admiral Lewin, Chief of Defence Staff, performed this role). She had already received advice to exclude the Treasury from Frank Cooper (the Permanent Under-Secretary for Defence), not least because of Macmillan&#x27;s own behaviour, as Chancellor, in demanding a halt to the Suez operation. She later recalled: &#x27;I never regretted following Harold Macmillan&#x27;s advice. We were never tempted to compromise the security of our forces for financial reasons. Everything we did was governed by military necessity.&#x27;

With hereditary peerages again being created under Thatcher, Macmillan requested the earldom that had been customarily bestowed to departing prime ministers, and on 24 February 1984 he was created Earl of Stockton and Viscount Macmillan of Ovenden. He is the last non-royal recipient of a hereditary peerage. He took the title from his former parliamentary seat on the edge of the Durham coalfields, and in his maiden speech in the House of Lords he criticised Thatcher&#x27;s handling of the coal miners&#x27; strike and her characterisation of striking miners as &quot;the enemy within&quot;. He received an unprecedented standing ovation for his oration, which included the words:

As Chancellor of Oxford University, Macmillan condemned its refusal in February 1985 to award Thatcher an honorary degree. He noted that the decision represented a break with tradition, and predicted that the snub would rebound on the university.

Macmillan is widely supposed to have likened Thatcher&#x27;s policy of privatisation to &quot;selling the family silver&quot;. His precise quote, at a dinner of the Tory Reform Group at the Royal Overseas League on 8 November 1985, was on the subject of the sale of assets commonplace among individuals or states when they encountered financial difficulties: &quot;First of all the Georgian silver goes. And then all that nice furniture that used to be in the salon. Then the Canalettos go.&quot; Profitable parts of the steel industry and the railways had been privatised, along with British Telecom: &quot;They were like two Rembrandts still left.&quot;

Macmillan&#x27;s speech was much commented on, and a few days later he made a speech in the House of Lords, referring to it:

==Death and funeral==

Macmillan had often play-acted being an old man long before real old age set in. As early as 1948 Humphry Berkeley wrote of how &quot;he makes a show of being feeble and decrepit&quot;, mentioning how he had suddenly stopped shambling and sprinted for a train. Nigel Fisher tells an anecdote of how Macmillan initially greeted him to his house leaning on a stick, but later walked and climbed steps perfectly well, twice acting lame again and fetching his stick when he remembered his &quot;act&quot;. However, in genuine old age he became almost blind, causing him to need sticks and a helping arm.

On the evening of 29 December 1986, Macmillan died at Birch Grove, the Macmillan family mansion on the edge of Ashdown Forest, in Horsted Keynes, West Sussex. His grandson and heir Alexander, said: &quot;In the last 48 hours he was very weak but entirely reasonable and intelligent. His last words were, &#x27;I think I will go to sleep now&#x27;.&quot; His lifespan of 92 years and 322 days was the longest of any British prime minister until surpassed by James Callaghan on 14 February 2005.

Paying tribute, Thatcher hailed Macmillan as &quot;a very remarkable man and a very great patriot&quot;, and said that his dislike of &quot;selling the family silver&quot; had never come between them. He was &quot;unique in the affection of the British people&quot;. Additional tributes came from around the world. US President Ronald Reagan said: &quot;The American people share in the loss of a voice of wisdom and humanity who, with eloquence and gentle wit, brought to the problems of today the experience of a long life of public service.&quot; Outlawed African National Congress president Oliver Tambo sent his condolences: &#x27;As South Africans we shall always remember him for his efforts to encourage the apartheid regime to bow to the winds of change that continue to blow in South Africa.&#x27; Commonwealth Secretary-General Sir Shridath Ramphal affirmed: &quot;His own leadership in providing from Britain a worthy response to African national consciousness shaped the post-war era and made the modern Commonwealth possible.&quot;

A private funeral was held on 5 January 1987 at St Giles&#x27; Church, Horsted Keynes, West Sussex, where he had regularly worshipped and read the lesson. Two hundred mourners attended, including 64 members of the Macmillan family, Thatcher and former premiers Lord Home and Edward Heath, as well as Lord Hailsham, and &quot;scores of country neighbours&quot;. The Prince of Wales sent a wreath &quot;in admiring memory&quot;. He was buried beside his wife and next to his parents and his son Maurice, who had died in 1984.

The House of Commons paid its tribute on 12 January 1987, with much reference made to his book &quot;The Middle Way&quot;. Thatcher said: &quot;In his retirement Harold Macmillan occupied a unique place in the nation&#x27;s affections&quot;, while Labour leader Neil Kinnock struck a more critical note: Death and distance cannot lend sufficient enchantment to alter the view that the period over which he presided in the 1950s, while certainly and thankfully a period of rising affluence and confidence, was also a time of opportunities missed, of changes avoided. Harold Macmillan was, of course, not solely or even pre-eminently responsible for that. But we cannot but record with frustration the fact that the vigorous and perceptive attacker of the status quo in the 1930s became its emblem for a time in the late 1950s before returning to be its critic in the 1980s.

A public memorial service, attended by the Queen and thousands of mourners, was held on 10 February 1987 in Westminster Abbey. Macmillan&#x27;s estate was assessed for probate on 1 June 1987, with a value of £51,114 (equivalent to £ in ).

==Honours, awards and legacy==
Macmillan was an elected Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1962.

In 1976 he received the Order of Merit. In 1984 he received the Freedom medal from the Roosevelt Study Center.

Macmillan&#x27;s archives are located at Oxford University&#x27;s Bodleian Library.

Macmillan was awarded a number of honorary degrees, including:
* 1956 – Indiana University
* 1958 – DePauw University
* 1958 – Johns Hopkins University, together with Eisenhower
* 1961 – Cambridge University

===Historians&#x27; assessments of Macmillan&#x27;s premiership===
C. P. Snow wrote to Macmillan that his reputation would endure as, like Churchill, he was &quot;psychologically interesting&quot;.

An early biographer George Hutchinson called him &quot;The Last Edwardian at Number Ten&quot; (1980), mistakenly in the view of Nigel Fisher. Fisher described him as &quot;complex, almost chameleon&quot;. At times he portrayed himself as the descendant of a Scottish crofter, as a businessman, aristocrat, intellectual and soldier. Labour leader Harold Wilson wrote that his &quot;role as a poseur was itself a pose&quot;. Wilson also argued that behind the public nonchalance lay a real professional. Fisher also wrote that he &quot;had a talent for pursuing progressive policies but presenting them tactfully in a Conservative tone of voice&quot;.

Historian John Vincent explores the image Macmillan crafted of himself for his colleagues and constituents:

Alistair Horne, his official biographer, concedes that after his re-election in 1959 Macmillan&#x27;s premiership suffered a series of major setbacks.

Campbell writes that: &quot;a late developer who languished on the back benches ... in the 1930s, Macmillan seized his opportunity when it came with flair and ruthlessness, and [until about 1962] filled the highest office with compelling style&quot;. However, he argues that Macmillan is remembered as having been &quot;a rather seedy conjuror&quot;, famous for Premium Bonds, Beeching&#x27;s cuts to the railways, and the Profumo Scandal. He is also remembered for &quot;stop-go&quot; economics. In the 1980s the aged Macmillan was seen as &quot;a revered but slightly pathetic figure&quot;.

Dominic Sandbrook writes that Macmillan&#x27;s final weeks were typical of his premiership, &quot;devious, theatrical and self-seeking&quot;. Macmillan is best remembered for the &quot;affluent society&quot;, which he inherited rather than created in the late 1950s, but chancellors came and went and by the early 1960s economic policy was &quot;nothing short of a shambles&quot;, while his achievements in foreign policy made little difference to the lives of the public. By the time he left office, largely unlamented at the time, he was associated not with prosperity but with &quot;anachronism and decay&quot;.

D. R. Thorpe writes that by the early 1960s Macmillan was seen as &quot;the epitome of all that was wrong with anachronistic Britain. This was an unfair charge.&quot; &quot;The essence of his persona was as elusive as mercury.&quot; He was not a member of &quot;the Establishment&quot;—in fact he was a businessman who had &quot;married into&quot; the aristocracy and a rebel Chancellor of Oxford. &quot;He had style in abundance, (and) was a star on the world stage&quot;. Thorpe argues that despite his 1960 &quot;Winds of Change&quot; speech, he was largely pushed into rapid independence for African countries by Maudling and Macleod.

Richard Lamb argues that Macmillan was &quot;by far the best of Britain&#x27;s postwar Prime Ministers, and his administration performed better than any of their successors&quot;. Lamb argues that it is unfair to blame Macmillan for excessively quick African independence (resulting in many former colonies becoming dictatorships), or for the Beeching Plan (which was accepted by Labour in 1964, although Macmillan himself had reservations and had asked civil servants to draw up plans for extra road building), and argues that had he remained in power Macmillan would never have allowed inflation to get as far out of hand as it did in the 1970s.

<text>Born Yesterday is a play written by Garson Kanin which premiered on Broadway in 1946, starring Judy Holliday as Billie Dawn. The play was adapted into
a successful 1950 film of the same name.

== Plot ==
An uncouth, corrupt rich junk dealer, Harry Brock, brings his showgirl mistress Billie Dawn with him to Washington, D.C. When Billie&#x27;s ignorance becomes a liability to Brock&#x27;s business dealings, he hires a journalist, Paul Verrall, to educate his girlfriend. In the process of learning, Billie Dawn realizes how corrupt Harry is and begins interfering with his plans to bribe a Congressman into passing legislation that would allow Brock&#x27;s business to make more money.

== Productions ==

=== 1946 Original Broadway ===
&quot;Born Yesterday&quot; opened on February 4, 1946 on Broadway at the Lyceum Theatre and ran there until November 6, 1948; the play transferred to Henry Miller&#x27;s Theatre on November 9, 1948 and closed on December 31, 1949, after a total of 1,642 performances. it was the seventh longest-running non-musical play in Broadway history. Judy Holliday starred as Billie, with Paul Douglas as Harry Brock and Gary Merrill as Paul Verrall. Written and directed by Garson Kanin, the scenic design was by Donald Oenslager and costume design by Ruth Kanin. Jean Arthur was originally cast in the role of Billie but quit during tryouts.

For his performance as Harry Brock, Paul Douglas was awarded the 1946 Clarence Derwent Award for the most promising male performance.

;Original Broadway cast
* Paul Douglas – Harry Brock
* Judy Holliday – Billie Dawn
* Gary Merrill – Paul Verrall
* Carroll Ashburn – The Assistant Manager
* Frank Otto – Eddie Brock
* Larry Oliver – Senator Norval Hedges
* Mona Bruns – Mrs. Hedges
* C. L. Burke – Waiter
* Ellen Hall – Helen

Judy Holliday appeared as Billie Dawn in over 1,200 performances. Her replacements in the role included Jean Hagen and Jan Sterling.

=== Revival by Princeton University&#x27;s Summer Theater in 1950 ===
A production staged at Princeton University&#x27;s McCarter Theatre, directed by Herbert Kenwith and starring Shelley Winters as Billie Dawn and Judson Pratt as Harry Brock, debuted June 19, 1950 and was enthusiastically received by Daily Home News critic Jack Lewis, who notes that &quot;Kenwith&#x27;s direction is in no small way responsible for the success of the show. More notable, however, is his selection of Shelley Winters and Judson Pratt to play the key roles. And their handling of these assignments is what made &#x27;Born Yesterday&#x27; a laugh-filled experience for last night&#x27;s audience.&quot; A brief tour of New England venues—necessarily limited by Winters&#x27; prior commitment—ensued, to similarly glowing reviews.

=== Revival by the Negro Drama Group in 1953–54 ===
A production mounted by the Negro Drama Group at Broadway&#x27;s President Theatre, starring Edna Mae Robinson as Billie Dawn, Powell Lindsay as Harry Brock and Henry Scott as Paul Verrall, was given a full review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on January 1, 1954, with the theatre critic (signature L. C.) mentioning that &quot;...Mrs. Robinson is in private life the wife of Sugar Ray Robinson, the former welterweight and middleweight champion of the world&quot; and that she &quot;...is possessed of a natural flair for comedy. With some judicious direction she could go a long way toward achieving spectacular success in the theatre.&quot; Although the production received positive reviews, it closed after five days.

=== Watergate Era ===
According to theatre scholar Jordan Schildcrout, the Watergate scandal brought renewed interest in &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;, with a surge of productions in the early 1970s starring Betty Grable, Sandy Dennis, Chita Rivera, and Karen Valentine at major regional theatres, as well as Lynn Redgrave in a London revival directed by Tom Stoppard. The critic Michael Billington noted, &quot;With the Watergate scandal coming to a head, the play suddenly seems as fresh and relevant as the day it was written.&quot; Kanin himself later asserted, &quot;When the play was written it was a fable, but after Watergate it became a documentary.&quot;

=== 1989 Broadway revival ===
The play was revived on Broadway in 1989. It opened at the 46th Street Theatre in previews on January 18, 1989, officially on January 29, 1989, and closed on June 11, 1989 after 153 performances. It was directed by Josephine R. Abady and starred Edward Asner and Madeline Kahn, who received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Play.

<text>Year 368 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Cornelius, Praetextatus, Structus, Capitolinus, Crassus and Cicurinus (or, less frequently, year 386 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 368 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* While the previous year&#x27;s intervention by the Macedonians in Thessaly is successful, after the Macedonian troops withdraw, Alexander of Pherae treats his subjects as cruelly as before. So the Thessalians seek Thebes&#x27; support. Pelopidas is sent to their assistance, but is treacherously seized and imprisoned.
* In response, Epaminondas is reinstated in command of Theban troops and leads the Theban army into Thessaly, where he outmanoeuvres the Thessalians and secures the release of Pelopidas without a fight.
* At the instigation of Alexander&#x27;s brother-in-law, Ptolemy of Aloros, Alexander II of Macedon is assassinated during a festival. Although Alexander&#x27;s brother, Perdiccas III becomes the next king, he is under age, and Ptolemy is appointed regent.

==== China ====
* Zhou Xian Wang becomes king of the Zhou dynasty of China.

=== By topic ===
==== Philosophy ====
* Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; is completed. It lays down the rules for an ideal, righteous society and suggests that kings ought to be philosophers (or at least taught by philosophers).
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Events ==

=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* The Theban general, Epaminondas, again invades the Peloponnesus, but this time achieves little beyond winning Sicyon over to an alliance with Thebes. When he returns to Thebes, he is again put on trial, and again acquitted.
* Archidamus III, son of Agesilaus II of Sparta, commands a Spartan army which scores a victory over the Arcadians.
* Theban leader Pelopidas goes on an embassy to the Persian king Artaxerxes II and induces him to propose a settlement of the Greek states&#x27; disputes according to the wishes of the Thebans. Artaxerxes II issues an edict consisting of peace terms for the Greeks, but his edict is not obeyed by any of the Greek states.
* Aristotle arrives in Athens and teaches at Plato&#x27;s Academy.

==== Sicily ====
* Dionysius I of Syracuse dies and is succeeded as tyrant of the city by his son Dionysius II. As the younger Dionysius is weak and inexperienced, Dion, brother-in-law of the elder Dionysius, assumes control and persuades Plato, whose friendship he has acquired, to train the new tyrant in the practical application of his philosophical principles.
* Dionysius II makes peace with Carthage on the same terms established after his father&#x27;s defeat by Carthage in the previous decade.

==== Roman Republic ====
* During the ten-year period that Gaius Licinius (Calvus) Stolo is tribune in Rome (376 BC to 367 BC) he does much to reduce the enmity between patricians and plebs by reforming a number of laws. During his term, he proposes the Lex Licinia Sextia, which restores the consulship to the plebs, requires a plebeian consul seat, limits the amount of public land that one person can hold, and regulates debts. The patricians oppose these laws, though they are now finally passed and take effect from 366 BC.
* The temple to Concordia on the Forum Romanum in Rome is built by Marcus Furius Camillus.

=== By topic ===

==== Philosophy ====
* The Greek philosopher and scientist, Aristotle, goes to Athens as a pupil at Plato&#x27;s Academy.

== Births ==
* Ptolemy, Macedonian general, later founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt (d. 282 BC)

<text>Year 366 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Mamercinus and Lateranus (or, less frequently, year 388 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 366 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Persian Empire ====
* In Persia, a number of satraps of King Artaxerxes II begin a revolt, in alliance with Athens, Sparta, and Egypt, that lasts until 358 BC.

==== Greece ====
* Athens founds the town of Kos on the island of Kos in the Aegean Sea.
* Theban leader, Epaminondas, returns to the Peloponnesus for a third time, seeking to secure the allegiance of the states of Achaea. Although no army dares to challenge him in the field, the democratic governments he establishes there are short-lived, as pro-Spartan aristocrats soon return to the cities, reestablish the oligarchies, and bind their cities ever more closely to Sparta.
* Thebes makes peace with Sparta and then turns its attention on Athens, which is trying to revive its maritime empire and is interfering in Macedonian dynastic quarrels.
* Thebes captures the city of Oropus.

==== Sicily ====
* The experiment by Dion (brother-in-law of Dionysius I) and Plato to educate the new ruler of Syracuse, Dionysius II, in the practical application of Plato&#x27;s philosophical principles fails and Dion and Plato are banished from Syracuse.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The use of military tribunes with consular power is abandoned permanently and the dual consulship is restored. A new magistracy is established, which is called the praetorship. Its holder, the praetor, is elected annually by the Assembly and takes charge of civil matters, thus relieving the consuls of this responsibility. The praetor is regarded as a junior colleague of the consuls. Nevertheless, the praetor can command an army, convene a Senate or an assembly, as well as exercise the consular functions.
* Two additional aediles, called curule (&quot;higher&quot;) aediles, are created in the Roman hierarchy. These are at first patricians; but those of the next year are plebeians and so on year by year alternately. They are elected in the assembly of the tribes, with the consul presiding.

=== By topic ===
==== Arts ====
* &quot;The Abduction of Persephone&quot;, detail of a wall painting in Tomb I (Small Tomb) in Vergina, Macedonia, is made (approximate date).

<text>Eleutherios or Lefteris (, &quot;the liberator&quot;) is an epithet and formal attribution in the Greek pantheon, including:

* Dionysus
* Eros
* Zeus

From Eleuther, son of Apollo and Aethusa.

# He is renowned for having an excellent singing voice, which earned him a victory at the Pythian games,
# and for having been the first to erect a statue of Dionysus.
# as well as for having given his name to Eleutherae.
# His sons were Iasius.
# and Pierus. He also had several daughters, who spoke impiously of the image of Dionysus wearing a black aegis, and were driven mad by the god; as a remedy, Eleuther, in accordance with an oracle, established a cult of &quot;Dionysus of the Black Aegis&quot;.
# Eleuther, a variant of the name Eleutherios, early Greek god who was the son of Zeus and probably an alternate name of Dionysus.
# Eleuther, one of the twenty sons of Lycaon. He and his brother Lebadus were the only not guilty of the abomination prepared for Zeus, and fled to Boeotia.
# Eleuther, one of the Curetes, was said to have been the eponym of the towns Eleutherae and Eleuthernae in Crete.

<doc id="80944" wikidata="Q1144850" url="?curid=80944" title="Father of the Bride (1950 film)">
<text>Father of the Bride is a 1950 American romantic comedy film directed by Vincente Minnelli from a screenplay by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, based on the 1949 novel of the same name by Edward Streeter. The film stars Spencer Tracy, Joan Bennett, and Elizabeth Taylor, and follows a man trying to cope with preparations for his daughter&#x27;s wedding. &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Writing, Screenplay, and Best Actor in a Leading Role (for Tracy).

==Plot==

In the aftermath of the wedding of his daughter Kay, Stanley T. Banks, a successful middle-aged lawyer, recalls the day three months earlier when he first learned of her engagement to Buckley. Kay&#x27;s casual announcement at the dinner table of the family&#x27;s comfortable suburban home that she is in love with him and has accepted his proposal makes Stanley feel uneasy, but he soon recognizes that his daughter has grown up and the wedding is inevitable. While Ellie, Kay&#x27;s mother, immediately begins making preparations, Stanley lies awake at night, fearing the worst for his daughter.

Stanley&#x27;s misgivings about the marriage eventually make Ellie anxious. Stanley insists that Kay present Buckley for a financial sit-down. She calls the tradition &quot;old-fashioned rigamarole&quot;, but produces him nevertheless. After spending the entire time talking about himself, Stanley is pleased to learn later from Ellie that Buckley is the head of his own small company and is indeed capable of providing a comfortable life for Kay. The Bankses&#x27; first meeting with Buckley&#x27;s wealthy parents, Doris and Herbert Dunstan, starts awkwardly, careens animatedly, then tails off when Stanley drinks too much and falls asleep upright on their couch.

Stanley misses out on Kay and Buckley&#x27;s engagement party, marooned in the kitchen playing bartender. In its wake, he realizes that any hope for a small wedding has been swept aside, and there will be no escaping paying for an extravagant affair &quot;with all the trimmings&quot;. As costs for the June event spiral out of control, Stanley calculates that he can afford to accommodate no more than 150 guests. The task of paring down the list proves too difficult for everyone involved, however, and he reluctantly consents to an extra 100. Growing rattled, he suggests to Kay that she and Buckley elope. Kay is initially shocked by the suggestion, but has a change of heart that she shares with her mother. Ellie, who has long mourned never having had the wedding planned for Kay, strongly disapproves. Quick on his feet, Stanley plays it off as if it had been Kay&#x27;s idea.

Wedding plans continue until Kay calls off the wedding, appalled that Buckley has decided to take her on a fishing trip in Nova Scotia for their honeymoon. However, Kay and Buckley soon reconcile, and the two families begin wedding rehearsals.

On the day of the wedding, chaos ensues at the Banks home during final preparations for the reception. The wedding ceremony brings both joy and sorrow to Stanley, as he concedes that his daughter is now a woman and no longer his child. During the reception, Stanley tries to find Kay so he can kiss the bride but only manages to see her leaving in a spray of confetti. Afterward, Ellie and Stanley survey the mess in their home and concur that the entire affair was a great success. Kay calls and tells her father she loves him and thanks her parents for everything they have done for her.

==Cast==
==Production==
According to Frank Miller for TCM, when creating the role for the father, the character was shaped around Spencer Tracy. Minnelli believed Tracy was capable of handling a role that balanced humor with fatherly tenderness. After some miscommunication with the producers, Jack Benny was brought in for a reading. He was too comedic and couldn’t handle the dramatic aspects of the film. When Tracy heard another actor was being tested, he turned down the movie. Minnelli asked Katharine Hepburn to invite Tracy to a dinner party where he later convinced Tracy to join the production.

Tracy then wanted Hepburn for his screen wife, but it was felt that they were too romantic a team to play a happily domesticated couple with children, so Joan Bennett, who had previously co-starred with Hepburn in the 1933 film version of &quot;Little Women&quot; and Tracy in the 1932 motion pictures &quot;She Wanted a Millionaire&quot; and &quot;Me and My Gal&quot;, got the part.

==Release==
The film premiered on May 18, 1950, at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The premiere of &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; took place 12 days after Taylor&#x27;s real-life marriage to her first husband Nicky Hilton, an event that MGM exploited in its publicity campaign for the picture. Helen Rose, who designed Taylor&#x27;s gown for the film, also designed her wedding gown.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was one of the top-grossing films of the year, earning $6,084,000 worldwide ($4,036,000 in the United States and Canada and $2,048,000 overseas), a fivefold return on its $1,215,000 budget. It did so well that MGM registered the title &quot;Now I&#x27;m a Grandfather&quot; and negotiated rights for a sequel with Streeter.

===Critical response===
Reviews from critics were generally positive. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;equally wonderful&quot; when compared to the book, with &quot;all the warmth and poignancy and understanding that makes the Streeter treatise much beloved.&quot; Of Tracy&#x27;s performance Crowther wrote, &quot;As a father, torn by jealousy, devotion, pride and righteous wrath, Mr. Tracy is tops.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;the second strong comedy in a row for Spencer Tracy,&quot; with &quot;plenty to enjoy during the speedy 92 minutes.&quot;

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote, &quot;Crammed with laughs, it is a mirthful, warmly appealing entertainment that is sure to be a crowd pleaser.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a cheerful package of smiles and laughter. You&#x27;ll enjoy it.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was more dismissive of the film, calling the jokes &quot;rather wheezy, and they certainly don&#x27;t do much to speed up the picture. Since the plot consists simply of outlining the difficulties of putting on a wedding, including, of course, the damnable expense of it all, it grows a little tiresome after a half hour or so.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;With a terrific script, great performances from Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor, and assured direction from Vincent Minnelli, &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; endures as a sparkling comedy of its era.&quot;

==Sequels and adaptations==
Pleased with the commercial and critical success of &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;, MGM rushed a sequel into production the following year, called &quot;Father&#x27;s Little Dividend&quot;, in which Taylor&#x27;s character has a baby. The film was also adapted into a television series of the same name, which aired on CBS during the 1961–62 season and stars Leon Ames (Stan), Ruth Warrick (Ellie), and Myrna Fahey (Kay).

In 1991, a remake of the same name was made starring Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, and Kimberly Williams as the bride. It produced the sequel, &quot;Father of the Bride Part II&quot;, in 1995, with the same cast. As in the original&#x27;s sequel, the bride gives birth to her first child, also a son. A plot line added to the sequel is that the bride&#x27;s mother unexpectedly becomes pregnant, as well. A 3rd film was released in 2020 titled &quot;Father of the Bride Part 3(ish).&quot; It was a short film. The film was also remade in Tamil as &quot;Abhiyum Naanum&quot; (2008), and in Kannada as &quot;Naanu Nanna Kanasu&quot; (2010).

A 2nd remake featuring a Hispanic family was released on June 16, 2022, on HBO Max.

==Recognition==
&quot;Father of the Bride&quot; was featured in Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, being screened in the local movie theater.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – 83

==Home media==
The original negative was destroyed in a fire in 1978, and all home media released have been sourced from a fine grain master positive. The film was released on DVD in June 2004. It was given an extensive digital restoration and released on Blu-ray by the Warner Archive Collection in May 2016.

<doc id="80945" wikidata="Q2633131" url="?curid=80945" title="Elpis (mythology)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Elpis () is the minor goddess (daimon) of hope, about which the Greeks had ambivalent feelings. She was never the centre of a cult, as was Spes, her Roman equivalent, and was chiefly the subject of ambiguous Greek aetiological myths.

== Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot; ==
Elpis was the remaining item enclosed in Pandora&#x27;s box (or jar), the best known form of the myth found in Hesiod’s &quot;Works and Days&quot;. There Hesiod expands upon the misery inflicted on mankind through the curiosity of Pandora. She had brought with her as a wedding gift from heaven a storage jar but when this was opened it released a host of human ills before the lid could be secured again. 
&lt;poem&gt;
Only Hope was left within her unbreakable house,
she remained under the lip of the jar and did not
fly away. Before [she could], Pandora replaced the
lid of the jar. This was the will of aegis-bearing
Zeus the Cloudgatherer.&lt;/poem&gt;

Based on Hesiod&#x27;s description, there has been debate whether Elpis was only a delusive belief in good things to follow, or more generally &quot;expectation&quot;. According to the Classical commentator Willem Jacob Verdenius, the question hinges on whether the jar served to preserve &quot;elpis&quot; for man as a blessing, or was intended to keep men free of the curse of &quot;elpis&quot;. Was hope left to comfort man in his misery or was it the idle hope in which the lazy indulge when they should be working honestly for a living? In either case, &quot;it is not possible to escape the mind of Zeus&quot;.

Where Hesiod&#x27;s container was a prison of curses subsequently released on mankind, the poet Babrius preserved a later alternative Aesopic aetiology in which the jar contained blessings meant for mankind which then fled back to the heavenly realm. In this case Elpis is plainly seen as a divine gift now kept earth-bound.

As a consequence of this ambiguity, Greeks had ambivalent or even negative feelings about &quot;hope&quot;. In his play &quot;The Suppliants&quot;, Euripides has a herald describe Elpis as &quot;man&#x27;s curse; many a state hath it involved in strife&quot;. In addition, the concept was unimportant in the philosophical systems of the Stoics and Epicureans. On the positive side, Pindar bestows on Elpis the adjective &quot;sweet&quot; (fragment 214) and Sophocles has a character in Oedipus Rex refer to &quot;immortal Pheme (Report), child of golden Elpis&quot;.

==Spes==
The Roman cult figure of Spes (Hope) - &quot;good hope&quot; as she was often addressed - is very different. On coinage and in statues, she is depicted as a young maiden in archaic dress with a flower offered in her right hand and holding up the hem of her skirt in the left.

<text>Elymus () was the supposed Trojan ancestor of the Elymians (), an indigenous people of Sicily, in Greek and Roman legend.

==Legends==
Elymus was a Trojan, a natural son of Anchises and the half-brother of Eryx through Aphrodite. Previous to the emigration of Aeneas, also a son of Anchises, Elymus and Acestes had fled from Troy to Sicily, and had settled on the banks of the river Crinisus, in the country of the Sicani. When afterwards the Trojan refugees led by Aeneas also arrived there, Elymus built for them the towns of Segesta and Elyme, and the Trojans who settled in that part of Sicily called themselves Elymi, after Elymus.

Strabo calls him Elymnus, and says that he went to Sicily with Aeneas, and that they together took possession of the cities of Eryx and Lilybaeum. Elymus was further believed to have founded Asca and Entella in Sicily.

In the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Vergil has Elymnus competing in the funeral games held on Sicily for Anchises, in the footrace in which Nisus and Euryalus are introduced. As Helymus, he is also listed among the competitors by Hyginus, who says he finished second to Euryalus and was awarded an Amazonian quiver.

<doc id="80949" wikidata="Q43944" url="?curid=80949" title="Hamid Karzai">
<text>Hamid Karzai (; Pashto/, , ; born 24 December 1957) is an Afghan statesman who served as the fourth president of Afghanistan from June 2002 to September 2014, including as the first elected president of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan from December 2004 to September 2014. He previously served as Chairman of the Afghan Interim Administration from December 2001 to July 2002. He is the chief (&quot;khān&quot;) of the Popalzai Durrani tribe of Pashtuns in Kandahar Province.

Born in Kandahar, Karzai graduated from Habibia High School in Kabul and later received a master&#x27;s degree in India in the 1980s. He moved to Pakistan where he was active as a fundraiser for the Afghan rebels during the Soviet–Afghan War (1979–1989) and its aftermath. He briefly served as Deputy Foreign Minister in the Islamic State of Afghanistan government. In July 1999, Karzai&#x27;s father was assassinated and Karzai succeeded him as head of the Popalzai tribe. In October 2001 the United States invasion of Afghanistan began and Karzai led the Pashtun tribes in and around Kandahar in an uprising against the Taliban; he became a dominant political figure after the removal of the Taliban regime in late 2001. During the December 2001 International Conference on Afghanistan in Germany, Karzai was selected by prominent Afghan political figures to serve a six-month term as chairman of the Interim Administration.

He was then chosen for a two-year term as interim president during the 2002 loya jirga (grand assembly) that was held in Kabul, Afghanistan. After the 2004 presidential election, Karzai was declared the winner and became President of Afghanistan. He won a second five-year term in the 2009 presidential election; this term ended in September 2014, and he was succeeded by Ashraf Ghani.

During his presidency, Karzai was known in the international community for being an alliance builder between Afghanistan&#x27;s communities. In later years, his relationship with NATO and the United States became increasingly strained, and he has been accused several times of corruption. He called the Taliban his brothers and warned that the heavy-handed counterinsurgency in Afghanistan would only revive the Taliban insurgency against the former Afghan government, urging the US to instead focus on bringing Pakistan&#x27;s support for the Taliban leadership to heel, but the US largely ignored his requests. After the Taliban takeover of Kabul in 2021, Karzai stated the Taliban did not capture the city by force, but rather were invited by him in order to prevent chaos. He said that in order to gain international recognition, the new Taliban government needed internal legitimacy, which could be achieved through a general election or &quot;loya jirga&quot;.

==Early life and beginning of political career==
Karzai was born on 24 December 1957 in the Karz area of Kandahar City in southern Afghanistan. He is an ethnic Pashtun descended from the khans, or traditional chiefs, of the Popalzai Pashtun tribe. His father, Abdul Ahad Karzai, served as the Deputy Speaker of the Afghan Parliament during the 1960s. His grandfather, Khair Mohammad Khan, had fought in the 1919 Third Anglo-Afghan War and was the Deputy Speaker of the Senate. The Karzai family were monarchists and remained strong supporters of Mohammed Zahir Shah, the last king of Afghanistan. His uncle, Habibullah Karzai, served as the Afghan representative at the UN and is said to have accompanied King Zahir to the United States in the early 1960s for a special meeting with U.S. President John F. Kennedy.

Hamid Karzai attended Mahmood Hotaki Primary School in Kandahar and Sayed Jamaluddin Afghani School in Kabul. He graduated from Habibia High School in Kabul in 1976. After graduating, he went to India as an exchange student in 1976, and studied for a master&#x27;s degree in international relations and political science at Himachal Pradesh University, obtaining his degree in 1983. Karzai then moved to Pakistan and worked as a fundraiser for the anti-communist Afghan rebels during their 1980s uprising against the rule of Soviet-backed Afghan Mohammad Najibullah.

Hamid Karzai returned to Afghanistan in early October 1988, late in the war, to assist in the rebel victory in Tarinkot. He assisted in mobilizing the Popalzai and the other Durrani tribes and helped to drive Najibullah&#x27;s regime from the city. Karzai also helped negotiate the defection of five hundred of Najibullah&#x27;s soldiers. When Najibullah&#x27;s pro-Soviet government collapsed in 1992, the Peshawar Accords agreed upon by the Afghan political parties established the Islamic State of Afghanistan and appointed an interim government to be followed by general elections. Karzai accompanied the first mujahideen leaders into Kabul after President Najibullah stepped down in 1992. He served as Deputy Foreign Minister in the government of Burhanuddin Rabbani. Karzai was arrested, however, by Mohammad Fahim (who would later become Karzai&#x27;s Vice President) on charges of spying for Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in what Karzai claimed was an effort to negotiate between Hekmatyar&#x27;s forces and Rabbani&#x27;s government. Karzai fled from Kabul in a vehicle provided by Hekmatyar and driven by Gul Rahman.

When the Taliban emerged in the mid-1990s, Karzai initially recognized them as the legitimate government because he thought that they would stop the violence and corruption in the country. He was requested by the Taliban to serve as their ambassador, but refused, telling friends that he felt Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) was wrongly using them. Karzai then wanted to represent the Taliban government for the UN, but the Taliban leader did not trust Karzai due to him having many links with westerners. Karzai lived in the Pakistani city of Quetta among many other Afghan refugees, where he worked to reinstate former Afghan king Zahir Shah, meeting the king in Italy several times. He also visited the western embassies including the U.S. embassy in Islamabad several times, talking with UN diplomat Norbert Holl, and attempted to gain American support for &quot;modern, educated Afghans&quot; to weaken the Taliban&#x27;s views. Karzai&#x27;s father was reportedly annoyed with him for not making clear-cut choices and wanting to be friends with everyone.

In July 1999, Karzai&#x27;s father, Abdul Ahad Karzai, was shot dead early in the morning while returning home from a mosque in Quetta. Reports suggest that the Taliban carried out the assassination. Following this incident, Karzai took over as khan of the tribe and decided to work closely with the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, which was led by Ahmad Shah Massoud.

In 2000 and 2001, he travelled to Europe and the United States to help gather support for the anti-Taliban movement. &quot;Massoud and Karzai warned the United States that the Taliban were connected with al Qaeda and that there was a plot for an imminent attack on the United States, but their warnings went unheeded. On September 9, 2001, two days before the September 11 attacks in the US, Massoud was assassinated by al Qaeda agents in a suicide bombing.&quot; As the U.S. Armed Forces were preparing for a confrontation with the Taliban in September 2001, Karzai began urging NATO states to purge his country of al-Qaeda. He said in a BBC interview, &quot;These Arabs, together with their foreign supporters and the Taliban, destroyed miles and miles of homes and orchards and vineyards ... They have killed Afghans. They have trained their guns on Afghan lives ... We want them out.&quot;

==President and chairman of a transitional administration==

Karzai had been a US CIA contact, and was well regarded by the CIA. After the 7 October 2001 launch of Operation Enduring Freedom, the United Front (Northern Alliance) worked with teams of U.S. special forces and together they overthrew the Taliban regime and mustered support for a new government in Afghanistan. Karzai and his group were in Quetta, where they began a covert operation. Later, many would claim that at this moment the US decided that Karzai should be the next leader of Afghanistan. Before entering Afghanistan, he warned his fighters:

Karzai gathered several hundred fighters from his tribe, but were attacked by the Taliban. Karzai barely survived, and used his contacts with the CIA to call for an airlift. On 4 November 2001, American special operation forces flew Karzai out of Afghanistan for protection. On 5 December 2001, Hamid Karzai and his group of fighters survived a friendly fire missile attack by U.S. Air Force pilots in southern Afghanistan. The group suffered injuries and was treated in the United States; Karzai received injuries to his facial nerves, as can sometimes be noticed during his speeches.

In December 2001, political leaders gathered in Germany to agree on new leadership structures. Under 5 December Bonn Agreement, they formed an Interim Administration and named Karzai Chairman of a 29-member governing committee. He was sworn in as the leader on 22 December. The loya jirga of 13 June 2002 appointed Karzai as Interim President of the new position as President of the Afghan Transitional Administration. Former members of the Northern Alliance remained extremely influential, most notably Vice President Mohammed Fahim, who also served as the Defense Minister.

Karzai re-enacted the original coronation of Ahmad Shah Durrani at the shrine of Sher-i-Surkh outside Kandahar, where he had leaders of various Afghan tribes, including a descendant of the religious leader (Sabir Shah) who originally selected Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1747, as key players in this event. Further evidence that Karzai views himself fulfilling a Durrani monarch&#x27;s role arises from statements furnished by close allies within his government. His late brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, made statements to a similar effect.

As part of his efforts to unite Afghanistan&#x27;s ethnicities, Karzai favored an Afghan dress that combines traditional design features from the various ethnics – Pashtun-style long shirt and loose trousers, an outer robe popular among the Tajiks and Uzbeks, and most distinctively a &quot;karakul&quot; hat worn by highlanders from the valley of Panjshir. In 2002 designer Tom Ford, who worked at the time for Gucci, was quoted calling Karzai &quot;the most chic man in the world&quot;.

After Karzai was installed into power, his actual authority outside the capital city of Kabul was said to be so limited that he was often derided as the &quot;Mayor of Kabul&quot;. The situation was particularly delicate since Karzai and his administration have not been equipped either financially or politically to influence reforms outside of the region around Kabul. Other areas, particularly the more remote ones, have historically been under the influence of various local leaders. Karzai has been, to varying degrees of success, attempting to negotiate and form amicable alliances with them for the benefit of Afghanistan as a whole, instead of aggressively fighting them and risking an uprising.

In 2004, he rejected an international proposal to end poppy production in Afghanistan through aerial spraying of chemical herbicides, fearing that it would harm the economic situation of his countrymen. Moreover, Karzai&#x27;s younger brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai – who partially helped finance Karzai&#x27;s presidential campaign – was rumored to be involved in narcotic deals. James Risen of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and others stated that Ahmed Wali Karzai may have been involved in the Afghan opium and heroin trade. This was denied by Karzai, who called the charges political propaganda and stated he was a &quot;victim of vicious politics&quot;.

==2004 Afghan presidential election==
When Karzai was a candidate in the October 2004 presidential election, he won 21 of the 34 provinces, defeating his 22 opponents and becoming the first democratically elected leader of Afghanistan.

Although his campaigning was limited due to fears of violence, elections passed without significant incident. Following an investigation by the United Nations of alleged voting irregularities, the national election commission in early November declared Karzai winner, without a runoff, with 55.4% of the vote. This represented 4.3 million of the total 8.1 million votes cast. The election took place safely in spite of a surge of insurgent activity.

Karzai was sworn in as President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan on 7 December 2004, at a formal ceremony in Kabul. Many interpreted the ceremony as a symbolically important &quot;new start&quot; for the war-torn nation. Notable guests at the inauguration included the country&#x27;s former King, Zahir Shah, three former U.S. presidents, and U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney.

==Presidency==
===First term (2004–2009)===
After winning a democratic mandate in the 2004 election, it was thought that Karzai would pursue a more aggressively reformist path in 2005. However, Karzai has proved to be more cautious than was expected. After his new administration took over in 2004, the economy of Afghanistan began growing rapidly for the first time in many years. Government revenue began increasing every year, although it is still heavily dependent on foreign aid.

During the first term in Karzai&#x27;s presidency, public discontent grew about corruption and the civilian casualties in the 2001–14. In May 2006, an anti-American and anti-Karzai riot took place in Kabul which left at least seven people dead and 40 injured. In May 2007, after as many as 51 Afghan civilians were killed in a bombing, Karzai asserted that his government &quot;can no longer accept&quot; casualties caused by U.S. and NATO operations.

In September 2006, Karzai told the United Nations General Assembly that Afghanistan has become the &quot;worst victim&quot; of terrorism. Karzai said terrorism is rebounding in his country, with militants infiltrating the borders to wage attacks on civilians. He stated, &quot;This does not have its seeds alone in Afghanistan. Military action in the country will, therefore, not deliver the shared goal of eliminating terrorism.&quot; He demanded assistance from the international community to destroy terrorist sanctuaries inside and outside Afghanistan. &quot;You have to look beyond Afghanistan to the sources of terrorism&quot;, he told the UN General Assembly, and &quot;destroy terrorist sanctuaries beyond&quot; the country, dismantle the elaborate networks in the region that recruit, indoctrinate, train, finance, arm, and deploy terrorists. These activities are also robbing thousands of Afghan children of their right to education, and prevent health workers from doing their jobs in Afghanistan. In addition, he promised to eliminate opium-poppy cultivation in his country, which is possibly helping fuel the ongoing Taliban insurgency. He has repeatedly demanded that NATO forces take more care to avoid civilian casualties when conducting military operations in residential areas. In a September 2006 video broadcast, Karzai stated that if the money wasted on the Iraq War had been actually spent on rebuilding Afghanistan, his country would &quot;be in heaven in less than one year&quot;.

===2009 re-election and second term===

On the eve of the presidential election on 20 August, Karzai seemed at once deeply unpopular but also likely to win the majority of the votes. He was blamed by many for the failures that plagued the reconstruction of Afghanistan after the toppling of the Taliban government in 2001, from the widespread corruption and the resurgence of the (neo-)Taliban to the explosion of the poppy trade. His unpopularity and the likelihood of his victory formed an atmosphere with a kind of national demoralization, which could discourage many Afghans from voting and dash hopes for substantial progress after the election.

In this second presidential election, Karzai was announced to have received over 50% of the votes. The election was tainted by lack of security, low voter turnout and widespread ballot stuffing, intimidation, and other electoral fraud.

Two months later Karzai accepted calls for a second round run-off vote, which was scheduled for 7 November 2009.

During the runoff, he secured the support of influential power brokers, including the Ismailis in Afghanistan, represented locally by Sayed Mansur Naderi. Naderi facilitated two significant campaign rallies for him, one in Kayan, his birthplace, and another in the Kabul stadium. Both events attracted nearly a hundred thousand attendees, including men, women, and youths, demonstrating the support of the Afghan Ismailis for Hamid Karzai.

On 2 November 2009, Karzai&#x27;s run-off opponent, Abdullah Abdullah, withdrew from the race and election officials announced the cancellation of the run-off race. Karzai, the only remaining contender, was declared the winner a short time later.

Karzai presented his first list of 24 cabinet nominees to the Afghan parliament on 19 December 2009; however, on 2 January 2010, the parliament rejected 17 of these. According to the parliament, most of the nominees were rejected due to having been picked for reasons other than their competency. A member of parliament said that they had been picked largely based on &quot;ethnicity or bribery or money&quot;.
On 16 January 2010, the Afghan parliament rejected 10 of the Karzai&#x27;s 17 replacement picks for the cabinet. MPs complained that Karzai&#x27;s new choices were either not qualified for their posts or had close connections to Afghan warlords. Despite the second setback, by mid-January Karzai had 14 out of the 24 ministers confirmed, including the most powerful posts at foreign, defense and interior ministries. Shortly afterward, the parliament began its winter recess, lasting until 20 February, without waiting for Karzai to select additional names for his cabinet. The move not only extended the political uncertainty in the government but also dealt Karzai the embarrassment of appearing at the London Conference on Afghanistan with nearly half of his cabinet devoid of leaders.

Since late 2001 Karzai has been trying for peace in his country, going as far as pardoning militants that lay down weapons and join the rebuilding process. However, his offers were not accepted by the militant groups. In April 2007, Karzai acknowledged that he spoke to some militants about trying to bring peace in Afghanistan. He noted that the Afghan militants are always welcome in the country, although foreign insurgents are not. In September 2007, Karzai again offered talks with militant fighters after a security scare forced him to end a commemoration speech. Karzai left the event and was taken back to his palace, where he was due to meet visiting Latvian President Valdis Zatlers. After the meeting, the pair held a joint news conference, at which Karzai called for talks with his Taliban foes. &quot;We don&#x27;t have any formal negotiations with the Taliban. They don&#x27;t have an address. Who do we talk to?&quot; Karzai told reporters. He further stated: &quot;If I can have a place where to send somebody to talk to, an authority that publicly says it is the Taliban authority, I will do it.&quot;

In December 2009 Karzai announced to move ahead with a Loya Jirga (large assembly) to discuss the Taliban insurgency in which the Taliban representatives would be invited to take part in this Jirga. In January 2010, Karzai set the framework for dialogue with Taliban leaders when he called on the group&#x27;s leadership to take part in the jirga to initiate peace talks. A Taliban spokesman declined to talk in detail about Karzai&#x27;s offer and only said the militants would make a decision soon. In April 2010, Karzai urged Taliban insurgents to lay down their arms and air their grievances while visiting a violent northern province, adding that foreign forces would not leave the country as long as fighting continued. In July 2010, Karzai approved a plan intended to win over Taliban foot soldiers and low-level commanders. In mid-August 2013, Attorney General Mohammad Ishaq Aloko was said to have been fired after meeting with Taliban officials in the U.A.E. after being told not to meet with them. However, unnamed senior cabinet officials tried to persuade Karzai to not fire him, while an official in Aloko&#x27;s office denied the dismissal saying instead that he was at the Presidential Palace &quot;celebrating Independence Day&quot;.

===Foreign relations===



Karzai&#x27;s relations with NATO countries was strong, especially with the United States, due to the fact that it was the leading nation helping to rebuild war-torn Afghanistan. Karzai enjoyed a very friendly and strong strategic partnership with the United States, despite various disagreements. The U.S. had supported him since late 2001 to lead his nation. He has made many important diplomatic trips to the United States and other NATO countries. In August 2007, Karzai was invited to Camp David in Maryland, USA, for a special meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush. The United States has set up a special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is headed by Marc Grossman. His task is to serve as a mediator and solve issues between the three nations.

However, in later years the relations between U.S. and Karzai had become strained, particularly Karzai had been very critical of U.S. military because of their high-level of civilian casualties. In 2019 he described a &quot;major fight&quot; he had with American military officials back in 2007, when Karzai repeatedly told them: &quot;If you want to fight terrorism and bad people, I won&#x27;t stop you, but please leave the Afghan people alone&quot;. In a retrospective interview, Karzai claimed he felt that he was being used as a tool by the United States.

Further strain in relations with the United States resulted in 2014, when Afghanistan, joined Cuba, Nicaragua, North Korea, Syria, and Venezuela as the only countries to recognize the Russian annexation of Crimea. The United States, European countries, and most other nations wholeheartedly condemned the Russian takeover, as well as the validity of the subsequent Crimean Referendum on its annexation to Russia. Citing &quot;the free will of the Crimean people&quot;, the office of President Hamid Karzai said, &quot;We respect the decision the people of Crimea took through a recent referendum that considers Crimea as part of the Russian Federation.&quot;

Karzai&#x27;s relations with neighboring Pakistan were good, especially with the Awami National Party (ANP) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). He often describes his nation and Pakistan as &quot;inseparable twin brothers&quot;, a reference to the disputed Durand Line border between the two states, despite the many border skirmishes that occurred during his presidency. In December 2007, Karzai and his delegates traveled to Islamabad, Pakistan, for a usual meeting with Pervez Musharraf on trade ties and intelligence sharing between the two Islamic states. Karzai also met and had a 45-minute talk with Benazir Bhutto on the morning of 27 December, hours before her trip to Liaquat National Bagh, where she was assassinated after her speech. After Bhutto&#x27;s death, Karzai called her his sister and a brave woman who had a clear vision &quot;for her own country, for Afghanistan, and for the region – a vision of democracy, prosperity, and peace&quot;. In September 2008, Karzai was invited on a special visit to witness the swearing-in ceremony of Asif Ali Zardari, who became the President of Pakistan. Relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan have improved after the PPP party took over in 2008. The two nations often make contacts with one another concerning the war on terrorism and trade. Pakistan even allowed NATO forces stationed in Afghanistan to launch attacks on militant groups in Pakistan. This was something strongly opposed by the previous government of Pakistan. The two states finally signed into law long-awaited Afghanistan–Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement in 2011, intended to improve trade. Karzai acknowledges Pakistan&#x27;s meddling in Afghanistan&#x27;s wars, but said in a 2015 interview that Afghanistan wants a &quot;friendly relationship but not to be under Pakistan&#x27;s thumb&quot;.

Karzai believed that Iran is a friend although the U.S. often claims that neighboring Iran is meddling in Afghanistan&#x27;s affairs.

In 2007, Karzai said that Iran, so far, had been a helper in the reconstruction process. He acknowledged in 2010 that the Government of Iran had been providing millions of dollars directly to his office. In October 2007, Karzai again rejected Western accusations against Iran, stating, &quot;We have resisted the negative propaganda launched by foreign states against the Islamic Republic, and we stress that aliens&#x27; propaganda should not leave a negative impact on the consolidated ties between the two great nations of Iran and Afghanistan.&quot; Karzai added, &quot;The two Iranian and Afghan nations are close to each other due to their bonds and commonalities, they belong to the same house, and they will live alongside each other for good.&quot;
Some international criticism has centered around the government of Karzai in early 2009 for failing to secure the country from Taliban attacks, systemic governmental corruption, and widespread claims of electoral fraud in the 2009 Afghan presidential election. Karzai staunchly defended the election balloting, stating that some statements criticizing the balloting and vote count were &quot;totally fabricated&quot;. He told the media that, &quot;There were instances of fraud, no doubt ... There were irregularities ... But the election as a whole was good and free and democratic.&quot; He further went on to say that, &quot;Afghanistan has its separate problems and we have to handle them as Afghanistan finds it feasible ... This country was completely destroyed ... Today, we are talking about fighting corruption in Afghanistan, improved legal standards ... You see the glass half empty or half full. I see it as half full. Others see it as half empty.&quot; A 2019 &quot;Washington Post&quot; report described Karzai as ruling a &quot;corrupt&quot; government that was tolerated by the United States.

In June 2010, Karzai travelled to Japan for a five-day visit where the two nations discussed a new aid provided by the hosting nation and the untapped mineral resources recently announced. Karzai invited Japanese companies such as Mitsubishi and others to invest in Afghan mining projects. He told Japanese officials that Japan would be given priority in the bid to explore its resources. He stated, &quot;morally, Afghanistan should give access as a priority to those countries that have helped Afghanistan massively in the past few years.&quot; While in Japan, Karzai also made his first visit to Hiroshima to pray for the atomic bomb victims. Japan has provided billions of dollars in aid to Afghanistan since the beginning of 2002.

On 16 July 2014, President Karzai held a special cabinet meeting where he condemned the Israeli attacks on Gaza and the killings of civilians while pledging $500,000 USD in aid to Gaza.

Relations between Karzai and India have always been friendly; he attended university there. Afghanistan–India relations began getting stronger in 2011, especially after the death of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. In October 2011, Karzai signed a strategic partnership agreement with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. During his speech at the &quot;RK Mishra Memorial&quot; in New Delhi, Karzai told the audience that &quot;The signing of the strategic partnership with India is not directed against any country. It is not directed against any other entity. This is for Afghanistan to benefit from the strength of India.&quot;

===Assassination attempts===
Many people have plotted to assassinate Karzai, especially the Taliban&#x27;s Quetta Shura and the Taliban-allied Haqqani network which allegedly receives support and guidance from Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy network. As recent as October 2011, while Karzai was visiting India to sign an important strategic partnership agreement with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Afghan agents of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) arrested 6 people in Kabul for planning to assassinate Karzai. Among those involved in the assassination plot were four Kabul University students and one of its professors, Dr. Aimal Habib, as well as Mohibullah Ahmadi who was one of the guards outside the Presidential Palace in Kabul. The alleged group of assassins were associates of al Qaida and the Haqqani network, and were paid $150,000 by Pakistani-based Islamic terrorists. A U.S. official said that &quot;Our understanding is that the threat against President Karzai was real, was credible, but it was only in the early stages of planning.&quot; The following is a list of other failed assassination attempts:
* 5 September 2002: An assassination attempt was made on Karzai in the city of Kandahar. A gunman wearing the uniform of the new Afghan National Army opened fire, wounding Gul Agha Sherzai (former governor of Kandahar) and an American Special Operations officer. The gunman, one of the President&#x27;s bodyguards, and a bystander who knocked down the gunman were killed when Karzai&#x27;s American bodyguards returned fire. Some pictures of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU) responding to the attempt have surfaced.
* 16 September 2004: An attempted assassination on Karzai took place when a rocket missed the helicopter he was flying in while en route to the city of Gardez in eastern Afghanistan.
* 10 June 2007: Taliban insurgents attempted to assassinate Karzai in Ghazni where he was giving a speech to elders. Insurgents fired approximately 12 rockets, some of which landed away from the crowd. Karzai was not hurt in the incident and was transported away from the location after finishing his speech.
* 27 April 2008: Insurgents, reportedly from the Haqqani network, used automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades to attack a military parade that Karzai was attending in Kabul. Karzai was safe, but at least three people were killed, including a parliamentarian, a ten-year-old girl and a minority leader, and ten injured. Others attending the event included government ministers, former warlords, diplomats and the military top brass, all of whom had gathered to mark the 16th anniversary of the fall of the Afghan communist government to the mujahideen. Responding to the attack during the ceremony, the UN said the attackers &quot;have shown their utter disrespect for the history and people of Afghanistan&quot;. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack, stating, &quot;We fired rockets at the scene of the celebration.&quot; He went on to say there were six Taliban at the scene and that three were killed. &quot;Our aim was not to directly hit someone&quot;, Mujahed said when asked if the intention was to kill Karzai. &quot;We just wanted to show to the world that we can attack anywhere we want to&quot;. The ability of the attackers to get so close to Karzai suggested they had inside help. Defense minister Wardak confirmed that a police captain was connected with the group behind the assassination attempt and that an army officer supplied the weapons and ammunition used in the attack. Warlord insurgent Gulbuddin Hekmatyar also reportedly claimed responsibility.

==Views on Taliban==
In a 2013 interview with Al Jazeera, Karzai called the Taliban his &#x27;brothers&#x27;. He claimed that the Afghan government and Afghan people did not want to eliminate the Taliban, but rather reintegrate the Taliban into society. It was not the first time he called the Taliban his brothers. Previously he called them brothers during his victory speech in 2009, a day after he was declared president.

===Attack on Taliban training camp===
On 14 September 2015, provincial police chief Gen. Daud Ahmadi claimed that Hamid Karzai had stopped an attack on a Taliban training camp in Logar province of Afghanistan. The camp was used as a launching pad and a military operation was being planned to deal with the camp. However, Karzai stopped them from attacking the camp. Ahmadi further claimed there were around 200 militants who were being trained at the camp at that time.

==Post-presidency==
After the 2017 Nangarhar airstrike, Karzai condemned his successor, President Ashraf Ghani, labeling him a traitor.

Following the fall of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to the Taliban on 17 August 2021, the leader of the Taliban-affiliated Hezb-e-Islami party Gulbuddin Hekmatyar met with Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation and former chief executive, in Doha, seeking to form an interim government with the Taliban.

In February 2022, Karzai condemned the Biden administration&#x27;s decision to unfreeze $7 billion of Da Afghanistan Bank&#x27;s assets and to divide the money between humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks. Karzai labelled the decision as an &quot;atrocity&quot; and, while saying that Afghans sympathized with the victims of 9/11, the money belonged to the Afghan people, who had also suffered from the attacks&#x27; consequences.

Karzai has been critical of the Taliban government&#x27;s failure to fulfill promises regarding women&#x27;s rights, and has asked the Taliban to reopen schools for girls. In an interview with CNN, he has also decried the demand for women to wear a burqa and cover their faces. In a statement issued from an unknown location on January 24, 2025, Karzai again urged for the immediate reopening of schools and universities for girls, saying “Afghanistan can only achieve independence from foreign dependency and reclaim its rightful place in the global community through education.” 

==Personal life and tribal lineage==

In 1999, Hamid Karzai married Zeenat Quraishi, a gynaecologist by profession who was working as a doctor with Afghan refugees living in Pakistan. They have a son, Mirwais, who was born in January 2007, a daughter, Malalai, born in 2012 and another daughter, Howsi, born in March 2014 in Gurgaon, India. He became a father once again at the age of 58 when another daughter was born in September 2016 in Apollo Hospital, New Delhi. According to a declaration of his assets by an anti-graft body, Karzai earns $525 monthly and has less than $20,000 in bank accounts. Karzai does not own any land or property.

Karzai has six brothers, including Mahmood Karzai and Qayum Karzai, as well as Ahmed Wali Karzai, deceased, who was the representative for the southern Afghanistan region. Qayum is also the founder of the &quot;Afghans for a Civil Society&quot;. Karzai has one sister, Fauzia Karzai. The family owns and operates several Afghan restaurants on the East Coast of the United States and in Chicago.

In initial biographical news reporting, there was confusion regarding his clan lineage; it was written that his paternal lineage derived from the Sadduzai clan. This confusion might have arisen from sources stating he was chosen as the tribal chief of the Popalzai. Traditionally, the Popalzai tribe has been led by members of the Sadozais. The first King of Afghanistan, Ahmad Shah Durrani, was the leader of the Sadozais, and the Sadozai lineage continued to rule Afghanistan until 1826 when the Barakzais ascended to the throne.

Karzai is believed to be from the Shamizai subtribe of the Popalzais. His grandfather, Khair Muhammad Karzai, was a head of the Popalzai tribe from Kandahar who relocated to Kabul and ran the business of a guest house. This allowed Karzai&#x27;s father Abdul Ahad, to gain a foothold in the royal family, and subsequently, the parliament. These actions and upwards movement within the Popalzai tribal system, led to the Karzai family furnishing a viable Shamizai clan alternative to Sadozai leadership in the aftermath of the Soviet invasion when the Sadozai clan failed to provide a tribal leader. He is often seen wearing a Karakul hat, something that has been worn by many Afghan kings in the past.

Following the Fall of Kabul in 2021, Karzai decided to remain in Kabul with his daughters and he appealed to the Taliban to respect his life and that of his family as well as the civilians in Afghanistan.

On 27 August 2021, prominent activist Fatima Gailani criticized him whereas the United States urged the Taliban to include him in the new government along with Abdullah Abdullah.

On 1 September 2021, sources close to the Taliban said that it was &quot;unlikely&quot; for Karzai to be part of the new government, with a spokesperson for the group saying that the group was &quot;ready to recruit them&quot;, referring also to Abdullah Abdullah but added that the Taliban did not want &quot;old horses&quot; in apparent reference to Karzai.

==Honorary degrees and awards==

Over the years Hamid Karzai has become a well recognized figure. He has received a number of awards and honorary degrees from famous government and educational institutions around the world. The following are some of his awards and honoraria.
* A commemorative medallion of 11 September 2001 attacks from the United States House of Representatives, presented to him by member of the House Jack Kingston on 29 January 2002.
* In June 2002, received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member James Earl Jones at the Achievement Summit at Dublin Castle in Dublin, Ireland.
* An honorary doctorate in literature from Himachal Pradesh University in India, his alma mater, on 7 March 2003.
* On 6 June 2003, Karzai was created an Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George by Queen Elizabeth II.
* On 4 July 2004, Karzai was awarded the Philadelphia Liberty Medal in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In his acceptance speech, Karzai stated: &quot;Where Liberty dies, evil grows. We Afghans have learned from our historical experiences that liberty does not come easily. We profoundly appreciate the value of liberty ... for we have paid for it with our lives. And we will defend liberty with our lives.&quot;
* On 22 May 2005, received an honorary Doctor of Laws Degree from Boston University.
* On 25 May 2005, received an honorary degree from the Center for Afghan Studies at the University of Nebraska — Omaha.
* On 25 September 2006, received an honorary Doctor of Laws Degree from Georgetown University.
* In June 2012, received an honorary Doctorate from Nippon Sport Science University.
* Lovely Professional University conferred an honorary Doctorate on Karzai on 20 May 2013.

==Controversies==
In August 2011, Karzai pardoned dozens of children, youngest of who was 8 years old, who were caught attempting suicide bombing. In February 2012, two boys of who were pardoned were rearrested in Kandahar Province along with three adult militant suspects, and that they told intelligence officers they had been recruited for suicide missions.

Karzai has been accused of nepotism, corruption, electoral fraud, and being involved with his late half brother Ahmed Wali Karzai in the drug trade.

In 2009, Karzai antagonized the women&#x27;s movement and NATO leaders by signing a draconian Shia Personal Status Law seen as legalizing marital rape within Afghanistan&#x27;s minority Shia Muslim community.

===Electoral fraud===
Under Karzai&#x27;s administration, electoral fraud was so apparent that Afghanistan&#x27;s status as a democratic state came into question. Furthermore, a special court set up personally by Karzai in defiance of constitutional norms sought to reinstate dozens of candidates who were removed for fraud in the 2010 parliamentary elections by the Independent Electoral Commission.

===Financial ties with CIA and the government of Iran===
On 28 April 2013, &quot;The New York Times&quot; revealed that from December 2002 up to the publication date, Karzai&#x27;s presidential office was funded with &quot;tens of millions of dollars&quot; of black cash from the CIA in order to buy influence within the Afghan government. The article stated that &quot;the cash that does not appear to be subject to the oversight and restrictions.&quot; An unnamed American official was quoted by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as stating that &quot;The biggest source of corruption in Afghanistan was the United States.&quot;

On 17 June 2013, Senator Bob Corker put a hold on $75 million intended for electoral programs in Afghanistan after his inquiries of 2 May, 14 May and 13 June to the Obama Administration regarding the CIA &quot;ghost money&quot; remained unanswered.

Karzai also admitted that his office received millions of dollars in cash from the Iranian government. Karzai stated that the money was given as gifts and intended for renovating his Presidential Palace in Kabul. &quot;This is transparent. This is something that I&#x27;ve even discussed while I was at Camp David with President Bush.&quot;

===Corruption===

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, many members of the Karzai family have mixed their personal interests with that of the state, and become hugely influential and wealthy by murky means. In 2012 Afghanistan was tied with Somalia and North Korea at the bottom of Transparency International&#x27;s Corruption Perception Index, and it ranked 172/175 in 2014.

Mahmoud Karzai, the brother of President Karzai, was implicated in the 2010 Kabul Bank crisis. Mahmud Karzai was the 3rd largest shareholder in the bank with a 7% stake. Kabul Bank incurred huge losses on its investments in villas in Palm Jumeirah in Dubai. The real estate investments were registered in the name of Kabul Bank chairman, Sherkhan Farnood. Mahmud Karzai bought one such villa from Farnood for 7 million dirhams using money borrowed from Kabul Bank and in a matter of months sold it for 10.4 million dirhams. Mahmud Karzai&#x27;s purchase of the 7% stake in Kabul Bank was also financed entirely through money lent by Kabul Bank with the shares as collateral.

Karzai has admitted that there is widespread corruption in Afghanistan, but has blamed the problem largely on the way contracts are awarded by the international community, and said that the &quot;perception of corruption&quot; is a deliberate attempt to weaken the Afghan government.

===Unocal connection===
There has been much debate over Karzai&#x27;s alleged consultant work with Unocal (Union Oil Company of California since acquired by Chevron in 2005). In 2002, when Karzai became the subject of heavy media coverage as one of the front runners to lead Afghanistan, it was reported that he was a former consultant for them. Spokesmen for both Unocal and Karzai have denied any such relationship, although Unocal could not speak for all companies involved in the consortium. The original claim that Karzai worked for Unocal originates from a 6 December 2001 issue of the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot;, Barry Lane UNOCAL&#x27;s manager for public relations states in an interview on the website Emperor&#x27;s Clothes that, &quot;He was never a consultant, never an employee. We&#x27;ve exhaustively searched through all our records.&quot; Lane however did say that Zalmay Khalilzad, the former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, was a Unocal consultant in the mid-1990s.

===Communication with Taliban===
In October 2013, Karzai&#x27;s administration and the Afghan Intelligence agency were found to be communicating with the Pakistani Taliban about the shifting of power that was expected to occur if the U.S. forces withdrew in 2014. Karzai himself was in London at the time of the discovery, to participate in talks with Pakistan and the U.S. on the possible location of Taliban leader Mullah Baradar. At the time, it was unknown if Karzai was directly involved or even knew of such communications.

In May 2021, Karzai spoke with German newspaper &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, where he expressed his sympathy with the Taliban, criticized the role of the United States in Afghanistan and praised the role of the European Union, at the same time, saying that the future of Afghanistan relies heavily on neighboring Pakistan. He also considered the Taliban &quot;victims of foreign forces&quot; and said that Afghans were being used to be &quot;each against the other&quot;. In November 2021, he told Yalda Hakim of &quot;BBC News&quot; that he considered the Taliban as &quot;brothers&quot;.

===View on ISIS in Afghanistan===
Karzai, during an interview with Voice of America in April 2017, claimed that ISIS in Afghanistan is a tool for the United States. He further claimed that he does not differentiate at all between ISIS and the United States. During an interview with Fox News a few weeks later, Karzai claimed that ISIS in Afghanistan is a product of the United States. He claimed that he routinely received reports regarding unmarked helicopters dropping supplies to support the terror faction. He asked for an explanation from the United States regarding the unmarked helicopter flights. He also claimed that the United States had made Afghanistan a testing ground for its weapons. In November 2017 during an interview with Al Jazeera, Karzai again criticized the United States. He accused the United States of working with ISIS in Afghanistan. Moreover, he said that the United States government had allowed ISIS to flourish in Afghanistan and that it had used ISIS as an excuse to drop the GBU-43 (Mother of all Bombs) in Afghanistan.

Karzai also accused Pakistan of supporting ISIS during an interview with ANI.

==In popular culture==
* In the film &quot;War Machine&quot;, Karzai was portrayed by Ben Kingsley.

<text>Empusa or Empousa (; ; &quot;plural&quot;: &quot;Empusai&quot;) is a shape-shifting female being in Greek mythology, said to possess a single leg of copper, commanded by Hecate, whose precise nature is obscure. In Late Antiquity, the empousae have been described as a category of phantoms or spectres, equated with the lamiai and mormolykeia, thought to seduce and feed on young men.

== In antiquity ==
The primary sources for the &quot;empousa&quot; in Antiquity are Aristophanes&#x27;s plays (&quot;The Frogs&quot; and &quot;Ecclesiazusae&quot;) and Philostratus&#x27;s &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot;.

===Aristophanes===
The Empusa was defined in the Sudas and by Crates of Mallus as a &quot;demonic phantom&quot; with shape-shifting abilities. Thus in Aristophanes&#x27;s plays she is said to change appearance from various beasts to a woman.

The Empusa is also said to be one-legged, having one brass leg, or a donkey&#x27;s leg, thus being known by the epithets Onokole (Ὀνοκώλη) and Onoskelis (Ὀνοσκελίς) which both mean &quot;donkey-footed&quot;.
A folk etymology construes the name to mean &quot;one-footed&quot; (from Greek *έμπούς, &quot;*empous&quot;: &quot;en-&quot;, one + &quot;pous&quot;, foot).

In Aristophanes&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Frogs&quot;, an Empusa appears before Dionysus and his slave Xanthias on their way to the underworld, although this may be the slave&#x27;s practical joke to frighten his master. Xanthias thus sees (or pretends to see) the empousa transform into a bull, a mule, a beautiful woman, and a dog. The slave also reassures that the being indeed had one brass (copper) leg, and another leg of cow dung besides.

The Empusa was a being sent by Hecate (as one scholiast noted), or was Hecate herself, according to a fragment of Aristophanes&#x27;s lost play &quot;Tagenistae&quot; (&quot;Men of the Frying-pan&quot;), as preserved in the Venetus.

===Life of Apollonius===

By the Late Antiquity in Greece, this became a category of beings, designated as &quot;empusai&quot; (Lat. &quot;empusae&quot;) in the plural. It came to be believed that the spectre preyed on young men for seduction and for food.

According to the 1st-century &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot;, the empousa is a phantom (&quot;phasma&quot;) that took on the appearance of an attractive woman and seduced a young philosophy student in order eventually to devour him. In a different passage of the same work, when Apollonius was journeying from Persia to India, he encountered an empousa, hurling insults at it, coaxing his fellow travellers to join him, whereby it ran and hid, uttering high-pitched screams.

An &quot;empousa&quot; was also known to others as &quot;lamia&quot; or &quot;mormolyke&quot;. This &quot;empousa&quot; confessed it was fattening up the student she targeted to feed on him, and that she especially craved young men for the freshness and purity of their blood, prompting an interpretation as blood-sucking vampire by Smith′s &quot;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology&quot; (1849).

== Modern Greek folklore ==

In modern times, folklore has been collected about a being fitting the description of an &quot;empousa&quot;: an extremely slender woman with multiple feet, &quot;one of bronze, one a donkey&#x27;s foot, one an ox&#x27;s, one a goat&#x27;s, and one human&quot;, but she was referred to as a woman with the lamia-like body and gait. The example was from Arachova (Parnassus) and published by (1871). Schmidt only speculated that oral lore of &quot;empousa&quot; might survive somewhere locally. A field study (Charles Stewart, 1985) finds that &quot;empousa&quot; is a term that is rarely used in oral tradition, compared to other terms such as &quot;gello&quot; which has a similar meaning.

==Modern interpretations==
According to Robert Graves, Empusa was a demigoddess, the beautiful daughter of the goddess Hecate and the spirit Mormo. She feasted on blood by seducing young men as they slept (see sleep paralysis), before drinking their blood and eating their flesh. When she spotted a man sleeping on the road, she attacked him, little knowing he was Zeus, king of the gods. Zeus woke and visited his wrath on her and Empusa was killed.

==In fiction==
Empusa is referenced in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;Tomlinson&quot;.

Empusa is a character in &quot;Faust, Part Two&quot; by Goethe. She appears during the Classical Walpurgis Night as Mephisto is being lured by the Lamiae. She refers to herself as cousin to Mephisto because she has a donkey&#x27;s foot and he has a horse&#x27;s.

&quot;Empusa&quot; is the name of the ship used by Count Orlok to travel to Wisborg in F. W. Murnau&#x27;s film &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922).

Empusa is a main antagonist turned heroine in the novel &quot;Grecian Rune&quot; by James Matthew Byers. They may look like humans at first.

In &quot;Primal&quot;, Empusa is among the Wraith-Aristocrates, a fast travelling race of demons, and the wife of the main-antagonist in the third world.

In &quot;Wicked Wings&quot; by Keri Arthur, the villains are three empusae who are eating the flesh of their prey. They use the form of a young woman to lure the men to their deaths.

===Popular entertainment===
In the &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians&quot; series, the Empousai first appear in &quot;The Battle of the Labyrinth&quot; as servants of Hecate who had, by that time, joined the Titan Army.

Empusa (along with Lamia and Mormo) is one of the three witches in the film &quot;Stardust&quot; (dir. Matthew Vaughn). She is played by Sarah Alexander. In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s novel &quot;Stardust&quot; the witches are not given individual names.

Empusa makes a minor appearance in &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; combined with Huyan Zhuo from &quot;Water Margin&quot;, resulting in a Chinese warrior woman with one or both of her human legs replaced with greenish donkey legs.

===Music===

The song &quot;Empusa, Queen of the Damned&quot; by the English deathcore band Infant Annihilator is inspired by the themes of the Greek myth.

<text>The Nemean lion (; ; ) was a monster in Greek mythology that lived at Nemea. Eventually, it was killed by Heracles (Hercules). Because its golden fur was impervious to attack, it could not be killed with mortals&#x27; weapons. Its claws were sharper than mortals&#x27; swords and could cut through any strong armour. In &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, Photius wrote that the dragon Ladon, who guarded the golden apples, was his brother.

==Parents==
Hesiod has the Nemean lion as the offspring of Orthus and an ambiguous &quot;she&quot;, often understood as probably referring to the Chimera, or possibly to Echidna or even Ceto. According to Hesiod, the lion was raised by Hera and sent to terrorise the hills of Nemea. According to Apollodorus, he was the offspring of Typhon. In another tradition, told by Aelian (citing Epimenides) and Hyginus, the lion was &quot;sprung from&quot; the moon-goddess Selene, who threw him from the Moon at Hera&#x27;s request.

==First labour of Heracles==

The first of Heracles&#x27; twelve labours, set by King Eurystheus (his cousin), was to slay the Nemean lion.

Heracles wandered the area until he came to the town of Cleonae. There, he met a boy who said that if Heracles slew the Nemean lion and returned alive within 30 days, the town would sacrifice a lion to Zeus; if he did not return within 30 days or he died, the boy would sacrifice himself to Zeus. Another version claims that he met Molorchos, a shepherd who had lost his son to the lion, saying that if he came back within 30 days, a ram would be sacrificed to Zeus. If he did not return within 30 days, it would be sacrificed to the dead Heracles as a mourning offering.

While searching for the lion, Heracles fetched some arrows to use against it, not knowing that its golden fur was impenetrable; when he found the lion and shot at it with his bow, he discovered the fur&#x27;s protective property when the arrow bounced harmlessly off the creature&#x27;s thigh. After some time, Heracles made the lion return to his cave. The cave had two entrances, one of which Heracles blocked; he then entered the other. In those dark and close quarters, Heracles stunned the beast with his club. He eventually killed it by strangling it with his bare hands.

After slaying the lion, he tried to skin it with a knife from his belt, but failed. He then tried sharpening the knife with a stone and even tried with the stone itself. Finally, Athena, noticing the hero&#x27;s plight, told Heracles to use one of the lion&#x27;s own claws to skin the pelt.

When Heracles returned on the thirtieth day carrying the carcass of the lion on his shoulders, King Eurystheus was amazed and terrified. Eurystheus forbade him ever again to enter the city; in the future, he was to display the fruits of his labours outside the city gates. Eurystheus warned him that the tasks set for him would become increasingly difficult. He then sent Heracles off to complete his next quest, which was to destroy the Lernaean Hydra.

Heracles wore the Nemean lion&#x27;s coat after killing it, as it was impervious to the elements and all but the most powerful weapons. Others say that Heracles&#x27; armour was, in fact, the hide of the Lion of Cithaeron.

According to Alexander of Myndus, Heracles was helped in this labour by an Earth-born serpent, which followed him to Thebes and settled down in Aulis. It was later identified as the water snake which devoured the sparrows and was turned into stone in the prophecy about the Trojan War.
