<text>Convergent evolution is the independent evolution of similar features in species of different periods or epochs in time. Convergent evolution creates analogous structures that have similar form or function but were not present in the last common ancestor of those groups. The cladistic term for the same phenomenon is homoplasy. The recurrent evolution of flight is a classic example, as flying insects, birds, pterosaurs, and bats have independently evolved the useful capacity of flight. Functionally similar features that have arisen through convergent evolution are &quot;analogous&quot;, whereas &quot;homologous&quot; structures or traits have a common origin but can have dissimilar functions. Bird, bat, and pterosaur wings are analogous structures, but their forelimbs are homologous, sharing an ancestral state despite serving different functions.

The opposite of convergence is divergent evolution, where related species evolve different traits. Convergent evolution is similar to parallel evolution, which occurs when two independent species evolve in the same direction and thus independently acquire similar characteristics; for instance, gliding frogs have evolved in parallel from multiple types of tree frog.

Many instances of convergent evolution are known in plants, including the repeated development of C4 photosynthesis, seed dispersal by fleshy fruits adapted to be eaten by animals, and carnivory.

==Overview==

In morphology, analogous traits arise when different species live in similar ways and/or a similar environment, and so face the same environmental factors. When occupying similar ecological niches (that is, a distinctive way of life) similar problems can lead to similar solutions. The British anatomist Richard Owen was the first to identify the fundamental difference between analogies and homologies.

In biochemistry, physical and chemical constraints on mechanisms have caused some active site arrangements such as the catalytic triad to evolve independently in separate enzyme superfamilies.

In his 1989 book &quot;Wonderful Life&quot;, Stephen Jay Gould argued that if one could &quot;rewind the tape of life [and] the same conditions were encountered again, evolution could take a very different course.&quot; Simon Conway Morris disputes this conclusion, arguing that convergence is a dominant force in evolution, and given that the same environmental and physical constraints are at work, life will inevitably evolve toward an &quot;optimum&quot; body plan, and at some point, evolution is bound to stumble upon intelligence, a trait presently identified with at least primates, corvids, and cetaceans.

== Distinctions ==

===Cladistics===

In cladistics, a homoplasy is a trait shared by two or more taxa for any reason other than that they share a common ancestry. Taxa which do share ancestry are part of the same clade; cladistics seeks to arrange them according to their degree of relatedness to describe their phylogeny. Homoplastic traits caused by convergence are therefore, from the point of view of cladistics, confounding factors which could lead to an incorrect analysis.

===Atavism===
In some cases, it is difficult to tell whether a trait has been lost and then re-evolved convergently, or whether a gene has simply been switched off and then re-enabled later. Such a re-emerged trait is called an atavism. From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene (selectively neutral) has a steadily decreasing probability of retaining potential functionality over time. The time scale of this process varies greatly in different phylogenies; in mammals and birds, there is a reasonable probability of remaining in the genome in a potentially functional state for around 6 million years.

===Parallel vs. convergent evolution===

When two species are similar in a particular character, evolution is defined as parallel if the ancestors were also similar, and convergent if they were not. Some scientists have argued that there is a continuum between parallel and convergent evolution, while others maintain that despite some overlap, there are still important distinctions between the two.

When the ancestral forms are unspecified or unknown, or the range of traits considered is not clearly specified, the distinction between parallel and convergent evolution becomes more subjective. For instance, the striking example of similar placental and marsupial forms is described by Richard Dawkins in &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; as a case of convergent evolution, because mammals on each continent had a long evolutionary history prior to the extinction of the dinosaurs under which to accumulate relevant differences.

==At molecular level==
===Proteins===

====Tertiary structures====

Many proteins share analogous structural elements that arose independently across different genomes. There are several examples of convergent protein motifs sharing similar arrangements of structural elements. Whole protein structures too have arisen through convergent evolution.

====Protease active sites====

The enzymology of proteases provides some of the clearest examples of convergent evolution. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to converge on equivalent solutions independently and repeatedly.

Serine and cysteine proteases use different amino acid functional groups (alcohol or thiol) as a nucleophile. To activate that nucleophile, they orient an acidic and a basic residue in a catalytic triad. The chemical and physical constraints on enzyme catalysis have caused identical triad arrangements to evolve independently more than 20 times in different enzyme superfamilies.

Threonine proteases use the amino acid threonine as their catalytic nucleophile. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary alcohol (i.e. has a methyl group). The methyl group of threonine greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate, as the methyl clashes with either the enzyme backbone or the histidine base. Consequently, most threonine proteases use an N-terminal threonine in order to avoid such steric clashes.
Several evolutionarily independent enzyme superfamilies with different protein folds use the N-terminal residue as a nucleophile. This commonality of active site but difference of protein fold indicates that the active site evolved convergently in those families.

====Cone snail and fish insulin====

&quot;Conus geographus&quot; produces a distinct form of insulin that is more similar to fish insulin protein sequences than to insulin from more closely related molluscs, suggesting convergent evolution, though with the possibility of horizontal gene transfer.

==== Ferrous iron uptake via protein transporters in land plants and chlorophytes ====

Distant homologues of the metal ion transporters ZIP in land plants and chlorophytes have converged in structure, likely to take up Fe2+ efficiently. The IRT1 proteins from &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; and rice have extremely different amino acid sequences from &quot;Chlamydomonas&quot;″s IRT1, but their three-dimensional structures are similar, suggesting convergent evolution.

====Na+,K+-ATPase and Insect resistance to cardiotonic steroids ====

Many examples of convergent evolution exist in insects in terms of developing resistance at a molecular level to toxins. One well-characterized example is the evolution of resistance to cardiotonic steroids (CTSs) via amino acid substitutions at well-defined positions of the α-subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase (ATPalpha). Variation in ATPalpha has been surveyed in various CTS-adapted species spanning six insect orders. Among 21 CTS-adapted species, 58 (76%) of 76 amino acid substitutions at sites implicated in CTS resistance occur in parallel in at least two lineages. 30 of these substitutions (40%) occur at just two sites in the protein (positions 111 and 122). CTS-adapted species have also recurrently evolved neo-functionalized duplications of ATPalpha, with convergent tissue-specific expression patterns.

===Nucleic acids===
Convergence occurs at the level of DNA and the amino acid sequences produced by translating structural genes into proteins. Studies have found convergence in amino acid sequences in echolocating bats and the dolphin; among marine mammals; between giant and red pandas; and between the thylacine and canids. Convergence has also been detected in a type of non-coding DNA, cis-regulatory elements, such as in their rates of evolution; this could indicate either positive selection or relaxed purifying selection.

==In animal morphology==
===Bodyplans ===
Swimming animals including fish such as herrings, marine mammals such as dolphins, and ichthyosaurs (of the Mesozoic) all converged on the same streamlined shape. A similar shape and swimming adaptations are even present in molluscs, such as &quot;Phylliroe&quot;. The fusiform bodyshape (a tube tapered at both ends) adopted by many aquatic animals is an adaptation to enable them to travel at high speed in a high drag environment. Similar body shapes are found in the earless seals and the eared seals: they still have four legs, but these are strongly modified for swimming.

The marsupial fauna of Australia and the placental mammals of the Old World have several strikingly similar forms, developed in two clades, isolated from each other. The body, and especially the skull shape, of the thylacine (Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf) converged with those of Canidae such as the red fox, &quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;.

=== Echolocation ===
As a sensory adaptation, echolocation has evolved separately in cetaceans (dolphins and whales) and bats, but from the same genetic mutations.

=== Electric fishes ===
The Gymnotiformes of South America and the Mormyridae of Africa independently evolved passive electroreception (around 119 and 110 million years ago, respectively). Around 20 million years after acquiring that ability, both groups evolved active electrogenesis, producing weak electric fields to help them detect prey.

===Eyes===

One of the best-known examples of convergent evolution is the camera eye of cephalopods (such as squid and octopus), vertebrates (including mammals) and cnidarians (such as jellyfish). Their last common ancestor had at most a simple photoreceptive spot, but a range of processes led to the progressive refinement of camera eyes—with one sharp difference: the cephalopod eye is &quot;wired&quot; in the opposite direction, with blood and nerve vessels entering from the back of the retina, rather than the front as in vertebrates. As a result, vertebrates have a blind spot.

=== Sex organs ===

Hydrostatic penises have convergently evolved at least six times in male amniotes. In these species, males copulate with females and internally fertilize their eggs. Similar intromittent organs have evolved in invertebrates such as octopuses and gastropods.

===Flight===

Birds and bats have homologous limbs because they are both ultimately derived from terrestrial tetrapods, but their flight mechanisms are only analogous, so their wings are examples of functional convergence. The two groups have independently evolved their own means of powered flight. Their wings differ substantially in construction. The bat wing is a membrane stretched across four extremely elongated fingers and the legs. The airfoil of the bird wing is made of feathers, strongly attached to the forearm (the ulna) and the highly fused bones of the wrist and hand (the carpometacarpus), with only tiny remnants of two fingers remaining, each anchoring a single feather. So, while the wings of bats and birds are functionally convergent, they are not anatomically convergent. Birds and bats also share a high concentration of cerebrosides in the skin of their wings. This improves skin flexibility, a trait useful for flying animals; other mammals have a far lower concentration. The extinct pterosaurs independently evolved wings from their fore- and hindlimbs, while insects have wings that evolved separately from different organs.

Flying squirrels and sugar gliders are much alike in their mammalian body plans, with gliding wings stretched between their limbs, but flying squirrels are placentals while sugar gliders are marsupials, widely separated within the mammal lineage from the placentals.

Hummingbird hawk-moths and hummingbirds have evolved similar flight and feeding patterns.

===Insect mouthparts===
Insect mouthparts show many examples of convergent evolution. The mouthparts of different insect groups consist of a set of homologous organs, specialised for the dietary intake of that insect group. Convergent evolution of many groups of insects led from original biting-chewing mouthparts to different, more specialised, derived function types. These include, for example, the proboscis of flower-visiting insects such as bees and flower beetles, or the biting-sucking mouthparts of blood-sucking insects such as fleas and mosquitos.

===Opposable thumbs===
Opposable thumbs allowing the grasping of objects are most often associated with primates, like humans and other apes, monkeys, and lemurs. Opposable thumbs also evolved in giant pandas, but these are completely different in structure, having six fingers including the thumb, which develops from a wrist bone entirely separately from other fingers.

===Primates===


Convergent evolution in humans includes blue eye colour and light skin colour. When humans migrated out of Africa, they moved to more northern latitudes with less intense sunlight. It was beneficial to them to reduce their skin pigmentation. It appears certain that there was some lightening of skin colour &quot;before&quot; European and East Asian lineages diverged, as there are some skin-lightening genetic differences that are common to both groups. However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the skin of both groups lightened more, and that additional lightening was due to &quot;different&quot; genetic changes.

Lemurs and humans are both primates. Ancestral primates had brown eyes, as most primates do today. The genetic basis of blue eyes in humans has been studied in detail and much is known about it. It is not the case that one gene locus is responsible, say with brown dominant to blue eye colour. However, a single locus is responsible for about 80% of the variation. In lemurs, the differences between blue and brown eyes are not completely known, but the same gene locus is not involved.

==In plants==
=== The annual life-cycle ===
While most plant species are perennial, about 6% follow an annual life cycle, living for only one growing season. The annual life cycle independently emerged in over 120 plant families of angiosperms. The prevalence of annual species increases under hot-dry summer conditions in the four species-rich families of annuals (Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, and Poaceae), indicating that the annual life cycle is adaptive.

===Carbon fixation===

C4 photosynthesis, one of the three major carbon-fixing biochemical processes, has arisen independently up to 40 times. About 7,600 plant species of angiosperms use carbon fixation, with many monocots including 46% of grasses such as maize and sugar cane, and dicots including several species in the Chenopodiaceae and the Amaranthaceae.

===Fruits===

Fruits with a wide variety of structural origins have converged to become edible. Apples are pomes with five carpels; their accessory tissues form the apple&#x27;s core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium. Other edible fruits include other plant tissues; the fleshy part of a tomato is the walls of the pericarp. This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, in this case the competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.

Seed dispersal by ants (myrmecochory) has evolved independently more than 100 times, and is present in more than 11,000 plant species. It is one of the most dramatic examples of convergent evolution in biology.

=== Carnivory ===
Carnivory has evolved multiple times independently in plants in widely separated groups. In three species studied, &quot;Cephalotus follicularis&quot;, &quot;Nepenthes alata&quot; and &quot;Sarracenia purpurea&quot;, there has been convergence at the molecular level. Carnivorous plants secrete enzymes into the digestive fluid they produce. By studying phosphatase, glycoside hydrolase, glucanase, RNAse and chitinase enzymes as well as a pathogenesis-related protein and a thaumatin-related protein, the authors found many convergent amino acid substitutions. These changes were not at the enzymes&#x27; catalytic sites, but rather on the exposed surfaces of the proteins, where they might interact with other components of the cell or the digestive fluid. The authors also found that homologous genes in the non-carnivorous plant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; tend to have their expression increased when the plant is stressed, leading the authors to suggest that stress-responsive proteins have often been co-opted in the repeated evolution of carnivory.

==Methods of inference==
Phylogenetic reconstruction and ancestral state reconstruction proceed by assuming that evolution has occurred without convergence. Convergent patterns may, however, appear at higher levels in a phylogenetic reconstruction, and are sometimes explicitly sought by investigators. The methods applied to infer convergent evolution depend on whether pattern-based or process-based convergence is expected. Pattern-based convergence is the broader term, for when two or more lineages independently evolve patterns of similar traits. Process-based convergence is when the convergence is due to similar forces of natural selection.

=== Pattern-based measures ===
Earlier methods for measuring convergence incorporate ratios of phenotypic and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny. More recent methods also quantify the strength of convergence. One drawback to keep in mind is that these methods can confuse long-term stasis with convergence due to phenotypic similarities. Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.

Distance-based measures assess the degree of similarity between lineages over time. Frequency-based measures assess the number of lineages that have evolved in a particular trait space.

=== Process-based measures ===

Methods to infer process-based convergence fit models of selection to a phylogeny and continuous trait data to determine whether the same selective forces have acted upon lineages. This uses the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process to test different scenarios of selection. Other methods rely on an &quot;a priori&quot; specification of where shifts in selection have occurred.

<text>In Greek mythology, Hecale ( &quot;Hekálē&quot;) was an old woman who offered succor to Theseus on his way to capture the Marathonian Bull.

== Mythology ==
On the way to Marathon to capture the Bull, Theseus sought shelter from a storm in a shack owned by an ancient lady named Hecale. She swore to make a sacrifice to Zeus if Theseus was successful in capturing the bull. Theseus did capture the bull but when he returned to Hecale&#x27;s hut, she was dead.

Theseus built a deme in her honor (Hecale was a deme of the tribe Leontis). The legend is described in a fragmentary poem, the &quot;Hecale&quot;, by Callimachus and in the &quot;Life of Theseus&quot; by Plutarch.

Translation of Plutarch&#x27;s text:&quot;Theseus, wishing to be actively employed, and at the same time to win the favour of the people, went out against the Marathonian bull, which was causing no small annoyance to the inhabitants of the Tetrapolis, and he overcame the bull and drove it through the city to exhibitit, after which he sacrificed it to Apollo Delphinius. Hecale and the legend of her reception and entertainment (of Theseus) seem to be not quite without some portion of truth. For the demes round about used to meet and hold a Hecalesian festival in honour of Zeus Hecalus, and honoured Hecale, whom they called by the pet name Hecaline, because when she entertained Theseus, who at the time was quite young, she addressed him as an old woman would and greeted him with that sort of pet names. When Theseus was setting out to the contest she vowed in his behalf to offer a sacrifice to Zeus if he came back safe. She died, however, before his return, and received the above mentioned honours, in return for her hospitality, by order of Theseus, as Philochorus relates.&quot;One of today&#x27;s Athens northern suburbs, Ekáli, an affluent and very exclusive residential community on the western foot of Mount Penteli, is called by that name.

== Hecalesia ==
Hecalesia (Εκαλήσια), a festival at Athens in honour of Zeus Hecalesius (Ἑκάλειος Ζεύς) and Hecale.

<text>In Greek mythology, Aethra or Aithra (, , ) was a name applied to four different individuals:
* Aethra, name of one of the Oceanids, the 3000 daughters of Oceanus and Tethys. She is sometimes called the wife of Atlas and mother of the Pleiades, Hyades (more usually the offspring of Pleione) and Hyas.
* Aethra (possibly same as above) is, in one source, called the wife of Hyperion, rather than Theia, and mother of Helios, Eos, and Selene.
* Aethra, daughter of King Pittheus of Troezen and mother of Theseus either by Poseidon or Aegeus. This is the same Aethra who went to Troy with Helen as one of her two handmaidens.
* Aethra, wife of the Spartan Phalanthus. She fulfilled the prophecy given to her husband by her tears, after which he conquered Tarentum for himself.

<text>In Greek mythology, Pittheus (; ) was the king of Troezen, city in Argolis, which he had named after his brother Troezen.

== Biography ==
Pittheus was a son of Pelops and Dia (maybe another name for Hippodamia), father of Aethra and Henioche, and grandfather and instructor of Theseus. 

He was described by Euripides as the most pious son of Pelops, a wise man, and well versed on understanding the oracle thus sought by Aegeus. Pittheus is said to have taught the art of speaking, and even to have written a book upon it. Plutarch spoke of Pittheus&#x27; account in the following verses: [Pittheus] had the highest repute as a man versed in the lore of his times and of the greatest wisdom. Now the wisdom of that day had some such form and force as that for which Hesiod was famous, especially in the sententious maxims of his &#x27;Works and Days&#x27; .One of these maxims is ascribed to Pittheus, namely: — &#x27;Payment pledged to a man who is dear must be ample and certain.&#x27; At any rate, this is what Aristotle the philosopher says, and Euripides, when he has Hippolytus addressed as &#x27;nursling of the pure and holy Pittheus,&#x27; shows what the world thought of Pittheus.

== Mythology ==

=== Early life ===
Pelops was the strongest of the kings in Peloponnesus quite as much on account of the number of his children as the amount of his wealth. He gave many daughters in marriage to men of the highest rank, and scattered many sons among the cities as their rulers. Coming from the district of Pisatis in Elis, Pittheus and his brother Troezen were received by Aetius, son of Anthas. This Anthas was a brother of Hyperenor and the two were sons of Poseidon and Pleiad Alcyone, both reigned in Hyperea and Anthea before Aetius. 

The Pelopids settled in the country and divided the power with Aetius. Thus, after these events the land was ruled by three kings instead of one: Aetius, Troezen and Pittheus but the newcomers enjoyed the real authority. This was evident after Troezen&#x27;s death for Pittheus who supplanted the earlier dynasty, ruled as the sole king. Having gathered settlers together and joining the two villages of Hyperea and Anthea into a modern city, Pittheus renamed it Troezen after his sibling. 

Bellerophon came to Troezen to ask Pittheus for Aethra&#x27;s hand in marriage, but the hero was banished from Corinth before the nuptials took place.

=== Childless Aegeus ===
King Aegeus of Athens reigned at the same time with Pittheus in Troezen. He was childless with his previous marriages and thus desired to have his own heirs. After he received from the Pythian priestess the celebrated oracle in which she bade him to have intercourse with no woman until he came to Athens. But Aegeus thought the words of the command somewhat obscure, and therefore turned aside to Troezen and asked for Pittheus&#x27; advice pertaining the words of the god, which ran as follows: — &quot;&#x27;Loose not the wine-skin&#x27;s jutting neck, great chief of the people, Until thou shalt have come once more to the city of Athens.&quot;&#x27;

Pittheus understanding the oracle on Aegeus&#x27; inquiry whether or not he was going to ever have children, had made the Athenian king drunk, who ended up spending the night with his daughter Aethra. Aethra had lain with Poseidon earlier that evening, so when Theseus was born he became Aegeus&#x27; stepson. According to Plutarch, Pittheus merely spread the report of her daughter&#x27;s copulation with the god so that Theseus might be regarded as the son of Poseidon, who was much revered at Troezen.

=== Two heroes ===
A Troezenian legend of the earliest notable event of Theseus&#x27; life is set in the house of Pittheus. After he had finished his labours, Heracles came to visit Pittheus. He laid his lion-skin down on a couch where it sat in a most lifelike fashion. A little while later Theseus, who was seven years old at this time, came into the room with some of his schoolmates. When the other children saw the skin of the Nemean lion, they ran from it in terror, thinking that it was alive. However, Theseus remained in the room, grabbed an axe from a nearby guard, and attacked the lion-skin.

When Heracles became slave of Omphale in Lydia, villains burst forth and broke in the regions of Hellas because no one would rebuke and restrain them. The journey was therefore a perilous one for travelers by land from Peloponnesus to Athens, and Pittheus, by describing each of the miscreants at length, what sort of a monster he was, and what deeds he wrought upon strangers, tried to persuade Theseus to make his journey by sea. But the hero, secretly inspired by the valor of his cousin Heracles, paid no heed of his grandfather&#x27;s warnings, traveled by the road and eventually cleared it from brigands and bandits that infested it.

=== Misfortune of Hippolytus ===
Pittheus also appeared in the myth about Hippolytos, son of Theseus and thus Pittheus&#x27;s great-grandson. When Theseus, now king of Athens, married Phaedra, he sent Hippolytos to the house of Pittheus, who became his pupil and raised him as heir to the Troezen throne. However, Hippolytos later got killed by Poseidon when his father was led to believe he violated Phaedra and caused her to commit suicide.

Pittheus&#x27; tomb and the chair on which he had sat in judgment were shown at Troezene down to a late time.

<text>In Greek mythology, Pelops (; ) was king of Pisa in the Peloponnesus region (, &quot;Pelops&#x27; Island&quot;). He was the son of Tantalus and the father of Atreus.

He was venerated at Olympia, where his cult developed into the founding myth of the Olympic Games, the most important expression of unity, not only for the people of Peloponnesus, but for all Hellenes. At the sanctuary at Olympia, chthonic night-time libations were offered each time to &quot;dark-faced&quot; Pelops in his sacrificial pit (&quot;bothros&quot;) before they were offered in the following daylight to the sky-god Zeus (Burkert 1983:96).

== Family ==
Pelops was a son of Tantalus and either Dione, Euryanassa, Eurythemista, or Clytia. In some accounts, he was called a bastard son of Tantalus while others named his parents as Atlas and the nymph Linos. Others would make Pelops the son of Hermes and Calyce while another says that he was an Achaean from Olenus.

Of Phrygian or Lydian birth, he departed his homeland for Greece, and won the crown of Pisa or Olympia from King Oenomaus in a chariot race, then married Oenomaus&#x27;s daughter, Hippodamia.

Pelops and Hippodamia had numerous children. Their sons include Pittheus (or his mother was Dia), Troezen, Alcathous, Dimoetes, Atreus, Thyestes, Copreus, Hippalcimus (Hippalcus, Hippalcmus), Sciron, Sicyon, Epidaurus, Cleones (Cleonymus), Letreus, Dyspontos, Pelops the younger, Argeius, Dias, Aelius, Corinthus, Cynosurus and Hippasus.

Four of their daughters married into the House of Perseus: Astydameia (who married Alcaeus), Nicippe (who married Sthenelus), Lysidice (who married Mestor), and Eurydice (who married Electryon). Another daughter of Pelops, Mytilene was called the mother of Myton by Poseidon.

By the nymph Axioche () or Danais Pelops was father of Chrysippus. The latter was also called the son of Hippodamia and brother of Pleisthenes who was sometimes called the son of Pelops by another woman.
== Mythology ==

=== Tantalus&#x27; savage banquet ===
Pelops&#x27; father was Tantalus, king at Mount Sipylus in Anatolia. Wanting to make an offering to the Olympians, Tantalus cut Pelops into pieces and made his flesh into a stew, then served it to the gods. Demeter, deep in grief after the abduction of her daughter Persephone by Hades, absentmindedly accepted the offering and ate the left shoulder. The other gods sensed the plot, however, and held off from eating of the boy&#x27;s body. While Tantalus was banished to Tartarus, Pelops was ritually reassembled and brought back to life, his shoulder replaced with one of ivory made for him by Hephaestus. Pindar mentioned this tradition in his First Olympian Ode, only to reject it as a malicious invention.

After Pelops&#x27; resurrection, Poseidon took him to Olympus, and made him the youth apprentice, teaching him also to drive the divine chariot. Later, Zeus found out about the gods&#x27; stolen food and their now revealed secrets, and threw Pelops out of Olympus, angry at his father, Tantalus.

=== Courting Hippodamia ===
Having grown to manhood, Pelops wanted to marry Hippodamia. Her father, King Oenomaus, fearful of a prophecy that claimed he would be killed by his son-in-law, had killed eighteen suitors of Hippodamia after defeating them in a chariot race and affixed their heads to the wooden columns of his palace. Pausanias was shown what was supposedly the last standing column in the late second century CE; he wrote that Pelops erected a monument in honor of all the suitors who had preceded him:
# Marmax
# Alcathous, son of Porthaon
# Euryalus
# Eurymachus
# Crotalus
# Acrias of Lacedaemon, founder of Acriae
# Capetus
# Lycurgus
# Lasius
# Chalcodon
# Tricolonus (descendant of another Tricolonus, who was a son of Lycaon)
# Aristomachus
# Prias
# Pelagon
# Aeolius
# Cronius
# Erythras, son of Leucon
# Eioneus, son of Magnes

Pelops came to ask for her hand and prepared to race Oenomaus. Worried about losing, Pelops went to the seaside and invoked Poseidon, his former lover. Reminding Poseidon of their love (&quot;Aphrodite&#x27;s sweet gifts&quot;), he asked Poseidon for help. Smiling, Poseidon caused a chariot drawn by untamed winged horses to appear.

Two episodes involving charioteers were added into the plain account of the heroic chariot race. In the first related by Theopompus, having received the horses, Pelops hastens to Pisa to defeat Oenomaus. On the way, his charioteer Cillus (also named Sphaerus) dies and stands in a dream over Pelops, who was highly distressed about him, to make requests for a funeral. Pelops complies by burying his ashes magnificently; he raises a mound to erect a temple dedicated to Apollo, which he names Apollo Cillaeus, and also founds a city besides the mound and the temple which he also names Cilla, after his charioteer and friend. Both the temple and the city are mentioned in the first book of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and suggestions regarding their exact location have been made. Furthermore, Cillus, even after his death, appears to have helped Pelops&#x27; cause in order for him to win the race.

The second, found in several versions, has Pelops, still unsure of himself, the winged horses and chariot of divine providence he had secured. Oenomaus&#x27; charioteer, Myrtilus, a son of Hermes, is persuaded to help Pelops win by promising Myrtilus half of Oenomaus&#x27; kingdom and the first night in bed with Hippodamia. The night before the race, while Myrtilus was putting together Oenomaus&#x27; chariot, he replaced the bronze linchpins attaching the wheels to the chariot axle with fake ones made of beeswax. The race started, and went on for a long time, but just as Oenomaus was catching up to Pelops and readying to kill him, the wheels flew off and the chariot broke apart. Myrtilus survived, but Oenomaus was dragged to death by his horses. Here lies the main differences in the versions, while all then see Pelops kill Myrtilus (by throwing him off a cliff into the sea) after the latter attempted to rape Hippodamia, some have Pelops give the promise to Myrtilus of Hippodamia&#x27;s virginity and then either renege the agreement or Myrtilus being impatient and trying to take her beforehand, others have Hippodamia, noticing Pelops&#x27; insecurity, giving the promise behind the back of Pelops, who then falsely believed it was an attempted rape.

=== Olympic Games ===
After his victory, Pelops organized chariot races as thanksgiving to the gods and as funeral games in honor of King Oenomaus, in order to be purified of his death. It was from this funeral race held at Olympia that the beginnings of the ancient Olympic Games were inspired. Pelops became a great king, a local hero, and gave his name to the Peloponnese. Walter Burkert notes that though the story of Hippodamia&#x27;s abduction figures in the Hesiodic &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot; and on the chest of Cypselus (c. 570 BCE) that was conserved at Olympia, and though preparations for the chariot-race figured in the east pediment of the great temple of Zeus at Olympia, the myth of the chariot race only became important at Olympia with the introduction of chariot racing in the twenty-fifth Olympiad (680 BCE). G. Devereux connected the abduction of Hippodamia with animal husbandry taboos of Elis, and the influence of Elis at Olympia that grew in the seventh century.

=== Curse of the Pelopidai ===
As Myrtilus died, he cursed Pelops for his ultimate betrayal. This was one of the sources of the curse that destroyed his family: two of his sons, Atreus and Thyestes, killed their half brother, Chrysippus, who was his favorite son and was meant to inherit the kingdom; Atreus and Thyestes were banished by him together with Hippodamia, their mother, who then hanged herself; each successive generation of descendants suffered greatly by atrocious crimes and compounded the curse by committing more crimes, as the curse weighed upon Pelops&#x27; children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren including Atreus, Thyestes, Agamemnon, Aegisthus, Menelaus, and finally Orestes, who was acquitted by a court of law convened by the gods Athena and Apollo. Although commonly referred to as &quot;the curse of the Atreides&quot;, the circle of atrocious events began two generations before Atreus and continued for two generations after him, before being formally absolved by the Furies in court. Many decades after Pelops&#x27;s death, his grandson Menelaus, having survived the long-lasting Trojan War and stranded in Egypt, would recount his numerous plights and wish Pelops had perished for good at Tantalus&#x27; dinner, so that Atreus, and therefore Agamemnon and Menelaus himself, would never have been born.

== Cult ==
=== Origin ===
Pelops is believed to have Anatolian origins. He may have been originally worshipped in Phrygia or Lydia or both. Other ancient mythographers connect him with Paphlagonia. He may have come from the Paphlagonian town of Enete. Thucydides says simply that Pelops was &quot;from Asia&quot;.

Others represent him as a native of Greece, who came from Olenos in Achaia, or perhaps from Arcadia.

Also, according to Strabo, Pelops&#x27; cult may have come to the Peloponnese originally from Phthiotis, and was first based in Laconia: &quot;... the Achaeans of Phthiotis came down with Pelops into the Peloponnesus, took up their abode in Laconia ...&quot;

=== Shrines ===
The shrine of Pelops at Olympia, the Pelopion, &quot;drenched in glorious blood&quot;, described by Pausanias stood apart from the temple of Zeus, next to Pelops&#x27; gravesite by the ford in the river. It was enclosed with a circle of stones. Pelops was propitiated as a chthonic deity, at night with the offering of a black ram. His remains were contained in a chest near the sanctuary of Artemis Kordax (Pausanias 6.22.1), though in earlier times a gigantic shoulder blade was shown; during the Trojan War, John Tzetzes said, Pelops&#x27; shoulder-blade was brought to Troy by the Greeks because the Trojan prophet Helenus claimed the Pelopids would be able to win by doing so. Pausanias was told the full story: the shoulder-blade of Pelops was brought to Troy from Pisa, the rival of Elis; on the return, the bone was lost in a shipwreck, but afterwards recovered by a fisherman, miraculously caught in his net.

Giant-sized bones were and are often found in Greece, the remains of gigantic prehistoric animals. In ancient times there was obviously no knowledge of dinosaurs or mammoths, and such findings were believed to be actual remains of legendary heroes or demigods, and to reflect the supposedly supernatural stature of humans of the long-bygone Heroic Age. The bones&#x27; provenance was then determined according to local legends about ancient burials, with political expedience also playing a major role, helped along by convenient dreams, visions or priestly auguries.

<text>Hippodamia (, ; also Hippodamea and Hippodameia; Ancient Greek: Ἱπποδάμεια &quot;she who masters horses&quot; derived from &quot;hippos&quot; &quot;horse&quot; and &quot;damazein&quot; &quot;to tame&quot;) was a Greek mythological figure. She was the queen of Pisa and the wife of Pelops, appearing with Pelops at a potential cult site in Ancient Olympia. 

Although Hippodamia does not speak within her mythologies, she is spoken about by both Onemous and Pelops. It is stated that Hippodamia is Onemous&#x27; only joy, and is a virtuous child. Onemous considered many men inferior to his daughter.

== Family ==
Hippodamia was the daughter of King Oenomaus of Pisa either by Sterope, daughter of Atlas and Pleione, Evarete, daughter of Acrisius and Eurydice, or Eurythoe, daughter of Danaus. She was probably the sister of Leucippus and Alcippe, wife of Evenus and mother of Marpessa.

Hippodamia married Pelops, son of King Tantalus of Lydia, and their children are as follows: Astydameia, Atreus, Corpreus, Dias, Eurydice, Hippalcimus, Hippasus, Lysidice, Mytilene, Nicippe, Pittheus, Thyestes, and Troezen.

== Mythology ==
Hippodamia&#x27;s father, King Oenomaus of Pisa, was fearful of a prophecy that claimed he would be killed by his son-in-law. So when suitors arrived, he told them they could marry his daughter only if they defeated him in a chariot race, and if they lost, they would be executed. Eighteen suitors of Hippodamia had perished in this way, and Oenamaus had affixed their heads to the wooden columns of his palace. Pausanias was shown what was purported to be the last standing column in the late second century CE; the same author mentions that Pelops erected a monument in honor of all the suitors before himself, and enlists their names, which are as follows:
# Marmax
# Alcathous, son of Porthaon
# Euryalus
# Eurymachus
# Crotalus
# Acrias of Lacedaemon, founder of Acriae
# Capetus
# Lycurgus
# Lasius
# Chalcodon
# Tricolonus
# Aristomachus
# Prias
# Pelagon
# Aeolius
# Cronius
# Erythras, son of Leucon
# Eioneus, son of Magnes
Pelops, son of King Tantalus of Lydia, came to ask for Hippodamia&#x27;s hand in marriage and prepared to race Oenomaus. Worried about losing, Pelops went to the seaside and invoked Poseidon, his former lover. Reminding Poseidon of their love (&quot;Aphrodite&#x27;s sweet gifts&quot;), he asked Poseidon for help. Smiling, Poseidon caused a chariot drawn by winged horses to appear.

In an episode that was added to the simple heroic chariot race, Pelops, still unsure of his fate, convinced Oenomaus&#x27;s charioteer, Myrtilus, a son of Hermes, to help him win. Myrtilus agreed to Pelops&#x27; wishes as Pelops promised him half of Oenomaus&#x27; kingdom and the first night in bed with Hippodamia. The night before the race, while Myrtilus was putting Oenomaus&#x27;s chariot together, he replaced the bronze linchpins attaching the wheels to the chariot axle with fake ones made of beeswax. The race began, and went on for a long time but just as Oenomaus was catching up to Pelops and readying to kill him, the wheels flew off and the chariot broke apart. Myrtilus survived, but Oenomaus was dragged to death by his horses.

When Myrtilus tried to claim his reward and lay with Hippodamia, Pelops killed Myrtilus by throwing him off a cliff into the sea. As Myrtilus died, he cursed Pelops and Hippodamia. Although this curse didn&#x27;t affect Pelops and Hippodamia&#x27;s prosperity, as they came to have fourteen children, the curse was enacted and haunted Hippodamia and Pelops&#x27; children Atreus and Thyestes as well as their descendants Agamemnon, Aegisthus, Menelaus and Orestes.

== Hippodamia within Ancient Olympia ==
The first cult site of Hippodamia and Pelops appeared in Olympia, called the Hippodameion. The true location of the Hippodameion remains unknown, yet the time period is thought to be during the Late Helladic period. It was thought that the Hippodameion was located near the sacred groves within Olympia, known as the Altis, yet some historians dispute this. The Hippodameion likely contained items similar to other cults that showed up around the time period, including statues of Pelops and Hippodamia along with terracotta pots depicting their stories.Walter Burkert notes that though the story of the contest for Hippodamia&#x27;s hand figures in the Hesiodic &quot;Megalai Ehoiai&quot; and on the chest of Cypselus (ca. 570 BCE) that was conserved at Olympia, and though preparations for the chariot-race figured in the east pediment of the great temple of Zeus at Olympia, the myth of the chariot race only became important at Olympia with the introduction of chariot racing in the twenty-fifth Olympiad (680 BCE). Georges Devereux connected the &quot;courtship&quot; of Hippodamia with animal husbandry taboos of Elis, and the influence of Elis at Olympia that grew in the seventh century.

<text>In Greek mythology, Myrtilus (Ancient Greek: Μυρτίλος) was a divine hero and son of Hermes. His mother is said variously to be the Amazon Myrto; Phaethusa, daughter of Danaus; or a nymph or mortal woman named Clytie, Clymene or Cleobule (Theobule). Myrtilus was the charioteer of King Oenomaus of Pisa in Elis, on the northwest coast of the Peloponnesus.

== Mythology ==
On the eve of the fateful horse race that would decide the marriage between Pelops and Hippodamia, Myrtilus was approached by Pelops (or in some accounts, by Hippodamia) who wanted him to hinder the efforts of his master, Oenomaus, to win the race. Myrtilus was offered as bribe the privilege of the first night with Hippodamia.

Myrtilus, who loved Hippodamia himself but was too afraid to ask her hand of her father, agreed and sabotaged the king&#x27;s chariot by replacing the bronze linchpins with fake ones made of bees&#x27; wax. In the ensuing accident Oenomaus lost his life, cursing Myrtilus as he died. Shortly thereafter Myrtilus tried to seduce Hippodamia, who ran crying to Pelops, although Myrtilus said this was the bargain. Enraged, Pelops murdered Myrtilus by casting him into the sea off the east coast of the Peloponnesus, which was later named the Myrtoan Sea in honor of the hero. His body was later recovered and brought in the temple of Hermes where it was honored with annual sacrifices. Some say that Myrtilus was transformed into the constellation of Auriga.

As Myrtilus died, he cursed Pelops. This curse would haunt future generations of Pelops&#x27; family, including Atreus, Thyestes, Agamemnon, Aegisthus, Menelaus, Orestes and Chrysippus. Also, the burial place of Myrtilus was a &quot;taraxippus&quot; in Olympia.

<text>In Greek mythology, King Oenomaus (also Oenamaus; , &quot;Oinómaos&quot;) of Pisa, was the father of Hippodamia and the son of Ares. His name &quot;Oinomaos&quot; denotes a wine man.

== Family ==
Oenomaeus&#x27; mother was either naiad Harpina (daughter of the river god Phliasian Asopus, the armed (&quot;harpe&quot;) spirit of a spring near Pisa) or Sterope, one of the Pleiades, whom some identify as his consort instead.

He married, if not Sterope, then Evarete of Argos, the daughter of Acrisius and Eurydice. Yet others give Eurythoe, daughter of Danaus, either as his mother or consort. His children besides Hippodamia were Leucippus (who perished because of his love for Daphne) and Alcippe (mother of Marpessa by Evenus). Pausanias, who is generally skeptical about stories of humans descending from gods, makes Oenomaus son of a mortal father, Alxion. John Tzetzes adduces a version which, in the same vein, calls Oenomaus son of a Hyperochus by Sterope. The genealogy offered in the earliest literary reference, Euripides&#x27; &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot;, would place him two generations before the Trojan War, making him the great-grandfather of the Atreides, Agamemnon and Menelaus. 
== Mythology ==

=== Courtship of Hippodamia ===

King Oenomaus, fearful of a prophecy that claimed he would be killed by his son-in-law, had killed eighteen suitors of his daughter Hippodamia after defeating them in a chariot race. He affixed their heads to the wooden columns of his palace. Pausanias was shown what was purportedly the last standing column in the late 2nd century AD; he mentions that Pelops erected a monument in honor of all the suitors who preceded him, and lists their names:
# Marmax
# Alcathous, son of Porthaon
# Euryalus
# Eurymachus
# Crotalus
# Acrias of Lacedaemon, founder of Acriae
# Capetus
# Lycurgus
# Lasius
# Chalcodon
# Tricolonus
# Aristomachus
# Prias
# Pelagon
# Aeolius
# Cronius
# Erythras, son of Leucon
# Eioneus, son of Magnes
=== Death ===
Pelops son of King Tantalus of Lydia, came to ask for her hand and prepared to race Oenomaus. Worried about losing, Pelops went to the seaside and invoked Poseidon, his former lover. Reminding Poseidon of their love (&quot;Aphrodite&#x27;s sweet gifts&quot;), he asked Poseidon for help. Smiling, Poseidon caused a chariot drawn by winged horses to appear. Pelops and Hippodamia, very much in love, devised a plan to replace the bronze linchpins attaching the wheels to the chariot axle with fake ones made of beeswax. The race began, and went on for a long time. But just as Oenomaus was catching up to Pelops and readying to kill him, the wheels flew off and the chariot broke apart. Oenomaus&#x27; charioteer, Myrtilus, survived, but Oenomaus was dragged to death by his horses.

Pelops then killed Myrtilus (by throwing him off a cliff into the sea as he cursed him) after the latter attempted to claim Hippodamia. As Myrtilus died, he cursed Pelops. This was the source of the curse that haunted descendants of Pelops&#x27;, including Atreus, Thyestes, Agamemnon, Aegisthus, Menelaus and Orestes. Also, the burial place of Myrtilus was a &quot;taraxippus&quot; in Olympia, a &quot;horse-frightening place&quot; during races.

In memory of Oenomaus, the Olympic Games were created (or alternatively the Olympic Games were in celebration of Pelops&#x27; victory). Oenomaus&#x27; chariot race was one legendary origin of the Olympic Games; one of its turning-posts was preserved, and round it grew an Elean legend of a burnt &quot;house of Oenomaus&quot;, reported by Pausanias in the 2nd century AD.

<doc id="82819" wikidata="Q5034402" url="?curid=82819" title="Cap'n Crunch">
<text>Cap&#x27;n Crunch is a corn and oat breakfast cereal manufactured since 1963 by Quaker Oats Company, a subsidiary of PepsiCo since 2001. Since the original product introduction, marketed simply as &quot;Cap&#x27;n Crunch&quot;, Quaker Oats has since introduced numerous flavors and seasonal variations, some for a limited time—and currently offers a Cap&#x27;n Crunch product line.

The original Cap&#x27;n Crunch cereal was developed to recall a recipe of brown sugar and butter over rice. It was one of the first cereals to use an oil coating to deliver its flavoring, which required an innovative baking process.

==Product history==

Pamela Low, a flavorist at Arthur D. Little, developed the original Cap&#x27;n Crunch flavor in 1963—recalling a recipe of a
mixture of brown sugar and butter her grandmother Luella Low served over rice at her home in Derry, New Hampshire.

Low created the flavor coating for Cap&#x27;n Crunch, describing it as giving the cereal a quality she called &quot;want-more-ishness&quot;. After her death in 2007, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called Low &quot;the mother of Cap&#x27;n Crunch&quot;. At Arthur D. Little, Low had also worked on the flavors for Heath, Mounds and Almond Joy candy bars.

In 1965, the Quaker Oats Company awarded the Fredus N. Peters Award to Robert Rountree Reinhart Sr. for his leadership in directing the development team of Cap&#x27;n Crunch. Reinhart developed a technique in the manufacture of Cap&#x27;n Crunch, using oil in its recipe as a flavor delivery mechanism—which initially made the cereal difficult to bake properly.

==Marketing==
Quaker Oats had a marketing plan for Cap&#x27;n Crunch, before it had developed the cereal. The product line is heralded by a cartoon mascot named Cap&#x27;n Crunch.

The character was created by Allan Burns, who became known for co-creating &quot;The Munsters&quot; and &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. The commercials themselves were originally produced by Jay Ward Productions.

Cap&#x27;n Crunch is depicted as a late 18th-century naval captain, an elderly gentleman with white eyebrows and a white moustache, who wears a Revolutionary-style naval uniform: a bicorne hat emblazoned with a &quot;C&quot; and a gold-epauletted blue coat with gold bars on the sleeves. While typically an American naval captain wears four bars on his sleeves, the mascot has been variously depicted over the years wearing only one bar (ensign), two bars (lieutenant), or three bars (commander). As of May 26, 2024, he is now depicted on cereal boxes with the four bars of a naval captain. Voice actor Daws Butler created Cap&#x27;n Crunch&#x27;s voice, basing it on that of Hollywood and radio character actor Charles Butterworth.

Animated television commercials featured the adventures of Cap&#x27;n Crunch commanding the &quot;good ship&quot; &quot;Guppy&quot; on its sea voyages accompanied by his canine first mate Seadog and loyal crew of sailor children named Alfie, Dave, Brunhilde, and Carlyle.
Jean LaFoote, &quot;The Barefoot Pirate&quot;, often attacked the &quot;Guppy&quot; in order to steal its cargo of Cap&#x27;n Crunch cereal.

According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; (2013), the character, Horatio Magellan Crunch, captains a ship called the &quot;Guppy&quot;, and was born on Crunch Island, a magical island in the Sea of Milk—with talking trees, crazy creatures and a mountain (Mt. Crunchmore) made out of Cap&#x27;n Crunch cereal.&quot; The article refers to the Captain&#x27;s bicorne as a &quot;Napoleon-style&quot; hat, and claims that this has led to speculation that he may be French.

Cap&#x27;n Crunch&#x27;s original animated television commercials used the slogan, &quot;It&#x27;s got corn for crunch, oats for punch, and it stays crunchy, even in milk.&quot;

In 2013, sources including &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;Washington Times&quot; noted that the three stripes on the mascot&#x27;s uniform indicate a rank of Commander rather than the four that denote the rank of Captain. In jest, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the U.S. Navy had no record of Crunch and that the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) was investigating him for impersonating a naval officer.

Daws Butler provided the original voice of the Cap&#x27;n until his death in 1988. From 1991 to 2007, George J. Adams voiced him, followed by John Gegenhuber in &quot;The Cap&#x27;n Crunch Show&quot; in 2013, and Mike Stoudt from 2021 to 2023. 

In the 1960s Cap&#x27;n Crunch cereal boxes came with whistles which coincidentally had the specific frequency (2600 hertz) required to exploit a vulnerability of in-band signaling enabling a phone to make free calls by entering an &#x27;operator mode&#x27;. This was discovered by John Draper.

Author Philip Wylie wrote a series of short stories, &quot;Crunch and Des&quot;, beginning in the 1940s, which featured a similarly named but otherwise unrelated character, Captain Crunch Adams. Vinton Studios produced a claymation ad during the 1980s.

===Brand characters===

&quot;Jean LaFoote&quot; is a fictional pirate character from the Cap&#x27;n Crunch breakfast cereal&#x27;s character set. The character&#x27;s name is wordplay on that of the historical pirate, Jean Lafitte. In the mid-1970s, he was the primary mascot for Jean LaFoote&#x27;s Cinnamon Crunch cereal. LaFoote was originally voiced by Bill Scott, followed by Adam Shapiro from 2006 to 2007, and Joe Nipote in &quot;The Cap&#x27;n Crunch Show&quot; in 2013.

In the 1980s, the Captain&#x27;s main adversaries were the &quot;Soggies&quot;, strange alien creatures resembling blobs of milk, whose goal was to make everything on Earth soggy. The only thing that was immune was Cap&#x27;n Crunch cereal, and many ads revolved around their attempts to &quot;soggify&quot; the cereal and everything else, to no avail. Their leader, Squish the Sogmaster (voiced by Dick Gautier), was a large mechanical creature (with a pair of eyes peeking out from an opening in the head, implying it was a suit of armor for a smaller figure) who was mostly seen ordering the Soggies to carry out his plans to &quot;ruin breakfast&quot;; several commercials that tied in with contests had story arcs involving the Sogmaster attempting to capture Cap&#x27;n Crunch.

==Variations==

* Cap&#x27;n Crunch: The original Cap&#x27;n Crunch cereal is made of sweetened, yellow, square-shaped cereal pieces made by combining corn and oats. The cereal was launched in 1963, bolstered by a successful advertising campaign created by noted animator Jay Ward and introducing the cereal&#x27;s longtime naval mascot, Cap&#x27;n Crunch.
* Cap&#x27;n Crunch&#x27;s Crunch Berries: Cap&#x27;n Crunch&#x27;s Crunch Berries cereal was introduced in 1967 and contained, in addition to the yellow pieces found in the original Cap&#x27;n Crunch, spherical red Crunch Berry pieces. There was a version of Crunch Berries available briefly in which the berries, instead of being spherical, were three small berries in a cluster. The Crunch Berry Beast mascot was introduced alongside the cereal. There are currently four Crunch Berry colors: red, green (introduced in 2002), blue, and purple (both introduced in the &#x27;90s). All the berry pieces are flavored the same, regardless of color.
* Peanut Butter Crunch: First released in 1969, with a large elephant named Smedley as its mascot; according to sales charts, this version was the most successful at the time. It consists of peanut butter-flavored corn puffs.
* Punch Crunch, Vanilly Crunch, Jean LaFoote&#x27;s Cinnamon Crunch: Three more editions issued in the early 1970s but later discontinued. Punch Crunch was fruit-flavored cereal rings (similar to the General Mills cereal Cheerios) introduced in 1973 and the mascot was a sailor suit-clad hippopotamus named Harry S. Hippo. Jean LaFoote&#x27;s Cinnamon Crunch featured cinnamon-flavored cereal and was also introduced in 1973 (a reboot of this cereal, consisting of a cinnamon-flavored version of the original Cap&#x27;n Crunch pieces, released in 2024). Vanilly Crunch was a vanilla-flavored cereal introduced in 1970 with Seadog as its former mascot, who was later replaced with Wilma the White Whale. 
* Choco Crunch: In 1982, a variant called Choco Crunch, featuring the mascot Chockle the Blob, was introduced. This version contained the yellow corn squares, plus chocolate-flavored Crunch Berries. 
* Chocolatey Crunch: Introduced in 2011 and consisting of chocolate-flavored corn squares, Chocolately Crunch was discontinued in July 2016 due to poor sales.
* Christmas Crunch (Holiday Crunch in Canada): A special edition first released for the 1987 Christmas holiday season. It contains the signature Cap&#x27;n Crunch yellow corn squares with red and green Crunch Berries. Currently, the Crunch Berries are shaped as Christmas-themed items (shapes vary yearly) and the cereal is packaged in a holiday-themed box with the Cap&#x27;n wearing a Santa Claus or winter-themed hat (box color and hat type vary yearly). When the cereal was first introduced, the Crunch Berries were spherical-shaped and the cereal contained a toy or Christmas tree ornament inside the box. On a few occasions, the cereal has been packaged with a packed-in food gimmick to add to the cereal, like Jingle Bell Rock pieces that changed the milk&#x27;s color to red (used in the 1998 version) or sprinkled icing (used in the 1995 version).
* Deep Sea Crunch: A version of the cereal introduced in 1993, which featured Crunch Berries shaped like sea creatures. This version was discontinued, but returned in 2009.
* Oops! All Berries: First released in 1997, &quot;Oops! All Berries&quot; contains nothing but the berry-flavored Crunch Berries and none of the corn squares. 
* Halloween Crunch: A limited edition version of the cereal introduced in 2007. This includes green Crunch Berries in the form of ghosts.
* Galactic Crunch: A discontinued version which featured space-related shaped marshmallows.
* Oops! Choco Donuts: A discontinued version which featured chocolate-flavored doughnut-shaped cereal rings with candy sprinkles.
* Home Run Crunch: A limited edition version of the cereal first released in 1995, which featured baseball-related shaped marshmallows, like home plates, caps and mitts. It has the flavor of Crunch Berries, but the pieces of cereal are shaped like bats and balls. It is occasionally reintroduced during the summer season, with the recent versions consisting of the original pieces with the bat and ball-shaped Crunch Berries.
* Neutron Berries Featured spherical Crunch Berry pieces shaped like Jimmy Neutron, Goddard, Cindy and the Rocket. Released in 2001 to coincide with the film &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;.

<text>Pirithous (; or , derived from ; also transliterated as Perithous), in Greek mythology, was the King of the Lapiths of Larissa in Thessaly, as well as best friend to Theseus.

== Biography ==
Pirithous was a son of &quot;heavenly&quot; Dia, fathered either by Ixion or by Zeus. He married Hippodamia, daughter of Atrax or Butes, at whose wedding the famous Battle of Lapiths and Centaurs occurred. By his wife, he became the father of Polypoetes, one of the Greek leaders during the Trojan War. Pirithous was also the close friend of the hero Theseus.

=== Early years ===
According to Homer, Dia had sex with Zeus, who was disguised as a stallion, and gave birth to Pirithous; a folk etymology derived Pirithous&#x27; name from &quot;peritheein&quot; (), because that was what Zeus did to seduce Dia.

His best friend was Theseus. In the &quot;Iliad&quot; I, Nestor numbers Pirithous and Theseus &quot;of heroic fame&quot; among an earlier generation of heroes of his youth, &quot;the strongest men that Earth has bred, the strongest men against the strongest enemies, a savage mountain-dwelling tribe whom they utterly destroyed.&quot; No trace of such an oral tradition, which Homer&#x27;s listeners would have recognized in Nestor&#x27;s allusion, survived in literary epic.

In disjointed episodes that have survived, Pirithous had heard rumors about Theseus&#x27; courage and strength in battle but he wanted proof. He rustled Theseus&#x27; herd of cattle from Marathon, and Theseus set out to pursue him. Pirithous took up arms and the pair met, then became so impressed with each other&#x27;s gracefulness, beauty and courage they took an oath of friendship. They were among the company of heroes that hunted the Calydonian Boar, another mythic theme that was already well known to Homer&#x27;s listeners.

== Centauromachy ==
Later, Pirithous was set to marry Hippodamia, their offspring being Polypoetes. The centaurs were guests at the party, but they got drunk and tried to abduct the women, including Hippodamia who was carried off by the intoxicated centaur Eurytion or Eurytus. The Lapiths won the ensuing battle, the Centauromachy, a favorite motif of Greek art.

== Punishment in the Underworld ==
Hippodamia died shortly after Polypoetes&#x27; birth, after which Pirithous went to visit Theseus at Athens only to discover that Theseus&#x27; own wife, Phaedra, who, according to Ovid, felt left out by her husband&#x27;s love for Pirithous, was dead. Thus, Pirithous and Theseus pledged to marry daughters of Zeus; Theseus chose Helen of Sparta and together they kidnapped her when she was 10 years of age and decided to hold on to her until she was old enough to marry. Pirithous chose a more dangerous prize: Persephone herself. Theseus objected, and tried to talk him out of it, as this act would be too blasphemous; but Pirithous insisted, and Theseus was bound by his oaths, so he agreed. They left Helen with Theseus&#x27; mother, Aethra, at Aphidnae, and traveled to the underworld. When they stopped to rest, they found themselves unable to stand up from the rock as they saw the Furies appear before them.

=== Rescue ===
Heracles freed Theseus from the stone, but the earth shook when he attempted to free Pirithous. He had committed too great a crime for wanting the wife of one of the great gods as his own bride. According to a scholium on Aristophanes, in a lost play by Euripides, Hades had Pirithous fed to Cerberus for his impiety. By the time Theseus returned to Athens, the Dioscuri (Helen&#x27;s twin brothers Castor and Pollux) had taken Helen back to Sparta; they had taken captive Aethra as well as Pirithous&#x27; sister, Physadeia, and they became handmaidens of Helen and later followed her to Troy.

The rescue of Theseus and Pirithous acquired a humorous tone in the realm of Attic comedy, in which Heracles attempted to free them from the rock to which they had been bound together in the Underworld (for having tried to carry off Persephone). He succeeded in freeing only Theseus and left behind his buttocks attached to the rocks. Due to this Theseus came to be called hypolispos, meaning &quot;with hinder parts rubbed smooth.&quot; This may have been a later invention.

Pirithous was worshiped at Athens, along with Theseus, as a hero.

<text>Hywel ap Cadell, commonly known as Hywel Dda, which translates to Howel the Good in English, was a Welsh king who ruled the southern Welsh kingdom of Deheubarth and eventually came to rule most of Wales. He became the sole king of Seisyllwg in 920 and shortly thereafter established Deheubarth, and proceeded to gain control over the entire country from Prestatyn to Pembroke. As a grandson of Rhodri Mawr through his father Cadell, Hywel was a member of the Dinefwr branch of the dynasty. He was recorded as King of the Britons in the &quot;Annales Cambriæ&quot; and the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;.

Hywel is highly esteemed among other medieval Welsh rulers. His name is particularly linked with the codification of traditional Welsh law, which were thenceforth known as the Laws of Hywel Dda. The latter part of his name (&quot;Dda&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;) refers to the fact that his laws were just and good. The historian Dafydd Jenkins sees in them compassion rather than punishment, plenty of common sense and recognition of the rights of women. Hywel Dda was a well-educated man even by modern standards, having a good knowledge of Welsh, Latin and English.

The office building and original home of the Senedd is named Tŷ Hywel (&quot;Hywel House&quot; or &quot;Hywel&#x27;s House&quot;) in honour of Hywel Dda. The original assembly chamber, now known as Siambr Hywel (&quot;Hywel&#x27;s Chamber&quot;), is used for educational courses and for children and young people&#x27;s debates. The local health board of south-west Wales, covering an area roughly corresponding to the kingdoms of Dyfed and Seisyllwg of which Hywel was King, also bears his name.

== Early life ==
Hywel was the son of King Cadell ap Rhodri of Seisyllwg. He had a brother, Clydog ap Cadell, who was probably the younger of the two. Hywel was later reputed to have married Elen ferch Llywarch (893-943), the supposed heiress of King Llywarch ap Hyfaidd of Dyfed, which connection was subsequently used to justify his family&#x27;s reign over that kingdom.

Hywel&#x27;s father Cadell had been installed as King of Seisyllwg by his father, Rhodri Mawr (Rhodri the Great) of Gwynedd, following the drowning of the last king in the traditional line, Gwgon, in 872. After Gwgon&#x27;s death, Rhodri, husband to the dead king&#x27;s sister Angharad, became steward of his kingdom. This gave Rhodri no standing to claim the kingship of Seisyllwg himself, but he was able to install his son Cadell as a subject king. Cadell died around 911, and his lands in Seisyllwg appear to have been divided between his two sons Hywel and Clydog.

== Reign ==
Hywel probably already controlled Dyfed by the time he assumed his father&#x27;s lands in Ceredigion. No king is recorded after the death of Llywarch in 904, and Hywel&#x27;s marriage to Llywarch&#x27;s only surviving heir probably ensured that the kingdom came into his hands. Hywel and Clydog seem to have ruled Seisyllwg together following their father&#x27;s death and jointly submitted to Edward the Elder of England in 918. However, Clydog died in 920, evidently leaving the whole realm to Hywel. Hywel soon joined Seisyllwg and Dyfed into a single realm known as Deheubarth. This became the first significant event of his reign.

During the year 928 Hywel made a pilgrimage to Rome, becoming the first Welsh prince to undertake such a trip and return, Hywel&#x27;s wife Elen (death maybe 948 or 951), the daughter of Llywarch (d. 903), and granddaughter of King Hyfaidd of the Kingdom of Dyfed, died the same year. Upon his return he forged very close relations with Æthelstan of England. From the outset Æthelstan&#x27;s intention was to secure the submission of all other kings in Britain; unusually, Hywel embraced submission to England and used it to his advantage whenever possible. In 934, Hywel supported Æthelstan&#x27;s invasion of Scotland. Later in his reign, he was able to leverage his close association with Æthelstan and the English crown to great effect in his ambitions within Wales.

In 942 Hywel&#x27;s cousin Idwal Foel, King of Gwynedd, determined to cast off English overlordship and took up arms against the new English king, Edmund. Idwal and his brother Elisedd were both killed in battle in 942 against Edmund&#x27;s forces. By normal custom Idwal&#x27;s crown should have passed to his sons, but Hywel intervened. He sent Iago and Ieuaf into exile and established himself as ruler over Gwynedd, which also probably placed him in control of the Kingdom of Powys, which was under the authority of Gwynedd. As such Hywel became king of nearly all of Wales except for Morgannwg and Gwent in the south.

A single coin in Hywel&#x27;s name is known. It was produced by the Chester moneyer Gillys in about 946. As there is only one, it is unlikely that it is the sole survivor of a Welsh coinage and it was probably produced as a gesture by the English to the Welsh king.

== Legacy ==


Following Hywel&#x27;s death in 949 or 950, his kingdom was soon split into three. Gwynedd was reclaimed by the sons of Idwal Foel, Iago and Ieuaf, while Deheubarth was divided between Hywel&#x27;s sons.

Hywel&#x27;s name is associated with the laws of medieval Wales, which are commonly known as the Laws of Hywel Dda (Welsh: Cyfraith Hywel). None of the law manuscripts can be dated to Hywel&#x27;s time, but Hywel&#x27;s name is mentioned in the prologues to the laws, and are also known as the &quot;Code of Dyfed&quot;. These describe how Hywel gathered expert lawyers and priests from each commote in Wales together in the &quot;White Land&quot; in Dyfed () in order to revise and codify the Laws of Wales. The story in the prologues lengthens with time, with more details in the later versions of the prologue. It seems highly unlikely that this meeting actually took place, with the purpose of the prologues being to emphasise the royal and Christian origin and background to the laws, and that in the face of criticism of the laws from outside Wales especially during John Peckham&#x27;s period as Archbishop of Canterbury. Nevertheless, his name continued to be associated with Welsh law which remained in active use throughout Wales until the appointed date of implementation of the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 of King Henry VIII of England who asserted his royal descent by blood-line from Rhodri Mawr via Hywel Dda.

Opinions vary as to the motives for Hywel&#x27;s close association with the court of Æthelstan. J. E. Lloyd claimed Hywel was an admirer of Wessex, while David Peter Kirby suggests that it may have been the action of a pragmatist who recognised the realities of power in mid-10th century Britain.

A Welsh-language poem entitled &quot;Armes Prydein&quot;, considered by Sir Ifor Williams to have been written in Deheubarth during Hywel&#x27;s reign, called for the Welsh to join a confederation of all the non-English peoples of Britain and Ireland to fight the Saxons. The poem may be linked to the alliance of Norse and Celtic kingdoms which challenged Æthelstan at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937. No Welsh forces joined this alliance, and this may well have been because of the influence of Hywel. On the other hand, neither did he send troops to support Æthelstan.

== Children ==
Hywel and Elen had the following children:
* Owain;
* Rhodri;
* Edwin;
* Angharad.

<doc id="82827" wikidata="Q1851846" url="?curid=82827" title="Medus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Medus () or Medeus/Medeius ( or ) was an Athenian prince as the son of King Aegeus, thus a half-brother of the hero Theseus.

== Family ==
Medus&#x27;s mother was the Colchian witch Medea, daughter of King Aeëtes. In some accounts, he was called Polyxenus and his father was Jason, thus a brother of Eriopis.

== Mythology ==

=== Childhood ===
In the account for being the son of Jason, Medeus was raised by the centaur Chiron in the mountains.

=== Flight from Athens ===
As the son of Aegeus, Medus and his mother were driven as fugitives from Athens after Medea plotted against Theseus. Following his mother, Medus was brought by a storm to the court of King Perses of Colchis and Medus was seized by the guards and presented to the current ruler. This Perses was the son of Helios and the brother of the former king Aeëtes. He ruled after the death of his brother but by some accounts, Aeëtes was murdered or deposed by Perses. When Medus saw that he had come into the power of his enemy, he falsely asserted he was Hippotes, son of King Creon of Corinth. Perses carefully investigated and ordered him to be cast into prison to protect his throne from any potential claimants because he feared the prophecy that he should be aware of Aeëtes&#x27; descendants (i.e. Medus). Afterwards, sterility and scarcity of crops are said to have occurred.

=== Witch&#x27;s scheme ===
When Medea came back to her native land in her chariot with the yoked dragons, she falsely impersonated a priestess of Artemis before the king. She said she could make atonement for the plague to appease the gods and she heard from the king that a supposed Hippotes was held in custody. Thinking that the alleged Corinthian prince had come to avenge the injury to his father (i.e. Creon), Medea unknowingly conspired and betrayed her son Medus. For she persuaded the king that he was not Hippotes, but Medus, sent by his father to dispatch the king, and begged that he be handed over to her to be killed as a sacrifice, convinced that he was Hippotes. So when Medus was brought out to pay for his deceit by death, Medea saw that things were otherwise than she had thought, she said she wished to talk with him which Perses agreed. Subsequently, Medea gave Medus a sword and bade him avenge the wrongs to his grandfather Aeëtes, and Medus killed Perses, and gained his grandfather&#x27;s kingdom. In some accounts, the king was stabbed to death by Medea herself using the sacrificial blade. Another version of the myth states that Medea restored her father Aeëtes to the throne of Colchis after being deposed by Perses.

=== Aftermath ===
When Medus came to rule, he secured the command of an army and advanced over a large part of Asia which lies above the Pontus. Conquering the barbarians that live in that neighboring land, he named Media in honor of either himself or his mother. Medeus was also credited to be the founder of Meda in Ecbatana. Medus met his death while marching against the Indians.

<text>The Minyades () were three Orchomenian (Arcadian) princesses in Greek mythology. These sisters were protagonists of a myth about the perils of neglecting the worship of Dionysus. 

== Names and family ==
The names of the Minyades were Alcathoe (or Alcithoe), Leucippe and Arsippe (although instead of &quot;Arsippe&quot;, Claudius Aelianus calls the latter &quot;Aristippa&quot;, and Plutarch &quot;Arsinoë&quot;; Ovid uses &quot;Leuconoe&quot; instead of &quot;Leucippe&quot;). They were daughters of Minyas, king of Orchomenus, Boeotia.
==Mythology==

At the time when the worship of Dionysus was introduced into Boeotia, and while the other women and maidens were reveling and ranging over the mountains in Bacchic joy, these sisters alone remained at home, devoting themselves to their usual occupations, and thus profaning the days sacred to the god. Dionysus punished them by changing them into bats, and their work into vines. Plutarch, Aelian, and Antoninus Liberalis, though with some differences in the detail, relate that Dionysus appeared to the sisters in the form of a maiden, and invited them to partake in the Dionysian Mysteries. When the sisters declined the invitation, the god metamorphosed himself successively into a bull, a lion, and a panther, and the sisters were driven mad.

In this state of madness, they were eager to honor the god, and Leucippe, who was chosen by lot to offer a sacrifice to Dionysus, gave up her own son Hippasus, whom the sisters tore to pieces. The sisters afterwards roamed over the mountains in a frenzy, until at last Hermes changed them into bats. Plutarch adds that down to his time the men of Orchomenus descended from that family were called &quot;psoloeis&quot; (), that is, mourners, and the women &quot;oleiai&quot; or &quot;aioleiai&quot; ( or ), that is, the destroyers.

=== Antoninus&#x27; account ===
Another retelling of the wrathful punishment of the Minyades by the god Dionysus appeared in Antoninus Liberalis&#x27; &quot;Metamorphoses:&quot;The daughters of Minyas, son of Orchomenus, were Leucippe, Arsippe and Alcathoe. They turned out to be startlingly diligent. They strongly criticized other women because they abandoned the city to go as Bacchantes in the hills until Dionysus took on the likeness of a girl and urged the Minyades not to miss out on the rites or mysteries of the god. But they paid no heed to him. At this—not surprisingly—Dionysus was angered and instead of a girl became a bull, then a lion, then a leopard. From the beams of their looms there flowed for him milk and nectar.At these portents, terror gripped the maidens. Without delay, the three threw lots into a pot and shook it. The lot fell to Leucippe and she vowed to offer as a sacrifice to the god her own son Hippasus whom she tore to pieces with the help of her sisters. Abandoning their paternal home, they went as Bacchantes in the mountains, browsing on ivy, honeysuckle, and laurel, until Hermes touched them with his wand and changed them into flying creatures. One of them became a bat, another an owl and the third an eagle owl. And all three continuously avoided the light of the sun.

<text>In Greek mythology, Minyas (; Ancient Greek: Μινύας) was the founder of Orchomenus, Boeotia.

== Family ==
As the ancestor of the Minyans, a number of Boeotian genealogies lead back to him, according to the classicist H.J. Rose. Accounts vary as to his own parentage:

* Orchomenus and Hermippe, his real father being Poseidon;
* Poseidon either by (1) the Oceanid Callirhoe; (2) Tritogeneia, daughter of Aeolus; (3) Euryanassa, daughter of Hyperphas or lastly, Chrysogone, daughter of Almus;
* father is only mentioned as (1) Aeolus; (2) Sisyphus; (3) Chryses, son of Poseidon and Chrysogeneia; (4) Eteocles or (5) Ares (6) Aleus and lastly (7) Halmus (Almus).

Minyas was married to Tritolenia (Tritogeneia), Clytodora, or Phanosyra, daughter of Paion. The following are the children of Minyas by one of her suppose wives:

* By Clytodora, Presbon, Eteoclymene and Periclymene;
* By Phanosyra, Orchomenus, Diochthondas and Athamas;
* Clymene, also called Periclymene, mother of Iphiclus and Alcimede by Phylacus or Cephalus;
* Cyparissus, the founder of Anticyra;
* the Minyades, three daughters who were turned into bats;
* Persephone, wife of Amphion (son of Iasus) and mother of Chloris and Phylomache, respectively the wives of Neleus and Pelias; and lastly
* Elara, the mother of the giant Tityus.
== Mythology ==
According to Apollonius Rhodius and Pausanias, Minyas was the first king to have made a treasury, of which the ruins were still extant in Pausanias&#x27; times.

<text>In Greek and Roman mythology, Misenus (Μισηνός) was a name attributed to two individuals.

* Misenus was a friend of Odysseus.
* Misenus was a character in Virgil&#x27;s epic poem the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. He was a brother-in-arms of Hector and, after Hector&#x27;s death, Aeneas&#x27; trumpeter. In Book VI, it is revealed that he had challenged the gods to a musical contest on the conch shell, and for his impudence was drowned by Triton. Aeneas was told by the Cumaean Sibyl at that time that Misenus&#x27;s body had to be buried before he could enter the Underworld. The passage detailing the funeral rites, performed by the Trojan priest Corynaeus, gives an insight into Roman burial customs and the importance the Romans placed on respect for the dead. It is regarded as the passage of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; most imitative of the Annales of Ennius. Cape Misenum, near Cumae, is supposedly named for Misenus, as noted in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. His being called &quot;Aeolides&quot; arose from the legendary connection between the Aeolian and Campanian Cumae.

<doc id="82835" wikidata="Q465518" url="?curid=82835" title="Momus">
<text>Momus (; Ancient Greek: Μῶμος &quot;Momos&quot;) in Greek mythology was the personification of satire and mockery, two stories about whom figure among Aesop&#x27;s Fables. During the Renaissance, several literary works used him as a mouthpiece for their criticism of tyranny, while others later made him a critic of contemporary society. Onstage he finally became the figure of harmless fun.

== In classical literature ==

As a sharp-tongued spirit of unfair criticism, Momus was eventually expelled from the company of the gods on Mount Olympus. His name is related to , meaning &#x27;blame&#x27;, &#x27;reproach&#x27;, or &#x27;disgrace&#x27;. Hesiod said that Momus was a son of Night (Nyx), &quot;though she lay with none&quot;, and the twin of the misery goddess Oizys. In the 8th century BCE epic &quot;Cypria&quot;, Momus was credited with stirring up the Trojan War in order to reduce the human population. Sophocles wrote a later satyr play called &quot;Momos&quot;, now almost entirely lost, which may have derived from this.

Two of Aesop&#x27;s fables feature the god. The most widely reported of these in Classical times is numbered 100 in the Perry Index. There Momus is asked to judge the handiwork of three gods (who vary depending on the version): a man, a house and a bull. He found all at fault: the man because his heart was not on view to judge his thoughts; the house because it had no wheels so as to avoid troublesome neighbours; and the bull because it did not have eyes in its horns to guide it when charging. Because of it, Plutarch and Aristotle criticized Aesop&#x27;s story-telling as deficient in understanding, while Lucian insisted that anyone with sense was able to sound out a man&#x27;s thoughts.

As another result, Momus became a by-word for fault-finding, and the saying that if not even he could criticize something then that was the sign of its perfection. Thus a poem in the Greek Anthology remarks of statues by Praxiteles that &quot;Momus himself will cry out, &#x27;Father Zeus, this was perfect skill&#x27;.&quot; Looking the lovely Aphrodite over, according to a second fable of Aesop&#x27;s, number 455 in the Perry Index, it was light-heartedly noted that he could not find anything about her to fault except that her sandals squeaked.
==Political satire==
In Lucian&#x27;s 2nd-century social comedy &quot;The Gods in Council&quot;, Momus takes a leading role in a discussion on how to purge Olympus of foreign gods and barbarian demi-gods who are lowering its heavenly tone.

Renaissance author Leon Battista Alberti wrote the political work &quot;Momus, or The Prince&quot; (1446), which continued the god&#x27;s story after his exile to earth. Since his continued criticism of the gods was destabilizing the divine establishment, Jupiter bound him to a rock and had him castrated. Later, however, missing his candor, Jupiter sought out a manuscript that Momus had left behind in which was described how a land could be ruled with strictly regulated justice.

At the start of the 16th century, Erasmus also presented Momus as a champion of the legitimate criticism of authorities. Allowing that the god was &quot;not quite as popular as others, because few people freely admit criticism, yet I dare say of the whole crowd of gods celebrated by the poets, none was more useful.&quot; Giordano Bruno&#x27;s philosophical treatise &quot;The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast&quot; (1584) also looks back to Lucian&#x27;s example. Momus there plays an integral part in the series of dialogues conducted by the Olympian deities and Bruno&#x27;s narrators as Jupiter seeks to purge the universe of evil.

==Social satire==
17th-century English writers introduced the figure of Momus in a gentler spirit of fun, as in Thomas Carew&#x27;s masque &quot;Coelum Britannicum&quot; (1634), which was acted before King Charles I and his court. In &quot;Coelum Britannicum&quot;, Momus and Mercury draw up a plan to reform the &quot;Star Chamber&quot; of Heaven. Two centuries later, &quot;Coelum Britannicum&quot; influenced Henry David Thoreau as he was preparing to write his &quot;Walden&quot;.

John Dryden&#x27;s short &quot;Secular Masque&quot; (1700) mocks contemporary society through the medium of the Classical divinities, with Momus playing a leading part in deflating with sarcastic wit the sports represented by Diana (hunting), Mars (war), and Venus (love), for &quot;&#x27;Tis better to laugh than to cry.&quot; It is with similar wryness that Carl Sandburg&#x27;s statue of &quot;Momus&quot; (1914) surveys the never-changing human scene, &quot;On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history&quot;, as they continue to overpopulate the world and then bleed it.

==Comedy==

Elsewhere in Europe, Momus was becoming softened into a figure of light-hearted and sentimental comedy, the equivalent of Harlequin in the French and Italian &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;. A typical production has him competing for the amorous favours of a nymph in Henry Desmarets&#x27; opéra-ballet &quot;Les amours de Momus&quot; (1695).

By this period, Momus was the patron of humorous satire, partnering the figures of comedy and tragedy. As such he appeared flanked by these female figures on the frontispiece to &quot;The Beauties of the English Stage&quot; (1737), while in Leonard Defraine&#x27;s &quot;Figures of Fabled Gods&quot; (1820), he partners Comus, god of Carnival, and Themis, patroness of assemblies. Because of the Harlequin connection, and as the character able to make home-truths palatable through the use of humour, Momus had now taken the place of the Fool on a French Minchiate card pack. He also lent his name to George Saville Carey&#x27;s satirical poem, &quot;Momus, or a critical examination into the merits of the performers and comic pieces at the Theatre-Royal in the Hay-Market&quot; (1767). The god himself plays no part there, only &quot;Momus&#x27; sons,&quot; the comic actors.

<text>Mormo (, &quot;Mormō&quot;) was a female spirit in Greek folklore, whose name was invoked by mothers and nurses to frighten children to keep them from misbehaving.

The term mormolyce (; pl. &quot;mormolykeia&quot; ), also spelt mormolyceum ( &quot;mormolukeîon&quot;), is considered equivalent.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;mormo&quot; has the plural form &quot;mormones&quot; which means &quot;fearful ones&quot; or &quot;hideous one(s)&quot;, and is related to an array of words that signify &quot;fright&quot;.

The variant &quot;mormolyce&quot; translates to &quot;terrible wolves&quot;, with the stem &quot;-lykeios&quot; meaning &quot;of a wolf&quot;.

==Description==
The original Mormo was a woman of Corinth, who ate her children then flew out; according to an account only attested in a single source. Mormolyca (as the name appears in Doric Greek: ) is designated as the wetnurse () of Acheron by Sophron ( 430 BC).

Mormo or Moromolyce has been described as a female specter, phantom, or ghost by modern commentators. A mormolyce is one of several names given to the female &quot;phasma&quot; (phantom) in Philostratus&#x27;s &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot;.

Mormo is glossed as equivalent to Lamia and &quot;mormolykeion&quot;, considered to be frightening beings, in the &quot;Suda&quot;, a lexicon of the Byzantine Periods. Mombro () or Mormo are a bugbear ( &quot;phóbētron&quot;), the &quot;Suda&quot; also says.

&quot;Mormo&quot; and &quot;Gello&quot; were also aliases for Lamia according to one scholiast, who also claimed she was queen of the Laestrygonians, the race of man-eating giants.

===Bugbear===
The name &quot;Mormo&quot; or the synonymous &quot;Mormolyceion&quot; was used by the Greeks as a bugbear or bogey word to frighten children.

Some of its instances are found in Aristophanes. The poet Erinna, in her poem &quot;The Distaff&quot;, recalls how her and her friend Baucis feared Mormo as children.

Mormo as an object of fear for infants was even recorded in the &quot;Alexiad&quot; written by a Byzantine princess around the First Crusade.

===Modern interpretations===
A mormo or a lamia may also be associated with the empusa, a phantom sent by the goddess Hekate.

<doc id="82838" wikidata="Q1065802" url="?curid=82838" title="Moros">
<text>In Greek mythology, Moros or Morus (Ancient Greek: Μόρος means &#x27;doom, fate&#x27;) is the personified spirit of impending doom, who drives mortals to their deadly fate. It was also said that Moros gave people the ability to foresee their death. His Roman equivalent was Fatum.

== Family ==
Moros is the offspring of Nyx, the primordial goddess of the night. It is suggested by Roman authors that Moros was son of Erebus, primordial god of darkness. However, in Hesiod&#x27;s Theogony it is suggested that Nyx bore him by herself, along with several of her other children.

Regardless of the presence or absence of Moros&#x27; father, this would make him the brother of the Moirai, or the Fates. Among his other siblings are Thanatos and the Keres, death spirits who represented the physical aspects of death—Keres being the bringers of violent death and terminal sickness, while Thanatos represents a more peaceful passing.

== Mythology ==
In &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, the titular Titan suggests that he gave humanity the spirit Elpis, the personification of hope, in order to help them ignore the inevitability of Moros. He is also referred to as &quot;the all-destroying god, who, even in the realm of Death, does not set his victim free,&quot; further supporting his image as representative of the inevitability of death and suffering.

=== Aeschylus&#x27; account ===
Aeschylus, Fragment 199 (from Plutarch, Life and Poety of Homer 157) (trans. Weir Smyth):

&quot;A man dies not for the many wounds that pierce his breast, unless it be that life&#x27;s end keep pace with death, nor by sitting on his hearth at home doth he the more escape his appointed doom (&quot;peprômenon moros&quot;).&quot;

The word &quot;moros&quot; is not personified here but the passage provides a clear picture of the concept.

=== Christianity ===
Along with Thanatos, he is associated as the rider of the pale horse in the Apocalypse.

<doc id="82841" wikidata="Q182037" url="?curid=82841" title="Naiad">
<text>In Greek mythology, the naiads (; ), sometimes also hydriads, are a type of female spirit, or nymph, presiding over fountains, wells, springs, streams, brooks and other bodies of fresh water.

They are distinct from river gods, who embodied rivers, and the very ancient spirits that inhabited the still waters of marshes, ponds and lagoon-lakes such as pre-Mycenaean Lerna in the Argolis.

== Etymology ==
The Greek word is ( ), plural ( ). It derives from (), &quot;to flow&quot;, or (), &quot;body of flowing water&quot;.

==Mythology==
Naiads were often the object of archaic local cults, worshipped as essential to humans. Boys and girls at coming-of-age ceremonies dedicated their childish locks to the local naiad of the spring. In places like Lerna their waters&#x27; ritual cleansings were credited with magical medical properties. Animals were ritually drowned there. Oracles might be situated by ancient springs.

Naiads could be dangerous: Hylas of the &quot;Argo&quot;’s crew was lost when he was taken by naiads fascinated by his beauty. The naiads were also known to exhibit jealous tendencies. Theocritus&#x27;s story of naiad jealousy was that of a shepherd, Daphnis, who was the lover of Nomia or Echenais; Daphnis had on several occasions been unfaithful to Nomia and as revenge she permanently blinded him. The nymph Salmacis raped Hermaphroditus and fused with him when he tried to escape.

The water nymph associated with particular springs was known all through Europe in places with no direct connection with Greece, surviving in the Celtic wells of northwest Europe that have been rededicated to Saints, and in the medieval Melusine.

Walter Burkert points out, &quot;When in the &quot;Iliad&quot; [xx.4–9] Zeus calls the gods into assembly on Mount Olympus, it is not only the well-known Olympians who come along, but also all the nymphs and all the rivers; Okeanos alone remains at his station&quot;, Greek hearers recognized this impossibility as the poet&#x27;s hyperbole, which proclaimed the universal power of Zeus over the ancient natural world: &quot;the worship of these deities,&quot; Burkert confirms, &quot;is limited only by the fact that they are inseparably identified with a specific locality.&quot;

==Interpretation==
Robert Graves offered a sociopolitical reading of the common myth-type in which a mythic king is credited with marrying a naiad and founding a city: it was the newly arrived Hellenes justifying their presence. The loves and rapes of Zeus, according to Graves&#x27; readings, record the supplanting of ancient local cults by Olympian ones (Graves 1955, &quot;passim&quot;).

So, in the back-story of the myth of Aristaeus, Hypseus, a king of the Lapiths, married Chlidanope, a naiad, who bore him Cyrene. Aristaeus had more than ordinary mortal experience with the naiads: when his bees died in Thessaly, he went to consult them. His aunt Arethusa invited him below the water&#x27;s surface, where he was washed with water from a perpetual spring and given advice.

<text>Sex and the City is an American romantic comedy-drama television series created by Darren Star for HBO, based on the newspaper column and 1996 book by Candace Bushnell. It premiered in the United States on June 6, 1998, and concluded on February 22, 2004, with 94 episodes broadcast over six seasons. It had various producers, screenwriters and directors, principally Michael Patrick King.

The series follows the lives of four female friends living in New York City: the streetwise newspaper columnist Carrie Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker), the sexually liberated public relations professional Samantha Jones (played by Kim Cattrall), the more conservative art dealer Charlotte York (played by Kristin Davis) and the cynical lawyer Miranda Hobbes (played by Cynthia Nixon). The stories address sex, relationships, friendship and femininity. It became a cultural phenomenon and later inspired two movies and a spinoff &quot;And Just Like That&quot;.

&quot;Sex and the City&quot; has received both acclaim and criticism for its characters and themes, and is credited with helping to increase HBO&#x27;s popularity as a network. It won accolades including seven Primetime Emmy Awards, eight Golden Globe Award and three Screen Actors Guild Award. The series was ranked fifth on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;New TV Classics&quot; list, and has been cited as one of the best television series of all time. The series still airs in syndication worldwide. It spawned two feature films, &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (2008) and &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot; (2010), and a prequel television series commissioned by The CW, &quot;The Carrie Diaries&quot; (2013–14). A sequel series, &quot;And Just Like That...,&quot; premiered on HBO Max on December 9, 2021, without Cattrall.

==Development==
The show is based on writer Candace Bushnell&#x27;s column &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, published in &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, which was later compiled into a book of the same name. Bushnell has mentioned in several interviews that the character of Carrie Bradshaw in her columns is her alter ego. Initially, she wrote the column from her first-person perspective but later invented Carrie, introduced as Bushnell&#x27;s friend, so her parents would not realize they were reading about her own sex life. Both Bushnell and the television version of Carrie (who had no last name in the column) share the same initials, further emphasizing their connection. Like Bushnell, Carrie writes columns for the fictional &quot;New York Star&quot;, which are eventually compiled into a book within the series, and later becomes a writer for &quot;Vogue&quot;.

Bushnell collaborated with television producer Darren Star, whom she had met while profiling him for &quot;Vogue&quot;, to adapt the columns for television. Both HBO and ABC expressed interest in the series, but Star ultimately chose HBO for the creative freedom it offered. Star wrote the pilot with Sarah Jessica Parker in mind for the role of Carrie. According to Parker, &quot;I was flattered but didn&#x27;t want to do it. He convinced me, begged me to do it, and I signed a contract.&quot; The pilot episode was shot in June 1997, a year before the series premiered. However, Parker initially disliked the pilot, stating, &quot;I hated the look, the clothes ... I didn&#x27;t think it worked&quot; and feared it might end her career. She even offered to work on three HBO movies unpaid to be released from her contract. Though Star refused to release her, he listened to her concerns and made significant changes before shooting the first season. Reflecting on the experience, Parker said, &quot;The funny thing, after the first episode of season one, I never looked back, and the rest is history. I never thought, though, that the show would become what it has become.&quot;

==Cast and characters==

===Carrie Bradshaw===

Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) is the narrator and main protagonist of the series. Each episode is structured around her inner monologue while writing her weekly column, &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, for a fictional newspaper, the &quot;New York Star&quot;. Carrie Bradshaw was originally supposed to be a lawyer but the producers changed her character to a columnist because they felt her legal career wouldn’t give her enough freedom to explore New York City&#x27;s nightlife. A member of New York&#x27;s social scene, she is known for her unique fashion sense and lives in a studio apartment in an Upper East Side brownstone. Her best friend outside of the central group of women is Stanford Blatch (Willie Garson), a gay talent agent from an aristocratic family.

Carrie has an on-again, off-again relationship with Mr. Big (Chris Noth), a prominent businessman. Big, who is once-divorced at the series&#x27; start, is a recurring source of emotional conflict due to his reluctance to fully commit to a relationship. A running bit in the series involves Carrie being interrupted whenever she is about to introduce Mr. Big by name; his first name, John, is only revealed in the final moments of the series’ last episode (Season 6, Episode 20).

Carrie and Big break up for a second time in Season 2 when he leaves for an extended business stay in Paris and shows little enthusiasm in maintaining a long-distance relationship. Carrie is heartbroken and later encounters Big at a party in The Hamptons with his new, much younger girlfriend, Natasha. Carrie tries to maintain a friendship with Big, but it dissolves when he becomes engaged to Natasha, a level of commitment he never offered Carrie.

In Season 3, Carrie begins dating Aidan Shaw (John Corbett), an up-and-coming Manhattan furniture designer who is more traditional and patient than her previous boyfriends. Despite their happiness, Carrie starts an affair with Big, which ends when Natasha catches Carrie at Big&#x27;s apartment. Carrie and Aiden break up after she confesses her infidelity. They eventually reconcile in Season 4. Aidan proposes but Carrie&#x27;s ongoing connection with Big causes their final breakup.

As the series progresses, Carrie and Big attempt to redefine their relationship, eventually becoming friends. However, when Big has a health issue in the final season, Carrie realizes her true feelings for him. She later moves on due to Big&#x27;s continued inability to commit.

In the final season, Carrie meets Aleksandr Petrovsky (Mikhail Baryshnikov), a famous artist who introduces her to a different, more cosmopolitan lifestyle and is more romantically engaged than Big. He eventually invites her to move to Paris with him, which she accepts. However, Carrie&#x27;s friends, particularly Miranda, express concerns that Aleksandr is controlling and Carrie is changing herself to fit into his world.

In Paris, Carrie is quickly disillusioned due to Aleksandr&#x27;s frequent absence due to his work. Carrie calls Miranda and confesses her regret over leaving New York. Mr. Big goes to Paris to win her back. After a confrontation with Aleksandr, who accidentally slaps her during an argument, Carrie leaves their hotel room. Big arrives at their hotel and finds Carrie in the lobby. He says she is &quot;the one&quot;. They return to New York together.

===Charlotte York===

Charlotte York (Kristin Davis) is depicted as having a conventional, privileged Episcopal upbringing in Connecticut and works in an art gallery. A classic overachiever and perfectionist, Charlotte was a &quot;straight A&quot; student who attended Smith College and was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma (there are no sororities at the real Smith College) majoring in art history with a minor in finance. During the series, it is revealed that Charlotte was voted homecoming queen, prom queen, &quot;most popular&quot;, student body president, and track team captain, in addition to being an active cheerleader and teen model. She is not rich, but wealthy. Her father, Stephen York, was a doctor.

As the antithesis of Samantha, Charlotte is optimistic, hopelessly romantic, and a firm believer in true love and soulmates. She places significant emphasis on emotional love over physical desire and is focused on finding &quot;the one&quot; to marry and start a family. Her dating life throughout the show reflects this pursuit, often involving men of status and pedigree, such as bankers, doctors, and lawyers.

Charlotte can be a dark horse, and it is learnt that she once had a dalliance with an Orthodox Jewish artist, she dressed in drag for a portrait, and she allowed an artist to paint a picture of her vulva. She can be an &quot;East Side Princess&quot; sometimes, and she and Samantha occasionally come to blows over their differing opinions about love and sex.

In season 3, Charlotte decides she will be married that year and sets about canvassing her married friends to set her up on dates. One married friend usurps her blind date to try to start an affair with her. Horrified, she dashes into the street and trips in front of a taxi, carrying Trey MacDougal (Kyle MacLachlan), an attractive, old-money, Scottish-American cardiologist with pedigree, a Park Avenue apartment and country estate in Connecticut. They fall in love at first sight, and he appears to be everything she has always wanted. Things move quickly and Charlotte, convinced he is the one, suggests they marry. He agrees, and they are married very shortly afterward (with the help of wedding planner Anthony Marentino; a gay Sicilian who is as forceful as Charlotte is timid).

Wishing to &quot;do things the right way&quot;, Charlotte has withheld having sex with Trey, hoping for a romantic and traditional wedding night. On the evening before the big day, she gets drunk with the other women and goes to Trey for sex. Unfortunately, it does not go well; Trey reveals he suffers from impotence (though he won&#x27;t say the word).

While concerned, Charlotte presses ahead with the wedding. Minutes before walking down the aisle, she confides in Carrie about what happened the night before and nearly does not go through with the marriage. As the marriage begins things do not get any better in their intimate relationship, and Trey refuses to address matters either physically or psychologically, resisting their marriage counselor&#x27;s advice. Matters are not helped by Trey&#x27;s overbearing mother Bunny (Frances Sternhagen), a manipulative sort who intrudes on Trey and Charlotte&#x27;s relationship and apartment on a regular basis. Not long into the marriage, on a weekend trip to the MacDougal country estate, Charlotte, frustrated by Trey&#x27;s lack of sexual attention, kisses the hunky gardener, and is caught by a relative. Though Trey suggests they can stay together and have separate lives, Charlotte cannot accept this. She and Trey separate, and she moves back into her old apartment.

While separated, Trey suddenly gets his mojo back and they mend their sexual relationship. But it takes Charlotte getting fed up with being a slave to &quot;the penis&quot; that convinces Trey to grow up and invite Charlotte to move back in, which she does. All seems to be well, and soon Trey tells Charlotte he&#x27;s ready to try for a baby. Having no luck with natural method of conception, Charlotte seeks fertility treatment and is told she has a very low chance of becoming pregnant. Seeking other options, she begins hormone injections and looks into adopting a Chinese baby girl, which Bunny does not approve of.

A combination of these factors once again ignites old tensions with Trey and Bunny, culminating in Trey&#x27;s deciding he no longer wants a family. Charlotte tries to adjust to this change, but is clearly upset, since having a husband and family were her dream. Trey finally tells Charlotte that she shouldn&#x27;t have to give up her dream for him. Trey lets Charlotte keep their apartment after he moves out. However, Bunny is not content to let Charlotte keep the apartment and the apartment becomes a contentious aspect of the divorce proceedings.

When Charlotte&#x27;s marriage ends, she meets Harry Goldenblatt (Evan Handler), her Jewish divorce lawyer, at the beginning of season 5. She is not attracted to him initially but, spurred on by Anthony, she starts a purely physical relationship with Harry. Harry is the opposite of Trey: short, bald, hairy, uncouth but funny, passionate, and attentive. Their sexual relationship is fulfilling, and eventually they begin dating properly. However, Harry says he cannot be serious with Charlotte because she isn&#x27;t a Jew.

Believing Harry to be her future, Charlotte converts to Judaism and this sees her struggle with losing her Christian faith and ideologies including Christmas and Easter. After her conversion, Charlotte celebrates her first Shabbat with Harry but loses her temper when he appears to not appreciate all her efforts. The argument quickly devolves into Charlotte&#x27;s badgering Harry to propose and, feeling pressured, he storms out, and they break up, but not before revealing that Charlotte&#x27;s dream was in reach after all, that he&#x27;d bought a ring.

Charlotte is heartbroken but tries to move on with her life. Sometime later, at a singles event at the synagogue, she bumps into Harry. She tells him she loves him and doesn&#x27;t care if he never marries her as long as they can be together. Having missed her, too, Harry proposes, and they marry in a traditional Jewish ceremony.

Charlotte, against all the odds, becomes pregnant after acupuncture therapy but loses the baby very early on. Charlotte is crushed, but they later go on to adopt a baby girl, Lily, from China, and it is revealed during &quot;Sex and the City&quot; that Charlotte later naturally conceives and gives birth to the couple&#x27;s second daughter, Rose.

===Miranda Hobbes===

Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon) is a career-minded lawyer with cynical views on relationships and men, a struggle she navigates throughout the series. A 1990 Harvard Law School graduate from the Philadelphia area, she is Carrie Bradshaw&#x27;s confidante and often serves as the voice of reason within the group.

Carrie sets Miranda up on a blind date with her friend Skipper, but Miranda finds him too passive for her tastes.

Miranda&#x27;s most significant relationship is with bartender Steve Brady (David Eigenberg), whom she meets by chance one night. What begins as a one-night stand develops into a more serious relationship. Despite their strong connection, Steve feels insecure about Miranda&#x27;s financial success and struggles with the income disparity between them. Tensions arise when Miranda attempts to buy Steve a suit for an event at her law firm; Steve, feeling inadequate, maxes out his credit cards to buy it himself, only to return it later and break up with Miranda, believing she deserves someone more on her level. Miranda is heartbroken and questions if her career success is a hindrance to finding a lasting relationship.

In Season 2, after avoiding Steve on the street, Miranda is confronted by him at her home. They rekindle their relationship, and Steve eventually moves into Miranda&#x27;s apartment. However, their differing views on having children—Steve is eager to start a family, while Miranda is focused on her career—lead to their breakup. A failed attempt to care for a puppy together further highlights their differences, with Miranda feeling burdened by Steve&#x27;s lack of responsibility.

Steve later opens his own bar, encouraged by Miranda&#x27;s criticisms. They maintain a friendship, and in Season 4, when Steve is diagnosed with testicular cancer, Miranda steps in to support him, helping him through his surgery and treatment. Their relationship deepens, and after one night of intimacy, Miranda discovers she is unexpectedly pregnant, despite having been told she had a &quot;lazy ovary&quot;.

At the same time, Charlotte is struggling with infertility, leading to tension when she learns that Miranda, who is initially considering an abortion, is pregnant. At the clinic, Miranda decides to keep the baby and later gives birth to a son, Brady (Steve&#x27;s last name). Miranda and Steve co-parent Brady, with the help of Miranda&#x27;s housekeeper/nanny, Magda, an older Eastern European woman who becomes a constant presence in Miranda&#x27;s life. The series explores Miranda&#x27;s challenges as a single, working mother and her struggle to balance her career with her new responsibilities.

Miranda eventually realizes she is still in love with Steve, but before she can express her feelings, Steve reveals he is dating a younger woman named Debbie. Choosing not to disrupt his new relationship, Miranda keeps her feelings to herself, and their interactions remain platonic.

Shortly afterward, Miranda begins dating Robert Leeds, an attractive African American doctor for the New York Knicks. Their relationship becomes serious when Robert confesses his love for Miranda, but she is unable to reciprocate. At Brady&#x27;s first birthday party, Miranda has an epiphany and confesses her love to Steve, who reassures her that he loves her too. They end their respective relationships and reunite.

Miranda and Steve marry in a modest ceremony in a community garden. Initially cramped in Miranda&#x27;s one-bedroom apartment, they decide to purchase a larger home and eventually move to a house in Brooklyn, a decision Miranda initially resists.

In the final episodes of season 6, Miranda and Steve care for Steve&#x27;s mother Mary, who is suffering from dementia/Alzheimer&#x27;s. Miranda tells Steve that his mother can come stay with them in the Brooklyn house and even bathes her when Mary has a bad episode. Magda comments to Miranda that the things she does for Mary are what&#x27;s called love.

===Samantha Jones===

The oldest and most sexually confident of the foursome, Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall) is an independent businesswoman with a career in public relations (PR). She is confident, strong, and outspoken, often referring to herself as a &quot;try-sexual&quot;—someone who will try anything once. Early in the series, Samantha declares that she has given up on traditional relationships and instead chooses to have sex &quot;like a man&quot;, purely for physical gratification without emotional attachment.

Throughout the show, Samantha engages in numerous brief sexual encounters, including a lesbian relationship with an artist named Maria (Sônia Braga). This marks her first attempt at monogamy, but her sexual past with men soon interferes and she returns to her previous lifestyle. Later, she secures the PR business for hotel magnate Richard Wright (James Remar), who is her male counterpart—handsome, sexually liberated, and uninterested in long-term commitments. As their relationship develops, Samantha finds herself unexpectedly falling for Richard, which frightens her. Despite her efforts to hide her feelings, Richard reciprocates, and they enter a monogamous relationship.

However, Samantha&#x27;s trust in Richard falters when she catches him cheating on her, leading to heartbreak. Although they briefly reconcile after Richard apologizes and showers her with expensive gifts, Samantha&#x27;s jealousy and inability to trust him ultimately cause her to end the relationship.

In the final season, Samantha becomes involved with Jerry &quot;Smith&quot; Jerrod (Jason Lewis), a much younger aspiring actor. Although their relationship begins as a casual fling, Samantha helps Smith advance his acting career through her PR expertise. Over time, their intense sexual chemistry and Smith&#x27;s refusal to tolerate Samantha&#x27;s emotional defenses lead to a deeper connection. When Samantha is diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoes chemotherapy, Smith stands by her side, even shaving his head in solidarity when she loses her hair. Despite her attempts to push him away, Smith remains devoted, and their bond strengthens.

They remain together, and in the first &quot;Sex and the City&quot; film, it is revealed that Samantha has moved to Los Angeles with Smith to manage his career. However, she eventually breaks up with him, realizing that she has prioritized their relationship and his career over her own needs and desires. Samantha decides to end the relationship, choosing to focus on herself and her life in New York. She and Smith part on good terms, remaining friends.

Criticism has been expressed regarding the influence &quot;Sex and the City&quot; has on adolescents and how the images portrayed on the show affect the way women and young girls view themselves.

Tanya Gold of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; stated, &quot;&quot;Sex and the City&quot; is to feminism what sugar is to dental care&quot; and argued that the show was dominated by images of women as either childlike or as sex objects. She pointed to the opening credits, where the protagonist wears a ballet skirt—&quot;the sort that toddlers wear&quot;—and is then passed by a bus ad featuring a scantily clad photo of herself. &quot;In another [episode], Carrie realizes she is homeless because she has spent $40,000 on shoes and does not have a deposit for an apartment. (In this crisis, she cries and borrows the money for the deposit—what child would do anything else?).&quot;

In addition to focusing on finding and keeping a man, the lead character also routinely hides her true thoughts and feelings from the men she dates. The show uses voiceovers to reveal Carrie&#x27;s inner thoughts, which often conflict with how she expresses herself externally. Pop culture expert Ashli L. Dykes notes that &quot;... [the] fear that men will no longer find a woman attractive if she reveals her true self is in contrast to the relationships among the four main female characters...&quot;

Academic critics, however, are divided on whether &quot;Sex and the City&quot; is anti-feminist, feminist, or post-feminist. Some argue that regardless of the label applied, the show contributed significantly &quot;to ongoing dialogue&quot; and that it &quot;shows women in a world where they can be feminine, attractive, and feminist at the same time ... the series gives a forum to a renewed postfeminist debate.&quot;

Andrea Press criticized the show for its handling of topics such as unexpected pregnancy, arguing that it contrasts with progressive feminist thought. In one episode, Miranda faces an unexpected pregnancy, prompting Carrie to reflect on her own experience with pregnancy and abortion. Press contends that Carrie&#x27;s shame when sharing this story with her boyfriend serves to &quot;undermine&quot; the hard-won freedoms that allowed her choice, presenting &quot;multiple critical perspectives toward the act.&quot; Press also argued that while the show is often lauded as a champion of progressive feminism, its characters adhere to traditional views of female gender roles, focusing heavily on appearance, glamour, and consumerism. She pointed out that the outfits worn by the characters are as central to the show as the storyline itself, with a significant emphasis on consumption and constant marketing messages throughout the series.

In retrospective analyses of the show, critics have reassessed Carrie Bradshaw as an unsympathetic protagonist, despite her portrayal as a positive figure. In 2013, &quot;Glamour&quot; called Carrie &quot;the worst&quot; character on the show, stating that &quot;her brattiness and self-absorption eclipsed her redeeming qualities and even her awesome shoes.&quot; In a 2010 retrospective on the previous two decades of pop culture, &quot;ABC News&quot; named Carrie one of the ten worst characters of the past twenty years, describing her as a &quot;snippy, self-righteous Manhattan snob&quot; and citing her actions in &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot; as evidence that she was beyond personal growth or redemption. Emily Nussbaum of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, reflecting on the show a decade after it ended, argued that Bradshaw was &quot;the unacknowledged first female anti-hero on television,&quot; who began as a &quot;happy, curious explorer, out companionably smoking with modellizers,&quot; but from the second season on, she &quot;spun out, becoming anxious, obsessive, and, despite her charm, wildly self-centered.&quot; Nussbaum also asserted that the show&#x27;s reputation has &quot;shrunk and faded&quot; over time, largely due to disappointment that the series &quot;gave in&quot; to the limits of romantic comedy in its later seasons. She contended that until then, &quot;Sex and the City&quot; &quot;was sharp, iconoclastic television.&quot; In addressing why the show is now &quot;so often portrayed as a set of empty, static cartoons, an embarrassment to womankind,&quot; Nussbaum suggested: &quot;It&#x27;s a classic misunderstanding, I think, stemming from an unexamined hierarchy: the assumption that anything stylized (or formulaic, or pleasurable, or funny, or feminine, or explicit about sex rather than about violence, or made collaboratively) must be inferior.&quot; Nussbaum also challenged criticism of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; as anti-feminist, advocating for a more nuanced view of the characters as situated within different waves of feminism: &quot;Miranda and Carrie were second-wave feminists, who believed in egalitarianism; Charlotte and Samantha were third-wave feminists, focused on exploiting the power of femininity, from opposing angles.&quot;

A 2018 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; titled &quot;&#x27;That show was as white as it gets!&#x27;: &quot;Sex and the City&#x27;s&quot; problematic legacy,&quot; highlighted the lack of non-white series regulars and &quot;racial insensitivities&quot; in the show, such as Carrie&#x27;s reference to &quot;ghetto gold&quot; and Samantha&#x27;s wearing of an afro wig to cover her baldness from chemotherapy. The article also referenced the #wokecharlotte memes that gained popularity on social media in 2017, in which Charlotte chastises Carrie for comments that retrospectively appear insensitive and ignorant (e.g., Carrie&#x27;s labeling of bisexuality as a &quot;layover on the way to Gay Town&quot; and Samantha&#x27;s use of transphobic language to refer to the sex workers outside her apartment). The creator of the memes stated that &quot;it is satisfying to see the show get called out for the stuff that wouldn&#x27;t hold up in 2017. It&#x27;s true that it was progressive for its time, but that doesn&#x27;t mean contemporary viewers should be dismissive of some of its more problematic content.&quot; On the 20th anniversary of the show&#x27;s premiere, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published an opinion piece by Rebecca Nicholson, arguing that the show should not be discounted because of its retrospective flaws but should still be appreciated for being &quot;a brilliant, daring, pioneering show.&quot;

==Broadcast and distribution==
Season one of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; aired on HBO from June to August 1998. Season two followed, broadcasting from June to October 1999. Season three aired from June to October 2000. Season four was split into two parts: the first aired from June to August 2001, and the second in January and February 2002.

The final season, season six, consisted of twenty episodes that were also split into two parts: the first aired from June to September 2003, and the second from January to February 2004.

===Syndication===
&quot;Sex and the City&quot; is currently syndicated in the US by HBO corporate sibling (under Warner Bros. Discovery) Warner Bros. Television Distribution. CBS Studios (successors to Rysher Entertainment and Paramount Domestic Television) and their distribution arm own international rights. The series was filmed with traditional broadcast syndication in mind during its run, and pre-planned scenes with different dialogue and content were created specifically for syndication, along with appropriate cuts of each episode to fit a 22-minute timeslot which includes advertising.

====United States====
The American cable channel HBO was the original broadcaster of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;; HBO Max now carries the entire series as it was originally aired. TBS and WGN America were the first American channels to syndicate the show, utilizing the secondary syndicated cut; it also aired on various broadcast stations for several seasons. As of 2021, E! occasionally broadcasts the syndicated version of the series.

In February 2021, a remastered high-definition version of the series was released on HBO Max. The original film negatives were rescanned at 4K resolution and reformatted to a 16:9 aspect ratio by extending the sides of the frame. In May 2023, following the rebranding of HBO Max to Max, the series became available in 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos. It was released on Netflix on April 1, 2024.

====Canada====
In Canada, the cable channel Bravo aired the first run of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; every Saturday at 11:00 PM, a few weeks behind the U.S. HBO broadcast (the series predated the 2008 establishment of HBO Canada).

====Australia====
In Australia, the Nine Network aired the series every Monday between 9:30 PM and 11:00 PM. After 2004, the cable channel W aired it until the summer of 2008, when Arena began airing it alongside &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, with promos stating, &quot;all the good guys are gay.&quot; The series was also repeated on Network Ten from 2005 to 2010 and on Eleven (later rebranded as 10 Peach) from February 2011. It is currently syndicated on the cable channel Fox Showcase and occasionally features in marathons on the cable channel Binge, where back-to-back episodes of various TV shows are aired.

====Ireland====
In Ireland, TV3 premiered &quot;Sex and the City&quot; in February 1999. Since 2006, repeats of the series have aired on 3e.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, Channel 4 originally aired the series, with the first episode broadcast on 3 February 1999. As of August 2009, a double bill of the show aired each weeknight at 10:30 PM on Comedy Central, and another double bill aired on Wednesdays at 9 PM on 5*. From 2015, the series was repeated on CBS Drama. Starting on 26 February 2018, the series returned to Channel 4 on its music-oriented channel, 4Music. Since 2020, the series has been aired on Sky Comedy.

==Home media==
The first five seasons of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; were released on VHS in box sets.

All six seasons have since been released commercially on DVD, with the sixth season split into two parts. These DVDs have been released in region 1 (Americas), region 2 (Europe &amp; Middle East), region 3 (Korea), and region 4 (Oceania &amp; South Pacific) formats. In addition to region encoding, the releases vary depending on the region in which they were distributed.

Beyond the standard single-season DVD box sets, limited edition collector&#x27;s editions have been released, featuring all six seasons in one complete set. These editions differ by region. In Europe, a special &quot;shoebox&quot; packaging was created as a nod to Carrie Bradshaw&#x27;s love for shoes, while the U.S. and Canada versions were packaged in a more traditional fold-out suede case and included an additional bonus DVD with special features. In Mexico and Oceania, the set was packaged in a beauty case.

Some European viewers encountered issues with the Region 2 edition of the season 1 DVD, as it was not converted to the PAL video format and remained in its original American NTSC format. This caused compatibility problems with certain European television sets and DVD players. However, all subsequent Region 2 DVD releases were properly transferred to PAL format using the original film prints, and season 1 has since been re-released in PAL.

Outside the U.S., &quot;Sex and the City&quot; boxed sets were released through Paramount Pictures, while in the U.S. and Canada, they were released by the program&#x27;s original broadcaster, HBO. In Australia, single editions were made available, with each disc sold separately. In South Korea, complete six-season special DVD shoebox sets were released. In Brazil, the first and fifth seasons were released on DVD Dual, while the remaining seasons were released in DVD box sets.

Selected episodes are also available as part of the &quot;Sex and the City Essentials&quot; DVD collection. This collection includes four separately packaged discs, each containing three selected episodes centered around a common theme:

* &quot;The Best of Lust&quot;: Features the episodes &quot;The Fuck Buddy,&quot; &quot;Running with Scissors,&quot; and &quot;The Turtle and the Hare&quot;.
* &quot;The Best of Mr. Big&quot;: Features the episodes &quot;Sex and the City,&quot; &quot;Ex and the City,&quot; and &quot;I Heart NY&quot;.
* &quot;The Best of Romance&quot;: Features the episodes &quot;Baby, Talk is Cheap,&quot; &quot;Hop, Skip and a Week,&quot; and &quot;An American Girl in Paris (Part Deux)&quot;.

* &quot;The Best of Fashion&quot;: Features the episodes &quot;Secret Sex,&quot; &quot;The Real Me,&quot; and &quot;Luck Be an Old Lady&quot;. This DVD was exclusively released at Target stores in the U.S. and was the only DVD in the &quot;Essentials&quot; collection to have a colored cover instead of the standard black-and-white design.

The high-definition remastered series, including the two films, was released on Blu-ray on November 2, 2021.

==Films==

===&quot;Sex and the City&quot; (2008)===

A feature film based on &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, written, produced, and directed by Michael Patrick King, was released in May 2008. The four lead actresses reprised their roles, along with Chris Noth, Evan Handler, David Eigenberg, Jason Lewis, Mario Cantone, and Willie Garson. Additionally, Jennifer Hudson joined the cast as Carrie&#x27;s assistant. The film is set four years after the series finale. The film received mixed reviews from critics but emerged as a commercial success at the box-office, becoming the highest-grossing romantic comedy of the year. It was released on DVD on September 23, 2008.

===&quot;Sex and the City 2&quot; (2010)===

&quot;Sex and the City 2&quot; was released in May 2010. The film stars Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, Kristin Davis, Kim Cattrall, and Chris Noth, all reprising their roles, along with Evan Handler, David Eigenberg, Jason Lewis, Mario Cantone, and Willie Garson. The film also features cameos from Liza Minnelli, Miley Cyrus, and Penélope Cruz. Set two years after the events of the first film, it was critically panned, but proved to be a commercial success at the box-office.

=== Canceled third film ===
In 2016, rumors circulated that a script for the third and final film had been approved. However, on September 28, 2017, Sarah Jessica Parker announced to &quot;Extra&quot; that the film had been cancelled, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m disappointed. We had this beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story. It&#x27;s not just disappointing that we don&#x27;t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie.&quot; It was reported that Kim Cattrall did not want to be involved in the film after learning of storylines where Mr. Big dies of a heart attack and Samantha receives sexting and nude pictures from Miranda&#x27;s teenage son Brady. Cattrall later clarified in 2019 that she opted not to appear in a third film, explaining she had &quot;gone past the finish line&quot; portraying the character of Samantha and due to her love for the franchise.

The third movie plot was later reimagined as the 2021 television series &quot;And Just Like That…,&quot; with Cattrall not returning. Originally billed as a miniseries, it was renewed for a second season, with Cattrall reprising her role in a brief cameo in the season finale.

==Franchise==
===Prequel series===
&quot;The Carrie Diaries&quot; is a prequel to the original series, based on the book of the same name by Candace Bushnell. The series premiered on The CW on January 14, 2013, with AnnaSophia Robb portraying a young Carrie Bradshaw. On May 8, 2014, The CW cancelled &quot;The Carrie Diaries&quot; after two seasons.

===Adaptations===
The Brazilian television series &quot;Sexo e as Negas&quot; was adapted from the original &quot;Sex and the City&quot; series and premiered on September 16, 2014. This version introduced some notable differences: the four main characters were portrayed by black actresses, and the show was set in the suburbs.

===&quot;And Just Like That...&quot;===

In December 2020, it was reported that the cancelled third movie plot was redeveloped into a television series for HBO Max, without Kim Cattrall&#x27;s character returning. In January 2021, the revival, titled &quot;And Just Like That...&quot;, was officially confirmed by HBO Max, with Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, and Kristin Davis returning.

Originally billed as a limited series, &quot;And Just Like That...&quot; was renewed for a second season in March 2022, during which Cattrall reprised her role in a cameo for the season finale. In August 2023, the series was renewed for a third season. The show is expected to return in 2025.

== Cultural impact on fashion and brands ==
&quot;Sex and the City&quot; had a profound influence on luxury fashion, popularizing high-end items and brands among mainstream audiences. The series is credited with transforming luxury accessories, turning them into cultural icons through frequent on-screen appearances and clever character integration. For instance, the Hermès Birkin bag became a symbol of exclusivity and status after an episode in which Samantha Jones famously exclaims, “It’s not a bag, it’s a Birkin.” This moment highlighted the bag’s luxury status and introduced it to a new audience.

Other luxury items gained similar status due to their association with the show. Manolo Blahnik shoes, which Carrie Bradshaw famously adored, became synonymous with elegance and self-expression. Likewise, the Fendi Baguette bag was catapulted to &quot;it bag&quot; status after Carrie sported it, making the item a must-have for fashion enthusiasts. The show also prominently featured Jimmy Choo and the Dior Saddle Bag, further elevating their presence in pop culture and reinforcing the perception of luxury brands as aspirational items.

<doc id="82846" wikidata="Q16933131" url="?curid=82846" title="Melite (naiad)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Melite (; Ancient Greek: Μελίτη) was one of the Naiads, daughter of the river god Aegaeus, and one of the many loves of Zeus and his son Heracles. Given the choice, she chose Heracles over Zeus who went off in search of other pursuits. She gave birth to Hercules&#x27;s son Hyllus; some suggest that he was a figure distinct from Hyllus, the son of Heracles by Deianeira.

== Mythology ==
Heracles tried to find refuge on the mythical island of Scheria, widely considered to be the island of Corfu in modern Greece, after the murder of his children. He decided to rest near a lake. This lake happened to be the place in which Melite and her sisters were currently residing. When Melite saw Hercules she hid him away from her siblings in a deeper and darker part of the lake where she lay with him. The two then traveled to another part of the island and stayed there until Melite gave birth to Hyllus.

Zeus was in a rage over her choice of a mortal over him, and so he appealed to her father who would not let her have anymore children with Hercules or any sexual contact whatsoever. Hercules promptly left Melite for other mortals. She was one of the women who were there mourning the death of Hercules.

Hyllus did not want to be a mere subject to King Nausithous, so he traveled to the far north of Greece, where he became king and eponym of a Dorian tribe, the Hylleis.

<text>George Campbell Scott (October 18, 1927 – September 22, 1999) was an American actor, director and producer. He had a celebrated career on both stage and screen. With a gruff demeanor and commanding presence, Scott became known for his portrayal of stern but complex authority figures.

Described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;a battler and an actor of rare courage&quot;, his roles earned him numerous accolades including two Golden Globes, and two Primetime Emmys as well as nominations for two BAFTA Awards and five Tony Awards. Though he won the Academy Award for Best Actor for playing General George S. Patton in &quot;Patton&quot; (1970), he became the first actor to decline the award, having warned the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences months in advance that he would do so on the basis of his belief that performances cannot be compared to others. His other Oscar-nominated roles include &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; (1959), &quot;The Hustler&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Hospital&quot; (1971).

Scott&#x27;s other notable films include &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964), &quot;Petulia&quot; (1968), &quot;The Day of the Dolphin&quot; (1973), &quot;Movie Movie&quot; (1978), &quot;Hardcore&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Exorcist III&quot; (1990).

Scott gained fame for his roles on television earning two Primetime Emmy Awards for his performances in &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; (1971), and &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1997). He also played leading roles in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1970), &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1976), and &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1984). Scott continued to maintain a prominent stage career even as his film stardom waned, and by the end of his career he had accrued five Tony nominations for his performances in &quot;Comes a Day&quot; (1959), &quot;The Andersonville Trial&quot; (1960), &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (1974), &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; (1975), and &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;. He directed several of his own films and plays and often collaborated with his wives Colleen Dewhurst and Trish Van Devere.

==Early life and education ==
George Campbell Scott was born on a kitchen table October 18, 1927—the younger of two siblings—in the modest Wise, Virginia, home of his parents, Gerald Dewey Scott (1902–1988) and Helena Agnes (née Slemp; 1904–1935). His mother was the first cousin, once removed, of Republican Congressman C. Bascom Slemp. His maternal grandfather was a local jurist, Judge Campbell Slemp. Scott&#x27;s mother died just before his eighth birthday, and he was raised by his father, an executive at Buick. Scott&#x27;s original ambition was to be a writer like his favorite author, F. Scott Fitzgerald. While attending Redford High School in Detroit, he wrote many short stories, none of which were published. He tried on many occasions to write a novel, but never completed one to his own satisfaction. 

After high school, Scott enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, serving from 1945 to 1949. He was assigned to 8th and I Barracks in Washington, D.C., and his primary duty was serving as honor guard at military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery. He later said that during his duty at Arlington, &quot;[I] pick[ed] up a solid drinking habit that stayed with me from then on.&quot;

Following military service, Scott enrolled at the University of Missouri on the G.I. Bill where he majored in journalism and then became interested in drama. His first public appearance on stage was as the barrister in a university production of Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot;, directed by H. Donovan Rhynsburger. During rehearsals for that show, he made his first stage appearance—in a student production of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Hands Across the Sea&quot;, directed by Jerry V. Tobias. He graduated from the university in 1953 with degrees in English and theater.

== Career ==
===1958–1962: Early roles ===

Scott first rose to prominence for his work with Joseph Papp&#x27;s New York Shakespeare Festival. In 1958, he won an Obie Award for his performances in &quot;Children of Darkness&quot; (in which he made the first of many appearances opposite his future wife, actress Colleen Dewhurst), for &quot;As You Like It&quot; (1958), and for playing the title character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; (1957–58) (a performance one critic said was the &quot;angriest&quot; Richard III of all time).

Scott&#x27;s Broadway debut was in &quot;Comes a Day&quot; (1958) which had a short run. Scott&#x27;s television debut was in a 1958 adaptation of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; for the &quot;Dupont Show of the Month&quot; directed by Robert Mulligan. He also appeared in a televised version of &quot;The Outcasts of Poker Flat&quot; (1958) plus episodes of &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot;, and &quot;Omnibus&quot;. Scott&#x27;s feature film debut was in &quot;The Hanging Tree&quot; (1959), starring Gary Cooper and Maria Schell.
Scott earned his first Academy Award nomination for his performance in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; (1959). Later that year he appeared on Broadway in &quot;The Andersonville Trial&quot; by Saul Levitt directed by Jose Ferrer, winning critical acclaim for his portrayal of the prosecutor. This was based on the military trial of the commandant of the infamous Civil War prison camp in Andersonville, Georgia. It ran for 179 performances from December 1959 to June 1960.

Scott received good reviews for &quot;The Wall&quot; (1960–61) which ran for 167 performances. He guest-starred on episodes of &quot;Sunday Showcase&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Play of the Week&quot; (doing &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot;), &quot;Dow Hour of Great Mysteries&quot;, and a &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; production of &quot;Winterset&quot;, originally written for the stage. Scott received superb notices for his performance in &quot;The Hustler&quot; (1961). He returned to Broadway to direct &quot;General Seeger&quot; (1962) by Ira Levin but it only lasted two performances. The play &quot;Great Day in the Morning&quot; (1962), in which he was directed by José Quintero, also had only a brief run.

Scott was in much demand for guest shots on TV shows, appearing in episodes of &quot;Ben Casey&quot; and &quot;Naked City&quot;. In 1962, Scott appeared as school teacher Arthur Lilly on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Virginian&quot;, in the episode &quot;The Brazen Bell&quot;, in which he recites Oscar Wilde&#x27;s poem &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot;. That same year, he appeared in NBC&#x27;s medical drama &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, in the episode &quot;I Don&#x27;t Belong in a White-Painted House&quot;. He appeared opposite Laurence Olivier and Julie Harris in Graham Greene&#x27;s &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; in a 1961 television production and also performed in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (1962) off-Broadway.

===1963–1969: Breakthrough ===
Scott&#x27;s first leading role in a feature was &quot;The List of Adrian Messenger&quot; released in 1963. That year, Scott starred in the hour-long television drama series &quot;East Side/West Side.&quot; He portrayed a New York City social worker, along with co-stars Cicely Tyson and Elizabeth Wilson. Scott was a major creative influence on the show, resulting in conflicts with James T. Aubrey, the head of CBS. The Emmy Award-winning program had a series of guest stars, including James Earl Jones. The portrayal of challenging urban issues made attracting advertisers difficult, not helped by the limited distribution. Not all CBS network affiliates broadcast the show, and it was canceled after one season. Scott had a success during 1963 in an off-Broadway production of &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot;.
Scott&#x27;s highest-profile early role was in the Stanley Kubrick–directed &quot;Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot; (1964), in which he played General &quot;Buck&quot; Turgidson. In later interviews with Kubrick, Scott was revealed to have initially refused to camp it up on camera. As a compromise, Kubrick had Scott go over the top in rehearsal, assuring Scott that the cameras were off, which was untrue. Somehow, Scott was unable to hear the very loud motor on the 35mm film cameras of the time. Kubrick proceeded to use this version in the final cut, which Scott supposedly resented. Scott was one of many stars in &quot;The Yellow Rolls-Royce&quot; (1964).

Scott was cast, under the direction of John Huston in Dino de Laurentiis&#x27;s &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning&quot;, which was released by 20th Century Fox in 1966. Also in 1966, Scott appeared as Jud Barker in the NBC western &quot;The Road West&quot; (also known as &quot;This Savage Land&quot;), starring Barry Sullivan, Kathryn Hays, Andrew Prine, and Glenn Corbett. He also guest starred in &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;. He co-starred with Tony Curtis in the comedy film &quot;Not with My Wife, You Don&#x27;t!&quot; (also 1966) and as John Proctor in a television version of &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1967).

Scott returned to Broadway in 1967 to direct &quot;Dr. Cook&#x27;s Garden&quot; by Ira Levin but quit during tryouts. As an actor, he appeared in a revival of &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; (1967–1968) directed by Mike Nichols, which ran for 100 performances. Scott starred in &quot;The Flim-Flam Man&quot; (1967) and &quot;Petulia&quot; (1968). He appeared in the television film &quot;Mirror, Mirror Off the Wall&quot; (1969).

===1970–1979: Established star ===
Scott played George S. Patton in the film &quot;Patton&quot; (1970) and researched extensively for the role, studying films of the general and talking to those who knew him. Scott declined the Oscar nomination for &quot;Patton&quot;, just as he had done for his nomination in 1962 for &quot;The Hustler&quot;, but won the award anyway.

In a letter to the Motion Picture Academy, he stated that he did not feel himself to be in competition with other actors. However, regarding this second rejection of the Academy Award, Scott famously said elsewhere, &quot;The whole thing is a goddamn meat parade. I don&#x27;t want any part of it.&quot; The Best Picture Oscar for &quot;Patton&quot; was given to the George C. Marshall Foundation Library at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia, the same institution that generations of Pattons attended, by producer Frank McCarthy a few weeks after the awards ceremony, and is on display there. Scott accepted the New York Film Critics Award. His then-wife Colleen Dewhurst said, &quot;George thinks this is the only film award worth having&quot;.

During the early 1970s, Scott appeared in the made-for-television films &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1970) as Mr. Rochester and &quot;The Price&quot; (1971), a version of the Arthur Miller play. For the latter role, he won an Emmy Award, which he accepted. He also directed a TV version of &quot;The Andersonville Trial&quot; (1970). Scott then returned his focus to feature films. He appeared in &quot;They Might Be Giants&quot; (1971) with Joanne Woodward, and &quot;The Last Run&quot; (1971) for director Richard Fleischer, with his wife Colleen Dewhurst and also with Trish Van Devere, who would become his fourth and last wife. Scott had a big hit with &quot;&quot; (1971) based on a script by Paddy Chayefksy; and &quot;The New Centurions&quot; (1972) directed by Flesicher based on a book by Joseph Wambaugh.

Scott then appeared in a series of box office flops, beginning with &quot;Rage&quot; (1972), which he both directed and starred in. He then appeared in &quot;Oklahoma Crude&quot; (1973) directed by Stanley Kramer; &quot;The Day of the Dolphin&quot; (1973) directed by Mike Nichols, in which Scott appeared with Van Devere; &quot;Bank Shot&quot; (1974), directed by Gower Champion; and &quot;The Savage Is Loose&quot; (1974), which co-starred Van Devere and which Scott himself directed. Scott returned to television with &quot;Fear on Trial&quot; (1975); and starred in the disaster film &quot;The Hindenburg&quot; (1975) for director Robert Wise.

Scott had a big Broadway hit with Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; (1968), directed by Mike Nichols. The show was composed of three separate one-act plays all using the same set, with Scott portraying a different lead character in each act; it ran for 1,097 performances. Scott directed a production of &quot;All God&#x27;s Chillun Got Wings&quot; (1975) which starred Van Devere and only had a short run. He directed and played Willy Loman in a 1975 revival of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, for which he garnered another Tony nomination. Scott received a Tony Award nomination for his performance as Astrov in a 1973 revival of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, directed by Nichols, which ran for 64 performances. Scott starred in a well-received production of Larry Gelbart&#x27;s &quot;Sly Fox&quot; (1976; based on Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Volpone&quot;), which ran 495 performances. 

Scott appeared in a television production of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1976), with Trish Van Devere. He later starred as an Ernest Hemingway-based artist in &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; (1977) directed by Schaffner and based on Hemingway&#x27;s posthumously published novel. He had a cameo in &quot;Crossed Swords&quot; (1977) directed by Fleischer, then had the lead in &quot;Movie Movie&quot; (1978) directed by Stanley Donen, costarring with Van Devere, and &quot;Hardcore&quot; (1979) written and directed by Paul Schrader.

===1980–1989===
Scott starred in &quot;The Changeling&quot; (1980), with Melvyn Douglas, John Colicos, Jean Marsh, and Van Devere, for which he received the Canadian Genie Award for Best Foreign Film Actor for his performance. He followed this with &quot;The Formula&quot; (1980) co-starring Marlon Brando, which was a flop. With one exception, it was the last time he had the lead in a major studio feature film. Scott returned to Broadway for &quot;Tricks of the Trade&quot; in 1980 with Van Devere, but it ran for a single performance. 

Scott appeared alongside Timothy Hutton and rising stars Sean Penn and Tom Cruise in the coming-of-age film &quot;Taps&quot; (1981), and was cast as Fagin in the CBS made-for-TV adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1982). On Broadway, he starred in and directed a successful revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Present Laughter&quot; which ran during 1982–83. He starred in &quot;China Rose&quot; (1983) on television, and in 1984, had a supporting role in &quot;Firestarter&quot; and portrayed Ebenezer Scrooge in a television adaptation of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. He directed the 1984 Broadway revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Design for Living&quot;, which ran for 245 performances. In 1986, on Broadway, Scott did &quot;The Boys in Autumn&quot; in 1986. In 1993, he appeared off-Broadway successfully with &quot;Wrong Turn at Lungfish&quot;. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for the role. Scott played the title role in the television film &quot;&quot; (1985).

Scott reprised his role as Patton in a made-for-television sequel, &quot;The Last Days of Patton&quot; (1986). Based on the final weeks of Patton&#x27;s life after being mortally injured in a car accident, it contains flashbacks of Patton&#x27;s life. At the time the sequel was aired, Scott mentioned in a TV Guide interview that he told the academy to donate his Oscar to the Patton Museum, but since the instructions were never put in writing, it was never delivered.

On television, Scott appeared in &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; (1986) and &quot;Pals&quot; (1987; with Don Ameche). He also played the lead role in the TV series &quot;Mr. President&quot; (1987–88), and appeared on &quot;The Johnny Carson Show&quot; in March 1987. Scott starred in the television film &quot;The Ryan White Story&quot; (1989) as Charles Vaughan, the lawyer defending Ryan White.

===1990–1999===
In 1990, he voiced two villainous roles: Smoke in the television special &quot;Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue&quot; and Percival McLeach in the Disney film &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot;. He was featured in &quot;The Exorcist III&quot; (1990). For TV, he starred in &quot;Descending Angel&quot; (also 1990) and &quot;Finding the Way Home&quot; (1991). On Broadway, he directed and appeared in a revival of &quot;On Borrowed Time&quot; (1991–92). He had a supporting role in &quot;Curacao&quot; (1993) and &quot;Malice&quot; (1993). Scott had a starring role in &quot;Traps&quot; (1994) but the series only ran for five episodes. He also had a semi-regular role on another short-lived series &quot;New York News&quot; (1995). Around this time, Scott appeared in such feature films as &quot;The Whipping Boy&quot; (1994), &quot;Tyson&quot; (1995), and &quot;Angus&quot; (1995). Scott received another Tony nomination for his performance as Henry Drummond in a revival of &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1996). In the latter play, he had to miss many performances due to illness, with his role being taken over by National Actors Theatre artistic director Tony Randall. In 1996, he received an honorary Drama Desk Award for a lifetime devotion to theatre.

On the small screen, Scott appeared in &quot;Country Justice&quot; (1996), &quot;Titanic&quot; (1996) (as the ship&#x27;s captain), and &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1996). Scott portrayed Juror No. 3 in the television film &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1997), the role played by Lee J. Cobb in the 1957 film, for which he would win another Emmy Award. He hosted &quot;Weapons at War&quot; on A&amp;E TV, but was replaced after one season by Gerald McRaney. &quot;Weapons at War&quot; moved to The History Channel with Scott still credited as host for the first season. Scott was replaced by Robert Conrad after his death in 1999. He had support roles in &quot;Gloria&quot; (1999) for Sidney Lumet and &quot;Rocky Marciano&quot; (1999). Scott made his last film, the television film &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1999), portraying Matthew Harrison Brady (ironically opposite the role he had played on stage) with Jack Lemmon as Henry Drummond, with whom he had also worked in &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;. Scott had a reputation for being moody and mercurial while on the set. &quot;There is no question you get pumped up by the recognition ... Then a self-loathing sets in when you realize you&#x27;re enjoying it&quot;, he was quoted as saying. One anecdote relates that one of his stage co-stars, Maureen Stapleton, told the director of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Plaza Suite,&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to do – I&#x27;m scared of him.&quot; The director, Mike Nichols, replied, &quot;My dear, everyone is scared of George C. Scott.&quot;

==Personal life==

Scott was married five times:
# Carolyn Hughes (m. 1951–1955); one daughter, Victoria (b. December 19, 1952).

They remained married until his death in 1999.

He had a daughter, Michelle (b. 1954), with Karen Truesdell.

===Politics===
In 1982, Scott appeared in a campaign commercial for moderate Republican U.S. Senator Lowell Weicker of Connecticut. Like Weicker, Scott was, at that time, a resident of Greenwich, Connecticut. Scott identified politically as a moderate conservative and supported the death penalty.

Scott suffered a series of heart attacks in the 1980s. He died on September 22, 1999, aged 71, of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. He was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, California.

<text>The piccolo ( ; ) is a smaller version of the western concert flute and a member of the woodwind family of musical instruments. Sometimes referred to as a &quot;baby flute&quot; or piccolo flute, the modern piccolo has the same type of fingerings as the standard transverse flute, but the sound it produces is an octave higher. This has given rise to the name ottavino (), by which the instrument is called in Italian and thus also in scores of Italian composers.
Piccolos are often orchestrated to double the violins or the flutes, adding sparkle and brilliance to the overall sound because of the aforementioned one-octave transposition upwards. The piccolo is a standard member in orchestras, marching bands, and wind ensembles.

== History ==
Since the Middle Ages, evidence indicates the use of octave transverse flutes as military instruments, as their penetrating sound was audible above battles. In cultured music, however, the first piccolos were used in some of Jean Philippe Rameau&#x27;s works in the first half of the 18th century. Still, the instrument began to spread, and therefore to have a stable place in the orchestra, only at the beginning of 1800 A.D. During the Baroque period, the indication &quot;flautino&quot; or also &quot;flauto piccolo&quot; usually denoted a recorder of small size (soprano or sopranino). In particular, this is the case of the concertos that Antonio Vivaldi wrote for &quot;flautino&quot;.

Until the end of the 19th century, the piccolo maintained the same construction. Historically, the piccolo had the same keys of the baroque flute (one key) and then of the classical and romantic simple system flute. At the end of the century, the piccolo began to be built with the Boehm mechanism, which would become the standard during the 1900s. However, it cannot wholly transition to the Boehm system since the bore has remained conical, as in the old system flute, and the first bottom note is D, like in the baroque flute. The piccolo should not be confused with the fife, which is traditionally one-piece, has a smaller, cylindrical bore, and produces a more strident sound.

== Traditional use ==
It is a myth that one of the earliest pieces to use the piccolo was Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 in C Minor, which premiered in December 1808. Although neither Joseph Haydn nor Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart used it in their symphonies, some of their contemporaries did, including Franz Anton Hoffmeister, Franz Xaver Süssmayr, and Michael Haydn. Also, Mozart used the piccolo in his opera &quot;Idomeneo&quot;. Opera orchestras in Paris sometimes included small transverse flutes at the octave as early as 1735 as existing scores by Jean-Philippe Rameau show.

Piccolos are now mainly manufactured in the key of C or D. In the early 20th century, piccolos were manufactured in D as they were an earlier model of the modern piccolo. For this D piccolo, John Philip Sousa wrote the famous solo in the final repeat of the closing section (trio) of his march &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;.

Although once made of wood, glass, or ivory, piccolos today are made from plastic, resin, brass, nickel silver, silver, and a variety of hardwoods, most commonly grenadilla. Finely made piccolos are often available with a variety of options similar to the flute, such as the split-E mechanism. Most piccolos have a conical body with a cylindrical head, like the Baroque flute and later flutes before the popularization of the Boehm bore used in modern flutes. Unlike other woodwind instruments, in most wooden piccolos, the tenon joint that connects the head to the body has two interference fit points surrounding the cork and metal side of the piccolo body joint.

The piccolo is used alongside marching drums in traditional formations at the Carnival of Basel, Switzerland.

In 2014, a festival was born entirely dedicated to the piccolo, the International Piccolo Festival, which takes place annually in July in Grado, Italy.

== Repertoire ==
There are a number of pieces for piccolo alone by such composers as Samuel Adler, Miguel del Aguila, Robert Dick, Michael Isaacson, David Loeb, Stephen Hough, Polly Moller, Vincent Persichetti, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Brian Ferneyhough. 

Repertoire for piccolo and piano, many of which are sonatas, has been composed by Miguel del Águila, Robert Baksa, Robert Beaser, Rob du Bois, Howard J. Buss, , Pierre Max Dubois, Raymond Guiot, Lowell Liebermann, Peter Schickele, Michael Daugherty, and Gary Schocker.

Concertos have been composed for piccolo, including those by Lowell Liebermann, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Todd Goodman, Martin Amlin, Will Gay Bottje, Bruce Broughton, Valentino Bucchi, Avner Dorman, Jean Doué, Michael Easton, Egil Hovland, Guus Janssen, Daniel Pinkham, Jeff Manookian and Levente Gyöngyösi.
Additionally, there is now a selection of chamber music that uses the piccolo. One example is Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Zungenspitzentanz&quot;, for piccolo and two euphoniums (or one synthesizer), with an optional percussionist and dancer. Another is George Crumb&#x27;s Madrigals, Book II for soprano, flute (doubling piccolo/alto flute), and percussion. Other examples include a trio for piccolo, contrabassoon, and piano, &#x27;Was mit den Tränen geschieht&#x27; by Stephen Hough, the Quintet for Piccolo and String Quartet by Graham Waterhouse, and &quot;Malambo&quot; for piccolo, double bass, and piano by Miguel del Aguila. Currently published trios for three piccolos include &quot;Quelque Chose canadienne&quot; (Something Canadian) by Nancy Nourse and &quot;Bird Tango&quot; by Crt Sojar Voglar for three piccolos with piano. &quot;Petrushka&#x27;s Ghost&quot; for eight piccolos by Melvin Lauf, Jr. and &quot;Una piccolo sinfonia&quot; for nine piccolos by Matthew King are two more examples.

<text>In Greek mythology, Oreads (; ) or Orestiads (; ) are mountain nymphs. Myths associated the Oreads with Artemis, since the goddess, when she went out hunting, preferred mountains and rocky precipices.

The generic term &quot;oread&quot; itself appears to be Hellenistic (first attested in the &quot;Epitaph of Adonis&quot; () of Bion of Smyrna, ) .

<text>Melitta () is a German company selling coffee, paper coffee filters, and coffee makers, part of the Melitta Group, which has branches in other countries. The company is headquartered in Minden, North Rhine-Westphalia.

It is named after Melitta Bentz (1873–1950) who founded the company after she invented the drip brew paper coffee filter (German patent granted 8 July 1908). Bentz later ran the company as a family business.

==History==

In 1908, Melitta Bentz, a 35-year-old woman from Dresden, Germany, invented the first coffee filter, receiving a patent registration for her &quot;Filter Top Device lined with Filter Paper&quot; from the Patent Office in Berlin on 8 July. She founded the company bearing her name the same year.

In the 1930s, Melitta revised the original filter, tapering it into the shape of a cone and adding ribs. This created a larger filtration area, allowing for improved extraction of the ground coffee. In 1936, the widely recognized cone-shaped filter paper that fit inside the tapered filter top was introduced. The &#x27;102&#x27; became the most popular.

Between 1941 and 1945, the Concordia Porzellanfabrik was used by Melitta. In 1951/1952 and 1957/1958, the Porta-Keramikwerke J. Brauers in Barkhausen at Porta Westfalica, Germany produced ceramic filters for Melitta. once also produced porcelain filters for Melitta. The Porzellanfabrik Friesland, founded in 1953 as part of the German Melitta group, and independent since 1991/1995, produced Melitta porcelain filters up to 2018. Since then, they continue to sell these filters under their own Friesland label, whereas Melitta itself switched to produce these filters in China.

Melitta continued to develop new techniques to improve the shape, performance, material and production process of its filter systems. In 1989, Natural Brown coffee filters made from unbleached pulp were introduced, which kept unwanted by-products from leaching into the environment. In 1992 Melitta developed an oxygen-bleaching process to produce white paper without chlorine. 

In 1996, the Miele Group established the Dongguan factory as a joint venture with Melitta, which became fully owned by Miele in 2009.

In 1997, Melitta developed a filter with Flavor Pores, microfine perforations that filter out unwanted sediment, particles and oils. In 2002 Melitta added a second safety crimp to increase strength and durability. In 2007 bamboo Filters were introduced and the Flavor Pores filter was improved.

 Melitta Group KG employed 3,300 people.

In the 2019 financial year, the group&#x27;s turnover increased by 10 percent to almost 1.7 billion euros. The number of employees grew to 5654.

In April 2020, Melitta announced that the company would be manufacturing nose and face masks as part of the COVID-19 pandemic. The masks consist of a three-layer fleece and are produced worldwide. Melitta donates the first million masks to healthcare facilities.

==Melitta USA==
Melitta USA, headquartered in Clearwater, Florida, is part of the privately held Melitta Group of Minden, Germany. Melitta USA is responsible for the sales and marketing of Melitta coffee filters, coffee, and non electric coffee systems in the USA.

Melitta USA&#x27;s coffee filters are manufactured in Clearwater, Florida, and the company has a coffee roasting operation in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. The company Web site said in 2018 that it had been roasting coffee in Cherry Hill for more than 50 years.

<text>The Mars Observer spacecraft, also known as the Mars Geoscience/Climatology Orbiter, was a robotic space probe launched by NASA on September 25, 1992, to study the Martian surface, atmosphere, climate and magnetic field. On August 21, 1993, during the interplanetary cruise phase, communication with the spacecraft was lost, three days prior to the probe&#x27;s orbital insertion. Attempts to re-establish communications with the spacecraft were unsuccessful.

== Mission background ==

=== History ===
In 1984, a high priority mission to Mars was set forth by the Solar System Exploration Committee. Then titled the &quot;Mars Geoscience/Climatology Orbiter&quot;, the Martian orbiter was planned to expand on the information already gathered by the Viking program. Preliminary mission goals expected the probe to provide planetary magnetic field data, detection of certain spectral line signatures of minerals on the surface, images of the surface at 1 meter/pixel and global elevation data.

&quot;Mars Observer&quot; was originally planned to be launched in 1990 by a Space Shuttle Orbiter. The possibility for an expendable rocket to be used was also suggested, if the spacecraft was designed to meet certain constraints. On March 12, 1987, the mission was rescheduled for launch in 1992, in lieu of other backlogged missions (&quot;Galileo&quot;, Magellan, &quot;Ulysses&quot;) after the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. Along with a launch delay, budget overruns necessitated the elimination of two instruments to meet the 1992 planned launch. As the development matured, the primary science objectives were finalized as:
*Determine the global elemental and mineralogical character of the surface material.
*Define globally the topography and gravitational field.
*Establish the nature of the Martian magnetic field.
*Determine the temporal and spatial distribution, abundance, sources, and sinks of volatiles and dust over a seasonal cycle.
*Explore the structure and circulation of the atmosphere.

The program&#x27;s total cost is estimated at $813 million.

=== Spacecraft design ===

The &quot;Mars Observer&quot; spacecraft had a mass of . Its bus measured 1.1 meters tall, 2.2 meters wide, and 1.6 meters deep. The spacecraft was based on previous satellite designs, originally intended and developed to orbit Earth. The RCA AS-4000 Ku-band satellite design was used extensively for the spacecraft bus, propulsion, thermal protection, and solar array. RCA TIROS and DMSP Block 50-2 satellite designs were also utilized in the implementing the Attitude and Articulation Control System (AACS), command and data handling subsystem, and power subsystem, into &quot;Mars Observer&quot;. Other elements such as the bipropellant components and high-gain antenna were designed specifically for the mission.

==== Attitude control and propulsion ====
:The spacecraft was three-axis stabilized with four reaction wheels and twenty-four thrusters with 1,346 kilograms of propellant. The propulsion system was a high thrust, monomethyl hydrazine/nitrogen tetroxide bipropellant system for larger maneuvers and a lower thrust hydrazine monopropellant system for minor orbital corrections during the mission. Of the bipropellant thrusters, four located on the aft, provide 490 newtons of thrust for course corrections, control of the spacecraft during the Mars orbital insertion maneuver and large orbit corrections during the mission; another four, located on along the sides of the spacecraft, provide 22 newtons for controlling roll maneuvers. Of the hydrazine thrusters, eight provide 4.5 newtons to control orbit trim maneuvers; another eight provide 0.9 newtons for offsetting, or &quot;desaturating&quot;, the reaction wheels. To determine the orientation of the spacecraft, a horizon sensor, a 6-slit star scanner, and five Sun sensors were included.

==== Communications ====

:For telecommunications, the spacecraft included a two-axis gimbaled 1.5 meter, parabolic high-gain antenna, mounted to a 6 meter boom to communicate with the Deep Space Network across the X-band using two GFP NASA X-band transponders (NXTs) and two GFP command detector units (CDUs). An assembly of six low-gain antennas, and a single medium-gain antenna were also included, to be used during the cruise phase while the high-gain antenna remained stowed, and for contingency measures should communications through the high-gain antenna become restricted. When broadcasting to the Deep Space Network, a maximum of 10.66 kilobytes/second could be achieved while the spacecraft could receive commands at a maximum bandwidth of 62.5 bytes per second.

==== Power ====
:Power was supplied to the spacecraft through a six-panel solar array, measuring 7.0 meters wide and 3.7 meters tall, and would provide an average of 1,147 watts when in orbit. To power the spacecraft while occluded from the Sun, two 42 A·h nickel-cadmium batteries were included; the batteries would recharge as the solar array received sunlight.

==== Computer ====
:The computing system on the spacecraft was a retooling of the system used on the TIROS and DMSP satellites. The semiautonomous system was able to store up to 2,000 commands in the included 64 kilobytes of random-access memory, and execute them at a maximum rate of 12.5 commands/second; commands could also provide sufficient autonomous operation of the spacecraft for up to sixty days. To record data, redundant digital tape recorders (DTR) were included and each capable of storing up to 187.5 megabytes, for later playback to the Deep Space Network.

==== Scientific instruments ====


== Mission profile ==
=== Launch and trajectory ===
&quot;Mars Observer&quot; was launched on September 25, 1992, at 17:05:01 UTC by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from Space Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, aboard a Commercial Titan III CT-4 launch vehicle. The complete burn sequence lasted for 34 minutes after a solid-fuel Transfer Orbit Stage placed the spacecraft into an 11-month, Mars transfer trajectory, at a final speed of 5.28 km/s with respect to Mars.

On August 25, 1992, particulate contamination was found within the spacecraft. After a full inspection, a cleaning was determined necessary and was performed on August 29. The suspected cause of the contamination were measures taken to protect the spacecraft prior to the landfall of Hurricane Andrew which struck the coast of Florida on August 24.

=== Encounter with Mars ===
&quot;Mars Observer&quot; was scheduled to perform an orbital insertion maneuver on August 24, 1993, but contact with the spacecraft was lost on August 21, 1993. The likely reason for the spacecraft failure was the leakage of fuel and oxidizer vapors through the improperly designed PTFE check valve to the common pressurization system. During interplanetary cruise, the vapor mix had accumulated in feed lines and pressurant lines, resulting in explosion and their rupture after the engine was restarted for routine course correction. A similar problem later crippled the Akatsuki space probe in 2010. Although none of the primary objectives were achieved, the mission provided interplanetary cruise phase data, collected up to the date of last contact. This data would be useful for subsequent missions to Mars. Science instruments originally developed for &quot;Mars Observer&quot; were placed on four subsequent spacecraft to complete the mission objectives: Mars Global Surveyor launched in 1996, Mars Climate Orbiter launched in 1998, 2001 Mars Odyssey launched in 2001 and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter launched in 2005.

==== Intended operations ====

On August 24, 1993, &quot;Mars Observer&quot; would turn 180 degrees and ignite the bipropellant thrusters to slow the spacecraft, entering into a highly elliptical orbit. Over the next three months, subsequent &quot;transfer to lower orbit&quot; (TLO) maneuvers would be performed as the spacecraft reached periapsis, eventually resulting in an approximately circular, 118-minute orbit around Mars.

The primary mission was to begin on November 23, 1993, collecting data during one Martian year (approximately 687 Earth days). The first global map was expected to be completed on December 16, followed by solar conjunction beginning on December 20, and lasting for nineteen days, ending on January 3, 1994; during this time, mission operations would be suspended as radio contact would not be possible.

Orbiting Mars at an approximate speed of 3.4 km/s, the spacecraft would travel around Mars in a north to south, polar orbit. As the spacecraft circles the planet, horizon sensors indicate the orientation of the spacecraft while the reaction wheels would maintain the orientation of the instruments, towards Mars. The chosen orbit was also Sun-synchronous, allowing the daylit side of Mars to always be captured during the mid-afternoon of each Martian Sol. While some instruments could provide a real-time data link when Earth was in view of the spacecraft, data would also be recorded to the digital tape recorders and played back to Earth each day. Over 75 gigabytes of scientific data was expected to be yielded during the primary mission, much more than any previous mission to Mars. The end of the operable life for the spacecraft was expected to be limited by the supply of propellant and the condition of the batteries.
== Communications loss ==

On August 21, 1993, at 01:00 UTC, three days prior to the scheduled Mars orbital insertion, there was an &quot;inexplicable&quot; loss of contact with &quot;Mars Observer&quot;. New commands were sent every 20 minutes in the hopes that the spacecraft had drifted off course and could regain contact. However, the attempt was unsuccessful. It is unknown whether the spacecraft was able to follow its automatic programming and go into Mars orbit or if it flew by Mars and is now in a heliocentric orbit.

On January 4, 1994, an independent investigation board from the Naval Research Laboratory, announced their findings: the most probable cause in the loss of communication was a rupture of the fuel pressurization tank in the spacecraft&#x27;s propulsion system. It is believed that hypergolic fuel may have leaked past valves in the system during the cruise to Mars, allowing the fuel and oxidizer to combine prematurely before reaching the combustion chamber. The leaking fuel and gas probably resulted in a high spin rate, causing the spacecraft to enter into the &quot;contingency mode&quot;; this interrupted the stored command sequence and did not turn the transmitter on. The engine was derived from one belonging to an Earth orbital satellite and was not designed to lie dormant for months before being fired.

== Aftermath ==
The Mars Exploration Program was formed officially in the wake of the Mars Observer&#x27;s failure in September 1993. The goals of that program include identifying the location of water, and preparing for crewed missions to Mars.

<doc id="82859" wikidata="Q13213" url="?curid=82859" title="Hamal">
<text>Hamal , designated Alpha Arietis (α Arietis, abbreviated Alpha Ari, α Ari), is the brightest star in the northern zodiacal constellation of Aries.

With an apparent visual magnitude of 2.0, it is the mean 50th-brightest star in the night sky. Based upon parallax measurements made with the &quot;Hipparcos&quot; astrometry satellite, Hamal is about from Earth. It is a giant star that may host an orbiting planet with a mass greater than Jupiter.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;Alpha Arietis&quot; is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation. It also bears the Flamsteed designation of 13 Arietis.

The traditional name &quot;Hamal&quot; (also written &quot;Hemal&quot;, &quot;Hamul&quot;, &quot;Ras Hammel&quot;) derives from the Arabic &quot;rās al-ħamal&quot; &quot;head of the ram&quot;, in turn from the name for the constellation as a whole, &quot;Al Ħamal&quot; &quot;the ram&quot;. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Hamal&quot; for this star.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Bond (asterism)&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Hamal, β Arietis and γ Arietis. Consequently, the Chinese name for Hamal itself is (, ).

==Properties==
The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of , with the luminosity class of III indicating that it is an evolved giant star that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and is now on the red-giant branch. The &#x27;Ca-1&#x27; portion of the classification indicates that it shows weaker than normal lines of calcium in its spectrum. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. It is estimated to have 65% more mass than the Sun, while interferometric measurements using the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer show it to be 15 times larger in diameter. Despite its enlarged girth, this star is still spinning with a slightly faster equatorial azimuthal velocity than the Sun, having a projected rotational velocity of 3.44 km s−1.

Hamal is radiating about 91 times the Sun&#x27;s luminosity from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of . This is cooler than the surface of the Sun, giving it the orange-hued glow of a K-type star. It is suspected to be slightly variable, with an amplitude of 0.06 magnitude. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the star&#x27;s metallicity, is only around 60% that in the Sun.

== Planetary system ==
In 2011, the likely presence of a planet in orbit around this star was reported by Byeong-Cheol Lee, et al. It was detected using the radial velocity method, based upon measurements made between 2003 and 2010 at the Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory in Korea. The object has an orbital period of 381 days and an eccentricity of 0.25. The lower bound on this object&#x27;s mass is about 1.8 times the mass of Jupiter. The estimated semi-major axis of the planet&#x27;s orbit is 1.2 astronomical units (AU), which would give it a periapsis distance of 0.9 AU and an apoapsis distance of 1.5 AU. By comparison, the star has a radius of 0.07 AU.

==In culture==
Hamal&#x27;s orientation with relation to the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun gives it a certain importance not apparent from its modest brightness. Between 2000 and 100 BCE, the apparent path of the Sun through the Earth&#x27;s sky placed it in Aries at the northern vernal equinox, the point in time marking the start of spring in the Northern Hemisphere. This is why most astrology columns in modern newspapers begin with Aries. While the vernal equinox has moved to Pisces since then due to precession of the equinoxes, Hamal has remained in mind as a bright star near what was apparently an important place when people first studied the night sky. Currently (epoch J2000) its declination is almost exactly equal to the latitude of the Tropic of Cancer, meaning it can be used to find the position of that imaginary line when the Sun is not nearby.

The other name of Hamal, &quot;Hamul&quot;, was used for the name of a U.S. Navy ship, .

In 1953, fictional planet orbiting Alpha Arietis, named Lithia, appeared in A Case of Conscience, a classic science fiction novel by James Blish. The planet serves as the arena of the major part of the story, being a homeworld to a fictional sentient race, being studied by humans. Real-life equivalent of Lithia was unknown at the time of the novel&#x27;s creation.

<text>HBO World Championship Boxing (in later years stylized in its title card as HBO Boxing – World Championship) is an American sports television series on premium television network HBO. It premiered on January 22, 1973, with a fight that saw George Foreman defeat Joe Frazier in Kingston, Jamaica.

HBO&#x27;s pay-per-view distribution arm, TVKO was founded in December 1990, and then launched in April 1991 with Evander Holyfield vs. George Foreman, becoming HBO PPV in 2001.

On February 3, 1996, HBO debuted a spin-off program, &quot;Boxing After Dark&quot;, with the fight between Marco Antonio Barrera and Kennedy McKinney as its inaugural telecast.

On September 27, 2018, HBO announced they would be dropping boxing from the network following its last televised match on October 27, though two airings on November 24 and December 8 were its last editions. Various issues in the boxing business, including the influx of streaming options (such as DAZN and ESPN+) and issues with promoters and competing entities such as Premier Boxing Champions, along with declining ratings and loss of interest in the sport among HBO&#x27;s subscribers for other ring sports such as mixed martial arts and professional wrestling, made the continued carriage of the sport untenable. HBO&#x27;s long-term move to upscale dramatic programming, an ownership transfer of parent WarnerMedia to AT&amp;T, then Warner Bros. Discovery, where the company&#x27;s sport division became focused on TNT as TNT Sports, and re-focus around the upcoming streaming service HBO Max also played a role in the decision, with an HBO executive commenting that &quot;HBO is not a sports network&quot;. The network cancelled its last sports-related program, &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot;, at the end of 2023.

In March 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery revived the HBO Boxing brand as a free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) channel that are available on Tubi and Amazon Freevee, that showcases some boxing bouts that aired on &quot;World Championship Boxing&quot; and &quot;Boxing After Dark&quot;, as well as some boxing-related episodes of &quot;24/7&quot;.

A famous incident occurred on July 11, 1996, during the Riddick Bowe vs. Andrew Golota fight at Madison Square Garden, in which a confrontation between Golota and Bowe&#x27;s entourage after Golata&#x27;s disqualification for delivering low blows to Bowe, resulting a chaotic and violent brawl between the boxers&#x27; respective entourages and fans. During the fight, HBO&#x27;s commentary team had to evacuate their ringside position (with George Foreman helping to protect his fellow commentators after unsuccessfully attempting to put an end to the fighting; the commentators&#x27; table was destroyed in the brawl), resulting in several minutes of commentary-free coverage of the melee before Jim Lampley was able to resume coverage of the incident from several levels above. Larry Merchant and Foreman remained in the ring providing coverage as tempers continued to flare into punch-ups between spectators. The credits rolled over footage of NYPD officers entering MSG and beginning to make arrests.

&quot;World Championship Boxing&quot; has also had three spin-off series: &quot;Boxing After Dark&quot;; &quot;KO Nation&quot;; and &quot;MetroPCS Friday Night Knockout&quot;, a weekly broadcast co-produced with Turner Sports for sister cable network TruTV. multiplex Spanish-language channel HBO Latino aired two spin-off series &quot;Oscar De La Hoya Presenta Boxeo De Oro&quot; (focused on fighters from De La Hoya&#x27;s Golden Boy Promotions) and &quot;Generación Boxeo&quot;.

Additionally, a video game carrying the brand name &quot;HBO Boxing&quot; was released for the PlayStation in 2000, which was published by Acclaim Entertainment under their Acclaim Sports banner.

==Commentators ==
The main broadcast team was Jim Lampley on blow-by-blow, with former and future ESPN reporter Max Kellerman as color commentator, replacing Larry Merchant, who retired in December 2012. For the last two years of Merchant&#x27;s contract he and Kellerman alternated telecasts.

The analyst position was held (when he was available) by former multiple-division world champion Roy Jones, Jr. Andre Ward or Bernard Hopkins fill in when Jones was unavailable. The position used to be held by Sugar Ray Leonard and former world heavyweight champions George Foreman and Lennox Lewis, and most recently (until his death) by trainer Emanuel Steward.

For pay-per-view fights, Bob Costas and James Brown used to host the telecast while Lampley called the fight; however Lampley later did both.

Harold Lederman, a former boxing judge, served as &quot;unofficial scorer,&quot; giving his scorecards after every three rounds, sometimes two. Lederman also used to voice-over the rules under which the fight would be conducted before handing back to Lampley for pre-fight introductions; however the rules were later simply flashed on-screen to save time. Former judge Steve Weisfeld also appeared in this role, usually when Lederman&#x27;s daughter Julie was judging a fight and as such Harold could not be on television due to the conflict of interest.

Michael Buffer was an unofficial member of the team as ring announcer for most HBO fights. Even Showtime Championship Boxing ring announcer Jimmy Lennon Jr. subbed for Buffer occasionally and Buffer occasionally subbed for Lennon on Showtime boxing programming.

Chon Romero was one of the commentators for HBO Boxing&#x27;s Spanish telecasts.

Former commentators include: Marv Albert, Len Berman, Barry Tompkins, Fran Charles, Gil Clancy, Howard Cosell, Don Dunphy, Sugar Ray Leonard, Al Michaels, Jerry Quarry and Dick Stockton.

==International broadcasts==
Prior to 2009, TSN, a basic-cable sports channel in Canada, held the Canadian broadcast rights to most HBO boxing events, often airing them live (with ads inserted between rounds) if they did not conflict with other sports properties on the channel. From January 2009 to the series&#x27; end, &quot;HBO World Championship Boxing&quot;, and other HBO boxing events, aired live on HBO Canada with later repeats on TSN.

<text>Thasos or Thassos (, &quot;Thásos&quot;) is a Greek island in the North Aegean Sea. It is the northernmost major Greek island, and 12th largest by area. 

The island has an area of 380 km2 and a population of about 13,000. It forms a separate regional unit within the East Macedonia and Thrace region. Before the local administration reform of 2011, it was part of the Kavala Prefecture. The largest town and the capital is Thasos, officially known as &quot;Limenas Thasou&quot;, &quot;Port of Thasos&quot;, situated on the northern side. It is connected with the mainland by regular ferry lines between Keramoti and Thasos town, and between the regional centre of Kavala and Skala Prinou.

The most important economic activity on the island is tourism. The main agricultural products are honey, almonds, walnuts, olives (such as the local Throumba variety which has a protected designation of origin), olive oil, and wine. The inhabitants also engage in fishing, and in the herding of sheep and goats.

==History==

===Mythology===

Staphylus (), the beloved son of god Dionysus, lived in Thasos.

===Prehistory===

Lying close to the coast of Eastern Macedonia, Thasos was inhabited from the Palaeolithic period onwards, but the earliest settlement to have been explored in detail is that at Limenaria, where remains from the Middle and Late Neolithic relate closely to those found at the mainland&#x27;s Drama plain. In contrast, Early Bronze Age remains on the island align it with the Aegean culture of the Cyclades and Sporades, to the south; at Skala Sotiros for example, a small settlement was encircled by a strongly built defensive wall. Even earlier activity is demonstrated by the presence of large pieces of &#x27;megalithic&#x27; anthropomorphic stelai built into these walls, which, so far, have no parallels in the Aegean area.

There is then a gap in the archaeological record until the end of the Bronze Age c 1100 BC, when the first burials took place at the large cemetery of Kastri in the interior of the island. Here built tombs covered with small mound of earth were typical until the end of the Iron Age. In the earliest tombs were a small number of locally imitated Mycenaean pottery vessels, but the majority of the hand-made pottery with incised decoration reflects connections eastwards with Thrace and beyond.

===Antiquity===


The island was colonised at an early date by Phoenicians, attracted probably by its gold mines; they founded a temple to the god Melqart, whom the Greeks identified as &quot;Tyrian Heracles&quot;, and whose cult was merged with Heracles in the course of the island&#x27;s Hellenization. The temple still existed in the time of Herodotus. An eponymous Thasos or Thasus, son of Phoenix (or of Agenor, as Pausanias reported) was said to have been the leader of the Phoenicians, and to have given his name to the island.

Around 650 BC, or a little earlier, Greeks from Paros founded a colony on Thasos. A generation or so later, the poet Archilochus, a descendant of these colonists, wrote of casting away his shield during a minor war against an indigenous Thracian tribe, the Saians. Thasian power, and sources of its wealth, extended to the mainland, where the Thasians owned gold mines even more valuable than those of the island; their combined annual revenues amounted to between 200 and 300 talents. Herodotus says that the best mines on the island were those opened by the Phoenicians on the east side of the island, facing Samothrace. Archilochus described Thasos as &quot;an ass&#x27;s backbone crowned with wild wood.&quot; The island&#x27;s capital, Thasos, had two harbours. Besides its gold mines, the wine, nuts and marble of Thasos were well known in antiquity. Thasian wine was quite famous. Thasian coinage bore images of the wine-god Dionysos and grape bunches.

During the Ionian revolt against Persia, Thasos was under Persian domination. After the capture of Miletus (494 BC), Histiaeus, the Ionian leader, laid siege to Thasos, without success. In response, the Thasians built warships and strengthened their fortifications, but this provoked the suspicions of Darius I of Persia, who compelled them to surrender their ships and pull down their walls. After the defeat of Xerxes I the Thasians joined the Delian League but left in a disagreement over their mainland mines and markets.

The Athenians eventually defeated Thasos&#x27; navy, and took the capital after a two-year siege. The Thasians were made to destroy their walls, surrender their ships and their mainland possessions, and pay a regular indemnity. In 411 BC, during a period of political instability at Athens, Thasos accepted a Lacedaemonian governor; but in 407 BC the partisans of Lacedaemon were expelled, and the Athenians under Thrasybulus were admitted.

After the Battle of Aegospotami (405 BC), Thasos again fell into the hands of the Lacedaemonians under Lysander but the Athenians must have recovered it, for it formed one of the subjects of dispute between them and Philip II of Macedonia. In the embroilment between Philip V of Macedonia and the Romans, Thasos submitted to Philip, but received its freedom at the hands of the Romans after the Battle of Cynoscephalae (197 BC), and it was still a nominally &quot;free&quot; state in the time of Pliny.

Excavations of various island sites between March and May 1887 by Theodore and Mabel Bent uncovered an &#x27;Arch of Caracalla&#x27;, and the collapsed remains of a unique portrait-statue of the emperor Hadrian&#x27;s wife, the empress Flavia Vibia Sabina, with an inscription dedicated to her as a &quot;high priestess&quot;.

===Middle Ages===

Thasos was part of the Eastern Roman Empire, now known as the Byzantine Empire, from 395 on. According to the 6th century &quot;Synecdemus&quot;, it belonged to the province of Macedonia Prima, although the 10th century &quot;De thematibus&quot; claims that it was part of Thracia. The island was a major source of marble until the disruption of the Slavic invasions in the late 6th/7th centuries, and several churches from Late Antiquity have been found on it. The island remained in Byzantine hands for most of the Middle Ages. It functioned as a naval base in the 13th century, under its own &quot;doux&quot;, and came briefly under the rule of the Genoese Tedisio Zaccaria in 1307–13. Returning to Byzantine control, its bishopric was raised to an archdiocese by Manuel II Palaiologos. Thasos was captured by the Genoese Gattilusi family c. 1434, who surrendered it to the Ottoman Empire in 1455. Following the Ottoman conquest of the Despotate of the Morea in 1460, the former Despot Demetrios Palaiologos received lands on the island.

It is related that the Byzantine Greek Saint Joannicius the Great (752–846) in one of his miracles freed the island of Thasos from a multitude of snakes.

===Ottoman era===

Thasos was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1456. Under Ottoman rule, the island was known in Ottoman Turkish as طاشوز - &quot;Taşöz&quot;. Between 1770 and 1774, the island was briefly occupied by a Russian fleet. By this time its population had gravitated to the inland villages as a protective measure. Nearly 50 years later, a revolt against Ottoman rule arose in 1821, at the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, led by Hatzigiorgis Metaxas, but it failed. The Ottoman Census of 1831 states that the island was populated exclusively by Greeks and that there were 1,821 Greek males fit to fight. This register excluded women, orphans, Christians below the age of puberty, the mentally or physically incapacitated as well as high-ranking officials, so the actual population would have been over double this.

The island had been given in 1813 by the Sultan Mahmud II to the Ottoman Albanian ruler Muhammad Ali of Egypt as a personal fiefdom, as a reward for his intervention against the Wahhabites. The island had functioned as the chief centre of recruitment for Albanians who entered the Egyptian civil service, until 1912. On 20 October 1912 during the First Balkan War, the Greek navy invaded Thasos and annexed it into Greece after more than 350 years of Ottoman Turkish rule.

===Modern era===

During the Axis occupation (April 1941October 1944) Thasos, along with the region of East Macedonia and Thrace, was assigned by the Nazis to their Bulgarian allies. The Bulgarian government renamed the island &quot;Tasos&quot; and closed its schools. Thasos&#x27; mountainous terrain facilitated resistance activity, mainly led by the left-wing National Liberation Front (EAM). After the end of the war and the withdrawal of Axis troops in 1944, the island was caught up in the Greek Civil War. The leader of the communist naval faction, Sarantis Spintzos, was a native of Thasos. Skirmishes and communist guerilla attacks continued until 1950, almost a year after hostilities had ended on the Greek mainland.

In the post-war decades, another native of Thasos, Costas Tsimas, was to attain national recognition; a friend of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, he was appointed Director of the National Intelligence Service, the first civilian to hold that post.

Thasos, the capital, informally known as Limenas, or &quot;the port&quot;, is served by a ferry route to and from Keramoti a port close to Kavala International Airport, and has the shortest possible crossing to the island.
Scala Prinos 20 km south of Thassos town is served by a ferry route to and from Kavala.

==Administration==
Thasos is a separate regional unit of the East Macedonia and Thrace region, and the only municipality of the regional unit. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Thasos was created out of part of the former Kavala Prefecture. The municipality, unchanged at the Kallikratis reform, includes a few uninhabited islets besides the main island Thasos and has an area of 380.097 km2. The province of Thasos () was one of the provinces of the Kavala Prefecture. It had the same territory as the present municipality. It was abolished in 2006.

==Geography==
Thasos is located in the northern Aegean sea approximately from the northern mainland and south-east of Kavala. It is of generally round shape, without deep bays or significant peninsulas. The terrain is mountainous but not particularly rugged, rising gradually from coast to centre. The highest peak is Ypsario (Ipsario), at , somewhat east of centre. Pine forest covers much of the island&#x27;s eastern slopes.

Historically, the island&#x27;s population was chiefly engaged in agriculture and stockbreeding, and established villages inland, some of them connected via stairways (known as skalas) to harbors at the shore. The local population gradually migrated towards these shoreline settlements as tourism began to develop as an important source of income. Thus, there are several &quot;paired villages&quot; such as Maries–Skala Maries, with the former inland and the latter on the coast.

===Geology===

The island is formed mainly by gneisses, schists and marbles of the Rhodope massif. Marble sequences corresponding to the Falakro marbles intercalated by schists and gneisses, are up to 500 m thick and are separated from the underlying gneisses by a transition zone about 300 m thick.

The rocks have undergone several periods of regional metamorphism, to at least upper amphibolite facies, and there was a subsequent phase of retrograde metamorphism. At least three periods of regional deformation have been identified, the most important being large scale isoclinal folding with axes aligned north-west. The T-zone is deformed and is interpreted by some authors as a regional thrust of pre-major folding age. There are two major high angle fault systems aligned north-west and north-east respectively. A large low-angle thrust cuts the gneiss, schist and marble sequence at the south-west corner of the island, probably indicating an overthrusting of the Serbomacedonian Massif onto the Rodope Massif.

The Late Miocene oil-producing Nestos-Prinos basin is located between Thassos island and the mainland. The floor of the basin is around 1,500 m deep off the Thassos coast (South Kavala ridge; Proedrou, 1988) and up to 4.000–5.000 m in the axial sector between Thassos and the mainland. The basin is filled with Late Miocene-Pliocene sediments, including ubiquitously repeated evaporite layers of rock salt and anhydrite-dolomite that alternate with sandstones, conglomerates, black shales, and uraniferous coal measures (Proedrou, 1979, 1988; Taupitz, 1985). Stratigraphically equivalent rocks on the mainland are clastic sediments with coal beds, marine to brackish fluvial units and travertines.

===Mining history===
The earliest mining on the island has been dated to around 13,000 BC, when paleolithic miners dug a shaft at the site of the modern-era Tzines iron mine for the extraction of limonitic ochre. Mining for base and precious metals started around the 7th century BC with the Phoenicians, followed in the 4th century by the Greeks, then the Romans. These later mines were both open-cast and underground, mostly to exploit the island&#x27;s numerous karst hosted calamine deposits for their lead and silver. Gold, copper and iron were also found; the Byzantines quarried marble on the island.

In the early 20th century, mining companies (most notably the Speidel mining company) exploited the island&#x27;s zinc-lead rich calamine ores, with a yield of around 2 million tonnes, and a processing plant at Limenaria produced zinc oxide. Iron ore was mined on a significant scale from 1954 to 1964, with a yield of around 3 million tonnes. Since 1964, surveys have established the existence of a deep-level zinc-lead deposit, but the only mining activity on the island has been marble quarrying.

==Climate==
Thasos has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification) with mild winters and hot summers.

==Economy==

By far the most important economic activity is tourism. The main agricultural products on the island are honey, almonds, walnuts, olives (such as the local Throumba variety which has a protected designation of origin), olive oil, and wine. The inhabitants also engage in the herding of sheep and goats, and fishing. Other industries are lumber and mining which includes lead, zinc, and marble, especially in the Panagia area where one of the mountains near the Thracian Sea has a large marble quarry. The marble quarries in the south (in the area of Aliki), now abandoned, were mined during ancient times.

* Saint Panteleimon Monastery: it was built in 1843 and became monastery in 1987. According to inhabitants of Thassos, someone wanted to build it in favor of Saint Panteleimon. The workers started the building at a location, but the next day when they wanted to continue with the construction, the part they had built was found destroyed and their tools were missing. The same happened on the following days. One day they saw footprints on the ground and followed them until they found their tools nearby a natural spring. Finally, they built the monastery at that spot.
* Monastery of the Assumption
* Kastro: its foundation year is unknown. This village must have been created during the years of Frankish domination. 
* Krambousa Isle: it can be found across the coast of Skala Potamia. The thick vegetation makes it impossible to explore all parts of it.

<text>Alcathous (; Ancient Greek: Ἀλκάθοος) was the name of several people in Greek mythology:
* Alcathous, a Calydonian prince as the son of King Porthaon and Euryte, daughter of Hippodamas. He was the brother of Oeneus (successor of Porthaon), Agrius, Melas, Leucopeus, and Sterope. Alcathous was the second suitor of Hippodamia, and thus slain by her father Oenomaus like the other suitors except Pelops.
* Alcathous, possible son of Agrius who together with his brother Lycopeus, died at the hands of his cousin, Tydeus who went then into exile to Argos.

<text>A clementine (&quot;Citrus × clementina&quot;) is a tangor, a citrus fruit hybrid between a willowleaf mandarin orange (&quot;C.&quot; × &quot;deliciosa&quot;) and a sweet orange (&quot;C. × sinensis&quot;), named in honor of Clément Rodier, a French missionary who first discovered and propagated the cultivar in Algeria. The exterior is a deep orange colour with a smooth, glossy appearance. Clementines can be separated into 7 to 14 segments. Similar to tangerines, they tend to be easy to peel. They are typically juicy and sweet, with less acid than oranges. Their oils, like other citrus fruits, contain mostly limonene as well as myrcene, linalool, α-pinene and many complex aromatics.

They are sometimes sold under the name Easy-peelers.

==History==
The clementine is a spontaneous citrus hybrid that arose in the late 19th century in Misserghin, Algeria, in the garden of the orphanage of the French Missionary Brother Clément Rodier, for whom it would be formally named in 1902. Some sources have attributed an earlier origin for the hybrid, pointing to similar fruit native to the provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong in present-day China, but these are likely distinct mandarin hybrids, and genomic analysis of the clementine has shown it to have arisen from a cross between a sweet orange (&quot;Citrus × sinensis&quot;) and the Mediterranean willowleaf mandarin (&quot;Citrus × deliciosa&quot;), consistent with Algerian origin.

There are three types of clementines: seedless clementines, clementines (maximum of 10 seeds), and Monreal (more than 10 seeds). Clementines resemble other citrus varieties such as the satsuma and tangerines.

==Cultivation==
Clementines differ from other citrus in having lower heat requirement, which means the tolerance to fruit maturity and sensitivity to unfavorable conditions during the flowering and fruit-setting period is higher. However, in regions of high total heat, the Clementine bears fruit early; only slightly later than satsuma mandarins. These regions such as North Africa, Mediterranean basin, and California, also favor maximizing the Clementine size and quality.

It was introduced into California commercial agriculture in 1914, though it was grown at the Citrus Research Center (now part of the University of California, Riverside) as early as 1909. Clementines lose their desirable seedless characteristic when they are cross-pollinated with other fruit. In 2006, to prevent this, growers such as Paramount Citrus in California threatened to sue local beekeepers to keep bees away from their crops.

== Types ==

* Seedless – exists in North Africa. Seedless versions of the clementine are known as the common type (seedless or practically seedless). Common Clementines are very similar to the Monreal type; the two types are virtually identical in terms of tree specifics. The seedless Clementine tree is self-incompatible; which is why the fruit has so few or no seeds. In order to be pollinated, it needs to be cross-pollinated.
* Monreal – exists in North Africa. The Monreal clementine can self-pollinate and has seeds. Monreal clementines are on average larger than the seedless variety, has a more abundant bloom and is sweeter.
* Sweetclems — are typically grown in Spain and northern Africa. Unlike other Clementine varieties, they usually have 10 slices. They are specialised to be easy to peel. They have a sweet taste, as suggested by their name, but it is not overbearing and quite mild. The sweetclem has several other brand names, and can also be referred to as an easy-peeler, a clemengold, and a clemcott, amongst others.
==Varieties==

* Algerian, the original Rodier cultivar.
* Fina, a Spanish cultivar originally grown on a bitter orange rootstock that gave it superb flavor, but due to disease vulnerability is now grown on a broader range of rootstocks, affecting the flavor profile.
* Clemenules or Nules – A popular, seedless, easy to peel clementine with a very pleasing sweet flavor. A mutation of the Fina variety, Nules is the most widely planted clementine in Spain, where it matures from mid-November to mid to late-January. Also widely planted in California, where it matures from October to December. It produces seedless fruit that is larger than the Fina, but less sweet.
* Clementine del Golfo di Taranto, a (practically) seedless Italian cultivar given Protected geographical indication (PGI) status by the European Union, produced around the Gulf of Taranto. They have a sweet flavour and an intense aroma.
* Clementine di Calabria, another Italian PGI variety, grown in the Calabria region.

==Nutrition==
A typical clementine contains 87% water, 12% carbohydrates, and negligible amounts of fat and protein (table). Among micronutrients, only vitamin C is in significant content (59% of the Daily Value) in a 100 gram reference serving, with all other nutrients in low amounts.

==Potential drug interactions==
A 2017 study indicated that clementine phytochemicals may interact with drugs in a manner similar to those of grapefruit. A follow-up study in 2019, however, has called these results into question.

<text>A data model is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities. For instance, a data model may specify that the data element representing a car be composed of a number of other elements which, in turn, represent the color and size of the car and define its owner.

The corresponding professional activity is called generally &quot;data modeling&quot; or, more specifically, &quot;database design&quot;.
Data models are typically specified by a data expert, data specialist, data scientist, data librarian, or a data scholar. 
A data modeling language and notation are often represented in graphical form as diagrams.

A data model can sometimes be referred to as a data structure, especially in the context of programming languages. Data models are often complemented by function models, especially in the context of enterprise models.

A data model explicitly determines the &quot;structure of data&quot;; conversely, structured data is data organized according to an explicit data model or data structure. Structured data is in contrast to &quot;unstructured data&quot; and &quot;semi-structured data&quot;.

== Overview ==
The term data model can refer to two distinct but closely related concepts. Sometimes it refers to an abstract formalization of the objects and relationships found in a particular application domain: for example the customers, products, and orders found in a manufacturing organization. At other times it refers to the set of concepts used in defining such formalizations: for example concepts such as entities, attributes, relations, or tables. So the &quot;data model&quot; of a banking application may be defined using the entity–relationship &quot;data model&quot;. This article uses the term in both senses.

Managing large quantities of structured and unstructured data is a primary function of information systems. Data models describe the structure, manipulation, and integrity aspects of the data stored in data management systems such as relational databases. They may also describe data with a looser structure, such as word processing documents, email messages, pictures, digital audio, and video: XDM, for example, provides a data model for XML documents.

=== The role of data models ===

The main aim of data models is to support the development of information systems by providing the definition and format of data. According to West and Fowler (1999) &quot;if this is done consistently across systems then compatibility of data can be achieved. If the same data structures are used to store and access data then different applications can share data. The results of this are indicated above. However, systems and interfaces often cost more than they should, to build, operate, and maintain. They may also constrain the business rather than support it. A major cause is that the quality of the data models implemented in systems and interfaces is poor&quot;.
* &quot;Business rules, specific to how things are done in a particular place, are often fixed in the structure of a data model. This means that small changes in the way business is conducted lead to large changes in computer systems and interfaces&quot;.
* &quot;Entity types are often not identified, or incorrectly identified. This can lead to replication of data, data structure, and functionality, together with the attendant costs of that duplication in development and maintenance&quot;.
* &quot;Data models for different systems are arbitrarily different. The result of this is that complex interfaces are required between systems that share data. These interfaces can account for between 25-70% of the cost of current systems&quot;.
* &quot;Data cannot be shared electronically with customers and suppliers, because the structure and meaning of data has not been standardized. For example, engineering design data and drawings for process plant are still sometimes exchanged on paper&quot;.
The reason for these problems is a lack of standards that will ensure that data models will both meet business needs and be consistent.

A data model explicitly determines the structure of data. Typical applications of data models include database models, design of information systems, and enabling exchange of data. Usually, data models are specified in a data modeling language.[3]

=== Three perspectives ===

A data model &quot;instance&quot; may be one of three kinds according to ANSI in 1975:
# Conceptual data model: describes the semantics of a domain, being the scope of the model. For example, it may be a model of the interest area of an organization or industry. This consists of entity classes, representing kinds of things of significance in the domain, and relationship assertions about associations between pairs of entity classes. A conceptual schema specifies the kinds of facts or propositions that can be expressed using the model. In that sense, it defines the allowed expressions in an artificial &#x27;language&#x27; with a scope that is limited by the scope of the model.
# Logical data model: describes the semantics, as represented by a particular data manipulation technology. This consists of descriptions of tables and columns, object oriented classes, and XML tags, among other things.
# Physical data model: describes the physical means by which data are stored. This is concerned with partitions, CPUs, tablespaces, and the like.

The significance of this approach, according to ANSI, is that it allows the three perspectives to be relatively independent of each other. Storage technology can change without affecting either the logical or the conceptual model. The table/column structure can change without (necessarily) affecting the conceptual model. In each case, of course, the structures must remain consistent with the other model. The table/column structure may be different from a direct translation of the entity classes and attributes, but it must ultimately carry out the objectives of the conceptual entity class structure. Early phases of many software development projects emphasize the design of a conceptual data model. Such a design can be detailed into a logical data model. In later stages, this model may be translated into physical data model. However, it is also possible to implement a conceptual model directly.

== History ==
One of the earliest pioneering works in modeling information systems was done by Young and Kent (1958), who argued for &quot;a precise and abstract way of specifying the informational and time characteristics of a data processing problem&quot;. They wanted to create &quot;a notation that should enable the analyst to organize the problem around any piece of hardware&quot;. Their work was the first effort to create an abstract specification and invariant basis for designing different alternative implementations using different hardware components. The next step in IS modeling was taken by CODASYL, an IT industry consortium formed in 1959, who essentially aimed at the same thing as Young and Kent: the development of &quot;a proper structure for machine-independent problem definition language, at the system level of data processing&quot;. This led to the development of a specific IS information algebra.

In the 1960s data modeling gained more significance with the initiation of the management information system (MIS) concept. According to Leondes (2002), &quot;during that time, the information system provided the data and information for management purposes. The first generation database system, called Integrated Data Store (IDS), was designed by Charles Bachman at General Electric. Two famous database models, the network data model and the hierarchical data model, were proposed during this period of time&quot;. Towards the end of the 1960s, Edgar F. Codd worked out his theories of data arrangement, and proposed the relational model for database management based on first-order predicate logic.

In the 1970s entity–relationship modeling emerged as a new type of conceptual data modeling, originally formalized in 1976 by Peter Chen. Entity–relationship models were being used in the first stage of information system design during the requirements analysis to describe information needs or the type of information that is to be stored in a database. This technique can describe any ontology, i.e., an overview and classification of concepts and their relationships, for a certain area of interest.

In the 1970s G.M. Nijssen developed &quot;Natural Language Information Analysis Method&quot; (NIAM) method, and developed this in the 1980s in cooperation with Terry Halpin into Object–Role Modeling (ORM). However, it was Terry Halpin&#x27;s 1989 PhD thesis that created the formal foundation on which Object–Role Modeling is based.

Bill Kent, in his 1978 book &quot;Data and Reality,&quot; compared a data model to a map of a territory, emphasizing that in the real world, &quot;highways are not painted red, rivers don&#x27;t have county lines running down the middle, and you can&#x27;t see contour lines on a mountain&quot;. In contrast to other researchers who tried to create models that were mathematically clean and elegant, Kent emphasized the essential messiness of the real world, and the task of the data modeler to create order out of chaos without excessively distorting the truth.

In the 1980s, according to Jan L. Harrington (2000), &quot;the development of the object-oriented paradigm brought about a fundamental change in the way we look at data and the procedures that operate on data. Traditionally, data and procedures have been stored separately: the data and their relationship in a database, the procedures in an application program. Object orientation, however, combined an entity&#x27;s procedure with its data.&quot;

During the early 1990s, three Dutch mathematicians Guido Bakema, Harm van der Lek, and JanPieter Zwart, continued the development on the work of G.M. Nijssen. They focused more on the communication part of the semantics. In 1997 they formalized the method Fully Communication Oriented Information Modeling FCO-IM.

== Types ==

=== Database model ===
A database model is a specification describing how a database is structured and used.

Several such models have been suggested. Common models include:
; Flat model
: This may not strictly qualify as a data model. The flat (or table) model consists of a single, two-dimensional array of data elements, where all members of a given column are assumed to be similar values, and all members of a row are assumed to be related to one another.
; Hierarchical model
: The hierarchical model is similar to the network model except that links in the hierarchical model form a tree structure, while the network model allows arbitrary graph.
; Network model
: This model organizes data using two fundamental constructs, called records and sets. Records contain fields, and sets define one-to-many relationships between records: one owner, many members. The network data model is an abstraction of the design concept used in the implementation of databases.
; Relational model
: is a database model based on first-order predicate logic. Its core idea is to describe a database as a collection of predicates over a finite set of predicate variables, describing constraints on the possible values and combinations of values. The power of the relational data model lies in its mathematical foundations and a simple user-level paradigm.
; Object–relational model
: Similar to a relational database model, but objects, classes, and inheritance are directly supported in database schemas and in the query language.
; Object–role modeling
: A method of data modeling that has been defined as &quot;attribute free&quot;, and &quot;fact-based&quot;. The result is a verifiably correct system, from which other common artifacts, such as ERD, UML, and semantic models may be derived. Associations between data objects are described during the database design procedure, such that normalization is an inevitable result of the process.
; Star schema
: The simplest style of data warehouse schema. The star schema consists of a few &quot;fact tables&quot; (possibly only one, justifying the name) referencing any number of &quot;dimension tables&quot;. The star schema is considered an important special case of the snowflake schema.

=== Data structure diagram ===
A data structure diagram (DSD) is a diagram and data model used to describe conceptual data models by providing graphical notations which document entities and their relationships, and the constraints that bind them. The basic graphic elements of DSDs are boxes, representing entities, and arrows, representing relationships. Data structure diagrams are most useful for documenting complex data entities.

Data structure diagrams are an extension of the entity–relationship model (ER model). In DSDs, attributes are specified inside the entity boxes rather than outside of them, while relationships are drawn as boxes composed of attributes which specify the constraints that bind entities together. DSDs differ from the ER model in that the ER model focuses on the relationships between different entities, whereas DSDs focus on the relationships of the elements within an entity and enable users to fully see the links and relationships between each entity.

There are several styles for representing data structure diagrams, with the notable difference in the manner of defining cardinality. The choices are between arrow heads, inverted arrow heads (crow&#x27;s feet), or numerical representation of the cardinality.
=== Entity–relationship model ===

An entity–relationship model (ERM), sometimes referred to as an entity–relationship diagram (ERD), could be used to represent an abstract conceptual data model (or semantic data model or physical data model) used in software engineering to represent structured data. There are several notations used for ERMs. Like DSD&#x27;s, attributes are specified inside the entity boxes rather than outside of them, while relationships are drawn as lines, with the relationship constraints as descriptions on the line. The E-R model, while robust, can become visually cumbersome when representing entities with several attributes.

There are several styles for representing data structure diagrams, with a notable difference in the manner of defining cardinality. The choices are between arrow heads, inverted arrow heads (crow&#x27;s feet), or numerical representation of the cardinality.

=== Geographic data model ===

A data model in Geographic information systems is a mathematical construct for representing geographic objects or surfaces as data. For example, 
* the vector data model represents geography as points, lines, and polygons
* the raster data model represents geography as cell matrixes that store numeric values;
* and the Triangulated irregular network (TIN) data model represents geography as sets of contiguous, nonoverlapping triangles.

=== Generic data model ===

Generic data models are generalizations of conventional data models. They define standardized general relation types, together with the kinds of things that may be related by such a relation type. Generic data models are developed as an approach to solving some shortcomings of conventional data models. For example, different modelers usually produce different conventional data models of the same domain. This can lead to difficulty in bringing the models of different people together and is an obstacle for data exchange and data integration. Invariably, however, this difference is attributable to different levels of abstraction in the models and differences in the kinds of facts that can be instantiated (the semantic expression capabilities of the models). The modelers need to communicate and agree on certain elements that are to be rendered more concretely, in order to make the differences less significant.

=== Semantic data model ===
A semantic data model in software engineering is a technique to define the meaning of data within the context of its interrelationships with other data. A semantic data model is an abstraction that defines how the stored symbols relate to the real world. A semantic data model is sometimes called a conceptual data model.

The logical data structure of a database management system (DBMS), whether hierarchical, network, or relational, cannot totally satisfy the requirements for a conceptual definition of data because it is limited in scope and biased toward the implementation strategy employed by the DBMS. Therefore, the need to define data from a conceptual view has led to the development of semantic data modeling techniques. That is, techniques to define the meaning of data within the context of its interrelationships with other data. As illustrated in the figure. The real world, in terms of resources, ideas, events, etc., are symbolically defined within physical data stores. A semantic data model is an abstraction that defines how the stored symbols relate to the real world. Thus, the model must be a true representation of the real world.

== Topics ==

=== Data architecture ===

Data architecture is the design of data for use in defining the target state and the subsequent planning needed to hit the target state. It is usually one of several architecture domains that form the pillars of an enterprise architecture or solution architecture.

A data architecture describes the data structures used by a business and/or its applications. There are descriptions of data in storage and data in motion; descriptions of data stores, data groups, and data items; and mappings of those data artifacts to data qualities, applications, locations, etc.

Essential to realizing the target state, Data architecture describes how data is processed, stored, and utilized in a given system. It provides criteria for data processing operations that make it possible to design data flows and also control the flow of data in the system.

=== Data modeling ===
Data modeling in software engineering is the process of creating a data model by applying formal data model descriptions using data modeling techniques. Data modeling is a technique for defining business requirements for a database. It is sometimes called &quot;database modeling&quot; because a data model is eventually implemented in a database.

The figure illustrates the way data models are developed and used today. A conceptual data model is developed based on the data requirements for the application that is being developed, perhaps in the context of an activity model. The data model will normally consist of entity types, attributes, relationships, integrity rules, and the definitions of those objects. This is then used as the start point for interface or database design.

=== Data properties ===

Some important properties of data for which requirements need to be met are:
* definition-related properties
** &quot;relevance&quot;: the usefulness of the data in the context of your business.
** &quot;clarity&quot;: the availability of a clear and shared definition for the data.
** &quot;consistency&quot;: the compatibility of the same type of data from different sources.
* content-related properties
** &quot;timeliness&quot;: the availability of data at the time required and how up-to-date that data is.
** &quot;accuracy&quot;: how close to the truth the data is.
* properties related to both definition and content
** &quot;completeness&quot;: how much of the required data is available.
** &quot;accessibility&quot;: where, how, and to whom the data is available or not available (e.g. security).
** &quot;cost&quot;: the cost incurred in obtaining the data, and making it available for use.

=== Data organization ===
Another kind of data model describes how to organize data using a database management system or other data management technology. It describes, for example, relational tables and columns or object-oriented classes and attributes. Such a data model is sometimes referred to as the &quot;physical data model&quot;, but in the original ANSI three schema architecture, it is called &quot;logical&quot;. In that architecture, the physical model describes the storage media (cylinders, tracks, and tablespaces). Ideally, this model is derived from the more conceptual data model described above. It may differ, however, to account for constraints like processing capacity and usage patterns.

While &quot;data analysis&quot; is a common term for data modeling, the activity actually has more in common with the ideas and methods of &quot;&quot; (inferring general concepts from particular instances) than it does with &quot;&quot; (identifying component concepts from more general ones). {&quot;Presumably we call ourselves systems analysts because no one can say systems synthesists.&quot;} Data modeling strives to bring the data structures of interest together into a cohesive, inseparable, whole by eliminating unnecessary data redundancies and by relating data structures with relationships.

A different approach is to use adaptive systems such as artificial neural networks that can autonomously create implicit models of data.

=== Data structure ===
A data structure is a way of storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. It is an organization of mathematical and logical concepts of data. Often a carefully chosen data structure will allow the most efficient algorithm to be used. The choice of the data structure often begins from the choice of an abstract data type.

A data model describes the structure of the data within a given domain and, by implication, the underlying structure of that domain itself. This means that a data model in fact specifies a dedicated &quot;grammar&quot; for a dedicated artificial language for that domain. A data model represents classes of entities (kinds of things) about which a company wishes to hold information, the attributes of that information, and relationships among those entities and (often implicit) relationships among those attributes. The model describes the organization of the data to some extent irrespective of how data might be represented in a computer system.

The entities represented by a data model can be the tangible entities, but models that include such concrete entity classes tend to change over time. Robust data models often identify abstractions of such entities. For example, a data model might include an entity class called &quot;Person&quot;, representing all the people who interact with an organization. Such an abstract entity class is typically more appropriate than ones called &quot;Vendor&quot; or &quot;Employee&quot;, which identify specific roles played by those people.

=== Data model theory ===
The term data model can have two meanings:
# A data model &quot;theory&quot;, i.e. a formal description of how data may be structured and accessed.
# A data model &quot;instance&quot;, i.e. applying a data model &quot;theory&quot; to create a practical data model &quot;instance&quot; for some particular application.

A data model theory has three main components:
* The structural part: a collection of data structures which are used to create databases representing the entities or objects modeled by the database.
* The integrity part: a collection of rules governing the constraints placed on these data structures to ensure structural integrity.
* The manipulation part: a collection of operators which can be applied to the data structures, to update and query the data contained in the database.

For example, in the relational model, the structural part is based on a modified concept of the mathematical relation; the integrity part is expressed in first-order logic and the manipulation part is expressed using the relational algebra, tuple calculus and domain calculus.

A data model instance is created by applying a data model theory. This is typically done to solve some business enterprise requirement. Business requirements are normally captured by a semantic logical data model. This is transformed into a physical data model instance from which is generated a physical database. For example, a data modeler may use a data modeling tool to create an entity–relationship model of the corporate data repository of some business enterprise. This model is transformed into a relational model, which in turn generates a relational database.

=== Patterns ===
Patterns are common data modeling structures that occur in many data models.

== Related models ==

=== Data-flow diagram ===
 
A data-flow diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of the &quot;flow&quot; of data through an information system. It differs from the flowchart as it shows the &quot;data&quot; flow instead of the &quot;control&quot; flow of the program. A data-flow diagram can also be used for the visualization of data processing (structured design). Data-flow diagrams were invented by Larry Constantine, the original developer of structured design, based on Martin and Estrin&#x27;s &quot;data-flow graph&quot; model of computation.

It is common practice to draw a context-level data-flow diagram first which shows the interaction between the system and outside entities. The DFD is designed to show how a system is divided into smaller portions and to highlight the flow of data between those parts. This context-level data-flow diagram is then &quot;exploded&quot; to show more detail of the system being modeled

=== Information model ===
An Information model is not a type of data model, but more or less an alternative model. Within the field of software engineering, both a data model and an information model can be abstract, formal representations of entity types that include their properties, relationships and the operations that can be performed on them. The entity types in the model may be kinds of real-world objects, such as devices in a network, or they may themselves be abstract, such as for the entities used in a billing system. Typically, they are used to model a constrained domain that can be described by a closed set of entity types, properties, relationships and operations.

According to Lee (1999) an information model is a representation of concepts, relationships, constraints, rules, and operations to specify data semantics for a chosen domain of discourse. It can provide sharable, stable, and organized structure of information requirements for the domain context. More in general the term &quot;information model&quot; is used for models of individual things, such as facilities, buildings, process plants, etc. In those cases the concept is specialised to Facility Information Model, Building Information Model, Plant Information Model, etc. Such an information model is an integration of a model of the facility with the data and documents about the facility.

An information model provides formalism to the description of a problem domain without constraining how that description is mapped to an actual implementation in software. There may be many mappings of the information model. Such mappings are called data models, irrespective of whether they are object models (e.g. using UML), entity–relationship models or XML schemas.

=== Object model ===

An object model in computer science is a collection of objects or classes through which a program can examine and manipulate some specific parts of its world. In other words, the object-oriented interface to some service or system. Such an interface is said to be the &quot;object model of&quot; the represented service or system. For example, the Document Object Model (DOM) is a collection of objects that represent a page in a web browser, used by script programs to examine and dynamically change the page. There is a Microsoft Excel object model for controlling Microsoft Excel from another program, and the ASCOM Telescope Driver is an object model for controlling an astronomical telescope.

In computing the term &quot;object model&quot; has a distinct second meaning of the general properties of objects in a specific computer programming language, technology, notation or methodology that uses them. For example, the &quot;Java object model&quot;, the &quot;COM object model&quot;, or &quot;the object model of OMT&quot;. Such object models are usually defined using concepts such as class, message, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. There is an extensive literature on formalized object models as a subset of the formal semantics of programming languages.

=== Object–role modeling ===
Object–Role Modeling (ORM) is a method for conceptual modeling, and can be used as a tool for information and rules analysis.

Object–Role Modeling is a fact-oriented method for performing systems analysis at the conceptual level. The quality of a database application depends critically on its design. To help ensure correctness, clarity, adaptability and productivity, information systems are best specified first at the conceptual level, using concepts and language that people can readily understand.

The conceptual design may include data, process and behavioral perspectives, and the actual DBMS used to implement the design might be based on one of many logical data models (relational, hierarchic, network, object-oriented, etc.).

=== Unified Modeling Language models ===

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized general-purpose modeling language in the field of software engineering. It is a graphical language for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of a software-intensive system. The Unified Modeling Language offers a standard way to write a system&#x27;s blueprints, including:
* Conceptual things such as business processes and system functions
* Concrete things such as programming language statements, database schemas, and
* Reusable software components.
UML offers a mix of functional models, data models, and database models.

<text>Clementine (officially called the Deep Space Program Science Experiment (DSPSE)) was a joint space project between the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (previously the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization) and NASA, launched on January 25, 1994. Its objective was to test sensors and spacecraft components in long-term exposure to space and to make scientific observations of both the Moon and the near-Earth asteroid 1620 Geographos.

Its lunar observations included imaging at various wavelengths in the visible as well as in ultraviolet and infrared, laser ranging altimetry, gravimetry, and charged particle measurements. These observations were for the purposes of obtaining multi-spectral imaging of the entire lunar surface, assessing the surface mineralogy of the Moon, obtaining altimetry from 60°N to 60°S latitude, and obtaining gravity data for the near side. There were also plans to image and determine the size, shape, rotational characteristics, surface properties, and cratering statistics of Geographos. However, observation of the asteroid was not made due to a malfunction in the spacecraft.

== Spacecraft design ==
The spacecraft was an octagonal prism 1.88 m high and 1.14 m across with two solar panels protruding on opposite sides parallel to the axis of the prism. A high-gain fixed dish antenna was at one end of the prism, and the 489 N thruster at the other end. The sensor openings were all located together on one of the eight panels, 90 degrees from the solar panels, and protected by a single sensor cover.

The spacecraft propulsion system consisted of a monopropellant hydrazine system for attitude control and a bipropellant nitrogen tetroxide and mono-methyl hydrazine system for the maneuvers in space. The bipropellant system had a total Delta-v capability of about 1,900 m/s with about 550 m/s required for lunar insertion and 540 m/s for lunar departure.

Attitude control was achieved with 12 small attitude control jets, two star trackers, and two inertial measurement units. The spacecraft was three-axis stabilized in lunar orbit via reaction wheels with a precision of 0.05 deg in control and 0.03 deg in knowledge. Power was provided by gimbaled, single axis, GaAs/Ge solar panels which charged a 15 A·h, 47 W·h/kg Nihau (Ni-H) common pressure vessel battery.

Spacecraft data processing was performed using a MIL-STD-1750A computer (1.7 MIPS) for safe mode, attitude control, and housekeeping operations, a RISC 32-bit processor (18 MIPS) for image processing and autonomous operations, and an image compression system provided by the French Space Agency CNES. A data handling unit sequenced the cameras, operated the image compression system, and directed the data flow. Data was stored in a 2 Gbit dynamic solid state data recorder.

== Mission ==


On January 25, 1994, &quot;Clementine&quot; was launched from Space Launch Complex 4 West at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, using a Titan II launch vehicle. The mission had two phases. After two Earth flybys, lunar insertion was achieved approximately one month after launch. Lunar mapping took place over approximately two months, in two parts. The first part consisted of a five-hour elliptical polar orbit with a periapsis of about 400 km at 13 degrees south latitude and an apoapsis of 8,300 km. Each orbit consisted of an 80-minute lunar mapping phase near periapsis and 139 minutes of downlink at apoapsis.

After one month of mapping the orbit was rotated to a periapsis at 13 degrees north latitude, where it remained for one more month. This allowed global imaging and altimetry coverage from 60° south to 60° north, over a total of 300 orbits.

After a Moon to Earth transfer and two more Earth flybys, the spacecraft was to head for 1620 Geographos, arriving three months later for a flyby, with a nominal approach closer than 100 km. Unfortunately, on May 7, 1994, after the first Earth transfer orbit, a malfunction aboard the craft caused one of the attitude control thrusters to fire for 11 minutes, using up its fuel supply and causing &quot;Clementine&quot; to spin at about 80 rpm. Under these conditions, the asteroid flyby could not yield useful results, so the spacecraft was put into a geocentric orbit passing through the Van Allen radiation belts to test the various components on board.

The mission ended in June 1994 when the power level onboard dropped to a point where the telemetry from the spacecraft was no longer intelligible. However, &quot;because the spacecraft was fortuitously in the correct attitude to power up again, ground controllers were able to briefly regain contact between 20 February and 10 May 1995&quot;.

NASA announced on March 5, 1998, that data obtained from &quot;Clementine&quot; indicated that there is enough water in polar craters of the Moon to support a human colony and a rocket fueling station (see Bistatic Radar Experiment).

==Science instruments==

===Charged Particle Telescope (CPT)===
The Charged Particle Telescope (CPT) on &quot;Clementine&quot; was designed to measure the flux and spectra of energetic protons (3–80 MeV) and electrons (25–500 keV). The primary goals of the investigation were to: (1) study the interaction of the Earth&#x27;s magnetotail and interplanetary shocks with the Moon; (2) monitor the solar wind in regions far removed from other spacecraft as part of a multimission coordinated study; and, (3) measure the effects of incident particles on the operating ability of the spacecraft solar cells and other sensors.

In order to meet the stringent limit on the mass of the instrument (&lt;1 kg), it was implemented as a single element telescope. The telescope had a 10 degree half-angle field of view. The detector, a silicon surface-barrier type with an area of 100 mm2 and a thickness of 3 mm, was shielded so as to prevent protons below 30 MeV from reaching it from directions other than via the aperture. The aperture was covered by a very thin foil to prevent light impinging on the detector and generating noise. The signal from the detector was broken up into nine channels, the lowest six dedicated to electron detection and the highest three to protons and heavier ions.

===Ultraviolet/Visible camera===

The Ultraviolet/Visible camera (UV/Vis) was designed to study the surfaces of the Moon and the asteroid Geographos at five different wavelengths in the ultraviolet and visible spectrum. The Geographos rendezvous was canceled due to equipment malfunction. This experiment yielded information on the petrologic properties of the surface material on the Moon, as well as giving images useful for morphologic studies and cratering statistics. Most images were taken at low Sun angles, which is useful for petrologic studies but not for observing morphology.

The sensor consisted of a catadioptric telescope with an aperture of 46 mm and fused silica lenses focused onto a coated Thompson CCD camera with a bandpass of 250–1000 nm and a six-position filter wheel. The wavelength response was limited on the short wavelength end by the transmission and optical blur of the lens, and on the long end by the CCD response. The CCD was a frame transfer device which allowed three gain states (150, 350, and 1000 electrons/bit). Integration times varied from 1–40 ms depending on gain state, solar illumination angle, and filter. The filter center wavelengths (and bandpass widths (FWHM)) were 415 nm (40 nm), 750 nm (10 nm), 900 nm (30 nm), 950 nm (30 nm), 1000 nm (30 nm), and a broad-band filter covering 400–950 nm. The field of view was 4.2 × 5.6 degrees, translating to a cross-track width of about 40 km at a nominal 400 km lunar altitude. The image array was 288 × 384 pixels. Pixel resolution varied from 100–325 m during a single orbit mapping run at the Moon. At Geographos the pixel resolution would have been 25 m at the 100 km closest approach, giving an image size about 7 × 10 km. The camera took twelve images in each 1.3 s image burst, which occurred 125 times over the 80-minute mapping span during each five-hour lunar orbit. the Moon&#x27;s surface was covered completely during the two-month lunar mapping phase of the mission. The dynamic range was 15,000. The signal-to-noise ratio varied from 25–87 depending on the surface albedo and phase angle, with a relative calibration of 1% and an absolute calibration of 15%.

=== Near-Infrared CCD Camera (NIR)===

The &quot;Clementine&quot; Near-Infrared camera (NIR) was designed to study the surfaces of the Moon and the near-Earth asteroid 1620 Geographos at six different wavelengths in the near-infrared spectrum. This experiment yielded information on the petrology of the surface material on the Moon. The rendezvous with Geographos was canceled due to equipment malfunction.

The camera consisted of a catadioptric lens which focused on a mechanically cooled (to a temperature of 70 K) Amber InSb CCD focal-plane array with a bandpass of 1100–2800 nm and a six-position filter wheel. The filter center wavelengths (and bandpass widths (FWHM)) were: 1100 nm (60 nm), 1250 nm (60 nm), 1500 nm (60 nm), 2000 nm (60 nm), 2600 nm (60 nm), and 2780 nm (120 nm). The aperture was 29 mm with a focal length of 96 mm. The field of view was 5.6 × 5.6 degrees, giving a cross-track width of about 40 km at a nominal 400 km lunar altitude. The Moon had complete mapping coverage during the two-month lunar phase of the mission. The image array is 256 × 256 pixels, and pixel resolution varied from 150–500 m during a single orbit mapping run at the Moon. (At Geographos the pixel resolution would have been 40 m at closest approach, giving an image size about 10 × 10 km.) The camera took twelve images in each 1.3 s image burst, which occurred 75 times over the 80 minute mapping span during each five hour lunar orbit. The dynamic range was 15,000. The signal-to-noise ratio varied from 11–97 depending on the surface albedo and phase angle, with a relative calibration of 1% and an absolute calibration of 30%. The gain varied from 0.5X to 36X.

===Laser Image Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) System===

The &quot;Clementine&quot; Laser Image Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) experiment was designed to measure the distance from the spacecraft to a point on the surface of the Moon. This will allow an altimetric map to be made, which can be used to constrain the morphology of large basins and other lunar features, study stress and strain and flexural properties of the lithosphere, and can be combined with gravity to study the density distribution in the crust. The experiment was also designed to measure distances to the surface of Geographos, but this phase of the mission was canceled due to a malfunction.

The LIDAR system consisted of a 180 mJ, 1064 nm wavelength Nd-YAG (Yttrium-Aluminum-Garnet) laser transmitter which transmitted pulses to the lunar surface. The laser produced a pulse with a width less than 10 ns. At 1064 nm wavelength, the pulse had an energy of 171 mJ with a divergence less than 500 microrad. At 532 nm, it had a 9 mJ pulse with a 4 millirad divergence. The reflected pulse travelled through the High-Resolution Camera telescope, where it was split off by a dichroic filter to a silicon avalanche photodiode detector. The detector was a single 0.5 × 0.5 mm cell SiAPD receiver with a field of view of 0.057 square degrees. The laser had a mass of 1250 g, the receiver was housed in the 1120 g HIRES camera. The travel time of a pulse gave the range to the surface. The LIDAR memory could save up to six return detections per laser firing, with a threshold set for the best compromise between missed detections and false alarms. The returns were stored in 39.972 m range bins, equal to the resolution of the 14-bit clock counter. The LIDAR has a nominal range of 500 km, but altimetric data was gathered for altitudes up to 640 km, which allowed coverage from 60 degrees south to 60 degrees north by the end of the lunar phase of the mission. The vertical resolution is 40 m, and the horizontal spot resolution is about 100 m. The across track spacing of the measurements at the equator was about 40 km. One measurement was made each second over a 45-minute period during each orbit, giving an along track spacing of 1–2 km.

===High-Resolution Camera (HIRES)===
The &quot;Clementine&quot; High-Resolution Camera consisted of a telescope with an image intensifier and a frame-transfer CCD imager. The imaging system was designed to study selected portions of the surfaces of the Moon and the near-Earth asteroid 1620 Geographos, although the asteroid rendezvous was canceled due to a malfunction. This experiment allowed the detailed study of surface processes on the Moon and, combined with spectral data, allowed high-resolution compositional and geologic studies.

The imager was an intensified Thompson CCD camera with a six position filter wheel. The set of filters consisted of a broad-band filter with a bandpass of 400 to 800 nm, four narrow-band filters with center wavelengths (and bandpass width (FWHM)) of 415 nm (40 nm), 560 nm (10 nm), 650 nm (10 nm), and 750 nm (20 nm), and 1 opaque cover to protect the image intensifier. The field of view was 0.3 x 0.4 degrees, translating to a width of about 2 km at a nominal lunar altitude of 400 km. The image array is 288 × 384 pixels, (pixel size of 23 × 23 micrometers) so the pixel resolution at the Moon was 7–20 m depending on the spacecraft altitude. (At Geographos the resolution would have been &lt;5 m at closest approach.) The clear aperture was 131 mm and the focal length was 1250 mm. The nominal imaging rate was about 10 frames per second in individual image bursts covering all filters at the Moon. The high resolution and small field of view only allowed coverage of selected areas of the Moon, in the form of either long, narrow strips of a single color or shorter strips of up to four colors. The instrument has a signal to noise ratio of 13 to 41 depending on the albedo and phase angle, with a 1% relative calibration and a 20% absolute calibration, and a dynamic range of 2000.

The telescope of the High-Resolution Camera was shared by the LIDAR instrument. The 1064 nm laser return was split to the LIDAR receiver (an avalanche photodiode detector) using a dichroic filter.

Imagery from the HIRES can be viewed in NASA World Wind software.



==Bistatic Radar Experiment==
The &quot;Bistatic Radar Experiment&quot;, improvised during the mission, was designed to look for evidence of lunar water at the Moon&#x27;s poles. Radio signals from the &quot;Clementine&quot; probe&#x27;s transmitter were directed towards the Moon&#x27;s north and south polar regions and their reflections detected by Deep Space Network receivers on Earth. Analysis of the magnitude and polarisation of the reflected signals suggested the presence of volatile ices, interpreted as including water ice, in the Moon&#x27;s surface soils. A possible ice deposit equivalent to a sizeable lake was announced. However, later studies made using the Arecibo radio telescope showed similar reflection patterns even from areas not in permanent shadow (and in which such volatiles cannot persist), leading to suggestions that &quot;Clementine&quot;″s results had been misinterpreted and were probably due to other factors such as surface roughness.

==Partial failure and fate==
On May 7, 1994 (UTC), &quot;Clementine&quot; experienced a computer failure after it left Lunar orbit. The failure caused it to use up its remaining propellant, spinning the spacecraft up to 80 rotations per minute. It was utilized in a geocentric orbit until the end of its mission, but the asteroid trip was aborted. 

==Artifacts==
The engineering model of the Clementine spacecraft hangs in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

<text>Fabian Pascal is a Romanian-American consultant to large software vendors such as IBM, Oracle Corporation, and Borland, but is better known as an author and seminar speaker. Born in Romania, Pascal lives in the San Francisco, CA area of the US, and works in association with Christopher J. Date.

Pascal is known for his sharp criticisms of the data management industry, trade press, current state of higher education, Western culture and alleged media bias. Pascal advocates strict adherence to the principles of the relational model, and argues that departing from the model in the name of pragmatism is responsible for serious data management troubles. Criticism of Pascal&#x27;s advocacy often centers around his polemical style, which some perceive as overly confrontational and unprofessional.

He publishes political commentary on &quot;The PostWest&quot; blog about the decline of Western education and civilization and Middle East issues.

== Quotes ==
* &quot;A lot of what is being said, written, or done in the database management field — or whatever is left of it — by vendors, the trade press and &quot;experts&quot; is irrelevant, misleading, or outright wrong. While this is to a degree true of computing in general, in the database field the problems are so acute that, claims to the contrary notwithstanding, technology is actually regressing!&quot;
* &quot;The relational model is application of science — logic and math — to database management. The notion that one is &quot;fanatic&quot; about that is tantamount to claiming that civil engineering is fanatical about the laws of physics. Such a claim reveals problems more serious than ignorance of data fundamentals, and THAT is what deserves disdain.&quot; Fabian Pascal, August 29, 2005

<doc id="82874" wikidata="Q749966" url="?curid=82874" title="Oeneus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Oeneus (; ) was a Calydonian king. He introduced wine-making to Aetolia, which he learned from Dionysus and the first who received a vine-plant from the same god.

== Family ==
Oeneus was the son of King Porthaon and Euryte, and thus, brother of Agrius, Alcathous, Melas, Leucopeus, and Sterope. He married Althaea and became the father of Deianeira, Meleager, Toxeus, Clymenus, Periphas, Agelaus (or Ageleus), Thyreus (or Phereus or Pheres), Gorge, Eurymede, Melanippe and Perimede (although Meleager&#x27;s and Deianeira&#x27;s fathers could also have been Ares and Dionysus respectively). s&quot;ee Meleagrids&quot;.

Oeneus was also the father of Tydeus and possibly Melanippus or Olenias by Periboea, daughter of Hipponous, though Tydeus was exiled from Aetolia and appears in myths concerning Argos. According to Pausanias, Mothone was a daughter of Oeneus by a concubine. In some accounts, Polyxo was called the sister of Meleager and thus, can be counted among the daughters of Oeneus.


== Mythology ==
Oeneus slew his son Toxeus by his own hand because he leaped over the ditch. In Book VI of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Oeneus once hosted the hero Bellerophon, as described by his grandson Diomedes.

=== Divine visit ===
When Dionysus had come as a guest to Oeneus he fell in love with Althaea and the king realizing this, he voluntarily left the city and pretended to be performing sacred rites. But Dionysus lay with Althaea, who became mother of Dejanira. To Oeneus, because of his generous hospitality, he gave the vine as a gift, and showed him how to plant it, and decreed that its fruit should be called oinos from the name of his host.

=== Calydonian boar hunt ===

Since Oeneus had made sacrifices yearly to all the gods during the harvest ceremonies, but had omitted to honor Artemis, in anger she sent a boar of immense size to lay waste the district of Calydon. He sent out his son Meleager who promised that he would go with chosen leaders to attack the Calydonian boar. So began the Calydonian boar hunt during which the boar was killed by Atalanta and Meleager. However, an argument began as to who should take the boar&#x27;s skin as a prize: Meleager gave it to Atalanta, but two of his maternal uncles, sons of Thestius, wanted the trophy for themselves, claiming that it belonged to them by the right of birth if Meleager did not want it. Meleager, in rage, killed them, which resulted in a war between the Calydonians and the Curetes, in which all of Oeneus&#x27; sons, including Meleager, fell.

=== Aftermath ===
When Hipponoüs of Olenus, angered at his daughter Periboea because she claimed that she was with child by Ares, sent her away into Aetolia to Oeneus with orders for him to do away with her at the first opportunity. Oeneus, however, who had recently lost son and wife, was unwilling to slay Periboea, but married her instead and begat a son Tydeus.

The sons of Oeneus&#x27; brother Agrius deposed him but Diomedes, his grandson through Tydeus, put Oeneus back on the Calydonian throne (or the throne passed to Andraemon, husband of Gorge, due to Oeneus&#x27; old age). Oeneus either died of natural causes or was killed by the surviving sons of Agrius who laid an ambush against him while Diomedes was transporting him to Peloponessus. He was buried in Argos by Diomedes, and a town was named Oenoe after him.

<text>Agrius (; Ancient Greek: Ἄγριος means &quot;wild&quot;) in Greek mythology, is a name that may refer to:

*Agrius, one of the Giants, sons of Gaia. He, together with Thoon, was clubbed to death by Moirai with maces made from bronze, during the Gigantomachy, the battle of the Giants versus the Olympian gods.
*Agrius, son of King Porthaon of Calydon.
*Agrius, son of Polyphonte and a bear. He was the twin brother of Oreius. (see &quot;Agrius and Oreius&quot;)
*Agrius, one of the Centaurs who Heracles fought with.
*Agrius, son of Odysseus by Circe and a brother of Latinus and Telegonus, mentioned only in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;.
*Agrius, one of the Suitors of Penelope who came from Dulichium along with other 56 wooers. He, with the other suitors, was slain by Odysseus with the aid of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus.
*Agrius, one of Actaeon&#x27;s dogs.

The city of Agrinio, the largest city in Aetolia, took its name from Agrius.

<text>In Greek mythology, Porthaon (Ancient Greek: Πορθάων, genitive Πορθάονος), sometimes referred to as [[Parthaon (mythology)|Parthaon]] or [[Portheus]] (seems related to the verb &quot;portheō&quot; and &quot;perthō&quot;, &quot;destroy&#x27;), was a king of Calydon and son of Agenor or Ares by Epicaste and thus brother of Demonice (also known as Demodice) and possibly Thestius.

== Family ==
Porthaon was the husband of Euryte, daughter of Hippodamas, who became the mother of his children, Oeneus, Agrius, Alcathous, Melas, Leucopeus and Sterope. In some account, his wife Laothoe bore him three daughters, Sterope, Eurythemiste and Stratonice. By an unnamed servant, Porthaon was the father of the Argonaut Laocoön. Dia, the consort of his son Agrius was also called his daughter.

<text>One Minute Silence is an Irish four-piece rap metal/nu metal band based in London, England. The band consists of vocalist Brian &#x27;Yap&#x27; Barry, from Templemore, County Tipperary, guitarist Massimo Fiocco from London, drummer Martin Davies, and bass guitarist Glen Diani from Gibraltar. The band announced its split after eight years in a press release dated 21 October 2003. The band officially reconvened without original drummer Eddie Stratton in 2011.

== Biography ==
=== Formation and early days (1995–1996) ===
One Minute Silence came together in the early 1990s when Irish vocalist Brian Barry got together with guitarist Chris Ignatiou from London, under the name &quot;Near Death Experience&quot;. After working with various rhythm sections, they settled with Gibraltarian Glen Diani on bass guitar and Englishman Eddie Stratton on drums. Barry had befriended Stratton before the formation of the band. The band was soon forced to change its name because of an American group who shared it, and so it became One Minute Silence. That name, originally intended to be the title of a song, was chosen to parody the practice of having a one-minute silence as a mark of respect when someone considered &quot;important or well respected&quot; dies. The band felt that that respect was often &quot;misplaced&quot;.

=== Big Cat Records and &quot;Available in All Colors&quot; (1997–1998) ===
The band signed a recording contract with Big Cat Records in 1997 and released &quot;Available in All Colors&quot; the following year.

=== Payne&#x27;s departure and &quot;Buy Now... Saved Later&quot; (1999–2001) ===
&quot;Buy Now... Saved Later&quot; followed in 2000 after an amicable split with Ignatiou (now employed by MI6), who was ultimately replaced by Italian Massimo Fiocco, known as Massy, after original replacement Kee Payne left the band in 1999. This second album represented a noticeable step in the band&#x27;s musical progression: the record&#x27;s production quality and style differed from that of the first, which had used a hip-hop producer. &quot;Buy Now...&quot; sounded more like a metal album. With its well-rounded production and matured song-writing, &quot;Buy Now...&quot; sent the band on a tour of the US, with notable acts such as Slipknot and Mudvayne, the latter touring with them in the UK as supporting act.

=== &quot;One Lie Fits All&quot; and break-up (2002–2003) ===
After circulating a three-track demo and signing a deal with Taste Media, the band started recording sessions for their third album in autumn 2002. From live performances and both live and studio recordings, the new material was obviously a further progression; the group was experimenting with various time signatures, such as , and was using more melody and a greater variation in song structure.

A single, &quot;We Bounce&quot;, was released on 31 March 2003, with a third album, titled &quot;One Lie Fits All&quot;, following on 7 July that year. According to the band&#x27;s now-defunct website &quot;[t]his name continues the pattern of manipulating well known marketing slogans in order to present a political statement&quot;.

Between these releases, One Minute Silence had toured extensively, though the last tour had to be cancelled. The group&#x27;s following came largely from their energetic live shows – they have been voted &quot;Best British Live Act&quot; in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine.

In October 2003, the band announced its split:

:&quot;Although we are still the best of friends, and cannot rule out the possibility of working together in the future, for now we are dispersing to pursue other projects and interests. We&#x27;re still in love, we&#x27;re just not married any more!! There are no musical differences, and no personal conflicts affecting our friendship with each other, just a desire to branch out and explore other areas of life and music.&quot;

:&quot;The band would like to extend their infinite love and respect to those who have championed OMS over the years, whether from within the industry and the media or from without. Your support has been life-giving. An extra-special acknowledgement is due to the people who have come to our shows, and especially to the people in the pit, because without you there would have been no OMS, and without people to listen, music would be meaningless. You rule, we love you, and we miss you already!!&quot;

:&quot;Looking to the future; Yap is going full-throttle into spoken word performances, and he is also working on a number of political and philosophical media projects.&quot;

:&quot;Glen Diani and Massy Fiocco are currently considering and inviting other options. Eddie Stratton is currently filling in on drums with his friends in New Disease.&quot;

After One Minute Silence&#x27;s break-up, Yap followed his spoken-word career, appearing on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Bespoken Word&quot;.

=== Post-One Minute Silence (2004–2010) ===
After One Minute Silence, Barry began to write and perform new material as a slam poet and public speaker. The new material began to grow into a music project when he met producer John Hendicott and vocalist Donna Williams in 2005. A new band, Pink Punk, was formed and in 2006 the first album, &quot;Zoo Politics&quot;, emerged as an independent release on Freeport Records. The band&#x27;s website, PPunk.com, went live later in 2006 and by the end of the year the album was on iTunes, Napster and more than 7000 digital retailers worldwide through Universal Digital and IODA (US). Pink Punk had a live show in late 2007.

In March 2008, vocalist Barry touched on the issue of a possible reunion and fourth album in an article posted on the band&#x27;s unofficial Myspace page.

In 2008, Edwin Stratton was suffering severely from coeliac disease. He was arrested in mid-2008 after fire investigators, looking into a fire in a wine bar below his Leyton apartment, discovered cannabis plants in his home. Stratton stated that he was growing for medical use, but was charged with producing the drug cannabis, exposing him to a potential maximum sentence of 14 years in prison. Snaresbrook Crown Court handed down a sentence of three months in prison, suspended for one year with £500 costs, and prohibited Stratton from owning hydroponic equipment for one year. In November 2008, he was due to appear at the Waltham Forest Magistrates&#x27; Court and challenge the charge as a contravention of Article 14 of the Human Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination on any grounds.

<text>Available in All Colours is the debut album of British metal band One Minute Silence, released in 1998. It was released on Big Cat Records, and distributed by 3mv/Pinnacle in the UK, Sony Music in France, Rough Trade in Germany and Austria, M.N.W. in Scandinavia, Record Services in Ireland, P.I.A.S in Benelux and Universal in Italy.

It was produced by Machine, and so, although One Minute Silence are a rap metal band, it has a hip hop quality to it.

The album features cover artwork by Anne Stokes (the copyright is owned by Big Cat Records, however) which portrays fetuses in orange and green tubes with the labels &quot;racist&quot;, &quot;prophet&quot;, &quot;anarchist&quot;, &quot;humanitarian&quot;, &quot;psychopath&quot;, &quot;dictator&quot;, etc. It is intended as a comment on the isolation of capitalist society and the categorisation of individuals.

Three songs of &quot;Available in All Colors&quot; are featured in the 1999 video game &quot;Twisted Metal 4&quot;; &quot;South Central&quot; is played in the opening cinematic, &quot;A More Violent Approach&quot; serves as the menu music, and &quot;And Some Ya Lose&quot; is used as the sixth level theme (The Oil Rig). All of them are instrumental versions.

<text>The name Nausithous (; Ancient Greek: Ναυσίθοος &quot;Nausíthoos&quot;) is shared by the following characters in Greek mythology:

*Nausithous, the king of the Phaeacians who reigned in the generation before Odysseus washed ashore on their home island of Scherie (his son Alcinous was king at the time of Odysseus&#x27;s arrival). He was the son of the god Poseidon and Periboia, the daughter of the Giant king Eurymedon. According to Homer, Nausithous led a migration of Phaeacians from Hypereia to the island of Scheria in order to escape the lawless Cyclopes. He is the father of Alcinous and Rhexenor. Alcinous would go on to marry his niece, Rhexenor&#x27;s daughter Arete. One source relates that Heracles came to Nausithous to get cleansed after the murder of his children; during his stay in the land of the Phaeacians, the hero fell in love with the nymph Melite and conceived a son Hyllus with her.
*Nausithous, one of the two sons born to Odysseus by Calypso, the other one being Nausinous. According to Hyginus, Nausithous was a son of Odysseus and Circe; his brother was Telegonus.

<text>Samothrace (also known as Samothraki; , ) is a Greek island in the northern Aegean Sea. It is a municipality within the Evros regional unit of Thrace. The island is long, in size and has a population of 2,596 (2021 census). Its main industries are fishing and tourism. Resources on the island include granite and basalt. Samothrace is one of the most rugged Greek islands, with Mt Saos and its highest peak, Fengari, rising to . The &quot;Winged Victory of Samothrace&quot; statue, which is now displayed at the Louvre in Paris, was found on the island.

==History==

===Antiquity===


Samothrace never became a state of any political significance in ancient Greece, since it lacks natural harbours and most of the island is too mountainous for cultivation: Mount Fengari (literally &#x27;Mt Moon&#x27;) rises to . It was, however, the home of the Sanctuary of the Great Gods, site of important Hellenic and pre-Hellenic religious ceremonies. Those who visited this shrine to be initiated into the island cult included Lysander of Sparta, Philip II of Macedon and Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, father-in-law of Julius Caesar.

The ancient city, the ruins of which are called Palaeopolis (&#x27;old city&#x27;), stood on the north coast. Considerable remains exist of the ancient walls, which were built in massive Cyclopean style, as well as of the Sanctuary of the Great Gods, where mysterious rites (Samothracian Mysteries), which were open to both slaves and free people (similar to the Eleusinian Mysteries), took place. Demetrios of Skepsis mentions the Samothracian Mysteries, as does Aristophanes in his &quot;Peace&quot;.

The traditional account from antiquity is that Samothrace was first inhabited by Pelasgians and Carians, and later by Thracians. At the end of the 8th century BC Greeks from Samos colonised the island and named it &quot;Samos of Thrace&quot;, that later became Samothrace; however, Strabo denies this. The archaeological evidence suggests that Greek settlement took place in the 6th century BC.

The Persians occupied Samothrace in 508 BC, it later passed under Athenian control and was a member of the Delian League in the 5th century BC. It was subjugated by Philip II and from then till 168 BC it was under Macedonian suzerainty. After the 168 BC battle of Pydna, Samothrace became independent,
a condition that ended when Vespasian absorbed the island in the Roman Empire in AD 70.

During the Roman and particularly the imperial period, thanks to the interest of the Roman emperors, the influence of the sanctuary of the Great Gods extended beyond Greek borders and Samothrace became an international religious center, where pilgrims flocked from all over the Roman world. Apart from the famous sanctuary, also playing a decisive role in the great development of Samothrace were her two ports, situated on the sea road from Troas to Macedonia. Furthermore an important role was played by her possessions in Perea, which were conceded by the Romans at least during the imperial period, as evidenced by inscriptions of the 1st AD century.

The Book of Acts in the Christian Bible records that the Apostle Paul, on his second missionary journey outside of Palestine, sailed from Troas to Samothrace and spent one night there on his way to Macedonia. The island is mentioned in the King James Version of the Bible with the name &quot;Samothracia&quot;.

===Middle Ages to Modern era===
St Theophanes died in Samothrace in 818. The Byzantines ruled until 1204, when Venetians took their place, only to be dislodged in 1355 by a Genoese family, the Gattilusi. The Ottoman Empire conquered it in 1457 and it was called in Turkish. In the era of Kanuni Sultan Süleyman the island became a vakıf for the Süleymaniye Mosque and its Imaret in İstanbul. During the Ottoman period, it was one of the islands open to settlement among the Boğazönü Islands. The appearance of a person from Samothrace among the new inhabitants of the island of Lemnos in 1490 indicates that the population movements on the island were mostly with the surrounding islands and therefore the coastal areas close to Anatolia. The total tax population of the island in 1519 was 182 soldiers (male population of fighting age). 53 of them were newcomers to the island. There was a total tax population of 220 soldiers here in 1530 (twelve of whom were foreigners). In 1569, there were four settlements and a tax population of 742 soldiers on the island. Seven soldiers of this population were Muslims. The fact that neighborhoods, which are the main features of Ottoman towns and cities, were established in this last date indicates the process of becoming a town. However, in the mid-17th century, Bernard Randolph, while describing the island with Thasos and Imbros, states that all three of the islands were neglected because they were flooded by pirates and there were only two or three villages on each of them. According to Charles Vellay a rebellion against the Ottoman rule and Muslim population by the local population during the Greek War of Independence (1821–1831) led to the massacre of 1,000 inhabitants. The island came under Greek rule in 1913 following the Balkan Wars. It was occupied temporarily by Bulgaria during the Second World War, from 1941 to 1944.

===Today===
The modern port town of Kamariotissa is on the north-west coast and provides ferry access to and from points in northern Greece such as Alexandroupoli and Myrina. There is no commercial airport on the island. Other sites of interest on the island include the ruins of Genoese forts, the picturesque Chora (literally &quot;village&quot;) and Paleapolis (literally &quot;Old Town&quot;), and several waterfalls.

A 2019 article estimated that the current population of goats on the island outnumbers humans by about 15 to 1, resulting in unwanted erosion as a result of overgrazing.

==Landmarks==
The island&#x27;s most famous site is the Sanctuary of the Great Gods (Greek: &quot;Hieron ton Megalon Theon&quot;). The most famous artifact from the temple complex is the 2.5-metre marble statue of Nike (now known as the &quot;Winged Victory of Samothrace&quot;), which dates from about 190 BC. It was discovered in pieces on the island in 1863 by the French archaeologist Charles Champoiseau. It is now headless and is displayed at the Louvre in Paris. The Winged Victory is featured on the island&#x27;s municipal seal.

<doc id="82883" wikidata="Q496595" url="?curid=82883" title="Alcinous">
<text>In Greek mythology, Alcinous (also Alcinoüs; ; &quot;Alkínoos&quot; ) was a son of Nausithous and brother of Rhexenor. After the latter&#x27;s death, he married his brother&#x27;s daughter Arete who bore him Nausicaa, Halius, Clytoneus and Laodamas. In some accounts, Alcinous&#x27; father was Phaeax, son of Poseidon and Corcyra, and brother of Locrus.

== Mythology ==

=== Argonautica ===
In the myth of Jason and the Argonauts, Alcinous is represented as living with his wife Arete on Drépané island. The Argonauts, on their return from Colchis, came to his island, and were hospitably received. When the Colchians, in their pursuit of the Argonauts, likewise arrived in Drépané, and demanded that Jason&#x27;s lover Medea should be delivered up to them, Alcinous declared that if she was still a virgin she should be restored to them, but if she was already the wife of Jason, he would protect her and her husband against the Colchians. The Colchians were obliged, by the contrivance of Arete, to depart without their princess, and the Argonauts continued their voyage homeward, after they had received expensive presents from Alcinous. He was also the King of the Phaeacians.

=== Odyssey ===

According to Homer, Alcinous is the happy ruler of the Phaiacians in the island of Scheria, who has by Arete five sons and one daughter, Nausicaa. The description of his palace and his dominions, the mode in which Odysseus is received, the entertainments given to him, and the stories he related to the king about his own wanderings, occupy a considerable portion of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; (from book vi. to xiii.), and form one of its most charming parts. Alcinous has a squire, Pontonous, who serves wine during this feast.

=== Other accounts ===
In Conon&#x27;s &quot;Narrations&quot;, when Phaiax who reigned on the island of Corcyra died, Alkinous and his brother Lokros, after quarreling agreed upon on the basis that Alcinous would be the king of the Phaeacians and Locrus would take the heirlooms and part of the ethnos to make a colony. The latter sailed to Italy where he married the Laurine, daughter of King Latinus of the Italians and for this reason, the Phaiakians claim the Lokrians in Italy as relatives.

<text>Nausicaa (; , or , ), also spelled Nausicaä or Nausikaa, is a character in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. She is the daughter of King Alcinous and Queen Arete of Phaeacia. Her name means &quot;burner of ships&quot; ( &#x27;ship&#x27;; &#x27;to burn&#x27;).

==Role in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;==
In Book Six of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Odysseus is shipwrecked on the coast of the island of Scheria (Phaeacia in some translations). Nausicaä and her handmaidens go to the seashore to wash clothes. Awakened by their games, Odysseus emerges from the forest completely naked, scaring the servants away, and begs Nausicaä for aid. Affected by the unfortunate hero, she gives Odysseus some clothes and takes him to the edge of the town. Keeping him secret, she goes ahead into town, telling him to go directly to Alcinous&#x27;s house and make his case to Nausicaä&#x27;s mother Queen Arete, the family&#x27;s matriarch. Odysseus approaches Arete and wins her approval, and he is received as a guest by King Alcinous.

During his stay, Odysseus recounts his adventures to Alcinous and his court, a frame story for a substantial portion of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Alcinous then generously provides Odysseus with the ships that finally bring him home to Ithaca.

Nausicaä is young and beautiful; Odysseus says she resembles the goddess Artemis. She has several brothers. According to Aristotle and Dictys of Crete, she later married Odysseus&#x27;s son Telemachus, and had one or two sons, Poliporthes or/and Persepolis. 

Homer gives a literary account of a love which is never expressed (one of the earliest examples of unrequited love in literature). Nausicaä is presented as a potential love interest for Odysseus: she tells her friend that she would like her husband to be like him, and her father tells Odysseus that he would let him marry her. The two do not have a romantic relationship, however, and she marries Telemachus in some versions. Nausicaä is also a mother figure for Odysseus; she ensures his return home, and says &quot;Never forget me, for I gave you life&quot;. Odysseus never tells Penelope about his encounter with Nausicaä, out of all the women he met on his long journey home. Some suggest this indicates a deeper feeling for the young woman. According to some versions, the father of one of Nausicaa&#x27;s sons was Odysseus himself rather than his son Telemachus.

<text>Tiberias ( ; , ; ) is an Israeli city on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. A major Jewish center during Late Antiquity, it has been considered since the 16th century one of Judaism&#x27;s Four Holy Cities, along with Jerusalem, Hebron, and Safed. In , it had a population of .

Tiberias was founded around 20 CE by Herod Antipas and was named after Roman emperor Tiberius. It became a major political and religious hub of the Jews in the Land of Israel after the destruction of Jerusalem and the desolation of Judea during the Jewish–Roman wars. From the time of the second through the tenth centuries CE, Tiberias was the largest Jewish city in Galilee, and much of the Mishna and the Jerusalem Talmud were compiled there. Tiberias flourished during the Early Muslim period, when it served as the capital of Jund al-Urdunn and became a multi-cultural trading center. The city declined in importance over time due to earthquake damage and foreign incursions. After the Galilee earthquake of 1837 the city was rebuilt and grew steadily following the First Jewish Aliyah in the 1880s. 

In early modern times, Tiberias was a mixed city; under British rule it had a majority Jewish population, but with a significant Arab community. During the 1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine, fighting broke out between the Jewish residents of Tiberias and its Palestinian Arab minority. As the Haganah took over, British troops evacuated the entire Palestinian Arab population; they were refused reentry after the war, such that today the city has an almost exclusively Jewish population. After the war ended, the new Israeli authorities destroyed the Old City of Tiberias. A large number of Jewish immigrants to Israel subsequently settled in Tiberias.

Today, Tiberias is an important tourist center due to its proximity to the Sea of Galilee and religious sanctity to Judaism and Christianity. The city also serves as a regional industrial and commercial center. Its immediate neighbour to the south, Hammat Tiberias, which is now part of modern Tiberias, has been known for its hot springs, believed to cure skin and other ailments, for some two thousand years.

== Etymology ==
The city of Tiberias was named after the Roman Emperor Tiberius.

A Midrash regarding the city&#x27;s name appears in the Babylonian Talmud, &quot;Tractate Megillah&quot; &quot;6A&quot;:

&quot;&quot;Rabbi Yirmiya said: [...] And why is it called Tiberias? Because it sits at the navel (tabur) of the Land of Israel&quot;.&quot;

Rashi, in his commentary, provides two interpretations of the Midrash. The first explains the word &quot;&quot;navel&quot; (tabur)&quot; as referring to the lowest point in the Land of Israel. The second interpretation suggests that Tiberias is situated at the geographical center of the Land of Israel. Ishtori Haparchi later substantiated this claim through measurements of the entire land, demonstrating its accuracy.

==History==
: &quot;See Diocese of Tiberias for ecclesiastical history&quot;

===Biblical era===
Jewish tradition holds that Tiberias was built on the site of the ancient Israelite village of &quot;Rakkath&quot; or &quot;Rakkat&quot;, first mentioned in the Book of Joshua.
 In Talmudic times, the Jews still referred to it by this name.

===Roman period===
====Herodian period====
Tiberias was founded sometime around 18–20 CE in the Herodian Tetrarchy of Galilee and Perea by the Roman client king Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great. Herod Antipas made it the capital of his realm in Galilee and named it after the Roman emperor Tiberius. The city was built in immediate proximity to a spa which had developed around seventeen natural mineral hot springs, Hammat Tiberias. Tiberias was at first a strictly pagan city, but later became populated mainly by Jews, with its growing spiritual and religious status exerting a strong influence on balneological practices. Conversely, in &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, the Roman-Jewish historian Josephus calls the village with hot springs Emmaus, today&#x27;s Hammat Tiberias, located near Tiberias. This name also appears in his work &quot;The Jewish War&quot;.

Under the Roman Empire, the city was known by its Koine Greek name Τιβεριάς (&quot;Tiberiás&quot;, ).

In the days of Herod Antipas, some of the most religiously orthodox Jews, who were struggling against the process of Hellenisation, which had affected even some priestly groups, refused to settle there: the presence of a cemetery rendered the site ritually unclean for the Jews and particularly for the priestly caste. Antipas settled many non-Jews there from rural Galilee and other parts of his domains in order to populate his new capital, and built a palace on the acropolis. The prestige of Tiberias was so great that the Sea of Galilee soon came to be named the Sea of Tiberias; however, the Jewish population continued to call it &quot;Yam HaKineret&quot;, its traditional name. The city was governed by a city council of 600 with a committee of ten until 44 CE, when a Roman procurator was set over the city after the death of Herod Agrippa I.

Tiberias is mentioned in as the location from which boats had sailed to the opposite, eastern side of the Sea of Galilee. The crowd seeking Jesus after the miraculous feeding of the 5000 used these boats to travel back to Capernaum on the north-western part of the lake.

In 61 CE Herod Agrippa II annexed the city to his kingdom whose capital was Caesarea Philippi.

====Great Revolt and Bar Kokhba revolt====
During the First Jewish–Roman War, the Jewish rebels took control of the city and destroyed Herod&#x27;s palace, and were able to prevent the city from being pillaged by the army of Agrippa II, the Jewish ruler who had remained loyal to Rome. Eventually, the rebels were expelled from Tiberias, and while most other cities in the provinces of Judaea, Galilee and Idumea were razed, Tiberias was spared this fate because its inhabitants had decided not to fight against Rome. It became a mixed city after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE; with Judea subdued, the surviving southern Jewish population migrated to Galilee.

There is no direct indication that Tiberias, as well as the rest of Galilee, took part in the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132–136 CE, thus allowing it to continue to exist, despite a heavy economic decline due to the war. Following the expulsion of Jews from Judea after 135 CE, Tiberias and its neighbour Sepphoris (Hebrew name: Tzippori) became the major Jewish cultural centres.

====Late Roman period====
According to the Talmud, in 145 CE, Rabbi Simeon bar Yochai, who was very familiar with Galilee, hiding there for over a decade, &quot;cleansed the city of ritual impurity&quot;, allowing the Jewish leadership to resettle there from the Judea, which they were forced to leave as fugitives. The Sanhedrin, the Jewish court, also fled from Jerusalem during the Great Jewish Revolt against Rome, and after several attempted moves, in search of stability, eventually settled in Tiberias in about 220 CE. It was to be its final meeting place before its disbanding in 425 CE. When Johanan bar Nappaha (d. 279) settled in Tiberias, the city became the focus of Jewish religious scholarship in the land and the so-named Jerusalem Talmud was compiled by his school in Tiberias between 230–270 CE. Tiberias&#x27; 13 synagogues served the spiritual needs of a growing Jewish population. Tombs of famous rabbis Yohanan ben Zakkai, Akiva and Maimonides are also located in the city.

====Byzantine period====
In the 6th century Tiberias was still the seat of Jewish religious learning. In light of this, the &quot;Letter of Simeon of Beth Arsham&quot; urged the Christians of Palaestina to seize the leaders of Judaism in Tiberias, to put them to the rack, and to compel them to command the Jewish king, Dhu Nuwas, to desist from persecuting the Christians in Najran.

In 614, Tiberias was the site where, during the final Jewish revolt against the Byzantine Empire, parts of the Jewish population supported the Persian invaders; the Jewish rebels were financed by Benjamin of Tiberias, a man of immense wealth; according to Christian sources, during the revolt Christians were massacred and churches destroyed. In 628, the Byzantine army returned to Tiberias upon the surrender of Jewish rebels and the end of the Persian occupation after they were defeated in the battle of Nineveh. A year later, influenced by radical Christian monks, Emperor Heraclius instigated a wide-scale slaughter of the Jews, which practically emptied Galilee of most its Jewish population, with survivors fleeing to Egypt.

===Early Muslim period===
Tiberias, or Tabariyyah in Arab transcription, was &quot;conquered by (the Arab commander) Shurahbil in the year 634/15 [CE/AH] by capitulation; one half of the houses and churches were to belong to the Muslims, the other half to the Christians.&quot; Since 636 CE, Tiberias served as the regional capital, until Beit She&#x27;an took its place, following the Rashidun conquest. The Caliphate allowed 70 Jewish families from Tiberias to form the core of a renewed Jewish presence in Jerusalem and the importance of Tiberias to Jewish life declined. The caliphs of the Umayyad Dynasty built one of its square-plan palaces on the waterfront to the north of Tiberias, at Khirbat al-Minya. Tiberias was revitalised in 749, after Bet Shean was destroyed in an earthquake. An imposing mosque, long by wide, resembling the Great Mosque of Damascus, was raised at the foot of Mount Berenice next to a Byzantine church, to the south of the city, as the eighth century ushered in Tiberias&#x27;s golden age, when the multicultural city may have been the most tolerant of the Middle East. Jewish scholarship flourished from the beginning of the 8th century to the end of the 10th, when the oral traditions of ancient Hebrew, still in use today, were codified. One of the leading members of the Tiberian Masoretic community was Aaron ben Moses ben Asher, who refined the oral tradition now known as Tiberian Hebrew. Both the Codex Cairensis and the Aleppo Codex were written in Tiberias as well as the Tiberian vocalization was devised here.

The Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi writing in 985, describes Tiberias as a hedonistic city afflicted by heat: &quot;For two months they dance; for two months they gobble; for two months they swat; for two months they go about naked; for two months they play the reed flute; and for two months they wallow in the mud.&quot; As &quot;the capital of Jordan Province, and a city in the Valley of Canaan. ... The town is narrow, hot in summer and unhealthy...There are here eight natural hot baths, where no fuel need be used, and numberless basins besides of boiling water. The mosque is large and fine, and stands in the market-place. Its floor is laid in pebbles, set on stone drums, placed close one to another.&quot; According to Muqaddasi, those who suffered from scab or ulcers, and other such diseases came to Tiberias to bathe in the hot springs for three days. &quot;Afterwards they dip in another spring which is cold, whereupon ... they become cured.&quot;

Tiberias was plagued by incursions by the radical Shi&#x27;ite Qarmatians at the beginning of the tenth century. During that period, the Academy of Eretz Israel left Tiberias for Jerusalem. Later in the same century, the region came under the control by the Fatimid Caliphate. By this time, Tiberias had experienced its last period of prosperity; dried fruit, oil, and wine had been exported to Cairo via the Via Maris, and the city was also known for its mat industry.

In 1033 Tiberias was again destroyed by an earthquake. A further earthquake in 1066 toppled the great mosque. Nasir-i Khusrou visited Tiberias in 1047, and describes a city with a &quot;strong wall&quot; which begins at the border of the lake and goes all around the town except on the water-side. Furthermore, he describes
: numberless buildings erected in the very water, for the bed of the lake in this part is rock; and they have built pleasure houses that are supported on columns of marble, rising up out of the water. The lake is very full of fish. [] The Friday Mosque is in the midst of the town. At the gate of the mosque is a spring, over which they have built a hot bath. [] On the western side of the town is a mosque known as the Jasmine Mosque (Masjid-i-Yasmin). It is a fine building and in the middle part rises a great platform (dukkan), where they have their mihrabs (or prayer-niches). All round those they have set jasmine-shrubs, from which the mosque derives its name.

===Crusader period===
During the First Crusade Tiberias was occupied by the Franks soon after the capture of Jerusalem. The city was given in fief to Tancred, who made it his capital of the Principality of Galilee in the Kingdom of Jerusalem; the region was sometimes called the Principality of Tiberias, or the Tiberiad. In 1099 the original site of the city was abandoned, and settlement shifted north to the present location. St. Peter&#x27;s Church, originally built by the Crusaders, is still standing today, although the building has been altered and reconstructed over the years.

In the late 12th century Tiberias&#x27; Jewish community numbered 50 Jewish families, headed by rabbis, and at that time the best manuscripts of the Torah were said to be found there. In the 12th-century, the city was the subject of negative undertones in Islamic tradition. A &quot;hadith&quot; recorded by Ibn Asakir of Damascus (d. 1176) names Tiberias as one of the &quot;four cities of hell.&quot; This could have been reflecting the fact that at the time, the town had a notable non-Muslim population.

In 1187, Saladin ordered his son al-Afdal to send an envoy to Count Raymond of Tripoli requesting safe passage through his fiefdom of Galilee and Tiberias. Raymond was obliged to grant the request under the terms of his treaty with Saladin. Saladin&#x27;s force left Caesarea Philippi to engage the fighting force of the Knights Templar. The Templar force was destroyed in the encounter. Saladin then besieged Tiberias; after six days the town fell. On 4 July 1187 Saladin defeated the Crusaders coming to relieve Tiberias at the Battle of Hattin, outside the city. However, during the Third Crusade, the Crusaders drove the Muslims out of the city and reoccupied it.

Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon, (Maimonides) also known as Rambam, a leading Jewish legal scholar, philosopher and physician of his period, died in 1204 in Egypt and was later buried in Tiberias. His tomb is one of the city&#x27;s important pilgrimage sites. Yakut, writing in the 1220s, described Tiberias as a small town, long and narrow. He also describes the &quot;hot salt springs, over which they have built Hammams which use no fuel.&quot;

===Mamluk period===
In 1265 the Crusaders were driven from the city by the Egyptian Mamluks, who ruled Tiberias until the Ottoman conquest in 1516.

===Ottoman period===


During the 16th century, Tiberias was a small village. Italian Rabbi Moses Bassola visited Tiberias during his trip to Palestine in 1522. He said on Tiberias that &quot;it was a big city ... and now it is ruined and desolate&quot;. He described the village there, in which he said there were &quot;ten or twelve&quot; Muslim households. The area, according to Bassola, was dangerous &quot;because of the Arabs&quot;, and in order to stay there, he had to pay the local governor for his protection.

As the Ottoman Empire expanded along the southern Mediterranean coast under Sultan Selim I, the &quot;Reyes Católicos&quot; (Catholic Monarchs) began establishing Inquisition commissions. Many &quot;Conversos&quot;, (&quot;Marranos&quot; and &quot;Moriscos&quot;) and Sephardi Jews fled in fear to the Ottoman provinces, settling at first in Constantinople, Salonika, Sarajevo, Sofia and Anatolia. The Sultan encouraged them to settle in Palestine. In 1558, a Portuguese-born marrano, Doña Gracia, was granted tax collecting rights in Tiberias and its surrounding villages by Suleiman the Magnificent. She envisaged the town becoming a refuge for Jews and obtained a permit to establish Jewish autonomy there. In 1561 her nephew Joseph Nasi, Lord of Tiberias, encouraged Jews to settle in Tiberias and rebuild the city. Securing a &quot;firman&quot; from the Sultan, he and Joseph ben Adruth rebuilt the city walls and lay the groundwork for a textile (silk) industry, planting mulberry trees and urging craftsmen to move there. Plans were made for Jews to move from the Papal States, but when the Ottomans and the Republic of Venice went to war, the plan was abandoned.

At the end of the century (1596), the village of Tiberias had 54 households: 50 families and 4 bachelors. All were Muslims. The main product of the village at that time was wheat, while other products included barley, fruit, fish, goats and bee hives; the total revenue was 3,360 akçe.

In 1624, when the Sultan recognized Fakhr-al-Din II as Lord of Arabistan (from Aleppo to the borders of Egypt), The 1660 destruction of Tiberias by the Druze resulted in abandonment of the city by its Jewish community, Unlike Tiberias, the nearby city of Safed recovered from its destruction, and was not entirely abandoned, remaining an important Jewish center in Galilee.

In the 1720s, the Arab ruler Zahir al-Umar, of the Zaydani clan, fortified the town and made an agreement with the leader Nasif al-Nassar of the Al Saghir clan to prevent looting. Accounts from that time tell of the great admiration people had for Zahir, especially his war against bandits on the roads. Richard Pococke, who visited Tiberias in 1727, witnessed the building of a fort to the north of the city, and the strengthening of the old walls, attributing it to a dispute with the Pasha of Damascus. Under instructions from the Ottoman Porte, Sulayman Pasha al-Azm of Damascus besieged Tiberias in 1742, with the intention of eliminating Zahir, but his siege was unsuccessful. In the following year, Sulayman set out to repeat the attempt with even greater reinforcements, but he died en route.
Under Zahir&#x27;s patronage, Jewish families were encouraged to settle in Tiberias. He invited Rabbi Chaim Abulafia of Smyrna to rebuild the Jewish community. The synagogue he built still stands today, located in the Court of the Jews.

In 1775, Ahmed el-Jazzar &quot;the Butcher&quot; brought peace to the region with an iron fist. In 1780, many Polish Jews settled in the town. During the 18th and 19th centuries it received an influx of rabbis who re-established it as a center for Jewish learning. An essay written by Rabbi Joseph Schwarz in 1850 noted that &quot;Tiberias Jews suffered the least&quot; during an Arab rebellion which took place in 1834. Around 600 people, including nearly 500 Jews, died when the town was devastated by the 1837 Galilee earthquake. An American expedition reported that Tiberias was still in a state of disrepair in 1847/1848. Rabbi Haim Shmuel Hacohen Konorti, born in Spain in 1792, settled in Tiberias at the age of 45 and was a driving force in the restoration of the city.

===British Mandate===

In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Tiberias had a population of 6,950 inhabitants, consisting of 4,427 Jews, 2,096 Muslims, 422 Christians, and five others. Initially the relationship between Arabs and Jews in Tiberias was good, with few incidents occurring in the Nebi Musa riots in 1920 and the Arab riots throughout Palestine in 1929. The first modern spa was built in 1929.

The landscape of the modern town was shaped by the great flood of 11 November 1934. Deforestation on the slopes above the town combined with the fact that the city had been built as a series of closely packed houses and buildings – usually sharing walls – built in narrow roads paralleling and closely hugging the shore of the lake. Flood waters carrying mud, stones, and boulders rushed down the slopes and filled the streets and buildings with water so rapidly that many people did not have time to escape; the loss of life and property was great. The city rebuilt on the slopes and the British Mandatory government planted the Swiss Forest on the slopes above the town to hold the soil and prevent similar disasters from recurring. A new seawall was constructed, moving the shoreline several yards out from the former shore. In October 1938, Arab militants murdered 19 Jews in Tiberias during the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine. Between 8–9 April 1948, sporadic shooting broke out between the Jewish and Arab neighborhoods of Tiberias. Arab Liberation Army and irregular forces attacked and closed the Rosh Pinnah road, isolating the northern Jewish settlements. On 10 April, the Haganah launched a mortar barrage, killing some Arab residents. The local National Committee refused the offer of the Arab Liberation Army to take over defense of the city, but a small contingent of outside irregulars moved in.

During 10–17 April, the Haganah attacked the city and refused to negotiate a truce, while the British refused to intervene. Newly arrived Arab refugees from Nasir ad-Din told of the civilians there being killed, news which brought panic to the residents of Tiberias. The Arab population of Tiberias (6,000 residents or 47.5% of the population) was evacuated by the British forces on 18 April 1948.

The Jewish population looted the Arab areas and had to be suppressed by force by the Haganah and Jewish police, who killed or injured several looters. On 30 December 1948, when David Ben-Gurion was staying in Tiberias, James Grover McDonald, the United States ambassador to Israel, requested to meet with him. McDonald presented a British ultimatum for Israeli troops to leave the Sinai peninsula, Egyptian territory. Israel rejected the ultimatum, but Tiberias became famous.

====Destruction of the old city====
During the months after the occupation of the city, a large part of the buildings of the old city in Tiberias was destroyed, and this for various reasons - problems of hygiene, rickety construction, and the fear that the Arabs would return to the city, when it became known that this was a requirement of Jordan as part of the negotiations conducted in Rhodes. Finally, the authorities acceded to the initiative of the Jewish National Fund, Yosef Nahmani, who argued that the houses of the Old City should be demolished, despite the opposition of Mayor Shimon Dahan.

The destruction began in the summer of 1948 and continued until the first months of 1949. A visit by David Ben-Gurion to the city brought an end to the destruction, after 477 out of 696 houses were destroyed according to official estimates. After the destruction remained the remains of the wall and the citadel, several houses on the outskirts of the city, as well as the two mosques that operated in the city. The area stood abandoned for decades, until operations began to restore it in the 1970s.

===State of Israel===

The city of Tiberias has been almost entirely Jewish since 1948. Many Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews settled in the city, following the Jewish exodus from Arab countries in late 1940s and the early 1950s. Over time, government housing was built to accommodate much of the new population, like in many other development towns.

In 1959, during Wadi Salib riots, the &quot;&quot;Union des Nords-africains&quot; led by David Ben Haroush, organised a large-scale procession walking towards the nice suburbs of Haifa creating little damage but a great fear within the population. This small incident was taken as an occasion to express the social malaise of the different Oriental communities in Israel and riots spread quickly to other parts of the country; mostly in towns with a high percentage of the population having North African origins like in Tiberias, in Beer-Sheva, in Migdal-Haemek&quot;.

Over time, the city came to rely on tourism, becoming a major Galilean center for Christian pilgrims and internal Israeli tourism. The ancient cemetery of Tiberias and its old synagogues are also drawing religious Jewish pilgrims during religious holidays.

Tiberias consists of a small port on the shores of Galilee lake for both fishing and tourist activities. Since the 1990s, the importance of the port for fishing was gradually decreasing, with the decline of the Tiberias lake level, due to continuing droughts and increased pumping of fresh water from the lake. It was expected that the lake of Tiberias will regain its original level (almost higher than today), with the full operational capacity of Israeli desalination facilities by 2014. In 2020, the lake raised above the level it was in 1990. 

In 2012, plans were announced for a new ultra-Orthodox neighborhood, Kiryat Sanz, on a slope on the western side of the Kinneret.

==Demographics==
According to the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), as of August 2023, 49,876 inhabitants lived in Tiberias. According to CBS, as of December 2019 the city was rated 4 out of 10 on the socio-economic scale. The average monthly salary of an employee for the year 2019 was 7,508 NIS. Among today&#x27;s population of Jews, many are Mizrahi and Sephardic. The yearly growth rate of its population is 3.9%.

Following Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 many ex-South Lebanon Army soldiers and officers who fled from Lebanon settled in Tiberias with their families.

In the Ottoman registers of 1525, 1533, 1548, 1553, and 1572 all the residents were Muslims. The registers in 1596 recorded the population to consist of 50 families and four bachelors, all Muslim. In 1780, there were about 4,000 inhabitants, two thirds being Jews. In 1842, there were about 3,900 inhabitants, around a third of whom were Jews, the rest being Muslims and a few Christians. In 1850, Tiberias contained three synagogues which served the Sephardi community, which consisted of 80 families, and the Ashkenazim, numbering about 100 families. It was reported that the Jewish inhabitants of Tiberias enjoyed more peace and security than those of Safed to the north. In 1863, it was recorded that the Christian and Muslim elements made up three-quarters of the population (2,000 to 4,000). A population list from about 1887 showed that Tiberias had a population of about 3,640; 2,025 Jews, 30 Latins, 215 Catholics, 15 Greek Catholics, and 1,355 Muslims. In 1901, the Jews of Tiberias numbered about 2,000 in a total population of 3,600. By 1912, the population reached 6,500. This included 4,500 Jews, 1,600 Muslims and 400 Christians.

In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Tiberias had a population of 6,950 inhabitants, consisting of 4,427 Jews, 2,096 Muslims, 422 Christians, and five others. There were 5,381 Jews, 2,645 Muslims, 565 Christians and ten others in the 1931 census. By 1945, the population had increased to 6,000 Jews, 4,540 Muslims, 760 Christians with ten others.

During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Palestinian Arab residents of Tiberias besieged its Jewish quarter. Haganah troops then successfully attacked the Arab section of the city, and British troops evacuated the Arab residents upon their request. Some fled in the wake of news of the Deir Yassin massacre. The entire Arab population of the city was removed in 1948 by the British and partly because of Haganah decision. After the war had ended, a large number of Jewish immigrants to Israel settled in Tiberias. Today almost all of the population is Jewish.

==Urban renewal and preservation==

Ancient and medieval Tiberias was destroyed by a series of devastating earthquakes, and much of what was built after the major earthquake of 1837 was destroyed or badly damaged in the great flood of 1934. Houses in the newer parts of town, uphill from the waterfront, survived. In 1949, 606 houses, comprising almost all of the built-up area of the old quarter other than religious buildings, were demolished over the objections of local Jews who owned about half the houses. Wide-scale development began after the Six-Day War, with the construction of a waterfront promenade, open parkland, shopping streets, restaurants and modern hotels. Carefully preserved were several churches, including one with foundations dating from the Crusader period, the city&#x27;s two Ottoman-era mosques, and several ancient synagogues. The city&#x27;s old masonry buildings constructed of local black basalt with white limestone windows and trim have been designated historic landmarks. Also preserved are parts of the ancient wall, the Ottoman-era citadel, historic hotels, Christian pilgrim hostels, convents and schools.

==Archaeology==
A 2,000 year-old Roman theatre was discovered under layers of debris and refuse at the foot of Mount Bernike south of modern Tiberias. It once seated over 7,000 people.

In 2004, excavations in Tiberias conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority uncovered a structure dating to the 3rd century CE that may have been the seat of the Sanhedrin. At the time it was called Beit Hava&#x27;ad.

In June 2018, an underground Jewish mausoleum was discovered. Archaeologists said that the mausoleum was between 1,900 to 2,000 years old as of 2018. The names of the dead were inscribed on the ossuaries in Greek.

In January 2021, the foundations of a mosque dating to the earliest years of Muslim rule was excavated just south of the Sea of Galilee by archaeologists led by Katia Cytryn-Silverman from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Built around 670 CE, it is considered to have been the first purpose-built mosque in the city.

==Geography and climate==
Tiberias is located on the shore of the Sea of Galilee and the western slopes of the Jordan Rift Valley overlooking the lake, in the elevation range of . Tiberias has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;) that borders a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;), with an annual precipitation of . Summers in Tiberias average a maximum temperature of and a minimum temperature of in July and August. The winters are mild, with temperatures ranging from . Extremes have ranged from to .

Tiberias has been severely damaged by earthquakes since antiquity. Earthquakes are known to have occurred in 30, 33, 115, 306, 363, 419, 447, 631–32 (aftershocks continued for a month), 1033, 1182, 1202, 1546, 1759, 1837, 1927 and 1943.

The city is located above the Dead Sea Transform and is one of the cities in Israel that is most at risk to earthquakes (along with Safed, Beit She&#x27;an, Kiryat Shmona, and Eilat).

==Health care==

In 1885, a Scottish doctor and minister, David Watt Torrance, opened a mission hospital in Tiberias that accepted patients of all races and religions. In 1894, it moved to larger premises at Beit abu Shamnel abu Hannah. David Watt Torrance died in Tiberias in 1923. The same year his son, Dr. Herbert Watt Torrance, was appointed head of the hospital. In 1949, following the establishment of the State of Israel, it became a maternity hospital supervised by the Israeli Department of Health. After its closure in 1959, the building became a guesthouse until 1999, when it was renovated and reopened as the Scots Hotel.

Poria hospital is located near Upper Tiberias neighborhood, and operates a hospitalization control center in the city itself.

==Sports==

Its first football club established in 1925 was Maccabi Tiberias, but folded in the 1990s after financial difficulties.

Hapoel Tiberias represented the city in the top division of football for several seasons in the 1960s and 1980s, but eventually dropped into the regional leagues and folded due to financial difficulties.

Following Hapoel&#x27;s demise, a new club, Ironi Tiberias, was established, which currently plays in Liga Leumit. 

6 Nations Championship and Heineken Cup winner Jamie Heaslip was born in Tiberias.

The Tiberias Marathon is an annual road race held along the Sea of Galilee in Israel with a field in recent years of approximately 1000 competitors. The course follows an out-and-back format around the southern tip of the sea, and was run concurrently with a 10k race along an abbreviated version of the same route. In 2010 the 10k race was moved to the afternoon before the marathon. At approximately below sea level, this is the lowest course in the world.

<doc id="82887" wikidata="Q627992" url="?curid=82887" title="Rickettsia">
<text>Rickettsia is a genus of nonmotile, gram-negative, nonspore-forming, highly pleomorphic bacteria that may occur in the forms of cocci (0.1 μm in diameter), bacilli (1–4 μm long), or threads (up to about 10 μm long). The genus was named after Howard Taylor Ricketts in honor of his pioneering work on tick-borne spotted fever.

Properly, &quot;Rickettsia&quot; is the name of a single genus, but the informal term &quot;rickettsia&quot;, plural &quot;rickettsias,&quot; usually not capitalised, commonly applies to any members of the order Rickettsiales. Being obligate intracellular bacteria, rickettsias depend on entry, growth, and replication within the cytoplasm of living eukaryotic host cells (typically endothelial cells). Accordingly, &quot;Rickettsia&quot; species cannot grow in artificial nutrient culture; they must be grown either in tissue or embryo cultures. Mostly chicken embryos are used, following a method developed by Ernest William Goodpasture and his colleagues at Vanderbilt University in the early 1930s. Many new strains or species of &quot;Rickettsia&quot; are described each year. Some &quot;Rickettsia&quot; species are pathogens of medical and veterinary interest, but many &quot;Rickettsia&quot; are non-pathogenic to vertebrates, including humans, and infect only arthropods, often non-hematophagous, such as aphids or whiteflies. Many &quot;Rickettsia&quot; species are thus arthropod-specific symbionts, but are often confused with pathogenic &quot;Rickettsia&quot; (especially in medical literature), showing that the current view in rickettsiology has a strong anthropocentric bias.

Pathogenic &quot;Rickettsia&quot; species are transmitted by numerous types of arthropods, including chiggers, ticks, fleas, and lice, and are associated with both human and plant diseases. Most notably, &quot;Rickettsia&quot; species are the pathogens responsible for typhus, rickettsialpox, boutonneuse fever, African tick-bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever, and Queensland tick typhus (Australian tick typhus). The majority of pathogenic &quot;Rickettsia&quot; bacteria are susceptible to antibiotics of the tetracycline group.

==Classification==
The classification of &quot;Rickettsia&quot; into three groups (spotted fever, typhus, and scrub typhus) was initially based on serology. This grouping has since been confirmed by DNA sequencing. All three of these groups include human pathogens. The scrub typhus group has been reclassified as a related new genus, &quot;Orientia&quot;, but they still are in the order Rickettsiales and accordingly still are grouped with the rest of the rickettsial diseases.

Rickettsias are more widespread than previously believed and are known to be associated with arthropods, leeches, and protists. Divisions have also been identified in the spotted fever group and this group likely should be divided into two clades. Arthropod-inhabiting rickettsiae are generally associated with reproductive manipulation (such as parthenogenesis) to persist in host lineage.

In March 2010, Swedish researchers reported a case of bacterial meningitis in a woman caused by &quot;Rickettsia helvetica&quot; previously thought to be harmless.

===Spotted fever group===
:* &quot;Rickettsia rickettsii&quot; (Western Hemisphere)
:: Rocky Mountain spotted fever

:* &quot;Rickettsia akari&quot; (USA, former Soviet Union)
:: Rickettsialpox

:* &quot;Rickettsia conorii&quot; (Mediterranean countries, Africa, Southwest Asia, India)
:: Boutonneuse fever

:* &quot;Rickettsia sibirica&quot; (Siberia, Mongolia, northern China)
:: Siberian tick typhus or North Asian tick typhus

:* &quot;Rickettsia australis&quot; (Australia)
:: Australian tick typhus

:* &quot;Rickettsia felis&quot; (North and South America, Southern Europe, Australia)
:: Flea-borne spotted fever

:* &quot;Rickettsia japonica&quot; (Japan)
:: Oriental spotted fever

:* &quot;Rickettsia africae&quot; (South Africa)
:: African tick bite fever

:* &quot;Rickettsia hoogstraalii&quot; (Croatia, Spain and Georgia USA)
:: Unknown pathogenicity

===Typhus group===
:* &quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot; (worldwide)
:: Epidemic typhus, recrudescent typhus, and sporadic typhus

:* &quot;Rickettsia typhi&quot; (worldwide)
:: Murine typhus (endemic typhus)

===Scrub typhus group===

:* The causative agent of scrub typhus formerly known as &quot;R. tsutsugamushi&quot; has been reclassified into the genus &quot;Orientia&quot;.

==Flora and fauna pathogenesis==
Plant diseases have been associated with these &quot;Rickettsia&quot;-like organisms (RLOs):

:* Beet latent rosette RLO
:* Citrus greening bacterium possibly this citrus greening disease
:* Clover leaf RLO
:* Grapevine infectious necrosis RLO
:* Grapevine Pierce&#x27;s RLO
:* Grapevine yellows RLO
:* Witch&#x27;s broom disease on &quot;Larix&quot; spp.
:* Peach phony RLO
:* Papaya Bunchy Top Disease

Infection occurs in nonhuman mammals; for example, species of &quot;Rickettsia&quot; have been found to afflict the South American guanaco, &quot;Lama guanacoe&quot; potentially marsupials and reptiles.

==Pathophysiology==
Rickettsial organisms are obligate intracellular parasites and invade vascular endothelial cells in target organs, damaging them and producing increased vascular permeability with consequent oedema, hypotension, and hypoalbuminaemia.

==Genomics==
Certain segments of rickettsial genomes resemble those of mitochondria. The deciphered genome of &quot;R. prowazekii&quot; is 1,111,523 bp long and contains 834 genes. Unlike free-living bacteria, it contains no genes for anaerobic glycolysis or genes involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of amino acids and nucleosides. In this regard, it is similar to mitochondrial genomes; in both cases, nuclear (host) resources are used.

ATP production in &quot;Rickettsia&quot; is the same as that in mitochondria. In fact, of all the microbes known, the &quot;Rickettsia&quot; is probably the closest relative (in a phylogenetic sense) to the mitochondria. Unlike the latter, the genome of &quot;R. prowazekii&quot;, however, contains a complete set of genes encoding for the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the respiratory chain complex. Still, the genomes of the &quot;Rickettsia&quot;, as well as the mitochondria, are frequently said to be &quot;small, highly derived products of several types of reductive evolution&quot;.

The recent discovery of another parallel between &quot;Rickettsia&quot; and viruses may become a basis for fighting HIV infection. Human immune response to the scrub typhus pathogen, &quot;Orientia tsutsugamushi&quot;, appears to provide a beneficial effect against HIV infection progress, negatively influencing the virus replication process. A probable reason for this actively studied phenomenon is a certain degree of homology between the rickettsiae and the virus, namely, common epitope(s) due to common genome fragment(s) in both pathogens. Surprisingly, the other infection reported to be likely to provide the same effect (decrease in viral load) is the virus-caused illness dengue fever.

Comparative analysis of genomic sequences have also identified five conserved signature indels in important proteins, which are uniquely found in members of the genus &quot;Rickettsia&quot;. These indels consist of a four-amino-acid insertion in transcription repair coupling factor Mfd, a 10-amino-acid insertion in ribosomal protein L19, a one-amino-acid insertion in FtsZ, a one-amino-acid insertion in major sigma factor 70, and a one-amino-acid deletion in exonuclease VII. These indels are all characteristic of the genus and serve as molecular markers for &quot;Rickettsia&quot;.

Bacterial small RNAs play critical roles in virulence and stress/adaptation responses. Although their specific functions have not been discovered in &quot;Rickettsia&quot;, few studies showed the expression of novel sRNA in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) infected with &quot;Rickettsia&quot;.

Genomes of intracellular or parasitic bacteria undergo massive reduction compared to their free-living relatives. Examples include Rickettsia for alpha proteobacteria, T. whipplei for Actinobacteria, Mycoplasma for Firmicutes (the low G+C content Gram-positive), and Wigglesworthia and Buchnera for gamma proteobacteria.

==Naming==
The genus &quot;Rickettsia&quot; is named after Howard Taylor Ricketts (1871–1910), who studied Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana, and eventually died of typhus after studying that disease in Mexico City.

In his early part of career, he undertook research at Northwestern University on blastomycosis. He later worked on Rocky Mountain spotted fever at the University of Chicago and Bitterroot Valley of Montana. He was so devoted to his research that on several occasions, he injected himself with pathogens to study their effects. On account of the apparent similarity between Rocky Mountain fever and typhus fever, he became occupied in investigating the latter in Chicago where the disease was epidemic, and became a victim of the epidemic in 1910. His investigations and discoveries added materially to the sum of medical knowledge.

<doc id="82889" wikidata="Q940138" url="?curid=82889" title="Cabeiri">
<text>In Greek mythology, the Cabeiri or Cabiri (, &quot;Kábeiroi&quot;), also transliterated Kabeiri or Kabiri, were a group of enigmatic chthonic deities. They were worshipped in a mystery cult closely associated with that of Hephaestus, centered in the north Aegean Islands of Lemnos and possibly Samothrace—at the Samothrace temple complex—and at Thebes. In their distant origins the Cabeiri and the Samothracian gods may include pre-Greek elements, or other non-Greek elements, such as Thracian, Tyrrhenian, Pelasgian, Phrygian or Hittite. The Lemnian cult was always local to Lemnos, but the Samothracian mystery cult spread rapidly throughout the Greek world during the Hellenistic period, eventually initiating Romans.

The ancient sources disagree about whether the deities of Samothrace were Cabeiri or not; and the accounts of the two cults differ in detail. But the two islands are close to each other, at the northern end of the Aegean, and the cults are at least similar, and neither fits easily into the Olympic pantheon: the Cabeiri were given a mythic genealogy as sons of Hephaestus and Cabeiro. The accounts of the Samothracian gods, whose names were secret, differ in the number and sexes of the gods: usually between two and four, some of either sex. The number of Cabeiri also varies, with some accounts citing four (often a pair of males and a pair of females), and some even more, such as a tribe or whole race of Cabeiri, often presented as all male.

The Cabeiri were also worshipped at other sites in the vicinity, including Seuthopolis in Thrace and various sites in Asia Minor. One of these is posited to be Thessalonica and possibly was the cult of mysteries of which Paul warns against in his letters to the church there. According to Strabo, Cabeiri are most honored in Imbros and Lemnos but also in other cities too.

==Etymology and origin==

=== Etymology ===
In the past, the Semitic word &quot;kabir&quot; (&quot;great&quot;) has been compared to Κάβειροι since at least Joseph Justus Scaliger in the sixteenth century, but nothing else seemed to point to a Semitic origin, until the idea of &quot;great&quot; gods expressed by the Semitic root &quot;kbr&quot; was definitively attested for North Syria in the thirteenth century BCE, in texts from Emar published by D. Arnaud in 1985–87. Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling connected the Greek word to the Hebrew חבר (&quot;khaver&quot; &quot;friend, associate&quot;) and via this to several priest names as one attached to the Persians (&quot;Chaverim&quot;), linking them to the Dioskouri or priestly blacksmiths alternatively. T. J. Wackernagel in 1907 proposed a connection with the Sanskrit God &quot;Kubera/Kuvera&quot; which means &quot;the ill-shaped one&quot;. in 1925 A. H. Sayce had suggested a connection to Hittite &quot;habiri&quot; (&quot;looters&quot;, &quot;outlaws&quot;), but subsequent discoveries have made this implausible on phonological grounds. Dossein compares Κάβειροι to the Sumerian word &quot;kabar&quot;, &quot;copper.&quot; A connection with the Greek word &quot;Kaio&quot; () has also been suggested, considering the nature of the Cabeiri as demons of volcanic fire; this was suggested by Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker and Louis Ferdinand Alfred Maury. Strabo wrote that the Cabeiri were named &quot;after the mountain Kabeiros in Berekynthia&quot;. R. S. P. Beekes believes that their name is of non-Indo-European, pre-Greek origin. 

The name of the &quot;Cabeiri&quot; recalls Mount Kabeiros, a mountain in the region of Berekyntia in Asia Minor, closely associated with the Phrygian Mother Goddess. The name of Kadmilus (Καδμῖλος), or &quot;Kasmilos&quot;, one of the Cabeiri who was usually depicted as a young boy, was linked even in antiquity to &quot;Camillus&quot;, an old Latin word for a boy-attendant in a cult, likely a loan from the Etruscan language, which may be related to Lemnian. However, according to Beekes, the name &quot;Kadmilus&quot; may be of pre-Greek origin, as seems to be the case with the name &quot;Cadmus&quot;.

=== Origin ===
The Cabeiri&#x27;s origins are unknown. Jacob Wackernagel posited that they were possibly originally Phrygian or Thracian deities and protectors of sailors, who were imported into Greek ritual. According to &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;, the deities may have been Pelasgian or Phrygian. It is not known who brought these deities to Greece, but it was probably a group of Greeks, perhaps only a family which settled on the countryside of Thebes.

==Depiction in literary sources==
They were most commonly depicted as two people: an old man, Axiocersus, and his son, Cadmilus. Due to the cult&#x27;s secrecy, however, their exact nature and relationship with other ancient Greek and Thracian religious figures remained mysterious. As a result, the membership and roles of the Cabeiri changed significantly over time, with common variants including a female pair (Axierus and Axiocersa) and twin youths (frequently confused with Castor and Pollux, who were also worshiped as protectors of sailors). Roman antiquarians identified the Cabeiri with the three Capitoline deities or with the Di Penates.

The Lemnians were originally non-Greek; they were Hellenized after Miltiades conquered the island for Athens in the sixth century BCE. In Lemnos the cult of the Cabeiri survived, according to archaeological evidence, through the conquest: an ancient sanctuary dedicated to the Cabeiri is identifiable by traces of inscriptions, and seems to have survived the process of Hellenization. Walter Burkert records that wine jars are &quot;the only characteristic group of finds&quot; from the Cabeirium of Lemnos and that the Cabeirium was the location for initiation into an ancient mystery cult. However, due to the secret nature of mystery cults in the ancient world little survives to indicate what was involved in these initiation ceremonies; indeed, Hugh Bowden notes that on the basis of our evidence we do not know what happened at Lemnos beyond the fact of initiation, and that &quot;we have no descriptions and nothing on which even to base speculation&quot;. However, according to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, Lemnos held an annual festival of the Cabeiri, lasting nine days, during which all the fires were extinguished and fire brought from Delos.

The geographer Strabo reported (Geogr. 10,3,21) that in Lemnos, the mother (there was no father) of the Cabeiri was Kabeiro (Greek: Καβειρώ) herself, a daughter of Nereus (one of the &quot;old men of the sea&quot;) and a goddess whom the Greeks might have called Rhea.

In general Greek myth identifies the Cabeiri as divine craftsmen, sons or grandsons of Hephaestus, who was also chiefly worshipped on Lemnos. Aeschylus wrote a tragedy called &quot;The Kabeiroi&quot;, which apparently featured the deities as a chorus greeting the Argonauts at Lemnos and the Argonauts&#x27; initiation into the cult of the Cabeiri.

==Samothrace==
The Samothracians were also originally non-Greek, and are associated with the Trojans and the Pelasgians; they used a foreign language in the temple through Julius Caesar&#x27;s time. Samothrace offered an initiatory mystery, which promised safety and prosperity to seamen. The secret of these mysteries has largely been kept; but we know that of three things about the ritual, the aspirants were asked the worst action they had ever committed.

The mysteries of Samothrace did not publish the names of their gods; and the offerings at the shrine are all inscribed &quot;to the gods&quot; or &quot;to the great gods&quot; rather than with their names. But ancient sources tell us that there were two goddesses and a god: &quot;Axieros&quot;, &quot;Axiokersa&quot;, and &quot;Axiokersos&quot;, and their servant &quot;Cadmilos&quot; or &quot;Casmilos&quot;. Karl Kerényi conjectured that Axieros was male, and the three gods were the sons of Axiokersa (Cadmilos, the youngest, was also the father of the three); Burkert disagrees.

In Classical Greek culture the mysteries of the Cabeiri at Samothrace remained popular, though little was entrusted to writing beyond a few names and bare genealogical connections. Seamen among the Greeks might invoke the Cabeiri as &quot;great gods&quot; in times of danger and stress. The archaic sanctuary of Samothrace was rebuilt in Greek fashion; by classical times, the Samothrace mysteries of the Cabeiri were known at Athens. Herodotus had been initiated. But at the entrance to the sanctuary, which has been thoroughly excavated, the Roman antiquary Varro learned that there had been twin pillars of brass, phallic hermae, and that in the sanctuary it was understood that the child of the Goddess, Cadmilus, was in some mystic sense also her consort. Varro also describes these twin pillars as Heaven and Earth, denying the vulgar error that they are Castor and Pollux.

==Thebes in Boeotia==
At Thebes in Boeotia there are more varied finds than on Lemnos; they include many little bronze votive bulls and which carry on into Roman times, when the traveller Pausanias, always alert to the history of cults, learned that it was Demeter &quot;Kabeiriia&quot; who instigated the initiation cult there in the name of Prometheus and his son Aitnaios. Walter Burkert (1985) writes, &quot;This points to guilds of smiths analogous to the Lemnian Hephaistos.&quot; The votive dedications at Thebes are to a &quot;Kabeiros&quot; (Greek: Κάβειρος) in the singular, and childish toys like votive spinning tops for &quot;Pais&quot; suggest a manhood initiation. Copious wine was drunk, out of characteristic cups that were ritually smashed. Fat, primitive dwarves (similar to the followers of Silenus) with prominent genitalia were painted on the cups. Thebes is connected to Samothrace in myth, primarily the wedding of Cadmus and Harmonia, which took place there.

==Myth==
In myth, the Cabeiri bear many similarities to other fabulous races, such as the Telchines of Rhodes, the Cyclopes, the Dactyls, the Korybantes, and the Kuretes. These different groups were often confused or identified with one another since many of them, like the Cyclopes and Telchines, were also associated with metallurgy.

Diodorus Siculus said of the Cabeiri that they were &quot;Idaioi dactyloi&quot; (&quot;Idaian Dactyls&quot;). The Idaian Dactyls were a race of divine beings associated with the Mother Goddess and with Mount Ida, a mountain in Phrygia sacred to the goddess. Hesychius of Alexandria wrote that the Cabeiri were &quot;karkinoi&quot; (&quot;crabs&quot;). The Cabeiri as Karkinoi were apparently thought of as amphibious beings (again recalling the Telchines). They had pincers instead of hands, which they used as tongs (Greek: &quot;karkina&quot;) in metalworking.

<text>Buy Now... Saved Later is the second studio album by British metal band One Minute Silence, the follow-up to &quot;Available in All Colors&quot;. It was released in April 2000 on V2 Records and was dedicated &quot;to the memory of Neville Anthony Lynch&quot;. In contrast to the hip-hop-metal tinge the first album had, &quot;Buy Now... Saved Later&quot; has a more traditional guitar-metal sound, produced by Colin Richardson.

The cover art features a woman with devil horns, seemingly made of (or at least covered with) dollar notes and holding a Bible in her right hand, and a bitten apple in the left (a reference to temptation). Behind her is a grey One Minute Silence logo which also appears on the CD, on a black background. The song &quot;Holy Man&quot; appears in the 2000 video game &quot;ECW Anarchy Rulz&quot;.

== Performance ==
&quot;Buy Now... Saved Later&quot; was One Minute Silence&#x27;s highest-charting album, reaching number 61 in the UK Albums Chart.

== Track listing ==

The songs &quot;It&#x27;s Just a Ride&quot; and &quot;If I Can Change&quot; were partly inspired by comedian Bill Hicks.

<doc id="82893" wikidata="Q1412237" url="?curid=82893" title="Sony Dynamic Digital Sound">
<text>is a cinema sound system developed by Sony, in which compressed digital sound information is recorded on both outer edges of the 35mm film release print. The system supports up to eight independent channels of sound: five front channels, two surround channels and a single sub-bass channel. The eight channel arrangement is similar to large format film magnetic sound formats such as Cinerama and Cinemiracle. The five front channels are useful for very large cinema auditoriums where the angular distance between center and left/right channels may be considerable. SDDS decoders provide the ability to downmix to fewer channels if required.

==History==

Although originally slated to premiere with 1991&#x27;s &quot;Hook&quot;, the SDDS project was delayed and instead premiered on April 2, 1992.
and on June 17, 1993 premiered it First Film Last Action Hero. Since then, over 2000 movies have been mixed and remastered in Sony Dynamic Digital Sound, and as early as 1999 over 6,750 movie theaters were equipped with SDDS.

The code name for the SDDS project was &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, taken from the name of the comic book hero and the old term of &quot;magic lantern&quot; used to describe the original projected pictures in the late 19th century. Green came to mind because the key to imprinting the 8 micrometre data bits was to use a green laser.

Initial development efforts were conducted for Sony&#x27;s Columbia Pictures Sound Department under contract with Semetex Corp. of Torrance, California. At Semetex, the SDDS Chief Architect was Jaye Waas and the Chief Optical Engineer was Mark Waring.

The Semetex prototype design actually had the eight channels of uncompressed data placed into three locations: data bordering both sides of the analog sound track and additional data tracks bordering the opposite edge of the picture frame. These locations were chosen to ensure the data were not placed into the sprocket perforation area of the film to prevent the known wear and degradation that occurs in the perforation area (due to the mechanical film sprockets) from degrading the data. Clocking and guide tracks were placed on each side of the film near the sprockets. The prototype sound camera imprinted the Digital audio and Analog audio &#x27;at speed&#x27;. A companion digital reader was designed to form a complete system. After Sony received the prototype they enlarged the data bits from the original 8 micron (micrometer) size and moved the data locations; the eight digital audio channels are now recorded on (and recovered from) the edges of the film. As Sony engineers became more actively involved in the project, the design of the SDDS format evolved toward a more robust implementation, including the use of 5:1 ATRAC data compression, extensive error detection and correction, and most critically redundancy. The redundancy allows data to be recovered substantially intact even in the presence of a film splice (common for repairing damaged film). The data bit size on film was enlarged from 8 micron (micrometer) to 24 micrometers square, and Semetex&#x27;s green laser system for the sound camera was replaced with simpler LED/fiber optic assemblies which limited resolving to 24 micrometers. Using data compression allowed 24 micrometers square data bits to fit within the newly allocated areas.

The SDDS development at Semetex took just 11 months from concept to working sound camera.

When it came time for deployment, since Sony also owned the Sony Theaters chain (later sold to Loews Theaters), it was able to use SDDS in its own theaters. And via its highly successful Columbia/Tristar Studios arm, it was able to use SDDS as the exclusive digital soundtrack on its titles. In addition, in the early days of the &quot;megaplex explosion&quot;, Sony struck a deal with AMC Theatres in 1994 to include SDDS in all of their new auditoriums. This gave SDDS a much needed, kick-start. More than likely it would have garnered far less penetration had Sony not controlled both a theater chain and a film studio.

SDDS was consistently the least popular of the three competing digital sound formats, the other two being Spectral Recording Dolby Stereo Digital and DTS. Along with being the most expensive to install (and the last to arrive), there were major reliability issues with SDDS due to the change from the prototype sound track placement to the very edges of the film stock where the film is subject to damage. SDDS tracks are prone to damage as are some other digital formats. With all the digital sound formats: any failure of the digital track could result in a &quot;drop-out&quot; of the digital format and possibly a switch to analog sound. Additionally a drop-out resulting in a switch to Analog (Analogue) may produce a slight loss of fidelity and high and low-ends, although it is more difficult to tell in a properly calibrated auditorium.

SDDS&#x27;s much-touted eight track playback capability never quite caught on, as it required that a separate eight channel sound mix be created in addition to the six channel mix that is needed for SRD and DTS, an additional expense for the studios. Out of the 1,400 plus films mixed in SDDS, only 97 of them to date have been mixed to support the full 8 channels, most of them Sony (Via Sony Pictures/Columbia/Tristar) releases. Because of the added installation expense, the majority of SDDS installations are 6 channel (5.1) installations, as opposed to 8 channel (7.1) installations.

:&quot;See also List of 8 channel SDDS films.&quot;

While most major studios eventually began putting SDDS tracks on their releases, most independent films only came with Dolby Digital tracks, leaving many SDDS-equipped, or DTS theaters playing analog sound in otherwise state-of-the-art auditoriums. A few titles released under the Kidtoon Films program used SDDS tracks. As Dolby Digital (and to a lesser degree, DTS) began to emerge as the clear winner in the digital sound battle, Sony Cinema Products quit manufacturing SDDS encoders and decoders, although it will continue supporting equipment that is still deployed in the field.

Out of the three competing formats, SDDS was the only format not to have a corresponding home-theater version, and Sony ceased production of new units in the early 2000s.

==Technical==
*Original format used: 8 micron (micrometre) square data bits, 16 bit per audio channel, 8 audio channels, 2 clock tracks, 2 guide tracks for alignment with the film.
*Final format used: 24 micrometre square data bits.

The format carries up to 8 channels of Dynamic Digital Sound (DDS) encoded using Sony&#x27;s ATRAC codec with a compression ratio of about 5:1 and a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. The channels are:
*5 screen channels
**Left
**Left center
**Center
**Right center
**Right
*2 surround channels
**Left surround
**Right surround
*Subwoofer channel

Additionally there are 4 backup channels encoded – in case of damage to one side of the film or the other. These are:
*Center
*Subwoofer
*Left + left center
*Right + right center

This gives a total of 12 channels, for which the total bitrate of 2.2 megabits per second. This is more than the maximum 1.536 megabits per second DTS format bitrate, and far greater than the cinema Dolby Digital bitrate of 320 kilobits (0.32 megabits) per second.

For additional data reliability the two sides of the film are separated by 17 frames and half, so a single splice or series of missing frames will not result in a total loss of data.

==Reader==

The SDDS reader is mounted on top of a 35mm projector. The film is threaded through the reader before it passes through the picture aperture. As the film runs, red LEDs are used to illuminate the SDDS soundtrack. CCDs (Charge-Coupled Devices) read the SDDS data and convert the stream of dots on the film into digital information. This information is pre-processed in the reader and passed on to the SDDS decoder.

==Decoder==
The SDDS decoder is installed in the sound equipment rack. The decoder receives the information from the reader and translates it into audio signals routed to the cinema&#x27;s power amplifiers. The decoder is responsible for a series of processes that must be performed before the audio is recovered. Next, errors caused by scratches or damage to the film are corrected using redundant error recovery data. Since SDDS is read at the top of the projector, the data is delayed slightly to restore synchronization with the picture. And finally, adjustments in tonal balance and playback level are made to match the specific auditorium&#x27;s sound system and acoustics. SDDS is designed to process sound entirely in the digital domain, bypassing any existing analog processor, preserving clarity and providing full dynamic range.

<text>Ralph Rumney (5 June 1934 – 6 March 2002) was an English artist, born in Newcastle Upon Tyne, where his father was an Anglican vicar. 

In 1957 lifelong conscientious objector Rumney—he evaded National Service by going on the run in continental Europe—was one of the co-founders of the London Psychogeographical Association. This organization was, along with COBRA and the Lettrist International, involved in the formation of the Situationist International (SI). Amongst those present at the founding in the Italian village of Cosio d&#x27;Arroscia were Walter Olmo, Michèle Bernstein (later his second wife), Asger Jorn, and Guy Debord. However, within seven months Rumney had been &quot;amiably&quot; expelled from the SI by Debord for &quot;failing to hand in a psychogeography report about Venice on time.&quot;

Rumney spent much of his life living as a wanderer, and was variously described as both a &quot;recluse&quot; and a &quot;media whore&quot;, seeing his existence as a &quot;permanent adventure and endless experiment.&quot; Rumney married Pegeen Guggenheim, the daughter of Peggy Guggenheim. He moved, as his friend Guy Atkins said, &quot;between penury and almost absurd affluence. One visited him in a squalid room in London&#x27;s Neal Street, in a house shared with near down-and-outs. Next, one would find him in Harry&#x27;s Bar in Venice, or at a Max Ernst opening in Paris. He seemed to take poverty with more equanimity than riches.&quot;

His painting The Change is in the Tate Gallery collection. He had initially gifted it to Peggy Guggenheim at the time he met her daughter Pegeen.

Ralph Rumney died of cancer at his home in Manosque, Provence, France, in 2002, aged 67.

<doc id="82898" wikidata="Q622624" url="?curid=82898" title="Dolby Digital">
<text>Dolby Digital, originally synonymous with Dolby AC-3 (see below), is the name for a family of audio compression technologies developed by Dolby Laboratories. Called [[Dolby Stereo]] Digital until 1995, it is lossy compression (except for Dolby TrueHD). The first use of Dolby Digital was to provide digital sound in cinemas from 35 mm film prints. It has since also been used for TV broadcast, radio broadcast via satellite, digital video streaming, DVDs, Blu-ray discs and game consoles.

Dolby AC-3 was the original version of the Dolby Digital codec. The basis of the Dolby AC-3 multi-channel audio coding standard is the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), a lossy audio compression algorithm. It is a modification of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) algorithm, which was proposed by Nasir Ahmed in 1972 for image compression. The DCT was adapted into the MDCT by J.P. Princen, A.W. Johnson and Alan B. Bradley at the University of Surrey in 1987.

Dolby Laboratories adapted the MDCT algorithm along with perceptual coding principles to develop the AC-3 audio format for cinema. The AC-3 format was released as the Dolby Digital standard in February 1991. Dolby Digital was the earliest MDCT-based audio compression standard released, and was followed by others for home and portable usage, such as Sony&#x27;s ATRAC (1992), the MP3 standard (1993) and AAC (1997).

== Cinema ==

&quot;Batman Returns&quot; was the first movie to be announced as using Dolby SR-D (Spectral Recording-Digital) technology when it premiered in all selected movie theaters in the summer of 1992. Dolby Digital cinema soundtracks are optically recorded on a 35 mm release print using sequential data blocks placed between every perforation hole on the soundtrack side of the film. A constant bit rate of is used. A charge-coupled device (CCD) scanner in the image projector picks up a scanned video image of this area, and a processor correlates the image area and extracts the digital data as an AC-3 bitstream. The data is then decoded into a 5.1 channel audio source. All film prints with Dolby Digital data also have Dolby Stereo analog soundtracks using Dolby SR noise reduction and such prints are known as Dolby SR-D prints. The analog soundtrack provides a fall-back option in case of damage to the data area or failure of the digital decoding; it also provides compatibility with projectors not equipped with digital soundheads. Almost all modern cinema prints are of this type and may also include SDDS data and a timecode track to synchronize CD-ROMs carrying DTS soundtracks.

The simplest way of converting existing projectors is to add a so-called &quot;penthouse&quot; digital soundhead above the projector head. However, for new projectors it made sense to use dual analog/digital soundheads in the normal optical soundhead position under the projector head. To allow for the dual-soundhead arrangement the data is recorded 26 frames ahead of the picture. If a penthouse soundhead is used, the data must be delayed in the processor for the required amount of time, around 2 seconds. This delay can be adjusted in steps of the time between perforations, (approximately 10.4 ms).

Dolby Digital remains the predominant sound mixing format for movies, despite the introduction of Dolby Surround 7.1 and Dolby Atmos in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

== Versions ==
Dolby Digital has similar technologies, included in Dolby Digital EX, Dolby Digital Live, Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby Digital Surround EX, Dolby Digital Recording, Dolby Digital Cinema, Dolby Digital Stereo Creator and Dolby Digital 5.1 Creator.

===Dolby AC-3===


Dolby AC-3 (a backronym for Audio Codec 3, Advanced Codec 3, or Acoustic Coder 3), also known as ATSC A/52 (name of the standard) or simply Dolby Digital (DD), is the common version containing up to six discrete channels of sound. Before 1996 it was marketed as Dolby Surround AC-3, Dolby Stereo Digital, and Dolby SRD.

The most elaborate mode of this codec in common use involves five channels for normal-range speakers () (right, center, left, right surround, left surround) and one channel ( allotted audio) for the subwoofer driven low-frequency effects. Mono and stereo modes are also supported. AC-3 supports audio sample rates up to 48 kHz.

In 1991, a limited experimental release of &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; in Dolby Digital played in 3 US theatres. In 1992, &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was the first movie to be released and presented in Dolby Digital. In 1995, the LaserDisc version of &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; featured the first home theater Dolby Digital mix, quickly followed by &quot;True Lies&quot;, &quot;Stargate&quot;, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, and &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; among others.

=== Dolby Digital Surround EX ===
Dolby Digital Surround EX (sometimes shortened to Dolby Digital EX) is similar to Dolby&#x27;s earlier Pro Logic format, which utilized matrix technology to add a center surround channel and single rear surround channel to stereo soundtracks. EX adds an extension to the standard 5.1 channel Dolby Digital codec in the form of matrixed rear channels, creating 6.1 or 7.1 channel output.

It provides an economical and backwards-compatible means for 5.1 soundtracks to carry a sixth, center-back surround channel for improved localization of effects. The extra surround channel is matrix encoded onto the discrete &quot;left surround&quot; and &quot;right surround&quot; channels of the 5.1 mix, much like the front center channel on Dolby Pro Logic encoded stereo soundtracks. The result can be played without loss of information on standard 5.1 systems or played in 6.1 or 7.1 on systems with Surround EX decoding and added speakers. A number of DVDs have a Dolby Digital Surround EX audio option.

The theater version of &quot;Dolby Digital Surround EX&quot; was introduced in 1999, when Dolby and THX, a division of Lucasfilm Ltd., co-developed &quot;Dolby Digital Surround EX&quot;™ for the release of &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. Dolby Digital Surround EX has since been used on the DVD releases of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel and original trilogies.
=== Dolby Digital Live ===
Dolby Digital Live (DDL) is a real-time encoding technology for interactive media such as video games. It converts any audio signals on a PC or game console into a 5.1-channel 16-bit/48 kHz Dolby Digital format at and transports it via a single S/PDIF cable. A similar technology known as DTS Connect is available from competitor DTS. An important benefit of this technology is that it enables the use of digital multichannel sound with consumer sound cards, which are otherwise limited to digital PCM stereo or analog multichannel sound because S/PDIF over RCA, BNC, and TOSLINK can only support two-channel PCM, Dolby Digital multichannel audio, and DTS multichannel audio. HDMI was later introduced, and it can carry uncompressed multichannel PCM, lossless compressed multichannel audio, and lossy compressed digital audio. However, Dolby Digital Live is still useful with HDMI to allow transport of multichannel audio over HDMI to devices that are unable to handle uncompressed multichannel PCM.

Dolby Digital Live is available in sound cards using various manufacturers&#x27; audio chipsets. The SoundStorm, used for the Xbox game console and certain nForce2 motherboards, used an early form of this technology. DDL is available on motherboards with codecs such as Realtek&#x27;s ALC882D, ALC888DD and ALC888H. Other examples include some C-Media PCI sound cards and Creative Labs&#x27; X-Fi and Z series sound cards, whose drivers have enabled support for DDL.

NVIDIA later decided to drop DDL support in their motherboards due to the cost of involved royalties, leaving an empty space in this regard in the sound cards market.
Then in June 2005 came Auzentech, which with its X-Mystique PCI card, provided the first consumer sound card with Dolby Digital Live support.

Initially, no Creative X-Fi-based sound cards supported DDL (2005~2007) but a collaboration of Creative and Auzentech resulted in the development of the Auzentech Prelude, the first X-Fi card to support DDL. Originally planned to extend DDL support to all X-Fi-based sound cards (except the &#x27;Xtreme Audio&#x27; line which is incapable of DDL hardware implementation), the plan was dropped because Dolby licensing would have required a royalty payment for all X-Fi cards and, problematically, those already sold.
In 2008, Creative released the X-Fi Titanium series of sound cards which fully supports Dolby Digital Live while leaving all PCI versions of Creative X-Fi still lacking support for DDL.

Since September 2008, all Creative X-Fi-based sound cards support DDL (except the &#x27;Xtreme Audio&#x27; and its derivatives such as Prodigy 7.1e, which is incapable of DDL in hardware). X-Fi&#x27;s case differs.

While they forgot about the plan, programmer Daniel Kawakami made a hot issue by applying Auzentech Prelude DDL module back to Creative X-Fi cards by disguising the hardware identity as Auzentech Prelude.

Creative Labs alleged Kawakami violated their intellectual property and demanded he cease distributing his modified drivers.

Eventually Creative struck an agreement with Dolby Laboratories regarding the Dolby license royalty by arranging that the licensing cost be folded into the purchase price of the Creative X-Fi PCI cards rather than as a royalty paid by Creative themselves. Based on the agreement, in September 2008 Creative began selling the &quot;Dolby Digital Live&quot; packs enabling Dolby Digital Live on Creative&#x27;s X-Fi PCI series of sound cards. It can be purchased and downloaded from Creative. Subsequently, Creative added their &quot;DTS Connect&quot; pack to the DDL pack at no added cost.

=== Dolby Digital Plus ===
E-AC-3 (Dolby Digital Plus) is an enhanced coding system based on the AC-3 codec. It offers increased bitrates (up to ), support for even more audio channels (up to 15.1 discrete channels in the future), and improved coding techniques (only at low data rates) to reduce compression artifacts, enabling lower data rates than those supported by AC-3 (e.g. 5.1-channel audio at ). It is not backward compatible with existing AC-3 hardware, though E-AC-3 codecs generally are capable of transcoding to AC-3 for equipment connected via S/PDIF. E-AC-3 decoders can also decode AC-3 bitstreams. The fourth generation Apple TV supports E-AC-3. The discontinued HD DVD system directly supported E-AC-3. Blu-ray Disc offers E-AC-3 as an option to added channels onto an otherwise 5.1 AC-3 stream, as well as for delivery of secondary audio content (e.g. director&#x27;s commentary) that is intended to be mixed with the primary audio soundtrack in the Blu-ray Disc player.

=== Dolby AC-4 ===
Dolby AC-4 is an audio compression standard supporting multiple audio channels and/or audio objects. Support for 5.1 channel audio is mandatory and additional channels up to 7.1.4 are optional. AC-4 provides a 50% reduction in bit rate over AC-3/Dolby Digital Plus.

=== Dolby TrueHD ===

Dolby TrueHD, developed by Dolby Laboratories, is an advanced lossless audio codec based on Meridian Lossless Packing. Support for the codec was mandatory for HD DVD and is optional for Blu-ray Disc hardware. Dolby TrueHD supports 24-bit bit depths and sample rates up to 192 kHz. Maximum bitrate is while it supports up to 16 audio channels (HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc standards currently limit the maximum number of audio channels to eight). It supports metadata, including dialog normalization and Dynamic Range Control.

== Channel configurations ==
Although commonly associated with the 5.1 channel configuration, Dolby Digital allows a number of different channel selections. The options are:

* Dolby Digital 1/0 – Mono (center only)
* Dolby Digital 2/0 – 2-channel stereo (left + right), optionally carrying matrixed Dolby Surround
* Dolby Digital 3/0 – 3-channel stereo (left, center, right)
* Dolby Digital 2/1 – 2-channel stereo with mono surround (left, right, surround)
* Dolby Digital 3/1 – 3-channel stereo with mono surround (left, center, right, surround)
* Dolby Digital 2/2 – 4-channel quadraphonic (left, right, left surround, right surround)
* Dolby Digital 3/2 – 5-channel surround (left, center, right, left surround, right surround)

These configurations optionally include the extra low-frequency effects (LFE) channel, but only if at least three channels are present. The last two with stereo surrounds can optionally use Dolby Digital EX matrix encoding to add an extra Rear Surround channel, indicated via a 2-bit flag.

Many Dolby Digital decoders are equipped with downmixing to distribute encoded channels to speakers. This includes such functions as playing surround information through the front speakers if surround speakers are unavailable and distributing the center channel to left and right if no center speaker is available. When outputting to separate equipment over a 2-channel connection, a Dolby Digital decoder can optionally encode the output using Dolby Surround to preserve surround information.

The &#x27;.1&#x27; in 5.1, 7.1, etc. refers to the LFE channel, which is also a discrete channel.

== Applications ==
Dolby Digital audio is used on DVD-Video and other purely digital media, like home cinema. In this format, the AC-3 bitstream is interleaved with the video and control bitstreams.

The system is used in bandwidth-limited applications other than DVD-Video, such as digital TV. The AC-3 standard allows a maximum coded bit rate of . 35 mm film prints use a fixed rate of , which is the same as the maximum bit rate for 2-channel MP3. DVD-Video discs are limited to , although many players can successfully play higher-rate bitstreams (which are non-compliant with the DVD specification). HD DVD limits AC-3 to , as do ATSC and digital cable standards. Blu-ray Disc, the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox game console can output an AC-3 signal at a full . Some Sony PlayStation 2 console games are able to output AC-3 standard audio as well, primarily during pre-rendered cutscenes.

Dolby is part of a group of organizations involved in the development of AAC (Advanced Audio Coding), part of MPEG specifications, and considered the successor to MP3.

Dolby Digital Plus (DD-Plus) and TrueHD are supported in HD-DVD, as mandatory codecs, and in Blu-ray Disc, as optional codecs.

== Dolby technologies in packaged media formats ==
==AC3RF==
In the LaserDisc world &quot;AC3RF&quot; is the term widely placed on connectors of players that support Dolby Digital. Specific demodulators and receivers from the LaserDisc era (1990s thru early 2000s) also include placement of this term on connectors.

LaserDisc titles with Dolby Digital tracks often have the THX logo on their covers.

==Technical details==
The data layout of AC-3 is described by simplified &quot;C-like&quot; language in official specifications. An AC-3 stream is a series of frames; the frame size code is used along with the sample rate code to determine the number of (2-byte)
words before the next syncword. Channel blocks can be either long, in which case the entire block is processed as single modified discrete cosine transform, or short, in which case two half-length transforms are performed on the block. Below is a simplified AC-3 header. A detailed description is in the ATSC &quot;Digital Audio Compression (AC-3) (E-AC-3) Standard&quot;, section 5.4.
== License ==

AC3 was covered by patents that expired in March 2017. Patents were used to ask to pay a commercial license to publish an application that decodes AC3. This led some audio app developers to ban AC3 from their apps, although the open source VLC media player supported AC-3 audio without having paid a patent license fee.

In Dolby&#x27;s 2005 original and amended S-1 filings with the SEC, Dolby acknowledged that &quot;Patents relating to our Dolby Digital technologies expire between 2008 and 2017.&quot;

The last patent covering AC-3 expired March 20, 2017, rendering it free to use.

=== Open source implementation ===
A free ATSC A/52 (AC3) stream decoder, liba52, is available under the GNU General Public License. FFmpeg and the VLC media player each include code for handling AC-3.

<text>In Greek mythology, Oenopion (Ancient Greek: , &quot;Oinopíōn&quot;, English translation: &quot;wine drinker&quot;, &quot;wine-rich&quot; or &quot;wine face&quot;) was a legendary king of Chios, and was said to have brought winemaking to the island, which was assigned to him by Rhadamanthys.

==Family==
Oenopion was the son of the Cretan princess Ariadne by Dionysus. He was born on Lemnos. His brothers were Thoas, Staphylus, Latromis, Euanthes, and Tauropolis.

By Queen Helike, Oenopion had one daughter, called either Merópē, or Aërō by Parthenius. He also had several sons, namely Melas, Talus, Maron, Euanthes, Salagus and Athamas, who all sailed with him to Chios from Crete.

== Mythology ==
The most well known story of Oenopion is the one that deals with him receiving the famous giant hunter Orion as a guest, with Orion&#x27;s subsequent attempt to violate his daughter. The story differs somewhat in different ancient sources; what follows is Hesiod&#x27;s version. For the details, see Orion.

Orion walked to Chios over the Aegean, and Oenopion welcomed him with a banquet; Orion got drunk and assaulted Merope. In revenge, Oenopion stabbed out Orion&#x27;s eyes, and then threw him off the island. Hephaestus took pity on the blind Orion and gave him his servant Cedalion as a guide. Cedalion guided him east, where the rising sun restored Orion&#x27;s sight. Orion then decided to kill Oenopion, but the Chians had built the king an underground fortress, and Orion couldn&#x27;t find him. (Other sources say it was an iron fortress, built by Hephaestus.) Orion then went to Crete.

<text>:&quot;Nyctimus&quot; is also a spider genus (Thomisidae)

In Greek mythology, Nyctimus (Ancient Greek: Νύκτιμος &quot;Nyktimos&quot;) was an Arcadian prince and the youngest of the 50 sons of the impious King Lycaon either by the naiad Cyllene, Nonacris or by an unknown woman.

== Family ==
Nyctimus was the father of Periphetes, ancestor of Psophis, one of the possible eponyms for the city of Psophis. This can be explained by the following genealogical link: Nyctimus–Periphetes–Parthaon–Aristas–Erymanthus–Arrhon–Psophis.

== Mythology ==
Nyctimus&#x27; role in the death of Lycaon varies from source to source. One version tells that he was killed and served up as part of a feast to Zeus; and was later brought back to life. Another story claims that he was the only son of Lycaon to survive the blast of thunderbolts of Zeus as a result of the interference of Gaia, who quickly laid hold of his right hand and so appeased his wrath. In both versions, Nyctimus succeeds his father as king of Arcadia. His rule was short-lived, however, due to floods in the age of Deucalion, which some speculate was caused by the impiety of his brothers. 

According to Pausanias, Arcadia increased in the number on both of its cities and population and Nyktimos who was the eldest son of Lycaon possessed all the power while his other brothers founded cities on the sites they considered best.

== Interpretation ==
Some scholars identify Lycaon with Zeus Lycaeus, Zeus in his role as god of light, who slays Nyctimus (the dark), or is succeeded by him, in allusion to the perpetual succession of night and day. 

The succession of Nyctimus to the throne of Arcadia was explained by Sir James George Frazier in his notes to Apollodorus&#x27; &quot;The Library&quot;:

:... we may conjecture that among the ancient Greeks or their ancestors inheritance was at one time regulated by the custom of ultimogeniture or the succession of the youngest, as to which see Folk-Lore in the Old Testament, i.429ff. In the secluded highlands of Arcadia, where ancient customs and traditions lingered long, King Lycaon is said to have been succeeded by his youngest son [i.e. Nyctimus].&quot;

<text>In Greek mythology, Oenotrus () was the youngest of fifty sons of Lycaon from Arcadia. Together with his brother Peucetius (), he migrated to the Italian Peninsula, dissatisfied because of the division of Peloponnesus among the fifty brothers by their father Lycaon. According to the Greek and Roman traditions, this was the first expedition dispatched from Greece to found a colony, long before the Trojan War. He was the likely eponym of Oenotria (), giving his name to the Italian peninsula, especially the Southern Pass (modern Calabria).

<text>The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), operated by the United States&#x27; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)&#x27;s National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service division, supports weather forecasting, severe storm tracking, and meteorology research. Spacecraft and ground-based elements of the system work together to provide a continuous stream of environmental data. The National Weather Service (NWS) and the Meteorological Service of Canada use the GOES system for their North American weather monitoring and forecasting operations, and scientific researchers use the data to better understand land, atmosphere, ocean, and climate dynamics.

The GOES system uses geosynchronous equatorial satellites that, since the launch of SMS-1 in 1974, have been a basic element of U.S. weather monitoring and forecasting.

The procurement, design, and manufacture of GOES satellites is overseen by NASA.

NOAA is the official provider of both GOES terrestrial data and GOES space weather data. Data can also be accessed using the SPEDAS software.

==History==
The first GOES satellite, GOES-1, was launched in October 1975. Two more followed, launching almost two minutes short of a year apart, on 16 June 1977 and 1978 respectively. Prior to the GOES satellites two Synchronous Meteorological Satellites (SMS) satellites had been launched; SMS-1 in May 1974, and SMS-2 in February 1975. The SMS-derived satellites were spin-stabilized spacecraft, which provided imagery through a Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer, or VISSR. The first three GOES satellites used a Philco-Ford bus developed for the earlier Synchronous Meteorological Satellites (SMS) generation.

Following the three SMS GOES spacecraft, five satellites were procured from Hughes, which became the first generation GOES satellites. Four of these reached orbit, with GOES-G being lost in a launch failure.
The next five GOES satellites were constructed by Space Systems/Loral, under contract to NASA. The imager and sounder instruments were produced by ITT Aerospace/Communication Division. GOES-8 and -9 were designed to operate for three years, while -10, -11 and -12 have expected lifespans of five years. GOES-11 and -12 were launched carrying enough fuel for ten years of operation, in the event that they survived beyond their expected lifespan.

A contract to develop four third-generation GOES satellites was awarded to Hughes Corporation, with the satellites scheduled for launch on Delta III rockets between 2002 and 2010. After a merger with Hughes, Boeing took over the development contracts, with launches transferred to the Delta IV, following the Delta III&#x27;s retirement. The contract for the fourth satellite, GOES-Q, was later cancelled. The first third-generation satellite, GOES-13, was launched in May 2006, originally serving as an on-orbit backup. However, in April 2010, GOES-12 was moved to South America coverage and GOES-13 was moved to the GOES-East role. Third generation satellites have an expected lifespan of seven years, but will carry excess fuel to allow them to operate for longer if possible, as with the last two-second generation satellites.

The fourth-generation satellites, the GOES-R series, were built by Lockheed Martin using the A2100 satellite bus. The GOES-R series is a four-satellite program (GOES-R, -S, -T and -U) intended to extend the availability of the operational GOES satellite system through 2036. GOES-R launched on 19 November 2016. It was renamed GOES-16 upon reaching orbit. Second of the series GOES-S, was launched on 1 March 2018. It was renamed GOES-17 upon reaching orbit.

==Satellites==
===Operationally available===
Four GOES satellites are available for operational use.

GOES-14 is in storage at 105° W. The launch of this satellite, which was designated GOES-O before orbiting, was delayed several times. It was launched successfully on 27 June 2009 from Space Launch Complex 37, on a Delta IV Medium rocket, a Delta IV M+ (4,2). It underwent Post-Launch Testing until December 2009 and then was placed in on-orbit storage. This satellite is a part of the GOES-N Series. GOES-14 has been and will be activated should another GOES satellite suffer a problem or be decommissioned. It was temporarily designated GOES-East because of technical difficulties with GOES-13 and moved towards the GOES-East location. After resolution of those problems, GOES-14 was returned to storage.

GOES-15, which was designated GOES-P before orbiting, was launched successfully on 4 March 2010, on a Delta IV M+ (4,2). From 2011 to 2018, it occupied the GOES-West position at 135°W over the Pacific Ocean. It moved eastward to 128° W beginning on 29 October 2018 in order to make room for GOES-17, which took over the GOES-West position on 10 December 2018. GOES-15 operated in tandem with GOES-17 for some time, but was retired in early 2020 and moved to a parking orbit. GOES-15 was temporarily returned to operational status in August 2020 to fill a gap in the sensor capabilities of GOES-17 due to a hardware issue.

GOES-16 occupies the GOES-East position at 75° W. This satellite, which was designated GOES-R before orbiting, was launched by an Atlas V 541 rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on 19 November 2016. It underwent Post-Launch Testing through early 2017 before replacing GOES-13 as GOES-East.

GOES-17 occupies the GOES-West position at 137.2° W. The satellite, designated as GOES-S before orbiting, was launched by an Atlas V 541 rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 on 1 March 2018. Following post-launch testing and troubleshooting of a problem in its imager, the satellite was declared operational in February 2019.

===Inactive or repurposed===
Several GOES satellites are still in orbit but are either inactive or have been re-purposed.

Although GOES-3 ceased to be used for weather operations in 1989, it spent over 20 years as a critical part of communications between the U.S. and Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station before being decommissioned in 2016. Geostationary satellites expend fuel to keep themselves stationary over the equator, and thus cannot normally ordinarily be seen from the poles. When that fuel is depleted, solar and lunar perturbations increase the satellite&#x27;s inclination so that its ground track begins to describe an analemma (a figure-8 in the north–south direction). This usually ends the satellite&#x27;s primary mission. However, when the inclination is high enough the satellite may begin to rise above the polar horizons at the extremes of the figure-8, as was the case for GOES-3. A nine-meter dish was constructed at the station, and communication with the satellite could be obtained for about five hours per day. Data rates were around 2.048 megabytes/second (bi-directional) under optimum conditions.

GOES-8, which was designated GOES-I before orbiting, was the GOES-East satellite when it was in operation. It is in a parking orbit and is drifting westerly at a rate of about 4° daily. It was decommissioned on 1 April 2003 and deactivated on 5 May 2004 after the failure of its propulsion system.

GOES-10, which was designated GOES-K before orbiting, was decommissioned on 2 December 2009 and was boosted to a graveyard orbit. It no longer had the fuel for required maneuvers to keep it on station.

GOES-11, which was designated GOES-L before orbiting, had a partial failure on 6 December 2011. It was decommissioned on 16 December 2011 and boosted into a graveyard orbit.

GOES-12, which was designated GOES-M before orbiting, was decommissioned on 16 August 2013 and boosted into a graveyard orbit.

GOES-13, which was designated GOES-N before orbiting, was decommissioned on 3 January 2018 and boosted into storage orbit. It was transferred to the U.S. Space Force and positioned at 61.5ºE under the new name EWS-G1. Following three years of monitoring the Indian Ocean, EWS-G1 was retired on 31 October 2023 when EWS-G2 (formerly GOES-15) took over.

GOES-15, which was designated GOES-P before orbiting, was launched successfully on 4 March 2010. From 2011 to 2018, it occupied the GOES-West position at 135°W over the Pacific Ocean. It moved eastward to 128° W beginning on 29 October 2018 in order to make room for GOES-17, which took over the GOES-West position on 10 December 2018. GOES-15 operated in tandem with GOES-17 for some time, but was retired in early 2020 and moved to a parking orbit. GOES-15 was temporarily returned to operational status in August 2020 to fill a gap in the sensor capabilities of GOES-17 due to a hardware issue. Like GOES-13, GOES-15 was then transferred to the U.S. Space Force and renamed EWS-G2 to monitor the Indian Ocean until approximately 2030.

==Purpose==
Designed to operate in geostationary orbit above the Earth, the GOES spacecraft continuously view the continental United States, the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, Central America, South America, and southern Canada. The three-axis, body-stabilized design enables the sensors to &quot;stare&quot; at the Earth and thus more frequently image clouds, monitor the Earth&#x27;s surface temperature and water vapour fields, and sound the atmosphere for its vertical thermal and vapor structures. The evolution of atmospheric phenomena can be followed, ensuring real-time coverage of meteorological events such as severe local storms and tropical cyclones. The importance of this capability was proven during hurricanes Hugo (1989) and Andrew (1992).

The GOES spacecraft also enhance operational services and improve support for atmospheric science research, numerical weather prediction models, and environmental sensor design and development.

Satellite data is broadcast on the L-band, and received at the NOAA Command and Data Acquisition ground station at Wallops Island, Virginia from which it is disseminated to users. Additionally, anyone may receive data directly from the satellites by utilizing a small dish, and processing the data with special software.

The GOES satellites are controlled from the Satellite Operations Control Center in Suitland, Maryland. During significant weather or other events, the normal schedules can be altered to provide the coverage requested by the NWS and other agencies.

GOES-12 and above also have provided a platform for the Solar X-Ray Imager (SXI) and space environment monitoring (SEM) instruments.

The SXI provides high-cadence monitoring of large scale solar structures to support the Space Environment Services Center&#x27;s (SESC) mission. The SXI unit on GOES-13, however, was damaged by a solar flare in 2006. The SESC, as the nation&#x27;s &quot;space weather&quot; service, receives, monitors, and interprets a wide variety of solar-terrestrial data. It also issues reports, alerts, and forecasts for special events such as solar flares or geomagnetic storms. This information is important to the operation of military and civilian radio wave and satellite communication and navigation systems. The information also is important to electric power networks, the missions of geophysical explorers, Space Station astronauts, high-altitude aviators, and scientific researchers.

The SEM measures the effect of the Sun on the near-Earth solar-terrestrial electromagnetic environment, providing real-time data to the SESC.

==Payload==
The main mission of a GOES satellite is carried out by the primary payload instruments, which are the Imager and the Sounder. The Imager is a multichannel instrument that senses infrared radiant energy and visible reflected solar energy from the Earth&#x27;s surface and atmosphere. The Sounder provides data for vertical atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles, surface and cloud top temperature, and ozone distribution.

GOES also offers the &quot;Data Collection System&quot;, a ground-based meteorological platform satellite data collection and relay service.
Other instruments on board the spacecraft are the SEM set, which consists of a magnetometer, an X-ray sensor, a high energy proton and alpha particle detector, and an energetic particles sensor.

The GOES-N series (GOES-13 through GOES-15) spacecraft also have a sun-pointed extreme ultraviolet sensor.

In addition, the GOES satellites carry a search and rescue repeater that collects data from Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacons and Emergency Locator Transmitter beacons, which are used during search-and-rescue operations by the U.S. Air Force Rescue Coordination Center.

===GOES-R Series===
The proposed instrument package for the GOES-R series initially included the following:

* Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI)
* Hyperspectral Environmental Suite (HES)
* Space Environment In-Situ Suite (SEISS), which includes two Magnetospheric Particle Sensors (MPS-HI and MPS-LO), an Energetic Heavy Ion Sensor, and a Solar and Galactic Proton Sensor
* Solar Imaging Suite, which includes the Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI), the Solar X-Ray Sensor (XRS), and the Extreme Ultraviolet Sensor (EUVS)
* Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM)
* Magnetometer

In September 2006, the HES was cancelled.

==Satellite designations==
Before being launched, GOES satellites are designated by letters (A, B, C, etc.). Once a GOES satellite is launched successfully, it is redesignated with a number (1, 2, 3, etc.). So, GOES-A to GOES-F became GOES-1 to GOES-6. Because GOES-G was a launch failure, it never received a number. GOES-H to GOES-R became GOES-7 to GOES-16 (skipping GOES-Q, which was not built).

Once operational, the different locations used by the satellites are given a name corresponding to the regions they cover. These are GOES-East and GOES-West, which watch the eastern and western halves of the U.S., respectively. GOES-East is occupied by GOES-16, while GOES-West is occupied by GOES-17. The -East/-West designation is used more frequently than the satellite&#x27;s number designation. GOES-IO (Indian Ocean), a new designation revealed in early May 2020, is currently occupied by GOES-13 (DOD-1).

There was also a GOES-South position, which is meant to provide dedicated coverage of South America. Before the GOES-R series became operational, unless a satellite was dedicated to this continent, imagery of South America was updated every 3 hours instead of every 30 minutes. The GOES-South station was usually assigned to older satellites whose North American operations have been taken over by new satellites. For example, GOES-10 was moved from the GOES-West position to GOES-South after it was replaced in the -West station by GOES-11. When GOES-10 was decommissioned on 1 December 2009, GOES-South was taken over by GOES-12. Since the retirement of GOES-12 on 16 August 2013, the GOES-South station has been unoccupied. GOES-16 has since made the need for a dedicated GOES-South satellite obsolete; as of 2019, the satellite produces full disk images every 10 minutes.

==Development of GOES-R Series==
In September 2006, NOAA reduced the planned number of GOES-R satellites from four to two because of cost overrun concerns. The planned delivery schedule was also slowed down to reduce costs. The expected cost of the series is $7.69 billion, a $670 million increase from the prior $7 billion estimate.

The contract for constructing the satellites and manufacturing the magnetometer, SUVI, and GLM was awarded to Lockheed Martin. This award was challenged by losing bidder Boeing; however, the protest was subsequently dismissed.

The ABI instrument was delivered by L3Harris (formerly ITT Exelis). The SEISS was delivered by Assurance Technology Corporation.

XRS and EUVS are being combined into the Extreme Ultra Violet and X-Ray Irradiance Sensors (EXIS), which was delivered by the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics of the University of Colorado.

The contract for the ground system, including data processing, was awarded to a team led by the Weather Systems division of L3Harris, including subcontracts to Boeing, Atmospheric and Environmental Research (AER), Honeywell, Carr Astronautics, Wyle Laboratories, and Ares.

==Status of GOES satellites==
GOES spacecraft have been manufactured by Boeing (GOES-D through -H and GOES-N through -P) and Space Systems/Loral (GOES-A through -C and GOES-I through -M). The GOES-I series (I-M) and the GOES-N series (N-P) are documented in the &quot;GOES I–M Databook&quot; and the &quot;GOES-N Series Databook&quot;, respectively. The GOES-R series was built by Lockheed Martin with the first and second in the series, GOES-16 and -17, declared operational in early 2019. Following an equipment failure on GOES-17, it was replaced by GOES-18 in January 2023, with the former taken out of service to act as a backup.

Boeing would have built and launched GOES-Q only if GOES-O or GOES-P had failed to be delivered on-orbit in good working order.

<text>A gear or gearwheel is a rotating machine part typically used to transmit rotational motion and/or torque by means of a series of teeth that engage with compatible teeth of another gear or other part. The teeth can be integral saliences or cavities machined on the part, or separate pegs inserted into it. In the latter case, the gear is usually called a cogwheel. A cog may be one of those pegs or the whole gear. Two or more meshing gears are called a gear train. 

The smaller member of a pair of meshing gears is often called pinion. Most commonly, gears and gear trains can be used to trade torque for rotational speed between two axles or other rotating parts and/or to change the axis of rotation and/or to invert the sense of rotation. A gear may also be used to transmit linear force and/or linear motion to a rack, a straight bar with a row of compatible teeth. 
Gears are among the most common mechanical parts. They come in a great variety of shapes and materials, and are used for many different functions and applications. Diameters may range from a few μm in micromachines, to a few mm in watches and toys to over 10 metres in some mining equipment. Other types of parts that are somewhat similar in shape and function to gears include the sprocket, which is meant to engage with a link chain instead of another gear, and the timing pulley, meant to engage a timing belt. Most gears are round and have equal teeth, designed to operate as smoothly as possible; but there are several applications for non-circular gears, and the Geneva drive has an extremely uneven operation, by design.

Gears can be seen as instances of the basic lever &quot;machine&quot;. When a small gear drives a larger one, the mechanical advantage of this ideal lever causes the torque &quot;T&quot; to increase but the rotational speed &quot;ω&quot; to decrease. The opposite effect is obtained when a large gear drives a small one. The changes are proportional to the &quot;gear ratio&quot; &quot;r&quot;, the ratio of the tooth counts: namely, , and . Depending on the geometry of the pair, the sense of rotation may also be inverted (from clockwise to anti-clockwise, or vice versa).

Most vehicles have a transmission or &quot;gearbox&quot; containing a set of gears that can be meshed in multiple configurations. The gearbox lets the operator vary the torque that is applied to the wheels without changing the engine&#x27;s speed. Gearboxes are used also in many other machines, such as lathes and conveyor belts. In all those cases, terms like &quot;first gear&quot;, &quot;high gear&quot;, and &quot;reverse gear&quot; refer to the overall torque ratios of different meshing configurations, rather than to specific physical gears. These terms may be applied even when the vehicle does not actually contain gears, as in a continuously variable transmission.

==History==

The earliest surviving gears date from the 4th century BC in China (Zhan Guo times – Late East Zhou dynasty), which have been preserved at the Luoyang Museum of Henan Province, China.
In Europe, Aristotle mentions gears around 330 BC, as wheel drives in windlasses. He observed that the direction of rotation is reversed when one gear wheel drives another gear wheel. Philon of Byzantium was one of the first who used gears in water raising devices. Gears appear in works connected to Hero of Alexandria, in Roman Egypt circa AD 50, but can be traced back to the mechanics of the Library of Alexandria in 3rd-century BC Ptolemaic Egypt, and were greatly developed by the Greek polymath Archimedes (287–212 BC). The earliest surviving gears in Europe were found in the Antikythera mechanism an example of a very early and intricate geared device, designed to calculate astronomical positions of the sun, moon, and planets, and predict eclipses. Its time of construction is now estimated between 150 and 100 BC.
The Chinese engineer Ma Jun (–265) described a south-pointing chariot. A set of differential gears connected to the wheels and to a pointer on top of the chariot kept the direction of latter unchanged as the chariot turned.

Another early surviving example of geared mechanism is a complex calendrical device showing the phase of the Moon, the day of the month and the places of the Sun and the Moon in the Zodiac was invented in the Byzantine empire in the early 6th century.

Geared mechanical water clocks were built in China by 725.

Around 1221, a geared astrolabe was built in Isfahan showing the position of the moon in the zodiac and its phase, and the number of days since new moon.

The worm gear was invented in the Indian subcontinent, for use in roller cotton gins, some time during the 13th–14th centuries.

A complex astronomical clock, called the Astrarium, was built between 1348 and 1364 by Giovanni Dondi dell&#x27;Orologio. It had seven faces and 107 moving parts; it showed the positions of the sun, the moon and the five planets then known, as well as religious feast days. The Salisbury Cathedral clock, built in 1386, it is the world&#x27;s oldest still working geared mechanical clock.

Differential gears were used by the British clock maker Joseph Williamson in 1720.

However, the oldest functioning gears by far were created by Nature, and are seen in the hind legs of the nymphs of the planthopper insect &quot;Issus coleoptratus&quot;.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;gear&quot; is probably from Old Norse &quot;gørvi&quot; (plural &quot;gørvar&quot;) &#x27;apparel, gear,&#x27; related to &quot;gøra&quot;, &quot;gørva&quot; &#x27;to make, construct, build; set in order, prepare,&#x27; a common verb in Old Norse, &quot;used in a wide range of situations from writing a book to dressing meat&quot;. In this context, the meaning of &#x27;toothed wheel in machinery&#x27; first attested 1520s; specific mechanical sense of &#x27;parts by which a motor communicates motion&#x27; is from 1814; specifically of a vehicle (bicycle, automobile, etc.) by 1888.

A &quot;cog&quot; is a tooth on a wheel. From Middle English cogge, from Old Norse (compare Norwegian &quot;kugg&quot; (&#x27;cog&#x27;), Swedish &quot;kugg&quot;, &quot;kugge&quot; (&#x27;cog, tooth&#x27;)), from Proto-Germanic *&quot;kuggō&quot; (compare Dutch &quot;kogge&quot; (&#x27;cogboat&#x27;), German &quot;Kock&quot;), from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;gugā&quot; (&#x27;hump, ball&#x27;) (compare Lithuanian &quot;gugà&quot; (&#x27;pommel, hump, hill&#x27;), from PIE *&quot;gēw-&quot; (&#x27;to bend, arch&#x27;). First used c. 1300 in the sense of &#x27;a wheel having teeth or cogs; late 14c., &#x27;tooth on a wheel&#x27;; cog-wheel, early 15c.

==Materials==

The gears of the Antikythera mechanism are made of bronze, and the earliest surviving Chinese gears are made of iron, These metals, as well as tin, have been generally used for clocks and similar mechanisms to this day.

Historically, large gears, such as used in flour mills, were commonly made of wood rather than metal. They were cogwheels, made by inserting a series of wooden pegs or cogs around the rim of a wheel. The cogs were often made of maple wood. 

Wooden gears have been gradually replaced by ones made or metal, such as cast iron at first, then steel and aluminum. Steel is most commonly used because of its high strength-to-weight ratio and low cost. Aluminum is not as strong as steel for the same geometry, but is lighter and easier to machine. powder metallurgy may be used with alloys that cannot be easily cast or machined.
Still, because of cost or other considerations, some early metal gears had wooden cogs, each tooth forming a type of specialised &#x27;through&#x27; mortise and tenon joint 

More recently engineering plastics and composite materials have been replacing metals in many applications, especially those with moderate speed and torque. They are not as strong as steel, but are cheaper, can be mass-manufactured by injection molding, and don&#x27;t need lubrication. Plastic gears can even be intentionally designed to be the weakest part in a mechanism, so that in case of jamming they will fail first and thus avoid damage to more expensive parts. Such &quot;sacrificial&quot; gears may be a simpler alternative to other overload-protection devices such as clutches and torque-limited or current-limited motors.
In spite of the advantages of metal and plastic, wood continued to be used for large gears until a couple of centuries ago, because of cost, weight, tradition, or other considerations. In 1967 the Thompson Manufacturing Company of Lancaster, New Hampshire still had a very active business in supplying tens of thousands of maple gear teeth per year, mostly for use in paper mills and grist mills, some dating back over 100 years. 

==Manufacture==
The most common techniques for gear manufacturing are dies, sand, and investment casting; injection molding; powder metallurgy; blanking; and gear cutting.
As of 2014, an estimated 80% of all gearing produced worldwide is produced by net shape molding. Molded gearing is usually powder metallurgy, plastic injection, or metal die casting. Gears produced by powder metallurgy often require a sintering step after they are removed from the mold. Cast gears require gear cutting or other machining to shape the teeth to the necessary precision. The most common form of gear cutting is hobbing, but gear shaping, milling, and broaching may be used instead. 

Metal gears intended for heavy duty operation, such as in the transmissions of cars and trucks, the teeth are heat treated to make them hard and more wear resistant while leaving the core soft but tough. For large gears that are prone to warp, a quench press is used.

Gears can be made by 3D printing; however, this alternative is typically used only for prototypes or very limited production quantities, because of its high cost, low accuracy, and relatively low strength of the resulting part.

==Comparison with other drive mechanisms==
Besides gear trains, other alternative methods of transmitting torque between non-coaxial parts include link chains driven by sprockets, friction drives, belts and pulleys, hydraulic couplings, and timing belts. 

One major advantage of gears is that their rigid body and the snug interlocking of the teeth ensure precise tracking of the rotation across the gear train, limited only by backlash and other mechanical defects. For this reason they are favored in precision applications such as watches. Gear trains also can have fewer separate parts (only two) and have minimal power loss, minimal wear, and long life. Gears are also often the most efficient and compact way of transmitting torque between two non-parallel axes. 

On the other hand, gears are more expensive to manufacture, may require periodic lubrication, and may have greater mass and rotational inertia than the equivalent pulleys. More importantly, the distance between the axes of matched gears is limited and cannot be changed once they are manufactured. There are also applications where slippage under overload or transients (as occurs with belts, hydraulics, and friction wheels) is not only acceptable but desirable.

== Ideal gear model ==

For basic analysis purposes, each gear can be idealized as a perfectly rigid body that, in normal operation, turns around a &quot;rotation axis&quot; that is fixed in space, without sliding along it. Thus, each point of the gear can move only along a circle that is perpendicular to its axis and centered on it. At any moment &quot;t&quot;, all points of the gear will be rotating around that axis with the same angular speed &quot;ω&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), in the same sense. The speed need not be constant over time.

The &quot;action surface&quot; of the gear consists of all points of its surface that, in normal operation, may contact the matching gear with positive pressure. All other parts of the surface are irrelevant (except that they cannot be crossed by any part of the matching gear). In a gear with &quot;N&quot; teeth, the working surface has &quot;N&quot;-fold rotational symmetry about the axis, meaning that it is congruent with itself when the gear rotates by of a turn. 

If the gear is meant to transmit or receive torque with a definite sense only (clockwise or counterclockwise with respect to some reference viewpoint), the action surface consists of &quot;N&quot; separate patches, the &quot;tooth faces&quot;; which have the same shape and are positioned in the same way relative to the axis, spaced turn apart. 

If the torque on each gear may have both senses, the action surface will have two sets of &quot;N&quot; tooth faces; each set will be effective only while the torque has one specific sense, and the two sets can be analyzed independently of the other. However, in this case the gear usually has also &quot;flip over&quot; symmetry, so that the two sets of tooth faces are congruent after the gear is flipped. This arrangement ensures that the two gears are firmly locked together, at all times, with no backlash.

During operation, each point &quot;p&quot; of each tooth face will at some moment contact a tooth face of the matching gear at some point &quot;q&quot; of one of its tooth faces. At that moment and at those points, the two faces must have the same perpendicular direction but opposite orientation. But since the two gears are rotating around different axes, the points &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are moving along different circles; therefore, the contact cannot last more than one instant, and &quot;p&quot; will then either slide across the other face, or stop contacting it altogether. 

On the other hand, at any given moment there is at least one such pair of contact points; usually more than one, even a whole line or surface of contact.

Actual gears deviate from this model in many ways: they are not perfectly rigid, their mounting does not ensure that the rotation axis will be perfectly fixed in space, the teeth may have slightly different shapes and spacing, the tooth faces are not perfectly smooth, and so on. Yet, these deviations from the ideal model can be ignored for a basic analysis of the operation of a gear set.

== Relative axis position ==

One criterion for classifying gears is the relative position and direction of the axes or rotation of the gears that are to be meshed together.

===Parallel===
In the most common configuration, the axes of rotation of the two gears are parallel, and usually their sizes are such that they contact near a point between the two axes. In this configuration, the two gears turn in opposite senses.

Occasionally the axes are parallel but one gear is nested inside the other. In this configuration, both gears turn in the same sense.

If the two gears are cut by an imaginary plane perpendicular to the axes, each section of one gear will interact only with the corresponding section of the other gear. Thus the three-dimensional gear train can be understood as a stack of gears that are flat and infinitesimally thin — that is, essentially two-dimensional.

===Crossed===

In a &quot;crossed&quot; arrangement, the axes of rotation of the two gears are not parallel but cross at an arbitrary angle except zero or 180 degrees.

For best operation, each wheel then must be a bevel gear, whose overall shape is like a slice (frustum) of a cone whose apex is the meeting point of the two axes.

Bevel gears with equal numbers of teeth and shaft axes at 90 degrees are called &quot;miter&quot; (US) or &quot;mitre&quot; (UK) gears.

Independently of the angle between the axes, the larger of two unequal matching bevel gears may be internal or external, depending the desired relative sense of rotation.

If the two gears are sliced by an imaginary sphere whose center is the point where the two axes cross, each section will remain on the surface of that sphere as the gear rotates, and the section of one gear will interact only with the corresponding section of the other gear. In this way, a pair of meshed 3D gears can be understood as a stack of nested infinitely thin cup-like gears.

===Skew===
The gears in a matching pair are said to be &quot;skew&quot; if their axes of rotation are skew lines -- neither parallel nor intersecting.

In this case, the best shape for each pitch surface is neither cylindrical nor conical but a portion of a hyperboloid of revolution. Such gears are called &quot;hypoid&quot; for short. Hypoid gears are most commonly found with shafts at 90 degrees. 

Contact between hypoid gear teeth may be even smoother and more gradual than with spiral bevel gear teeth, but also have a sliding action along the meshing teeth as it rotates and therefore usually require some of the most viscous types of gear oil to avoid it being extruded from the mating tooth faces, the oil is normally designated HP (for hypoid) followed by a number denoting the viscosity. Also, the pinion can be designed with fewer teeth than a spiral bevel pinion, with the result that gear ratios of 60:1 and higher are feasible using a single set of hypoid gears. This style of gear is most common in motor vehicle drive trains, in concert with a differential. Whereas a regular (nonhypoid) ring-and-pinion gear set is suitable for many applications, it is not ideal for vehicle drive trains because it generates more noise and vibration than a hypoid does. Bringing hypoid gears to market for mass-production applications was an engineering improvement of the 1920s. 

== Tooth orientation ==
===Internal and external===
A gear is said to be &quot;external&quot; if its teeth are directed generally away from the rotation axis, and &quot;internal&quot; otherwise. In a pair of matching wheels, only one of them (the larger one) may be internal.
===Crown===
A &quot;crown gear&quot; or &quot;contrate gear&quot; is one whose teeth project at right angles to the plane. A crown gear is also sometimes meshed with an escapement such as found in mechanical clocks.
==Tooth cut direction==
Gear teeth typically extend across the whole thickness of the gear. Another criterion for classifying gears is the general direction of the teeth across that dimension. This attribute is affected by the relative position and direction of the axes or rotation of the gears that are to be meshed together.

===Straight===

In a cylindrical &quot;spur gear&quot; or &quot;straight-cut gear&quot;, the tooth faces are straight along the direction parallel to the axis of rotation. Any imaginary cylinder with the same axis will cut the teeth along parallel straight lines. 

The teeth can be either internal or external. Two spur gears mesh together correctly only if fitted to parallel shafts. No axial thrust is created by the tooth loads. Spur gears are excellent at moderate speeds but tend to be noisy at high speeds. 

For arrangements with crossed non-parallel axes, the faces in a straight-cut gear are parts of a general conical surface whose generating lines (&quot;generatrices&quot;) go through the meeting point of the two axes, resulting in a bevel gear. Such gears are generally used only at speeds below , or, for small gears, 1000 rpm.
===Helical===
In a &quot;helical&quot; or &quot;dry fixed&quot; gear the tooth walls are not parallel to the axis of rotation, but are set at an angle. An imaginary pitch surface (cylinder, cone, or hyperboloid, depending on the relative axis positions) intersects each tooth face along an arc of a helix. Helical gears can be meshed in &quot;parallel&quot; or orientations. The former refers to when the shafts are parallel to each other; this is the most common orientation. In the latter, the shafts are non-parallel, and in this configuration the gears are sometimes known as &quot;skew gears&quot;.
The angled teeth engage more gradually than do spur gear teeth, causing them to run more smoothly and quietly. With parallel helical gears, each pair of teeth first make contact at a single point at one side of the gear wheel; a moving curve of contact then grows gradually across the tooth face to a maximum, then recedes until the teeth break contact at a single point on the opposite side. In spur gears, teeth suddenly meet at a line contact across their entire width, causing stress and noise. Spur gears make a characteristic whine at high speeds. For this reason spur gears are used in low-speed applications and in situations where noise control is not a problem, and helical gears are used in high-speed applications, large power transmission, or where noise abatement is important. The speed is considered high when the pitch line velocity exceeds 25 m/s.

A disadvantage of helical gears is a resultant thrust along the axis of the gear, which must be accommodated by appropriate thrust bearings. However, this issue can be circumvented by using a herringbone gear or &quot;double helical gear&quot;, which has no axial thrust - and also provides self-aligning of the gears. This results in less axial thrust than a comparable spur gear.

A second disadvantage of helical gears is a greater degree of sliding friction between the meshing teeth, often addressed with additives in the lubricant.

For a &quot;crossed&quot; or &quot;skew&quot; configuration, the gears must have the same pressure angle and normal pitch; however, the helix angle and handedness can be different. The relationship between the two shafts is actually defined by the helix angle(s) of the two shafts and the handedness, as defined:
:formula_1 for gears of the same handedness,
:formula_2 for gears of opposite handedness,
where formula_3 is the helix angle for the gear. The crossed configuration is less mechanically sound because there is only a point contact between the gears, whereas in the parallel configuration there is a line contact.

Quite commonly, helical gears are used with the helix angle of one having the negative of the helix angle of the other; such a pair might also be referred to as having a right-handed helix and a left-handed helix of equal angles. The two equal but opposite angles add to zero: the angle between shafts is zero—that is, the shafts are &quot;parallel&quot;. Where the sum or the difference (as described in the equations above) is not zero, the shafts are &quot;crossed&quot;. For shafts &quot;crossed&quot; at right angles, the helix angles are of the same hand because they must add to 90 degrees. (This is the case with the gears in the illustration above: they mesh correctly in the crossed configuration: for the parallel configuration, one of the helix angles should be reversed. The gears illustrated cannot mesh with the shafts parallel.)

* 3D animation of helical gears (crossed axis)

===Double helical===
Double helical gears overcome the problem of axial thrust presented by single helical gears by using a double set of teeth, slanted in opposite directions. A double helical gear can be thought of as two mirrored helical gears mounted closely together on a common axle. This arrangement cancels out the net axial thrust, since each half of the gear thrusts in the opposite direction, resulting in a net axial force of zero. This arrangement can also remove the need for thrust bearings. However, double helical gears are more difficult to manufacture due to their more complicated shape.

Herringbone gears are a special type of helical gears. They do not have a groove in the middle like some other double helical gears do; the two mirrored helical gears are joined so that their teeth form a V shape. This can also be applied to bevel gears, as in the final drive of the Citroën Type A. Another type of double helical gear is a Wüst gear.

For both possible rotational directions, there exist two possible arrangements for the oppositely-oriented helical gears or gear faces. One arrangement is called stable, and the other unstable. In a stable arrangement, the helical gear faces are oriented so that each axial force is directed toward the center of the gear. In an unstable arrangement, both axial forces are directed away from the center of the gear. In either arrangement, the total (or &quot;net&quot;) axial force on each gear is zero when the gears are aligned correctly. If the gears become misaligned in the axial direction, the unstable arrangement generates a net force that may lead to disassembly of the gear train, while the stable arrangement generates a net corrective force. If the direction of rotation is reversed, the direction of the axial thrusts is also reversed, so a stable configuration becomes unstable, and vice versa.

Stable double helical gears can be directly interchanged with spur gears without any need for different bearings.
===Worm===


&quot;Worms&quot; resemble screws. A worm is meshed with a &quot;worm wheel&quot;, which looks similar to a spur gear.

Worm-and-gear sets are a simple and compact way to achieve a high torque, low speed gear ratio. For example, helical gears are normally limited to gear ratios of less than 10:1 while worm-and-gear sets vary from 10:1 to 500:1. A disadvantage is the potential for considerable sliding action, leading to low efficiency.

A worm gear is a species of helical gear, but its helix angle is usually somewhat large (close to 90 degrees) and its body is usually fairly long in the axial direction. These attributes give it screw like qualities. The distinction between a worm and a helical gear is that at least one tooth persists for a full rotation around the helix. If this occurs, it is a &#x27;worm&#x27;; if not, it is a &#x27;helical gear&#x27;. A worm may have as few as one tooth. If that tooth persists for several turns around the helix, the worm appears, superficially, to have more than one tooth, but what one in fact sees is the same tooth reappearing at intervals along the length of the worm. The usual screw nomenclature applies: a one-toothed worm is called &quot;single thread&quot; or &quot;single start&quot;; a worm with more than one tooth is called &quot;multiple thread&quot; or &quot;multiple start&quot;. The helix angle of a worm is not usually specified. Instead, the lead angle, which is equal to 90 degrees minus the helix angle, is given.

In a worm-and-gear set, the worm can always drive the gear. However, if the gear attempts to drive the worm, it may or may not succeed. Particularly if the lead angle is small, the gear&#x27;s teeth may simply lock against the worm&#x27;s teeth, because the force component circumferential to the worm is not sufficient to overcome friction. In traditional music boxes, however, the gear drives the worm, which has a large helix angle. This mesh drives the speed-limiter vanes which are mounted on the worm shaft.

Worm-and-gear sets that do lock are called self locking, which can be used to advantage, as when it is desired to set the position of a mechanism by turning the worm and then have the mechanism hold that position. An example is the machine head found on some types of stringed instruments.

If the gear in a worm-and-gear set is an ordinary helical gear only a single point of contact is achieved. If medium to high power transmission is desired, the tooth shape of the gear is modified to achieve more intimate contact by making both gears partially envelop each other. This is done by making both concave and joining them at a saddle point; this is called a cone-drive or &quot;Double enveloping&quot;.

Worm gears can be right or left-handed, following the long-established practice for screw threads.
==Tooth profile==
Another criterion to classify gears is the &quot;tooth profile&quot;, the shape of the cross-section of a tooth face by an imaginary cut perpendicular to the pitch surface, such as the transverse, normal, or axial plane. 

The tooth profile is crucial for the smoothness and uniformity of the movement of matching gears, as well as for the friction and wear.

=== Artisanal ===
The teeth of antique or artisanal gears that were cut by hand from sheet material, like those in the Antikhytera mechanism, generally had simple profiles, such as triangles.
The teeth of larger gears — such as used in windmills — were usually pegs with simple shapes like cylinders, parallelepipeds, or triangular prisms inserted into a smooth wooden or metal wheel; or were holes with equally simple shapes cut into such a wheel. 

Because of their sub-optimal profile, the effective gear ratio of such artisanal matching gears was not constant, but fluctuated over each tooth cycle, resulting in vibrations, noise, and accelerated wear.

=== Cage ===
A &quot;cage gear&quot;, also called a &quot;lantern gear&quot; or &quot;lantern pinion&quot;, is one of those artisanal gears having cylindrical rods for teeth, parallel to the axle and arranged in a circle around it, much as the bars on a round bird cage or lantern. The assembly is held together by disks at each end, into which the tooth rods and axle are set. Cage gears are more efficient than solid pinions, and dirt can fall through the rods rather than becoming trapped and increasing wear. They can be constructed with very simple tools as the teeth are not formed by cutting or milling, but rather by drilling holes and inserting rods.

Sometimes used in clocks, a cage gear should always be driven by a gearwheel, not used as the driver. The cage gear was not initially favoured by conservative clock makers. It became popular in turret clocks where dirty working conditions were most commonplace. Domestic American clock movements often used them. 

=== Mathematical ===

In most modern gears, the tooth profile is usually not straight or circular, but of special form designed to achieve a constant angular velocity ratio. 

There is an infinite variety of tooth profiles that will achieve this goal. In fact, given a fairly arbitrary tooth shape, it is possible to develop a tooth profile for the mating gear that will do it. 

==== Parallel and crossed axes ====

However, two constant velocity tooth profiles are the most commonly used in modern times for gears with parallel or crossed axes, based on the &quot;cycloid&quot; and &quot;involute&quot; curves. 

Cycloidal gears were more common until the late 1800s. Since then, the involute has largely superseded it, particularly in drive train applications. The cycloid is in some ways the more interesting and flexible shape; however the involute has two advantages: it is easier to manufacture, and it permits the center-to-center spacing of the gears to vary over some range without ruining the constancy of the velocity ratio. Cycloidal gears only work properly if the center spacing is exactly right. Cycloidal gears are still commonly used in mechanical clocks.

==== Skew axes ====
For non-parallel axes with non-straight tooth cuts, the best tooth profile is one of several spiral bevel gear shapes. These include Gleason types (circular arc with non-constant tooth depth), Oerlikon and Curvex types (circular arc with constant tooth depth), Klingelnberg Cyclo-Palloid (Epicycloid with constant tooth depth) or Klingelnberg Palloid. 

The tooth faces in these gear types are not involute cylinders or cones but patches of octoidal surfaces. Manufacturing such tooth faces may require a 5-axis milling machine.

Spiral bevel gears have the same advantages and disadvantages relative to their straight-cut cousins as helical gears do to spur gears, such as lower noise and vibration. Simplified calculated bevel gears on the basis of an equivalent cylindrical gear in normal section with an involute tooth form show a deviant tooth form with reduced tooth strength by 10-28% without offset and 45% with offset.

== Special gear trains ==

===Rack and pinion===

A &quot;rack&quot; is a toothed bar or rod that can be thought of as a sector gear with an infinitely large radius of curvature. Torque can be converted to linear force by meshing a rack with a round gear called a &quot;pinion&quot;: the pinion turns, while the rack moves in a straight line. Such a mechanism is used in the steering of automobiles to convert the rotation of the steering wheel into the left-to-right motion of the tie rod(s) that are attached to the front wheels.

Racks also feature in the theory of gear geometry, where, for instance, the tooth shape of an interchangeable set of gears may be specified for the rack (infinite radius), and the tooth shapes for gears of particular actual radii are then derived from that. The rack and pinion gear type is also used in a rack railway.
===Epicyclic gear train===

In epicyclic gearing, one or more of the gear axes moves. Examples are sun and planet gearing (see below), cycloidal drive, automatic transmissions, and mechanical differentials.
====Sun and planet====

Sun and planet gearing is a method of converting reciprocating motion into rotary motion that was used in steam engines. James Watt used it on his early steam engines to get around the patent on the crank, but it also provided the advantage of increasing the flywheel speed so Watt could use a lighter flywheel.

In the illustration, the sun is yellow, the planet red, the reciprocating arm is blue, the flywheel is green and the driveshaft is gray.

==Non-circular gears==

Non-circular gears are designed for special purposes. While a regular gear is optimized to transmit torque to another engaged member with minimum noise and wear and maximum efficiency, a non-circular gear&#x27;s main objective might be ratio variations, axle displacement oscillations and more. Common applications include textile machines, potentiometers and continuously variable transmissions.
== Non-rigid gears ==

Most gears are ideally rigid bodies which transmit torque and movement through the lever principle and contact forces between the teeth. Namely, the torque applied to one gear causes it to rotate as rigid body, so that its teeth push against those of the matched gear, which in turn rotates as a rigid body transmitting the torque to its axle. Some specialized gear escape this pattern, however.

===Harmonic gear===
A &quot;harmonic gear&quot; or &quot;strain wave gear&quot; is a specialized gearing mechanism often used in industrial motion control, robotics and aerospace for its advantages over traditional gearing systems, including lack of backlash, compactness and high gear ratios.

Though the diagram does not demonstrate the correct configuration, it is a &quot;timing gear,&quot; conventionally with far more teeth than a traditional gear to ensure a higher degree of precision.
===Magnetic gear===

In a &quot;magnetic gear&quot; pair there is no contact between the two members; the torque is instead transmitted through magnetic fields. The cogs of each gear are constant magnets with periodic alternation of opposite magnetic poles on mating surfaces. Gear components are mounted with a backlash capability similar to other mechanical gearings. Although they cannot exert as much force as a traditional gear due to limits on magnetic field strength, such gears work without touching and so are immune to wear, have very low noise, minimal power losses from friction and can slip without damage making them very reliable. They can be used in configurations that are not possible for gears that must be physically touching and can operate with a non-metallic barrier completely separating the driving force from the load. The magnetic coupling can transmit force into a hermetically sealed enclosure without using a radial shaft seal, which may leak. Magnetic gears are also used in brushless motors along with electromagnets to make the motor spin.

==Nomenclature==
===General===

; Rotational frequency, &quot;n&quot; : Measured in rotation over time, such as revolutions per minute (RPM or rpm).
; Angular frequency, &quot;ω&quot; : Measured in radians per second. 1RPM = 2rad/minute = rad/second.
; Number of teeth, &quot;N&quot; : How many teeth a gear has, an integer. In the case of worms, it is the number of thread starts that the worm has.
; Gear, wheel : The larger of two interacting gears or a gear on its own.
; Pinion : The smaller of two interacting gears.
; Path of contact : Path followed by the point of contact between two meshing gear teeth.
; Line of action, pressure line : Line along which the force between two meshing gear teeth is directed. It has the same direction as the force vector. In general, the line of action changes from moment to moment during the period of engagement of a pair of teeth. For involute gears, however, the tooth-to-tooth force is always directed along the same line—that is, the line of action is constant. This implies that for involute gears the path of contact is also a straight line, coincident with the line of action—as is indeed the case.
; Axis : Axis of revolution of the gear; center line of the shaft.
; Pitch point : Point where the line of action crosses a line joining the two gear axes.
; Pitch circle, pitch line : Circle centered on and perpendicular to the axis, and passing through the pitch point. A predefined diametral position on the gear where the circular tooth thickness, pressure angle and helix angles are defined.
; Pitch diameter, &quot;d&quot;: A predefined diametral position on the gear where the circular tooth thickness, pressure angle and helix angles are defined. The standard pitch diameter is a design dimension and cannot be measured, but is a location where other measurements are made. Its value is based on the number of teeth (&quot;N&quot;), the normal module (&quot;mn&quot;; or normal diametral pitch, &quot;Pd&quot;), and the helix angle (formula_4):
:: formula_5 in metric units or formula_6 in imperial units.
; Module or modulus, &quot;m&quot;: Since it is impractical to calculate circular pitch with irrational numbers, mechanical engineers usually use a scaling factor that replaces it with a regular value instead. This is known as the &quot;module&quot; or &quot;modulus&quot; of the wheel and is simply defined as:
::formula_7
: where &quot;m&quot; is the module and &quot;p&quot; the circular pitch. The units of module are customarily millimeters; an &quot;English Module&quot; is sometimes used with the units of inches. When the diametral pitch, DP, is in English units,
:: formula_8 in conventional metric units.
: The distance between the two axis becomes:
:: formula_9
: where a is the axis distance, &quot;z&quot;1 and &quot;z&quot;2 are the number of cogs (teeth) for each of the two wheels (gears). These numbers (or at least one of them) is often chosen among primes to create an even contact between every cog of both wheels, and thereby avoid unnecessary wear and damage. An even uniform gear wear is achieved by ensuring the tooth counts of the two gears meshing together are relatively prime to each other; this occurs when the greatest common divisor (GCD) of each gear tooth count equals 1, e.g. GCD(16,25)=1; if a 1:1 gear ratio is desired a relatively prime gear may be inserted in between the two gears; this maintains the 1:1 ratio but reverses the gear direction; a second relatively prime gear could also be inserted to restore the original rotational direction while maintaining uniform wear with all 4 gears in this case. Mechanical engineers, at least in continental Europe, usually use the module instead of circular pitch. The module, just like the circular pitch, can be used for all types of cogs, not just evolvent based straight cogs.
; Operating pitch diameters : Diameters determined from the number of teeth and the center distance at which gears operate. Example for pinion:
:: formula_10
; Pitch surface : In cylindrical gears, cylinder formed by projecting a pitch circle in the axial direction. More generally, the surface formed by the sum of all the pitch circles as one moves along the axis. For bevel gears it is a cone.
; Angle of action : Angle with vertex at the gear center, one leg on the point where mating teeth first make contact, the other leg on the point where they disengage.
; Arc of action : Segment of a pitch circle subtended by the angle of action.
; Pressure angle, &quot;θ&quot; : The complement of the angle between the direction that the teeth exert force on each other, and the line joining the centers of the two gears. For involute gears, the teeth always exert force along the line of action, which, for involute gears, is a straight line; and thus, for involute gears, the pressure angle is constant.
; Outside diameter, &quot;Do&quot; : Diameter of the gear, measured from the tops of the teeth.
; Root diameter : Diameter of the gear, measured at the base of the tooth.
; Addendum, &quot;a&quot; : Radial distance from the pitch surface to the outermost point of the tooth. formula_11
; Dedendum, &quot;b&quot; : Radial distance from the depth of the tooth trough to the pitch surface. formula_12
; Whole depth, &quot;ht&quot; : The distance from the top of the tooth to the root; it is equal to addendum plus dedendum or to working depth plus clearance.
; Clearance : Distance between the root circle of a gear and the addendum circle of its mate.
; Working depth : Depth of engagement of two gears, that is, the sum of their operating addendums.

:: formula_14 in imperial units
; Base circle : In involute gears, the tooth profile is generated by the involute of the base circle. The radius of the base circle is somewhat smaller than that of the pitch circle

; Interchangeable set : A set of gears, any of which mates properly with any other

===Helical gear===
; Helix angle, &quot;ψ&quot; : the Angle between a tangent to the helix and the gear axis. It is zero in the limiting case of a spur gear, albeit it can be considered as the hypotenuse angle as well.
; Normal circular pitch, &quot;pn&quot; : Circular pitch in the plane normal to the teeth.
; Transverse circular pitch, &quot;p&quot; : Circular pitch in the plane of rotation of the gear. Sometimes just called &quot;circular pitch&quot;.
::formula_15

Several other helix parameters can be viewed either in the normal or transverse planes. The subscript &quot;n&quot; usually indicates the normal.

===Worm gear===
; Lead : Distance from any point on a thread to the corresponding point on the next turn of the same thread, measured parallel to the axis.
; Linear pitch, &quot;p&quot; : Distance from any point on a thread to the corresponding point on the adjacent thread, measured parallel to the axis. For a single-thread worm, lead and linear pitch are the same.
; Lead angle, &quot;λ&quot; : Angle between a tangent to the helix and a plane perpendicular to the axis. Note that the complement of the helix angle is usually given for helical gears.
; Pitch diameter, &quot;dw&quot; : Same as described earlier in this list. Note that for a worm it is still measured in a plane perpendicular to the gear axis, not a tilted plane.

; Point of contact : Any point at which two tooth profiles touch each other.
; Line of contact : A line or curve along which two tooth surfaces are tangent to each other.
; Path of action : The locus of successive contact points between a pair of gear teeth, during the phase of engagement. For conjugate gear teeth, the path of action passes through the pitch point. It is the trace of the surface of action in the plane of rotation.

; Arc of recess, &quot;Qr&quot; : The arc of the pitch circle through which a tooth profile moves from contact at the pitch point until contact ends.
; Contact ratio, &quot;mc&quot; or &quot;ε&quot; : The number of angular pitches through which a tooth surface rotates from the beginning to the end of contact.

; Face advance : Distance on a pitch circle through which a helical or spiral tooth moves from the position at which contact begins at one end of the tooth trace on the pitch surface to the position where contact ceases at the other end.

===Tooth thickness===
; Circular thickness : Length of arc between the two sides of a gear tooth, on the specified .
; Transverse circular thickness : Circular thickness in the transverse plane.
; Normal circular thickness : Circular thickness in the normal plane. In a helical gear it may be considered as the length of arc along a normal helix.
; Axial thickness: In helical gears and worms, tooth thickness in an axial cross section at the standard pitch diameter.
; Base circular thickness: In involute teeth, length of arc on the base circle between the two involute curves forming the profile of a tooth.
; Normal chordal thickness: Length of the chord that subtends a circular thickness arc in the plane normal to the pitch helix. Any convenient measuring diameter may be selected, not necessarily the standard pitch diameter.
; Chordal addendum (chordal height) : Height from the top of the tooth to the chord subtending the circular thickness arc. Any convenient measuring diameter may be selected, not necessarily the standard pitch diameter.
; Profile shift : Displacement of the basic rack from the reference cylinder, made non-dimensional by dividing by the normal module. It is used to specify the tooth thickness, often for zero backlash.
; Rack shift : Displacement of the tool datum line from the reference cylinder, made non-dimensional by dividing by the normal module. It is used to specify the tooth thickness.
; Measurement over pins : Measurement of the distance taken over a pin positioned in a tooth space and a reference surface.

As long as the measuring device has parallel measuring surfaces that contact on an unmodified portion of the involute, the measurement wis along a line tangent to the base cylinder. It is used to determine tooth thickness.

; Long and short-addendum teeth : Teeth in which the addendums of two engaging gears are unequal.

; Undercut : An undercut is a condition in generated gear teeth when any part of the fillet curve lies inside of a line drawn tangent to the working profile at its point of juncture with the fillet. Undercut may be deliberately introduced to facilitate finishing operations. With undercut the fillet curve intersects the working profile. Without undercut the fillet curve and the working profile have a common tangent.
; Root fillet : or fillet curve, the concave portion of the tooth profile where it joins the bottom of the tooth space.2

===Pitch===
Pitch is the distance between a point on one tooth and the corresponding point on an adjacent tooth. It is a dimension measured along a line or curve in the transverse, normal, or axial directions. The use of the single word &quot;pitch&quot; without qualification may be ambiguous, and for this reason it is preferable to use specific designations such as transverse circular pitch, normal base pitch, axial pitch.

; Circular pitch, &quot;p&quot; : Arc distance along a specified pitch circle or pitch line between corresponding profiles of adjacent teeth.
; Transverse circular pitch, &quot;p&quot;t : Circular pitch in the transverse plane.
; Normal circular pitch, &quot;p&quot;n, &quot;p&quot;e : Circular pitch in the normal plane, and also the length of the arc along the normal pitch helix between helical teeth or threads.
; Axial pitch, &quot;p&quot;x : Linear pitch in an axial plane and in a pitch surface. In helical gears and worms, axial pitch has the same value at all diameters. In gearing of other types, axial pitch may be confined to the pitch surface and may be a circular measurement. The term axial pitch is preferred to the term linear pitch. The axial pitch of a helical worm and the circular pitch of its worm gear are the same.
; Normal base pitch, &quot;p&quot;N, &quot;p&quot;bn :An involute helical gear is the base pitch in the normal plane. It is the normal distance between parallel helical involute surfaces on the plane of action in the normal plane, or is the length of arc on the normal base helix. It is a constant distance in any helical involute gear.
; Transverse base pitch, &quot;p&quot;b, &quot;p&quot;bt : In an involute gear, the pitch is on the base circle or along the line of action. Corresponding sides of involute gear teeth are parallel curves, and the base pitch is the constant and fundamental distance between them along a common normal in a transverse plane.
; Diametral pitch (transverse), &quot;P&quot;d : Ratio of the number of teeth to the standard pitch diameter in inches.
:: formula_19
; Normal diametral pitch, &quot;P&quot;nd : Value of diametral pitch in a normal plane of a helical gear or worm.
:: formula_20
; Angular pitch, &quot;θ&quot;N, &quot;τ&quot; : Angle subtended by the circular pitch, usually expressed in radians.
:: formula_21 degrees or formula_22 radians

==Backlash==
Backlash is the error in motion that occurs when gears change direction. It exists because there is always some gap between the trailing face of the driving tooth and the leading face of the tooth behind it on the driven gear, and that gap must be closed before force can be transferred in the new direction. The term &quot;backlash&quot; can also be used to refer to the size of the gap, not just the phenomenon it causes; thus, one could speak of a pair of gears as having, for example, &quot;0.1 mm of backlash.&quot; A pair of gears could be designed to have zero backlash, but this would presuppose perfection in manufacturing, uniform thermal expansion characteristics throughout the system, and no lubricant. Therefore, gear pairs are designed to have some backlash. It is usually provided by reducing the tooth thickness of each gear by half the desired gap distance. In the case of a large gear and a small pinion, however, the backlash is usually taken entirely off the gear and the pinion is given full sized teeth. Backlash can also be provided by moving the gears further apart. The backlash of a gear train equals the sum of the backlash of each pair of gears, so in long trains backlash can become a problem.

For situations that require precision, such as instrumentation and control, backlash can be minimized through one of several techniques. For instance, the gear can be split along a plane perpendicular to the axis, one half fixed to the shaft in the usual manner, the other half placed alongside it, free to rotate about the shaft, but with springs between the two-halves providing relative torque between them, so that one achieves, in effect, a single gear with expanding teeth. Another method involves tapering the teeth in the axial direction and letting the gear slide in the axial direction to take up slack.

==Standard pitches and the module system==
Although gears can be made with any pitch, for convenience and interchangeability standard pitches are frequently used. Pitch is a property associated with linear dimensions and so differs whether the standard values are in the imperial (inch) or metric systems. Using &quot;inch&quot; measurements, standard diametral pitch values with units of &quot;per inch&quot; are chosen; the &quot;diametral pitch&quot; is the number of teeth on a gear of one inch pitch diameter. Common standard values for spur gears are 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64, 72, 80, 96, 100, 120, and 200. Certain standard pitches such as &#x27; and &#x27; in inch measurements, which mesh with linear rack, are actually (linear) &quot;circular pitch&quot; values with units of &quot;inches&quot;

When gear dimensions are in the metric system the pitch specification is generally in terms of module or &quot;modulus&quot;, which is effectively a length measurement across the &quot;pitch diameter&quot;. The term module is understood to mean the pitch diameter in millimetres divided by the number of teeth. When the module is based upon inch measurements, it is known as the &quot;English module&quot; to avoid confusion with the metric module. Module is a direct dimension (&quot;millimeters per tooth&quot;), unlike diametral pitch, which is an inverse dimension (&quot;teeth per inch&quot;). Thus, if the pitch diameter of a gear is 40 mm and the number of teeth 20, the module is 2, which means that there are 2 mm of pitch diameter for each tooth. The preferred standard module values are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40 and 50.

==Gear model in modern physics==
Modern physics adopted the gear model in different ways. In the nineteenth century, James Clerk Maxwell developed a model of electromagnetism in which magnetic field lines were rotating tubes of incompressible fluid. Maxwell used a gear wheel and called it an &quot;idle wheel&quot; to explain the electric current as a rotation of particles in opposite directions to that of the rotating field lines.

More recently, quantum physics uses &quot;quantum gears&quot; in their model. A group of gears can serve as a model for several different systems, such as an artificially constructed nanomechanical device or a group of ring molecules.

The three wave hypothesis compares the wave–particle duality to a bevel gear.

==Gear mechanism in natural world==

The gear mechanism was previously considered exclusively artificial, but as early as 1957, gears had been recognized in the hind legs of various species of planthoppers and scientists from the University of Cambridge characterized their functional significance in 2013 by doing high-speed photography of the nymphs of &quot;Issus coleoptratus&quot; at Cambridge University. These gears are found only in the nymph forms of all planthoppers, and are lost during the final molt to the adult stage. In &quot;I. coleoptratus&quot;, each leg has a 400-micrometer strip of teeth, pitch radius 200 micrometers, with 10 to 12 fully interlocking spur-type gear teeth, including filleted curves at the base of each tooth to reduce the risk of shearing. The joint rotates like mechanical gears, and synchronizes &quot;Issus&#x27;s&quot; hind legs when it jumps to within 30 microseconds, preventing yaw rotation. The gears are not connected all the time. One is located on each of the juvenile insect&#x27;s hind legs, and when it prepares to jump, the two sets of teeth lock together. As a result, the legs move in almost perfect unison, giving the insect more power as the gears rotate to their stopping point and then unlock.

<text>In Greek mythology, Laothoe (Ancient Greek: Λαοθόη) can refer to the following women:

*Laothoe, consort of King Porthaon of Calydon and mother of Sterope, Stratonice and Eurythemiste.
*Laothoe or Antianeira, daughter of Menetus (Meretus), mother of the Argonauts Erytus (Eurytus) and Echion by Hermes.
*Laothoe, a Thespian princess as one of the 50 daughters of King Thespius and Megamede or by one of his many wives. When Heracles hunted and ultimately slayed the Cithaeronian lion, Laothoe with her other sisters, except for one, all laid with the hero in a night, a week or for 50 days as what their father strongly desired it to be. Laothoe bore Heracles a son, Antiphus.
*Laothoe, mother of Thestor by Idmon.
*Laothoe, a consort of Priam, king of Troy, and mother of Lycaon and sometimes Polydorus. Her father was Altes, king of the Leleges.
*Laothoe, wife of the Trojan elder Clytius.

<text>&quot;For people with the surname, see Altès (surname).&quot;

In Greek mythology, Altes was a Lelegian king who resided at Pedasus, which was situated in or near the Troad. According to Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad,&quot; Altes was the father of Laothoe, one of the many wives of King Priam. In other accounts, Altes is also said to be the father of the Argonaut Ancaeus of Samos; perhaps because this Ancaeus was also of Lelegian stock. The parentage of Altes is not given by the ancient mythographers.

<text>Loren Wilber Acton (born 7 March 1936) is an American physicist who flew on Space Shuttle mission STS-51-F as a Payload Specialist for the Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory. He is also the father of Cheryll Glotfelty, a leading ecocritic.

== Early life and education ==
Acton was born in Lewistown, Montana. He received a bachelor of science degree in Engineering Physics from Montana State University in 1959, and a Doctor of Philosophy in astrophysics from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1965.

== Career ==
Acton was a senior staff scientist with the Space Sciences Laboratory, Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory, California. As a research scientist, his principal duties included conducting scientific studies of the Sun and other celestial objects using advanced space instruments and serving as a co-investigator on one of the Spacelab 2 solar experiments, the Solar Optical Universal Polarimeter. He was selected as one of four payload specialists for Spacelab 2 on August 9, 1978, and after seven years of training he flew on STS-51-F/ Spacelab-2 in 1985. At mission conclusion, Acton had travelled over 2.8 million miles in 126 Earth orbits, logging over 190 hours in space.

Acton is married and has two children. In 2006 he ran in an election to be the state representative of Montana&#x27;s District 69, as a Democratic candidate. In the event, he lost to the Republican incumbent, Jack M. Wells of Belgrade.

Acton is currently a retired Research Professor of Physics at Montana State University, where he was responsible for the formation of the Solar Physics group and the Space Science and Engineering Laboratory. The MSU solar group carries on an active research program under NASA and NSF support and is actively involved in day-to-day operation and scientific utilization of satellite missions for studies of the Sun. Acton was a principal investigator for Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) experiment on the Japan/US/UK Yohkoh mission The Yohkoh mission focused on the study of high-energy solar processes, such as solar flares, eruptions and the heating of the corona. The primary emission of the extremely hot outer atmosphere of the Sun, the solar corona, is at X-ray wavelengths. The extended duration, high resolution, X-ray imagery from Yohkoh contribute to the study of why the Sun has a corona at all and why it varies in intensity so strongly in response to the 11-year sunspot cycle.

<doc id="82921" wikidata="Q592312" url="?curid=82921" title="Disk image">
<text>A disk image is a snapshot of a storage device&#x27;s structure and data typically stored in one or more computer files on another storage device. 

Traditionally, disk images were bit-by-bit copies of every sector on a hard disk often created for digital forensic purposes, but it is now common to only copy allocated data to reduce storage space. Compression and deduplication are commonly used to reduce the size of the image file set. 

Disk imaging is done for a variety of purposes including forensics, cloud computing, system administration, as part of a backup strategy, and legacy emulation as part of a digital preservation strategy. 
Despite the benefits of disk imaging the storage costs can be high, management can be difficult and they can be time consuming to create.

Disk images can be made in a variety of formats depending on the purpose. Virtual disk images (such as VHD and VMDK) are intended to be used for cloud computing, ISO images are intended to emulate optical media, such as a CD-ROM. Raw disk images are used for forensic purposes. Proprietary formats are typically used by disk imaging software.

==Background==

Disk images were originally (in the late 1960s) used for backup and disk cloning of mainframe disk media. Early ones were as small as 5 megabytes and as large as 330 megabytes, and the copy medium was magnetic tape, which ran as large as 200 megabytes per reel. Disk images became much more popular when floppy disk media became popular, where replication or storage of an exact structure was necessary and efficient, especially in the case of copy protected floppy disks.

Disk image creation is called disk imaging and is often time consuming, even with a fast computer, because the entire disk must be copied. Typically, disk imaging requires a third party disk imaging program or backup software. The software required varies according to the type of disk image that needs to be created. For example, RawWrite and WinImage create floppy disk image files for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows. In Unix or similar systems the dd program can be used to create raw disk images. Apple Disk Copy can be used on Classic Mac OS and macOS systems to create and write disk image files.

Authoring software for CDs/DVDs such as Nero Burning ROM can generate and load disk images for optical media. A &quot;virtual disk writer&quot; or &quot;virtual burner&quot; is a computer program that emulates an actual disc authoring device such as a CD writer or DVD writer. Instead of writing data to an actual disc, it creates a virtual disk image. A virtual burner, by definition, appears as a disc drive in the system with writing capabilities (as opposed to conventional disc authoring programs that can create virtual disk images), thus allowing software that can burn discs to create virtual discs.

==Uses==
===Digital forensics===
Forensic imaging is the process of creating a bit-by-bit copy of the data on the drive, including files, metadata, volume information, filesystems and their structure. Often, these images are also hashed to verify their integrity and that they have not been altered since being created. Unlike disk imaging for other purposes, digital forensic applications take a bit-by-bit copy to ensure forensic soundness. The purposes of imaging the disk is to not only discover evidence preserved in digital information but also to examine the drive to gather clues of how the crime was committed.

===Virtualization===
Creating a virtual disk image of optical media or a hard disk drive is typically done to make the content available to one or more virtual machines. Virtual machines emulate a CD/DVD drive by reading an ISO image. This can also be faster than reading from the physical optical medium. Further, there are less issues with wear and tear. A hard disk drive or solid-state drive in a virtual machine is implemented as a disk image (i.e. either the VHD format used by Microsoft&#x27;s Hyper-V, the VDI format used by Oracle Corporation&#x27;s VirtualBox, the VMDK format used for VMware virtual machines, or the QCOW format used by QEMU). Virtual hard disk images tend to be stored as either a collection of files (where each one is typically 2GB in size), or as a single file. Virtual machines treat the image set as a physical drive.

=== Rapid deployment of systems ===
Educational institutions and businesses can often need to buy or replace computer systems in large numbers. Disk imaging is commonly used to rapidly deploy the same configuration across workstations. Disk imaging software is used to create an image of a completely-configured system (such an image is sometimes called a golden image). This image is then written to a computer&#x27;s hard disk (which is sometimes described as restoring an image). 

==== Network-based image deployment ====
Image restoration can be done using network-based image deployment. This method uses a PXE server to boot an operating system over a computer network that contains the necessary components to image or restore storage media in a computer. This is usually used in conjunction with a DHCP server to automate the configuration of network parameters including IP addresses. Multicasting, broadcasting or unicasting tend to be used to restore an image to many computers simultaneously. These approaches do not work well if one or more computers experience packet loss. As a result, some imaging solutions use the BitTorrent protocol to overcome this problem.

Network-based image deployment reduces the need to maintain and update individual systems manually. Imaging is also easier than automated setup methods because an administrator does not need to have knowledge of the prior configuration to copy it. 

===Backup strategy===

A disk image contains all files and data (i.e., file attributes and the file fragmentation state). For this reason, it is also used for backing up optical media (CDs and DVDs, etc.), and allows the exact and efficient recovery after experimenting with modifications to a system or virtual machine. Typically, disk imaging can be used to quickly restore an entire system to an operational state after a disaster.

===Digital preservation===
Libraries and museums are typically required to archive and digitally preserve information without altering it in any manner. Emulators frequently use disk images to emulate floppy disks that have been preserved. This is usually simpler to program than accessing a real floppy drive (particularly if the disks are in a format not supported by the host operating system), and allows a large library of software to be managed. Emulation also allows existing disk images to be put into a usable form even though the data contained in the image is no longer readable without emulation.

== Limitations ==
Disk imaging is time consuming, the space requirements are high and reading from them can be slower than reading from the disk directly because of a performance overhead. 

Other limitations can be the lack of access to software required to read the contents of the image. For example, prior to Windows 8, third party software was required to mount disk images. When imaging multiple computers with only minor differences, much data is duplicated unnecessarily, wasting space.

=== Speed and failure ===
Disk imaging can be slow, especially for older storage devices. A typical 4.7 GB DVD can take an average of 18 minutes to duplicate. Floppy disks read and write much slower than hard disks. Therefore, despite their small size, it can take several minutes to copy a single disk. In some cases, disk imaging can fail due to bad sectors or physical wear and tear on the source device. Unix utilities (such as dd) are not designed to cope with failures, causing the disk image creation process to fail. When data recovery is the end goal, it is instead recommended to use more specialised tools (such as ddrescue).

<text>In Greek mythology, Olenus (; Ancient Greek: Ὤλενος &quot;Olenos&quot;) was the name of several individuals:

*Olenus, son of Hephaestus and father of Helice and Aex, two nurses of infant Zeus. A city in Aulis was named for him.
*Olenus, son of Zeus and Anaxithea (or Hippodamia), daughter of Danaus. He was the eponymous ruler of the city Olenus in Achaea. Olenus was succeeded by Crinacus (Crineus), another bastard son of Zeus.
*Olenus, father of Tectaphus, a Lapith.
*Olenus, a man who lived on Mount Ida. His wife Lethaea claimed she was more beautiful than any goddess. They were both turned to stone; although Olenus could have avoided this fate, he chose to be with his wife.
*Olenus, a Lelegian, father of Phoceus. His son was killed by the Argonauts.
