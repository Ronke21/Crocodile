<text>In Greek mythology, Hypsipyle () was a queen of Lemnos, and the daughter of King Thoas of Lemnos, and the granddaughter of Dionysus and Ariadne. When the women of Lemnos killed all the males on the island, Hypsipyle saved her father Thoas. She ruled Lemnos when the Argonauts visited the island, and had two sons by Jason, the leader of the Argonauts. Later the women of Lemnos discovered that Thoas had been saved by Hypsipyle and she was sold as a slave to Lycurgus, the king of Nemea, where she became the nurse of the king&#x27;s infant son Opheltes, who was killed by a serpent while in her care. She is eventually freed from her servitude by her sons.

==Family==
Hypsipyle&#x27;s father was Thoas, who was the son of Dionysus and Ariadne. According to the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Hypsipyle was the mother, by Jason, of Euneus. Later sources say that Hypsipyle had, in addition to Euneus, a second son by Jason. In Euripides&#x27; partially preserved play &quot;Hypsipyle&quot;, she and Jason had twin sons: Euneus and Thoas. According to Apollodorus, the second son was Nebrophonus, while according to Hyginus, the second son was Deipylus, Ovid says simply that Hypsipyle bore Jason twins, without naming them.

==The Lemnian crime and the rescue of Thoas==
The women of Lemnos killed all the males on the island, except for Thoas, who was saved by Hypsipyle. Traces of the story can be found in the &quot;Iliad&quot; (c. 8th century), where Lemnos is referred to as the &quot;city of godlike Thoas&quot;, and Euneus, Jason&#x27;s son by Hypsipyle, is mentioned. As early as Aeschylus the story was famous: &quot;the Lemnian holds first place among evils in story: it has long been told with groans as an abominable calamity. Men compare each new horror to Lemnian troubles.&quot; And by the time of the mid-5th-century BC historian Herodotus, the story had given rise to the proverbial phrase &quot;Lemnian crime&quot; used to mean any cruel deed. Aeschylus probably dealt with it in his&#x27; lost tragedies &quot;Hypsipyle&quot; and &quot;Lemniai&quot; (late 6th century-early 5th century BC). The lyric poet Pindar (late 6th century-early 5th century BC) mentions &quot;the race of the Lemnian women, who killed their husbands.&quot;

===&quot;Hypsipyle&quot;===
There is a brief mention of the story in Euripides&#x27; partially preserved play &quot;Hypsipyle&quot; (c. 410 BC), in an exchange between Hypsipyle and her son Euneus:
::Hypsipyle
:Alas, the flight that I fled, my son—if you only knew it—from sea-girt Lemnos, because I did not cut off my father’s grey head!
::Euneus
:Did they really order you to kill your father?
::Hypsipyle
:I am gripped by fear of those evil events—O my son, like Gorgons they slew their husbands in their beds!

===Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27; &quot;Argonautica&quot;===
The earliest extant telling of the story in detail occurs in the 3rd-century BC &quot;Argonautica&quot; by Apollonius of Rhodes. According to this account, the women of Lemnos had long neglected the worship of Aphrodite, and because of this the goddess caused their husbands to spurn them in favor of captive Thracian women. In revenge, the women massacred all the males on the island, except for the &quot;aged&quot; Thoas, whom Hypsipyle put into a &quot;hollow chest,&quot; setting him adrift on the open sea. Fishermen pulled him ashore on the island of Sicinus. The Lemnian women took over all the previous work of the men, cattle-herding, plowing, and warfare.

===Valerius Flaccus&#x27; &quot;Argonautica&quot;===
The 1st-century AD Latin poet Valerius Flaccus, in his &quot;Argonautica&quot;, gives a different reason for Aphrodite (Venus) causing the Lemnian men to reject their wives. He says it was because of the goddess&#x27; anger with her husband, the god Hephaestus (Vulcan)—who had a home on Lemnos—for his having caught her in a tryst with Ares (Mars). He also gives a more detailed account of Thoas&#x27; rescue and escape. During the night of the massacre, Hypsipyle woke Thoas, covered his head, and took him to Dionysus&#x27; temple where she hid him. The next morning, Hypsipyle disguised Thoas as the temples&#x27; cult statue of Dionysus, placed him on the ritual chariot (used to parade the statue). She then took Thoas through the streets of the city, crying aloud that the god&#x27;s statue had been polluted by the night&#x27;s bloody murders, and needed to be cleansed in the sea. By this subterfuge, and with the god Dionysus&#x27; help, Thoas was safely hid outside the city. But fearing discovery, Hypsipyle finds an old abandoned boat, in which Thoas put to sea, eventually reaching the land of the Taurians, where &quot;Diana put a sword in his hand, and didst appoint him warden of thy cheerless altar&quot;. And the women of Lemnos bestow on Hypsipyle &quot;the throne and sceptre of her father as by right&quot;.

===Other accounts===
Other accounts tell similar stories, with variations. According to the 1st-century AD Latin poet Statius, Hypsipyle hid Thoas on a ship, while according to the late 1st-century BC Latin mythographer Hyginus, who identifies Thoas with the Thoas who was the Taurian king, Hypsipyle put Thoas onto a ship which a storm carried to the &quot;island Taurica&quot;.

According to the Greek mythographer Apollodorus (first or second century AD), the women of Lemnos were rejected by their husbands because Aphrodite had caused them to emit a foul odor. Apollodorus also gives a different ending to the story: while Thoas was saved when Hypsipyle hid him, when, sometime later, the Lemnian women discovered that Thoas had escaped the initial slaughter, they killed Thoas, and sold Hypsipyle into slavery.

==Affair with Jason==
The first adventure (usually) of Jason and the Argonauts, on their quest for the Golden Fleece, is their visit to the island of Lemnos, where Hypsipyle was then queen. The story seems at least as old as the &quot;Iliad&quot;, since Euneus is said to be a son of Jason and Hypsipyle, and was dealt with in Aeschylus&#x27; lost tragedies &quot;Hypsipyle&quot; and &quot;Lemniai&quot;, although the only surviving detail is that the Lemnian women &quot;in arms&quot; refused to allow the Argonauts to land until they agreed to mate with them. Pindar refers to the visit, mentioning the Argonauts engaging in athletic contests, receiving garments made by the Lemnian women as prizes, and sharing the women&#x27;s beds. In Sophocles&#x27; lost play &quot;Lemniai&quot;, there was apparently a battle between the Argonauts and the Lemnian women. The story also played a part in Euripides&#x27; partially preserved play &quot;Hypsipyle&quot;, where Hypsipyle is reunited with her twin sons by Jason, Euneus and Thoas, and learns, to her sorrow, of Jason&#x27;s death.

===Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27; &quot;Argonautica&quot;===
The first complete account of the Argonauts encounter with Hypsipyle on Lemnos is given in Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27; &quot;Argonautica&quot;. According to Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27; version of the story, when the Argonauts first arrive, Hypsipyle and the women, fearing that the Argonauts&#x27; were Thracians coming to attack them, put on armour and rush to the beach, to defend their island. However the Argonauts herald Aethalides was able to persuade Hypsipyle to allow the Argonauts to stay for one night on the island.

The next day, sitting on her father&#x27;s throne, Hypsipyle spoke to the assembled women of the Island:
:My friends, come, let us give these men gifts to their liking, such things as men ought to take with them on a ship, provisions and sweet wine, so that they might forever remain outside our walls, lest out of need they may come among us and get to know us all too accurately, and an evil report may travel far and wide. For we have done a terrible deed, and it will not be at all heart-cheering to them either, if they were to learn of it.

However, Hypsipyle&#x27;s old nurse Polyxo said that, rather than live in continual fear of attack, they should take the Argonauts as their mates and protectors. All the women agreed to this plan, and so Hypsipyle received the Argonauts as welcome guests.

Hypsipyle told Jason the Lemnian women&#x27;s story, saying that because of Aphrodite, the men of Lemnos had come to hate their wives, expelling them from their homes, and replacing them with Thracian girls captured on their frequent raids on nearby Thrace. Finally, after enduring terrible hardship, the women found the courage to take action. But Hypsipyle did not tell of the massacre, instead she deceived Jason, saying that one day when the men were returning from a raid, the women refused to allow the men to reenter the city, so the men took their sons and resettled in Thrace. Hypsipyle then asked Jason and his men to stay and take up residence on the island.

So the Argonauts stayed for a while on the island, residing with the women in their homes, including Jason, who lived with Hypsipyle in her palace. But finally, at the urging of Heracles, who had remained apart, the Argonauts agreed to leave the women, and continue their quest for the Golden Fleece.

Hypsipyle told Jason that &quot;her father&#x27;s scepter will be waiting&quot; for him should he return to the island, but that she does not think that he will, and asked him to promise to remember her always, and to tell her what she should do with any children of his she might bear. And Jason told her to send any son, when grown, to Jason&#x27;s parents in Iolcus. Jason took with him a &quot;sacred purple robe&quot;, given to him by Hypsipyle, which had been made by the Graces for Dionysus, who gave it to his son Thoas, who in turn gave it to Hypsipyle.

===Later accounts===

The Roman poets Ovid, Valerius Flaccus, and Statius, all wrote about the affair of Hypsipyle and Jason. Their accounts are all similar to that of Apollonius of Rhodes, with a few variations and additional details.

In his &quot;Heroides&quot; 6, Ovid has Hypsipyle, in an angry letter, rebuke Jason for having forsaken her for Medea, whom she says &quot;intrudes upon my marriage-bed&quot;. She says that Jason spent two years on Lemnos, and that, although he promised her &quot;thine own will I ever be&quot;, and told her of his hope to share in the parenting of their offspring then in her womb, she now knows that Jason has taken up with Medea, and calls all these words of Jason &quot;lies&quot;.

In his &quot;Argonautica&quot;, Valerius Flaccus, when the Argonauts are making ready to leave Lemnos, has a &quot;weeping&quot; Hypsipyle say to Jason: &quot;So quickly, at the first clear sky, dost thou resolve to unfurl thy sails, O dearer to me than mine own father? ... Is it then to the sky and to the waves that hindered thy course that we owed thy tarrying?&quot; She then gives Jason a &quot;tunic of woven handiwork&quot;, and her father&#x27;s sword &quot;with its renowned emblem&quot;, &quot;the flaming gift of Aetna&#x27;s god&quot;, (i.e Vulcan), asking him to &quot;forget not the land that first folded you to its peaceful bosom; and from Colchis&#x27; conquered shores bring back hither thy sails, I pray thee, by this Jason whom thou leavest in my womb.&quot;

Statius in his &quot;Thebaid&quot; has Hypsipyle say that her union with Jason &quot;was not by my will&quot;, calling Jason her &quot;ungentle guest&quot;, and her twin offspring by Jason, &quot;memorials of a forced bed&quot;. She describes Jason as a &quot;brute ... uncaring for his children and pledged word!&quot;.

==Nurse of Opheltes==

Hypsipyle became involved in the story of the infant Opheltes, the Seven against Thebes, and the origin of the Nemean Games. On their way to Thebes, the Seven, in need of water, stop at Nemea, where they encounter Hypsipyle. Because of the discovery of her having saved Thoas, Hypsipyle has been sold into slavery to the parents of Opheltes, becoming his nursemaid. While helping the Seven to get water, Hypsipyle sets Opheltes down, and he is killed by a serpent. The Seven kill the serpent, and the seer Amphiaraus, one of the Seven, renames the child Archemorus, meaning the &quot;Beginning of Doom&quot;, interpreting the child&#x27;s death as a harbinger of the Seven&#x27;s own impending doom at Thebes. The Seven save Hypsipyle from being put to death and hold funeral games in the child&#x27;s honor, which become the origin of the Nemean Games. Hypsipyle&#x27;s sons arrive, compete in the funeral games, and rescue Hypsipyle from her captivity.

===&quot;Hypsipyle&quot;===
The earliest involvement of Hypsipyle in the Opheltes/Archemorus story occurs in Euripides&#x27; &quot;Hypsipyle&quot;, and may well have been an Euripidean invention. After fleeing Lemnos, Hypsipyle was captured by pirates and sold as a slave to Lycurgus, the priest of Zeus at Nemea, where she has become the nurse to Lycurgus and Eurydice&#x27;s son Opheltes.

As the action of the play begins, Hypsipyle&#x27;s twin sons by Jason, Euneus and Thoas, arrive seeking shelter for the night. The sons have been separated from Hypsipyle since infancy, so neither recognizes the other. When Jason left Lemnos he had taken his sons to Colchis. After he died, Jason&#x27;s fellow argonaut Orpheus took the boys to Thrace, where he raised them. They eventually met Hypsipyles&#x27; father Thoas, who took them back to Lemnos. From there they embarked on a search for their mother.

The Seven against Thebes have also just arrived and encounter Hypsipyle. Amphiaraus tells Hypsipyle that they need water for a sacrifice, and she leads the Seven to a spring. Hypsipyle brings Opheltes with her, and somehow, in a moment of neglect, Opheltes is killed by a serpent. The child&#x27;s mother Eurydice is about to have Hypsipyle put to death, when Amphiaraus arrives and Hypsipyle pleads with him to speak in her defense. Amphiaraus tells Euridice that the child&#x27;s death was destined, proposes that funeral games be held in Opheltes&#x27; honor, and is able to convince Euridice to spare Hypsipyle&#x27;s life. Funeral games are held, and Hypsypyle&#x27;s sons participate, as a result of which, a recognition and reunion between Hypsipyle and her sons is effected, who then manage to free Hypsipyle from her servitude.

The surviving fragments of Euripides&#x27; play do not make it clear how the recognition between Hypsipyle and her sons was brought about, but two later accounts may have been based on the play. According to the Second Vatican Mythographer, after the sons won the foot-race, at the funeral games, their names and parents were announced, and in this way their identities were revealed. The Cyzicene epigrams, the third book of the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot;, describes a depiction, on a temple in Cyzicus, of Euneus and Thoas showing Hypsipyle a gold ornament (&quot;the golden vine&quot;) as proof of their identities.

===Hyginus===
According to Hyginus, when the women of Lemnos discovered Hypsipyle&#x27;s deception, they tried to kill her, but, as in Euripides&#x27; play, she fled the island and was captured by pirates who sold her as a slave (although Hyginus&#x27; Latin text—probably in error—says she was sold to &quot;King Lycus&quot;, rather than Lycurgus).

Hyginus also tells of an oracle that had warned that Opheltes should not be put on the ground until he had learned to walk, and says that, to avoid setting the child directly on the ground, she put him on a bed of wild celery where he is killed by a serpent who guarded the spring. Hyginus connects this with the tradition of the celery crowns awarded to the winners at the Nemean games. According to Hyginus, as in Euripides, the Seven intercede on Hypsipyle&#x27;s behalf, but with Lycurgus, rather than Eurydice.

===The &quot;Thebaid&quot;===
Statius, in his epic poem, the &quot;Thebaid&quot;—which tells the story of the Seven against Thebes—preserves the most complete account of the myth of Hypsipyle and Opheltes. As in Hyginus&#x27; account, when the Lemnian women discovered that Thoas had been saved, Hypsipyle fled the island, but was captured by pirates, and sold as a slave to Lycurgus, who is both the king of Nemea (as in Hyginus) and the priest of Zeus (as in Euripides).

As in Euripides, Hypsipyle, who has become the nurse of Lycurgus and Eurydice&#x27;s son Opheltes, encounters the Seven against Thebes, who are in urgent need of water. However in Statius&#x27; account, Hypsipyle does not take Opheltes with her to the spring, instead, in her haste to provide water for the Seven, she leaves the child behind, lying on the ground, &quot;lest she be too slow a guide&quot;. Hypsipyle takes the Seven to the spring, and when they have drunk their fill, they ask Hypsipyle to tell them who she is. Then, over the course of 471 lines of the &quot;Thebaid&quot;, Hypsipyle tells the Seven her story: the massacre of the men by the Lemnian women, her saving her father Thoas, the visit to Lemnos by the Argonauts, her twin sons, Euneus and Thoas, by Jason, and how she came to be the nurse of Opheltes. Meanwhile, with Hypsipyle long delayed at the spring telling her story, and &quot;oblivious (so the gods would have it) of her absent charge&quot;, Opheltes has fallen asleep in the grass, and though unnoticed, he is killed by an unwitting swish of the tail of the enormous serpent who guards Zeus&#x27; sacred grove.

Hypsipyle is again saved, by the Seven, from execution, but here, as in Hyginus, it is the king who is restrained. As in Euripides, Hypsipyles&#x27; sons Thoas and Euneus, who are searching for their mother, arrive at the palace. In Statius&#x27; poem, Hypsipyle is able to identify her sons by means of the swords they carry, which belonged to Jason, and bear the mark of Jason&#x27;s ship the Argo on them, and a joyous reunion ensues.

===Apollodorus===
Apollodorus, generally follows Euripides&#x27; account of the story, but differs at two points. According to Apollodorus, it was the Lemnian women themselves who, having discovered that Thoas had been spared, sold Hypsipyle into slavery. Also according to Apollodorus, as in Statius&#x27; account, Hypsipyle left Opheltes behind when she led the Seven to the spring.

==In literature==
*In his work, &quot;Inferno&quot;, the 14th-century Italian poet Dante Alighieri placed Jason in the eighth circle of Hell, along with seducers and panderers, for his deception and abandonment of Hypsipyle.
*In the &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, Dante&#x27;s guide Virgil notes that Hypsipyle is among the virtuous pagans in Limbo (Canto 22.112)

<text>The Pennsylvania Turnpike, sometimes shortened to Penna Turnpike or PA Turnpike, is a controlled-access toll road which is operated by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC) in Pennsylvania. It runs for across the southern part of the state, connecting Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, and passes through four tunnels as it crosses the Appalachian Mountains. A component of the Interstate Highway System, it is part of Interstate 76 (I-76) between the Ohio state line and Valley Forge. I-70 runs concurrently with I-76 between New Stanton and Breezewood, Interstate 276 (I-276) between Valley Forge and Bristol Township, and I-95 from Bristol Township to the New Jersey state line.

The turnpike&#x27;s western terminus is at the Ohio state line in Lawrence County, where it continues west as the Ohio Turnpike. The eastern terminus is the New Jersey state line at the Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge, which crosses the Delaware River in Bucks County. It continues east as the Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike. The turnpike has an all-electronic tolling system; tolls may be paid using E-ZPass or toll by plate, which uses automatic license plate recognition. Cash tolls were collected with a ticket and barrier toll system before they were phased out between 2016 and 2020. The turnpike currently has 15 service plazas, providing food and fuel to travelers.

The road was designed during the 1930s to improve automobile transportation across the Pennsylvania mountains, using seven tunnels built for the South Pennsylvania Railroad in the 1880s. It opened in 1940 between Irwin and Carlisle. The turnpike, an early long-distance limited-access U.S. highway, was a model for future limited-access toll roads and the Interstate Highway System. It was extended east to Valley Forge in 1950 and west to the Ohio state line in 1951. The road was extended east to the Delaware River in 1954, and construction began on its Northeast Extension. The mainline turnpike was finished in 1956 with the completion of the Delaware River Bridge.

From 1962 to 1971, an additional tube was built at four of the two-lane tunnels, with two cuts built to replace the three others; this made the entirety of the road four lanes wide. Improvements continue to be made: rebuilding to meet modern standards, widening portions to six lanes, and construction or reconstruction of interchanges.

==Route description==
The turnpike runs east to west across Pennsylvania, from the Ohio state line in Lawrence County east to the New Jersey state line in Bucks County. It passes through the Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, and Philadelphia areas, farmland and woodland. The highway crosses the Appalachian Mountains in central Pennsylvania, passing through four tunnels. The PTC, created in 1937 to construct, finance, operate, and maintain the road, controls the highway. The turnpike had 2015 annual average daily traffic ranging from a high of 120,000 vehicles (between the Norristown interchange and I-476) to a low of 12,000, between the Ohio state line and the interchange with I-79 and U.S. Route 19.

It is part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the U.S. economy, defense, and mobility. The turnpike is a Blue Star Memorial Highway, honoring those who have served in the United States Armed Forces, and the Garden Club Federation of Pennsylvania has placed Blue Star Memorial Highway markers at its service plazas. In addition to the east–west mainline, the PTC also operates the Northeast Extension (I-476), the Beaver Valley Expressway (I-376), the Mon–Fayette Expressway (PA 43), the Amos K. Hutchinson Bypass (PA 66), and the Southern Beltway (PA 576).

===Western Extension===
The turnpike begins at the Ohio state line in Lawrence County, where it continues west as the Ohio Turnpike. From the state line, the highway heads southeast as a four-lane freeway (I-76) through rural areas south of New Castle. A short distance from the Ohio line, the eastbound lanes pass the electronic Gateway toll gantry. The highway then reaches Beaver County and the first interchange with I-376 (the Beaver Valley Expressway) in Big Beaver.

It then passes under Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Koppel Secondary rail line before the exit for PA 18 near Homewood, crossing CSX&#x27;s Pittsburgh Subdivision rail line, the Beaver River, and Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Youngstown Line on the Beaver River Bridge. The road enters Butler County and Cranberry Township, where an interchange accesses I-79 and US 19. It continues through rural land and suburban development north of Pittsburgh into Allegheny County.

The turnpike approaches the Warrendale toll gantry (where the closed toll system begins) and continues southeast, passing over the CSX P&amp;W Subdivision rail line operated by the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad to an interchange with PA 8 in Hampton Township. The Allegheny Valley exit in Harmar Township accesses PA 28 via Freeport Road. The road then heads south, with Canadian National&#x27;s Bessemer Subdivision rail line parallel on the east, before crossing Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Conemaugh Line, the Allegheny River, and the Allegheny Valley Railroad&#x27;s Allegheny Subdivision line on the six-lane Allegheny River Turnpike Bridge.

It returns to four lanes after the river crossing, passing through the Oakmont Country Club before a bridge over Canadian National&#x27;s Bessemer Subdivision; rail tracks parallel the west side of the road before splitting further west. The highway heads southeast to Monroeville, an eastern suburb of Pittsburgh; an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-376 and US 22 (the Penn–Lincoln Parkway) accesses Pittsburgh. It traverses eastern Allegheny County before entering Westmoreland County. The turnpike then heads south and passes over Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Pittsburgh Line before the exit for US 30 near Irwin.

===Original mainline===
After the Irwin interchange, the turnpike widens to six lanes and heads into rural areas west of Greensburg. Curving southeast, it reaches New Stanton and an interchange for I-70, US 119, and the southern terminus of PA 66 (Amos K. Hutchinson Bypass). The road returns to four lanes there, and I-70 is concurrent with I-76. After New Stanton it passes over the Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Radebaugh Subdivision line and winds southeast to the exit for PA 31 in Donegal, which accesses PA 711. East of Donegal, the turnpike crosses the Laurel Hill cut, and soon after enters Somerset County.

It continues southeast to Somerset and an interchange with PA 601 accessing US 219 and Johnstown before crossing CSX&#x27;s S&amp;C Subdivision rail line. East of Somerset, the highway passes north of the Somerset Wind Farm before reaching Allegheny Mountain and its tunnel. The turnpike then winds down the mountain at a three-percent grade (its steepest) into Bedford County through a valley. In Bedford, an exit for US 220 Business (US 220 Bus.) accesses US 220, the southern terminus of I-99, and Altoona.

It passes through the Narrows, a gap in Evitts Mountain east of Bedford, with US 30 and the Raystown Branch Juniata River. The turnpike winds through a valley south of the river before traversing Clear Ridge Cut near Everett. In Breezewood, I-70 leaves the turnpike at an interchange with US 30 with some of the only traffic lights on an interstate highway.

The turnpike then heads northeast across Rays Hill into Fulton County, continuing east across Sideling Hill to an interchange with US 522 in Fort Littleton and paralleling US 522 before curving east into Huntingdon County. It goes under Tuscarora Mountain through a tunnel into Franklin County, curving northeast into a valley to the PA 75 exit in Willow Hill.

The road then passes under Kittatinny Mountain through the Kittatinny Mountain Tunnel before entering the tunnel under Blue Mountain. The turnpike heads northeast along the base of Blue Mountain to an exit for PA 997 and enters Cumberland County, heading east through the Cumberland Valley on a stretch known as &quot;the straightaway&quot;. It then reaches Carlisle and an interchange with US 11, accessing I-81.

===Philadelphia Extension===
The turnpike heads east through a mixture of rural land and suburban development approaching Harrisburg, passing over Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Shippensburg Secondary rail line. In Upper Allen Township, the US 15 interchange accesses Gettysburg on the south and Harrisburg on the north. The road passes over Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Lurgan Branch rail line before entering York County and the interchange with I-83 serving Harrisburg, its western suburbs, and York on the south.

East of I-83, the turnpike widens to six lanes and crosses over Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Port Road Branch rail line, the Susquehanna River, Amtrak&#x27;s Keystone Corridor rail line, and Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Royalton Branch rail line on the Susquehanna River Bridge. In Dauphin County, the road is a bypass south of Harrisburg.

An interchange with the southern end of I-283 and the western end of PA 283 serves Harrisburg&#x27;s eastern suburbs in Lower Swatara Township and Harrisburg International Airport; PTC headquarters are adjacent to the interchange. The road returns to four lanes through suburban development north of Middletown, passing over the Middletown and Hummelstown Railroad and Swatara Creek into rural areas. and crossing a corner of Lebanon County before entering Lancaster County.

The highway passes through Pennsylvania Dutch Country to an interchange with PA 72, accessing Lebanon on the north and Lancaster on the south. It passes over an East Penn Railroad line in Denver before an indirect interchange with US 222, which serves Reading and Lancaster. The route continues into Berks County to an interchange with the southern terminus of I-176 (a freeway to Reading) and PA 10 in Morgantown which accesses PA 23.

The turnpike enters Chester County, running southeast to an exit for PA 100 north of Downingtown and the western suburbs of Philadelphia; an interchange with PA 29 is near Malvern. In Montgomery County is the Valley Forge interchange in King of Prussia, where I-76 splits from the turnpike and heads southeast as the Schuylkill Expressway toward Philadelphia; this interchange accesses US 202 and US 422.

===Delaware River Extension===

At the Valley Forge interchange, the turnpike is designated I-276 and becomes a six-lane suburban commuter highway. It crosses a bridge over SEPTA&#x27;s Norristown High Speed Line and runs parallel to Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Dale Secondary rail line, south of the road. The turnpike crosses Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Harrisburg Line, the Schuylkill River, and SEPTA&#x27;s Manayunk/Norristown Line on the Schuylkill River Bridge near Norristown. The road crosses the Schuylkill River Trail and Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Morrisville Connecting Track on the Schuylkill River Bridge before the parallel Dale Secondary rail line runs south.

In Plymouth Meeting, an interchange with Germantown Pike accesses Norristown before the Mid-County Interchange. This interchange connects to I-476, which runs south as the Mid-County Expressway (locally known as the Blue Route) and north as the Northeast Extension connecting the mainline to the Lehigh Valley and the Pocono Mountains.

After the Mid-County Interchange, the mainline runs east through Philadelphia&#x27;s northern suburbs. In Fort Washington, it passes over SEPTA&#x27;s Lansdale/Doylestown Line before an interchange with PA 309. The road then parallels Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Morrisville Line, a short distance south. later is a westbound exit and entrance for Virginia Drive. In Willow Grove, it reaches the PA 611 exit before crossing SEPTA&#x27;s Warminster Line. The turnpike continues through suburban areas, entering Bucks County and a bridge over Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Morrisville Line before crossing SEPTA&#x27;s West Trenton Line. In Bensalem Township is a bridge over CSX&#x27;s Trenton Subdivision rail line before an interchange with US 1, which accesses Philadelphia.

The highway returns to four lanes before an eastbound exit and entrance for PA 132. It then reaches the east end of the closed toll system at the Neshaminy Falls toll gantry. The road reaches a partial interchange with I-95, where it crosses under I-295; I-295 access is from the westbound turnpike to southbound I-95 and from northbound I-95 to the eastbound turnpike. At this point, I-276 ends and the turnpike becomes part of I-95; signage indicates the westbound turnpike as a left exit from southbound I-95, using I-95 milepost exit number 40.

After joining I-95, the remaining of road uses I-95&#x27;s mileposts and exit numbers and is not signed as the Pennsylvania Turnpike (although it is still considered part of the mainline). The turnpike reaches its final interchange, accessing US 13 near Bristol. The road crosses an East Penn Railroad line before the westbound all-electronic Delaware River Bridge toll gantry. It crosses the Delaware Canal and Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor rail line before crossing the Delaware River into New Jersey on the Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge. The Pennsylvania Turnpike ends and I-95 continues east (north) as the Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike, which connects to the mainline New Jersey Turnpike.

The turnpike has several major bridges and tunnels. Four tunnels cross central Pennsylvania&#x27;s Appalachian Mountains. The Allegheny Mountain Tunnel passes under Allegheny Mountain in Somerset County. The Tuscarora Mountain Tunnel runs beneath Tuscarora Mountain at the border of Huntingdon and Franklin counties, and is long. The Kittatinny Mountain and Blue Mountain tunnels are adjacent to each other in Franklin County and are and long, respectively. The turnpike had also traveled through the Laurel Hill Tunnel, Sideling Hill Tunnel, and Rays Hill Tunnel; they were replaced during the 1960s as they were obsolete.

Five bridges carry the turnpike over major rivers. The Beaver River Bridge crosses the Beaver River in Beaver County, which is being replaced. The highway crosses the Allegheny River in Allegheny County on the Allegheny River Turnpike Bridge, which replaced a 1951 deck truss bridge with the same name. It crosses the Susquehanna River between York and Dauphin Counties on the Susquehanna River Bridge, which also replaced an early-1950s deck truss bridge. The turnpike crosses the Schuylkill River on the Schuylkill River Bridge in Montgomery County, which was twinned in the 2000s. At the New Jersey state line in Bucks County, the highway is connected to the Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike by the Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge over the Delaware River.

==Tolls==
The turnpike uses all-electronic tolling, with toll by plate (which uses automatic license-plate recognition and mails a bill to the vehicle owner) or E-ZPass. Between the mainline Warrendale and Neshaminy Falls toll plazas, tolls are based on distance traveled. An eastbound mainline toll gantry is at Gateway (near the Ohio state line), and a westbound mainline toll gantry is at the Delaware River Bridge near the New Jersey state line; both charging a flat toll. There is no toll between Gateway and Warrendale, and between Neshaminy Falls and the Delaware River Bridge.

, it costs $95.50 for a passenger vehicle to travel the length of the mainline turnpike between Warrendale and Neshaminy Falls using toll by plate and $47.30 using E-ZPass; the eastbound Gateway toll gantry charges $15.20 with toll by plate and $7.50 with E-ZPass for passenger vehicles, and the westbound Delaware River Bridge toll gantry charges $9.70 for toll by plate and $7.30 for E-ZPass. The turnpike has raised tolls each January 1 since 2009 to fund mandated Act 44 annual payments to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT).

The turnpike commission paid PennDOT $450 million annually, of which $200 million went to non-turnpike highway projects and $250 million funded mass transit. As part of Act 89 (signed in 2013), annual payments to PennDOT would end after 202235 years earlier than the original Act 44 proposal. It was not known if the annual toll increases would continue after 2022. Act 89 redirected the $450 million annual payments to PennDOT to fund mass transit. With the annual rise in tolls, traffic has been shifting from the turnpike to local roads.

Until March 2020, the turnpike used a ticket system between the Warrendale and Neshaminy Falls toll plazas. Motorists received a ticket listing the toll for each exit; the ticket was surrendered when exiting, and the applicable toll was paid. If the ticket was lost, motorists were charged the maximum toll for that exit. Cash, credit cards, and E-ZPass were accepted at toll plazas.

In 2010, McCormick Taylor and Wilbur Smith Associates were hired to conduct a feasibility study on converting the road to electronic tolls. On March 6, 2012, the turnpike commission announced that it was implementing the plan. The turnpike commission projected that it would save $65 million annually in labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. On January 3, 2016, electronic tolling was introduced at the westbound Delaware River Bridge mainline toll plaza, and the eastern terminus of the ticket system was moved from the Delaware River Bridge to Neshaminy Falls. On October 27, 2019, electronic tolling was implemented at the eastbound Gateway mainline toll plaza. Electronic tolling was originally scheduled to be implemented on the entire length of the turnpike in late 2021.

By 2020, about 86 percent of turnpike vehicles already used E-ZPass for payment of tolls. In March 2020, the switch to electronic tolling was made early as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The electronic tolling system used toll booths at exits until toll gantries between interchanges were built. The first toll gantries located east of the Reading interchange began operation in 2025, and the remainder of the toll gantries along the western portion of the turnpike are expected to begin operation by late 2026. After all toll gantries are fully operating, the PTC plans to demolish all toll plazas.

===Act 44 increases===
The turnpike commission raised tolls by 25 percent on January 4, 2009, to fund road and mass-transit projects as mandated by Act 44. The increase brought the rate to (equivalent to in ). An annual toll increase was planned.

A three-percent toll increase went into effect on January 3, 2010, bringing the rate to (equivalent to in ). The cash toll increased 10 percent on January 2, 2011, and E-ZPass tolls increased three percent. The new toll rate was (equivalent to in ) with cash and (equivalent to in ) with E-ZPass.

The turnpike commission initially planned to omit the toll amount from new tickets, and state auditor Jack Wagner wondered if the commission was trying to hide the increase. The commission later decided to include the tolls on new tickets.

Cash tolls increased 10 percent on January 1, 2012, and E-ZPass tolls were unchanged from the previous year. The cash toll rate increased to (equivalent to in ). Tolls for cash and E-ZPass customers increased each January for the next eight years. Tolls will increase five percent in 2025, based on distance traveled as opposed to a flat rate; some drivers will see toll decreases. They are expected to increase annually until at least 2050.

An analysis by Australian insurance company Budget Direct found the Pennsylvania Turnpike the world&#x27;s most expensive toll road. Turnpike spokesperson Carl DeFebo disputed Budget Direct&#x27;s claim, saying that the analysis looked at all of the turnpike&#x27;s toll roads together; &quot;Nobody would ever go south towards Pittsburgh, east towards Philadelphia, then north towards Scranton. That&#x27;s a 400-plus mile trip&quot;, and turnpike tolls are comparable to other toll roads on a per-mile basis.

==Services==
===Emergency assistance and information===
Motorists needing assistance can dial *11 on mobile phones. First-responder service is available to all turnpike users via the GEICO Safety Patrol program. The free program checks for disabled motorists, debris and accidents along the road, and provides assistance 24 hours daily year-round. Each patrol vehicle covers a stretch of the turnpike. Towing service is available from authorized service stations near the highway, and Pennsylvania State Police Troop T patrols the turnpike. The troop&#x27;s headquarters is in Highspire, and its turnpike substations are grouped into two sections. The western section has substations in Gibsonia, New Stanton, Somerset and Everett; the eastern section has mainline substations in Newville, Bowmansville and King of Prussia. The PTC broadcasts AM road, traffic, and weather conditions from highway advisory radio transmitters at each exit on 1640 kHz, with a range of approximately . The 511PA travel-information service provides alerts, an interactive map, weather information and traffic cameras to motorists, and variable-message signs located along the roadway provide information such as accidents, construction, weather, and traffic congestion.

===Service plazas===
The turnpike currently has 15 high capacity service plazas, though at one point had over 20 lower capacity plazas. Each plaza has several fast-food restaurants, a Sunoco gas station, and a 7-Eleven convenience store. Other amenities include ATMs, E-ZPass sales, free cellphone charging, Pennsylvania Lottery sales, picnic areas, restrooms, tourist information, Travel Board information centers, and Wi-Fi. The King of Prussia plaza has a welcome center, and the New Stanton and Sideling Hill plazas have seasonal farmers&#x27; markets. Several plazas offer E85 fuel, and New Stanton offers compressed natural gas; all have conventional gasoline and diesel fuel. Some plazas have electric vehicle charging stations. The Sunoco and 7-Eleven locations and the Subway at North Midway are operated by 7-Eleven, and the remaining restaurants and general upkeep are operated by Applegreen.

By 1946, a number of service plazas were expanded in order to accommodate booming popularity.

With the opening of the extensions between 1950 and 1954, new service plazas came as well. On them, the service plazas were less frequent, larger, and further from the road. Gulf Oil operated service stations on the extensions, and Howard Johnson&#x27;s provided food service in sit-down restaurants. 

In 1955, the South Somerset Service Plaza and North Somerset Service Plaza were both opened, replacing the eastbound only New Baltimore Plaza.

In 1957, the westbound New Stanton service plaza was built, and the Laurel Hill Plaza, located to the west of the western end of the Laurel Hill Tunnel, was closed.
With the opening of the Sideling Hill/Rays Hill Bypass November 26, 1968, the Sideling Hill Plaza, serving both westbound and eastbound traffic with a single facility, replacing the Cove Valley Travel plaza, which served only westbound traffic and needed to be demolished due to being located on the section of road being closed.

In preparation of the United States Bicentennial, construction was completed in 1976 of a 320 space parking lot at the eastbound only Valley Forge plaza.

The Denver plaza, Pleasant Valley plaza, and Mechanicsburg plaza were all closed in 1980, having been experiencing diminishing profits. This left only the Okmount Plum plaza, Butler plaza, and Zenophole plaza in western Pennsylvania. 

In 1978, as Howard Johnson&#x27;s exclusive contract to provide food service was ending, the turnpike commission entertained bids; Aramark was awarded a food-service contract at two plazas. The turnpike was the first toll road in the U.S. to have more than one fast-food chain at its service plazas. Gas stations were operated by Gulf Oil, Exxon, and ARCO. In 1980, Hardee&#x27;s opened restaurants at the service plazas to compete with Howard Johnson&#x27;s. The turnpike was the world&#x27;s first road to offer fast food at its service plazas. Burger King and McDonald&#x27;s restaurants opened on the turnpike in June 1983, this was part of a deal that saw the eastbound Path Valley plaza closed, it had seen a gradual loss of revenue since the Sideling Hill plazas opening in 1968. With this, fast food was implemented at the Hempfield Plaza. This reflected increased demands for fast food. Marriott Corporation purchased the remaining Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants in 1987, and restaurants such as Roy Rogers and Bob&#x27;s Big Boy opened.

In April 1990, Gulf Oil LP replaced the turnpike&#x27;s Exxon stations.

The Brandywine (later Peter J. Camiel) plaza was systematically demolished and rebuilt from September 1990 to May 1991. This was necessary as it was the busiest service plaza on the entire mainline, and as such, increased use of it over time had rendered it obsolete.

Sunoco took over gas-station operations in 1993, outbidding Shell US; credit card-activated pumps, fax machines, ATMs, and informational lodging boards were added. Two years later, a farmers market began at the Sideling Hill plaza. 

In March 2002, the Butler plaza was closed so it could be replaced by the Warrendale Toll Plaza. Two years later, the Somerset Service Plaza was expanded.

The eastbound-only Hempfield and South Neshaminy plazas were closed in 2007 for a six-lane widening and new slip ramp, respectively.

The eastbound Zelienople plaza closed in 2008 due to being a money loser since the portion between the Gateway Toll Plaza and Warrendale became free in 2003. Some criticized this as a potential tourism reducer. 

The North Neshaminy plaza closed in 2010 so its parking lot could be used for construction equipment needed for a planned total reconstruction in the area. Free Wi-Fi was introduced at all service plazas in 2013.

By the mid 2000s, the service plazas, most having been built in the 1950s and some in the 1940s, were functionally obsolete. Because of this, 2006, the PTC and HMSHost began a system-wide project to reconstruct or renovate all service plazas. The Oakmont Plum plaza was first (closing in 2006 and reopening the following year), and was followed by the reconstruction of the North Somerset and Sideling Hill plazas (2007–2008); New Stanton (2008–2009); King of Prussia (2009–2010); Lawn and Bowmansville (2010–2011); South Somerset, Blue Mountain, and Cumberland Valley (2011–2012); South Midway and Highspire (2012–2013); Peter J. Camiel (2013–2014); and Valley Forge and North Midway (2014–2015).

The Art Sparks program began in 2017 as a partnership between the turnpike commission and the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts to install public art created by local students in the Arts in Education residency program in service plazas along the turnpike over the next five years. The art consists of a mural reflecting a plaza&#x27;s location. The first Art Sparks mural was unveiled at the Lawn service plaza in May of that year. 

Beginning in April 2019, Sunoco/A-Plus locations began conversion to 7-Elevens as part of an agreement for 7-Eleven to take over Sunoco&#x27;s company-owned convenience stores on the East Coast and in Texas; Sunoco continues to supply fuel.

==History==
===Before the turnpike===
Native Americans traveled across the mountains on wilderness trails, and European settlers followed wagon roads to cross the state. The Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike opened between Lancaster and Philadelphia in 1794, the first successful turnpike in the United States. The road was paved with logs, an improvement on dirt trails. In 1834, the Main Line of Public Works opened as a system of canals, railroads, and cable railways across Pennsylvania to compete with the Erie Canal in New York.

The Pennsylvania Railroad was completed between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia in 1854. During the 1880s, the South Pennsylvania Railroad was proposed to compete with the Pennsylvania. It was backed by William Henry Vanderbilt, head of the New York Central Railroad (the Pennsylvania&#x27;s chief rival). Andrew Carnegie also provided financial support, since he was unhappy with the Pennsylvania Railroad rates. Construction began on the rival line in 1883, but stopped when the railroads reached an agreement two years later. After construction halted, the only vestiges of the South Pennsylvania were nine tunnels, some roadbed, and piers for a bridge over the Susquehanna River in Harrisburg.

To cross the Pennsylvania mountains by automobile, William Sutherland of the Pennsylvania Motor Truck Association and Victor Lecoq of the Pennsylvania State Planning Commission proposed a toll highway in 1934. The highway would be a four-lane, limited-access road modeled on the German Autobahn and Connecticut&#x27;s Merritt Parkway. The turnpike could also be a defense road, and construction costs could be reduced by using the abandoned South Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels.

Sutherland and Lecoq introduced their turnpike idea to state legislator Cliff Patterson, who proposed a feasibility study on April 23, 1935. The proposal passed, and the Works Progress Administration (WPA) explored the possibility of building the road. Its study estimated a construction cost of $60 to $70 million (equivalent to between $ and $ in ). Patterson introduced Bill 211 to the legislature, calling for the establishment of the PTC. The bill was signed into law by Governor George Howard Earle III on May 21, 1937, and the first commissioners were appointed on June 4. The highway was planned to run from US 30 in Irwin (east of Pittsburgh) east to US 11 in Middlesex (west of Harrisburg), a length of about . It would pass through nine tunnels along the way.

The road was planned to have four lanes and a median, with no grade steeper than three percent. Access to the highway would be controlled by entrance and exit ramps. There would be no at-grade intersections, driveways, traffic lights, crosswalks, or at-grade railroad crossings. Curves would be wide, and road signage large. The turnpike&#x27;s right of way would be ; the road would be wide, with shoulders and a median. It would have two lanes through the tunnels, a clearance, and a roadway. The turnpike&#x27;s design would be uniform.

In February 1938, the commission began investigating proposals for $55 million in bonds to be issued for construction of the turnpike. A month later, Van Ingen and Company purchased $60 million (equivalent to $ in ) in bonds which they offered to the public. President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved a $24-million (equivalent to $ in ) grant from the WPA in April 1938 for construction of the road, and the commonwealth contributed $29 million (equivalent to $ in ) toward the project.

The WPA grant received final approval, but plans were still made to sell bonds; the first issue was planned for about $20 million (equivalent to $ in ). The reduced bond issue was due to the WPA grant.

In June, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) announced that it would lend the commission sufficient funds to build the road. The RFC loan totaled $32 million (equivalent to $ in ), with a $26 million (equivalent to $ in ) grant from the Public Works Administration (PWA); this provided $58 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the turnpike&#x27;s construction, and highway tolls would repay the RFC.

In October 1938, the turnpike commission agreed with the RFC and PWA that the RFC would purchase $35 million (equivalent to $ in ) in bonds in addition to the PWA grant. That month, a banking syndicate purchased the bond amount from the RFC. The previous month, a proposal was rejected that would have built a railroad from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg along the former South Pennsylvania Railroad right of way which had been designated for the turnpike.

The highway opened in 1940 between Irwin and Carlisle as the first long-distance controlled-access highway in the United States. Other toll roads and the Interstate Highway System were then built. The highway was extended east to Valley Forge in 1950, and west to the Ohio state line the following year. It was routed east to the New Jersey state line (the Delaware River) in 1954; the Delaware River Bridge opened two years later, completing the turnpike.

===Design===
To build the turnpike, boring of the former railroad tunnels had to be completed. Since the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel bore was in poor condition, a new bore was drilled south of it. The commission considered bypassing the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill tunnels, but the cost of a bypass was considered too high. Crews used steam shovels to widen the tunnel portals, and temporary railroad tracks transported construction equipment. Concrete was used to line the tunnel portals. The tunnels included ventilation ducts, drainage structures, sidewalks, lighting, and telephone and signal systems. Lighting was installed on the roadway approaching the tunnel portals.

The tunnels bored through the seven mountains, a total of in length, were Laurel Hill Tunnel, Allegheny Mountain Tunnel, Rays Hill Tunnel, Sideling Hill Tunnel, Tuscarora Mountain Tunnel, Kittatinny Mountain Tunnel, and Blue Mountain Tunnel; the turnpike became known as the &quot;tunnel highway&quot;.

A number of bridge designs were used to cross the highway, including the concrete arch bridge, the through plate girder bridge, and the concrete T-beam bridge. Bridges used to carry the turnpike over other roads and streams included a concrete arch viaduct in New Stanton; at , it was the longest bridge on the original section of the turnpike. Other turnpike bridges included plate girder bridges, such as the bridge over Dunnings Creek in the Bedford Narrows. Smaller concrete T-beam bridges were also built. A total of 307 bridges were built along the original section of the turnpike.

Eleven interchanges were built, most of which were trumpet interchanges where all ramps merge at the toll booths. The New Stanton, Carlisle, and Middlesex interchanges did not follow this design, but only the New Stanton interchange was intended to be permanent. Lighting was installed approaching interchanges, along with acceleration and deceleration lanes. The road had guardrails consisting of steel panels attached to I-beams. Large exit signs were used, and road signs had cat&#x27;s-eye reflectors to increase visibility at night. Billboards were prohibited. In September 1940, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission ruled that trucks and buses could use the highway.

Since the turnpike&#x27;s first section was built through a rural part of the state, food and gasoline were not readily available to motorists. Because of this, the commission decided to provide service plazas at intervals. The plazas would be made of native fieldstone, resembling Colonial-era architecture. In 1940, Standard Oil of Pennsylvania received a contract for 10 Esso service stations along the turnpike. Eight of the service plazas would consist of service stations and a restaurant, and the plazas at the halfway point (in Bedford) would be larger. The South Midway service plaza (the largest) contained a dining room, lunch counter, lounge, and lodging for truckers; a tunnel connected it to the smaller North Midway plaza. The remaining service plazas were smaller, with a lunch counter. Food service at the plazas was provided by Howard Johnson&#x27;s. After World War II, the food facilities were enlarged; service stations sold gasoline, repaired cars, and provided towing.

===Construction and opening===

Before the first-section groundbreaking, in 1937, the turnpike commission sent workers to assess the former railroad tunnels; in September of that year, a contract was awarded to drain water from them. After this, workers cleared rock slides and vegetation from the tunnel portals before evaluating the nine tunnels&#x27; condition. It was decided that six of the nine former South Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels could be used for the roadway. The Allegheny Mountain Tunnel was in too-poor condition for use. Because of this, an entirely new tunnel was bored nearby. However of these nine, it would be more expansive to complete the Quemahoning and Negro Mountain tunnels in comparison to simply building rock cuts to bypass them. As such, they were bypassed in original construction. The Quemahoning Tunnel had been completed and used by the Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Somerset Railroad.

The turnpike&#x27;s groundbreaking ceremony was on October 27, 1938, near Carlisle, with commission chair Walter A. Jones thrusting the first shovel into the earth. Construction was on a tight schedule because completion of the road was originally planned by May 1, 1940. After the groundbreaking, contracts for finishing the former South Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels, grading the turnpike&#x27;s right of way, constructing bridges, and paving were issued. By July 1939, the entire length of the turnpike was under contract.

The first work to begin on the road was grading its right of way, which involved a great deal of earthwork due to the mountainous terrain. The turnpike required the acquisition of homes, farms, and a coal mine by eminent domain. A tunnel was originally planned across Clear Ridge near Everett, but the turnpike commission decided to build a cut into the ridge. Building the cut involved bulldozers excavating the mountain and explosives blasting the rock. Concrete culverts were built to carry streams and roads under the highway in the valley floor. The Clear Ridge cut was deep (the deepest highway cut at the time), and was known as &quot;Little Panama&quot; after the Panama Canal. West of Clear Ridge, cuts and fills were built for the turnpike to pass along the southern edge of Earlston.

Considerable work was also involved in building the road up the three-percent grade at the east end of Allegheny Mountain, the turnpike&#x27;s steepest grade. The base of Evitts Mountain was blasted to carry the turnpike across Bedford Narrows with US 30, the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River, and a Pennsylvania Railroad branch line. In New Baltimore, the turnpike commission had to purchase land from St. John&#x27;s Church (which contained a cemetery); as part of the agreement, stairs were built on either side of the turnpike for access to the church.
Paving began on August 31, 1939. The road would have a concrete surface, poured directly onto the earth with no gravel roadbed. Concrete batch plants were set up along the road to aid paving. Interchange ramps were paved with asphalt. The paving led to a delay in the projected opening of the highway; by October 1939, the completion date was postponed from May 1 to June 29, 1940 because paving could not be done in winter. The commission rushed the paving, attempting to increase the distance paved from a day.

Completion was postponed until July 4, and again until late summer when rain delayed paving operations. Paving concluded by the end of the summer, and on September 30 the turnpike commission announced that the road would open the following day. Because of the short notice, no ribbon-cutting ceremony was held.

On August 26, 1940, a preview of the highway was organized by commission chair Jones. It began the previous night with a banquet at the Hotel Hershey and proceeded west along the turnpike, stopping at the Clear Ridge cut before lunch at the Midway service plaza. The preview ended with dinner and entertainment at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Duquesne Club. That month, a military motorcade traveled portions of the turnpike.

The roadway took of sand, of stone, of steel, and more than of cement to complete. It was built at a cost of (equivalent to $ per mile (/km) in ). Eighteen thousand people worked on the turnpike, and 19 died during construction.

When the highway was under construction, its proposed toll was $1.50 (equivalent to $ in ) for a one-way car trip; a round trip would cost $2.00 (equivalent to $ in ). Trucks would pay $10.00 (equivalent to $ in ) one way. Tolls would vary for motorists who did not travel the length of the turnpike. When it opened in 1940, automobile tolls were set at $1.50 (equivalent to $ in ) one way and $2.25 (equivalent to $ in ) round trip. The tolls were to be used to pay off bonds to build the road and were to be removed when the bonds were paid. However, tolls continue to be charged to finance improvements to the turnpike system. The toll rate was about (equivalent to in ) when the turnpike opened. The ticket system was used to pay for tolls. This toll rate remained the same for the turnpike&#x27;s first 25 years; other toll roads (such as the New York State Thruway and the Ohio, Connecticut, and Massachusetts turnpikes) had a higher rate.

The turnpike opened at midnight on October 1, 1940, between Irwin and Carlisle; the day before the opening, motorists lined up at the Irwin and Carlisle interchanges. Homer D. Romberger, a feed and tallow driver from Carlisle, was the first motorist to enter the turnpike at Carlisle; Carl A. Boe of McKeesport was the first motorist to enter at Irwin. Boe was flagged down by Frank Lorey and Dick Gangle, the turnpike&#x27;s first hitchhikers. On October 6 (the first Sunday after the turnpike&#x27;s opening), traffic was congested at toll plazas, tunnels, and service plazas.

During its first 15 days of operation, the road had over 150,000 vehicles. By the end of its first year it earned $3 million (equivalent to $ in ) in revenue from five million motorists, exceeding the $2.67 million (equivalent to $ in ) needed for operation and bond payments. With the onset of World War II, revenue declined due to tire and gas rationing; after the war, traffic increased.

The turnpike was the first long-distance, limited-access road in the United States. A direct link between the mid-Atlantic and midwestern states, it reduced travel time between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg from nearly six hours to about . Nicknamed &quot;dream highway&quot; and &quot;the World&#x27;s Greatest Highway&quot; by the turnpike commission, it was also known as &quot;the Granddaddy of the Pikes&quot;. Postcards and other souvenirs promoted the original stretch&#x27;s seven tunnels through the Appalachians.

The highway was considered a yardstick against which limited-access highway construction would be measured. Commission chair Jones called for more limited-access roads to be built across the country for defense purposes, and the turnpike was a model for a proposed national network of highways planned during World War II. The turnpike led to the construction of other toll roads, such as the New Jersey Turnpike and (eventually) the Interstate Highway System, and has been designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

===1940s–1990s===

The turnpike had a speed limit when it opened. The only exception was at the tunnels, where it reduced to . However, these were poorly enforced, some cars traveled as fast as . In April 1941, speed limit was raised from for cars and for trucks. 

Beginning in December 1941, the turnpike adopted the national speed limit of for all vehicles; in 1945, the limit returned to .

Before the first section opened, the commission considered extending east to Philadelphia for defense purposes. The state legislature passed a 1939 bill allowing for an extension to Philadelphia, which was signed into law by Governor Arthur James as Act 11 in 1940. The extension was estimated to cost between $50 and $60 million in 1941 (equivalent to between $ and $ in ). In June 1948, funding for the extension was put in place. The turnpike commission offered $134 million (equivalent to $ in ) in bonds to pay for the extension that July, which had its estimations revised to $87 million. The Philadelphia extension would run from Carlisle east to US 202 in King of Prussia, connecting to the Schuylkill Expressway, a state-maintained freeway which would continue to Center City Philadelphia. Groundbreaking for the Philadelphia extension took place on September 28, 1948, in York County. Governor James H. Duff and commission chair Thomas J. Evans attended the ceremony. In 1941, Governor James suggested building a extension to the Ohio border. That June, Act 54 was signed into law to build the extension. The turnpike commission began looking into funding for this road in 1949, which would run from the Irwin Interchange to the Ohio state line near Youngstown and bypass Pittsburgh. That September, $77 million (equivalent to $ in ) in bonds were sold to finance construction of the western extension. Groundbreaking for the Western extension took place on October 24, 1949 at the Brush Creek viaduct in Irwin, with Governor Duff in attendance. These extensions would use air-entrained concrete poured on stone, an improvement that motorists did not see. Transverse joints on the pavement were spaced at intervals, less than the intervals on the original portion. Because it crossed less-mountainous terrain, the extension required less earthwork. Large bridges were built, including those crossing the Susquehanna River and Swatara Creek. The Susquehanna River Bridge was built with a concrete median and no shoulders. This extension of the turnpike would use the same style of overpasses as the original section, excluding the steel deck bridge; an entirely new design. Like the Philadelphia extension, the western extension required the building of long bridges which included those crossing the Beaver and Allegheny Rivers. Overpasses were steel- and through-plate girder bridges. Concrete arch bridges were not used for overpasses, although they carried the turnpike over other roads. thirteen interchanges were built alongside the extensions, as well as the Gateway Toll Plaza and Valley Forge Toll Plaza, which served as the new eastern and western termini of the ticket system. The Carlisle interchange was also closed, and the Middlesex interchange with US 11 was realigned and renamed the Carlisle interchange, The Irwin Interchange was also converted into the Irwin Toll Plaza. On February 1, 1950, this, alongside the portion of road to the Gettysburg Pike Interchange, was opened. The extension&#x27;s completion was delayed by weather and a cement workers&#x27; strike; it was scheduled for October 1, 1950, the 10th anniversary of the opening of the first section. On October 23, the Philadelphia extension was previewed in a ceremony by Governor Duff. On November 13, the new Carlisle Interchange was opened as planned. However, drivers were barred from passing east of the new interchange. The rest of the Philadelphia extension opened to traffic on November 20; the governor and chair Evans cut the ribbon at the Valley Forge mainline toll plaza west of King of Prussia. Similarly to the Carlisle Interchange, the Irwin Toll Plaza was replaced by the Irwin Interchange, however, as the new alignment pasted to the east of the Irwin Toll Plaza, the original toll plaza was retained. On August 7, 1951, the section between the Irwin Interchange and Pittsburgh Interchange opened; Ohio Governor Frank Lausche led a dedication ceremony on November 26 of that year. The extension opened to the Gateway toll plaza, near the Ohio state line, on December 26, 1951. The highway ended in a cornfield, and traffic followed a temporary ramp onto rural local roads until the connecting Ohio Turnpike was built. The Beaver Valley Interchange opened on March 1, 1952. The speed limit between the Ohio state line and Breezewood was lowered to in September 1953 to reduce the number of accidents, but returned to when the measure was ineffective. On December 1, 1954, the Ohio Turnpike opened and the Pennsylvania Turnpike was extended to the Ohio state line. With the completion of this project, an extra were added to the system, leaving a total length of . Because of the new western terminus, mile markers and exit numbers on the original were updated to be accurate to the new western terminus.

On May 17, 1956, the speed limit was reduced from for cars, buses, and motorcycles; other vehicles were reduced to . 

In 1951, plans to extend the turnpike east to New Jersey border at the Delaware River were announced. Construction of the Delaware River extension was approved by Governor John S. Fine in May of that year. A route bypassing Philadelphia was announced in 1952, crossing the Delaware on a bridge near Edgely and connecting to a branch of the New Jersey Turnpike. That September, the turnpike commission announced that $65 million, equivalent to $ in , in bonds would be issued to finance the project. Work on the Delaware River extension began on November 20, 1952, and Governor Fine dug the first shovel into the earth at the groundbreaking ceremony. Five new interchanges, as well as the Delaware River Bridge Toll Plaza, were built, and the Valley Forge Toll Plaza was demolished and replaced by the Valley Forge Interchange. The Delaware River extension included a bridge over the Schuylkill River which was built to the same standards as the Susquehanna River Bridge. The construction of the Delaware River bridge required an amendment to the Pennsylvania Constitution, which barred the state from forming compacts with other states. In April 1954, $233 million (equivalent to $ in ) in bonds were issued to finance the building of the Delaware River Bridge and the Northeast Extension. Groundbreaking for the Delaware River Bridge, connecting the Pennsylvania and New Jersey Turnpikes, took place on June 26, 1954, in Florence, New Jersey. On August 23, 1954, the Delaware River Extension opened between King of Prussia and US 611 in Willow Grove. the segment to the Fort Washington Interchange opened on September 20, to the Philadelphia Interchange on October 27, and the remainder of the road to the Delaware Valley Interchange opened on November 17, 1954. The short section between that interchange and the Delaware River Bridge opened to traffic on May 23, 1956. This was a joint construction project with the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. Pennsylvania Governor George M. Leader and New Jersey Governor Robert B. Meyner were present at the opening ceremony. The Delaware River Bridge Toll Plaza was built west of the bridge, marking the eastern end of the ticket system. With the completion of the extension, a motorist could drive from New York City to Indiana on limited-access toll roads. This bridge was originally six lanes wide, and had no median, but one was later installed and the bridge constricted to four lanes. With the extensions and connecting turnpikes, the highway was envisioned as part of a system of toll roads stretching from Maine to Chicago. It was now possible to drive from New York City to Chicago without encountering a traffic signal. This brought the mainline to its current length of .

In late 1956, new machine-based toll equipment was activated for trucks, allowing for faster, more accurate tolls.

In 1953, an extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike from the mainline near Plymouth Meeting north through Northeastern Pennsylvania to the New York state line near Binghamton, New York, was proposed. Groundbreaking for the Northeastern Extension occurred on March 25, 1954, in White Haven, with Governor John S. Fine and commission chair Thomas J. Evans present. The Northeast Extension was planned to run from the mainline Pennsylvania Turnpike in Plymouth Meeting north to a temporary terminus at Scranton. In April 1954, $233 million (equivalent to $ in ) in bonds were issued to build the Northeastern Extension along with the Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge on the mainline Pennsylvania Turnpike. The Northeast Extension was built with a median in order to save money. Due to the mountainous terrain it passed through, a large amount of earthwork was necessary to build the road along with the construction of large bridges. Among the bridges built was the Clarks Summit Bridge (since renamed for John J. Fitzgerald, Turnpike engineer and superintendent) over US 6/US 11, which at the time was the tallest bridge on the Pennsylvania Turnpike system at . The Northeast Extension also included the two-lane Lehigh Tunnel under Blue Mountain. The tunnel was originally going to be named for commission chair Evans but was changed when he was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the commission of $19 million (equivalent to $ in ). The road was opened between the Plymouth Meeting Interchage and the Lehigh Valley Interchange on November 23, 1955. The highway was extended north to a temporary interchange at Emerald on December 28 of that year. The Northeast Extension was opened between Emerald and Wyoming Valley on April 1, 1957. The entire length of the Northeast Extension was finished on November 7, 1957, with the completion of the northernmost part between Wyoming Valley and Scranton. The part of the Northeast Extension between Scranton and the New York state line was not built as part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike system but rather the Interstate Highway System as I-81. At the northern terminus, the Northeast Extension narrowed to two lanes along the northbound offramp at Scranton to come to its northern terminus, with an abandoned short spur of the mainline heading north. A pair of trumpet interchanges were built to connect the Northeast Extension and I-81.

In August 1957, the Bureau of Public Roads added the mainline to the Interstate Highway System in accordance with recommendations by state highway departments to include toll roads in the system. I-80 was planned to run along the turnpike from the Ohio state line and Harrisburg West Interchange, where I-80S would continue east to the Valley Forge Interchange. I-70 was also planned to follow the turnpike between the Pittsburgh Interchange and Breezewood Interchange. At a June 26, 1958 meeting of the Route Numbering Subcommittee on the US Numbered System, it was decided to move the I-80 designation to an alignment further north; the highway from the Ohio state line to the Valley Forge Interchange would become I-80S. Between the Valley Forge Interchange and the New Jersey state line, the turnpike was designated I-280. With the creation of the Interstate Highway System, restaurants and gas stations were prohibited along interstate highways; the turnpike was grandfathered when it joined the system, allowing it to continue operating its service plazas. Signage was updated to be of a MUCD standard with this change.

In July 1959, a minimum speed of was established.

By the early 1950s, it was apparent that the original concrete driving surface between the Irwin Interchange and Carlisle Interchange was in poor shape. This was caused by excessive transverse-joint spacing and no gravel between earth and concrete. Because of this, a project began in 1954 to layer the original turnpike segment between Irwin and Carlisle with a layer of asphalt. Drainage was also implemented in order to prevent black ice from forming during cold weather, which was previously a common problem. During the work, traffic was restricted to two lanes on one roadway while the other was worked on. The first stretch to be rehabilitated was the stretch between the Irwin Interchange and Sideling Hill Tunnel. Repaving the rest of the roadway was completed by September 8, 1962.

In April 1963, the state of Pennsylvania proposed renumbering the interstates. As part of this, I-80S would be redesignated as I-76 between the Pittsburgh Interchange and Valley Forge Interchange, and I-280 would be redesignated as I-276 for its entire length, as neither connected to I-80 which violated interstate highway standards. The changes were approved by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on February 26, 1964. With this, the turnpike would carry I-76 from the Pittsburgh Interchange to Valley Forge Interchange and I-276 from the Valley Forge Interchange to the New Jersey state line. Signage was updated with this change.

The original New Stanton Interchange was the only non-trumpet interchange design remaining on the turnpike. It instead consisted of a pair of grade separated right-in/right-out ramps that merged into left hand, at-grade ramps into the two lane toll plaza, which then traveled to an intersection with left hand conflicting turns onto US 119. However, upon PennDOT completing the freeway realignment of Pennsylvania Route 71 (PA 71) in 1959, which brought traffic from Washington to New Stanton, use of the interchange increased significantly. Additionally, with I-70 planning to replace both PA 71 and US 119, the PTC became aware the interchange would need to be replaced. The interchange was initially left as is due to financial restraints, though when a man was killed in a car crash in 1963, funding was obtained, and work began that October to replace it. The new interchange was to be a safer double trumpet. The project, which had cost $1.6 million (equivalent to $ in ) was completed on November 12. The completion of this construction marked the first interchange to be replaced, as well as the first interchange that didn’t connect to an interstate highway or other expressway to be replaced in order to do so. The original eastbound exit and entrance were never demolished and still exist. 

On November 19, 1964, plans were proposed to the PTC that would have built an interchange with PA 501 near Myerstown. This never occurred. 

In September 1965, the minimum speed limit was reduced to .

The median, initially thought to be wide enough, was functionally obsolete by 1960. Because of this, nearly of median barrier began to be built across most of the road. Work was completed in December 1965 at a cost of $5 million (equivalent to $ in ).

As traffic levels increased at a rate almost ten times what PTC engineers originally anticipated, the two-lane tunnels became bottlenecks on the otherwise four lane road. As early as 1951, eastbound traffic had begun slowing down at the Laurel Hill Tunnel. In addition, with the New York State Thruway and Interstate 80 under construction, the turnpike faced its first serious competition. If nothing was done, traffic would migrate to those roads quickly. The PTC then began considering the potential widening of the tunnels as early as the mid 1950s. By 1958, traffic congestion at both the Laurel Hill Tunnel and Allegheny Mountain Tunnel was a regular occurrence, especially during the summer months. In late 1959, four senators urged state officials to work with the turnpike commission to study how to reduce the traffic jams, this was after the worst traffic back up in the history of the highway to date occurred at the Laurel Hill Tunnel. That year, the commission began studying ways to resolve the traffic jams at the two western most tunnels, the Laurel Hill Tunnel and Allegheny Mountain Tunnel. After study, the turnpike commission planned to eliminate the two bottlenecks by either adding a second tubes at each or replacing them. In June 1960, the PTC announced these plans would build a widening of the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel and a replacement around the Laurel Hill Tunnel. The Laurel Hill Bypass was planned because construction would be quicker (and congestion reduction given at a cheaper cost) than would be by boring another tunnel. In June 1962, the commission approved the projects. That August, $21 million, equivalent to $ in , in bonds were sold to finance the projects. Groundbreaking for both the Laurel Hill Bypass and twin Allegheny Mountain Tunnel occurred on September 6, 1962. The Laurel Hill bypass was constructed as a deep cut to the north; the new section would have a wide median and eastbound truck-climbing lane. would require explosives to create a cut into the mountain. The new twin Allegheny Mountain Tunnel would have white tiles, fluorescent lighting, and improved ventilation. The former South Pennsylvania Railroad Allegheny Mountain tunnel was considered for use as a twin of the road bore, but as in the 1930s, was rejected because of its poor condition. The Laurel Hill bypass opened to traffic on October 30, 1964, at a cost of $7.5 million, equivalent to $ in , closing the old alignment permanently. On March 15, 1965, the new Allegheny Mountain Tunnel opened to traffic and the original tube was closed for renovations. It reopened on August 25, 1966. The construction of the second tube at Allegheny Mountain cost $12 million (equivalent to $ in ). With the completion of this project, the entirety of the between the Ohio state line and Rays Hill Tunnel was four or more lanes wide. With the construction complete, the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel became the tunnel closest to the Ohio state line. In addition, the highest point on the turnpike became the Laurel Hill Bypass, beating the former record held by the tunnel itself. After its closure, the old Laurel Hill alignment and tunnel began being used as a storage facility for road salt. Since 2004, the tunnel itself has been used by Chip Ganassi Racing for high-speed race car aerodynamic testing. The tunnel was repaved, equipped with climate control, safety equipment, and data collection systems. The first car he Tested was G-Force Technologies Indycar. This alignment at Laurel Hill is private property. It is routinely patrolled by the Pennsylvania State Police for trespassers.

By the end of 1969, $3,200,000 (equivalent to $ in ) worth of improvements to interchanges were completed. At the Gateway Toll Plaza, three lanes were added, bringing the total up to eleven. At Pittsburgh interchange, its ramps were rebuilt to serve an eastern extension of I-76 with a ten lane toll plaza. At the Harrisburg East Interchange, and the old toll plaza and ramps onto Eisenhower Boulevard at the Harrisburg East Interchange were replaced by a new toll plaza and ramps to serve I-283.

In order to increase safety, the PTC began installing steel barriers at curves and other areas they deemed to have a high amount of accidents in 1957. By 1970, this had been completed.

Studies on how to improve the other tunnels on the mainline were undertaken during the 1960s. After study, the turnpike commission planned to make the entire turnpike east of the Breezewood Interchange at least four lanes by adding a second tube at the tunnels or replacing them with cuts, and in 1965, the turnpike commission announced plans to rebuild the Tuscarora, Kittatinny, and Blue Mountain tunnels into twin facilities, as well as building a replacement around both the Sideling Hill Tunnel and Rays Hill Tunnel. A bypass of the tunnels was considered during the 1930s, but was determined to be too expensive. 

A 1961 study concluded that a bypass would be the best option to handle traffic at Rays Hill and Sideling Hill. The replacement of the two tunnels would have a median, a eastbound truck climbing lane, and wider shoulders. The commission sold $77.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) bonds in January 1966 to finance the project. They also deemed that the bypass of Sideling Hill and Rays Hill would involve construction of a new Breezewood Interchange. This would use part of the original mainline turnpike. The trumpet and toll plaza would be located southwest of Breezewood, as opposed to in it like the original. Contrary to early plans, the new interchange did not directly connect to the road, due to a study completed in 1966 determining such a move would not increase toll revenue. However, recognizing the use of the interchange by Interstate 70 traffic, the new exits toll plaza would be ten lanes wide. Construction of the replacement of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill tunnels began in 1967. It involved blasting a cut across both hills. In building the cut across Rays Hill, part of US 30 had to be realigned. The new road passes over the Sideling Hill Tunnel. This bypass of the two tunnels would have a median with a steel barrier in the middle. It would also have wide shoulders and a eastbound truck climbing lane. The new alignment ends a short distance east of the Cove Valley plaza on the original segment, as well as a short distance west of the original Breezewood Interchange. Because of this, the Sideling Hill plaza was built to replace it, being located on the new stretch. This is the only single building plaza serving travelers in both directions. The turnpike bypass of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill tunnels opened on November 26, 1968. 

Studies concluded that a parallel tunnel was the most economical option at the Tuscarora, Kittatinny, and Blue Mountain as tunnels. Work on the new tube at the Tuscarora Mountain Tunnel began on April 11, 1966, and construction began at the Kittatinny and Blue Mountain tunnels a week later. The parallel tubes at the three tunnels opened on November 26, 1968, and the original tubes were closed or began to be remodeled. The new and remodeled tunnels had fluorescent lighting, white tile walls, and lanes. The portals of the new tunnels were designed to resemble the original tunnels. In October 1970, a replacement Breezewood interchange opened. That month, reconstruction of the original Tuscarora Mountain Tunnel was completed; work on refurbishing the original Kittatinny and Blue Mountain tunnels was finished on March 18, 1971. 

In 2001, the turnpike commission turned over a significant portion of the abandoned section to the Southern Alleghenies Conservancy; bicycles and hikers could use the former roadway. With the completion of this project, the entire mainline was at least four lanes wide, and as such met minimal interstate highway standards. After traffic was diverted to the new alignment, the former stretch passing through the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill tunnels became known as the abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike. The turnpike commission continued to maintain the tunnels for a few years before abandoning them. The abandoned stretch deteriorated; signs and guardrails were removed, pavement began crumbling, trees grew in the median, and vandals and nature began taking over the tunnels. The turnpike commission still performed some maintenance on the abandoned stretch and used it to test pavement-marking equipment. The abandoned stretch of the turnpike is the longest stretch of abandoned freeway in the United States. With the closure of the original Breezewood portion, the longest tunnel became the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel, while the shortest became the Blue Mountain Tunnel. A was also added to the system because of the Sideling/Rays Hill Bypasses&#x27; increased curvature.

In 1968, a PTC contractor proposed a project that would have rebuilt the eastern portion of the road from the Morgantown Interchange and the Delaware River Bridge in order to reduce congestion and limit stops at toll plazas as much as possible. However, due to being too expensive, the PTC quickly scaled this down to relocation of the eastern terminus of the ticket system from the Delaware River Bridge Toll Plaza to the Morgantown Interchange. With this, the portion in between was converted into a barrier toll system, with tolls removed from interchanges, with them instead being collected at plazas along the turnpike. A 1971 study recommended not carrying out this proposal due to a decline in toll revenue.

Ohio planned to eliminate I-80S in 1971, replacing it with a realigned I-76. Because of this, it would also have to be removed from the turnpike west of the Pittsburgh Interchange. Pennsylvania disagreed with the change, recommending that I-80S become I-376. Pennsylvania changed its mind, supporting Ohio&#x27;s plan to renumber I-80S as I-76. In December of that year, the change was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials;, I-76 would follow the turnpike between the Ohio state line and Valley Forge Interchange. The change took effect on October 2, 1972. With this, I-76 was carried on the turnpike between the Ohio state line and Valley Forge Interchange. Signage was updated with this change.

In August 1973, the portion between the New Stanton Interchange and Breezewood Interchange was named the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Highway. 

In 1969, the turnpike commission announced plans to widen the road. It proposed doubling the number of lanes from four to eight, excluding the Philadelphia and Irwin to New Stanton portions, which would instead have been ten lanes. Cars and trucks would use separate roadways. The commission had also proposed a new interchange with I-79 in Carpentertown. The road would have had a speed limit and holographic road signs. The widening would have kept much of the routing intact, but significant reconstruction was proposed between the Allegheny Mountain and Blue Mountain tunnels. Because of the $1.1-billion (equivalent to $ in ) cost and the 1973 oil crisis negative effect on toll revenue, the plan was not implemented.

In 1974, the Northeast Extension was designated PA 9.

Starting in the early 1970s, PennDOT began bypassing the at-grade portion of US 222 in Lancaster County with a new freeway located west of the original. Because of this, when the portion the Reading Interchange served was bypassed, it would need to be replaced in order to connect to the new freeway. Construction began in 1972, alongside the new road. The project involved constructing a long access road with a diamond interchange leading to the new freeway, past there, it traveled to Pennsylvania Route 272, the former surface alignment. The new toll plaza featured five toll lanes, and was the first interchange on the turnpike to use high mast ramp lighting, as well as truck weighing computers, which were much faster than the old machines. The project was completed on April 10, 1974. The truck computers were later installed across the entire road. With this, the project cost $6.6 million, equivalent to $ in . The old ramps overpass was not demolished.

With passage of the National Maximum Speed Law in August 1974, the speed limit on the turnpike was reduced to . 

With the opening of I-79 in Cranberry by 1975, the Perry Highway Interchange was expanded to serve increased traffic levels.

By 1975, the road, most of which was still using a concrete driving surface, had deteriorated significantly. Because of this, the PTC surfaced these portions with an asphalt overlay. This was completed by 1980.

In the 1970s, the PTC proposed major improvements to the portion between the Irwin Interchange and Carlisle Interchange. The Irwin Interchange, New Stanton Interchange, Donegal Interchange, Somerset Interchange, and Carlisle Interchange would all be expanded and renovated. A new westbound truck-climbing lane would be built east of the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel, as well as in New Baltimore; in addition, the existing eastbound truck lane at Laurel Hill was extended west. Construction began in 1978, when the effects of the 1973 oil crisis finally ended. To allow for the new truck lane, which would serve westbound traffic, a new eastbound roadway was built, this was to allow the new eastbound truck lane to use what was originally the four-lane eastbound and westbound road. Overpasses along the effected stretches of road were replaced. The longest of the new truck lanes was the new Allegheny Mountain lane, which was long. The last of the construction was completed on December 2, 1981, at the cost of $70 million, equivalent to $ in .

In 1982, the Fort Littleton Interchange was given rebuilt ramps and a expanded toll plaza.

On September 10, 1983, the Blue Mountain Interchange&#x27;s original two lane toll plaza was replaced with a new four lane toll plaza. The original booth was donated to the Smithsonian Institution.

A study of potentially eliminating toll takers began in 1982, with the introduction of the Automatic Ticket Issuing Machine (ATIM). Also as part of this, new tickets would be introduced, replacing the ones, which, unlike them, would feature a magnetic strip that contained the toll fare and other information. Terminals were also added to the truck computers. Following this study determining that it would reduce congestion, the ticket machines replaced human workers on July 22, 1987. 

By the early 1980s, the section of road in the Philadelphia area had become a bottleneck. Because of this, in June 1983, funding was obtained to widen the turnpike to six lanes between the Valley Forge Interchange and Philadelphia Interchange. The project was put on hold because of disagreements between Governor Dick Thornburgh and members of the turnpike commission. The Pennsylvania legislature approved the project in 1985, with the agreement, the eastern terminus of the six lane alignment would be scaled down to the Norristown Interchange. Construction began on March 10, 1986. In spite of the widened road, no overpasses in the area effected were replaced. Improvements to the Fort Washington Interchange, Willow Grove Interchange, and Philadelphia interchange completed in late 1986. The rest of the widening was completed on November 23, 1987, with a ribbon-cutting at the Philadelphia interchange. The project cost $120 million (equivalent to $ in ).

In 1988, tandem toll booths were added to the Valley Forge Interchange; they were added at the Willow Grove Interchange in 1989.

In July 1989, politician Michael Dawida announced his intentions to pass a bill allowing PennDOT to replace the Breezewood Interchange to provide direct access to Interstate 70, as well as to rebuild the Carlisle Interchange to provide direct access to Interstate 81. He wanted this because both US 30 at the Breezewood Interchange and US 11 at the Carlisle Interchange suffer from chronic congestion due to heavy through traffic traveling to these interstates. He had experienced a crash at the latter a year before. However, the Breezewood proposal was criticized by Breezewood politicians, they instead criticized congestion at the Squirrel Hill Tunnel. He later dropped these proposals.

On October 31, 1989, the one-billionth vehicle traveled on the turnpike, entering through the Irwin Interchange.

===1990s–2000s===
The turnpike commission celebrated the original road&#x27;s 50th anniversary in October 1990. Over $300,000 (equivalent to $ in ) was spent to promote the turnpike with a videotape, souvenirs, and a private party attended by politicians and companies that work with the turnpike. The portion between the Irwin Interchange and Carlisle Interchange was also designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark, in recognition of importance as one of the first US freeways.

In early 1991, a project to expand the Downingtown Interchange was completed.

Call boxes were installed between the New Stanton Interchange and Allegheny Mountain Tunnel in December 1988, with it extending all the way to the Kittatinny Mountain Tunnel by the next year. On July 4, 1990, the PTC introduced the *11 emergency cellular phone number, allowing mobile phones the same functionality. On November 22, 1991, they were equipped along the entire length of the highway. This made it so that the one was located every .

In 1989, construction began on a eastbound truck lane between the Beaver River Bridge and emergency pull off at milepost 15.5, Overpasses needed to be rebuilt to accommodate the work. Unlike the previous truck lanes, no major realignment occurred. Constriction on the project was completed in early 1992.

Plans for an interchange to serve the New Cumberland Defense Depot near Harrisburg was announced in 1985. In September 1992, the turnpike commission scrapped the project.

With plans for the Beaver Valley Expressway made, also came plans for the New Castle Interchange to serve the road. Construction began in November 1990, and on November 20, 1992, this exit opened to traffic.

In the 1980s, plans were made to build the Mid-County interchange, it would serve the north end of the Mid-County Expressway. As part of this, the ramps onto the Northeast Extension were to be rebuilt, and the Norristown Interchange would also be improved with new ramps onto the new highway. The PTC issued an initial contract in March 1989. Construction was delayed when an unsuccessful bidder challenged the commission that June, saying that it violated female and minority contracting rules about the percentage of employees that were used for the project. The PTC approved an initial contract to build it in March 1989. The contract was rebid in November 1989 after a Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruling. As part of this project, a new 19 lane toll plaza was built. The Mid-County Interchange was opened to traffic in November 1992, witch allowed for closure and demolition of the original ramps onto the northeast Extension and completion of their replacements. A ribbon-cutting took place on December 15, 1992, with the replacement ramps onto the Northeast Extension opening the next day. This was the first interchange on the turnpike with flyover ramps.

An interchange was proposed with PA 743 between Elizabethtown and Hershey in 1990. However, a April 1993 study determined that it would not improve traffic flow on local roads.

On July 13, 1995, the speed limit was raised to , except for mainline toll plazas, interchange ramps and toll plazas, the tunnels, and the portion between the Philadelphia Interchange and the New Jersey state line, which did not get the raised limit.

In late 1995, construction was completed on a project to widen the bridge traveling over the Brush Creek Railroad in Irwin with shoulders.

In September 1984, as part of a project to directly connect the turnpike to I-176, the PTC announced plans to replace the Morgantown Interchange. That route had previously been in violation of interstate highway standards, as it had not connected to its parent route. Eight options were considered, with the most expensive being a access road that would have connected to the Morgantown end of that road. This would have cost $33,000,000, equivalent to $ in This was planned to reduce congestion on PA 10. Ultimately, a simpler design was chosen which extended the road to meet a related trumpet at the turnpike itself. Groundbreaking for the new ramps was held on February 28, 1989. The new interchange was built east of the old one, and merged onto the turnpike from the north, rather than the south. However, it was not to have complete access to PA 10, as the old interchange did. The new interchange opened on September 18, 1990, completing the first phase of the Morgantown connector. The overhead lights at the new interchange were considered a nuisance by residents who lived near it. The second phase of the project began in 1994, with the ramps onto I-176 being part of it. On September 27, 1996, these were opened, officially completing the project. which cost $17 million (equivalent to $ in ) split between PennDOT and the PTC.

In Summer 1997, the Harrisburg West Interchanges toll plaza was expanded and ramps rebuilt.

In January 1997, the PTC completed expansion of the Lansdale Interchange’s toll plaza from five lanes to ten lanes. Included in this project was the addition of a parking lot and rebuilt ramps. In Fall of that year, the PTC completed an expansion of the Quakertown Interchange’s toll plaza. Included in this project was the addition of a parking lot and rebuilt ramps.

In Fall 1998, the PTC completed implementation of the Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS). It involved the addition of variable message signs, a traffic flow system, a truck rollover system, a camera system, and an over height vehicle detection system.

In early 1999, the PTC began printing coupons on the back of toll receipts.

In July 2000, the PTC began transmitting HAR signals at all interchanges along the turnpike. Previously, this was only supported at ones connecting to interstate highways.

Construction began on a project to rebuild the stretch between milepost 94 and 99 in June 1998. This work involved replacement of the roadbed and overpasses, widening of the median, addition of shoulders, and replacement of drainage. Work was completed in August 2000, and cost $24 million. It marked the first portion of the road to be entirely rebuilt. 

A $7,000,000 rehabilitation of the Tuscarora Mountain Tunnel was completed in late 2000. As part of this, the fluorescent lighting was replaced with sodium lighting, new pipes were installed to correct a design flaw that caused deterioration, a new wrecker was introduced to replace the old one, repairs were made to the tiling and ceiling slabs, and the original two fan based backup generators were replaced by four powerful diesel generators as part of upgrades to the power distribution system. 

The speed limit was lowered from between the New Stanton Interchange and milepost 130 in April 2001. This was due to the section&#x27;s six degree curves.

In May 1999, reconstruction began on the section between milepost 187 and the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel. The roadbed was rebuilt, overpasses replaced, and shoulders expanded. Work was completed in Summer 2001 at the cost of $50 million. 

In Fall 2001, the PTC ran an advertising campaign called &quot;Peace, Love and the Pennsylvania Turnpike&quot;. It lasted for 90 days and used tie-dyed billboards that resembled those from the 1970s and carried phrases such as &quot;Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day&quot; and &quot;Spread the love. Let someone merge.&quot;

In August 1999, the PTC awarded a contract to reconstruct the road between the New Stanton Interchange and milepost 85. In April 2000, massive potholes developed on the stretch of road. This required the portion to be temporarily closed. Soon after, construction on the work began. It involved, reconstructing the roadbed, widening the median, and expanding the shoulders. The eastbound lanes were completed in October 2000, while the westbound lanes were finished in October 2002.

An electronic toll collection system was first proposed in 1990 in which a motorist would create an account, use an electronic device read from an electronic tollbooth, and be billed later. In 1994, alongside many other northeast toll roads, the PTC created an agreement to implement E-ZPass. This tolling system was planned to go into effect by 1998. In 1996, the PTC announced they were considering the addition of slip ramps in the Philadelphia area as part of the conversion. In 1998, it was announced the implementation of the system was postponed until 2000. Construction began on the Virginia Drive slip ramp in early 2000, it would serve westbound traffic. As part of the implementation, the Valley Forge Interchanges Toll Plaza widened from thirteen lanes to seventeen lanes. On December 2, 2000, E-ZPass was introduced from the Harrisburg West Interchange to the Delaware River Bridge Toll Plaza. concurrency, the new slip ramp onto Virginia Drive opened. On May 19, 2001, E-ZPass was introduced from the Carlisle Interchange to the Gettysburg Pike Interchange. Following this, on December 15, E-ZPass was introduced on the remaining portion from the Blue Mountain Interchange to the Gateway Toll Plaza. On December 14, 2002, the system was introduced to commercial vehicles. Implementation of the system cost $5,100,000(equivalent to $ in ), and saw improved signage and feedback signals installed at all of the toll plazas. Unlike the rest of the exits, the Virginia Drive Slip ramp was not manned, meaning no toll collectors were required to be staffed there.

In October 2000, the PTC announced they would gradually switch the exit numbers of interchanges from the sequential system to milepost system. This would be based on how far east the exit was from the Ohio state line. Installation of the new signage occurred in May 2001. By 2003, the old exit numbers had been retired.

In 1987, plans were announced to build the Cranberry Interchange, which would connect the turnpike to I-79 and US 19 in Cranberry Township. It would replace the Perry Highway Interchange, which had only served the latter. These plans were approved in 1993, with a contract issued in November 1995. In 1997, transportation officials agreed on the interchange&#x27;s design, a drastic simplification of the one initially proposed. The project was planned to include moving the west end of the ticket system from the Gateway Toll Plaza to a new location in Warrendale. This was necessary in order to reduce significant congestion at the Gateway Toll Plaza. The new toll plaza would have standard cash lanes, as well as four express E-ZPass lanes (two in each direction) to let E-ZPass drivers go through the toll plaza at expressway speed. Construction on the first ramps of the Cranberry Interchange began in early 2000. The Warrendale Toll Plaza was delayed by a dispute with Marshall and Pine townships in Allegheny County, who thought that it would cause noise, air, and light pollution. Marshall Township eventually agreed to allow construction in May 2001. Reconstruction of the Gateway Toll Plaza from a ticket facility into a coin drop facility began that October. On top of adding coin drop machinery, the plaza&#x27;s toll lanes were given better heating and cooling systems. Construction of the Warrendale Toll Plaza itself began in February 2002. The westbound Butler service plaza was soon after closed to allow for right of way for the new plaza, aptly named after Warrendale, to use that already used by the existing turnpike. On June 1, 2003, the new fixed rate Gateway Toll Plaza was opened, the New Castle Interchange and Beaver Valley Interchange had their toll plazas eliminated, and the Perry Highway Interchange was closed, and the cash lanes at the Warrendale Toll plaza were opened. The final of the new ramps at the Cranberry Interchange opened on November 12, 2003. In June 2004, the express E-ZPass lanes were completed at the Warrendale toll plaza. The project cost $44 million (equivalent to $ in ), which was split between PennDOT and the PTC.

On July 12, 2001, ground was broken on a project to rebuild the roadway between the Somerset Interchange and Allegheny Mountain Tunnel. Work involved reconstruction of the roadbed to extend its life, expansion of the shoulder and median, as well replacement of seventeen overpasses to accommodate the new shoulders, and a widened median. On March 21, 2002, a $66 million project to rebuild the roadway from mileposts 85 to 94 broke ground. This project reconstructed the Donegal Interchange, rehabilitated seven other overpasses, and built a eastbound truck lane between mileposts 88 and 94 and westbound truck lane between mileposts 93.1 and 92.2. Work on the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel project was originally planned to be completed in Spring 2005 and the Donegal project scheduled to be completed in November 2005, but a fare increase allowed for both to be completed in November 2004.

On November 24, 2004, the day before Thanksgiving, 2,000 Teamsters Union employees went on strike, after contract negotiations failed. This was the first strike in the history of the roadway. As this is usually one of the busiest traffic days in the US, to avoid traffic jams, tolls were waived for the rest of the day. Starting on November 25, turnpike management personnel collected flat-rate passenger tolls of $2 and commercial tolls of $15 from cash customers on the ticketed system, while E-ZPass customers were charged the lesser of the actual toll or the same flat rates. The strike ended after seven days when both sides reached an agreement on November 30, 2004. Normal toll collection resumed December 1, 2004.

On January 29, 2005, the service road at the Reading Interchange was officially named Colonel Howard Boulevard.

The PTC approved raising the speed limit to for the entire length of the turnpike in April 2005. This excluded tunnels, mainline toll plazas, interchange ramps and toll plazas, the portion between the New Stanton Interchange and milepost 130, and the portion between the Bensalem Interchange and the Delaware River Bridge.

In July 2005, the PTC completed a $3,500,000 (equivalent to $ in ) project that eliminated 131 low capacity emergency pull offs along the entire road. These were intended for motorists in an emergency or commercial vehicles needing to stop, however a study completed in June 1998 which determined they were to much of a safety hazard, as commercial vehicles were too big for them. However, this was criticized as making these truckers more likely to stay on the road even when tried, as there was a gap between the larger pull offs.

In October 2005, the PTC, in conjunction with PennDOT, completed the addition of four express E-ZPass lanes at the Mid-County Interchange, marking the second of these to be added.

In July 2004, construction began on rebuilding the portion of road between milepost 38 and the Butler Valley Interchange. Work was completed by December 2005.

In March 2007, the PTC announced that it had removed the steps leading to St. John&#x27;s Church in New Baltimore because they were a safety hazard and violated interstate highway standards.

In December 2005, the PTC began construction on a project to widen the toll plazas, expand the utility buildings, and rebuild the roadway and associated structures at both the Gettysburg Pike Interchange and Lebanon-Lancaster Interchange. The work was completed in October 2007 at a cost of $30 million (equivalent to $ in ).

In September 2000, the PTC announced plans to build a six lane concrete segmental bridge to replace the old four lane deck truss span over the Susquehanna River. Work began on the six-lane bridge, which cost $150 million (equivalent to $ in ), four years later. In March 2005, as part of the project, work began on realignment of a section of roadway near the bridge. In November, work began on improvement of the Harrisburg East Interchange, its toll plaza was expanded to nine lanes, and its ramps replaced to accommodate the widened mainline. A ribbon-cutting was held for completion of the westbound bridge on May 16, 2007, and it opened to traffic the following day. The eastbound bridge opened in June. Demolition of the old bridge began on August 22, and was completed on September 5. The rest of the realignment was completed in June 2008. The entire project cost $150,000,000.

In November 2006, Governor Ed Rendell and Pennsylvania House Speaker John Perzel proposed leasing the turnpike long-term to a private group to raise money to improve other infrastructure in the state. Such a lease was thought to raise up to $30 billion (equivalent to $ in ) for the state. In October 2007, 34 companies submitted 14 proposals to lease the turnpike. On May 19, 2008, a record $12.8-billion (equivalent to $ in ) proposal by Abertis, a Spain-based firm, and Citigroup in New York City to lease the turnpike was submitted. The consortium withdrew the offer on September 30, 2008, as they reasoned the proposal would not be approved in the state legislature.

Plans were made to widen the road to six lanes between the Valley Forge Interchange and Norristown Interchange in the 1990s. In order to allow for such, construction began on a second Schuylkill River Bridge in 1998. Work was completed a month early in May 2000. Work on the rest of the widening began in October 2004. As part of the work, the Norristown Interchange had its toll plaza expanded, the E-ZPass lanes were also improved. Work west of the Schuylkill River was completed on December 22, 2006. Work on widening east of the bridge was completed on November 21, 2008. The entire project cost $330 million (equivalent to $ in ).

A project was undertaken to widen the turnpike to six lanes between the Gateway Toll Plaza and New Castle Interchange. The first phase began in September 2005. This involved rebuilding the overpasses between mileposts 4 and milepost 9, and was completed in November 2006. The second phase, which began in early 2006, involved rebuilding the roadway. It also saw conversion of the Gateway Toll Barrier, from a toll plaza that tolled in both directions with no express lanes, into eastbound only plaza with express E-ZPass lanes, as had been at the Warrendale Toll Plaza since completion. This phase of work was completed in July 2007. Widening of the section between the Gateway Toll Barrier and the New Castle Interchange began in January 2007 and was completed on May 21, 2009. The entire project cost $132,000,000.

In December 2009, the PTC renamed the Philadelphia Interchange the Bensalem Interchange, as that town was had petitioned to do so. With this, tickets at the toll plaza were updated, and signage replaced.

===2010s–present===
On April 28, 2010, Governor Ed Rendell proposed that maintenance of the turnpike be taken over by PennDOT. A special session of the state legislature voted on this issue on May 4, choosing not to go with this plan.

Plans were announced to build a pair of concrete replacement bridges over the Allegheny River in 2005. Work began in May 2007. As with the Susquehanna River Work, the turnpike was partially replaced to meet with the new bridges. The Allegheny Valley Interchange ramps onto the turnpike was demolished and rebuilt as to meet with the new alignment. A dedication ceremony was held on October 23, 2009. The bridges, which cost $194 million (equivalent to $ in ), opened to traffic the following day. Demolition of the old bridge began after, a controlled implosion to take down part of it occurred on July 13, 2010, a second implosion occurred on July 30 to try to bring down another other half, though this failed, with workers having to weld the superstructures piers in strategic locations until the remaining portion of the structure fell down. Work on the $193,600,000(equivalent to $ in ) project was largely completed when the westbound bridge was opened on November 15.

Plans were made for an eastbound slip ramp with PA 132 in 2004. This was to provide better access to Parx Casino and Racing, one of the biggest gambling facilities in Pennsylvania, which had been causing congestion at the nearby interchanges since its opening in 1974. In order to allow for this, the South Neshaminy Plaza was permanently closed on July 30, 2007. A contract for this in May 2009, and construction began that November. The ramp was opened to traffic on November 22, 2010, at the cost $7,400,000 (equivalent to $ in ).

In December 2010, the PTC announced they were considering the removal toll rates from tickets. Ultimately, after backlash, they announced this would not occur in January 2011.

In 2005, plans were announced to widen the road to six lanes between the Irwin Interchange and New Stanton Interchange. As part of the project, the Hempfield service plaza was closed in January 2007. Work was completed in November 2011.

On July 23, 2009, widening of the roadway to six lanes began between the Warrendale Toll Plaza and Butler Valley Interchange. Work involved replacing three overpasses, and building a new alignment between milepost 32.4 and milepost 35.5. It was completed in November 2012 at the cost of $113,000,000.

On September 26, 2012, the PTC began a program to introduce a new ATIM system. These printed new tickets, which were 1.75inches longer, printed on thermal paper, and lacked magnetic strips the old tickets had. In addition, the tickets were not preprinted, meaning that more ink was saved in comparison to the old system. The first two interchanges to get the new machines were the Willow Run Interchange and Lebanon-Lancaster Interchange. After this test was completed, starting on October 1, the new machines were installed at the rest of the low volume interchanges, and by December 6, the high volume interchanges had also transitioned to the new system. This was done because the old ATIM system had become obsolete, and if left in use past 2012, they would have been expensive to maintain due to a shortage of parts.

In 1998, plans were announced for a slip ramp at PA 252. Residents opposed the plan, fearing that it would impact the area. In 1999, the commission altered these plans so that a ramp would be built at PA 29 instead. The PTC approved funding for the slip ramp in 2002, but the project was temporarily put on hold in 2009 because of engineering and design problems. It was announced that the commission would approve construction of the slip ramp at PA 29 in August 2010, and construction began the following March. The new ramp became the only E-ZPass interchange, as it was accessible in both directions. It opened on December 11, 2012; Governor Tom Corbett cut the ribbon.

On June 22, 2012, the PTC began a $4.5 million project to reconstruct the Somerset Interchanges access road. Some of the old connections to local roads were eliminated, and two new ones were created to supplement them. This was completed in Summer 2013.

On June 17, 2014, the road was officially dedicated as a Blue Star Memorial Highway, in honor of the veterans who served at the PTC.

In March 2013, Montgomery County officials announced they were considering more slip ramps along the turnpike to ease traffic congestion. The Pennsylvania Turnpike Corridor Reinvestment Project was released in 2015, with plans to build additional interchanges along the turnpike in Montgomery County to revitalize adjacent business parks. Proposed locations for new interchanges included PA 63 near Willow Grove, and Henderson Road in Upper Merion Township. There were also plans to add eastbound ramps at the existing Virginia Drive interchange, ramps at the Valley Forge interchange connecting to First Avenue and Moore Road in King of Prussia, a ramp at the Fort Washington interchange to Commerce Drive, and the reconstruction of the Willow Grove Interchange into an at-grade intersection. None of this ever occurred primarily due to the conversion to all electronic tolling.

In 2014, a reconstruction began between milepost 99 and milepost 102. This involved replacement of the pedestrian overpass at milepost 101, reconstruction of the roadbed, replacement of the drainage, and replacement of the median. This was completed in October 2015, at the cost of $39,000,000.

The speed limit was increased to between the Blue Mountain and Morgantown interchanges on July 22, 2014, as part of a test. On March 15, 2016, the PTC approved raising the speed limit on the remainder of the road to except for sections posted with a limit; the speed limit increased to on the sections of the road on May 3 of that year. It remains in construction zones, tunnels, mainline toll plazas, and the portion between the Bensalem Interchange and the New Jersey state line. 

On April 22, 2014, a groundbreaking ceremony was held to reconstruct the road between mileposts 250 and 252. Work on this $47.65 million project, which also installed sound barriers, was completed in August 2016.

In 2015, implementation of support for credit and debit cards on ATIMs began, with the first interchange to get it being Willow Hill. By October of the following year, the entire road accepted the new payment option. This was meant as a last resort for cash users who ran out of money before reaching their destination, because of this, it was the least used of the three toll options.

In November 2016, the PTC completed a project that rebuilt the road at milepost 128 in order to eliminate a known rockslide area.

The turnpike had originally used traffic lights as feedback signals for E-ZPass users. On March 17, 2017, the PTC announced that it would remove these alongside an upgrade to the toll equipment; they did not conform to federal signage guidelines.

In September 2017, the PTC removed call boxes due to increased mobile-phone use.

In 2013, work began on a widening to six lanes between the Harrisburg West Interchange and Susquehanna River Bridge. Overpass replacement began that year, with construction on the actual road widening beginning in 2014. Work on the project was completed in Spring 2018 at the cost of $92,000,000.

A project was undertaken to widen the road to six lanes between the Blue Mountain Tunnel and the Carlisle Interchange. This work involved replacement of the underpass at the Blue Mountain Interchange with an overpass, reconstruction of eighteen overpasses, and realignment of a short portion near the tunnel&#x27;s portal. Business owners in the area had proposed building a slip ramp near the Carlisle Interchange in order to reduce congestion, though this did not occur. Work was completed by the end of 2018 at the cost of $500,000,00.

In early 2015, the PTC completed addition of ticket processing machines (TPMs) at the Willow Hill Interchange. This allowed non cash users to pay much faster, as rather than handing the ticket in then handling cash and awaiting change, they could simply feed the ticket into a dispenser and receive a confirmation record. Following this, in January 2019, they were implemented at the Fort Littleton Interchange and Blue Mountain Interchange.

In September 2019, the turnpike launched a smartphone app for paying tolls.

In August 2013, construction began on a project to widen the road to six lanes between the milepost 40 and the Allegheny Valley Interchange. Work involved reconstructing bridge structures, with the sole exception being the McClelland Road underpass, which was fully demolished. It was completed on October 17, 2019, at the cost of $200 million. 

In March 2017, construction began on improvements to the Donegal Interchange. A new traffic signal and realigned intersection end were built. This was completed in October 2020.

In 2021, construction began on a project to widen the road to six lanes between the Cranberry Interchange and Warrendale Toll Plaza. It was completed in September 2022. 

Reconstruction of the ramps into US 1 from the Bensalem Interchange began in November 2018 and was completed in December 2022.

In May 2019, the PTC began a project to rehabilitate the Tuscarora Mountain Tunnel. As part of this, the eastbound bore ceiling was rebuilt to taking on a new arch ceiling, while both were given new LED lighting, improved conduit, new tiling with better waterproofing, new variable messages signs, a water collection system, and new, wider driving lanes and a resurfaced approach road with repaired bridges. They also replaced the ventilation, repainted the portals, replaced the switch gears and generators, as well as expanding the guard office space. Work was completed in January 2024.

Construction to widen the section between milepost 102 and the Somerset Interchange began in January 2021. It involved bypassing some curves of the turnpike with new ones. Work was completed in August 2024.

In October 2024, support for Apple Pay and Google Pay was introduced.

In 2026, reconstruction will be completed between milepost 126 and 131.

In late 2021, construction began to replace the functionally obsolete Hawk Falls Bridge that carries I-476 over Mud Run in Carbon County. The replacement bridge will be a long steel bridge that will include shoulders. Construction of the replacement bridge is expected to be completed in the middle part of 2026.

In 2004, plans were announced to widen the highway to six lanes between the Downingtown Interchange and Valley Forge Interchange. Three years later, the project&#x27;s western terminus was scaled back from Downingtown to the proposed PA 29 slip ramp. Plans for the widening were presented to the public in 2009. Later that year, the widening was put on hold because of engineering problems; it resumed in 2010. Work was scheduled to begin in 2013, with completion in 2015. In October 2012, the project was postponed a year because of delays in permit approvals. The project is being split into two phases: one between the PA 252 overpass and the Valley Forge interchange, and the other between the PA 29 interchange and the PA 252 overpass. Construction began on September 27, 2021, with the new lanes opening to traffic in October 2024 and all work expected to be completed in May 2025. Reconstruction and widening of the turnpike from the Downingtown interchange east to the Valley Hill Road overpass began in early 2023, with completion planned for 2027. As part of the project, the ramps at the Downingtown interchange are being rebuilt.

In 2012, the PTC announced that they were planning to replace the Beaver River Bridge, the last deck truss bridge. While not structurally deficient, it has a similar design to the I-35W Mississippi River Bridge, which collapsed in 2007, and is functionally obsolete. As part of this, the Beaver Valley Interchange was also to be rebuilt from a trumpet interchange into a partial diamond interchange. Soon after, they set aside nearly $300 million to replace the bridge, and began the design phase. In September 2013, the PTC began the work, which would at first replace a number of bridges between mileposts 12 and 14. This was completed in November 2017, allowing for future widening from four to six lanes. The first phase was completed in December 2022 and the PTC began the second phase: the widening to six lanes. In September 2024, as part of the project, temporary ramps at the Beaver Valley Interchange were opened to the old ones could be systematically demolished. Work is expected to be competed in September 2027 at a cost of $292 million. 

In 2010, McCormick Taylor and Wilbur Smith Associates were hired by the PTC to conduct a feasibility study on converting the road to all-electronic tolling. On March 6, 2012, the turnpike commission announced that it was implementing this plan. The turnpike commission projected that it would save $65 million annually on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. The first plazas to be converted were the toll plazas at the end of the turnpike. The Delaware River Bridge Toll Plaza was demolished and a westbound all-electronic barrier installed in its place by January 2016, becoming the first on the turnpike to do so. On October 27, 2019, all-electronic tolling was implemented at the express lanes at the Gateway Toll Barrier. All-electronic tolling was originally scheduled to be implemented between the Gateway Toll Barrier and Neshaminy Falls Toll Barrier, as well as on the Northeast Extension, in late 2021. In March 2020, the turnpike made the switch early as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. With this, the E-ZPass, previously restricted to E-ZPass users, had this restriction removed. The all-electronic tolling system on the turnpike will initially use toll booths at exits until mainline toll gantries between interchanges are constructed. Construction on the gantries began in 2023. They also determined a new tolling structure would be implemented, with tolls calculated based on length rather than weight. Mainline toll gantries are planned to be in operation on January 5, 2025, from of the east of the Reading Interchange to the eastern end of the ticket system in Neshaminy Falls. It will be in operation by January 2027 at the Gateway Toll Plaza, as well from the east of the east end of the ticket system at Warrendale to the east of the Lebanon-Lancaster Interchange. Demolition of the toll plazas will be completed by mid-2028.

Plans for an interchange between the turnpike and I-95 in Bristol Township to connect portions of I-95 in Pennsylvania and the New Jersey Turnpike were proposed in 1978. The roads did not have an interchange because earlier laws (since repealed) prohibited federal funds from being used to connect toll roads. In 1982, the federal government mandated that the interchange be built in Pennsylvania. A gap existed on I-95 because of the unbuilt Somerset Freeway segment in central New Jersey. Under the plan, I-95 would be rerouted off of its original alignment through Trenton, and routed onto the portion of turnpike between the new interchange and the New Jersey state line. This would result in the elimination of I-276 along the stretch, now terminating east at the interchange. I-95 would follow the Pearl Harbor Extension, which ends at the mainline New Jersey Turnpike. This would create a continuous route through New Jersey, and allow for I-295 to be extended. Area residents who thought the interchange would lead to a decline in their quality of life opposed the plan. An environmental impact statement (EIS) was released in 2003, with this it was revealed that the project would also included widening and a new eastern end of the ticket system to be located before the interchange. The interchange received environmental approval in 2004, the preliminary design was completed in 2008, and the final design followed. 

The project involved building a high-speed interchange between the roads. A new toll plaza was built east of the Street Road interchange at Neshaminy Falls to mark the eastern end of the ticket system. It consisted of high-speed E-ZPass lanes and ticket and cash booths, and the former Delaware River Bridge toll barrier converted to serve westbound traffic only, and the Delaware Valley Interchange had its toll plaza removed. A new bridge was to be built over the Delaware River. Work on the project began in late 2010, and two bridges over the turnpike were replaced in 2011. Groundbreaking for the interchange with I-95 took place on July 30, 2013, with Governor Corbett in attendance. The project&#x27;s first stage, which includes the new toll plaza, widening and flyover ramps between I-95 and the turnpike, was projected to cost $420 million and the flyover ramps were projected to cost $142.9 million, with $100 million from federal funds and the remainder from the turnpike commission. The PTC borrowed money from foreign investors to fund the project, and the commission entered a partnership with the Delaware Valley Regional Center (DVRC) in 2014 to raise half the funds needed to construct the interchange. The EB-5 visa program was projected to allow the commission, through the DVRC, to save about $35 million of traditional borrowing costs over five years. Construction of the interchange&#x27;s first stage, the Neshaminy Falls Toll Plaza, began later that year. The Neshaminy Falls Toll plaza opened in January 2016, at this point, while the Delaware Valley Interchanges toll plaza was closed, and the Delaware River Bridge Toll Plaza was demolished and replaced by a westbound fixed rate Toll Gantry. This was the first of its kind on the turnpike. Signage was also updated at the Delaware Valley Interchange to remove its name. Flyover ramps between northbound I-95 and the eastbound turnpike and between the westbound turnpike and southbound I-95 opened on September 22, 2018. This completed I-95, which runs from Florida north to Maine. Part of the Interstate Highway System, it serves over 110 million people in over 10 percent of the total US land area. Its development began as part of the Federal-Aid Highway Act in 1956. With this, the portion of the turnpike between the new interchange and the New Jersey state line became part of I-95 while the eastern terminus of I-276 was cut back to the new interchange. Signs depicting turnpike shields and mile markers were removed, with signs depicting I-95 mile markers and shields were put in their place. exit 358 was also renumbered as exit 42, being based on I-95 exit numbers. The exit 42 ramp to US 13 was rebuilt from a trumpet into an at-grade intersection, this was completed in 2020. 

Long-term plans call for the construction of missing connections with I-95 and I-295, as well as and widening the turnpike to six lanes between the Bensalem interchange and New Jersey state line. This would include the reconstruction of the exit 42&#x27;s ramps from and off of the turnpike, as well a replacement of the Delaware River Bridge with a new span, which is expected to begin construction in 2025 at the earliest. The remaining stages of the project are unfunded, with an estimated cost of $1.1 billion. Once this project is completed, the entire road between the Downingtown Interchange and New Jersey state line will be six lanes wide.

==Future==
On September 24, 2024, the PTC announced plans to widen the stretch between mileposts 160 and 163 to six lanes; this would also involve replacement of the Breezewood interchange to add a connection between the turnpike and I-70. The project is planned to begin its preliminary design phase in 2025, with construction underway by 2027.

A slip ramp was planned in 2000 as part of a revitalization plan to connect Lafayette Street with the turnpike in Norristown. Construction of the Lafayette Street extension began in 2013, and was completed the following year. On January 7, 2015, the commission committed $45 million (equivalent to $ in ) to building the interchange. The commission&#x27;s Fiscal Year 2017 Capital Plan included $66 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the Lafayette Street interchange. The design phase began in 2017, with preliminary engineering in 2018 and 2019. Construction of the Lafayette Street interchange is expected to begin in 2027 and be completed in 2029. The project would involve extending Lafayette Street to the new ramp. The proposed slip ramp is projected to cost $160 million (equivalent to $ in ). Montgomery County officials have proposed a surcharge for the new exit to help pay for the project. 

A 1996 study on improving the Allegheny Mountain portion by building a replacement tube or a cut was made. Based on the study, the commission planned to replace the deteriorating tunnel with a cut through the mountain. These plans were postponed indefinitely in 2001 because it would cost $93.7 million (equivalent to $ in ), though were revived in 2009. The nearby Mountain Field and Stream Club prefers that the tunnels be improved or a new tube built rather than the bypass. The narrow Allegheny Mountain Tunnel is deteriorating, with disintegrating ceiling slabs and outdated lighting and ventilation. On October 22, 2013, the PTC announced plans to replace the tunnels (the older of which was 73 years old) with new tunnels or a bypass due to the age and condition of the 1940 tunnel and the need for additional capacity. About 11 million vehicles use the tunnel every year. On December 24, 2014, the PTC announced that it was going forward with plans to replace the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel. Six options are being considered, three of which would include bypasses via rock blasting; the other three would involve boring two new tunnels (presumably three lanes each) to accommodate the PTC&#x27;s long-term plans to widen the mainline turnpike to six lanes except for the tunnels. If the PTC builds new tunnels, the existing Allegheny Mountain Tunnels would be closed to traffic and repurposed. Although the projected costs for a bypass would be less than half that of boring new tunnels and would require $3 million less for annual maintenance of each tunnel, the Mountain Field and Stream Club (a local hunting group which owns of land around the tunnel) opposed the replacement option; the group had also opposed plans to replace the tunnels in 2001. In February 2020, the PTC decided that the tunnel would be bypassed with a new road to the south. Such a plan is expected to be cheaper and have less environmental impact than a new tunnel. The project is under environmental review; design is expected to take three to four years, and construction will take another three years. The bypass will be six lanes, with a truck climbing lane westbound. The new alignment will include an overpass for use by wildlife that use the forests above the tunnel, and a new underpass would be built to replace the existing culvert at the Raystown Branch Juniata River. Another new underpass will be built at PA 60, directly parallel to the existing one. They would also replace the maintenance facility that currently resides on the westbound side at the western portal of the tunnel with a new one located on the bypass. The new road will cost an estimated $332.4 million. If this project is to be competed, then hazardous vehicles would no longer need to exit at interchange before it on both directions of the turnpike. 

The PTC made plans to widen the portion of road between the Pittsburgh Interchange and Irwin Interchange to six lanes. As part of this, on July 16, 2019, they voted to allocate $30 million to its 10-Year Capital Plan for a new interchange from the turnpike to PA 130 in Penn Township, between exits 57 and 67. As part of this, overpases are being replaced. A Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission study found that PA 130 would need to be widened to accommodate the additional traffic, costing about $38 million and bringing the total project cost to about $68 million. The project needs coordination between the turnpike commission and PennDOT (which maintains PA 130), and is supported by the Westmoreland County Chamber of Commerce. On October 28, 2021, it was announced that design work on project would begin; it is projected to be completed by 2038.

In January 2013, the PTC awarded a contract for a project that would widen the road to six lanes between the Morgantown Interchange and Downingtown Interchange. This will involve rebuilding many overpasses along the stretch, including the Morgantown Interchanges. Initially expected to begin in 2018 and be completed by 2020, it has since been rescheduled.

<text>Robert Dean Silva Burnquist (; born 10 October 1976) is a Brazilian-American professional skateboarder who competed for Brazil throughout his career. In 2010, he became the first skateboarder to land a &quot;fakie 900&quot; (900-degree reverse-natural rotation), making Burnquist the fifth person in history to successfully complete the 900 trick.

== Early life ==

Burnquist was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to parents Dean Riley Burnquist and Dora Silva. His father is American of Swedish descent, while his mother is Brazilian from Minas Gerais. He has two sisters, Rebecca and Milena. He began his skateboarding training in his hometown of São Paulo at 11 years old, and turned professional at 14. He holds dual citizenship in Brazil and the United States.

==Career==

Burnquist&#x27;s specialties are switch stance skateboarding, and creating vert tricks. He has a signature trick called the &quot;Wee Willy grind&quot;.

In 2000, Burnquist won the X Games&#x27; best trick contest, with his famous Fakie 5–0 with a fakie kickflip off of the grind bar.

Burnquist&#x27;s biggest success to date came in the vert contest at the 2001 X Games. Prior to his final run (the last run of the event), he was sitting in second place behind two-time defending champion, Bucky Lasek. Burnquist produced a flawless run, including multiple tricks that had never been seen before and, as a result, were unnamed. Burnquist was rewarded with a score of 98 out of 100, the second highest score ever given in any X Games skateboarding event, behind only Bucky Lasek&#x27;s score of a 98.50 the year before.

Burnquist won a gold medal in the 2005 X Games Best Trick vert contest, placing fourth in the vert section, and sixth in the Big Air contest.

In 2006, Burnquist completed a BASE jump after attempting a 50-50 into the Grand Canyon. The first attempt nearly cost Burnquist his life after he missed the rail and fell out of control, before regaining himself and successfully deploying his parachute. After some adjustments to the take-off ramp, his second attempt went flawlessly. This stunt was shown in an episode of the television show Stunt Junkies.

At the 2013 X Games in Barcelona, Burnquist became the first skater to ever win gold on four consecutive occasions in Skateboard Big Air (2011–2012 in Los Angeles, 2013 Foz do Iguaçu, 2013 Barcelona being his prior victories). He also tied BMX rider Dave Mirra as the athlete with the most career X Games medals, with 24. In the 2013 X Games in Munich, Burnquist continued to make history by winning another gold medal in Skateboard Big Air, extending his win streak in the event to five consecutive years - another new record, and making him the sole owner of the record for most career X Games medals in history, with 25.

At X Games Austin 2015, Burnquist won the gold medal in Skateboard Big Air, after having sustained a non-displaced fracture of his left forearm which he suffered during vert practice the same week. On day three, Burnquist won another gold medal in Big Air Doubles, in its very first appearance in X Games. His partner was BMX rider Morgan Wade as they scored a total of 90 points (43 from Morgan, 47 from Burnquist). Burnquist finished off Austin 2015 with a silver in Vert best trick, bringing him to a total of 30 Summer X Games medals, including 14 gold, with both stats being records.

At X Games Minneapolis 2017, Burnquist announced his retirement from the X Games, having earned at least one medal at the event every year from 1997 through 2015 (with the exception of 2004). He holds the record for most medals won at the X Games by an individual, with a total of 30 (14 gold, 8 silver and 8 bronze), and shares the record for most gold medals at the Summer X Games, with a total of 14 (tied with Dave Mirra and Jamie Bestwick). He is the only person to have competed in every single X Games summer event, beginning with the inaugural competition in 1995, every year through to 2017.

== Bob Burnquist&#x27;s Dreamland ==
Burnquist&#x27;s home in Vista, California is home to his private skate park, Dreamland. The first build in his backyard skate park was a Wooden Vert Bowl (which was later concreted). This was followed by a metal full pipe, a loop with an opening gap in the roof (built for King of Skate 2002) and a corkscrew.

The Vert Bowl has been skated by dozens of skateboarders, including Colin McKay, Tony Hawk, Rune Glifberg, Bucky Lasek, and Lincoln Ueda, and has been featured in hundreds of magazines and videos, including Tony Hawk&#x27;s Trick Tips and &quot;Thrasher Magazine&quot;.

The biggest build on the site is the Megaramp. Burnquist&#x27;s Megaramp is one of the world&#x27;s few permanent Mega Ramps. The ramp is made up of a 50–70 foot gap jump, followed straight away by a 30-foot quarterpipe. Burnquist opens the ramp to other professionals to enable them to train for Mega ramp competitions and to help advance the progress of tricks on the Mega Ramp. Skateboarders such as Elliot Sloan, Danny Way and Jake Brown have all made use of the ramp.

The latest major addition to the park was a hip ramp built at a 90° angle to the quarter pipe section of the Mega Ramp. This addition was built in 2013 as part of the filming of Burnquist&#x27;s video &quot;Dreamland&quot;.

In 2013, Burnquist, alongside his sponsor Oakley, released a major video part titled &quot;Oakley&#x27;s-Bob Burnquist&#x27;s &quot;Dreamland&quot;&quot;. The video is all filmed within the Dreamland compound.

==Media==
In 1994, Burnquist appeared in a short clip talking about the effects of gravity on the second episode (aptly titled &quot;Gravity&quot;) of the first season of &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy.&quot;

Burnquist has been featured in the video game, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot;, and has appeared in every game in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; series up to &quot;Proving Ground&quot;, with the exception of &quot;Pro Skater 3&quot;, due to a result of his appearance in another skateboarding game, &quot;ESPN X Games Skateboarding&quot;, during that time.

In 2004, Burnquist made a guest appearance as himself on the popular TV series, &quot;Kim Possible&quot;. Burnquist was also featured in a commercial for Aero chocolate bars. He also made a brief cameo in the 2003 skateboarding film &quot;Grind&quot;.

In 2013, Burnquist appeared as himself on season 2, episode 4 of Stan Lee&#x27;s &quot;Superhumans&quot;.

==Philanthropy==
Burnquist started the Bob Burnquist Foundation to bring knowledge about organic farming and gardening to schools, and was one of the founders of the Action Sports Environmental Coalition, a nonprofit organization that brings ecological awareness to skateboarders, surfers and BMXers. In an interview in 2010, Burnquist stated, &quot;Well, the latest is that we&#x27;re working with a restaurant chain called the Chipotle Grill- they&#x27;ve got good values, trying to make food with integrity- and I&#x27;m starting an organic garden that they&#x27;ve committed to studying and seeing what they can use in their own kitchens.&quot;

In May 2020 Burnquist founded the Instituto Skate Cuida as an initiative to support vulnerable communities in Brazil and elsewhere by using skateboarding as an introduction to arts, culture, education, and skills development including programming and web3. The Institute has partnerships with various institutions such as Banco do Brasil, Ademáfia Institute, Nova Era Institute, and CemporcentoSKATE. The Instituto Skate Cuida maintains a fundraising project on the public goods-focused, web3-based platform Giveth.

<text>Club Atlético de Madrid, S.A.D. (; meaning &quot;Athletic Club of Madrid&quot;), commonly referred to as Atlético Madrid or simply Atlético, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid that plays in La Liga. The club play their home games at the Riyadh Air Metropolitano, which has a capacity of 70,692.

Founded on 26 April 1903 as Athletic Club Sucursal de Madrid, the club have traditionally worn red and white vertical striped shirts, being known as &quot;Los Colchoneros&quot; (&quot;The Mattress Makers&quot;) and &quot;Los Rojiblancos&quot; (&quot;The Redwhites&quot;). The club became Atlético de Madrid in 1946 and began a long-standing rivalry with Madrid neighbours Real Madrid, with whom they contest &quot;El Derbi Madrileño&quot;. They also share a rivalry with Barcelona. Felipe VI, the King of Spain, has been the honorary president of the club since 2003.

Atlético are one of the most successful Spanish clubs, having won 11 La Liga titles, including a league and cup double in 1996. Further domestic trophies include 10 titles, two Supercopas de España, one and one Copa Eva Duarte. They have also won numerous titles in Europe, including the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1962, the UEFA Europa League in 2010, 2012 and 2018, and the UEFA Super Cup in 2010, 2012 and 2018, as well as the 1974 Intercontinental Cup. In the UEFA Champions League, Atlético reached the final in 1974, 2014 and 2016.

==History==
===Foundation and first years (1903–1939)===

The club was founded on 26 April 1903 as &quot;Athletic Club Sucursal de Madrid&quot; by three Basque students living in Madrid. These founders saw the new club as a youth branch of their childhood team, Athletic Bilbao who they had just seen win the 1903 Copa del Rey Final in the city. In 1904, they were joined by dissident members of Real Madrid. They began playing in blue and white halved shirts, the then colours of Athletic Bilbao, but by 1910, both the Bilbao and Madrid teams were playing in their current colours of red and white stripes. Some believe the change came about because red and white striped tops were the cheapest to make, as the same combination was used to make ticking for mattresses, and the unused cloth was easily converted into football shirts. This contributed to the club&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Los Colchoneros&quot;.

However, another explanation is that both Athletic Bilbao and Athletic Madrid used to buy Blackburn Rovers&#x27; blue and white kits in England. In late 1909, Juan Elorduy, a former player and member of the board of Athletic Madrid, went to England to buy kits for both teams but failed to find Blackburn kits to purchase; he instead bought the red and white shirts of Southampton (the club from the port city which was his embarkation point back to Spain). (Official position of both Southampton FC and Athletic Club). Athletic Madrid adopted the red and white shirt, leading to them being known as &quot;Los Rojiblancos&quot;, but opted to keep their existing blue shorts whereas the Bilbao team switched to new black shorts. Athletic Bilbao won the 1911 Copa del Rey Final using several &#x27;borrowed&#x27; players from Athletic Madrid, including who scored one of their goals.

Athletic&#x27;s first ground, the Ronda de Vallecas, was in the eponymous working-class area on the south side of the city. In 1919, the Compañía Urbanizadora Metropolitana—the company that ran the underground communication system in Madrid—acquired some land, near the Ciudad Universitaria. In 1921, Athletic Madrid became independent of parent-club Athletic Bilbao and moved into a 35,800-seater stadium built by the company, the Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid.

During the 1920s, Athletic won the &quot;Campeonato del Centro&quot; three times and were runners-up in 1921, where they faced parent club Athletic Bilbao, as they would again in 1926. Based on these successes, in 1928 they were invited to join the Primera División of the inaugural La Liga played the following year. During their debut La Liga campaign, the club was managed by Fred Pentland, but after two seasons they were relegated to Segunda División. They briefly returned to La Liga in 1934 but were relegated again in 1936 after Josep Samitier took over in mid-season from Pentland. The Spanish Civil War gave &quot;Los Colchoneros&quot; a reprieve, as Real Oviedo was unable to play due to the destruction of their stadium during the bombings. Thus, both La Liga and Athletic&#x27;s relegation were postponed, the latter by winning a playoff against Osasuna, champion of the Segunda División tournament.

===Athletic Aviación de Madrid (1939–1947)===
By 1939, when La Liga had resumed, Athletic had merged with &quot;Aviación Nacional&quot; of Zaragoza to become &quot;Athletic Aviación de Madrid&quot;. Aviación Nacional had been founded in 1937 by three aviation officers of the Spanish Air Force. They had been promised a place in the Primera División for the 1939–40 season, only to be denied by the RFEF, and since they did not want to go through the whole divisional climb up, this club merged with Athletic, whose squad had lost eight players during the Civil War, including the team&#x27;s star, Monchín Triana, who was shot dead. At that time, Real Oviedo also had its field destroyed by the war, so it was decided to give up its place to another team, and that finals spot was contested by Aviación and Osasuna, in a match in Valencia on 26 November 1939, which Aviación won 3–1. With the legendary Ricardo Zamora as manager, the club subsequently won their first La Liga title that season and retained the titles in 1941. The most influential and charismatic player of these years was the captain Germán Gómez, who was signed from Racing Santander in 1939. He played eight consecutive seasons for the &quot;Rojiblancos&quot; until the 1947–48 campaign. From his central midfield position, he formed a legendary midfield alongside Machín and Ramón Gabilondo.

In mid-1940, a decree issued by Francisco Franco banned teams from using foreign names and the club became &quot;Atlético Aviación de Madrid&quot;. In September 1940, Atlético Aviación won the first Super cup in Spanish football after beating RCD Español, the 1940 Copa del Generalísimo winners, in a two-legged game that ended in a 10–4 aggregate victory, including a 7–1 trashing in the second leg at Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas. On 14 December 1946, the club decided to drop the military association from its name, and shortly after, on 6 January, it settled on its current name of &quot;Club Atlético de Madrid&quot;. Also in 1947, Atlético beat Real Madrid 5–0 at the &quot;Metropolitano&quot;, their biggest win over their cross-town rivals to date.

===Golden age (1947–1965)===

Under Helenio Herrera and with the help of Larbi Benbarek, Atlético won La Liga again in 1950 and 1951. With the departure of Herrera in 1953, the club began to slip behind Real Madrid and Barcelona and for the remainder of the 1950s were left to battle it out with Athletic Bilbao for the title of third team in Spain.

However, during the 1960s and 1970s, Atlético Madrid seriously challenged Barcelona for the position of second team. The 1957–58 season saw Ferdinand Daučík take charge of Atlético, where he led them to second place in La Liga. This resulted in Atlético qualifying for the 1958–59 European Cup since the winners, Real Madrid, were the reigning European champions. Inspired by Brazilian centre-forward Vavá and Enrique Collar, Atlético reached the semi-finals after beating Drumcondra, CSKA Sofia and Schalke 04. In the semi-finals, they met Real Madrid, who won the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu while Atlético won 1–0 at the &quot;Metropolitano&quot;. The tie went to a replay and Real won 2–1 in Zaragoza.

Atlético, however, gained their revenge when, led by former Real coach José Villalonga, they defeated Real in two successive Copa del Rey finals in 1960 and 1961. In 1962, they won the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, beating Fiorentina 3–0 after a replay. This achievement was significant for the club, as the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup was the only major European trophy that Real Madrid never won. The following year, the club reached the 1963 finals, but lost to English side Tottenham Hotspur 5–1. Enrique Collar, who continued to be an influential player during this era, was now joined by the likes of midfielder Miguel Jones and midfield playmaker Adelardo.

Atlético&#x27;s best years coincided with dominant Real Madrid teams. Between 1961 and 1980, Real Madrid dominated La Liga, winning the competition 14 times. During this era, only Atlético offered Real any serious challenge, winning La Liga titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977 and finishing runners-up in 1961, 1963 and 1965. The club had further success winning the Copa del Rey on three occasions in 1965, 1972 and 1976. In 1965, when they finished as La Liga runners-up to Real after an intense battle for the titles, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years.

===European Cup finalists (1965–1974)===
In 1966, Atlético left the Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid (which was demolished and was replaced with university buildings and an office block belonging to the company ENUSA) and moved to a new home in the Manzanares river waterfront, the Vicente Calderón Stadium, which was inaugurated on 2 October 1966 with a fixture against Valencia.
Significant players from this era included the now-veteran Adelardo and regular goalscorers Luis Aragonés, Javier Irureta and José Eulogio Gárate, the latter winning the &quot;Pichichi&quot; three times in 1969, 1970 and 1971. In the 1970s, Atlético also recruited several Argentine players, signing Rubén Ayala, Panadero Díaz and Ramón &quot;Cacho&quot; Heredia as well as coach Juan Carlos Lorenzo. Lorenzo believed in discipline, caution and disrupting the opponents&#x27; game, and although controversial, his methods proved successful—after winning La Liga in 1973, the club reached the 1974 European Cup Final. On the way to the Final, Atlético knocked out Galatasaray, Dinamo București, Red Star Belgrade and Celtic. In the away leg of the semi-finals against Celtic, Atlético had Ayala, Díaz and substitute Quique all sent off during a hard-fought encounter in what was reported as one of the worst cases of cynical fouling the tournament has seen. Because of this approach, they managed a 0–0 draw, followed by a 2–0 victory in the return leg with goals from Gárate and Adelardo. The finals at Heysel Stadium, however, was a loss for Atlético. Against a Bayern Munich team that included Franz Beckenbauer, Sepp Maier, Paul Breitner, Uli Hoeneß and Gerd Müller, Atlético played above themselves. Despite missing Ayala, Díaz and Quique through suspension, they went ahead in extra-time with only seven minutes left. Aragonés scored with a superb, curling free-kick that looked like the winner, but in the last minute of the game, Bayern defender Georg Schwarzenbeck equalized with a stunning 25-yarder that left Atlético goalkeeper Miguel Reina motionless. In a replay back at Heysel two days later, Bayern won convincingly 4–0, with two goals each from Hoeneß and Müller.

===The Aragonés years (1974–1987)===

Shortly after the defeat in the 1974 European Cup Final, Atlético appointed their veteran player Luis Aragonés as coach. Aragonés subsequently was coach on four separate occasions, from 1974 to 1980, from 1982 to 1987, once again from 1991 until 1993 and finally from 2002 to 2003. His first success came quickly as Bayern Munich had refused to participate in the Intercontinental Cup because of fixture congestion, and as European Cup runners-up, Atlético were invited instead. Their opponents were Independiente of Argentina and, after losing the away leg 1–0, they won the return leg 2–0 with goals from Javier Irureta and Rubén Ayala. Aragonés subsequently led the club to further successes in the Copa del Rey in 1976 and La Liga in 1977.

During his second spell in charge, Aragonés led the club to a runners-up finish in La Liga and a winner&#x27;s medal in the Copa del Rey, both in 1985. He received considerable help from Hugo Sánchez, who scored 19 league goals and won the &quot;Pichichi&quot;. Sánchez also scored twice in the cup finals as Atlético beat Athletic Bilbao 2–1. Sánchez, however, only remained at the club for one season before his move across the city to Real Madrid. Despite the loss of Sánchez, Aragonés went on to lead the club to success in the Supercopa de España in 1985 and then guided them to the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final in 1986. Atlético, however, lost their third successive European finals, this time 3–0 to Dynamo Kyiv.

===The Transition years (1987–2005)===

In 1987, controversial politician and businessman Jesús Gil became club president, running the club (and committing a fraud of misappropriation by seizing 95% of the shares while failing to effectively pay a single Peseta during the Atlético&#x27;s forced conversion from fan-owned club to Sociedad Anónima Deportiva in 1992) until his resignation in May 2003.

Atlético had not won La Liga for ten years and were desperate for league success. Right away, Gil spent heavily, bringing in a number of expensive signings, most notably Portuguese winger Paulo Futre, who had just won the European Cup with Porto. All the spending, however, only brought in two consecutive Copa del Rey trophies in 1991 and 1992 as the league titles proved elusive. The closest Atlético came to the La Liga trophy was the 1990–91 season when they finished runners-up by 10 points to Johan Cruyff&#x27;s Barcelona. In the process, Gil developed a ruthless reputation due to the manner in which he ran the club. In pursuit of league success, he hired and fired a number of high-profile head coaches, including César Luis Menotti, Ron Atkinson, Javier Clemente, Tomislav Ivić, Francisco Maturana and Alfio Basile, as well as club legend Luis Aragonés. Gil also closed down Atlético&#x27;s youth academy in 1992, a move that would prove significant due to 15-year-old academy member Raúl who, as a result, went across town to later achieve worldwide fame with rivals Real Madrid. The move came as part of the overall Gil-initiated business restructuring of the club; Atlético became a Sociedad Anónima Deportiva, a corporate structure benefiting from a then-recently introduced special legal status under Spanish corporate law, allowing individuals to purchase and trade club shares.

In the 1994–95 league campaign, Atlético only avoided relegation via a draw on the last day of the season. This prompted another managerial change along with a wholesale squad clearance during the summer 1995 transfer window. Somewhat unexpectedly, in the following 1995–96 season, newly arrived head coach Radomir Antić, with a squad including holdovers Toni, Roberto Solozábal, Delfí Geli, Juan Vizcaíno, José Luis Caminero, Diego Simeone and Kiko, as well as new acquisitions Milinko Pantić, Lyuboslav Penev, Santi Denia and José Francisco Molina finally delivered the much sought-after league titles as Atlético won the La Liga/Copa del Rey double. The next season, 1996–97, saw the club take part in the UEFA Champions League for the first time. With expectations and ambitions raised, the most notable summer transfer signings were striker Juan Esnáider from Real Madrid and Radek Bejbl, who was coming off a great showing for Czech Republic at Euro 1996. Playing on two fronts, Atlético fell out of the league title contention early while, in the Champions League, they were eliminated by Ajax in extra-time in the quarter-finals. Before the 1997–98 season, the heavy spending continued with the signings of Christian Vieri and Juninho. All of the success, however, produced little change in the overall Gil strategy, and although Antić survived three consecutive seasons in charge, he was replaced during the summer of 1998 with Arrigo Sacchi, who himself only remained in the managerial hot seat for less than six months. Antić then returned briefly in early 1999 only to be replaced with Claudio Ranieri at the end of the season. 

The 1999–2000 season proved disastrous for Atlético. In December 1999, Gil and his board were suspended pending an investigation into the misuse of club funds, with government-appointed administrator José Manuel Rubí running Atlético&#x27;s day-to-day operations. With the removal of club President Jesús Gil and his board, the players performed poorly and the club floundered. Ranieri handed in his resignation with the club sitting 17th out of 20 in the league table and heading towards relegation. Antić, returning for his third coaching stint, was unable to prevent the inevitable. Despite reaching the Copa del Rey final in 2000, Atlético were relegated second time after 66 years. The club spent two seasons in the Segunda División, narrowly missing out on promotion in 2000–01 season before winning the Segunda División championship in 2002. It was again Aragonés, in his fourth and last spell as manager of Atlético, who brought them back to the Primera División.

Aragonés also coached the team during the next season, and gave Fernando Torres his La Liga debut. Torres came through the academy of the club and was a hot prospect in Spain; in his first season in the league, 2002–03, he scored 13 goals in 29 appearances. In July 2003, soon after his takeover of the club, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich offered £28 million for Torres, which was rejected by Atlético. In the 2003–04 season, Torres continued his success as he scored 19 league goals in 35 appearances, making him the joint third-highest scorer in the league.&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics: top scorers: 2003/2004&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Torres had been at Atlético since the age of 11 and his precocious talent led to him becoming the club&#x27;s youngest ever captain at the age of just 19.

=== Torres sale and eventual European success (2006–2011) ===

In 2006, Atlético signed Portuguese midfielders Costinha and Maniche, as well as Argentine forward Sergio Agüero. In July 2007, Torres left the club for Liverpool for €38 million, while Luis García signed for the club at the same time in an unrelated transfer. The club also bought Uruguay international and former European Golden Boot and &quot;Pichichi&quot; winners Diego Forlán for roughly €21 million from Villarreal. Other additions included Portuguese winger Simão Sabrosa from Benfica for €20 million and winger José Antonio Reyes from Arsenal for €12 million.

In July 2007, the Atlético board reached an agreement with the City of Madrid to sell the land where their stadium was located and move the club to the City-owned Olympic Stadium. The stadium changed hands in 2016 and was bought by the club for €30.4 million. Madrid had applied to host the 2016 Olympic Games, losing out to Rio de Janeiro. The 2007–08 season proved to be the most successful season for the club in the past decade. The team reached the round of 32 in the UEFA Cup, where they were defeated by Bolton Wanderers. They also reached the quarter-finals round of the Copa del Rey, where they were beaten by eventual champions Valencia. More significantly, the team finished the league season in fourth place, qualifying for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since the 1996–97 season.

On 3 February 2009, Javier Aguirre was dismissed from his post as manager after a poor start to the season, going without a win in six games. He later claimed that this was not accurate, and that he had left by mutual termination rather than through sacking. There was public outrage after his dismissal, many believing he was not the cause of Atlético&#x27;s problems, namely player Diego Forlán. He backed his former manager and said that, &quot;Dismissing Javier was the easy way out, but he was not the cause of our problems. The players are to blame because we have not been playing well and we have been committing a lot of errors.&quot; This led to the appointment of Abel Resino as Atlético&#x27;s new manager. Atlético&#x27;s success continued in the latter half of the season when they placed fourth once again in the league table, securing a position in the playoff round of the UEFA Champions League. Striker Diego Forlán was crowned with the &quot;Pichichi&quot; and also won the European Golden Shoe after scoring 32 goals for Atlético that season. Atlético saw this domestic success as an opportunity to reinforce their squad for the upcoming Champions League season. They replaced veteran goalkeeper Leo Franco with David de Gea from the youth ranks and signed promising youngster Sergio Asenjo from Real Valladolid. Atlético also acquired Real Betis defender and Spanish international Juanito on a free transfer. Despite pressure from big clubs to sell star players Agüero and Forlán, Atlético remained committed to keeping their strong attacking base in the hopes for a successful new season.

The 2009–10 season, however, began poorly with many defeats and goals conceded. On 21 October, Atletico were hammered 4–0 by English club Chelsea in the Champions League group stage. This defeat led Atletico&#x27;s management to announce that manager Abel Resino had to leave. After failing to sign Danish former footballer Michael Laudrup, Atlético Madrid announced that the new manager for the rest of the season would be Quique Sánchez Flores. With the arrival of Sánchez Flores as coach in October 2009, Atlético improved in many of their competition. Atlético continued to lag somewhat in La Liga during the 2009–10 season, finishing in ninth position, but managed to finish third in their 2009–10 UEFA Champions League group stage and subsequently entered the Europa League in the round of 32. Atlético went on to win the Europa League, beating English teams Liverpool in the semi-finals and eventually Fulham in the finals held at HSH Nordbank Arena in Hamburg on 12 May 2010. Diego Forlán scored twice, the second being an extra-time winner in the 116th minute, as Atlético won 2–1. It was the first time since the 1961–62 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup that Atlético had claimed a European titles. They also reached the Copa del Rey finals on 19 May 2010, where they faced Sevilla, but lost 2–0 at the Camp Nou in Barcelona. By winning the Europa League, they qualified for the 2010 UEFA Super Cup against Inter Milan, winner of the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League. The match was played at the Stade Louis II, Monaco on 27 August 2010. Atlético won 2–0 with goals from José Antonio Reyes and Agüero, making it the club&#x27;s first win in the UEFA Super Cup.

Atlético had a comparatively disappointing 2010–11 season, finishing only seventh in the League and being eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey and the group stage of the Europa League. This ultimately led to the departure of manager Sánchez Flores before the conclusion of the season, who was replaced with ex-Sevilla manager Gregorio Manzano.

=== Simeone revolution and revival of Atlético success (2011–present) ===

On 23 December 2011, Atlético appointed their former Argentine player, Diego Simeone, as manager in place of Manzano. The club were in a period of uncertainty, having appointed five managers in less than three years and allowing young talents, namely Agüero and de Gea, to leave for the Premier League. The team was sitting 10th in La Liga at the time of Simeone&#x27;s appointment, after losing four of their last five games. The appointment of Simeone was seen as a risk, who was relatively inexperienced and previously only had European managerial experience with Italian underdogs Catania. However, he swiftly transformed Atlético into a formidable force. As a player, Simeone was known as a fierce, all-action midfielder; he brought the same relentless, win-at-all-costs mentality to Atlético as manager. His focus was on building a strong defence, anchored by teenage Chelsea loanee goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and Uruguayan centre-back Diego Godín. The results were immediate, as Simeone&#x27;s first six games in charge featured six clean sheets. According to Spanish football writer Andy West, Atlético fans came to quickly to embrace Simeone, especially in light of his role as a pivotal player in their 1995-96 league and cup double.

Simeone led Atlético to their second Europa League win in the three years since its creation; Atlético beat Athletic Bilbao 3–0 in the final on 9 May 2012 at National Arena in Bucharest with two goals from Radamel Falcao and one from Diego. By winning the Europa League again, Atlético qualified for the 2012 UEFA Super Cup against Chelsea, winners of the previous season&#x27;s Champions League. The game was played at the Stade Louis II, Monaco on 31 August 2012; Atlético won 4–1, including a hat-trick by Falcao in the first half. On 17 May 2013, Atlético beat Real Madrid 2–1 in the Copa del Rey final in a tense match where both teams finished with ten men. This ended a 14-year and 25-match winless streak in the Madrid derby. The 2012–13 season saw the club finish with three trophies in a little over a year. On 17 May 2014, a 1–1 draw at the Camp Nou against Barcelona secured the La Liga title for Atlético, their first since 1996, and the first titles since 2003–04 not won by Barcelona or Real Madrid. One week later, Atlético faced city rivals Real Madrid in their first Champions League final since 1974, and the first played between two sides from the same city. They took a first-half lead through Godín and led until the third minute of injury time, when Sergio Ramos headed in an equaliser from a corner; the match went to extra time, and Real ultimately won 4–1. 

Antoine Griezmann, who had a standout season in La Liga and featured at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, joined Atlético from Real Sociedad on 28 July 2014. During his first stint with the club, Griezmann was Atlético&#x27;s top scorer for five consecutive seasons. He established himself as a world-class player at Atlético, also shining on the international stage as he finished as the top scorer at UEFA Euro 2016 and earned the tournament&#x27;s best player award. That same year, he placed third in the Ballon d&#x27;Or rankings, behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Atlético reached a second Champions League final in three seasons in 2015–16, again facing Real Madrid, and lost on penalties after a 1–1 draw. The club played their last home game at the Vicente Calderón Stadium on 21 May 2017, thereby moving to a new home, the refurbished Wanda Metropolitano in eastern Madrid. In 2018, they won their third Europa League title in nine years by beating Marseille 3–0 in the finals at the Stade de Lyon in Lyon, courtesy of a brace from Griezmann and a goal from club captain Gabi in what would be his last match for the club. Atlético also won another UEFA Super Cup after beating Real Madrid 4–2 at the outset of the following season at the Lilleküla Arena in Tallinn. On 25 September 2020, Atlético signed Luis Suárez from Barcelona. One of the world&#x27;s best strikers, Suárez made a dramatic impact at the club, as he played a pivotal role in their unexpected La Liga title triumph, seven years after the 2013–14 win. He scored 17 goals in his first 19 La Liga matches, helping Atlético establish a 10-point lead by January. Although the team wavered later in the season, Suárez&#x27;s relentless competitive drive proved decisive, as he netted crucial goals in the final two games to secure the title. The final game of the title-winning season was on 22 May 2021, a 2–1 win at the José Zorrilla Stadium against Valladolid. On April 16, 2024, the team qualified to the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup for first time in club&#x27;s history, despite being eliminated in the 2023–24 Champions League, as Barcelona were also eliminated, and Atlético were the higher ranked Spanish club in the UEFA four-year ranking.

==Rivalries==
===Real Madrid===
Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid are clubs with contrasting identities and different fates. While Real Madrid&#x27;s Santiago Bernabéu proudly rises on the Paseo de la Castellana in the wealthy Chamartín neighbourhood of northern Madrid, Atlético&#x27;s former stadium, the less glamorous Vicente Calderón, stood in the central-south of Madrid 1.8 km from the city center in the working class barrio of Arganzuela. Historically, Real Madrid have long been seen as the establishment club. On the other side, Atlético Madrid were always characterized by a &quot;sentimiento de rebeldía&quot;, a sense of rebellion. They were associated with the military airforce (renamed Atlético Aviación), until the regime&#x27;s preferences moved towards Real Madrid in the 1950s.

Certainly, the dictatorial state sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid&#x27;s European Cup trophies at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; &quot;Real Madrid are the best embassy we ever had&quot;, said Franco&#x27;s foreign minister Fernando Maria de Castiella. Such perceptions have had an important impact on the city&#x27;s footballing identities, tapping into the collective consciousness. In this vein, Atlético fans were probably the originators, and are the most frequent singers, of the song, sung to the tune of the Real Madrid anthem, &quot;Hala Madrid, hala Madrid, el equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país&quot;, &quot;Go Madrid, go Madrid, the government&#x27;s team, the country&#x27;s shame.&quot;

Until recently, Atlético Madrid had struggled significantly in the derby, carrying a 14-year winless streak into the 2012–13 season. This spell ended, however, on 17 May 2013 after Atlético beat their city rivals 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu in the 2013 Copa del Rey finals, and continued on 29 September 2013 when they won a 1–0 victory, again at the Bernabéu.

The two faced each other in the 2014 and 2016 UEFA Champions League finals, with Real Madrid winning both matches.

===Barcelona===
Although less famous than the Derbi Madrileño, a historic rivalry exists between Atlético Madrid and Barcelona, which is also considered one of the &quot;Classics&quot; of Spanish football. Once lopsided in favor of the Catalan club, this rivalry has become competitive since the early 2010s, marked by events such as the 2016 Champions League knockout phase where Atletico Madrid upset Barcelona, the controversial departure of French striker Antoine Griezmann from the Madrid club to the Catalan club in 2019 (and his subsequent return in 2021 amid Barcelona&#x27;s financial struggles), and the surprise move of Luis Suárez to Atlético in 2020, a move which saw the Uruguyan star play a crucial role in the team&#x27;s championship run. However, by tradition and current affairs, the greatest rivalry is that which exists with its &quot;merengues&quot; neighbors.

Starting with the 1999–00 relegation Atlético did not qualify for European competition for seven years, but from the 2007–08 season, it has taken part in either the Champions League or the UEFA Europa League every year, enjoying success in both competition.

==Ownership and overseas properties==

Since 2002, Enrique Cerezo Torres was the club president, whereas Miguel Ángel Gil Marín (son of former club president Jesús Gil) is chief executive officer. After a 2021 capital increase, Gil Marín, Cerezo and incoming investor Ares Management Corporation hold a 66.98% of the shares by means of &#x27;Atlético HoldCo&#x27;. Israeli businessman and billionaire Idan Ofer, owns 33% of Atlético Madrid&#x27;s stakes.

Atlético co-owns Liga MX club Atlético San Luis, and the Canadian Premier League side Atlético Ottawa. The club also co-owned the Indian Super League (ISL) franchise in Kolkata, formerly named Atlético de Kolkata, which won the competition twice, but in 2017 ended its partnership with the club as Sanjiv Goenka bought its shares.

In October 2018, Atletico De Madrid announced their first academy in Pakistan which was based in Lahore, which was the first European football academy in Pakistan. In April 2019, they launched &quot;Football School Program&quot; in Lahore. In October 2019, Atletico De Madrid conducted talents in Lahore. In February 2020, Pakistan Football Federation announced the 2020–21 Football Federation League in which Atletico Madrid Lahore was included in Group C and was made a professional Pakistani football club. It made its debut against Hazara Coal and won by 2–0.

==Colours and badge==
Atlético&#x27;s home kit is red and white vertical striped shirts, blue shorts, and blue and red socks. This combination has been used since 1910.

The club&#x27;s badge which was firstly introduced in 1917 featuring the Coat of arms of Madrid, then incorporated into the club&#x27;s jersey from 1947, was remodeled in 2016 through a controversial and unnecessary decision by the ownership, yet a vote on 30 June 2023 revealed that 88.68% of club members wanted to reinstate the historical badge, which would be represented on July 1, 2024.

==Nicknames==
Throughout their history the club has been known by a number of nicknames, including &quot;Los Colchoneros&quot; (&quot;The Mattress Makers&quot;), due to their first team stripes being the same colours as traditional mattresses. During the 1970s, they became known as &quot;Los Indios&quot;, which some attribute to the club&#x27;s signing several South American players after the restrictions on signing foreign players were lifted. However, there are a number of alternative theories which claim they were named so because their stadium was &quot;camped&quot; on the river bank, or because &quot;Los Indios&quot; (The Indians) were the traditional enemy of &quot;Los Blancos&quot; (The Whites), which is the nickname of the club&#x27;s city rivals, Real Madrid. Felipe VI, the king of Spain, has been the honorary president of the club since 2003.

==Stadium and facility==

The club plays home fixtures in the Riyadh Air Metropolitano, which was expanded from a 20,000 seat capacity (when it was known as La Peineta) to 68,000 after it was used for Madrid&#x27;s failed bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympic.
Following the renovation of the stadium, the refurbished venue hosted its first competitive match pitting Atlético against Málaga, in which Antoine Griezmann scored the club&#x27;s first goal at the stadium.

===Training ground===
The club&#x27;s training ground is the Ciudad Deportiva Atlético de Madrid in Majadahonda, around 20 km west of Madrid. The facility maintains grass and artificial pitches as well as a gym. Both the senior and youth squads train at the club-owned facilities.

Atlético also runs a sports academy at the Ciudad Deportiva del Nuevo Cerro del Espino in Majadahonda. The club also runs an academy in Bucharest, Romania, its first in Europe.

==Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors==

Atlético began playing in blue and white, mirroring then-parent club Athletic Bilbao, but both changed to red-and-white stripes by 1911 which became their traditional colours. The change took hold because red and white striped tops were the cheap to make, as the same combination was used to make bed mattresses, and the unused cloth was easily converted into football shirts. The kit has been made by Nike since 2001, as the company wants to provide competition with rival brand Adidas, who have a long-term deal with Real Madrid.

The club&#x27;s main shirt sponsorship by the government of Azerbaijan between 2012 and 2014, featuring the slogan &#x27;Land of Fire&#x27;, was condemned by Reporters Without Borders, who satirized it in a campaign visual in which the shirt&#x27;s vertical stripes become prison bars with the logo &quot;Azerbaijan, Land of Repression&quot;. Atlético Madrid admitted its sponsorship deal had a political dimension, saying the intention was to &quot;promote the image of Azerbaijan&quot;. In August 2014, the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights wrote to Atlético, calling on it to end the sponsorship by and promotion of Azerbaijan because of the country&#x27;s human rights record, calling it &quot;one of the most repressive countries in the world&quot;.

In its 2003–04 season, the club was sponsored by Columbia Pictures, who would change the shirt sponsor&#x27;s logo, and occasionally the shirt itself, as they did with the away shirt when &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; was in cinemas. This kit sponsorship deal featured 16 separate film titles – an unprecedented number, which has not since been replicated as of 2022. Films included Columbia Picture&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;White Chicks&quot;, which received mixed commentary. Because shirts would have to be introduced and removed from shops at a very fast pace to keep up with film releases, Nike decided to not include a sponsor&#x27;s logo on replica shirts made from 2002 to 2005.
* (**) – 2003–05 Columbia Pictures (Movies advertised on the shirt included &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot;, &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;, &quot;Big Fish&quot;, &quot;Hellboy&quot;, &quot;Spanglish&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil 2: Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;Hitch&quot;, &quot;xXx&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;).

==Supporters==
Frente Atlético is an ultra group of Club Atlético de Madrid founded with that name in 1982. They had around 2,500 members in 2014, one of the largest ultra groups in Spanish football. That same year, Atlético Madrid expelled Frente Atlético and prohibited the display of its symbols in the stadium.

FA are friends with Ruch Chorzow, Roma, Fortuna Düsseldorf, Catanzaro and Sporting Gijón.

Also they have a great rivalry with the ultras of Real Madrid, Sevilla, Espanyol, Valencia, Rayo Vallecano, Deportivo, Celta, Real Sociedad, Athletic, Osasuna, Alavés, Zaragoza, Malaga, Valladolid, Oviedo, Porto, Sporting Lisbon, Benfica, Lazio and Marseille. They also have bad relations and constant incidents with a former section of the group called Suburbios Firm.

Celebrities Joaquín Sabina, Belén Esteban, Birgitte V. Gade, Leiva, Álvaro Bautista, Omar Hittini, Ana Rosa Quintana, Javier Bardem, Sara Carbonero, Pablo Iglesias Turrión, El Langui, Pedro Sánchez, Luis de Guindos, Rosendo Mercado, José Tomás, Cayetano Martínez de Irujo, David Muñoz, Will Smith, Harrison Ford, Halle Berry, Tom Cruise, Matt Damon, Vin Diesel, Charlize Theron and Karl-Anthony Towns are all fans of the club. Atlético is also supported by King Felipe VI, who became Honorary President of the club in 2003.

Atlético Madrid became one of the most popular sports clubs in the world with a large international fanbase. As of 06 Oct 2024, Atlético ranked 16th place in the top 20 most popular sports clubs on Instagram in the world:

==Notable players==

Koke has worn the Atlético shirt in more than 650 matches since 2009, while Antoine Griezmann has the club&#x27;s record for most goals with 197. João Félix is the club&#x27;s most expensive signing at €126 million, and at €120 million Antoine Griezmann is the club&#x27;s biggest sale.

<text>In Greek mythology, Eupeithes (Εὐπείθης &quot;Eupeíthēs&quot;) was the father of Antinous, the leader of the suitors of Penelope. After his son&#x27;s death at the hands of Odysseus, Eupeithes tried to revolt against his rule. He was killed by Odysseus&#x27;s father, Laertes. Evidently, he had forgotten the favor Odysseus had done for him years before when he committed a piratical raid on Cephallenia. Odysseus protected him from vengeful Cephallenians who wanted to kill him. Yet he let his son lead the suitors in destroying Odysseus&#x27;s home.

His name means &quot;obedient&quot;.

<doc id="84199" wikidata="Q76326" url="?curid=84199" title="Dietrich Bonhoeffer">
<text>Dietrich Bonhoeffer (; 4 February 1906 – 9 April 1945) was a German Lutheran pastor, neo-orthodox theologian and anti-Nazi dissident who was a key founding member of the Confessing Church. His writings on Christianity&#x27;s role in the secular world have become widely influential; his 1937 book &quot;The Cost of Discipleship&quot; is described as a modern classic. Apart from his theological writings, Bonhoeffer was known for his staunch resistance to the Nazi dictatorship, including vocal opposition to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s euthanasia program and genocidal persecution of Jews. He was arrested in April 1943 by the Gestapo and imprisoned at Tegel Prison for 1½ years. Later, he was transferred to Flossenbürg concentration camp.

Bonhoeffer was accused of being associated with the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler and was tried along with other accused plotters, including former members of the Abwehr (the German Military Intelligence Office). He was hanged on 9 April 1945 during the collapse of the Nazi regime.
== Childhood and family ==
Bonhoeffer was born on 4 February 1906 in Breslau, Germany (now Poland), into a large family. Dietrich had a twin sister, Sabine Bonhoeffer Leibholz: he and Sabine were the sixth and seventh children out of eight. His father was Karl Bonhoeffer, a psychiatrist and neurologist, noted for his criticism of Sigmund Freud; his mother Paula Bonhoeffer was a teacher and the granddaughter of Protestant theologian Karl von Hase and painter Stanislaus von Kalckreuth. Bonhoeffer&#x27;s family dynamic and his parents&#x27; values enabled him to receive a high level of education and encouraged his curiosity, which impacted his ability to lead others around him, specifically in the church setting. He learned how to play the piano at age 8 and composed the songs performed at the Philharmonic at age 11. Walter Bonhoeffer, the second born of the Bonhoeffer family, was killed in action during World War I when Bonhoeffer was 12 years old.

At age 14, Bonhoeffer decided to pursue his education in theology despite the criticism of his older brothers Klaus (a lawyer) and Karl (a scientist). He took Hebrew as an elective in school and attended many evangelical meetings, moved by the many sufferings that resulted from war such as food insecurity and orphaned children. Bonhoeffer began his studies at Tübingen and eventually moved to the University of Berlin, where he submitted his successful dissertation: &quot;Sanctorum Communio.&quot; At age 21, on 17 December 1927, he went on to complete his Doctor of Theology degree from Humboldt University of Berlin, graduating &quot;summa cum laude&quot;.

== Early life ==

=== Studies in America ===
In 1930, Bonhoeffer moved to America with the intent of attaining a Sloane Fellowship at New York City&#x27;s Union Theological Seminary. Bonhoeffer was greatly unimpressed with American theology. He described the students as lacking interest in theology and would &quot;laugh out loud&quot; when learning a passage from Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;Sin and Forgiveness.&quot; During his time there, he met Frank Fisher, a black seminarian who introduced him to the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, where Bonhoeffer taught Sunday school and formed a lifelong love for the African-American church. He heard Adam Clayton Powell Sr. preach the &quot;Gospel of Social Justice&quot; and became sensitive to the social injustices experienced by racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. as well as the ineptitude of churches to bring about integration. Through oppressed Negro churches, he was captivated by the sermons, and he formed the belief that God&#x27;s commandments were carried out. The originally nationalist Bonhoeffer later changed his views after seeing &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, which shows the horrors of war. Later in life he favored the views of pacifism because of love for all and a high value on each individual life. Bonhoeffer became involved with the ecumenical Christian movement, which eventually led him to resist Adolf Hitler and the Nazis.

=== Return to Germany ===
After returning to Germany in 1931, Bonhoeffer became a lecturer in systematic theology at the University of Berlin. Deeply interested in ecumenism, he was appointed by the World Alliance for Promoting International Friendship through the Churches (a forerunner of the World Council of Churches) as one of its three European youth secretaries. At this time he seems to have undergone a personal conversion, as he changed from being a theologian primarily attracted to the intellectual side of Christianity, to being a dedicated man of personal faith, resolved to literally carry out the teachings of Christ, revealed in the Gospels. On 15 November 1931, at age 25, he was ordained at Old-Prussian United in Berlin-Tiergarten.

== Anti-Nazism ==
Bonhoeffer&#x27;s promising academic and ecclesiastical career was dramatically knocked off course by the Nazi ascent to power on 30 January 1933. He was a determined opponent of the regime from its first days. Two days after Hitler was installed as chancellor, Bonhoeffer delivered a radio address in which he attacked Hitler and warned Germany against slipping into an idolatrous cult of the &quot;führer&quot; (leader), who could very well turn out to be &quot;verführer&quot; (misleader, seducer). His broadcast was abruptly cut off, though it is unclear whether the newly elected Nazi regime was responsible. In April 1933, Bonhoeffer raised the first voice for church resistance to Hitler&#x27;s persecution of Jews, declaring that the church must not simply &quot;bandage the victims under the wheel, but jam a spoke in the wheel itself.&quot;

In November 1932, two months before the Nazi takeover, there had been an election for presbyters and synodals (church officials) of the German &quot;Landeskirche&quot; (Protestant mainstream churches). This election was marked by a struggle within the Old-Prussian Union Protestant Church between the pro-Nazi &quot;Deutsche Christen&quot; (German Christian) movement and Young Reformers, who were interested in following the Gospel teachings of Jesus—a struggle that threatened to explode into schism. In July 1933, Hitler unconstitutionally imposed new church elections. Bonhoeffer put all his efforts into the election, campaigning for the selection of independent, non-Nazi officials who were dedicated to following Christ.

Despite Bonhoeffer&#x27;s efforts, in the July election an overwhelming number of key church positions went to the &quot;Deutsche Christen&quot;. The Deutsche Christen won a majority in the Old-Prussian general synod and all its provincial synods except Westphalia, and in synods of all other Protestant church bodies, except for the Lutheran churches of Bavaria, Hanover, and Württemberg. The anti-Nazi Christian opposition regarded these bodies as uncorrupted &quot;intact churches&quot;, as opposed to the other so-called &quot;destroyed churches&quot;.

In opposition to Nazification, Bonhoeffer urged an interdict to stop offering all pastoral ceremonial services (baptisms, confirmations, weddings, funerals, etc.), but Karl Barth and others advised against such a radical proposal. In August 1933, Bonhoeffer and Hermann Sasse were deputized by opposition church leaders to draft the &quot;Bethel Confession,&quot; as a statement of faith in opposition to the Deutsche Christen movement. Notable for affirming God&#x27;s fidelity to Jews as His chosen people, the &quot;Bethel Confession&quot; was eventually so watered down to make it more palatable that ultimately Bonhoeffer refused to sign it.

In September 1933, the nationalist church synod at Wittenberg voluntarily passed a resolution to apply the Aryan paragraph within the church, meaning that pastors and church officials of Jewish descent were to be removed from their posts. Regarding this as an affront to the principle of baptism, Martin Niemöller founded the &quot;Pfarrernotbund&quot; (Pastors&#x27; Emergency League). In November, a rally of 20,000 Deutsche Christens demanded the removal of the Jewish Old Testament from the Bible, which was seen by many as heresy, further swelling the ranks of the Pastors Emergency League.

Within weeks of its founding, more than a third of German pastors had joined the Emergency League. It was the forerunner of the &quot;Bekennende Kirche&quot; (Confessing Church), which aimed to preserve historical, Biblically based Christian beliefs and practices. The Barmen Declaration, drafted by Barth in May 1934 and adopted by the Confessing Church, insisted that Christ, not the &quot;führer&quot;, is the head of the Church. The adoption of the declaration has often been viewed as a triumph, although only about 20% of German pastors supported the Confessing Church.

=== Ministries in London ===
When Bonhoeffer was offered a parish post in eastern Berlin in the autumn of 1933, he refused it in protest at the Nationalist policy, and he accepted a two-year appointment as a pastor of two German-speaking Protestant churches in London: the German Lutheran Church in Dacres Road, Sydenham, and the German Reformed Church of St Paul&#x27;s, Goulston Street, Whitechapel. He explained to Barth that he had found little support for his views on devotion to literally following the words of Jesus—even among friends—and that &quot;it was about time to go for a while into the desert.&quot; Barth regarded this as running away from a real battle. He sharply rebuked Bonhoeffer, saying, &quot;I can only reply to all the reasons and excuses which you put forward: &#x27;And what will now happen to the people of the German Church?&#x27;&quot; Barth accused Bonhoeffer of abandoning his post and wasting his &quot;splendid theological armory&quot; while &quot;the house of your church is on fire&quot;, and chided him to return to Berlin &quot;by the next ship&quot;.

Bonhoeffer, however, did not go to England simply to avoid trouble at home; he hoped to put the ecumenical movement to work in the interest of the Confessing Church. He continued his involvement with the Confessing Church, running up a high telephone bill to maintain his contact with Martin Niemöller. In international gatherings, Bonhoeffer rallied people to oppose the Deutsche Christen movement and its attempt to amalgamate Nazi nationalism with Christianity. When Bishop —the official in charge of German Lutheran Church foreign affairs—traveled to London to warn Bonhoeffer to abstain from any ecumenical activity not directly authorized by Berlin, Bonhoeffer refused to abstain.

=== Underground seminaries ===
In 1935, Bonhoeffer was offered a coveted opportunity to study non-violent resistance under Mahatma Gandhi in his ashram. However, remembering Barth&#x27;s rebuke, Bonhoeffer decided to return to Germany instead, where he was the head at an underground seminary in Finkenwalde for training Confessing Church pastors. As the Nazi suppression of the Confessing Church intensified, Barth was driven back to Switzerland in 1935; Niemöller was arrested in July 1937; and in August 1936, Bonhoeffer&#x27;s authorization to teach at the University of Berlin was revoked after he was denounced as a &quot;pacifist and enemy of the state&quot; by Theodor Heckel. Bonhoeffer&#x27;s efforts for the underground seminaries included securing necessary funds. He found a great benefactor in Ruth von Kleist-Retzow. In times of trouble, Bonhoeffer&#x27;s former students and their wives would take refuge in von Kleist-Retzow&#x27;s Pomeranian estate, and Bonhoeffer was a frequent guest. Later he fell in love with Kleist-Retzow&#x27;s granddaughter, Maria von Wedemeyer, to whom he became engaged three months before his arrest in 1943. By August 1937, SS leader Heinrich Himmler had decreed the education and examination of Confessing Church ministry candidates illegal. In September 1937, the Gestapo closed the seminary at Finkenwalde, and by November 27 pastors and former students were arrested. It was around this time that Bonhoeffer published his best-known book, &quot;The Cost of Discipleship,&quot; a study on the Sermon on the Mount in which he attacked &quot;cheap grace&quot; as a cover for ethical laxity against the virtues of &quot;costly grace&quot;.

Bonhoeffer spent the next two years secretly traveling from one eastern German village to another to conduct a &quot;seminary on the run&quot; supervising the continuing education and work of his students, most of whom were working illegally in small parishes within the old-Prussian Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania. The von Blumenthal family hosted the underground seminary on its estate of Groß Schlönwitz. The pastors of Groß Schlönwitz and neighbouring villages supported the education of young men who voluntarily housed these seminarians (among whom was Eberhard Bethge, who later became his best friend and edited Bonhoeffer&#x27;s &quot;Letters and Papers from Prison&quot;) and employing them as vicars in their congregations.

In 1938, the Gestapo banned Bonhoeffer from Berlin. In the summer of 1939, the seminary was able to move to Sigurdshof, an outlying estate (Vorwerk) of the von Kleist family in Wendisch Tychow. In March 1940, the Gestapo shut down the underground seminary there following the outbreak of World War II. Bonhoeffer&#x27;s semi-monastic communal life and teaching at the underground Finkenwalde seminary formed the basis of his books, &quot;The Cost of Discipleship&quot; and &quot;Life Together&quot;.

Bonhoeffer&#x27;s sister, Sabine, along with her Jewish-classified husband Gerhard Leibholz and their two daughters, escaped to England by way of Switzerland in 1938.

=== Return to the United States ===
In February 1938, Bonhoeffer made an initial contact with members of the German resistance when his brother-in-law Hans von Dohnányi introduced him to a group seeking Hitler&#x27;s overthrow at the Abwehr, the German military intelligence service.

Bonhoeffer also learned from Dohnányi that war was imminent. He was particularly troubled by the prospect of being conscripted. As a committed Christian pacifist opposed to the Nazi regime, he could never swear an oath to Hitler and would never commit any violence or fight in Hitler&#x27;s army, though refusal to do so was potentially a capital offense. He worried also about consequences his refusing military service could have for the Confessing Church, as it was a move that would be frowned upon by most nationalist Christians and their churches at the time.

It was at this juncture that Bonhoeffer left for the United States in June 1939 at the invitation of Union Theological Seminary in New York. After much inner turmoil, he soon regretted his decision and returned after only two weeks despite strong pressures from his friends to stay in the United States. He wrote to Reinhold Niebuhr:
=== Abwehr agent ===

Back in Germany, Bonhoeffer was further harassed by the Nazi authorities as he was forbidden to speak in public and was required regularly to report his activities to the police. In 1941, he was forbidden to print or to publish anything. In the meantime, Bonhoeffer had joined the Abwehr. Dohnányi, already part of the Abwehr, brought him into the organization on the claim that his wide ecumenical contacts would be of use to Germany, thus protecting him from conscription to active service. Bonhoeffer presumably knew about various 1943 plots against Hitler through Dohnányi, who was actively involved in the planning. In the face of Nazi atrocities against the Jews and other minorities, the full scale of which Bonhoeffer learned through the Abwehr, he concluded that &quot;the ultimate question for a responsible man to ask is not how he is to extricate himself from this whole affair, but how the coming generation shall continue to survive and live for Truth.&quot; He did not justify his action but wrote, &quot;When a man takes guilt upon himself in responsibility, he imputes his guilt to himself and no one else. He answers for it... Before other men he is justified by dire necessity; before himself he is acquitted by his conscience, but before God he hopes only for grace.&quot; (In a 1932 sermon, Bonhoeffer said, &quot;The blood of martyrs might once again be demanded, but this blood, if we really have the courage and loyalty to shed it, will not be innocent, shining like that of the first witnesses for the faith. On our blood lies heavy with guilt, the guilt of the unprofitable servant who is cast into outer darkness.&quot;)

Under cover of the Abwehr, Bonhoeffer served as a courier for the German resistance movement to reveal its existence and intentions to the Western Allies in hope of garnering their support. Through his ecumenical contacts abroad, he hoped to secure possible peace terms with the Allies for a post-Hitler government. In May 1942, he met Anglican Bishop George Bell of Chichester, a member of the House of Lords and an ally of the Confessing Church, contacted by Bonhoeffer&#x27;s exiled brother-in-law Leibholz; through him feelers were sent to British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden. However, the British government ignored these, as it had all other approaches from the German resistance, considering all Germans to be the enemy. In addition, British war policy was to conduct area bombing of civilian cities, which Bell opposed, a view that had become unpopular in Britain. Dohnányi and Bonhoeffer were also involved in Abwehr operations to help German Jews escape to Switzerland. During this time, Bonhoeffer worked on his book &quot;Ethics&quot; and wrote letters to keep up the spirits of his former students. He intended &quot;Ethics&quot; as his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, but it remained unfinished when he was arrested. On 5 April 1943 Bonhoeffer and Dohnányi were arrested and imprisoned.

=== Imprisonment ===
On 13 January 1943 Bonhoeffer had become engaged to Maria von Wedemeyer, the granddaughter of his close friend and Finkenwalde seminary supporter, Ruth von Kleist Retzow. Ruth had campaigned for this marriage for several years, although up until late October 1942, Bonhoeffer remained a reluctant suitor despite Ruth being part of his innermost circle. He considered that his responsibilities during wartime made it the wrong time to marry. A large age gap loomed between Bonhoeffer and Maria: he was 36 to her 18. Bonhoeffer had first met her when she was his confirmation student at age 11. As was considered proper at the time, the two had spent almost no time together alone prior to the engagement and did not see each other between becoming engaged and Bonhoeffer&#x27;s 5 April arrest. Once he was in prison, however, Maria&#x27;s status as his fiancée became invaluable, as it meant she could visit Bonhoeffer and correspond with him. While their relationship was troubled, she was a source of food and smuggled messages. Bonhoeffer made Eberhard Bethge his heir, but Maria, in allowing her correspondence with Bonhoeffer to be published after her death, provided an invaluable addition to this scholarship.

For a year and a half, Bonhoeffer was imprisoned at Tegel Prison awaiting trial. There he continued his work in religious outreach among his fellow prisoners and guards. Sympathetic guards helped smuggle his letters out of prison to Bethge and others, and these uncensored letters were posthumously published in &quot;Letters and Papers from Prison&quot;. One of those guards, a corporal named Knobloch, even offered to help him escape from the prison and &quot;disappear&quot; with him, and plans were made for that end; eventually Bonhoeffer declined it, fearing Nazi retribution against his family, especially his brother Klaus and brother-in-law Dohnányi, who was also imprisoned.

On 4 April 1945, the diaries of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of the Abwehr, were discovered, and in a rage upon reading them, Hitler ordered that the other Abwehr members be executed. Bonhoeffer was led away just as he concluded his final Sunday service and asked an English prisoner, Payne Best, to remember him to Bell if Best should ever reach his home: &quot;This is the end—but for me it is the beginning of Life!&quot;

== Execution ==

Bonhoeffer was sentenced to death on 8 April 1945 by SS judge Otto Thorbeck at a drumhead court-martial without witnesses, without any evidence against him, with no records of the proceedings or a defense. He was executed in Flossenbürg concentration camp by hanging at dawn on 9 April 1945. Bonhoeffer was stripped of his clothing and led naked into the execution yard where he was hanged with five others: Canaris; General Hans Oster, Canaris&#x27;s deputy; General Karl Sack, a military jurist; lawyer Theodor Strünck; and German resistance fighter Ludwig Gehre.

Eberhard Bethge, a student and close friend of Bonhoeffer, writes of a man who saw the execution: I saw Pastor Bonhoeffer... kneeling on the floor praying fervently to God. I was most deeply moved by the way this lovable man prayed, so devout and so certain that God heard his prayer. At the place of execution, he again said a short prayer and then climbed the few steps to the gallows, brave and composed. His death ensued after a few seconds. In the almost fifty years that I worked as a doctor, I have hardly ever seen a man die so entirely submissive to the will of God.

This is the historical account of Bonhoeffer&#x27;s death, which over the decades went unchallenged; however, some recent biographers see problems with the story because of Bethge&#x27;s source. The purported witness was a doctor at Flossenbürg concentration camp, Hermann Fischer-Hüllstrung, who may have wished to minimize the suffering of the condemned men to reduce his own culpability in their executions. J.L.F. Mogensen, a former prisoner at Flossenbürg, cited the length of time it took for the execution to be completed (almost six hours), plus departures from camp procedure that may not have been allowed to prisoners so late in the war, as jarring inconsistencies. Considering that the sentences had been confirmed at the highest levels of Nazi government, by individuals with a pattern of torturing prisoners who dared to challenge the regime, Craig J. Slane posits that &quot;the physical details of Bonhoeffer&#x27;s death may have been much more difficult than we earlier had imagined.&quot;

Other recent critics of the traditional account are more caustic. It also appears in some instances that &quot;Fischer-Hüllstrung had been given the job of reviving political prisoners after they had been hanged until they were almost dead, in order to prolong the agony of their dying.&quot; Another critic charges that Fischer-Hüllstrung&#x27;s &quot;subsequent statement about Bonhoeffer as kneeling in wordy prayer ... belongs to the realm of legend,&quot; although without evidence to the contrary.

The disposition of Bonhoeffer&#x27;s remains is not known. His body may have been cremated outside the camp along with hundreds of other recently executed or dead prisoners, or American troops may have placed his body in one of several mass graves in which they interred the unburied dead of the camp.

== Legacy ==
Bonhoeffer is commemorated in the liturgical calendars of several Christian denominations on the anniversary of his death, 9 April. This includes many parts of the Anglican Communion, where he is sometimes identified as a martyr and other times not. His commemoration in the liturgical calendar of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America uses the liturgical color of white, which is typically used for non-martyred saints. In 2008, the General Conference of the United Methodist Church, which does not enumerate saints, officially recognized Bonhoeffer as a &quot;modern-day martyr&quot;. He was the first martyr to be so recognized who lived after the Reformation and is one of only two as of 2017. Bonhoeffer is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 9 April.

The Deutsche Evangelische Kirche in Sydenham, London, at which he preached between 1933 and 1935, was destroyed by bombing in 1944. A replacement church was built in 1958 and named &quot;Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Kirche&quot; in his honor.

Dietrich Bonhoeffer&#x27;s text &#x27;Von guten Mächten&#x27; (translated as &#x27;By Gentle&#x27; or &#x27;By Gracious Powers&#x27;) is known to a large audience as a worship song. The song is often sung at funerals. In 2021 it was voted the most popular hymn in Germany. The best-known melody was written by Siegfried Fietz in 1970.

=== Theological legacy ===
Bonhoeffer&#x27;s theology is subject to diverse and contradictory interpretations, sometimes necessarily based on speculation for example, while his Christocentric approach appeals to conservative, confession-minded Protestants, other commentators note his commitment to justice, and ideas about &quot;religionless Christianity&quot;. He also argued that Christians should not retreat from the world but act within it. He believed that two elements were constitutive of faith: the implementation of justice and the acceptance of divine suffering.

His book &quot;The Cost of Discipleship&quot; famously discusses the concept of cheap grace against costly grace. He contends that Christians have relied so much on Christ&#x27;s forgiveness that they do not challenge themselves enough in actually following his word to their best ability, instead relying on God&#x27;s grace to save them when they fall. Bonhoeffer says that Christians are instructed to strive to follow the Word of God. Only then – after they strive to the best of their ability – should God&#x27;s grace come into play. He contrasts cheap grace with costly grace, writing:

Continuing with this idea, Bonhoeffer discusses the idea of simple obedience. He admonishes Christians who come too quickly to the conclusion that God could not possibly have meant his commands literally. Bonhoeffer cites the example of the rich man who asks Jesus how he can enter the kingdom of heaven. He writes that people often simply assume that Jesus did not mean literally to leave everything and follow him and that instead it was a matter of faith or a command to be inwardly detached. Bonhoeffer writes that God says exactly what he means and that Christians need to follow simple obedience to him by following divine commands as they are written. He writes &quot;only he who believes is obedient, and only he who is obedient believes&quot;.

Years after Bonhoeffer&#x27;s death, some, such as Protestant theologian Thomas Altizer and Jewish religious scholar Richard L. Rubenstein, developed his critique into a thoroughgoing attack against traditional Christianity in the &quot;Death of God&quot; movement, which briefly attracted the attention of the mainstream culture in the mid-1960s. However, some critics—such as Jacques Ellul—have charged that those radical interpretations of Bonhoeffer&#x27;s insights amount to a grave distortion, that Bonhoeffer did not mean to say that God no longer had anything to do with humanity and had become a mere cultural artifact. More recent Bonhoeffer interpretations are more cautious in this regard, respecting the parameters of the neo-orthodox school to which he belonged. Bonhoeffer also influenced the Comboni missionary Father Ezechiele Ramin.

Bonhoeffer&#x27;s dissertation, completed in 1927 and first published in 1930 as &quot;Sanctorum Communio: eine Dogmatische Untersuchung zur Soziologie der Kirche&quot;. In it, he attempts to work out a theology of the person in society, and particularly in the church. Along with explaining his early positions on sin, evil, solidarity, collective spirit, and collective guilt, it unfolds a systematic theology of the Spirit at work in the church and what it implies for questions on authority, freedom, ritual, and eschatology.

Paper, 232 pp: . &quot;Life Together&quot; is a classic which contains Bonhoeffer&#x27;s meditation on the nature of the Christian community. &quot;Prayerbook of the Bible&quot; is a classic meditation on the importance of the Psalms for &quot;Christian prayer&quot;.

* &quot;Ethics. Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, Volume 6&quot;. Dietrich Bonhoeffer; Clifford Green, Editor; Translated by Reinhard Krauss, Douglas W. Stott, and Charles C. West.

Writing fiction—an incomplete drama, a novel fragment, and a short story—occupied much of Bonhoeffer&#x27;s first year in Tegel prison, as well as writing to hisDiscipleshiphis fiancée and dealing with his interrogation. &quot;There is a good deal of autobiography mixed in with it,&quot; he explained to his friend and biographer Eberhard Bethge. Richly annotated by German editors Renate Bethge and Ilse Todt and by Clifford Green, the writings in this book disclose a great deal of Bonhoeffer&#x27;s family context, social world, and cultural milieu. Events from his life are recounted in a way that illuminates his theology. Characters and situations that represent Nazi types and attitudes became a form of social criticism and help to explain Bonhoeffer&#x27;s participation in the resistance movement and the plot to kill Hitler.

The two years of Finkenwalde&#x27;s existence produced some of Bonhoeffer&#x27;s most significant theological work as he prepared these young seminarians for the turbulence and risk of parish ministry in the Confessing Church. Bonhoeffer and his seminarians were under Gestapo surveillance; some of them were arrested and imprisoned. Throughout, he remained dedicated to training them for the ministry and its challenges in a difficult time. This volume includes bible studies, sermons, and lectures on homiletics, pastoral care, and catechesis, giving a moving and up-close portrait of the Confessing Church in these crucial years—the same period during which Bonhoeffer wrote his classics, Discipleship and Life Together.&quot;

Various works in the Bonhoeffer corpus individually published in English
* &quot;The Bonhoeffer Reader&quot;, edited by Clifford Green and Michael DeJonge. Fortress Press, 2013. . A representative collection of all Bonhoeffer&#x27;s theological works in a single volume.
* &quot;Christology&quot; (1966) London: William Collins and New York: Harper and Row. Translation of lectures given in Berlin in 1933, from vol. 3 of &quot;Gesammelte Schriften&quot;, Christian Kaiser Verlag, 1960. retitled as &quot;Christ the Center&quot;, Harper San Francisco 1978 paperback: 
* &quot;The Cost of Discipleship&quot; (1948 in English). Touchstone edition with an introduction by Bishop George Bell and memoir by G. Leibholz, 1995 paperback: . Critical edition published under its original title &quot;Discipleship&quot;: John D. Godsey (editor); Geffrey B. Kelly (editor). Fortress Press, 2000. . Bonhoeffer&#x27;s most widely read book begins, &quot;Cheap grace is the mortal enemy of our church. Our struggle today is for costly grace.&quot; That was a sharp warning to his own church, which was engaged in bitter conflict with the official Nazified state church. First published in 1937 as &quot;Nachfolge&quot; (Discipleship), it soon became a classic exposition of what it means to follow Christ in a modern world beset by a dangerous and criminal government. At its center stands an interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount: what Jesus demanded of his followers—and how the life of discipleship is to be continued in all ages of the post-resurrection church.
* &quot;Life Together&quot;. The stimulus for the writing of &quot;Life Together&quot; was the closing of the preachers&#x27; seminary at Finkenwalde. This treatise contains Bonhoeffer&#x27;s thoughts about the nature of the Christian community based on the common life that he and his seminarians experienced at the seminary and in the &quot;Brother&#x27;s House&quot; there. &quot;Life Together&quot; was completed in 1938, published in 1939 as &quot;Gemeinsames Leben&quot;, and first translated into English in 1954. Harper San Francisco 1978 paperback: 
* &quot;Ethics&quot; (1955 in English by SCM Press). Touchstone edition, 1995 paperback: . This is the culmination of Bonhoeffer&#x27;s theological and personal odyssey, even though the book was not completed and was not the &quot;Ethics&quot; which Bonhoeffer intended to have published. Based on careful reconstruction of the manuscripts, freshly and expertly translated and annotated, the critical edition features an insightful introduction by Clifford Green and an afterword from the German edition&#x27;s editors. Though caught up in the vortex of momentous forces in the Nazi period, Bonhoeffer systematically envisioned a radically Christocentric, incarnational ethic for a post-war world, purposefully recasting Christians&#x27; relation to history, politics, and public life.
* &quot;Letters and Papers from Prison&quot; (Edited originally by Eberhard Bethge; first English translation 1953 by SCM Press). This edition translated by Reginald H. Fuller and Frank Clark from &quot;Widerstand und Ergebung: Briefe und Aufzeichnungen aus der Haft&quot;. Munich: Christian Kaiser Verlag (1970). Touchstone 1997 paperback: . In hundreds of letters, including letters written to his fiancée, Maria von Wedemeyer (selected from the complete correspondence, previously published as &quot;Love Letters from Cell 92&quot; Ruth-Alice von Bismarck and Ulrich Kabitz (editors), Abingdon Press (1995) ), as well as official documents, short original pieces, and a few final sermons, the volume sheds light on Bonhoeffer&#x27;s active resistance to and increasing involvement in the conspiracy against the Hitler regime; his arrest; and his long imprisonment. Finally, Bonhoeffer&#x27;s many exchanges with his family, fiancée, and closest friends, demonstrate the affection and solidarity that accompanied Bonhoeffer to his prison cell, concentration camp, and eventual death.
* &quot;A Testament to Freedom: The Essential Writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer&quot; (1990). Geffrey B. Kelly and F. Burton Nelson, editors. Harper San Francisco 1995 2nd edition, paperback: 
* &quot;Von guten Mächten wunderbar geborgen&quot;: &quot;By Gentle Powers&quot;, a prayer he wrote shortly before his death. Various English translations.
* Bonhoeffer&#x27;s papers are held in the Burke Library at Union Theological Seminary.

<text>Euryalus (; ) refers to the Euryalus fortress, the main citadel of Ancient Syracuse, and to several different characters from Greek mythology and classical literature:

==Classical mythology==
*Euryalus, named on sixth and fifth century BC pottery as being one of the Giants who fought the Olympian gods in the Gigantomachy.

<text>Hyrtacus (; Ancient Greek: Ὕρτακος) is an obscure character associated with the Trojan War in Greek mythology. He was a comrade of King Priam of Troy. Hyrtacus married Arisbe, daughter of King Merops of Percote, after Priam had divorced her to marry Hecabe. Hyrtacus&#x27;s son by Arisbe was named Asius and fought at Troy. In the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Hyrtacus is credited with two more sons, Nisus and Hippocoon. Hyrtacus&#x27;s own parentage is not given.

The name &#x27;Hyrtacus&#x27; is perhaps of Cretan origin, given that there was an ancient city named Hyrtacus (or Hyrtacina) in southwestern Crete.

<doc id="84204" wikidata="Q615201" url="?curid=84204" title="Eurycleia (nurse of Odysseus)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Eurycleia (Ancient Greek: Εὐρύκλεια &quot;Eurýkleia&quot;), or Euryclea (; also known as Antiphata (Ἀντιφάτη &quot;Antipháte&quot;) in other traditions), is the daughter of Ops and granddaughter of Peisenor, as well as the wet-nurse of Odysseus.

== Mythology ==

As a girl, Eurycleia was bought by Laertes, Odysseus&#x27; father. He treated her as his wife, but she was never his consummated lover so as not to dishonor his real wife, Anticleia. She later nursed Telemachus, Odysseus&#x27; son.

Eurycleia was the only person to recognize Odysseus without him first revealing himself (as he did to Telemachus) after he returned home from the Trojan War. After he entered his own house as a guest of Penelope disguised as a beggar, Eurycleia bathed him and recognized him by a scar just above his knee, which he got from a boar while boar hunting with his grandfather Autolycus. Odysseus stopped her from telling Penelope or anyone else (except Telemachus, who already knew) in the house of his true identity.

Eurycleia also informed Odysseus which of his servant girls had been unfaithful to Penelope during his absence, conspiring with Penelope&#x27;s suitors and becoming their lovers. Among them was Melantho. His son Telemachus hanged the twelve that Eurycleia identified.

Later, Eurycleia informed Penelope that Odysseus has returned, but Penelope did not believe the maid. The queen then tested Odysseus to prove that he was indeed her husband and asked him to move the bed Odysseus built in their marriage-chamber; Odysseus told Penelope that it was not possible, as one of the legs of the bed was built into a live olive tree, a secret that only Penelope and Odysseus would know. She finally accepted that her husband had returned.

In addition, it was Eurycleia who gave provisions and supplies to Telemachus from the storehouse before he left for Pylos to seek news about Odysseus. She took an oath not to tell Penelope he had left until twelve days had passed; Telemachus not wanting his mother to be any more worried than she already was.

==Derivative works==
Dennis MacDonald argues in several of his books that the woman who anoints Jesus in chapter 14 of the Gospel of Mark is a reference to Eurycleia. She is the only one to recognize Jesus, and what she has done will be widely known, in the same way that Eurycleia is the only one to recognize Odysseus and whose name means &quot;widely known&quot;.
==In popular culture==
Eurycleia is portrayed by Sylvie in the 1954 film &quot;Ulysses&quot; and by Geraldine Chaplin in the 1997 mini-series &quot;The Odyssey&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, Eurypylus (; ) was the name of several different people:

* Eurypylus, was a Thessalian king, son of Euaemon and Ops. He was a former suitor of Helen thus he led the Thessalians during Trojan War.
* Eurypylus, was son of Telephus and Astyoche. He was a great warrior, who led a Mysian contingent that fought alongside the Trojans against the Greeks in the Trojan War, and was killed by Achilles&#x27; son Neoptolemus.
* Eurypylus, son of Poseidon and king of Cos.
* Eurypylus, another son of Poseidon by the Pleiad Celaeno. He ruled over the Fortunate Islands.
* Eurypylus, the Thespian son of Heracles and Eubote, daughter of King Thespius of Thespiae. Eurypylus and his 49 half-brothers were born of Thespius&#x27; daughters who were impregnated by Heracles in one night, for a week or in the course of 50 days while hunting for the Cithaeronian lion. Later on, the hero sent a message to Thespius to keep seven of these sons and send three of them in Thebes while the remaining forty, joined by Iolaus, were dispatched to the island of Sardinia to found a colony.
* Eurypylus, a Pleuronian prince as the son of King Thestius and Eurythemis, daughter of Cleoboea. He was the brother of Althaea, Leda, Hypermnestra, Evippus, Plexippus and Iphiclus. Eurypylus participated in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar, during which he insulted Atalanta and was killed by Meleager.
* Eurypylus, son of Telestor and father of Asterodia who became the wife of Icarius of Sparta.
* Eurypylus, an Olenian prince as the son of King Dexamenus. He was the brother of Theronice, Theraephone and Deianira, also known as Mnesimache or Hippolyte. Eurypylus accompanied Heracles in his Trojan campaign. According to Pausanias, some authors related of him, and not of the son of Euaemon, the story of the cursed chest.
* Eurypylus, a prince of Tiryns as son of King Eurystheus and possibly Antimache, daughter of Amphidamas of Arcadia. He and his brothers Eurybius and Perimedes were all slain by Heracles when at a sacrificial meal in honor of his Twelve Labors being completed they served him a smaller portion of meat than they did for themselves. Eurypylus&#x27; other possible siblings were Admete, Alexander, Iphimedon and Mentor.

<text>In Greek mythology, Thestius (; Ancient Greek: Θέστιος) was a king of Pleuronians in Aetolia. He is not to be confused with Thespius, who was sometimes referred to as &quot;Thestius&quot;. The patronymic &quot;Thestias&quot; may refer to one of his daughters, Leda or Althaea, and &quot;Thestiades&quot; to his son Iphiclus.

== Family ==
Thestius was the son either of Ares by Demonice or Pisidice, or of Agenor (son of Pleuron) possibly by Epicasta. He was the brother of Evenus, Pylus and Molus or of Demonice and Porthaon instead. Thestius was the father of Iphiclus by Leucippe or Eurythemis, daughter of Cleoboea, who was the mother of his other children, Althaea, Eurypylus, Evippus, Hypermnestra, Leda and Plexippus. In other sources, the mother of Iphiclus, Althaea and Leda was named either Laophonte, daughter of Pleuron or Deidameia, daughter of Perieres. Other sons of Thestius were Cometes and Prothous, Toxeus, Aphares and Calydon.

== Mythology ==
Thestius was allied with Tyndareus and Icarius against Hippocoon. According to Strabo, when Tyndareus and his brother Icarius, after being banished by Hippocoön from their homeland, went to Thestius, the king of the Pleuronii. The king helped the two brothers to acquire possession of much of the country on the far side of the Acheloüs on condition that they should receive a share of it. Tyndareus, however, went back home, having married Leda, the daughter of Thestius, whereas Icarius stayed on, keeping a portion of Acarnania, and by Polycaste, the daughter of Lygaeus, begot both Penelope and her brothers.

In a rare variant of the myth by Plutarch, the river Achelous in Aetolia was formerly called after Thestius. This Thestius who upon some domestic discontent traveled as far as Sicyon, where he had resided for some time, returned to his native home. But finding there his son Calydon and his mother [i.e. Pisidice] both upon the bed together, believing him to be an adulterer, slew his own child by a mistake. But when he beheld the unfortunate and unexpected fact he had committed, he threw himself into the river Axenos, which from thence was afterwards called Thestius.

<text>The name Tecmessa () refers to the following characters in Greek mythology:

* Tecmessa, daughter of Teleutas, King of Phrygia, or Teuthras, King of Teuthrania in Mysia, or Tethras or Teuthas. During the Trojan War, Telamonian Ajax kills Tecmessa&#x27;s father and takes her captive; his reason for doing so may have been, as the 1st-century BC Roman poet, Horace, wrote, that Ajax was captivated by Tecmessa&#x27;s beauty. In Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Ajax&quot;, Tecmessa unsuccessfully tries to dissuade Ajax from committing suicide. She is the first to find his corpse, which she promptly covers with her own clothing to prevent further heartache. Their infant son, Eurysaces, however, survives the incident.
* Tecmessa, one of the Amazons killed by Heracles in his quest for the girdle of Hippolyte.

<text>Eurysaces (Ancient Greek: Εὐρυσάκης) in Greek mythology was the son of the Ajax and the enslaved former Teuthranian princess Tecmessa. He was venerated in Athens. Eurysaces was named after his father&#x27;s famous shield. In Sophocles&#x27; tragedy &quot;Ajax&quot;, the protagonist hands the shield to his young son before committing suicide.

Eurysaces was then taken to Ajax&#x27;s native land, Salamis Island, and he soon became king there. Eurysaces&#x27;s uncle Teucer, founded the town of Salamis on Cyprus, and later attempted to return to the island, but he was repelled by Eurysaces. Teucer later established Galacia in Spain. Sophocles wrote a play titled &quot;Eurysaces&quot;, but only one quotation from it survives.

<doc id="84211" wikidata="Q24441" url="?curid=84211" title="Nakh languages">
<text>The Nakh languages are a group of languages within the Northeast Caucasian family, spoken chiefly by the Chechens and Ingush in the North Caucasus.

Bats is the endangered language of the Bats people, an ethnic minority in Georgia.
The Chechen, Ingush and Bats peoples are also grouped under the ethno-linguistic umbrella of Nakh peoples.

==Classification==
The Nakh languages were historically classified as an independent North-Central Caucasian family, but are now recognized as a branch of the Northeast Caucasian family. 

The separation of Nakh from common Northeast Caucasian has been tentatively dated to the Neolithic (ca. 4th millennium BC).
* Nakh language family
** Vainakh languages, a dialect continuum with two literary languages:
*** Chechen – approximately 2,000,000 speakers (2020).
*** Ingush – approximately 400,000 speakers (2020).
** Bats or Batsbi – approximately 3,420 (2000), spoken mostly in Zemo-Alvani, Georgia. Not mutually intelligible with Chechen or Ingush.
==The voicing of ejective consonants==
The Nakh languages are relevant to the glottalic theory of Indo-European, because the Vainakh branch has undergone the voicing of ejectives that has been postulated but widely derided as improbable in that family. In initial position, Bats ejectives correspond to Vainakh ejectives, but in non-initial position to Vainakh voiced consonants. (The exception is , which remains an ejective in Vainakh.)

A similar change has taken place in some of the other Dagestanian languages.

== Proposed connections to extinct languages ==
Many obscure ancient languages or peoples have been postulated by scholars of the Caucasus as Nakh, many in the South Caucasus. None of these have been confirmed; most are classified as Nakh on the basis of placenames.

===Èrsh===
The Èrsh language, language of the Èrs who inhabited Northern Armenia, and then, (possibly) later, mainly Hereti in Southeast Georgia and Northwest Azerbaijan. This is considered to be more or less confirmed as Nakh. They were assimilated eventually, and their language was replaced by Georgian or Azeri.

===Malkh===
The language of the Malkhs (whose name, malkh, refers to the sun) in the North Caucasus, who lived in modern day Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay–Cherkessia, and once briefly conquered Ubykhia and Abkhazia, is believed to be of Nakh affiliation. They were conquered first by Scythian-speaking Alan tribes and then by Turkic tribes, and seem to have largely abandoned their homeland and found shelter among the Chechens, leading to the formation of a teip named after them. Those who stayed behind were either wiped out or assimilated.

===Dval===
The language of the Dvals is thought to be Nakh by many historians, though there is a rivaling camp arguing for its status as a close relative of Ossetic. Various backing for the Nakh theory (different scholars use different arguments) includes the presence of Nakh placenames in former Dval territory, evidence of Nakh–Svan contact which probably would&#x27;ve required the Nakh nature of the Dvals or people there before them, and the presence of a foreign-origin Dval clan among the Chechens, seemingly implying that the Dvals found shelter (like the Malkhs are known to have done) among the Chechens from the conquest of their land by foreign invaders (presumably Ossetes).

===Tsov===
According to Georgian scholars I. A. Javashvili and Giorgi Melikishvili, the Urartian state of Supani was occupied by the ancient Nakh tribe Tsov, whose state is called Tsobena in ancient Georgian historiography. The Tsov language was the dominant language spoken by its people, and was thought by these Georgian historians (as well as a number of others) to be Nakh. Tsov and its relatives in the area may have contributed to the Hurro-Urartian substratum in the Armenian language.

<text>Decision Before Dawn is a 1951 American war film directed by Anatole Litvak, starring Richard Basehart, Oskar Werner, and Hans Christian Blech. It tells the story of the U.S. Army using potentially unreliable German prisoners of war to gather intelligence as clandestine &quot;line-crossers&quot; in the closing days of World War II. The film was adapted by Peter Viertel and Jack Rollens (uncredited) from the novel &quot;Call It Treason&quot; by George L. Howe. The film was a critical success and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

==Plot==
By late 1944, as the Allies march toward the Rhine, it is obvious Germany will lose the war. American Colonel Devlin (Gary Merrill) leads a military intelligence unit that enlists German POWs to cross back over and spy on their former comrades. &quot;Tiger&quot; (Hans Christian Blech), a cynical mercenary, is one such recruit. There is also &quot;Happy&quot; (Oskar Werner), a young, idealistic medical student. Monique (Dominique Blanchar), a former resistance operative, trains Happy and others in espionage techniques. Later, Devlin learns a Wehrmacht general wants to negotiate surrender of his entire command. Thus, a mission is organized. Devlin selects Lieutenant Rennick (Richard Basehart) to lead. He is a man who hates turncoats on both sides of the war. Tiger is chosen; he knows the area well. Happy is given a related task of locating the 11th Panzer Corps, which might oppose the mass surrender. All three parachute into Germany, then split up.

During his search for the 11th Panzer unit, Happy encounters Germans with differing attitudes towards the war. On buses and trains, in guest houses and taverns, he meets those who are still defiant, such as SS courier Scholtz (Wilfried Seyferth), and those who are now resigned to defeat, like Hilde (Hildegard Knef), a war widow turned hooker. Eventually, Happy locates the 11th Panzer, posing as a medic. He is selected to treat its commander, Oberst von Ecker (O.E. Hasse), at his castle headquarters. Afterwards, Happy narrowly escapes capture by the Gestapo. He makes his way to a safe house in the ruins of heavily-bombed Mannheim, where Rennick and Tiger hide out. They have learned that the German commander they were to contact has supposedly been injured and in a hospital under SS guard; without him, the other German officers cannot and will not surrender to the Allies.

After their radio is knocked out, Happy, Tiger, and Rennick make their way to the banks of the Rhine, where they plan to swim across to American lines. At the last moment, however, Tiger loses his nerve and runs away, forcing Rennick to kill him, lest their mission be revealed. As Rennick and Happy are about to swim for the opposite shore, they are spotted. Facing torture and execution, Happy nonetheless bravely draws the Germans&#x27; attention away from Rennick by surrendering. His sacrifice enables the lieutenant to make it to safety. Thus Rennick survives, with his previous ideas on &quot;treason&quot; now challenged.

==Cast==
* Oskar Werner as Corporal Karl Maurer (&quot;Happy&quot;)
* Richard Basehart as Lieutenant Dick Rennick
* Hans Christian Blech as Sergeant Rudolf Barth (&quot;Tiger&quot;)
* Gary Merrill as Colonel Devlin
* Hildegard Knef as Hilde
* Wilfried Seyferth as Heinz Scholtz
* Dominique Blanchar as Monique
* O.E. Hasse as Oberst (Colonel) von Ecker
* Helene Thimig as Paula Schneider

==Production==
The film was adapted from the novel &quot;Call it Treason&quot;, which was based on the wartime experiences of the author George L. Howe, who served with the Office of Strategic Services unit attached to the Seventh Army during World War II.

The citizens of the cities of Würzburg, Nürnberg, and Mannheim, where some of the picture&#x27;s battle scenes were shot, were forewarned of their filming by newspaper and radio announcements. Some were overseen by the U.S. military, as Germany was still under military occupation at the time the film was shot.

==Reception==
At the 24th Academy Awards, &quot;Decision Before Dawn&quot; was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, with Dorothy Spencer nominated for Best Film Editing.

Bob Thomas praised the film in his 1951 newspaper column, describing it as &quot;movie-making at its best. ... By using the real German cities and people, this film has created a stirring and realistic picture of a dying nation.&quot; He also praised the performances of Basehart, Merrill and Werner.

Upon seeing the film, General Douglas MacArthur said &quot;This is the finest picture I have seen this year, and I nominate it for an Academy Award.&quot;

In a 2006 review, &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; film critic J.R. Jones was less enthused, writing &quot;By the time Fox released this 1952 feature, the patriotic orthodoxy of Hollywood war movies had softened enough to allow for a German hero, but not a very engaging one; the inherent drama of his divided loyalty is mostly bypassed in favor of a slack espionage plot.&quot; However, Jones applauded Werner&#x27;s &quot;magnetic performance&quot; and thought that Knef &quot;is devastating in her brief turn as a war-weary hooker.&quot;

In 2008 Emanuel Levy called &quot;Decision Before Dawn&quot; a &quot;stirring drama ... And while not made as an explicitly agit-prop, it does convey its humanist anti-war message, without the usual sentimentality.&quot;

<text>Juan Laporte, also known as Juan La Porte (born November 24, 1959) is a former boxer who was born in Guayama, Puerto Rico. In 1982, La Porte won the vacant WBC featherweight title, forcing undefeated Colombian Mario &quot;Martillo&quot; Miranda to quit on his stool. Throughout his 22-year-long career, La Porte fought some of the greatest fighters of each decade, including Hall of Fame members Salvador Sanchez, Eusebio Pedroza, Azumah Nelson, Wilfredo Gomez, Barry McGuigan, Kostya Tszyu &amp; Julio Cesar Chavez Sr. He retired in 1999 with a record of 40–16, with many of his losses being highly competitive, and sometimes controversial, affairs.

==Amateur career==
Juan Laporte won the 1976 112 lb New York Golden Gloves Sub-Novice Championship. He defeated Long Island&#x27;s Ricky Brown in the finals. Laporte was defeated by Joseph Nieto of the Police Athletic Leagues Lynch Center in the 1977 118 lb Open Championship. Laporte trained at the Lunar Boys Club in Brooklyn, New York. He had an amateur record of 29–6, according to the March 1983 &quot;Ring Magazine&quot;.

==Professional career==
Juan Laporte moved to New York at a young age, where he grew up into a pretty well known contender, but one that many boxing critics didn&#x27;t consider to be material to become a world champion earlier in his career.

Laporte built a number of wins, combined with 1 loss, including a 7-round knockout of Jean Lapointe. But he still was an unknown when given his first chance at a world championship in December 1980 in El Paso, Texas.

He met legendary Mexican world Featherweight champion Salvador Sánchez there. Laporte made Sanchez work hard and won a handful of rounds. He lost to Sanchez by a 15-round unanimous decision.

Laporte then fought future world champion Rocky Lockridge in 1981 at Las Vegas, scoring a second-round knockout to become the United States Featherweight champion.

Given a second title shot, this time by the WBA, Laporte met the also legendary world featherweight champion Eusebio Pedroza in 1982, losing a close and controversial unanimous decision, after having Pedroza hurt in round two. The fight was so close that WBC president José Sulaimán decided to give Laporte a rematch vs Sanchez for the World Boxing Council&#x27;s world title.

This rematch wasn&#x27;t going to happen, because Sanchez died in a car accident the morning of August 12, in Mexico City. Then, the WBC decided to put Laporte vs. Colombian Mario Miranda for the vacant world title in a fight held at the Madison Square Garden. Laporte dropped Miranda in the tenth round and Miranda quit on his stool before the start of the 11th. Juan Laporte, the tough kid from New York who couldn&#x27;t figure to become a world champ versus the legendary champions of the day, had become a world champion.

Around this time, Laporte was sponsored by the American jeans brand, Sasson, sporting their name and logo on his boxing trunks (shorts) during his fights.

Laporte defended his title twice, vs. Ruben Castillo and Johnny De La Rosa, both 12 rounds decision wins, then lost it to another Puerto Rican world champion, the legendary Wilfredo Gómez.

In 1985, he went to Ireland, where he lost a ten-round decision to future world champion Barry McGuigan.

In 1986, Laporte fought Julio César Chávez at the Madison Square Garden, and many thought Laporte deserved the 12-round decision that night, but he lost a unanimous decision in a contest for Chavez&#x27;s WBC world Jr. Lightweight title.

His career went on and off after that day, and in 1989, his son died in a drowning accident. Laporte buried his title belt along with his son.

Upon hearing this, Sulaiman sent him a new world title belt to show him support and respect from the boxing community. Around that era, on April 29, 1989, Laporte fought on the WBO&#x27;s inaugural world Junior Lightweight championship bout, losing by a 12 rounds unanimous decision for the vacant title to his countryman, John John Molina, 18-2 before their fight, at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan. Laporte lost another disputed decision later on, this time to former world Jr Welterweight champion Billy Costello in 1999, and then finally retired from boxing.

==Life after boxing==
He has retired to his native Puerto Rico and dedicates his time to train children of all ages in his spare time.

<doc id="84221" wikidata="Q1386394" url="?curid=84221" title="Galanthis">
<text>In Greek mythology, Galanthis or Galinthias () was the woman who interfered with Hera&#x27;s plan to hinder the birth of Heracles in favor of Eurystheus, and was changed into a weasel or cat as punishment for being so insolent as to deceive the goddesses of birth that were acting on Hera&#x27;s behalf.

== Mythology ==

=== Ovid&#x27;s account ===
In the version followed by Ovid in &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Galanthis was the red-gold haired servant of Alcmene, who assisted her during the birth of Heracles. When Alcmene was in labor, she was having difficulty giving birth to a child so large. After seven days she called for assistance from Lucina, the goddess of childbirth (that is, the Greek Eileithyia). However, Lucina did not help her due to the wishes of Hera. Instead, she clasped her hands and crossed her legs, preventing the child from being born. Alcmene struggled in pain, cursed the heavens, and became close to death. Galanthis noticed Lucina and deduced Hera&#x27;s plans. She told the goddess that the baby was born; this so startled her that she jumped up and unclasped her hands. This freed Alcmene, and she was able to give birth. Galanthis laughed and ridiculed Lucina, and as a punishment was turned into a weasel or cat. She continued to live with Alcmene after her transformation, thus initiating the practice of weasels being kept as household animals.

=== Antoninus&#x27; account ===
The account of Antoninus Liberalis makes Galinthias a daughter of the Theban Proetus, and a playmate of Alcmene. In his version, Eileithyia and the Moerae came to Alcmene and held her tight to make her labor pains last longer, so as to please Hera. Galinthias confused them by telling that Alcmene had given birth by the will of Zeus, and accordingly all the rites in honor of the birth goddesses had been cancelled. The goddesses were taken aback and loosened their grip so Alcmene delivered. The Moerae, enraged by the fact that a mortal was able to deceive them, changed Galinthias into a weasel, an animal that in ancient times was believed to conceive through the ear and give birth through the mouth via the curse of the scorned deities. Hecate, however, took pity on Galanthis and took her in as one of her Familiars, making the weasel one of her own sacred animals. 

When Heracles grew up, he built a sanctuary to Galinthias and sacrificed to her; the practice of honouring Galinthias in Thebes lasted down to late times.

The myth of Galanthis is also briefly mentioned by Pausanias: he recounts the Theban version of the story, which referred to the heroine as Historis, called her a daughter of Tiresias, and made no mention of her transformation. In this version, she deceived the female agents of Hera known as the Pharmacides (&quot;Herbalists&quot; or &quot;Sorceresses&quot;) who had been keeping Alcmene from giving birth, by announcing the birth of the child, which made the Pharmacides leave and let Alcmene be delivered.

Martens and weasels were thought to have magical potency in ancient Greece, both of the beneficial and maleficent kind. They were also credited with causing labour pains to pregnant women if they ran past them, hence Galanthis&#x27; role in Alcmene&#x27;s childbirth and transformation into a weasel.

==Popular culture==
* Gale appears as a character in Rick Riordan&#x27;s novels &quot;The House of Hades&quot; and &quot;Wrath of the Triple Goddess&quot;.
* In the game, &quot;Hades II&quot; (the sequel to &quot;Hades&quot;), &quot;Gale&quot; is the name of the Polecat Familiar of the goddess, Hecate, and is often seen at the Crossroads, alongside her fellow Familiar, Hecuba the Black Hound. It is uncertain if Gale, here, is meant to be the same Galanthis the midwife at Heracles&#x27;s birth, turned into a Polecat by Hera out of spite, or a former witch named Gale, who angered Hecate.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Gargareans, or Gargarenses, ( &quot;Gargareis&quot;) were an all-male tribe. They copulated with the Amazons annually in order to keep both tribes reproductive. The Amazons kept the female children, raising them as warriors, and gave the males to the Gargareans.

The ancient Greek geographer Strabo placed the Gargareans on the northern foothills of the Caucasus. Several scholars identify them with the Galgaï. According to E. Krupnov, the accuracy of the localization of Strabo&#x27;s Gargareans in &quot;Galga-chuv&quot; (Ingushetia) is confirmed by archaeological, anthropological and ethnographic data. Gaius Plinius Secundus likewise localizes the Gargareans north of the Caucasus Mountains, but calls them &quot;Gegar&quot;.

<doc id="84228" wikidata="Q653015" url="?curid=84228" title="Compound bow">
<text>In modern archery, a compound bow is a bow that uses a levering system, usually of cables and pulleys, to bend the limbs. The compound bow was first developed in 1966 by Holless Wilbur Allen in North Kansas City, Missouri, and a US patent was granted in 1969. Compound bows are widely used in target practice and hunting.

Compound bows are typically constructed of man-made materials such as fiberglass and carbon fiber, while traditional bows and warbows usually are entirely or partially made of wood or bamboo.

The pulley/cam system grants the user a mechanical advantage, and so the limbs of a compound bow are much stiffer than those of a recurve bow or longbow. This rigidity makes the compound bow more energy-efficient than traditional bows, as less energy is dissipated in limb movement. The higher-rigidity, more advanced construction also improves accuracy by reducing the bow&#x27;s sensitivity to changes in temperature and humidity. In literature of the early 20th century, before the invention of compound bows, composite bows were described as &quot;compound&quot;.

==Construction==

A bow&#x27;s central mount for other components (limbs, sights, stabilizers and quivers) is called the riser. Risers are designed to be as rigid as possible. The central riser of a compound bow is usually made of aluminum, magnesium alloy, or carbon fiber and many are made of 7075 aluminum alloy.

Limbs are made of fiberglass-based composite materials, or occasionally wood, and able to withstand high tensile and compressive forces. The limbs store the kinetic energy of the bow – no energy is stored in the pulleys and cables. Draw weights of adult compound bows range is between , which can create arrow speeds of .

In the most common configuration, there is a cam or wheel at the end of each limb. The shape of the cam may vary somewhat between different bow designs. There are several different concepts of using the cams to store energy in the limbs, and these all fall under a category called bow eccentrics. The four most common types of bow eccentrics are Single Cam, Hybrid Cam, Dual Cam and Binary Cam. However, there are also other less common designs, like the Quad Cam and Hinged. Cams are often described using their &quot;let-off&quot; rating. As a cam is rotated, the force required to hold the bow in position reaches a peak and then decreases as the bow approaches maximum extension (a position known as &quot;the wall&quot;). The percent-difference between the maximum force encountered during the draw and the force required to hold the bow in full extension is the &quot;let-off&quot;. This value is commonly between 65% and 80% of the peak weight for recently designed compound bows, although some older compound bows provided a let-off of only 50% and some recent designs achieve let-offs in excess of 90%.

As the string is drawn the cam turns and imparts force to compress the limb. Initially, the archer has the &#x27;short&#x27; side of the cam, with the leverage being a mechanical disadvantage. High energy input is therefore required. When near full draw is reached, the cam has turned to its full extent, the archer has gained mechanical advantage, and the least amount of force needs to be applied to the string to keep the limbs bent. This is known as &quot;let off&quot;. The lower holding weight enables the archer to maintain the bow fully drawn and take more time to aim. This let-off enables the archer to accurately shoot a compound bow with a much higher peak draw weight than other bows (see below).

However, there are some youth-oriented compound bows with low draw weights that have no let-off and have a maximum draw length deliberately set farther than the majority of young shooters would reach. This effectively makes the bow function very similar to a recurve, with the draw length determined by the shooter&#x27;s preferred anchor point. This removes the necessity to adjust the bow draw length or use a different bow for different shooters (or to change bows as the shooter gets older). An example of this type of bow is the Genesis, which is standard equipment in the U.S. National Archery in the Schools Program.

Compound bow strings and cables are normally made of high-modulus polyethylene and are designed to have great tensile strength and minimal stretchability, so that the bow transfers its energy to the arrow as efficiently and durably as possible. In earlier models of compound bows, the cables were often made of plastic-coated steel.

==Comparison to other bow types==
===Technical advantages===

* The function of the cam systems (known as the &#x27;eccentrics&#x27;) is to maximize the energy storage throughout the draw cycle and provide let-off at the end of the cycle (less holding weight at full draw). A traditional recurve bow has a very linear draw weight curve - meaning that as the bow is drawn back, the draw force becomes heavier with each inch of draw (and most difficult at full draw). Therefore, little energy is stored in the first half of the draw, and much more energy at the end where the draw weight is heaviest. The compound bow operates with a different weight profile, reaching its peak weight within the first few inches of the draw, and remaining more flat and constant until the end of the cycle where the cams &quot;let-off&quot; and allow a reduced holding weight. This manipulation of the peak weight throughout the draw (accomplished by the elliptical shape of the cams that change leverage and mechanical advantage) is why compound bows store more energy and shoot faster than an equivalent peak weight recurve bow or longbow.
*The design of the cams directly controls the acceleration of the arrow. What is termed a &quot;soft cam&quot; will accelerate the arrow more gently than a &quot;harder&quot; cam. Novice archers will typically shoot a soft cam whereas a more advanced archer may choose to use a harder cam to gain speed. Bows can be had with a variety of cams, in a full spectrum from soft to hard.
*Some pulley systems use a single cam at the bottom of the bow and a round idler wheel at the top of the bow instead of two identical cams. This design eliminates the need for a separate control cable and instead uses a single long string that begins at the cam on the bottom of the bow, travels over the wheel on top, and back to the bottom cam. A separate buss cable then connects the bottom cam to the top limb.
*When a compound bow is drawn, the limbs are pulled in toward each other by the cables, unlike a longbow or recurve where the limbs flex in the direction of the bow string. This difference allows modern compounds to have limbs that are closer to horizontal instead of angled. The horizontal, or &quot;parallel&quot; limb configuration minimizes the recoil and vibration felt by the shooter when the arrow is released, as the forces going upward at the top limb and downward at the bottom limb cancel each other out.
*The pulley system will usually include some rubber-covered blocks that act as draw-stops. These provide a solid &quot;wall&quot; that the archer can draw against. These draw stops can be adjusted to suit the archer&#x27;s optimum draw-length, which helps the archer achieve a consistent anchor point and a consistent amount of force imparted to the arrow on every shot, further increasing accuracy.

===Technical disadvantages===
* The relatively larger number of moving parts requires additional maintenance and creates more potential points of failure.
* Dry firing is more likely to damage or destroy a compound bow due to the greater amount of energy stored and released.
* Unlike traditional bows, draw length and let-off adjustments as well as string or cable replacements often require a bow press, a specialized tool used for compressing the limbs to take tension off the cables and string.
* Drawing a compound bow with just the fingers increases the likelihood of torquing the bowstring, which could derail it from the cams. The use of a mechanical release-aid is often required to avoid this.
* Usually heavier than recurves and longbows.

===Circumstantial advantages===
* Compound archers often use a mechanical release aid to hold and release the string. This attaches to the bowstring near the point where the arrow attaches, the nocking point, and permits the archer to release the string with a squeeze of a trigger or a slight increase of tension. The use of a release aid gives a more consistent release than the use of fingers on the string as it minimises the arrow oscillation which is inevitable when the bowstring is released directly from the fingers.
* In tournaments, competition rules for compound archers allow bows with a sighting system, consisting of a &quot;peep sight&quot; held within the bowstring that acts as a back sight, however front sights attached to the riser are allowable in other classes. Some front sights are magnifying and/or adjustable for targets at different distances. Some sights have multiple &quot;pins&quot; set up for targets at different distances.

===Circumstantial disadvantages===
*The relatively low holding weight of a compound bow compared to a recurve bow makes the compound more sensitive to certain shooting form faults when the archer is at full draw. In particular, it&#x27;s easier for the archer to torque (twist) the bow around the vertical axis, leading to left-right errors, and also a plucked or snatched release can have more effect.

==Specifications==
AMO (Archery Manufacturers and merchants Organization, the former name of the body now known as the Archery Trade Association) standard draw length is the distance from the string at full draw to the lowest point on the grip plus . Because the draw force may increase more or less rapidly, and again drop off more or less rapidly when approaching peak draw, bows of the same peak draw force can store different amounts of energy. Norbert Mullaney has defined the ratio of stored energy to peak draw force (S.E./P.D.F.). This is usually around but can reach .

The efficiency of bows also varies. Normally between 70 and 85% of the stored energy is transferred to the arrow. This stored energy is referred to as potential energy. When transferred to the arrow it is referred to as kinetic energy. The product of S.E./P.D.F. and efficiency can be called the power factor. There are two measurement standards of this quantity – ATA and IBO speed. ATA is defined as the initial velocity of a arrow when shot from a bow with a peak draw weight of and draw length of . IBO speed is defined as the initial velocity of an arrow with a weight of per pound of draw weight. While many manufacturers measure IBO speeds using a draw weight of and draw length of , the IBO standard allows a draw weight of as high as , and does not specify a draw length. The average IBO speed for the majority of compound bows on the market hovers around 310–320 feet per second.

Brace height is the distance from the pivot point of the grip to the string at rest. Typically a shorter brace height will result in an increased power stroke, but comes at the price of a bow that&#x27;s less forgiving to shooter error and having harsher string slap.

==Arrows==

Arrows used with compound bows do not differ significantly from those used with recurve bows, being typically either aluminum alloy, carbon fiber, or a composite of the two materials. Wooden arrows are not commonly used on compound bows because of their fragility. Most arrows in use today are of the carbon fiber variety. An important distinction arrow-wise between recurve bows and compound bows is that of arrow spine. Compound bows and target recurve bows with fully center-shot cutaway risers tend to be very forgiving in regard to spine selection. Modern compound bows are typically equipped with substantially stiffer arrows than an equivalent draw-length and draw-weight recurve bow would be. Another advantage of the center-shot riser is that the arrow need not bend around the riser (nearly as much or at all) during the shot. Fine-tuning may be accomplished by adjustment of the arrow rest, or nock point on the string, rather than by changing arrow-length and tip weight.

Manufacturers produce arrow shafts with different weights, different spines (stiffness), and different lengths in the same model of shaft to accommodate different draw weights and lengths, matched to archers&#x27; different styles, preferences and physical attributes.

Arrow stiffness (spine) is an important parameter in finding arrows that will shoot accurately from any particular bow (see Archer&#x27;s paradox), the spine varying with both the construction and length of the arrow.

Another important consideration is that the IBO (International Bowhunting Organization) recommends at least of draw weight as a safety buffer. This means a bow that draws would need at least a finished-with-tip arrow. Shooting arrows lighter than this guideline risks damage to the bow similar to that caused by dry-firing, which can in turn cause injury to the archer or anyone standing nearby. Shooting arrows that are too light also voids most manufacturer warranties.

<text>The Robe is a 1942 historical novel about the Crucifixion of Jesus, written by Lloyd C. Douglas. The book was one of the best-selling titles of the 1940s. It entered the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in October 1942, four weeks later rose to No. 1, and held the position for nearly a year. &quot;The Robe&quot; remained on the list for another two years, returning several other times over the next several years including when the film adaptation (featuring Richard Burton in an early role) was released in 1953.

==Inspiration==
Lloyd C. Douglas began his literary career after leaving the ministry at the age of 52. All of his novels, essays, and short stories relied on his spiritual background for thematic and creative inspiration. At the height of his popularity, Douglas was receiving on average 100 letters a week from fans. 

One of these letters provided the inspiration for &quot;The Robe&quot;. Hazel McCann, a department store clerk from Ohio, wrote to Douglas asking what he thought had happened to Christ&#x27;s garments after the crucifixion. Douglas immediately began working on a novel based on this concept, sending each chapter to McCann as he finished it. Douglas and McCann finally met in 1941, and it is to her that Douglas has dedicated the book.

==Plot==
The book explores the aftermath of the crucifixion of Jesus through the experiences of the Roman tribune Marcellus Gallio and his Greek slave Demetrius. Prince Gaius, in an effort to rid Rome of Marcellus, banishes Marcellus to the command of the Roman garrison at Minoa, a port city in southern Palestine. In Jerusalem during Passover, Marcellus ends up carrying out the crucifixion of Jesus but is troubled since he believes Jesus is innocent of any crime.

Marcellus and some other soldiers throw dice to see who will take Jesus&#x27; seamless robe. Marcellus wins and asks Demetrius to take care of the robe. 

Following the crucifixion, Marcellus takes part in a banquet attended by Pontius Pilate. During the banquet, a drunken centurion insists that Marcellus wear Jesus&#x27; robe. Reluctantly wearing the garment, Marcellus apparently suffers a nervous breakdown and returns to Rome.

Sent to Athens to recuperate, Marcellus finally gives in to Demetrius&#x27; urging and touches the robe, and his mind is subsequently restored. Marcellus, now believing the robe has some sort of innate power, returns to Judea, follows the path Jesus took, and meets many people whose lives Jesus had affected. Based upon their experiences, first Demetrius and then Marcellus become followers of Jesus. 

Marcellus then returns to Rome, where he must report his experiences to the emperor Tiberius at Villa Jovis on Capri. Marcellus frees Demetrius, who escapes. However, later on, because of his uncompromising stance regarding his Christian faith, both Marcellus and his new wife Diana are executed by the new emperor, Caligula. Marcellus arranges that the robe be given to &quot;The Big Fisherman&quot; (Simon Peter).

<doc id="84237" wikidata="Q1932" url="?curid=84237" title="Space Race">
<text>The Space Race (, ) was a 20th-century competition between the Cold War rivals, the United States and the Soviet Union, to achieve superior spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the ballistic missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations following World War II and the onset of the cold war. The technological advantage demonstrated by spaceflight achievement was seen as necessary for national security, particularly in regard to intercontinental ballistic missile and satellite reconnaissance capability, but also became part of the cultural symbolism and ideology of the time. The Space Race brought pioneering launches of artificial satellites, robotic landers to the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and ultimately to the Moon.

Public interest in space travel originated in the 1951 publication of a Soviet youth magazine and was promptly picked up by US magazines. The competition began on July 30, 1955, when the United States announced its intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year. Four days later, the Soviet Union responded by declaring they would also launch a satellite &quot;in the near future&quot;. The launching of satellites was enabled by developments in ballistic missile capabilities since the end of World War II. The competition gained Western public attention with the &quot;Sputnik crisis&quot;, when the USSR achieved the first successful satellite launch, Sputnik 1, on October 4, 1957. It gained momentum when the USSR sent the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into space with the orbital flight of Vostok 1 on April 12, 1961. These were followed by a string of other firsts achieved by the Soviets over the next few years.

Gagarin&#x27;s flight led US president John F. Kennedy to raise the stakes on May 25, 1961, by asking the US Congress to commit to the goal of &quot;landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth&quot; before the end of the decade. Both countries began developing super heavy-lift launch vehicles, with the US successfully deploying the Saturn V, which was large enough to send a three-person orbiter and two-person lander to the Moon. Kennedy&#x27;s Moon landing goal was achieved in July 1969, with the flight of Apollo 11. The USSR continued to pursue crewed lunar programs to launch and land on the Moon before the US with its N1 rocket but did not succeed, and eventually canceled it to concentrate on Salyut, the first space station program, and the first landings on Venus and on Mars. Meanwhile, the US landed five more Apollo crews on the Moon, and continued exploration of other extraterrestrial bodies robotically.

A period of détente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a cooperative Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew and joint development of an international docking standard APAS-75. Being considered as the final act of the Space Race by many observers, the competition was however only gradually replaced with cooperation. The collapse of the Soviet Union eventually allowed the US and the newly reconstituted Russian Federation to end their Cold War competition also in space, by agreeing in 1993 on the Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; and International Space Station programs.

== Origins ==

Although Germans, Americans and Soviets experimented with small liquid-fuel rockets before World War II, launching satellites and humans into space required the development of larger ballistic missiles such as Wernher von Braun&#x27;s Aggregat-4 (A-4), which became known as the Vergeltungswaffe 2 (V-2) developed by Nazi Germany to bomb the Allies in the war. After the war, both the US and USSR acquired custody of German rocket development assets which they used to leverage the development of their own missiles.

Public interest in space flight was first aroused in October 1951 when the Soviet rocketry engineer Mikhail Tikhonravov published &quot;Flight to the Moon&quot; in the newspaper &quot;Pionerskaya pravda&quot; for young readers. He described a two-person interplanetary spaceship of the future and the industrial and technological processes required to create it. He ended the short article with a clear forecast of the future: &quot;We do not have long to wait. We can assume that the bold dream of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky will be realized within the next 10 to 15 years.&quot; From March 1952 to April 1954, the US &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine reacted with a series of seven articles Man Will Conquer Space Soon! detailing Wernher von Braun&#x27;s plans for crewed spaceflight. In March 1955, Disneyland&#x27;s animated episode &quot;Man in Space&quot; which was broadcast on US television with an audience of about 40 million people, eventually fired the public enthusiasm for space travel and raised government interest, both in the US and USSR.

=== Missile race ===
Soon after the end of World War II, the two former allies became engaged in a state of political conflict and military tension known as the Cold War (1947–1991), which polarized Europe between the Soviet Union&#x27;s satellite states (often referred to as the Eastern Bloc) and the states of the Western world allied with the U.S.

In August 1949, the Soviet Union became the second nuclear power after the United States with the successful RDS-1 nuclear weapon test. In October 1957, the Soviet Union conducted the world&#x27;s first successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), this was the R-7 Semyorka (also known as SS-6 by NATO) and was seen as capable of striking U.S. territory with a nuclear payload. Fears in the US due to this perceived threat became known as the Missile gap. The first American ICBM, the Atlas missile, was tested in late 1958.

ICBMs presented the ability to strike targets on the other side of the globe in a very short amount of time and in a manner which was impervious to air interception such as bombers might have been. The value which ICBMs presented in a nuclear standoff were very substantial, and this fact greatly accelerated efforts to develop rocket and rocket interception technology.

=== Soviet rocket development ===


The first Soviet development of artillery rockets was in 1921 when the Soviet military sanctioned the Gas Dynamics Laboratory, a small research laboratory to explore solid-fuel rockets, led by Nikolai Tikhomirov, who had begun studying solid and liquid-fueled rockets in 1894, and obtained a patent in 1915 for &quot;self-propelled aerial and water-surface mines. The first test-firing of a solid fuel rocket was carried out in 1928.

Further development was carried out in the 1930s by the Group for the Study of Reactive Motion (GIRD), where Soviet rocket pioneers Sergey Korolev, Friedrich Zander, Mikhail Tikhonravov and Leonid Dushkin launched GIRD-X, the first Soviet liquid-fueled rocket in 1933. In 1933 the two design bureaus were combined into the Reactive Scientific Research Institute and produced the RP-318, the USSR&#x27;s first rocket-powered aircraft and the RS-82 and RS-132 missiles, which became the basis for the Katyusha multiple rocket launcher, During the 1930s Soviet rocket technology was comparable to Germany&#x27;s, but Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge from 1936 to 1938 severely damaged its progress.

In 1945 the Soviets captured several key Nazi German A-4 (V-2) rocket production facilities, and also gained the services of some German scientists and engineers related to the project. A-4s were assembled and studied and the experience derived from assembling and launching A4 rockets was directly applied to the Soviet copy, called the R-1, with NII-88 chief designer Sergei Korolev overseeing the R-1&#x27;s development., The R-1 entered into service in the Soviet Army on 28 November 1950. By the latter half of 1946, Korolev and rocket engineer Valentin Glushko had, with extensive input from German engineers, outlined a successor to the R-1, the R-2 with an extended frame and a new engine designed by Glushko, which entered service in November, 1951, with a range of , twice that of the R-1. This was followed in 1951 with the development of the R-5 Pobeda, the Soviet Union&#x27;s first real strategic missile, with a range of and capable of carrying a 1 megaton (mt) thermonuclear warhead. The R-5 entered service in 1955. Scientific versions of the R-1, R-2 and R-5 undertook various experiments between 1949 and 1958, including flights with space dogs.

Design work began in 1953 on the R-7 Semyorka with the requirement for a missile with a launch mass of 170 to 200 tons, range of 8,500 km and carrying a nuclear warhead, powerful enough to launch a nuclear warhead against the United States. In late 1953 the warhead&#x27;s mass was increased to 5.5 to 6 tons to accommodate the then planned theromonuclear bomb. The R-7 was designed in a two-stage configuration, with four boosters that would jettison when empty. On the 21 August 1957 the R-7 flew , and became the worlds&#x27;s first intercontinental ballistic missile. Two months later the R-7 launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, into orbit, and became the basis for the R-7 family which includes Sputnik, Luna, Molniya, Vostok, and Voskhod space launchers, as well as later Soyuz variants. Several versions are still in use and it has become the world&#x27;s most reliable space launcher.

=== American rocket development ===

Although American rocket pioneer Robert H. Goddard developed, patented, and flew small liquid-propellant rockets as early as 1914, the United States was the only one of the three major allied World War II powers to not have its own rocket program, until Von Braun and his engineers were expatriated from Nazi Germany in 1945. The US acquired a large number of V-2 rockets and recruited von Braun and most of his engineering team in Operation Paperclip. The team was sent to the Army&#x27;s White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico, in 1945. They set about assembling the captured V-2s and began a program of launching them and instructing American engineers in their operation. These tests led to the first photos of Earth from space, and the first two-stage rocket, the WAC Corporal-V-2 combination, in 1949. The German rocket team was moved from Fort Bliss to the Army&#x27;s new Redstone Arsenal, located in Huntsville, Alabama, in 1950. From here, von Braun and his team developed the Army&#x27;s first operational medium-range ballistic missile, the Redstone rocket, derivatives of which launched both America&#x27;s first satellite, and the first piloted Mercury space missions. It became the basis for both the Jupiter and Saturn family of rockets.

Each of the United States armed services had its own ICBM development program. The Air Force began ICBM research in 1945 with the MX-774. In 1950, von Braun began testing the Air Force PGM-11 Redstone rocket family at Cape Canaveral. By 1957, a descendant of the Air Force MX-774 received top-priority funding. and evolved into the Atlas-A, the first successful American ICBM. The Atlas made use of a thin stainless steel fuel tank which relied on the internal pressure of the tank for structural integrity, this allowed an overall lighter weight design. WD-40 was developed to prevent rust on the Atlas rockets so that rust protecting paint could be avoided, to further reduce weight.

A later variant of the Atlas, the Atlas-D, served as a nuclear ICBM and as the orbital launch vehicle for Project Mercury and the remote-controlled Agena Target Vehicle used in Project Gemini.

==ICBM capability, satellites, lunar probes (1955–1960)==
The period from 1955 to 1960 saw the first artificial satellites put into earth orbit by both the USSR and the US, the first animals sent into orbit, and the first robotic probes to impact and flyby the Moon by the Soviets.

===Artificial satellite development===
In 1955, with both the United States and the Soviet Union building ballistic missiles that could be used to launch objects into space, the stage was set for nationalistic competition. On July 29, 1955, James C. Hagerty, President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s press secretary, announced that the United States intended to launch &quot;small Earth circling satellites&quot; between July 1, 1957, and December 31, 1958, as part of the US contribution to the International Geophysical Year (IGY). On August 2, at the Sixth Congress of the International Astronautical Federation in Copenhagen, scientist Leonid I. Sedov told international reporters at the Soviet embassy of his country&#x27;s intention to launch a satellite as well, in the &quot;near future&quot;.

==== Soviet secrecy and obfuscation ====
On August 30, 1955, Sergei Korolev succeeded in convincing the Soviet Academy of Sciences to establish a commission dedicated to achieving the goal of launching a satellite into Earth orbit before the United States, this can be viewed as the &quot;de facto&quot; start date of the space race. The Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union began a policy of treating development of its space program as top-secret. When the Sputnik project was first approved, one of the immediate courses of action the Politburo took was to consider what to announce to the world regarding their event. The Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) established precedents for all official announcements on the Soviet space program. The information eventually released did not offer details on who built and launched the satellite or why it was launched.

The Soviet space program&#x27;s use of secrecy served as both a tool to prevent the leaking of classified information between countries, and to avoid revealing specifics to the Soviet populace in regards to their short and long term goals; the program&#x27;s nature embodied ambiguous messages concerning its goals, successes, and values. Launches were not announced until they took place, cosmonaut names were not released until they flew, and outside observers did not know the size or shape of their rockets or cabins of most of their spaceships, except for the first Sputniks, lunar probes, and Venus probe.

The Soviet military maintained control over the space program; Korolev&#x27;s OKB-1 design bureau was subordinated under the Ministry of General Machine Building, tasked with the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, and continued to give its assets random identifiers into the 1960s. Information about failures was systematically withheld, historian James Andrews notes that Soviet media coverage of the space program, particularly human space missions, rarely reported any failures or difficulties, creating the impression of a flawless operation:&quot;With almost no exceptions, coverage of Soviet space exploits, especially in the case of human space missions, omitted reports of failure or trouble&quot;.Dominic Phelan noted in the book &quot;Cold War Space Sleuths&quot; (Springer-Praxis 2013): &quot;The USSR was famously described by Winston Churchill as &quot;&#x27;a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma&quot;&#x27; and nothing signified this more than the search for the truth behind its space program during the Cold War. Although the Space Race was literally played out above our heads, it was often obscured by a figurative &#x27;space curtain&#x27; that took much effort to see through&quot;.

==== US concerns and strategy ====
Initially, President Eisenhower was worried that a satellite passing above a nation at over might be seen as violating that nation&#x27;s airspace. He was concerned that the Soviet Union would accuse the Americans of an illegal overflight, thereby scoring a propaganda victory at his expense. Eisenhower and his advisors were of the opinion that a nation&#x27;s airspace sovereignty did not extend past the Kármán line, and they used the 1957–58 International Geophysical Year launches to establish this principle in international law. Eisenhower also feared that he might cause an international incident and be called a &quot;warmonger&quot; if he were to use military missiles as launchers. Therefore, he selected the untried Naval Research Laboratory&#x27;s Vanguard rocket, which was a research-only rocket. This meant that von Braun&#x27;s team was not allowed to put a satellite into orbit with their Jupiter-C rocket, because of its intended use as a future military vehicle. On September 20, 1956, von Braun and his team did launch a Jupiter-C that was capable of putting a satellite into orbit, but the launch was used only as a suborbital test of reentry vehicle technology.

=== Sputnik ===

Korolev received word about von Braun&#x27;s 1956 Jupiter-C test and, mistakenly thinking it was a satellite mission that failed, expedited plans to get his own satellite in orbit. Since the R-7 was substantially more powerful than any of the US launch vehicles, he made sure to take full advantage of this capability by designing Object D as his primary satellite. It was given the designation &#x27;D&#x27;, to distinguish it from other R-7 payload designations &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;V&#x27;, and &#x27;G&#x27; which were nuclear weapon payloads. Object D dwarfed the proposed US satellites, having a weight of , of which would be composed of scientific instruments that would photograph the Earth, take readings on radiation levels, and check on the planet&#x27;s magnetic field. However, things were not going along well with the design and manufacturing of the satellite, so in February 1957, Korolev sought and received permission from the Council of Ministers to build a &quot;Prosteishy Sputnik&quot; (PS-1), or simple satellite. The council also decreed that Object D be postponed until April 1958. The new &quot;Sputnik&quot; was a metallic sphere that would be a much lighter craft, weighing and having a diameter. The satellite would not contain the complex instrumentation that Object D had, but had two radio transmitters operating on different short wave radio frequencies, the ability to detect if a meteoroid were to penetrate its pressure hull, and the ability to detect the density of the Earth&#x27;s thermosphere.

Korolev was buoyed by the first successful launches of the R-7 rocket in August and September, which paved the way for the launch of &quot;Sputnik&quot;. Word came that the US was planning to announce a major breakthrough at an International Geophysical Year conference at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington D.C., with a paper titled &quot;Satellite Over the Planet&quot;, on October 6, 1957. Korolev anticipated that von Braun might launch a Jupiter-C with a satellite payload on or around October 4 or 5, in conjunction with the paper. He hastened the launch, moving it to October 4. The launch vehicle for PS-1 was a modified R-7 – vehicle 8K71PS number M1-PS – without much of the test equipment and radio gear that was present in the previous launches. It arrived at the Soviet missile base Tyura-Tam in September and was prepared for its mission at launch site number one.

The first launch took place on Friday, October 4, 1957, at exactly 10:28:34 pm Moscow time, with the R-7 and the now named Sputnik 1 satellite lifting off the launch pad and placing the artificial &quot;moon&quot; into an orbit a few minutes later. This &quot;fellow traveler&quot;, as the name is translated in English, was a small, beeping ball, less than two feet in diameter and weighing less than 200 pounds. But the celebrations were muted at the launch control center until the down-range far east tracking station at Kamchatka received the first distinctive beep ... beep ... beep sounds from &quot;Sputnik 1&quot;″s radio transmitters, indicating that it was on its way to completing its first orbit. About 95 minutes after launch, the satellite flew over its launch site, and its radio signals were picked up by the engineers and military personnel at Tyura-Tam: that&#x27;s when Korolev and his team celebrated the first successful artificial satellite placed into Earth-orbit.

The next satellite sent by the Soviets after Sputnik 1 was Sputnik 2, launched on November 3, 1957, just a month later. This would put the first animal into orbit.

=== US reaction to Sputnik ===
==== CIA assessment ====
At the latest, the successful start of Sputnik 2 with the satellite weighing more than 500 kg proved that the USSR had achieved a leading advantage in rocket technology. The CIA, initially astonished, estimated the launch weight of the rocket at 500 metric tons, requiring an initial thrust exceeding 1,000 tons, and assumed the use of a three-stage rocket. In a classified report, the agency described the event as a &quot;stupendous scientific achievement&quot; and concluded that the USSR had likely perfected an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of accurately targeting any location. In reality, the launch weight of the Soviet rocket was 267 metric tons with an initial thrust of 410 tons with one and a half stages. The CIA&#x27;s misjudgement was caused by extrapolating the parameters of the US Atlas rocket developed at the same time (launch weight 82 tons, initial thrust 135 tones, maximum payload of 70 kg for low Earth orbit). In part, the favourable data of the Soviet launcher was based on concepts proposed by the German rocket scientists headed by Helmut Gröttrup on Gorodomlya Island, such as, among other things, the rigorous weight saving, the control of the residual fuel quantities and a reduced thrust to weight relation of 1.4 instead of usual factor 2. The CIA had heard about such details already in January 1954 when it interrogated Göttrup after his return from the USSR but did not take him seriously.

==== US reactions ====
The Soviet success raised a great deal of concern in the United States. For example, economist Bernard Baruch wrote in an open letter titled &quot;The Lessons of Defeat&quot; to the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;: &quot;While we devote our industrial and technological power to producing new model automobiles and more gadgets, the Soviet Union is conquering space. ... It is Russia, not the United States, who has had the imagination to hitch its wagon to the stars and the skill to reach for the moon and all but grasp it. America is worried. It should be.&quot;

Eisenhower ordered project Vanguard to move up its timetable and launch its satellite much sooner than originally planned. The December 6, 1957 Project Vanguard launch failure occurred at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. It was a monumental failure, exploding a few seconds after launch, and it became an international joke. The satellite appeared in newspapers under the names Flopnik, Stayputnik, Kaputnik, and Dudnik. In the United Nations, the Soviet delegate offered the US representative aid &quot;under the Soviet program of technical assistance to backwards nations.&quot; Only in the wake of this very public failure did von Braun&#x27;s Redstone team get the go-ahead to launch their Jupiter-C rocket as soon as they could. In Britain, the US&#x27;s Western Cold War ally, the reaction was mixed: some celebrated the fact that the Soviets had reached space first, while others feared the destructive potential that military uses of spacecraft might bring. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; predicted that the US would catch up to and pass the USSR in space; &quot;never doubt for a moment that America would be successful&quot;.

=== Explorer ===
On January 31, 1958, nearly four months after the launch of &quot;Sputnik 1&quot;, von Braun and the United States successfully launched its first satellite on a four-stage Juno I rocket derived from the US Army&#x27;s Redstone missile, at Cape Canaveral. The satellite &quot;Explorer 1&quot; was in mass. The payload of Explorer 1 weighed . It carried a micrometeorite gauge and a Geiger-Müller tube. It passed in and out of the Earth-encompassing radiation belt with its orbit, therefore saturating the tube&#x27;s capacity and proving what Dr. James Van Allen, a space scientist at the University of Iowa, had theorized. The belt, named the Van Allen radiation belt, is a doughnut-shaped zone of high-level radiation intensity around the Earth above the magnetic equator. Van Allen was also the man who designed and built the satellite instrumentation of &quot;Explorer 1&quot;. The satellite measured three phenomena: cosmic ray and radiation levels, the temperature in the spacecraft, and the frequency of collisions with micrometeorites. The satellite had no memory for data storage, therefore it had to transmit continuously. The next successful mission was Explorer 3, launched later that month (March 26, 1958), which carried similar scientific instruments and successfully recorded cosmic ray data.

==== Creation of NASA ====
On April 2, 1958, President Eisenhower reacted to the Soviet space lead in launching the first satellite by recommending to the US Congress that a civilian agency be established to direct nonmilitary space activities. Congress, led by Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, responded by passing the National Aeronautics and Space Act, which Eisenhower signed into law on July 29, 1958. This law turned the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). It also created a Civilian-Military Liaison Committee, appointed by the President, responsible for coordinating the nation&#x27;s civilian and military space programs.

On October 21, 1959, Eisenhower approved the transfer of the Army&#x27;s remaining space-related activities to NASA. On July 1, 1960, the Redstone Arsenal became NASA&#x27;s George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, with von Braun as its first director. Development of the Saturn rocket family, which when mature gave the US parity with the Soviets in terms of lifting capability, was thus transferred to NASA.

=== First mammals in space ===

The US and the USSR sent animals into space to determine the safety of the environment before sending the first humans. The USSR used dogs for this purpose, and the US used monkeys and apes. The first mammal in space was Albert II, a rhesus monkey launched by the US on a sub-orbital flight on June 14, 1949, who died on landing due to a parachute malfunction.

The USSR sent the dog Laika into orbit on Sputnik 2, the second satellite launched, on November 3, 1957, for an intended ten-day flight. They did not yet have the technology to return Laika safely to Earth, and the government reported Laika died when the oxygen ran out, but in October 2002 her true cause of death was reported as stress and overheating on the fourth orbit due to failure of the air conditioning system. At a Moscow press conference in 1998 Oleg Gazenko, a senior Soviet scientist involved in the project, stated &quot;The more time passes, the more I&#x27;m sorry about it. We did not learn enough from the mission to justify the death of the dog...&quot;.

===Early lunar probes===

In 1958, Korolev upgraded the R-7 to be able to launch a payload to the Moon. The Luna program began with three failed secret 1958 attempts to launch Luna E-1-class impactor probes. The fourth attempt, Luna 1, launched successfully on January 2, 1959, but missed the Moon. The fifth attempt on June 18 also failed at launch. The Luna 2 successfully impacted the Moon on September 14, 1959. The Luna 3 successfully flew by the Moon and sent back pictures of its far side on October 7, 1959.

The US first embarked on the Pioneer program in 1958 by launching the first probe, albeit ending in failure. A subsequent probe named Pioneer 1 was launched with the intention of orbiting the Moon only to result in a partial mission success when it reached an apogee of 113,800 km before falling back to Earth. The missions of Pioneer 2 and Pioneer 3 failed whereas Pioneer 4 had one partially successful lunar flyby in March 1959.

== Human spaceflight, space treaties, interplanetary probes (1961–1968) ==
The period from 1961 to 1968 began with the first men sent to space, the first robotic explorations of other planets; with missions to Venus and Mars conducted by both the Soviet Union and the United States, robotic landings on the Moon, and the gestation of US ambition to land a man on the moon. The 60s saw significant advancements in crewed spaceflight by both cold war adversaries, as well as the first nuclear detonation in space, research into anti-satellite technology, and the signing of historic international outer space treaties.

===First humans in space===
====Vostok====


The Soviets designed their first human space capsule using the same spacecraft bus as their Zenit spy satellite, forcing them to keep the details and true appearance secret until after the Vostok program was over. The craft consisted of a spherical descent module with a mass of and a diameter of , with a cylindrical inner cabin housing the cosmonaut, instruments, and escape system; and a biconic instrument module with a mass of , long and in diameter, containing the engine system and propellant. After reentry, the cosmonaut would eject at about over the USSR and descend via parachute, while the capsule would land separately, because the descent module made an extremely rough landing that could have left a cosmonaut seriously injured. The &quot;Vostok spaceship&quot; was first displayed at the July 1961 Tushino air show, mounted on its launch vehicle&#x27;s third stage, with the nose cone in place concealing the spherical capsule. A tail section with eight fins was added in an apparent attempt to confuse western observers. This also appeared on official commemorative stamps and a documentary. The Soviets finally revealed the true appearance of their Vostok capsule at the April 1965 Moscow Economic Exhibition.

On April 12, 1961, the USSR surprised the world by launching Yuri Gagarin into a single, 108-minute orbit around the Earth in a craft called Vostok 1. They dubbed Gagarin the first cosmonaut, roughly translated from Russian and Greek as &quot;sailor of the universe&quot;. Gagarin&#x27;s capsule was flown in automatic mode, since doctors did not know what would happen to a human in the weightlessness of space; but Gagarin was given an envelope containing the code that would unlock manual control in an emergency.

Gagarin became a national hero of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, and a worldwide celebrity. Moscow and other cities in the USSR held mass demonstrations, the scale of which was second only to the World War II Victory Parade of 1945. April 12 was declared Cosmonautics Day in the USSR, and is celebrated today in Russia as one of the official &quot;Commemorative Dates of Russia.&quot; In 2011, it was declared the International Day of Human Space Flight by the United Nations.

The USSR demonstrated 24-hour launch pad turnaround and launched two piloted spacecraft, Vostok 3 and Vostok 4, in essentially identical orbits, on August 11 and 12, 1962. The two spacecraft came within approximately of one another, close enough for radio communication, but then drifted as far apart as . The Vostok had no maneuvering rockets to keep the two craft a controlled distance apart. Vostok 4 also set a record of nearly four days in space. The first woman, Valentina Tereshkova, was launched into space on Vostok 6 on June 16, 1963, as (possibly) a medical experiment. She was the only one to fly of a small group of female parachutist factory workers (unlike the male cosmonauts who were military test pilots), chosen by the head of cosmonaut training because he read a tabloid article about the &quot;Mercury 13&quot; group of women wanting to become astronauts, and got the mistaken idea that NASA was actually entertaining this. Five months after her flight, Tereshkova married Vostok 3 cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolayev, and they had a daughter.

====Mercury====


The US Air Force had been developing a program to launch the first man in space, named Man in Space Soonest. This program studied several different types of one-man space vehicles, settling on a ballistic re-entry capsule launched on a derivative Atlas missile, and selecting a group of nine candidate pilots. After NASA&#x27;s creation, the program was transferred over to the civilian agency&#x27;s Space Task Group and renamed Project Mercury on November 26, 1958. The Mercury spacecraft was designed by the STG&#x27;s chief engineer Maxime Faget. NASA selected a new group of astronaut (from the Greek for &quot;star sailor&quot;) candidates from Navy, Air Force and Marine test pilots, and narrowed this down to a group of seven for the program. Capsule design and astronaut training began immediately, working toward preliminary suborbital flights on the Redstone missile, followed by orbital flights on the Atlas. Each flight series would first start unpiloted, then carry a non-human primate, then finally humans.

The Mercury spacecraft&#x27;s principal designer was Maxime Faget, who started research for human spaceflight during the time of the NACA. It consisted of a conical capsule with a cylindrical pack of three solid-fuel retro-rockets strapped over a beryllium or fiberglass heat shield on the blunt end. Base diameter at the blunt end was and length was ; with the launch escape system added, the overall length was . With of habitable volume, the capsule was just large enough for a single astronaut. The first suborbital spacecraft weighed ; the heaviest, Mercury-Atlas 9, weighed fully loaded. On reentry, the astronaut would stay in the craft through splashdown by parachute in the Atlantic Ocean.

On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American in space, launching in a ballistic trajectory on Mercury-Redstone 3, in a spacecraft he named &quot;Freedom 7&quot;. Though he did not achieve orbit like Gagarin, he was the first person to exercise manual control over his spacecraft&#x27;s attitude and retro-rocket firing. After his successful return, Shepard was celebrated as a national hero, honored with parades in Washington, New York and Los Angeles, and received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President John F. Kennedy.

American Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom repeated Shepard&#x27;s suborbital flight in &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; on July 21, 1961. Almost a year after the Soviet Union put a human into orbit, astronaut John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth, on February 20, 1962. His Mercury-Atlas 6 mission completed three orbits in the &quot;Friendship 7&quot; spacecraft, and splashed down safely in the Atlantic Ocean, after a tense reentry, due to what falsely appeared from the telemetry data to be a loose heat-shield. On February 23, 1962, President Kennedy awarded Glenn with the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in a ceremony at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. As the first American in orbit, Glenn became a national hero, and received a ticker-tape parade in New York City, reminiscent of that given for Charles Lindbergh.

The United States launched three more Mercury flights after Glenn&#x27;s: &quot;Aurora 7&quot; on May 24, 1962, duplicated Glenn&#x27;s three orbits, &quot;Sigma 7&quot; on October 3, 1962, six orbits, and &quot;Faith 7&quot; on May 15, 1963, 22 orbits (32.4 hours), the maximum capability of the spacecraft. NASA at first intended to launch one more mission, extending the spacecraft&#x27;s endurance to three days, but since this would not beat the Soviet record, it was decided instead to concentrate on developing Project Gemini.

===Kennedy aims for a crewed Moon landing===

Before Gagarin&#x27;s flight, US President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s support for America&#x27;s piloted space program was lukewarm. Jerome Wiesner of MIT, who served as a science advisor to presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, and himself an opponent of sending humans into space, remarked, &quot;If Kennedy could have opted out of a big space program without hurting the country in his judgment, he would have.&quot; As late as March 1961, when NASA administrator James E. Webb submitted a budget request to fund a Moon landing before 1970, Kennedy rejected it because it was simply too expensive. Some were surprised by Kennedy&#x27;s eventual support of NASA and the space program because of how often he had attacked the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s inefficiency during the election.

Gagarin&#x27;s flight changed this; now Kennedy sensed the humiliation and fear on the part of the American public over the Soviet lead. Additionally, the Bay of Pigs invasion, planned before his term began but executed during it, was an embarrassment to his administration due to the colossal failure of the US forces. Looking for something to save political face, he sent a memo dated April 20, 1961, to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, asking him to look into the state of America&#x27;s space program, and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up. The two major options at the time were either the establishment of an Earth orbital space station or a crewed landing on the Moon. Johnson, in turn, consulted with von Braun, who answered Kennedy&#x27;s questions based on his estimates of US and Soviet rocket lifting capability. Based on this, Johnson responded to Kennedy, concluding that much more was needed to reach a position of leadership, and recommending that the crewed Moon landing was far enough in the future that the US had a fighting chance to achieve it first.

Kennedy ultimately decided to pursue what became the Apollo program, and on May 25 took the opportunity to ask for Congressional support in a Cold War speech titled &quot;Special Message on Urgent National Needs&quot;. 
He justified the program in terms of its importance to national security, and its focus of the nation&#x27;s energies on other scientific and social fields. He rallied popular support for the program in his &quot;We choose to go to the Moon&quot; speech, on September 12, 1962, before a large crowd at Rice University Stadium, in Houston, Texas, near the construction site of the new Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center facility. 

Khrushchev responded to Kennedy&#x27;s challenge with silence, refusing to publicly confirm or deny the Soviets were pursuing a &quot;Moon race&quot;. As later disclosed, the Soviet Union secretly pursued two competing crewed lunar programs. Soviet Decree 655–268, &quot;On Work on the Exploration of the Moon and Mastery of Space&quot;, issued in August 1964, directed Vladimir Chelomei to develop a Moon flyby program with a projected first flight by the end of 1966, and directed Korolev to develop the Moon landing program with a first flight by the end of 1967. In September 1965, Chelomei&#x27;s flyby program was assigned to Korolev, who redesigned the cislunar mission to use his own Soyuz 7K-L1 spacecraft and Chelomei&#x27;s Proton rocket. After Korolev&#x27;s death in January 1966, another government decree of February 1967 moved the first crewed flyby to mid-1967, and the first crewed landing to the end of 1968.

====Proposed joint US-USSR program====
After a first US-USSR Dryden-Blagonravov agreement and cooperation on the Echo II balloon satellite in 1962, President Kennedy proposed on September 20, 1963, in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, that the United States and the Soviet Union join forces in an effort to reach the Moon. Kennedy thus changed his mind regarding the desirability of the space race, preferring instead to ease tensions with the Soviet Union by cooperating on projects such as a joint lunar landing. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev initially rejected Kennedy&#x27;s proposal. However, on October 2, 1997, it was reported that Khrushchev&#x27;s son Sergei claimed Khrushchev was poised to accept Kennedy&#x27;s proposal at the time of Kennedy&#x27;s assassination on November 22, 1963. During the next few weeks he reportedly concluded that both nations might realize cost benefits and technological gains from a joint venture, and decided to accept Kennedy&#x27;s offer based on a measure of rapport during their years as leaders of the world&#x27;s two superpowers, but changed his mind and dropped the idea since he lacked the same trust for Kennedy&#x27;s successor, Lyndon Johnson.

Some cooperation in robotic space exploration nevertheless did take place, such as a combined &quot;Venera 4&quot;–&quot;Mariner 5&quot; data analysis under a joint Soviet–American working group of COSPAR in 1969, allowing a more complete drawing of the profile of the atmosphere of Venus. Eventually the Apollo-Soyuz mission was realized afterall, which furthermore laid the foundations for the Shuttle-Mir program and the ISS.

As President, Johnson steadfastly pursued the Gemini and Apollo programs, promoting them as Kennedy&#x27;s legacy to the American public. One week after Kennedy&#x27;s death, he issued renaming the Cape Canaveral and Apollo launch facilities after Kennedy.

=== Lunar probes and robotic landers ===

The Ranger program, started in 1959 by NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, aimed to conduct hard impacts on the moon and had its first success in 1962, after 3 failures due to launch aborts (Ranger 1 and Ranger 2) and a failure to reach the moon (Ranger 3), when the Ranger 4 became the first US spacecraft to reach the Moon, but its solar panels and navigational system failed near the Moon and it impacted the far side without returning any scientific data. Ranger 5 ran out of power and missed the Moon by on October 21, 1962. The first successful Ranger mission was the Block III Ranger 7 which impacted on July 31, 1964. Ranger had three successful impacts out of nine attempts.

In 1963, the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;2nd Generation&quot; Luna programme was less successful than the earlier Luna probes; Luna 4, Luna 5, Luna 6, Luna 7, and Luna 8 were all met with mission failures. However, in 1966 the Luna 9 achieved the first soft-landing on the Moon, and successfully transmitted photography from the surface. Luna 10 marked the first man-made object to establish an orbit around the Moon, followed by Luna 11, Luna 12, and Luna 14 which also successfully established orbits. Luna 12 was able to transmit detailed photography of the surface from orbit. Luna 10, 12, and Luna 14 conducted Gamma ray spectrometry of the Moon, among other tests.

The Zond programme was orchestrated alongside the &quot;Luna&quot; programme with Zond 1 and Zond 2 launching in 1964, intended as flyby missions, however both failed. Zond 3 however was successful, and transmitted high quality photography from the far side of the moon.

Partly to aid the Apollo missions, the Surveyor program was conducted by NASA, with five successful soft landings out of seven attempts from 1966 to 1968. The Lunar Orbiter program had five successes out of five attempts in 1966–1967.

In late 1966, Luna 13 became the third spacecraft to make a soft-landing on the Moon, with the American Surveyor 1 having now taken second. Luna 13 made use of inflatable air-bags to soften it&#x27;s landing. Surveyor 1 was a 995 kg lander, notably larger than the 112 kg Luna 13 E-6M lander. Surveyor 1 was equipped with a Doppler velocity sensing system that fed information into the spacecraft computer to implement a controllable descent to the surface. Each of the three landing pads also carried aircraft-type shock absorbers and strain gauges to provide data on landing characteristics, important for future Apollo missions.

Surveyor 3, which successfully touched down on the Moon April 20, 1967, carried a &#x27;surface sampler&#x27; which facilitated tests of the Lunar soil. Based on these experiments, scientists concluded that lunar soil had a consistency similar to wet sand, with a bearing strength of about 10 pounds per square inch (0.7 kilograms per square centimeter, or 98 kilopascals), which was concluded to be solid enough to support an Apollo Lunar Module. The Surveyor 3 lander would be later visited by Apollo 12 astronauts.

On Nov. 17, 1967, before mission termination, Surveyor 6 fired its thrusters for 2.5 seconds, becoming the first spacecraft launched from the lunar surface. It rose about 10 feet (3 meters) before landing 8 feet (2.5 meters) west of its original spot. Cameras then examined the original landing site to assess the soil&#x27;s properties.

=== First interplanetary probes ===
From the early 60s both cold war adversaries almost simultaneously initiated their own programmes which sought to reach other planets in the solar system for the first time; namely Venus and Mars.

==== Venus ====
Venus was of great interest in the field of planetary science due to its thick and opaque atmosphere, the atmospheres of other planets being a novel area of research at the time.

In 1961 the Venera Programme was initiated by the Soviet Union, with the launch of Venera 1. The programme would go on to mark many firsts in the exploration of another planet. Despite the later successes however, Venera 1 and Venera 2, intended to flyby Venus, resulted in failure due to losses of contact.

NASA would then initiate the Mariner program with the launch of Mariner 1 and Mariner 2. Mariner 1 failed shortly after launch, however Mariner 2 would become the first man-made object to flyby another Planet in December 1962 when the probe passed by Venus.

Later in 1965/66, Venera 3, marked the first time a man-made object made contact with another planet after it impacted Venus on March 1, 1966, despite operational difficulties resulting in loss of contact with the craft.

In 1967, Mariner 5 flew by Venus and conducted atmospheric analysis.

==== Mars ====
In 1964, NASA&#x27;s Mariner 4 became the first successful Mars flyby, transmitting 21 pictures of the planets surface. This was followed by Mariner 6 and 7 in 1969.

===First crewed spacecraft===
Focused by the commitment to a Moon landing, in January 1962 the US announced Project Gemini, a two-person spacecraft that would support the later three-person Apollo by developing the key spaceflight technologies of space rendezvous and docking of two craft, flight durations of sufficient length to go to the Moon and back, and extra-vehicular activity to perform work outside the spacecraft.

Meanwhile, Korolev had planned further long-term missions for the Vostok spacecraft, and had four Vostoks in various stages of fabrication in late 1963 at his OKB-1 facilities. The Americans&#x27; announced plans for Gemini represented major advances over the Mercury and Vostok capsules, and Korolev felt the need to try to beat the Americans to many of these innovations. He had already begun designing the Vostok&#x27;s replacement, the next-generation Soyuz, a multi-cosmonaut spacecraft that had at least the same capabilities as the Gemini spacecraft. Soyuz would not be available for at least three years, and it could not be called upon to deal with this new American challenge in 1964 or 1965. Political pressure in early 1964which some sources claim was from Khrushchev while other sources claim was from other Communist Party officialspushed him to modify his four remaining Vostoks to beat the Americans to new space firsts in the size of flight crews, and the duration of missions.

====Voskhod====


Korolev&#x27;s conversion of his surplus Vostok capsules to the Voskhod spacecraft allowed the Soviet space program to beat the Gemini program in achieving the first spaceflight with a multi-person crew, and the first &quot;spacewalk&quot;. Gemini took a year longer than planned to make its first flight, so Voskhod 1 became the first spaceflight with a three-person crew on October 12, 1964. The USSR touted another &quot;technological achievement&quot; during this mission: it was the first space flight during which cosmonauts performed in a shirt-sleeve-environment. However, flying without spacesuits was not due to safety improvements in the Soviet spacecraft&#x27;s environmental systems; rather this was because the craft&#x27;s limited cabin space did not allow for spacesuits. Flying without spacesuits exposed the cosmonauts to significant risk in the event of potentially fatal cabin depressurization. This was not repeated until the US Apollo Command Module flew in 1968; the command module cabin was designed to transport three astronauts in a low pressure, pure oxygen shirt-sleeve environment while in space.

On March 18, 1965, about a week before the first piloted Project Gemini space flight, the USSR launched the two-cosmonaut Voskhod 2 mission with Pavel Belyayev and Alexei Leonov. Voskhod 2&#x27;s design modifications included the addition of an inflatable airlock to allow for extravehicular activity (EVA), also known as a spacewalk, while keeping the cabin pressurized so that the capsule&#x27;s electronics would not overheat. Leonov performed the first-ever EVA as part of the mission. A fatality was narrowly avoided when Leonov&#x27;s spacesuit expanded in the vacuum of space, preventing him from re-entering the airlock. To overcome this, he had to partially depressurize his spacesuit to a potentially dangerous level. He succeeded in safely re-entering the spacecraft, but he and Belyayev faced further challenges when the spacecraft&#x27;s atmospheric controls flooded the cabin with 45% pure oxygen, which had to be lowered to acceptable levels before re-entry. The reentry involved two more challenges: an improperly timed retrorocket firing caused the Voskhod 2 to land off its designated target area, the city of Perm; and the instrument compartment&#x27;s failure to detach from the descent apparatus caused the spacecraft to become unstable during reentry.

By October 16, 1964, Leonid Brezhnev and a small cadre of high-ranking Communist Party officials deposed Khrushchev as Soviet government leader a day after Voskhod 1 landed, in what was called the &quot;Wednesday conspiracy&quot;.
The new political leaders, along with Korolev, ended the technologically troublesome Voskhod program, canceling Voskhod 3 and 4, which were in the planning stages, and started concentrating on reaching the Moon. Voskhod 2 ended up being Korolev&#x27;s final achievement before his death on January 14, 1966, as it became the last of the space firsts that the USSR achieved during the early 1960s. According to historian Asif Siddiqi, Korolev&#x27;s accomplishments marked &quot;the absolute zenith of the Soviet space program, one never, ever attained since.&quot; There was a two-year pause in Soviet piloted space flights while Voskhod&#x27;s replacement, the Soyuz spacecraft, was designed and developed.

==== Gemini ====


Though delayed a year to reach its first flight, Gemini was able to take advantage of the USSR&#x27;s two-year hiatus after Voskhod, which enabled the US to catch up and surpass the previous Soviet superiority in piloted spaceflight. Gemini had ten crewed missions between March 1965 and November 1966: Gemini 3, Gemini 4, Gemini 5, Gemini 6A, Gemini 7, Gemini 8, Gemini 9A, Gemini 10, Gemini 11, and Gemini 12; and accomplished the following:

* Every mission demonstrated the ability to adjust the crafts&#x27; inclination and apsis without issue.
* Gemini 5 demonstrated eight-day endurance, long enough for a round trip to the Moon. Gemini 7 demonstrated a fourteen-day endurance flight.
* Gemini 6A demonstrated rendezvous and station-keeping with Gemini 7 for three consecutive orbits at distances as close as . Gemini 9A also achieved rendezvous with an Agena Target Vehicle (ATV).
* Rendezvous and docking with the ATV was achieved on Gemini 8, 10, 11, and 12. Gemini 11 achieved the first direct-ascent rendezvous with its Agena target on the first orbit.
*Extravehicular activity (EVA) was perfected through increasing practice on Gemini 4, 9A, 10, 11, and 12. On Gemini 12, Edwin &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin spent over five hours working comfortably during three (EVA) sessions, finally proving that humans could perform productive tasks outside their spacecraft.
* Gemini 10, 11, and 12 used the ATV&#x27;s engine to make large changes in its orbit while docked. Gemini 11 used the Agena&#x27;s rocket to achieve a crewed Earth orbit record apogee of .

Gemini 8 experienced the first in-space mission abort on March 17, 1966, just after achieving the world&#x27;s first docking, when a stuck or shorted thruster sent the craft into an uncontrolled spin. Command pilot Neil Armstrong was able to shut off the stuck thruster and stop the spin by using the re-entry control system. He and his crewmate David Scott landed and were recovered safely.

Most of the novice pilots on the early missions would command the later missions. In this way, Project Gemini built up spaceflight experience for the pool of astronauts for the Apollo lunar missions. With the completion of Gemini, the US had demonstrated many of the key technologies necessary to make Kennedy&#x27;s goal of landing a man on the Moon, namely crewed spacecraft docking, with the exception of developing a large enough launch vehicle.

===Soviet crewed Moon programs===


Korolev&#x27;s design bureau produced two prospectuses for circumlunar spaceflight (March 1962 and May 1963), the main spacecraft for which were early versions of his Soyuz design. At the same time, another bureau, OKB-52, headed by Vladimir Chelomey, was developing the LK-1 lunar flyby spacecraft, which would be launched by Chelomey&#x27;s Proton UR-500 rocket. The Soviet government rejected Korolev&#x27;s proposals, opting to support Chelomey&#x27;s project, who gained favor with Khrushchev by employing his son.

Officially, the Soviet lunar program was established on August 3, 1964, with the adoption of Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Command 655-268 (&quot;On Work on the Exploration of the Moon and Mastery of Space&quot;). The circumlunar flights were planned to occur in 1967, and the landings to start in 1968, intending to land a person on the Moon before the Apollo flights. Both of the bureaus submitted their projects for a crewed lunar landing.

Korolev&#x27;s lunar landing program was designated N1/L3, for its N1 super rocket and a more advanced Soyuz 7K-L3 spacecraft, also known as the lunar orbital module (&quot;&quot;Lunniy Orbitalny Korabl&quot;, LOK), with a crew of two. A separate lunar lander (&quot;Lunniy Korabl&quot;&quot;, LK), would carry a single cosmonaut to the lunar surface.

The N1/L3 launch vehicle had three stages to Earth orbit, a fourth stage for Earth departure, and a fifth stage for lunar landing assist. The combined space vehicle was roughly the same height and takeoff mass as the three-stage US Apollo-Saturn V and exceeded its takeoff thrust by 28% (45,400 kN vs. 33,000 kN. The N1/3L was never successfully tested, the first flight suffered a fire in the first-stage Block A due to a loose bolt, leading to a catastrophic explosion 70 seconds into the flight. Further variations of the N1 had similar catastrophic results in testing. If successful, the N1 would have been capable of carrying a 95 metric tons payload into low earth orbit. The Saturn V comparatively used liquid hydrogen fuel in its two upper stages, and carried a 140.6 metric tons payload to orbit, enough for a three-person orbiter and two-person lander.

Chelomey&#x27;s program assumed using a direct ascent lander based on the LK-1, LK-700, which would be launched using his proposed UR-700 rocket. Following Khrushchev&#x27;s ouster from power, Chelomey lost his support in the Soviet government, and his proposal didn&#x27;t receive any funding. Additionally, in August 1965, due to Korolev&#x27;s opposition, work on the LK-1 was suspended, and later stopped completely. As a replacement, the circumlunar mission would use a stripped-down Soyuz 7K-L1 &quot;Zond&quot;, while still retaining the Proton UR-500 booster. To fit two crewmembers, the Zond had to omit the Soyuz orbital module, sacrificing equipment for habitable cabin volume.

=== Outer space treaties ===

The US and USSR began discussions on the peaceful uses of space as early as 1958, presenting issues for debate to the United Nations, which created a Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in 1959.

On May 10, 1962, Vice President Johnson addressed the Second National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space revealing that the United States and the USSR both supported a resolution passed by the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly in December 1962, which not only urged member nations to &quot;extend the rules of international law to outer space,&quot; but to also cooperate in its exploration. Following the passing of this resolution, Kennedy commenced his communications proposing a cooperative American and Soviet space program.

In 1963, the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed by more than 100 signatories, including both the United States and the Soviet Union. This treaty followed the US test of a nuclear bomb detonated in outer space the year earlier called Starfish Prime.

The UN ultimately created a &quot;Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies&quot;, which was signed by the United States, the USSR, and the United Kingdom on January 27, 1967, and came into force the following October 10.
This treaty:
* bars party States from placing weapons of mass destruction in Earth orbit, on the Moon, or any other celestial body;
* exclusively limits the use of the Moon and other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes, and expressly prohibits their use for testing weapons of any kind, conducting military maneuvers, or establishing military bases, installations, and fortifications;
* declares that the exploration of outer space shall be done to benefit all countries and shall be free for exploration and use by all the States;
* explicitly forbids any government from claiming a celestial resource such as the Moon or a planet, claiming that they are the common heritage of mankind, &quot;not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means&quot;. However, the State that launches a space object retains jurisdiction and control over that object;
* holds any State liable for damages caused by their space object;
* declares that &quot;the activities of non-governmental entities in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty&quot;, and &quot;States Parties shall bear international responsibility for national space activities whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities&quot;; and
* &quot;A State Party to the Treaty which has reason to believe that an activity or experiment planned by another State Party in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, would cause potentially harmful interference with activities in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, may request consultation concerning the activity or experiment.&quot;

The treaty remains in force, signed by 107 member states. – 

=== Anti-Satellite research ===

==== Istrebitel-sputnikov ====

In November 1968, dismay gripped the United States Central Intelligence Agency when a successful satellite destruction simulation was successfully orchestrated by the Soviet Union. As a part of the Istrebitel Sputnikov anti-satellite weapons research programme, the Kosmos 248 Soviet satellite was successfully destroyed by Kosmos 252 which was able to intercept within the 5 km &#x27;kill radius&#x27; and destroyed Kosmos 248 by detonating its onboard warhead. This wasn&#x27;t the beginning of the programme, years earlier intercept attempts had begun with maneuvering test of the Polyot satellites in 1964.

==== SAINT ====
Possibly as a response to the Soviet programme, the United States began Project SAINT, which was intended to provide anti-satellite capability to be used in the case of war with the Soviet Union. However, less is known about the mission profiles of this project compared to the Soviet programme, and the project was cancelled early on due to budget constraints.

===Disaster strikes both sides===
In 1967, both nations&#x27; space programs faced serious challenges that brought them to temporary halts.

====Apollo 1====

On January 27, 1967, the same day the US and USSR signed the Outer Space Treaty, the crew of the first crewed Apollo mission, Command Pilot Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom, Senior Pilot Ed White, and Pilot Roger Chaffee, were killed in a fire that swept through their spacecraft cabin during a ground test, less than a month before the planned February 21 launch. An investigative board determined the fire was probably caused by an electrical spark and quickly grew out of control, fed by the spacecraft&#x27;s atmosphere of pure oxygen at greater than one standard atmosphere. Crew escape was made impossible by inability to open the plug door hatch cover against the internal pressure. The board also found design and construction flaws in the spacecraft, and procedural failings, including failure to appreciate the hazard of the pure-oxygen atmosphere, as well as inadequate safety procedures. All these flaws had to be corrected over the next twenty-two months until the first piloted flight could be made.
Mercury and Gemini veteran Grissom had been a favored choice of Deke Slayton, NASA&#x27;s Director of Flight Crew Operations, to make the first piloted landing.

==== Soyuz 1 ====


On April 24, 1967, the single pilot of Soyuz 1, Vladimir Komarov, became the first in-flight spaceflight fatality. The mission was planned to be a three-day test, to include the first Soviet docking with an unpiloted Soyuz 2, but the mission was plagued with problems. Problems began shortly after launch when one solar panel failed to unfold, leading to a shortage of power for the spacecraft&#x27;s systems. Further problems with the orientation detectors complicated maneuvering the craft. By orbit 13, the automatic stabilisation system was completely dead, and the manual system was only partially effective. The mission was aborted, Soyuz 1 fired its retrorockets and reentered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. During the emergency re-entry, a fault in the landing parachute system caused the primary chute to fail, and the reserve chute became tangled with the drogue chute, causing descent speed to reach as high as 40 m/s (140 km/h; 89 mph). Shortly thereafter, Soyuz 1 impacted the ground 3 km (1.9 mi) west of Karabutak, and was found on fire. The official autopsy states Komarov died of blunt force trauma on impact. In the US during subsequent years, stories began circulating that in his last transmissions Komarov cursed the engineers and flight staff as he descended, or even that he cursed the Soviet leadership, and that these transmissions were received by an NSA listening station near Istanbul. This would contradict Soviet records of the radio transcripts, and historians such as Asif Azam Siddiqi and Robert Pearlman regard these claims to be fabrications.

=== Both programs recover ===

The United States recovered from the Apollo 1 fire, fixing the fatal flaws in an improved version of the Block II command module. The US proceeded with unpiloted test launches of the Saturn V launch vehicle (Apollo 4 and Apollo 6) and the Lunar Module (Apollo 5) during the latter half of 1967 and early 1968. The first Saturn V flight was an unqualified success, and although the second suffered some non-catastrophic engine failures, it was considered a partial success and the launcher achieved human rating qualification. Apollo 1&#x27;s mission to check out the Apollo Command and Service Module in Earth orbit was accomplished by Grissom&#x27;s backup crew on Apollo 7, launched on October 11, 1968. The eleven-day mission was a total success, as the spacecraft performed a virtually flawless mission, paving the way for the United States to continue with its lunar mission schedule.

The Soviet Union also fixed the parachute and control problems with Soyuz, and the next piloted mission Soyuz 3 was launched on October 26, 1968. The goal was to complete Komarov&#x27;s rendezvous and docking mission with the un-piloted Soyuz 2. Ground controllers brought the two craft to within of each other, then cosmonaut Georgy Beregovoy took control. He got within of his target, but was unable to dock before expending 90 percent of his maneuvering fuel, due to a piloting error that put his spacecraft into the wrong orientation and forced Soyuz 2 to automatically turn away from his approaching craft. The first docking of Soviet spacecraft was finally realized in January 1969 by the Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 missions. It was the first-ever docking of two crewed spacecraft, and the first transfer of crew from one space vehicle to another.

The Soviet Zond spacecraft was not yet ready for piloted circumlunar missions in 1968, after six unsuccessful automated test launches: Kosmos 146 on March 10, 1967; Kosmos 154 on April 8, 1967; Zond 1967A on September 28, 1967; Zond 1967B on November 22, 1967; Zond 1968A on April 23, 1968; and Zond 1968B in July 1968. Zond 4 was launched on March 2, 1968, and successfully made a circumlunar flight, but encountered problems with its Earth reentry on March 9, and was ordered destroyed by an explosive charge over the Gulf of Guinea. The Soviet official announcement said that Zond 4 was an automated test flight which ended with its intentional destruction, due to its recovery trajectory positioning it over the Atlantic Ocean instead of over the USSR.

During the summer of 1968, the Apollo program hit another snag: the first pilot-rated Lunar Module (LM) was not ready for orbital tests in time for a December 1968 launch. NASA planners overcame this challenge by changing the mission flight order, delaying the first LM flight until March 1969, and sending Apollo 8 into lunar orbit without the LM in December. This mission was in part motivated by intelligence rumors the Soviet Union might be ready for a piloted Zond flight in late 1968. In September 1968, Zond 5 made a circumlunar flight with tortoises on board and returned safely to Earth, accomplishing the first successful water landing of the Soviet space program in the Indian Ocean. It also scared NASA planners, as it took them several days to figure out that it was only an automated flight, not piloted, because voice recordings were transmitted from the craft en route to the Moon. On November 10, 1968, another automated test flight, Zond 6, was launched. It encountered difficulties in Earth reentry, and depressurized and deployed its parachute too early, causing it to crash-land only from where it had been launched six days earlier. It turned out there was no chance of a piloted Soviet circumlunar flight during 1968, due to the unreliability of the Zonds.

On December 21, 1968, Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders became the first humans to ride the Saturn V rocket into space, on Apollo 8. They also became the first to leave low-Earth orbit and go to another celestial body, entering lunar orbit on December 24. They made ten orbits in twenty hours, and transmitted one of the most watched TV broadcasts in history, with their Christmas Eve program from lunar orbit, which concluded with a reading from the biblical Book of Genesis. Two and a half hours after the broadcast, they fired their engine to perform the first trans-Earth injection to leave lunar orbit and return to the Earth. Apollo 8 safely landed in the Pacific Ocean on December 27, in NASA&#x27;s first dawn splashdown and recovery.

The American Lunar Module was finally ready for a successful piloted test flight in low Earth orbit on Apollo 9 in March 1969. The next mission, Apollo 10, conducted a &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for the first landing in May 1969, flying the LM in lunar orbit as close as above the surface, the point where the powered descent to the surface would begin. With the LM proven to work well, the next step was to attempt the landing.

Unknown to the Americans, the Soviet Moon program was in deep trouble. After two successive launch failures of the N1 rocket in 1969, Soviet plans for a piloted landing suffered delay. The launch pad explosion of the N-1 on July 3, 1969, was a significant setback. The rocket hit the pad after an engine shutdown, destroying itself and the launch facility. Without the N-1 rocket, the USSR could not send a large enough payload to the Moon to land a human and return him safely.

== Men on the Moon, space stations, space shuttles (1969–1991) ==
The latter period of the space race began with the United States landing the first men on the moon, and was followed by the Soviets operating the first space stations and putting the first robotic landers on Venus and Mars, the US space shuttles marking the first significant reusable space vehicles, and a cooling down of tensions with the first docking between a Soviet and American vessel.

=== First humans on the Moon ===


Apollo 11 was prepared with the goal of a July landing in the Sea of Tranquility, just half a year after the first crewed flight to the Moon. The crew, selected in January 1969, consisted of commander (CDR) Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot (CMP) Michael Collins, and Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) Edwin &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin. They trained for the mission until just before the launch day. On July 16, 1969, at 9:32 am EDT, the Saturn V rocket, AS-506, lifted off from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 in Florida.

The trip to the Moon took just over three days. After achieving orbit, Armstrong and Aldrin transferred into the Lunar Module named &quot;Eagle&quot;, leaving Collins in the Command and Service Module &quot;Columbia&quot;, and began their descent. Despite the interruption of alarms from an overloaded computer caused by an antenna switch left in the wrong position, Armstrong took over manual flight control at about to correct a slight downrange guidance error, and set the &quot;Eagle&quot; down on a safe landing spot at 20:18:04 UTC, July 20, 1969 (3:17:04 pm CDT). Six hours later, at 02:56 UTC, July 21 (9:56 pm CDT July 20), Armstrong left the &quot;Eagle&quot; to become the first human to set foot on the Moon.

The first step was witnessed on live television by at least one-fifth of the population of Earth, or about 723 million people. His first words when he stepped off the LM&#x27;s landing footpad were, &quot;That&#x27;s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.&quot; Aldrin joined him on the surface almost 20 minutes later. Altogether, they spent just under two and one-quarter hours outside their craft. The next day, they performed the first crewed launch from another celestial body, and rendezvoused back with Collins in &quot;Columbia&quot;. But before they return ascended the Space Race came to a particular culmination. Few days before Apollo 11 left Earth the Soviet Union launched the Luna 15 probe, entering lunar orbit just before Apollo 11 and eventually sharing it with Apollo 11. Aware of Luna 15, Apollo 8 astronaut Frank Borman was asked to use his goodwill contacts in the Soviet Union to prevent any collision. Subsequently, in one of the first instances of Soviet–American space communication the Soviet Union released Luna 15&#x27;s flight plan to ensure it would not collide with Apollo 11, although its exact mission was not publicized. But as Apollo 11 was wrapping up surface activities, the Soviet mission command hastened Luna 15 and attempted its robotic sample-return mission before Apollo 11 would return. As Luna 15 descended just two hours before Apollo 11&#x27;s launch and impacted at 15:50 UTC some hundred kilometers away from Apollo 11, British astronomers monitoring Luna 15 recorded the situation, with one commenting:“I say, this has really been drama of the highest order”.

Apollo 11 left lunar orbit and returned to Earth, landing safely in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969. When the spacecraft splashed down, 2,982 days had passed since Kennedy&#x27;s commitment to landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth before the end of the decade; the mission was completed with 161 days to spare. With the safe completion of the Apollo 11 mission, the Americans won the race to the Moon.

Armstrong and his crew became worldwide celebrities, feted with ticker-tape parades on August 13 in New York City and Chicago, attended by an estimated six million. That evening in Los Angeles they were honored at an official state dinner attended by members of Congress, 44 governors, the Chief Justice of the United States, and ambassadors from 83 nations. The President and Vice president presented each astronaut with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The astronauts spoke before a joint session of Congress on September 16, 1969. This began a 38-day world tour to 22 foreign countries and included visits with the leaders of many countries.

The public&#x27;s reaction in the Soviet Union was mixed. The Soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing, which affected the reaction. A portion of the populace did not give it any attention, and another portion was angered by it.

The first landing was followed by another, precision landing on Apollo 12 in November 1969, within walking distance of the Surveyor 3 spacecraft which landed on April 20, 1967.

In total the Apollo programme involved six crewed Moon landings from 1969 to 1972, and a total of twelve astronauts walked on the surface of the Moon. These were Apollo 11, Apollo 12, Apollo 14, Apollo 15, Apollo 16, and Apollo 17.

==== Post-Apollo NASA: Shifting goals and budget cuts ====
NASA had ambitious follow-on human spaceflight plans as it reached its lunar goal but soon discovered it had expended most of its political capital to do so. A victim of its own success, Apollo had achieved its first landing goal with enough spacecraft and Saturn V launchers left for a total of ten lunar landings through Apollo 20, conducting extended-duration missions and transporting the landing crews in Lunar Roving Vehicles on the last five. NASA also planned an Apollo Applications Program (AAP) to develop a longer-duration Earth orbital workshop (later named &quot;Skylab&quot;) from a spent S-IVB upper stage, to be constructed in orbit using several launches of the smaller Saturn IB launch vehicle.

In February 1969, President Richard M. Nixon convened a &quot;space task group&quot; to set recommendations for the future US civilian space program, headed by his vice president, Spiro T. Agnew. Agnew was an enthusiastic proponent of NASA&#x27;s follow-up plans for permanent space stations in Earth and lunar orbit, perhaps a base on the lunar surface, and the first human flight to Mars as early as 1986 or as late as 2000. These would be serviced by an infrastructure of a reusable Space Transportation System, including an Earth-to-orbit Space Shuttle. Nixon had a &#x27;better sense&#x27; of the declining political support in Congress for new Apollo-style programs, which had disappeared with the achievement of the landing, and he intended to pursue détente with the USSR and China, which he hoped might ease Cold War tensions. He cut the spending proposal he sent to Congress to include funding for only the Space Shuttle, with perhaps an option to pursue the Earth orbital space station for the foreseeable future.

AAP planners decided the Earth orbital workshop could be accomplished more efficiently by prefabricating it on the ground and launching it with a single Saturn V, which immediately eliminated Apollo 20. Budget cuts soon led NASA to cut Apollo 18 and 19 as well. Apollo 13 had to abort its lunar landing in April 1970 due to an in-flight spacecraft failure but returned its crew safely to Earth. The Apollo program made its final lunar landing in December 1972; the two unused Saturn Vs were used as outdoor visitor displays and allowed to deteriorate due to the effects of weathering.

The USSR continued trying to develop its N1 rocket, after two more launch failures in 1971 and 1972, finally canceling it in May 1974, without achieving a single successful uncrewed test flight.

=== Soviet Lunar sample return and robotic rovers ===

In late 1970 Luna 16 was launched by the Soviet Union, and became the first uncrewed probe to return a sample from the Moon. This was followed by Luna 20 and Luna 24 in subsequent years.

The Soviet Union was also able to successfully land the first robotic rover on the moon in 1970, followed by another in 1973, with the Lunokhod missions.

These missions demonstrated continued Soviet willingness to compete with the US in the space race despite having lost the manned moon landing aspect of the space race.

=== Salyut and Skylab ===

Having lost the race to the Moon, the USSR seemed to decide to concentrate on orbital space stations instead of pursuing a crewed lunar mission. During 1969 and 1970, they launched six more Soyuz flights after Soyuz 3 and then launched a series of six successful space stations (plus two failures to achieve orbit and one station rendered uninhabitable due to damage from explosion of the launcher&#x27;s upper stage) on their Proton-K heavy-lift launcher in their Salyut program designed by Kerim Kerimov. Each one weighed between , was long by in diameter, and had a habitable volume of . All of the Salyuts were presented to the public as non-military scientific laboratories, but three of them were covers for military Almaz reconnaissance stations: Salyut 2 (failed), Salyut 3, and Salyut 5.

Salyut 1, the first space station, was launched by the Soviets on April 19, 1971. Three days later, the Soyuz 10 crew attempted to dock with it, but failed to achieve a secure enough connection to safely enter the station. The Soyuz 11 crew of Vladislav Volkov, Georgi Dobrovolski and Viktor Patsayev successfully docked on June 7, and completed a then record 22-day stay. The crew became the second in-flight space fatality during their reentry on June 30, when they were asphyxiated due to the spacecraft&#x27;s cabin becoming depressurized, shortly after undocking. The disaster was blamed on a faulty cabin pressure valve, that allowed the air to vent into space. The crew was not wearing pressure suits and had no chance of survival once the leak occurred. To prevent a recurrence of the Soyuz 11 tragedy, Soviet engineers redesigned the Soyuz spacecraft and mandated that cosmonauts wear Sokol pressure suits during launch and landing, a requirement still in place today.

The United States launched a single orbital workstation, &quot;Skylab&quot;, on May 14, 1973. It was launched using a leftover Saturn-5 rocket from the Apollo programme. Skylab weighed , was long by in diameter, and had a habitable volume of over . &quot;Skylab&quot; was damaged during the ascent to orbit, losing one of its solar panels and a meteoroid thermal shield. Subsequent crewed missions repaired the station, and conducted valuable research. The third and final mission&#x27;s crew, Skylab 4, set a human endurance record (at the time) with 84 days in orbit when the mission ended on February 8, 1974. &quot;Skylab&quot; stayed in orbit another five years before reentering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere over the Indian Ocean and Western Australia on July 11, 1979.

Salyut 4 broke &quot;Skylab&quot;&#x27;s occupation record at 92 days. Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 were second-generation stations designed for long duration, and were occupied for 683 and 816 days. Salyut 7 improved upon earlier designs by allowing long-duration crewed missions and more complex experiments. These stations, with their expanded crew capacity and amenities for long term stay, carrying electric stoves, a refrigerator, and constant hot water.

=== Venus and Mars robotic landings ===

==== Venus landings ====

In 1970, the Soviet Union&#x27;s Venera 7 marked the first time a spacecraft was able to return data after landing on another planet. Venera 7 held a resistant thermometer and an aneroid barometer to measure the temperature and atmospheric pressure on the surface, the transmitted data showed 475 C at the surface, and a pressure of 92 bar.

In 1975, Venera 9 established an orbit around Venus and successfully returned the first photography of the surface of Venus. Venera 10 landed on Venus and followed with further photography shortly after.

NASA initiated the Pioneer Venus project in 1978, successfully deploying four small probes into the Venusian atmosphere on December 9, 1978. The probes confirmed that Venus has little if any magnetic field, and cameras detected lightning in the atmosphere. The last transmissions were received on October 8, 1992, as its decaying orbit no longer permitted communications. The spacecraft burned up the atmosphere soon after, ending a successful 14-year mission that was planned to last only eight months.

In 1981, Venera 13 performed a successful soft-landing on Venus and marked the first probe to drill into the surface of another planet and take a sample. Venera 13 also took an audio sample of the Venusian environment, marking another first. Venera 13 returned the first color images of the surface of Venus, revealing an orange-brown flat bedrock surface covered with loose regolith and small flat thin angular rocks. Venera 14, an identical spacecraft to Venera 13, was launched 5 days apart with a similar mission profile.

In total ten Venera probes achieved a soft landing on the surface of Venus.

In 1984, the Soviet Vega programme began and ended with the launch of two crafts launched six days apart, Vega 1 and Vega 2. Both crafts deployed a balloon in addition to a lander, marking a first in spaceflight.

The US never caught up or matched the Soviet efforts to explore the surface of Venus, but did claim the title of the first successful probe to have flown by the planet and had notable success with the Pioneer atmospheric probes.

==== Mars landings ====
In 1971, the Soviet&#x27;s Mars 2 successfully established Mars orbit and attempted a soft landing but crashed, becoming the first man-made object to impact Mars. This was shortly followed by Mars 3, a 358 kg lander, which successfully landed but the lander only transmitted data for 14.5 seconds before losing contact.

In 1976, NASA followed suit, and put two successful landers on Mars. These were Viking 1 and Viking 2. These landers were significantly larger than the Soviet Mars landers (Viking 1 was 3,527 kilograms). They were able to take the first photographs from the surface of Mars.

Viking 1 operated on the surface of Mars for around six years (On Nov 11, 1982 the Lander stopped operating after getting a faulty command) and Viking 2 for over three years (mission ended in early 1980). Both landers were equipped with a robotic sampler arm which successfully scooped up soil samples and tested them with instruments such as a Gas chromatography–mass spectrometer. The landers measured temperatures ranging from negative 86 degrees Celsius before dawn to negative 33 degrees Celsius in the afternoon. Both landers had issues obtaining accurate results from their seismometers.

Photographs from the landers and orbiters surpassed expectations in quality and quantity. The total exceeded 4,500 from the landers and 52,000 from the orbiters.

The Viking landers recorded atmospheric pressures ranging from below 7 millibars (0.0068 bars) to over 10 millibars (0.0108 bars) over the Martian year, leading to the conclusion that atmospheric pressure varies by 30 percent during the Martian year because carbon dioxide condenses and sublimes at the polar caps. Martian winds generally blow more slowly than expected, scientists had expected them to reach speeds of several hundred miles an hour from observing global dust storms, but neither lander recorded gusts over 120 kilometers (74 miles) an hour, and average velocities were considerably lower. Nevertheless, the orbiters observed more than a dozen small dust storms. The Viking landers detected nitrogen in the atmosphere for the first time, and that it was a significant component of the Martian atmosphere. There was speculation from the atmospheric analysis that the atmosphere of Mars used to be much denser.

The Soviets did not match the Martian lander achievements of NASA, but did claim the title of the first lander.

=== Apollo–Soyuz Test Project ===


In May 1972, President Richard M. Nixon and Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev negotiated an easing of relations known as détente, creating a temporary &quot;thaw&quot; in the Cold War. The two nations planned a joint mission to dock the last US Apollo craft with a Soyuz, known as the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). To prepare, the US designed a docking module for the Apollo that was compatible with the Soviet docking system, which allowed any of their craft to dock with any other (e.g. Soyuz-to-Soyuz as well as Soyuz-to-Salyut). The module was also necessary as an airlock to allow the men to visit each other&#x27;s craft, which had incompatible cabin atmospheres. The USSR used the Soyuz 16 mission in December 1974 to test modifications of the Soyuz atmosphere and the docking adapter to prepare for ASTP.

The joint mission began when Soyuz 19 was first launched on July 15, 1975, at 12:20 UTC, and the Apollo craft was launched with the docking module six and a half hours later. The two craft rendezvoused and docked on July 17 at 16:19 UTC. The three astronauts conducted joint experiments with the two cosmonauts, and the crew shook hands, exchanged gifts, and visited each other&#x27;s craft.

=== Space Shuttles ===

NASA achieved the first approach and landing test of its Space Shuttle orbiter on a Boeing 747 carrier plane on August 12, 1977, and the first orbital test flight of a complete, crewed Space Shuttle, consisting of the orbiter, an external fuel tank, and two solid rocket boosters, on April 12, 1981. The designers underestimated the time and cost of refurbishment between flights, which reduced the cost benefit of its reusability. They also overestimated its safety: two of the fleet of five orbiters were lost in fatal flight accidents: one during launch, due to failure of a solid rocket booster seal; and one on reentry, due to launch damage of a wing heat shield. The Air Force was also supposed to use the Shuttle to launch its military payloads, but shunned it in favor of its expendable launchers after the first Shuttle loss. NASA ceased production of its Apollo spacecraft and Saturn IB launcher, and used the Shuttle as its orbital workhorse until 2011, then retired it due to the safety concern. Originally, more than 150 flights over a 15-year operation were expected; actually, the Shuttles made 135 flights in the 30-year lifespan of the series.

The Soviets interpreted the Shuttle as a military surveillance vehicle, and decided they had to develop their own shuttle, which they named Buran, beginning in 1974. They copied the aerodynamic design of NASA&#x27;s Shuttle orbiter, which they strapped to the side of their expendable, liquid hydrogen-fueled Energia launcher. The Buran could be fitted with four Saturn AL-31 turbofan engines and a fuel tank in its payload bay, allowing it to make its own atmospheric test flights, which began in November 1985. Also unlike the US Shuttle, it could be flown pilotlessly and landed automatically. Energia-Buran made only one orbital test flight in November 1988, but US counterintelligence baited the Soviets with disinformation about the heat shield design, and it was not reusable for repeated flight. Buran was the largest and most expensive Soviet program in the history of the Space Race, and was effectively canceled by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, due to lack of funding. The Energia was also canceled at the same time, after only two flights.

=== First women in space ===
The first woman in space was from the Soviet Union, Valentina Tereshkova. NASA did not welcome female astronauts into its corps until 1978, when six female mission specialists were recruited. This first class included scientist Sally Ride, who became America&#x27;s first woman in space on STS-7 in June 1983. NASA included women mission specialists in the next four astronaut candidate classes, and admitted female pilots starting in 1990. Eileen Collins from this class became the first pilot to fly on Space Shuttle flight STS-63 in February 1995, and the first female commander of a spaceflight on STS-93 in July 1999.

The USSR admitted its first female test pilot as a cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, in 1980. She became the first female to fly since Tereshkova, on Salyut 7 in December 1981.

=== First modular space station ===
The USSR turned its space program to the development of the low Earth orbit modular space station &quot;Mir&quot; (&quot;peace&quot; or &quot;world&quot;) assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996. At , it held records for the largest spacecraft and the longest continuous human presence in space at 3,644 days, until the International Space Station was built starting in 1998. &quot;Mir&quot;&#x27;s operation continued after the 1991 replacement of the USSR&#x27;s space program with the Russian Federal Space Agency until 2001, supported by Soyuz spacecraft.

== Analysis and reception ==

=== Who &quot;Won&quot; the Space Race? ===
The question of who won the Space Race has sparked considerable debate among historians and analysts. The United States is widely seen as the victor due to the Apollo crewed landing and moonwalk missions, which achieved President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s ambitious goal of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth by the end of the 1960s. This achievement, completed in July 1969, marked the pinnacle of U.S. space exploration efforts of the time and was regarded by most observers as the culmination of the Space Race. Political scientist Richard J. Samuels describes Apollo 11 as a &quot;decisive American victory.&quot;

The Moon race is often analyzed as a microcosm of the Space Race&#x27;s broader dynamics, historians such as Jennifer Frost argue that if the Space Race is measured in terms of overall spaceflight capability, the Soviet Union &quot;won it hands down.&quot; Asif A. Siddiqi, a noted space historian, provides a more nuanced view, emphasizing the Soviet Union&#x27;s dominance in smaller aspects of the race to the moon, yet critical, benchmarks such as the first lunar impact, first photos of the Moon&#x27;s far side, first soft lunar landing, and first lunar orbit. These accomplishments laid the groundwork for lunar exploration, though they are often overshadowed by the Apollo 11 mission.Before that landing [Apollo 11], there was an enormous amount of investment in the robotic exploration of the Moon, both by the Soviets and the US, in terms of all sorts of smaller benchmarks like the first lunar impact, the first pictures of the far side of the Moon, the first soft lunar landing, and the first lunar orbit. We forget, but in those little races, the Soviet Union dominated almost every benchmark, but it is forgotten as the United States won the big one.

=== Historians&#x27; analysis ===
The Space Race was deeply intertwined with Cold War rivalries and reflected broader ideological contests between the United States and the Soviet Union.

* Walter McDougall highlights how space exploration served as a demonstration of each superpower&#x27;s political and technological systems, with the U.S. emphasizing transparency and democratic values, and the USSR showcasing the capabilities of its centralized, state-driven model.
* Asif A. Siddiqi stresses the importance of viewing the Space Race as more than a single-event competition. He notes that while the U.S. achieved the symbolic &quot;big one&quot; with the Apollo missions, the Soviet Union&#x27;s early and sustained achievements in robotic lunar and interplanetary exploration reveal the broader, multi-faceted nature of the rivalry.

These interpretations suggest that while the U.S. achieved a definitive symbolic victory, the competition was more complex than often acknowledged.

=== Public reception ===
The Space Race captivated global audiences and became a cultural symbol of human ingenuity.

* United States: Kennedy&#x27;s challenge galvanized public support, and the Apollo program became a unifying force. Apollo 11, watched by an estimated 600 million people globally, remains a defining moment in U.S. history. However, public enthusiasm waned to some extent as priorities shifted in the post-Moon landing era.
* Global Perspective: International audiences often viewed the Space Race as a testament to human progress rather than a purely geopolitical contest. It inspired space programs worldwide, particularly in Europe, Japan, and India.

== Legacy ==
After the end of the Cold War in 1991, the assets of the USSR&#x27;s space program passed mainly to Russia. Since then, the United States and Russia have cooperated in space with the Shuttle-&quot;Mir&quot; Program, and the International Space Station (ISS). The Russians continue to use their R-7 rocket family as their orbital workhorse to launch the Soyuz crewed spacecraft and its Progress derivative uncrewed cargo craft as shuttles to the ISS. After the 2011 retirement of the Space Shuttle, American crews were dependent on the R-7–Soyuz to reach the ISS, until the 2020 first flight of the US Crew Dragon Commercial Crew Development vehicle.

In 2023 the Russian Federation resumed the &quot;Luna&quot; missions as a part of the Luna-Glob programme with the launch of Luna 25 (47 years after the Soviet Luna 24), amidst American reignition of interest in the Moon with the Artemis program beginning with the launch of Artemis I in 2022.

<text>Peeps are a marshmallow confection marketed since 1953 in the United States and Canada in the shape of chicks, bunnies, and other animals, as well as holiday shapes, with themes revolving around Halloween, Christmas, and Easter, produced by Pennsylvania-headquartered Just Born.

Originally promoted primarily at Easter, Peeps have subsequently been marketed as &quot;Always in Season&quot;, and have expanded to Halloween, Christmas and Valentine&#x27;s Day. Since 2014 the confection has been available year-round with the introduction of Peeps Minis.

Peeps ingredients include sugar, corn syrup, gelatin, food dyes and salt.

==History==

Peeps are produced by Just Born, a candy manufacturer founded in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, by an immigrant from Vinnitsa in the Russian Empire (now in Ukraine), Sam Born (1891–1959).

In 1953, Just Born acquired the Rodda Candy Company and its marshmallow chick line. Sam&#x27;s son, Bob Born, replaced the painstaking process of hand-forming the chicks with mass production in 1954. When founder Sam Born displayed a sign for his freshly made candy, he titled it &quot;Just Born&quot;, playing off of his last name and the fact that he made his candy fresh daily. According to Mary Bellis, the newly purchased company, Just Born, was soon the &quot;largest marshmallow candy manufacturer in the world.&quot;

Just Born began producing other shapes in the 1960s, following seasonal themes. Twenty years later, the Marshmallow Peeps Bunny was released as a popular year-round shape of the candy. The yellow chicks were the original form of the candy — hence their name — but then the company introduced other colors and, eventually, the myriad shapes that are now produced. Peeps were manufactured in different colors, such as lavender starting in 1995 and blue in 1998. Prior to that, they were only being produced in the traditional colors: yellow, pink and white. New flavors such as vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate were introduced between the years of 1999 and 2002.

In 2003, the Peeps Fun Bus conducted a tour across the country to promote the brand. The tour included giveaways and games and was decorated with a giant Peep on the top of the bus.

In 2009, Just Born expanded the Peeps product line further by introducing Peeps Lip Balm in four flavors: grape, strawberry, vanilla, and cotton candy. Just Born has come out with several other various accessories. Items such as nail polish, wrist bands, umbrellas, plush toys, golf gloves, earrings, and necklaces are produced and sold online and in retail stores. Other companies have produced items based on the popular Peeps candy. Peeps micro bead pillows were made by Kaboodle and conform to one&#x27;s shape. The company Kaboodle promises that &quot;they&#x27;ll last a lot longer than their edible counterpart!&quot; Ranging from infant sizes to adult sizes, Peeps Halloween costumes can also be found on the shelves of several costume stores. The first Peeps &amp; Co. store opened in November 2009 in National Harbor, Maryland, Prince George&#x27;s County. Peeps &amp; Company retail stores were later opened in Minnesota (as of 2019, shut down due to low profits) and Pennsylvania. In 2014, Peeps Minis were introduced, and were intended to be available year-round.

In 2023, Bob Born, a son of the Just Born founder, died at age 98. He was known as the &quot;Father of Peeps&quot; for automating the production of Peeps.
==Contests and competitions==

A &quot;Peeps Eating&quot; contest is held each year at National Harbor in front of the Peeps &amp; Company store. The 2017 winner, Matt Stonie of California, ate 255 Peeps in five minutes. The first such event was arranged by Shawn Sparks in 1994, and had only six participants. Dave Smith started an annual Peep Off in Sacramento after contacting a participant in the first Peep Off. Another contest in Maryland asks that participants create a diorama of a culturally important scene from the modern era, featuring a number of Peeps. The winner gets two free inflatable life jackets.

Several newspapers hold annual contests in which readers submit photos of dioramas featuring Peeps. The &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot; was the first paper to hold such a contest. Similar contests are put on by The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and the &quot;Seattle Times&quot;. These contests frequently correspond with the Easter holiday. MIT also has a yearly Peeps contest. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; held an annual contest until 2017, when it was discontinued. The smaller &quot;Washington City Paper&quot; introduced their contest in its place.

The Racine Art Museum holds the Annual International Peeps Art Exhibition each April. Anyone can enter the contest, centered on the theme &quot;peep-powered work of art&quot;.

The following are other contests held in various states. Peeps jousting consists of putting two Marshmallow Chicks into the microwave and seeing which one gets the biggest and therefore affects/deforms the other. &quot;Peepza&quot; is a dessert pizza made with Peeps. Also, blogs were created according to Fox News entitled &quot;101 Fun Ways to Torture a Peep.&quot;

==Alleged indestructibility==
Peeps are sometimes jokingly described as &quot;indestructible&quot;. In 1999 scientists at Emory University jokingly performed experiments on batches of Peeps to see how easily they could be dissolved, burned or otherwise disintegrated, using such agents as cigarette smoke, boiling water and liquid nitrogen. In addition to discussing whether Peeps migrate or evolve, they claimed that the eyes of the confectionery &quot;wouldn&#x27;t dissolve in anything&quot;. One website claims that Peeps are insoluble in acetone, water, diluted sulfuric acid, and sodium hydroxide (the site also claims that the Peeps experimental subjects sign release forms). Concentrated sulfuric acid seems to have effects similar to the expected effects of sulfuric acid on sugar.

This debate featured in an episode of the sitcom &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; (&quot;Traffic Jam&quot;), in which Francis, insisting the &quot;Quacks&quot; (as they were called) would dissolve in his stomach rather than expand, takes up the dare to eat 100 of them and does so, but gets very sick in the process.

When exposed to air, marshmallow dehydrates and becomes &quot;stale&quot; and slightly crunchy. According to Just Born, 25%–30% of their customers prefer eating Peeps stale.

==Public relations==
Barry Church, a football player for the Dallas Cowboys, was unable to attend training camp due to an unexpected root canal caused by eating Jolly Ranchers. Just Born offered Church a season&#x27;s supply of their product—in that marshmallows are a lot softer on the teeth.

==Recipes using Peeps==

Several recipes and creative ideas to alter Peeps have been invented. &quot;Fox News Magazine&quot; published an article in 2013 including several recipes from various creators, including Peeps smores, Peeps pancakes, home-made chocolate covered Peeps, Peeps marshmallow chocolate chip cookies, Peeps brownies, Peeps popcorn, Peeps frosting, Peeps Krispie Treats, and Peeps syrup.

Peeps can also be used as a marshmallow topper for hot chocolate.

A recipe for &quot;Peepshi&quot; involves placing a Peep onto a Rice Krispie Treat and wrapping it in a Fruit by the Foot, to create a single &quot;Peepshi roll&quot; in the style of a sushi roll.

In April 2017, several internet and Twitter postings, and TV news stories claimed &#x27;outrage&#x27; that Peeps were being used as a pizza topping.

In March 2021, Just Born and Pepsico (maker of Pepsi products) announced a &quot;limited edition&quot; of &quot;Peeps marshmallow cola&quot; soft drinks.

==Film adaptation==
On April 22, 2014, Adam Rifkin acquired the feature film and TV rights to the classic candies to make a franchise of it. Then, on April 5, 2021, it was announced that Wonder Street has acquired the rights to the candies with David Goldblum writing and producing alongside Christine and Mark Holder. The film&#x27;s plot centered around a ragtag group of Peeps characters who set out on a cross-country journey in order to attend Peepsfest, an annual brand celebration in Pennsylvania.

<doc id="84241" wikidata="Q272198" url="?curid=84241" title="Marshmallow">
<text>Marshmallow (, ) is a confectionery made from sugar, water and gelatin whipped to a solid-but-soft consistency. It is used as a filling in baking or molded into shapes and coated with corn starch. This sugar confection is inspired by a medicinal confection made from &quot;Althaea officinalis&quot;, the marsh-mallow plant.

== History ==

The word &quot;marshmallow&quot; comes from the mallow plant species (&quot;Althaea officinalis&quot;), a wetland weed native to parts of Europe, North Africa, and Asia that grows in marshes and other damp areas. The plant&#x27;s stem and leaves are fleshy, and its white flower has five petals. It is not known exactly when marshmallows were invented, but their history goes back as early as . Ancient Egyptians were said to be the first to make and use the root of the plant to soothe coughs and sore throats and to heal wounds. The first marshmallows were prepared by boiling pieces of root pulp with honey until thick. Once thickened, the mixture was strained, cooled, then used as intended.

Whether used for candy or medicine, the manufacture of marshmallows was limited to a small scale. In the early to mid 19th century, the marshmallow had made its way to France, where confectioners augmented the plant&#x27;s traditional medicinal value. Owners of small confectionary stores would whip the sap from the mallow root into a fluffy candy mold. This candy, called Pâte de Guimauve, was a spongy-soft dessert made from whipping dried marshmallow roots with sugar, water, and egg whites. It was sold in bar form as a lozenge. Drying and preparation of the marshmallow took one to two days before the final product was produced. In the late 19th century, candy makers started looking for a new process and discovered the starch mogul system, in which trays of modified corn starch had a mold firmly pushed down in them to create cavities within the starch. The cavities were then filled with the whipped marshmallow sap mixture and allowed to cool or harden. At the same time, candy makers began to replace the mallow root with gelatin, which created a stable form of marshmallow.

By the early 20th century, thanks to the starch mogul system, marshmallows were available for mass consumption. In the United States they were sold in tins as penny candy and used in a variety of food recipes like banana fluff, lime mallow sponge, and tutti frutti. In 1956, Alex Doumak patented the extrusion process that involved running marshmallow ingredients through tubes. The tubes created a long rope of marshmallow mixture and were then set out to cool. The ingredients were then cut into equal pieces and packaged.

Modern marshmallow manufacturing is highly automated and has been since the early 1950s when the extrusion process was first developed. Numerous improvements and advancements allow for the production of thousands of pounds of marshmallow a day. Today, the marshmallow typically consists of four ingredients: sugar, water, air, and a whipping agent.

== Ingredients ==
Marshmallows consist of four ingredients: sugar, water, air, and a whipping agent/aerator (usually a protein). The type of sugar and whipping agent varies depending on desired characteristics. Each ingredient plays a specific role in the final product.

The marshmallow is a foam, consisting of an aqueous continuous phase and a gaseous dispersed phase (in other words, a liquid with gas bubbles spread throughout). In addition to being a foam, this also makes marshmallows an &quot;aerated&quot; confection because it is made up of 50% air. The goal of an aerated confection like a marshmallow is to incorporate gas into a sugar mixture, and stabilize the aerated product before the gas can escape. When the gas is introduced into the system, tiny air bubbles are created. This is what contributes to the unique textural properties and mouth-feel of this product.

=== Protein ===
In marshmallows, proteins are the main surface-active agents responsible for the formation, and stabilization of the dispersed air. Due to their structure, surface-active molecules gather at the surface area of a portion of (water-based) liquid. A portion of each protein molecule is hydrophilic, with a polar charge, and another portion is hydrophobic and non-polar. The non-polar section has little or no affinity for water, and so this section orients as far away from the water as possible. However, the polar section is attracted to the water and has little or no affinity for the air. Therefore, the molecule orients with the polar section in the water, with the non-polar section in the air. Two primary proteins that are commonly used as aerators in marshmallows are albumen (egg whites) and gelatin.

==== Albumen (egg whites) ====
Albumen is a mixture of proteins found in egg whites and is utilized for its capacity to create foams. In a commercialized setting, dried albumen is used as opposed to fresh egg whites. In addition to convenience, the advantages of using dried albumen are an increase in food safety and the reduction of water content in the marshmallow. Fresh egg whites carry a higher risk of &quot;Salmonella,&quot; and are approximately 90 percent water. This is undesirable for the shelf life and firmness of the product. For artisan-type marshmallows, prepared by a candy maker, fresh egg whites are usually used. Albumen is rarely used on its own when incorporated into modern marshmallows, and instead is used in conjunction with gelatin.

==== Gelatin ====
Gelatin is the aerator most often used in the production of marshmallows. It is made up of collagen, a structural protein derived from animal skin, connective tissue, and bones. Not only can it stabilize foams, like albumen, but when combined with water it forms a thermally-reversible gel. This means that gelatin can melt, then reset due to its sensitivity to temperature. The melting point of gelatin gel is around , which is just below normal body temperature (around ). This is what contributes to the &quot;melt-in-your-mouth&quot; sensation when a marshmallow is consumed—it actually starts to melt when it touches the tongue.

During preparation, the temperature needs to be just above the melting point of the gelatin, so that as soon as it is formed it cools quickly, and the gelatin sets, retaining the desired shape. If the marshmallow rope mixture exiting the extruder during processing is too warm, the marshmallow starts to flow before the gelatin sets. Instead of a round marshmallow, it takes on a more oval form. Excessive heat can also degrade, or break down, the gelatin itself. Therefore, when marshmallows are being produced at home or by artisan candy makers, the gelatin is added after the syrup has been heated and cooled down.

In commercial operations, the gelatin is simply cooked with the sugar syrup, rather than being added later after the syrup has cooled. In this case, kinetics play an important role, with both time and temperature factoring in. If the gelatin was added at the beginning of a batch that was then cooked to 112–116 °C in 20–30 minutes, a significant amount of gelatin would break down. The marshmallow would have reduced springiness from that loss of gelatin. But since the time the syrup spends at elevated temperature in modern cookers is so short, there is little to no degradation of the gelatin.

In terms of texture, and mouth-feel, gelatin makes marshmallows chewy by forming a tangled 3-D network of polymer chains. Once gelatin is dissolved in warm water (dubbed the &quot;blooming stage&quot;), it forms a dispersion, which results in a cross-linking of its helix-shaped chains. The linkages in the gelatin protein network trap air in the marshmallow mixture and immobilize the water molecules in the network. The result is the well-known spongy structure of marshmallows. This is why the omission of gelatin from a marshmallow recipe results in marshmallow creme, since there is no gelatin network to trap the water and air bubbles.

=== Sugars ===
A traditional marshmallow might contain about 60% corn syrup, 30% sugar, and 1–2% gelatin. A combination of different sugars is used to control the solubility of the solution. The corn syrup/sugar ratio influences the texture by slowing crystallization of the sucrose. The smooth texture of marshmallows relies on disordered, or amorphous, sugar molecules. In contrast, increasing the sugar ratio to about 60–65% produces a grainy marshmallow. Temperature also plays an important role in producing smooth marshmallows by reducing the time window for ordered crystals to form. To ensure the sugars are disordered, the sugar syrup solution is heated to a high temperature and then cooled rapidly.

==== Sugarcane and sugar beet ====
Sugarcane and sugar beet are the two primary sources of sugar, consisting of sucrose molecules. Sucrose is a disaccharide that consists of one glucose and fructose molecule. This sugar provides sweetness and bulk to the marshmallow, while simultaneously setting the foam to a firm consistency as it cools. Sucrose, and sugars in general, impair the ability of a foam to form, but improve foam stability. Therefore, sucrose is used in conjunction with a protein like gelatin. The protein can adsorb, unfold, and form a stable network, while the sugar can increase the viscosity. Liquid drainage of the continuous phase must be minimized as well. Thick liquids drain more slowly than thin ones, and so increasing the viscosity of the continuous phase reduces drainage. A high viscosity is essential if a stable foam is to be produced. Therefore, sucrose is a main component of marshmallow. But sucrose is seldom used on its own, because of its tendency to crystallize.

==== Corn syrup ====
Corn syrup, derived from maize, contains glucose, maltose, and other oligosaccharides. Corn syrup can be obtained from the partial hydrolysis of cornstarch. Corn syrup is important in the production of marshmallow because it prevents the crystallization of other sugars (like sucrose). It may also contribute body, reduce sweetness, and alter flavor release, depending on the Dextrose Equivalent (DE) of the glucose syrup used.

The DE is the measure of the amount of reducing sugars present in a sugar product in relation to glucose. Lower-DE glucose syrups provide a chewier texture, while higher-DE syrups make the product more tender. In addition, depending on the type of DE used, can alter the sweetness, hygroscopicity, and browning of the marshmallow. Corn syrup is flavorless and cheap to produce, which is why candy companies love using this product.

==== Invert sugar ====
Invert sugar is produced when sucrose breaks down due to the addition of water, also known as hydrolysis. This molecule exhibits all the characteristics of honey except the flavor because it is the primary sugar found in honey. This means that invert sugar has the ability to prevent crystallization, and produce a tender marshmallow. It is also an effective humectant, allowing it to trap water and prevent the marshmallow from drying out. For some candies, this is not a good trait to have, but for marshmallows, it is an advantage since it has a high moisture content.

==== Fruit syrups ====
While not widely used for traditional or commercial recipes, fruit syrups have been proposed as an alternative sugar for marshmallows.

=== Additional ingredients ===

==== Flavors ====
Unless a variation of the standard marshmallow is being made, vanilla is always used as the flavoring. The vanilla can either be added in extract form, or by infusing the vanilla beans in the sugar syrup during cooking. This is the best technique to get an even distribution of flavor throughout the marshmallow.

==== Acids ====
Acids, such as cream of tartar or lemon juice, may also be used to increase foam stability. Addition of acid decreases the pH. This reduces the charge on the protein molecules, and brings them closer to their isoelectric point. This results in a stronger, more stable inter-facial film. When added to egg whites, acid prevents excessive aggregation at the interface. However, acid delays foam formation. It may therefore be added toward the end of the whipping process after a stable foam has been created.

== Manufacturing process ==

=== Commercial process ===
In commercial marshmallow manufacture, the entire process is streamlined and fully automated.

Gelatin is cooked with sugar and syrup. After the gelatin-containing syrup is cooked, it is allowed to cool slightly before air is incorporated. Whipping is generally accomplished in a rotor-stator type device. Compressed air is injected into the warm syrup, held at a temperature just above the melting point of gelatin. In a marshmallow aerator, pins on a rotating cylinder (rotor) intermesh with stationary pins on the wall (stator) provide the shear forces necessary to break the large injected air bubbles into numerous tiny bubbles that provide the smooth, fine-grained texture of the marshmallow. A continuous stream of light, fluffy marshmallow exits the aerator en route to the forming step.

The marshmallow confection is typically formed in one of three ways. First, it can be extruded in the desired shape and cut into pieces, as done for Jet-Puffed marshmallows. Second, it can be deposited onto a belt, as done for Peeps. Third, it can be deposited into a starch-based mold in a mogul to make various shapes.

=== Home making process ===

The home process for making marshmallow differs from commercial processes. A mixture of corn syrup and sugar is boiled to about . In a separate step, gelatin is hydrated with enough warm water to make a thick solution. Once the sugar syrup has cooled to about , the gelatin solution is blended in along with desired flavoring, and whipped in a mixer to reach the final density. The marshmallow is then scooped out of the bowl, slabbed on a table, and cut into pieces.
== Roasted marshmallows and s&#x27;mores ==
A popular camping or backyard tradition in the United Kingdom, North America, New Zealand and Australia is the roasting or toasting of marshmallows over a campfire or other open flame. A marshmallow is placed on the end of a stick or skewer and held carefully over the fire. This creates a caramelized outer skin with a liquid, molten layer underneath. Major flavor compounds and color polymers associated with sugar browning are created during the caramelization process.

As sugar costs went down in 19th century, in 1892 a New Jersey newspaper reported that &quot;&#x27;Marshmallow roasts&#x27; are the newest thing in summer resort diversions.&quot; There were more mentions of the trend throughout 1890s, implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) referring to home-made marshmallows, as commercial process was yet to be invented.

S&#x27;mores are a traditional campfire treat in the United States, made by placing a toasted marshmallow on a slab of chocolate, which is placed between two graham crackers. These can then be squeezed together, causing the chocolate to begin melting.

== Nutrition ==
Marshmallows are defined in US law as a food of minimal nutritional value.

== Dietary preferences ==

The traditional marshmallow recipe uses powdered marshmallow root, but most commercially manufactured marshmallows instead use gelatin in their manufacture. Vegans and vegetarians avoid gelatin, but there are versions that use a substitute non-animal gelling agent such as agar. In addition, marshmallows are generally not considered to be kosher or halal unless either their gelatin is derived from kosher or halal animals or they are vegan.

Marshmallow creme and other less firm marshmallow products generally contain little or no gelatin, which mainly serves to allow the familiar marshmallow confection to retain its shape. They generally use egg whites instead. Non-gelatin, egg-containing versions of this product may be consumed by ovo vegetarians. Several brands of vegetarian and vegan marshmallows and marshmallow fluff exist.

<doc id="84242" wikidata="Q465296" url="?curid=84242" title="Beth Orton">
<text>Elizabeth Caroline Orton (born 14 December 1970) is an English musician known for her &quot;folktronica&quot; sound, which mixes elements of folk and electronica. She was initially recognised for her collaborations with William Orbit, Andrew Weatherall, Red Snapper and the Chemical Brothers in the mid-1990s. Her UK/US first solo album, &quot;Trailer Park&quot;, received much critical acclaim in 1996. Orton developed a devoted audience with the release of the BRIT Award-winning album &quot;Central Reservation&quot; (1999) and the 2002 UK top 10 album, &quot;Daybreaker&quot;. Her 2006 album, &quot;Comfort of Strangers&quot;, was followed by a break during which Orton gave birth to her daughter and collaborated with the British guitarist Bert Jansch. Orton returned with &quot;Sugaring Season&quot; in 2012, which moved towards a purer acoustic sound, followed by a return to electronic music with &quot;Kidsticks&quot;, released in 2016.

Orton&#x27;s music has been featured in the movies &quot;How to Deal&quot; and &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;, and also in the TV series &quot;Felicity&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Roswell&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; and &quot;Manifest&quot;, providing her with exposure to a more mainstream American audience.

==Early life and career==
Orton was born in Dereham, Norfolk, but moved to Dalston, East London, at age fourteen. Her father, a public relations consultant and journalist, left her mother when Orton was eleven, and she lived with her mother, a journalist and political activist, and her two brothers, her father dying shortly afterwards. Orton studied A-levels at City College Norwich. Her mother died from cancer in 1989, when Orton was aged 19, which led to her travelling to Thailand for a short period, living with Buddhist nuns. On returning to London, Orton worked at jobs such as a waitress at Pizza Hut, and she even briefly owned her own catering company. Orton was an actress before becoming a musician, initially enrolling at the Anna Scher Theatre School. She toured in an experimental stage adaptation of &quot;Une Saison en Enfer&quot; with a theatre company touring throughout the UK, Russia and Ukraine, playing Arthur Rimbaud&#x27;s lover.

==Musical career==

===&quot;SuperPinkyMandy&quot;===
Orton began working with William Orbit on an LP together as Spill, entitled &quot;Burn Blind&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Know &#x27;Bout Evil&quot; was the first track on the album that ended up being released in just Orton&#x27;s name. &quot;Superpinkymandy&quot; was named after a rag doll which she bought at a jumble sale at the age of six. This rare album was released only in Japan, in extremely limited numbers (popularly quoted as between 1,000 and 5,000 copies). The sound is very much Orbit&#x27;s, but all of the songs (except &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Know &#x27;Bout Evil&quot; written by John Martyn) were co-written by Orton and Orbit, and some tracks were later recycled, in very different versions. &quot;She Cries Your Name&quot; later appeared on &quot;Trailer Park&quot;. &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Gone&quot; became &quot;Montok Point&quot; on the fourth Strange Cargo release, &quot;Hinterland&quot; (1995). &quot;Hinterland&quot; had Orton&#x27;s vocals on several tracks, and also included an alternative version of &quot;She Cries Your Name&quot;.

Orton provided a one-word vocal to the first Red Snapper EP in 1994 (&quot;Snapper&quot;), then co-wrote and sang on &quot;In Deep&quot; on &quot;The Swank EP&quot; (also 1994). Ali Friend from Red Snapper later joined Orton&#x27;s band.

It was roughly at this time that she met Ed Simons and Tom Rowlands of The Chemical Brothers and began the first in a series of collaborations, providing vocals for the track &quot;Alive Alone&quot; on &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot; (1995). She would later provide vocals for the tracks &quot;Where Do I Begin&quot; on &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot; (1997) and &quot;The State We&#x27;re In&quot; on &quot;Come with Us&quot; (2002). In 2018 she and The Chemical Brothers released a long-lost cover of Tim Buckley&#x27;s &quot;I Never Asked to Be Your Mountain&quot;, a collaborative effort dating back from the late &#x27;90s, when the three were sharing space in London’s Orinoco studios. According to Mixmag &quot;Orton said she rediscovered the tune after it fell out of an unread copy of War and Peace.&quot;

===&quot;Trailer Park&quot;===
Her first solo single, a cover of The Ronettes&#x27; &quot;I Wish I Never Saw the Sunshine&quot;, was released, again in extremely limited numbers, in mid-1996, and was followed by &quot;She Cries Your Name&quot;, shortly before the release of what she herself considers to be her first LP &quot;Trailer Park&quot;, released on Heavenly Records on 19 October 1996. This release earned her nominations for two BRIT Awards (best British newcomer, best British female) and the Mercury Music Prize in 1997, was well received by critics, and sold modestly well, selling 300,000 copies and peaking at No. 68 in the UK. The album presented Orton&#x27;s signature sound, an innovative mix of acoustic-based songwriting and electronic beats and elements. She began to tour this record, first supporting acts such as The Beautiful South, and appearing with Ron Sexsmith, before touring on her own. In June 1997, she had her first UK Top 40 hit single with a reissue of &quot;She Cries Your Name&quot;.

===&quot;Central Reservation&quot;===

That summer she toured with Lilith Fair, released the &quot;Best Bit&quot; EP which included the single &quot;Best Bit&quot;, and collaborated with soul legend Terry Callier on a cover of Fred Neil&#x27;s song &quot;Dolphins&quot;. That song improved on her previous best chart position, reaching number 38 in the UK. &quot;Central Reservation&quot;, her second album (proper), helped Orton build on the success of her début. Although retaining the electronic edge of the former, this record showed a notably more acoustic side with a few tracks consisting purely of Orton&#x27;s vocals accompanied by a solitary acoustic guitar, with subject matters becoming more introspective, including &quot;Pass in Time&quot;, a song about the death of her mother. Despite this style, the album still provided more polished moments such as lead single &quot;Stolen Car&quot;, the jazz-and-strings-tinged &quot;Sweetest Decline&quot;, and the electro melancholy of &quot;Stars All Seem to Weep&quot; (with the haunting vocal allegedly recorded in a single take). The album also featured notable contributions from soul musician Terry Callier, Dr. Robert and Ben Harper. Two tracks were produced by Ben Watt of Everything But The Girl.

The album earned Orton a second Mercury Music Prize nomination and won the Best Female Artist award at the 2000 BRIT Awards.

&quot;Central Reservation&quot; is ranked number 982 in &quot;All-Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (3rd. edition, 2000).

===&quot;Daybreaker&quot;===
In July 2002, Orton released the album &quot;Daybreaker&quot;, which again blended the early electronica style, with uptempo pop songs and acoustic ballads. It featured guest appearances from musicians such as the Chemical Brothers, Emmylou Harris, whom she met at Lilith Fair, Ryan Adams and Four Tet. It was a great commercial success, reaching the top 8 of the UK Albums Chart, and received largely positive reviews from the press, ranging from &quot;Her best work yet&quot; from &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine, the &quot;NME&quot; (8/10), &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;, but receiving a more lukewarm reception from &quot;Q&quot; (despite this, she was nominated for the &quot;Q&quot; award for best album). This was followed in 2003 by a US-only release on American label Astralwerks, &quot;The Other Side of Daybreak&quot;, an album consisting mainly of B-sides and remixes of songs from &quot;Daybreaker&quot;, created by artists such as Roots Manuva. She also contributed a song to the War Child charity, for their &quot;Hope&quot; compilation album that year.

&quot;Daybreaker&quot; debuted at No. 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has sold 155,000 copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan.

A &quot;best of&quot; double album, titled &quot;Pass in Time&quot;, was released in 2003. It represented Orton&#x27;s extensive and diverse musical career through previously unreleased songs, B-sides, and rarities (such as &quot;Where Do You Go&quot; from &quot;Superpinkymandy&quot;), as well as collaborations with William Orbit and the Chemical Brothers. On 31 March 2003, she played to a packed Royal Albert Hall in London on the last date of her worldwide &quot;Daybreaker&quot; tour. In addition, she played a tribute concert to Elliott Smith in November.

===&quot;Comfort of Strangers&quot;===

Orton&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Comfort of Strangers&quot;, was released in February 2006. The North American release was through Astralwerks, and the UK release was through EMI-UK. The release saw her move away from the electronica element that she is usually associated with, to a more stripped down traditional alt-folk album. This album followed an extended absence since her previous release, partially a result of several production attempts, and the parting of ways between her and Heavenly Records. The album was produced by musician Jim O&#x27;Rourke. It was widely acclaimed, with critics noting the depth and focus of the songwriting and the stripped-down quality of the music.

===&quot;Sugaring Season&quot;===

On 11 July 2012, &quot;Sugaring Season&quot; was announced on Orton&#x27;s official website as the follow-up album to &quot;Comfort of Strangers&quot;. It was released on ANTI-, her first through that label, on 1 October 2012, in the UK and the next day in the US. Recorded in Portland, Oregon, US, the album was produced by Tucker Martine and expanded on the purely acoustic sound of her previous record, with many of the songs written in the open guitar tunings Orton had learned from Bert Jansch in the years previous. The album was largely recorded live, with a band consisting of Brian Blade on drums, Sebastian Sternberg on bass and Rob Burger on keyboards. Additional guitar work came from Marc Ribot and Ted Barnes, with backing vocals by Laura Veirs and Sam Amidon. &quot;Sugaring Season&quot; was widely received as a return to form, with many critics calling it her finest album to date.

&quot;Paste&quot; magazine said, &quot;Blessed with great songs, wonderful arrangements and vocal performances that seriously raise the bar in our expectations of what she&#x27;s capable of, it is a record that shows real artistic growth in every area and is destined to become a classic that rivals Trailer Park and Central Reservation&quot;, while &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called it &quot;10 songs of sweet resilience delivered by a voice of seemingly effortless expression.&quot; Her solo concert in November 2016 was named a top gig of the year by chief &quot;New York Times&quot; critic John Pareles, who stated, &quot;Alone onstage with her acoustic guitar for much of her set, Ms. Orton set up steady, mantralike picking patterns, a backdrop of serene constancy for the turmoil of ache and determination in her vocals. The songs were hypnotic, the audience silently rapt.&quot; The album release was followed by extensive touring in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, solo and with her band, and included an appearance as musical guest on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

===&quot;Kidsticks&quot;===
Orton&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Kidsticks&quot;, was released on 27 May 2016 and marked a distinct turn towards a purely electronic sound, with her playing keyboards and synthesizers instead of acoustic guitar. The album was produced by Orton herself alongside Andrew Hung from the band Fuck Buttons, who provided drum and synth programming. The album included contributions from Chris Taylor of Grizzly Bear, George Lewis Jr from Twin Shadow and composer Dustin O’Halloran. &quot;Kidsticks&quot; was released on 27 May 2016 following extensive airplay of the singles &quot;Moon&quot; and &quot;1973&quot; on BBC 6Music and elsewhere. In October 2016, Orton returned to &quot;Later ... with Jools Holland&quot;, performing the singles &quot;1973&quot; and &quot;Wave&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Kidsticks&quot; is a real reinvention: not so much a return to her electronic roots as a bold exploration of fresh territory.&quot;

Orton was criticised over her music video for the song &quot;1973&quot; in which she is shown spray painting a federally protected Joshua tree and other desert plant life. After an outcry from the local community, which included a petition on change.org, the music video was removed online. Orton publicly apologised and the Mojave Desert Trust responded positively to her outreach, stating, &quot;We appreciate that Beth Orton regrets her prior actions, and that she intends to educate others about the natural beauty of the Mojave Desert, and the responsibility we collectively share for protecting this unique environment from vandalism and harm.&quot;

===Band===
Orton&#x27;s consistent band from 1999&#x27;s &quot;Central Reservation&quot; until around 2006 was guitarist Ted Barnes, keyboardist Sean Read, ex-Sandals drummer Will Blanchard and former Red Snapper member Ali Friend on bass. However, this had changed by 2008, with Ali and Ted having moved on to form their own band Clayhill, and Ted having pursued his own projects, with Orton guesting on his solo debut album, &quot;Short Scenes&quot;. After that Orton&#x27;s touring band consisted of Amidon, Steinberg, with Steven Nistor on drums, and her current touring band consists of Alex Thomas on sticks, vocals and electronics, and Grey McMurray on guitar, bass and electronics.

Orton played at the &quot;One Big No&quot; concert in March 2003 at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London, organised by Emily Eavis, and has participated in concerts hosted by producer Hal Willner, including the 2006 concert film &quot;Leonard Cohen: I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;, and performing a duet with Nick Cave as part of Willner&#x27;s Allen Ginsberg Tribute at the Ace Theater in Los Angeles, in spring of 2015.

==Acting==
Orton played the lead female in the independent film &quot;Southlander&quot; in 2001. She returned to acting with a leading role in the British independent film &quot;Light Years&quot; (2015), directed by Esther May Campbell.

==Personal life==
Orton gave birth to a daughter, Nancy, in mid-December 2006. She cancelled her September 2006 UK tour because of her pregnancy. She is now married to musician Sam Amidon and the two have a son, Arthur, born in 2011. They lived in Los Angeles until 2015 before returning to London. She suffers from Crohn&#x27;s disease and complications from previous medications.

<text>In Greek mythology, the name Halaesus or Halesus (Latin: Alesi; ) may refer to:

*Halesus, the Emathian Lapith who attended the wedding of Pirithous and Hippodamia. He was killed and stripped of his armor by the Centaur Latreus during the battle between the Lapiths and the centaurs.
*Halesus, a companion of Agamemnon during the Trojan War; some state that he was an illegitimate son of Agamemnon. After the war, having escaped the massacre organized by Clytaemnestra and Aegisthus of Agamemnon and his retinue, he travelled to Italy and founded the city of Falerii (now Civita Castellana), which received its name after him. He joined Turnus in the war against Aeneas, &quot;not because he liked Turnus but because of the hate caused by his ancient hostility (towards Aeneas)&quot;, as Servius remarks. He was killed by Pallas while defending Imaon, a fellow warrior.

<text>In Greek mythology, Halitherses (), son of Mastor, was an Ithacan prophet who warned the suitors of Penelope after interpreting the symbols that Zeus sent to &quot;be wise in time, and put a stop to this wickedness before he comes.&quot; The suitors do not heed Halitherses&#x27; warning. After the suitors all die, Halitherses warns the suitors&#x27; families against action against Odysseus, saying they will bring evil on their heads for this action against the gods&#x27; will. Only half of them listen. The suitors&#x27; families go on to try to kill Odysseus&#x27;s family, but they are thwarted by the goddess Athena. Halitherses was one of Odysseus&#x27; dear friends back in Ithaca, along with Mentor. Both Halitherses and Mentor tried to stop the suitors but were unable to. However, Penelope remained faithful to Odysseus.

*Hicetaon, a Trojan prince as the son of King Laomedon of Troy, thus a brother of King Priam. He was one of the Trojan elders.

His sons were: Melanippus, who died in the war Hicetaon had sought to avert; Critolaus, husband of Priam&#x27;s daughter Aristomache; Thymoetes (in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; only, otherwise given as his brother); and, possibly, Antenor.
*Hicetaon, prince of Methymna in Lesbos. He was the son of King Lepetymnus and Methymna, daughter of King Macareus. He was killed by Achilles, when the latter attacked the islands close to the mainland.

<text>Thelonious Sphere Monk ( October 10, 1917 – February 17, 1982) was an American jazz pianist and composer. He had a unique improvisational style and made numerous contributions to the standard jazz repertoire, including &quot;&#x27;Round Midnight&quot;, &quot;Blue Monk&quot;, &quot;Straight, No Chaser&quot;, &quot;Ruby, My Dear&quot;, &quot;In Walked Bud&quot;, and &quot;Well, You Needn&#x27;t&quot;. Monk is the second-most-recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington.

Monk&#x27;s compositions and improvisations feature dissonances and angular melodic twists, often using flat ninths, flat fifths, unexpected chromatic notes together, low bass notes and stride, and fast whole tone runs, combining a highly percussive attack with abrupt, dramatic use of switched key releases, silences, and hesitations.

Monk&#x27;s distinct look included suits, hats, and sunglasses. He also had an idiosyncratic habit during performances: while other musicians continued playing, Monk would stop, stand up, and dance for a few moments before returning to the piano.

Monk is one of five jazz musicians to have been featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; (the others being Louis Armstrong, Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington, and Wynton Marsalis).

==Biography==

===1917–1933: Early life===
Thelonious Sphere Monk was born on October 10, 1917, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, the son of Thelonious (or Thelious) and Barbara Monk. His sister, Marion, had been born two years earlier. His birth certificate spelled his first name as &quot;Thelious&quot; and did not list his middle name, taken from his maternal grandfather, Sphere Batts. His brother, Thomas, was born in January 1920. In 1922, the family moved to the Phipps Houses, 243 West 63rd Street, in Manhattan, New York City; the neighborhood was known as San Juan Hill because of the many African-American veterans of the Spanish–American War who lived there (urban renewal displaced the long-time residents of the community, who saw their neighborhood replaced by the Amsterdam Housing Projects and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, though the Phipps Houses remained). Monk studied the trumpet briefly before switching to the piano at age nine, taking lessons from a neighbor, Alberta Simmons, who taught him in the stride style of Fats Waller, James P. Johnson and Eubie Blake. Monk&#x27;s mother also taught him to play some hymns, and he would sometimes accompany her singing at church. He attended Stuyvesant High School, a public school for gifted students, but did not graduate.

For two years, Monk studied classical piano under Simon Wolf, an Austrian-born pianist and violinist who had studied under Alfred Megerlin, the concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic. Monk learned to play pieces by composers such as Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Liszt, but his favorites were Chopin and Rachmaninoff. The lessons were discontinued when it became clear that Monk&#x27;s main focus was jazz.

===1933–1946: Early performing career===
Monk put his first band together at the age of 16, getting a few restaurant and school gigs. At 17, Monk toured with an evangelist, playing the church organ, and in his late teens he began to find work playing jazz. In the early to mid-1940s, he was the house pianist at Minton&#x27;s Playhouse, a Manhattan nightclub. Much of Monk&#x27;s style (in the Harlem stride tradition) was developed while he performed at Minton&#x27;s where he participated in after-hours cutting contests, which featured many leading jazz soloists of the time. Monk&#x27;s musical work at Minton&#x27;s was crucial in the formulation of bebop, which would be furthered by other musicians, including Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Christian, Kenny Clarke, Charlie Parker, and, later, Miles Davis. Monk is believed to be the pianist featured on recordings Jerry Newman made around 1941 at the club. Monk&#x27;s style at this time was later described as &quot;hard-swinging&quot;, with the addition of runs in the style of Art Tatum. Monk&#x27;s stated influences included Duke Ellington, James P. Johnson, and other early stride pianists. According to the documentary &quot;Thelonious Monk: Straight, No Chaser&quot;, Monk lived in the same neighborhood in New York City as Johnson and knew him as a teenager.

In March 1943, Monk reported for his Army Induction physical, but was labeled by the Army psychiatrist as &quot;psychiatric reject&quot; and not inducted into the Armed Forces during WWII.

Mary Lou Williams, who mentored Monk and his contemporaries, spoke of Monk&#x27;s rich inventiveness in this period, and how such invention was vital for musicians, since at the time it was common for fellow musicians to incorporate overheard musical ideas into their own works without giving due credit. &quot;So, the boppers worked out a music that was hard to steal. I&#x27;ll say this for the &#x27;leeches,&#x27; though: they tried. I&#x27;ve seen them in Minton&#x27;s busily writing on their shirt cuffs or scribbling on the tablecloth. And even our own guys, I&#x27;m afraid, did not give Monk the credit he had coming. Why, they even stole his idea of the beret and bop glasses.&quot;

In 1944, Monk cut his first commercial recordings with the Coleman Hawkins Quartet. Hawkins was one of the earliest established jazz musicians to promote Monk, and the pianist later returned the favor by inviting Hawkins to join him on a 1957 session with John Coltrane.

===1947–1952: Lorraine Gordon===
In 1947, Ike Quebec introduced Monk to Lorraine Gordon and her first husband, Alfred Lion, co-founder of Blue Note Records. From then on, Gordon preached his genius to the jazz world with unrelenting passion. Shortly after meeting Gordon and Lion, Monk made his first recordings as a leader for Blue Note (later anthologized on &quot;Genius of Modern Music, Vol. 1&quot;*), which showcased his talents as a composer of original melodies for improvisation. Monk Blue Note Sessions were recorded between 1947 and 1952.

Monk married Nellie Smith in 1947, and on December 27, 1949, the couple had a son, T. S. Monk (called Toot), who became a jazz drummer. A daughter, Barbara (affectionately known as Boo-Boo), was born on September 5, 1953, and died of cancer in 1984.

In her autobiography, Gordon spoke of the utter lack of interest in Monk&#x27;s recordings, which translated to poor sales. &quot;I went to Harlem and those record stores didn&#x27;t want Monk or me. I&#x27;ll never forget one particular owner, I can still see him and his store on Seventh Avenue and 125th Street. &#x27;He can&#x27;t play lady, what are you doing up here? The guy has two left hands.&#x27; &#x27;You just wait,&#x27; I&#x27;d say. &#x27;This man&#x27;s a genius, you don&#x27;t know anything.

For Alfred Lion, co-owner of Blue Note Records, sales were a secondary consideration. Michael Cuscuna relates that Alfred Lion told him that there were three people in his life that when he heard them, he just flipped and had to record everything they did. The first was Monk, the second was Herbie Nichols, and the third was Andrew Hill, where he didn&#x27;t care how much money he made or lost. He just had to record this music.

Due to Monk&#x27;s reticence, Gordon became his mouthpiece to the public. In February 1948, she wrote to Ralph Ingersoll, the editor of the newspaper &quot;PM,&quot; and described Monk as &quot;a genius living here in the heart of New York, whom nobody knows&quot;. As a result, one of &quot;PM&quot;&#x27;s best writers visited Monk to do a feature on him, but Monk wouldn&#x27;t speak to the reporter unless Gordon was in the room with him. In September of the same year, Lorraine approached Max Gordon, the owner and founder of the Village Vanguard and secured Monk his first gig there. Monk was showcased at the club for a week, but not a single person came.

In August 1951, New York City police searched a parked car occupied by Monk and his friend Bud Powell. They found narcotics in the car, presumed to have belonged to Powell. Monk refused to testify against his friend, so the police confiscated his New York City Cabaret Card. Without this, Monk was nominally unable to play in any New York venue where liquor was served. Although this severely restricted his ability to perform for several years, a coterie of musicians led by Randy Weston introduced Monk to Black-owned bars and clubs in Brooklyn that flouted the law, enabling the pianist to play little-advertised, one-night engagements throughout the borough with a modicum of regularity. Monk spent most of the early and mid-1950s composing and performing at theaters, outer borough clubs and out-of-town venues.

===1952–1954: Prestige Records===
After intermittent recording sessions for Blue Note from 1947 to 1952, Monk was under contract to Prestige Records for the following two years. With Prestige, he cut several highly significant, but at the time under-recognized, albums, including collaborations with the saxophonist Sonny Rollins and the drummers Art Blakey and Max Roach. In 1954, Monk participated in a Christmas Eve session, which produced most of the albums &quot;Bags&#x27; Groove&quot; and &quot;Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants&quot; by Davis. In his autobiography, &quot;Miles&quot;, Davis claimed that the alleged anger and tension between them did not take place and that the claims of blows being exchanged were &quot;rumors&quot; and a &quot;misunderstanding&quot;.

In 1954, Monk paid his first visit to Paris. As well as performing at concerts, he recorded a solo piano session for French radio (later issued as an album by Disques Vogue). Backstage, Mary Lou Williams introduced him to Baroness Pannonica &quot;Nica&quot; de Koenigswarter, a member of the Rothschild family and a patroness of several New York City jazz musicians. She was a close friend for the rest of Monk&#x27;s life: she &quot;served as a surrogate wife right alongside Monk&#x27;s equally devoted actual wife, Nellie&quot; and &quot;paid Monk&#x27;s bills, dragged him to an endless array of doctors, put him and his family up in her own home and, when necessary, helped Nellie institutionalize him. In 1958, Monk and the baroness were stopped by the police in Delaware. When a small amount of marijuana was discovered, she took the rap for her friend and even served a few nights in jail.&quot;

===1955–1961: Riverside Records===
By the time of his signing to Riverside, Monk was highly regarded by his peers and by some critics, but his records remained poor sellers and his music was still regarded as too &quot;difficult&quot; for more mainstream acceptance. Indeed, with Monk&#x27;s consent, Riverside had managed to buy out his previous Prestige contract for a mere $108.24 ($1,273.44 in 2024). He willingly recorded two albums of jazz standards as a means of increasing his profile: &quot;Thelonious Monk Plays Duke Ellington&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Unique Thelonious Monk&quot; (1956).

On &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot;, recorded in late 1956, Monk mainly performed his own music. The complex title track, which featured Rollins, was so difficult to play that the final version had to be edited together from multiple takes. The album, however, was largely regarded as the first commercial success for Monk.

After having his cabaret card restored, Monk relaunched his New York career with a landmark six-month residency at the Five Spot Cafe in the East Village neighborhood of New York beginning in June 1957, leading a quartet with John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Wilbur Ware on bass, and Shadow Wilson on drums. Little of this group&#x27;s music was documented owing to contractual problems: Coltrane was signed to Prestige at the time, but Monk refused to return to his former label. One studio session by the quartet was made for Riverside, three tunes which were not released until 1961 by the subsidiary label Jazzland along with outtakes from a larger group recording with Coltrane and Hawkins, those results appearing in 1957 as the album &quot;Monk&#x27;s Music&quot;. An amateur recording from the Five Spot (a later September 1958 reunion with Coltrane sitting in for Johnny Griffin) was issued on Blue Note in 1993; and a recording of the quartet performing at a Carnegie Hall concert on November 29 was recorded in high fidelity by Voice of America engineers, unearthed in the collection of the Library of Congress and released by Blue Note in 2005.

&quot;Crepuscule with Nellie&quot;, recorded in 1957, was referred to by biographer Robin D. G. Kelley as Monk&#x27;s &quot;only through-composed composition, meaning that there is no improvising. It is Monk&#x27;s concerto, if you will, and in some ways it speaks for itself. But he wrote it very, very carefully and very deliberately and really struggled to make it sound the way it sounds. ... it was his love song for Nellie&quot;.

The Five Spot residency ended Christmas 1957; Coltrane left to rejoin Davis&#x27;s group, and the band was effectively disbanded. Monk did not form another long-term band until June 1958 when he began a second residency at the Five Spot, again with a quartet, this time with Griffin (Charlie Rouse later) on tenor, Ahmed Abdul-Malik on bass, and Roy Haynes on drums.

On October 15, 1958, en route to a week-long engagement for the quartet at the Comedy Club in Baltimore, Maryland, Monk and de Koenigswarter were detained by police in Wilmington, Delaware. When Monk refused to answer questions or cooperate with the policemen, they beat him with a blackjack. Although they had authorization to search the vehicle and found narcotics in suitcases held in the trunk of the Baroness&#x27;s car, Judge Christie of the Delaware Superior Court ruled that the unlawful detention of the pair, and the beating of Monk, rendered the consent to the search void as it was given under duress.

===1962–1970: Columbia Records===
After extended negotiations, Monk signed in 1962 with Columbia Records, one of the big four American record labels of the day. Monk&#x27;s relationship with Riverside had soured over disagreements concerning royalty payments and had concluded with two European live albums; he had not recorded an album for Riverside since April 1960.

Working with producer Teo Macero on his debut for Columbia, the sessions in the first week of November had a lineup that had been with him for two years: tenor saxophonist Rouse (who worked regularly with Monk from 1959 to 1970), bassist John Ore, and drummer Frankie Dunlop. &quot;Monk&#x27;s Dream&quot;, his first Columbia album, was released in 1963.

Columbia&#x27;s resources allowed Monk to receive more promotion than earlier in his career. &quot;Monk&#x27;s Dream&quot; became the best-selling LP of his lifetime, and on February 28, 1964, he appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, being featured in the article &quot;The Loneliest Monk&quot;. The cover article was originally intended to run in November 1963, but it was delayed due to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. According to biographer Kelley, the 1964 &quot;Time&quot; appearance came because &quot;Barry Farrell, who wrote the cover story, wanted to write about a jazz musician and almost by default Monk was chosen, because they thought Ray Charles and Miles Davis were too controversial. ... [Monk] wasn&#x27;t so political. ... Of course, I challenge that [in the biography],&quot; Kelley wrote.

Monk continued to record studio albums, including &quot;Criss Cross&quot;, also in 1963, and &quot;Underground&quot;, in 1968. But by the Columbia years his compositional output was limited, and only his final Columbia studio record, &quot;Underground&quot;, featured a substantial number of new tunes, including his only time piece, &quot;Ugly Beauty&quot;.

As had been the case with Riverside, his period with Columbia contains multiple live albums, including &quot;Miles and Monk at Newport&quot; (1963), &quot;Live at the It Club&quot;, and &quot;Live at the Jazz Workshop&quot;, the latter two recorded in 1964, the last not being released until 1982. After the departure of Ore and Dunlop, the remainder of the rhythm section in Monk&#x27;s quartet during the bulk of his Columbia period was Larry Gales on bass and Ben Riley on drums, both of whom joined in 1964. Along with Rouse, they remained with Monk for over four years, his longest-serving band.

In 1968, Monk, Gales, Rouse, and Riley played a concert at Palo Alto High School in the San Francisco Bay Area, at the invitation of a 16-year-old student charged with organizing school dances. This resulted in the quartet&#x27;s final recording, &quot;Palo Alto&quot; (2020).

===1971–1982: Later life and death===
Monk had disappeared from the scene by the mid-1970s for health reasons and made only a small number of appearances during the final decade of his life. His last studio recordings as a leader were made in November 1971 for the English Black Lion label, near the end of a worldwide tour with the Giants of Jazz, a group which included Gillespie, Kai Winding, Sonny Stitt, Al McKibbon, and Art Blakey. Bassist McKibbon, who had known Monk for over twenty years and played on his final tour in 1971, later said: &quot;On that tour, Monk said about two words. I mean literally maybe two words. He didn&#x27;t say &#x27;Good morning,&#x27; &#x27;Goodnight,&#x27; &#x27;What time?&#x27; Nothing. Why, I don&#x27;t know. He sent word back after the tour was over that the reason he couldn&#x27;t communicate or play was that Art Blakey and I were so ugly.&quot; A different side of Monk is revealed in Lewis Porter&#x27;s biography &quot;John Coltrane: His Life and Music&quot;; Coltrane states: &quot;Monk is exactly the opposite of Miles [Davis]: he talks about music all the time, and he wants so much for you to understand that if, by chance, you ask him something, he&#x27;ll spend hours if necessary to explain it to you.&quot; Blakey reports that Monk was excellent at both chess and checkers.

The documentary film &quot;Thelonious Monk: Straight, No Chaser&quot; (1988) attributes Monk&#x27;s quirky behavior to mental illness. In the film, Monk&#x27;s son says that his father sometimes did not recognize him, and he reports that Monk was hospitalized on several occasions owing to an unspecified mental illness that worsened in the late 1960s. No reports or diagnoses were ever publicized, but Monk would often become excited for two or three days, then pace for days after that, after which he would withdraw and stop speaking. Doctors recommended electroconvulsive therapy as a treatment option for Monk&#x27;s illness, but his family would not allow it; antipsychotics and lithium were prescribed instead. Other theories abound: Leslie Gourse, author of the book &quot;Straight, No Chaser: The Life and Genius of Thelonious Monk&quot; (1997), reported that at least one of Monk&#x27;s psychiatrists failed to find evidence of manic depression (bipolar disorder) or schizophrenia. Another doctor maintains that Monk was misdiagnosed and prescribed drugs during his hospital stay that may have caused brain damage.

As his health declined, Monk&#x27;s last six years were spent as a guest in the Weehawken, New Jersey, home of his long-standing patron and friend Pannonica de Koenigswarter, who nursed Monk during his final illness. She proved to be a steadfast presence, as did his own wife Nellie, especially as his life descended into further isolation. Monk did not play the piano during this time, even though one was present in his room, and he spoke to few visitors. He died of a stroke on February 17, 1982, and was buried in Ferncliff Cemetery (Grave 405, Hillcrest 1 section) at Hartsdale, New York. 

===Posthumous myth: Monk at Juilliard===
There have been numerous published references since the 1980s in Monk biographies claiming that he attended the Juilliard School of Music, an error that continues to be disseminated in online biographies of Monk. At Monk&#x27;s funeral service in 1982, it was mentioned in his eulogy that he took classes in harmony and arrangement at Juilliard. In the 1988 documentary film &quot;Thelonious Monk: Straight No Chaser&quot;, Samuel E. Wright narrates that &quot;Monk began playing piano without formal training. Later, he took lessons and studied music theory at the Juilliard School of Music.&quot;

The complete lack of documented evidence connecting Monk with attending Juilliard was noted by Monk biographer Thomas Fitterling in the first German edition of his Monk biography published in 1987. The Juilliard canard may have its early source in the fact that Monk&#x27;s sister Marion thought that her piano teacher, a Mr. Wolfe (sic), who briefly taught Thelonious around 1930, may have been connected to Juilliard as a teacher or student. In fact, the Monk family piano teacher had been trained by the concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic and has no known connection to Juilliard. Monk biographer Laurent de Wilde believed that the apocryphal Juilliard story may have stemmed from Monk&#x27;s late 1950s collaboration with Juilliard instructor Hall Overton. The main source of the Juilliard misunderstanding is probably that Monk participated in a music contest –1943 at the Columbus Hill Community Center in his neighborhood, which had a Juilliard scholarship as the first prize. Monk entered the contest but placed second and thus failed to get the scholarship. According to Monk&#x27;s wife Nellie, when the prize winner later encountered Monk during a 1958 engagement and told him that Monk should rightfully have been awarded the Juilliard scholarship, Monk replied: &quot;I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go to the conservatory. Probably would&#x27;ve ruined me.&quot;

==Technique and playing style==
Monk once said, &quot;The piano ain&#x27;t got no wrong notes.&quot;

According to &quot;Bebop: The Music and Its Players&quot; author Thomas Owens:Monk&#x27;s usual piano touch was harsh and percussive, even in ballads. He often attacked the keyboard anew for each note, rather than striving for any semblance of legato. Often seemingly unintentional seconds embellish his melodic lines, giving the effect of someone playing while wearing work gloves. ... He hit the keys with fingers held flat rather than in a natural curve, and held his free fingers high above the keys. ... Sometimes he hit a single key with more than one finger, and divided single-line melodies between the two hands.In contrast with this unorthodox approach to playing, he could play runs and arpeggios with great speed and accuracy. He also had good finger independence, allowing him to play a melodic line and a trill simultaneously in his right hand.

Monk&#x27;s style was not universally appreciated: for example, the poet and jazz critic Philip Larkin described him as &quot;the elephant on the keyboard&quot;.

Monk often used parts of whole tone scales, played either ascending or descending, and covering several octaves. He also had extended improvisations that featured parallel sixths (he also used these in the themes of some of his compositions). His solos also feature space and long notes. Unusually for a bebop-based pianist, as an accompanist and on solo performances he often employed a left-hand stride pattern. A further characteristic of his work as an accompanist was his tendency to stop playing, leaving a soloist with just bass and drums for support. Monk had a particular proclivity for the key of B flat. All of his many blues compositions, including &quot;Blue Monk&quot;, &quot;Misterioso&quot;, &quot;Blues Five Spot&quot;, and &quot;Functional&quot;, were composed in B flat; in addition, his signature theme, &quot;Thelonious&quot;, largely consists of an incessantly repeated B-flat tone.

==Awards and accolades==
In 1993, he was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2006, he was awarded a special Pulitzer Prize for &quot;a body of distinguished and innovative musical composition that has had a significant and enduring impact on the evolution of jazz&quot;.

The Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz was established in 1986 by the Monk family and Maria Fisher. Its mission is to offer public school-based jazz education programs for young people around the globe, helping students develop imaginative thinking, creativity, curiosity, a positive self-image, and a respect for their own and others&#x27; cultural heritage. In addition to hosting an annual International Jazz Competition since 1987, the institute also helped, through its partnership with UNESCO, designate April 30, 2012, as the first annual International Jazz Day. It was renamed the Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz in 2019.

Monk was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009.

<text>An individual&#x27;s diet is the sum of food and drink that one habitually consumes. Dieting is the practice of attempting to achieve or maintain a certain weight through diet. People&#x27;s dietary choices are often affected by a variety of factors, including ethical and religious beliefs, clinical need, or a desire to control weight.

Not all diets are considered healthy. Some people follow unhealthy diets through habit, rather than through a conscious choice to eat unhealthily. Terms applied to such eating habits include &quot;junk food diet&quot; and &quot;Western diet&quot;. Many diets are considered by clinicians to pose significant health risks and minimal long-term benefit. This is particularly true of &quot;crash&quot; or &quot;fad&quot; diets – short-term, weight-loss plans that involve drastic changes to a person&#x27;s normal eating habits.

&quot;Only diets covered on Wikipedia are listed under alphabetically sorted headings&quot;.

==Belief-based diets==
Some people&#x27;s dietary choices are influenced by their religious, spiritual or philosophical beliefs.

* Buddhist diet: While Buddhism does not have specific dietary rules, some Buddhists practice vegetarianism based on Mahayana Buddhism&#x27;s strict interpretation of the first of the Five Precepts. 
* Hindu diet: It is popular for followers of Hinduism to follow lacto vegetarian diets (though most do not), based on the principle of ahimsa (non-harming). Consuming beef/cattle is forbidden or at least taboo among followers due to cow veneration. Most Hindus in India do intentionally limit their meat consumption one way or another.
* Jain diet: Due to how the Jain faith interprets &quot;ahisma,&quot; vegetarianism is considered mandatory for followers; a lacto-vegetarian diet or vegan diet in particular is considered appropriate for Jains. Most Jains also abstain from consuming root vegetables in order to prevent harming insects, worms and microorganisms when they are uprooted. Most also partake in some form of fasting. Some variants of Jainism further discourage or forbid the consumption of honey, fungi, alcoholic beverages and fermented foods.
* Islamic diet: Muslims follow a diet consisting solely of food that is halal – permissible in Islam. The opposite of halal is haraam, food that is Islamically impermissible. Haraam substances include alcohol, carnivores, pork and other non-ruminant animals, and any meat from an animal which was not killed through the Islamic method of ritual slaughter (Dhabiha). If an otherwise Halal animal was subject to torture by humans, its meat can still be considered non-permissible for Muslims.
* I-tal: A set of principles which influences the diet of many members of the Rastafari movement. One principle is that natural foods should be consumed. Emphasis is put on consuming produce that is fresh, organic and ideally grown at home or locally. Another principle involves avoiding &quot;unclean&quot; types of food; the definition which is influenced by Biblical teachings. In order to preserve &quot;life energy&quot; Rastafarians encourage teetotalism, and many Rastafarians interpret I-tal to advocate vegetarianism or veganism as well. Many followers do view seafood as an acceptable addition to an I-tal diet but they restrict which kinds they permit; fish over a foot long are typically avoided and all shellfish are eschewed as they are not kosher animals—unlike finned-fish with scales.
* Kosher diet: Food permissible under kashrut, the set of Jewish dietary laws, is said to be kosher. Some foods and food combinations are non-kosher, and failure to prepare food in accordance with kashrut can make otherwise permissible foods non-Kosher.
* Seventh-day Adventist diet: Combines the kosher food rules of Judaism with prohibitions against alcoholic beverages and (sometimes) caffeinated beverages. There is emphasis on consuming whole foods. Meat-consumption is heavily discouraged but not necessarily disallowed; about half of Adventists are lacto-ovo-vegetarians. Vegan and pescetarian diets are also more popular among Adventists compared to the general public but other Adventists are still willing to eat Kosher meats.
* Word of Wisdom diet: The name of a section of the Doctrine and Covenants, a book of scripture accepted by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Dietary advice includes (1) wholesome plants &quot;in the season thereof&quot;, (2) eating meat sparingly and only &quot;in times of winter, or of cold, or famine&quot;, and (3) grain as the &quot;staff of life&quot;. Unlike injunctions against tobacco, alcohol, coffee and tea—compliance with meat-avoidance has always remained optional among the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and emphasis on refraining from meat has largely been dropped. An official church publication states, &quot;modern methods of refrigeration now make it possible to preserve meat in any season&quot;.

==Calorie and weight control diets==

A desire to lose weight is a common motivation to change dietary habits, as is a desire to maintain an existing weight. Many weight loss diets are considered by some to entail varying degrees of health risk, and some are not widely considered to be effective. This is especially true of &quot;crash&quot; or &quot;fad&quot; diets.

Many of the diets listed below could fall into more than one subcategory. Where this is the case, it is noted in that diet&#x27;s entry.

===Low-calorie diets===

*5:2 diet: an intermittent fasting diet
* Intermittent fasting: Cycling between non-fasting and fasting as a method of calorie restriction.
* Body for Life: A calorie-control diet, promoted as part of the 12-week &quot;Body for Life&quot; program.
* Cookie diet: A calorie control diet in which low-fat cookies are eaten to quell hunger, often in place of a meal.
* The Hacker&#x27;s Diet: A calorie-control diet from &quot;The Hacker&#x27;s Diet&quot; by John Walker. The book suggests that the key to reaching and maintaining the desired weight is understanding and carefully monitoring calories consumed and used.
* Nutrisystem diet: The dietary element of the weight-loss plan from Nutrisystem, Inc. Nutrisystem distributes low-calorie meals, with specific ratios of fats, proteins and carbohydrates.
* Weight Watchers diet: Debuting in 1961, foods are assigned point values; dieters can eat any food with a point value provided they stay within their daily point limit.

====Very low calorie diets====
A very low calorie diet is consuming fewer than 800 calories per day. Such diets are normally followed under the supervision of a doctor. Zero-calorie diets are also included.

* Inedia (breatharian diet): A diet in which no food is consumed, based on the belief that &quot;prana&quot; but not food is necessary for human subsistence.
* KE diet (feeding tube diet): A diet in which an individual feeds through a feeding tube and does not eat anything.
* The Last Chance diet: General premise is that the dieter will consume only one low-calorie high protein beverage daily. This equated to no more than 400 calories per day.
* Tongue Patch Diet: Stitching a Marlex patch to the tongue to make eating painful. Daily calories are then limited to 800 per day maximum in liquid form.

===Low-carbohydrate diets===
* Atkins diet: A low-carbohydrate diet, popularized by nutritionist Robert Atkins in the late-20th and early-21st centuries. Proponents argue that this approach is a more successful way of losing weight than low-calorie diets; critics argue that a low-carb approach poses increased health risks. The Atkins diet consists of four phases (Induction, Balancing, Fine-Tuning and Maintenance) with a gradual increase in consumption of carbohydrates as the person goes through the phases.
* Dukan Diet: A multi-step diet based on high protein and limited carbohydrate consumption. It starts with two steps intended to facilitate short term weight loss, followed by two steps intended to consolidate these losses and return to a more balanced long-term diet.
*Kimkins: A heavily promoted diet for weight loss, found to be fraudulent.
*South Beach Diet: Diet developed by the Miami-based cardiologist Arthur Agatston in 2003, who says that the key to losing weight quickly and getting healthy is not cutting all carbohydrates and fats from the diet, but choosing the right carbs and the right fats.
*Stillman diet: A carbohydrate-restricted diet that predates the Atkins diet, allowing consumption of specific food ingredients.

===Low-fat diets===
*McDougall&#x27;s starch diet is a high calorie, high fiber, low fat diet that is based on starches such as potatoes, rice, and beans which excludes all animal foods and added vegetable oils. John A. McDougall draws on historical observation of how many civilizations around the world throughout time have thrived on starch foods.

==Crash diets==

Crash diets are very-low-calorie diets used for the purpose of very fast weight loss. They describe diet plans that involve making extreme, rapid changes to food consumption, but are also used as disparaging terms for common eating habits which are considered unhealthy. This diet is dangerous and can lead to sudden death when not done in a medically supervised setting. Several diets listed here are weight-loss diets which would also fit into other sections of this list. Where this is the case, it will be noted in that diet&#x27;s entry.
* Beverly Hills Diet: An extreme diet from 1981 which has only fruits in the first days, gradually increasing the selection of foods up to the sixth week.
* Cabbage soup diet: A low-calorie diet based on heavy consumption of cabbage soup. Considered a fad diet.
* Grapefruit diet: A fad diet begun in 1930, intended to facilitate weight loss, in which grapefruit is consumed in large quantities at meal times.
* Monotrophic diet: A diet that involves eating only one food item, or one type of food, for a period of time to achieve a desired weight reduction.
* Subway diet: A crash diet in which a person consumes Subway sandwiches in place of higher calorie fast foods. Made famous by convicted sex offender and former obese student Jared Fogle, who lost 245 pounds after replacing his meals with Subway sandwiches as part of an effort to lose weight.

==Detox diets==
Detox diets involve either not consuming or attempting to flush out substances that are considered unhelpful or harmful. Examples include restricting food consumption to foods without colorings or preservatives, taking supplements, or drinking large amounts of water. The latter practice in particular has drawn criticism, as drinking significantly more water than recommended levels can cause hyponatremia. There is no scientific evidence of any benefit from detox diets, and so they are considered to be pseudoscientific.

* Juice fasting: A form of detox diet, in which nutrition is obtained solely from fruit and vegetable juices. The health implications of such diets are disputed.
* Master Cleanse: A modified juice fast that substitutes tea and lemonade for food.

==Diets followed for medical reasons==
People&#x27;s dietary choices are sometimes affected by intolerance or allergy to certain types of food. There are also dietary patterns that might be recommended, prescribed or administered by medical professionals for people with specific medical needs.
* DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension): A recommendation that those with high blood pressure consume large quantities of fruits, vegetables, whole-grains and low fat dairy foods as part of their diet, and avoid sugar sweetened foods, red meat and fats. Promoted by the US Department of Health and Human Services, a United States government organisation.
* Diabetic diet: An umbrella term for diets recommended to people with diabetes. There is considerable disagreement in the scientific community as to what sort of diet is best for people with diabetes.
* Elemental diet: A medical, liquid-only diet, in which liquid nutrients are consumed for ease of ingestion.
* Elimination diet: A method of identifying foods which cause a person adverse effects, by process of elimination.
* Gluten-free diet: A diet which avoids the protein gluten, which is found in barley, rye and wheat. It is a medical treatment for gluten-related disorders, which include coeliac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia, dermatitis herpetiformis and wheat allergy.
* Gluten-free, casein-free diet: A gluten-free diet which also avoids casein, a protein commonly found in milk and cheese. This diet has been researched for efficacy in treatment of autism spectrum disorder.
* Healthy kidney diet: This diet is for those impacted with chronic kidney disease, those with only one kidney, those who have a kidney infection and those who may be suffering from some other kidney failure. This diet is not the dialysis diet, which is completely different. The healthy kidney diet restricts large amounts of protein, which are hard for the kidney to break down, but especially limits potassium and phosphorus-rich foods and beverages. Liquid intake is often limited as well.
* Ketogenic diet: A high-fat, low-carb diet, in which dietary and body fat is converted into energy. It is used as a medical treatment for refractory epilepsy.
* Liquid diet: A diet in which only liquids are consumed. May be administered by clinicians for medical reasons, such as after a gastric bypass or to prevent death through starvation from a hunger strike.
* Low-FODMAP diet: A diet that consists in the global restriction of all fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs).
* Soft diet
* Specific carbohydrate diet: A diet that aims to restrict the intake of complex carbohydrates such as found in grains and complex sugars.

== Fad diets ==
A fad diet is a diet that is popular for a time, similar to fads in fashion, without being a standard dietary recommendation, and often promising unreasonably fast weight loss or nonsensical health improvements. There is no single definition of what a fad diet is, encompassing a variety of diets with different approaches and evidence bases, and thus different outcomes, advantages and disadvantages, and it is ever-changing. Generally, fad diets promise short-term changes with little effort, and thus may lack educating consumers about whole-diet, whole lifestyle changes necessary for sustainable health benefits. Fad diets are often promoted with exaggerated claims, such as rapid weight loss of more than 1 kg/week or improving health by &quot;detoxification&quot;, or even dangerous claims.

Since the &quot;fad&quot; qualification varies over time, social, cultural and subjective view, this list cannot be exhaustive, and fad diets may continue or stop being fads, such as the Mediterranean diet. Some of them have therapeutic indications, such as epilepsy or obesity, and there is no one-size-fits-all diet that would be a panacea for everyone to lose weight or look better. Dieticians are a regulated profession that can distinguish nutritionally sound diets from unhealthy ones.

* Ovo-lacto vegetarianism: A vegetarian diet that includes eggs and dairy.
* Vegan diet: In addition to the abstentions of a vegetarian diet, vegans do not use any product produced by animals, such as eggs, dairy products, or honey. The vegan philosophy and lifestyle is broader than just the diet and also includes abstaining from using any products tested on animals and often campaigning for animal welfare and animal rights.

===Semi-vegetarian diets===
* Semi-vegetarianism: A predominantly vegetarian diet, in which meat is occasionally consumed. This includes &quot;flexitarian&quot;, reducetarian and demitarian diets Sometimes semi-vegetarian and flexitarian diets are defined as distinct from one another, where the former is defined as abstaining from red meat while the latter simply entails only eating meat infrequently.

==Other diets==
* Alkaline diet: The avoidance of relatively acidic foods – foods with low pH levels – such as alcohol, caffeine, dairy, fungi, grains, meat, and sugar. Proponents believe such a diet may have health benefits; critics consider the arguments to have no scientific basis.
* Clean eating
*Climatarian diet: A diet focused on reducing the carbon footprint of the consumed food, particularly through the consumption of locally sourced food and the avoidance of beef and lamb meat.

*Eat-clean diet: Focuses on eating foods without preservatives, and on mixing lean proteins with complex carbohydrates.
* Gerson therapy: A form of alternative medicine, the diet is low salt, low fat and vegetarian, and also involves taking specific supplements. It was developed by Max Gerson, who claimed the therapy could cure cancer and chronic, degenerative diseases. These claims have not been scientifically proven, and they can cause serious illness and death.
* The Graham Diet: A high-fiber vegetarian diet which promotes whole-wheat flour and discourages the consumption of stimulants such as alcohol and caffeine. Promoted by Sylvester Graham beginning in 1830.

* Locavore diet: a neologism describing the eating of food that is locally produced, and not moved long distances to market. An example of this was explored in the book 100-Mile Diet, in which the authors only consumed food grown within 100 miles of their residence for a year. People who follow this type of diet are sometimes known as locavores.

* Smart For Life
* Sonoma diet: A diet based on portion control and centered around consuming &quot;power foods&quot;
* SparkPeople diet
* Sugar Busters!: A 1995 diet that focuses on restricting the consumption of refined carbohydrates, particularly sugars.
* Western pattern diet (WPD): &#x27;Default&#x27; diet in many developed countries, especially the Anglosphere. The name is from &quot;Western world&quot; and is interchanged with &quot;standard American diet&quot; and &quot;meat-sweet diet&quot; due to the high amount of meat (total), red meats (particularly), dairy, sweets and refined cereals. Subpar intake of whole grains, legumes, tree nuts, produce and seafood is the norm. WPDs are distinguished from other unbalanced diets by heavy inclusion of &#x27;junk food&#x27; and other ultra-processed foods that generally provide substantial empty calories, carbohydrates, saturated fat, industrial trans fat, added sugar/free sugars, added salt, artificial flavor/sweetener and other processing ingredients. Archetypal examples include: RTE cereals, white breads, fast food, other convenience meals, cured meat dishes, smoked/fried meats, fried dough foods, shallow/deep fried potatoes, other foods intensely fried in rendered fat/refined oil, sugary/fatty discretionary foods (e.g., sauce, candy), colas and other sweetened soft drinks.

<text>The Lapiths (; , &quot;Lapithai&quot;, Λαπίθης) were a group of legendary people in Greek mythology, who lived in Thessaly in the valley of the Pineios and on the mountain Pelion. They were believed to have descended from the mythical Lapithes, brother of Centaurus, with the two heroes giving their names to the races of the Lapiths and the Centaurs respectively. The Lapiths are best known for their involvement in the &quot;Centauromachy&quot; (), a mythical fight that broke out between them and the Centaurs during Pirithous and Hippodamia&#x27;s wedding. 

==Mythology==
=== Origin ===
The Lapiths were an Aeolian tribe who, like the Myrmidons, were natives of Thessaly. The genealogies make them a kindred people with the centaurs: In one version, Lapithes (Λαπίθης) and Centaurus (Κένταυρος) were said to be twin sons of the god Apollo and the nymph Stilbe, daughter of the river god Peneus. Lapithes was a valiant warrior, but Centaurus was a deformed being who later mated with mares from whom the race of half-man, half-horse centaurs came. Lapithes was the eponymous ancestor of the Lapith people, and his descendants include Lapith warriors and kings, such as Ixion, Pirithous, Caeneus, and Coronus, and the seers Ampycus and his son Mopsus.

In the &quot;Iliad&quot; the Lapiths send forty crewed ships to join the Greek fleet in the Trojan War, commanded by Polypoetes (son of Pirithous) and Leonteus (son of Coronus, son of Caeneus). The mother of Pirithous, the Lapith queen in the generation before the Trojan War, was Dia, daughter of Eioneus or Deioneus; Ixion was the father of Pirithous, but like many heroic figures, Pirithous had an immortal as well as a mortal father.
Zeus was his immortal father, but the god had to assume a stallion&#x27;s form to cover Dia for, like their half-horse cousins, the Lapiths were horsemen in the grasslands of Thessaly, famous for its horses. The Lapiths were credited with inventing the bridle&#x27;s bit. The Lapith King Pirithous was marrying the horsewoman Hippodameia, whose name means &quot;tamer of horses&quot;, at the wedding feast that made a war, the Centauromachy, famous.

===Centauromachy===

In the Centauromachy, the Lapiths battle with the Centaurs at the wedding feast of Pirithous. The Centaurs had been invited, but, unused to wine, their wild nature came to the fore. When the bride, Hippodamia, was presented to greet the guests, the centaur Eurytion leapt up and attempted to abduct her. All the other centaurs were up in a moment, straddling women and boys. In the battle that ensued, Theseus came to the Lapiths&#x27; aid. They cut off Eurytion&#x27;s ears and nose and threw him out. After the battle the defeated Centaurs were expelled from Thessaly to the northwest.

The Lapith Caeneus was originally a young woman named Caenis and the favorite of Poseidon, who changed her into a man at her request, and made Caeneus into an invulnerable warrior. Such warrior women, indistinguishable from men, were familiar among the Scythian horsemen too. In the battle with the centaurs Caeneus proved invulnerable, until the Centaurs crushed him with rocks and trunks of trees. He disappeared into the depths of the earth unharmed and was released as a sandy-headed bird.

In later contests, the Centaurs were not so easily beaten. Mythic references explained the presence into historic times of primitive Lapiths in Malea and in the brigand stronghold of Pholoe in Elis as remnants of groups driven there by the centaurs. Some historic Greek cities bore names connected with Lapiths, and the Kypselides of Corinth claimed descent from Cæneus, while the Phylaides of Attica claimed for progenitor Koronus the Lapith.

== In art ==

As Greek myth became more mediated through philosophy, the battle between Lapiths and Centaurs took on aspects of the interior struggle between civilized and wild behavior, made concrete in the Lapiths&#x27; understanding of the right usage of God-given wine, which must be tempered with water and drunk not to excess. The Greek sculptors of the school of Pheidias conceived of the battle of the Lapiths and Centaurs as a struggle between mankind and mischievous monsters, and symbolical of the great conflict between the civilized Greeks and &quot;barbarians&quot;. Battles between Lapiths and Centaurs were depicted in the sculptured metopes on the Parthenon, recalling Athenian Theseus&#x27; treaty of mutual admiration with Pirithous the Lapith, leader of the Magnetes, and on Zeus&#x27; temple at Olympia The Battle of the Lapiths and centaurs was a familiar &quot;symposium&quot; theme for the vase-painters.

A sonnet vividly evoking the battle by the French poet José María de Heredia (1842–1905) was included in his volume &quot;Les Trophées&quot;.
In the Renaissance, the battle became a favorite theme for artists: An excuse to display close-packed bodies in violent confrontation. The young Michelangelo executed a marble bas-relief of the subject in Florence about 1492. Piero di Cosimo&#x27;s panel &quot;Battle of Centaurs and Lapiths&quot;, now at the National Gallery, London, was painted during the following decade. If it was originally part of a marriage chest, or &quot;cassone&quot;, it was perhaps an uneasy subject for a festive wedding commemoration. A frieze with a Centauromachy was also painted by Luca Signorelli in his &quot;Virgin Enthroned with Saints&quot; (1491), inspired by a Roman sarcophagus found at Cortona, in Tuscany, during the early 15th century.

<text>The Lernaean Hydra or Hydra of Lerna (), more often known simply as the Hydra, is a serpentine lake monster in Greek mythology and Roman mythology. Its lair was the lake of Lerna in the Argolid, which was also the site of the myth of the Danaïdes. Lerna was reputed to be an entrance to the Underworld, and archaeology has established it as a sacred site older than Mycenaean Argos. In the canonical Hydra myth, the monster is killed by Heracles (Hercules) as the second of his Twelve Labors.

According to Hesiod, the Hydra was the offspring of Typhon and Echidna. It had poisonous breath and blood so virulent that even its scent was deadly. The Hydra possessed many heads, the exact number of which varies according to the source. Later versions of the Hydra story add a regeneration feature to the monster: for every head chopped off, the Hydra would regrow two heads. Heracles required the assistance of his nephew Iolaus to cut off all of the monster&#x27;s heads and burn the neck using a sword and fire.

==Development of the myth==
The oldest extant Hydra narrative appears in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, while the oldest images of the monster are found on a pair of bronze fibulae dating to c. 700 BC. In both these sources, the main motifs of the Hydra myth are already present: a multi-headed serpent that is slain by Heracles and Iolaus. While these fibulae portray a six-headed Hydra, its number of heads was first fixed in writing by Alcaeus (c. 600 BC), who gave it nine heads. Simonides, writing a century later, increased the number to fifty, while Euripides, Virgil, and others did not give an exact figure. Heraclitus the Paradoxographer rationalized the myth by suggesting that the Hydra would have been a single-headed snake accompanied by its offspring.

Like the initial number of heads, the monster&#x27;s capacity to regenerate lost heads varies with time and author. The first mention of this ability of the Hydra occurs with Euripides, where the monster grew back a pair of heads for each one severed by Heracles. In the &quot;Euthydemus&quot; of Plato, Socrates likens Euthydemus and his brother Dionysidorus to a Hydra of a sophistical nature who grows two arguments for every one refuted. Palaephatus, Ovid, and Diodorus Siculus concur with Euripides, while Servius has the Hydra grow back three heads each time; the &quot;Suda&quot; does not give a number. Depictions of the monster dating to c. 500 BC show it with a double tail as well as multiple heads, suggesting the same regenerative ability at work, but no literary accounts have this feature.

The Hydra had many parallels in ancient Near Eastern religions. In particular, Sumerian, Babylonian, and Assyrian mythology celebrated the deeds of the war and hunting god Ninurta, whom the &quot;Angim&quot; credited with slaying 11 monsters on an expedition to the mountains, including a seven-headed serpent (possibly identical with the Mushmahhu) and Bashmu, whose constellation (despite having a single Head) was later associated by the Greeks with the Hydra. The constellation is also sometimes associated in Babylonian contexts with Marduk&#x27;s dragon, the Mushhushshu.

==Second Labor of Heracles==
Eurystheus, the king of the Tiryns, sent Heracles (or Hercules) to slay the Hydra, which Hera had raised just to slay Heracles. Upon reaching the swamp near Lake Lerna, where the Hydra dwelt, Heracles covered his mouth and nose with a cloth to protect himself from the poisonous fumes. He shot flaming arrows into the Hydra&#x27;s lair, the spring of Amymone, a deep cave from which it emerged only to terrorize neighboring villages. He then confronted the Hydra, wielding either a harvesting sickle (according to some early vase-paintings), a sword, or his famed club. Heracles then attempted to cut off the Hydra&#x27;s heads but each time that he did so, one or two more heads (depending on the source) would grow back in its place. The Hydra was invulnerable as long as it retained at least one head.

The struggle is described by the mythographer &quot;Apollodorus&quot;: realizing that he could not defeat the Hydra in this way, Heracles called on his nephew Iolaus for help. His nephew then came upon the idea (possibly inspired by Athena) of using a firebrand to scorch the neck stumps after each decapitation. Heracles cut off each head and Iolaus cauterized the open stumps. Seeing that Heracles was winning the struggle, Hera sent a giant crab to distract him. He crushed it under his mighty foot. The Hydra&#x27;s one immortal head was cut off with a golden sword given to Heracles by Athena. Heracles placed the head—still alive and writhing—under a great rock on the sacred way between Lerna and Elaius, and dipped his arrows in the Hydra&#x27;s poisonous blood. Thus, his second task was complete.

The alternate version of this myth is that after cutting off one head he then dipped his sword in its neck and used its venom to burn each head so it could not grow back. Hera, upset that Heracles had slain the beast she raised to kill him, placed it in the dark blue vault of the sky as the constellation Hydra. She then turned the crab into the constellation Cancer.

Heracles would later use arrows dipped in the Hydra&#x27;s poisonous blood to kill other foes during his remaining labors, such as Stymphalian Birds and the giant Geryon. He later used one to kill the centaur Nessus; and Nessus&#x27; tainted blood was applied to the Tunic of Nessus, by which the centaur had his posthumous revenge. Both Strabo and Pausanias report that the stench of the river Anigrus in Elis, making all the fish of the river inedible, was reputed to be due to the Hydra&#x27;s poison, washed from the arrows Heracles used on the centaur.

When Eurystheus, the agent of Hera who was assigning The Twelve Labors to Heracles, found out that Iolaus had handed Heracles the firebrand, he declared that the labor had not been completed alone and as a result did not count toward the ten labors set for him. The mythic element is an equivocating attempt to resolve the submerged conflict between an ancient ten labors and a more recent twelve.

==Constellation==

Greek and Roman writers related that Hera placed the Hydra and crab as constellations in the night sky after Heracles slew him. When the sun is in the sign of Cancer (Latin for &quot;The Crab&quot;), the constellation Hydra has its head nearby. In fact, both constellations derived from the earlier Babylonian signs: Bashmu (&quot;The Venomous Snake&quot;) and Alluttu (&quot;The Crayfish&quot;).

<doc id="84257" wikidata="Q14957246" url="?curid=84257" title="Hunza (princely state)">
<text>Hunza (, ), also known as Kanjut (; ), was a princely state in the Gilgit Baltistan region of Pakistan. Initially, it functioned as a principality and subsequently became a princely state under a subsidiary alliance with the British India starting in 1892 and continuing until August 1947. For a brief period of three months, it remained unaligned after gaining independence, and then from November 1947 until 1974, it retained its status as a princely state within Pakistan. The territory of Hunza now constitutes the northernmost part of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan.

The princely state bordered the Gilgit Agency to the south, the former princely state of Nagar to the east, Xinjiang, China, to the northeast and Afghanistan to the northwest. The state&#x27;s capital was Baltit (also known as Karimabad). The princely state of Hunza is now the Hunza District in the Gilgit Baltistan region of Pakistan.

== History ==

Hunza was an independent principality for centuries. It was ruled by the Mirs of Hunza, who took the title of Thum.

The Hunzai people maintained their relationship with China, recognizing China as their suzerain from around 1760 or 1761. The rulers of Hunza claimed a lineage, tracing their descent back to Alexander the Great. In their view, both they and the Emperor of China held the most pivotal leadership roles in the world. Historically, there were instances when the Kanjutis, the residents of Hunza, conducted raids on mountainous regions within the Karakoram and Kunlun Mountains, including areas like Xaidulla, where certain nomadic Kirghiz groups resided. These raids sometimes resulted in the Kirghiz being taken as slaves and subsequently sold to the Chinese authorities.

From 1847, the Mir of Hunza gave nominal allegiance to China. Mir Ghazanfur Khan helped China in the fight against the Uyghur separatist Afaqi Khoja revolts in Yarkand, after which China granted Hunza a jagir (land grant) in Yarkand and paid him a subsidy. In 1860, the Mir paid tribute to the Dogras after their conquest of Gilgit, and Hunza became a tributary to both Kashmir and China. The last fully independent ruler, Mir Safdar Khan, who ruled from 1886, escaped to China after an invasion by the British.

In the late 19th century Hunza became embroiled in the Great Game, the rivalry between Britain and Russia for control of the northern approaches to India. The British suspected Russian involvement &quot;with the Rulers of the petty States on the northern boundary of Kashmir&quot;; In 1888, the Russian captain Bronislav Grombchevsky visited Hunza, and the following year the British captain Francis Younghusband visited Hunza to express British displeasure at Kanjuti raids in the Raskam. Younghusband formed a low opinion of the ruler, Safdar Ali, describing him as &quot;a cur at heart and unworthy of ruling so fine a race as the people of Hunza&quot;.
In 1891, the British mounted the Hunza-Nagar Campaign and gained control of Hunza and the neighbouring valley of Nagar. The Mir, Safdar Khan, fled to China with his two brothers, Prince Muhammad Nafis Khan and Prince Muhammad Nazim Khan.

Prince Muhammad Nafis Khan was the primary claimant of the Mir-ship of Hunza as the eldest son of Mir Ghazan Khan I. However, the British installed his younger brother Muhammad Nazim Khan as Mir in September 1892. Hunza became a princely state in a subsidiary alliance with British India, a status it retained until 1947. The Kuomintang Republic of China government engaged in secret negotiations with the Mir of Hunza over restoring the state&#x27;s previous relationship with China, amidst the partitioning of British India, with the Hunza state independent from India and Pakistan. The Kuomintang also plotted to expand its influence into Kashmir, taking advantage of the weakness of the newly independent India. However, due to the war of 1947 in Kashmir, the Mir of Hunza changed his mind and acceded to Pakistan, after a coup against India in Gilgit.

=== Territorial claims ===
Historically the people of Hunza cultivated and grazed areas to the north and the Mir claimed those areas as part of Hunza&#x27;s territories. Those areas included the Taghdumbash Pamir and the Raskam Valley.

According to Kanjuti traditions, as related by McMahon, the Mir&#x27;s eighth ancestor, Shah Salim Khan, pursued nomadic Khirghiz thieves to Tashkurghan and defeated them. &quot;To celebrate this victory, Shah Salim Khan erected a stone cairn at Dafdar and sent a trophy of a Khirghiz head to the Chinese with a message that Hunza territory extended as far as Dafdar&quot;. The Kanjutis were already in effective possession of the Raskam and no question had been raised about it. The Mir&#x27;s claims went a good deal beyond a mere right of cultivation. He &quot;asserts that forts were built by the Hunza people without any objection or interference from the Chinese at Dafdar, Qurghan, Ujadhbhai, Azar on the Yarkand River and at three or four other places in Raskam.&quot;

McMahon was able roughly to define the territorial limits of Kanjut. &quot;The boundaries of Taghdumbash, Khunjerab, and Raskam, as claimed by the Kanjuts, are the following: the northern watershed of the Taghdumbash Pamir from the Wakhjir Pass through the Baiyik peak to Dafdar, thence across the river to the Zankan nullah; thence through Mazar and over the range to Urok, a point on the Yarkand river between Sibjaida and Itakturuk. Thence it runs along the northern watershed of the Raskam valley to the junction of the Bazar Dara River and the Yarkand River. From thence southwards over the mountains to the Mustagh River leaving the Aghil Dewan or Aghil Pass within Hunza limits.&quot;

In 1898 Captain H. P. P. Deasy substantially corroborated McMahon&#x27;s information. Deasy resigned his commission to devote himself to trans-Himalayan exploration. An item of special interest was Deasy&#x27;s description of the limits of Raskam. Starting from Aghil Dewan or pass, in the Karakoram range, the dividing line ran north-east to Bazar Dara, where it met the Yarkand River. He found an outpost built of earth at Bazar Dara, surmounted by a Chinese flag (by 1898 the Chinese had intruded to the area south of the Kun Lun Mountains with a few unarmed Kirghiz in occupation. This marked the boundary claimed by China. From there the line ran &quot;along the northern watershed of the Raskam valley to Dafdar in the Taghdumbash Pamir, to the north of the mills at that place, and thence to the Baiyik peak. Deasy also came upon clear evidence of what could only have been Kanjuti occupation. South of Azgar &quot;many ruins of houses, old irrigation channels and fields now no longer tilled, testify to Raskam having formerly been inhabited and cultivated&quot;. Anyone familiar with the care with which the Kanjuts cultivate every available strip of land in Hunza would have no hesitation in regarding this as proof of long standing Kanjuti occupation. The remains could not have been attributed to the Kirghiz; they were unfamiliar with the state of art. &quot;Seven locations in the Raskam were involved. Azgar and Ursur on the right bank, and five others on the left, that is on the Mustagh-Karakoram side-Kukbash, Kirajilga, Ophrang, Uroklok, and Oitughrak, extending from Sarakamish, north of Kunjerab pass to Bazar Dara, north of the Arghil pass&quot;. He said it was an area of about .

The Chinese completed the reconquest of Xinjiang in 1878. Before they lost southern parts of the province to Yakub Beg in 1863, their practical authority, as Ney Elias and Younghusband consistently maintained, had never extended south of their outposts at Sanju and Kilian along the northern foothills of the Kun Lun range. Nor did they establish a known presence to the south of the line of outposts in the twelve years immediately following their return. Ney Elias, who had been Joint Commissioner in Ladakh for several years, noted on 21 September 1889 that he had met the Chinese in 1879 and 1880 when he visited Kashgar. &quot;They told me that they considered their line of &#x27;chatze&#x27;, or posts, as their frontier – viz., Kugiar, Kilian, Sanju, Kiria, etc.- and that they had no concern with what lay beyond the mountains&quot; i.e. the Kun Lun range in northern Kashmir.

In March 1899 the British proposed, in a Note from Sir Claude MacDonald to China, a new boundary between China and British India. The Note proposed that China should relinquish its claims to suzerainty over Hunza, and in return Hunza should relinquish its claims to most of the Taghdumbash and Raskam districts. The Chinese did not respond to the note.

Until 1937 the inhabitants of the Taghdumbash Pamir paid tribute to the Mir of Hunza, who exercised control over the pastures,

=== Relationship with Jammu and Kashmir ===
Although never ruled directly by neighbouring Jammu and Kashmir, Hunza was a vassal of Jammu and Kashmir from the time of Maharaja Ranbir Singh of Jammu and Kashmir in 1860. The Mirs of Hunza sent an annual tribute to China and the Mirs of Nagar to Maharaja Kashmir. Durbar until 1947, and along with the ruler of Nagar were considered to be among the most loyal vassals of the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. According to Emma Nicholson, &quot;All the evidence points to the fact that Gilgit and Baltistan region were constituent parts of Jammu and Kashmir by 1877&quot;. They were under the sovereignty of the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir and remained in this princely domain until the date of accession &quot;in its entirety to the new Dominion of India&quot; on 26 October 1947.
Further, this fact is confirmed and reiterated from the correspondence of the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir dated 26 October 1947 with Lord Mountbatten, Governor General of India which states that the state of Jammu and Kashmir has a common boundary with the &quot;Soviet Republic&quot;, and the said statement also determines the fact that &quot;inter alia&quot; Gilgit and Kanjut (which includes the Raskam, Hunza valley and Taghdumbash) are integral parts of Jammu and Kashmir. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had also made a similar statement that &quot;Jammu and Kashmir&#x27;s Northern frontiers, as you are aware, run in common with those of three countries, Afghanistan, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and China&quot;. These statements of the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir as well as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru also have a bearing on the territorial extent of Kanjut as well as the rest of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir at the time of her accession &quot;in its entirety to the new Dominion of India&quot; on 26 October and Section (4) of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir which pertains to the territorial extent of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir also unequivocally states that &quot;The territory of the State shall comprise all the territories which on the fifteenth day of August, 1947, were under the sovereignty or suzerainty of the Ruler of the State&quot;.

===Accession to Pakistan===
On 3 November, 1947, the ruler, Mohammad Jamal Khan sent a telegram to Mohammad Ali Jinnah acceding his state to Pakistan. It stated:

&quot;I declare with pleasure on behalf of myself and my State accession to Pakistan.&quot;

== List of rulers ==

The hereditary rulers, the &quot;Mirs&quot; were assisted by a council of Wazirs or ministers. Details of early rulers are uncertain, with the first definite dates from 1750 onwards.

== Geography ==

The Hunza valley is situated at an elevation of 2,438 metres (7,999 feet). The former capital Baltit has an elevation of 2477 metres (8129 feet). Both Baltit and an earlier fort, Altit Fort, have been extensively restored and are major tourist attractions in the region.

For many centuries, Hunza has provided the quickest access to Swat and Gandhara for a person travelling on foot. The route was impassable to baggage animals; only human porters could get through, and then only with permission from the locals.

Hunza was easily defended as the paths were often less than half a metre (about 18&quot;) wide. The high mountain paths often crossed bare cliff faces on logs wedged into cracks in the cliff, with stones balanced on top. They were also constantly exposed to regular damage from weather and falling rocks. These were the much feared &quot;hanging passageways&quot; of the early Chinese histories that terrified all, including several famous Chinese Buddhist monks.

==Demographics==
Most of the people of Hunza are Ismaili Muslims. The official language of the state was Persian until 1947, when it was replaced by Urdu. The common language of Hunza is Burushaski, while Wakhi and Shina languages are spoken in Upper Hunza and Lower Hunza respectively. Urdu is also understood in Hunza.

<text>Phocis (; ; ) is one of the regional units of Greece. It is part of the administrative region of Central Greece. It stretches from the western mountainsides of Parnassus on the east to the mountain range of Vardousia on the west, upon the Gulf of Corinth. It is named after the ancient region of Phocis, but the modern regional unit also includes parts of ancient Aetolia, Locris and Doris.

==Geography==
Modern Phocis has an area of , of which are forested, are plains, and the remainder is mountainous. The massive ridge of Parnassus (, which traverses the heart of the country, divides it into two distinct portions. The neighbouring prefectures are Aetolia-Acarnania to the west, Phthiotis to the north and Boeotia to the east. It also shares a tiny border with Evrytania. Much of the south and east are deforested and rocky and mountainous while the valley runs from Itea up to Amfissa. Forests and green spaces are to the west, the central part and the north.

Its reservoir is the Mornos Dam on the Mornos river. It covers nearly 1 km to 3 km2. It was completed in the 1960s, and GR-48 was extended to pass through the dam.

The roads of Phocis are:
*Greek National Road 3, NE
*Greek National Road 27, Cen., N
*Greek National Road 48, SW, Cen., SE
*E65, SW, S, SE

==Administration==
===Prefecture===
The prefecture of Phocis was formed in 1947 from the previous Phthiotis and Phocis Prefecture. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, a new regional unit Phocis was formed from the 1947 prefecture Phocis () without a change of territory.

===Municipalities===
In 2011 the regional unit Phocis was subdivided into 2 municipalities according to the table below.
===Former provinces===
The pre-2011 municipalities had been organized into two provinces:
*Province of Dorida - Lidoriki
*Province of Parnassida - Amfissa
These were abolished. Provinces no longer hold any legal status in Greece.

==Demographics==
Modern Phocis was inhabited by several Greek tribes since antiquity, mainly by Phocians, Locrians and Dorians, which were intermingled and formed the present-day Phocian population, with a unique linguistic and cultural heritage, frequently mentioned as Roumeliotes.

===Population statistics===
With a population of 40,343 (2001), it is one of Greece&#x27;s least populous regional units, and has a population density of . In the summer months, the population nearly doubles due to the influx of tourists.

Most of the villages are in the south, the southeast and the east, especially in the areas between Amfissa and Itea. The north and the west are the least populated.

===Notable people===
*Alexander of Phocis
*Giannis Skarimpas (September 28, 1893 in Agia Efthymia Parnassidos – January 21, 1984)
*Nikolaos Makarezos (1919 – August 3, 2009)
*Eleni Karaindrou

===Sporting teams===
Here are the most popular sporting teams in the prefecture. All of the teams are under the Phocis Football Clubs Association in which it existed since 1985 after the separation and dissolution of the Phocis-Phtiotis Football Guild Union.

*Androutsos Gravia - Gravia
*Asteras Iteas - Itea
*Doxa Desfina - Desfina
*Isaia Desfina - Desfina
*Diagoras Polydrosos - Polydrosos
*Dorikos Nea Dorida - Nea Dorida
*Fokikos - Amfissa
*A.O. Malesina - Malesina

<doc id="84260" wikidata="Q1180888" url="?curid=84260" title="Iapyx">
<text>In Greek and Roman mythology, Iapyx (from Greek Ἰάπυξ, &quot;gen&quot;.: Ἰάπυγος), &quot;Iapux&quot; or &quot;Iapis&quot; was a favorite of Apollo. The god wanted to confer upon him the gift of prophecy, the lyre, etc.; but Iapyx, wishing to prolong the life of his father, preferred the more tranquil art of healing to all the others.

Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; (XII: 391–402) relates that Iapyx was Aeneas&#x27;s healer during the Trojan War and then escaped to Italy after the war, founding Apulia.

== Family ==
His descent is unclear. He was either:
*a son of Iasus, or
*the son of Lycaon, which would make him the brother of Daunius and Peucetius (who went as leaders of a colony to Italy), or
*a Cretan, from whom the Cretans who migrated to Italy derived the name of Iapyges, or
* a son of Daedalus either:
** by his wife, thus making him a full-brother of Icarus;
** by another Cretan woman.

== Other use ==
Iapyx is also the name of a minor Greek wind god, the north-west or west-north-west wind. Virgil relates this Iapyx to the wind that carried the fleeing Cleopatra home to Egypt after her loss at the battle of Actium. Horace prays that Iapyx may safely carry his friend Virgil&#x27;s ship to Greece.

<text>In Greek mythology, Ilione or Iliona () was a Trojan princess who later became a queen of Thrace. She is briefly mentioned in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;: Aeneas gives her scepter to Dido.

== Family ==
In the &quot;Fabulae&quot; by Hyginus, Ilione is listed among the children of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy. Her husband was the Thracian king Polymestor.

== Mythology ==
Ilione played a significant role in a version of the story of her younger brother Polydorus. 

She and her husband, Polymestor, were entrusted by her parents to the care of the young prince, Polydorus. Ilione, who already had a son of her own, Deipylus, brought her brother up as her son, and her son as her brother, thinking that if anything happened to one of them, she could return the other one to her parents in any case. So when Polymestor was instigated by the Greeks to kill the son of Priam, he killed Deipylus instead, his own son, taking him for Polydorus. The real Polydorus thus survived and escaped. Later, he went to inquire the oracle at Delphi about his parents, and was answered that his native city had been destroyed, father killed and mother enslaved. Still thinking that he was the son of Polymestor and Ilione, Polydorus thought that the oracle must have been wrong and asked Ilione about it. She told him all the truth and suggested that he should take revenge on Polymestor; Polydorus then blinded and killed him.

Ilione was said to have eventually committed suicide, grieving at her parents&#x27; deaths.

Her story was the subject of early Roman tragedies by Pacuvius and Accius.

<text>Arnaeus (; ) is a character in Greek mythology.

==Mythology==
Arnaeus, or Irus, as he is referred to for his connection as a messenger to the deity Iris, is a character in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. He is a beggar in Ithaca who is willing to run messages for the Suitors of Penelope. 

He encounters Odysseus, disguised as a beggar, in Book 18 of the &quot;Odyssey.&quot; He insults him, perceiving him to be a threat as another beggar, and Odysseus rebukes him. They argue back and forth until the suitor Antinous notices the confrontation and declares that the winner of their fight will be given food and permission to sit with the suitors. 

Odysseus removed his rags and tied them around his waist, revealing a surprisingly muscular body because Athena was standing close by making him appear bigger and stronger than he was. When Irus saw this he was intimidated; Antinous told him that should he lose, he would be sent to King Echetus, &quot;the maimer of all men&quot;, who would cut off Irus&#x27;s nose and ears and feed his vitals to the dogs. The suitors pushed Irus towards Odysseus, who entertained the idea of killing Irus, but decided he should just knock him out so the suitors would not suspect anything (it is not disclosed whether Antinous follows through with this threat after Irus&#x27;s defeat, although the audience, congratulating Odysseus on his victory, say &quot;soon shall we take him to the mainland to King Echetus&quot;). Irus aimed a punch at Odysseus but before he could do anything, Odysseus hit him below the ear, crushing his jawbone. Irus crumpled and Odysseus dragged him outside the hall, leaned him up against the courtyard wall and told him to sit there and scare off the pigs and dogs. He also threatened that if Irus did not stop pushing around the other beggars, things would get worse. Irus&#x27;s appearance within the epic develops the Homeric themes of punishing the inhospitable and appearances versus reality.

<doc id="84266" wikidata="Q753902" url="?curid=84266" title="Ismene">
<text>In Greek mythology, Ismene (; ) is a Theban princess. She is the daughter and half-sister of Oedipus, king of Thebes, daughter and granddaughter of Jocasta, and sister of Antigone, Eteocles, and Polynices. She appears in several tragic plays of Sophocles: at the end of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, in &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot; and in &quot;Antigone&quot;. She also appears at the end of Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;.

== Mythology ==
=== Early works ===
The seventh-century BC poet Mimnermus accounts that Ismene was murdered by Tydeus, one of the Seven against Thebes. In this account, Ismene and her lover Theoclymenus met outside of the city during the siege. Tydeus had been told their whereabouts by the goddess Athena, and apprehended Ismene while Theoclymenus escaped. While she begged for sympathy, Tydeus was unaffected by her pleas and killed her. This tradition cannot be reconciled with the events depicted in later works by Aeschylus and Sophocles, in which Ismene appears alive after the battle is over and Tydeus is dead; it is also incompatible with Ismene&#x27;s later timid and meek characterization.

This version is mentioned in no other extant classical writing, but the scene is represented on a sixth-century BC Corinthian black-figure amphora now housed in the Louvre. The vase depicts Tydeus brandishing his sword at Ismene, who is nude and reclining on a couch, while Theoclymenus flees and looks back, not at Ismene, but at Tydeus&#x27;s sword.

In another tradition by early fifth-century poet Ion of Chios, Eteocles&#x27;s son Laodamas burned Ismene alive together with Antigone inside Hera&#x27;s temple.

=== In Sophocles ===
==== Oedipus Rex ====
Ismene is not named, but is seen at the end of Oedipus Rex as her father/brother laments the &quot;shame&quot; and &quot;sorrow&quot; he is leaving her and her sister. Oedipus begs Creon to watch over them, but in his grief reaches to take them with him as he is led away. Creon prevents him from taking his daughters out of the city with him.

==== Oedipus at Colonus ====
Ismene appears in Oedipus at Colonus to tell her father of the situation in Thebes and the rivalry of his sons. She explains that Eteocles has taken the throne from Polynices and driven him out of the city. As a result of this, Polynices gathered his own army to either take back the city &quot;or to die there with honor.&quot; According to the Oracle of Delphi, the location where Oedipus is buried will determine the result of the war between the brothers. Ismene tells her father that Creon plans to have him buried on the border of Thebes so that they will have the desirable outcome. Hearing this, Oedipus curses his sons and refuses to leave Colonus.

The chorus (in this play the elders of Colonus) tell him that because he has walked on the sacred ground of the Eumenides, he has to &quot;perform rites of purification.&quot; Due to his blindness and age, Oedipus is unable to fulfill this task and asks one of his daughters to instead. Ismene agrees and exits to do so.

Later in the play, in an attempt to force Oedipus to return to Thebes, Creon tells him that he has seized Ismene and takes Antigone away as well. However, Theseus and the Athenians overpower them and exit to free the girls.

Ismene appears again at the end of the play with her sister as they mourn the death of their father and lament that they cannot join him. Theseus tells them that Oedipus has been buried but the location is secret and he has forbidden that they be told of it. Antigone resolves to return to Thebes, and Ismene goes with her.

==== Antigone ====
In the opening scene of the play Antigone tells Ismene of her plans to bury their brother Polynices, and asks her to join her. While Ismene laments the fate of Polynices&#x27; corpse, she refuses to defy the laws of the city. She advises her sister to be secretive if she is determined to take this course of action, and says she will do the same. Antigone, however, tells her not to keep silent but to tell everyone in the city. Ismene does not stop her sister, but makes her opinion of her foolishness clear.

Once Antigone is caught, in spite of her betrothal to his son Haemon, Creon decrees that she is to be buried alive. Ismene then declares that she has aided Antigone and wants to share her fate, though she did not participate in the crime. Antigone refuses to let her be martyred for a cause she did not stand up for, telling her to live. Antigone expresses that while Ismene&#x27;s &quot;choices seemed right to some--others agreed with [hers],&quot; but Ismene tells her that the both of them were &quot;equally wrong.&quot;

=== Seven Against Thebes ===
Aeschylus&#x27; play, &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;, depicts the war and demise of Eteocles and Polynices. At the end of the play the Chorus narrates Ismene and Antigone entering to sing a funeral dirge together for both of their brothers. While Antigone exits with the First Semichorus, escorting the body of Polynices, Ismene and the Second Semichorus exit with the body of Eteocles.

<text>John Kenneth Galbraith (October 15, 1908 – April 29, 2006), also known as Ken Galbraith, was a Canadian-American economist, diplomat, public official, and intellectual. His books on economic topics were bestsellers from the 1950s through the 2000s. As an economist, he leaned toward post-Keynesian economics from an institutionalist perspective. He served as the deputy director of the powerful Office of Price Administration (OPA) during World War II in charge of stabilizing all prices, wages and rents in the American economy, to combat the threat of inflation and hoarding during a time of shortages and rationing, a task which was successfully accomplished.

Galbraith was a long-time Harvard faculty member and stayed with Harvard University for half a century as a professor of economics. He was a prolific author and wrote four dozen books, including several novels, and published more than a thousand articles and essays on various subjects. Among his works was a trilogy on economics, &quot;American Capitalism&quot; (1952), &quot;The Affluent Society&quot; (1958), and &quot;The New Industrial State&quot; (1967).

Galbraith was active in Democratic Party politics, serving in the administrations of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson. He served as United States Ambassador to India under the Kennedy administration. His political activism, literary output and outspokenness brought him wide fame during his lifetime. Galbraith was one of the few to receive both the World War II Medal of Freedom (1946) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2000) for his public service and contributions to science.

==Life==
===Early life===
Galbraith was born on October 15, 1908, to Canadians of Scottish descent, Sarah Catherine (Kendall) and Archibald &quot;Archie&quot; Galbraith, in Iona Station, Ontario, Canada, and was raised in Dunwich Township, Ontario. He had three siblings: Alice, Catherine, and Archibald William (Bill). By the time he was a teenager, he had adopted the name Ken, and later disliked being called John. Galbraith grew to be a very tall man, attaining a height of .

His father was a farmer, school teacher, president of a cooperative insurance company, and local official of the Liberal Party. His mother, a homemaker and a community activist, died when he was fourteen years old. The family farm was located on Thomson Line. Both of his parents were supporters of the United Farmers of Ontario in the 1920s.

His early years were spent at a one-room school which is still standing, on 9468 Willey Road, in Iona Station. Later, he went to Dutton High School and St. Thomas High School. In 1931, Galbraith graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture from the Ontario Agricultural College, which was then an associate agricultural college of the University of Toronto. He majored in animal husbandry. He was awarded a Giannini Scholarship in Agricultural Economics (receiving $60 per month) that allowed him to travel to Berkeley, California, where he received masters and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in agricultural economics from the University of California, Berkeley. Galbraith was taught economics by Professor George Martin Peterson, and together they wrote an economics paper titled &quot;The Concept of Marginal Land&quot; in 1932 that was published in the &quot;American Journal of Agricultural Economics&quot;.

After graduation in 1934, he started to work as an instructor at Harvard University. Galbraith taught intermittently at Harvard in the period 1934 to 1939. From 1939 to 1940, he taught at Princeton University. In 1937, he became a citizen of the United States and was no longer a British subject. In the same year, he took a year-long fellowship at the University of Cambridge, England, where he was influenced by John Maynard Keynes. He then traveled in Europe for several months in 1938, attending an international economic conference and developing his ideas. He served for a few months in summer 1934 in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As a Harvard teacher in 1938 he was given charge of a research project for the National Resources Planning Board. From 1943 until 1948, he served as an editor of &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine. In 1949, he was appointed professor of economics at Harvard. He also taught at the Harvard Extension School.

===World War II===
The United States went into WWII with an economy still not fully recovered from the Great Depression. Because wartime production needs mandated large budget deficits and an accommodating monetary policy, inflation and a runaway wage-price spiral were seen as likely. As a part of a team charged with keeping inflation from damaging the war effort, Galbraith served as a deputy administrator of the Office of Price Administration (OPA) during World War II in 1941–1943. The OPA directed the process of stabilization of prices and rents.

On May 11, 1941, President Roosevelt created the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply (OPACS). On August 28, 1941, it became the Office of Price Administration (OPA). After the US entered the war in December 1941, OPA was tasked with rationing and price controls. The Emergency Price Control Act passed on January 30, 1942, legitimized the OPA as a separate federal agency. It merged OPA with two other agencies: Consumer Protection Division and Price Stabilization Division of the Advisory Commission to the Council of National Defense. The council was referred to as the National Defense Advisory Commission (NDAC), and was created on May 29, 1940. NDAC emphasized voluntary and advisory methods in keeping prices low. Leon Henderson, the NDAC commissioner for price stabilization, became the administrator of OPACS and of OPA in 1941–1942. He oversaw a mandatory and vigorous price regulation that started in May 1942 after OPA introduced the General Maximum Price Regulation (GMPR). It was much criticized by the business community. In response, OPA mobilized the public on behalf of the new guidelines and said that it reduced the options for those who were seeking higher rents or prices. OPA had its own Enforcement Division, which documented the increase of violations: a quarter million in 1943 and more than 300,000 during the next year.

Historians and economists differ over the assessment of the OPA activities, which started with six people, but then grew to 15,000 staffers. Some of them point to the fact that price increases were relatively lower than during the First World War, and that the overall economy grew faster. Steven Pressman, for example, wrote that &quot;when the controls were removed there was only a small increase in prices, thereby demonstrating that inflationary pressures were actively managed and not just kept temporarily under control.&quot; Galbraith said in an interview that he considered his work at the OPA as his major life achievement, since prices were relatively stable during WWII. The role of the OPA, however, as well as the whole legacy of the US government wartime economic stabilization measures from a long-term perspective, remains debated. Richard Parker, who earlier had written a well regarded biography of Galbraith had this to say about Galbraith&#x27;s efforts during the war:

[H]e had first gone to work in the nation&#x27;s capital in 1934 as a 25-year-old, fresh out of graduate school and just about to join the Harvard faculty as a young instructor. He had returned to Washington in mid-1940, after Paris fell to the Germans, initially to help ready the nation for war. Eighteen months later, after Pearl Harbor, he was then appointed to oversee the wartime economy as &quot;price czar,&quot; charged with preventing inflation and corrupt price-gouging from devastating the economy as it swelled to produce the weapons and materiel needed to guarantee victory against fascism. In this, he and his colleagues at the Office of Price Administration had been stunningly successful, guiding an economy that quadrupled in size in less than five years without fanning the inflation that had haunted World War I, or leaving behind an unbalanced post-war collapse of the kind that had done such grievous damage to Europe in the 1920s.

Opposition to the OPA came from conservatives in Congress and the business community. It undercut Galbraith and he was forced out in May 1943, accused of &quot;communistic tendencies&quot;. He was promptly hired by Henry Luce, a conservative Republican and a dominant figure in American media as publisher of &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Fortune&quot; magazines. Galbraith worked for Luce for five years and expounded Keynesianism to the American business leadership. Luce allegedly said to President Kennedy, &quot;I taught Galbraith how to write—and have regretted it ever since.&quot; Galbraith saw his role as educating the entire nation on how the economy worked, including the role of big corporations. He was combining his writing with numerous speeches to business groups and local Democratic party meetings, as well as frequently testifying before Congress.

During the late stages of WWII in 1945, Galbraith was invited by Paul Nitze to serve as one of the &quot;Officers&quot; of the Strategic Bombing Survey, initiated by the Office of Strategic Services. It was designed to assess the results of the aerial bombardments of Nazi Germany. The survey found that German war production went up rather than down as German cities were being bombed. Henderson (2006) wrote, &#x27;Galbraith had to fight hard to have his report published without it being rewritten to hide the essential points. &quot;I defended it,&quot; he wrote, &quot;with a maximum of arrogance and a minimum of tact.&quot;&#x27; Those findings created a controversy, with Nitze siding with others of the &quot;Officers&quot; managing the survey and with Pentagon officials, who declared the opposite. Later, Galbraith described the willingness of public servants and institutions to bend the truth to please the Pentagon as the &quot;Pentagonania syndrome&quot;.

===Postwar===
In February 1946, Galbraith took a leave of absence from his magazine work for a senior position in the State Department as director of the Office of Economic Security Policy where he was nominally in charge of economic affairs regarding Germany, Japan, Austria, and South Korea. Distrusted by senior diplomats, he was relegated to routine work, with few opportunities to make policy. Galbraith favored détente with the Soviet Union, along with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and General Lucius D. Clay, a military governor of the US Zone in Germany from 1947 to 1949, but they were out of step with the containment policy then being developed by George Kennan and favored by the majority of the US major policymakers. After a disconcerting half-year, Galbraith resigned in September 1946 and went back to his magazine writing on economics issues. Later, he immortalized his frustration with &quot;the ways of Foggy Bottom&quot; in a satirical novel, &quot;The Triumph&quot; (1968). The postwar period also was memorable for Galbraith because of his work, along with Eleanor Roosevelt and Hubert Humphrey, to establish a progressive policy organization Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) in support of the cause of economic and social justice in 1947. In 1952, Galbraith&#x27;s friends Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and George Ball recruited him to work as a speechwriter for the Democratic candidate, Adlai Stevenson. The involvement of several intellectuals from the ADA in the Stevenson campaign attracted controversy as the Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy accused the ADA intellectuals as being &quot;tainted&quot; by &quot;well documented Red associations&quot;; Galbraith later said one of his regrets was that McCarthy failed to condemn him as one of Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;red&quot; advisers.

=== Kennedy administration ===

During his time as an adviser to President John F. Kennedy, Galbraith was appointed United States Ambassador to India from 1961 to 1963. His rapport with Kennedy was such that he regularly bypassed the State Department and sent his diplomatic cables directly to the president. Galbraith disliked his superior, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, writing to Kennedy that trying to communicate via Rusk was &quot;like trying to fornicate through a mattress&quot;. In India, he became a confidant of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and extensively advised the Indian government on economic matters.

Kennedy considered India to be important not just in its own right, but also because an Indian diplomat always served as the chief commissioner of the International Control Commission (ICC). Thus, Galbraith came to be involved in American policy towards Southeast Asia from his perch as an ambassador in New Delhi. In 1961, when Kennedy considered intervening in the civil war in Laos, Galbraith strongly advised him not to, warning him that the disastrous Bay of Pigs Invasion had been caused by Kennedy taking the advice offered by the hawkish Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had assured him that the invasion could not fail and were now saying the same about the proposed intervention in Laos. Galbraith also noted that the ICC was also responsible for Laos as well as the two Vietnams, and he had Nehru&#x27;s word that the Indian diplomats on the ICC were willing to serve as honest brokers for a peace deal to make Laos neutral in the Cold War.

In May 1961, the Indian ICC members had been able to broker a ceasefire in Laos and Kennedy decided to go for the neutralization option instead of war. During the talks in Geneva to discuss a solution to the Lao crisis, the chief American delegate, W. Averell Harriman, discovered the Chinese foreign minister, Chen Yi, was willing to meet him in private. However, Rusk forbade Harriman to talk to Chen under any circumstances, fearful of Republican attacks against the Democrat Kennedy if the meetings should come out to the media, causing Harriman to explode in rage that during World War II, Roosevelt had allowed him to meet whoever was necessary. Unable to change Rusk&#x27;s mind, Harriman appealed to Galbraith, who in his turn appealed to Kennedy. Kennedy granted permission for Harriman to meet Chen, provided that it was done under the strictest secrecy, but by that time, Chen had returned to Beijing. In May 1961, when Vice President Lyndon Johnson visited India, Galbraith had the duty of escorting him around various sites in India and attempting to explain some of his Texas mannerisms such as his shouts of &quot;yee-hah!&quot; that he made when he saw the Taj Mahal, which confused the Indians.

From the embassy in New Delhi, Galbraith emerged as a critic of the increasing American involvement in Vietnam. In November 1961, he visited South Vietnam where he presented an unflattering picture of the regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem, saying &quot;we are now married to failure&quot;. He advised finding a new South Vietnamese leader, saying &quot;nothing succeeds like successors&quot;. In May 1962, Galbraith cabled Kennedy, stating that according to the most recent statements made by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Diem had about 170,000 men under arms at present, while claiming that his country was in major danger from 20,000 lightly armed Viet Cong guerrillas. Galbraith proceeded to do a statistical comparison, under which he calculated that in proportional terms, Diem had an army that was approximately the ratio to the population that was equivalent to that of the U.S Army to the American people after the Civil War, while the Viet Cong had a ratio equivalent to that of the Sioux vs the American people, leading Galbraith to sarcastically ask why Diem needed more American support. He concluded his cable to Kennedy: &quot;Incidentally, who is the man in your administration who decides what countries are strategic? I would like to have his name and address and ask him what is so important about this real estate in the Space Age&quot;.

In January 1963, when Polish Foreign Minister Adam Rapacki visited New Delhi, Galbraith met with him to declare to him his &quot;despair&quot; about Kennedy&#x27;s Vietnam policies and to ask that Poland, as one of the three members of the ICC, try help find a diplomatic solution to the Vietnam War. Galbraith told Rapacki that he favored an agreement to neutralize the two Vietnams similar to the neutralization agreement signed for Laos in 1962. On February 5, 1963, Przemysław Ogrodziński, the Polish ambassador in New Delhi, was ordered by his superiors in Warsaw: &quot;As far as the Vietnam matter, we are discussing it. It was received with interest. Deliberations will continue. As for now, we suggest inviting Galbraith to lunch and sounding [him] out, without committing ourselves, in order for him to see that we are looking into this matter&quot;.

Although Galbraith had acted on his own in approaching Rapacki, he had some support from Kennedy, who told him &quot;to pursue the subject immediately.&quot; This was the origin of the &quot;Maneli affair&quot;, named after Mieczysław Maneli, the Polish Commissioner to the ICC who, together with Ramchundur Goburdhun, the Indian Commissioner on the ICC, approached leaders in both North and South Vietnam with a proposal to make both Vietnams neutral in the Cold War.

On April 1, 1963, Galbraith flew to Washington to discuss the peace proposal with Kennedy, where the president told him &quot;to be prepared to seize upon any favorable moment to reduce our commitment [in Vietnam]&quot;, though it &quot;might yet be some time away.&quot; In September 1963, Maneli met with Ngô Đình Nhu, the younger brother and right-hand man of President Diem, to discuss neutralization, a meeting that was leaked to the right-wing American columnist Joseph Alsop. At that point Kennedy lost interest in the &quot;Maneli affair&quot;, instead deciding to back an alternative option he had been considering since August: a coup against the Ngo brothers.

While in India, he helped establish one of the first computer science departments, at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. (Even after leaving office, Galbraith remained a friend and supporter of India.)
Because of his recommendation, First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy undertook her 1962 diplomatic missions in India and Pakistan.
=== Johnson administration ===
After leaving the American embassy in India, Galbraith continued to advise Johnson, now president, against escalating American involvement in Vietnam. In 1965, he advised Johnson that he should &quot;instruct officials and spokesmen to stop saying the future of mankind, the United States, and human liberty is being decided in Vietnam. It isn&#x27;t; this merely builds up a difficult problem out of all proportion. It is also terrible politics&quot;. During the 1966 Buddhist crisis in South Vietnam, Galbraith wrote Johnson a letter on April 3 saying he now had &quot;an opportunity only the God-fearing deserve and only the extremely lucky get&quot;, saying that if the government of Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ should fall, Johnson should use the occasion to pull all Americans out of Vietnam.

On June 16, 1966, Galbraith offered to write Johnson a speech that would set out an orderly withdrawal of American forces over the next year. Galbraith advised Johnson the beginning of the Cultural Revolution in China represented an opportunity for a diplomatic settlement of the Vietnam war, predicting that Mao Zedong would lose interest in Vietnam now that he had launched his Cultural Revolution. The National Security Adviser, W.W. Rostow, wrote the reply to Galbraith that was signed by Johnson, curtly declaring: &quot;I have never doubted your talent for political craftsmanship, and I am sure you could devise a script that would appear to justify our taking an unjustifiable course in South Vietnam&quot;. On June 28, 1966, Galbraith made his final attempt to change Johnson&#x27;s mind, warning that the Vietnam War would ruin his presidency and that he should stop taking the advice of Rostow. Galbraith stated that Johnson had the potential to be one of the greatest presidents if only he find a way out of Vietnam, and concluded: &quot;The people who want to invest more and more in this war have nothing to lose. They will end up working for a foundation&quot;.

In 1966, when he was no longer ambassador, he told the United States Senate that one of the main causes of the 1965 Kashmir war was American military aid to Pakistan.

In early 1968, Galbraith endorsed Senator Eugene McCarthy, who ran against Johnson on an anti-war platform. During the New Hampshire Democratic primary, Galbraith toured the Granite State, giving pro-McCarthy speeches in churches, union halls, campuses and house parties. As McCarthy had the reputation of being strange and frivolous, Galbraith&#x27;s support and campaigning for him was important, as McCarthy needed the endorsement of mainstream figures to give him credibility. When the New Hampshire Democratic primary was held on March 12, 1968, Johnson defeated McCarthy by only about 300 votes, a humiliation for an incumbent president with a well funded campaign running against a senator widely considered to be too eccentric to be president, and who had only a fraction of the campaign money that Johnson had. Though Johnson won the primary, the very narrow margin of his victory was widely considered to be a defeat. On the night of the primary, Galbraith celebrated the result at McCarthy campaign headquarters as if it were an outright victory. The day after the New Hampshire primary, Galbraith was widely cheered by his students when he entered his lecture hall at Harvard.

The results of the New Hampshire primary showed that Johnson was vulnerable. On March 16, 1968, Senator Robert F. Kennedy announced he was entering the presidential race. Kennedy asked Galbraith to withdraw his endorsement of McCarthy and to endorse him instead, a request that Galbraith refused. The historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who campaigned with Galbraith in New Hampshire for McCarthy, switched his support to Kennedy, on the grounds that Kennedy was a far more electable candidate than the eccentric McCarthy, a man most people found to be too silly to be president. Schlesinger strongly urged Galbraith to support Kennedy, but Galbraith chose to continue to campaign for McCarthy, partly because McCarthy&#x27;s liberalism was closer to his own politics, and partly out of a personal revulsion for Kennedy, who had only opportunistically entered the presidential race when it became clear that Johnson was not invincible. Galbraith had been friends with John Kennedy, but his relations with Robert were more difficult, as Galbraith found Robert too rigid, utterly convinced that he was always right. Galbraith later said that with Robert Kennedy &quot;You were either for the cause or against it, with the Kennedys or a leper&quot;.

After Kennedy was assassinated, McCarthy became so depressed that he almost dropped out of the election, and Galbraith visited several times to urge him to continue, through Galbraith later admitted &quot;...I don&#x27;t believe Eugene McCarthy&#x27;s heart was ever wholly in the battle&quot;. At the chaotic and violent Democratic National Convention in August 1968 in Chicago, Galbraith attended as the floor manager for the McCarthy campaign. Amid what was later called a &quot;police riot&quot;, as the Chicago police fought in the streets with anti-Vietnam war protesters, Galbraith held an impromptu speech outside the Hilton Hotel before a group of demonstrators, urging them to reject violence and to have patience, while assuring them that the American system was capable of reform and change. Galbraith pointed to the armed Illinois National Guardsmen standing in the background and said that they, unlike the Chicago police, were not the enemy, as he maintained that most of the young men who joined the Illinois National Guard had only done so to avoid being drafted to fight in Vietnam. After finishing his speech, a National Guard sergeant approached Galbraith, who froze up in fear as he believed he was about to be arrested. Instead the sergeant wanted to shake hands, saying: &quot;Thank you, sir. That was the first nice thing anyone has said about us all week&quot;.

At the convention, supporters of Johnson challenged Galbraith&#x27;s right to serve as a delegate, and sought to expel him from the building. Galbraith quarreled with Johnson supporters on the convention floor as he sought to add a peace plank to the Democratic platform, which Johnson saw as an insult to himself, and ordered the delegates to reject. The Mayor of Chicago, Richard Daley, a Johnson supporter, had imposed such stringent security conditions that it was impossible to walk across the convention hall without jostling somebody else, which added to the tension of the convention as pro-war and anti-war Democrats fiercely argued about the platform, all of which was captured live on national television. Adding to the tension were televisions on the convention floor that showed what was happening outside, as the Chicago police attacked and beat anti-war demonstrators. On Daley&#x27;s orders, the Chicago police searched Galbraith&#x27;s room at the Hilton hotel, alleging that he was hiding anti-war protesters. None were found. After Vice President Hubert Humphrey won the Democratic nomination, Galbraith reluctantly endorsed Humphrey as preferable to the Republican candidate, Richard Nixon.

===Later life and recognition===
In autumn 1972, Galbraith was an adviser and assistant to Nixon&#x27;s rival candidate, Senator George McGovern, in the election campaign for the American presidency. During this time (September 1972) he travelled to China in his role as president of the American Economic Association (AEA) at the invitation of Mao Zedong&#x27;s communist government, together with fellow economists Wassily Leontief and James Tobin. In 1973, Galbraith published an account of his experiences in &quot;A China Passage&quot;, writing that there was &quot;no serious doubt that China is devising a highly effective economic system,&quot; &quot;[d]issidents are brought firmly into line in China, but, one suspects, with great politeness,&quot; and &quot;Greater Shanghai ... has a better medical service than New York,&quot;. He considered it not implausible that Chinese industrial and agricultural output was expanding annually at a rate of 10 to 11%.

In 1972 he served as president of the American Economic Association. The &quot;Journal of Post Keynesian Economics&quot; benefited from Galbraith&#x27;s support and he served as the chairman of its board from its beginning.

During the shooting of &quot;The World at War&quot;, a British television documentary series (1973–74), Galbraith described his experiences in the Roosevelt war administration. Among other things, he spoke about the initial confusion during the first meeting of the major departmental leaders about kapok and its use. Galbraith also talked about rationing and especially about trickery during fuel allocation.

In December 1977, he met the Palauan senator Roman Tmetuchl and eventually became an unpaid adviser to the Palau Political Status Commission. He advocated for minimal financial requirement and infrastructure projects. In 1979 he addressed Palau&#x27;s legislature and participated in a seminar for the delegates to the Palau Constitutional Convention. He became the first person to earn honorary citizenship of Palau.

In 1984, he visited the USSR, writing that the Soviet economy had made &quot;great material progress&quot; as, &quot;in contrast to Western industrial economy,&quot; the USSR &quot;makes full use of its manpower.&quot;

In 1985, the American Humanist Association named him the Humanist of the Year. The Association for Asian Studies (AAS) conferred its 1987 Award for Distinguished Contributions to Asian Studies.

In 1997 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2000 he was awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom. He also was awarded an honorary doctorate from Memorial University of Newfoundland at the fall convocation of 1999, another contribution to the impressive collection of approximately fifty academic honorary degrees bestowed upon Galbraith. In 2000, he was awarded the Leontief Prize for his outstanding contribution to economic theory by the Global Development and Environment Institute. The library in his hometown of Dutton, Ontario was renamed the &quot;John Kenneth Galbraith Reference Library&quot; in honor of his attachment to the library and his contributions to the new building.

On April 29, 2006, Galbraith died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, of natural causes at the age of 97, after a two-week stay in a hospital. He is interred at Indian Hill Cemetery in Middletown, Connecticut.

===Family===
On September 17, 1937, Galbraith married Catherine Merriam Atwater, whom he met while she was a Radcliffe graduate student. Their marriage lasted for 68 years. The Galbraiths resided in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and had a summer home in Townshend, Vermont. They had four sons: J. Alan Galbraith was a partner in the Washington, DC, law firm Williams &amp; Connolly (now retired); Douglas Galbraith died in childhood of leukemia; Peter W. Galbraith has been an American diplomat who served as Ambassador to Croatia and is a commentator on American foreign policy, particularly in the Balkans and the Middle East; James K. Galbraith is a progressive economist at the University of Texas at Austin Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. The Galbraiths also had ten grandchildren.

A memorial plaque stands adjoining a stone inukshuk overlooking the Galbraith family farm on the Thompson (Hogg) Line just east of Willey Road, just north of the one room school he attended. The family home—a large white farm house—still stands, as do many of the original farm buildings.

==Writings==
Even before becoming a president of the American Economic Association, Galbraith was considered as an iconoclast by many economists. This is partly because he rejected the technical analysis and mathematical modelling of neoclassical economics as being divorced from reality. Following Thorstein Veblen, he believed that economic activity could not be distilled into inviolable laws, but rather was a complex product of the cultural and political milieu in which it occurs. In particular, he posited that important factors, such as the separation between corporate ownership and management, oligopoly, and the influence of government and military spending had been largely neglected by most economists because they are not amenable to axiomatic descriptions. In this sense, he worked as much in political economy as in classical economics.

His work included several best selling books throughout the fifties and sixties. His major contribution to the field of economics is the so-called &quot;American capitalism&quot; trilogy: The &quot;Affluent Society&quot; (1958), &quot;The New Industrial State&quot; (1967), and &quot;Economics and the Public Purpose&quot; (1973). Written in a clear and concise style, they were comprehensible to lay readers, not just economists.

After his retirement from Harvard as the Paul M. Warburg Professor of Economics, Emeritus, he remained in the public spotlight by continuing to write 21 new books, as well as completing a script in 1977 for a major series on economics for PBS and BBC television—&quot;The Age of Uncertainty&quot;, broadcast in 38 countries.

In addition to his books, he wrote hundreds of essays and a number of novels. Among his novels, &quot;A Tenured Professor&quot; achieved particular critical acclaim. Galbraith wrote book reviews, e.g., of &quot;The Report from Iron Mountain on the Possibility and Desirability of Peace&quot;, a 1967 political satire, under the pen name of &quot;Herschel McLandress&quot;, a name of a fictional Scottish mentor featured in the &quot;Tenured Professor&quot;. He also used the pseudonym, Mark Épernay, when he published &quot;The McLandress Dimension&quot; in 1963.

===Economics books===
Galbraith was an important figure in 20th-century institutional economics, and provided an exemplary &quot;institutionalist&quot; perspective on economic power. Among his numerous writings, Galbraith cherished &quot;The New Industrial State&quot; and &quot;The Affluent Society&quot; as his two best. As for the later works, economist and Galbraith friend Mike Sharpe visited him in 2004, on which occasion Galbraith gave Sharpe a copy of what would be Galbraith&#x27;s last book, &quot;The Economics of Innocent Fraud&quot;. Galbraith confided in Sharpe that &quot;this is my best book&quot;, an assertion Galbraith delivered &quot;a little mischievously.&quot;

After the beginning of the Great Recession of 2008, Galbraith&#x27;s &quot;The Great Crash, 1929&quot; (1955) and other books containing warnings about the dangers of an unrestrained speculative mood without proper government oversight found an attentive readership again. In 2010, the Library of America published a new edition of Galbraith&#x27;s major works, edited by his son, James K. Galbraith: &quot;The Affluent Society &amp; Other Writings, 1952–1967&quot;: &quot;American Capitalism&quot;, &quot;The Great Crash, 1929&quot;, &quot;The Affluent Society&quot;, and &quot;The New Industrial State&quot;. On this occasion, Bill Moyers interviewed James K. Galbraith about his father, his works, and his legacy.

====American economy====
In &quot;American Capitalism: The Concept of Countervailing Power&quot;, published in 1952, Galbraith concluded that the American economy was managed by a triumvirate of big business, big labor, and an activist government. Galbraith defined the actions of the industry lobby groups and unions as &quot;countervailing power&quot;. He contrasted this arrangement with the period prior to the previous Depression, when big business had relatively free rein over the economy.

His 1955 bestseller &quot;The Great Crash, 1929&quot; describes the Wall Street meltdown of stock prices and how markets progressively become decoupled from reality in a speculative boom. The book is also a platform for Galbraith&#x27;s humor and keen insights into human behavior when wealth is threatened. It has never been out of print.

In &quot;The Affluent Society&quot; (1958), which became a bestseller, Galbraith outlined his view that to become successful, post–World War II America should make large investments in items such as highways and education, using funds from general taxation.

Galbraith also critiqued the assumption that continually increasing material production is a sign of economic and societal health. Because of this Galbraith is sometimes considered one of the first post-materialists. In this book, he popularized the old phrase &quot;conventional wisdom&quot;. Galbraith worked on the book while in Switzerland and had originally titled it &quot;Why The Poor Are Poor&quot;, but changed it to &quot;The Affluent Society&quot; at his wife&#x27;s suggestion. &quot;The Affluent Society&quot; contributed (likely to a significant degree, given that Galbraith had the ear of President Kennedy) to the &quot;war on poverty&quot;, the government spending policy introduced by the administrations of Kennedy and Johnson.

====New industrial state====
In 1966, Galbraith was invited by the BBC to present the Reith Lectures, a series of radio broadcasts, which he titled &quot;The New Industrial State&quot;. Across six broadcasts, he explored the economics of production and the effect large corporations could have over the state.

In the print edition of &quot;The New Industrial State&quot; (1967), Galbraith expanded his analysis of the role of power in economic life, arguing that very few industries in the United States fit the model of perfect competition. A central concept of the book is the revised sequence. The &#x27;conventional wisdom&#x27; in economic thought portrays economic life as a set of competitive markets governed, ultimately, by the decisions of sovereign consumers. In this original sequence, the control of the production process flows from consumers of commodities to the organizations that produce those commodities. In the revised sequence, this flow is reversed and businesses exercise control over consumers by advertising and related salesmanship activities.

The revised sequence concept applies only to the industrial system—that is, the manufacturing core of the economy in which each industry contains only a handful of very powerful corporations. It does not apply to the market system in the Galbraithian dual economy. In the market system, composed of the vast majority of business organizations, price competition remains the dominant form of social control. In the industrial system, however, composed of the 1,000 or so large corporations, competitive price theory obscures the relation to the price system of these large and powerful corporations. In Galbraith&#x27;s view, the principal function of market relations in this industrial system is, not to constrain the power of the corporate behemoths, but to serve as an instrument for the implementation of their power. Moreover, the power of these corporations extends into commercial culture and politics, allowing them to exercise considerable influence upon popular social attitudes and value judgments. That this power is exercised in the shortsighted interest of expanding commodity production and the status of the few is both inconsistent with democracy and a barrier to achieving the quality of life that the new industrial state with its affluence could provide.

&quot;The New Industrial State&quot; not only provided Galbraith with another best-selling book, it also extended once again, the currency of &quot;institutionalist&quot; economic thought. The book also filled a very pressing need in the late 1960s. The conventional theory of monopoly power in economic life maintains that the monopolist will attempt to restrict supply in order to maintain price above its competitive level. The social cost of this monopoly power is a decrease in both allocative efficiency and the equity of income distribution. This conventional economic analysis of the role of monopoly power did not adequately address popular concern about the large corporation in the late 1960s. The growing concern focused on the role of the corporation in politics, the damage done to the natural environment by an unmitigated commitment to economic growth, and the perversion of advertising and other pecuniary aspects of culture. &quot;The New Industrial State&quot; gave a plausible explanation of the power structure involved in generating these problems and found a very receptive audience among the rising American counterculture and political activists.

A third related work was &quot;Economics and the Public Purpose&quot; (1973), in which he expanded on these themes by discussing, among other issues, the subservient role of women in the unrewarded management of ever-greater consumption, and the role of the technostructure in the large firm in influencing perceptions of sound economic policy aims.

====Financial bubbles====
In &quot;A Short History of Financial Euphoria&quot; (1990), he traces speculative bubbles through several centuries, and argues that they are inherent in the free market system because of &quot;mass psychology&quot; and the &quot;vested interest in error that accompanies speculative euphoria.&quot; Also, financial memory is &quot;notoriously short&quot;: what currently seems to be a &quot;new financial instrument&quot; is inevitably nothing of the sort. Galbraith cautions: &quot;The world of finance hails the invention of the wheel over and over again, often in a slightly more unstable version.&quot; Crucial to his analysis is the assertion that the common factor in boom-and-bust is the creation of debt to finance speculation, which &quot;becomes dangerously out of scale in relation to the underlying means of payment.&quot;

===Legacy===
Galbraith&#x27;s main ideas focused around the influence of the market power of large corporations. He believed that this market power weakened the widely accepted principle of consumer sovereignty, allowing corporations to be price makers, rather than price takers, allowing corporations with the strongest market power to increase the production of their goods beyond an efficient amount. He further believed that market power played a major role in inflation. He argued that corporations and trade unions could only increase prices to the extent that their market power allowed. He argued that in situations of excessive market power, price controls effectively controlled inflation, but cautioned against using them in markets that were basically efficient such as agricultural goods and housing. He noted that price controls were much easier to enforce in industries with relatively few buyers and sellers. Galbraith&#x27;s view of market power was not entirely negative; he also noted that the power of US firms played a part in the success of the US economy.

In &quot;The Affluent Society&quot; Galbraith asserts that classical economic theory was true for the eras before the present, which were times of &quot;poverty&quot;; now, however, we have moved from an age of poverty to an age of &quot;affluence&quot;, and for such an age, a completely new economic theory is needed.

Galbraith&#x27;s main argument is that as society becomes relatively more affluent, private business must create consumer demand through advertising, and while this generates artificial affluence through the production of commercial goods and services, the public sector becomes neglected. He points out that while many Americans were able to purchase luxury items, their parks were polluted and their children attended poorly maintained schools. He argues that markets alone will under-provide (or fail to provide at all) for many public goods, whereas private goods are typically &quot;over-provided&quot; due to the process of advertising creating an artificial demand above the individual&#x27;s basic needs. This emphasis on the power of advertising and consequent over-consumption may have anticipated the drop in savings rates in the US and elsewhere in the developing world.

Galbraith proposed curbing the consumption of certain products through greater use of pigovian taxes and land value taxes, arguing that this could be more efficient than other forms of taxation, such as labor taxes. Galbraith&#x27;s major proposal was a program he called &quot;investment in men&quot;—a large-scale, publicly funded education program aimed at empowering ordinary citizens.

An International Symposium to honor John Kenneth Galbraith, sponsored by the l&#x27;Université du Littoral Côte d&#x27;Opale, Dunkerque and the Institut de Gestion Sociale, Paris, France, was held in September 2004 in Paris.

A special issue &quot;Commemorating John Kenneth Galbraith&#x27;s Centenary&quot; of the &quot;Review of Political Economy&quot; was dedicated in 2008 to Galbraith&#x27;s contribution to economics.

Three days before his death, Galbraith urged his son, economist James K. Galbraith, to &quot;write a short book on corporate predation&quot;; the younger Galbraith completed &quot;The Predator State&quot; in 2008.

===Reception===
Galbraith&#x27;s work in general, and &quot;The Affluent Society&quot; in particular, have drawn sharp criticism from laissez-faire supporters since the time of their publications. Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman in &quot;Friedman on Galbraith, and on curing the British disease&quot; views Galbraith as a 20th-century version of the early-19th-century Tory radical of Great Britain. He argues that Galbraith believes in the superiority of aristocracy and in its paternalistic authority, that consumers should not be allowed choice, and that all should be determined by those with &quot;higher minds&quot;, commenting: &quot;Many reformers—Galbraith is not alone in this—have as their basic objection to a free market that it frustrates them in achieving their reforms, because it enables people to have what they want, not what the reformers want. Hence every reformer has a strong tendency to be averse to a free market.&quot;

Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Solow, in a review of &quot;The New Industrial State&quot;, points at Galbraith&#x27;s lack of empiricism and selectiveness in his use of evidence. He points out that &quot;It may be unjust and pointless to consider the degree of literal truth of each of the assertions that make up this argument. One would hardly discuss Gulliver&#x27;s Travels by debating whether there really are any little people, or criticize the Grande Jatte because objects aren&#x27;t made up of tiny dots. Nevertheless, it may help to judge the truth of Galbraith&#x27;s.&quot;

Richard Parker, in his biography, &quot;John Kenneth Galbraith: His Life, His Economics, His Politics&quot;, characterizes Galbraith as a more complex thinker. Galbraith&#x27;s primary purpose in &quot;Capitalism: The Concept of Countervailing Power&quot; (1952) was, ironically, to show that big business was now necessary to the American economy to maintain the technological progress that drives economic growth. Galbraith knew that the &quot;countervailing power&quot;, which included government regulation and collective bargaining, was necessary to balanced and efficient markets. In &quot;The New Industrial State&quot; (1967), Galbraith argued that the dominant American corporations had created a technostructure that closely controlled both consumer demand and market growth through advertising and marketing. While Galbraith defended government intervention, Parker notes that he also believed that government and big business worked together to maintain stability.

Paul Krugman downplayed Galbraith&#x27;s stature as an academic economist in 1994. In &quot;Peddling Prosperity&quot;, he places Galbraith as one among many &quot;policy entrepreneurs&quot;—either economists, or think tank writers, left and right—who write solely for the public, as opposed to those who write for other academics, and who are, therefore, liable to make unwarranted diagnoses and offer over-simplistic answers to complex economic problems. Krugman asserts that Galbraith was never taken seriously by fellow academics, who instead viewed him as more of a &quot;media personality&quot;. For example, Krugman believes that Galbraith&#x27;s work, &quot;The New Industrial State&quot;, is not considered to be &quot;real economic theory&quot;, and that &quot;Economics in Perspective&quot; is &quot;remarkably ill-informed&quot;.

Thomas Sowell in his 1995 book &quot;The Vision of the Anointed&quot;, criticized Galbraith&#x27;s claims in &quot;The Affluent Society&quot; and &quot;The New Industrial State&quot; that large corporations are invincible to competition, by citing Toyota and Honda&#x27;s takeover of the United States&#x27; automobile market at the expense of General Motors, the decline of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, and overall, the displacement of almost half of the firms in 1980&#x27;s Fortune 500 in the 1990 edition. Sowell also criticized Galbraith&#x27;s assertion that successful corporate management was immune to corporate shake-ups. Sowell believed Galbraith&#x27;s contemptuousness towards the idea of a lone entrepreneur starting up a new, powerful company to not have stood up to the test of time; Sowell used Steve Jobs and Bill Gates as counterexamples.

===Memoirs===
The first edition of &quot;The Scotch&quot; was published in the UK under two alternative titles: as &quot;Made to Last&quot; and &quot;The Non-potable Scotch: A Memoir of the Clansmen in Canada&quot;. It was illustrated by Samuel H. Bryant. Galbraith&#x27;s account of his boyhood environment in Elgin County in southern Ontario was added in 1963. He considered it his finest piece of writing.

Galbraith memoir, &quot;A Life in Our Times&quot; was published in 1981. It contains discussion of his thoughts, his life, and his times. In 2004, the publication of an authorized biography, &quot;John Kenneth Galbraith: His Life, His Politics, His Economics&quot; by a friend and fellow progressive economist Richard Parker renewed interest in Galbraith&#x27;s life journey and legacy.

==Honors==
