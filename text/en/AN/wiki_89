<doc id="83623" wikidata="Q1458587" url="?curid=83623" title="Themisto">
<text>In Greek mythology, Themisto (; Ancient Greek: Θεμιστώ) was a Thessalin princess as the daughter of King Hypseus of Lapiths and the naiad Chlidanope. Her name is derived from the Ancient Greek word: &quot;θεμιστος&quot; which means &quot;belonging to the law&quot;, or &quot;belonging to the customs&quot;.

== Family ==
Themisto&#x27;s sisters were Cyrene, Alcaea and Astyagyia. She was the third and last wife of Athamas, a Boeotian king. According to some sources, the couple had four children: Leucon, Erythrius, Schoeneus, and Ptous. In other sources, there were but two: Sphincius and Orchomenus, or else Schoeneus and Leucon. Some say that the father of Leucon was Poseidon (see also Leuconoe).

== Mythology ==
Themisto intended to kill her husband&#x27;s children by his previous wife, but accidentally slew her own sons. This was the subject of a non-surviving tragedy by Euripides, retold by Hyginus as follows. Athamas married Themisto as he believed his second wife, Ino, was dead, but Ino turned out to be alive and to have been on Mount Parnassus with the Maenads. Athamas had her brought home but kept her return a secret; Themisto did find out she was back, and resolved to kill Ino&#x27;s children as an act of revenge. However, she had never seen Ino in person and took her for a servant as they met, and ordered the &quot;servant&quot; to dress all her own children in white clothing, and Ino&#x27;s in black. Themisto then proceeded to kill all the black-clothed children. What Themisto did not realise was that Ino had switched the children&#x27;s clothing, and so she in fact killed her own children. Upon discovering that, she killed herself. According to Pseudo-Apollodorus, however, Themisto married Athamas after the death of Ino, and the whole story with the murder of the children did not take place.

<text>In Greek mythology, Phyleus (; Ancient Greek: Φυλεύς probably derived from φυλή &quot;phylē&quot; &quot;tribe, clan, race, people&quot;) was an Elean prince and one of the Calydonian boar hunters.

== Family ==
Phyleus was the elder son of King Augeas of Elis and father of Meges by Eustyoche, Hagnete Ctimene, or Ctesimache. Timandra, a daughter of King Tyndareus of Sparta, committed adultery with Phyleus (another possible mother of Meges) and deserted her husband Echemus. 

Phyleus was also credited to be the father of Eurydameia, mother of Euchenor and Cleitus by Polyidus.

== Mythology ==
During the fifth labour of Heracles, the hero asked for payment from Augeas not revealing the command of Eurystheus. But the Elean king knowing the task imposed to the hero, he refused to give him his reward. During the arbitration, Phyleus, witness of the task, was called by Heracles to testify against Augeas. Phyleus supported the hero instead of his father in the matter of the Augean Stables thus in his anger, the king exiled both Phyleus and Heracles. After the latter killed Augeas and his other sons, he gave Phyleus the kingdom. During the time of his exile, Phyleus led a colony of Epeans to the island of Dulichium. Thus, his son Meges led the contingent from Dulichium to the Trojan War.

<doc id="83629" wikidata="Q406831" url="?curid=83629" title="U.S. Route 9">
<text>U.S. Route 9 (US 9) is a north–south United States Numbered Highway in the states of Delaware, New Jersey, and New York in the Northeastern United States. It is one of only two U.S. Highways with a ferry connection (the Cape May–Lewes Ferry, between Lewes, Delaware, and North Cape May, New Jersey); the other is US 10. US 9 is signed east–west in Delaware and north–south on the rest of its route. The southern terminus of the route is in Laurel, Delaware, at an intersection of US 13, while the highway&#x27;s northern terminus is at an interchange with I-87 in Champlain, New York, where the old roadway continues north as the unsigned New York State Route 971B (NY 971B) (0.46 m/0.74 km), which ends in a cul-de-sac just short of the Canadian border.

==Route description==
|DE
|-

|Total
|}
Much of US 9 is a two-lane road, with some expansions near more populous areas. The major exception to this is central and northern New Jersey, where it is a wide four-lane (or six-lane) divided strip, especially during much of its concurrency with US 1 and in Middlesex and Monmouth counties. New York boasts a few similar sections, as well as two short expressway sections near Albany.

In New Jersey, US 9 mainly runs parallel to the Garden State Parkway, and, in New York, most of US 9 runs parallel to I-87.

===Delaware===
US 9 runs an east–west path through Sussex County, running east from US 13 in Laurel, passing through Georgetown, east to Lewes, where it leads to the Cape May–Lewes Ferry, which carries US 9 across the Delaware Bay to New Jersey. US 9 was extended to Delaware by way of the Cape May–Lewes Ferry in 1974, replacing Delaware Route 28 (DE 28) between Laurel and Georgetown and DE 18 between Georgetown and Lewes. US 9 runs concurrent with DE 404 between Georgetown and the Five Points intersection near Lewes.

===New Jersey===
From Cape May, US 9 runs north parallel to the Garden State Parkway, until briefly joining the Parkway to cross Great Egg Harbor Bay on the reconstructed Great Egg Harbor Bridge following the demolition of the Beesley&#x27;s Point Bridge. US 9 then exits the Parkway north of the bridge (where the Parkway includes a toll on all US 9 and Parkway traffic in the southbound direction) and runs through the Atlantic City suburbs, until joining the Parkway briefly again to cross the Mullica River estuary in the Pine Barrens region of South Jersey. At New Gretna, US 9 exits the parkway and parallels wooded areas and marshlands along Little Egg Harbor and Manahawkin and Barnegat bays, passing Manahawkin and paralleling Long Beach Island, until South Toms River where the highway rejoins the Parkway for a third and final time through Toms River. In Toms River exists the only Parkway/US 9 concurrency with interim interchanges at Parkway exits 81 and 82, before exiting the parkway at exit 83 and continuing north through Toms River to Lakewood, where the road becomes a divided highway that follows a more inland route through Howell Township, Freehold Township, Manalapan Township, Marlboro Township, Old Bridge Township, Sayreville, and into Perth Amboy. From there, the road resumes its parallel course with the Garden State Parkway. After crossing the Edison Bridge over the Raritan River, it merges with US 1 in Woodbridge Township. The concurrency, an important and busy regional artery, continues past Newark Liberty International Airport and over the Pulaski Skyway, finally leaving the state along with US 1 and I-95 via the George Washington Bridge.

====Overlap with US 1====

A large section in northeast New Jersey and a small section in southern New York is concurrent with US 1. Route shields on this section, which includes the Pulaski Skyway, often show both numbers in the same shield, with an endash or ampersand between (1–9 or 1&amp;9). It is known locally as &quot;one and nine&quot; or &quot;one-nine&quot;.

===New York===

US 9 exits shortly after the George Washington Bridge to go onto New York City&#x27;s Broadway north of it, passing over the northern tip of Manhattan Island via the toll-free Broadway Bridge, through the Bronx and into Westchester County, where in some towns it follows the old Albany Post Road, which dates from the early days of the nation&#x27;s existence.

Following the Hudson River closely as a busy surface road through the many suburban river villages and past National Historic Landmarks such as Sunnyside and Kykuit, US 9 becomes the Croton Expressway between Croton-on-Hudson and Peekskill. That section ends at the Annsville Circle junction with US 6 and US 202, where US 9 returns to two-lane status as it follows the old post road inland, away from the river. At Fishkill, the road passes the historic Van Wyck Homestead Museum and it becomes a six-lane divided strip until reaching the Poughkeepsie city limit. It then narrows to a four-lane divided strip which lasts until it intersects St. Andrews Road, just north of the Hyde Park–Poughkeepsie town line where it returns to two-lane status as it goes through Hyde Park and past its historic sites.

At Red Hook, US 9 veers inland again, becoming a two-lane country road through Columbia County save for the outskirts of Hudson. In Rensselaer County, it widens again as it intersects I-90 and then joins US 20 to Albany, where it crosses the Hudson at the Dunn Memorial Bridge. It is a busy surface road through the state capital, becoming a strip in its northern suburbs and taking traffic eventually to Saratoga Springs, Glens Falls and Lake George, at the edge of the Adirondack Park.
The Adirondack section of US 9 is the least trafficked of the road, returning to two lanes as it runs through vast tracts of forested wilderness and occasional hamlets. Almost to the north, it leaves the park and runs along or near Lake Champlain to Plattsburgh. North of there, it is once again a two-lane road all the way to Champlain, ending at an onramp to I-87 just shy of the border.

==History==
Prior to the opening of the Cape May–Lewes Ferry in 1964, US 9 ended on Lafayette Street in Cape May, New Jersey. It was rerouted to the west, via Sandman Boulevard and Lincoln Avenues, to meet the new ferry, and its southern stub into Cape May was renumbered as Route 109.
Originally, the road continued north across the border (as Route 9 toward Montreal) through the customs facilities now used by I-87/Autoroute 15. The official northern terminus (the point where the &quot;End US 9&quot; sign is posted) is just south of the interchange with I-87, less than from customs. The old Route 9 continues north for a very short distance (0.46 m/0.74 km) as the unsigned New York State Route 971B (NY 971B), which ends in a cul-de-sac just short of the Canadian border.

==In popular culture==
The highway is mentioned in the Bruce Springsteen songs &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;The Promise&quot;. The highway, particularly the section around Freehold Township, New Jersey, is associated with Springsteen more generally. It is also mentioned in the Springsteen song &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;.

It is also mentioned in the songs &quot;My Geraldine Lies Over the Delaware&quot; by The Wonder Years and &quot;The Devil On Hwy 9&quot; by Danzig.

The Breeders song &quot;Drivin&#x27; on 9&quot; refers to the route.

In Wayne Wang&#x27;s film &quot;Smoke&quot;, Thomas Cole&#x27;s father, Cyrus, runs a garage on US 9.

<text>In Greek mythology, Automedon (; Ancient Greek: Αὐτομέδων), son of Diores, was Achilles&#x27; charioteer, who drove the immortal horses Balius and Xanthos. He was born on the island of Skyros. 

== Mythology ==
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Automedon rides into battle once Patroclus dons Achilles&#x27;s armor, commanding Achilles&#x27; horses Balius and Xanthos. After Patroclus dies, Automedon is driven to the rear of the battle, where he tries to console the bereaved horses.

Zeus finally intervenes, and Automedon resumes driving the chariot, but cannot aid the Achaeans until Alcimedon agrees to be his driver. He repels an attempt on his life by Hector, Aeneas, Chromios, and Aretos, killing Aretos and taking his armor in the process. He also appears in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; at line 477 of Book II, when the Greek forces break into the palace of Priam.

<text>Marozia, born Maria and also known as Mariuccia or Mariozza ( 890 – 937), was a Roman noblewoman who was the alleged mistress of Pope Sergius III and was given the unprecedented titles &quot;senatrix&quot; (&quot;senatoress&quot;) and &quot;patricia&quot; of Rome by Pope John X.Edward Gibbon wrote of her that the &quot;influence of two sister prostitutes, Marozia and Theodora was founded on their wealth and beauty, their political and amorous intrigues: the most strenuous of their lovers were rewarded with the Roman tiara, and their reign may have suggested to darker ages the fable of a female pope. The bastard son, two grandsons, two great grandsons, and one great great grandson of Marozia—a rare genealogy—were seated in the Chair of St. Peter.&quot; Pope John XIII was her nephew, the offspring of her younger sister Theodora. From this description, the term &quot;pornocracy&quot; has become associated with the effective rule in Rome of Theodora and her daughter Marozia through male surrogates.

==Early life==
Marozia was born about 890. She was the daughter of the Roman consul Theophylact, Count of Tusculum, and of Theodora, the real power in Rome, whom bishop Liutprand of Cremona characterized as a &quot;shameless whore... [who] exercised power on the Roman citizenry like a man.&quot;

At the age of fifteen, Marozia became the mistress of Theophylact&#x27;s cousin Pope Sergius III, whom she knew when he was bishop of Portus. The two had a son, John (the later Pope John XI). That, at least, is the story found in two contemporary sources, the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; and the &quot;Antapodosis sive Res per Europam gestae&quot; (958–62), by Liutprand of Cremona (c. 920–72). But a third contemporary source, the annalist Flodoard (c. 894–966), says John XI was brother of Alberic II, the latter being the offspring of Marozia and her husband Alberic I. Hence John too may have been the son of Marozia and Alberic I.

Marozia married Alberic I, duke of Spoleto, in 909, and their son Alberic II was born in 911 or 912. By the time Alberic I was killed at Orte in 924, the Roman landowners had won complete victory over the traditional bureaucracy represented by the papal curia. Rome was virtually under secular control, the historic nadir of the papacy.

==Guy of Tuscany==
In order to counter the influence of Pope John X (whom the hostile chronicler Liutprand of Cremona alleges was another of her lovers), Marozia subsequently married his opponent Guy of Tuscany. Together they attacked Rome, arrested Pope John X in the Lateran, and jailed him in the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo. Either Guy had him smothered with a pillow in 928 or he simply died, perhaps from neglect or ill treatment. Marozia seized power in Rome in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. The following popes, Leo VI and Stephen VII, were both her puppets. In 931 she managed to impose her twenty-one-year-old son as pontiff, under the name of John XI.

==Hugh of Arles, and death==
Guy died in 929, and Marozia negotiated a marriage with his half-brother Hugh of Arles, the King of Italy. While in Rome Hugh quarreled with Marozia&#x27;s son Alberic II, who organized an uprising during the wedding ceremonies in 932. Hugh escaped, but Marozia was captured.

Marozia died after spending some 5 years in prison. Her descendants remained active in papal politics, starting with Alberic II&#x27;s son Octavian, who became Pope John XII in 955. Popes Benedict VIII, John XIX, and Benedict IX, and antipope Benedict X of the House of Tusculani, were also descended from Marozia. By Guy of Tuscany she had a daughter named Berta Theodora, who never married.

<text>The government of Sierra Leone is the governing authority of the Republic of Sierra Leone, as established by the Sierra Leone Constitution. The Sierra Leone government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative and the judiciary. The seat of government of Sierra Leone is in the capital Freetown.

The government of Sierra Leone takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Sierra Leone is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the president. Legislative power is vested in the Parliament of Sierra Leone.

The judiciary of Sierra Leone is independent of the executive and the legislature. Civil rights and freedom of religion are respected. A critical press continues to operate, although the government has intervened for alleged inaccurate reporting, using the 1965 Public Order Act which criminalizes libel.

==Executive==
|President
|Julius Maada Bio
|SLPP
|4 April 2018
|Vice-President
|Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh
|SLPP
|4 April 2018
The current president is Julius Maada Bio (since 4 April 2018). The president is both the head of state and head of government. Ministers of State are appointed by the president with the approval of the House of Representatives; the cabinet is responsible to the president. The president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term; elections were last held on 4 April 2018 (Julius Maada Bio, SLPP, 51.8%; Samura Kamara, APC, 47.2%). The president&#x27;s tenure of office is limited to two five-year terms.

===Departments ===

==Legislative==
The House of Representatives has 124 members, 112 members elected for a four-year term through proportional representation in 14 multi-seat constituencies with a constituency threshold of 12.5% and 12 Paramount chiefs.

==Judiciary==

There is a High Court, an Appeals Court, and a Supreme Court. The judicial system continues to function for civil cases though some regard it as handicapped by shortages of resources and qualified personnel. Judges are appointed by the president on the advice of the Judicial and Legal Service Commission with the approval of Parliament.

There also are magistrate and local courts and from these appeals lie to the superior courts of judicature.

The 1991 constitution created an ombudsman responsible for looking into complaints of abuses and capricious acts on the part of public officials. In 2000 the government promulgated the Anti-Corruption Act to combat corruption.

== Administrative divisions ==
Sierra Leone is divided into provinces, districts, and chiefdoms. Sierra Leone has 3 rural provinces, plus a capital city administrative province. There are then 14 districts - 12 rural, 2 for the capital Freetown.

Sierra Leone is further divided into 149 chiefdoms. The chiefdoms are hereditary, tribal units of local governance. The World Bank sponsored the creation of elected local councils in 2004.

<text>Cithaeron or Kithairon (Κιθαιρών, -ῶνος) is a mountain and mountain range about sixteen kilometres (ten miles) long in Central Greece. The range is the physical boundary between Boeotia region in the north and Attica region in the south. It is mainly composed of limestone and rises to . The north-east side of the range is formed by the mountain Pastra.

The range was the scene of many events in Greek mythology and was especially sacred to Dionysus. In Euripides&#x27; &quot;Bacchae&quot;, Dionysus carries out his dances and rites with his bacchants, his priestesses, on Cithaeron. Oedipus was exposed on the mountain, while Actaeon and Pentheus were both dismembered on its slopes. It was also the place where Heracles or Alcathous hunted and killed the Lion of Cithaeron.

In historic times, the mountain acted as a backdrop to the Battle of Plataea of 479 BC and was the scene of much skirmishing before the battle itself. In later times, fortifications were built both at Plataea and Erythrai as the mountain formed the disputed natural border between Athens and Thebes.

The people of Plataea also personified the mountain as their primal king: &quot;But the Plataeans know of no king except Asopus and Cithaeron before him, holding that the latter gave his name to the mountain, the former to the river&quot;. In one tale, Cithairon was said to have engaged in a singing contest against Helikon, which was judged by the Muses. Cithairon won the contest and was adorned with garlands by the Muses, and Helikon became so angry due to his defeat that he smashed one of the large rocks on his slopes.

In the Middle Ages, the village of Myoupolis on its slopes was the site of a monastery founded by Meletios the Younger.

<text>Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter ( ; born September 4, 1981), known mononymously as Beyoncé, is an American singer-songwriter, actress and businesswoman. She has had a significant impact on the music industry and is known for her vocal ability, musical versatility, live performances, and culturally important works.

Beyoncé rose to fame in 1997 as a member of Destiny&#x27;s Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Her debut solo album, &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot; (2003), became one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century and spawned the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one singles &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy&quot;. Beyoncé&#x27;s commercial success continued with the albums &quot;B&#x27;Day&quot; (2006), &quot;I Am... Sasha Fierce&quot; (2008) and &quot;4&quot; (2011), all of which featured hit singles including &quot;Check on It&quot;, &quot;Irreplaceable&quot;, &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot;, &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on it)&quot;, &quot;Halo&quot;, &quot;Run the World (Girls)&quot;, and &quot;Love On Top&quot;. She has also ventured into acting, starring in the films &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; (2002), &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; (2006), &quot;Cadillac Records&quot; (2008), &quot;Obsessed&quot; (2009) and &quot;Black Is King&quot; (2020), as well as voicing Nala in &quot;The Lion King&quot; (2019) and &quot;&quot; (2024).

Beyoncé&#x27;s career shifted after forming her own management company Parkwood Entertainment, creating monocultural events through acclaimed concept albums. She explored personal and political themes on &quot;Beyoncé&quot; (2013) and &quot;Lemonade&quot; (2016), which are credited with popularizing the surprise album and visual album. The former inspired setting Friday as the Global Release Day, while the latter was the best-selling album worldwide in 2016. Her ongoing trilogy project – currently consisting of the queer-inspired dance album &quot;Renaissance&quot; (2022) and Americana epic &quot;Cowboy Carter&quot; (2024) – has highlighted the contributions of Black pioneers to American musical and cultural history, spawning the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one singles &quot;Break My Soul&quot; and &quot;Texas Hold &#x27;Em&quot;.

Beyoncé is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 200 million records. She is the only female artist to debut all of their eight studio albums at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. She is the most awarded and nominated artist in the history of the Grammy Awards, as well as the most awarded artist at the BET, NAACP Image, and Soul Train Music Awards. Her inductions include the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; Hall of Fame and the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame. The first woman to headline an all-stadium tour, Beyoncé is one of the highest-grossing live acts in history. &quot;Billboard&quot; named her the Top Female Artist of the 2000s and the Greatest Pop Star of the 21st Century. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed her as one the greatest singers ever and included several of her albums, singles, and music videos among the greatest of all time.

==Early life==
Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born on September 4, 1981, at the Park Plaza Hospital in Houston, Texas, to Tina Knowles (), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager. Tina is Louisiana Creole and Mathew is African American. Beyoncé&#x27;s younger sister, Solange Knowles, is also a singer and a former backup dancer for Destiny&#x27;s Child. Solange and Beyoncé are the first sisters both to have had number one solo albums.

Beyoncé&#x27;s maternal grandparents, Lumis Albert Beyincé and Agnéz Deréon (daughter of Odilia Broussard and Eugène DeRouen), were French-speaking Louisiana Creoles, with roots in New Iberia; She is a descendant of Acadian militia officer Joseph Broussard, who was exiled to French Louisiana after the expulsion of the Acadians, and of the French military officer and Abenaki chief Jean-Vincent d&#x27;Abbadie, Baron de Saint-Castin. She has additional Breton heritage. Beyoncé&#x27;s fourth great-grandmother, Marie-Françoise Trahan, was born in 1774 in Bangor, located on Belle Île, France. Trahan was a daughter of Acadians who had taken refuge on Belle Île after the Acadian expulsion. The Estates of Brittany had divided the lands of Belle Île to distribute them among 78 other Acadian families and the already settled inhabitants. The Trahan family lived on Belle Île for over ten years before migrating to Louisiana, where she married a Broussard descendant. Beyoncé researched her ancestry and discovered that she is descended from a slave owner who married his slave. Her mother is also of distant Irish and Jewish ancestry. Beyoncé also has Belgian ancestry from Hainaut Province, Wallonia and is related to a former mayor of Froidchapelle, Belgium.

Beyoncé was raised with multiple religious traditions, attending St. John&#x27;s United Methodist Church in Houston as well as St. Mary of the Purification Catholic Church. She went to St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Montessori School in Houston and enrolled in dance classes there. Her singing ability was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and Beyoncé finished it, able to hit the high-pitched notes. Beyoncé&#x27;s interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven, singing John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; to beat 15/16-year-olds. In the fall of 1990, Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she performed with the school&#x27;s choir. She also attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts and later Alief Elsik High School. Beyoncé was also a member of the choir at St. John&#x27;s United Methodist Church where she sang her first solo and was a soloist for two years.

==Career==
===Career beginnings===
When Beyoncé was eight, she met LaTavia Roberson at an audition for an all-girl entertainment group. They were placed into a group called Girl&#x27;s Tyme with three other girls, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&amp;B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in &quot;Star Search&quot;, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl&#x27;s Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995, Beyoncé&#x27;s father, Mathew, resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced the family&#x27;s income by half, and Beyoncé&#x27;s parents were forced to sell their house and cars and move into separated apartments.

Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&amp;B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé&#x27;s parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins&#x27;s Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records with the assistance of Columbia talent scout Teresa LaBarbera Whites.

=== 1997–2002: Destiny&#x27;s Child ===

The group changed their name to Destiny&#x27;s Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah. In 1997, Destiny&#x27;s Child released their major label debut song &quot;Killing Time&quot; on the soundtrack to the 1997 film &quot;Men in Black&quot;. In November, the group released their debut single and first major hit, &quot;No, No, No&quot;. They released their self-titled debut album in February 1998, which established the group as a viable act in the music industry. The group released their Multi-Platinum second album &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; in 1999. The record features songs such as &quot;Bills, Bills, Bills&quot;, the group&#x27;s first number-one single, &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jumpin&#x27; and &quot;Say My Name&quot;, which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. &quot;Say My Name&quot; won the Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&amp;B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; sold more than eight million copies worldwide. During this time, Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song &quot;After All Is Said and Done&quot; for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, &quot;The Best Man&quot;, as well as &quot;Ways To Get Cut Off&quot;, a collaboration with fellow Columbia Records signee JoJo Robinson that was later shelved.

The remaining band members recorded &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. It became their best-charting single, topping the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks. In early 2001, while Destiny&#x27;s Child was completing their third album, Beyoncé landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, &quot;&quot;, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th-century opera &quot;Carmen&quot; by French composer Georges Bizet. When the third album &quot;Survivor&quot; was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold. The album spawned other number-one hits, &quot;Bootylicious&quot; and the title track, &quot;Survivor&quot;, the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. After releasing their holiday album &quot;8 Days of Christmas&quot; in October 2001, the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers.

In July 2002, Beyoncé made her theatrical film debut, playing Foxxy Cleopatra alongside Mike Myers in the comedy film &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;, which spent its first weekend atop the U.S. box office and grossed $73 million. Beyoncé released &quot;Work It Out&quot; as the lead single from its soundtrack album which entered the top ten in the UK, Norway, and Belgium. In 2003, Beyoncé starred opposite Cuba Gooding Jr. in the musical comedy &quot;The Fighting Temptations&quot; as Lilly, a single mother with whom Gooding&#x27;s character falls in love. The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed $30 million in the U.S. Beyoncé released &quot;Fighting Temptation&quot; as the lead single from the film&#x27;s soundtrack album, with Missy Elliott, MC Lyte, and Free which was also used to promote the film. Another of Beyoncé&#x27;s contributions to the soundtrack, &quot;Summertime&quot;, fared better on the U.S. charts.

On June 26, 2011, she became the first solo female artist to headline the main Pyramid stage at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival in over twenty years. The performance was lauded, with several publications noting an ascension in Knowles&#x27; capabilities as a live performer.

A one-hour film which aired on HBO on April 23, a corresponding album with the same title was released on the same day exclusively on Tidal. &quot;Lemonade&quot; debuted at number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making Beyoncé the first act in &quot;Billboard&quot; history to have their first six studio albums debut atop the chart; she broke a record previously tied with DMX in 2013. With all 12 tracks of &quot;Lemonade&quot; debuting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, Beyoncé also became the first female act to chart 12 or more songs at the same time. &quot;Lemonade&quot; was streamed 115 million times through Tidal, setting a record for the most-streamed album in a single week by a female artist in history. It was 2016&#x27;s third highest-selling album in the U.S. with 1.554 million copies sold in that time period within the country as well as the best-selling album worldwide with global sales of 2.5 million throughout the year.

&quot;Lemonade&quot; became the most critically acclaimed work of her career. Several music publications included the album among the best of 2016, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which listed &quot;Lemonade&quot; at number one. The album&#x27;s visuals were nominated in 11 categories at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards, the most ever received by Beyoncé in a single year, and went on to win 8 awards, including Video of the Year for &quot;Formation&quot;. The eight wins made Beyoncé the most-awarded artist in the history of the VMAs (24), surpassing Madonna (20). Beyoncé occupied the sixth place for &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2016 Person of the Year.

In January 2017, it was announced that Beyoncé would headline the Coachella Music and Arts Festival. This would have made Beyoncé only the second female headliner of the festival since it was founded in 1999. It was later announced on February 23, 2017, that Beyoncé would no longer be able to perform at the festival due to doctor&#x27;s concerns regarding her pregnancy. The festival owners announced that she would instead headline the 2018 festival. Upon the announcement of Beyoncé&#x27;s departure from the festival lineup, ticket prices dropped by 12%. At the 59th Grammy Awards in February 2017, &quot;Lemonade&quot; led the nominations with nine, including Album, Record, and Song of the Year for &quot;Lemonade&quot; and &quot;Formation&quot; respectively, ultimately winning two, Best Urban Contemporary Album for &quot;Lemonade&quot; and Best Music Video for &quot;Formation&quot;.

In September 2017, Beyoncé collaborated with J Balvin and Willy William, to release a remix of the song &quot;Mi Gente&quot;. Beyoncé donated all proceeds from the song to hurricane charities for those affected by Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in Texas, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and other Caribbean Islands. On November 10, Eminem released &quot;Walk on Water&quot; featuring Beyoncé as the lead single from his album &quot;Revival&quot;. On November 30, Ed Sheeran announced that Beyoncé would feature on the remix to his song &quot;Perfect&quot;. &quot;Perfect Duet&quot; was released on December 1, 2017. The song reached number-one in the United States, becoming Beyoncé&#x27;s sixth song of her solo career to do so.

=== 2018–2021: &quot;Everything Is Love&quot; and &quot;The Lion King&quot;===
On January 4, 2018, the music video of Beyoncé and Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;4:44&quot; collaboration, &quot;Family Feud&quot; was released. It was directed by Ava DuVernay. On March 1, 2018, DJ Khaled released &quot;Top Off&quot; as the first single from his forthcoming album &quot;Father of Asahd&quot; featuring Beyoncé, husband Jay-Z, and Future. On April 14, 2018, Beyoncé played the first of two weekends as the headlining act of the Coachella Music Festival. Her performance of April 14, attended by 125,000 festival-goers, was immediately praised, with multiple media outlets describing it as historic. It was also named one of the greatest concert performances of all time. The performance became the most-tweeted-about performance of weekend one, as well as the most-watched live Coachella performance and the most-watched live performance on YouTube of all time. The show paid tribute to black culture, specifically historically black colleges and universities and featured a live band with over 100 dancers. Destiny&#x27;s Child also reunited during the show. Its livestream on YouTube was the most watched of all time.

On June 6, 2018, Beyoncé and husband Jay-Z kicked-off the On the Run II Tour in Cardiff, United Kingdom. Ten days later, at their final London performance, the pair unveiled &quot;Everything Is Love&quot;, their joint studio album, credited under the name The Carters, and initially available exclusively on Tidal. The pair also released the video for the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Apeshit&quot;, on Beyoncé&#x27;s official YouTube channel. &quot;Everything Is Love&quot; received generally positive reviews, and debuted at number two on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with 123,000 album-equivalent units, of which 70,000 were pure album sales. On December 2, 2018, Beyoncé alongside Jay-Z headlined the Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 which was held at FNB Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa. Their 2-hour performance had concepts similar to the On the Run II Tour and Beyoncé was praised for her outfits, which paid tribute to Africa&#x27;s diversity.
&quot;&quot;, a documentary and concert film focusing on Beyoncé&#x27;s historic 2018 Coachella performances, was released by Netflix on April 17, 2019. The film was accompanied by the surprise live album &quot;&quot;. It was later reported that Beyoncé and Netflix had signed a $60 million deal to produce three different projects, one of which is &quot;Homecoming&quot;. &quot;Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé&quot; received six nominations at the 71st Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.

Beyoncé starred as the voice of Nala in the remake &quot;The Lion King&quot;, which was released in July 2019. Beyoncé is featured on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, released on July 11, 2019, with a remake of the song &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&quot; alongside Donald Glover, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, which was originally composed by Elton John. An original song from the film by Beyoncé, &quot;Spirit&quot;, was released as the lead single from both the soundtrack and &quot;The Lion King: The Gift&quot; – a companion album released alongside the film, produced and curated by Beyoncé.

Beyoncé called &quot;The Lion King: The Gift&quot; a &quot;sonic cinema&quot;. She stated that the album was influenced by R&amp;B, pop, hip hop, gqom and Afro Beat. The songs were produced by African producers, which Beyoncé said was because &quot;authenticity and heart were important to [her]&quot;, since the film is set in Africa. In September of the same year, a documentary chronicling the development, production and early music video filming of &quot;The Lion King: The Gift&quot; entitled &quot;Beyoncé Presents: Making The Gift&quot; was aired on ABC.

In April 2020, Beyoncé was featured on the remix of Megan Thee Stallion&#x27;s song &quot;Savage&quot;, marking her first music release for the year. The song peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, marking Beyoncé&#x27;s eleventh song to do so across all acts. On June 19, 2020, Beyoncé released the nonprofit charity single &quot;Black Parade&quot;. On June 23, she followed up the release of its studio version with an a cappella version exclusively on Tidal. &quot;Black Is King&quot;, a visual album based on the music of &quot;The Lion King: The Gift&quot;, premiered globally on Disney+ on July 31, 2020. Produced by Disney and Parkwood Entertainment, the film was written, directed and executively produced by Beyoncé. The film was described by Disney as &quot;a celebratory memoir for the world on the Black experience&quot;. Beyoncé received the most nominations (9) at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards and the most awards (4), which made her the most-awarded singer, most-awarded female artist, and second-most-awarded artist in Grammy history. In 2021, Beyoncé wrote and recorded a song titled &quot;Be Alive&quot; for the biographical drama film &quot;King Richard&quot;. She received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song at the 94th Academy Awards for the song, alongside co-writer Dixson.

=== 2022–present: &quot;Renaissance&quot; and &quot;Cowboy Carter&quot; ===
On March 27, 2022, Beyoncé performed &quot;Be Alive&quot; at the 94th Academy Awards. Choreographed by friend and past collaborator Fatima Robinson, Beyoncé was applauded for choosing to perform on the Compton tennis courts Venus and Serena Williams practiced on in their childhood instead of at the venue.

On June 9, 2022, Beyoncé removed her profile pictures across various social media platforms, causing speculation that she would be releasing new music. Days later, Beyoncé caused further speculation via her nonprofit BeyGood&#x27;s Twitter account hinting at her upcoming seventh studio album. On June 15, 2022, Beyoncé officially announced her seventh studio album, titled &quot;Renaissance&quot;. The lead single of &quot;Renaissance&quot;, &quot;Break My Soul&quot;, was released on June 20, 2022. The album was released on July 29, 2022. &quot;Break My Soul&quot; became Beyoncé&#x27;s 20th top ten single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, which made her join Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson as the only artists in Hot 100 history to achieve at least twenty top tens as a solo artist and ten as a member of a group.

As &quot;Renaissance&quot; was released, Beyoncé announced that the album was the first installment of a trilogy she conceived and recorded over three years during the COVID-19 pandemic, a time she found to be her &quot;most creative [period].&quot; The three recorded projects are designated into acts under Roman numerals. Upon release, &quot;Renaissance&quot; received universal acclaim from critics. &quot;Renaissance&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, making her the first female artist to have her first seven studio albums debut at number one in the United States. &quot;Break My Soul&quot; concurrently rose to number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the twelfth song to do so across her career discography.

On January 21, 2023, Beyoncé performed in Dubai at a private show. The performance, which was her first full concert in more than four years, was delivered to an audience of influencers and journalists. Beyoncé was reportedly paid $24 million to perform. Beyoncé faced criticism for her decision to perform in the United Arab Emirates where homosexuality is illegal. On February 1, Beyoncé announced the Renaissance World Tour with dates in North America and Europe, which would become for a short-span the highest-grossing tour by a female artist. On July 28, Beyoncé appeared on &quot;Delresto (Echoes)&quot;, the second single from rapper Travis Scott&#x27;s album &quot;Utopia&quot;, eventually becoming her 100th career appearance on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart (encompassing Destiny&#x27;s Child, her solo career, and musical duo The Carters). On November 30, 2023, Beyoncé released documentary concert film &quot;&quot; written, directed, and produced by her in collaboration with film distributor AMC Theatres. The film chronicles the development and execution of Beyoncé&#x27;s Renaissance World Tour, and contained new song &quot;My House&quot; in the end credits.

In February 2024, Beyoncé launched her hair care brand Cécred. On February 11, 2024, immediately following a partner commercial with Verizon for the Super Bowl LVIII, she announced the second installment of her trilogy project and released its first two songs, &quot;Texas Hold &#x27;Em&quot; and &quot;16 Carriages&quot;. &quot;Texas Hold &#x27;Em&quot; became her highest chart debut in her career, her ninth solo number-one and her thirteenth across all credits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. On March 12, 2024, she announced the album&#x27;s title, &quot;Cowboy Carter&quot;. A country and gospel-tinged record, it was released on March 29 to universal acclaim from critics, and includes collaborations with artists including Tanner Adell and her daughter Rumi Carter, Miley Cyrus, Tiera Kennedy, Willie Jones, Post Malone, Linda Martell, Willie Nelson, Shaboozey, Brittney Spencer, Dolly Parton, and Reyna Roberts.

In July 2024, NBC released two promotional commercials featuring Beyoncé for their coverage of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. Set to &quot;Cowboy Carter&quot; songs &quot;Ya Ya&quot; and &quot;Just For Fun&quot;, she introduced the entire USA Olympic Team and Gold-medal gymnast Simone Biles, respectively. On August 20, Beyoncé announced SirDavis, a whiskey in collaboration with Moët Hennessy developed for years prior and co-founded with master distiller Dr. Bill Lumsden. In October 2024, Levi&#x27;s launched a four-part global campaign with Beyoncé titled &quot;Reiimagine&quot; that will stretch into 2025 and focus on women&#x27;s history of the company, using &quot;Cowboy Carter&quot; track &quot;Levii&#x27;s Jeans&quot;. The first commercial starring Beyoncé amassed 2.4 billion impressions in under a month.

Beyoncé reprised her role as Nala for &quot;&quot;, a prequel to the 2019 remake, released in December 2024. She headlined the first ever NFL Christmas Gameday Halftime Show that month, performing songs from &quot;Cowboy Carter&quot; for the first time. The &quot;Cowboy Carter Tour&quot; was announced on February 1, 2025. At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, Beyoncé became the first Black artist in 50 years, since Charley Pride and The Pointer Sisters, to win an award in the country music categories. She is the first Black artist ever to win the Grammy Award for Best Country Album. She additionally won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, becoming the first Black woman to do so since Lauryn Hill won for &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; in 1999.

== Artistry ==
=== Voice and musical style ===
Critics have described Beyoncé&#x27;s voice as being mezzo-soprano. Jody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as &quot;one of the most compelling instruments in popular music&quot;. Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny&#x27;s Child. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that her voice is &quot;velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting&quot;. Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyoncé&#x27;s unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto.

Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; saying she was &quot;capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.&quot; On the 2023 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 200 Greatest Singers of all time, Beyoncé ranked at number 8, with the publication noting that &quot;in [her] voice lies the entire history of Black music&quot;.

Beyoncé&#x27;s music is generally R&amp;B, pop and hip hop but she also incorporates soul and funk into her songs. &quot;4&quot; demonstrated Beyoncé&#x27;s exploration of 1990s-style R&amp;B, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases. While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyoncé recorded several Spanish songs for &quot;Irreemplazable&quot; (re-recordings of songs from &quot;B&#x27;Day&quot; for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of &quot;B&#x27;Day&quot;. To record these, Beyoncé was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.

=== Songwriting ===
Beyoncé has received co-writing credits for most of her songs. Her early songs with Destiny&#x27;s Child were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like &quot;Independent Women&quot; and &quot;Survivor&quot;, but after the start of her relationship with Jay-Z, she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as &quot;Cater 2 U&quot;.

Beyoncé&#x27;s songwriting process is also known for combining parts of different tracks, resulting in alteration of song structures. Sia, who co-wrote &quot;Pretty Hurts&quot;, called Beyoncé &quot;very Frankenstein when she comes to songs&quot;; Diana Gordon, who co-wrote &quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt Yourself&quot; called her a &quot;scientist of songs&quot;; Caroline Polachek who co-wrote &quot;No Angel&quot;, called her a &quot;genius writer and producer for this reason. She&#x27;s so good at seeing connections.&quot;

In 2001, she became the first Black woman and second female lyricist to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards. Beyoncé was the third woman to have writing credits on three number-one songs (&quot;Irreplaceable&quot;, &quot;Grillz&quot; and &quot;Check on It&quot;) in the same year, after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. She is tied with American lyricist Diane Warren at third with nine songwriting credits on number-one singles. The latter wrote her song &quot;I Was Here&quot; for &quot;4&quot;, which was motivated by the September 11 attacks. In May 2011, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine listed Beyoncé at number 17 on their list of the Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. She was one of only three women on that list, along with Alicia Keys and Taylor Swift.

Beyoncé has received criticism, including from journalists and musicians, for the extensive writing credits on her songs. The controversy surrounding her songwriting credits began with interviews in which she attributed herself as the songwriter for songs in which she was a co-writer or for which her contributions were marginal. In a cover story for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 2005, she claimed to have &quot;written&quot; several number-one songs for Destiny&#x27;s Child, contrary to the credits, which list her as a co-writer among others. During a 2007 interview with Barbara Walters, she claimed to have conceived the musical idea for the Destiny&#x27;s Child song &quot;Bootylicious&quot;, which provoked the song&#x27;s producer Rob Fusari to call her father and then-manager Mathew Knowles in protest over the claim. In 2010, Fusari told &quot;Billboard&quot;: &quot;[Knowles] explained to me, in a nice way, he said, &#x27;People don&#x27;t want to hear about Rob Fusari, producer from Livingston, N.J. No offense, but that&#x27;s not what sells records. What sells records is people believing that the artist is everything. However, in an interview for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2016, Fusari said Beyoncé &quot;had the &#x27;Bootylicious&#x27; concept in her head. That was totally her. She knew what she wanted to say. It was very urban pop angle that they were taking on the record.&quot;

=== Production ===
Beyoncé&#x27;s collaborators frequently mention her involvement in the record production of her songs, sometimes describing her as a genius in the skill. She is known to have favorite saturation and distortion plug‑ins, intentionality about stereo imaging and concentration on individual elements of her songs as a &quot;focal point&quot; in production.

=== Influences ===

Beyoncé names Michael Jackson as her major musical influence. Aged five, Beyoncé attended her first ever concert where Jackson performed and she claims to have realized her purpose. When she presented him with a tribute award at the World Music Awards in 2006, Beyoncé said, &quot;if it wasn&#x27;t for Michael Jackson, I would never ever have performed.&quot; Beyoncé was heavily influenced by Tina Turner, and once said &quot;Tina Turner is someone that I admire, because she made her strength feminine and sexy&quot;.

She admires Diana Ross as an &quot;all-around entertainer&quot;, and Whitney Houston, who she said &quot;inspired me to get up there and do what she did&quot;. Beyoncé cited Madonna as an influence &quot;not only for her musical style, but also for her business sense&quot;, saying that she wanted to &quot;follow in the footsteps of Madonna and be a powerhouse and have my own empire&quot;. She also credits Mariah Carey&#x27;s singing and her song &quot;Vision of Love&quot; as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child. Her other musical influences include Rachelle Ferrell, Aaliyah, Janet Jackson, Prince, Lauryn Hill, Sade Adu, Donna Summer, Fairuz, Mary J. Blige, Selena, Anita Baker, and Toni Braxton.

The feminism and female empowerment themes on Beyoncé&#x27;s second solo album &quot;B&#x27;Day&quot; were inspired by her role in &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; and by singer Josephine Baker. Beyoncé paid homage to Baker by performing &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; at the 2006 Fashion Rocks concert wearing Baker&#x27;s trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas. Beyoncé&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;I Am... Sasha Fierce&quot;, was inspired by Jay-Z and especially by Etta James, whose &quot;boldness&quot; inspired Beyoncé to explore other musical genres and styles. Her fourth solo album, &quot;4&quot;, was inspired by Fela Kuti, 1990s R&amp;B, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, DeBarge, Lionel Richie, Teena Marie, The Jackson 5, New Edition, Adele, Florence and the Machine, and Prince.

Beyoncé has stated that she is personally inspired by Michelle Obama (the 44th First Lady of the United States), saying &quot;she proves you can do it all&quot;, and has described Oprah Winfrey as &quot;the definition of inspiration and a strong woman&quot;. She has also discussed how Jay-Z is a continuing inspiration to her, both with what she describes as his lyrical genius and in the obstacles he has overcome in his life. Beyoncé has expressed admiration for the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, posting in a letter &quot;what I find in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, I search for in every day in music ... he is lyrical and raw&quot;. Beyoncé has also cited Cher as a fashion inspiration.

=== Videography and stage ===
In 2006, Beyoncé introduced her all-female tour band Suga Mama (also the name of a song on &quot;B&#x27;Day&quot;) which includes bassists, drummers, guitarists, horn players, keyboardists and percussionists. Her background singers, The Mamas, consist of Montina Cooper-Donnell, Crystal Collins and Tiffany Moniqué Riddick. They made their debut appearance at the 2006 BET Awards and re-appeared in the music videos for &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; and &quot;Green Light&quot;. The band have supported Beyoncé in most subsequent live performances, including her 2007 concert tour The Beyoncé Experience, I Am... Tour (2009–2010), The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013–2014) and The Formation World Tour (2016).

Beyoncé has received praise for her stage presence and voice during live performances. According to Barbara Ellen of &quot;The Guardian,&quot; Beyoncé is the most in-charge female artist she&#x27;s seen onstage. Similarly, Alice Jones of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote she &quot;takes her role as entertainer so seriously she&#x27;s almost too good&quot;. The ex-President of Def Jam L.A. Reid has described Beyoncé as the greatest entertainer alive. Jim Farber of the &quot;Daily News&quot; and Stephanie Classen of &quot;The StarPhoenix&quot; both praised her strong voice and her stage presence. 
Beyoncé has worked with numerous directors for her music videos throughout her career, including Melina Matsoukas, Jonas Åkerlund, and Jake Nava. Bill Condon, director of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, stated that the &quot;Lemonade&quot; visuals in particular served as inspiration for his film, commenting, &quot;You look at Beyoncé&#x27;s brilliant movie &quot;Lemonade&quot;, this genre is taking on so many different forms ... I do think that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want.&quot;

=== Alter ego ===
Described as being &quot;sexy, seductive and provocative&quot; when performing on stage, Beyoncé has said that she originally created the alter ego &quot;Sasha Fierce&quot; to keep that stage persona separate from who she really is. She described Sasha Fierce as being &quot;too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy&quot;, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m not like her in real life at all.&quot; Sasha was conceived during the making of &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;, and Beyoncé introduced her with the release of her 2008 album, &quot;I Am... Sasha Fierce&quot;. In February 2010, she announced in an interview with &quot;Allure&quot; magazine that she was comfortable enough with herself to no longer need Sasha Fierce. However, Beyoncé announced in May 2012 that she would bring her back for her &quot;Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live&quot; shows later that month.

== Public image ==
Beyoncé has been described as having sex appeal, with music journalist Touré writing that since the release of &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot;, she has &quot;become a crossover sex symbol&quot;. When off stage, Beyoncé says that while she likes to dress sexily, her onstage dress &quot;is absolutely for the stage&quot;. Due to her curves and the term&#x27;s catchiness, in the 2000s, the media often used the term &quot;&quot; (a portmanteau of the words &quot;booty&quot; and &quot;delicious&quot;) to describe Beyoncé, the term popularized by the single of the same name by her group Destiny&#x27;s Child. In 2006, it was added to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

In September 2010, Beyoncé made her runway modelling debut at Tom Ford&#x27;s Spring/Summer 2011 fashion show. She was named the &quot;World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Woman&quot; by &quot;People&quot; and the &quot;Hottest Female Singer of All Time&quot; by &quot;Complex&quot; in 2012. In January 2013, &quot;GQ&quot; placed her on its cover, featuring her atop its &quot;100 Sexiest Women of the 21st Century&quot; list. VH1 listed her at number 1 on its 100 Sexiest Artists list. Several wax figures of Beyoncé are found at Madame Tussauds Wax Museums in major cities around the world.

According to Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli, Beyoncé uses different fashion styles to work with her music while performing. Her mother co-wrote a book, published in 2002, titled &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Style&quot;, an account of how fashion affected the trio&#x27;s success. The &quot;B&#x27;Day Anthology Video Album&quot; showed many instances of fashion-oriented footage, depicting classic to contemporary wardrobe styles. In 2007, Beyoncé was featured on the cover of the &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot;, becoming the second African American woman after model and television personality Tyra Banks, and &quot;People&quot; magazine recognized Beyoncé as the best-dressed celebrity.

Beyoncé has been nicknamed &quot;Queen Bey&quot; by publications over the years. The term is a reference to the common phrase &quot;queen bee&quot;, a term used for the leader of a group of females. The nickname also refers to the Queen bee of a beehive, with her fan base being named &quot;BeyHive&quot;. &quot;BeyHive&quot; was previously titled &quot;The Beyontourage&quot;, (a portmanteau of Beyoncé and entourage), but was changed after online petitions on Twitter and online news reports during competitions.

In 2006, the animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), criticized Beyoncé for wearing and using fur in her clothing line House of Deréon. Emmett Price, a professor of music at Northeastern University, wrote in 2007 that he thinks race plays a role in many criticisms of Beyoncé&#x27;s image, saying white celebrities who dress similarly do not attract as many comments. In 2008, the French personal care company L&#x27;Oréal was accused of whitening her skin in Feria hair color advertisements, responding that &quot;it is categorically untrue&quot;, while Beyoncé reportedly pressured H&amp;M to use &quot;only natural pictures&quot; instead of retouching images in a 2013 campaign.

Beyoncé has been a vocal advocate for the Black Lives Matter movement. The release of &quot;Formation&quot; on February 6, 2016, saw her celebrate her Sub-Saharan Black African ancestry, with the song&#x27;s music video featuring pro-black imagery and a shot of wall graffiti that says &quot;Stop shooting us&quot;. The day after the song&#x27;s release, she performed it at the 2016 Super Bowl halftime show with back up dancers dressed to represent the Black Panther Party. This incited criticism from conservative politicians and police officers, with some police boycotting Beyoncé&#x27;s then upcoming Formation World Tour. Beyoncé responded to the backlash by releasing tour merchandise that said &quot;Boycott Beyoncé&quot;, and later clarified her sentiment, saying: &quot;Anyone who perceives my message as anti-police is completely mistaken. I have so much admiration and respect for officers and the families of officers who sacrifice themselves to keep us safe,&quot; Beyoncé said. &quot;But let&#x27;s be clear: I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things.&quot;

== Personal life ==
=== Marriage and children ===

In 2002, Beyoncé and Jay-Z collaborated on the song &quot;&#x27;03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot;, which appeared on his seventh album &quot;The Blueprint 2: The Gift &amp; The Curse&quot; (2002). Beyoncé appeared as Jay-Z&#x27;s girlfriend in the music video for the song, fueling speculation about their relationship. On April 4, 2008, Beyoncé and Jay-Z married without publicity. , the couple had sold a combined 300 million records together. They are known for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed since 2013. Both have acknowledged difficulty that arose in their marriage after Jay-Z had an affair.

Beyoncé miscarried around 2010 or 2011, describing it as &quot;the saddest thing&quot; she had ever endured. She returned to the studio and wrote music to cope with the loss. In April 2011, Beyoncé and Jay-Z traveled to Paris to shoot the album cover for &quot;4&quot;, and she unexpectedly became pregnant in Paris. In August, the couple attended the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, at which Beyoncé performed &quot;Love On Top&quot; and ended the performance by revealing she was pregnant. Her appearance helped that year&#x27;s MTV Video Music Awards become the most-watched broadcast in MTV history, pulling in 12.4 million viewers; the announcement was listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; for &quot;most tweets per second recorded for a single event&quot; on Twitter, receiving 8,868 tweets per second and &quot;Beyonce pregnant&quot; was the most Googled phrase the week of August 29, 2011. On January 7, 2012, Beyoncé gave birth to a daughter, Blue Ivy, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

Following the release of &quot;Lemonade&quot;, which included the single &quot;Sorry&quot;, in 2016, speculations arose about Jay-Z&#x27;s alleged infidelity with a mistress referred to as &quot;Becky&quot;. Jon Pareles in &quot;The New York Times&quot; pointed out that many of the accusations were &quot;aimed specifically and recognizably&quot; at him. Similarly, Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted the lines &quot;Suck on my balls, I&#x27;ve had enough&quot; were an &quot;unmistakable hint&quot; that the lyrics revolve around Jay-Z.

On February 1, 2017, she revealed on her Instagram account that she was expecting twins. Her announcement gained over 6.3 million likes within eight hours, breaking the world record for the most liked image on the website at the time. On July 13, 2017, Beyoncé uploaded the first image of herself and the twins onto her Instagram account, confirming their birth date as a month prior, on June 13, 2017, with the post becoming the second most liked on Instagram, behind her own pregnancy announcement. The twins, a daughter named Rumi and a son named Sir, were born at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in California via caesarean section. She wrote of her pregnancy and its aftermath in the September 2018 issue of &quot;Vogue&quot;, in which she had full control of the cover, shot at Hammerwood Park by photographer Tyler Mitchell.

=== Politics ===
Beyoncé performed &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; at President Barack Obama&#x27;s 2009 presidential inauguration, as well as &quot;At Last&quot; during the first inaugural dance at the Neighborhood Ball two days later. The couple held a fundraiser at Jay-Z&#x27;s 40/40 Club in Manhattan for President Obama&#x27;s 2012 presidential campaign which raised $4 million. Beyoncé voted for Obama in the 2012 presidential election. She performed the American national anthem &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at his second inauguration in January 2013.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in May 2015, that Beyoncé attended a major celebrity fundraiser for 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. She also headlined for Clinton in a concert held the weekend before Election Day the next year. In this performance, Beyoncé and her entourage of backup dancers wore pantsuits; a clear allusion to Clinton&#x27;s frequent dress-of-choice. The backup dancers also wore &quot;I&#x27;m with her&quot; tee shirts, the campaign slogan for Clinton. In a brief speech at this performance Beyoncé said, &quot;I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and knowing that her possibilities are limitless.&quot; She endorsed the bid of Beto O&#x27;Rourke during the 2018 United States Senate election in Texas.

In July 2024, Beyoncé gave Vice President Kamala Harris permission to use &quot;Lemonade&quot; promotional single &quot;Freedom&quot; as the official song for her 2024 presidential campaign. Harris subsequently launched a digital ad in support of her candidacy featuring the song. In October 2024, Beyoncé, alongside her mother Tina and Kelly Rowland endorsed Harris for president at a campaign rally in her hometown of Houston.

=== Activism ===
In a 2013 interview with &quot;Vogue&quot;, Beyoncé stated that she considered herself to be &quot;a modern-day feminist&quot;. She would later align herself more publicly with the movement, sampling &quot;We should all be feminists&quot;, a speech delivered by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at a TEDx talk in April 2013, in her song &quot;Flawless&quot;, released later that year. The next year she performed live at the MTV Video Awards in front a giant backdrop reading &quot;Feminist&quot;. Her self-identification incited a circulation of opinions and debate about whether her feminism is aligned with older, more established feminist ideals. Annie Lennox, celebrated artist and feminist advocate, referred to Beyoncé&#x27;s use of her word feminist as &#x27;feminist lite&#x27;.

Adichie responded with &quot;her type of feminism is not mine, as it is the kind that, at the same time, gives quite a lot of space to the necessity of men.&quot; Adichie expands upon what &quot;feminist lite&quot; means to her, referring that &quot;more troubling is the idea, in Feminism Lite, that men are naturally superior but should be expected to &#x27;treat women well&#x27;&quot; and &quot;we judge powerful women more harshly than we judge powerful men. And Feminism Lite enables this.&quot;

Beyoncé responded about her intent by utilizing the definition of feminist with her platform was to &quot;give clarity to the true meaning&quot; behind it. She says to understand what being a feminist is, &quot;it&#x27;s very simple. It&#x27;s someone who believes in equal rights for men and women.&quot; She advocated to provide equal opportunities for young boys and girls, men and women must begin to understand the double standards that remain persistent in our societies and the issue must be illuminated in effort to start making changes.

She has also contributed to the Ban Bossy campaign, which uses TV and social media to encourage leadership in girls. Following Beyoncé&#x27;s public identification as a feminist, the sexualized nature of her performances and the fact that she championed her marriage was questioned.

In December 2012, Beyoncé along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for &quot;Demand A Plan&quot;, a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 U.S. mayors and others designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Beyoncé publicly endorsed same-sex marriage on March 26, 2013, after the Supreme Court debate on California&#x27;s Proposition 8. She spoke against North Carolina&#x27;s Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act, a bill passed (and later repealed) that discriminated against the LGBT community in public places in a statement during her concert in Raleigh as part of the Formation World Tour in 2016.

She has condemned police brutality against black Americans. She and Jay-Z attended a rally in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin. The film for her sixth album &quot;Lemonade&quot; included the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, holding pictures of their sons in the video for &quot;Freedom&quot;. In a 2016 interview with &quot;Elle&quot;, Beyoncé responded to the controversy surrounding her song &quot;Formation&quot; which was perceived to be critical of the police. She clarified, &quot;I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things. If celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me&quot;.

In February 2017, Beyoncé spoke out against the withdrawal of protections for transgender students in public schools by Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential administration. Posting a link to the &quot;100 Days of Kindness&quot; campaign on her Facebook page, Beyoncé voiced her support for transgender youth and joined a roster of celebrities who spoke out against Trump&#x27;s decision.

=== Interests ===

Some of these include canvas painting, video editing, poetry, scriptwriting, lighting and stage design, animation and clothes design, photography, cultural historiography and beekeeping (with around 80,000 bees).

=== Wealth ===
&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine began reporting on Beyoncé&#x27;s earnings in 2008, calculating that the $80 million earned between June 2007 to June 2008, for her music, tour, films and clothing line made her the world&#x27;s best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion. It placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009 and ninth on the &quot;Most Powerful Women in the World&quot; list in 2010. The following year, the magazine placed her eighth on the &quot;Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30&quot; list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, &quot;Forbes&quot; placed Beyoncé at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album &quot;4&quot;, clothing line and endorsement deals.

For the years 2009 to 2011, Beyoncé earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012. In 2013, Beyoncé&#x27;s endorsements of Pepsi and H&amp;M made her and Jay-Z the world&#x27;s first billion-dollar couple in the music industry. That year, Beyoncé was listed as the fourth-most-powerful celebrity in the &quot;Forbes&quot; rankings.

In June 2014, Beyoncé ranked at number one on the &quot;Forbes&quot; Celebrity 100 list, earning an estimated $115 million throughout June 2013 – June 2014. This in turn was the first time she had topped the Celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly earnings to date. In 2016, Beyoncé ranked at number 34 on the Celebrity 100 list with earnings of $54 million. She and Jay-Z also topped the highest-paid celebrity couple list, with combined earnings of $107.5 million.

Beyoncé is one of the wealthiest musical artists. , &quot;Forbes&quot; calculated her net worth to be $355 million, and in June of the same year, ranked her as the 35th-highest-earning celebrity, with annual earnings of $60 million. This tied Beyoncé with Madonna as the only two female artists to earn more than $100 million within a single year twice. As a couple, Beyoncé and Jay-Z have a combined net worth of $1.16 billion. In July 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; announced that Beyoncé was the highest-paid musician of 2016, with an estimated total of $62.1 million. By December 2023, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Beyoncé&#x27;s net worth to be $800 million.

In 2023, the couple bought a house in Malibu, California, designed by the architect Tadao Ando, for $200 million. It established a record for the most expensive residence sold in the state of California.

== Legacy ==

Beyoncé has been recognized as one of the most influential figures in music history by numerous publications, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and the Associated Press. She was named &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Greatest Pop Star of the 21st Century, and topped NPR list of the &quot;21st Century&#x27;s Most Influential Women Musicians&quot;. She was repeatedly named the defining artist of both the 2000s decade and the 2010s decade. In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, music critic Jody Rosen described Beyoncé as &quot;the most important and compelling popular musician of the twenty-first century ... the result, the logical end point, of a century-plus of pop.&quot; James Clear, in his book &quot;Atomic Habits&quot; (2018), draws a parallel between Beyoncé&#x27;s success and the dramatic transformations in modern society: &quot;In the last one hundred years, we have seen the rise of the car, the airplane, the television, the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone, and Beyoncé.&quot; In 2018, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included her on its Millennial 100 list.

Beyoncé has revolutionized the music industry, transforming the production, distribution, promotion, and consumption of music. Beyoncé has been credited with reviving the album format in an era dominated by singles and streaming, with albums becoming increasingly cohesive and narrative-led. She revolutionized how music is released and marketed with the invention of the surprise album, which became a common practice in the 2010s and 2020s. This move was &quot;arguably the single most pivotal moment in all of 21st-century pop music&quot; according to &quot;Billboard&quot;, with Beyoncé reorienting the music market to cohesive albums and unconventional promotional rollouts. She is also credited with reviving the music video as an art form and popularizing the visual album. Her impact on the music industry led to the Global Release Day being moved to Friday.

Beyoncé&#x27;s artistic innovations, such as staccato rap-singing and chopped and re-pitched vocals, have changed the sound of popular music and became defining features of the 21st-century music landscape. With her work frequently transcending traditional genre boundaries, Beyoncé has created new artistic standards that have shaped contemporary music and set the precedent for music artists to move between and beyond genre confines. Beyoncé has helped to revive and popularize several genres of music, including hip-hop in the 2000s, R&amp;B in the 2010s, Afrobeats in the late 2010s / early 2020s, and country music in the 2020s.

Beyoncé has been recognized as setting the playbook for music artists in the modern era, with musicians from across genres, generations and countries citing her as a major influence on their career. Taylor Swift described Beyoncé&#x27;s as a major influence and a &quot;guiding light throughout my career&quot;, who has &quot;paved the road&quot; and shown how to &quot;break rules and defy industry norms&quot;. Lady Gaga explained how Beyoncé gave her the determination to become a musician, recalling seeing her in Destiny&#x27;s Child music video and saying: &quot;Oh, she&#x27;s a star. I want that.&quot; Rihanna was inspired to start her singing career after watching Beyoncé, telling &quot;etalk&quot; that after Beyoncé released &quot;Dangerously In Love&quot; (2003), &quot;I was like &#x27;wow, I want to be just like that.&#x27; She&#x27;s huge and just an inspiration.&quot; Ariana Grande learned to sing by mimicking Beyoncé. Adele cited Beyoncé as her inspiration and favorite artist, telling &quot;Vogue&quot;: &quot;She&#x27;s been a huge and constant part of my life as an artist since I was about ten or eleven ... I think she&#x27;s inspiring. She&#x27;s beautiful. She&#x27;s ridiculously talented, and she is one of the kindest people I&#x27;ve ever met ... She makes me want to do things with my life.&quot; Both Paul McCartney and Garth Brooks said they watch Beyoncé&#x27;s performances to get inspiration for their shows, with Brooks saying that when watching one of her performances, &quot;take out your notebook and take notes. No matter how long you&#x27;ve been on the stage – take notes on that one.&quot;

She is known for coining popular phrases such as &quot;put a ring on it&quot;, a term for marriage proposal, &quot;I woke up like this&quot;, which started a trend of posting morning selfies with the hashtag #iwokeuplikethis, and &quot;boy, bye&quot;, which was used as part of the Democratic National Committee&#x27;s campaign for the 2020 election. In January 2012, research scientist Bryan Lessard named &quot;Scaptia beyonceae&quot;, a species of horse-fly found in Northern Queensland, Australia after Beyoncé due to the fly&#x27;s unique golden hairs on its abdomen.

=== Endorsements and partnerships ===
Beyoncé has worked with Pepsi since 2002, and in 2004 appeared in a Gladiator-themed commercial with Britney Spears, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias. In 2012, Beyoncé signed a $50 million deal to endorse Pepsi. The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPINET) wrote Beyoncé an open letter asking her to reconsider the deal because of the unhealthiness of the product and to donate the proceeds to a medical organisation. Nevertheless, NetBase found that Beyoncé&#x27;s campaign was the most talked about endorsement in April 2013, with a 70 percent positive audience response to the commercial and print ads.

The release of a video-game &quot;Starpower: Beyoncé&quot; was cancelled after Beyoncé pulled out of a $100 million deal with GateFive who alleged the cancellation meant the sacking of 70 staff and millions of pounds lost in development. It was settled out of court by her lawyers in June 2013 who said that they had cancelled because GateFive had lost its financial backers. Beyoncé also has had deals with American Express, Nintendo DS and L&#x27;Oréal since the age of 18.

In March 2015, Beyoncé became a co-owner, with other artists, of the music streaming service Tidal. The service specializes in lossless audio and high definition music videos.

Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry.

In November 2020, Beyoncé formed a multi-year partnership with exercise equipment and media company Peloton. The partnership was formed to celebrate homecoming season in historically black colleges and universities, providing themed workout experiences inspired by Beyoncé&#x27;s 2019 &quot;Homecoming&quot; film and after 2020&#x27;s homecoming celebrations were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the partnership, Beyoncé and Peloton are donating free memberships to all students at 10 HBCUs, and Peloton are pursuing long-term recruiting partnerships at the HCBUs. Gwen Bethel Riley, head of music at Peloton, said: &quot;When we had conversations with Beyoncé around how critical a social impact component was to all of us, it crystallized how important it was to embrace Homecoming as an opportunity to celebrate and create dialogue around Black culture and music, in partnership with HBCUs.&quot; Upon news of the partnership, a decline in Peloton&#x27;s shares reversed, and its shares rose by 8.6%.

In 2021, Beyoncé and Jay-Z partnered with Tiffany &amp; Co. for the company&#x27;s &quot;About Love&quot; campaign. Beyoncé became the fourth woman, and first Black woman, to wear the 128.54-carat Tiffany Yellow Diamond. The campaign featured a robin egg blue painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat titled &quot;Equals Pi&quot; (1982). Both Beyonce and the brand faced significant backlash for the campaign, as the Tiffany Yellow Diamond, which was discovered in the Kimberley diamond mines in South Africa in 1877, is classified as a blood diamond and viewed as a symbol of British colonialism over Africa.

=== Fashion lines ===
Beyoncé and her mother introduced House of Deréon, a women&#x27;s fashion line, in 2005. The concept is inspired by three generations of women in their family, with the name paying tribute to Beyoncé&#x27;s grandmother, Agnèz Deréon, a respected seamstress. According to Tina, the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyoncé&#x27;s taste and style. Beyoncé and her mother founded their family&#x27;s company Beyond Productions, which provides the licensing and brand management for House of Deréon, and its junior collection, Deréon. House of Deréon pieces were exhibited in Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s shows and tours, during their &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; era. The collection features sportswear, denim offerings with fur, outerwear and accessories that include handbags and footwear, and are available at department and specialty stores across the U.S. and Canada.

In 2005, Beyoncé teamed up with House of Brands, a shoe company, to produce a range of footwear for House of Deréon. In January 2008, Starwave Mobile launched Beyoncé Fashion Diva, a &quot;high-style&quot; mobile game with a social networking component, featuring the House of Deréon collection. In July 2009, Beyoncé and her mother launched a new junior apparel label, Sasha Fierce for Deréon, for back-to-school selling. The collection included sportswear, outerwear, handbags, footwear, eyewear, lingerie and jewelry. It was available at department stores including Macy&#x27;s and Dillard&#x27;s, and specialty stores Jimmy Jazz and Against All Odds. In May 2010, Beyoncé teamed up with clothing store C&amp;A to launch Deréon by Beyoncé at their stores in Brazil. The collection included tailored blazers with padded shoulders, little black dresses, embroidered tops and shirts and bandage dresses.

In October 2014, Beyoncé signed a deal to launch an activewear line of clothing with British fashion retailer Topshop. The 50–50 venture is called Ivy Park and was launched in April 2016. The brand&#x27;s name is a nod to Beyoncé&#x27;s daughter and her favorite number four (IV in Roman numerals), and also references the park where she used to run in Texas. She has since bought out Topshop owner Philip Green from his 50% share after he was alleged to have sexually harassed, bullied and racially abused employees. She now owns the brand herself.

In April 2019, it was announced that Beyoncé would become a creative partner with Adidas and further develop her athletic brand Ivy Park with the company. Knowles will also develop new clothes and footwear for Adidas. Shares for the company rose 1.3% upon the news release. In December 2019, they announced a launch date of January 18, 2020. Beyoncé uploaded a teaser on her website and Instagram. The collection was previewed on the upcoming &quot;Elle&quot; January 2020 issue, where Beyoncé is seen wearing several garments, accessories and footwear from the first collection. In February 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that the line was struggling financially with revenue falling by more than 50% over the past fiscal year to $40 million; well short of the company&#x27;s $250 million projected forecast. In March 2023, it was announced that Beyoncé and Adidas reached a mutual decision to end their partnership.

In March 2023, Olivier Rousteing, the creative director of Balmain, announced that he and Beyoncé collaborated on a couture collection complete with sixteen looks corresponding to the sixteen tracks on her album &quot;Renaissance&quot;. This &quot;Renaissance Couture&quot; collection marked the first time that a Black woman oversaw the development of a collection from a Parisian couture house.

In September 2024, Beyoncé partnered with Levi Strauss &amp; Co. to remake a classic &#x27;80s &#x27;Launderette&#x27; campaign. Michelle Gass, the CEO of Levis Strauss &amp; Co., shared insights regarding the advantages of the company&#x27;s collaboration with Beyoncé, emphasizing that the advertising campaign could significantly enhance sales in the women&#x27;s clothing segment.

=== Philanthropy ===
In 2002, Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Tina Knowles built the Knowles-Rowland Center for Youth, a community center in Downtown Houston. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Beyoncé and Rowland founded the Survivor Foundation to provide transitional housing to displaced families and provide means for new building construction, to which Beyoncé contributed an initial $250,000. The foundation has since expanded to work with other charities in the city, and also provided relief following Hurricane Ike three years later. Beyoncé also donated $100,000 to the Gulf Coast Ike Relief Fund. In 2007, Beyoncé founded the Knowles-Temenos Place Apartments, a housing complex offering living space for 43 displaced individuals. As of 2016, Beyoncé had donated $7 million for the maintenance of the complex.

After starring in &quot;Cadillac Records&quot; in 2009 and learning about Phoenix House, a non-profit drug and alcohol rehabilitation organization, Beyoncé donated her full $4 million salary from the film to the organization. Beyoncé and her mother subsequently established the Beyoncé Cosmetology Center, which offers a seven-month cosmetology training course helping Phoenix House&#x27;s clients gain career skills during their recovery.

In January 2010, Beyoncé participated in George Clooney and Wyclef Jean&#x27;s Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief telethon, donated a large sum to the organization, and was named the official face of the limited edition Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) &quot;Fashion For Haiti&quot; T-shirt. In April 2011, Beyoncé joined forces with U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama and the National Association of Broadcasters Education Foundation, to help boost the latter&#x27;s campaign against child obesity by reworking her single &quot;Get Me Bodied&quot;. Following the death of Osama bin Laden, Beyoncé released her cover of the Lee Greenwood song &quot;God Bless the U.S.A.&quot;, as a charity single to help raise funds for the New York Police and Fire Widows&#x27; and Children&#x27;s Benefit Fund.

Beyoncé became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song &quot;I Was Here&quot; and its music video, shot in the UN, to the campaign. In 2013, it was announced that Beyoncé would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci &quot;Chime for Change&quot; campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to her new music. A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013, in London. With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls. Beyoncé also took part in &quot;Miss a Meal&quot;, a food-donation campaign, and supported Goodwill Industries through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and the U.S.

Beyoncé and Jay-Z secretly donated tens of thousands of dollars to bail out Black Lives Matter protesters in Baltimore and Ferguson, as well as funded infrastructure for the establishment of Black Lives Matter chapters across the U.S. Before Beyoncé&#x27;s Formation World Tour show in Tampa, her team held a private luncheon for more than 20 community leaders to discuss how Beyoncé could support local charitable initiatives, including pledging on the spot to fund 10 scholarships to provide students with financial aid. Tampa Sports Authority board member Thomas Scott said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know of a prior artist meeting with the community, seeing what their needs are, seeing how they can invest in the community. It says a lot to me about Beyoncé. She not only goes into a community and walks away with (money), but she also gives money back to that community.&quot;

In June 2016, Beyoncé donated over $82,000 to the United Way of Genesee County to support victims of the Flint water crisis. Beyoncé additionally donated money to support 14 students in Michigan with their college expenses. In August 2016, Beyoncé and Jay-Z donated $1.5 million to civil rights groups including Black Lives Matter, Hands Up United and Dream Defenders. After Hurricane Matthew, Beyoncé and Jay-Z donated $15 million to the Usain Bolt Foundation to support its efforts in rebuilding homes in Haiti.

During Hurricane Harvey in August 2017, Beyoncé launched BeyGOOD Houston to support those affected by the hurricane in Houston. The organization donated necessities such as cots, blankets, pillows, baby products, feminine products and wheelchairs, and funded long-term revitalization projects. On September 8, Beyoncé visited Houston, where she sponsored a lunch for 400 survivors at her local church, visited the George R Brown Convention Center to discuss with people displaced by the flooding about their needs, served meals to those who lost their homes, and made a significant donation to local causes. Beyoncé additionally donated $75,000 worth of new mattresses to survivors of the hurricane. Later that month, Beyoncé released a remix of J Balvin and Willy William&#x27;s &quot;Mi Gente&quot;, with all of her proceeds being donated to disaster relief charities in Puerto Rico, Mexico, the U.S. and the Caribbean after hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the Chiapas and Puebla earthquakes.

In April 2020, Beyoncé donated $6 million to the National Alliance in Mental Health, UCLA and local community-based organizations in order to provide mental health and personal wellness services to essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. BeyGOOD also teamed up with local organizations to help provide resources to communities of color, including food, water, cleaning supplies, medicines and face masks. The same month Beyoncé released a remix of Megan Thee Stallion&#x27;s &quot;Savage&quot;, with all proceeds benefiting Bread of Life Houston&#x27;s COVID-19 relief efforts, which includes providing over 14 tons of food and supplies to 500 families and 100 senior citizens in Houston weekly.

In May 2020, Beyoncé provided 1,000 free COVID-19 tests in Houston as part of her and her mother&#x27;s #IDidMyPart initiative, which was established due to the disproportionate deaths in African-American communities. Additionally, 1,000 gloves, masks, hot meals, essential vitamins, grocery vouchers and household items were provided. In July 2020, Beyoncé established the Black-Owned Small Business Impact Fund in partnership with the NAACP, which offers $10,000 grants to black-owned small businesses in need following the George Floyd protests. All proceeds from Beyoncé&#x27;s single &quot;Black Parade&quot; were donated to the fund. In September 2020, Beyoncé announced that she had donated an additional $1 million to the fund. As of December 31, 2020, the fund had given 715 grants to black-owned small businesses, amounting to $7.15 million donated.

In October 2020, Beyoncé released a statement that she has been working with the Feminist Coalition to assist supporters of the End SARS movement in Nigeria, including covering medical costs for injured protestors, covering legal fees for arrested protestors, and providing food, emergency shelter, transportation and telecommunication means to those in need. Beyoncé also showed support for those fighting against other issues in Africa, such as the Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon, ShutItAllDown in Namibia, Zimbabwean Lives Matter in Zimbabwe and the Rape National Emergency in Liberia. In December 2020, Beyoncé donated $500,000 to help alleviate the housing crisis in the U.S. caused by the cessation of the eviction moratorium, giving 100 $5,000 grants to individuals and families facing foreclosures and evictions.

<doc id="83703" wikidata="Q6536845" url="?curid=83703" title="Ancient Elis">
<text>Elis () or Eleia (, ; Elean: , ethnonym: ) is an ancient district in Greece that corresponds to the modern regional unit of Elis.

Elis is in southern Greece on the Peloponnese, bounded on the north by Achaea, east by Arcadia, south by Messenia, and west by the Ionian Sea. Over the course of the archaic and classical periods, the &quot;polis&quot; &quot;city-state&quot; of Elis controlled much of the region of Elis, most probably through unequal treaties with other cities; many inhabitants of Elis were Perioeci—autonomous free non-citizens. Perioeci, unlike other Spartans, could travel freely between cities. Thus the polis of Elis was formed.

The local form of the name was Valis, or Valeia, and its meaning, in all probability was, &quot;the lowland&quot; (compare with the word &quot;valley&quot;). In its physical constitution Elis is similar to Achaea and Arcadia; its mountains are mere offshoots of the Arcadian highlands, and its principal rivers are fed by Arcadian springs.

According to Strabo, the first settlement was created by Oxylus the Aetolian who invaded there and subjugated the residents. The city of Elis underwent synoecism—as Strabo notes—in 471 BC. Elis held authority over the site of Olympia and the Olympic games.

The spirit of the games had influenced the formation of the market: apart from the bouleuterion, the place the boule &quot;citizen&#x27;s council&quot; met, which was in one of the gymnasia, most of the other buildings were related to the games, including two gymnasia, a palaestra, and the House of the Hellanodikai.

==History==
===Early history===
The original inhabitants of Elis were called Caucones and Paroreatae. They are mentioned by Homer for the first time in Greek history under the title of Epeians (Epeii), as setting out for the Trojan War, and they are described by him as living in a state of constant hostility with their neighbours the Pylians. At the close of the 11th century BC the Dorians invaded the Peloponnese, and Elis fell to the share of Oxylus and the Aetolians.

These people, amalgamating with the Epeians, formed a powerful kingdom in the north of Elis. After this many changes took place in the political distribution of the country, till at length it came to acknowledge only three tribes, each independent of the others. These tribes were the Epeians, Minyae and Eleans. Before the end of the 8th century BC, however, the Eleans had vanquished both their rivals, and established their supremacy over the whole country. Among the other advantages which they thus gained was the right of celebrating the Olympic games, which had formerly been the prerogative of the Pisatans. Olympia was in Elian land, and tradition dates the first recorded games to 776 BC. The Hellanodikai, the judges of the Games, were of Elian origin. The attempts which the Pisatans made to recover their lost privilege, during a period of nearly two hundred years, ended at length in the total destruction of their city by the Eleans. From the time of this event in 572 BC until the Peloponnesian War, the peace of Elis remained undisturbed.

===Peloponnesian War and later===
In the war, Elis sided at first with Sparta. But Sparta, jealous of the increasing prosperity of its ally, availed itself of the first pretext to pick a quarrel. At the Battle of Mantinea (418 BC), the Eleans fought against the Spartans, who later took vengeance upon them by depriving them of Triphylia and the towns of the Acroreia.
The Eleans made no attempt to re-establish their authority over these places until Thebes rose in importance after the Battle of Leuctra (371 BC). However, the Arcadian confederacy came to the assistance of the Triphylians. In 366 BC, hostilities broke out between them, and though the Eleans were at first successful, they were soon overpowered; their capital very nearly fell into the hands of the enemy, and the territory of Triphylia was permanently ceded to Arcadia in 369 BC. Unable to make headway against their opponents, they applied for assistance to the Spartans, who invaded Arcadia and forced the Arcadians to recall their troops from Elis. The general result of this war was the restoration of their territory to the Eleans, who were also again invested with the right of holding the Olympic games.

During the Macedonian supremacy in Greece they sided with the victors, but refused to fight against their countrymen. After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC they renounced the Macedonian alliance. At a subsequent period they joined the Aetolian League. When the whole of Greece fell to Rome, the sanctity of Olympia secured for the Eleans a certain amount of indulgence. The games still continued to attract large numbers of visitors, until they were finally ended by Theodosius in 394 AD, two years before the utter destruction of the country by the Gothic invasion under Alaric I.

===Democracy in Elis===
Elis was a traditional ally of Sparta, but the city state joined Argos and Athens in an alliance against Sparta around 420 BC during the Peloponnesian War. This was due to Spartan support for the independence of Lepreum. As punishment following the surrender of Athens, Elis was forced to surrender Triphylia in 399 BC
Eric W. Robinson has argued that Elis was a democracy by around 500 BC, on the basis of early inscriptions which suggest that the people (the &quot;dāmos&quot;) could make and change laws. Robinson further believes that literary sources imply that Elis continued to be democratic until 365, when an oligarchic faction seems to have taken control (Xen. &quot;Hell.&quot; 7.4.16, 26). At some point in the mid-fourth century, democracy may have been restored; at least, we hear that a particularly narrow oligarchy was replaced by a new constitution designed by Phormio of Elis, a student of Plato (Arist. &quot;Pol.&quot; 1306a12-16; Plut. &quot;Mor.&quot; 805d, 1126c).

The classical democracy at Elis seems to have functioned mainly through a popular Assembly and a Council, the two main institutions of most &quot;poleis&quot;. The Council initially had 500 members, but grew to 600 members by the end of the fifth century (Thuc. 5.47.9). There was also a range of public officials such as the &quot;demiourgoi&quot; who regularly submitted to public audits.

==Geography==
===Districts===
As described by Strabo, Elis was divided into three districts:
* Koilē ( &quot;Hollow&quot;, Latinised &quot;Coele&quot;), or Lowland Elis
* Pīsâtis (Πισᾶτις &quot;[territory] of Pisa&quot;)
* Triphylia (Τριφυλία &quot;Triphūlía&quot; &quot;Country of the Three Tribes&quot;).

Koilē Elis, the largest and most northern of the three, was watered by the river Peneus and its tributary, the Ladon. The district was famous during antiquity for its cattle and horses. Pisatis extended south from Koilē Elis to the right bank of the river Alpheios, and was divided into eight departments named after as many towns. Triphylia stretched south from the Alpheios to the river Neda.

===City===
The city of Elis () was the capital of the city state of Elis. It was located at the exit of the river Peneios from the mountains into the plain in the area of today&#x27;s Ilida Municipality north of Kalyvia. It is said to have been founded in 471 BC by synoecism, however it is unclear what the ancient sources mean by this, the city already existed in the same place before and there were separate communities in the region of Elis before and after.

The first excavations in Elis were carried out from 1910 to 1914 by the Austrian Archaeological Institute under the direction of Otto Walter. From 1960 to 1981 the Archaeological Society of Athens carried out further excavations under the direction of Nikolaos Yalouris with Austrian participation. Some of the finds are exhibited in the local archaeological museum founded in 1981, for which a new building was built in 2003.

Nowadays Elis is a small village of 150 citizens located NE of Amaliada, built over the ruins of the ancient town. It has one of the most well-preserved ancient theaters in Greece. Built in the fourth century BC, the theater had a capacity of 8,000 people; below it, Early Helladic, sub-Mycenaean and Protogeometric graves have been found.

<doc id="83709" wikidata="Q527268" url="?curid=83709" title="Caguas, Puerto Rico">
<text>Caguas (, ) is a city and municipality in central eastern Puerto Rico. Located in the eponymous Caguas Valley between the Sierra de Cayey and Sierra de Luquillo of the Central Mountain Range, it is bordered by San Juan and Trujillo Alto to the north, Gurabo and San Lorenzo to the west, Aguas Buenas, Cidra and Cayey to the east, and Patillas to the south. With a population of 127,244 as of the 2020 census, Caguas is the fifth most populated municipality in the archipelago and island and a principal city of the San Juan metropolitan area.

Since 2009, Caguas is the only municipality in Puerto Rico recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation.

==Etymology and Nicknames==
Caguas, originally founded as San Sebastián del Piñal de Caguax, is named after the local Taino chieftain Caguax, who at the time of the Spanish arrival in 1493 was cacique of the yucayeque and region of Turabo. The name Caguax itself might be related to the Taino word for snail or slug: ‘cagua’, similar to other Arawakan and Cariban proper names such as Cagua in Venezuela (from the Cumanagoto word &quot;cahigua&quot;).

Caguas is nicknamed &quot;Valley of the Turabo&quot; (&quot;Valle del Turabo&quot;) in reference to the former cacicazgo and yucayeque lead by Caguax. The Turabo River is also named after this geopolitical toponym. Other nicknames for Caguas include “the Criollo city” (&quot;La Ciudad Criolla&quot;) and “the Cradle of &quot;Trovadores&quot;” (&quot;La Cuna de los Trovadores&quot;). The city is often known as the “center and heart of Puerto Rico” (c&quot;entro y corazón de Puerto Rico&quot;) for its geographical location, and one of its municipal anthems bears the same. In recent years the municipality has also been referred to as “the new Caguas country” or “the new land of Caguas” (&quot;el nuevo país de Caguas&quot;) by the media and the former mayor William Miranda Marín.

==History==
The area of the Valley of Caguas was first settled by the Saladoid culture, an Arawak culture which originated in northern South America (today Venezuela), approximately between the years 100 BCE to 600 CE. Findings from the Cagüitas archaeological site (CS-2) indicate that the area was later inhabited by various pre-Taíno (Ostionoid) cultures which first developed agriculture in the valley, primarily the cultivation of cassava, and hunted now extinct species such as hutias.

As with the rest of Puerto Rico, the Taínos were the primary group living in the valley at the time of the Spanish arrival. The Spanish conquistadors further developed the agriculture in the valley, while also establishing mines in search of gold, silver and copper. Most of the native Taínos living in the area were either forced out or taken as slaves and moved to the Real Hacienda del Toa (in modern-day Toa Alta and Toa Baja). Most of the valley was later cleared of its original vegetation for the development of cattle farms such as &quot;Hato de Bairoa&quot;, &quot;Hato de Caguax&quot; and &quot;Hato de Gurabo&quot;.

Caguas was officially founded on January 1, 1775, as San Sebastián del Piñal de Caguax, with the name later being shortened and modernized to its current form. The site of the historic downtown area of Caguas and its central square dates to 1779. In 1820, the settlement was granted the title of &quot;Villa&quot; and it was granted city rights in 1894. Sugarcane was the primary crop during this time and important sugarcane plantations and refineries were those of Central Santa Juana (close to modern day Plaza Centro) and Central Santa Catalina (modern day Las Catalinas Mall). The Carretera Central, which is the first paved road to cross Puerto Rico from north to south connecting San Juan to Ponce, was built during the last two decades of the 19th century, made Caguas more accessible therefore causing the population of the town to grow even more.Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Caguas was 19,857.

The city grew considerably in size during the 1970s and quickly became an exurb of San Juan to the north due to its location. The region of Caguas became an important pharmaceuticals manufacturing center during this time. Pharmaceutical companies originally came to Puerto Rico in the late 1960s and 1970s to take advantage of the now-expired federal tax incentive known as &quot;Section 936&quot;. This incentive allowed U.S.-based manufacturers to send all profits from local plants to stateside parent plants without having to pay any federal taxes.

Although not typically seen as part of the colloquial &quot;Área Metro&quot; of San Juan (San Juan, Cataño, Bayamón, Guaynabo and Carolina), the municipality of Caguas is located in the census-based San Juan Metropolitan Area due to its role as a commuter town. The average commute time for residents of the municipality is 30.5 minutes. Caguas is the fourth most populous city in the San Juan Metropolitan region and the most populous city in Puerto Rico that is not located in a coastal area.

On August 7, 2002, Caguas was the site of the 2002 USAF Hercules air disaster, where all 10 military personnel on board lost their lives after an airplane carrying them struck a mountain in the south of the municipality.

Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Caguas with its wind and rain. Rivers were breached causing flooding of low-lying areas, and infrastructure and homes were destroyed. The hurricane caused $90 million in damages in Caguas. More specifically, 40 homes were left without a roof and 30 were flooded in the Morales neighborhood. &quot;Escuela Segunda Unidad Diego Vázquez&quot; and the &quot;Centro Multiusos&quot; flooded as well.

==Geography==

The city and municipality of Caguas are located approximately 30 minutes from the coastline both on the east (Humacao) and the north (San Juan). It is east of Aguas Buenas and Cidra, north of Cayey, south of San Juan, and west of Gurabo and Trujillo Alto. It also shares borders with Guayama and Patillas via a five-point border at the summit of Cerro La Santa, with Cayey and San Lorenzo. This is the tallest point of the Sierra de Cayey, not to be confused with Montaña Santa (officially called Cerro de Nuestra Madre) which is another mountain in the same massif located on the boundary between the municipalities of Patillas and San Lorenzo. At this point there are two tall antennas which provide signal to Puerto Rico&#x27;s principal TV stations such as WKAQ-TV and WAPA-TV. No road passes exactly at this point, and it can be approached nearby through Puerto Rico Highway 184.

=== Valle de Caguas ===
The city is located in one of the largest valleys in Puerto Rico, the &quot;Valle de Caguas&quot; or Caguas Valley (also known as &quot;Valle del Turabo&quot; or the Turabo Valley). Being located in a valley, Caguas has the distinction of being relatively flat except near the borders with all the mentioned municipalities except Gurabo. The valley is bordered by the Altos de La Mesa and San Luis ranges in the north, the Sierra de Luquillo on the northeast, the San Lorenzo batholith to the east, the Sierra de Cayey on the south and the main range of the Cordillera Central to the west.

This valley is fed mainly by the Grande de Loíza River, one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s major rivers that feed into the Atlantic Ocean, and numerous tributaries such as the Cagüitas, along which the contemporary settlement of Caguas was built. The city&#x27;s nickname &quot;Valle del Turabo&quot; comes from the Turabo River, which is another tributary that flows from the south. The Gurabo River, another major tributary, feeds into the Grande de Loíza at a region where the valley narrows into a rift valley that runs from west to east and ends in Humacao in the southeastern coast of the island.

As with other parts of Puerto Rico, the region of Caguas is susceptible to earthquakes. The municipality is located along the Great Northern Puerto Rico fault zone (GNPRfz) and in recent times the region experienced moderate size earthquakes in 1990 and 2010.

===Water features===
*The Río Grande de Loíza divides the municipality from Gurabo.
*Other rivers: Río Turabo, Río Cagüitas, Río Cañaboncito, Río Bairoa and Río Cañas.

===Climate===

The climate is classified as a tropical monsoon climate, meaning the daily mean temperature from month to month is never less than , and there is a distinct wet and dry season. Rainfall is common in relative abundance throughout most of the year, although there is less rain than in the eastern coastal valleys. The land, however, is fertile and deep.

===Barrios===

Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Caguas is subdivided into barrios:

# Caguas barrio-pueblo
# Bairoa
# Beatriz
# Borinquen
# Cañabón
# Cañaboncito
# Río Cañas
# San Antonio
# San Salvador
# Tomás de Castro
# Turabo
===Sectors===
Barrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions) and subbarrios, are further subdivided into smaller areas called (&quot;sectors&quot; in English). The types of &quot;sectores&quot; may vary, from normally &quot;sector&quot; to &quot;urbanización&quot; to &quot;reparto&quot; to &quot;barriada&quot; to &quot;residencial&quot;, among others.

===Special Communities===

 (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion. A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Caguas: Bairoa La 25, Morales neighborhood, Parcelas Viejas in Borinquén, Sector La Barra, and Comunidad La Quebrada in Río Cañas, Hoyo Frío in Las Carolinas, Lajitas, Las Carolinas, Los Muchos, Los Panes in Beatriz, and Savarona.

The Criollos de Caguas baseball team is considered one of the greatest of all time in all of Latin America, having won 18 national Puerto Rico titles and 5 Caribbean World Series titles The team is a member of the &quot;Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico&quot; (LBPPR). Three of the first five Puerto Ricans that played Major League Baseball in the U.S. mainland, at one point in their careers played for the Criollos de Caguas (Luis Rodríguez Olmo, Victor Pellot Power, Roberto Clemente).

The Criollos de Caguas basketball team, founded in 1968 by Dr. Héctor &quot;Tato&quot; Dávila and Lcdo. Libertario Pérez Rodríguez (a lawyer), is a basketball team that did not enjoy as much success as their baseball counterparts. However, in the early 2000s, they showed a lot of progress by reaching the national playoffs various times. The team was a member of the BSN. In 2006, the team won its first BSN national basketball championship, defeating Flor Melendez and his Santurce Crabbers in five games.

==Economy==
In September 2005, city mayor William Miranda Marín levied the first municipal tax in Puerto Rico via city ordinance. Area merchants now charge a one cent tax for every dollar spent at all retail businesses. The tax has become known around the island as the &quot;Willie Tax.&quot; It resulted in an estimated $500,000 monthly income for the city. However, the municipal tax was increased to 1.5% after the establishment of the 5.5% state tax, for a total of 7%, and the tax was declared illegal by the Puerto Rico&#x27;s Supreme Court.

In 2006, Miranda Marín began calling Caguas &quot;El Nuevo País de Caguas&quot; (&quot;The New Country of Caguas&quot;).

===Agriculture===
During the early part of the 20th century, Caguas hosted one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s most important sugar manufacturers, which gave employment to thousands of Cagüeños.

In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Caguas was 19,857.

In 2020, Caguas had a population of 127,244 compared to 142,893 in 2010. This shows an 11% decrease in the population in the municipality. The population density in 2020 was . Hispanic or Latino of any race constitute 98.4% of the population of the municipality. There are also communities of Dominicans, Cubans and Colombians.

==Symbols==
The or municipality has an official flag and coat of arms.

===Flag and coat of arms===
The colors blue and gold were chosen for the shield, distinctive of the city of Caguas. The figures symbolize both the indigenous and Christian origins of the city.

The coat of arms consists of a shield with a blue field. Upon the field are two sets of three golden arrows, forming a cross of St. Andrew. Above the cross is a crown which represents Caguax, cacique of the Turabo Valley region at the time of the arrival of the Spanish conquerors. Arrows were used as a remembrance of the first Christian place of worship established in the region which was dedicated under the patronage of St. Sebastian. There are pineapples interspersed to reflect the native agriculture. A castellated wall surmounts the shield to show the city&#x27;s having been granted status as a municipality by the Spanish Crown.

On the flag, the shield sits atop another blue field on which the cross of arrows motif is repeated.

==Transportation==

Public transportation in Caguas, as in most of Puerto Rico, is limited to small &quot;guaguas públicas&quot; (Mini Bus). There is inexpensive but slow service to and from San Juan and Rio Piedras. Several buses and public taxi services serve the town to a limited degree. In 2019, 91.55% of the population relied on their own cars or carpool services to commute.

A &quot;light interurban rail&quot; system connecting Caguas to San Juan was in the planning stages and discarded due to lack of funding.

Caguas is served by one freeway, one tolled expressway and one main divided highway. Puerto Rico Highway 30 connects Caguas to the eastern part of the island. There is no freeway/expressway to the west, due mainly to the fact that there is no sufficient population west of Caguas to develop a new freeway or expressway; good access to the municipalities of Cidra (southwest) and Aguas Buenas (northwest) are possible via PR-172 and PR-156, respectively. Puerto Rico Highway 52 connects Caguas to the north (San Juan) and south (Cayey, Ponce). Puerto Rico Highway 1 is an alternate route to San Juan and Guaynabo with two lanes per direction; in south Caguas it becomes rural near Borinquen, therefore the only good access to Cayey is the expressway (PR-52) and a $1.00 toll has to be paid (only in the south direction). The only municipality bordering Caguas with a poor-access road is San Lorenzo, via PR-183; but good access to San Lorenzo is possible by entering Gurabo via PR-30, and then taking PR-203 south. Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport is about 35 minutes away by car.

There are 86 bridges in Caguas.

<text>Achaea () or Achaia (), sometimes transliterated from Greek as Akhaia (, &quot;Akhaḯa&quot; ), is one of the regional units of Greece. It is part of the region of Western Greece and is situated in the northwestern part of the Peloponnese peninsula. The capital is Patras which is the third largest city in Greece.

==Geography==

Achaea is bordered by Elis to the west and southwest, Arcadia to the south, and Corinthia to the east and southeast. The Gulf of Corinth lies to its northeast, and the Gulf of Patras to its northwest. The mountain Panachaiko (1926 m), though not the highest of Achaea, dominates the coastal area near Patras. Higher mountains are found in the south, such as Aroania (2341 m) and Erymanthos (2224 m). Other mountain ranges in Achaea are Skollis, Omplos, Kombovouni and Movri. Its main rivers ordered from west to east are the Larissos, Tytheus, Peiros, Charadros, Selinountas and Vouraikos. Most of the forests are in the mountain ranges, though several are in the plains including the extreme west. There are grasslands around the mid-elevation areas and barren lands in the highest areas.

==Climate==
Achaea has hot summers and mild winters. Sunny days dominate during the summer months in areas near the coast, while the summer can be cloudy and rainy in the mountains. Snow is very common during the winter in the mountains of Erymanthos, Panachaiko and Aroania. Winter high temperatures are around the 10 °C mark throughout the low-lying areas.

==Administration==

The regional unit Achaea is subdivided into 5 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):
*Aigialeia (2)
*Erymanthos (4)
*Kalavryta (5)
*Patras (&quot;Patra&quot;, 1)
*West Achaea (&quot;Dytiki Achaia&quot;, 3)

===Prefecture===
As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Achaea was created out of the former prefecture Achaea (). The prefecture had the same territory as the present regional unit. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below.

===Provinces===
*Province of Aigialeia - Aigio
*Province of Kalavryta - Kalavryta
*Province of Patras - Patras
&quot;Note:&quot; Provinces no longer hold any legal status in Greece.

==History==

===Classical Antiquity===

The Achaean League was a Hellenistic-era confederation of city states in Achaea, founded in 280/281 BC. It later grew until it included most of Peloponnese, much reducing the Macedonian rule in the area.

After Macedon&#x27;s defeat by the Romans in the early 2nd century BC, the League was able finally to defeat a heavily weakened Sparta and take control of the entire Peloponnese. However, as the Roman influence in the area grew, the league erupted into an open revolt against Roman domination, in what is known as Achaean War. The Achaeans were defeated at the Battle of Corinth (146 BC), and the League was dissolved by the Romans.

In AD 51/52, Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus was proconsul of Achaea, and is portrayed (under the name &quot;Gallio&quot;) in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, in the Bible, as presiding over the trial of the Apostle Paul in Corinth ().

===Medieval history===
Achaea remained a province of the Byzantine Empire after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. In the 6th and 7th centuries, Slavs invaded Greece and reached the Peloponnese, settling there. The coastal cities remained largely under Byzantine control, and a Siege of Patras in 805/807 failed. By the end of the 9th century, the whole peninsula was firmly under Byzantine control again, forming the Theme of the Peloponnese. 

After the Fourth Crusade several new Crusader states were founded in Greece. One of these was the Principality of Achaea, founded in 1205, which like the Roman province covered a much larger area than the Achaea region. The Achaea region was among the core territories of the Principality, with four baronies: the extensive Barony of Patras, the Barony of Vostitsa, the Barony of Chalandritsa, and the Barony of Kalavryta. Patras, under the powerful Latin Archbishopric of Patras, over time became a semi-autonomous domain under the protection of Venice and the Holy See. Although Kalavryta was lost to the Byzantine Greeks already by the end of the 13th century, the other baronies survived until the Principality of Achaea was conquered by the Byzantine Empire in 1430, and became part of the Despotate of the Morea.

The Despotate of the Morea fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1460. As a part of the Morean War, the Republic of Venice captured Achaea in 1687 and held it until 1715, when the Ottomans recaptured the Peloponnese. Under Ottoman rule, Achaea was part of the Morea Eyalet.

===Modern history===
In the Greek War of Independence, Aigio was one of the first cities to be liberated by the Greeks and all of Achaea was liberated by the end of 1821. Achaea produced several heroes including Kanaris, Zaimis and Roufos and prime ministers of Greece including Andreas Michalakopoulos as well as some head of states.

In the first administrative subdivision of independent Greece, Achaea was part of the Achaea and Elis Prefecture. This was divided into the prefectures of Achaea and Elis in 1899. Achaea and Elis were reunited in 1909, and split again in 1930.

Achaea saw an influx of refugees that arrived from Asia Minor during the Greco Turkish War of 1919-1922. Tens of thousands were relocated to their camps in the suburbs of Patras and a few villages mainly within the coastline. One of the camps was named Prosfygika.

==Population==
Achaea today has about one-third of the population of the Peloponnese. Patras, the capital of Achaea, is the third largest city in Greece, behind Athens and Thessaloniki. Two-thirds of the Achaean population live near Patras, and more than half within the city limits. The main industrial areas are around Patras.

===Main towns and cities===

The main cities and towns of Achaea are (ranked by 2021 census population of the town proper):
*Patras 169,886
*Aigio 19,857
*Kato Achaia 7,689

==Culture==
The monastery Agia Lavra is situated a few kilometres west of Kalavryta on the top of a hill. 12 to 20 km east, is Cave Lakes, with lakes inside. The length is around 300 to 500 m.

The mountain hosts the most modern Greek telescope, named Aristarchus (after the ancient Greek astronomer - Aristarchus of Samos) and operated by the National Observatory of Athens. A narrow gauge railway track runs for 30 km, mainly as a tourist attraction. The track begins near Kalavryta and ends off Diakopto.

==Economy==
Patras is one of the main industrial and commerce centers in Greece. Temeni is a place where the spring water Avra (Άυρα) is manufactured. It is owned by Tria Epsilon, a division of The Coca-Cola Company and a parent. There is a small oil refinery near Rio. Athenian brewery has the largest production facility of the company in Patra.

<text>Chariclo ( or ; ) is either of two nymphs in Greek mythology:
* Chariclo, a nymph who was married to the centaur Chiron and became the mother of Hippe, Endeïs, Ocyrhoe, and Carystus. According to a scholium on Pindar, she was the daughter of either Apollo, Perses or Oceanus. Chariclo together with her mother-in-law Philyra the Oceanid, were the nurses of the young Achilles.
* Chariclo, a nymph devotee of Athena, who became pregnant by a shepherd, Everes, giving birth to the prophet Tiresias. Tiresias was struck blind by Athena after seeing her naked. Chariclo begged Athena to give Tiresias his sight back, but the goddess could not undo her curse. She gave him the gift of prophecy instead.

<text>Ocyrhoe (; Ancient Greek: Ὠκυρόη) or Ocyrrhoe (Ὠκυρρόη) refers to at least five characters in Greek mythology.

* Ocyrrhoe, one of the 3,000 Oceanids, water-nymph daughters of the Titans Oceanus and his sister-spouse Tethys. She was the mother of Phasis by Helios. Ocyrhoe may refer to &#x27;speed and mobility&#x27;.
*Ocyrhoe, daughter of Chiron and Chariclo. She was transformed into a horse because she told her father Chiron his exact fate. Ocyrhoe revealed that he would forsake his immortality to be spared the agonizing pain of a serpent&#x27;s poison. For this transgression, Ocyrhoe&#x27;s ability to speak was taken. One might assume that she turned into a horse because her father was a centaur, and because she had long, auburn hair.
* Ocyrrhoe or Ocyone, a naiad-nymph. She was the mother, by Hippasus, of Hippomedon (a defender of Troy), to whom she gave birth on the banks of River Sangarius. Her son was killed by Neoptolemus.
* Ocyrrhoe or Ocroe, the nymph daughter of the river god Imbrasus and Chesias, a noble maiden. While in Miletus at a festival in honor of Artemis, she caught Apollo&#x27;s attention and, fleeing from his advances, asked Pompilus, a seafarer and an old friend of her father, to take her home. Pompilus took her on board the ship, but Apollo caught up with them, took the girl and then changed the ship into stone and Pompilus into a fish.
* Ocyrrhoe, a nymph of Mysia, mother of Caicus by Hermes.

<doc id="83727" wikidata="Q1120723" url="?curid=83727" title="Pheme">
<text>In Greek mythology, Pheme ( ; Greek: , &quot;Phēmē&quot;; Roman equivalent: Fama), also known as Ossa in Homeric sources, was the personification of fame and renown, her favour being notability, her wrath being scandalous rumours. She was a daughter either of Gaia or of Elpis (Hope), was described as &quot;she who initiates and furthers communication&quot; and had an altar at Athens. A tremendous gossip, Pheme was said to have pried into the affairs of mortals and gods, then repeated what she learned, starting off at first with just a dull whisper, but repeating it louder each time, until everyone knew. In art, she was usually depicted with wings and a trumpet.

In Roman mythology, Fama (&quot;rumour&quot;) was described as having multiple tongues, eyes, ears, and feathers by Virgil (in &quot;Aeneid&quot; IV line 180 and following) and other authors. Virgil wrote that she &quot;had her feet on the ground, and her head in the clouds, making the small seem great and the great seem greater&quot;. 
In Homer Pheme is called the Rumour goddess or the messenger of Zeus. In Book One of the Odyssey, the purpose of Telemachus&#x27; journey to Pylos is so that he might gain &quot;pheme&quot; among the world. 

In English Renaissance theatre, Rumour was a stock personification, best known from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; in the quote &quot;Open your ears; for which of you will stop The vent of hearing, when loud Rumour speaks?&quot;. James C. Bulman&#x27;s Arden Shakespeare edition notes numerous lesser known theatrical examples.

==Linguistic associations==
The Greek word &quot;pheme&quot; is related to Φάναι &quot;to speak&quot; and can mean &quot;fame&quot;, &quot;report&quot;, or &quot;rumor&quot;. The Latin word &quot;fama&quot;, with the same range of meanings, is related to the Latin &quot;fari&quot; (&quot;to speak&quot;), and is, through French, the etymon of the English &quot;fame&quot;.

<doc id="83728" wikidata="Q2993240" url="?curid=83728" title="Phemonoe">
<text>In Greek mythology, Phemonoe ( ; ) was a Greek poet of the ante-Homeric period. She was said to have been the daughter of Apollo, his first priestess at Delphi, or of his possible son Delphus, and the inventor of the hexameter verses, a type of poetic metre.

== Mythology ==
In some studies, the phrase &quot;know thyself&quot; (γνῶθι σεαυτόν), found inscribed at the entrance to the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, has been attributed to her. Some writers seem to have placed her at Delos instead of Delphi; and Servius identifies her with the Cumaean Sibyl. The tradition which ascribed to her the invention of the hexameter, was by no means uniform; Pausanias, for example, as quoted above, calls her the first who used it, but in another passage he quotes an hexameter distich, which was ascribed to the Peleiades, who lived before Phemonoe: the traditions respecting the invention of the hexameter are collected by Fabricius. There were poems which went under the name of Phemonoe, like the old religious poems which were ascribed to Orpheus, Musaeus, and the other mythological bards. Melampus, for example, quotes from her in his book &quot;Peri Palmon Mantike&quot; (&quot;On Twitches&quot;) §17, §18; and Pliny quotes from her respecting eagles and hawks, evidently from some book of augury, and perhaps from a work which is still extant in MS., entitled &quot;Orneosophium&quot;. There is an epigram of Antipater of Thessalonica, alluding to a statue of Phemonoe, dressed in a pharos.

<doc id="83730" wikidata="Q1052301" url="?curid=83730" title="Geras">
<text>In Greek mythology, Geras (), also written Gēras, was the god of old age. He was depicted as a tiny, shriveled old man. Gēras&#x27;s opposite was Hebe, the goddess of youth. In Latin, he is referred to as Senectus. He is known primarily from vase depictions that show him with the hero Heracles; the mythic story that inspired these depictions has been lost.

== Mythology ==
According to Hesiod, Geras is one of the many sons and daughters that the night goddess Nyx produced parthenogenetically. However, both Hyginus and Cicero add Erebus, Nyx&#x27;s consort, as his father.

In the myth of Tithonus, the mortal prince received immortality, but not agelessness, from the gods so when old age came to him he kept aging and shrinking but never dying. In the end his divine lover Eos turned Tithonus into a cicada. In several ancient Greek vases Geras is depicted fighting Heracles, although no relevant written myth survives. Geras is presented as an old, wrinkled bald man begging for mercy.

Philostratus claimed that the people of Gadeira set up altars to Geras and Thanatos.

== Function ==
Geras as embodied in humans represented a virtue: the more &quot;gēras&quot; a man acquired, the more &quot;kleos&quot; (fame) and &quot;arete&quot; (excellence and courage) he was considered to have. In ancient Greek literature, the related word &quot;géras&quot; (γέρας) can also carry the meaning of influence, authority or power; especially that derived from fame, good looks and strength claimed through success in battle or contest. Such uses of this meaning can be found in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, throughout which there is an evident concern from the various kings about the &quot;géras&quot; they will pass to their sons through their names. The concern is significant because kings at this time (such as Odysseus) are believed to have ruled by common assent in recognition of their powerful influence, rather than hereditarily. The Greek word γῆρας (&quot;gĕras&quot;) means &quot;old age&quot; or in some other literature &quot;dead skin&quot; or &quot;slough of a snake&quot;; this word is the root of English words such as &quot;geriatric&quot; and &quot;progeria&quot;.

Geras could refer to the treasure that was awarded during battles in Ancient Greece. After a battle, the victorious power would collect the captured gold, treasure, and other valuable artefacts. It would then be divided between the victors according to their timê or honour; the greater the honour, the greater the level of Geras that would be gained.

In Homer&#x27;s Iliad, Agamemnon and Achilles fall out over a dispute of the return Chryses&#x27; daughter and taking Briseis in exchange (Book 1); Achilles sees Agamemnon taking his Gera as an affront to his pride and honour. Similarly, in many Hellenic cultures, it is customary to take the armour of a defeated enemy, a form of Gera, such as in Book 16 with Hector and Patroclus fighting over the body of Cebriones, son of Priam - King of Troy.

<doc id="83734" wikidata="Q488558" url="?curid=83734" title="Anaxagoras (mythology)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Anaxagoras () was a king of Argos. He was the son and successor of either King Megapenthes or by the latter&#x27;s son, King Argeus.

== Family ==
With Megapenthes being his father, Anaxagoras was considered the brother of Iphianeira, wife of Melampus. Anaxagoras fathered Alector, the father of Iphis. In a rare account, he was recounted as the father of Hipponous, the father of Capaneus, one of the Seven Against Thebes.

== Mythology ==
The prince, Anaxagoras&#x27; son, suffered from a strange malady and the king offered a reward for anybody that could heal him. Melampus, a local seer, killed an ox and talked to the vultures that came to eat the corpse. The vultures said the last time they had such a feast was when the king made a sacrifice. They told Melampus that the prince had been frightened of the big, bloody knife and the king tossed it aside to calm the child. It had hit a tree and injured a hamadryad, who cursed the prince with the sickness. The hamadryad told Melampus that the boy would be healed if the knife was taken out of the trunk of the tree and boiled, then the rusty water that resulted drunk by the prince. Melampus followed her directions and demanded two thirds of the kingdom for himself, and one third for his brother, Bias. The king ultimately agreed. When the women of Argos were driven mad by Dionysus, in the reign of Anaxagoras, Melampus was brought in to cure them, but demanded a third of the kingdom as payment. The king refused, but the women became wilder than ever, and he was forced to seek out Melampus again, who this time demanded both a third for himself and another third for his brother Bias. Sometimes, this story is told not of Anaxagoras, but of his grandfather, Proetus. Anaxagoras was succeeded by his son Alector. His house lasted longer than those of Bias and Melampus, and eventually the kingdom was reunited under its last member, Cylarabes.

<doc id="83735" wikidata="Q325112" url="?curid=83735" title="Michael Asher (artist)">
<text>Michael Max Asher (July 15, 1943 – October 15, 2012) was an American conceptual artist, described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;among the patron saints of the Conceptual Art phylum known as Institutional Critique, an often esoteric dissection of the assumptions that govern how we perceive art.&quot; Rather than designing new art objects, Asher typically altered the existing environment, by repositioning or removing artworks, walls, facades, etc.

Asher was also a highly regarded professor of art, who spent decades on the faculty at California Institute of the Arts. Cited by numerous successful artists as an important influence in their development, Asher&#x27;s teaching has been described by British journalist Sarah Thornton as his &quot;most influential&quot; work.

==Early life and education==
Born in Los Angeles, California, Asher is the son of gallerist Betty Asher and Leonard Asher. While in high school, one of his classmates was future colleague, Thom Andersen. He studied at the University of California, Irvine, where he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in fine arts in 1966.

==Life and career==
He began teaching at the California Institute of the Arts in 1973, along with other influential artist-professors like John Baldessari, Judy Chicago and Allan Kaprow. His &quot;post-studio art&quot; course consisted of intensive group critiques that can focus on a single work for eight hours or more. His &quot;Writings, 1973–1983, on Works 1969-1979,&quot; co-authored by the art historian Benjamin H. D. Buchloh, was published by The Press of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design.

Chapter 2 of &quot;Seven Days in the Art World&quot; by Sarah Thornton is set in Asher&#x27;s Post-Studio Crit class. Thornton describes the Crit as a &quot;rite of passage&quot; for the students and as the artist&#x27;s &quot;most influential&quot; work - &quot;an institutional critique that reveals the limits of the rest of the curriculum.&quot; 

On medical leave from CalArts since 2008, Asher died Sunday, October 14, 2012 after a long illness. He was 69.

==Works==
Asher&#x27;s work takes the form of &quot;subtle yet deliberate interventions – additions, subtractions or alterations – in particular environments.&quot; His pieces were always site-specific; they were always temporary, and whatever was made or moved for them was destroyed or put back after the exhibitions.

Much of Asher&#x27;s work, especially in the 1970s, focused upon the specific idiosyncrasies of the gallery as an artistic space. Asher conceived spatial and curatorial choices of the gallery as their own minimalist works, conceptually focused around the viewer&#x27;s perception.

His work in the late 1960s and early 1970s consisted of dividing up gallery spaces using partition walls and curtains, and designing environments that reflected or absorbed sound. For his first solo exhibition at the La Jolla Museum of Art, Asher installed a tone generator in one of the gallery walls that effectively cancelled out all sound waves in the room, creating a dead zone in the center of the gallery. In 1969, for the group show “Anti-Illusion: Procedures/Materials” at the Whitney Museum of American Art, he concealed a blower above a door to create a slab of air that visitors passed through when they moved from one gallery to the next. In the 1970s he began to remove elements from spaces, for example sandblasting away layers of paint (at Galleria Toselli, Milan, in 1973) or removing the partition walls separating an exhibition space from the gallery office. More dramatically, in his piece &quot;Installation&quot; (1970) at Pomona College, he created a work by reconfiguring the interior space of a gallery and then leaving the gallery open, without a door, 24 hours a day, introducing light and the noise of the street into the gallery as experiential elements. For another early work at the Claire Copley Gallery in Los Angeles, in 1974, he removed a crucial wall that protected the office space from view, framing the art gallery&#x27;s behind-the-scenes business operations as something worth viewing itself. Further exploration into the workings of the gallery as institution took place in 1977, where he held an exhibition in both the Claire Copley and Morgan Thomas galleries. The exhibition took on the function of transposer, placing both gallery owners in the space of the other, displaying their own unique curatorial choices. In 1979 he started to reposition objects in museum collections. Sometimes Asher gathers facts, like the list he published of all the artworks ever deaccessioned by the Museum of Modern Art. For a show at the Santa Monica Museum of Art in 2008, he decided to re-create all the 44 stud walls that have been built for every exhibition since the museum relocated to Bergamot Station in May 1998. Architectural floor plans for those 44 exhibitions, captioned with the title and dates of each one, are displayed in a small gallery at the show&#x27;s entrance, providing a key to what visitors are about to see.

His untitled 1991 work featuring a functional, polished, granite drinking fountain juxtaposed with a flag pole was his first permanent public outdoor work in the United States. Part of the Stuart Collection of public art on the campus of the University of California, San Diego, this drinking fountain is an exact replica of commercial metal fountains typically found in business offices and government buildings. Instead of its usual context as interior office furniture, the fountain is placed monument like on a grass island in the center of the campus. It marks the site as the former Camp Matthews, a military training facility from 1917 to 1964. The piece was destroyed by a sledgehammer-wielding vandal on January 13, 2015.

==Exhibitions and awards==
Asher exhibited at documenta (1972, 1982), the MoMA (1979), and the Venice Biennale (1976), and his solo museum shows include the Centre Pompidou (1991), Los Angeles County Museum of Art (2003), Art Institute of Chicago (2005) and Santa Monica Museum of Art (2008).

Asher won the Bucksbaum Award 2010. The jury consisted of: Adam D. Weinberg, the Whitney’s Alice Pratt Brown Director; Donna De Salvo, Whitney Associate Director of Programs and Chief Curator; the 2010 curators Francesco Bonami and Gary Carrion-Murayari; and three guest panelists, Hou Hanru (San Francisco Art Institute), Yasmil Raymond (Dia Art Foundation), and James Rondeau (Art Institute of Chicago). The winner received $100,000 and a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art. His project for the 2010 Whitney Biennial involved having the museum remain open 24 hours a day for one week (although this was shortened to three days by the museum due to “budgetary and human resources limitations”).

In the mid-1970s, after a dispute with gallery dealer, Heiner Friedrich, Asher decided to use contractual agreements in order to control the production, dissemination and ownership of his art projects. Using Seth Siegelaub and Robert Projanksy&#x27;s contract, The Artists Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement, as a model, Asher crafted his own contract with the help of Los Angeles attorney, Arthur Alef.

<text>In Greek mythology, Bias (; ; ) may refer to the following characters:
* Bias, a Megarian prince as a son of King Lelex and brother to Cleson and Pterelaus. He was killed by his nephew Pylas, also a Megarian king. After the murder, Pylas gave the kingdom to the deposed king of Athens, Pandion and later founded the city of Pylos in Peloponnesus.
* Bias, son of Amythaon and brother of Melampus.
* Bias, son of Melampus and Iphianira thus a nephew of the earlier Bias. But his name has been proposed to read &quot;Abas&quot;, another son of Melampus.
* Bias, one of the Epigoni and son of Parthenopaeus, one of the Seven Against Thebes.
* Bias, a Trojan prince as one of the sons of King Priam of Troy by other women. He was the father of two Trojan warriors, Laogonus and Dardanus. In another account, Bias and his brothers, Dryops and Chorithan, were instead slain by Idomeneus.
* Bias, an Athenian soldier who supported Menestheus against the attacks of Hector.
* Bias, a Pylian soldier who fought under their leader Nestor during the Trojan War.
* Bias, one of the Suitors of Penelope who came from Dulichium along with other 56 wooers. He, with the other suitors, was slain by Odysseus with the aid of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus.

<text>In Greek mythology, Pero (; ) was a princess of Pylos.

== Family ==
Pero was the daughter of King Neleus and Chloris, daughter of the Minyan king Amphion of Orchomenus. She was the wife of her cousin Bias, and by him, bore her sons including Areius, Leodocus, and Talaus. In some accounts, her sons were called Aretus and Perialces. Pero had a daughter named Alphesiboea who married King Pelias of Iolcus. 

== Mythology ==
The story of Pero is mentioned in Book XI of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Pero&#x27;s beauty attracted many suitors, but Neleus, her father, refused to give his daughter to any man unless he could raid the cattle of Iphicles from Phylace. In this version of the story, an unnamed seer volunteers to undertake the task. The cowherds capture him and keep him for a year, until he makes a prophecy.

Later in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the story is told by the seer Theoklymenos about his ancestor Melampous. Melampous was a wealthy man from Pylos, but he left Pylos fleeing Neleus who held his possessions by force for a year. During that year, Melampous was held prisoner in the house of Phylakos because of the daughter of Neleus, Pero, and an &quot;atë&quot; sent by the Erinyes. Melampous escaped death and drove the cattle back to Pylos. He took Pero home as a wife for his brother.

According to Pherecydes, Melampous overhears two woodworms saying that a beam in the ceiling of his prison is about to collapse. He asks the guards to carry him out, and as they step outside, the ceiling collapses, killing another female guard who treated Melampous badly. One of the surviving guards informs Phylakos and Phylakos tells Iphiklos. The two agree to give Melampous the sought after cattle if Melampous can cure Iphiklos&#x27; inability to beget children. Melampous makes the appropriate sacrifices to Zeus and asks the birds to whom he distributes portions of the sacrifice for help. The birds bring Melampous a vulture who tells him that Phylakos chased Iphiklos with a knife, presumably because Iphiklos had seen Phylakos do something mischievous. Phylakos, upon failing to catch Iphiklos, planted the knife in a wild pear tree and the bark grew over it. Melampous retrieved the knife and mixed the rust from the knife with wine. Iphiklos drank the wine for 10 days. Eventually a child, Podarkes, is born and the cattle are given to Melampous, who takes the cattle to Neleus as the bride price for Pero. He gives Pero to Bias to wed.

Apollodoros tells the same story but with some additions. According to Apollodoros, Amythaon is married to his brother Pheres&#x27; daughter, Eidomene. Melampous and Bias are their sons. Melampous gains the ability to understand the speech of animals after he saves the young of some snakes a servant killed, and the snake licks his ear. In Pero&#x27;s story, the cattle belong to the father Phylakos and not Iphiklos. The incident that disallows Iphiklos from having children resulted from Iphiklos seeing Phylakos gelding rams, causing Phylakos to chase him with a knife.

<text>Félix Juan Trinidad García (born January 10, 1973), popularly known as &quot;Tito&quot; Trinidad, is a Puerto Rican former professional boxer who competed from 1990 to 2008. He held multiple world championships in three weight classes and is considered to be one of the greatest Puerto Rican boxers of all time.

After winning five national amateur championships in Puerto Rico, Trinidad debuted as a professional when he was seventeen, and won his first world championship by defeating Maurice Blocker to win the IBF welterweight title in 1993, a title he would hold for almost seven years with fifteen defenses. As his career continued, he defeated Oscar De La Hoya to win the WBC and lineal welterweight titles in 1999; Fernando Vargas to win the unified WBA and IBF light middleweight titles in 2000; and William Joppy for the WBA middleweight title in 2001.

Trinidad&#x27;s first professional loss was against Bernard Hopkins later in 2001, and following this, he retired from boxing for the first time. Trinidad made his ring return by defeating Ricardo Mayorga in 2004. After a losing effort against Winky Wright in 2005, he retired for a second time. In 2008 he returned once more and lost to Roy Jones Jr. Subsequently, Trinidad entered a hiatus without clarifying the status of his career.

This fight was part of a card that took place on April 3, 1998, in Bayamón, Puerto Rico and marked the first time that Trinidad had performed in the island in five years. Trinidad began the first round by cautiously analyzing the challenger&#x27;s style, but the round ended with quick exchanges after Zulu took the initiative in the offensive. In the second round Zulu was actively pursuing the champion, but retreated when he received a solid jab sequence. Early in the third round a series of jabs opened a wound on Zulu&#x27;s mouth, while the challenger&#x27;s punches were not reaching their target. Trinidad began the fourth round heavily on in the offensive connecting several combinations which hurt the challenger, using this to land more punches in Zulu&#x27;s head and body.

The judges gave the champion scores of 117–111, 118–109 and 118–109.

====Trinidad vs. De La Hoya====

Early in the fight De la Hoya employed boxing to connect combinations while avoiding Trinidad&#x27;s attacks. The second round began with both boxers trading punches but De la Hoya quickly returned to his previous tactic, which he employed in the third round. In the fourth round Trinidad pressured the offense while De la Hoya tried to avoid his punches by moving, both boxers eventually exchanged punches. In the fifth round Trinidad continued in the offensive while De la Hoya attempted to remain on the outside corners of the ring, Trinidad&#x27;s eye was swollen following a trade of punches, and his nose was also bleeding. Trinidad was having a lot of problems finding De La Hoya and couldn&#x27;t connect as flush as usual with his punches, although he scored at times, Oscar&#x27;s movement was not letting him land in combination and it was proclaimed by many to have been a lackluster fight. In the eighth round the swelling on Trinidad&#x27;s eye was worsening. Oscar was scoring on Trinidad but halfway through the tenth, De La Hoya stopped sticking and basically disengaged under instruction of his corner who thought the match was won. De La Hoya was to remain on his toes for the remainder of the bout, and Trinidad won the final 2 rounds.

His future wife, Sharon Santiago, lived in Cupey and first met Trinidad in the home of her neighborhood friend, a classmate of Trinidad&#x27;s.

He continued to press for her affection and, with the help of Santiago&#x27;s neighbor, Trinidad was able to win her over. Early on, Santiago&#x27;s mother thought that Trinidad was related to her daughter&#x27;s friend, but she realized the true situation when she visited the friend&#x27;s house and he acted nervous in her presence.

<text>In Greek mythology, the name Butes (; Ancient Greek: Βούτης, &quot;Boútēs&quot;) referred to several different people.

*Butes, an Athenian prince as the son of King Pandion I and the naiad Zeuxippe. He was a priest of Poseidon and Athena and was worshipped as a hero by the Athenians. He was married to Chthonia, daughter of his brother Erechtheus. Butes other siblings were Philomela, Procne and possibly Teuthras.
*Butes, or Butas, an Argonaut, son of Teleon and Zeuxippe (daughter of Eridanus). In some accounts, his father was called Aeneus. When the Argonauts were sailing past the Sirens, he was the only one who was unable resist the charm of their singing, swimming off to them. But Aphrodite saved Butes by transferring him to Lilybaeum in Sicily, where he became her lover. Other accounts call him a famous bee keeper and a native Sicilian king. He was the father of Eryx by Aphrodite, and also of Polycaon.
*Butes, a Thracian, Boreas&#x27;s son, who was hostile towards his stepbrother Lycurgus and was driven out of the country by him. He settled in the island of Strongyle (Naxos) with a bunch of men, and proceeded to attack those who sailed past the island. As there were no women on Strongyle to begin with, they would sail here and there to seize some from the land, but were not quite successful. When they landed in Thessaly for that purpose, Butes offended Dionysus by raping Coronis, a Maenad, and was made insane upon her imploration, in which state he threw himself down a well and died. His companions did abduct some women, including Iphimedeia and her daughter Pancratis.
*Butes, possible father of Hippodamia (wife of Pirithous). She is otherwise referred to as daughter of Atrax or Adrastus.
*Butes, son of Pallas and brother of Clytus; the two brothers were younger companions of Cephalus.
*Butes, a member of the clan of Amycus, from Bithynia, who, despite being a champion wrestler, was killed by Dares in a boxing match.
*Butes, a warrior in the army of the Seven against Thebes killed by Haemon.
*Butes, a servant of Anchises.
*Butes, a warrior who fought under Aeneas and was killed by Camilla.

<text>A yogi is a practitioner of Yoga, including a sannyasin or practitioner of meditation in Indian religions. The feminine form, sometimes used in English, is yogini.

Yogi has since the 12th century CE also denoted members of the Nath siddha tradition of Hinduism, and in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, a practitioner of tantra. In Hindu mythology, the god Shiva and the goddess Parvati are depicted as an emblematic yogi–yogini pair.

==Etymology==

In Classical Sanskrit, the word &quot;yogi&quot; (Sanskrit: masc &#x27;, योगी; fem &#x27;) is derived from &quot;yogin&quot;, which refers to a practitioner of yoga. &quot;Yogi&quot; is technically male, and &quot;yoginī&quot; is the term used for female practitioners. The two terms are still used with those meanings today, but the word &quot;yogi&quot; is also used generically to refer to both male and female practitioners of yoga and related meditative practices belonging to any religion or spiritual method.

The term yogini is also used for divine goddesses and enlightened mothers, all revered as aspects of the mother goddess, Devi.

A yogi should not be confused with someone practicing asceticism and excessive self-mortification.

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism the term &quot;yogi&quot; refers to an adherent of yoga.

=== Textual references ===

The earliest evidence of yogis and their spiritual tradition, states Karel Werner, is found in the Keśin hymn 10.136 of the Rigveda, though with the terminology of Rudra who evolved into Shiva worshipped as the lord of Yoga in later Hinduism. The Hindu scripture Rigveda uses words of admiration for the Yogis, whom it refers to as Keśin, and describes them as follows (abridged):

The term yogin appears in &quot;Katyayana Shrauta-sutra&quot; and chapter 6 of Maitri Upanishad, where the implied context and meaning is &quot;a follower of the Yoga system, a contemplative saint&quot;.

The term sometimes refers to a person who belongs to the Natha tradition. They usually belong to Shaiva tradition, but some Natha belong to the Vaishnava tradition. In both cases, states David Lorenzen, they practice yoga and their principal god tends to be Nirguna, that is a god that is without form and semi-monistic, influenced in the medieval era by the Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism, Madhyamaka school of Buddhism, as well as Tantra and Yogic practices.

The Yoga-Bhashya (400 CE), the oldest extant commentary on the Yoga-Sutra offers the following fourfold classification of yogis:

# Prathama-kalpika (neophyte/beginner, devotional) 
# Madhu-bhumika (one who has begun to enjoy the spiritual pursuits without effort)
# Prajna-jyoti (the advanced practitioner who knows spiritual concepts)
# Atikranta- bhavaniya (those who have attained what can be taught, achieved siddhas, and are on their personal path to ultimate insights)

===Sexuality===
A yogi or yogini aspires to Brahmacharya (Sanskrit: ब्रह्मचर्य), which means celibacy if single, or non-cheating on one&#x27;s partner.

There have been two parallel views, in Hindu texts, on sexuality for a yogi and yogini. One view asserts restraint in sexual activity, towards monk- and nun-like asexuality, as transmutation away from worldly desires and onto a spiritual path. It is not considered, states Stuart Sovatsky, as a form of moralistic repression but a personal choice that empowers the yoga practitioner to redirect his or her energies. The second view, found particularly in Tantra traditions according to David Gordon White, asserts that sexuality is an additional means for a yogi or yogini to journey towards and experience the bliss of &quot;one realized god-consciousness for oneself&quot;. In the second view, sexuality is a yogic practice, and one broadly revered through the &quot;lingam&quot;–&quot;yoni&quot; iconography of Shiva–Parvati, the divine yogi–yogini in Hindu mythology.

===Ethical duties===

A yogi or yogini lives by other voluntary ethical precepts called Yamas and Niyamas. These include:
* Ahiṃsā (अहिंसा): nonviolence, non-harming other living beings
* Satya (सत्य): truthfulness, non-falsehood
* Asteya (अस्तेय): not stealing
* Dayā (दया): kindness, compassion
* Ārjava (आर्जव): non-hypocrisy, sincerity
* Kṣamā (क्षमा): forgiveness
* Dhṛti (धृति): fortitude
* Mitāhāra (मितहार): moderation in diet both in terms of quantity and quality
* Śauca (शौच): purity, cleanliness
* Tapas: austerity, persistence and perseverance in one&#x27;s purpose
* Santoṣa: contentment, acceptance of others and of one&#x27;s circumstances as they are, optimism for self
* Dāna: generosity, charity, sharing with others

===Nath siddha===
According to David White,
====Respect====
Archeological evidence suggests that in some contexts and regions, yogi of the Nath Siddha tradition were respected and recognized in India. For example, inscriptions suggest a general of the Yadava king Ramacandra donated a village to a yogi in 13th-century. Near Mangalore, that later became a hub of Nath yogis, a monastery and temple was dedicated to yogis in the 10th century.

David Lorenzen states that the Nath yogis have been very popular with the rural population in South Asia, with medieval era &quot;tales and stories about Nath yogis such as Gorakhnath, Matsyendra, Jalandhar, Gopichand, Bharthari, Kanhapa and Chaurangi&quot; continuing to be remembered in contemporary times, in the Deccan, western and northern states of India and in Nepal.

====Persecution====
In some contexts, adds White, the term &quot;yogi&quot; has also been a pejorative term used in medieval India for a Nath siddha, particularly on the part of India&#x27;s social, cultural and religious elites. The term &quot;siddha&quot; has become a broad sectarian appellation, applying to Saiva-devotees in the Deccan (&quot;Maheśvara siddhas&quot;), alchemists in Tamil Nadu (&quot;siddhars&quot; or &quot;sittars&quot;), a group of early Buddhist tantrikas from Bengal (&quot;mahasiddhas&quot;, &quot;siddhacaryas&quot;), the alchemists of medieval India (&quot;rasa siddha&quot;), and a mainly north Indian group known as the &quot;Nath siddhas&quot;. The Nath siddhas are the only still existing representatives of the medieval Tantric tradition, which had disappeared due to its excesses. While the Nath siddhas enjoyed persistent popular success, they attracted the scorn of the elite classes.
According to White, the term &quot;yogi&quot;, has &quot;for at least eight hundred years, been an all-purpose term employed to designate those Saiva specialists whom orthodox Hindus have considered suspect, heterodox, and even heretical in their doctrine and practice&quot;. The yoga as practiced by these Yogis, states White, is more closely identified in the eyes of those critics with black magic, sorcery and sexual perversions than with yoga in the conventional sense of the word.

The Nath Yogis were targets of Islamic persecution in the Mughal Empire. The texts of Yogi traditions from this period, state Shail Mayaram, refer to oppressions by Mughal officials such as governor. The Mughal documents confirm the existence of Nath Yogis in each &quot;pargana&quot; (household neighborhoods), and their persecution wherein Nath Yogis were beheaded by Aurangzeb.

====Resistance to persecution====
According to David Lorenzen, the religious groups in Hinduism that militarized and took up arms following the Muslim conquest of India, to resist persecution, appeared among the Nath or Kanphata yogis, often called simply yogis or jogis.

The warrior ascetics were institutionalized as a religious order by Gorakhnath and were expanding in the 13th century, after the establishment of the first Islamic Sultanate in India. They interacted and cooperated with &quot;fakirs&quot; of Sufi Muslims. The yogis feature prominently in Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire period official documents, states David White, both in terms of impressing the ruling elite in the Muslim administration and awards of receiving land grants in some cases such as by Akbar, as well as those yogis who targeted the elite merchants and disrupted the business of administrative Islamic elites in urban areas. In other cases, yogis from the Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism traditions of Hinduism marshaled armed resistance against the Mughal and British colonial armies.

====Cultural contributions: founding Hindu temples====
The history of Nath yogis has been diverse, such as in the 11th and 12th centuries, when Buddhists in South India converted to Nath siddha traditions and helped establish Shiva Hindu temples and monasteries.

<text>In Greek mythology, Byblis or Bublis (Ancient Greek: Βυβλίς) was a daughter of Miletus. Her mother was either Tragasia, daughter of Celaenus; Cyanee, daughter of the river-god Meander; or Eidothea, daughter of King Eurytus of Caria. She fell in love with Caunus, her twin brother.

==Mythology==
===Ovid===
The most elaborate interpretation of her story is that of Ovid, and runs as follows. Byblis acknowledged her love for Caunus, and despite her initial efforts to convince herself that her feelings were natural, she realized the inappropriateness of them. Unable to keep her love for Caunus a secret from him any longer, she sent him a long love letter through a servant giving examples of other incestuous relationships between the gods. Disgusted, he ran away. Believing that she could yet make him love her, she was determined to try to woo him once more. When she found out that he had fled, she tore her clothes and stripped naked in sorrow and was driven into madness. She followed him through much of Greece and Asia Minor until she finally died, worn out by her grief and the long journey. As she had been constantly crying, she was changed into a spring.

===Parthenius===
Parthenius of Nicaea cites two versions of Byblis&#x27; story, one of which is generally the same as that recounted by Ovid, but ends with Byblis hanging herself with her girdle. In the other version, it is Caunus who instigates the incest, but Byblis still seems to return his affection; Caunus then leaves home before he can lose control over his desires, and Byblis, after a long search for him, makes a noose of her garment and hangs herself. The same version is followed by Conon.

===Antoninus===
Antoninus Liberalis again portrays Byblis as overcome with unanswered love for her brother; after Caunus leaves, she rejects the proposals of numerous suitors and attempts to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff, but is saved by hamadryads, who cause her to fall asleep and transform her into a fellow nymph.

===Nonnus===
Nonnus depicts Byblis, Caunos and Miletus as the children of Asterius, son of Minos and Androgeneia. In this account, Caunus romantically pursues Byblis with a love song referencing the incestuous relationships between the gods.

All the authors make mention of a spring which was believed to have appeared from Byblis&#x27; incessant tears.

The city Byblos in Phoenicia was believed to have taken its name from Byblis.

==&quot;Caunus and Byblis&quot; in art==
Between 1706 and 1715, the sculptor Pierre Le Gros the Younger, working in Rome, was faced with the restoration of a fragmented antique group of &quot;Amor and Psyche&quot; for the Portuguese ambassador. Thriving on invention, he turned the love story on its head and depicted the theme of &quot;Caunus and Byblis&quot; in which Caunus vehemently defends himself against the sexual advances of his sister. While Le Gros&#x27; invention ended up in Germany and was purified back to &quot;Amor and Psyche&quot; before being destroyed in a fire in 1931, it triggered a rafter of drawings, reproductions and copies by for example Pompeo Batoni, Francesco Carradori, Martin Gottlieb Klauer and, best known of all, two marble versions by Laurent Delvaux. The most faithful impression of what Le Gros&#x27; invention looked like is a plaster cast in Tiefurt House near Weimar.

<text>In Greek mythology, Caunos, Caunus or Kaunos () was a son of Miletus, grandson of Apollo and brother of Byblis. 

== Mythology ==
Caunus became the object of his own sister&#x27;s passionate love. From some accounts it appears that Caunus was the first to develop the affection towards her; others describe Byblis&#x27; feelings as unrequited. All sources agree, however, that Caunus chose to flee from home in order to prevent himself from actually committing incest with Byblis, and that she followed him until she was completely exhausted by grief and died (or committed suicide).

Caunus eventually came to Lycia, where he married the Naiad Pronoe and had by her a son Aegialus. Caunus became king of the land; when he died, Aegialus gathered all the people from scattered settlements in a newly founded city which he named Caunus after his father.

<text>Sonora (), officially Estado Libre y Soberano de Sonora (), is one of the 31 states which, along with Mexico City, comprise the Federal Entities of Mexico. The state is divided into 72 municipalities; the capital (and largest) city of which is Hermosillo, located in the center of the state. Other large cities include Ciudad Obregón, Nogales (on the Mexico-United States border), San Luis Río Colorado, and Navojoa.

Sonora is bordered by the states of Chihuahua to the east, Baja California to the west (of the north portion) and Sinaloa to the southeast. To the north, it shares the U.S.–Mexico border primarily with the state of Arizona with a small length with New Mexico, and on the southwest has a significant share of the coastline of the Gulf of California.

Sonora&#x27;s natural geography is divided into three parts: the Sierra Madre Occidental in the east of the state; plains and rolling hills in the center; and the coast on the Gulf of California. It is primarily arid or semiarid deserts and grasslands, with only the highest elevations having sufficient rainfall to support other types of vegetation.

Sonora is home to eight indigenous peoples, including the Mayo, the O&#x27;odham, the Yaqui, and Seri. The state has been economically important for its agriculture, livestock (especially beef), and mining since the colonial period, and for its status as a border state since the Mexican–American War. With the Gadsden Purchase, Sonora lost more than a quarter of its territory. From the 20th century to the present, industry, tourism, and agribusiness have dominated the economy, attracting migration from other parts of Mexico.

==Etymology==
Several theories exist as to the origin of the name &quot;Sonora&quot;. One theory states that the name was derived from &quot;Nuestra Señora&quot;, the name given to the territory when Diego de Guzmán crossed the Yaqui River on October 7, the feast day of Our Lady of the Rosary (&quot;Nuestra Señora del Rosario&quot;), the pronunciation possibly changing because the indigenous languages of the area did not have the &quot;ñ&quot; sound. Another theory is Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his companions, who had wrecked off the Florida coast and made their way across the continent, were forced to cross the arid state from north to south, carrying an image of &quot;Nuestra Señora de las Angustias&quot; (“Our Lady of Anguish”) on a cloth. They encountered the Opata, who could not pronounce &quot;Señora&quot;, instead saying &quot;Senora&quot; or &quot;Sonora&quot;. A third theory, written by Cristóbal de Cañas in 1730, states that the name comes from the word for a natural water well, &quot;sonot&quot;, which the Spaniards eventually modified to &quot;Sonora.&quot; The first record of the name “Sonora” comes from explorer Francisco Vázquez de Coronado, who passed through the state in 1540 and called part of the area &quot;Valle de la Sonora.&quot; Francisco de Ibarra also traveled through the area in 1567 and referred to the &quot;Valles de Señora&quot;. Literally, the Spanish word &quot;sonora&quot; is the feminine form of the adjective &quot;sonoro&quot; (“sonorous”, “loud”).

==History==
===Pre-Hispanic period===
Evidence of human existence in the state dates back over 10,000 years, with some of the best-known remains at the San Dieguito complex in the El Pinacate Desert. The first humans were nomadic hunter gatherers who used tools made from stones, seashells, and wood. During much of the prehistoric period, the environmental conditions were less severe than they are today, with similar but more dense vegetation spread over a wider area.

The oldest Clovis culture site in North America is believed to be El Fin del Mundo in northwestern Sonora. It was discovered during a 2007 survey. It features occupation dating around 13,390 calibrated years Before Present. At the site, remains of the gomphothere &quot;Cuvieronius&quot; were found associated with Clovis spear points, suggesting that the animals had been hunted.

Agriculture first appeared around and in the river valleys. Remains of ceramics have been found dating from with diversification from 800 and Between 1100 and 1350, the region had socially complex small villages with well-developed trade networks. The lowland central coast, however, seems never truly to have adopted agriculture. Because Sonora and much of the northwest does not share many of the cultural traits of that area, it is not considered part of Mesoamerica. Though evidence exists of trade between the peoples of Sonora and Mesoamerica, Guasave in Sinaloa is the most north-westerly point considered Mesoamerican.

Three archaeological cultures developed in the low, flat areas of the state near the coast: the Trincheras tradition, the Huatabampo tradition, and the Central Coast tradition. The Trincheras tradition is dated to between 750 and 1450 CE and mostly known from sites in the Altar, Magdalena, and Concepción valleys, but its range extended from the Gulf of California into northern Sonora. The tradition is named after trenches found in a number of sites, the best known of which is the Cerro de Trincheras. The Huatabampo tradition is centered south of the Trincheras along the coast, with sites along extinct lagoons, estuaries, and river valleys. This tradition has a distinctive ceramic complex. Huatabampo culture shows similarities with the Chametla to the south and the Hohokam to the north. This probably ended around 1000 CE. Unlike the other two traditions, the Central Coast remained a hunter-gatherer culture, as the area lacks the resources for agriculture.

The higher elevations of the state were dominated by the Casas Grandes and Río Sonora tradition. The Río Sonora culture is located in central Sonora from the border area to modern Sinaloa. A beginning date for this culture has not been determined but it probably disappeared by the early 14th century. The Casas Grandes tradition in Sonora was an extension of the Río Sonora tradition based in the modern state of Chihuahua, which exerted its influence down to parts of the Sonoran coast.

Climatic changes in the middle of the 15th century resulted in the increased desertification of northwest Mexico in general. This is the probable cause for the drastic decrease in the number and size of settlements starting around this time. The peoples that remained in the area reverted to a less complex social organization and lifestyle. Whatever socially complex organization existed in Sonora before the Spaniards was long gone by the 16th century.

=== Viceroyalty of New Spain ===
Little reliable information remains about the area in the 16th century following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. Some state that the first Spanish settlement was founded by Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca in 1530, near Huépac. Others state that Francisco Vásquez de Coronado founded a village on the edge of the Yaqui River in 1540 on his way north. Another source states that the first Spanish presence was not until 1614, by missionaries such as Pedro Méndez and Pérez de Rivas, working with the Mayo. Unlike in central Mexico, no central social or economic centralization occurred in the Sonora area, given the collapse of population centers in the 15th century. The five traditions of the past had broken down to a number of fractured ethnicities. No empire or other system was present for the Spaniards to co-opt for domination purposes. In addition, the Yaqui people resisted European intrusion on their lands, effectively keeping the Spaniards out of their area until the 17th century. While exploration of the area happened through the expeditions of the 16th century, significant permanent Spanish settlement did not become possible until the establishment of the mission system.

Jesuit priests began to work in Sonora in the 1610s in the lowlands near the coast. Originally, these missionaries worked out a peaceful compromise with the 30,000 Yaquis allowing for the establishment of more than fifty mission settlements in the Sonora river valleys. This broke down when the Jesuits opposed the native shamanic religious tradition. The Opata were more receptive to the missionaries and allied with them. After this, the Jesuits began to move into Pima and Tohono O&#x27;odham territories. Spanish exploration and missionary work was sufficient to consider the territory part of New Spain. An agreement between General and the viceroy of New Spain resulted in the general shaping of the province, initially called &quot;Nueva Navarra&quot; in 1637, but renamed &quot;Sonora&quot; in 1648.

The most famous missionary of Sonora, as well as much of what is now the American Southwest, was Eusebio Kino. He arrived in Sonora in 1687 and started missionary work in the Pimería Alta area of Sonora and Arizona. He began his first mission at Cucurpe, then established churches and missions in other villages such as Los Remedios, Imuris, Magdalena, Cocóspera, San Ignacio, Tubutama and Caborca. To develop an economy for the natives, Father Kino also taught them European farming techniques.

The initial attraction of Sonora for the Spaniards was its fertile farmlands along the river valleys and its position as part of a corridor linking the central Mexican highlands around Mexico City up the Pacific coast and on into Arizona and points north. This corridor still exists in the form of Federal Highway 15. After the establishment of the mission system, Spanish colonists followed. Indigenous response was a mixture of accommodation and violence, as different strategies were employed by different groups at different times. The sporadic violence, which would continue throughout the colonial period, resulted in the Spanish building presidios and other fortifications to protect missions and Spanish settlements. While the colonization process was not especially violent, the impact on the indigenous of the area was severe, as it almost completely disrupted their formerly very independent lives, forcing them to conform to an alien centralized system. One consequence of this was alcoholism among the native peoples.

In 1691, what are now the states of Sonora and Sinaloa were joined into an entity called the &quot;Provincias de Sonora, Ostimuri, y Sinaloa&quot;. They would remain as such through the rest of the colonial period until 1823. At this time, about 1,300 Spanish settlers were in the area. Colonization increased in the 18th century, especially from 1700 to 1767, when mineral deposits were discovered, especially in Álamos. This led to the establishment of a number of royally controlled mining camps, forcing many natives off their agricultural lands. Loss of said lands along the Yaqui and Mayo Rivers led to native uprisings during this time. A major Seri rebellion took place on the coast area in 1725–1726, but the largest uprising was by the Yaquis and Mayos from 1740 to 1742 with the goal of expelling the Spaniards. Part of the reason for the rebellion was that the Jesuits, as well as the secular Spaniards, were exploiting the indigenous. This rebellion destroyed the reputation of the Jesuit mission system. Another Seri rebellion occurred in 1748, with Pima and Tohono O&#x27;otham support and lasted into the 1750s. This kept the settlement situation in disarray. With population of the Mexican split half indigenous and half Spanish, about one-quarter of the indigenous population lived in Sonora alone. In 1767, the king of Spain expelled the Jesuits from Spanish-controlled territories, ending the mission system.

===Independence===
In 1821, the colonial era in Sonora was ended by the Mexican War of Independence, which started in 1810. Without being directly involved in the war, Sonora became part of an independent Mexico, which allowed for economic development. The former province of &quot;Sonora, Ostimuri, y Sinaloa&quot; was divided in 1823 to form the states of Sonora and Sinaloa, with the Sonoran capital in Ures. They were reunited in 1824 but became separate again in 1831, when Sonora wrote its first state constitution, which put the capital in Hermosillo. In 1832, the capital was moved to Arizpe.

In 1835, the government of Sonora put a bounty on the Apache which, over time, evolved into a payment by the government of 100 pesos for each scalp of a male 14 or more years old. James L. Haley wrote: &quot;In 1835, Don Ignacio Zúñiga, who was the long-time commander of the presidios of northern Sonora, asserted that since 1820 the Apaches had killed at least five thousand settlers, which convinced another four thousand to flee, forced the abandonment of over one hundred settlements, and caused the virtual depopulation of the interior frontier. ... The state of Sonora resorted to paying a bounty on Apache scalps in 1835.&quot;

The struggles between the Conservatives, who wanted a centralized government, and Liberals, who wanted a federalist system, affected the entire country during the 19th century. In 1835, a centralist government was instituted based on what were called the &quot;Bases Constitucionales&quot; (&quot;Constitutional Bases&quot;). They were followed by the &quot;Siete Leyes Constitucionales&quot; (&quot;Seven Constitutional Laws&quot;), which remained in effect until 1837. But in December of the same year, General José de Urrea proclaimed in Arizpe the re-establishment of the Constitution of 1824, initially supported by then-Governor Manuel Gándara. However, for the rest of the century, Gándara and succeeding governors would support a centralized government, leading to political instability in the state. In 1838, the capital was moved back to Ures.

The fertile lands of the Mayo and Yaquis continued to attract outsiders during the 19th century. These were now Mexicans rather than Spaniards, and later in the century, it was a major draw for North Americans. By the end of the 19th century, however, the area received large numbers of immigrants from Europe, especially from Germany, Italy, and Russia, the Middle East, mainly Lebanon or Syria, and even China, who brought new forms of agriculture, mining, livestock, industrial processes, ironwork, and textiles.

The Mexican–American War resulted in only one major military confrontation between Mexican and United States forces, but its consequences were severe for the state. In October 1847, the warship USS &quot;Cyane&quot; laid siege to Guaymas Bay, resulting in United States control of this part of the coast until 1848. When the war ended, Sonora lost 339,370 hectares (13,200 square miles) of its territory to the United States through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Additionally, the war ruined the state&#x27;s economy. Sonora lost more territory in the 1850s, through the Gadsden Purchase. Before the war, Sonora was the largest State in Mexico. The State lost more than 29,000 square miles to the United States as a result of the 1853 Gadsden Purchase. The majority of the area is today&#x27;s Arizona south of the Gila River and a part of the present-day southwestern New Mexico. The area&#x27;s political vulnerability immediately after the war made it susceptible to buccaneers such as William Walker, Gaston de Raousset-Boulbon, and Henry Alexander Crabb, who attacked Sonoran ports such as Guaymas and Caborca. However, most attacks were repelled. The economy did not begin to recover from the war until the late 1850s, when Ignacio Pesqueira became governor and attracted foreign investment to the state, especially in the mining sector, as well as worked to create markets abroad for agricultural products.

During the Second Mexican Empire, Sonora was taken over by French and Mexican Imperial troops as part of the Mexican conservative party&#x27;s election of Maximilian I as Emperor of Mexico. The port of Guaymas was attacked by forces under Armando Castagny, forcing Mexican forces under Pesqueira and General Patoni to retreat north of the city. Imperial troops attacked the republicans again &quot;La Pasión&quot;, again resulting in defeat for the republican resistance. The French and Mexican Imperialists were not defeated in the state until the Battle of Llanos de Ures in 1866 by Pesqueira, Jesús García Morales and Ángel Martínez. Shortly after this, the state&#x27;s current constitution was written in 1871, and its capital was permanently moved to Hermosillo.
During the regime of Porfirio Díaz from the late 19th century to the 20th century, major economic changes occurred. These changes promoted rapid economic growth, which had far-reaching social and political consequences. Sonora and the rest of the northern states rapidly increased in economic importance. Development of a rail system integrated the state&#x27;s economy into the national, and also allowed greater federal control over all of Mexico&#x27;s territory. After 1880, this rail system was extended north into the United States, making it an important part of binational economic relations to this day. However, the changes also permitted foreigners and certain Mexicans to take over very large tracts of land in Mexico. In Sonora, Guillermo Andrade controlled , Manuel Peniche and American William Cornell Green about . Foreign industry owners also tended to bring in Asian and European workers. Chinese immigration into Sonora would begin at this time, and the Chinese soon became an economic force as they built small businesses that spread wherever economic development occurred.

The appropriation of land for both agriculture and mining placed renewed pressure on the Yaquis and other native peoples of Sonora. Previously, active resistance had given the Yaqui fairly autonomous control of a portion of the state and kept their agricultural system along the Yaqui River. Encroachment on this land led to uprisings and guerilla warfare by the Yaquis after 1887. By 1895, the federal and state governments began to violently repress the Yaquis and forcefully relocate captured Yaquis to the plantations in Mexico&#x27;s tropical south, especially the henequen plantations in the Yucatán Peninsula. The Yaqui resistance continued into the 20th century, with the expulsions reaching a peak between 1904 and 1908, by which time about one-quarter of this population had been deported. Still more were forced to flee into Arizona.

===20th century===

The policies of the Díaz government caused resentment not only among the Yaquis, but also throughout the country. One of the preludes to the Mexican Revolution was the 1906 Cananea miner&#x27;s strike. Approximately 2,000 strikers sought negotiations with American mine owner William Greene, but he refused to meet with them. The strike quickly turned violent when the miners tried to take control of the mine and gunfire was exchanged. Greene requested help from federal troops, but when it was obvious they could not arrive in time, he appealed to the governments of Arizona and Sonora to allow Arizona volunteers to assist him. This increased the scale of the violence. When Mexican federal troops arrived two days later, they put everything to a brutal end, with the suspected leaders of the strike executed. The heavy-handed way in which Díaz had handled the strike made resentment against Diaz grow, with more strikes beginning in other areas.

In late 1910, the Mexican Revolution began in earnest, and Díaz was quickly deposed. The governor of Coahuila, Venustiano Carranza, sought refuge in Sonora, and became one of the principal political leaders during the rest of the war, with his main base of operations in Hermosillo. A number of the revolutionary leaders who joined Carranza in Sonora did not come from peasant backgrounds, but rather the lower middle class of hacienda-managers, shopkeepers, mill-workers, or schoolteachers, who opposed large-scale landowners and the Porfirian elite. After Díaz was deposed, Carranza competed for power against Álvaro Obregón and others. The Yaquis joined with Álvaro Obregón&#x27;s forces after 1913.

By 1920, Carranza had become president of Mexico, but found himself opposed by Obregón and others. Carranza tried to suppress political opposition in Sonora, which led to the Plan of Agua Prieta, which formalized the resistance to Carranza by Obregón and his allies (primarily Abelardo L. Rodríguez, Benjamín Hill and Plutarco Elías Calles). This movement soon dominated the political situation, but it caused widespread political instability in doing so. Obregón deposed Carranza and became the next president of Mexico. For the 1924 presidential elections, Obregón chose to succeed himself Plutarco Elias Calles, who was also a revolutionary leader from Sonora. This effectively ended the war, but hostilities had again destroyed the Sonoran economy. From 1920 to the early 1930s, four Sonorans came to occupy the Mexican presidency: Adolfo de la Huerta, Obregón, Calles and Rodríguez.

The Chinese first arrived at Guaymas in the late 19th century and congregated there and in Hermosillo. Over the following decades, they moved into growing communities such as Magdalena and Cananea. Rather than working in the fields, most started their own small businesses, networking with other Chinese. These businesses spanned a wide range of industries from manufacturing to retail sales of nearly every type of merchandise. The Chinese in Sonora not only become successful shopkeepers, they eventually came to control local small businesses in many areas of the state. By 1910, the Chinese population in Sonora was 4,486 out of a total population of 265,383, making them the largest foreign presence in the state, with only North Americans a close second at 3,164. Almost none were female, as there were only 82 Chinese females in the entire country at the time. The Chinese population reached its peak in 1919 with 6,078 people, again with almost no Chinese women.
Resentment against Chinese success began quickly, and Sinophobia rose sharply during the Mexican Revolution as many Chinese prospered despite the war, and many attacks were targeted against them. The first organized anti-Chinese campaign in Sonora began in 1916 in Magdalena. A more serious campaign began in 1925, calling for their expulsion from the state. Mass expulsions were mostly carried out in Sonora and Sinaloa, partly because of their large populations, but the Chinese, often with their Mexican wives and children, were deported from all over the country. Some were returned to China but many others were forced to enter the United States through the border with Sonora, even though Chinese exclusion laws were still in effect there. Sonoran governor Rodolfo Elias Calles was responsible for the expulsion of most Chinese-Mexican families into United States territory. Despite the diplomatic problems this caused, Elias Calles did not stop the expulsions until he himself was expelled from Sonora. However, by that time almost all of Sonora&#x27;s Chinese-Mexicans had disappeared. By the 1940 census, only 92 Chinese were still living in Sonora, with more than two-thirds of these having acquired Mexican citizenship. This had the unintended consequence of nearly collapsing the Sonoran economy.

The efforts at modernization and economic development begun in the Díaz period would continue through the Revolution and on through the rest of the 20th century. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the process of electrification greatly increased the demand for copper, which led to a boom in mining in Sonora and neighboring Arizona. Cananea grew very quickly from a village of 900 to a city of 20,000. It also led to a network of roads, railroads and other connections across the border. However, organized development of the state&#x27;s agriculture was put on hold because of the Revolution, the Great Depression and other political upheavals.

In the 1930s, Sonora benefitted from a number of national policies aimed at developing the cities on the border with the United States and at building a number of dams to help develop agriculture and the general water supply. Major agricultural reform was begun in the 1940s in the Mayo River area, when the delta was cleared of natural vegetation and made into farmland. Water for these farms was secure through the building of the Mocúzari Dam about from Navojoa. When it was completed in 1951, there was a system of canals, wells and highways to support large-scale agriculture for shipment to other places.

In the last half of the 20th century, the state&#x27;s population has grown and foreign investment has increased due to its strategic location along the border and its port of Guaymas. More than 200 international and domestic enterprises moved into the state, allowing for the development of modern infrastructure such as highways, ports and airports, making the state one of the best connected in the country. A bridge was built over the Colorado River to link Sonora with neighboring Baja California in 1964. One important sector of the economy has been industry, culminating in the Ford automotive plant in Hermosillo and a number of assembly plants called maquiladoras on the border with the United States. One of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy has been tourism, now one of the most important sectors of the economy, especially along the coast, with the number of visitors there increasing every year. This has led to a surge in hotel infrastructure, especially in Puerto Peñasco.
For most of the 20th century, Mexico was dominated by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Discontent with this one-party system became prominent in the northern states of Mexico, including Sonora. As early as 1967, a competing party, the National Action Party (PAN), won control of the city government of Sonora&#x27;s capital, Hermosillo. PAN won important municipal victories in the state in 1983, which President de la Madrid refused to officially recognize but was forced to let stand. PAN&#x27;s growing strength by the 1980s forced the PRI to nominate candidates who were similar to PAN, successful business executives who favored economic liberalization over traditional Mexican statism, preferred in the north of the country. Institutional Revolutionary Party won the Sonoran gubernatorial race in 1985, but it was heavily contested with obvious problems of fraud. By the 1990s, PRI operatives caught manipulating election results were actually prosecuted by the Sonoran state attorney. This along with other events in the country eventually led to the end of the one-party system when Vicente Fox was elected president in 2000. PAN has since dominated most of the north of the country, but Sonora did not have its first PAN governor until 2009, with the election of Guillermo Padrés Elías.

Sonora&#x27;s border with Arizona has received more attention since 2000, with the increase of illegal border crossings and drug smuggling, especially in rural areas such as around Naco, which is one of the main routes into the United States. Starting in the 1990s, increased border patrols and the construction of corrugated metal and chain link fences in California and Texas dramatically cut illegal border crossing in these two states. This led illegal immigrants into the more dangerous desert areas of Arizona and New Mexico, which have mostly seen rises in illegal crossings since then. Many migrants now come to the Arizona border between Agua Prieta and Nogales, with Naco as one of the preferred routes for &quot;coyotes&quot; (also called &quot;polleros&quot; or &quot;enganchadores&quot;) or smugglers who offer to take migrants across. Migrant shelters and hotel in border towns cater to those waiting to cross into Arizona. Providing lodging for migrants is a growing business in Naco and other border towns, where the rate is between 200 and 300 pesos per night per person. Many of these lodgings are filled with people who cannot cross the border. One example is the Hospedaje Santa María, which is a run-down, two-story building.
Forty-five percent of the deaths of migrants occur on the Arizona side of the border. According to Arizonan authorities, 2010 was a record year for deaths in Arizona for people crossing illegally from Sonora, with the bodies of 252 crossers found in the deserts between the New Mexico and California borders. This broke the previous record of 234 in 2007, with nearly 2,000 found in this area since 2001. However, Mexican officials state that the figures are higher, with over four hundred dying in Arizona deserts in 2005 alone. In 2006, Mexican officials began to distribute maps of Arizona to Mexicans gathered in Sonoran border town with the intention of crossing illegally. The Mexican government stated the reason for the maps was to help Mexican avoid dangerous areas that have caused deaths from the desert&#x27;s heat.

Migration and drug smuggling problem has affected most border towns. Many people make a living by catering migrants or working as &quot;coyote&quot; guides. People hoping to cross the border and those recently deported crowd the border area; some of these people return home, but many others decide to stay on the Sonoran border, working to earn money for another attempt. These workers put a strain on insufficient municipal medical services. The walls, which have shut down much of the illegal crossing into Texas and California, have also been built on parts of the Arizona border, especially between towns such as the two Nacos and the two Nogaleses. The wall in Naco is four meters high and made of steel. It currently extends , but there are plans to extend it another . Security there was further tightened after the 2001 September 11 attacks. The U.S. Border Patrol credits the wall and better surveillance technology with cutting the number of captured border crossers near Naco by half in 2006. People on both sides of the wall have mixed feelings about it.

Violence connected to drug smuggling on the border and in Mexico in general has caused problems with tourism, an important segment of the entire country. Federal troops have been stationed here due to the violence, which has the population divided. While the security they can provide is welcomed, there is concern about the violation of human rights. In 2005, the state began advertising campaigns to reassure Arizonans that it is safe to cross the border.

==Geography==

===Natural divisions===
Sonora is located in northwest Mexico. It has a territory of and is the second largest state of the country. It borders the states of Sinaloa, Chihuahua, and Baja California Norte, with the United States to its north and the Gulf of California to its west. Its border with the United States is long. The state is divided into five hydraulic regions – Río Colorado, Sonora Norte, Sonora Sur, Sinaloa, Cuencas Cerradas del Norte.

The state&#x27;s geography is divided into three regions created by the rise of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains and the separation of the Baja California Peninsula, with all three running roughly north–south. The mountains dominate eastern Sonora, while the center is dominated by plains and rolling hills, which then extend west to the coast on the Gulf of California.

===Center plains and coast===
The center plains and coastline were both created by the tearing away of the Baja California Peninsula between ten and twelve million years ago. These plains are between and wide, wedged between the Sierra Madre and the Gulf of California, which began to form between 5.5 and 6 million years ago. Climate patterns bring moisture east from the Pacific Ocean, forming rivers and streams that cross the plains area and empty into the gulf. These rivers have brought down sediment from the volcanic rock of the Sierra Madre and eventually buried most of the mountains and hills of the center of the state, smoothing them into plains. These soils are rich in clays and thousands of feet thick in places, making this region very fertile, only lacking water.

The state has of coastline, all of which faces the Gulf of California, with its relatively shallow and very calm waters. There are beaches along most of this coastline, some of which with fine, white sand. The best known of these are San Carlos, Puerto Peñasco and Bahía Kino. San Carlos, with its Los Algodones Beach is one of the most visited areas on the Sonoran coast. &quot;Los Algodones&quot; (&quot;The Cottons&quot;) is named for its dunes of white sand, which can be compared to cotton balls. San Carlos has a large variety of sea life off its shores, making it popular for sports fishing and scuba diving. A number of Yaquis, Seris and Guaymas on and around the Tetakawi Hill, making a living from fishing.
Puerto Peñasco is located in the extreme northwest of the state in the Upper Gulf somewhat near where the Colorado River empties. It contains of beaches on calm seas, located in the Altar Desert near El Pinacate biosphere reserve, with some of the driest climates in Mexico. Since the 1990s, it has experienced large-scale development along its of beaches, which have calm seas. The area has experienced a building boom since the 2000s. However, as of late 2013, many buildings are vacant, for sale, or neglected due to the suppressed economic conditions and the corresponding decline in tourism.

Bahía Kino is located near San Carlos, with a dock located in the community of Kino Viejo. This bay&#x27;s beaches have white sand, with warm calm waters off of them. For this reason, Bahía Viejo calls itself &quot;la perla del Mar de Cortés&quot; (&quot;the pearl of the Gulf of California&quot;). The area is popular for scuba diving and sports fishing as its waters are filled with various species of multicolored fish, small invertebrates, large crustaceans, manta rays, sponges and turtles. On the neighboring islands, sea lions can be seen. Off this coast is the Isla Tiburón, Mexico&#x27;s largest island and a nature reserve with wild sheep and deer. There are indigenous communities here, especially at Punta Chueca, which still practice hunting, fishing and collecting natural resources, as well as selling crafts to tourists.

Lesser known beaches include El Desemboque, El Himalaya and Huatabampito. El Desemboque is a small Seri village with beaches located northwest of Hermosillo, just south of Puerto Libertad. Activities in the area include scuba diving and swimming in isolated and relatively undeveloped beaches. The current name is from Spanish (disembarkation point), but the Seri name for the area means &quot;where there are clams&quot;. El Himalaya Beach is located forty km from Guaymas. It is a semi virgin beach surrounded by calm waters, mountains, and unusual species of flora and fauna and cave paintings. The area is filled with large stone yellow-red rock formations that were created by a volcanic eruption. Huatabampito is an area of beaches in the south of the state. The beaches have delicate dune of fine sand and the waters are clear with a green-blue color. Each year, whales arrive to this area to reproduce in the warm waters. This is the main attraction, bringing visitors from Mexico and abroad.

===Sierra Madre Occidental===

The east of the state is dominated by the Sierra Madre Occidental, which has less extreme temperatures and, due to the high elevation, relatively more rainfall. As moist air masses move inland from the Pacific and the tropics and are forced against the mountains, they cool and this leads to precipitation, mostly rain but occasional snows in the highest regions. This process takes most of the moisture out of the air and feeds the various rivers and streams, which empty into Gulf of California as well as underground aquifers under the coastal plain.

===Flora and fauna===

Habitats and vegetation vary greatly depending on elevation and rainfall. An estimated of Sonora is in arid grasslands; are covered in forests, in rainforest and in farmland. Seventy percent of the territory, or , is covered in desert vegetation or arid grasslands. The Yécora municipality in eastern Sonora has one of the highest grass diversities in Mexico. There are eight types of desert vegetation, seven of which are native to the Sonoran Desert and one in the area that transitions to the Chihuahua Desert. Most are scrubs or small bushes, which generally do not reach over in height, most of the rest are cactus, with some mangroves and other halophile plants. Many plants are rainfall sensitive, with most trees and shrubs growing leaves and flowers just before or during the rainy season, then drop their leaves afterwards. However, there are plants in flower at one time or another throughout the year. Coastal plants receive less water stress due to lower evaporation rates, and substantial moisture from dew, especially in the cooler months.

Most forests are located in the northeast of the state, covering about 6.4% of the state. This is the area with the coolest temperatures. Deforestation has been a significant problem, especially after 1980, because the rate of cutting trees has increased. In central Sonora, the area covered by Madrean evergreen woodland and Sonoran Desert scrub decreased 28% and 31%, respectively, between 1973 and 1992 (ValdezZamudio et al. 2000). During this same period, For example, much of the forests of mesquite trees in the lower elevations of the state have disappeared because of the demand for local fuels and the market for mesquite charcoal in Mexico and the United States

Most of northern Mexico suffers from one of the world&#x27;s highest rates of desertification due to land degradation in arid and semi-arid areas, with the loss of biological and/or economic productivity, but the process is most severe in Sonora and neighboring Sinaloa. Land degradation occurs because of clearing land for agriculture, the planting of non-native buffelgrass for grazing, the cutting of forests, overgrazing of natural vegetation and soil salinization from irrigation. A study by Balling in 1998 showed higher soil and air temperatures in areas that have been overgrazed, deforested and otherwise cleared land, likely due to the lack of shading vegetation, which leads to higher soil evaporation and desert conditions. Studies have also indicated that warming trends are higher in Sonora than in neighboring Arizona, into which the Sonora Desert also extends.

The state contains 139 species and subspecies of native mammals, with the most important being white tailed deer, mule deer, wild sheep, bats, hares, squirrels, moles, beavers, coyotes, wolves, foxes, jaguars, and mountain lions. Amphibians and reptiles include frogs and toads, desert tortoises, chameleons, gila monsters, rattlesnakes and other types of snakes. The number of bird species native to the state is not known, but major species include roadrunners, quail, turkeys, buzzards and doves.

===Climate===

During the Pliocene, the detachment of Baja California, the development of the Gulf of California and the cool California current drastically reduced moisture coming into Sonora leading to severe regional aridity in both this state and neighboring Baja California. This created xeric communities and the development of species endemic only to this region.

There are four major climate regions in the state: arid (Köppen &quot;BW&quot;), semi-arid lands (&quot;BS&quot;), semi-moist lands, and temperate zones (&quot;Cwb&quot;). Ninety percent of the state has arid or semi-arid conditions. The other two climates are restricted to the areas of the state with the highest altitude such as the Yécora area, the mountains north of Cananea and a strip along the southeast of the state on the Chihuahua border.

Average annual maximum temperatures range from in Yécora to in Tesia, municipality of Navojoa. Average annual minimum temperatures range from in Yécora to in Orégano, municipality of Hermosillo. In the winter, cold air masses from the north reach the state, and can produce below freezing temperatures and high winds at night in the higher elevations, but the temperature can then jump back up to over during the afternoon. Freezing temperatures almost never occur in the lowlands. In February 2011, the Mexican government recorded a low in Yécora of .
Precipitation is seasonal and mostly occurs in the higher elevations. In hot and arid or semi-arid lands, evaporation vastly exceeds precipitation. Mexico&#x27;s most arid area, the Altar Desert is located in this state. The east of the state is dominated by the Sierra Madre Occidental, which has less extreme temperatures and relatively more rainfall due to altitude. Most moisture comes in from the Pacific Ocean and the tropics, which is pushed against the Sierra Madre. This cools the air masses, leading to rain and occasionally snow in the higher elevations. While most of the rain falls in the mountainous areas, much of this water finds its way back to the western coastal plains in the form of rivers and streams that empty into the Gulf of California and fill underground aquifers. Most of the year&#x27;s precipitation falls during the rainy season, which is locally called &quot;las aguas&quot; (the waters). These last from July to mid-September, when monsoon winds bring moist air from southerly tropical waters. Most of this is from the Pacific Ocean west of Central America but can also come from Gulf of Mexico as well. This moister flow results in nearly daily afternoon thunderstorms. After the las aguas, there may be additional moisture brought in by hurricanes, which generally move west along the Pacific coast of Mexico and occasionally come inland, especially in southern Sonora. However, these storms tend to drop large quantities of rain in a short time, causing flooding and destruction.

In the winter, from November to February, there are light rains called &quot;equipatas&quot; (&quot;horse hoofs&quot;, named after the sound the rain makes). These rains come in from the north from the southern extensions of frontal storms that originate in the northern Pacific Ocean. These end by March or April when the fronts are no longer strong enough to reach this far south. They end even earlier in the extreme south of the state as the storm systems retreat, with the dry season lasting eight or nine months in this part of the state. In the north, these rains support a wide variety of spring annuals and wildflowers, but the water they supply in the south of the state is still important to help replenish wells.

===Hydrology===

With the exception of the Colorado River, river and aquifer systems in Sonora are a result of rains from incoming clouds rising above the Sierra Madre Occidental. This water runs down the west side of the mountains along the canyons and valleys towards the plains and coast and into the Gulf of California, Sonora has seven major rivers – the Colorado River, the Concepción River, the San Ignacio River, the Sonora River, the Mátepe River, the Yaqui River and the Mayo River. Dams, such as Alvaro Obregon, Adolfo Ruiz Cortines, Plutarco Elias Calles, Abelardo Rodriguez and Lázaro Cárdenas, have been built along some of these rivers, at least two of them where natural lakes existed. Some of the dams formed large deltas, such as that of the Mayo River. The largest aquifers are mostly found between Hermosillo and coast, the Guaymas Valley and the area around Caborca. Most of these are having problems due to overpumping for agricultural irrigation.

===Protected areas===
Sonora has of protected wildlife areas. Protected natural areas in the state are of three types: biosphere reserves, areas for the protection of flora and fauna and areas for the protection of natural resources. The El Pinacate biosphere reserve is located between Puerto Peñasco and the United States border in the Altar Desert. The reserve consists of an area with a series of gigantic dormant volcanic craters, which are covered with flora and fauna. It is frequently visited by foreign tourists, researchers and photographers. The reserve has a site museum, which displays the area history from its formation to the present. The craters are named &quot;Badillo&quot;, &quot;Molina&quot; or &quot;El Trébol&quot;, &quot;Cerro Colorado&quot;, &quot;Volcan Grande&quot;, &quot;Caravajales&quot; and the largest, &quot;Mc Dougal&quot;.

The Cañón las Barajitas (&quot;Barajitas Canyon&quot;) is a protected natural area that consists of three different ecosystems, located north of San Carlos. It contains a kilometer of beaches and a canyon which has two distinct microclimates, one arid and desert-like and the other subtropical. The area has a wide variety of fauna including whales, dolphins and manta rays that can be seen off the coast depending on the season. Activities for visitors include kayaking, paddleboats, scuba diving and fishing. There are also caves as well as a solor observatory.

The Alto Golfo y Delta (&quot;Upper Gulf and Delta&quot;) biosphere reserve encompasses is in the northwest of Sonora and northeast of Baja California Norte at the northernmost part of the Gulf of California and the delta of the Colorado River. The area is home to a very large number of marine species. There are also rocky beaches along with those with fine sand. Some of these are home to groups of seals and sea lions. The reserve was created in 1993 and encompasses an area of 934,756 hectares. On land, there are arid scrub brush, coastal dunes and an estuary. It extends into the far upper part of the Gulf of California.

The Bahía e islas de San Jorge (&quot;Bay and Islands of San Jorge&quot;), covering , are located on Sonora&#x27;s northern coast between Caborca and Puerto Peñasco. The islands were first made a federal reserve in 1978 due to its importance to migratory birds. They are especially important to species such as the Sterna antillarum, colonies of Sula leucogaster, Myotis vivesi and Zalophus californianus. The islands are large rocks and are white from guano. The beaches extend for ten km and end at the bay of San Jorge on the south end. The area is home to sea lions and a type of bat that fishes. There are sand dunes with arid zone vegetation as well as a small estuary. The climate is very arid and semi hot with an average temperature of between .

The Isla Tiburón is an ecological reserve with about 300 species of plants with desert and marine wildlife. The island was once inhabited by the Seris, and they still consider it their territory.

The La Mesa el Campanero-Arroyo El Reparo reserve is found in the municipality of Yécora. It is a mesa with mountains which cover , containing pine and tropical forests, rivers, arroyos, rock formations and dirt roads. Due to its altitude of between 700 and 2100 meters above sea level, its temperatures are temperate for the state. It is part of the Sierra Madre Occidential bio region and in the upper basins of the Yaqui and Mayo rivers.

==Politics and government==
Sonora is divided into 72 municipalities. 
==Mexico-United States border==

Sonora&#x27;s border with the United States is long, and runs through desert and mountains, from the western Chihuahuan Desert, through an area of grasslands and oak mountain areas to the Sonoran Desert west of Nogales. The area gets drier from here west and the last third of the border is generally uninhabited. There are six official border crossings. From east to west these at Agua Prieta, Naco, Nogales, Sasabe, Sonoyta and San Luis Río Colorado. In populated areas, much of the border is marked by corrugated metal walls, but most of the rest is marked by barbed wire fence and border monuments.

Like others in the world, the border is a culture unto itself, not belonging 100% to either country. Interaction between the peoples on both sides is a part of both the culture and the economy. In the 1980s, an international volleyball game was regularly held near Naco, with the chain link border fence serving as the net. Much of Arizona and Sonora share a cuisine based on the wheat, cheese and beef that was introduced to the region by the Spaniards, with wheat tortillas being especially large on both sides of the border. This diet is reinforced by the vaquero/cowboy tradition which continues in both states. The six border crossings are essential to the existence and extent of the communities that surround them, as most of them function as ports for the passage of goods between the two countries. People regularly shop and work on the other side, taking advantage of opportunities there. The economic opportunities of the border are not equal on both sides. Most of the population along this border lives on the Sonoran side, many of which have moved here for the opportunities created by the maquiladoras and other businesses. These are lacking on the Arizona side.

The border has separated the region&#x27;s indigenous populations, such as the Tohono O&#x27;odham. While members of the Tohono O&#x27;odham have special border crossing privileges, these have become endangered as Mexican farmers encroach on tribal lands in Sonora, which are vulnerable to drug smugglers. Yaquis in Arizona travel south to the Yaqui River area for festivals, especially Holy Week, and Yaquis travel north to Arizona for cultural reasons as well. When Father Kino arrived in this area, he named much of it the Pimería Alta, as Pima territory extends from the highlands of eastern Sonora up towards Tucson.

Authorities on each side work to keep out from the other that which is undesirable. For the United States, this mostly involves drugs and illegal immigrants. For Mexico, this mostly involves struggling against the importation of untaxed goods, especially automobiles. Smuggling people and drugs into the United States is big business in Mexico, but while it affects everyone living on the border, it is generally not seen, except for occasional newspaper headlines, occasional violent crime and religious articles geared to those in the trade. Illegal crossings taking place through tunnels, hidden cars and trucks or most commonly, simply passing through a gap in the fence, especially in the more remote areas. In 1990, a tunnel linking two warehouses in Agua Prieta and Douglas, Arizona was discovered. It was sophisticated with hydraulic equipment and means to move large quantities of goods. At least three corridos have been written about this tunnel.

==Demographics==
=== Largest cities===

===General population===

Economic growth in the state since the Mexican Revolution has led to steady population growth. However, this population growth has been concentrated on the arid coastline due to the dominant agriculture and fishing industries. Eighty-five percent of Sonora&#x27;s population growth since 1970 has been in this area. Another area where there have been gains are municipalities with industry, such as in Hermosillo and along the United States border. However, those municipalities with none of these economic advantages do not see population growth and some see population decreases. Despite population growth, Sonora is still one of the least densely populated states in the country. About 90% of the state&#x27;s population is Catholic, with about 5% belonging to Evangelical or Protestant groups and over 7% professing some other faith.

The 1921 census reported Sonora&#x27;s population as 55.84% white, 30.38% mixed indigenous and white, and 13.78% indigenous.

According to the 2020 Census, 1.48% of Sonora&#x27;s population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent.

===Indigenous population===

The most numerous indigenous groups in the state are the Mayo, the Yaquis and the Seris; however, there are a number of other groups which have maintained much of their way of life in territory in which they have lived for centuries. There were at least nine tribes, eight of which remain today. Seven are indigenous to Sonora, with one migrating to the state over a century ago from the United States. These cultures generally hold in reverence the deserts, mountains, riverbeds and Gulf of California with which they have contact. Many of these beliefs have been adapted to Catholicism. There are efforts to preserve indigenous languages, but with groups of diminished size, this has been a challenge. As of 2000, there were 55,609 people, or 2.85% of the population, who spoke an indigenous language in the state. The indigenous population is concentrated in fourteen municipalities, which are home to 91% of the total indigenous population of the state. The municipalities with the greatest presence include Etchojoa with 19% of the municipal population, Guaymas with 8.34%, Huatabampo with 11.8%, Navojoa with 5.92%, Hermosillo with 1.1%, Cajeme with 1%, Bácum with 9.26%, Benito Juárez with 5.2%, San Ignacio Río Muerto with 7.4%, Nogales with 1.2%, Álamos with 3.9%, San Miguel de Horcasitas with 13.7%, Yécora with 6.8% and San Luis Río Colorado with 5.1%.
The Mayos are the most numerous indigenous ethnic group in the state with more than 75,000 who have maintained their language and traditions. These people, who call themselves Yoreme, are descended from ancient Huatabampo culture. They are concentrated along the Mayo River. Most are found in the municipalities of Álamos, Quiriego and others in the south of the state, as well as in some parts of the coast near the Isla Tiburón. There is also a notable community in the northwest of Sonora. Their religion is a mix of Catholicism and traditional beliefs, which they assimilated along with European farming and livestock knowledge. Mayo houses often have a cross made of ironwood to protect against evil. Ethnically pure Mayos tend to segregate themselves from mestizos and other ethnicities. The Mayos make their living from subsistence farming, working on larger farms and combing wild area for herbs, fruits and other resources. They also work making crafts in wood, making utensils and decorative items.

The Yaquis are the indigenous group mostly closely associated with the state of Sonora. These people are second most numerous in the state with about 33,000 members traditionally located along the Yaqui River. They are found principally in the communities of , , , Cocorit, Bácum, Vícam, Rahúm and Belem, which have semi autonomous government. The Yaqui have been able to maintain most of their traditions including ancestor worship, original language, and many of their traditional rites and dances, with the deer dance the best known among outsiders. The Yaquis call themselves and the Mayos the &quot;Yoreme&quot; or &quot;Yoeme&quot;. The Yaqui and Mayo languages are mutually intelligible, and the two peoples are believed to have been united until relatively recently. One of the Yaqui religious celebrations which is best known among outsiders is Holy Week, along with rituals associated with Lent and Day of the Dead. As they consider the soul immortal, funerals are not a somber occasion but rather celebrations with banquets and music. The preservation of history is important to the Yaqui, especially the struggles they have had to maintain their independence.

The Seris call themselves the Comcáac, which means &quot;the people&quot; in the Seri language. The name Seri comes from the Opata language and means &quot;men of sand&quot;. There are about 650 Seri people today. They are well known among outsiders in the state because of their culture and the crafts they produce in ironwood. For centuries they have inhabited the central coast of the state, especially in Punta Chueca, El Desemboque and Kino Viejo as well as a number of islands in the Gulf of California in and around the Isla Tiburón. Generally, the Seris are the tallest of the indigenous peoples of the region, and the first Spaniards to encounter them described them as &quot;giants&quot;. Their traditional diet almost entirely consisted of hunted animals and fish. However, this diet changed after the arrival of the Spaniards, when the use of firearms led to the extinction of many food animals. The Seris&#x27; traditional beliefs are based on the animals in their environment, especially the pelican and the turtle, with the sun and moon playing important roles as well. Rituals are now based on Catholicism, especially those related to birth, puberty and death, but they include traditional chants about the power of the sea, the shark and great deeds of the past. They are also known for the use of face paint during rituals which is applied in lines and dots of various colors.
The Tohono O&#x27;odham, still referred to as the Pápago by Spanish speakers, have inhabited the most arid areas of the state, and are mostly found in Caborca, Puerto Peñasco, Sáric, Altar and Plutarco Elías Calles in the north of the state. However, most people of this ethnicity now live in neighboring Arizona. The Tohono O&#x27;odham have as a principal deity the &quot;Older Brother&quot;, who dominates the forces of nature. Among their most important rituals is one called the Vikita, which occurs in July, with dances and song to encourage rainfall during the area&#x27;s short rainy season. In July, during the full moon, a dance called the Cu-cu is performed, which is to ask for favors from Mother Nature so that there will be no drought and the later harvests will be abundant. The dance is performed during a large festival with brings together not only the Tohono O&#x27;odham from Sonora, but from Arizona and California as well. The feast day of Francis of Assisi is also important. Many of these people are known as skilled carpenters, making furniture as well as delicate figures of wood. There are also craftspeople who make ceramics and baskets, especially a type of basket called a &quot;corita&quot;..

The Opatas are location in a number of communities in the center and northwest of the state, but have been disappearing as a distinct ethnicity. This group has lost its traditional rituals, and the language died out in the 1950s. The name means &quot;hostile people&quot; and was given to them by the Pimas, as the Opatas were generally in conflict with their neighbors. They were especially hostile to the Tohono O&#x27;odham, who they depreciatingly refer to as the Papawi O&#x27;otham, or &quot;bean people&quot;. Today&#x27;s Opatas have completely adopted the Catholic religion with Isidore the Laboror as the ethnicity&#x27;s patron saint.

The Pimas occupy the mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental in eastern Sonora and western Chihuahua state. The Pimas call themselves the O&#x27;ob, which means &quot;the people&quot;. The name Pima was given to them by the Spaniards because the word &quot;pima&quot; would be said in response to most questions asked to them in Spanish. This word roughly means &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t understand.&quot; The traditional territory of this ethnicity is known as the Pimería, and it is divided into two regions: the Pimería Alta and the Pimería Baja. The principal Pima community in Sonora is in , with other communities in Yécora and its vicinity as well as the community of San Diego, where there is a center selling Pima handcrafts. Pima religion is a mix of traditional beliefs and Catholicism. One of the most important celebrations is the feast of Francis of Assisi, who has been adopted as the patron saint of the Pima. Another important festival is called the Yúmare, which has a variable date with the purpose of asking for an abundant harvest, especially corn. Festivals generally last four days and consist of chants and dances such as the Pascola, accompanies by a fermented corn drink called tesgüino.

The Guarijíos are one of the least understood groups in the state, and are mostly restricted to an area called the Mesa del Matapaco in the southeast. The Guarijíos are related to the Tarahumaras and the Cáhitas. This was the first group encountered by the Jesuits in 1620. Initially, they lived in the area around what is now Álamos, but when the Spaniards arrived, they were dispossessed of their lands. They also did not intermarry with the newcomers, isolating themselves. For this reason, people of this group have very distinct facial features, and have kept their traditions almost completely intact. They remain isolated but are known for their handcrafts. In the 1970s, there was oppression of this group, which was not formally recognized until 1976. In this year, they were granted an ejido.

The Cocopah is the smallest native indigenous group to Sonora with about 170 members, who live mostly in San Luis Río Colorado, along the United States border, in addition to nearby communities in Arizona and Baja California. Their own name for themselves, Kuapak, means &quot;which comes&quot; and possibly refers to the frequent changes in the course of the Colorado River. Traditional native dress is in disuse. It is characterized by the use of feathers and necklaces made of bones, and includes nose rings and earrings with colorful belts for the men. The women used to wear skirts made of feathers. They still practice a number of traditional rituals such as cremation upon death so that the soul can pass on to the afterlife without the body encumbering it. Another traditional practice is the use of tattoos.

The Kickapoos are not native to Sonora, but migrated here from the United States over a century ago. Today, they are found in the communities of El Nacimiento in the state of Coahuila, Tamichopa in the municipality of Bacerac, as well as on several different reservations in the United States. However, the Kickapoo community in Sonora is in danger of disappearing. In the 1980s, there were attempts to gather these disparate groups into one community. Eighty members remain in Sonora and they have lost their ancestral language, which was part of the Algonquin family, with the last speaker dying in 1996, although the language is still widely spoken in other Kickapoo communities, especially in Coahuila. The Kickapoo community in Sonora has also lost much of their traditional culture.

==Economy==

===General profile===

Despite a rough terrain and a harsh climate, Sonora, like the rest of northern Mexico, is rich in mineral resources. This has led to a history of self-reliance, and many see themselves as the heirs to a pioneering tradition. A large part of this is linked to the vaquero or cowboy tradition, as much of the state&#x27;s economy has traditionally been linked to livestock. Sonorans and other &quot;norteños&quot; (northerners) have a reputation for being hard-working and frugal, and being more individualistic and straightforward than other Mexicans. Although most people in the state are employed in industry and tourism, the trappings of the cowboy, jeans, cowboy hats and pickup trucks, are still very popular.

In 2000, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was 40,457 million pesos, accounting for 2.74% of the country&#x27;s total. In 2008, Moody&#x27;s Investor&#x27;s Service gave the state an A1.mx (Mexico) and Ba1 (global) ratings, based mostly on its strong economic base. The state has a highly skilled labor force, and strong ties to the United States economy, mostly due to its shared border with Arizona. This link affects various sectors of the state&#x27;s economy. Sonora is one of Mexico&#x27;s wealthier states with the GDP per capita about 15% higher than average, and GDP growth generally outpaces the rest of the country, with a growth of 8.4% in 2006 as compared to the national average of 4.8%. The economic success of the state, especially its industrial and agricultural sectors, as well as the border, have attracted large numbers of migrants to the state, from the central and southern parts of Mexico.

===Agriculture and livestock===
Agriculture is the most important economic activity in the state, mostly with the production of grains. The major agricultural regions include the Yaqui Valley, the Mayo Valley, the Guaymas Valley, the coast near Hermosillo, the Caborca coast and the San Luis Río Colorado Valley. These areas permit for large scale irrigation to produce large quantities of crops such as wheat, potatoes, watermelons, cotton, corn, melons, sorghum, chickpeas, grapes, alfalfa, oranges and more. In 2002, agricultural production included of wheat, of potatoes, of wine grapes (both red and white), of alfalfa, of oranges and of watermelon. Sonora and Baja California Norte are Mexico&#x27;s two largest wheat-producing states, with Sonora alone producing 40% of Mexico&#x27;s wheat.

There is some small-scale farming done in the state, especially in the highland areas, where farmers grow corn and other staples mostly for self-consumption; this unirrigated agriculture is highly dependent on the late-summer rainy season, as failure will result from the lack of rain. However, most of the agriculture continues to shift away from small farms producing for local markets to largescale commercial agro-industry. Many of the country&#x27;s largest agribusiness farms are located in Sonora. This agricultural production is concentrated in the lowlands areas, with much of the production exported to the United States. This includes non-traditional crops such as fruits, nuts and winter vegetables such as tomatoes, especially since NAFTA.

Irrigation is essential for reliable agriculture on the coastal lowlands of the state, and large-scale irrigation infrastruction is needed for large-scale production. After the Mexican Revolution, the federal government took control of Sonora&#x27;s irrigation infrastructure and after World War II, began extensive dam and reservoir construction. From the 1940s to the 1970s, advanced in agricultural techniques were pioneered by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) based in Ciudad Obregón. This combined new varieties of wheat, with irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides to greatly increase production. Mexico went from a wheat importer in the 1940s to a wheat exporter in the 1960s.

However, such intensive agriculture in such an arid area has had a significant negative impact on water supplies. Eighty-eight percent of all water taken from above and below the surface is used for agriculture. One third of aquifers are overdrafted, especially in Caborca, Guaymas, and the coast near Hermosillo. There have been water disputes in the state, notably between officials from Hermosillo and the relatively water-rich Ciudad Obregón. The overpumping has drastically lowered water tables and has increased soil salinity in many areas. In some areas, the tables have dropped by as much as one or two meters per year, making fresh water increasingly unavailable and forcing the abandonment of croplands. For this reason, the area under cultivation dropped by more than 24% during the last quarter of the 20th century.

The state still maintains its traditional livestock industry, especially in beef cattle, which has a national reputation for quality. In 2001, the state produced 1,477,686 heads of cattle, 1,229,297 pigs, 38,933 sheep, 33,033 goats, 83,260 horses and 11,988,552 heads of domestic fowl. The availability of relatively inexpensive semiarid land, along with proximity to United States markets, concentrates livestock production in Sonora and other northern states.

===Fishing===
Sonora is a major producer of seafood in Mexico with a developed fishing infrastructure. The Gulf of California contains a large quantity of fish and shellfish, but major fishing did not begin in Sonora and neighboring Sinaloa until the mid 20th century. Today, some of Mexico&#x27;s largest commercial fisheries are in the state. Sonora is one of Mexico&#x27;s leading fish producing states, with 70% of Mexico&#x27;s total coming from the Pacific coast, including the Gulf of California.

Much of the catch is shrimp and sardines, with about three quarters exported to the United States. In 2002, the catch totaled 456,805 tons of seafood with a value of about 2,031 million pesos. In addition to what is caught at sea, there is active fish farming which raises mostly oysters and shrimp. Much of the commercial and sports fishing is essentially unregulated and has had a very pronounced impact on the Gulf of California, with commercially important species such as shrimp, groupers, snappers, corvinas, yellowtail, billfishes have been harvested well above sustainability. Two species that have been particularly hard hit are sharks and manta rays. In addition, shrimp trawling catches a large amount of non-target species, which are discarded, and have destroyed large areas of the Gulf&#x27;s seafloor. All this has led to rapidly declining harvests.

===Industry and mining===

Most of the industry of the state is related to agriculture and fishing, in food processing and packing. In the 1980s, the state gained a large number of industrial plants called &quot;maquiladoras&quot;, mostly situated along the border and in the capital of Hermosillo. These are assembly plants run by mostly United States companies, which have certain duty and tax breaks. By the end of the 20th century, these enterprises had a large influence on the expansion and modernization of the border area, including Sonora. They not only introduced new sources of employment, but their United States management styles have also had influence on business in the state and the rest of the north. However, maquiladoras peaked in 2001, and now many United States companies are moving production facilities to China. The number of maquiladoras has declined, but the value of their output has increased as those that remain shift to higher value-added goods and automation. In addition, many of the plants abandoned by United States companies have been taken over by Mexican firms. Despite the decline of maquiladoras, exports from them have risen 40%.

In addition to livestock, mining is another traditional element of Sonora&#x27;s economy, beginning with a major find near the city of Álamos. While the silver of that area has mostly been depleted, Sonora still plays a large part in Mexico&#x27;s standing as one of the top fifteen producers of minerals in the world, leading in silver, celestite and bismuth. Sonora is the leading producer of gold, copper, graphite, molybdenum, and wollastonite. There are still deposits of silver in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Sonora also has one of the largest coal reserves in the country. The state has the largest mining surface in Mexico, and three of the country&#x27;s largest mines: La Caridad, Cananea and Mineria María. It is also home to North America&#x27;s oldest copper mine, located in Cananea. Grupo México, with one of its principal mining operations in Cananea, is the world&#x27;s third-largest copper producer. In 2002, mines produced 6,634.5 kilograms of gold, 153,834 kilograms of silver, five tons of lead, 267,171 tons of copper, three tons of zinc, 18,961 tons of iron, 7,176 tons barium sulphate. However, annual production is heavily dependent on world market prices. A large lithium open pit mine is under construction at La Ventana.

Mexico&#x27;s mining industry was mostly dominated by the Spaniards during the colonial period, and then by foreign enterprises after Independence. In the 1960s and 1970s, the government forced out most foreign interests in Mexican mining, beginning with the increasing restriction of ownership in Mexican mining companies. These restrictions were relaxed starting in 1992, with the only restriction that the operating company be Mexican. Within three years of the change, more than seventy foreign companies, mostly United States and Canadian enterprises, opened offices in Hermosillo.

Major mining operations have had severe environmental impact, especially in the areas surrounding it, with Cananea as the primary example. Mining has been functioning here for over a century, with mining and smelter wastes polluting the San Pedro and Sonora Rivers near the mine, threatening both watersheds. Mining operations also destroy nearby forests due to the demand for building materials and fuel. Few old trees stand near the city of Cananea and the town of San Javier in central Sonora.

===Tourism===
Business and leisure visitors to the state primarily come from Mexico (over 60%), with the majority of foreign visitors coming from the United States, especially the states of Arizona, California and New Mexico. The four most important destinations in the state for leisure and business travelers include Nogales, Hermosillo, Guaymas and Puerto Peñasco, with beach destinations preferred by most leisure travelers. One advantage that Sonora has is its proximity to the United States, from which come most of the world&#x27;s travelers. In second place are tourists from Canada, many of whom visit as part of cruises. United States tourists mostly visit Puerto Peñasco, San Carlos and Navajoa and prefer areas they consider friendly, with no &quot;anti-U.S.&quot; sentiment. Leisure visitors from the United States tend to be between 40 and 65 years of age, married or in a relationship, educated at the university level or higher, with about thirty days of vacation time, and they primarily research travel options on the Internet. Most visit to relax and experience another culture. Most domestic visitors also use the Internet, with about half having a university education or higher and about half are married or with a partner. Most domestic visitors are on vacation with their families. The busiest domestic travel times are Holy Week, summer and Christmas, with the overall busiest months being January, April, July, August and December.

In 2009, the state received more than seven million visitors, who spent more than 20 billion pesos to the economy. Most visitors are domestic and spend an average of 742 pesos. Foreign visitors spend an average of 1,105 pesos. Most stay on average 3.3 nights. Just over half of tourists in the state arrive to their destinations by private automobile, followed by airplane and commercial bus.

During the 2000s, Sonora has increased its tourism infrastructure. In the last half of the 2000s, Sonora has increased its network of highways from to , accounting for 6.7% of all highways in Mexico. It ranks second in four-lane highways, surpassed only by Chihuahua. From 2003 to 2009 the number of hotels in the state has increased from 321 to 410 and the number of rooms from 13,226 to 15,806, over 20%. Most of these hotels and rooms are in Hermosillo (57 hotels/3232 rooms) followed by Puerto Peñasco (40/3158), Ciudad Obregón (41/1671), Guaymas/San Carlos (28/1590), Nogales (24/1185), Navojoa (15/637) and Magdalena de Kino (10/284). The cities of Hermosillo, Ciudad Obregón, Guaymas, Nogales, San Luis Río Colorado, Puerto Peñasco, Bahía Kino and Álamos all have 5-star hotels. There are 2,577 restaurants in the state with 1288 in Hermosillo.

Hotel occupation went from 45% in 2003 to 57.7% in 2006 but dropped to 36% in 2009. The state&#x27;s tourism suffered in 2008 and 2009, mostly due to the economic downturn and the H1N1 &quot;swine flu&quot; influenza crisis, which brought hotel occupancy rates down about 30%.

Sonora&#x27;s major tourist attraction is its beaches, especially San Carlos, Puerto Peñasco, Bahía Kino and the Gulf of Santa Clara in San Luis Río Colorado. San Carlos has a large variety of sea life off its shores, making it popular for sports fishing and scuba diving. One of its main attractions is the Playa de los Algodones, called such because its sand dunes look like cotton balls. On one of hills behind it, there is a lookout point which allows for views of the area. A number of Yaquis, Seris and Guaimas on and around the Tetakawi Hill, making a living from fishing. Puerto Peñasco has recently experienced large-scale development along its of beaches, which have calm seas. It is located in the extreme northwest of the state. Some of the available activities include jet skiing, boating, sailing, sports fishing, scuba diving and snorkeling. It is located near El Pinacate biosphere reserve. There is also an aquarium called the Acuario de Cer-Mar, which is a research center open to the public. The aquarium has a number of species such as marine turtles, octopuses, seahorses and many varieties of fish. Bahía Kino is named after the Jesuit missionary, who visited the area in the 17th century. In the 1930s, a group of fishermen established a village in what is now known as Kino Viejo. This bay&#x27;s beaches have white sand, with warm calm waters off of them. For this reason, Kino Viejo calls itself &quot;la perla del Mar de Cortés&quot; (the pearl of the Gulf of California). Available activities include horseback riding, scuba diving and sports fishing. The Isla Tiburón is from Bahia Kino in the Gulf of California. It is the largest island of Mexico, measuring . It has been declared an ecological reserve to protect its flora and fauna, such as the wild rams and deer that live here.
To enhance tourism in areas away from the primary beaches, the state of Sonora has set up several tourist routes for promotion as well as gained &quot;Pueblo Mágico&quot; status for one of its smaller cities. The Ruta de las Missiones (&quot;Missions Route&quot;) covers the principle stops of Jesuit missionary Eusebio Kino, as the worked to establish the many religious institutions which are part of the state&#x27;s identity. These include the churches and missions in Caborca, Pitiquito, Oquitoa, Átil, Tubutama, Imuris, Cucurpe and Magdalena. In Magdalena, Father Kino remains are at the Padre Kino mausoleum. The Ruta del Río (River Route) follows a seriers of villages and towns along the Sonora River. The state recommends this route in the fall when the chili pepper and peanut harvest occurs. The route includes the settlements of Ures, Baviácora, Aconchi, San Felipe de Jesús, Huépac, Banámichi, Arizpe, Bacoachi and Cananea. The Ruta de la Sierra Alta (&quot;High Mountain Route&quot;) winds its way through the highlands of the Sierra Madre Occidental to see the significant peaks and towns of the area. Destinations include the towns Moctezuma, Villa Hidalgo, Huásabas, Granados, Huachinera, Bavispe, Nácori Chico, Fronteras, Nacozari and Cumpas, which have other attractions such as old haciendas, streams, forests and other forms of nature.
The Ruta Sierra Mar (&quot;Mountain Sea Route&quot;) is located in the south of the state among the towns around Álamos, Navojoa and Huatabampo, which contain a large number of colonial-era constructions. Attractions include the above-mentioned cities along with the Adolfo Ruiz Cortínez, Tetajiosa and El Venadito dams and the town of Etchojoa, which are surrounded by areas of desert and areas with tropical vegetation, around the Mayo River. The route begins in the mountains of Álamos and ends at the beaches of Huatabampo. Travelers can engage in a number of activities such as hunting, birdwatching, boating, kayaking and photography. The Ruta Yécora (Yécora Route) leaves from the capital of Hermosillo and makes its way to the town of Yécora, which is one of the highest communities in the mountains of the state. The Yécora area is known for its hunting and the area contains species that can only be found in this part of the state. From Hermosillo to Yécora, there are of highway, which pass through a number of towns and natural vistas. These include La Colorado mine, San José de Pima on the Mátape River, Tecoripa, San Javier which is surrounded by various hills, Tónichi, Ónavas, Tepoca, San Nicolás and the Mesa de Campanero forest.

Sonora has one Pueblo Mágico, which is Álamos, which was called Ostimuri by the native population. This town was founded in 1683, when a mineral deposit by the name of La Europea was discovered. The silver found here made it one of the richest towns in the region. The mines gave out in the 19th century and the town declined. Today, many of the old mansions and other buildings have been restored.

There are also a number of natural reserve areas that are open to visitors and promoted for tourism. These include El Pinacate in the Altar Desert and the Colorado Delta and Upper Gulf of California biosphere reserve. Both of these are near the major resort area of Puerto Peñasco and are some of the driest areas of Mexico.

===The border===
Much of the state&#x27;s economic activity is related to its border with the United States state of Arizona. People from both countries regularly cross the border to shop. The border crossings are essential to many of the communities that straddle the border, not only in the main crossings in Nogales and Agua Prieta, but also in the smaller ones such as Naco. On each side of the border, there is a fifteen km strip, which is designated as a commercial trade zone, where both Mexicans and United States citizens can enter with limited visa requirements. Many Arizonans travel and cross one of the crossings to eat and shop, mostly to experience something different from doing the same at home. Most spend only the day. The most popular of these border crossings is Nogales, which is just over an hour south from Tucson by highway. The main shopping street in Nogales is Avenida Obregón, which is crowded with pharmacies with lower prices than in the United States, stores selling knock offs of designer names such as Louis Vuitton, Cuban cigars, tequila, cheaper cigarettes and Mexican handcrafts, including some of the best work from artisans from Puebla, Guadalajara, Michoacán and Oaxaca. Although these stores cater mostly to Americans crossing the border, it is still possible to negotiate prices. Many of these communities on the Mexican side also have bars close to the port of entry, taking advantage of Mexico&#x27;s lower drinking age of 18.

The more important aspect of the border crossing is the commercial shipping that goes through, especially the Nogales port. There are two crossings at Nogales, one which connects the downtowns of the two cities, mostly for non-commercial traffic, and the Mariposa Port of Entry outside of the twin cities for trucks and commercial traffic. NAFTA increased cross border shipping. Counting traffic going both north and south, the Nogales port handles about three-quarters of all border crossing between Sonora and Arizona. Nogales is a major port of entry for Mexican agricultural products heading to the United States and Canada. In 2005, 268,163 commercial trucks moved through the port, up from 242,435 in 2004, handling about 7.6% of all United States-Mexico truck traffic. Most of the merchandise that passes through Sonora on its way to the United States winds up in western states such as Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Idaho and Montana, as well as into Canada.

The volume of traffic, along with new security measures which have been put into place since 2001, create traffic jams of trucks and other vehicles, especially during the winter when demand for products grown in Mexico&#x27;s warm climates peaks. These jams can result in lines about eight miles long. For trucks moving into Sonora and south, inspection stations at Vícam and near the Sinaloa border also cause delays. Delays in shipping cause more produce to rot before it can get to the consumer.

The last reason for the importance of the border is the maquiladora industries, which have made areas such as Nogales grow significantly. Many of Sonora&#x27;s incoming migrants from other parts of Mexico come to work at these factories.

===Handcrafts===

There are a number of different crafts made in the state, which are often distinguished by the use of certain materials and of certain designs. The best known of these is the carving of figures from ironwood (&quot;palo fierro&quot; in Spanish), which is a very dense, almost black wood that sinks in water. This wood was often used in braziers in the past because it would burn for a very long time. This carving is the specialty of the Yaquis and the Seris. Before it can be carved, this wood must be dried thoroughly, a process that can take up to five years. If this is not done, the wood takes on an ochre color, rather than its characteristic shiny near black. Objects made from this wood are almost always decorative in nature in a wide variety of shapes such as sahuaro and other cacti, eagles, turtles, dolphins and other flora and fauna of the state, along with crosses. The last is popular among indigenous groups as it is believed that such guard against the envy of others and other ills. Objects made of this wood are very much in demand on the international market, but indigenous craftsmen cannot compete with factory-made pieces.

The higher elevations of the state and riverbanks contain large quantities of trees. Aconchi is one of the villages of the state with a well-established tradition of making furniture, with almost forty workshops. Many of these are in rustic or colonial style. In Arizpe and Álamos, they specialize in a type of chair made by bending and combining long flexible branches of willow and &quot;guásima&quot; (Guazuma ulmifolia) In the town of Tubutama, they make clocks of mesquite wood.
Basketmaking is still widely practiced in the state, with hand-made wares available in local markets such as in Bahía Kino, Punta Chueca and El Desemboque. Those made near the ocean often have marine designs. Baskets made of reeds are made in Ures along with hats. In Aconchi, palm fronds are used to make hats and baskets called guaris, used for food storage. In various locations, a basket variety called &quot;caritas&quot; are made in a globe shape and have a lid. This is a specialty of the Seris. These are typically made by women, with small baskets taking a month to make. Larger ones can take up to two years. Most coritas are bought by foreigners as the work needed to create them makes them expensive.

Leather goods such as belts, shoes, jackets, wallets and more in made in locations such as Nácori Chico, Moctezuma, Pitiquito, Bacoachi, Banámichi, Huásbas, Arivechi and Ures. This craft is a result of the state&#x27;s history of cattle ranching. The mining industry gave rise to the working of metals, especially copper in Cananea. Items include pots, pans, plates and decorative items. Álamos is known for items made in brass and wrought iron.
Jewelry such as necklaces, bracelets and earrings are often made using materials from the sea such as various types of shells and spines from marine animals. This is a specialty in Puerto Peñasco and of the Seris. The latter also use materials such as the tails of rattlesnakes and animal teeth. Some of the Seris&#x27; best work is located in a museum in Bahia Kino. There is also jewelry, especially necklaces made with various seeds, small twigs and river stones. In Oquitoa, they made ceremonial crowns of glass in various colors. These are most often used to decorate the tombs of loved ones on Day of the Dead. The Yaquis make unique belts using the paws of deer as well as elaborate masks for ceremonies. However, these people generally do not commercialize their wares, with the exception of cloth dolls in local markets.

==Media==
Newspapers of Sonora include: &quot;El Gran Diario de Sonora Agua Prieta&quot;, &quot;El Gran Diario de Sonora Caborca&quot;, &quot;El Gran Diario de Sonora Hermosillo&quot;, &quot;El Gran Diario de Sonora Magdalena&quot;, &quot;El Gran Diario de Sonora Nogales&quot;, &quot;El Gran Diario de Sonora Puerto Peñasco&quot;, &quot;El Imparcial&quot;, &quot;El Informador del Mayo&quot;, &quot;Entorno Informativo&quot;, &quot;Expreso Hermosillo&quot;, &quot;La I Noticias para Mi Hermosillo&quot;, &quot;La Voz del Puerto&quot;, &quot;Tribuna (Sonora)&quot;, and &quot;Tribuna de San Luis.&quot;

==Culture==
The most prolific art of the state is literature, which includes poetry, novels, plays and essays. To promote the state&#x27;s talent, the state government sponsors a number of literary competitions, the most prestigious of which is the Libro de Sonora. It also sponsors scholarships to universities and other institutions. Important contemporary writers from the state include poet and playwright Abigael Bohórquez, novelist Gerardo Cornejo Murrieta, writer and musician Armando Zamora, writer and literary critic Ignacio Mondaca Romero, narrator César Gándara, essayist and journalist Eve Gil, short story and novel writer Sylvia Aguilar Zéleny and poet and novelist Iván Figueroa.

Eminent painters include Manuel Romo Rodríguez, Héctor Martínez Arteche and Mario Moreno Zazueta.

The major indigenous dances include the Deer Dance, the Pascola and the Matachines, which is mostly performed in Huatabampo. Herbal medicine is still widely practiced, especially in rural areas.

Musicians include waltz composer Rodolfo Campodónico, opera singer Alfonso Ortiz Tirado, Arturo Márquez and classical music composer Pedro Vega Granillo. And most prominently &quot;El Gallo De Oro&quot; Valentin Elizalde Valencia

The Orquesta Filharmonica de Sonora (Sonora Philharmonic Orchestra) is a state-sponsored institution that offers concerts in all of the entity&#x27;s major cities. Since its creation, it has been accompanied by artists such as Olivia Gorra, Carlos Prieto, Martha Félix, Felipe Chacón and Fernando de la Mora. It has also participated in numerous events such as the 23rd anniversary of Radio Sonora, the Noche de Arte at the ITESM Sonora campus, the Festival Tetabiakte and the Dr. Alfonso Ortiz Festival. There is also an organization for minors called the Orquesta Juvenil de Sonora.

The most important museums in the state are the Museo de Sonora, the Museo Costumbrista de Sonora, Museo Étnico de los Yaquis, Museo Étnico de los Seris, Museo de la Lucha Obrera, Museo de la Casa del General and the Museo del Niño la Burbuja, which are visited by over 180,000 people per year.

Since colonial times, much of the economy of the state has traditionally been linked to livestock, especially cattle, with &quot;vaqueros&quot;, or cowboys, being an important part of the state&#x27;s identity. Today, most are employed in industry and tourism, but the dress and folklore of the &quot;vaquero&quot; is still important. Jeans and cowboy hats are still extremely popular, especially with men. The cowboy lifestyle is associated with the pickup truck. This influence extends into popular music.

The most popular musical styles of the area is &quot;norteño&quot; (&quot;northern&quot;), which includes Banda. &quot;norteño&quot; music developed from the late 19th until the beginning of the 20th century, all along the borderlands of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, with the influence of waltz, polkas, mazurkas and corridos. One important instrument for the genre is the accordion, introduced to the area by German immigrants. Sonoran versions of this music developed from the 1920s to the 1960s. Many of the best known early works have anonymous composers. In the 1950s, with the widespread use of radio, the popularity of the genre rose as the &quot;norteño&quot; music of Nuevo León, Durango and other states were heard. These versions often included music written by Sonoran composers such as Amor de Madre by Jesús &quot;El Chito&quot; Peralta, Cuatro Milpas, Mundo Engañoso, El Venadito, La Higuerita and El Tarachi by Aristeo Silvas Antúnez and La Barca de Guaymas by José López Portillo. The music especially resonated with youth which worked in fields and on ranches.

The first formal &quot;norteño&quot; group from Sonora was Los Cuatreros de Sonora, formed by the Carvajal brothers. In contrast to bands from other states, which were duets, Sonoran bands were trios before becoming quartets and quintets with the addition of more musical instruments. Lyrics most often deal with the important moments of everyday life which are celebrated and embellished. Only recently has &quot;norteño&quot; music been accepted by social classes outside those with which it developed. &quot;Norteño&quot; groups of Sonora, often referred to as &quot;taca-tacas&quot;, can now be heard at social events at all socioeconomic levels.

===Archeology===

The region has been an area of study for archeologists, anthropologists and historians, who have worked on prehispanic ruins and fossilized bones. However, much of the research in this area is still in its initial descriptive stage with many basic questions still unanswered. Sonora is considered a cultural zone separate from Mesoamerica, although there may have been some Mesoamerican influence. The major differences between Sonoran cultures and Mesoamerica include dry climate farming, although the same basics of corn, squash and beans are produced. There is also a heavier reliance on wild resources. More important was the lack of true cities during this area&#x27;s prehispanic history, with small settlements clustered around water sources and weak hierarchical systems. The cultures here also share some traits with those of the United States Southwest, but are distinct from these as well.

The Cerro de Trincheras (&quot;Trench Hill&quot;) is an archeological site, with petroglyphs, plazas and astronomical observatories. The exact purpose of the area has been disputed, but the area reached its height between 1300 and 1450 CE, when it had a population of about 1,000, which made its living growing corn, squash, cotton and agave. Its largest structure is called La Cancha (&quot;The Ballcourt&quot;), which is at the base of the north side of the hill. It is a rectangular patio marked by rocks piled on its edges, measuring . Some researchers believe it was some kind of ball court and others believe it was a kind of open-air theater. On the hill itself is an observatory, which gives views of the area. Most of the area&#x27;s artifacts of stone and shell were found here. The Plaza de Caracol (Snail Plaza) is marked by a meter and a half high stone wall in an open spiral, most likely used for ceremonies.

===Gastronomy===

As in other parts of Mexico, Sonoran cuisine is basically a mixture of indigenous and Spanish influences. When the Spaniards moved north from the Mexico City area, they found that the diet of the area was simpler, with the basics of corn, beans and squash, but without the further variety as existed in the lusher south. The Spaniards had a great impact on the diet of the region. They brought European staples of wheat, beef, dairy products, pork and more, as well as dishes and ingredients from the center and south of Mexico, such as tortillas, more varieties of chile peppers and tamales. The cowboy/&quot;vaquero&quot; culture has been an important aspect of Sonora&#x27;s culture since the colonial period and much of the cuisine is based on what cowboys ate on the range, even though most Sonorans no longer work outdoors. Sonoran cuisine is not limited to the present state. Arizona, especially in southern border area, has a cuisine that is also heavy on wheat, cheese and beef introduced by the Spaniards, back when the area was part of Sonora. Both states continue the cowboy tradition. Because Sonora is a border state, its cuisine has received significant influence from the United States as well.

Two important staples in the diet are seafood and beef, the latter playing a larger role in the cuisine of Sonora than in the rest of Mexico. Beef is often cooked over an open flame, and Sonorans prefer robust cuts such as brisket and skirt steak. Machaca, or &quot;carne seca&quot;, is still enjoyed, although refrigeration has eliminated the need to dry meat. Sonora also has a reputation for producing fine cuts of beef, but the lean Spanish cattle of the colonial period have been replaced by Angus, Herefords and Holsteins. Dishes based on or usually containing beef include &quot;carne desebrada&quot;, &quot;carne con rajas verdes&quot;, burritos, &quot;carne con chile colorado&quot;, beef &quot;chorizo&quot;, &quot;carne seca&quot;, machaca, &quot;menudo&quot;, &quot;gorditas&quot; and meatballs. Seafood is an important staple, especially along the coast as there is a large variety of fish and shellfish in the Gulf of California. Seafood is generally cooked in very simple dishes, such as fish tacos, seafood soups, rice with shrimp or squid and shrimp meatballs. Favored fish include cabrilla, flounder, marlin, sardines, manta rays and various types of jacks.

Tortillas are the base of the diet, but they are made from wheat, rather than corn. In Sonora, these tortillas are much larger than those prepared elsewhere and paper thin. Dairy products are common in dishes with chile peppers playing a smaller role. However, one important native chile pepper is the &quot;chiltepín&quot; (&quot;Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum&quot;), which people continue to harvest wild in the mountains of northwestern Mexico. In a dry year, about can be harvested in Sonora, with as much as during a wet year.

The cuisine contains a number of soups and stews, which combine native ingredients with Mexico-wide staples of beef, pork and corn. Seafood soups are popular along the coast. These dishes include &quot;pozole de trigo&quot;, &quot;pozole de res&quot;, &quot;menudo con pata&quot;, &quot;verdolagas&quot; (&quot;Portulaca oleracea&quot;) broth, &quot;sopa de elote&quot;, &quot;caldo de calabazas&quot; and &quot;sopa de camarón&quot;. Tamales are made with cornmeal dough and fillings such as beans, vegetables, potatoes, &quot;chile colorado&quot; and other ingredients, wrapped in dried corn husks and steamed. Tamale fillings vary in the state but the most popular include fresh corn with cream, green chile strips with cheese, beef with &quot;chile colorado&quot; and seafood.

The various cultures that have come through the state have influenced the development of breads, desserts and sweets. Most sweets are made from cow&#x27;s milk, sugar cane, peanuts, rice, nuts, sesame seeds and piloncillo. These include &quot;pipitoria&quot;, &quot;jamoncillo&quot;, &quot;cubierto de viznaga&quot;, &quot;cubiertos de calabaza&quot;, &quot;cubiertos de camote&quot;, squash in honey, &quot;piloncillo&quot;, &quot;pitahaya&quot; ice cream, crystallized oranges and limes, cakes made from corn and rice pudding.

Bacanora is a local liquor that has been made for decades in the town of the same name, located in the center of the state. Its base is an agave plant (&quot;agave lechuguilla&quot; or &quot;agave angustifolia&quot;) like mezcal and tequila, and it comes in various styles including aged. It has a distinct flavor. It is estimated that half a million plants are harvested from the wilds to make this beverage each year, leading to concerns of overexploitation.

==Education==
Public education is offered from preschool to university level studies. Development of the educational system has lowered the rates of illiteracy. The state has 1,475 preschools, 1,847 primary schools, 623 middle schools, 92 technical high schools and 203 high schools. Sonora sponsors a number of scholarships for low income students through the Instituto de Crédito Educativo del Estado de Sonora. and it also sponsors scholarships for students in the arts.

The main public institution of higher education in the state is the Universidad de Sonora, whose main campus is in Hermosillo. Founded in 1938 by state decree, the university has grown while retaining its identity. In 1953, students and professors were given more say in operations. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, there were occasional student protests which disrupted operations. In 1973, the institution undertook reorganization in response to the student strikes. The instuition offers degrees in over forty specialities through six divisions. Masters and doctorates are mostly offered in science and technology.

The Instituto Tecnológico de Sonora (ITSON, Sonora Technology Institute) has about 17,000 students and offers twenty-three bachelor&#x27;s degrees, eight masters programs, and three doctorate programs among its six campuses. The institution was formed through the initiative of the Cajemense Society in Ciudad Obregón in 1955, but received its current name in 1962. Originally it was a technical training school, but it was reorganized as a university in 1973. Today, it is the largest technological institution in the state.

==Transportation==

Sonora lies on the corridor which has connected the central Mexican highlands (Mexico City) north into the United States along the Pacific Coast at least since the colonial period, and there is evidence this corridor existed in the pre-Hispanic period as well. Today, it is still a major corridor for travel and shipping, with rail lines and Federal Highway 15 following it. The state contains a total of 24,396 km of highways. Rail lines mostly consist of those which lead into the United States. The major commercial port is in Guaymas, with smaller ones, mostly for tourism located in San Carlos, Puerto Peñasco and Bahia Kino. The state has four airports in the cities of Hermosillo, Puerto Peñasco, Ciudad Obregón and Nogales. These airports connect the state with 112 other locations both in Mexico and abroad. Airlines that operate out of them have included Aeromexico, Volaris, Interjet, and Vivaaerobus.

<doc id="83754" wikidata="Q165800" url="?curid=83754" title="Geocentric model">
<text>In astronomy, the geocentric model (also known as geocentrism, often exemplified specifically by the Ptolemaic system) is a superseded description of the Universe with Earth at the center. Under most geocentric models, the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets all orbit Earth. The geocentric model was the predominant description of the cosmos in many European ancient civilizations, such as those of Aristotle in Classical Greece and Ptolemy in Roman Egypt, as well as during the Islamic Golden Age.

Two observations supported the idea that Earth was the center of the Universe. First, from anywhere on Earth, the Sun appears to revolve around Earth once per day. While the Moon and the planets have their own motions, they also appear to revolve around Earth about once per day. The stars appeared to be fixed on a celestial sphere rotating once each day about an axis through the geographic poles of Earth. Second, Earth seems to be unmoving from the perspective of an earthbound observer; it feels solid, stable, and stationary.

Ancient Greek, ancient Roman, and medieval philosophers usually combined the geocentric model with a spherical Earth, in contrast to the older flat-Earth model implied in some mythology. However, the Greek astronomer and mathematician Aristarchus of Samos () developed a heliocentric model placing all of the then-known planets in their correct order around the Sun. The ancient Greeks believed that the motions of the planets were circular, a view that was not challenged in Western culture until the 17th century, when Johannes Kepler postulated that orbits were heliocentric and elliptical (Kepler&#x27;s first law of planetary motion). In 1687, Isaac Newton showed that elliptical orbits could be derived from his laws of gravitation.

The astronomical predictions of Ptolemy&#x27;s geocentric model, developed in the 2nd century CE, served as the basis for preparing astrological and astronomical charts for over 1,500 years. The geocentric model held sway into the early modern age, but from the late 16th century onward, it was gradually superseded by the heliocentric model of Copernicus (1473–1543), Galileo (1564–1642), and Kepler (1571–1630). There was much resistance to the transition between these two theories, since for a long time the geocentric postulate produced more accurate results. Additionally some felt that a new, unknown theory could not subvert an accepted consensus for geocentrism.

==Ancient Greece==
In the 6th century BC, Anaximander proposed a cosmology in which Earth is shaped like a section of a pillar (a cylinder), held aloft at the center of everything. The Sun, Moon, and planets were holes in invisible wheels which surround Earth, and through those holes, humans could see concealed fire. At around the same time, Pythagoras thought that Earth was a sphere (in accordance with observations of eclipses), but not at the center; he believed that it was in motion around an unseen fire. Later these two concepts were combined, so that most of the educated Greeks from the 4th century BC onwards thought that Earth was a sphere at the center of the universe.

In the 4th century BC Plato and his student Aristotle, wrote works based on the geocentric model. According to Plato, the Earth was a sphere, stationary at the center of the universe. The stars and planets were carried around the Earth on spheres or circles, arranged in the order (outwards from the center): Moon, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, fixed stars, with the fixed stars located on the celestial sphere. In his &quot;Myth of Er&quot;, a section of the &quot;Republic&quot;, Plato describes the cosmos as the Spindle of Necessity, attended by the Sirens and turned by the three Fates. Eudoxus of Cnidus, who worked with Plato, developed a less mythical, more mathematical explanation of the planets&#x27; motion based on Plato&#x27;s dictum stating that all phenomena in the heavens can be explained with uniform circular motion. Aristotle elaborated on Eudoxus&#x27; system.

In the fully developed Aristotelian system, the spherical Earth is at the center of the universe, and all other heavenly bodies are attached to 47–55 transparent, rotating spheres surrounding the Earth, all concentric with it. (The number is so high because several spheres are needed for each planet.) These spheres, known as crystalline spheres, all moved at different uniform speeds to create the revolution of bodies around the Earth. They were composed of an incorruptible substance called aether. Aristotle believed that the Moon was in the innermost sphere and therefore touches the realm of Earth, causing the dark spots (maculae) and the ability to go through lunar phases. He further described his system by explaining the natural tendencies of the terrestrial elements: earth, water, fire, air, as well as celestial aether. His system held that earth was the heaviest element, with the strongest movement towards the center, thus water formed a layer surrounding the sphere of Earth. The tendency of air and fire, on the other hand, was to move upwards, away from the center, with fire being lighter than air. Beyond the layer of fire, were the solid spheres of aether in which the celestial bodies were embedded. They were also entirely composed of aether.

Adherence to the geocentric model stemmed largely from several important observations. First of all, if the Earth did move, then one ought to be able to observe the shifting of the fixed stars due to stellar parallax. Thus if the Earth was moving, the shapes of the constellations should change considerably over the course of a year. As they did not appear to move, either the stars are much farther away than the Sun and the planets than previously conceived, making their motion undetectable, or the Earth is not moving at all. Because the stars are actually much further away than Greek astronomers postulated (making angular movement extremely small), stellar parallax was not detected until the 19th century. Therefore, the Greeks chose the simpler of the two explanations. Another observation used in favor of the geocentric model at the time was the apparent consistency of Venus&#x27; luminosity, which implies that it is usually about the same distance from Earth, which in turn is more consistent with geocentrism than heliocentrism. (In fact, Venus&#x27; luminous consistency is due to any loss of light caused by its phases being compensated for by an increase in apparent size caused by its varying distance from Earth.) Objectors to heliocentrism noted that terrestrial bodies naturally tend to come to rest as near as possible to the center of the Earth. Further, barring the opportunity to fall closer the center, terrestrial bodies tend not to move unless forced by an outside object, or transformed to a different element by heat or moisture.

Atmospheric explanations for many phenomena were preferred because the Eudoxan–Aristotelian model based on perfectly concentric spheres was not intended to explain changes in the brightness of the planets due to a change in distance. Eventually, perfectly concentric spheres were abandoned as it was impossible to develop a sufficiently accurate model under that ideal, with the mathematical methods then available. However, while providing for similar explanations, the later deferent and epicycle model was already flexible enough to accommodate observations.

==Ptolemaic model==

Although the basic tenets of Greek geocentrism were established by the time of Aristotle, the details of his system did not become standard. The Ptolemaic system, developed by the Hellenistic astronomer Claudius Ptolemaeus in the 2nd century AD, finally standardised geocentrism. His main astronomical work, the &quot;Almagest&quot;, was the culmination of centuries of work by Hellenic, Hellenistic and Babylonian astronomers. For over a millennium, European and Islamic astronomers assumed it was the correct cosmological model. Because of its influence, people sometimes wrongly think the Ptolemaic system is identical with the geocentric model.

Ptolemy argued that the Earth was a sphere in the center of the universe, from the simple observation that half the stars were above the horizon and half were below the horizon at any time (stars on rotating stellar sphere), and the assumption that the stars were all at some modest distance from the center of the universe. If the Earth were substantially displaced from the center, this division into visible and invisible stars would not be equal.

===Ptolemaic system===

In the Ptolemaic system, each planet is moved by a system of two spheres: one called its deferent; the other, its epicycle. The deferent is a circle whose center point, called the eccentric and marked in the diagram with an X, is distant from the Earth. The original purpose of the eccentric was to account for the difference in length of the seasons (northern autumn was about five days shorter than spring during this time period) by placing the Earth away from the center of rotation of the rest of the universe. Another sphere, the epicycle, is embedded inside the deferent sphere and is represented by the smaller dotted line to the right. A given planet then moves around the epicycle at the same time the epicycle moves along the path marked by the deferent. These combined movements cause the given planet to move closer to and further away from the Earth at different points in its orbit, and explained the observation that planets slowed down, stopped, and moved backward in retrograde motion, and then again reversed to resume normal, or prograde, motion.

The deferent-and-epicycle model had been used by Greek astronomers for centuries along with the idea of the eccentric (a deferent whose center is slightly away from the Earth), which was even older. In the illustration, the center of the deferent is not the Earth but the spot marked X, making it eccentric (from the Greek ἐκ &quot;ec-&quot; meaning &quot;from&quot; and κέντρον &quot;kentron&quot; meaning &quot;center&quot;), from which the spot takes its name. Unfortunately, the system that was available in Ptolemy&#x27;s time did not quite match observations, even though it was an improvement over Hipparchus&#x27; system. Most noticeably the size of a planet&#x27;s retrograde loop (especially that of Mars) would be smaller, or sometimes larger, than expected, resulting in positional errors of as much as 30 degrees. To alleviate the problem, Ptolemy developed the equant. The equant was a point near the center of a planet&#x27;s orbit where, if you were to stand there and watch, the center of the planet&#x27;s epicycle would always appear to move at uniform speed; all other locations would see non-uniform speed, as on the Earth. By using an equant, Ptolemy claimed to keep motion which was uniform and circular, although it departed from the Platonic ideal of uniform circular motion. The resultant system, which eventually came to be widely accepted in the west, seems unwieldy to modern astronomers; each planet required an epicycle revolving on a deferent, offset by an equant which was different for each planet. It predicted various celestial motions, including the beginning and end of retrograde motion, to within a maximum error of 10 degrees, considerably better than without the equant.

The model with epicycles is in fact a very good model of an elliptical orbit with low eccentricity. The well-known ellipse shape does not appear to a noticeable extent when the eccentricity is less than 5%, but the offset distance of the &quot;center&quot; (in fact the focus occupied by the Sun) is very noticeable even with low eccentricities as possessed by the planets.

To summarize, Ptolemy conceived a system that was compatible with Aristotelian philosophy and succeeded in tracking actual observations and predicting future movement mostly to within the limits of the next 1000 years of observations. The observed motions and his mechanisms for explaining them include:

The geocentric model was eventually replaced by the heliocentric model. Copernican heliocentrism could remove Ptolemy&#x27;s epicycles because the retrograde motion could be seen to be the result of the combination of the movements and speeds of Earth and planets. Copernicus felt strongly that equants were a violation of Aristotelian purity, and proved that replacement of the equant with a pair of new epicycles was entirely equivalent. Astronomers often continued using the equants instead of the epicycles because the former was easier to calculate, and gave the same result.

It has been determined that the Copernican, Ptolemaic and even the Tychonic models provide identical results to identical inputs: they are computationally equivalent. It was not until Kepler demonstrated a physical observation that could show that the physical Sun is directly involved in determining an orbit that a new model was required.
The Ptolemaic order of spheres from Earth outward is:
# Moon
# Mercury
# Venus
# Sun
# Mars
# Jupiter
# Saturn
# Fixed Stars
# &quot;Primum Mobile&quot; (&quot;First Moved&quot;)

Ptolemy did not invent or work out this order, which aligns with the ancient Seven Heavens religious cosmology common to the major Eurasian religious traditions. It also follows the decreasing orbital periods of the Moon, Sun, planets and stars.

===Persian and Arab astronomy and geocentrism===

Muslim astronomers generally accepted the Ptolemaic system and the geocentric model, but by the 10th century, texts appeared regularly whose subject matter expressed doubts concerning Ptolemy (&quot;shukūk&quot;). Several Muslim scholars questioned Earth&#x27;s apparent immobility and centrality within the universe. Some Muslim astronomers believed that Earth rotates around its axis, such as Abu Sa&#x27;id al-Sijzi (d. circa 1020). According to al-Biruni, Sijzi invented an astrolabe called &quot;al-zūraqī&quot;, based upon a belief held by some of his contemporaries &quot;that the motion we see is due to the Earth&#x27;s movement and not to that of the sky&quot;. The prevalence of this belief is further confirmed by a reference from the 13th century that states: According to the geometers [or engineers] (&quot;muhandisīn&quot;), the Earth is in constant circular motion, and what appears to be the motion of the heavens is actually due to the motion of the Earth and not the stars. Early in the 11th century, Alhazen wrote a scathing critique of Ptolemy&#x27;s model in his &quot;Doubts on Ptolemy&quot; (), which some have interpreted to imply he was criticizing Ptolemy&#x27;s geocentrism, but most agree that he was actually criticizing the details of Ptolemy&#x27;s model rather than his geocentrism.

In the 12th century, Arzachel departed from the ancient Greek idea of uniform circular motions by hypothesizing that the planet Mercury moves in an elliptic orbit, while Alpetragius proposed a planetary model that abandoned the equant, epicycle and eccentric mechanisms, though this resulted in a system that was mathematically less accurate. His alternative system spread through most of Europe during the 13th century.

Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (1149–1209), in dealing with his conception of physics and the physical world in his &quot;Matalib&quot;, rejects the Aristotelian and Avicennian notion of the Earth&#x27;s centrality within the universe, but instead argues that there are &quot;a thousand thousand worlds (&quot;alfa alfi &#x27;awalim&quot;) beyond this world, such that each one of those worlds be bigger and more massive than this world, as well as having the like of what this world has.&quot; To support his theological argument, he cites the Qur&#x27;anic verse, &quot;All praise belongs to God, Lord of the Worlds&quot;, emphasizing the term &quot;Worlds&quot;.

The &quot;Maragha Revolution&quot; refers to the Maragha school&#x27;s revolution against Ptolemaic astronomy. The &quot;Maragha school&quot; was an astronomical tradition beginning in the Maragha observatory and continuing with astronomers from the Damascus mosque and Samarkand observatory. Like their Andalusian predecessors, the Maragha astronomers attempted to solve the equant problem (the circle around whose circumference a planet or the center of an epicycle was conceived to move uniformly) and produce alternative configurations to the Ptolemaic model without abandoning geocentrism. They were more successful than their Andalusian predecessors in producing non-Ptolemaic configurations which eliminated the equant and eccentrics, were more accurate than the Ptolemaic model in numerically predicting planetary positions, and were in better agreement with empirical observations. The most important of the Maragha astronomers included Mo&#x27;ayyeduddin Urdi (died 1266), Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī (1201–1274), Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (1236–1311), Ibn al-Shatir (1304–1375), Ali Qushji (), Al-Birjandi (died 1525), and Shams al-Din al-Khafri (died 1550).

However, the Maragha school never made the paradigm shift to heliocentrism. The influence of the Maragha school on Copernicus remains speculative, since there is no documentary evidence to prove it. The possibility that Copernicus independently developed the Tusi couple remains open, since no researcher has yet demonstrated that he knew about Tusi&#x27;s work or that of the Maragha school.

==Ptolemaic and rival systems==

Not all Greeks agreed with the geocentric model. The Pythagorean system has already been mentioned; some Pythagoreans believed the Earth to be one of several planets going around a central fire. Hicetas and Ecphantus, two Pythagoreans of the 5th century BC, and Heraclides Ponticus in the 4th century BC, believed that the Earth rotated on its axis but remained at the center of the universe. Such a system still qualifies as geocentric. It was revived in the Middle Ages by Jean Buridan. Heraclides Ponticus was once thought to have proposed that both Venus and Mercury went around the Sun rather than the Earth, but it is now known that he did not. Martianus Capella definitely put Mercury and Venus in orbit around the Sun. Aristarchus of Samos wrote a work, which has not survived, on heliocentrism, saying that the Sun was at the center of the universe, while the Earth and other planets revolved around it. His theory was not popular, and he had one named follower, Seleucus of Seleucia.
Epicurus was the most radical. He correctly realized in the 4th century BC that the universe does not have any single center. This theory was widely accepted by the later Epicureans and was notably defended by Lucretius in his poem De rerum natura.

===Copernican system===

In 1543, the geocentric system met its first serious challenge with the publication of Copernicus&#x27; &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; (&quot;On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres&quot;), which posited that the Earth and the other planets instead revolved around the Sun. The geocentric system was still held for many years afterwards, as at the time the Copernican system did not offer better predictions than the geocentric system, and it posed problems for both natural philosophy and scripture. The Copernican system was no more accurate than Ptolemy&#x27;s system, because it still used circular orbits. This was not altered until Johannes Kepler postulated that they were elliptical (Kepler&#x27;s first law of planetary motion).

===Tychonic system===
Tycho Brahe (1545-1601), made more accurate determinations of the positions of planets and stars. He sought the effect of stellar parallax, which would have been empirically verifiable proof of the Earth&#x27;s motion around the Sun predicted by the Copernican model. Having observed no effect, he rejected the idea of the Earth&#x27;s motion. 

Consequently, he introduced a new system, the Tychonic system, in which the Earth was still at the center of the universe, and around it revolved the Sun, but all the other planets revolved around the Sun in a set of epicycles. His model considered both the benefits of the Copernican model and the lack of evidence for the Earth&#x27;s motion.

===Observation by Galileo and abandonment of the Ptolemaic model===
With the invention of the telescope in 1609, observations made by Galileo Galilei (such as that Jupiter has moons) called into question some of the tenets of geocentrism but did not seriously threaten it. Because he observed dark &quot;spots&quot; on the Moon, craters, he remarked that the moon was not a perfect celestial body as had been previously conceived. This was the first detailed observation by telescope of the Moon&#x27;s imperfections, which had previously been explained by Aristotle as the Moon being contaminated by Earth and its heavier elements, in contrast to the aether of the higher spheres. Galileo could also see the moons of Jupiter, which he dedicated to Cosimo II de&#x27; Medici, and stated that they orbited around Jupiter, not Earth. This was a significant claim as it would mean not only that not everything revolved around Earth as stated in the Ptolemaic model, but also showed a secondary celestial body could orbit a moving celestial body, strengthening the heliocentric argument that a moving Earth could retain the Moon. Galileo&#x27;s observations were verified by other astronomers of the time period who quickly adopted use of the telescope, including Christoph Scheiner, Johannes Kepler, and Giovan Paulo Lembo.
In December 1610, Galileo Galilei used his telescope to observe that Venus showed all phases, just like the Moon. He thought that while this observation was incompatible with the Ptolemaic system, it was a natural consequence of the heliocentric system.

However, Ptolemy placed Venus&#x27; deferent and epicycle entirely inside the sphere of the Sun (between the Sun and Mercury), but this was arbitrary; he could just as easily have swapped Venus and Mercury and put them on the other side of the Sun, or made any other arrangement of Venus and Mercury, as long as they were always near a line running from the Earth through the Sun, such as placing the center of the Venus epicycle near the Sun. In this case, if the Sun is the source of all the light, under the Ptolemaic system:

But Galileo saw Venus at first small and full, and later large and crescent.
This showed that with a Ptolemaic cosmology, the Venus epicycle can be neither completely inside nor completely outside of the orbit of the Sun. As a result, Ptolemaics abandoned the idea that the epicycle of Venus was completely inside the Sun, and later 17th-century competition between astronomical cosmologies focused on variations of the Tychonic or Copernican systems.

==Gravitation==
Johannes Kepler analysed Tycho Brahe&#x27;s famously accurate observations, and afterwards constructed his three laws in 1609 and 1619, based upon a heliocentric model wherein the planets move in elliptical paths. Using these laws, he was the first astronomer to successfully predict a transit of Venus for the year 1631. The change from circular orbits to elliptical planetary paths dramatically improved the accuracy of celestial observations and predictions. Because the heliocentric model devised by Copernicus was no more accurate than Ptolemy&#x27;s system, new observations were needed to persuade those who still adhered to the geocentric model. However, Kepler&#x27;s laws based upon Brahe&#x27;s data became a problem that geocentrists could not easily overcome.

In 1687, Isaac Newton stated the law of universal gravitation, which was described earlier as a hypothesis by Robert Hooke and others. His main achievement was to mathematically derive Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion from the law of gravitation, thus helping to prove the latter. This introduced gravitation as the force which kept Earth and the planets moving through the universe, and also kept the atmosphere from flying away. The theory of gravity allowed scientists to rapidly construct a plausible heliocentric model for the Solar System. In his &quot;Principia&quot;, Newton explained his theory of how gravity, previously thought to be a mysterious, unexplained occult force, directed the movements of celestial bodies, and kept our Solar System in working order. His descriptions of centripetal force were a breakthrough in scientific thought, using the newly developed mathematical discipline of differential calculus, finally replacing the previous schools of scientific thought, which had been dominated by Aristotle and Ptolemy. However, the process was gradual.

Several empirical tests of Newton&#x27;s theory, explaining the longer period of oscillation of a pendulum at the equator and the differing size of a degree of latitude, would gradually become available between 1673 and 1738. In addition, stellar aberration was observed by Robert Hooke in 1674, and tested in a series of observations by Jean Picard over a period of ten years, finishing in 1680. However, it was not explained until 1729, when James Bradley provided an approximate explanation in terms of the Earth&#x27;s revolution about the Sun.

In 1838, astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel measured the parallax of the star 61 Cygni successfully, and disproved Ptolemy&#x27;s claim that parallax motion did not exist. This finally confirmed the assumptions made by Copernicus, providing accurate, dependable scientific observations, and conclusively displaying how distant stars are from Earth.

A geocentric frame is useful for many everyday activities and most laboratory experiments, but is a less appropriate choice for Solar System mechanics and space travel. While a heliocentric frame is most useful in those cases, galactic and extragalactic astronomy is easier if the Sun is treated as neither stationary nor the center of the universe, but rather rotating around the center of our galaxy, while in turn our galaxy is also not at rest in the cosmic background.

==Relativity==
Albert Einstein and Leopold Infeld wrote in &quot;The Evolution of Physics&quot; (1938): &quot;Can we formulate physical laws so that they are valid for all CS [coordinate systems], not only those moving uniformly, but also those moving quite arbitrarily, relative to each other? If this can be done, our difficulties will be over. We shall then be able to apply the laws of nature to any CS. The struggle, so violent in the early days of science, between the views of Ptolemy and Copernicus would then be quite meaningless. Either CS could be used with equal justification. The two sentences, &#x27;the sun is at rest and the Earth moves&#x27;, or &#x27;the sun moves and the Earth is at rest&#x27;, would simply mean two different conventions concerning two different CS.
Could we build a real relativistic physics valid in all CS; a physics in which there would be no place for absolute, but only for relative, motion? This is indeed possible!&quot;

Despite giving more respectability to the geocentric view than Newtonian physics does, relativity is not geocentric. Rather, relativity states that the Sun, the Earth, the Moon, Jupiter, or any other point for that matter could be chosen as a center of the Solar System with equal validity.

Relativity agrees with Newtonian predictions that regardless of whether the Sun or the Earth are chosen arbitrarily as the center of the coordinate system describing the Solar System, the paths of the planets form (roughly) ellipses with respect to the Sun, not the Earth. With respect to the average reference frame of the fixed stars, the planets do indeed move around the Sun, which due to its much larger mass, moves far less than its own diameter and the gravity of which is dominant in determining the orbits of the planets (in other words, the center of mass of the Solar System is near the center of the Sun). The Earth and Moon are much closer to being a binary planet; the center of mass around which they both rotate is still inside the Earth, but is about or 72.6% of the Earth&#x27;s radius away from the centre of the Earth (thus closer to the surface than the center).

What the principle of relativity points out is that correct mathematical calculations can be made regardless of the reference frame chosen, and these will all agree with each other as to the predictions of actual motions of bodies with respect to each other. It is not necessary to choose the object in the Solar System with the largest gravitational field as the center of the coordinate system in order to predict the motions of planetary bodies, though doing so may make calculations easier to perform or interpret. A geocentric coordinate system can be more convenient when dealing only with bodies mostly influenced by the gravity of the Earth (such as artificial satellites and the Moon), or when calculating what the sky will look like when viewed from Earth (as opposed to an imaginary observer looking down on the entire Solar System, where a different coordinate system might be more convenient).

==Religious and contemporary adherence to geocentrism==
The Ptolemaic model held sway into the early modern age; from the late 16th century onward it was gradually replaced as the consensus description by the heliocentric model. Geocentrism as a separate religious belief, however, never completely died out. In the United States between 1870 and 1920, for example, various members of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod published articles disparaging Copernican astronomy and promoting geocentrism. However, in the 1902 &quot;Theological Quarterly&quot;, A. L. Graebner observed that the synod had no doctrinal position on geocentrism, heliocentrism, or any scientific model, unless it were to contradict Scripture. He stated that any possible declarations of geocentrists within the synod did not set the position of the church body as a whole.

Articles arguing that geocentrism was the biblical perspective appeared in some early creation science newsletters pointing to some passages in the Bible, which, when taken literally, indicate that the daily apparent motions of the Sun and the Moon are due to their actual motions around the Earth rather than due to the rotation of the Earth about its axis. For example, in , the Sun and Moon are said to stop in the sky, and in Psalms the world is described as immobile. says in part, &quot;the world is established, firm and secure&quot;. Contemporary advocates for such religious beliefs include Robert Sungenis (author of the 2006 book &quot;Galileo Was Wrong&quot; and the 2014 pseudo-documentary film &quot;The Principle&quot;). These people subscribe to the view that a plain reading of the Bible contains an accurate account of the manner in which the universe was created and requires a geocentric worldview. Most contemporary creationist organizations reject such perspectives.

===Polls===
According to a report released in 2014 by the National Science Foundation, 26% of Americans surveyed believe that the Sun revolves around the Earth.
Morris Berman quotes a 2006 survey that show currently some 20% of the U.S. population believe that the Sun goes around the Earth (geocentricism) rather than the Earth goes around the Sun (heliocentricism), while a further 9% claimed not to know. Polls conducted by Gallup in the 1990s found that 16% of Germans, 18% of Americans and 19% of Britons hold that the Sun revolves around the Earth. A study conducted in 2005 by Jon D. Miller of Northwestern University, an expert in the public understanding of science and technology, found that about 20%, or one in five, of American adults believe that the Sun orbits the Earth. According to 2011 VTSIOM poll, 32% of Russians believe that the Sun orbits the Earth.

===Historical positions of the Roman Catholic hierarchy===
The famous Galileo affair pitted the geocentric model against the claims of Galileo. In regards to the theological basis for such an argument, two Popes addressed the question of whether the use of phenomenological language would compel one to admit an error in Scripture. Both taught that it would not. Pope Leo XIII (1878–1903) wrote:
Maurice Finocchiaro, author of a book on the Galileo affair, notes that this is &quot;a view of the relationship between biblical interpretation and scientific investigation that corresponds to the one advanced by Galileo in the &quot;Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina&quot;. Pope Pius XII (1939–1958) repeated his predecessor&#x27;s teaching:
In 1664, Pope Alexander VII republished the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; (&quot;List of Prohibited Books&quot;) and attached the various decrees connected with those books, including those concerned with heliocentrism. He stated in a papal bull that his purpose in doing so was that &quot;the succession of things done from the beginning might be made known [&quot;quo rei ab initio gestae series innotescat&quot;]&quot;.

The position of the curia evolved slowly over the centuries towards permitting the heliocentric view. In 1757, during the papacy of Benedict XIV, the Congregation of the Index withdrew the decree that prohibited &quot;all&quot; books teaching the Earth&#x27;s motion, although the &quot;Dialogue&quot; and a few other books continued to be explicitly included. In 1820, the Congregation of the Holy Office, with the pope&#x27;s approval, decreed that Catholic astronomer Giuseppe Settele was allowed to treat the Earth&#x27;s motion as an established fact and removed any obstacle for Catholics to hold to the motion of the Earth:
In 1822, the Congregation of the Holy Office removed the prohibition on the publication of books treating of the Earth&#x27;s motion in accordance with modern astronomy and Pope Pius VII ratified the decision:
The 1835 edition of the Catholic &quot;List of Prohibited Books&quot; for the first time omits the &quot;Dialogue&quot; from the list. In his 1921 papal encyclical, &quot;In praeclara summorum&quot;, Pope Benedict XV stated that, &quot;though this Earth on which we live may not be the center of the universe as at one time was thought, it was the scene of the original happiness of our first ancestors, witness of their unhappy fall, as too of the Redemption of mankind through the Passion and Death of Jesus Christ&quot;. In 1965 the Second Vatican Council stated that, &quot;Consequently, we cannot but deplore certain habits of mind, which are sometimes found too among Christians, which do not sufficiently attend to the rightful independence of science and which, from the arguments and controversies they spark, lead many minds to conclude that faith and science are mutually opposed.&quot; The footnote on this statement is to Msgr. Pio Paschini&#x27;s, &quot;Vita e opere di Galileo Galilei&quot;, 2 volumes, Vatican Press (1964). Pope John Paul II regretted the treatment that Galileo received, in a speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 1992. The Pope declared the incident to be based on a &quot;tragic mutual miscomprehension&quot;. He further stated:
===Orthodox Judaism===

A few Orthodox Jewish leaders maintain a geocentric model of the universe based on the aforementioned Biblical verses and an interpretation of Maimonides to the effect that he ruled that the Earth is orbited by the Sun. The Lubavitcher Rebbe also explained that geocentrism is defensible based on the theory of relativity, which establishes that &quot;when two bodies in space are in motion relative to one another, ... science declares with absolute certainty that from the scientific point of view both possibilities are equally valid, namely that the Earth revolves around the sun, or the sun revolves around the Earth&quot;, although he also went on to refer to people who believed in geocentrism as &quot;remaining in the world of Copernicus&quot;.

The Zohar states: &quot;The entire world and those upon it, spin round in a circle like a ball, both those at the bottom of the ball and those at the top. All God&#x27;s creatures, wherever they live on the different parts of the ball, look different (in color, in their features) because the air is different in each place, but they stand erect as all other human beings, therefore, there are places in the world where, when some have light, others have darkness; when some have day, others have night.&quot;

While geocentrism is important in Maimonides&#x27; calendar calculations, the great majority of Jewish religious scholars, who accept the divinity of the Bible and accept many of his rulings as legally binding, do not believe that the Bible or Maimonides command a belief in geocentrism.

===Islam===

After the translation movement that included the translation of Almagest from Latin to Arabic, Muslims adopted and refined the geocentric model of Ptolemy, which they believed correlated with the teachings of Islam.

There have been some modern Islamic scholars who promoted geocentrism. One of them was Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi, a Sunni scholar of the Indian subcontinent. He rejected the heliocentric model and wrote a book that explains the movement of the sun, moon and other planets around the Earth.

==Planetariums==
Many planetariums can switch between heliocentric and geocentric models. In particular, the geocentric model is still used for projecting the celestial sphere and lunar phases in education and sometimes for navigation.

<text>In Greek and Roman mythology, Cacus (, derived from κακός, meaning bad) was a fire-breathing giant and the son of Vulcan (Plutarch called him son of Hephaestus). He was killed by Hercules after terrorizing the Aventine Hill before the founding of Rome.

==Mythology==
Cacus lived in a cave in Italy on the future site of Rome. To the horror of nearby inhabitants, Cacus lived on human flesh and would nail the heads of victims to the doors of his cave. He was eventually overcome by Hercules.

According to Solinus, Cacus lived in a place called Salinae, which later became the location of the Porta Trigemina.

According to Evander, Hercules stopped to pasture the cattle he had stolen from Geryon near Cacus&#x27; lair. As Hercules slept, the monster took a liking to the cattle and slyly stole eight of them – four bulls and four cows – by dragging them by their tails, so as to leave a trail in the wrong direction. When Hercules awoke and made to leave, the remaining herd made plaintive noises towards the cave, and a single cow lowed in reply.

Angered, Hercules stormed towards the cave. A terrified Cacus blocked the entrance with a vast, immoveable boulder (though some incarnations have Hercules himself block the entrance) forcing Hercules to tear at the top of the mountain to reach his adversary. Cacus attacked Hercules by spewing fire and smoke while Hercules responded with tree branches and rocks the size of millstones. Eventually losing patience, Hercules leapt into the cave, aiming for the area where the smoke was heaviest. Hercules grabbed Cacus and strangled the monster, and was praised throughout the land for his act. According to Virgil in Book VIII of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Hercules grasped Cacus so tightly that Cacus&#x27; eyes popped out and there was no blood left in his throat: &quot;et angit inhaerens elisos oculos et siccum sanguine guttur&quot;.
Another version of the myth states that Cacus made the cattle walk backwards so they left a false trail. Hercules drove his remaining cattle past a cave, where Cacus was hiding the stolen ones, and they began calling out to each other. Alternatively, Caca, Cacus&#x27; sister, told Hercules where he was.

According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, when the Aborigines and the Arcadians who lived at Pallantium learned of the death of Cacus and saw Hercules, they thought themselves very fortunate in being rid of the former, they were plucking branches of laurel, crowned both him and themselves with it and their kings invite Hercules to be their guest.

In the Roman tradition, Hercules founded an altar after he killed Cacus. Eusebius writes that Heracles erected an altar in the Forum Boarium, to commemorate his killing of Cacus.
In the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, the Arcadian King Evander recounts this story to Aeneas to explain the rites the people perform yearly to Hercules. This was the Ara Maxima, where later the Forum Boarium, the cattle market of Rome, was held. Hercules had temples in the area, including the still extant Temple of Hercules Victor.

==In later literature==
* In the &quot;Inferno&quot; of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; by Dante Alighieri, Cacus is depicted as a centaur with a fire-breathing dragon on his shoulders and snakes covering his equine back. He guards over the thieves in the Thieves section of Hell&#x27;s Circle of Fraud.
* In the second book of &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;, Cacus is said to be begotten by Polyphemus the Cyclops. He is also said to be the giant who fathered Etion.
* Miguel de Cervantes in his 1605 novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot; describes the inn keeper in the second chapter of part one &quot;The First Sally from his Native Heath&quot; as &quot;No less a thief than Cacus himself, and as full of tricks as a student or a page boy.&quot; Cervantes also mentions Cacus as a prototypical thief in a comparison in the sixth chapter of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; part one, &quot;The Scrutiny of the Curate and the Barber&quot; when the Curate says &quot;Here we have Sir Rindaldo of Montalbán with his friends and companions, bigger thieves than Cacus, all of them ...&quot; The comparison is a slight on Rinaldo, as he had written a book &quot;The Mirror of Chivalry&quot; which the Curate and the Barber agree caused, in part, Don Quixote&#x27;s descent into madness.
* In &quot;A Letter to a Friend&quot; Sir Thomas Browne compares the reluctance with which old people go to the grave with the backwards movements of Cacus&#x27; oxen.
* Cacus is described as a deformed outcast from an Italian village, able only to say &quot;Cacus&quot;, in Steven Saylor&#x27;s novel &quot;Roma&quot;, playing a direct role in the events of the main character of the era.
* Lavinia, in Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;Lavinia&quot;, describes Cacus as a &quot;fire lord, the chief man of a tribal settlement, who kept Vesta alight for the people of the neighborhood, with the help of his daughters.&quot; Lavinia comments that the Greeks&#x27; story of the beast-man &quot;was more exciting than mine.&quot;
* Cacus appears as the main antagonist in Rick Riordan&#x27;s short story in &quot;The Demigod Diaries&quot; titled &quot;The Staff of Hermes&quot;. There were references to Cacus&#x27; fight with Hercules in that story. In the story, Cacus had stolen Hermes&#x27; Caduceus. He later attacked Percy Jackson and Annabeth Chase. Annabeth hit Cacus with her metal claw and Percy killed Cacus with Hermes&#x27; Caduceus.

== In modern languages ==
In the Spanish language, the derived form &quot;caco&quot; is a colloquial word for &quot;thief&quot; and a disused word for a very cowardly man.

<text>The contiguous United States, also referred to as the conterminous United States, consists of the 48 adjoining U.S. states and the District of Columbia of the United States in central North America. The term excludes the only two non-contiguous states, which are Alaska and Hawaii (they are also the last two states to be admitted to the Union), and all other offshore insular areas, such as the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The colloquial term &quot;Lower48&quot; is also used, especially in relation to Alaska.

The related but distinct term continental United States includes Alaska, which is also on North America, but separated from the 48 states by British Columbia in Canada, but excludes Hawaii and all the insular areas in the Caribbean and the Pacific.

The greatest distance on a great-circle route is entirely within the contiguous U.S. is 2,802 miles (4,509 km), coast-to-coast between Florida and the Washington state; the greatest north–south line is 1,650 miles (2,660 km). The contiguous United States occupies an area of . Of this area, is actual land, composing 83.65 percent of the country&#x27;s total land area, and is comparable in size to the area of Australia. Officially, of the contiguous United States is water area, composing 62.66 percent of the nation&#x27;s total water area.

The contiguous United States, if it were a country, would be fifth on the list of countries and dependencies by area, behind Russia, Canada, China, and Brazil. However, the total area of the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, ranks third or fourth. Brazil is larger than the contiguous United States, but smaller than the entire United States including Alaska, Hawaii and overseas territories. The 2020 U.S. census population of the area was 328,571,074, comprising 99.13 percent of the nation&#x27;s total population, and a density of 111.04 inhabitants/sq mi (42.872/km2), compared to 93.844/sq mi (36.233/km2) for the nation as a whole.

== Other terms ==
While &quot;conterminous U.S.&quot; has the precise meaning of &quot;contiguous U.S.&quot; (both adjectives meaning &quot;sharing a common boundary&quot;), other terms commonly used to describe the 48 contiguous states have a greater degree of ambiguity.

=== Continental and mainland United States ===

Because Alaska is also a part of North America, the term continental United States also includes that state, so the term is qualified with the explicit inclusion of Alaska to resolve any ambiguity. On May 14, 1959, the United States Board on Geographic Names issued the following definitions based partially on the reference in the Alaska Omnibus Bill, which defined the continental United States as &quot;the 49 States on the North American Continent and the District of Columbia...&quot; The Board reaffirmed these definitions on May 13, 1999. However, even before Alaska became a state, it was properly included within the continental U.S. due to being an incorporated territory.

The term &quot;mainland United States&quot; is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;continental United States&quot;, but technically refers only to those parts of states connected to the landmass of North America, thereby excluding not only Hawaii and overseas insular areas, but also islands which are part of continental states but separated from the mainland, such as the Aleutian Islands (Alaska), San Juan Islands (Washington), the Channel Islands (California), the Keys (Florida), the barrier islands (Gulf and East Coast states), and Long Island (New York).

=== CONUS and OCONUS ===
&quot;CONUS&quot;, a technical term used by the U.S. Department of Defense, General Services Administration, NOAA/National Weather Service, and others, has been defined both as the continental United States, and as the 48 contiguous states. The District of Columbia is not always specifically mentioned as being part of &quot;CONUS&quot;.

&quot;OCONUS&quot; is derived from CONUS with &quot;O&quot; for outside added, thus referring to Outside of Continental United States.

=== The lower 48 ===

The term &quot;lower 48&quot; is also used to refer to the conterminous United States. The &quot;National Geographic&quot; style guide recommends the use of &quot;contiguous&quot; or &quot;conterminous United States&quot; instead of &quot;lower 48&quot; when the 48 states are meant, unless used in the context of Alaska. Almost all of Hawaii is south of the southernmost point of the conterminous United States in Florida.

=== Zone of the Interior ===

During World War II, the first four numbered Air Forces of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) were said to be assigned to the &quot;Zone of the Interior&quot; by the American military organizations of the time—the future states of Alaska and Hawaii, then each only organized incorporated territories of the Union, were respectively covered by the Eleventh Air Force and Seventh Air Force during the war.

== Terms used in the non-contiguous U.S. jurisdictions ==

Residents of Alaska, Hawaii and off-shore U.S. territories have unique labels for the contiguous United States because of their own locations relative to them.

=== Alaska ===
The vast territory of Alaska became the 49th state of the United States on January 3, 1959. Alaska is the northwest extremity of the North American continent, separated from the U.S. West Coast by the Canadian province of British Columbia. The term &quot;Lower 48&quot; has, for many years, been a common Alaskan equivalent for &quot;contiguous United States&quot;; today, many Alaskans use the term &quot;Outside&quot; for those states, though some may use &quot;Outside&quot; to refer to &quot;any&quot; location not within Alaska.

=== Hawaii ===

The territory of Hawaii, consisting of the entire Hawaiian Islands archipelago except for Midway Atoll, became the 50th state of the United States on August 21, 1959. It is the southernmost U.S. state, and the latest one to join the Union. Not part of any continent, Hawaii is located in the Pacific Ocean, about from North America and almost halfway between North America and Asia. In Hawaii and overseas American territories, for instance, the terms &quot;the Mainland&quot; or &quot;U.S. Mainland&quot; are often used to refer to the 49 states in North America.

=== Puerto Rico ===

Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea, approximately southeast of Miami, Florida. Puerto Ricans born in Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens and are free to move to the mainland United States. The term Stateside Puerto Rican refers to residents of any U.S. state or the District of Columbia who were born in, or can trace their family ancestry to, Puerto Rico.

=== U.S. Virgin Islands ===

The U.S. Virgin Islands is a U.S. territory located directly to the east of Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Sea. The term &quot;stateside&quot; is used to refer to the mainland, in relation to the U.S. Virgin Islands (see Stateside Virgin Islands Americans).

=== American Samoa ===
American Samoa is a U.S. territory located in the South Pacific Ocean in Polynesia, south of the equator — it is southwest of Hawaii. In American Samoa, the contiguous United States is called the &quot;mainland United States&quot; or &quot;the states&quot;; those not from American Samoa are called &quot;palagi&quot; (outsiders).

== Non-contiguous areas within the contiguous United States ==

Apart from off-shore U.S. islands, a few continental portions of the contiguous United States are accessible by road only by traveling through Canada. Point Roberts, Washington; Elm Point, Minnesota; and the Northwest Angle in Minnesota are three such places. Alburgh, Vermont, is not directly connected by land, but is accessible by road via bridges from within Vermont and from New York. By contrast, Hyder, Alaska, is physically part of contiguous Alaska and its easternmost town, but the only practical access is by road through Canada or by seaplane.

== List of contiguous U.S. states ==
The 48 contiguous states are:
In addition, the District of Columbia is within the contiguous United States.

<text>In Greek mythology, Cebriones (Ancient Greek: Κεβριόνης, &quot;Kebriones&quot;) was the illegitimate son of King Priam of Troy and a slave.

== Mythology ==
In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, he was the half-brother of Hector and his final charioteer during the Trojan War. Along with Hector and Paris, he was part of the division that finally breached the Argive wall. Patroclus, the Achaean warrior, killed him by throwing a &quot;shining stone,&quot; hitting him in the forehead and knocking his eyes out of his head. The force of the blow flung him from Hector&#x27;s chariot, leading Patroclus to remark that with his great &quot;diving&quot; ability, he could have satisfied many by diving for oysters in the &quot;storming sea&quot;.

Cebriones was also the name of a giant featured in the Gigantomachy and mentioned in Artistophanes&#x27; play &quot;The Birds&quot;.

<doc id="83763" wikidata="Q466882" url="?curid=83763" title="Ceryneian Hind">
<text>In Greek mythology, the Ceryneian hind ( &quot;Kerynitis elaphos&quot;, Latin: &quot;Elaphus Ceryniti&quot;s), was a creature that lived in Ceryneia, Greece and took the form of an enormous female deer, larger than a bull, with golden antlers like a stag, hooves of bronze or brass, and a &quot;dappled hide&quot;, that &quot;excelled in swiftness of foot&quot;, and snorted fire. To bring it back alive to Eurystheus in Mycenae was the third labour of Heracles.

Other names and descriptions for it were: doe with the golden horns, golden-horned hind, Ceryneia hind, Cerynitian hind, beast with golden antlers, Parrhasian hind, nimble hind of Maenalus and beast of Maenalus. Frazer says that the hind took its name from the river Cerynites, &quot;which rises in Arcadia and flows through Achaia into the sea&quot;.

One tradition says that Artemis found a mighty herd of five Ceryneian hinds playing on the base of Parrhasian hill far away from the banks of the &quot;black-pebbled Anaurus&quot; where they always herded. Artemis was so impressed by the hinds that she yoked four of them to her golden chariot with golden bridles, but purposely let one escape to the Ceryneian hill to be a future labour for Heracles. Whilst in Ceryneia, the hind chased farmers from vineyards.

The Ceryneian hind was sacred to Artemis. &quot;The hind is said to have borne the inscription &#x27;Taygete dedicated [me] to Artemis&#x27;.&quot; Because of its sacredness, Heracles did not want to harm the hind and so hunted it for more than a year, from Oenoe to Hyperborea, to a mountain called Artemisius, (a range which divides Argolis from the plain of Mantinea) before finally capturing the hind near the river Ladon.

Euripides says Heracles slew the hind and brought it to Artemis for propitiation. Another tradition says he captured it with nets while it was sleeping or that he ran it down, while another says he shot and maimed it with an arrow just before it crossed the river Ladon. Once Heracles captured the hind, and only after explaining to Artemis and Apollo (&quot;who would have wrested the hind from him&quot;) that he had only hurt the sacred hind out of necessity, was he allowed to take it alive to Eurystheus in Mycenae, thus completing his third labour.

==Art==
== Stag or Hind or female deer==
&quot;Pindar says that in his quest of the hind with the golden horns Hercules had seen &quot;the far-off land beyond the cold blast of Boreas. [Hyperborea]&quot; Hence, as the reindeer is said to be the only species of deer of which the female has antlers, Sir William Ridgeway argues ingeniously that the hind with the golden horns was no other than the reindeer.&quot;

A doe bearing antlers was unknown in Greece, but the story of the hind is suggestive of reindeer, which, unlike other deer, can be harnessed and whose females bear antlers. The myth relates to the Hyperborea, which may have been the archaic origin of the myth itself, as Robert Graves thought.

Authoritative primary source translations say the creature was a:

* doe
* hind
* deer
* hart
* stag plus Pseudo-Hyginus, &quot;Fabulae 30&quot;, (trans. Grant)
* beast

<text>:&quot;Cocalus is also a genus of jumping spiders&quot;.

In Greek mythology, Cocalus () is a king of Camicus () in the island of Sicily, according to Greek author Diodorus Siculus.

== Myth ==
After the escape of Daedalus and his son Icarus from King Minos&#x27;s imprisonment, and the subsequent death of Icarus, Daedalus arrived in Sicily, where he was welcomed by Cocalus. Minos was, however, determined to find Daedalus, and he travelled from city to city offering a challenge: he presented a spiral seashell and asked for it to be strung all the way through. When he reached Camicus, Cocalus, knowing that Daedalus would be able to solve the puzzle, showed it to him. Daedalus tied the thread to an ant, which walked through the seashell, stringing it all the way through.

Minos then knew Daedalus was sheltering in the court of Cocalus, and demanded that he be handed over. Cocalus managed to convince him to take a bath first, and then, Daedalus killed Minos with boiling hot water.

<text>In Greek mythology, Comaetho (; Ancient Greek: Κομαιθώ &quot;Komaithṓ&quot; means &quot;bright-haired&quot;) is a name that may refer to:

* Comaetho, a nymph of a spring who incessantly mingles her waters with those of the river god Cydnus, who in one passage of Nonnus&#x27; &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; is said to be her father, and in another her consort.
* Comaetho, a beautiful girl of Patrae who served as priestess in the temple of Artemis Triclaria and was in love with Melanippus. They were not allowed to marry each other, so they met secretly in the temple and had sex together. The outraged goddess sent famine and plague upon the city; to propitiate her, the inhabitants had to sacrifice both Comaetho and Melanippus to her. Since then, a young man and a young girl were sacrificed to the goddess each year until, in accordance with the instructions of the Delphian oracle, a strange king (Eurypylus, son of Euaemon) introduced the worship of a new deity (Dionysus, whose image he brought from Troy) in Patrae, thus both putting an end to the sacrifices and curing himself of madness which had been sent upon him when he had first looked at the god&#x27;s image.
* Comaetho, the daughter of Pterelaos and princess of the Taphians. The Taphians were at war with Thebes, led by Amphitryon, with whom Comaetho fell in love. The Taphians remained invincible until Comaetho, out of love for Amphitryon, plucked out the single golden hair, possession of which had bestowed upon her father the gifts of immortality and invincibility. Having defeated the enemy, Amphitryon put Comaetho to death in retribution for her deed of filial perfidy and handed over the kingdom of the Taphians to Cephalus. The story is parallel to that of Scylla (princess); compare also Pisidice and Leucophrye.
* Comaetho, daughter of Tydeus and sister of Diomedes, mother of Cyanippus by Aegialeus.

<text>In Greek mythology, Copreus (Ancient Greek: Κοπρεύς, &quot;Kopreús&quot;) was King Eurystheus&#x27; herald who announced Heracles&#x27; Twelve Labours.

== Etymology ==
His name is usually translated as &quot;dung man&quot;, or something equally unflattering. However, the name &quot;Copreus&quot; may originally have had more positive connotations, meaning &quot;grazier&quot; or &quot;man of the land&quot;, and been associated with the ownership of cattle rather than just their dung (κόπρος).

== Mythology ==
Copreus was said to be a son of Pelops and Hippodameia. He was a fugitive from Elis where he had killed a man called Iphitus, but Eurystheus purified him of the murder. Copreus had a son named Periphetes, who features briefly in the &quot;Iliad&quot; as a well-loved warrior speared by Hector. By contrast, Copreus is disparaged by Homer:

<text>In Greek mythology, Cranaus or Kranaos (;Ancient Greek: Κραναός) was the second King of Athens, succeeding Cecrops I.

== Family ==
Cranaus married Pedias, a Spartan woman and daughter of Mynes, with whom he had three daughters: Cranaë, Cranaechme, and Atthis. Atthis gave her name to Attica after dying, possibly as a young girl, although in other traditions she was the mother, by Hephaestus, of Erichthonius. Rarus was also given as a son of Cranaus.

== Reign ==
Cranaus was supposed to have reigned for either nine or ten years and was an autochthon (born from the earth), like his predecessor. During his reign the flood of the Deucalion story was thought to have occurred. In some accounts, Deucalion was said to have fled Lycorea to Athens with his sons Hellen and Amphictyon. Deucalion died shortly thereafter and was said to have been buried near Athens. Amphictyon is said to have married one of the daughters of Cranaus.

Cranaus was deposed by Amphictyon son of Deucalion, who was himself later deposed by Erichthonius. Cranaus fled to Lamptrae, where he died and was buried. His tomb was still there in the times of Pausanias. Cranaus was venerated as hero in Athens; his priests came from the family Charidae.

The people of Attica were referred to as &quot;Kranaoi&quot; after Cranaus, and Athens as &quot;Kranaa&quot; or &quot;Kranaai&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Cretan Bull () was the bull Pasiphaë fell in love with, giving birth to the Minotaur.

== Mythology ==
===Background===

Minos was king in Crete. In order to confirm his right to rule, rather than any of his brothers, he prayed Poseidon send him a snow-white bull as a sign. Poseidon sent Minos the bull, with the understanding that the bull would be sacrificed to the god. Deciding that Poseidon&#x27;s bull was too fine of a specimen to kill, Minos sent the bull to his herds and substituted another, inferior bull for sacrifice. Enraged, Poseidon had Aphrodite curse Pasiphaë, the wife of Minos, causing her to fall in love with the bull. She subsequently gave birth to the half-man, half-bull, Minotaur. Poseidon passed on his rage to the bull, causing him to lay waste to the land.

After consulting the oracle at Delphi, Minos had Daedalus construct the Labyrinth to hold the Minotaur.

===The seventh labour of Heracles===
Heracles was sent to capture the bull by Eurystheus as his seventh task. He sailed to Crete, whereupon Minos gave Heracles permission to take the bull away as he had been wreaking havoc on Crete by uprooting crops and leveling orchard walls. Heracles captured the bull, and then shipped him to Eurystheus in Tiryns. The bull later broke loose and wandered into Marathon, becoming known as the &quot;Marathonian Bull&quot;. Eurystheus then sent Heracles to bring back the man-eating Mares of Diomedes (the next task).

===Capture by Theseus===
Androgeus, a son of Minos and Pasiphaë, competed in the games held by Aegeus, King of Athens. He won all the games, but the bull, which broke free from his pen, rampaged through the city and trampled Androgeus. Devastated, Minos went to war with Athens and won. As punishment, the Athenians had to send several youths every 9 years to be devoured by the Minotaur.

Theseus set to try to capture the bull. On the way to Marathon, Theseus sought shelter from a storm in the shack owned by an old lady named Hecale. She swore to make a sacrifice to Zeus if Theseus was successful in capturing the bull. Theseus did capture the bull, but when he returned to Hecale&#x27;s hut, she was dead. Theseus built a deme in her honour. He then dragged the bull to Athens where he sacrificed him to Athena and/or Apollo. Theseus then went to Crete where he killed the Minotaur with the help of Minos&#x27; daughter Ariadne.

==Origin==
According to Jeremy McInerney, the iconography of the bull permeates Minoan culture. The cult of the bull was also prominent in southwestern Anatolia. Bernard Clive Dietrich notes that the most important animal in the Neolithic shrines at Çatalhöyük was the bull. The bull was a chthonic animal associated with fertility and vegetation. It figured in cave cults connected with rites for the dead.

The palace at Knossos displays a number of murals depicting young men and women vaulting over a bull. While scholars are divided as to whether or not this reflects an actual practice, Barry B. Powell suggests it may have contributed to the story of the young Athenians sent to the Minotaur. McInerney observes that the story of Pasiphaë and the Cretan Bull was not written until after Crete had come under Greek control. Emma Stafford notes that the story of the Cretan Bull does not appear before the Hellenistic period and suggests the connection between Crete and Athens is the result of the development of the myth of the Theseus cycle in late sixth century Athens.

== In popular culture ==
* Taurus is one of the oldest observed constellations, and has been variously connected with the abduction of Europa, the seduction of Io, and the Cretan Bull. The Taurid meteor shower is named after the radiant point in the constellation Taurus, from where they are seen to come. Occurring in late October and early November, they are sometimes called &quot;Halloween fireballs&quot;.
* Charles Bertram Lewis sees the episode of the Monstrous Herdsman in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot;, essentially a re-telling of the story of &quot;Theseus and the Minotaur&quot;.

<doc id="83779" wikidata="Q462582" url="?curid=83779" title="Pythias">
<text>Pythias (; ), also known as Pythias the Elder, was the adoptive daughter of Hermias, ruler of the cities Assos and Atarneus on the Anatolian coast opposite the island of Lesbos. She was also Aristotle&#x27;s first wife. Hermias was an enemy of Persia and allied with Macedonia. In his Will, Aristotle ordered that he be buried next to his wife. From his wording it is known that Pythias was already dead by the time he wrote his Will.

==Personal life and family==
Whilst Pythias&#x27; date of birth is unclear, she was active around 355 BC and she died in Athens sometime after 330 BC. Sources about the familial relationship between Pythias and Hermias provide contradictory information. The doxographer Aristocles of Messene, a Peripatetic philosopher, defended Aristotle from slander that claimed Pythias was both Hermias&#x27; adopted daughter and sister. Citing the text &quot;On Poets and Writers of the Same Name&quot; by the scholar Demetrius of Magnesia (1st Century BCE), another doxographer, Diogenes Laertius writes that Pythias was either Hermias&#x27; niece or daughter. Strabo identifies her as the daughter of Hermias&#x27; brother. For chronological reasons, it is unlikely that she was Hermias&#x27; sister.

Information about the exact time of and motives behind the marriage also differ. Demetrius of Magnesia and Strabo report that Hermias himself gave Pythias to Aristotle as a bride; if this was the case their marriage would fall in the time period of Aristotle&#x27;s stay in Assos (347-345/344). Aristocles portrays the matter differently: according to his information, Aristotle married Pythias only after the death of Hermias, who was captured and executed through subterfuge on the orders of the Persian King Artaxerxes III. The question of the motive behind the marriage depends upon its date. Aristotle&#x27;s enemies insinuated that he only married Pythias as a way to ingratiate himself with her father; because of that, the wedding would have been held before the death of his father-in-law. However, defending Aristotle&#x27;s marriage, Aristocles claims the wedding only occurred after Hermias&#x27; death, when the connection with the family of fallen rulers would offer no advantage whatsoever. Aristotle spoke out against Antipater in a letter: As justification for the marriage he pointed out his friendship with the executed Hermias, after whose death Pythias was left in an unfortunate situation. Whether or not the letter by Aristotle that Aristocles refers to was real is contested by researchers. It is only certain that nasty rumours circulated about the marriage of the philosopher.
Aristotle and Pythias had a daughter, Pythias the Younger, but it is uncertain whether or not she is the mother of his son Nicomachus; Diogenes Laertius, referencing Timaeus, reports that Herpyllis, who was supposedly Aristotle&#x27;s partner after Pythias&#x27; death, was Nicomachus&#x27; mother. Athenaeus also reports this, citing Hermippus. Herpyllis is even said to have become the philosopher&#x27;s second wife, however, the credibility of this information is dubious. A better source is the Will of Aristotle. From its contents it can be indirectly deduced that Pythias was Nicomachus&#x27; mother. Herpyllis, who was conspicuously and generously looked after by his Will, may have been a relative of Aristotle from Stagira, who lived in his household and therefore became a source of gossip for his enemies.

===Pythias the Younger===
Pythias the Younger married three times, but is also said to have predeceased her father. Her first husband was Nicanor, Aristotle&#x27;s nephew by his sister Arimneste. According to Aristotle&#x27;s will, Nicanor was to manage the family affairs until his son, Nicomachus, came of age. Pythias&#x27; second husband was Procles of Sparta. Pythias&#x27; third husband was Metrodorus, a physician; Diogenes Laertius relates that they had a son named Aristotle.

<text>Noah&#x27;s Ark (; Biblical Hebrew: &quot;Tevat Noaḥ&quot;) is the boat in the Genesis flood narrative through which God spares Noah, his family, and examples of all the world&#x27;s animals from a global deluge. The story in Genesis is based on earlier flood myths originating in Mesopotamia, and is repeated, with variations, in the Quran, where the Ark appears as &quot;Safinat Nūḥ&quot; ( &quot;Noah&#x27;s ship&quot;) and &quot;al-fulk&quot; (Arabic: الفُلْك). The myth of the global flood that destroys all life begins to appear in the Old Babylonian Empire period (20th–16th centuries BCE). The version closest to the biblical story of Noah, as well as its most likely source, is that of Utnapishtim in the Epic of Gilgamesh.

Early Christian and Jewish writers, such as Flavius Josephus, believed that Noah&#x27;s Ark existed. Unsuccessful searches for Noah&#x27;s Ark have been made from at least the time of Eusebius (c. 275–339 CE). Believers in the Ark continue to search for it in modern times, but no scientific evidence that the Ark existed has ever been found, nor is there scientific evidence for a global flood. According to Robert Moore, the boat and the natural disaster as described in the Bible would have been contingent upon physical impossibilities. Some researchers believe that a real (though localized) flood event in the Middle East could potentially have inspired the oral and later written narratives; a Persian Gulf flood, or a Black Sea Deluge 7,500 years ago has been proposed as such a historical candidate.

==Description==
The structure of the Ark (and the chronology of the flood) is homologous with the Jewish Temple and with Temple worship. Accordingly, Noah&#x27;s instructions are given to him by God (Genesis 6:14–16): the ark is to be 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high (approximately ). These dimensions are based on a numerological preoccupation with the number 60, the same number characterizing the vessel of the Babylonian flood hero. 

Its three internal divisions reflect the three-part universe imagined by the ancient Israelites: heaven, the earth, and the underworld. Each deck is the same height as the Temple in Jerusalem, itself a microcosmic model of the universe, and each is three times the area of the court of the tabernacle, leading to the suggestion that the author saw both Ark and tabernacle as serving for the preservation of human life. It has a door in the side, and a &quot;tsohar&quot;, which may be either a roof or a skylight. It is to be made of gopher wood &quot;goper&quot;, a word which appears nowhere else in the Bible, but thought to be a loan word from the Akkadian &quot;gupru&quot; – and divided into &quot;qinnim&quot;, a word which always refers to birds&#x27; nests elsewhere in the Bible, leading some scholars to emend this to &quot;qanim&quot;, reeds. The finished vessel is to be smeared with &quot;koper&quot;, meaning pitch or bitumen; in Hebrew the two words are closely related, &quot;kaparta&quot; (&quot;smeared&quot;) ... &quot;bakopper&quot;. Bitumen is more likely option as &quot;koper&quot; is thought to be a loanword from the Akkadian &quot;kupru&quot;, meaning bitumen.

==Origins==
===Mesopotamian precursors===

For well over a century, scholars have said that the Bible&#x27;s story of Noah&#x27;s Ark is based on older Mesopotamian models. Because all these flood stories deal with events that allegedly happened at the dawn of history, they give the impression that the myths themselves must come from very primitive origins, but the myth of the global flood that destroys all life only begins to appear in the Old Babylonian period (20th–16th centuries BCE). The reasons for this emergence of the typical Mesopotamian flood myth may have been bound up with the specific circumstances of the end of the Third Dynasty of Ur around 2004 BCE and the restoration of order by the First Dynasty of Isin.

Nine versions of the Mesopotamian flood story are known, each more or less adapted from an earlier version. In the oldest version, inscribed in the Sumerian city of Nippur around 1600 BCE, the hero is King Ziusudra. This story, the Sumerian flood myth, probably derives from an earlier version. The Ziusudra version tells how he builds a boat and rescues life when the gods decide to destroy it. This basic plot is common in several subsequent flood stories and heroes, including Noah. Ziusudra&#x27;s Sumerian name means &quot;he of long life.&quot; In Babylonian versions, his name is Atrahasis, but the meaning is the same. In the Atrahasis version, the flood is a river flood.

The version closest to the biblical story of Noah is that of Utnapishtim in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. A complete text of Utnapishtim&#x27;s story is contained on a clay tablet dating from the seventh century BCE, but fragments of the story have been found from as far back as the 19th century BCE. The last known version of the Mesopotamian flood story was written in Greek in the third century BCE by a Babylonian priest named Berossus. From the fragments that survive, it seems little changed from the versions of 2,000 years before.

The parallels between Noah&#x27;s Ark and the arks of Babylonian flood heroes Atrahasis and Utnapishtim have often been noted. Atrahasis&#x27;s Ark was circular, resembling an enormous &quot;quffa&quot;, with one or two decks. Utnapishtim&#x27;s ark was a cube with six decks of seven compartments, each divided into nine subcompartments (63 subcompartments per deck, 378 total). Noah&#x27;s Ark was rectangular with three decks. A progression is believed to exist from a circular to a cubic or square to rectangular. The most striking similarity is the near-identical deck areas of the three arks: 14,400 cubits2, 14,400 cubits2, and 15,000 cubits2 for Atrahasis, Utnapishtim, and Noah, only 4% different. Irving Finkel concluded, &quot;the iconic story of the Flood, Noah, and the Ark as we know it today certainly originated in the landscape of ancient Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.&quot;

Linguistic parallels between Noah&#x27;s and Atrahasis&#x27; arks have also been noted. The word used for &quot;pitch&quot; (sealing tar or resin) in Genesis is not the normal Hebrew word, but is closely related to the word used in the Babylonian story. Likewise, the Hebrew word for &quot;ark&quot; (&quot;tēvāh&quot;) is nearly identical to the Babylonian word for an oblong boat (&quot;ṭubbû&quot;), especially given that &quot;v&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are the same letter in Hebrew: bet (ב).

However, the causes for God or the gods sending the flood differ in the various stories. In the Hebrew myth, the flood inflicts God&#x27;s judgment on wicked humanity. The Babylonian &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; gives no reasons, and the flood appears the result of divine caprice. In the Babylonian Atrahasis version, the flood is sent to reduce human overpopulation, and after the flood, other measures were introduced to limit humanity.

===Composition===

A consensus among scholars indicates that the Torah (the first five books of the Bible, beginning with Genesis) was the product of a long and complicated process that was not completed until after the Babylonian exile. Since the 18th century, the flood narrative has been analysed as a paradigm example of the combination of two different versions of a story into a single text, with one marker for the different versions being a consistent preference for different names &quot;Elohim&quot; and &quot;Yahweh&quot; to denote God.

==Religious views==
===Rabbinic Judaism===

The Talmudic tractates Sanhedrin, Avodah Zarah, and Zevahim relate that, while Noah was building the Ark, he attempted to warn his neighbors of the coming deluge, but was ignored or mocked. God placed lions and other ferocious animals to protect Noah and his family from the wicked who tried to keep them from the Ark. According to one Midrash, it was God, or the angels, who gathered the animals and their food to the Ark. As no need existed to distinguish between clean and unclean animals before this time, the clean animals made themselves known by kneeling before Noah as they entered the Ark. A differing opinion is that the Ark itself distinguished clean animals from unclean, admitting seven pairs each of the former and one pair each of the latter.

According to Sanhedrin 108b, Noah was engaged both day and night in feeding and caring for the animals, and did not sleep for the entire year aboard the Ark. The animals were the best of their kind and behaved with utmost goodness. They did not procreate, so the number of creatures that disembarked was exactly equal to the number that embarked. The raven created problems, refusing to leave the Ark when Noah sent it forth, and accusing the patriarch of wishing to destroy its race, but as the commentators pointed out, God wished to save the raven, for its descendants were destined to feed the prophet Elijah.

According to one tradition, refuse was stored on the lowest of the Ark&#x27;s three decks, humans and clean beasts on the second, and the unclean animals and birds on the top. A differing interpretation described the refuse as being stored on the topmost deck, from where it was shoveled into the sea through a trapdoor. Precious stones, as bright as the noon sun, provided light, and God ensured the food remained fresh. In an unorthodox interpretation, the 12th-century Jewish commentator Abraham ibn Ezra interpreted the ark as a vessel that remained underwater for 40 days, after which it floated to the surface.

===Christianity===
The First Epistle of Peter (composed around the end of the first century AD) compared Noah&#x27;s salvation through water to Christian salvation through baptism. Hippolytus of Rome (died 235) sought to demonstrate that &quot;the Ark was a symbol of the Christ who was expected&quot;, stating that the vessel had its door on the east side—the direction from which Christ would appear at the Second Coming—and that the bones of Adam were brought aboard, together with gold, frankincense, and myrrh (the symbols of the Nativity of Christ). Hippolytus furthermore stated that the Ark floated to and fro in the four directions on the waters, making the sign of the cross, before eventually landing on Mount Kardu &quot;in the east, in the land of the sons of Raban, and the Orientals call it Mount Godash; the Armenians call it Ararat&quot;. On a more practical plane, Hippolytus explained that the lowest of the three decks was for wild beasts, the middle for birds and domestic animals, and the top for humans. He says male animals were separated from females by sharp stakes to prevent breeding.

The early Church Father and theologian Origen (&quot;circa&quot; 182–251), in response to a critic who doubted that the Ark could contain all the animals in the world, argued that Moses, the traditional author of the book of Genesis, had been brought up in Egypt and would therefore have used the larger Egyptian cubit. He also fixed the shape of the Ark as a truncated pyramid, square at its base, and tapering to a square peak one cubit on a side; only in the 12th century did it come to be thought of as a rectangular box with a sloping roof.

Early Christian artists depicted Noah standing in a small box on the waves, symbolizing God saving the Christian Church in its turbulent early years. Augustine of Hippo (354–430), in his work &quot;City of God&quot;, demonstrated that the dimensions of the Ark corresponded to the dimensions of the human body, which according to Christian doctrine is the body of Christ and in turn the body of the Church. Jerome () identified the raven, which was sent forth and did not return, as the &quot;foul bird of wickedness&quot; expelled by baptism; more enduringly, the dove and olive branch came to symbolize the Holy Spirit and the hope of salvation and eventually, peace. The olive branch remains a secular and religious symbol of peace today.

===Gnosticism===
According to the &quot;Hypostasis of the Archons&quot;, a 3rd-century Gnostic text, Noah is chosen to be spared by the evil Archons when they try to destroy the other inhabitants of the Earth with the great flood. He is told to create the ark then board it at a location called Mount Sir, but when Norea wants to board it as well, Noah attempts to not let her. So she decides to use her divine power to blow upon the ark and set it ablaze, therefore Noah is forced to rebuild it.

===Mandaeism===
In Book 18 of the Right Ginza, a Mandaean text, Noah and his family are saved from the Great Flood because they were able to build an ark or &quot;kawila&quot; (or &quot;kauila&quot;, a Mandaic term; it is cognate with Syriac &quot;kēʾwilā&quot;, which is attested in the Peshitta New Testament, such as Matthew 24:38 and Luke 17:27).

===Islam===

In contrast to the Jewish tradition, which uses a term that can be translated as a &quot;box&quot; or &quot;chest&quot; to describe the Ark, surah 29:15 of the Quran refers to it as a , an ordinary ship; surah 7:64 uses &quot;fulk,&quot; and surah 54:13 describes the Ark as &quot;a thing of boards and nails&quot;. Abd Allah ibn Abbas, a contemporary of Muhammad, wrote that Noah was in doubt as to what shape to make the Ark and that Allah revealed to him that it was to be shaped like a bird&#x27;s belly and fashioned of teak wood.

The medieval scholar Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn al-Husayn Masudi (died 956) wrote that Allah commanded the Earth to absorb the water, and certain portions which were slow in obeying received salt water in punishment and so became dry and arid. The water which was not absorbed formed the seas, so that the waters of the flood still exist. Masudi says the ark began its voyage at Kufa in central Iraq and sailed to Mecca, circling the Kaaba before finally traveling to Mount Judi, which surah 11:44 gives as its final resting place. This mountain is identified by tradition with a hill near the town of Jazirat ibn Umar on the east bank of the Tigris in the province of Mosul in northern Iraq, and Masudi says that the spot could be seen in his time.

===Baháʼí Faith===
The Baháʼí Faith regards the Ark and the Flood as symbolic. In Baháʼí belief, only Noah&#x27;s followers were spiritually alive, preserved in the &quot;ark&quot; of his teachings, as others were spiritually dead. The Baháʼí scripture &quot;Kitáb-i-Íqán&quot; endorses the Islamic belief that Noah had numerous companions on the ark, either 40 or 72, as well as his family, and that he taught for 950 (symbolic) years before the flood. The Baháʼí Faith was founded in 19th century Persia, and it recognizes divine messengers from both the Abrahamic and the Indian traditions.

===Ancient accounts===

Multiple Jewish and Christian writers in the ancient world wrote about the ark. The first-century historian Josephus reports that the Armenians believed that the remains of the Ark lay &quot;in Armenia, at the mountain of the Cordyaeans&quot;, in a location they called the Place of Descent (). He goes on to say that many other writers of &quot;barbarian histories&quot;, including Nicolaus of Damascus, Berossus, and Mnaseas mention the flood and the Ark.

In the fourth century, Epiphanius of Salamis wrote about Noah&#x27;s Ark in his &quot;Panarion&quot;, saying &quot;Thus even today the remains of Noah&#x27;s ark are still shown in Cardyaei.&quot; Other translations render &quot;Cardyaei&quot; as &quot;the country of the Kurds&quot;.

John Chrysostom mentioned Noah&#x27;s Ark in one of his sermons in the fourth century, saying &quot;&quot;Do not the mountains of Armenia testify to it, where the Ark rested? And are not the remains of the Ark preserved there to this very day for our admonition?

==Historicity==
The first edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; from 1771 describes the Ark as factual. It also attempts to explain how the Ark could house all living animal types: &quot;... Buteo and Kircher have proved geometrically, that, taking the common cubit as a foot and a half, the ark was abundantly sufficient for all the animals supposed to be lodged in it ... the number of species of animals will be found much less than is generally imagined, not amounting to a hundred species of quadrupeds.&quot; It also endorses a supernatural explanation for the flood, stating that &quot;many attempts have been made to account for the deluge by means of natural causes: but these attempts have only tended to discredit philosophy, and to render their authors ridiculous&quot;.

The 1860 edition attempts to solve the problem of the Ark being unable to house all animal types by suggesting a local flood, which is described in the 1910 edition as part of a &quot;gradual surrender of attempts to square scientific facts with a literal interpretation of the Bible&quot; that resulted in &quot;the &#x27;higher criticism&#x27; and the rise of the modern scientific views as to the origin of species&quot; leading to &quot;scientific comparative mythology&quot; as the frame in which Noah&#x27;s Ark was interpreted by 1875.

===Ark&#x27;s geometry===

In Europe, the Renaissance saw much speculation on the nature of the Ark that might have seemed familiar to early theologians such as Origen and Augustine. At the same time, however, a new class of scholarship arose, one which, while never questioning the literal truth of the ark story, began to speculate on the practical workings of Noah&#x27;s vessel from within a purely naturalistic framework. In the 15th century, Alfonso Tostada gave a detailed account of the logistics of the Ark, down to arrangements for the disposal of dung and the circulation of fresh air. The 16th-century geometer Johannes Buteo calculated the Ark&#x27;s internal dimensions, allowing room for Noah&#x27;s grinding mills and smokeless ovens, a model widely adopted by other commentators.

Irving Finkel, a curator at the British Museum, came into the possession of a cuneiform tablet. He translated it and discovered an hitherto unknown Babylonian version of the story of the great flood. This version gave specific measurements for an unusually large coracle (a type of rounded boat). His discovery lead to the production of a television documentary and a book summarizing the finding. A scale replica of the boat described by the tablet was built and floated in Kerala, India.

===Searches for Noah&#x27;s Ark===
Searches for Noah&#x27;s Ark have been made from at least the time of Eusebius (c. 275 – 339 CE) to the present day. In the 1st century, Jewish historian Flavius Josephus claimed the remaining pieces of Noah&#x27;s Ark had been found in Armenia, at the mountain of the Cordyaeans, which is understood to be Mount Ararat in Turkey. Today, the practice of seeking the remains of the Ark is widely regarded as pseudoarchaeology. Various locations for the ark have been suggested but have never been confirmed. Search sites have included the Durupınar site, a site on Mount Tendürek, and Mount Ararat, both in eastern Turkey, but geological investigation of possible remains of the ark has only shown natural sedimentary formations. While biblical literalists often maintain the Ark&#x27;s existence in archaeological history, its scientific feasibility, along with that of the deluge, has been contested.

== Var in Zoroastrianism ==
In Videvdad 29 and 37, mythical Iranian king Yīmā, was ordered by Ahura Mazdā to build a subterranean enclosure known as Var, which had a function similar to Noah’s Ark, he was instructed to gather plants, animals, and humans with some exceptions,

==Cultural legacy: Noah&#x27;s Ark replicas ==

In the modern era, individuals and organizations have sought to reconstruct Noah&#x27;s ark using the dimensions specified in the Bible, Noah&#x27;s Ark replicas and derivatives Johan&#x27;s Ark was completed in 2012 to this end, while the Ark Encounter was finished in 2016.

<text>The ark of bulrushes () was a container which, according to the episode known as the finding of Moses in the biblical Book of Exodus, carried the infant Moses.

The ark, containing the three-month-old baby Moses, was placed in reeds by the river bank (presumably the Nile) to protect him from the Egyptian mandate to drown every male Hebrew child, and discovered there by Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter.

==Analysis==
The ark is described as being daubed with asphalt and pitch, and the English word &quot;ark&quot; is a translation of the Hebrew תֵּבָה (&quot;tevah&quot;, modern &quot;teiva&quot;), the same word used for Noah&#x27;s Ark. According to Jeffrey H. Tigay, the word &quot;tevah&quot; is probably derived from the Egyptian word &quot;tbỉ&quot;, which refers to a &quot;box&quot; or &quot;coffin&quot;. Irving Finkel also notes similarities between the Biblical Hebrew term and the nearly identical Babylonian word for an oblong boat, &quot;ṭubbû&quot;.

The &quot;bulrushes&quot; ( &quot;gome&quot;) were likely to have been papyrus stalks daubed with bitumen and pitch.

A similar but earlier story is told of Sargon of Akkad.

<doc id="83835" wikidata="Q213456" url="?curid=83835" title="Gonad">
<text>A gonad, sex gland, or reproductive gland is a mixed gland and sex organ that produces the gametes and sex hormones of an organism. Female reproductive cells are egg cells, and male reproductive cells are sperm. The male gonad, the testicle, produces sperm in the form of spermatozoa. The female gonad, the ovary, produces egg cells. Both of these gametes are haploid cells. Some hermaphroditic animals (and some humanssee Ovotesticular syndrome) have a type of gonad called an ovotestis.

== Evolution ==

It is hard to find a common origin for gonads, but gonads most likely evolved independently several times.

== Regulation ==
The gonads are controlled by luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), produced and secreted by gonadotropes or gonadotrophins in the anterior pituitary gland. This secretion is regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) produced in the hypothalamus.

==Development==
The gonads develop from three sources; the mesothelium, underlying mesenchyme and the primordial germ cells. Gonads start developing as a common primordium (an organ in the earliest stage of development), in the form of genital ridges, at the sixth week, which are only later differentiated to male or female sex organs (except when they are not differentiated). The presence of the SRY gene, located on the short arm of the Y chromosome and encoding the testis determining factor, usually determines male sexual differentiation. In the absence of the SRY gene from the Y chromosome, usually the female sex (ovaries instead of testes) will develop. The development of the gonads is a part of the development of the urinary and reproductive organs.

==Disease==
The gonads are subject to many diseases, such as hypergonadism, hypogonadism, agonadism, tumors, and cancer, among others.

==Aging==
===Ovarian aging===
A delay in having children is common in the developed world and this delay is often associated with ovarian female infertility and subfertility. Ovarian aging is characterized by progressive decline of the quality and number of oocytes. This decline is likely due, in part, to reduced expression of genes that encode proteins necessary for DNA repair and meiosis. Such reduced expression can lead to increased DNA damage and errors in meiotic recombination.

===Testicular aging===
The testes of older men often have sperm abnormalities that can ultimately lead to male infertility. These abnormalities include accumulation of DNA damage and decreased DNA repair ability. During spermatogenesis in the testis, spontaneous new mutations arise and tend to accumulate with age.

<text>Teen magazines are magazines aimed at teenage readers. They usually consist of gossip, news, fashion tips and interviews and may include posters, stickers, small samples of cosmetics or other products and inserts.

The teen magazine industry is overwhelmingly female-oriented. Several publications, such as &quot;Teen Ink&quot; and &quot;Teen Voices&quot;, cater to both male and female audiences, although publications specifically targeting teenage boys are rare. Many scholars have critiqued teen magazines, as the topics presented are narrow and only present a limited range of female roles, some believe that they are effective because of the relationship developed between magazine and reader. There is a distinct feminine space that is made by the text itself as editors of teen magazines focus on making the content of their text appropriate to the analytical ability of their readers.

Along with most mainstream magazines, teen magazines are typically sold in print at supermarkets, pharmacies, bookstores and newsstands.

==History==
Teen magazines first gained prominence in the United States during the 1940s, with &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine being the first known publication geared towards a demographic of teenage girls. Examples of popular magazines during that time include &quot;Sassy&quot;, &quot;YM&quot;, &quot;CosmoGirl&quot;, &quot;Teen&quot;, and &quot;Teen People&quot;. Nowadays, popular contemporary American teen magazines include &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Teen Vogue&quot;, &quot;J-14&quot;, and &quot;Tiger Beat&quot;.

Teen magazines are produced in many countries worldwide, and are widely popular in Australia, Latin America, Europe, and Asia. In the United Kingdom, Fleetway&#x27;s &quot;Honey&quot; (1960–1986) is regarded as having established the sector. Large-scale Canadian teen magazines include the &quot;Faze&quot; magazine.

Since 1972, teen magazines in the United States have reached out to the African-American market with publications such as &quot;Right On!&quot; (produced by Sterling-McFadden, which also produces &quot;Tiger Beat&quot;) and &quot;Word Up!&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, changes in the way teenagers spend their money (and the fact that there were fewer of them, though they had more cash) led to many casualties in the 1990s because titles were unable to compete with mobile, digital and online media. Magazine publishers have moved down the age range with publications for &quot;tweenagers&quot; (those aged 9 to 13) gaining popularity, such as &quot;It&#x27;s Hot&quot;, &quot;BOP&quot;, &quot;J-14&quot; and &quot;Tiger Beat.&quot;

== Audience ==
Although in the United States, adolescence is generally considered to be the period between the ages 11 and 19, and teen magazines usually cater to people within that range, many readers comprise an even wider age range. According to a 2006 report by Magazine Publishers of America, 78% of teens read magazines. Of the media that adolescents refer to for information about sex, teen magazines are particularly important because they influence knowledge, attitudes, and values about sex and sexuality, especially for teenage girls.

According to Amy S. Pattee, author of &quot;The Developmental Appropriateness of Teen Magazines&quot;, the experience of reading teen magazines can result in heavy psychological impacts on their readers. The covers and content of the latest teen magazines promise adolescent girls dates, beauty, and success. Compared to the rich superstar singer, and the skinniest model shown and praised in the magazine, the reader is most likely to be left with a negative self-image and a heavy desire to aspire to be just like the women they read about.

== Subgenres ==
Teen magazines tend to be categorised as lifestyle (e.g. &quot;Sugar&quot;), entertainment (often based on music), or comics.

While some teen magazines focus almost exclusively on music and film stars, others feature more extensive coverage of lifestyle issues and are virtually junior versions of magazines such as &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; or &quot;Cleo&quot;. &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; is more focused on readers between the ages of 18 and 25, whereas &quot;Seventeen&quot; and &quot;Teen Vogue&quot; are geared towards teenagers and focus more on the bubbly teen gossip, celebrity culture, and newly stated trends on fashion and beauty.

==On the web==
In recent years, rapid technological advancement and the rise of the Internet has led to the emergence of online teen magazines. Examples include &quot;Faze&quot; in Canada, which is published in both web and print versions, and &quot;Rookie,&quot; an independently run online magazine and book series founded in 2011 by Editor-in-Chief Tavi Gevinson, which publishes writing, photography, and other forms of artwork by and for teenagers. With a digital format, the accessibility of teen magazines has also greatly increased, reaching readers from a diverse range of backgrounds and nationalities.

In the UK, sales in the teen magazine sector peaked in 1998. Teenagers had many more attractions competing for their cash and their attention, such as media delivered on the web and through mobile phones. Also, the booming celebrity weeklies attracted more teens from ever-younger ages (driven by celebrity TV series). In response to this, in April 2007, National Magazines - publisher of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and &quot;Cosmo Girl!&quot; - launched a digital weekly magazine for teens, &quot;Jellyfish&quot;, in a trial. This was the second attempt in the UK to establish a new online business model, the first being &quot;Monkey&quot; from Dennis, which aims to sell to men aged 18 to 34. In both cases, readers sign up to be sent the &#x27;eMag&#x27; by email. Each issue features interactive elements and &#x27;pages&#x27; that can be &#x27;turned&#x27;. However, National Magazines closed &quot;Cosmo Girl!&quot; in June and the &quot;Jellyfish&quot; experiment was drawn to a close in August.

== Critical reception ==

The experience of reading teen magazines can result in heavy psychological impacts on their readers. The covers and content of the latest teen magazines promise adolescent girls dates, beauty, and success As teen magazines are full of images of society&#x27;s definition of physical perfection, compared to the rich superstar singer, and the skinniest model shown and praised in the magazine, the reader is left with a negative self-image and a heavy desire to aspire to be just like the women they read about.

Teen magazines overtly suggest through content and pictures, how women should look, dress, and act; they more subtly suggest, through exclusion of pictures and content what women should not do, be, or think. The teen magazine, with its images of corporeal perfection and promises of social success, can be seen as evidence of a social ideal to which developing teens may aspire when reading the magazine. Self-development is influenced by an individual&#x27;s alignment with a social group. Such identification may lead an adolescent to form a mirror group, or clique of her own. As teens seek refuge in a socially safe category; teen magazines in particular offer monthly images of social promise.

Childhood is commonly considered to be a time/space of innocence. Research shows that the over sexualisation in teen magazines is believed to be a contributing factor of pushing girls into adolescence prematurely. Premature adolescence has proven to lead to a wide range of issues including body image, eating disorders, sexual violence, and self-esteem. Teen magazines are not only over sexualized, but sexually ambivalent as well—that is, messages about sex and sexuality contradict each other. For example, Carpenter noted that Seventeen magazine offers traditional scenarios of sex by urging teenage girls to refrain from intercourse until love or marriage is present, yet the same magazine simultaneously offers recreational scenarios of sex in which teenage girls are encouraged to explore their sexuality before marriage and with multiple partners.

Research shows that teen magazines are also having cultural impacts on its readers. Kelley Massoni, author of &quot;Modeling Work&quot;, considers teen magazines as a possible source for girl&#x27;s perceptions about the work world, including their own career futures. The labor market in Seventeen-land is heavily skewed towards professional occupations, particularly in the entertainment industry. A close reading of the text reveals four primary messages about the world of work: entertainment careers are a viable and prestigious option, men are the norm as workers, men hold the power, and fashion modeling is the pinnacle of &quot;women&#x27;s work&quot;.

The embarrassing stories column that is popular in most, if not all, teen magazines, is constructed not only to entertain the reader but also to offer behavioral guidance. The texts of these columns, titled, “Say Anything” in &quot;YM&quot;, “Trauma Rama” in &quot;Seventeen&quot;, and “Why Me?” in &quot;Teen&quot;, consist of a collection of embarrassing incidents in the magazine readers’ lives. Readers are encouraged to write to the magazine&#x27;s editors with their own tales, which, if published, are rated by the magazine staff. These ratings imply an mutual empathy and personal interaction between the author of the story and the reader. When reading of a fellow teen&#x27;s traumatic experience involving a leaking maxi-pad and a light-colored dress or the humiliation involved in passing loud gas during a silent chemistry test, it does seem as if no barriers exist between the personal and the publishable. These texts included in teen magazines are socially instructive. Clearly, teenaged girls caught “out of control” (making out with a partner, showing off to attract attention, applying makeup with a heavy or an uneducated hand) risk embarrassment and social alienation. The teenage reader, made aware of the risks of certain behaviors in certain scenarios can, by studying these columns, develops a certain understanding of societal rules.
