<text>Anthony Wayne (January 1, 1745 – December 15, 1796) was an American soldier, officer, statesman, and a Founding Father of the United States. He adopted a military career at the outset of the American Revolutionary War, where his military exploits and fiery personality quickly earned him a promotion to brigadier general and the nickname &quot;Mad Anthony&quot;. He later served as the Senior Officer of the Army on the Ohio Country frontier and led the Legion of the United States.

Wayne was born in Chester County, Pennsylvania, and worked as a tanner and surveyor after attending the College of Philadelphia. He was elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly and helped raise a Pennsylvania militia unit in 1775. During the Revolutionary War, he served in the Invasion of Quebec, the Philadelphia campaign, and the Yorktown campaign. Although his reputation suffered after his defeat in the Battle of Paoli, he won wide praise for his leadership in the 1779 Battle of Stony Point and was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Soon after being promoted to major general in 1783, he retired from the Continental Army. Anthony Wayne was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati of the state of Georgia. In 1780, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

After the war, Wayne held a brief career in congress and private business. Following St. Clair&#x27;s defeat, Wayne was recalled by President Washington from civilian life to command of U.S. forces in the Northwest Indian War, where he defeated the Northwestern Confederacy, an alliance of several American Indian tribes. Leading up to the war, Wayne oversaw a major change and reorganization of the entire United States Army. Following the 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers, he later negotiated the Treaty of Greenville which ended the war and their alliance with the British Empire.

Wayne&#x27;s legacy is controversial and debated in the 21st century with his legacy contested, due to his tactics under the Washington administration’s policies against Indian tribes during the Northwest Indian War.

==Early life==
Wayne was one of four children born to Isaac Wayne, who had immigrated to Easttown, Pennsylvania, from Ireland, and Elizabeth Iddings Wayne. He was part of a Protestant Anglo-Irish family; his grandfather was a veteran of the Battle of the Boyne, where he fought for the Williamite side.

Wayne was born on January 1, 1745, on his family&#x27;s 500 acre Waynesborough estate. During his upbringing, Wayne clashed with his father&#x27;s desires that he become a farmer. As a child, his father served as a captain during the French and Indian War, leaving an impression on Wayne who would mimic stories of battles at the time. He was educated as a surveyor at his uncle&#x27;s private academy in Philadelphia and at the College of Philadelphia for two years. In 1765, Benjamin Franklin sent him and some associates to work for a year surveying land granted in Nova Scotia, where he surveyed 100,000 acres. He assisted with starting a settlement the following year at The Township of Monckton and was involved with preparing the infrastructure to last through winters.

He married Mary Penrose in 1763, and they had two children. Their daughter, Margretta, was born in 1770, and their son, Isaac Wayne, was born in 1772. Wayne had romantic relationships with other women throughout his life, including Mary Vining, a wealthy woman in Delaware, eventually causing his wife becoming estranged from him. He later became a U.S. representative from Pennsylvania.

Wayne was an avid reader and often quoted Caesar and Shakespeare at length while serving in the military.

In 1767, he returned to work in his father&#x27;s tannery while continuing work as a surveyor.

As discontent with the British grew in the Thirteen Colonies, Wayne stepped into the political limelight locally and was elected chairman of the Chester County Committee of Safety and then to the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly.

==American Revolution==
In 1775, Wayne was nominated to the Pennsylvania Committee of Safety, where he served along with three other Pennsylvania committee members, John Dickinson, Benjamin Franklin, and Robert Morris. Following Great Britain&#x27;s enactment of the Intolerable Acts, Wayne began to oppose the British and by October 1775, his chairman position for the Chester County Committee of Safety was replaced by a Quaker as citizens described him as a &quot;radical&quot; against the British, an accusation Wayne denied. On January 3, 1776, Wayne was nominated as colonel of the 4th Pennsylvania Regiment by the Pennsylvania delegation of the Second Continental Congress. The poor supplies and controversies between his regiment and the Pennsylvania assembly would later influence Wayne to support the centralization of government.

===American Revolutionary War===
Wayne discarded the conventional tactics of line warfare, stating &quot;the only good lines are those nature made&quot;, and instead focused on maneuver warfare and strict discipline. He and his regiment were part of the Continental Army&#x27;s unsuccessful invasion of Canada where he was sent to aid Benedict Arnold. Wayne commanded a successful rear-guard action at the Battle of Trois-Rivières and then led the forces on Lake Champlain at Fort Ticonderoga and Mount Independence. His service led to his promotion to brigadier general on February 21, 1777. Some historians claim Wayne&#x27;s nickname &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; came from his bold military tactics from the Battle of Green Spring in Virginia, which his men barely escaped an outnumbered British force with a bold bayonet charge. Others claim it was from his quick temper and what historians label &quot;off-color language,&quot; specifically during an incident when he severely punished a skilled informant for being drunk.

On September 11, 1777, Wayne commanded the Pennsylvania Line at the Battle of Brandywine, where they held off General Wilhelm von Knyphausen in order to protect the American right flank. The two forces fought for three hours until the American line withdrew and Wayne was ordered to retreat. He was then ordered to harass the British rear in order to slow General William Howe&#x27;s advance towards Pennsylvania. Wayne&#x27;s camp was attacked on the night of September 20–21 in the Battle of Paoli. General Charles Grey had ordered his men to remove their flints and attack with bayonets in order to keep their assault secret. The battle earned Grey the sobriquet of &quot;General Flint&quot;, but Wayne&#x27;s own reputation was tarnished by the significant American losses, and he demanded a formal inquiry in order to clear his name.

On October 4, 1777, Wayne again led his forces against the British in the Battle of Germantown. His soldiers pushed ahead of other units, and the British &quot;pushed on with their Bayonets—and took Ample Vengeance&quot; as they retreated, according to Wayne&#x27;s report. Wayne and General John Sullivan advanced too rapidly and became entrapped when they were ahead of other American units. They retreated as Howe arrived to re-form the British line. Wayne was again ordered to hold off the British and cover the rear of the retreating body.

After winter quarters at Valley Forge, Wayne led the attack at the 1778 Battle of Monmouth, where his forces were abandoned by General Charles Lee and were pinned down by a numerically superior British force. Wayne held out until relieved by reinforcements sent by General George Washington. He then re-formed his troops and continued to fight. The body of British Lt. Colonel Henry Monckton was discovered by the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment, and a legend grew that he had died fighting Wayne.

Wayne also set an example for coping with adversity during military operations. In October 1778, Wayne wrote of the brutal cold and lack of appropriate supplies, &quot;During the very severe storm from Christmas to New Year&#x27;s, whilst our people lay without any cover except their old tents, and when the drifting of snow prevented the green wood from taking fire.&quot; Through these tough conditions, Wayne wrote that he sought to keep his soldiers &quot;well and comfortable.&quot;

In July 1779, Washington named Wayne to command the Corps of Light Infantry, a temporary unit of four regiments of light infantry companies drawn from all the regiments in the main army. His successful attack on British positions in the Battle of Stony Point was the highlight of his Revolutionary War service. On July 16, 1779, he replicated the bold attack used against him at Paoli and personally led a nighttime bayonet attack lasting 30 minutes. His three columns of about 1,500 light infantry stormed and captured British fortifications at Stony Point, a cliff-side redoubt commanding the southern Hudson River. The battle ended with around 550 prisoners taken, with fewer than 100 casualties for Wayne&#x27;s forces. Wayne was wounded during the attack when an enemy musket ball gashed his scalp. The success of this operation provided a small boost to the morale of the army, which had suffered a series of military defeats, and the Continental Congress awarded him a medal for the victory.

On July 21, 1780, Washington sent Wayne with two Pennsylvania brigades and four cannons to destroy a blockhouse at Bulls Ferry opposite New York City in the Battle of Bull&#x27;s Ferry. Wayne&#x27;s troops were unable to capture the position, suffering 64 casualties while inflicting 21 casualties on the Loyalist defenders.

On January 1, 1781, Wayne served as commanding officer of the Pennsylvania Line of the Continental Army when pay and condition concerns led to the Pennsylvania Line Mutiny, one of the most serious of the war. He successfully resolved the mutiny by dismissing about half the line. He returned the Pennsylvania Line to full strength by May 1781. This delayed his departure to Virginia, however, where he had been sent to assist General Lafayette against British forces operating there. The line&#x27;s departure was delayed once more when the men complained about being paid in the nearly worthless Continental currency.

On July 4, General Charles Cornwallis departed Williamsburg for Jamestown, planning to cross the James River en route to Portsmouth. Lafayette believed he could stage an attack on Cornwallis&#x27; rear guard during the crossing. Cornwallis anticipated Lafayette&#x27;s plan and laid an elaborate trap. Wayne led a small scouting force of 500 in 1781 at the Battle of Green Spring to determine the location of Cornwallis, and they fell into the trap; only a bold bayonet charge against the numerically overwhelming British enabled his forces to retreat. The action reinforced the perception among contemporaries that justified the moniker &quot;Mad&quot; to describe Wayne. During the Yorktown campaign, Wayne was shot in the leg; the lead musket ball was never removed from his leg.

After the British under Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown, Wayne went farther south and disbanded the British alliance with Native American tribes in Georgia. With the goal of establishing peace between settlers and Native Americans, Wayne captured Creek troops early in his time in Georgia, releasing them in order to establish goodwill between the Creek people and the United States.

Assuming good relations with the Creek soldiers and fearing an attacked from Lt Colonel Thomas Brown from Savannah, Wayne made camp and prepared for a British confrontation. Unbeknownst to him, Brown spent time influencing the Creek and Cherokee, and persuaded them to attack Wayne. The Creek people ambushed his camp at night which woke Wayne. Assuming another bayonet style British ambush, Wayne alerted his soldiers to arm themselves and prepare to die with him. The attack would be repelled. He eventually negotiated peace treaties with both the Creeks and the Cherokees during a bout with malaria, for which Georgia purchased a rice plantation for 4,000 guineas and rewarded it to him. Wayne would suffer from complications related to malaria for the remainder of his life.

==Civilian life==
=== Brief retirement and slavery ===
==== Pennsylvania ====

In 1783, Wayne returned to Pennsylvania and was celebrated as a war hero, deciding to enter politics with other friends at the time. Initially a supporter of more democratic views, Wayne later aligned more with Federalist Party and George Washington after the end of the Revolutionary War had aligned himself with that party as well. Like most federalists, he favored centralization, federalism, modernization, and protectionism. He went on to support Republicanism because Wayne ultimately believed that the United States should have a strong centrally-controlled government, stronger banks, manufacturing, and a standing army and navy.

Eventually Wayne presented himself as a candidate for the Pennsylvania Council of Censors and on election day in October 1783, he gathered troops and approached electoral judges, demanding that they would be allowed to vote. On October 10, 1783, he was promoted to major general. Wayne was elected to serve in the Pennsylvania General Assembly for two years.The Council convened to assess Pennsylvania&#x27;s governmental operations and ascertain if constitutional reforms were deemed imperative.

Wayne was a member and took an active part of the Constitutional Convention.

==== Georgia ====

Wayne&#x27;s view on slavery was the same as most of the American planters at the time, which is he supported slavery. However, like Washington, Wayne gradually grew to oppose the practice of it. His ownership of slaves was during his brief private career. Letters by Wayne from this time express concern about the economic efficiency of finding and managing slaves and concern about their harsh punishments. He was documented providing refuge for slaves from punishment in Georgia. During the Revolutionary War, Wayne wrote letters expressing how horrified he was by the treatment of slaves while traveling between camps and even urged Governor Martin to recruit blacks to fight with the Patriots.

He owned enslaved African Americans after the war, he would eventually take over the family farm and tannery business in Chester County. Wayne inherited a 40-year-old male slave named Toby, who was registered in Chester County as a &quot;slave for life.&quot; In 1786, he obtained slaves through the confiscated plantations, Richmond and Kew with a total area of . The 47 slaves were purchased from Adam Tunno, Samuel Potts, and others. He hired a plantation overseer to manage the plantation and direct the actions of his slaves. A record shows 9 boys, 12 girls, 11 women, and 15 men – from Adam Tunno for 3,300 pounds, paying 990 pounds initially and then 2,310 pounds over a five-year period. Wayne also had a personal slave named &quot;Caesar&quot; that he named after his favorite historical figure, Julius Caesar.

The plantations, were confiscated and officially given to Wayne in 1786 along with loans from Dutch bankers for repairs. Wayne quickly fell into debt running the plantations. He is also documented neglecting his business, frequently attending out of state political events, social parties, time with former soldiers, time in Pennsylvania, or traveling. His plantations were ultimately unsuccessful because of neglect and acquiring a large amount of debt. He later begged various acquaintances to assist him with making payments before selling the plantations. His contemporaries criticized him and his overseer for having a &quot;relaxed&quot; hand.

==== Reinstatement ====

After the war, Wayne spent his time living a retired life between Pennsylvania and Georgia. He had a brief career in private business running his tanner business in Pennsylvania and two rice plantations in Georgia.

President George Washington however called Wayne out of retirement in spring 1792 to command the newly formed Legion of the United States to secure the Northwest Territory for American settlers. Wayne became the senior commander in the U.S Army.

==== Congressman ====
 He was a delegate to the state convention that ratified the United States Constitution in 1788 and lost elections to the Senate and the House that same year. In late 1790, he was elected into the 2nd United States Congress as a representative of Georgia&#x27;s 1st congressional district. During his brief political career, he would remain loyal to George Washington with support. While in Congress, Wayne promoted the increased militarization of the United States and warned against future attacks from the British. He supported an act of 5,000 troops entering to secure ceded land in the Northwest Territory.

Wayne&#x27;s opponent James Jackson accused Wayne&#x27;s campaign manager Judge Thomas Gibbons of electoral fraud. A House committee determined that electoral fraud had been committed in the 1790 election and Local magistrates would later be implicated and not Wayne himself. A special election was held on July 9, 1792. Wayne attempted to run again, however was disqualified due to failing residency qualifications. John Milledge eventually filled Wayne&#x27;s vacant seat.

During his time in Georgia, his wife abandoned him after rumors of a relationship between Wayne and General Nathanael Greene&#x27;s wife Catherine spread. As a civilian, Wayne ultimately found himself bankrupt, abandoned by his wife, and later removed from office.

==Later military career==
The Northwest Indian War had been a disaster for the United States, as the British refused to leave the ceded land and continued their influence in Native American politics. Four years after the start of the British-supported Native American military campaign, the Constitution of the United States went into effect; George Washington was sworn in as president, which made him the commander-in-chief of U.S. military forces. Accordingly, Washington directed the United States Army to enforce U.S. sovereignty over the territory. The U.S. Army, mainly consisting of untrained recruits and volunteer militiamen, suffered a series of major significant defeats.

The British also sought to make the Ohio River the border with the United States and Native Americans to slow their progress. Many Native Americans in the Northwest Territory had sided with the British in the Revolutionary War, but the British had ceded any sovereignty over the land to the United States in the Treaty of Paris of 1783. The British were known for persuading Native Americans to fight for them and continued to do so. Although the British were reluctant to directly engage the United States, historian Reginald Horsman writes of their involvement in organizing Native American support, &quot;The Indian Department at Detroit had done all within its power to bolster northwestern Indian resistance to American expansion. The agents had acted as organizers, advisers, and suppliers of the Indians, and they had made it possible for an Indian army to face Wayne.&quot;

The United States formally organized the region in the Land Ordinance of 1785 and negotiated treaties allowing settlement, but the Northwestern Confederacy refused to acknowledge them as they were unaware of the British agreement. The British were determined to make the Ohio River the permanent boundary between the United States and sent war supplies to their Native Allies. People in the area quickly became embroiled in conflicts, and the skirmishes resulted in 1,500 deaths over a period of seven years.

After years of conflict in the region, Lieutenant Colonel James Wilkinson, who had a goal of becoming the next military leader, launched what he thought was a clever raid at the Battle of Kenapacomaqua. Wilkinson killed 9 Wea and Miami, and captured 34 Miami as prisoners, including a daughter of Miami war chief Little Turtle. Many of the confederation leaders were considering terms of peace to present to the United States, but when they received news of Wilkinson&#x27;s raid, they readied for war. Wilkinson&#x27;s raid thus had the opposite effect and contributed to St. Clair&#x27;s defeat. Up until that point, it was &quot;the most decisive defeat in the history of the American military&quot; and its largest defeat ever by Native Americans. Wayne&#x27;s close friend Major General Richard Butler died during St. Clair&#x27;s defeat. Wayne felt a lack of a well organized military and politics contributed to this defeat. This defeat would leave the United States completely open to attack from the British and their allies without the ability to defend itself. It was also later discovered that the British had a frequent tactic of dressing up as Native Americans to participate in their battles.

Interested in helping the U.S. Military rebuild, Wayne wrote to President Washington in the spring of 1789 asking to &quot;organize &amp; discipline a Legionary Corps,&quot; writing that &quot;Dignity, wealth, &amp; Power&quot; in the United States could only be achieved by the military. United States Secretary of War Henry Knox would agree with Wayne in July 1789, writing &quot;the sword of the Republic only, is adequate to guard a due administration of Justice, and the preservation of the peace,&quot; believing that treaties with Native Americans were worthless. At a time of his life when Wayne experienced a shameful political and personal status, President Washington recalled Wayne from civilian life to lead an expedition in the British-led Northwest Indian War.

In the north In May 1793, Wayne wrote to then Secretary of War Henry Knox, &quot;Knowing the critical situation of our infant nation and feeling for the honor and reputation of the government which I shall support with my latest breath, you may rest assured that I will not commit the legion unnecessarily.&quot; Samuel W. Pennypacker, a former governor of Pennsylvania and president of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, goes on to elaborate on Wayne&#x27;s perceived importance of American demonstrations of strength, &quot;Wayne had reached the conclusion that we should never have a permanent peace until the Indians were taught to respect the power of the United States, and until the British were compelled to give up their posts along the shores of the lake.&quot;

The confederacy achieved major victories in 1790 and 1791 under the leadership of Blue Jacket of the Shawnees and Little Turtle of the Miami tribe. The tribes were encouraged to refuse peace treaties and were supported by the British, who refused to evacuate their own fortifications in the region as stipulated in the Treaty of Paris, arguing that the American refusal to pay the debt agreements in the treaty meant that the treaty was not yet in effect.

At the same time, Washington was under congressional investigation and needed to raise a larger army to protect the borders against the British and their allied tribes. He felt his best choice was to recruit Wayne to take on this daunting task despite Wayne&#x27;s recent past. Injured, with swollen legs and recurring malaria, Wayne accepted command of the new Legion of the United States in 1792. Washington also allotted an extraordinary budget for Wayne to triple the size of the army, administering $1 million, about 83% of the federal budget, to establish control of the Northwest territory through 1,280 enlisted soldiers.

===Command of the Legion of the United States===
Upon accepting his new position, Wayne said, &quot;I clearly foresee that it is a command which must inevitably be attended with the most anxious care, fatigue, and difficulty, and from which more may be expected than will be in my power to perform.&quot; As the new commanding officer for the Legion of the United States, Wayne was first tasked with increasing the number of soldiers in his force. He expanded Fort Hamilton while he began recruiting in the spring of 1792 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Although recruiting proved to be a difficult effort with the failures of past American expeditions still fresh, Wayne eventually was able to successfully boost the number of soldiers in the Legion. He helped create several infantry regiments that still exist today, one of them being the Third United States Infantry, called 1st Sub-Legion at the time and later named Third Regiment of Infantry.

Wayne then established Fort Lafayette on September 4, 1792, as a frontier settlement from Fort Pitt. Based on earlier failures of American generals, it was vital to train new soldiers and prepare them for new conflicts. Wayne established a basic training facility at Legionville to prepare professional soldiers for the reorganized army, stating that the area near Pittsburgh was &quot;a frontier Gomorrah&quot; that distracted troops. Using the &quot;Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States&quot; authored by Prussian military officer Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, Wayne began to train his troops. This was the first attempt to provide basic training for regular Army recruits, and Legionville was the first facility established expressly for this purpose. Wayne set up a well-organized structure of sub-legions led by brigadier generals, seen as forerunners of today&#x27;s brigade combat teams. Wayne was a strict disciplinarian and executed several troops for offenses. Two soldiers were executed for sleeping at their posts. He required his soldiers to adhere to a sharp dress code, with each sub-legion having a distinctive cap and regimental standards with their unit colors. On April 7, 1793, Wayne&#x27;s troops moved to Fort Washington in Ohio and continued their intense training while also entrenching themselves to repel potential attacks.

Although some experts today are quick to point to the drawbacks of Wayne&#x27;s severe disciplinary methods, Major John Brooke finds they also helped build confidence among his troops. Each day, he allowed troops to receive half a gill of whiskey with their rations and an extra one for the best shooters. Barrels of rum, whiskey, wine, flour, and rations were stockpiled at various forts and traveled with Wayne&#x27;s legion. Brooke goes on to write about Wayne&#x27;s strong relationship with his soldiers, &quot;The winter passed drearily at Greeneville. They were almost in the heart of the Indian country, cut off from communication with the outside world, and surrounded by crafty and treacherous foes. Wayne shared the hardships and privations of his men, and personally saw that discicipline and instruction were kept up. The sentinel on post might know when to expect the conventional visit from the officer of the day, but he never knew at what hour he might see the form of the commander-in-chief emerge from the wintry gloom.&quot; Wayne&#x27;s support of his soldiers builds on his earlier experiences with his soldiers during the Revolutionary War.

During his command of the Legion of the United States, Wayne also encountered domestic problems en route to securing the Northwest Territory. On May 5, 1793, Wayne entered Cincinnati in preparation for future conflict further West. Although Kentucky was a newly independent state after breaking away from Virginia, many citizens still believed that the United States federal government did little to protect their economic interests in the region. Historian Paul David Nelson writes of the local sentiment,&quot;Thus, a few of Kentucky&#x27;s citizens continued into 1793 to plot all sorts of schemes, including assisting the French to attack Spanish territory, using Kentucky as a base of operations; taking Kentucky out of the federal union and uniting it with the Spanish Empire; and striking a deal with some Canadian citizens to form a separate nation in the West, free from the control of the United States, Britain, or Spain.&quot; After learning of a smaller than originally anticipated military force, Wayne had to turn to recruiting local Kentucky citizens with the help of Kentucky Governor, Isaac Shelby. Although Wayne was able to successfully add Kentucky citizens to the Legion, there were still fewer than expected and many joined too late to have a significant impact. Nelson goes on to write about the ineffectiveness of the Kentucky troops during the Northwest Indian War, &quot;Once the Kentucky soldiers reached Wayne&#x27;s winter head quarters, moreover, they did not cover themselves with glory. The commander, knowing that the troops were restless and murmuring about returning to their home state, suggested to Scott in late October that the Kentucky Mounted Volunteers be detached for a &#x27;desultory expedition against the Indian Villages at Au Glaize&#x27;...To Wayne&#x27;s utter disgust, one-third of Scott&#x27;s men — through no fault of Scott — simply decamped for home in mid November without order.&quot;

On December 24, 1793, Wayne dispatched a force to Ohio to establish Fort Recovery at the location of St. Clair&#x27;s defeat as a base of operations. Friendly Native Americans helped Wayne recover a cannon that the attackers had buried nearby, with its redeployment at the fort. The fort became a magnet for military skirmishes in the summer of 1794, with an attack led by Miami chief Little Turtle failing after two days and resulting in Blue Jacket becoming war leader. In response, the British built Fort Miami to block Wayne&#x27;s advance and to protect Fort Lernoult in Detroit. Wayne&#x27;s army continued north, building strategically defensive forts ahead of the main force. British officer Alexander McKee provided strategic battle advice to the western confederacy beforehand.

On August 3, 1794, a tree fell on Wayne&#x27;s tent at Fort Adams in northern Mercer County. He was knocked unconscious, but he recovered sufficiently to resume the march the next day to the newly built Fort Defiance on August 8, 1794. After observing Wayne&#x27;s activities for two years, Little Turtle declared that Wayne was &quot;the Chief that does not sleep&quot; and advised fellow Indians to answer calls for peace, though British agents and Blue Jacket were opposed. On August 20, 1794, Wayne mounted an assault on the Indian confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers near modern Maumee, Ohio, which was a decisive victory for the U.S. forces, effectively ending the war. It was later discovered that a British company under Lieutenant Colonel William Caldwell had dressed as Native Americans and participated in the battle. Following the battle, Wayne used Fort Defiance as a base of operations and under the direction of Washington&#x27;s policies, destroyed their villages and food stocks. Like many wars throughout history, the U.S. military essentially used a common war tactic known as scorched earth tactics in the later part of the campaign, destroying fields and homes of Native Americans as winter approached. Reporting on the progress, Wayne would write &quot;their future prospects must naturally be gloomy &amp; unpleasant&quot;.

The Native American troops attempted to find refuge at their British ally&#x27;s fort, known as Fort Miami. The British realizing their ally lost the battle, locked the doors and prevented refuge. Wayne then used Fort Deposit as a base of operations because of its proximity to Fort Miami and encamped for three days in sight of Fort Miami. Wayne attempted to provoke the fort&#x27;s commander, Major William Campbell, by destroying McKee&#x27;s post as well as Native American crops and villages within sight of Fort Miami before withdrawing. When Campbell asked the meaning of the encampment, Wayne replied that the answer had already been given by the sound of their muskets. The next day, Wayne rode alone to Fort Miami and slowly conducted an inspection of the fort&#x27;s exterior walls. The British garrison debated whether to engage Wayne, but in the absence of orders and with Britain already being at war with France, Campbell declined to fire the first shot at the United States. Neither Campbell nor Wayne was willing to be the one to start a second war, and the Legion finally departed for Fort Recovery.

Throughout the campaign, Wayne warned against future British attacks and planned for another large battle while the Legion was at full strength. When Wayne arrived at Kekionga unopposed on September 17, 1794, he razed the Miami capital and then selected it as the site for the new Fort Wayne. Wayne wanted a strong fort, capable of withstanding a possible attack by British artillery from Fort Detroit. Fort Wayne was finished by October 17 and was capable of withstanding 24-pound cannon. Although the British did not attack from the Northwest and Native Americans did not re-form into a large army, small bands continued to harass the Legion&#x27;s perimeter, scouts, and supply trains.

Wayne then negotiated the Treaty of Greenville between the tribal confederacy — which had experienced a difficult winter – and the United States, which was signed on August 3, 1795. The U.S. stated the land was already ceded to the French or British in previous wars. At the meetings, Wayne promised the land of &quot;Indiana&quot;, the remaining land to the west, to remain Indian forever. Wayne also supplied food and farming supplies as a good faith gesture. Wayne read portions of the Paris Treaty, informing them that the British were encouraging them to fight for land and forts the British already ceded to the United States.

While crops were planted and farmed again, Wayne&#x27;s promise of land and treaty were left vulnerable after his death. A Spanish spy Wilkinson would take command of his army. Citizens eventually continued to settle beyond the borders and the state of Ohio later entered into the Union in 1803. After Wayne&#x27;s death, settlers continued moving past the borders and pushing the Native American people who lived there further westward.

===Betrayal by Wilkinson===

When picking a general to lead the Legion of the United States, President Washington considered a few options, most notably Wayne and James Wilkinson. When thinking of his choices, Washington found Wayne to be, &quot;more active and enterprising than Judicious and cautious,&quot; and Wilkinson to be lacking experience, &quot;as he was but a short time in the Service.&quot; Throughout the campaign, Wayne&#x27;s second in command, General James Wilkinson, secretly tried to undermine him. Wilkinson wrote anonymous negative letters to local newspapers about Wayne and spent years writing negative letters to politicians in Washington, D.C. Wayne was unaware as Wilkinson was recorded as being extremely polite to Wayne in person. Wilkinson was also a Spanish spy at the time and even served as an officer. In December 1794, Wilkinson secretly instructed suppliers to delay rations and send just enough to keep the army alive in hopes of preventing progress. Secretary of War Henry Knox eventually alerted Wayne about Wilkinson, and Wayne began an investigation. Eventually, Spanish couriers carrying payments for Wilkinson were intercepted. Wayne&#x27;s suspicions were confirmed, and he attempted to court-martial Wilkinson for his treachery. However, Wayne developed a stomach ulcer and died on December 15, 1796; there was no court-martial. Instead Wilkinson began his first tenure as Senior Officer of the Army, which lasted for about a year and a half. He continued to pass on intelligence to the Spanish in return for large sums in gold.

==Death==

Wayne died during a return trip to Pennsylvania from a military post in Detroit. It has been speculated but never proven that Wilkinson had him assassinated by poison. Wilkinson is documented secretly undermining him throughout his later career, benefited from his death, and would replace him as commander after his death.

Wayne was buried at Fort Presque Isle, where the modern Wayne Blockhouse stands. His son, Isaac Wayne, disinterred the body in 1809 and had the corpse boiled to remove the remaining flesh from the bones. He then placed the bones into two saddlebags and relocated them to the family plot in the graveyard of St. David&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Wayne, Pennsylvania. The other remains were reburied but were rediscovered in 1878, giving Wayne two known grave sites.

==Legacy==
Wayne&#x27;s army overhaul and build up is considered the first attempt by the United States to provide formalized basic training for regular Army troops. His recruits and Legionville were the first facility established expressly for the purpose of a regular army.

President Theodore Roosevelt later praised Wayne as America&#x27;s best fighting general. Henry Cabot Lodge mentions with the exception of Washington, and perhaps Greene, that he was the best general the Americans developed in the contest.

Along with other Founding Fathers, Wayne&#x27;s reputation has been scrutinized for slavery and policies under Washington against Native American tribes. Shortly after the Northwest Indian War, Wayne died and his treaty was not enforced.

His skills as a military leader received mixed views by his contemporaries, some of whom he had personality clashes with. Historian and author of &quot;Unlikely General&quot; Mary Stockwell highlighted his decisive military victories while shedding light on his many personal flaws, being a spendthrift, womanizer, and heavy drinker. Some considered him impulsive, bad-tempered, and aggressive as a military leader with a fiery personality who advocated the tactics of Julius Caesar and Maurice de Saxe.

Several of Wayne&#x27;s uniforms, ranks, tactics and military legions exist today in the US Army. His legions were renamed regiments. One of them is now known as the Third Regiment of Infantry which is best known for its role in the changing-of-the-guard ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arlington National Cemetery.

A lunette above the door in the United States Senate room 128, designed originally to house the Senate Committee on Military Affairs and Militia, features a fresco by Constantino Brumidi named &quot;Storming at Stonypoint, General Wayne wounded in the head carried to the fort&quot;. On September 14, 1929, the U.S. Post Office issued a stamp honoring Wayne which commemorated the 135th anniversary of the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The post office issued a series of stamps often referred to as the &quot;Two Cent Reds&quot; by collectors, most of them issued to commemorate the 150th anniversaries of the many events that occurred during the American Revolution. The stamp shows Bruce Saville&#x27;s Battle of Fallen Timbers Monument.

In February 2019, the city council Fort Wayne, Indiana, approved the creation of Anthony Wayne Day by a vote of 6–3. The approval sparked debate, was criticized by other councilmen, reporters, and the Miami tribe. The Miami tribe, who maintain a strong connection with Fort Wayne as part of their ancestral homeland, objected to many of the facts put forward by supporters to champion Wayne. The Miamis were quoted, &quot;In a show of respect for Fort Wayne&#x27;s own sovereignty, the tribal council came to a decision: It would object to the resolution&#x27;s historical errors and omissions, but not to the honoring of Wayne himself.&quot;

The Wayne National Forest located in southeast Ohio was named in honor of General Wayne. It was established as a National Forest for the public in December 1992.

<text>Tatiana Gutsu, rarely Tetiana Hutsu, (, ; born 5 September 1976, in Odesa, Ukrainian SSR) is a Ukrainian former artistic gymnast from the Soviet Union and the winner of the all-around title in the 1992 Summer Olympics. She was renowned for performing some of the most difficult routines in the sport. She was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 2022.

==Career==
Born into a Ukrainian family with Moldovan roots, Gutsu started in gymnastics at age 6. She became a member of the national team of the Soviet Union in 1988. Her first major international competition was the 1991 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Indianapolis, where she won the team title with the Soviet Union and finished fifth in the individual all-around, while winning silver medals in two individual apparatus finals: the uneven bars and balance beam. Her silver on beam was highly controversial because the winner, Soviet teammate Svetlana Boginskaya, performed a simpler routine.

Gutsu was quickly noticed for the difficulty of her routines. She was one of the few gymnasts during the late 80s/early 90s to perform a double-twisting Yurchenko vault. She also debuted a double layout somersault on floor with split legs in the first salto, a skill that few others have been able to perform. Perhaps most impressively, she ended her floor routine in the team competition with a double layout somersault.

The following year, she had a disastrous showing at the 1992 World Championships. She had been expected to contend for gold on three events—uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise—but failed to reach the finals on any of them, suffering falls on both the bars and floor. However, at the European Gymnastics Championships that year, she won the all-around, vault, and uneven bars titles, as well as a silver on the balance beam. She was the most successful gymnast of the championship and established herself as one of the favorites for the Olympic all-around title.

=== 1992 Olympics ===
In the preliminary round of competition at the Olympics, Gutsu, then 15, fell from the balance beam and was ranked 9th in the all-around. She had been on course to win the optional portion of the team competition and was one of the favourites for the beam gold medal, but the fall meant she did not qualify for the beam final.

Although 36 gymnasts qualified for the all-around, only three competitors from each country were allowed in the final, and because of Gutsu&#x27;s fall, three other competitors from the Unified Team placed higher in the preliminaries. However, the team coaches felt that Gutsu had a better chance of bringing home all-around gold than her teammates Boginskaya and Rozalia Galiyeva. They considered scratching Boginskaya, but felt that she was too famous and there would be a scandal. As a result, they forced Gutsu&#x27;s younger teammate Galiyeva to forfeit her place in the final so that Gutsu could compete. Galiyeva was forced to claim a severe knee injury, which was &quot;verified&quot; by the team physician.

In one of the deepest fields ever for the all-around, Gutsu was in a close race for the gold medal. She had a few balance checks in her difficult beam routine and made an error on her double layout on floor, allowing her rivals to stay in contention with her. With one apparatus to go, Gutsu was tied for first place with Shannon Miller of the United States. Her final performance on vault (a full-twisting layout Yurchenko) was just enough to hold off Miller&#x27;s challenge. Gutsu won the title by .012, which remains the closest margin of victory ever in an Olympic all-around. She also took home medals in the team competition (gold), uneven bars (silver) and floor exercise (bronze).

What set Gutsu apart from Miller was her difficulty. She was competing during the height of the &quot;pixie&quot; era, when the favoured type of gymnast was a small athlete capable of extreme difficulty, and Gutsu exemplified this. She performed the same vault as most other leading gymnasts (except Tatiana Lysenko), but her difficulty on the other three events was high. Her beam routine was especially notable: she competed probably the most difficult dismount sequence of all time, three back handsprings into a tucked full-in, and also performed a standing back somersault with a full twist. On floor, Gutsu opened with a split-leg double layout and closed with a piked full-in. On bars, she dismounted with a double layout. Miller showed less difficulty, particularly on the floor exercise (where she performed a whip to tucked full-in for her mount, a whip to double pike for her middle pass, and a tucked full-in for her dismount), but was impressive on beam with her back handspring to three layouts sequence, her superior form, and a stuck full-in dismount.

Galiyeva was always angry and bitter about having given up her place in the all-around to Gutsu, feeling that she had had no option but to agree. The two split the prize money between them, but they stopped speaking after the Olympics. The substitution was against the rules (as Galiyeva&#x27;s injury was not genuine), but such switches were and are common in gymnastics, usually when a gymnast considered to be the best on the team makes a mistake in qualifications and thus finishes behind a teammate who is considered weaker. Other notable examples include the replacement of Alexandra Marinescu with Simona Amânar in the 1996 Olympics, and the Soviet coaches&#x27; removal of Olga Mostepanova and Irina Baraksanova for Elena Shushunova and Oksana Omelianchik in the 1985 World Championships. On both occasions, the gymnasts substituted in took a medal. Coaches now have the right to make such substitutions without having to falsify injuries.

After retiring from competitive gymnastics, Gutsu moved to the United States, where she is a gymnastics coach in Michigan. She tried for a comeback to compete at the 2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships as a three-event specialist (vault, beam, and floor), but was unsuccessful.

== Alleged rape ==
In October 2017, she accused former Soviet (Belarusian) gymnast Vitaly Scherbo of raping her when she was 15.

<text>KPMG International Limited (or simply KPMG) is a British multinational professional services network, and one of the Big Four accounting organizations, along with Ernst &amp; Young (EY), Deloitte, and PwC. The name &quot;KPMG&quot; stands for &quot;Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler&quot;. The initialism was chosen when KMG (Klynveld Main Goerdeler) merged with Peat Marwick in 1987.

KPMG is a network of firms in 145 countries with 275,288 employees. It has three lines of services: financial audit, tax, and advisory. Its tax and advisory services are further divided into various service groups. In the 21st century, various parts of the firm&#x27;s global network of affiliates have been involved in regulatory actions as well as lawsuits.

== History ==
=== Early years and mergers ===

In 1816, Robert Fletcher started working as an accountant and in 1839 the firm he worked for changed its name to Robert Fletcher &amp; Co. William Barclay Peat joined the firm in 1870 at 17 and became head of the firm in 1891, renamed William Barclay Peat &amp; Co. by then. In 1877, Thomson McLintock founded Thomson McLintock &amp; Co in Glasgow. In 1897, Marwick Mitchell &amp; Co. was founded by James Marwick and Roger Mitchell in New York City. In 1899, Ferdinand William LaFrentz founded the American Audit Co. in New York. In 1923, The American Audit Company was renamed FW LaFrentz &amp; Co.

In about 1913, Frank Wilber Main founded Main &amp; Co. in Pittsburgh. In March 1917, Piet Klijnveld and Jaap Kraayenhof opened an accounting firm called Klynveld Kraayenhof &amp; Co. in Amsterdam.

In 1925, William Barclay Peat &amp; Co. and Marwick Mitchell &amp; Co., merged to form Peat Marwick Mitchell &amp; Co.

In 1963, Main LaFrentz &amp; Co was formed by the merger of Main &amp; Co and FW LaFrentz &amp; Co. In 1969, Thomson McLintock and Main LaFrentz merged forming McLintock Main LaFrentz International and McLintock Main LaFrentz International absorbed the general practice of Grace, Ryland &amp; Co.

In 1979, Klynveld Kraayenhof &amp; Co. (Netherlands), McLintock Main LaFrentz (United Kingdom / United States), and Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft (Germany) formed KMG (Klynveld Main Goerdeler) as a grouping of independent national practices to create a strong European-based international firm. Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft CEO Reinhard Goerdeler (son of leading anti-Nazi activist Carl Goerdeler, who would have become Chancellor if Operation Valkyrie had succeeded) became the first CEO of KMG. In the United States, Main Lafrentz &amp; Co. merged with Hurdman and Cranstoun to form Main Hurdman &amp; Cranstoun.

In 1987, KMG and Peat Marwick joined forces in the first mega-merger of large accounting firms and formed a firm called KPMG in the United States and most of the rest of the world and Peat Marwick McLintock in the United Kingdom.

In the Netherlands, due to the merger between PMI and KMG in 1988, PMI tax advisors joined Meijburg &amp; Co. (The tax advisory agency Meijburg &amp; Co. was founded by Willem Meijburg, Inspector of National Taxes, in 1939). Today, the Netherlands is the only country with two members of KPMG International: KPMG Audit (accountants) and Meijburg &amp; Co (tax consultants).

In 1991, the firm was renamed KPMG Peat Marwick, and in 1999, the name was reduced again to KPMG.

In October 1997, KPMG and Ernst &amp; Young announced they would merge. However, while the merger to form PwC was granted regulatory approval, the KPMG/Ernst &amp; Young tie-up was later abandoned.

=== Recent history ===

In 2001, KPMG spun off its United States consulting firm through an initial public offering of KPMG Consulting, which was rebranded BearingPoint. In early 2009, BearingPoint filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The UK and Dutch consulting arms were sold to Atos in 2002.

In 2003, KPMG divested itself of its legal arm, Klegal and KPMG sold its Dispute Advisory Services to FTI Consulting.

KPMG&#x27;s member firms in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein merged to form KPMG Europe LLP in October 2007. These member firms were followed by Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, CIS (Azerbaijan, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Georgia), Turkey, Norway, and Saudi Arabia. They appointed joint Chairmen, John Griffith-Jones and Ralf Nonnenmacher.

In 2020, KPMG International Limited was incorporated in London, England.

In February 2021, KPMG UK appointed its first female leaders, replacing Bill Michael, who stepped aside after making controversial comments.

== Global structure ==
Each national KPMG firm is an independent legal entity and is a member of KPMG International Limited, a UK Limited Company incorporated in London, United Kingdom. KPMG International changed its legal structure from a Swiss Verein to a co-operative under Swiss law in 2003 and to a limited company in 2020.

This structure in which the Limited company provides support services only to the member firms is similar to other professional services networks. The member firms provide the services to the client. The purpose is to limit the liability of each independent member.

KPMG&#x27;s global chairman is Bill Thomas, former senior partner and CEO of Canadian member firm KPMG LLP.

Some KPMG member firms are registered as multidisciplinary entities that also provide legal services in certain jurisdictions.

In India, where regulations do not permit foreign auditing firms to operate, KPMG is licensed as an investment bank and carries out audits under the name of BSR &amp; Co, an auditing firm KPMG purchased after the 1992 liberalisation of the Indian economy.

Tax arrangements relating to tax avoidance and multinational corporations and Luxembourg which were negotiated by KPMG became public in 2014 in the so-called &quot;Luxembourg Leaks&quot;.

== Staff ==

KPMG had issued written audit reports for CMED from 2003 to 2008, and was replaced by PwC Zhong Tian in August 2009. &quot;Perhaps locking up 91 KPMG partners over Christmas may spur the firms to find a solution to this problem&quot;, said Professor Paul Gillis of Peking University&#x27;s Guanghua School of Management.

KPMG was severely reprimanded by the tribunal, and was ordered to appoint an independent reviewer to check a sample of previous cases for similar failings.

=== Microsoft tax evasion ===

It took years for the IRS to unravel the scheme, a &quot;Rube Goldberg machine that channeled at least $39 billion in profits to Puerto Rico&quot;.

===HBOS audit role===
The HBOS accounts were published in February 2008 and six months later HBOS had to be rescued by Lloyds Bank. One reason for undertaking an investigation into the audit, was that the audit did not reveal the HBOS Reading branch fraud. HBOS, and subsequently Lloyds Bank, accountant Sally Masterton wrote the Project Lord Turnbull Report which described how the Bank and other organizations reacted to the Reading Branch fraud. This report was highly critical of KPMG and stated, &quot;KPMG have not only just been negligent but their direct involvement in a number of material malpractices and violations regarding HBoS is fundamental and exposes them to claims in relation to misconduct, serious dereliction of duty and breach of regulatory and statutory duties.&quot; However, the audit was investigated by the FRC which concluded, &quot;there was not a realistic prospect that a tribunal would make an adverse finding against KPMG in respect of the matters within the scope of the investigation&quot;, and &quot;The firm&#x27;s work did not fall significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected of the audit, the test that a tribunal would apply&quot;.

===Carillion audit role===
In January 2018, it was announced that KPMG, auditor of collapsed UK construction firm Carillion, would have its role examined by the Financial Reporting Council, (FRC) and it was summoned to give evidence before two House of Commons select committees on 22 February 2018.

On 13 February 2018, the &#x27;Big 4&#x27; accountancy firms, including KPMG, were described by MP Frank Field as &quot;feasting on what was soon to become a carcass&quot; after collecting fees of £72m for Carillion work during the years leading up to its collapse. KPMG was singled out for particular criticism for signing off Carillion&#x27;s last accounts before a profit warning in July 2017: &quot;Either KPMG failed to spot the warning signs, or its judgement was clouded by its cosy relationship with the company and the multimillion-pound fees it received,&quot; said MP Rachel Reeves. Two out of three former Carillion finance directors had also worked for KPMG.

KPMG defended itself, saying that in the construction industry &quot;an accumulation of adverse events [...] can quite quickly cause a precipitous decline.&quot; KPMG chairman and senior partner Bill Michael said: &quot;It does not follow automatically from a company collapse either that the opinion of management was wrong, or that the auditor did a bad job.&quot;

On 22 February 2018, MPs contested evidence from KPMG (in one exchange MP Peter Kyle told KPMG partner Peter Meehan: &quot;I would not hire you to do an audit of the contents of my fridge&quot;). Rachel Reeves, chair of the business select committee, said:

Auditing is a multi-million-pound business for the Big Four. On this morning&#x27;s evidence from KPMG and Deloitte, these audits appear to be a colossal waste of time and money, fit only to provide false assurance to investors, workers and the public. [...] Carillion staff and investors could see the problems at the company but those responsible – auditors, regulators, and, ultimately, the directors – did nothing to stop Carillion being driven off a cliff.

The final report of the Parliamentary inquiry into Carillion&#x27;s collapse, published on 16 May 2018, criticised KPMG for its &quot;complicity&quot; in the company&#x27;s financial reporting practices:

KPMG audited Carillion for 19 years, pocketing £29 million in the process. Not once during that time did they qualify their audit opinion on the financial statements, instead signing off the figures put in front of them by the company&#x27;s directors. Yet, had KPMG been prepared to challenge management, the warning signs were there in highly questionable assumptions about construction contract revenue and the intangible asset of goodwill accumulated in historic acquisitions. These assumptions were fundamental to the picture of corporate health presented in audited annual accounts. In failing to exercise—and voice—professional scepticism towards Carillion&#x27;s aggressive accounting judgements, KPMG was complicit in them. It should take its own share of responsibility for the consequences.

The select committee chairs (Frank Field and Rachel Reeves) called for the government to overhaul its corporate governance system, saying the government &quot;lacked the decisiveness or bravery&quot; to do so, and described the big four accounting firms as operating as a &quot;cosy club&quot;. with KPMG singled out for its &quot;complicity&quot; in signing off Carillion&#x27;s &quot;increasingly fantastical figures&quot;.

KPMG said:
We believe we conducted our audit appropriately. However, it&#x27;s only right that following a corporate collapse of such size and significance, the necessary investigations are performed. Auditing large and complex businesses involves many judgments and we will continue to cooperate with the FRC&#x27;s ongoing investigation. ... We welcome any future review of our profession. If we consider how the profession has changed in the last decade […] it is clear there is a need for us to look closely at our business models.

In a June 2018 report on audit standards across eight accounting firms, the FRC identified &quot;failure to challenge management and show appropriate scepticism across their audits.&quot; It highlighted a decline in the quality of work undertaken by the Big Four, with KPMG performing the worst. There had, the FRC said, been an &quot;unacceptable deterioration&quot; in the quality of KPMG&#x27;s work, and the FRC would scrutinise KPMG more closely as a result. In October 2018, the FRC proposed reforms to tackle the &quot;underlying falling trust in business and the effectiveness of audit,&quot; and severely rebuked KPMG.

In November 2018, KPMG said it would no longer undertake consultancy work for FTSE 350 Index-listed companies if it was also auditing them, in an effort to &quot;remove even the perception of a possible conflict&quot; of interest.

The Carillion investigation followed FRC investigations into KPMG&#x27;s role at HBOS, Quindell and The Co-operative Bank. In July 2018, the FRC started an investigation into KPMG&#x27;s audit role at collapsed drinks merchant Conviviality.

In January 2019, KPMG announced it had suspended the partner that led Carillion&#x27;s audit and three members of his team; in August 2021, an FRC disciplinary panel was scheduled for 10 January 2022 to hear a formal complaint against KPMG and former KPMG partner Peter Meehan regarding the provision of allegedly false and misleading information concerning the 2016 Carillion audit. The tribunal convened to hear the formal complaint started on 10 January 2022. At the disciplinary hearing, KPMG&#x27;s UK chief executive Jon Holt said the firm had discovered misconduct by it staff in its own internal investigations, and immediately reported it to the FRC. Following the FRC tribunal, KPMG was fined £14.4m (one of the biggest penalties in UK audit history) for misconduct relating to its audit of Carillion and another firm, and received a &quot;severe reprimand&quot; from the regulator. KPMG were also ordered to pay £3.95m in costs. The tribunal heard allegations that KPMG staff created false meeting minutes and retroactively edited spreadsheets before sharing them. A further tribunal will consider penalties for individual KPMG staff, including partner Peter Meehan; the FRC recommended that he be banned for 15 years and fined at least £400,000. In July 2022, it was announced that he had been fined £250,000 and banned for ten years; three other former KPMG executives also received fines and lengthy bans. A junior member of KPMG staff, Pratik Paw—who, aged 25, had been the most junior member of the Carillion audit team—faced a &quot;life changing&quot; fine of £50,000 and a four-year ban, prompting critics to suggest that accounting firms should enable junior colleagues to challenge their superiors, so that low ranking workers are not blamed for accounting scandals. Ultimately, Paw was not fined or suspended but was severely reprimanded.

The FRC opened a second investigation into how KPMG audited Carillion&#x27;s accounts. The FRC&#x27;s first report, which found a number of breaches, was delivered to KPMG in September 2020; the FRC was awaiting a KPMG response before deciding whether to take enforcement action. In March 2021, KPMG was reported to be &quot;inching towards a financial settlement with regulators&quot; over its auditing of Carillion, with the FRC expected to impose a record fine, possibly around £25m, on KPMG for its failings.

In May 2020, the &quot;FT&quot; reported that the Official Receiver was preparing to sue KPMG for £250m over alleged negligence in its audits of Carillion. In May 2021, the liquidator secured funding for its legal action, with speculation that the likely damages claim could be as much as £2 billion. In February 2022, Sky News reported the Official Receiver&#x27;s claim would be in the range of £1bn-£1.5bn, with one source suggesting around £1.2bn. The OR&#x27;s negligence claim focuses on the value of major contracts which were not properly accounted for in audits in 2014, 2015 and 2016, resulting in misstatements in excess of £800m within Carillion&#x27;s financial reports. KPMG was said to have accepted management explanations for inflated revenue and understated cost positions. The OR had received legal advice that KPMG was answerable to Carillion&#x27;s creditors for a portion of their losses. KPMG said: &quot;We believe this claim is without merit and we will robustly defend the case. Responsibility for the failure of Carillion lies solely with the company&#x27;s board and management, who set the strategy and ran the business.&quot; The claim, for £1.3 billion (US$1.77 billion), accused KPMG of missing &quot;red flags&quot; during audits of Carillion, in one of the largest claims against an audit firm. In November 2022, the OR said: KPMG had &quot;failed to respond&quot; to Carillion allegations that it had failed to properly audit the accounting of 20 significant construction contracts. KPMG reiterated that Carillion&#x27;s failure was solely the fault of the company&#x27;s board and management. In February 2023, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that KPMG had settled the £1.3bn lawsuit brought by Carillion&#x27;s liquidators; details of the settlement were not made public.

In October 2023, the Financial Reporting Council fined KPMG UK £21 million, saying it had failed to follow &quot;the most basic and fundamental audit concepts&quot; and an &quot;unusually large number of breaches&quot; had been found. For three years before the collapse Carillion was not subject to reliable audits. KPMG UK will also pay legal costs of about £5.3 million. The previous year a £14.4m penalty had been imposed on KPMG UK for providing misleading information to the regulator.

===Alterations to past audit work===
In June 2019, KPMG was fined $50 million for altering its past audit work after receiving stolen data from accounting industry watch dog PCAOB. KPMG admitted to its mistakes and as a part of its settlement, it also agreed to hire an independent consultant to review its internal controls.

===2017 South African corruption scandal===

In 2017, KPMG was embroiled in related scandals involving the Gupta family. KPMG, whose history in South Africa dated back to 1895, and which had been part of the international organization since its founding in 1979, faced calls for closure, and an uncertain future, as a consequence of the damage done to the South African economy as a result of its activities.

KPMG had been working with a Gupta family company in the mining sector, Oakbay Resources and Energy, for 15 years prior to the revelations of corruption and collusion in 2016, at which point KPMG resigned. The full impact and financial profit that KPMG received is yet to be determined; however, at least one large company has terminated its services with KPMG due to its relationship with Oakbay.

In July 2017, after controversial documents were leaked by the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism, former chief executive of KPMG South Africa and the former partner that was responsible for audits related to the Gupta family, Moses Kgosana, withdrew from becoming the chairman of Alexander Forbes, a financial services firm.

In 2015, KPMG issued a controversial report that implicated former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in the creation of an illegal intelligence gathering unit of the South African Revenue Service (SARS). This report was seen by elements of the media to be part of a wider Gupta-linked state capture conspiracy, with the aim of forcing Gordhan out of his post. The report was withdrawn by KPMG in September 2017, earning the ire of the Commissioner of SARS, Tom Moyane.

After an internal investigation that found work done for the Gupta family fell &quot;considerably short&quot; of the firm&#x27;s standards and amid rising political and public backlash, KPMG&#x27;s senior leadership in South Africa, including its chairman Ahmed Jaffer, CEO Trevor Hoole, COO Steven Louw, and five partners, resigned in September 2017.

Save South Africa, a civil-society group, accused KPMG and UK PR firm Bell Pottinger of playing a &quot;central role in facilitating state capture&quot;. Numerous South African companies either fired KPMG in the immediate aftermath of the scandal, or were reconsidering their relationships with the firm with the international chairman of KPMG, John Veihmeyer, apologising for the conduct of the South African arm and the firm pledged to donate fees earned from Gupta businesses, as well as the withdrawn SARS report, to anti-corruption activities.

===Corporate theme song===
In 2001, a blogger named Chris Raettig discovered a number of &quot;corporate theme songs&quot;, including one for KPMG. He created a page for these songs, and included deep links to the MP3 files on the source servers. KPMG responded by sending a takedown notice to Raettig, reading: &quot;Please be aware such links require that a formal Agreement exist between our two parties, as mandated by our organization&#x27;s Web Link Policy.&quot; Raettig wrote publicly about this takedown notice, responding that &quot;my own organization&#x27;s Web link policy requires no such formal agreement.&quot; The chorus to the anthem reads: &quot;KPMG—We&#x27;re as strong as can be, A team of power and energy, We go for the gold, together we hold, Onto our vision of global strategy!&quot;

===KPMG Lower Gulf===
Controversies around KPMG Lower Gulf first emerged in July 2022, when staff at the UAE division accused the multinational firm of neglecting multiple complaints filed against the Emirati CEO Nader Haffar. The employees, including former workers, alleged Haffar of fostering a &quot;fear culture&quot;, where disagreeing with him led to employees getting &quot;immediately sidelined or fired&quot;. Concerns were also raised after Haffar appointed his brother-in-law, Talal Cheikh Elard, as the head of clients and markets without disclosing the relationship to the partners. Both Haffar and Elard were accused of shouting at staff, slamming fists on tables, and acting against employees expressing &quot;dissenting views&quot;. On 21 July, Haffar requested for a new election process for his position, which was to be governed by an external law firm.

The controversy resurfaced in September 2022, when the global bosses were urged to suspend Haffar, citing &quot;nepotism, cronyism and a culture of fear&quot; under his leadership. In an email sent to KPMG International’s top executives, ten capital partners at the firm’s UAE branch asked them to address the &quot;massive crisis&quot; in the local company. They also raised concerns over the falling profits, affecting their pay. The average profits per partners fell, while they were not paid bonuses for 2021 due to &quot;cash flow issues&quot;.

In October 2022, the Financial Times published a report in which dozens of employees described that unethical employment practices at KPMG Saudi Arabia were commonplace and had left expatriate staff fearing for their personal safety and struggling with their mental health. Several former employees witnessed colleagues being fired abruptly for no reason, and put this down to hostility towards westerners from the largely Arab leadership team at KPMG Saudi Arabia. Racial tensions within the firm were also a problem, with xenophobic language being used towards certain nationalities. The FT has viewed copies of three whistleblowing reports sent to KPMG International since 2018, alleging issues in Saudi Arabia practice, including wrongful terminations, failure to pay staff and concerns about personal safety in the region.

=== Silicon Valley Bank audit ===
Just 11 days before Silicon Valley Bank&#x27;s collapse on March 10, 2023, KPMG gave the bank a clean bill of health, and declared that it &quot;stood behind its audits of SVB&quot;.

== Sponsorship ==

The Swedish member firm was the main sponsor for Swedish biathlete Magdalena Forsberg, six-time world champion and two-time Olympic medalist. Forsberg was working as a tax consultant at the KPMG Sundsvall office parallel to her athletic career.

In February 2008, Phil Mickelson, ranked one of the best golfers in the world, signed a three-year global sponsorship deal with KPMG. As part of the agreement, Mickelson was to wear the KPMG logo on his headwear during all golf related appearances. The sponsorship lasted until 22 February 2022, when the two parties mutually split following comments in which Mickelson called Saudi Arabia &quot;scary&quot; but would overlook the country&#x27;s human rights controversies in the best interest of the PGA Tour.

The Canadian member firm sponsored skier Alexandre Bilodeau, who won the first gold medal for Canada on home soil in the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Alexandre&#x27;s father is a tax partner in the Montreal office.

In 2014, KPMG and McLaren Technology Group formed a ten-year strategic alliance to apply McLaren Applied Technologies&#x27; predictive analytics and technology to KPMG&#x27;s audit and advisory services. KPMG&#x27;s logo was also placed at the engine air intake of the McLaren F1 Team&#x27;s cars. KPMG terminated the partnership in 2017 and McLaren signed a similar partnership with competitor Deloitte.

Since 2016, KPMG has been strategic sponsor of Brain Bar, a Budapest-based, annually held festival on the future.

== Awards ==
KPMG ranked in the top two overall in Consultancy Rankings 2009 by OpRisk &amp; Compliance—in recognition of KPMG&#x27;s experience in risk management.

In 2011, the company was ranked second on the World&#x27;s Best Outsourcing Advisors—in recognition of the firm&#x27;s depth of experience, global reach and holistic approach. That same year, the company was inducted into Working Mother Hall of Fame after being honored for 15 years as one of Working Mother magazine&#x27;s 100 Best Companies for Working Mothers. KPMG was ranked number 13 in &quot;Consulting Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Best Firms to Work for in 2016.

In 2017, KPMG was ranked 29th on the &quot;Fortune&quot; list of 100 best companies to work for. That same year, KPMG, along with PwC, Deloitte, and PA Consulting Group, were among the UK&#x27;s 25 top companies to work for.

<text>Beeldenstorm () in Dutch and Bildersturm in German (roughly translatable from both languages as &#x27;attack on the images or statues&#x27;) are terms used for outbreaks of destruction of religious images that occurred in Europe in the 16th century, known in English as the Great Iconoclasm or Iconoclastic Fury. During these spates of iconoclasm, Catholic art and many forms of church fittings and decoration were destroyed in unofficial or mob actions by Calvinist Protestant crowds as part of the Protestant Reformation. Most of the destruction was of art in churches and public places.
The Dutch term usually specifically refers to the wave of disorderly attacks in the summer of 1566 that spread rapidly through the Low Countries from south to north. Similar outbreaks of iconoclasm took place in other parts of Europe, especially in Switzerland and the Holy Roman Empire in the period between 1522 and 1566, notably Zürich (in 1523), Copenhagen (1530), Münster (1534), Geneva (1535), and Augsburg (1537).

In England, there was both government-sponsored removal of images and also spontaneous attacks from 1535 onwards, and in Scotland from 1559. In France, there were several outbreaks as part of the Wars of Religion from 1560 onwards.

==Background==
In France, unofficial episodes of large scale destruction of art in churches by Huguenot Calvinists had begun in 1560; unlike in the Low Countries, they were often physically resisted and repulsed by Catholic crowds, but were to continue throughout the French Wars of Religion. In Anglican England much destruction had already taken place in an organized fashion under orders from the government, while in Northern Europe, groups of Calvinists marched through churches and removed images, a move which &quot;provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs&quot; in Germany and &quot;antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox&quot; in the Baltic region.
In Germany, Switzerland and England, conversion to Protestantism had been enforced on the whole population at the level of a city, principality or kingdom, with varying degrees of discrimination, persecution or expulsion applied to those who insisted on remaining Catholic. The Low Countries were part of the inheritance of Philip II of Spain, who was a devoted Catholic and supporter of the Counter-Reformation; he attempted to suppress Protestantism through his governor-general Margaret of Parma, the illegitimate daughter of Emperor Charles V, who was herself more willing to compromise. Protestants so far represented only a relatively small proportion of the Netherlandish population, but including disproportionate numbers from the nobility and upper bourgeoisie; nevertheless, but the Catholic Church had evidently lost the loyalty of the population, and traditional Catholic anti-clericalism was now dominant.

The region affected was perhaps the richest in Europe, but still seethed with economic discontent among parts of the population, and had suffered a poor harvest and hard winter. However, recent historians are generally less inclined to see the movement as prompted by these factors than was the case a few decades ago.
The Beeldenstorm grew out of a turn in the behaviour of Low Country Protestants starting around 1560, who became increasingly open in their religion, despite penal sanctions. Catholic preachers were interrupted in sermons, and raids were organized to release Protestant prisoners from jail, who then often fled into exile in France or England. Protestant views were spread by a large movement of &quot;hedgerow sermons&quot; or open-air sermons () held outside towns, and therefore out of the jurisdiction of the town authorities. The first took place on the &quot;Cloostervelt&quot; near Hondschoote, in what is now the arrondissement of Dunkirk in French Flanders, very close to where the attacks later began, and the first one to be armed against disruption was held near Boeschepe on 12 July 1562, two months after religious war had broken out again over the (then) French border just nearby.

These open-air sermons, mostly by Anabaptist or Mennonite preachers, spread through the country, attracting huge crowds, though not necessarily of those leaning to Protestantism, and in many places immediately preceded the iconoclastic attacks of August 1566. Prosecutions for heresy continued, especially in the south, although they were erratic, and in some places clergy of clearly heretical views were appointed to churches. By 1565 the authorities seem to have realized that persecution was not the answer, and the level of prosecutions slackened, and the Protestants became increasingly confident in the open. A letter of 22 July 1566 from local officials to the Regent, warned that &quot;the scandalous pillage of churches, monasteries and abbeys&quot; was imminent.

==Low Countries iconoclastic attacks in 1566==
On 10 August 1566, the feast-day of Saint Lawrence, at the end of the pilgrimage from Hondschoote to Steenvoorde, the chapel of the &quot;Sint-Laurensklooster&quot; (&quot;Saint Lawrence monastery&quot;) was defaced by a crowd who invaded the building. It has been suggested that the rioters connected the saint especially with Philip II, whose monastery palace of the Escorial near Madrid was dedicated to Lawrence, and was just nearing completion in 1566. Iconoclastic attacks spread rapidly northwards and resulted in the destruction of not only images but all sorts of decoration and fittings in churches and other church or clergy property. However, there was relatively little loss of life, unlike similar outbreaks in France, where the clergy were often killed, and some iconoclasts too.

The attacks reached the commercial centre of the Low Countries, Antwerp, on 20 August, and on 22 August Ghent, where the cathedral, eight churches, twenty-five monasteries and convents, ten hospitals and seven chapels were wrecked. From there, it further spread east and north, reaching Amsterdam, then a much smaller town, by 23 August, and continuing in the far north and east into October, although the main towns were mostly attacked in August. Valenciennes (&quot;Valencijn&quot; on the map) was the most southerly town attacked. In the east, Maastricht on 20 September and Venlo on 5 October saw attacks, but generally the outbreaks were restricted to more westerly and northern areas. Over 400 churches were attacked in Flanders alone.

The eye-witness Richard Clough, a Welsh Protestant merchant then in Antwerp, saw: &quot;all the churches, chapels and houses of religion utterly defaced, and no kind of thing left whole within them, but broken and utterly destroyed, being done after such order and by so few folks that it is to be marvelled at.&quot; The Church of Our Lady in Antwerp, later made the cathedral (illustrated at top): &quot;looked like a hell, with above 10,000 torches burning, and such a noise as if heaven and earth had got together, with falling of images and beating down of costly works, such sort that the spoil was so great that a man could not well pass through the church. So that in fine [short], I cannot write you in x sheets of paper the strange sight I saw there, organs and all destroyed.&quot;

Nicholas Sanders, an English Catholic exile who was a professor of theology at Louvain University, described the destruction in the same church:
... these fresh followers of this new preaching threw down the graven [sculpted] and defaced the painted images, not only of Our Lady but of all others in the town. They tore the curtains, dashed in pieces the carved work of brass and stone, brake the altars, spoilt the clothes and corporesses, wrested the irons, conveyed away or brake the chalices and vestiments, pulled up the brass of the gravestones, not sparing the glass and seats which were made about the pillars of the church for men to sit in. ... the Blessed Sacrament of the altar ... they trod under their feet and (horrible it is to say!) shed their stinking piss upon it ... these false bretheren burned and rent not only all kind of Church books, but, moreover, destroyed whole libraries of books of all sciences and tongues, yea the Holy Scriptures and the ancient fathers, and tore in pieces the maps and charts of the descriptions of countries.
Such details are corroborated by many other sources. Accounts of the actions of the iconoclasts from eyewitnesses and the records of the later trials of many of them make it clear that there was often a considerable element of carnival to the outbreaks, with much mockery of the images and fittings such as fonts recorded as the iconoclasts went about their work. Alcohol features largely in very many accounts, perhaps in some cases because in Netherlandish law being drunk could be regarded as a mitigating factor in criminal sentencing.

The destruction frequently included ransacking the priest&#x27;s house, and sometimes private houses suspected of sheltering church goods. There was much looting of common household goods from clergy houses and monasteries, and some street robberies of women&#x27;s jewellery by the crowd; after the images were smashed and the property occupied, &quot;men fed their stomachs in a carnivalesque indulgence of beer, bread, butter and cheese, while women carted off provisions for the kitchen or bedroom&quot;.
There are many accounts of rituals of inversion, in which the church sometimes stood for the whole social order. Children sometimes participated enthusiastically, and street games afterwards became play battles between &quot;papists&quot; and &quot;beggars&quot;. One child was killed in Amsterdam by a stone thrown in such a game. Elsewhere the iconoclasts seemed to treat their actions as a job of work; in one city the group waited for the bell rung to mark the start of the working day before beginning their work. The tombs and memorial inscriptions of the patriciate and nobility, and in some cases royalty, were defaced or destroyed in several places, although secular public buildings such as town halls, and the palaces of the nobility, were not attacked. In Ghent, on the one hand the memorial in a church to Charles V&#x27;s sister Isabel (and so Philip&#x27;s aunt) was carefully left alone, but a statue in the street of Charles V and the Virgin was destroyed.

The actions were controversial among Protestants, some of whom implausibly tried to blame Catholic agent provocateurs, as it became clear that &quot;the more popular elements of the dissident movement were out of control&quot;. Protestant ministers and activists returning from exile in England and elsewhere played a significant role, and individual wealthy Protestants were widely suspected of hiring men to do the work in some places, especially Antwerp.

In some rural areas gangs of iconoclasts moved across country between village churches and monasteries for several days. Elsewhere there were large crowds involved, sometimes locals, and sometimes from outside the area. In some places the nobility gave assistance, ordering the clearing of churches on their estates. Local magistracies were often opposed, but ineffective in stopping the destruction. In many towns the archer&#x27;s guild, who had a function in controlling public order, took no steps against the crowds.

In 1566, unlike the situation after the Eighty Years&#x27; War and today, Protestantism in the Low Countries was mainly concentrated in the south (roughly modern Belgium), and much weaker in the north (roughly now the Netherlands). Iconoclasm in the north began later, after news of the events in Antwerp was received, and was more successfully resisted by local authorities in some towns, though still succeeding in most. Once again socially prominent laymen often took the lead. In many places there were, or were later said to have been, false claims of official commissions from some local authority to perform the actions, and by the end of the outbreak some northern towns removed images by order of the local authority, presumably to prevent the disorder that would accompany a mob action.

Analysis of the records of the later trials shows a wide range of occupations, covering craftsmen and small tradespeople, especially in the textile trade, and also a variety of church employees, at a fairly low level. Where wealth and property are recorded, it is &quot;modest at best&quot;. But Weyn Ockers, executed with her maid after their trials in 1568 for their actions on the first day of the Amsterdam outbreak, was the well-off married daughter of a notary, and her husband&#x27;s house was in an expensive area. Her mother had been executed in the 1530s, after being involved in Anabaptist rioting.

==&quot;Stille beeldenstorm&quot; of 1581 in Antwerp==
Antwerp experienced a further period of iconoclasm in 1581, after a Calvinist city council was elected and purged the city&#x27;s clergy and guilds of Catholic office-holders. This is known as the &quot;quiet&quot; or &quot;stille&quot; &quot;beeldenstorm&quot;, as the removal of images was carried out by the institutions they belonged to, the council itself, churches and the guilds. Some images were sold rather than destroyed, but most seem to have been lost. In the summer of 1584 Antwerp was besieged by the Duke of Parma&#x27;s Spanish army, falling a year later.

==Artistic losses==

Rarely was any thought given to the artistic heritage of these cities in 1566, though families were sometimes able to protect the church monuments of their ancestors, and in Delft the syndics of the painters&#x27; Guild of Saint Luke were able to rescue the altarpiece by Maarten van Heemskerck, which the guild had commissioned only 15 years earlier.

The van Eycks&#x27; Ghent Altarpiece, then as now famous as a supreme example of Early Netherlandish painting and already a major tourist attraction, just restored in 1550, was saved by dismantling it and hiding it in the cathedral tower. A first attack on 19 August was deterred by a small number of guards. When a larger attack was made at night two days later the iconoclasts had provided themselves with a tree trunk as a battering ram, and succeeded in breaking through the doors.

By then the panels had been removed from the frame and hidden, with the guards, on the narrow spiral staircase up the tower, with a locked door at ground level. They were not detected and the crowd left after destroying what else they could find. The panels were then moved to the town hall, and only returned to view in 1569, by which time the elaborate frame had disappeared. The artistic and literary losses were elaborately described by Marcus van Vaernewyck in his journal, preserved in the Ghent University Library.

Despite militia guards, two of the three main churches in Leiden were attacked; in the Pieterskerk the choirbooks and altarpiece by Lucas van Leyden were preserved. In the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam an altarpiece with a central panel by Jan van Scorel and side panels painted on both sides by Maarten van Heemskerck was lost. The most important works of several painters, especially those like Pieter Aertsen who worked in Antwerp, were all destroyed, leading to a somewhat distorted view of the art history of the period. An altarpiece in Culemborg had been commissioned in 1557 from the painter Jan Dey, was then destroyed in 1566 and in 1570 recommissioned from Dey, apparently as a copy of the first. However the new work was only in place for five years before it was removed when the town went officially Calvinist.

==Consequences==

On 23 August Margaret of Parma, the Habsburg Regent or Governor-general, whose capital of Brussels was unaffected by the movement, agreed to an &quot;Accord&quot; with the group of aristocratic Protestant leaders known as the &quot;Compromise&quot; or &quot;Geuzen&quot; (&quot;Beggars&quot;), by which freedom of religion was granted, in exchange for allowing Catholics to worship unmolested and an end to the violence. Instead, &quot;the outbreak of the iconoclastic fury began an almost uninterrupted series of skirmishes, campaigns, plunder, pirate-raids, and other acts of violence. Not all areas suffered violence at the same time or to the same extent, but practically none remained unscathed.&quot;

Many elite Protestants were now alarmed by the forces unleashed, and some of the nobility began to shift towards support of the government. Implementing the somewhat vague terms of the agreement led to further tensions, and William of Orange, appointed by Margaret to resolve the situation in Antwerp, tried and failed to produce a wider settlement that all parties could live with. Instead unrest continued and the episode fed into the causes of the Dutch Revolt which was to erupt two years later.

On 29 August 1566 Margaret wrote a somewhat panicked letter to Philip, &quot;claiming that half the population were infected with heresy, and that over 200,000 people were up in arms against her authority&quot;. Philip decided to send the Duke of Alba with an army; he would have led them himself but was kept in Spain by other matters, especially the increasingly evident insanity of his heir, Carlos, Prince of Asturias. When Alba arrived the following year, and soon replaced Margaret as Governor-general, his heavy-handed repression, which included the execution of many convicted of iconoclastic attacks the summer before, only made the situation worse.

Antwerp was then Europe&#x27;s largest financial and international trading centre, taking as much as 75 or 80% of English exports of cloth, and the disturbances created serious and well-justified fears that its position as such was under threat. Sir Thomas Gresham, the English financier who arranged Elizabeth I&#x27;s borrowings, and whose agent in Antwerp was Clough, left London for Antwerp on 23 August, only hearing about the Antwerp attacks &quot;en route&quot;; he needed to roll-over 32,000 Flemish pounds and borrow another 20,000 to finance her expenses in Ireland. Dining with William of Orange on his arrival, he was asked if &quot;the English were minded to depart this town or not&quot;, and wrote to William Cecil, Elizabeth&#x27;s chief minister, &quot;in alarm that he &quot;liked none of their proceedings&quot; but &quot;apprehended great mischief&quot;, and urged that the English government &quot;should do very well in time to consider some other realm and place&quot; for marketing English products. It was a message that helped shape the course of events.&quot;

The English had found the Antwerp money market short of funds since earlier in the year, and now made use of Cologne and Augsburg as well, but as events unfolded in the next year, and the personal position of some leading lenders became precarious, the English found to their surprise that repayments were no longer pressed for, probably as the lenders were happy to keep their money abroad on loan to a secure borrower. The Dutch Revolt, which from 1585 onwards included a Dutch blockade of the River Scheldt leading to the city, was to finally destroy Antwerp as a major trading centre.
In many places there were attempts by Calvinist preachers to take over the ransacked buildings. These were usually repulsed in the period after the attacks. In the months afterwards there were attempted negotiations in many cities, by William of Orange and others, to allocate certain churches to accommodate the local Protestants, often divided into Lutherans and Calvinists. These had mostly failed within a few weeks, not least because Margaret&#x27;s government rejected them; she had already had an earlier attempt at compromise overruled by Philip a few months earlier, and been embarrassingly forced to retract a decree. Instead there was a wave of building or adapting Calvinist &quot;temples&quot;, though in the end none of these were to remain in use by the following year, and their layouts, which seem to have echoed early Swiss and Scottish Calvinist designs, are now largely unknown.

Once the revolt proper had started, there were many further instances of clearing churches, some still unofficial and disorderly, but as cities became officially Protestant, increasingly undertaken by official order, like the Amsterdam Alteratie (&quot;Alteration&quot;) of 1578. Altars, to which Calvinists, unlike Lutherans, took strong exception, were typically completely removed, and in some large churches, like Utrecht Cathedral, large tomb monuments put where they stood, partly to make their return more difficult if political conditions changed. As the Eighty Years&#x27; War concluded, in the cities and areas that had become Protestant, the old Catholic churches were nearly all taken over by the new established faith, the Calvinist Dutch Reformed Church, while other congregations were left to find their own buildings.

The bare and empty state of those churches left in Catholic hands after the hostilities eventually ended prompted a large programme of restocking with Catholic art, which had much to do with the vigour of Northern Mannerism and later Flemish Baroque painting, and many Gothic churches were given Baroque makeovers. In the north, now strongly Protestant, religious art largely disappeared, and Dutch Golden Age painting concentrated on a wide range of secular subjects, such as genre painting, landscape art and still-lifes, with results that might sometimes have surprised the Protestant ministers who initiated the movement. According to one scholar, this &quot;was not only a dramatic change in the function of art, it was the context in which our present concept of art, what the literary critic M. H. Abrams called &quot;art as such&quot;, first began to take shape&quot;, replacing a &quot;construction model&quot; where art theory concerned itself with how makers created their works, with a &quot;contemplation model&quot; concerned with the effect of finished works on a &quot;lone perceiver&quot; or viewer.

<text>Clare College is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England. The college was founded in 1326 as University Hall, making it the second-oldest surviving college of the University after Peterhouse. It was refounded in 1338 as Clare Hall by an endowment from Elizabeth de Clare, and took on its current name in 1856. Clare is famous for its chapel choir and for its gardens on the Backs (the rear of the colleges that overlook the River Cam). It is a registered charity.

==History==
The college was founded in 1326 by the university&#x27;s chancellor, Richard Badew, and was originally named &#x27;University Hall&#x27;. Providing maintenance for only two fellows, it soon hit financial hardship. In 1338, the college was refounded as &#x27;Clare Hall&#x27; by an endowment from Elizabeth de Clare, a granddaughter of Edward I, which provided for twenty fellows and ten students.

The college was known as Clare Hall until 1856, when it changed its name to &#x27;Clare College&#x27;. (A new &#x27;Clare Hall&#x27; was founded by Clare College as a postgraduate institution in 1966.)

Women were accepted as undergraduates in 1972, one of the first three previously all-male colleges to do so.

==Buildings==

===Old Court===

Clare&#x27;s Old Court, a Grade I listed building, was built between 1638 and 1715, with a long interruption for the English Civil War. The period spans the arrival of classicism into the mainstream of British architecture, such that its progress can be traced in the marked differences between the oldest wing to the north, which still has vaulting and other features in the unbroken tradition of English Gothic architecture, and the final southern block, which shows a fully articulated classic style.

The college&#x27;s chapel was built in 1763 and designed by Sir James Burrough, the Master of neighbouring Caius College. Its altarpiece is &quot;Annunciation&quot; by Cipriani.

Old Court frames King&#x27;s College Chapel in views from the Backs. 
===Clare Bridge===

Clare has a bridge over the River Cam and is the oldest of Cambridge&#x27;s current bridges. It was built of stone in 1640 by Thomas Grumbold and restored in 1969, and is a Grade I listed building.

Fourteen stone balls decorate it, one of which has a missing section. A number of apocryphal stories circulate concerning this – one cited by members of the college is that the original builder of the bridge was not paid the full amount for his work and so removed the segment to balance the difference in payment. A more likely explanation is that a wedge of stone cemented into the ball as part of a repair job became loose and fell out.

===Memorial Court===
Clare Bridge connects Old Court to Memorial Court, which was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott and dedicated in 1926. The new court, west of Queen&#x27;s Road, was conceived as a memorial to the Clare men who lost their lives in the First World War. The monumental arch which forms the entrance to the court accommodates a large bell and carries the names of Clare alumni who died in both world wars. Memorial Court is Grade II* listed,

Memorial Court was extended in the 1950s by the construction of Thirkill Court, and was later divided into two parts when the College&#x27;s Forbes Mellon Library was constructed in the centre of Memorial Court; the new courtyard created in the west was renamed Ashby Court.

===Lerner Court===
A new court, Lerner Court, designed by van Heyningen and Haward Architects, was opened in January 2008. It occupies the last piece of undeveloped land in the central area of the College next to Memorial Court and houses a lecture theatre, catering, fellows offices, residential accommodation and a student laundry.

===Castle Court ===
A detached area of student accommodation, Castle Court, is between Castle Street and Chesterton Lane, on Castle Hill, north of the city centre.

===Gallery===
==Student life==
In 1972 Clare College became one of the three male Cambridge colleges to admit female undergraduates (the other two being Churchill and King&#x27;s).
Clare is known as a musical college in Cambridge. Its choir has performed all over the world. Clare College Music Society is well known, particularly the orchestra. As well as jazz and comedy nights, Clare is known for Clare Ents, a student night held every Friday in term time. The night is popular with students across the university and in the past it has hosted such acts as Tinie Tempah, Bombay Bicycle Club and Chase and Status.

The college&#x27;s student newspaper is called &quot;Clareification&quot;.
Clare holds an annual May ball on the Monday of May Week in the middle of June.

===Clare Boat Club===
Clare Boat Club is the rowing club for current members of Clare College. There is a separate club, De Burgh Boat Club, for alumni. In 2012, Clare Boat Club had the highest membership relative to the size of its student body of any college-affiliated boat club in Cambridge, fielding six men&#x27;s VIIIs in the May Bumps competition.

==Academic performance==
The undergraduates of Clare College were 12th in the 2024 Tompkins Table, based on degree results.

Clare was in the top ten colleges in the Tompkins Table from 2000 to 2005. However, their performance in the following years (2006–09) was poorer, leaving them in 12th in 2006 and 18th in 2009. Their 2010 performance (8th position) however showed an increase of 10 places over their previous year&#x27;s performance, and in 2011 they reached fourth place. In 2018, Clare placed 16th out of 29 colleges recorded in the table. In 2019, it fell to 24th place. In 2022, it rose to 12th place.

Entrance into Clare College is competitive, with approximately five applicants per place. However, the high quality of applicants means that many of them are awarded places at other colleges through the Winter Pool. Of applicants in 2007, 151 were given offers by Clare, and a further 75 applicants were made offers at other Cambridge colleges.

<doc id="75964" wikidata="Q541658" url="?curid=75964" title="John III, Duke of Brabant">
<text>John III (; 1300 – 5 December 1355) was Duke of Brabant, Lothier (1312–1355) and Limburg (1312–1347 then 1349–1355), the last Brabant male to rule them. 

==Biography==
John was the son of John II, Duke of Brabant, and Margaret of England. In 1312, he succeeded his father as the duke of Brabant, in no small part due to his father&#x27;s Charter of Kortenberg. In an attempt to improve relations with France, John married Marie of Evreux.

==John and the towns of Brabant==
The early fourteenth century, a period of economic boom for Brabant, marks the rise of the duchy&#x27;s towns, which depended on imports of English wool for their essential cloth industry. During John&#x27;s minority, the major towns of Brabant had the authority to appoint councillors to direct a regency, under terms of the Charter of Kortenberg granted by his father in the year of his death (1312). The marital alignment with France was tested and failed as early as 1316, when Louis X requested John to cease trade with Flanders; the councillors representing the towns found this impossible, and in reprisal Louis prohibited all French trade with Brabant in February 1316. By 1356 his daughter and son-in-law were forced to accept the famous Joyous Entry, as a condition for their recognition, so powerful had the states of Brabant become.

==The French alliance, 1332–1337==
After his initial period of maintaining independent neutrality from both France and England failed, neighbouring sovereigns in the Low Countries, stimulated as a matter of policy by Philip VI of France, became John&#x27;s enemies; among the adversaries of John were the Count of Flanders, the prince-bishop of Liège, and counts of Holland and Guelders. In 1332, a crisis with the king of France arose over John&#x27;s hospitality to Robert, count of Artois, during his journey to eventual asylum at the English court. In response to French pressure John reminded Philip that he did not hold Brabant from him but from God alone. A brief campaign of a coalition of Philip&#x27;s friends came to a truce, followed by a pact at Compiègne by which John received a fief from Philip worth 2000 &quot;livres&quot; and declared himself a vassal of France. His oldest son, Jean, was betrothed to Philip&#x27;s niece, Princess Marie, and it was agreed that the Brabantian heir would complete his education at the French court in Paris and that Robert of Artois would be expelled from Brabant.

The support of France strengthened John&#x27;s hand with his feudal suzerain, the Holy Roman Emperor. Though he was technically the Emperor&#x27;s feudal vassal, John had been able to ignore Emperor Louis IV&#x27;s summons to join him in his intended invasion of Lombardy (1327). The separation of Brabant from the Empire was completed by the Burgundian dukes of Brabant in the fifteenth century.

Meanwhile, the princes of the Low Countries settled their differences and formed a coalition against Brabant with a defensive alliance in June 1333. War was briefly brought to the Duchy of Brabant in the summer of 1334, but resolved by a peace brokered by Philip at Amiens. The French king declared that John had to hand over the town of Tiel and its neighbouring villages Heerewaarden and Zandwijk to the count of Guelders and to betroth his daughter Marie to the count&#x27;s son, Reinoud.

==The English alliance, 1337–1345==
When Edward III of England decided to press his claim to the crown of France in 1337, John, who was his first cousin, became an ally of England during the first stage of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. King Edward&#x27;s diplomatic offensive to draw Brabant away from France, produced a sympathetic response from Duke John. Disrupting the staple connection between the towns of Flanders and the sources of English wool should divert it to the towns of Brabant, notably the recently established wool exchange. Edward protected Brabançon merchants in England from arrest or the confiscation of their goods, and he sweetened his offers with a promise of £60,000, an immense sum, and to make good any losses of revenue that might result from penalties by the king of France. The same month of July 1337 John promised Edward 1,200 of his men-at-arms in the event of an English campaign in France, Edward to pay their salary. In August Edward pledged not to negotiate with the king without prior consultation with the duke. The alliance, kept secret at John&#x27;s insistence, came into the open when Edward landed with his troops at Antwerp July 1338. John received the promised subsidy (March 1339) and agreed in June to betroth John&#x27;s second daughter, Margaret, to Edward, the Black Prince, heir to the English throne. Two seasons of inconclusive campaigning that ravaged the north of France left Edward penniless at the end of 1341; he returned home, and when he returned to the fray, it was to Brittany: he never returned to the Low Countries.

==The French alliance, 1345–1355==
Though John was requesting papal dispensation for the marriage of Margaret and the Black Prince in 1343, the alliance with England unravelled as Edward&#x27;s coffers emptied and his attentions turned elsewhere. In September 1345 representative of France and Brabant met at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye to sign preliminary agreements, and by a treaty signed at Saint-Quentin, June 1347, Brabant was retained as an ally by France. Margaret was now to marry Louis of Male, who had inherited the title of count of Flanders, but whose power over the Flemish communes was virtually nil. A point of dispute with the count of Flanders had been the Lordship of Mechelen, a strategic enclave within Brabant: it was agreed that it would now come under full Brabantian control. Despite the diplomacy of Edward, John remained true to his French commitments until his death in December 1355.

== Family ==
In 1311, as his father&#x27;s gesture of &quot;rapprochement&quot; with France, John married Marie of Évreux (1303–1335), the daughter of Prince Louis, Count of Évreux and Margaret of Artois. They had:
* Joanna, Duchess of Brabant (24 June 1322 – 1406), married first to William IV, Count of Holland and second to Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg.
* Margaret of Brabant (9 February 1323 – 1368), married at Saint-Quentin on 6 June 1347 Louis II, Count of Flanders, she is the ancestor of later dukes
* Marie of Brabant (1325 – 1 March 1399), Lady of Turnhout, married at Tervuren on 1 July 1347 to Reginald III of Guelders
* John of Brabant (1327–1335/36), married Marie of France (1326–1333), daughter of King Philip VI of France, but died soon after with no issue, buried in Tervueren.
* Henri of Brabant (d. 29 October 1349), Duke of Limburg and Lord of Mechelen in 1347. Died young and buried in Tervuren in 1349.
* Godfrey of Brabant (d. aft. 3 February 1352), Lord of Aarschot in 1346. Also died young and buried in Tervuren.

John also had a son born from Elisabeth Maria of Huldenberg (d. 1365), who founded the House of Brant: John I Brant, 1st Lord of Ayseau.

In 1355, after all of his three legitimate sons had died, John was forced to declare his eldest daughter Joanna his heiress, which provoked a succession crisis after his death. John III was buried in the Cistercian Abbey of Villers, Belgium.

<text>The Nutshell is a pub in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England, that until 2016 claimed to be the smallest pub in Britain, although this claim was challenged by several others, including the Smiths Arms at Godmanstone (since closed) and the Lakeside Inn in Southport.

The pub is certainly diminutive so that no more than ten or fifteen customers can drink inside at any one time. The pub measures . In 1984, a record number of 102 people squeezed into the pub.

The Nutshell has been trading as a pub since 1867, although the building is much older and formerly had other uses. Inside, the dried body of a black cat is displayed, It is around 400 years old and was discovered in 1935 during building work. In former times, the bodies of cats were often placed inside the structure of buildings to bring good luck to the building and its occupants.

The building has been Grade II listed since 1972.

<text>Simona Amânar (; born 7 October 1979) is a Romanian former artistic gymnast. She is the 2000 Olympic all-around champion, and a seven-time Olympic and ten-time World Championship medalist. Amânar helped Romania win four consecutive world team titles (1994–1999), as well as the 2000 Olympic team title. She has a vault named after her, one of the most difficult in women&#x27;s gymnastics, and was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 2007.

==Biography==
Simona Amânar is an ethnic Aromanian.

==Career==

===1994–1995===
In 1994, her first year on the senior national team, Amânar contributed to Romania&#x27;s team titles at the World and European Championships.

Amânar began to excel as an individual performer at the 1995 European Cup, placing second in the all-around behind Svetlana Khorkina of Russia and winning gold on both vault and floor exercise. At the 1995 World Championships, she helped Romania secure its second consecutive world team title and became co-champion on vault (with all-around winner Lilia Podkopayeva of Ukraine). Amânar&#x27;s powerful floor routine and vaults put her in the lead after two rotations in the all-around, but she dropped to fourth after an average uneven bars routine and a shaky balance beam routine.

===1996===
Amânar won a silver medal on vault at the 1996 World Championships, behind teammate Gina Gogean and ahead of Cuba&#x27;s Annia -Hatch.

At the 1996 Summer Olympics, Amânar was one of the front-runners for several individual medals, but her Olympics started inauspiciously when she fell off the beam during the compulsories. Though she later posted the highest all-around score in the optionals (39.387, her lowest score being a 9.800 on the balance beam), her combined compulsory and optionals scores put her fourth among her teammates, and she did not qualify for the final. However, in a scenario similar to the Unified Team&#x27;s substitution of Tatiana Gutsu for Rozalia Galiyeva at the 1992 Olympics, Amânar replaced her teammate Alexandra Marinescu in the all-around final. The Romanian head coach, Octavian Bellu, said that Amânar deserved to compete because she had worked harder and was a better athlete than Marinescu. Amânar ended up sharing the bronze medal with teammate Lavinia Miloşovici, behind Gogean.

In both the 1996 Olympic all-around and the 1995 World Championships all-around, Amânar failed to score over 9.800 on the floor exercise despite well-executed and difficult tumbling. In the Olympics, she scored a 9.887 in the team optionals (the highest score of the entire Olympics on any event, for men or women), but only a 9.737 in the all-around. She did not start from a 10.0 in the all-around—despite having the most tumbling bonus points of anyone at the Games—because her tour jeté half-turn (Strug), a C element, was not completed. Thus, she did not have enough simple A, B, and C skills, and much of her D- and E-rated tumbling had to count as easier elements to fulfill those requirements. Amânar did not perform a double turn in the team optionals or the all-around because it was not necessary as long as she completed her Strug. However, when she failed to complete the Strug, four of her six tenths in D and E elements had to count toward requirements, which left her with only .2 counting toward her bonus. Without the error, Amânar would have finished ahead of Gogean and Miloşovici.

In the event finals, Amânar completed her Strug and added a double turn to fulfill the more stringent Competition III requirements. She earned a 9.850 and the silver medal, behind Podkopayeva and just ahead of Dominique Dawes of the United States. She won the vault final the day before, largely because of her 9.875 score for her double-twisting Yurchenko vault. She left the 1996 Olympics with four medals, including Romania&#x27;s team bronze.

===1997–1999===
Romania won its third straight team title at the 1997 World Championships. Amânar again replaced a higher-scoring Marinescu in the all-around competition and won the silver medal behind Russia&#x27;s Khorkina, followed by a gold medal on vault.

In the 1999 World Championships, Amânar led the Romanian team to a fourth consecutive title (there was no Worlds competition in 1998). However, she fell off the bars during the all-around and placed well out of the medals. She also lost her vaulting title to Russia&#x27;s Elena Zamolodchikova, who dominated that event in the following years due to a more difficult second vault: a double-twisting Tsukahara. Amânar won her only medal of the competition on the floor, taking home the silver behind teammate Andreea Răducan.

===2000===
At the 2000 Summer Olympics, the Romanians edged out the Russians to take the team title—their first since 1984 and their first ever in a non-boycotted Olympics.

In the all-around, the vaulting horse was set too low by the Olympic organizers, and the favorite for the title, Svetlana Khorkina, fell on her signature vault. Several other gymnasts fell or stumbled because of the same problem. Many went on to make mistakes on their next event, knowing their medal chances were gone, only to be informed later of the error and their chance to vault again. The three Romanian women either managed to perform well on the faulty vault or vaulted after the mistake had been corrected. They swept the medals, with Răducan winning the gold, Amânar the silver, and Maria Olaru the bronze.

Răducan was subsequently found to have used a cold medicine containing a banned substance. Although her results in other events were allowed to stand, she was stripped of her all-around gold medal, which went to Amânar. Initially, Amânar refused to accept the medal, insisting that Răducan had rightfully earned the title. Olaru took the same stance when the silver was awarded to her. However, they eventually reconsidered and decided to bring the medals home to Romania as symbolic victories of the country. Amânar continued to insist, however, that Răducan was the true Olympic all-around champion. 

In the event finals, Amânar had the opportunity to defend her Olympic vault title from four years earlier. However, she stumbled badly while debuting a new vault (a 2 twisting laid-out Yurchenko, which was then named after her), and did not win a medal. She went on to win bronze on floor exercise after losing points for a step out of bounds on her last tumbling pass.

==Legacy==
Amânar ranks highly (117th) on the list of most medal gymnasts in the world, with 10 World and 7 Olympic medals. She played a large role in the four consecutive World team titles and Olympic title that established Romania as the top-ranked women&#x27;s gymnastics team in the world.

The Amanar vault involves a round-off entry onto the vaulting table followed by a laid-out salto with 2 twists. Amânar first competed this skill at the 2000 Olympics. It has a difficulty score of 6.5, 6.3 and 5.8 in the women&#x27;s 2009–2012, 2013–2016 and 2017–2020 Code of Points.

==Post-retirement==
Amânar retired in 2000, shortly after the Olympic Games. She married Cosmin Tabără, a lawyer, on 9 March 2002, in Timișoara, and gave birth to a son, Alexandru Iosif, five months later. She is the vice president of the Romanian Gymnastics Federation.

==Eponymous skill==
Amânar has one eponymous skill in the Code of Points, the Amanar vault.

<text>A sabre or saber ( ) is a type of backsword with a curved blade associated with the light cavalry of the early modern and Napoleonic periods. Originally associated with Central European cavalry such as the hussars, the sabre became widespread in Western Europe during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Lighter sabres also became popular with infantry of the early 17th century. In the 19th century, models with less curving blades became common and were also used by heavy cavalry.

The military sabre was used as a duelling weapon in academic fencing in the 19th century, giving rise to a discipline of modern sabre fencing (introduced in the 1896 Summer Olympics) loosely based on the characteristics of the historical weapon.

==Etymology==
The English &quot;sabre&quot; is recorded from the 1670s, as a direct loan from French, where &quot;sabre&quot; is an alteration of &quot;sable&quot;, which was in turn loaned from German &quot;Säbel&quot;, &quot;Sabel&quot; in the 1630s. The German word is on record from the 15th century, loaned from Polish &quot;szabla&quot;, which was itself adopted from Hungarian &quot;szabla&quot; (14th century, later &quot;szablya&quot;).
The spread of the Hungarian word to neighboring European languages took place in the context of the Ottoman wars in Europe of the 15th to 17th centuries. The spelling &quot;saber&quot; became common in American English in the second half of the 19th century.

The origin of the Hungarian word is unclear. It may itself be a loan from South Slavic (Serbo-Croatian &quot;&quot;, Common Slavic &quot;*sabľa&quot;), which would ultimately derive from a Turkic source. In a more recent suggestion, the Hungarian word may ultimately derive from a Tungusic source, via Kipchak Turkic &quot;selebe&quot;, with later metathesis (of &quot;l-b&quot; to &quot;b-l&quot;) and apocope changed to &quot;*seble&quot;, which would have changed its vocalisation in Hungarian to the recorded &quot;sabla&quot;, perhaps under the influence of the Hungarian word &quot;szab-&quot; &quot;to crop; cut (into shape)&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===

Though single-edged cutting swords already existed in the Ancient world, such as the ancient Egyptian and Sumerian sickle swords, these (usually forward instead of backward curving) weapons were chopping weapons for foot soldiers. This type of weapon developed into such heavy chopping weapons as the Greek Machaira and Anatolian Drepanon, and it still survives as the heavy Kukri chopping knife of the Gurkhas. However, in ancient China foot soldiers and cavalry often used a straight, single edged sword, and in the sixth century CE a longer, slightly curved cavalry variety of this weapon appeared in southern Siberia. This &quot;proto-sabre&quot; (the Turko-Mongol sabre) had developed into the true cavalry sabre by the eight century CE, and by the ninth century, it had become the usual side arm on the Eurasian steppes. The sabre arrived in Europe with the Magyars and the Turkic expansion. These oldest sabres had a slight curve, short, down-turned quillons, the grip facing the opposite direction to the blade and a sharp point with the top third of the reverse edge sharpened.

===Early modern period===

The introduction of the sabre proper in Western Europe, along with the term &quot;sabre&quot; itself, dates to the 17th century, via the influence of the &quot;szabla&quot; type ultimately derived from these medieval backswords. The adoption of the term is connected to the employment of Hungarian hussar (&quot;huszár&quot;) cavalry by Western European armies at the time. Hungarian hussars were employed as light cavalry, with the role of harassing enemy skirmishers, overrunning artillery positions, and pursuing fleeing troops. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, many Hungarian hussars fled to other Central and Western European countries and became the core of light cavalry formations created there. The Hungarian term &quot;szablya&quot; is ultimately traced to the northwestern Turkic &quot;selebe&quot;, with contamination from the Hungarian verb &quot;szab&quot; &quot;to cut&quot;.

The original type of sabre, or Polish &quot;szabla&quot;, was used as a cavalry weapon, possibly inspired by Hungarian or wider Turco-Mongol warfare.

The &quot;karabela&quot; was a type of &quot;szabla&quot; popular in the late 17th century, worn by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth nobility class, the &quot;szlachta&quot;. While designed as a cavalry weapon, it also came to replace various types of straight-bladed swords used by infantry. The Swiss sabre originated as a regular sword with a single-edged blade in the early 16th century, but by the 17th century began to exhibit specialized hilt types.

====Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====

In the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (16th–18th century) a specific type of sabre-like melee weapon, the &quot;szabla&quot;, was used. Richly decorated sabres were popular among the Polish nobility, who considered it to be one of the most important pieces of men&#x27;s traditional attire. With time, the design of the sabre greatly evolved in the commonwealth and gave birth to a variety of sabre-like weapons, intended for many tasks. In the following centuries, the ideology of Sarmatism as well as the Polish fascination with Oriental cultures, customs, cuisine and warfare resulted in the &quot;szabla&quot; becoming an indispensable part of traditional Polish culture.

===Modern use===

The sabre saw extensive military use in the early 19th century, particularly in the Napoleonic Wars, during which Napoleon used heavy cavalry charges to great effect against his enemies. Shorter versions of the sabre were also used as sidearms by dismounted units, although these were gradually replaced by fascine knives and sword bayonets as the century went on. Although there was extensive debate over the effectiveness of weapons such as the sabre and lance, the sabre remained the standard weapon of cavalry for mounted action in most armies until World War I and in a few armies until World War II. Thereafter it was gradually relegated to the status of a ceremonial weapon, and most horse cavalry was replaced by armoured cavalry from the 1930s onward.

Where horse-mounted cavalry survived into World War II it was generally as mounted infantry without sabres. However the sabre was still carried by German cavalry until after the Polish campaign of 1939, after which this historic weapon was put into storage in 1941.
Romanian cavalry continued to carry their straight &quot;thrusting&quot; sabres on active service until at least 1941.

====Napoleonic era====
Sabres were commonly used by the British in the Napoleonic era for light cavalry and infantry officers, as well as others. The elegant but effective 1803 pattern sword that the British Government authorized for use by infantry officers during the wars against Napoleon featured a curved sabre blade which was often blued and engraved by the owner in accordance with his personal taste, and was based on the famously agile 1796 light cavalry sabre that was renowned for its brutal cutting power. Sabres were commonly used throughout this era by all armies, in much the same way that the British did.

The popularity of the sabre had rapidly increased in Britain throughout the 18th century for both infantry and cavalry use. This influence was predominately from southern and eastern Europe, with the Hungarians and Austrians listed as sources of influence for the sword and style of swordsmanship in British sources. The popularity of sabres had spread rapidly through Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, and finally came to dominance as a military weapon in the British army in the 18th century, though straight blades remained in use by some, such as heavy cavalry units. (These were also replaced by sabres soon after the Napoleonic era.)

The introduction of &#x27;pattern&#x27; swords in the British army in 1788 led to a brief departure from the sabre in infantry use (though not for light cavalry), in favour of the lighter and straight bladed spadroon. The spadroon was universally unpopular, and many officers began to unofficially purchase and carry sabres once more. In 1799, the army accepted this under regulation for some units, and in 1803, produced a dedicated pattern of sabre for certain infantry officers (flank, rifle and staff officers). The 1803 pattern quickly saw much more widespread use than the regulation intended due to its effectiveness in combat, and fashionable appeal.

====Pattern 1796 light cavalry sabre====

The most famous British sabre of the Napoleonic era is the 1796 light cavalry model, used by troopers and officers alike (officers versions can vary a little, but are much the same as the pattern troopers sword). It was in part designed by the famous John Le Marchant, who worked to improve on the previous (1788) design based on his experience with the Austrians and Hungarians. Le Marchant also developed the first official British military sword exercise manual based on this experience, and his light cavalry sabre, and style of swordsmanship went on to heavily influence the training of the infantry and the navy.

The 1796 light cavalry sword was known for its brutal cutting power, easily severing limbs, and leading to the (unsubstantiated) myth that the French put in an official complaint to the British about its ferocity. This sword also saw widespread use with mounted artillery units, and the numerous militia units established in Britain to protect against a potential invasion by Napoleon.

====Mameluke swords====

Though the sabre had already become very popular in Britain, experience in Egypt did lead to a fashion trend for mameluke sword style blades, a type of Middle Eastern scimitar, by some infantry and cavalry officers. These blades differ from the more typical British ones in that they have more extreme curvatures, in that they are usually not fullered, and in that they taper to a finer point. Mameluke swords also gained some popularity in France as well. Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, himself carried a mameluke-style sword. In 1831, the &#x27;Mameluke&#x27; sword became the pattern sword for British generals, as well as officers of the United States Marine Corps; in this last capacity, it is still in such use at the present time.

====United States====
The American victory over the rebellious forces in the citadel of Tripoli in 1805, during the First Barbary War, led to the presentation of bejewelled examples of these swords to the senior officers of the US Marines. Officers of the US Marine Corps still use a mameluke-pattern dress sword. Although some genuine Turkish &quot;kilij&quot; sabres were used by Westerners, most &quot;mameluke sabres&quot; were manufactured in Europe; although their hilts were very similar in form to the Ottoman prototype, their blades, even when an expanded &quot;&quot; was incorporated, tended to be longer, narrower and less curved than those of the true &quot;kilij.&quot;

In the American Civil War, the sabre was used infrequently as a weapon, but saw notable deployment in the Battle of Brandy Station and at East Cavalry Field at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. Many cavalrymen—particularly on the Confederate side—eventually abandoned the long, heavy weapons in favour of revolvers and carbines.

The last sabre issued to US cavalry was the Patton saber of 1913, designed to be mounted to the cavalryman&#x27;s saddle. The Patton saber is only a saber in name as it is a straight, thrust-centric sword. A US War Department circular dated 18 April 1934 announced that the saber would no longer be issued to cavalry, and that it was to be completely discarded for use as a weapon. Only dress sabers, for use by officers only, and strictly as a badge of rank, were to be retained.

====Police====
During the 19th and into the early 20th century, sabres were also used by both mounted and dismounted personnel in some European police forces. When the sabre was used by mounted police against crowds, the results could be devastating, as portrayed in a key scene in &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;. The sabre was later phased out in favour of the baton, or nightstick, for both practical and humanitarian reasons. The Gendarmerie of Belgium used them until at least 1950, and the Swedish police forces until 1965.

==Dress uniform==

Swords with sabre blades remain a component of the dress uniforms worn by most national army, navy, air force, marine and coast guard officers. Some militaries also issue ceremonial swords to their highest-ranking non-commissioned officers; this is seen as an honour since, typically, non-commissioned, enlisted/other-rank military service members are instead issued a cutlass blade rather than a sabre. Swords in the modern military are no longer used as weapons, and serve only ornamental or ceremonial functions. One distinctive modern use of sabres is in the sabre arch, performed for servicemen or women getting married.

==Modern sport fencing==

The modern fencing sabre bears little resemblance to the cavalry sabre, having a thin, long straight blade. Rather, it is based upon the Italian dueling saber of classical fencing. One of the three weapons used in the sport of fencing, it is a very fast-paced weapon with bouts characterized by quick footwork and cutting with the edge. The valid target area is from the waist up excluding the hands.

The concept of attacking above the waist only is a 20th-century change to the sport; previously sabreurs used to pad their legs against cutting slashes from their opponents. The reason for the above waist rule is unknown, as the sport of sabre fencing is based on the use of infantry sabres, not cavalry sabres.

In recent years, Saber fencing has been developing in Historical European Martial Arts, with blades that closely resemble the historical types, with techniques based on historical records.

<text>A backsword is a type of sword characterised by having a single-edged blade and a hilt with a single-handed grip. It is so called because the triangular cross section gives a flat back edge opposite the cutting edge. Later examples often have a &quot;false edge&quot; on the back near the tip, which was in many cases sharpened to make an actual edge and facilitate thrusting attacks. From around the early 14th century, the backsword became the first type of European sword to be fitted with a knuckle guard.

The term &quot;backsword&quot; can also refer to the singlestick, which is used to train for fighting with the backsword, or to the sport or art of fighting in this fashion. Backswording was an alternative term for singlesticking tournaments in England.

Being easier and cheaper to make than double-edged swords, backswords became the favored sidearm of common infantry, including irregulars such as the Highland Scots, which in Scottish Gaelic were called the &quot;claidheamh cuil&quot; (back sword), after one of several terms for the distinct types of weapons they used. Backswords were often the secondary weapons of European cavalrymen beginning in the 17th century.

<doc id="75973" wikidata="Q461045" url="?curid=75973" title="Henry I, Duke of Brabant">
<text>Henry I (, ; c. 1165 – 5 September 1235), named &quot;The Courageous&quot;, was a member of the House of Reginar and first duke of Brabant from 1183/84 until his death.

==Early life==
Henry was possibly born in Leuven (Louvain), the son of Count Godfrey III of Louvain and his wife Margaret, daughter of Duke Henry II of Limburg. His father also held the title of a landgrave of Brabant, duke of Lower Lorraine and margrave of Antwerp. Henry early appeared as a co-ruler of his father. In 1180, he married Matilda of Boulogne, daughter of Marie of Boulogne and Matthew of Alsace and on this occasion received the County of Brussels from his father. He acted as a regent while Count Godfrey III went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem from 1182 to 1184.

==Career==
In 1183, Henry took the title of duke of Brabant. Upon the death of his father in 1190, King Henry VI confirmed the elevation of Brabant, while he &quot;de facto&quot; abolished the Duchy of Lower Lorraine by creating the empty title of a Duke of Lothier. Duke Henry sought to expand his power and soon picked several quarrels with the Count Baldwin V of Hainaut. He also was in opposition to the German king (emperor from 1191) when his brother Albert of Louvain was elected bishop of Liège and murdered shortly afterwards.

Further conflicts with Duke Henry III of Limburg and Count Otto I of Guelders followed, before in mid-1197 Henry of Brabant joined the Crusade of Henry VI as one of the leaders. In October of the same year he took part in the recapture of Beirut and, then moved to Jaffa with the crusaders: however, before reaching the city he got news of the death of the King of Jerusalem, Henry II, Count of Champagne, and he returned to Acre. Here he acted as regent until the arrival of the new king, Amalric II.

Back in Germany after the emperor&#x27;s death in September 1197, Duke Henry supported the election of the Welf candidate Otto IV, the fiancé of his daughter Maria, who rivalled with the Hohenstaufen scion Philip of Swabia. He fought against Philip&#x27;s seconders Count Dirk VII of Holland and Count Otto of Guelders, however, he switched sides in 1204, when he and King Philip II of France backed Philip against Otto. In 1208, after the assassination of Philip, Henry was proposed as successor by King Philip II. In the war which followed, he finally reached a reconciliation with Emperor Otto IV. Together they fought against King Philip in the 1214 Battle of Bouvines, but the two were defeated.

In 1213, Duke Henry also suffered a heavy defeat against the Bishopric of Liège in the Battle of Steppes. From 1217 to 1218 he joined the Fifth Crusade to Egypt.

Under Henry I, there was town policy and town planning. His attention went out to those regions that lent themselves to the extension of his sovereignty and in some locations he used the creation of a new town as an instrument in the political organisation of the area. Among the towns to which the duke gave city rights and trade privileges were &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and Eindhoven.

In 1234, he participated in the Stedinger Crusade. In 1235, Emperor Frederick II appointed Henry to travel to England to bring him his fiancée Isabella, daughter of King John of England. Henry fell ill on his way back and died at Cologne. He was buried in Saint Peter&#x27;s Church at Leuven where his Late Romanesque effigy can still be seen.

==Marriages==

Henry had six children by his first marriage with Mathilde of Boulogne:
# Maria (c. 1190–1260), married in Maastricht after May 19, 1214 Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor, married July 1220 William I, Count of Holland
# Adelaide (b. ), married 1206 Arnold III, Count of Looz, married 1225 William X of Auvergne (c. 1195–1247), married before April 21, 1251 Arnold van Wesemaele (d. aft. 1288)
# Margaret (1192–1231), married January 1206 Gerhard III, Count of Guelders (d. 1229)
# Mathilde (c. 1200–1267), married in Aachen in 1212 Henry VI, Count Palatine of the Rhine (d. 1214), married on December 6, 1214 Floris IV, Count of Holland
# Henry II of Brabant (1207–1248)
# Godfrey (1209–1254), Lord of Gaesbeek, married Marie van Oudenaarde

His second marriage was at April 22, 1213 in Soissons to Marie, daughter of King Philip II of France. They had two children:
# Ysabeau (Elizabeth) (d. October 23, 1272), married in Leuven March 19, 1233 Count Dietrich of Cleves, Lord of Dinslaken (c. 1214–1244), married 1246, Gerhard II, Count of Wassenberg (d. 1255)
# Marie, died young (d. 15 August 1224), and was buried at Affligem Abbey.

==Death, burial, and tomb==
In 1235, Henry I was commissioned by the German emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen to accompany the imperial fiancée Isabella Plantagenet from England to Germany. However, he died en route in Cologne, before he could complete his assignment.

His tomb in Saint Peter&#x27;s Church, Leuven is the oldest surviving of its kind. The image of Henry I has been idealized in the relief: he is depicted as a smiling young man. In addition, he lies on a high base, wears a long robe and the duke&#x27;s cloak, and holds a scepter; his left hand plays with the cord of the mantle. The archangels Raphaël and Michael wave the censer at his head. In addition to the tomb of Hendrik I van Brabant, there are also the tombs of his wife Mathilde van Boulogne and his daughter, Maria van Brabant.

Originally, the tomb was at the altar. This was a privilege reserved only for prominent families and high clergy. The initially Romanesque church was replaced by a Gothic church in the fifteenth century. It was then that Hendrik&#x27;s grave was moved and given a place of honor in front of the high altar. During the French occupation in the eighteenth century, the grave was destroyed and its remains were buried under the tower. 

Only in the mid-19th century was the burial monument restored and placed in the chapel of Saint John of Latheran. The bones of Hendrik I were dug up in 1929 and only a few decades later, namely in 1998, were they put back in the tomb. In the meantime, the monument has been relocated and is back in its original place: in front of the high altar.

<text>Defecation (or defaecation) follows digestion, and is a necessary process by which organisms eliminate a solid, semisolid, or liquid waste material known as feces from the digestive tract via the anus or cloaca. The act has a variety of names ranging from the common, like pooping or crapping, to the technical, e.g. bowel movement, to the obscene (&quot;shitting&quot;), to the euphemistic (&quot;doing number two&quot;, &quot;dropping a deuce&quot; or &quot;taking a dump&quot;), to the juvenile (&quot;making doo-doo&quot;). The topic, usually avoided in polite company, can become the basis for some potty humor.
Humans expel feces with a frequency varying from a few times daily to a few times weekly. Waves of muscular contraction (known as &quot;peristalsis&quot;) in the walls of the colon move fecal matter through the digestive tract towards the rectum. Undigested food may also be expelled within the feces, in a process called egestion. When birds defecate, they also expel urine and urates in the same mass, whereas other animals may also urinate at the same time, but spatially separated. Defecation may also accompany childbirth and death. Babies defecate a unique substance called meconium prior to eating external foods.

There are a number of medical conditions associated with defecation, such as diarrhea and constipation, some of which can be serious. The feces expelled can carry diseases, most often through the contamination of food. &quot;E. coli&quot; is a particular concern.
Before toilet training, human feces are most often collected into a diaper. Thereafter, in many societies people commonly defecate into a toilet. However, open defecation, the practice of defecating outside without using a toilet of any kind, is still widespread in some developing countries. Some people defecate into the ocean. First world countries use sewage treatment plants and/or on-site treatment.

==Description==
===Physiology===

The rectum ampulla stores fecal waste (also called stool) before it is excreted. As the waste fills the rectum and expands the rectal walls, stretch receptors in the rectal walls stimulate the desire to defecate. This urge to defecate arises from the reflex contraction of rectal muscles, relaxation of the internal anal sphincter, and an initial contraction of the skeletal muscle of the external anal sphincter. If the urge is not acted upon, the material in the rectum is often returned to the colon by reverse peristalsis, where more water is absorbed and the feces are stored until the next mass peristaltic movement of the transverse and descending colon.

When the rectum is full, an increase in pressure within the rectum forces apart the walls of the anal canal, allowing the fecal matter to enter the canal. The rectum shortens as material is forced into the anal canal and peristaltic waves push the feces out of the rectum. The internal and external anal sphincters along with the puborectalis muscle allow the feces to be passed by muscles pulling the anus up over the exiting feces.

===Voluntary and involuntary control===

The external anal sphincter is under voluntary control whereas the internal anal sphincter is involuntary. In infants, the defecation occurs by reflex action without the voluntary control of the external anal sphincter. Defecation is voluntary in adults. Young children learn voluntary control through the process of toilet training. Once trained, loss of control, called fecal incontinence, may be caused by physical injury, nerve injury, prior surgeries (such as an episiotomy), constipation, diarrhea, loss of storage capacity in the rectum, intense fright, inflammatory bowel disease, psychological or neurological factors, childbirth, or death.

Sometimes, due to the inability to control one&#x27;s bowel movement or due to excessive fear, defecation (usually accompanied by urination) occurs involuntarily, soiling a person&#x27;s undergarments. This may cause significant embarrassment to the person if this occurs in the presence of other people or a public place.

===Posture===

The positions and modalities of defecation are culture-dependent. Squat toilets are used by the vast majority of the world, including most of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. The use of sit-down toilets in the Western world is a relatively recent development, beginning in the 19th century with the advent of indoor plumbing.

==Disease==
Regular bowel movements determine the functionality and the health of the alimentary tracts in human body. Defecation is the most common regular bowel movement which eliminates waste from the human body. The frequency of defecation is hard to identify, which can vary from daily to weekly depending on individual bowel habits, the impact from the environment and genetic. If defecation is delayed for a prolonged period the fecal matter may harden, resulting in constipation. If defecation occurs too fast, before excess liquid is absorbed, diarrhea may occur. Other associated symptoms can include abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, and abdominal distention. Disorders of the bowel can seriously impact quality of life and daily activities. The causes of functional bowel disorder are multifactorial, and dietary habits such as food intolerance and low fiber diet are considered to be the primary factors.

=== Constipation ===

Constipation, also known as defecatory dysfunction, is difficulty experienced when passing stools. It is one of the most notable alimentary disorders that affects different age groups in the population. Common constipation is associated with abdominal distention, pain or bloating. Research has revealed that chronic constipation complied with higher risk of cardiovascular events such as coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke, while associating with an increasing risk of mortality. Besides dietary factors, psychological traumas and &#x27;pelvic floor disorders&#x27; can also cause chronic constipation and defecatory disorder respectively. Multiple interventions, including physical activities, &#x27;high-fibre diet&#x27;, probiotics and drug therapies can be widely and efficiently used to treat constipation and defecatory disorder.

=== Inflammatory bowel diseases ===

Inflammatory disease is characterized as long-lasting, chronic inflammation throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn&#x27;s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are two universal types of inflammatory bowel disease that have been studied over a century. They are closely related to different environmental risk factors, family genetics, and lifestyle choices such as smoking. Crohn&#x27;s disease has been found to be related to immune disorders particularly. Different levels of cumulative intestinal injuries can cause different complications, such as fistulae, damage of bowel function, symptom recurrence, disability, etc. Patients can be children or adults. Recent research shows that immunodeficiency and monogenic disorders are the causes in young patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. 

Common symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases differ by the infection level, but may include severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and unexpected weight loss. Crohn&#x27;s disease can lead to infection of any part of the digestive tract, including ileum to anus. Internal manifestations include diarrhea, abdomen pain, fever, chronic anaemia, etc. External manifestations include impact on skin, joints, eyes, and liver. Significantly reduced microbiota diversity inside the gastrointestinal tract can also be observed. Ulcerative colitis mainly affects the function of the large bowel, and its incidence rate is three times greater than that of Crohn&#x27;s disease. In terms of clinical features, over 90 percent of patients exhibit constant diarrhea, rectal bleeding, softer stool, mucus in the stool, tenesmus, and abdominal pain. The symptoms may continue for around 6 weeks or even longer.

The inflammatory bowel diseases could be effectively treated by &#x27;pharmacotherapies&#x27; to relieve and maintain the symptoms, which showed in &#x27;mucosal healing&#x27; and symptoms elimination. However, an optimal therapy for curing both inflammatory diseases are still under research due to the heterogeneity in clinical feature. Although both UC and CD are sharing similar symptoms, the medical treatment of them are distinctively different. Dietary treatment can benefit for curing CD by increase the dietary zinc and fish intake, which is related to mucosal healing of the bowel. Treatments vary from drug treatment to surgery based on the active level of the CD. UC can also be relieved by using immunosuppressive therapy for mild to moderate disease level and application of biological agents for severe cases.

===Irritable bowel syndrome===

Irritable bowel syndrome is diagnosed as an intestinal disorder with chronic abdominal pain and inconsistency in form of stool, and is a common bowel disease that can be easily diagnosed in modern society. The variation in incident rate can be explained by different diagnostic criteria in different countries, with the 18–34 age group being recognized as the high frequency incident group. The definite cause of irritable bowel syndrome remains a mystery; however, it has been found to relate to multiple factors, such as &#x27;alternation of mood and pressure, sleep disorders, food triggers, changing of dysbiosis and even sexual dysfunction&#x27;. One third of irritable bowel syndrome patients has family history with the disease suggesting that genetic predisposition could be a significant cause for irritable bowel syndrome.

Patients with irritable bowel syndrome commonly experience abdominal pain, changes to stool form, recurrent abdominal bloating and gas, co-morbid disorders and alternation in bowel habits that caused diarrhea or constipation. However, anxiety and tension can also be detected, although patients with irritable bowel disease seem healthy. Apart from these typical symptoms, rectal bleeding, unexpected weight loss and increased inflammatory markers require further medical examination and investigation.

Treatment for irritable bowel disease is multimodal. Dietary intervention and pharmacotherapies can both relieve the symptoms to a certain degree. Avoiding allergic food groups can be beneficial by reducing fermentation in the digestive tract and gas production, hence effectively alleviating abdominal pain and bloating. Drug interventions, such as laxatives, loperamide, and lubiprostone are applied to relieve intense symptoms including diarrhea, abdominal pain and constipation. Psychological treatment, dietary supplements and gut-focused hypnotherapy are recommended for targeting depression, mood disorders and sleep disturbance.

=== Bowel obstruction ===

Bowel obstruction is a bowel condition which is a blockage that can be found in both the small intestines and large intestines. Increase of contractions can relieve blockages; however, continuous contractions with decreasing functionality may lead to terminated mobility of the small intestines, which then forms the obstruction. At the same time, the lack of contractility encourages liquid and gas accumulation. and &quot;electrolyte disturbances&quot;. Small bowel obstruction can result in severe renal damage and hypovolemia. while evolving into &quot;mucosal ischemia and perforation&quot;. Patients with small bowel obstruction were found to experience constipation, strangulation and abdominal pain and vomiting. Surgical intervention is primarily used to cure severe small bowel obstruction condition. Nonoperative therapy included nasogastric tube decompression, water-soluble-contrast medium process or symptomatic management can be applied to treat less severe symptoms

According to research, large bowel obstruction is less common than small bowel obstruction, but is still associated with a high mortality rate. Large bowel obstruction, also known as colonic obstruction, includes acute colonic obstruction, where a blockage is formed in the colon. Colonic obstructions frequently occur within the elder population, often accompanied by significant &#x27;comorbidities&#x27;. Although colonic malignancy is revealed as the major cause of the colonic obstruction, volvulus has also been founded as a secondary common cause around the world. In addition, lower mobility, unhealthy mentality and restricted living environment are also listed as risk factors. Surgery and colonic stent placements are widely applied for curing colonic obstructions.

===Other===
Attempting forced expiration of breath against a closed airway (the Valsalva maneuver) is sometimes practiced to induce defecation while on a toilet. This contraction of expiratory chest muscles, diaphragm, abdominal wall muscles, and pelvic diaphragm exerts pressure on the digestive tract. Ventilation at this point temporarily ceases as the lungs push the chest diaphragm down to exert the pressure. Cardiac arrest and other cardiovascular complications can in rare cases occur due to attempting to defecate using the Valsalva maneuver. Valsalva retinopathy is another pathological syndrome associated with the Valsalva maneuver. Thoracic blood pressure rises and as a reflex response the amount of blood pumped by the heart decreases. Death has been known to occur in cases where defecation causes the blood pressure to rise enough to cause the rupture of an aneurysm or to dislodge blood clots (see thrombosis). Also, in releasing the Valsalva maneuver blood pressure falls; this, coupled with standing up quickly to leave the toilet, can result in a blackout.
== Society and culture ==
===Open defecation===
Open defecation is the human practice of defecating outside (in the open environment) rather than into a toilet. People may choose fields, bushes, forests, ditches, streets, canals or other open space for defecation. They do so because either they do not have a toilet readily accessible or due to traditional cultural practices. The practice is common where sanitation infrastructure and services are not available. Even if toilets are available, behavior change efforts may still be needed to promote the use of toilets.

Open defecation can pollute the environment and cause health problems. High levels of open defecation are linked to high child mortality, poor nutrition, poverty, and large disparities between rich and poor.

Ending open defecation is an indicator being used to measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal Number 6. Extreme poverty and lack of sanitation are statistically linked. Therefore, eliminating open defecation is thought to be an important part of the effort to eliminate poverty.

=== Anal cleansing after defecation ===

The anus and buttocks may be cleansed after defecation with toilet paper, similar paper products, or other absorbent material. In many cultures, such as Hindu and Muslim, water is used for anal cleansing after defecation, either in addition to using toilet paper or exclusively. When water is used for anal cleansing after defecation, toilet paper may be used for drying the area afterwards. Some doctors and people who work in the science and hygiene fields have stated that switching to using a bidet as a form of anal cleansing after defecation is both more hygienic and more environmentally friendly.

=== Mythology and tradition ===

Some peoples have culturally significant stories in which defecation plays a role. For example:
*In an Alune and Wemale legend from the island of Seram, Maluku Province, Indonesia, the mythical girl Hainuwele defecates valuable objects.
*One of the traditions of Catalonia (Spain) relates to the &quot;caganer&quot;, a figurine depicting the act of defecation which appears in nativity scenes in Catalonia and neighbouring areas with Catalan culture. The exact origin of the &quot;caganer&quot; is lost, but the tradition has existed since at least the 18th century.

=== Psychology ===
Some aspects of psychology surround the act of defecation. There is an inherent desire for privacy among humans. Freud stipulated a second stage of development, the Anal Stage, which centers around the release of waste from the bladder and bowels. He categorized two types: &quot;anal retentive&quot; and &quot;anal expulsive&quot;.

<doc id="75984" wikidata="Q565231" url="?curid=75984" title="Ran (film)">
<text>is a 1985 epic historical action drama film directed, co-written, and edited by Akira Kurosawa. The plot derives from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; and includes segments based on legends of the &quot;daimyō&quot; Mōri Motonari. The film stars Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora Ichimonji, an aging &quot;Sengoku&quot;-period warlord who decides to abdicate as ruler in favor of his three sons.

Like most of Kurosawa&#x27;s work in the 1970s and 80s, &quot;Ran&quot; is an international production, in this case a Japanese-French venture produced by Herald Ace, Nippon Herald Films, and Greenwich Film Productions. Production planning went through a long period of preparation. Kurosawa conceived the idea of &quot;Ran&quot; in the mid-1970s, when he read about Motonari, who was famous for having three highly loyal sons. Kurosawa devised a plot in which the sons become antagonists of their father. Although the film became heavily inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;King Lear&quot;, Kurosawa began using it only after he had started preparations for &quot;Ran&quot;. Following these preparations, Kurosawa filmed &quot;Dersu Uzala&quot; in 1975, followed by &quot;Kagemusha&quot; in the early 1980s, before securing financial backing to film &quot;Ran&quot;.

&quot;Ran&quot; was Kurosawa&#x27;s third encounter with Shakespeare during his career. In 1957, Kurosawa directed &quot;Throne of Blood&quot;, based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;. In 1960, he directed the film &quot;The Bad Sleep Well&quot;, based on &quot;Hamlet&quot;. All three films have received critical acclaim.

As Kurosawa&#x27;s last epic, &quot;Ran&quot; has often been cited as among his finest achievements and is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. With a budget of , it was among the most expensive films in the history of Japanese cinema upon its release. &quot;Ran&quot; was previewed on May 31, 1985, at the Tokyo International Film Festival before its release on June 1, 1985, in Japan. The film was hailed for its powerful images and use of color; costume designer Emi Wada won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design for her work on &quot;Ran&quot;, and Kurosawa received his only career nomination for Best Director. The distinctive film score, inspired by Gustav Mahler, was composed by Toru Takemitsu.

==Plot==
Hidetora Ichimonji, a powerful but elderly warlord, decides to divide his kingdom among his three sons: Taro, Jiro, and Saburo. Taro, the eldest, will receive the prestigious First Castle and become leader of the Ichimonji clan, while Jiro and Saburo will be given the Second and Third Castles. Hidetora is to retain the title of Great Lord and Jiro and Saburo are to support Taro. However, Saburo is exiled after criticizing his father&#x27;s lecture about unity. Hidetora&#x27;s retainer Tango is also exiled for defending Saburo.

Following the division of Hidetora&#x27;s lands between his remaining two sons, Taro&#x27;s wife, Lady Kaede, still bitter about Hidetora killing her family and taking their land, successfully urges him to usurp control of the entire Ichimonji clan. When Taro demands Hidetora renounce his title, Hidetora leaves and travels to Jiro&#x27;s castle, only to discover that Jiro is only interested in using Hidetora as a titular pawn. As Hidetora and his retinue wander, Tango warns Hidetora of Taro&#x27;s new decree: death to whoever aids his father. Hidetora plans to take refuge in the Third Castle, which was abandoned by Saburo&#x27;s forces (who followed him into exile) and taken over by Taro&#x27;s general Ogura. Hidetora feels they can take Ogura easily, whereas Kyoami, the court fool, jokes about Hidetora&#x27;s predicament, and is yelled at by Hidetora to stay behind if he is afraid. Kyoami and Tango stay outside while Hidetora and the rest of his retinue take refuge in the Third Castle, which they find unoccupied.

Later, Hidetora and his retinue are attacked by Taro and Jiro&#x27;s combined forces - Taro&#x27;s men had &quot;abandoned&quot; the castle to lure Hidetora into a false sense of security and ambush him. Taro is killed by a bullet fired by Jiro&#x27;s general, Kurogane. All of Hidetora&#x27;s retinue are either killed or commit ritual suicide. Hidetora is allowed to survive and succumbs to madness as he wanders away from the destroyed castle. Kyoami and Tango, still loyal to Hidetora, find him and stay to assist. Hidetora is haunted by visions of the people he killed in the past. They take refuge in a peasant&#x27;s home only to discover that the occupant is Tsurumaru, the brother of Lady Sue, Jiro&#x27;s wife. Tsurumaru&#x27;s eyes were gouged out by Hidetora&#x27;s forces and he was left impoverished due to Hidetora&#x27;s siege. With Taro dead, Jiro becomes the Great Lord of the Ichimonji clan, and moves into the First Castle. Lady Kaede manipulates Jiro into having an affair with her, and demands that he kill Lady Sue, and marry her instead. Jiro orders Kurogane to do the deed, but he refuses, seeing through Kaede&#x27;s perfidy. Kurogane then warns Sue and Tsurumaru to flee. Tango encounters former spies and before killing them, he is informed that Jiro is considering sending assassins after Hidetora. Tango rides off to alert Saburo. As his madness grows, Hidetora runs off into a volcanic plain.

After Saburo&#x27;s army enters Jiro&#x27;s territory to find Hidetora, Jiro hastily mobilizes his army. After a truce, Saburo learns from Kyoami of Hidetora&#x27;s potential location. After Saburo leaves, Jiro attacks Saburo&#x27;s smaller forces, suffering losses, and orders his remaining forces to retreat after learning of another army marching on the First Castle. Saburo finds Hidetora, who partially recovers his sanity, and reconciles with Saburo. However, Saburo is killed by one of Jiro&#x27;s snipers. Hidetora dies from grief. Tsurumaru and Sue arrive at the ruins of a castle, but inadvertently leave behind the flute that Sue gave him when he was banished. She gives him a picture of Amida Buddha for protection while she attempts to retrieve the flute. However, she never returns.

As the First Castle is besieged, Kurogane learns of Sue&#x27;s death, and confronts Kaede. After she confesses her plot was revenge against the entire Ichimonji clan, she is killed by Kurogane. Jiro, Kurogane, and all Jiro&#x27;s men subsequently die in battle. A funeral procession is held for Saburo and Hidetora. Meanwhile, left alone in the castle ruins, Tsurumaru trips, dropping the Amida Buddha image Sue had given to him. The film ends with a distant shot of Tsurumaru silhouetted against the castle&#x27;s landscape atop the ruins.

==Production==
&quot;Ran&quot; was Kurosawa&#x27;s last epic film and by far his most expensive. At the time, its budget of made it the most expensive Japanese film in history, leading to its distribution in 1985 exceeding the budget of $7.5 million for his previous film &quot;Kagemusha&quot;. It is a Japanese-French venture produced by Herald Ace, Nippon Herald Films, and Greenwich Film Productions. Filming started in 1983. The 1,400 uniforms and suits of armor used for the extras were designed by costume designer Emi Wada and Kurosawa, and were handmade by master tailors over more than two years. The film also used 200 horses. Kurosawa loved filming in lush and expansive locations, and most of &quot;Ran&quot; was shot amidst the mountains and plains of Mount Aso, Japan&#x27;s largest active volcano. Kurosawa was granted permission to shoot at two of the country&#x27;s most famous landmarks, the ancient castles at Kumamoto and Himeji. For the castle of Lady Sue&#x27;s family, he used the ruins of the custom-constructed Azusa castle, made by Kurosawa&#x27;s production crew near Mount Fuji. Hidetora&#x27;s third castle, which was burned to the ground, was a real building which Kurosawa built on the slopes of Mount Fuji. No miniatures were used for that segment, and Tatsuya Nakadai had to do the scene where Hidetora flees the castle in one take. Kurosawa also filmed a scene that required an entire field to be sprayed gold, but cut it out of the final film during editing. The documentary &quot;A.K.&quot; shows the filming of the scene.

Kurosawa often shot scenes with three cameras simultaneously, each using different lenses and angles. Many long-shots were employed and very few close-ups. On several occasions, Kurosawa used static cameras and suddenly brought the action into frame, rather than using the camera to track the action. He also used jump cuts to progress certain scenes, changing the pace of the action for filmic effect.

Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s wife of 39 years, Yōko Yaguchi, died during the production of the film. He halted filming for one day to mourn before resuming work. His regular recording engineer Fumio Yanoguchi also died late in production in January 1985.

===Development===
Kurosawa conceived of the idea that became &quot;Ran&quot; in the mid-1970s, when he read a parable about the Sengoku-period warlord Mōri Motonari. Motonari was famous for having three sons, all incredibly loyal and talented. Kurosawa began imagining what would have happened had they been bad. Although the film eventually became heavily inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;King Lear&quot;, Kurosawa became aware of the play only after he had started pre-planning. According to him, the stories of Mōri Motonari and Lear merged in a way he was never fully able to explain. He wrote the script shortly after filming &quot;Dersu Uzala&quot; in 1975, and then &quot;let it sleep&quot; for seven years. During this time, he painted storyboards of every shot in the film (later included with the screenplay and available on the Criterion Collection DVD release) and then continued searching for funding. Following his success with 1980&#x27;s &quot;Kagemusha&quot;, which he later considered a &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; or &quot;dry run&quot; for &quot;Ran&quot;, Kurosawa was finally able to secure backing from French producer Serge Silberman.

Kurosawa once said &quot;Hidetora is me&quot;, and there is evidence in the film that Hidetora serves as a stand-in for Kurosawa. Roger Ebert agrees, arguing that &quot;Ran&quot; &quot;may be as much about Kurosawa&#x27;s life as Shakespeare&#x27;s play&quot;. &quot;Ran&quot; was the final film of Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;third period&quot; (1965–1985), a time where he had difficulty securing support for his pictures, and was frequently forced to seek foreign financial backing. While he had directed over twenty films in the first two decades of his career, he directed just four in these two decades. After directing &quot;Red Beard&quot; (1965), Kurosawa discovered that he was considered old-fashioned and did not work again for almost five years. He also found himself competing against television, which had reduced Japanese film audiences from a high of 1.1 billion in 1958 to under 200 million by 1975. In 1968, he was fired from the 20th Century Fox epic &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; over what he described as creative differences, but others said was a perfectionism that bordered on insanity. Kurosawa tried to start an independent production group with three other directors, but his 1970 film &quot;Dodes&#x27;ka-den&quot; was a box-office flop and bankrupted the company. Many of his younger rivals boasted that he was finished. A year later, unable to secure any domestic funding and plagued by ill health, Kurosawa attempted suicide by slashing his wrists. Though he survived, his misfortune continued to plague him until the late 1980s. According to Stephen Prince, medical treatment and Mosfilm&#x27;s offer to make a film in Russia (&quot;Dersu Uzala&quot;) helped Kurosawa&#x27;s eventual &quot;spiritual recovery.&quot;

Kurosawa was influenced by the William Shakespeare play &quot;King Lear&quot; and borrowed elements from it. Both depict an aging warlord who decides to divide up his kingdom among his children. Hidetora has three sons – Taro, Jiro, and Saburo – who correspond to Lear&#x27;s daughters Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia. In both, the warlord foolishly banishes anyone who disagrees with him as a matter of pride – in Lear it is the Earl of Kent and Cordelia; in &quot;Ran&quot; it is Tango and Saburo. The conflict in both is that two of the lord&#x27;s children ultimately turn against him, while the third supports him, though Hidetora&#x27;s sons are far more ruthless than Goneril and Regan. Both &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Ran&quot; end with the death of the entire family, including the lord.

There are some crucial differences between the two stories. &quot;King Lear&quot; is a play about undeserved suffering, and Lear himself is at worst a fool. Hidetora, by contrast, has been a cruel warrior for most of his life: a man who ruthlessly murdered men, women, and children to achieve his goals. In &quot;Ran&quot;, Lady Kaede, Lady Sue, and Tsurumaru were all victims of Hidetora. Whereas in &quot;King Lear&quot; the character of Gloucester had his eyes gouged out by Lear&#x27;s enemies, in &quot;Ran&quot; it was Hidetora himself who gave the order to blind Tsurumaru. The role of the Fool has been expanded into a major character (Kyoami). Kurosawa was concerned that Shakespeare gave his characters no past, and he wanted to give his version of &quot;King Lear&quot; a history.

The complex and variant etymology for the word &quot;Ran&quot; used as the title has been variously translated as &quot;chaos&quot;, &quot;rebellion&quot;, or &quot;revolt&quot;; or to mean &quot;disturbed&quot; or &quot;confused&quot;.

===Filming===
The filming of &quot;Ran&quot; began in 1983. The development and conception of the filming of the war scenes in the film were influenced by Kurosawa&#x27;s opinions on nuclear warfare. According to Michael Wilmington, Kurosawa told him that much of the film was a metaphor for nuclear warfare and the anxiety of the post-Hiroshima age. He believed that, despite all of the technological progress of the 20th century, all people had learned was how to kill each other more efficiently. In &quot;Ran&quot;, the vehicle for apocalyptic destruction is the arquebus, an early firearm that was introduced to Japan in the 16th century. Arquebuses revolutionized samurai warfare. Kurosawa had already dealt with this theme in his previous film &quot;Kagemusha&quot;, in which the Takeda cavalry is destroyed by the arquebuses of the Oda and Tokugawa clans.

In &quot;Ran&quot;, the battle of Hachiman Field is an illustration of this new kind of warfare. Saburo&#x27;s arquebusiers annihilate Jiro&#x27;s cavalry and drive off his infantry by engaging them from the woods, where the cavalry are unable to venture. Similarly, Taro and Saburo&#x27;s assassination by a sniper also shows how individual heroes can be easily disposed of on a modern battlefield. Kurosawa also illustrates this new warfare with his camera. Instead of focusing on the warring armies, he frequently sets the focal plane beyond the action, so that in the film they appear as abstract entities.

===Casting===
The description of Hidetora in the first script was originally based on Toshiro Mifune. However, the role was cast to Tatsuya Nakadai, an actor who had played several supporting and major characters in previous Kurosawa films, such as Shingen and his double in &quot;Kagemusha&quot;. Other Kurosawa veterans in &quot;Ran&quot; were Masayuki Yui (Tango), Jinpachi Nezu (Jiro) and Daisuke Ryu (Saburo), all of whom were in &quot;Kagemusha&quot;. For Akira Terao (Taro) and Mieko Harada (Lady Kaede), &quot;Ran&quot; was their first Kurosawa film, but they would go on to work with him again in &quot;Dreams&quot;. Hisashi Igawa (Kurogane), who had previously been in Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Dodes&#x27;ka-den&quot;, would reappear in both &quot;Dreams&quot; and &quot;Rhapsody in August&quot;. Kurosawa also hired two popular entertainers for supporting roles: singer-dancer Shinnosuke &quot;Peter&quot; Ikehata as Hidetora&#x27;s loyal fool Kyoami and comedian-musician Hitoshi Ueki as rival warlord Nobuhiro Fujimaki. About 1,400 extras were employed.

===Acting style===
While most of the characters in &quot;Ran&quot; are portrayed by conventional acting techniques, two performances are reminiscent of Japanese Noh theatre. Noh is a form of Japanese traditional theatre requiring highly trained actors and musicians where emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures. The heavy, ghost-like make-up worn by Tatsuya Nakadai&#x27;s character, Hidetora, resembles the emotive masks worn by traditional Noh performers. The body language exhibited by the same character is also typical of Noh theatre: long periods of static motion and silence, followed by an abrupt, sometimes violent, change in stance. The character of Lady Kaede is also Noh-influenced. The Noh treatment emphasizes the ruthless, passionate, and single-minded natures of these two characters.

=== Music ===
Craig Lysy, writing for &quot;Movie Music UK&quot;, commented on the strengths of the film soundtrack&#x27;s composer for Kurosawa&#x27;s purposes: &quot;Tōru Takemitsu was Japan&#x27;s preeminent film score composer and Kurosawa secured his involvement in 1976, during the project&#x27;s early stages. Their initial conception of the score was to use tategoe, a &quot;shrill-voice&quot; chant style without instrumentation. Over the intervening years, Kurosawa&#x27;s conception of the score changed dramatically. As they began production his desire had changed 180 degrees, now insisting on a powerful Mahleresque orchestral score. Takemitsu responded with what many describe as his most romantic effort, one that achieved a perfect blending of Oriental and Occidental sensibilities.&quot;

Takemitsu has stated that he was significantly influenced by the Japanese karmic concept of &quot;ma&quot;, interpreted as a surplus of energy surrounding an abundant void. As Lysy stated: &quot;Takemitsu was guided in his efforts best summed up in the Japanese word &quot;ma&quot;, which suggests the incongruity of a void abounding with energy. He related: &#x27;My music is like a garden, and I am the gardener. Listening to my music can be compared with walking through a garden and experiencing the changes in light, pattern and texture.

The project was the second of two which allowed Kurosawa and Takemitsu to collaborate, the first being &quot;Dodes&#x27;ka-den&quot; in 1970. Lysy summarized the second project stating: &quot;the collaboration between Kurosawa and the temperamental Takemitsu was rocky. Kurosawa constantly sent Takemitsu notes, which only served to infuriate him, so he frequently visited the set to gain a direct sensual experience. Takemitsu actually resigned... Fortunately, producer Masato Hara intervened, made peace, and Takemitsu returned to the film. Years later, Takemitsu would relate: &quot;Overall, I still have this feeling of ... &#x27;Oh, if only he&#x27;d left more up to me&#x27; ... But seeing it now ... I guess it&#x27;s fine the way it is.

Kurosawa originally had wanted the London Symphony Orchestra to perform the score for &quot;Ran&quot;, but upon meeting conductor Hiroyuki Iwaki of the Sapporo Symphony Orchestra, he engaged Iwaki and the orchestra to record it. Kurosawa had the orchestra play up to 40 takes of the music. The running time of the soundtrack is just over an hour and was re-released in 2016 after its original release in 1985 by Silva Screen Productions. It was produced by Reynold da Silva and David Stoner.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Released on June 1, 1985, it was modestly successful financially in Japan. It earned ($12 million) in Japan, just enough to break even. In France, where it released on 18 September 1985, the film sold 813,081 tickets, grossing an estimated F ().

In the United States, where it released in December 1985, the film grossed $3,763,760 in its first four weeks of release. Later re-releases between 2000 and 2016 grossed $528,357 in the United States and Canada, bringing its total North American gross to .

In Germany, where it released in 1986, the film sold 222,862 tickets, grossing an estimated ($714,912). The film also grossed $18,692 in the United Kingdom, and $16,215 in Portugal, bringing the film&#x27;s total estimated gross to approximately worldwide.

===Critical reviews===

&quot;Ran&quot; was critically acclaimed upon its premiere. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 96%, based on 89 reviews, and an average rating of 9/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s sprawling, epic take on &quot;King Lear&quot; should be required viewing for fans of westerns, war movies, or period films in general.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 97 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Shawn Levy, of the &quot;Portland Oregonian&quot; wrote, &quot;In many respects, it&#x27;s Kurosawa&#x27;s most sumptuous film, a feast of color, motion and sound: Considering that its brethren include &quot;Kagemusha&quot;, &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; and &quot;Dersu Uzala&quot;, the achievement is extraordinary.&quot; Writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert said, &quot;&quot;Ran&quot; is a great, glorious achievement.&quot; In the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, G. Allen Johnson stated: &quot;Kurosawa pulled out all the stops with &quot;Ran&quot;, his obsession with loyalty and his love of expressionistic film techniques allowed to roam freely.&quot;

Writing for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Bob Graham stated: &quot;In &quot;Ran&quot;, the horrors of life are transformed by art into beauty. It is finally so moving that the only appropriate response is silence.&quot; Gene Siskel, writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, wrote: &quot;The physical scale of &quot;Ran&quot; is overwhelming. It&#x27;s almost as if Kurosawa is saying to all the cassette buyers of America, in a play on Clint Eastwood&#x27;s phrase, &#x27;Go ahead, ruin your night&#x27; – wait to see my film on a small screen and cheat yourself out of what a movie can be.&quot; Vincent Canby, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, stated: &quot;Though big in physical scope and of a beauty that suggests a kind of drunken, barbaric lyricism, &quot;Ran&quot; has the terrible logic and clarity of a morality tale seen in tight close-up, of a myth that, while being utterly specific and particular in its time and place, remains ageless, infinitely adaptable.&quot;

Roger Ebert awarded the film four out of four stars, with extended commentary, &quot;Kurosawa (while directing &quot;Ran&quot;) often must have associated himself with the old lord as he tried to put this film together, but in the end he has triumphed, and the image I have of him, at 75, is of three arrows bundled together.&quot; In 2000, it was inducted into Ebert&#x27;s Great Movies list.

Notoriously acerbic critic John Simon of the &quot;National Review&quot; wrote, &quot;I find it as an almost total failure by a genius in his old age&quot;.

Michal Sragow, writing for &quot;Salon&quot; in 2000, summarized the Shakespearean origins of the play: &quot;Kurosawa&#x27;s Lear is a 16th century warlord who has three sons and a career studded with conquests. Kurosawa&#x27;s genius is to tell his story so that every step suggests how wild and savage a journey it has been. At the start, this bold, dominating figure, now called Hidetora, is a sacred monster who wants to be a sort of warlord emeritus. He hopes to bequeath power to his oldest son while retaining his own entourage and emblems of command. He hasn&#x27;t reckoned with the ambition of his successor or the manipulative skill of his heir&#x27;s wife, who goes for the sexual and political jugular of anyone who invades her sphere.&quot; In 2009, the film was voted at No. 59 on the list of &quot;The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time&quot; by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo.

===Accolades===
&quot;Ran&quot; was completed too late to be entered at Cannes and had its premiere at Japan&#x27;s first Tokyo International Film Festival. Kurosawa skipped the film&#x27;s premiere, angering many in the Japanese film industry. As a result, it was not submitted as Japan&#x27;s entry for the Best Foreign Language Film category of the Oscars. Serge Silberman tried to get it nominated as a French co-production but failed. However, American director Sidney Lumet helped organize a campaign to have Kurosawa nominated as Best Director.

&quot;Ran&quot; was nominated for the Academy Awards for art direction, cinematography, costume design (which it won), and Kurosawa&#x27;s direction. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. In Japan, &quot;Ran&quot; was conspicuously not nominated for &quot;Best Picture&quot; at the Awards of the Japanese Academy. However, it won two prizes, for best art direction and best music score, and received four other nominations, for best cinematography, best lighting, best sound, and best supporting actor (Hitoshi Ueki, who played Saburo&#x27;s patron, Lord Fujimaki). &quot;Ran&quot; won two awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, for best foreign language film and best make-up artist, and was nominated for best cinematography, best costume design, best production design, and best screenplay–adapted. Despite its limited commercial success at the time of its release, the film&#x27;s accolades have improved greatly, and it is now regarded as one of Kurosawa&#x27;s masterpieces.

&quot;Ran&quot; won Best Director and Best Foreign Film awards from the National Board of Review, a Best Film award and a Best Cinematography award (Takao Saitō, Shōji Ueda, and Asakazu Nakai) from the National Society of Film Critics, a Best Foreign Language Film award from the New York Film Critics Circle, a Best Music award (Toru Takemitsu) and a Best Foreign Film award from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, a Best Film award and a Best Cinematography award from the Boston Society of Film Critics, a Best Foreign Feature award from the Amanda Awards from Norway, a Blue Ribbon Award for Best Film, a Best European Film award from the Bodil Awards, a Best Foreign Director award from the David di Donatello Awards, a Joseph Plateau Award for Best Artistic Contribution, a Director of the Year award and a Foreign Language Film of the Year award from the London Critics Circle Film Awards, a Best Film, a Best Supporting Actor (Hisashi Igawa) and a Best Director from the Mainichi Film Concours, and an OCIC award from the San Sebastian Film Festival.

In the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2002 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls of the greatest films ever made, &quot;Ran&quot; ranked 41st in director&#x27;s poll. In 2007, the film was ranked at No. 28 by &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s readers&#x27; poll on its list of &quot;40 greatest foreign films of all time&quot;. The film was selected in BBC&#x27;s list of 100 greatest foreign language films by 209 critics of 43 countries around the world in 2018.

<doc id="75985" wikidata="Q53448" url="?curid=75985" title="Henry III of France">
<text>Henry III (; ; ; 19 September 1551 – 2 August 1589) was King of France from 1574 until his assassination in 1589, as well as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1573 to 1575. 

As the fourth son of King Henry II of France, he was not expected to inherit the French throne and thus was a good candidate for the vacant throne of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he was elected monarch in 1573. During his brief rule, he signed the Henrician Articles into law, recognizing the szlachta&#x27;s right to freely elect their monarch. Aged 22, Henry abandoned Poland–Lithuania upon inheriting the French throne when his brother, Charles IX, died without issue.

France was at the time plagued by the Wars of Religion, and Henry&#x27;s authority was undermined by violent political factions funded by foreign powers: the Catholic League (supported by Spain and the Pope), the Protestant Huguenots (supported by England and the Dutch) and the Malcontents (led by Henry&#x27;s own brother the Duke of Anjou and Alençon, a party of Catholic and Protestant aristocrats who jointly opposed the absolutist ambitions of the king). Henry III was himself a , arguing that only a strong and centralised yet religiously tolerant monarchy would save France from collapse.

After the death of Henry&#x27;s younger brother Francis, Duke of Anjou, and when it became apparent that Henry would not father an heir, the Wars of Religion developed into a dynastic war known as the War of the Three Henrys. Under Salic Law, Henry III&#x27;s heir apparent was his distant cousin, King Henry III of Navarre, a Protestant. The Catholic League, led by Henry I, Duke of Guise, demanded the exclusion of all Protestant heirs from the line of succession. They instead championed the Catholic Charles, Cardinal of Bourbon, as Henry III&#x27;s heir presumptive.

Henry had the Duke of Guise murdered in 1588 and was in turn assassinated by Jacques Clément, a Catholic League fanatic, in 1589. He was succeeded by the King of Navarre who, as Henry IV, assumed the throne of France as the first king of the House of Bourbon and eventually converted to Catholicism.

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Henry was born at the royal Château de Fontainebleau, the fourth son of King Henry II and Catherine de&#x27; Medici. He was a grandson of Francis I of France and Claude of France. His older brothers were Francis II of France, Charles IX of France, and Louis of Valois. He was made Duke of Angoulême and Duke of Orléans in 1560, then Duke of Anjou in 1566.

He was his mother&#x27;s favourite; she called him &quot;chers yeux&quot; (&quot;precious eyes&quot;) and lavished fondness and affection upon him for most of his life. His elder brother, Charles, grew to detest him, partially because he resented his better health.

The royal children were raised under the supervision of Diane de Poitiers, his father&#x27;s mistress.

===Youth===

Although he was skilled and fond of fencing, he preferred to indulge his tastes for the arts and reading. These predilections were attributed to his Italian mother. Henry&#x27;s favourite interests were hunting and riding.

At one point in his youth Henry showed a tendency towards Protestantism as a means of rebelling. At the age of nine, he called himself &quot;a little Huguenot&quot;, attended Mass only to please his mother, sang Protestant psalms to his sister Margaret (exhorting her all the while to change her religion and cast her Book of Hours into the fire), and even bit the nose off a statue of Saint Paul. His mother firmly cautioned him against such behaviour, and he would never again show any Protestant tendencies. Instead, he became staunchly Catholic.

In the factional dispute that engulfed France in the wake of Henry II&#x27;s death in 1559, Henry was solicited by Henry, son of Francis, Duke of Guise, at the behest of Jacques, Duke of Nemours, to run away from court to be a figurehead for the ultra-Catholics. However, the plot was uncovered before any action could be taken.

Henry was known as a flaneur, who relished leisurely strolls through Paris and partook in the sociability in the busiest of neighbourhoods. He revelled in fairs, music, bilboquet and court masques. His extravagance in court entertainments cut him off from the common people. He was also a devout Catholic who introduced pious reforms into the city and he encouraged the French church to follow the edicts of the Council of Trent.

===Sexuality===

Reports that Henry engaged in same-sex relations with his court favourites, known as the &quot;mignons,&quot; date back to his own time. He was known to have enjoyed intense relationships with them. The scholar Louis Crompton maintains that all of the contemporary rumours were true. However, some modern historians dispute this: Jean-Francois Solnon, Nicolas Le Roux, and Jacqueline Boucher have noted that Henry had many famous mistresses, that he was well known for his taste in beautiful women, and that no male sex partners have been identified. They concluded that the idea he was homosexual was promoted by his political opponents (both Protestant and Catholic) who used his dislike of war to depict him as effeminate and undermine his reputation with the French people. The portrait of a self-indulgent homosexual, incapable of fathering an heir to the throne, proved useful in efforts by the Catholic League to secure the succession for Cardinal Charles de Bourbon after 1585.

However, French Renaissance scholar Gary Ferguson considers such interpretations to be unconvincing: &quot;It is difficult to reconcile the king whose use of favourites is so logically strategic with the man who goes to pieces when one of them dies.&quot; Katherine Crawford, by contrast, emphasizes the problems Henry&#x27;s reputation encountered because of his failure to produce an heir and the presence of his powerful mother at court, combined with his enemies&#x27; insistence on conflating patronage with favouritism and luxury with decadence.

===Elizabeth===
In 1570, discussions commenced arranging for Henry to court Queen Elizabeth I of England. Elizabeth, almost 37, was expected by many parties in her country to marry and produce an heir. However, nothing came of these discussions. In initiating them, Elizabeth is viewed by historians as having intended only to arouse the concern of Spain, rather than contemplate marriage seriously. Henry&#x27;s mother felt the chance of marriage despite differing religious views (Henry was Catholic, Elizabeth Protestant) simply required personal sacrifice. Henry tactlessly referred to Elizabeth as a (&quot;public whore&quot;) and made ridiculous remarks about their difference in age (he was 18 years younger at a time when such large age differences between spouses were not at all uncommon).

===Wars of Religion===
In November 1567, upon the death of Anne de Montmorency, Henry assumed the role of Lieutenant-General of France, placing him in nominal control of France&#x27;s military. Henry served as a leader of the royal army, taking part in the victories over the Huguenots at the Battle of Jarnac (March 1569) and at the Battle of Moncontour (October 1569). At this time he was a rallying point for the ultra-Catholics at court, who saw him as an opposition figure to the tolerant line being taken by the King, with Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine guiding his council. Lorraine offered him 200,000 Francs of Church revenue to become a protector of Catholicism, and tried to arrange his marriage to Mary, Queen of Scots; however neither project took off.

While still Duke of Anjou, he helped plot the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre of 1572. Though Henry did not participate directly, historian Thierry Wanegffelen sees him as the royal most responsible for the massacre, which involved the targeted killing of many Huguenot leaders. Henry III&#x27;s reign as King of France, like those of his elder brothers Francis and Charles, would see France in constant turmoil over religion.

Henry continued to take an active role in the Wars of Religion, and in 1572/1573 led the siege of La Rochelle, a massive military assault on the Huguenot-held city. At the end of May 1573, Henry learned that the Polish &quot;szlachta&quot; had elected him King of Poland (a country with a large Protestant minority at the time) and political considerations forced him to negotiate an end to the siege. Negotiators reached an agreement on 24 June 1573, and Catholic troops ended the siege on 6 July 1573.

==King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania (1574–1575)==
Following the death of the Polish ruler Sigismund II Augustus on 7 July 1572, Jean de Monluc was sent as the French envoy to Poland to negotiate the election of Henry to the Polish throne in exchange for military support against Russia, diplomatic assistance in dealing with the Ottoman Empire, and financial subsidies. Charles IX allowed Henry&#x27;s envoys to give up to 50,000 écus to important people in Poland-Lithuania as a bribe, but this would increase to 100,000 each.

On 16 May 1573, Polish nobles chose Henry as the first elected monarch of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Lithuanian nobles boycotted this election, however, and it was left to the Lithuanian ducal council to confirm his election. The commonwealth elected Henry, rather than Habsburg candidates, partly in order to be more agreeable to the Ottoman Empire (a traditional ally of France through the Franco-Ottoman alliance) and strengthen a Polish-Ottoman alliance that was in effect. In addition to this, Henry was not a powerful ruler in his own right, as he was only a Prince, nor did France border the Commonwealth, so he wouldn&#x27;t have the capacity to strip the Polish Nobility of their historic rights.

A Polish delegation went to La Rochelle to meet with Henry, who was leading the Siege of La Rochelle. Henry left the siege following their visit. In Paris, on 10 September, the Polish delegation asked Henry to take an oath, at Notre Dame Cathedral, to &quot;respect traditional Polish liberties and the law on religious freedom that had been passed during the interregnum&quot;. As a condition of his election, he was compelled to sign the &quot;pacta conventa&quot; and the Henrician Articles, pledging religious tolerance in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Henry chafed at the restrictions on monarchic power under the Polish-Lithuanian political system of &quot;Golden Liberty&quot;. The Polish-Lithuanian parliament had been urged by Anna Jagiellon, the sister of the recently deceased king Sigismund II Augustus, to elect him based on the understanding that Henry would wed Anna afterward.

At a ceremony before the Parlement of Paris on 13 September, the Polish delegation handed over the &quot;certificate of election to the throne of Poland-Lithuania&quot;. Henry also gave up any claims to succession and he &quot;recognized the principle of free election&quot; under the Henrician Articles and the &quot;pacta conventa&quot;.

It was not until January 1574 that Henry was to reach the borders of Poland. On 21 February, Henry&#x27;s coronation was held in Kraków. In mid-June 1574, upon learning of the death of his brother Charles IX, Henry left Poland and headed back to France. Henry&#x27;s absence provoked a constitutional crisis that the Parliament attempted to resolve by notifying Henry that his throne would be lost if he did not return from France by 12 May 1575. His failure to return caused Parliament to declare his throne vacant.

The short reign of Henry at Wawel Castle in Poland was marked by a clash of cultures between the Polish and the French. The young king and his followers were astonished by several Polish practices and disappointed by the rural poverty and harsh climate of the country. The Poles, on the other hand, wondered if all Frenchmen were as concerned with their appearance as their new king appeared to be.

In many aspects, Polish culture had a positive influence on France. At Wawel, the French were introduced to new technologies of septic facilities, in which litter (excrement) was taken outside the castle walls. On returning to France, Henry wanted to order the construction of such facilities at the Louvre and other palaces. Other inventions introduced to the French by the Polish included a bath with regulated hot and cold water as well as dining forks.

In 1578, Henry created the Order of the Holy Spirit to commemorate his becoming first King of Poland and later King of France on the Feast of Pentecost and gave it precedence over the earlier Order of St. Michael, which had lost much of its original prestige by being awarded too frequently and too readily. The Order would retain its prestige as the premier chivalric order of France until the end of the French monarchy.

==French reign (1574–1589)==
Henry was crowned king of France on 13 February 1575 at Reims Cathedral. Although he was expected to produce an heir after he married the 21-year-old Louise of Lorraine on 14 February 1575, no issue resulted from their union.

In 1574, Henry renewed letters that gave Portuguese New Christians the right of settling in France.

In 1576, Henry signed the Edict of Beaulieu, which granted many concessions to the Huguenots. His action resulted in Henry I, Duke of Guise, forming the Catholic League. After much posturing and negotiations, Henry was forced to rescind most of the concessions that had been made to the Protestants in the edict.

After 1582, Henry became convinced of the need for fiscal reform to break the cycle of expedients upon which he had relied. To this end he summoned an Assembly of Notables which met from November 1583 to February 1584. While he failed to convince them of his most radical tax plans, the notables forwarded a series of proposals to him which would be embodied in his legislation during 1584. As a result of these policies the royal budget was almost balanced in 1585, before it was subject to political shock.

In 1584, the king&#x27;s youngest brother and heir presumptive, Francis, Duke of Anjou, died. Under Salic Law, the next heir to the throne was Protestant Henry of Navarre, a descendant of Louis IX (Saint Louis). The possibility of a Protestant on the throne led to the War of the Three Henrys. Under pressure from the duke of Guise, Henry III issued an edict suppressing Protestantism and annulling Henry of Navarre&#x27;s right to the throne.

Henry III, stung by the open disobedience of Guise, attempted a coup in May 1588 and sent royal Swiss troops into several neighbourhoods. This had the unintended effect of rallying the people against him and in favor of the more popular Guise during the Day of the Barricades. Henry III fled the city; he later sought support from the Parlement of Paris and propped up an anti-League establishment throughout France.

Following the defeat of the Spanish Armada that summer, the king&#x27;s fear of Spanish support for the Catholic League apparently waned. Accordingly, on 23 December 1588, at the Château of Blois, he invited Guise to the council chamber where the duke&#x27;s brother Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, already waited. The duke was told that the king wished to see him in the private room adjoining the royal bedroom. There, royal guardsmen murdered the duke, then the cardinal. To make certain that no contender for the French throne was free to act against him, the king had the duke&#x27;s son imprisoned. The duke of Guise had been very popular in France, and the citizenry turned against Henry for the murders. The Parlement instituted criminal charges against the king, and he was compelled to join forces with his heir, the Protestant Henry of Navarre, by setting up the Parliament of Tours.

By 1589 Henry&#x27;s popularity hit a new low. Preachers were calling for his assassination and labelling him a tyrant. The people of Paris disdained him for his court extravagances, allowing corruption to grow rife, high taxes and having relied extensively on Italian financiers. But what most Parisians hated most about him was his alleged sexuality.
===Overseas relations===
Under Henry, France named Guillaume Bérard as the first Consul of France in Morocco. The request came from the Moroccan prince Abd al-Malik, who had been saved by Bérard, a doctor by profession, during an epidemic in Constantinople and wished to retain Bérard in his service.

Henry III encouraged the exploration and development of New World territories. In 1588, he granted Jacques Noël, the nephew of Jacques Cartier, privileges over fishing, fur trading, and mining in New France.
==Death==

On 1 August 1589, Henry III lodged with his army at Saint-Cloud, and was preparing to attack Paris, when a young fanatical Dominican friar, Jacques Clément, carrying false papers, was granted access to deliver important documents to the king. The friar gave the king a bundle of papers and stated that he had a secret message to deliver. The king signaled for his attendants to step back for privacy, and Clément whispered in his ear while plunging a knife into his abdomen. Clément was then killed on the spot by the guards.

At first, the king&#x27;s wound did not appear fatal, but he enjoined all the officers around him, in case he did not survive, to be loyal to Henry of Navarre as their new king. The following morning, on the day that he was to have launched his assault to retake Paris, Henry III died.

Chaos swept the attacking army, most of it quickly melting away; the proposed attack on Paris was postponed. Inside the city, joy at the news of Henry III&#x27;s death was near delirium; some hailed the assassination as an act of God.

===Burial===
Henry III was interred at the Saint Denis Basilica. Childless, he was the longest-living of Henry II&#x27;s sons to have become king and also the last of the Valois kings. Henry III of Navarre succeeded him as Henry IV, the first of the kings of the House of Bourbon.

* S.J. Parris &quot;Conspiracy&quot; (2015)

===Film===
* The French short film &quot;The Assassination of the Duke of Guise&quot; (1908) shows the Duke&#x27;s assassination but not the Cardinal&#x27;s. The co-director, Charles Le Bargy, plays the Duke.
* The American silent film &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916) depicts Henry as effeminate but not explicitly homosexual. He is portrayed by the British-born American actor Maxfield Stanley.
* The French movies &quot;La Reine Margot&quot; (1954) and &quot;La Reine Margot&quot; (1994), both based on Alexandre Dumas, père&#x27;s novel of the same title, are fictional depictions of the lives of Henry III&#x27;s family, his sister Margot, and her Protestant husband Henry around the time of the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre. In the 1994 film, Henry is played by the actor Pascal Greggory. In Dumas&#x27; novel, Henri was not portrayed as homosexual, whereas, in the 1954 film, he was shown as an effeminate, comical queen. In the 1994 film, he was portrayed as a more sinister character, bisexual and showing sexual interest in his sister. His brother dies by being accidentally poisoned by his mother, who had intended to kill Henry of Navarre instead.
* As the Duke of Anjou, the future Henry III plays a significant role in the French film &quot;The Princess of Montpensier&quot;, based on the novel of the same title by Madame de La Fayette.
* The film &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, released in 1998, depicts a fictional courtship between Elizabeth I of England and Henry III while he was still Duke of Anjou. In reality, the two never met and the Queen of England was actually courted nearly ten years later by his younger brother François, Duke of Anjou, when Elizabeth was 46. The film borrows some of the aspects of Henry III&#x27;s life and features Anjou as a comical foolish transvestite. The role is portrayed by the French actor Vincent Cassel.
* In the film &quot;Dangerous Beauty&quot;, he has an assignation with the main character, the Venetian courtesan Veronica Franco. Visiting a Venice eager for military aid, the &quot;French king&quot; chooses her from among the famous courtesans of that city because he notices her reluctance; placing a blade at her neck, he tells Veronica that the &quot;rumours&quot; about him are true (that &quot;the king is a pervert&quot;), and the implication is made that Veronica pleases him enormously by first correctly guessing at and then indulging his fetish for BDSM domination. (When the king emerges from Franco&#x27;s house in the morning, the assembled Venetian nobility awaiting, he smiles broadly while carefully settling his presumably sore posterior on a pillow, and then declares that the French navy shall assist the Venetians against the Ottoman Empire in defense of their rule of Cyprus.) He is played by the British actor Jake Weber.

===Television===
* In an episode of &quot;Animaniacs&quot; entitled &quot;The Three Muska-Warners&quot;, an Elmer Fudd–like Henri III is protected by Yakko, Wakko and Dot. In this version, Henri is portrayed by Jeff Bennett as a very old man who acts nervous and jumpy, and for no apparent reason speaks with an English accent.
* He is also featured in a few episodes in the first and fourth seasons of the CW show &quot;Reign&quot;. In the show&#x27;s fourth season, Henry is played by Nick Slater. With his brother showing little interest in the job, Spain wants Henry to become France&#x27;s king.
* &quot;The Serpent Queen&quot;

===Opera===
* Chabrier&#x27;s opéra-comique &quot;Le roi malgré lui&quot; (1887) deals with the unhappy Polish episode, with Henri as the reluctant King of Poland. In Kraków, he conspires with Polish nobles to depose himself. His friend Nangis changes places with him, but in the end, the plot fails and the curtain falls on Henri being crowned.

<text>Daylighting is the practice of placing windows, skylights, other openings, and reflective surfaces so that direct or indirect sunlight can provide effective internal lighting. Particular attention is given to daylighting while designing a building when the aim is to maximize visual comfort or to reduce energy use. Energy savings can be achieved from the reduced use of artificial (electric) lighting or from passive solar heating. Artificial lighting energy use can be reduced by simply installing fewer electric lights where daylight is present or by automatically dimming or switching off electric lights in response to the presence of daylight – a process known as daylight harvesting.

The amount of daylight received in an internal space can be analyzed by measuring illuminance on a grid or undertaking a daylight factor calculation. Computer programs such as Radiance allow an architect or engineer to quickly calculate benefits of a particular design. The human eye&#x27;s response to light is non-linear, so a more even distribution of the same amount of light makes a room appear brighter.

The source of all daylight is the Sun. The proportion of direct to diffuse light impacts the amount and quality of daylight. &quot;Direct sunlight&quot; reaches a site without being scattered within Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Sunlight that is scattered in the atmosphere is &quot;diffused daylight&quot;. Sunlight reflected off walls and the ground also contributes to daylighting. Each climate has different composition of these daylights and different cloud coverage, so daylighting strategies vary with site locations and climates. At latitudes north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn, there is no direct sunlight on the polar-side wall of a building between the autumnal equinox and the vernal equinox (that is, from the September equinox to the March equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, and from the March equinox to the September equinox in the Southern Hemisphere.) In the Northern Hemisphere, the north-facing wall is the &quot;polar-side&quot; and in the Southern Hemisphere, it is the south-facing wall.

Traditionally, houses were designed with minimal windows on the polar side, but more and larger windows on the equatorial side (south-facing wall in the Northern Hemisphere and north-facing wall in the Southern Hemisphere). Equatorial-side windows receive at least some direct sunlight on any sunny day of the year (except in the tropics in summer), so they are effective at daylighting areas of the house adjacent to the windows. At higher latitudes during midwinter, light incidence is highly directional and casts long shadows. This may be partially ameliorated through light diffusion, light pipes or tubes, and through somewhat reflective internal surfaces. At fairly low latitudes in summertime, windows that face east and west and sometimes those that face toward the nearer pole receive more sunlight than windows facing toward the equator.

==Types==
Passive daylighting is a system of both collecting sunlight using static, non-moving, and non-tracking systems (such as windows, sliding glass doors, most skylights, light tubes) and reflecting the collected daylight deeper inside with elements such as light shelves. Passive daylighting systems are different from active daylighting systems in that active systems track and/or follow the sun, and rely on mechanical mechanisms to do so.

===Windows===

Windows are the most common way to admit daylight into a space. Their vertical orientation means that they selectively admit sunlight and diffuse daylight at different times of the day and year. Therefore, windows on multiple orientations must usually be combined to produce the right mix of light for the building, depending on the climate and latitude. There are three ways to improve the amount of light available from a window:&lt;ref name=&quot;Building for Energy Independence: Sun/Earth Buffering and Superinsulation&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (a) placing the window close to a light colored wall, (b) slanting the sides of window openings so the inner opening is larger than the outer opening, or (c) using a large light colored window-sill to project light into the room. Besides permitting daylighting into the building, windows serve another function in daylighting practice, providing views out. To enhance the quality of the view seen from a window, three primary variables need to be ensure: view content (what can be seen in the view), view access (how much of the window view can be seen), and view clarity (how clearly the view can be seen). View clarity is often influenced by the amount of shading provided by blinds or devices used to protect occupants from harsh daylight (e.g. glare) or for reasons of visual privacy. Environmental criteria serve as important criteria to gauge the quality of window view content. These criteria can be distilled into five important factors, namely: Location, time, weather, people, and nature. Notably, views that are able to provide building inhabitants with content of nature far outweigh the other four Environmental Information Criteria.

Different types and grades of glass and different window treatments can also affect the amount of light transmission through the windows. The type of glazing is an important issue, expressed by its VT coefficient (Visual Transmittance), also known as visual light transmittance (VLT). As the name suggests, this coefficient measures how much visible light is admitted by the window. A low VT (below 0.4) can reduce by half or more the light coming into a room. But be also aware of high VT glass: high VT numbers (say, above 0.60) can be a cause of glare. On the other hand, you should also take into account the undesirable effects of large windows.

Windows grade into translucent walls (below).

====Clerestory windows====
Another important element in creating daylighting is the use of clerestory windows. These are high, vertically placed windows. They can be used to increase direct solar gain when oriented towards the equator. When facing toward the sun, clerestories and other windows may admit unacceptable glare. In the case of a passive solar house, clerestories may provide a direct light path to polar-side (north in the northern hemisphere; south in the southern hemisphere) rooms that otherwise would not be illuminated. Alternatively, clerestories can be used to admit diffuse daylight (from the north in the northern hemisphere) that evenly illuminates a space such as a classroom or office.

Often, clerestory windows also shine onto interior wall surfaces painted white or another light color. These walls are placed so as to reflect indirect light to interior areas where it is needed. This method has the advantage of reducing the directionality of light to make it softer and more diffuse, reducing shadows.

====Sawtooth roof====
Another roof-angled glass alternative is a sawtooth roof (found on older factories). Sawtooth roofs have vertical roof glass facing away from the equator side of the building to capture diffused light (not harsh direct equator-side solar gain). The angled portion of the glass-support structure is opaque and well insulated with a cool roof and radiant barrier. The sawtooth roof&#x27;s lighting concept partially reduces the summer &quot;solar furnace&quot; skylight problem, but still allows warm interior air to rise and touch the exterior roof glass in the cold winter, with significant undesirable heat transfer.

===Skylights===

Skylights are light transmitting fenestration (products filling openings in a building envelope which also includes windows, doors, etc.) forming all, or a portion of, the roof of a building space. Skylights are widely used in daylighting design in residential and commercial buildings, mainly because they are the most effective source of daylight on a unit area basis.

An alternative to a skylight is a roof lantern. A roof lantern is a daylighting cupola that sits above a roof, as opposed to a skylight which is fitted into a roof&#x27;s construction. Roof lanterns serve as both an architectural feature and a method of introducing natural light into a space, and are typically wooden or metal structures with a number of glazed glass panels.

===Laylights===

As an element of architecture, a laylight is a glazed panel usually set flush with the ceiling for the purpose of admitting natural or artificial light. Laylights typically utilize stained glass or lenses in their glazing, but can also use alternative materials. For example, the Lyme Art Association Gallery utilizes translucent white muslin laylights below its skylights. A laylight differs from a glazed (or closed) skylight in that a skylight functions as a roof window or aperture, while a laylight is flush with the ceiling of an interior space. When paired with a roof lantern or skylight on a sloped roof, a laylight functions as an interior light diffuser. Before the advent of electric lighting, laylights allowed transmission of light between floors in larger buildings, and were not always paired with skylights.

===Atrium===

An atrium is a large open space located within a building. It is often used to light a central circulation or public area by daylight admitted through a glass roof or wall. Atria provide some daylight to adjacent working areas, but the amount is often small and does not penetrate very far. The main function of an atrium is to provide a visual experience and a degree of contact with the outside for people in the working areas. The daylighting of successive storeys of rooms adjoining an atrium is interdependent and requires a balanced approach. Light from the sky can easily penetrate the upper storeys but not the lower, which rely primarily on light reflected from internal surfaces of the atrium such as floor-reflected light. The upper stories need less window area than the lower ones, and if the atrium walls are light in color the upper walls will reflect light toward the lower stories.

===Translucent walls===

Walls made of glass brick are translucent-to-transparent. Traditionally they are hollow and grouted with a fine concrete grout, but some modern glass brick walls are solid cast glass grouted with a transparent glue. If the glue matches the refractive index of the glass, the wall can be fairly transparent.

Increasing the amount of concrete, bottle walls embed bottles that run right through the wall, transmitting light. Concrete walls with glass prisms running through them have also been made. With the advent of cheaper optical fibers and fiber-optic concrete walls, daylight (and shadow images) can then pass directly through a solid concrete wall, making it translucent; fiber optics will lead light around bends and over tens of meters. Typically only a few percent of the light is transmitted (the percent transmittance is about half the percent of the surface that is fibers, and usually only ~5% fibers are used).

Both glass and concrete conduct heat fairly well, when solid, so none of these walls insulate well. They are therefore often used outdoors, as a divider between two heated spaces (see images), or in very temperate climates.

Greenhouse walls (and roofs) are made to transmit as much light and as little heat as possible. They use a variety of materials, and may be transparent or translucent.

===Remote distribution===

It is possible to provide some daylight into spaces that have low possibility of windows or skylights through remote distribution devices such as mirrors, prisms, or light tubes. This is called anidolic lighting, from anidolic (non-image-forming) optics. The non-linear response of the human eye to light means that spreading light to a broader area of a room makes the room appear brighter, and makes more of it usefully lit.

Remote daylight distribution systems have losses, and the further they have to transmit the daylight and the more convoluted the path, the greater the inefficiency. The efficiency of many remote distribution systems can also vary dramatically from clear to overcast skies. Nonetheless, where there is no other possibility of providing daylight to a space, remote distribution systems can be appreciated.

====Light reflectors and shelves====
Once used extensively in office buildings, the manually adjustable light reflector is seldom in use today having been supplanted by a combination of other methods in concert with artificial illumination. The reflector had found favor where the choices of artificial light provided poor illumination compared to modern electric lighting.

Light shelves are an effective way to enhance the lighting from windows on the equator-facing side of a structure, this effect being obtained by placing a white or reflective metal light shelf outside the window. Usually the window will be protected from direct summer season sun by a projecting eave. The light shelf projects beyond the shadow created by the eave and reflects sunlight upward to illuminate the ceiling. This reflected light can contain little heat content and the reflective illumination from the ceiling will typically reduce deep shadows, reducing the need for general illumination.

In the cold winter, a natural light shelf is created when there is snow on the ground which makes it reflective. Low winter sun (see Sun path) reflects off the snow and increases solar gain through equator-facing glass by one- to two-thirds which brightly lights the ceiling of these rooms. Glare control (drapes) may be required.

====Prisms====

The oldest use of prisms for daylighting may well be deck prisms, let into the decks of ships to transmit light below. Later, pavement lights or vault lights were used to light basement areas under sidewalks.

Prisms that used total internal reflection to throw light sideways, lighting the deeper portions of a room, later became popular. Early thick, slow-cooling cast glass prism tiles were often known as &quot;luxfer tiles&quot; after a major manufacturer. They were and are used in the upper portions of windows, and some believe that they contributed to the trend from dark, subdivided Victorian interiors to open-plan, light-coloured ones.

Daylight redirecting window film (DRF) is a thin plastic version of the old glass prism tiles. It can be used as a substitute for opaque blinds.

====Light tubes====


Another type of device used is the light tube, also called a tubular daylighting device (TDD), which is placed into a roof and admits light to a focused area of the interior. These somewhat resemble recessed ceiling light fixtures. They do not allow as much heat transfer as skylights because they have less surface area.

TDDs use modern technology to transmit visible light through opaque walls and roofs. The tube itself is a passive component consisting of either a simple reflective interior coating or a light conducting fiber optic bundle. It is frequently capped with a transparent, roof-mounted dome &quot;light collector&quot; and terminated with a diffuser assembly that admits the daylight into interior spaces and distributes the available light energy evenly (or else efficiently if the use of the lit space is reasonably fixed, and the user desired one or more &quot;bright-spots&quot;).

The tubular daylighting device was invented by Solatube International in 1986 and brought to market first in Australia in 1991.

===Active daylighting===
Active daylighting is a system of collecting sunlight using a mechanical device to increase the efficiency of light collection for a given lighting purpose. Active daylighting systems are different from passive daylighting systems in that passive systems are stationary and do not actively follow or track the sun. There are two types of active daylighting control systems: closed loop solar tracking, and open loop solar tracking systems.
* Closed loop systems track the sun by relying on a set of lens or sensors with a limited field of view, directed at the sun, and are fully illuminated by sunlight at all times. As the sun moves, it begins to shade one or more sensors, which the system detect and activates motors or actuators to move the device back into a position where all sensors are once again equally illuminated.
* Open loop systems track the sun without physically following the sun via sensors (although sensors may be used for calibration). These systems typically employ electronic logic which controls device motors or actuators to follow the sun based on a mathematical formula. This formula is typically a pre-programmed sun path chart, detailing where the sun will be at a given latitude and at a given date and time for each day.

==Smart glass==
Smart glass is the name given to a class of materials and devices that can be switched between a transparent state and a state which is opaque, translucent, reflective, or retro-reflective. The switching is done by applying a voltage to the material, or by performing some simple mechanical operation. Windows, skylights, etc., that are made of smart glass can be used to adjust indoor lighting, compensating for changes of the brightness of the light outdoors and of the required brightness indoors.

==Solar lighting==
===Heliostats===
The use of heliostats, mirrors which are moved automatically to reflect sunlight in a constant direction as the sun moves across the sky, is gaining popularity as an energy-efficient method of lighting. A heliostat can be used to shine sunlight directly through a window or skylight, or into any arrangement of optical elements, such as light tubes, that distribute the light where it is needed. The image shows a mirror that rotates on a computer-controlled, motor-driven altazimuth mount.

===Solar street lights===
Solar street lights raised light sources which are powered by photovoltaic panels generally mounted on the lighting structure. The solar array of such off-grid PV system charges a rechargeable battery, which powers a fluorescent or LED lamp during the night. Solar street lights are stand-alone power systems, and have the advantage of savings on trenching, landscaping, and maintenance costs, as well as on the electric bills, despite their higher initial cost compared to conventional street lighting. They are designed with sufficiently large batteries to ensure operation for at least a week and even in the worst situation, they are expected to dim only slightly.

===Hybrid solar lighting===
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has developed a new alternative to skylights called hybrid solar lighting. This design uses a roof-mounted light collector, large-diameter optical fiber, and modified efficient fluorescent lighting fixtures that have transparent rods connected to the optical fiber cables. Essentially no electricity is needed for daytime natural interior lighting.

Field tests conducted in 2006 and 2007 of the new HSL technology were promising, but the low-volume equipment production is still expensive. HSL should become more cost effective in the near future. A version that can withstand windstorms could begin to replace conventional commercial fluorescent lighting systems with improved implementations in 2008 and beyond. The U.S. 2007 Energy Bill provides funding for HSL R&amp;D, and multiple large commercial buildings are ready to fund further HSL application development and deployment.

At night, ORNL HSL uses variable-intensity fluorescent lighting electronic control ballasts. As the sunlight gradually decreases at sunset, the fluorescent fixture is gradually turned up to give a near-constant level of interior lighting from daylight until after it becomes dark outside.

HSL may soon become an option for commercial interior lighting. It can transmit about half of the direct sunlight it receives.

==Solarium==
In a well-designed isolated solar gain building with a solarium, sunroom, greenhouse, etc., there is usually significant glass on the equator side. A large area of glass can also be added between the sun room and the interior living quarters. Low-cost, high-volume-produced patio door safety glass is an inexpensive way to accomplish this goal.

The doors used to enter a room should be opposite the sun room interior glass, so that a user can see outside immediately when entering most rooms. Halls should be minimized with open spaces used instead. If a hall is necessary for privacy or room isolation, inexpensive patio door safety glass can be placed on both sides of the hall. Drapes over the interior glass can be used to control lighting. Drapes can optionally be automated with sensor-based electric motor controls that are aware of room occupancy, daylight, interior temperature, and time of day. Passive solar buildings with no central air conditioning system need control mechanisms for hourly, daily, and seasonal, temperature-and-daylight variations. If the temperature is correct, and a room is unoccupied, the drapes can automatically close to reduce heat transfer in either direction.

To help distribute sun room daylight to the sides of rooms that are farthest from the equator, inexpensive ceiling-to-floor mirrors can be used.

Building codes require a second means of egress, in case of fire. Most designers use a door on one side of bedrooms, and an outside window, but west-side windows provide very-poor summer thermal performance. Instead of a west-facing window, designers use an R-13 foam-filled solid energy-efficient exterior door. It may have a glass storm door on the outside so that light can pass through when the inner door is opened. East/west glass doors and windows should be fully shaded top-to-bottom or a spectrally selective coating can be used to reduce solar gain.

==Design==
Architects and interior designers often use daylighting as a design element. Good daylighting requires attention to both qualitative and quantitative aspects of design.

===Qualitative===
Utilizing natural light is one of the design aspects in architecture; In 1929, the French architect, Le Corbusier said that &quot;The history of architectural material... has been the endless struggle for light... in other words, the history of windows.&quot; As he emphasized in his architecture (such as Notre Dame du Haut), daylighting has been a major architectural design element (See MIT Chapel and Church of the Light for examples). Not only the aesthetic aspects, the impact of daylighting on human health and work performance is also considered as qualitative daylighting. The current studies show that lighting conditions in workplaces contribute to a variety of factors related to work satisfaction, productivity and well-being and significantly higher visual acceptance scores under daylighting than electrical lighting. Studies have also shown that light has a direct effect on human health because of the way it influences the circadian rhythms.

===Quantitative===
A well daylit space needs both adequate lighting levels and light that is well distributed. In the current building industry, daylighting is considered a building performance measure in green building certification programs such as LEED. Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) and the society of Light and Lighting (SLL) provide illuminance recommendation for each space type. How much daylighting contributes to the recommended lighting level determines daylighting performance of a building. There are two metrics that IES has approved to evaluate daylighting performance: Spatial Daylight Autonomy(sDA) and Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE). sDA is a metric describing annual sufficiency of ambient daylight levels in interior environments. See Daylight autonomy and LEED documentation sections for more details.

==Evaluation method==

===Field measurements===
In existing buildings, field measurements can be undertaken to evaluate daylighting performance. Illuminance measurements on a grid is a basic level to derive an average illuminance of a space. The spacing of the measurement points vary with project purposes. The height of these points depends on where the primary task is performed. In most office spaces, desk level (0.762m above the floor) will be measured. Based on measurements, average illuminance, maximum-to-minimum uniformity ratio, and average-to-minimum uniformity ratio will be calculated and compared to the recommended lighting level. A diagnostic survey specific to lighting can be conducted to analyse the satisfaction of building occupants.

===Computational simulations===
Computational simulations can predict daylighting condition of a space much faster and more detailed than hand calculations or scale model testing. The simulations allow for the effects of climate with hourly weather data from typical meteorological year. Computer models are available which can predict variations in internally reflected light. Radiosity and ray-tracing are methods can deal with complex geometry, allow complex sky distributions and potentially produce photorealistic images. Radiosity methods assume all surfaces are perfectly diffusing to reduce computational times. Ray-tracing techniques have accuracy and image rendering capacity.

==Daylighting metrics and analyses==
Daylight autonomy is the percentage of time that daylight levels are above a specified target illuminance within a physical space or building. The calculation is based on annual data and the predetermined lighting levels. The goal of the calculation is to determine how long an individual can work in a space without requiring electrical lighting, while also providing optimal visual and physical comfort.

Daylight autonomy is beneficial when determining how daylight enters and illuminates a space. The drawback, however, is that there is no upper limit on luminance levels. Therefore, a space with a high internal heat gain deemed uncomfortable by occupants, would still perform well in the analysis. Achieving daylight autonomy requires an integrated design approach that guides the building form, siting, climate considerations, building components, lighting controls, and lighting design criteria.

===Continuous===
Continuous daylight autonomy, is similar to daylight autonomy but partial credit is attributed to time steps when the daylight illuminance lies below the minimum illuminance level. For example, if the target illuminance is 400 lux and the calculated value is 200 lux, daylight autonomy would give zero credit, while continuous daylight autonomy would give 0.5 credit (200/400 = 0.5). The benefit of continuous daylight autonomy is that it does not give a hard threshold of acceptable illuminance. Instead, it addresses the transition area—allowing for realistic preferences within any given space. For example, office occupants usually prefer to work at daylight below the illuminance threshold since this level avoids potential glare and excessive contrast.

===Useful illuminance===
Useful daylight illuminance focuses on the direct sunlight that falls into a space. The useful daylight illuminance calculation is based on three factors—the percentage of time a point is below, between, or above an illuminance value. The range for these factors is typically 100–2,000 lux. Useful daylight illuminance is similar to daylight autonomy but has the added benefit of addressing glare and thermal discomfort. The upper threshold is used to determine when glare or thermal discomfort is occurring and may need resolution.

===Illuminance distribution===
Besides determining how much illuminance is received on a horizontal surface, a method that analyses annual illuminance distributions for daylight has been developed. Every annual illuminance distribution is compared against each other using principal components analysis. This compares the relationship between each pattern. Daylight patterns that are more similar to each other due to architectural features and the time of the year the illuminance are produced are grouped together. Groups are used to form the most representative patterns for that given building. This method can be used to easily interpret how daylight is spread across the space throughout the entire year in any building.

==LEED documentation==
The LEED 2009 daylighting standards were intended to connect building occupants with the outdoors through use of optimal daylighting techniques and technologies. According to these standards, the maximum value of 1 point can be achieved through four different approaches. The first approach is a computer simulation to demonstrate, in clear sky conditions, the daylight illuminance levels 108–5,400 lux on, September 21 between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Another prescriptive approach is a method that uses two types of side-lighting, and three types of top-lighting to determine if a minimum of 75% daylighting is achieved in the occupied spaces. A third approach uses indoor light measurements showing that between 108 and 5,400 lux have been achieved in the space. The last approach is a combination of the other three calculation methods to prove that the daylight illumination requirements are achieved.

The LEED 2009 documentation is based upon the daylight factor calculation. The daylight factor calculation is based on uniform overcast skies. It is most applicable in Northern Europe and parts of North America. Daylight factor is &quot;the ratio of the illuminance at a point on a plane, generally the horizontal work plane, produced by the luminous flux received directly or indirectly at that point from a sky whose luminance distribution is known, to the illuminance on a horizontal plane produced by an unobstructed hemisphere of this same sky.&quot;

LEED v4 daylighting standards are the most current as of 2014. The new standards are similar to the old standards, but also intend to &quot;reinforce circadian rhythms, and reduce the use of electrical lighting by introducing daylight in the space. Two options exist for achieving the maximum value of these two most recent points. One option is to use a computer simulation to demonstrate that a spatial daylight autonomy of 300 lux for at least 50% of the time, and an annual sunlight exposure of 1,000 lux for 250 occupied hours per year, exists in the space. Another option is to show that illuminance levels are between 300 lux and 3,000 lux between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. on a clear day at the equinox for 75% or 90% of the floor area in the space. The overall goal of the LEED v4 daylighting metrics is to analyze both the quantity and quality of the light, as well as to balance the use of glazing to ensure more light and less cooling load.

<text>In England, the Lord of Misrule – known in Scotland as the Abbot of Unreason and in France as the &quot;Prince des Sots&quot; – was an officer appointed by lot during Christmastide to preside over the Feast of Fools. The Lord of Misrule was generally a peasant or sub-deacon appointed to be in charge of Christmas revelries, which often included drunkenness and wild partying.

The Catholic Church in England held a similar festival involving a boy bishop. This custom was abolished by Henry VIII in 1541, restored by the Catholic Mary I and again abolished by Protestant Elizabeth I, though here and there it lingered on for some time longer. In continental Europe, it was suppressed by the Council of Basel in 1431, but was revived in some places from time to time, even as late as the eighteenth century. In the Tudor period, the Lord of Misrule (sometimes called the Abbot of Misrule or the King of Misrule) is mentioned a number of times by contemporary documents referring to revels both at court and among the ordinary people.

While mostly known as a British holiday custom, some folklorists, such as James Frazer and Mikhail Bakhtin (who is said to have borrowed the novel idea from Frazer), have claimed that the appointment of a Lord of Misrule comes from a similar custom practised during the Roman celebration of Saturnalia. In ancient Rome, from 17 to 23 December (in the Julian calendar), a man chosen to be a mock king was appointed for the feast of Saturnalia, in the guise of the Roman deity Saturn. This hypothesis has been heavily criticized by William Warde Fowler and as such, the Christmas custom of the Lord of Misrule during the Christian era and the Saturnalian custom of antiquity may have completely separate origins; the two separate customs, however, can be compared and contrasted. Many of the customs regarding the Lord of Misrule have been incorporated into modern-day Carnival and Mardi Gras celebrations. 

==History==
=== Ancient Rome ===
On 1 January, AD 400, the bishop Asterius of Amasea in Pontus (modern Amasya, Turkey) preached a sermon against the Feast of Calends (&quot;this foolish and harmful delight&quot;) that describes the role of the mock king in Late Antiquity. The New Year&#x27;s feast included children arriving at each doorstep, exchanging their gifts for reward:
It contrasted with the Christian celebration held, not by chance, on the adjoining day:
Significantly, for Asterius the Christian feast was explicitly an entry from darkness into light, and although no conscious solar nature could have been expressed, it is certainly the renewed light at midwinter that was celebrated among Roman pagans, officially from the time of Aurelian, as the &quot;festival of the birth of the Unconquered Sun&quot;. Meanwhile, throughout the city of Amasea, although entry into the temples and holy places had been forbidden by the decree of Theodosius I (391), the festival of gift-giving when &quot;all is noise and tumult&quot; in &quot;a rejoicing over the new year&quot; with a kiss and the gift of a coin, went on all around, to the intense disgust and scorn of the bishop:
Honest farmers coming into the city were likely to be jeered at, spanked and robbed. Worse,
In The Golden Bough, James Frazer cites a Greek martyrology which claims that during Saturnalia in Durostorum on the Danube (modern Silistra), Roman soldiers would choose a man from among themselves to be a ceremonial &quot;temporary king&quot; for thirty days. At the end of that term, this soldier was to cut his own throat on the altar of Saturn. The Christian Saint Dasius was supposedly chosen for this ritual, but refused to participate, and was martyred as a result. Frazer speculated that a similar ritual of human sacrifice could be the origin of the British Lord of Misrule.

=== Tudor England ===

In the Tudor period, John Stow in his &quot;Survey of London&quot;, published in 1603, gives a description of the Lord of Misrule:
[I]n the feaste of Christmas, there was in the kinges house, wheresoeuer hee was lodged, a Lord of Misrule, or Maister of merry disports, and the like had yee in the house of euery noble man, of honor, or good worshippe, were he spirituall or temporall. Amongst the which the Mayor of London, and eyther of the shiriffes had their seuerall Lordes of Misrule, euer contending without quarrell or offence, who should make the rarest pastimes to delight the Beholders. These Lordes beginning their rule on Alhollon Eue [Halloween], continued the same till the morrow after the Feast of the Purification, commonlie called Candlemas day: In all which space there were fine and subtle disguisinges, Maskes and Mummeries, with playing at Cardes for Counters, Nayles and pointes in euery house, more for pastimes then for gaine.
The Lord of Misrule is also mentioned by Philip Stubbes in his &quot;Anatomie of Abuses&quot; (1585), where he states that &quot;the wilde heades of the parishe conventynge together, chuse them a grand Capitaine (of mischeefe) whom they ennobel with the title Lorde of Misrule.&quot; He then describes how they dress colourfully, tie bells onto their legs, and &quot;go to the churche (though the minister be at praier or preachyng) dauncying and swingyng their handercheefes.&quot;

== Decline of the custom in Britain ==

With the rise of the Puritan party in the 17th century Church of England, the custom of the Lord of Misrule was outlawed as it was deemed &quot;disruptive&quot;; even after the Restoration, the custom remained banned and soon became forgotten. In the early 19th century, the Oxford Movement in the Anglican Church ushered in &quot;the development of richer and more symbolic forms of worship, the building of neo-Gothic churches, and the revival and increasing centrality of the keeping of Christmas itself as a Christian festival&quot; as well as &quot;special charities for the poor&quot; in addition to &quot;special services and musical events&quot;. Charles Dickens and other writers helped in this revival of the holiday by &quot;changing consciousness of Christmas and the way in which it was celebrated&quot; as they emphasized family, religion, gift-giving, and social reconciliation as opposed to the historic revelry common in some places.

<text>Film style refers to recognizable cinematic techniques used by filmmakers to create specific value in their work. These techniques can include all aspects of film language, including: sound design, mise-en-scène, dialogue, cinematography, editing, or direction.

==Style and the director==
A film director may have a distinctive filmmaking style that differs from other directors, similar to an author&#x27;s own distinctive writing style. Through the analysis of film techniques, differences between filmmakers&#x27; styles become apparent.

There are many technical possibilities available to filmmakers. As a result, no single film will be made using every single technique. Historical circumstances, for example, limit the choices for the director. During the silent film era, filmmakers were not able to use synchronized dialogue until sound became possible in the late 1920s. Films before the 1930s were black and white; now directors have the choice of shooting in color tints or black and white.

Directors can choose how to use film language. One of the most noticeable ways to affect film style is through mise-en-scène, or what appears on the screen. Lighting, costumes, props, camera movements, and backgrounds are all part of mise-en-scène. There are countless ways to create a film based on the same script simply through changing the mise-en-scène. Adjusting these techniques creates meaning and can highlight aspects of the narrative. Many filmmakers will create the overall film style to reflect the story.

==Style and audience==
Many films conform to the Classical Hollywood narrative film style, which is a set of guidelines that many filmmakers tend to follow. The story in this style is told chronologically in a cause and effect relationship. The main principle in this film style is continuity editing, where editing, camera, and sound should be considered &quot;invisible&quot; to the viewers. In other words, attention should not be brought to these elements.

While many filmmakers conform to these guidelines, there are other filmmakers that ignore the guidelines and do bring attention to the film techniques. These filmmakers may violate the standard conventions of film in order to create an innovative style or draw attention to particular aspects of film language.

The director decides what is and is not on the screen, guiding what the audience looks at and notices. Although the audience may not consciously absorb film style, it still affects the viewer&#x27;s experience of the film.

When viewers watch a film, they may have certain expectations based on previous experiences of film because some techniques are commonly found in film and have become conventional. For example, after a long shot there may commonly be a cut to a closer view. If a character is walking across the stage, the audience expects the camera to pan or follow the character&#x27;s movement. Viewers expect to interact with and be a part of the film, rather than simply being shown a group of images. These expectations come from experiences with both the real and film worlds; we follow a character in our real world with our eyes, just as a camera pans to follow a character on the screen. The audience expects films to appear like real life, and be shot according to a certain style. Classical Hollywood narrative film styles and the conventions of other genres help to guide the audience in what to expect. Some film makers use styles that challenge these conventions.

==Difference between genre and film style==
Film style and film genre should not be confused; they are different aspects of the medium. Style is the way a movie is filmed, as in the techniques that are used in the production process. Genre is the category a film is placed in regarding the narrative elements. For instance, Western films are about the American frontier, romance films are about love, and so on.

Film style categorizes films based on the techniques used in the making of the film, such as cinematography or lighting. Two films may be from the same genre, but may well look different as a result of the film style. For example, &quot;Independence Day&quot; and &quot;Cloverfield&quot; are both sci-fi, action films about the possible end of the world. However, they are shot differently, with &quot;Cloverfield&quot; using a handheld camera for the entire movie. Films in the same genre do not necessarily have the same film style. Therefore, film genre and film style are two separate, distinct terms in film.

<text>The Plow That Broke the Plains is a 1936 short documentary film that shows the cultivation of the Great Plains region of the United States and Canada following the Civil War and leading up to the Dust Bowl as a result of farmers&#x27; exploitation of the Great Plains&#x27; natural resources.&quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; was the first film created by the US government for commercial release and distribution through the Resettlement Administration as part of President Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal program. The Resettlement Administration recruited Pare Lorentz to produce &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; to support its campaign of showing the public that the search for profits in the West resulted in the displacement of settlers, misuse of the land, and ultimately resulted in the dust storms that affected the Great Plains regions in the 1930s. The film was one of the most widely publicized attempts by the U.S. federal government to communicate to its citizens through motion pictures.

&quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; was written and directed by Pare Lorentz independently while the music score was written by composer Virgil Thomson. The film was narrated by the American actor and baritone Thomas Hardie Chalmers.

In 1999, &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Background==
The initial inspiration for &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; came from Pare Lorentz&#x27;s desire to make a film on the New Deal that would provide Americans with a fresh look at their country. Lorentz became particularly interested in the drought and dust storms of the early thirties which inspired him to write a lengthy piece on the Dust Bowl for Newsweek. In 1935, Rexford Tugwell, the head of the Resettlement Administration, initially recruited Pare Lorentz as a film consultant as part of the Resettlement Administration staff, because the agency administrators were interested in creating a film about the Dust Bowl. While the Resettlement Administration sponsored extensive photographic surveys of rural poverty conditions, head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Henry Wallace and Tugwell became interested in using motion pictures as a medium which would bridge gaps in communication between the government and the public. The Director of Information for the Resettlement Administration John Franklin Carter asked Lorentz if he thought a motion picture could be used to interpret the general objectives of the Resettlement Administration which included: improvement of impoverished farm families, prevention of waste due to improper land use, structured utilization of land resources, recultivation of worn out and submarginal land, and relocation of families. Following Lorentz agreement to focus on land use and misuse and an estimate that the film could be produced with six-thousand dollars, Tugwell put his support behind the production of a film about the Dust Bowl.

In a letter, Tugwell expressed that the film was to function as an internal educational tool for the Resettlement Administration and its employees to visualize and understand better the problems confronting them and to aid the administration in preventing the results of soil erosion related problems in the Great Plains. Additionally, the film was also to align with the goals of the Resettlement Administration and would explain the causes of the Dust Bowl, while also making a strong case for resettling destitute farmers, retiring marginal farmland from production, and restoring the grasslands in the West.

In a review of his own film, Lorentz commented in McCall&#x27;s Magazine that he had two primary objectives: To show the audience an exciting portion of the country and to portray the events that led to &quot;one of the major catastrophes in American history,&quot; the Great Drought and the Dust Bowl. With a limited budget, Lorentz could only map out a small portion of the reality experienced in the Great Plains within a 28-minute frame. He, therefore, had to abstract, simplify, and compress the history of the Great Plains, while still attempting to portray the plains environment and history in a work of art that would not only elicit emotional responses from the audience but coerce them into corrective action that would rehabilitate the area and prevent future ecological catastrophes. Therefore, Lorentz envisioned the film as a &quot;lyric educational exercise, both practical and aesthetic, incorporating the history of the Great Plains from the first cattle drives to the punishing drought then entering its 6th year.&quot;

Lorentz&#x27;s depiction differed from other portrayals of the Great Plains region. While photographers tended to emphasize the people of the plains as blameless victims, and mural artists emphasized the glorious past of the pioneer, Lorentz wanted to present the environmental tale of the Plains as one of decline and refused to see the dust storms as a natural disaster, instead depicting these events as human-created tragedies.

&quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; also had the benefit of promoting New Deal programs and as President Roosevelt indicated to Lorentz himself, softening the public for subsequent New Deal measures related to public works and health. The use of film also helped Roosevelt circumvent largely Republican-controlled media platforms to promote New Deal policies. Because the film was also released during an election year, it was bound to also generate political rancor.

==Plot==
&quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; begins with a written prologue appearing as words on the screen that gives a physical description of the Great Plains region as well as a brief history of the plains. Following the written prologue, a map shows the outlines of the Great Plains region within the United States and the political boundaries of the states within it. The motion picture scenes are introduced by displaying the vast grasslands of the Great Plains with narrator Thomas Chalmers speaking about the weather and geographical features of the land, reiterating that the plains are a region with &quot;high winds and sun without rivers, without streams, and with little rain.&quot; The following scene introduces the first settlers of the region, the cattle farmers. The narrator continues on, explaining that following the cattle came to the railroads bringing even more settlers who established towns and attracted additional pioneers and plowmen. The next sequences show the arrival of settlers through wagons and caravans as well as the first settlers constructing settlements and breaking the soil in order to farm. The narrator reiterates the phrase &quot;high winds and sun without rivers, without streams, and with little rain&quot; but ends with a warning, &quot;settler, plow at your peril.&quot;

Following this, the next sequence shows the mechanization of agriculture and the production of grains and crops. The narrator comes back in as the scene transitions to farmers plowing dry soil and a woman sweeping dust from a staircase, explaining that the &quot;rains failed and the sun baked the light soil&quot; and that &quot;many left&quot; the region. Despite the narrator stating that many settlers were disappointed, a new hope for increasing profits came in the form of World War I. The following scenes show newspapers that display the declaration of World War I and the resulting prices of wheat soaring due to demand. The atmosphere of the film changes to an uplifting and patriotic tone as farmers use mechanized agricultural equipment to prepare the fields for planting and harvesting crops. The narrator exclaims, &quot;wheat will win the war!&quot; multiple times while scenes of wheat and grain production appear alongside scenes of war. While scenes of settlers using mechanized farm equipment to harvest the crops continue, the narrator explains how millions of acres were converted over to farmland followed by more images of newspaper articles announcing that large acreage was available to purchase to establish more farmlands.

Following the scenes showing extensive plowing and harvesting, the film cuts to images of dried land, animal bones, and abandoned farm equipment. The narrator again states that the rain did not come and the sun-baked millions of acres of plowed land, with footage of arid plains. As a result of this desertification, massive dust storms swept across the plains, causing people to take shelter, with homes buried under the dust. The narrator states that &quot;once again they headed West,&quot; referring to the settlers losing hope and migrating in search of better opportunities. Within the final sequence, the narrator exclaims &quot;Four hundred million acres the Great Plains seemed inexhaustible yet in 50 years we turned a part of it into a Dust Bowl&quot; and continues to list the factors that led to the Dust Bowl, such as too many cattle and sheep, plowed lands that should have been left untouched, removal of native grasses to hold soil, and farm machines that made it easy for a single person to plow many acres. The narrator continues to explain that the federal government has been working to salvage whatever land is left and restore it through New Deal initiatives including the Soil Conversation Service, Forest Service, and the Civilian Conservation Corps, while the Resettlement Administration worked to resettle the stranded farmers. The viewer is left with one last message from the narrator who warns that conservation is necessary in order to save the rest of the plains and that &quot;another decade of reckless use, and the grasslands will truly be the great American desert.&quot;

==Production==
===Early production and filming===
The early production period, which consisted of Pare Lorentz conducting research and developing a rough shooting script lasted from June to September 1935. To make the film as inexpensive as possible, Lorentz did not use any professional actors and shot all footage on location. Because sound technology was still new, bringing the equipment into the field to capture human voices and sounds would have been nearly impossible. Therefore, &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; was initially a silent film with a musical score and narration added later. On September 3, Lorentz secured cameramen Ralph Steiner, Paul Strand, and Leo Hurwitz, each with experience in documentary film production and influenced by the work of Soviet filmmakers. Lorentz scouted locations for filming through examining and researching photos taken by the Resettlement Administration and began filming in September 1935 in Montana.

Over the next 7 weeks, Lorentz and his cameramen traversed eight states from the Montana-Wyoming border to the Texas Panhandle. Because &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; was Lorentz&#x27;s first film, he had difficulty communicating his ideas to the cameramen and filming locations became a point of contention between Lorentz and the crew. Additionally, the cameramen became concerned that the final script had not yet been written either. This resulted in Steiner, Strand, and Hurwitz creating their own script that voiced their own political positions that indicted capitalism, human greed, and a &quot;lousy social system&quot; for the devastation of the Great Plains and its residents. Following the Dust Storm sequences in Texas, Lorentz fired the crew and headed to California where Resettlement Administration photographer Dorothea Lange helped him capture scenes of migrants searching for work. Additionally Lorentz needed to finish the film with stock footage, but because the Hollywood community wanted to prevent the film from being completed as many considered it New Deal propaganda, they instructed studios and film libraries to refuse Lorentz&#x27;s requests. Through friends, Lorentz was able to obtain the stock footage and complete the film after learning how to cut and edit the film himself, due to not having any budget to hire an editor.

===Budget===
The Resettlement Administration proposed to have &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; produced and accompanied with music at an estimated expense of $6,000. Despite the budget allotted to film production, there were times that he worked without pay due to Congress debating whether or not the film should be created. Although Lorentz was salaried, he made only $18 a day, which was less than the cameramen working on the project. The film&#x27;s final budget, however, end up at $19,260, three times the original budget. Because the initial budget ran out before the film&#x27;s completion, Lorentz was forced to pay for the music, editing, and final printout from his own pocket. Upon completion, Lorentz went into Rexford Tugwell&#x27;s office to submit his resignation.

===Film techniques===
In order to engage the audience, Lorentz had to condense the history of the Great Plains into a simplified &quot;ecological drama&quot; that would elicit a strong emotional response. Lorentz wrote the script following filming, with narration in a free verse that utilized a Walt Whitman-like repetition of words and phrases to create a mood of judgement. The expository commentary for the film consisted of only 700 words so as to not bombard the viewer with information and put more emphasis on picture technique and the musical score which Lorentz thought could speak louder than words.

==Soundtrack==
===Virgil Thomson and composition===
Lorentz interviewed twelve composers and only Virgil Thomson agreed to work on the film following an offer of no more than $500 to write a music score. Thomson and Lorentz agreed that the film should be rendered through the folk music of the Plains people and produced 25 minutes of music in less than a week. After viewing the rough cut of the film, Thomson composed a score that was divided into six movements: Prelude, Pastorale (Grass), Cattle, Blues (Speculation), Drought, and Devastation. The soundtrack was a patchwork of dances, hymns, neo-medieval counterpoint, and chorale-like passages with wide-spaced harmonies, with interludes of familiar folk tunes like &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot; and &quot;Git Along, Little Dogies&quot;. During the war sequence, Thomson accompanied the scene of the phalanx of tractors coming over a hill like a battalion of tanks on a battlefield with American troops marching to the song, &quot;Mademoiselle from Armentieres.&quot; The final scene sequence&#x27;s music is a tango which accompanies the narrator&#x27;s call to action directed at the audience.

===Recording===
The New York Philharmonic recorded the musical score under the direction of conductor Alexander Smallens, while Metropolitan Opera baritone Thomas Chalmers recorded the narration. Thomson scored his accompaniment for a standard orchestra, plus saxophones, guitar, banjo, and harmonium. Because Lorentz had so little money left in his budget, on the day that the score was recorded he forced the session to stop at midnight because he could not afford to pay the New York Philharmonic members overtime. The musicians decided to complete the recording session for free. Following the completion of the final score, Lorentz re-cut sections of the film to accommodate the music.

==Reception==
&quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; had its first showing at the White House in March 1936. After several private showings, the film was officially released to the public at the Mayflower Hotel on May 10, 1936. Following President Roosevelt&#x27;s private showing, FDR praised Lorentz for his work and wanted to show it to a joint session of Congress. This would have made &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; the first film to be screened in Congress, but this did not occur due to the House chambers not being equipped to show a film with sound. Although some film reviewers did not agree that &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; was a pinnacle of artistic achievement, praise was almost unanimous and Lorentz became one of America&#x27;s foremost directors.

Following the film&#x27;s release, members of the Hollywood community claimed that due to the film being created by the government it was, therefore, a propaganda film and not a documentary. For this reason, they refused to show it in theaters. Lorentz traveled the country with the film to convince theater owners to show his film. The Rialto Theater in New York agreed and the public reacted positively. This led to other theater owners showing the film as well. Out of 14,000 commercial cinemas nationally, 3,000 screened the film to an audience of about 10 million in 1937. In addition to independent theaters the film was also shown in school auditoriums and public meeting places as well.

According to Robert L. Snyder&#x27;s book about Lorentz, the filmmaker&#x27;s favorite comment about the movie was something he heard an audience member say in the row ahead of him: &quot;They never should have plowed them plains.&quot;

==Controversies==
===Distribution===
Because government regulation forbade commercial theaters from charging admission to see the film, theater owners felt that the government was attempting to use them to distribute propaganda. Additionally, motion picture producers and theater owners felt that government-produced films might compete with their own products and threaten their profits, resulting in Hollywood barring the film from its distribution system. As an excuse to not show the film, commercial theaters argued that at 28-minutes long, the film was too short for a feature but too long for a newsreel.

===Criticism===
Further sources of controversy came from the film&#x27;s interpretation of who was responsible for the ecological disaster of the Great Plains. While newsreels, journalists, and Great Plains politicians blamed the disasters on weather, Lorentz rejected this and instead pointed toward mechanized agriculture and human action as being the main culprits. Contemporary critics questioned Lorentz&#x27;s understanding of the history of the Great Plains by pointing out how he emphasized agricultural expansion as the origin of the Dust Bowl and not the long droughts. Other critics have also explained that Lorentz had overlooked the diversity and vitality of the Great Plains economy and undervalued the quality of life of the farmers in order to build a case for converting substantial areas of the Great Plains back to grassland. Further critics also insisted that Lorentz had portrayed farmers as victims of modern technology and presented them with an unfair and negative image. Another critique of the film is that it also fails to mention the government&#x27;s own role in the Dust Bowl disaster. Government settlement programs, land-use policies, and entrance into World War I pushed for an increase in agricultural production in the Great Plains are all state actions that critics have suggested contributed to the ecological problems in the Great Plains. The film only suggests that government intervention helped resolve the disaster, rather than that it also contributed to its cause.

===Political controversy===
Plains dwellers and politicians had a strong negative reaction to the release of &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot;. People from the region viewed it as a &quot;great libel&quot; against the Great Plains and accused the cameramen and Lorentz of selecting isolated spots to depict the entire region. This sentiment was felt particularly in the Dakotas, where residents and elected officials claimed the movie showed distortions and falsehoods. In the state capital of South Dakota, newspaper publisher J.B Hippie invited people to view the film in his Bijou theatre so that local residents could see how egregious the film was and be outraged at the portrayal of the Great Plains and its people. Because the scenes of the movie focused on the severely damaged counties in Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, Dakotans felt the film did not represent the whole plains region. Because the film did not make a distinction between the Great Plains regions, South Dakotans, in particular, feared that the film would deteriorate the state&#x27;s image and discourage tourism, investors, and cause residents to flee. As a response to the film, South Dakotans created an illustrated pamphlet titled &quot;The True Story of The Plow that Broke the Plains&quot; which the Rural Credit Department distributed. The pamphlet&#x27;s purpose was to display South Dakota&#x27;s wealth and prosperity through modern tractors farming the plains, wheat fields, and herds of cattle. In 1939, the state legislature budgeted $10,000 to advertise the pamphlet across the state. Attorney and Republican state chairman Harlan Bushfield complained that &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; the film &quot;in one savage blow ruthlessly destroyed all the South Dakotans have built up in a generation.&quot; Some residents rejected the criticisms directed at the film and claimed the depictions to be true. One particular resident from Pennington County rebutted Bushfield&#x27;s critique stating that he viewed everything through political eyeglasses and that &quot;his eyesight is affected so much he can&#x27;t tell a desert anymore when he sees one&quot;.

Further condemnation of the film came from the South Dakota Press Association, which petitioned its congressional delegation to get the film withdrawn from circulation due to the belief that it was misrepresenting and harming the state. Because South Dakotans felt that they were more knowledgeable about their own issues and that outsiders such as those involved in New Deal programs had ulterior motives, they rallied behind congressmen Karl Mundt. In Congress Mundt stated that the film was a &quot;malicious and slanderous attempt to misrepresent the homeland of millions of thrifty people living west of the Mississippi River.&quot; Due to efforts from politicians like Mundt, the United States Film Service withdrew &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; from US circulation on April 18, 1939, under the pretense that it would be revised to show the improved agricultural conditions. However, funds never were appropriated to have the planned revision, and &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; was not made available to the public again until 1961. In Mundt&#x27;s 1940 reelection campaign, he listed twenty reasons why he should be re-elected, his first point being that he had driven &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; out of circulation.

==Significance==
===Legacy===
The Resettlement Administration and its successor, the Farm Security Administration, and other government agencies distributed &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; as an educational service. In addition to screenings in the U.S., the &quot;Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; was screened publicly in Canadian educational venues and film societies. At a conference on Canadian-American relations at Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston in Ontario, &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; screened as part of a program of films that highlighted problems of adapting to the North American Environment. Additionally &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; inspired the Canadian film &quot;Heritage&quot; (1939). The Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau produced this film for Canada&#x27;s Department of Agriculture. While not a copy of &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot;, &quot;Heritage&quot; used &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; as a model for how to produce a film particular to Canada&#x27;s own problems in the Great Plains and to make a case for federal government programs. A U.S. government catalog of documentary film classics states that &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; &quot;has been one of the most widely praised and studied documentaries to be produced in America&quot; and that its images &quot;serve sort of visual shorthand which expressed a massive social problem on a more intimate and human scale.&quot; &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; also generated discussion on the future of the Great Plains and brought up the question as to what extent the land of the Great Plains regions should be used for agriculture. Under the National Film Preservation Act &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; was selected for preservation in 1999 as it was deemed to be &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically&quot; significant.

===Political legacy===
Following the success of &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; and &quot;The River&quot; (1938), President Roosevelt became interested in how the government could use documentaries to communicate. Roosevelt attempted to continue the financing of the U.S. Film Service whose purpose was to &quot;coordinate motion picture activities for the federal government, establish a national film library; set minimum standards for future government films, examine scripts for prospective films; give advice to other movie-making entities private or public, and to produce a small number of films in conjunction with other federal agencies&quot;. However, in response conservative Democrats and Republicans criticized the service for misusing Works Progress Administration funds and creating New Deal Propaganda. Due to Congress&#x27;s wariness of funding a propaganda machine, it cut the U.S. Film Service budget and its work ended by June 30, 1940. Following the end of the U.S. Film Service, American film efforts were run solely by Hollywood. &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; was also significant for prospective Democratic congressmen and senators who used the films content to promote their own platforms during their election campaigns.

===Rereleases===
Following its removal from circulation in 1939, &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; was again available to the public in a 1962 release. In 2007 &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; was re-released by Naxos. The 2007 DVD rerelease had a re-rendered soundtrack by Post-Classical Ensemble conducted by Angel Gil-Ordóñez in addition to new sound effects and a new narration by Floyd King. The DVD rerelease also included special features such as a short excerpt of a 1979 interview with Virgil Thomson in which he makes remarks on the creation of the original musical score, among other interviews regarding the creation of the original film.

<text>In parliamentary procedure, a point of order occurs when someone draws attention to a rules violation in a meeting of a deliberative assembly.

==Explanation and uses==

In &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; (RONR), a point of order may be raised if the rules appear to have been broken. This may interrupt a speaker during debate, or anything else if the breach of the rules warrants it. The point is resolved before business continues.

The point of order calls upon the chair to make a ruling. The chair may rule on the point of order or submit it to the judgment of the assembly. If the chair accepts the point of order, it is said to be ruled &quot;well taken&quot;. If not, it is said to be ruled &quot;not well taken&quot;.

Generally, a point of order must be raised at the time the rules are broken or else it would be too late. For example, if a motion was made and discussion began on it, it would be too late to raise a point of order that the motion was not seconded. If such a motion was adopted without a second, it remains valid and not having a second becomes irrelevant.

Exceptions to the rule that a point of order must be raised at the time of violation include that a point of order may be raised at any time a motion was adopted in violation of the bylaws or applicable law, in conflict with a previously adopted motion (unless adopted by the vote to rescind it), or in violation of a fundamental principle of parliamentary law.

The ruling of the chair may be appealed to the assembly in most cases. A majority vote against the chair&#x27;s ruling is required to overturn it.

A point of order is sometimes erroneously used to present a request for information or a parliamentary inquiry. If a member asks such a question, the chair should treat the question as the appropriate request.

==Legislative use==

=== Australia ===
In the Australian House of Representatives a member may raise a point of order with the Speaker at any time, including interrupting another member who is speaking. Once raised a point of order results in the suspension of all other business until the Speaker has given a ruling. A member may dissent from the ruling of a speaker, which must be declared at once, a motion submitted in writing to that effect and the motion must be seconded. The Speaker must then propose the question, which is debatable.

Deriving from British practice, and due to the requirement to remain seated during a division, in the Australian House of Representatives it continues to be customary for a member raising a point of order while the House is voting to hold a sheet of paper over the top of their head.

=== India ===
In the Indian Parliament, both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, a point of order can raised in relation to the business before the House by any member of the parliament. The decision of the Chair is final and no debate is allowed on the point of order, though the Chair may hear members before giving the decision.

=== Ireland ===
In the Irish Oireachtas (parliament), a point of order can be used in relation to order in the assembly. However, the ruling of the chair in this assembly cannot be appealed.

=== United Kingdom === 
Until 1998 in the British House of Commons, it was required that a member raising a point of order while the House is voting must speak &quot;seated and covered&quot;, i.e. wearing a hat. Two opera hats were maintained in the House for this purpose, with members of parliament sometimes covering their head with an Order Paper while the hat was retrieved. This practice was abolished in accordance with the findings of the Select Committee on the Modernisation of the House of Commons, who said that the practice &quot;has almost certainly brought the House into greater ridicule than almost any other, particularly since the advent of television&quot;.

=== United States ===
In the United States Senate, the chair&#x27;s ruling on a point of order may be appealed by any Senator. Points of order with regard to the Budget Act or annual budget resolution may be waived by of the Senate&#x27;s entire membership. Rule XVI, which prohibits normal legislation in appropriations legislation, may be waived by of the Senate.

The United States House of Representatives also allows points of order and appeals, although they are very rare following the abolishment of open rules in 2016, as they are routinely waived by the United States House Committee on Rules.

<text>The Poor Little Rich Girl is a 1917 American comedy-drama film directed by Maurice Tourneur. Adapted by Frances Marion from the 1913 play by Eleanor Gates. The Broadway play actually starred future screen actress Viola Dana. The film stars Mary Pickford, Madlaine Traverse, Charles Wellesley, Gladys Fairbanks (returning from the play) and Frank McGlynn Sr.

The film was shot in Fort Lee, New Jersey when early film studios in America&#x27;s first motion picture industry were based there at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1991, &quot;The Poor Little Rich Girl&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==Plot==

Gwendolyn is an 11-year-old girl who is left by her rich and busy parents to the care of unsympathetic domestic workers at the family&#x27;s mansion. Her mother is only interested in her social life and her father has serious financial problems and is even contemplating suicide. 
When she manages to have some good time with an organ-grinder or a plumber, or have a mud-fight with street boys, she is rapidly brought back on the right track. 
One day, she becomes sick because the maid has given her an extra dose of sleeping medicine to be able to go out. She then becomes delirious and starts seeing an imaginary world inspired by people and things around her; the Garden of Lonely Children in the Tell-Tale forest. Her conditions worsen and Death tries to lure her to eternal rest. But Life also appears to her and finally wins.

==Cast==
* Mary Pickford as Gwendolyn
* Madlaine Traverse as Gwendolyn&#x27;s Mother
* Charles Wellesley as Gwendolyn&#x27;s Father

* Marcia Harris as Miss Royale
* Charles Craig as Thomas
* Frank Andrews as Potter
* Herbert Prior as The Doctor
* George Gernon as Johnny Blake
* Maxine Elliott Hicks as Susie May Squoggs

==Retrospective appraisal==
Film historian Edward Wagenknecht identifies &quot;The Poor Little Rich Girl&quot; as an inflection point in Mary Pickford’s screen portrayals: ““[I]t was not until after the beginning of the feature film era that Miss Pickford became definitely associated with &quot;ingénue&quot; roles and it was not until &quot;The Poor Little Rich Girl&quot; that she appeared all through a feature as a child.” Wagenknecht adds that Pickford’s character Gwen “is very different from either Rebecca or Pollyanna—more helpless and less resourceful and considerably more wistful.”

Twenty-five-years-of-age when the film was released, Pickford struggled to transition to more mature roles later in her career.

<doc id="76018" wikidata="Q379873" url="?curid=76018" title="Who Framed Roger Rabbit">
<text>Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a 1988 American fantasy comedy film directed by Robert Zemeckis from a screenplay written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman. It is loosely based on the 1981 novel &quot;Who Censored Roger Rabbit?&quot; by Gary K. Wolf. The film stars Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd, Stubby Kaye, and Joanna Cassidy, along with the voices of Charles Fleischer and an uncredited Kathleen Turner. Combining live-action and animation, the film is set in an alternate history Hollywood in 1947, where humans and cartoon characters (referred to as &quot;toons&quot;) co-exist. Its plot follows Eddie Valiant, a private investigator with a grudge against toons, who must help exonerate Roger Rabbit, a toon framed for murder.

Walt Disney Pictures purchased the film rights for the story in 1981. Price and Seaman wrote two drafts of the script before Disney brought in executive producer Steven Spielberg and his production company, Amblin Entertainment. Zemeckis was brought on to direct, and Canadian animator Richard Williams was hired to supervise the animation sequences. Production was moved from Los Angeles to Elstree Studios in England to accommodate Williams and his group of animators. While filming, the production budget rapidly expanded, and the shooting schedule ran longer than expected.

&quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; was released through Disney&#x27;s Touchstone Pictures banner in the United States on June 22, 1988. The film received critical acclaim for its visuals, humor, writing, performances, and groundbreaking combination of live-action and animation. It grossed over $351 million worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 1988, behind &quot;Rain Man&quot;. It brought a renewed interest in the golden age of American animation, spearheading modern American animation and the Disney Renaissance. It won three Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Visual Effects and received a Special Achievement Academy Award for Williams&#x27; animation direction.

In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

In 1947 Los Angeles, animated cartoon characters, or &quot;toons&quot;, co-exist with humans, often employing their skills to entertain as film stars. Private detective Eddie Valiant, once a staunch ally of the toons alongside his brother and co-worker Teddy, has become a depressed alcoholic following Teddy&#x27;s murder by an unknown toon five years earlier. Maroon Cartoon Studios owner R.K. Maroon, upset about the recent poor performance of his toon star Roger Rabbit, hires Eddie to investigate rumors that Roger&#x27;s glamorous toon wife, Jessica, is having an affair with Marvin Acme, owner of both the Acme Corporation and Toontown, the animated metropolis in which toons reside.

After watching Jessica perform at The Ink and Paint Club, Eddie secretly photographs her and Acme playing patty-cake. He shows the pictures to Roger, who becomes distraught and flees, refusing to believe Jessica was unfaithful. The next morning, Acme is found murdered and evidence at the scene implicates Roger as a suspect. Eddie meets Judge Doom, the sinister human judge of Toontown—having bribed the electorate to gain their votes—and his five weasel minions, the Toon Patrol. Doom confirms he plans to execute Roger using the &quot;Dip&quot;, a chemical concoction of acetone, benzene, and turpentine which is capable of destroying the otherwise invulnerable toons.

Roger&#x27;s toon co-star, Baby Herman, suggests to Eddie that Acme&#x27;s missing will—which supposedly bequeaths Toontown to the toons—may have been the killer&#x27;s true motive. Eddie returns to his office and finds Roger waiting. Roger insists he has been framed and Eddie reluctantly agrees to help after finding evidence of Acme&#x27;s will; he hides Roger in a bar tended by his girlfriend, Dolores. Jessica tells Eddie that Maroon threatened Roger&#x27;s career unless she posed for the compromising photos. Meanwhile, Dolores&#x27;s research uncovers that Cloverleaf Industries recently bought the city&#x27;s Pacific Electric railway system and will purchase Toontown at midnight unless Acme&#x27;s will is found. Doom and the Toon Patrol find Roger, but he and Eddie escape with help from Benny, a toon taxi cab. Sheltering in a local movie theater, Eddie sees a newsreel of Maroon selling his studio to Cloverleaf.

While Eddie goes to the studio to interrogate Maroon, Jessica abducts Roger. Maroon denies involvement in Acme&#x27;s murder, admitting he intended to blackmail Acme into selling his company as otherwise Cloverleaf would not buy the studio. Maroon is assassinated and Eddie spots Jessica fleeing the scene. Assuming she is the assailant, he reluctantly follows her into Toontown, choosing to discard the last of his alcohol. After saving Eddie from being shot by Doom, Jessica reveals her actions were to ensure Roger&#x27;s safety and it was Doom who killed Acme and Maroon. Acme gave his will to Jessica for safety but, when she examined it, the paper was blank.

Doom and the Toon Patrol capture Jessica and Eddie, bringing them to Acme&#x27;s factory. Doom reveals he is the sole shareholder of Cloverleaf and plans to erase Toontown with a Dip-spraying machine so he can build a freeway in its place, and decommission the railway system to force people to use it. When Roger unsuccessfully attempts to save Jessica, the couple is tied onto a hook in front of the machine&#x27;s sprayer. Eddie distracts the weasels by performing a comedic vaudeville act full of pratfalls, causing them to die of laughter before he kicks their leader into the Dip. Doom is flattened by a steamroller while fighting with Eddie, but he survives, revealing he is actually a disguised toon and Teddy&#x27;s murderer. Struggling against Doom&#x27;s toon abilities, Eddie empties the machine&#x27;s Dip supply, spraying and dissolving Doom to death. The machine crashes through the wall into Toontown, where it is destroyed by a passenger train.

As police and toons gather at the scene, Eddie realizes that Acme&#x27;s will was written on the blank paper in temporarily invisible ink, confirming the toons inherit Toontown. Having regained his sense of humor, Eddie happily enters Toontown alongside Dolores, Roger, Jessica, and the toons.

==Production==
===Development===
Walt Disney Productions purchased the film rights to Gary K. Wolf&#x27;s novel &quot;Who Censored Roger Rabbit?&quot; shortly after its publication in 1981. Ron W. Miller, then president of Disney, saw it as a perfect opportunity to produce a blockbuster. Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were hired to write the script, penning two drafts. Robert Zemeckis offered his services as director in 1982, but Disney declined as his two previous films (&quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;Used Cars&quot;) had been box-office bombs. Between 1981 and 1983 Disney developed test footage with Darrell Van Citters as animation director, Paul Reubens voicing Roger Rabbit, Peter Renaday as Eddie Valiant, and Russi Taylor as Jessica Rabbit. The project was revamped in 1985 by Michael Eisner, the then-new CEO of Disney. Amblin Entertainment, which consisted of Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, were approached to produce &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; alongside Disney. The original budget was projected at $50 million, which Disney felt was too expensive.

The film was finally green-lit when the budget decreased to $30 million, which at the time would have still made it the most expensive animated film ever produced. Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg argued that the hybrid of live-action and animation would &quot;save&quot; Walt Disney Feature Animation. Spielberg&#x27;s contract included an extensive amount of creative control and a large percentage of the box-office profits. Disney kept all merchandising rights. Spielberg convinced Warner Bros., Fleischer Studios, Harvey Comics, King Features Syndicate, Felix the Cat Productions, Turner Entertainment, and Universal Pictures/Walter Lantz Productions to &quot;lend&quot; their characters to appear in the film with (in some cases) stipulations on how those characters were portrayed; for example, Disney&#x27;s Donald Duck and Warner Bros.&#x27; Daffy Duck appear as equally talented dueling pianists, and Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny also share a scene. Apart from the agreement, and some of the original voice artists reprising their roles, Warner Bros. and the various other companies were not involved in the production of &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot;. Executives at Warner Bros. were displeased by animators using the Daffy design by Bob Clampett and demanded they use the design by Chuck Jones; in response Zemeckis had separate artists animate Daffy using Jones&#x27; design to satisfy Warner Bros., in order to have Clampett&#x27;s design in the final film. The producers were unable to acquire the rights to use Popeye, Tom and Jerry, Little Lulu, Casper, or the Terrytoons characters for appearances from their respective owners (King Features, Turner, Western Publishing, Harvey Comics, and Viacom).

Terry Gilliam was offered the chance to direct, but he found the project too technically challenging. (&quot;Pure laziness on my part,&quot; he later admitted, &quot;I completely regret that decision.&quot;) Robert Zemeckis was hired to direct in 1985, based on the success of &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. Disney executives were continuing to suggest Darrell Van Citters direct the animation, but Spielberg and Zemeckis decided against it. Richard Williams was eventually hired to direct the animation. Zemeckis wanted the film to exhibit &quot;Disney&#x27;s high quality of animation, Warner Bros.&#x27; characterization, and Tex Avery humor.&quot;

===Casting===
Harrison Ford was Spielberg&#x27;s original choice to play Eddie Valiant, but his price was too high. Chevy Chase was the second choice, but he was not interested. Bill Murray was also considered for the role, but due to his idiosyncratic method of receiving offers for roles, Murray missed out on it. Eddie Murphy reportedly turned down the role as he misunderstood the concept of toons and humans co-existing; he later regretted this decision. Robin Williams, Robert Redford, Jack Nicholson, Sylvester Stallone, Edward James Olmos, Wallace Shawn, Ed Harris, Charles Grodin and Don Lane were also considered for the role. Ultimately, Bob Hoskins was chosen by Spielberg because of his acting skill and because Spielberg believed he had a hopeful demeanor and he looked like he belonged in that era.

Paul Reubens originally auditioned for the role of Roger Rabbit and even provided his voice in an early 1983 screen test, but lost out. Eddie Deezen, who had worked with Zemeckis previously, also auditioned to play Roger, but did not get the part. The role was eventually given to Charles Fleischer. Before filming, Fleischer was asked to come up with a speech impediment for Roger. He gave Roger a lisp and the stammering catchphrase &quot;P-p-p-please!&quot; as a tribute to all the other famous cartoon characters with speech impediments, which was inspired by Huntz Hall&#x27;s Sach Jones in &quot;The Bowery Boys&quot;. He had invented the &quot;cheek flutter&quot; while performing the voice of B.B. in &quot;Deadly Friend&quot;. His portrayal of Roger was also inspired by Screwy Squirrel. To facilitate Hoskins&#x27; performance, Fleischer dressed in a Roger Rabbit costume and &quot;stood in&quot; behind camera for most scenes. Williams explained Roger was a combination of &quot;Tex Avery&#x27;s cashew nut-shaped head, the swatch of red hair... like Droopy&#x27;s, Goofy&#x27;s overalls, Porky Pig&#x27;s bow tie, Mickey Mouse&#x27;s gloves, and Bugs Bunny-like cheeks and ears.&quot;

Kathleen Turner provided the uncredited voice of Jessica Rabbit, Roger Rabbit&#x27;s wife.

Tim Curry auditioned for the role of Judge Doom, but was rejected because the producers found him too terrifying. Christopher Lee was also considered for the role, but turned it down. John Cleese also expressed interest for the role, but was deemed not scary enough. Peter O&#x27;Toole, F. Murray Abraham, Roddy McDowall, Eddie Deezen, and Sting were also considered for the role. Christopher Lloyd was cast because he previously worked with Zemeckis and Spielberg on &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. He compared his part as Doom to his previous role as the Klingon commander Kruge in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;, both overly evil characters which he considered &quot;fun to play&quot;. He avoided blinking his eyes while on camera to portray the character.

Fleischer also voiced Benny the Cab, Psycho, and Greasy. Lou Hirsch, who voiced Baby Herman, was the original choice for Benny the Cab but was replaced by Fleischer.

===Writing===

Price and Seaman were brought aboard to continue writing the script once Spielberg and Zemeckis were hired. For inspiration, the two writers studied the work of Walt Disney and Warner Bros. Cartoons from the Golden Age of American animation, especially Tex Avery and Bob Clampett cartoons. The Cloverleaf streetcar subplot was inspired by &quot;Chinatown&quot;. Price and Seaman said that &quot;the Red Car plot, suburb expansion, urban and political corruption really did happen,&quot; Price stated. &quot;In Los Angeles, during the 1940s, car and tire companies teamed up against the Pacific Electric Railway system and bought them out of business. Where the freeway runs in Los Angeles is where the Red Car used to be.&quot; In Wolf&#x27;s novel &quot;Who Censored Roger Rabbit?&quot;, the toons were comic-strip characters rather than movie stars.

During the writing process, Price and Seaman were unsure of whom to include as the villain in the plot. They wrote scripts that had either Jessica Rabbit or Baby Herman as the villain, but they made their final decision with the newly created character Judge Doom. Doom was supposed to have an animated vulture sit on his shoulder, but this was deleted due to the technical challenges this posed. Doom would also have a suitcase of 12 small, animated kangaroos that act as a jury, by having their joeys pop out of their pouches, each with letters, when put together would spell YOU ARE GUILTY. This was also cut for budget and technical reasons.

The Toon Patrol (Stupid, Smart Ass, Greasy, Wheezy, and Psycho) satirizes the Seven Dwarfs (Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey), who appeared in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937). Originally seven weasels were to mimic the dwarfs complement, but eventually two of them, Slimey and Sleazy, were written out of the script. Further references included The Ink and Paint Club resembling the Harlem Cotton Club, while Zemeckis compared Judge Doom&#x27;s invention of the Dip to eliminate all the toons to Hitler&#x27;s Final Solution. Doom was originally the hunter who killed Bambi&#x27;s mother. Benny the Cab was first conceived to be a Volkswagen Beetle before being changed to a taxi cab. Ideas originally conceived for the story also included a sequence set at Marvin Acme&#x27;s funeral, whose attendees included Eddie, Foghorn Leghorn, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Tom and Jerry, Heckle and Jeckle, Chip n&#x27; Dale, Felix the Cat, Herman and Katnip, Yakky Doodle, Mighty Mouse, Superman, Popeye, Olive Oyl, Bluto, Clarabelle Cow, Horace Horsecollar, the Seven Dwarfs, Baby Huey, and Casper the Friendly Ghost in cameo appearances. This scene was cut for pacing reasons at the storyboard stage. Before finally agreeing on &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; as the film&#x27;s title, working titles included &quot;Murder in Toontown&quot;, &quot;Toons&quot;, &quot;Dead Toons Don&#x27;t Pay Bills&quot;, &quot;The Toontown Trial&quot;, &quot;Trouble in Toontown&quot;, and &quot;Eddie Goes to Toontown&quot;.

===Filming===
Williams admitted he was &quot;openly disdainful of the Disney bureaucracy&quot; and refused to work in Los Angeles. Accommodating Williams and his animators, production moved to England where a studio, Walt Disney Animation UK (subsuming Richard Williams Animation), was created for this purpose; located at The Forum, 74–80 Camden Street, in Camden Town, London, while the live-action production was based at Elstree Studios. Disney and Spielberg also told Williams that in return for doing the film, they would help distribute his unfinished film &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot;. Supervising animators included Van Citters, Dale Baer, Michael Peraza, Joe Ranft, Tom Sito, James Baxter, David Bowers, Andreas Deja, Mike Gabriel, Chris Jenkins, Phil Nibbelink, Nik Ranieri, Simon Wells, and Bruce W. Smith; Williams and associate producer Don Hahn spearheaded the animation production. The animation production was split between Walt Disney Animation UK and a specialized unit in Los Angeles, set up by Walt Disney Feature Animation and supervised by Baer. The production budget continued to escalate, while the shooting schedule ran longer than expected. When the budget reached $40 million, Disney CEO Michael Eisner seriously considered shutting down production, but studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg talked him out of it. Despite the budget escalating to over $50 million, Disney moved forward on production because they were enthusiastic to work with Spielberg.

VistaVision cameras installed with motion-control technology were used for the photography of the live-action scenes, which would be composited with animation. Rubber mannequins of Roger Rabbit, Baby Herman, and the Toon Patrol portrayed the animated characters during rehearsals to teach the actors where to look when acting with &quot;open air and imaginative cartoon characters&quot;. Many of the live-action props held by cartoon characters were shot on set with the props either held by robotic arms or manipulated with strings, similar to a marionette. For example, a test was shot at ILM where an actor playing the detective would climb down a fire escape and the rabbit is supposed to follow and he knocks down some stacked boxes. Naturally, there would not be a rabbit during the test, so the camera would go down the fire escape and the boxes would fall when a wire was pulled. The actor who played the voice of Roger, Charles Fleischer, insisted on wearing a Roger Rabbit costume while on the set, to get into character. Filming began on November 2, 1986, and lasted for seven and a half months at Elstree Studios, with an additional month in Los Angeles and at Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) for blue screen effects of Toontown. The Dimco Buildings in London were dressed as the fictional Acme Factory. The entrance of Desilu Studios in Los Angeles served as the fictional Maroon Cartoon Studio lot.

===Animation and post-production===
Post-production lasted for 14 months. ILM had already used CGI and digital compositing in a few movies, such as the stained glass knight scene in &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot;, but the computers were still not powerful enough to make a complicated movie like &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, so all the animation was done using cels and optical compositing. First, the animators and layout artists were given black-and-white printouts of the live-action scenes (known as &quot;photostats&quot;), and they placed their animation paper on top of them. The artists then drew the animated characters in relationship to the live-action footage. Due to Zemeckis&#x27; dynamic camera moves, the animators had to confront the challenge of ensuring the characters were not &quot;slipping and slipping all over the place.&quot; Ensuring this did not happen and that the characters looked real, Zemeckis and Spielberg met for about an hour and a half and came up with an idea: &quot;If the rabbit sits down in an old chair, dust comes up. He should always be touching something real.&quot; After the rough animation was complete, it was run through the normal process of traditional animation until the cels were shot on the rostrum camera with no background. Williams came up with the idea of making the cartoon characters “2.5-dimensional”, and the animated footage was sent to ILM for compositing, where technicians animated three lighting layers (shadows, highlights, and tone mattes) separately, to give the characters a sense of depth and create the illusion of them affected by the set lighting. Finally, the lighting effects were optically composited on to the cartoon characters, who were, in turn, composited into the live-action footage. One of the most difficult effects in the film was Jessica&#x27;s dress in the nightclub scene because it had to flash sequins, an effect accomplished by filtering light through a plastic bag scratched with steel wool.

===Music===

Regular Zemeckis collaborator Alan Silvestri composed the film score, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) under the direction of Silvestri. Zemeckis joked that &quot;the British [musicians] could not keep up with Silvestri&#x27;s jazz tempo&quot;. The performances of the music themes written for Jessica Rabbit were entirely improvised by a jazz combo performing with the LSO. The work of American composer Carl Stalling heavily influenced Silvestri&#x27;s work on &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. The film&#x27;s soundtrack was originally released by Buena Vista Records on June 22, 1988, and reissued on CD on April 16, 2002.

On January 23, 2018, Intrada Records released a three-CD set with the complete score, alternates, and a remastered version of the original 1988 album, plus music from three Roger Rabbit short films, composed and conducted by Bruce Broughton and James Horner. Mondo Records and Walt Disney Records reissued the original 1988 album on vinyl on September 17, 2021.

The film features performances of &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody&quot; (Tony Anselmo and Mel Blanc), &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Do Right?&quot; (Amy Irving), &quot;The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down&quot; (Charles Fleischer), and &quot;Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!&quot; (Toon Chorus).

==Release==
Michael Eisner, then-CEO, and Roy E. Disney, who was the vice chairman of The Walt Disney Company, felt the film was too risqué with adult themes and sexual references. Eisner and Zemeckis disagreed over various elements of it but since Zemeckis had final cut privilege, he refused to make alterations. Roy E. Disney, head of Walt Disney Feature Animation along with studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, felt it was appropriate to release the film under the studio&#x27;s adult-orientated Touchstone Pictures banner instead of the flagship Walt Disney Pictures banner.

=== Box office ===
The film opened in the United States on June 22, 1988, grossing $11.2 million in 1,045 theaters during its opening weekend; it was in first place at the US box office. It was Disney&#x27;s biggest opening weekend ever at the time of its release. It went on to gross $154.1 million in the United States and Canada and $197.4 million internationally, coming to a worldwide total of $351.5 million. At the time of release, it was the 20th-highest-grossing film of all time. It was also the second-highest-grossing film of 1988, behind only &quot;Rain Man&quot;. In the United Kingdom, the film also set a record opening for a Disney film.

===Home media===
The film was first released on VHS on October 12, 1989, and on DVD on September 28, 1999.

On March 25, 2003, Buena Vista Home Entertainment released it as a part of the &quot;Vista Series&quot; line in a two-disc collection with many extra features including a documentary, &quot;Behind the Ears: The True Story of Roger Rabbit&quot;; a deleted scene in which a pig&#x27;s head is &quot;tooned&quot; onto Eddie&#x27;s; the three Roger Rabbit shorts, &quot;Tummy Trouble&quot;, &quot;Roller Coaster Rabbit&quot;, and &quot;Trail Mix-Up&quot;; as well as a booklet and interactive games. The only short on the 2003 VHS release was &quot;Tummy Trouble&quot;. The 2003 DVD release presents the film in Full Screen (1.33:1) on Disc 1 and Widescreen (1.85:1) on Disc 2.

On March 12, 2013, Disney released the film on Blu-ray and DVD combo pack special edition for the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary. The film was also digitally restored for the release; frame-by-frame digital restoration was done by Prasad Studios removing dirt, tears, scratches, and other defects. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on December 7, 2021.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; received near-universal acclaim from critics, making &quot;Business Insider&quot;″s &quot;best comedy movies of all time, according to critics&quot; list. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of based on 76 reviews, and an average rating of 8.5/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; is an innovative and entertaining film that features a groundbreaking mix of live action and animation, with a touching and original story to boot.&quot; Aggregator Metacritic has calculated a weighted average score of 83 out of 100 based on 15 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; was placed on 43 critics&#x27; top ten lists, third to only &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; and &quot;Bull Durham&quot; in 1988. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars out of four, calling it &quot;sheer, enchanted entertainment from the first frame to the last-- a joyous, giddy, goofy celebration of the kind of fun you can have with a movie camera.&quot; He writes that the opening cartoon is &quot;a masterpiece; I can&#x27;t remember the last time I laughed so hard at an animated short. But then when a stunt goes wrong and the cartoon &#x27;baby&#x27; stalks off the set and lights a cigar and tells the human director to go to hell, we know we&#x27;re in a new and special universe.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; praised the film&#x27;s &quot;dazzling, jaw-dropping opening four-minute sequence&quot;; he noted that the sequence alone took nearly nine months to animate. Siskel gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four. Ebert and his colleague Siskel spent a considerable amount of time in the &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot; episode in which they reviewed the film analyzing its painstaking filmmaking. In evaluating their top ten films of the year, Siskel ranked it number two while Ebert ranked it as number eight. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that this is &quot;a film whose best moments are so novel, so deliriously funny and so crazily unexpected that they truly must be seen to be believed.&quot; Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; considered &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; to be &quot;a definitive collaboration of pure talent. Zemeckis had Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; enthusiastic backing, producer Steven Spielberg&#x27;s pull, Warner Bros.&#x27;s blessing, Canadian animator Richard Williams&#x27; ink and paint, Mel Blanc&#x27;s voice; Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman&#x27;s witty, frenetic screenplay; George Lucas&#x27; Industrial Light and Magic, and Bob Hoskins&#x27; comical performance as the burliest, shaggiest private eye.&quot; Gene Shalit on the &quot;Today Show&quot; also praised the film, calling it &quot;one of the most extraordinary movies ever made&quot;. Filmsite.org called it &quot;a technically-marvelous film&quot; and a &quot;landmark&quot; that resulted from &quot;unprecedented cooperation&quot; between Warner Bros. and Disney. On CNN&#x27;s 2019 miniseries &quot;The Movies&quot;, Tom Hanks called it the &quot;most complicated movie ever made.&quot;

Richard Corliss, a writer for &quot;Time&quot;, said, &quot;The opening scene upstages the movie that emerges from it&quot;. Corliss was mainly annoyed by the homages to the Golden Age of American animation. Chuck Jones made a rather scathing attack on the film in his book &quot;Chuck Jones Conversations&quot;. Among his complaints, Jones accused Zemeckis of robbing Richard Williams of any creative input and ruining the piano duel that both Williams and he storyboarded.

===Accolades===
==Legacy==
The critical and commercial success of the film rekindled an interest in the Golden Age of American animation, and in addition to sparking the Silver Age of American animation and the Disney Renaissance, it has also gained a cult following. In November 1988, a few months after the film&#x27;s release, Roger Rabbit made his guest appearance in the live-action and animated television special broadcast on NBC called &quot;Mickey&#x27;s 60th Birthday&quot; in which to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Mickey Mouse. In 1991, Walt Disney Imagineering began to develop Mickey&#x27;s Toontown for Disneyland, based on the Toontown that appeared in the film. The attraction also features a ride called Roger Rabbit&#x27;s Car Toon Spin. Three theatrical animated shorts were also produced: &quot;Tummy Trouble&quot; was shown before &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;; &quot;Roller Coaster Rabbit&quot; was shown before &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;; and &quot;Trail Mix-Up&quot; was shown before &quot;A Far Off Place&quot;. The film also inspired a short-lived comic book and video game spin-offs, including two PC games, the Japanese version of &quot;The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle&quot; (which features Roger instead of Bugs), a 1989 game released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and a 1991 game released on the Game Boy.

In December 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

&quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; served as inspiration for various live-action/animation films in the following decades including &quot;Cool World&quot;, &quot;Space Jam&quot;, &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry&quot;, &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, and &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;.

===Controversies===
With the film&#x27;s LaserDisc release, &quot;Variety&quot; first reported in March 1994 that observers uncovered several scenes of antics from the animators that supposedly featured brief nudity of Jessica Rabbit. While undetectable when played at the usual rate of 24 film frames per second, the LaserDisc player allowed the viewer to advance frame-by-frame to uncover these visuals. Whether or not they were actually intended to depict the nudity of the character remains unknown. Many retailers said that within minutes of the LaserDisc debut, their entire inventory was sold out. The run was fueled by media reports about the controversy, including stories on CNN and various newspapers.

Another frequently debated scene includes one in which Baby Herman extends his middle finger as he passes under a woman&#x27;s dress and re-emerges with drool on his lip. In the scene where Daffy Duck and Donald Duck are dueling on pianos, some heard Donald call Daffy a &quot;goddamn stupid nigger&quot;, rather than the scripted and recorded line &quot;doggone stubborn little&quot;.

===Legal issue===
Gary K. Wolf, author of the novel &quot;Who Censored Roger Rabbit?&quot;, filed a lawsuit in 2001 against The Walt Disney Company. He claimed he was owed royalties based on the value of &quot;gross receipts&quot; and merchandising sales. In 2002, the trial court in the case ruled that these only referred to actual cash receipts Disney collected and denied Wolf&#x27;s claim. In its January 2004 ruling, the California Court of Appeal disagreed, finding that expert testimony introduced by Wolf regarding the customary use of &quot;gross receipts&quot; in the entertainment business could support a broader reading of the term. The ruling vacated the trial court&#x27;s order in favor of Disney and remanded the case for further proceedings. In a March 2005 hearing, Wolf estimated he was owed $7 million. Disney&#x27;s attorneys not only disputed the claim but also said Wolf owed Disney $500,000–$1 million because of an accounting error discovered in preparing for the lawsuit. Wolf won the decision in 2005, receiving between $180,000 and $400,000 in damages.

===Proposed sequel===
Spielberg discussed a sequel in 1989 with J. J. Abrams as writer and Zemeckis as producer. Abrams&#x27; outline was eventually abandoned. Nat Mauldin was hired to write a prequel titled &quot;Roger Rabbit: The Toon Platoon&quot;, set in 1941 to 1943. Similar to the previous film, &quot;Toon Platoon&quot; featured many cameo appearances by characters from The Golden Age of American Animation. It began with Roger Rabbit&#x27;s early years, living on a farm in the midwestern United States. With human Ritchie Davenport, Roger travels west to seek his mother, in the process meeting Jessica Krupnick (his future wife), a struggling Hollywood actress. While Roger and Ritchie are enlisting in the Army, Jessica is kidnapped and forced to make pro-Nazi German broadcasts. Roger and Ritchie must save her by going into Nazi-occupied Europe accompanied by several other Toons in their Army platoon. After their triumph, Roger and Ritchie are given a Hollywood Boulevard parade, and Roger is finally reunited with his mother and father, Bugs Bunny.

Mauldin later retitled his script &quot;Who Discovered Roger Rabbit&quot;. Spielberg left the project when deciding he could not satirize Nazis after directing &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. Eisner commissioned a rewrite in 1997 with Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver. Although they kept Roger&#x27;s search for his mother, Stoner and Oliver replaced the WWII subplot with Roger&#x27;s inadvertent rise to stardom on Broadway and Hollywood. Disney was impressed and Alan Menken was hired to write five songs for the film and offered his services as executive producer. One of the songs, &quot;This Only Happens in the Movies&quot;, was recorded in 2008 on the debut album of Broadway actress Kerry Butler. Eric Goldberg was set to be the new animation director, and began to redesign Roger&#x27;s new character appearance.

Spielberg became busy establishing DreamWorks, while Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy decided to remain as producers. Test footage for &quot;Who Discovered Roger Rabbit&quot; was shot sometime in 1998 at the Disney animation unit in Lake Buena Vista, Florida; the results were a mix of CGI, traditional animation, and live-action that did not please Disney. A second test had the toons completely converted to CGI, but this was dropped as the film&#x27;s projected budget would escalate past $100 million. Eisner felt it was best to cancel the film. In March 2003, producer Don Hahn doubted a sequel, arguing that public tastes had changed since the 1990s with the rise of computer animation. &quot;There was something very special about that time when animation was not as much in the forefront as it is now.&quot;

In December 2007, Marshall stated that he was still &quot;open&quot; to the idea, and in April 2009, Zemeckis revealed he was still interested. According to a 2009 MTV News story, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were writing a new script for the project, and the animated characters would be in traditional two-dimensional, while the rest would be in motion capture. In 2010, Bob Hoskins had agreed to sign on for a sequel, but expressed scepticism about the use of &quot;performance capture&quot; in the film. Zemeckis said that the sequel would remain hand-drawn animated and live-action sequences will be filmed, just like in the original film, but the lighting effects on the cartoon characters and some of the props that the toons handle will be done digitally. Also in 2010, Hahn, who was the film&#x27;s original associate producer, confirmed the sequel&#x27;s development in an interview with &quot;Empire&quot;. He stated, &quot;Yeah, I couldn&#x27;t possibly comment. I deny completely, but yeah... if you&#x27;re a fan, pretty soon you&#x27;re going to be very, very, very happy.&quot; Hoskins retired from acting in 2012 after a Parkinson&#x27;s disease diagnosis a year earlier, and died from pneumonia in 2014. Marshall confirmed that the film would be a prequel, similar to earlier drafts, and that the writing was almost complete. During an interview at the premiere of his film &quot;Flight&quot;, Zemeckis stated that the sequel was still possible, despite Hoskins&#x27; absence, and the script for the sequel was sent to Disney for approval from studio executives.

In February 2013, Gary K. Wolf, writer of the original novel, said Erik Von Wodtke and he were working on a development proposal for an animated Disney buddy comedy starring Mickey Mouse and Roger Rabbit called &quot;The Stooge&quot;, based on the 1952 film of the same name. The proposed film is set in a prequel, taking place five years before &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; and part of the story is about how Roger met Jessica. Wolf has stated the film is currently wending its way through Disney.

In November 2016, while promoting his film &quot;Allied&quot; in England, Zemeckis stated that the sequel &quot;moves the story of Roger and Jessica Rabbit into the next few years of period film, moving on from film noir to the world of the 1950s&quot;. He also stated that the sequel would feature a &quot;digital Bob Hoskins&quot;, as Eddie Valiant would return in &quot;ghost form&quot;. While the director went on to state that the script is &quot;terrific&quot; and the film would still use hand-drawn animation, Zemeckis thinks that the chances of Disney green-lighting the sequel are &quot;slim&quot;. As he explained more in detail, &quot;The current corporate Disney culture has no interest in Roger, and they certainly don&#x27;t like Jessica at all&quot;. In December 2018, while promoting his film &quot;Welcome to Marwen&quot; and given the 30th anniversary of &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, Zemeckis reiterated in an interview with Yahoo! Movies that though the sequel&#x27;s script is &quot;wonderful&quot;, Disney is still unlikely to ever produce it, and he does not see the possibility of producing it as an original film for the streaming service Disney+, as he feels that it does not make any sense as there is no &quot;Princess&quot; in it. In November 2024, while promoting his latest film &quot;Here&quot;, Zemeckis again said that one of the reasons Disney will never produce the script, &quot;as good as it is&quot;, is that Disney finds Jessica Rabbit &quot;too hot&quot;, citing that they dressed her in a trench coat in the Disneyland attraction &quot;Roger Rabbit&#x27;s Car Toon Spin&quot;. Zemeckis said that the original film was made at the right time.

<doc id="76019" wikidata="Q3182445" url="?curid=76019" title="Henry Fillmore">
<text>Henry Fillmore (December 3, 1881 – December 7, 1956) was an American musician, composer, publisher, and bandleader, best known for his many marches and screamers, a few of which he wrote for the Band of the Hour at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida. 

==Early life and education==
Fillmore was born in Cincinnati, Ohio as the eldest of five children. In his youth. he mastered piano, guitar, violin, flute, and slide trombone. He kept his trombone activities a secret at first, as his circumspect religious father James Henry Fillmore (1849–1936)—a composer of gospel songs, often in collaboration with Jessie Brown Pounds—believed it an uncouth and sinful instrument. Henry&#x27;s mother secretly bought a used trombone for him and obscured from Henry&#x27;s father the son&#x27;s learning to play the instrument. Fillmore, whose uncle, Frederick A. Fillmore (1856–1925) was also a tune-composer for gospel songs, was a singer for his church choir as a boy. He began composing at 18, with his first published march &quot;Hingham&quot;, named after a line of brass instruments.

Fillmore entered the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music in 1901.

==Personal life==
After graduating from the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, Fillmore traveled the United States as a circus bandmaster with his wife, an exotic vaudeville dancer named Mabel May Jones. They were married in St. Louis.

==Career==
During the 1920s, Fillmore was back in Cincinnati conducting the Shriners Temple Band, which he turned into one of the best marching bands in the country. After the death of John Phillip Sousa in 1932, he was often called &quot;The March King&quot;.

===Fillmore Music House===

The Fillmore Music House was co-founded in 1874 by his father, James Fillmore, and his uncle, Frederick Fillmore, under the &quot;Fillmore Brothers&quot; name, which began as a Cincinnati-based hymnal publisher. When Henry Fillmore became president after his father&#x27;s death in 1937, he transformed the firm to focus on orchestral and band music, along with musical instrument sales. In 1951, he announced the Fillmore Music Shop would become an affiliate of Carl Fischer Music of New York, with the condition that it would still operate under the Fillmore name and that all thirteen employees would continue in their employment at the store&#x27;s 528 Elm Street location.

===Florida band work===

In 1938, Fillmore, after being advised by a physician that he had just a few months to live, retired to Miami, Florida. He went on, however, to prove the physician wrong, keeping an active schedule rehearsing high school bands in Florida and composing marches. The Henry Fillmore Band Hall, the rehearsal hall for many of the University of Miami&#x27;s performing groups, acquired its name as a tribute to Fillmore&#x27;s work in the band genre. The hall houses the Fillmore Museum. His march &quot;Orange Bowl&quot; was written for Miami&#x27;s Band of the Hour. &quot;Uncle Henry&quot;, as Fillmore was affectionately known to the members of the &quot;Band of the Hour&quot;, also wrote the University of Miami&#x27;s current official fight song – &quot;Miami U How-De-Doo&quot;. His arrangement of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; is performed by the Florida State University Marching Chiefs. His march &quot;Men of Florida&quot; was composed for the bands at the University of Florida. He was given an Honorary Doctorate of Music by the University of Miami in 1956 in recognition of his career. Fillmore lived out the rest of his days in South Florida.

===Music===

Fillmore wrote over 250 pieces and arranged orchestrations for hundreds more. He published under a variety of pseudonyms, including Gus Beans, Harold Bennett, Ray Hall, Harry Hartley, Al Hayes, and Henrietta Moore. Only the name Will Huff caused any issues, as another Will Huff composed marches and resided in Fillmore&#x27;s state. Fillmore used many pseudonyms throughout his career and was worried that flooding the market with music published under &quot;Henry Fillmore&quot; would dissuade others from purchasing his music. His pseudonyms are associate with grade, or difficulty level, or genre. In a 1953 interview with Jack H. Mahan, Fillmore explained his pseudonym uses: &quot;Harold Bennett&quot; was easy and non-progressive, if you can play one, you can play them all. &quot;Al Hayes&quot; was a little more difficult. &quot;Will Huff&quot; was a duplicate composer (Fillmore&#x27;s &quot;Will Huff&quot; was usually easy grade). &quot;Henry Fillmore&quot; could be the easiest marches or the most difficult. &quot;Harry Hartley&quot; are all solos; cornet, trombone, and baritone that are easy grade with no triple-tonguing or cadenzas. Solos under other names are just incidental. &quot;Henrietta Moore&quot; is all twilight songs.

A musical trade journal explained matters similarly in 1928: “The Harold Bennett Group includes selections for various instruments covering a specific range and not too difficult. The Al Hayes group is written for the same instruments, but with a more difficult arrangement; the Harry Hartley group is mostly teachers’ solos; and the Ray Hall group interesting miscellaneous compositions. Under his own name Mr. Fillmore has written many trombone solos and marches.”

While best known for march music and screamers, he also wrote waltzes, foxtrots, hymns, novelty numbers, and overtures. Fillmore&#x27;s best-known compositions include:

* &quot;The President&#x27;s March&quot; (1956)
* &quot;The Footlifter&quot; (1935)
* &quot;Americans We&quot; (1929)
* &quot;Men of Ohio&quot; (1921)
* &quot;The Man of the Hour&quot; (1924)
* &quot;His Honor&quot; (1934)
* &quot;The Klaxon&quot; (1930)
* &quot;Lassus Trombone&quot; (1915)
* &quot;(We&#x27;re) Men of Florida&quot;
* &quot;Military Escort March&quot; (1923)
* &quot;Mt. Healthy&quot; (1916)
* &quot;The Crosley March&quot;
* &quot;Noble Men&quot; (1922)
* &quot;Orange Bowl March&quot; (1939)
* &quot;Rolling Thunder March&quot; (1916)
* &quot;The Circus Bee&quot; (1908)
* &quot;King Karl King&quot; (1957)

Fillmore gained fame as the &quot;Father of the Trombone Smear&quot;, writing a series of 15 novelty tunes featuring trombone smears called &quot;The Trombone Family&quot;. A number of these have a strong ragtime influence. The tunes have subtitles printed on the parts, some of which contain racial slurs. Many were advertised specifically for the minstrel performers of the era. All of Fillmore&#x27;s trombone rags are as follows:
* &quot;Miss Trombone (A Slippery Rag)&quot; (1908)
* &quot;Teddy Trombone (A Brother to Miss Trombone)&quot; (1911)
* &quot;Lassus Trombone (De Cullud Valet to Miss Trombone)&quot; (1915)
* &quot;Pahson Trombone (Lassus Trombone&#x27;s &#x27;Ole Man&#x27;)&quot; (1916)
* &quot;Sally Trombone (Pahson Trombone&#x27;s Eldest Gal Some Crow)&quot; (1917)
* &quot;Slim Trombone (Sally Trombone&#x27;s Cousin - the Jazzin&#x27; One Step Kid)&quot; (1918)
* &quot;Mose Trombone (He&#x27;s Slim Trombone&#x27;s Buddy)&quot; (1919)
* &quot;Shoutin&#x27; Liza Trombone (Mose Trombone&#x27;s Ah-finity)&quot; (1920) (Also known as &quot;Hallelujah Trombone&quot; for the quote from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;)
* &quot;Hot Trombone (He&#x27;s Jes a Fren&#x27; ob Shoutin&#x27; Liza Trombone)&quot; (1921)
* &quot;Bones Trombone (He&#x27;s Jes as Warm as Hot Trombone)&quot; (1922)
* &quot;Dusty Trombone&quot; (1923)
* &quot;Bull Trombone (A Cullud Toreador)&quot; (1924)
* &quot;Lucky Trombone&quot; (1926)
* &quot;Boss Trombone&quot; (1929)
* &quot;Ham Trombone&quot; (1929)

Occasionally, as in &quot;The Footlifter&quot; credit, Fillmore wrote with the name Harold Bennett.

<doc id="76020" wikidata="Q2611800" url="?curid=76020" title="Porky in Wackyland">
<text>Porky in Wackyland is a 1938 Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; animated short film, directed by Bob Clampett. The short was released on September 24, 1938, and stars Porky Pig venturing out to find the last do-do bird, which he finds in Wackyland, a land that makes no sense located in Darkest Africa.

In 1994, &quot;Porky in Wackyland&quot; was voted No. 8 of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field. In 2000, it was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress, which selected the short for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==Plot==

A newspaper shows Porky Pig traveling to Africa to hunt for the last do-do bird. Upon landing his airplane in Darkest Africa, Porky sees a sign telling him that he is in Wackyland, where anything can happen. He tiptoes along the ground in his airplane and is greeted by a roaring beast, who suddenly becomes effeminate and dances away into the forest.

A musical interlude introduces several more bizarre creatures that inhabit Wackyland&#x27;s impossible landscape. These include a one-man band that plays its nose like a flute, a rabbit swinging in midair, a duck caricature of Al Jolson, and a beast with the heads of the Three Stooges. One creature wears a sandwich board advertising information about the do-do. The creature beckons Porky into a dark passage, where he falls down a chute and watches the do-do&#x27;s big entrance. The do-do introduces itself and then tramples Porky while scat singing. Porky gives chase, but the do-do repeatedly uses surreal tricks to escape and humiliate him.

Some time later, the do-do encounters a newspaper hawker announcing that Porky&#x27;s hunt has been a success. Confused by the news, the do-do drops its guard long enough for the hawker (Porky in disguise) to grab it. Porky briefly celebrates catching the last do-do, but is bested again when the bird calls for its other do-do friends.

==Reception==
Steve Schneider&#x27;s 1998 &quot;That&#x27;s All Folks! The Art of Warner Bros. Animation&quot; writes that with this short, &quot;the lord of cartoon misrule, Clampett established conclusively that in animation, realism is irrelevant&quot;.

In the 2001 &quot;Masters of Animation&quot;, John Grant writes that &quot;this short, in its cumulative effect, is more wildly inventive than anything even [Tex] Avery had produced for Warners&quot;.

Animation historian Steve Schneider writes, &quot;No mere Looney Tune, &quot;Porky in Wackyland&quot; was Warner Bros. Emancipation Proclamation. Building on the creaky liberties inaugurated by director Tex Avery, here Bob Clampett scoffs and shreds the conventions — realism, literalism, infantilism, cutesiness, and worse — that, with the ascendancy of Disney, had come to caramelize cartooning. By reminding us of animations&#x27; horizons — namely, none at all — this anything-goes film illustrates Sigmund Freud&#x27;s notion that humor arises from breaking taboos. And breaking taboos is something that animation, with its limitless freedom, is uniquely gifted to do&quot;.

==Follow-ups and derivative works==
Much of the Wackyland sequence was adapted and reused by Clampett for inclusion in his 1943 short &quot;Tin Pan Alley Cats&quot;. A color remake of &quot;Porky in Wackyland&quot; was supervised by Friz Freleng in 1948. Re-titled as &quot;Dough for the Do-Do&quot;, the remake was released in 1949. The films were nearly identical, in many cases appearing to match frame-by-frame in certain details, albeit with Porky&#x27;s appearance updated (by redoing most of the animation of the character), the voices having evolved (with less use of speeding-up) and the backgrounds being changed to a surreal, Daliesque landscape. &quot;Dough for the Do-Do&quot; was produced in Technicolor, but was originally released in Cinecolor due to a dispute with the Technicolor corporation. Later reissues were printed by Technicolor.

There were at least two Terrytoons plagiarizations of &quot;Porky in Wackyland&quot; in the 1940s or 1950s. &quot;Dingbat Land&quot; (1949) starred Gandy Goose and Sourpuss. The role of the Do-Do was taken by a minor Terrytoons character, Dingbat.

Tex Avery, for whom Clampett worked as an animator in the mid-1930s, borrowed strongly from this cartoon for his 1948 MGM cartoons &quot;Half-Pint Pygmy&quot; (in which the characters, George and Junior, travel to Africa in search of the world&#x27;s smallest pygmy, only to discover that he has an uncle who&#x27;s even smaller) and &quot;The Cat That Hated People&quot; (where the cat travels to the moon and encounters an array of characters similar to those in Clampett&#x27;s Wackyland, e.g., a pair of gloves and lips that keep saying &quot;Mammy, mammy&quot;, just like the Al Jolson duck in &quot;Porky in Wackyland&quot;). Clampett would again use the Three Stooges parody when a later creation of his, Beany and Cecil, faced the &quot;Dreaded Three-Headed Threep&quot;.

According to writer Paul Dini, the Do-Do Bird is the father of Gogo Dodo, a character on the 1990s animated TV series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, and a second Wackyland is drawn into Acme Acres by Babs and Buster Bunny. A small clip from the film was used in a Slappy Squirrel segment on another Warners animated TV series of the 1990s, &quot;Animaniacs&quot;. The segment, titled &quot;Critical Condition&quot;, featured &quot;Porky in Wackyland&quot; as part of a fake LaserDisc release. The Do-Do Bird has made occasional guest spots in the DC Comics &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; comic book, being colored in grayscale as opposed to the rest of the art being in color. The character makes an appearance in the Wii game &quot;Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal&quot; as an unplayable character. He is given a first name, Yoyo Dodo. Yoyo can also be seen at Maroon Cartoon Studios as a brief cameo in the beginning of the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. Yoyo also made a cameo in the 2020 &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot; short &quot;Happy Birthday, Bugs Bunny!&quot; and plays a large role in the stop motion episode &quot;Daffy in Wackyland&quot;.
