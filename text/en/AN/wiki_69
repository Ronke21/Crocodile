<text>In Greek mythology, Glauce (; Ancient Greek: Γλαύκη &quot;Glaukê&quot; means &#x27;blue-gray&#x27; or &#x27;gleaming&#x27;), Latin Glauca, refers to different people:

*Glauce, an Arcadian nymph, one of the nurses of Zeus. She and the other nurses were represented on the altar of Athena Alea at Tegea.
*Glauce, twin sister of Pluto who died as an infant according to Euhemerus.
*Glauce, one of the Melian nymphs.
*Glauce, one of the 50 Nereids, marine-nymph daughters of the &#x27;Old Man of the Sea&#x27; Nereus and the Oceanid Doris. She personifies the color of the sea which can be attributed to her name that signifies &quot;sea-green&quot; or &quot;bright green&quot;. Glauce and her other sisters appear to Thetis when she cries out in sympathy for the grief of Achilles at the slaying of his friend Patroclus.
*Glauce, mother, by Upis, of &quot;the third&quot; Artemis in Cicero&#x27;s rationalized genealogy of the Greek gods.
*Glauce, a Libyan princess as one of the Danaïdes, daughters of King Danaus. Her mother was either Atlanteia or Phoebe, both were hamadryads. Glauce married and murdered her cousin Alces, son of King Aegyptus of Egypt by an Arabian woman.
*Glauce, a Corinthian princess as the daughter of King Creon. Also known by the name Creusa, predominantly in Latin authors, e.g. Seneca and Propertius. Hyginus uses both names interchangeably. In Cherubini&#x27;s opera Medea she is known as Dircé. She married Jason. Creusa was killed, along with her father, by Medea, who either sent her a peplos steeped in flammable poison or set fire to the royal palace. In the local Corinthian tradition, Glauce threw herself into a well in a vain attempt to wash off Medea&#x27;s poison; from this circumstance the well became known as the Well of Glauce. 
*Glauce, an Amazon. Some say that it was she, and not Antiope, who was abducted by Theseus and became his wife.
*Glauce, a Salaminian princess as the daughter of King Cychreus, son of Poseidon and Salamis. Some sources say that Glauce married Actaeus and bore him a son Telamon. Others say that Telamon was her husband and that, after her death, he married Periboea, mother of Ajax.
*Glauce, a princess of Colonae as daughter of King Cycnus, sister of Cobis and Corianus. During the Trojan campaign, she was taken captive by the Greeks and was given to Ajax, by whom she became mother of Aeantides.

<doc id="81625" wikidata="Q116907" url="?curid=81625" title="Glutathione">
<text>Glutathione (GSH, ) is an organic compound with the chemical formula . It is an antioxidant in plants, animals, fungi, and some bacteria and archaea. Glutathione is capable of preventing damage to important cellular components caused by sources such as reactive oxygen species, free radicals, peroxides, lipid peroxides, and heavy metals. It is a tripeptide with a gamma peptide linkage between the carboxyl group of the glutamate side chain and cysteine. The carboxyl group of the cysteine residue is attached by normal peptide linkage to glycine.

==Biosynthesis and occurrence==
Glutathione biosynthesis involves two adenosine triphosphate-dependent steps:
*First, γ-glutamylcysteine is synthesized from -glutamate and -cysteine. This conversion requires the enzyme glutamate–cysteine ligase (GCL, glutamate cysteine synthase). This reaction is the rate-limiting step in glutathione synthesis.
*Second, glycine is added to the C-terminal of γ-glutamylcysteine. This condensation is catalyzed by glutathione synthetase.

While all animal cells are capable of synthesizing glutathione, glutathione synthesis in the liver has been shown to be essential. GCLC knockout mice die within a month of birth due to the absence of hepatic GSH synthesis.

The unusual gamma amide linkage in glutathione protects it from hydrolysis by peptidases.

===Occurrence===
Glutathione is the most abundant non-protein thiol (-containing compound) in animal cells, ranging from 0.5 to 10 mmol/L. It is present in the cytosol and the organelles. The concentration of glutathione in the cytoplasm is significantly higher (ranging from 0.5-10 mM) compared to extracellular fluids (2-20 μM), reaching levels up to 1000 times greater. In healthy cells and tissue, more than 90% of the total glutathione pool is in the reduced form (GSH), with the remainder in the disulfide form (GSSG). The cytosol holds 80-85% of cellular GSH and the mitochondria hold 10-15%.

Human beings synthesize glutathione, but a few eukaryotes do not, including some members of Fabaceae, &quot;Entamoeba&quot;, and &quot;Giardia&quot;. The only known archaea that make glutathione are halobacteria. Some bacteria, such as &quot;Cyanobacteria&quot; and Pseudomonadota, can biosynthesize glutathione.

Systemic availability of orally consumed glutathione is poor. It had low bioavailability because the tripeptide is the substrate of proteases (peptidases) of the alimentary canal, and due to the absence of a specific &quot;carrier&quot; of glutathione at the level of cell membrane. The administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a cysteine prodrug, helps replenish intracellular GSH levels.

==Biochemical function==
Glutathione exists in reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) states. The ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione within cells is a measure of cellular oxidative stress where increased GSSG-to-GSH ratio is indicative of greater oxidative stress.

In the reduced state, the thiol group of cysteinyl residue is a source of one reducing equivalent. Glutathione disulfide (GSSG) is thereby generated. The oxidized state is converted to the reduced state by NADPH. This conversion is catalyzed by glutathione reductase:
:NADPH + GSSG + H2O → 2 GSH + NADP+ + OH−

==Roles==

===Antioxidant===
GSH protects cells by neutralising (reducing) reactive oxygen species. This conversion is illustrated by the reduction of peroxides:
:2 GSH + R2O2 → GSSG + 2 ROH (R = H, alkyl)
and with free radicals:
:GSH + R• → GSSG + RH

===Regulation===
Aside from deactivating radicals and reactive oxidants, glutathione participates in thiol protection and redox regulation of cellular thiol proteins under oxidative stress by protein &quot;S&quot;-glutathionylation, a redox-regulated post-translational thiol modification. The general reaction involves formation of an unsymmetrical disulfide from the protectable protein (RSH) and GSH:
:RSH + GSH + [O] → GSSR + H2O

Glutathione is also employed for the detoxification of methylglyoxal and formaldehyde, toxic metabolites produced under oxidative stress. This detoxification reaction is carried out by the glyoxalase system. Glyoxalase I (EC 4.4.1.5) catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal and reduced glutathione to &quot;S&quot;--lactoylglutathione. Glyoxalase II (EC 3.1.2.6) catalyzes the hydrolysis of &quot;S&quot;--lactoylglutathione to glutathione and -lactic acid.

It maintains exogenous antioxidants such as vitamins C and E in their reduced (active) states.

===Metabolism===
Among the many metabolic processes in which it participates, glutathione is required for the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and prostaglandins. It plays a role in the storage of cysteine. Glutathione enhances the function of citrulline as part of the nitric oxide cycle. It is a cofactor and acts on glutathione peroxidase. Glutathione is used to produce S-sulfanylglutathione, which is part of hydrogen sulfide metabolism.

===Conjugation===
Glutathione facilitates metabolism of xenobiotics. Glutathione &quot;S&quot;-transferase enzymes catalyze its conjugation to lipophilic xenobiotics, facilitating their excretion or further metabolism. The conjugation process is illustrated by the metabolism of &quot;N&quot;-acetyl-&quot;p&quot;-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is a reactive metabolite formed by the action of cytochrome P450 on paracetamol (acetaminophen). Glutathione conjugates to NAPQI, and the resulting ensemble is excreted.

===In plants===
In plants, glutathione is involved in stress management. It is a component of the glutathione-ascorbate cycle, a system that reduces poisonous hydrogen peroxide. It is the precursor of phytochelatins, glutathione oligomers that chelate heavy metals such as cadmium. Glutathione is required for efficient defence against plant pathogens such as &quot;Pseudomonas syringae&quot; and &quot;Phytophthora brassicae&quot;. Adenylyl-sulfate reductase, an enzyme of the sulfur assimilation pathway, uses glutathione as an electron donor. Other enzymes using glutathione as a substrate are glutaredoxins. These small oxidoreductases are involved in flower development, salicylic acid, and plant defence signalling.

==In degradation of drug delivery systems==
Among various types of cancer, lung cancer, larynx cancer, mouth cancer, and breast cancer exhibit higher concentrations (10-40 mM) of GSH compared to healthy cells. Thus, drug delivery systems containing disulfide bonds, typically cross-linked micro-nanogels, stand out for their ability to degrade in the presence of high concentrations of glutathione (GSH). This degradation process releases the drug payload specifically into cancerous or tumorous tissue, leveraging the significant difference in redox potential between the oxidizing extracellular environment and the reducing intracellular cytosol.

When internalized by endocytosis, nanogels encounter high concentrations of GSH inside the cancer cell. GSH, a potent reducing agent, donates electrons to disulfide bonds in the nanogels, initiating a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. This reaction breaks the disulfide bonds, converting them into two thiol groups, and facilitates targeted drug release where it is needed most. This reaction is called a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction.
:::::::::::&quot;R−S−S−R′&quot;+ 2&quot;GSH&quot; → &quot;R−SH + R′−SH&quot; + &quot;GSSG&quot;
where &quot;R&quot; and &quot;R&quot;&#x27; are parts of the micro-nanogel structure, and &quot;GSSG&quot; is oxidized glutathione (glutathione disulfide).

The breaking of disulfide bonds causes the nanogel to degrade into smaller fragments. This degradation process leads to the release of encapsulated drugs. The released drug molecules can then exert their therapeutic effects, such as inducing apoptosis in cancer cells.

== Uses ==
===Winemaking===
The content of glutathione in must, the first raw form of wine, determines the browning, or caramelizing effect, during the production of white wine by trapping the caffeoyltartaric acid quinones generated by enzymic oxidation as grape reaction product. Its concentration in wine can be determined by UPLC-MRM mass spectrometry.

<doc id="81628" wikidata="Q220410" url="?curid=81628" title="Thiol">
<text>In organic chemistry, a thiol (; ), or thiol derivative, is any organosulfur compound of the form , where R represents an alkyl or other organic substituent. The functional group itself is referred to as either a thiol group or a sulfhydryl group, or a sulfanyl group. Thiols are the sulfur analogue of alcohols (that is, sulfur takes the place of oxygen in the hydroxyl () group of an alcohol), and the word is a blend of &quot;thio-&quot; with &quot;alcohol&quot;.

Many thiols have strong odors resembling that of garlic, cabbage or rotten eggs. Thiols are used as odorants to assist in the detection of natural gas (which in pure form is odorless), and the &quot;smell of natural gas&quot; is due to the smell of the thiol used as the odorant. Thiols are sometimes referred to as mercaptans () or mercapto compounds, a term introduced in 1832 by William Christopher Zeise and is derived from the Latin (&#x27;capturing mercury&#x27;) because the thiolate group () bonds very strongly with mercury compounds.

== Structure and bonding ==
Thiols having the structure R−SH, in which an alkyl group (R) is attached to a sulfhydryl group (SH), are referred to as &quot;alkanethiols&quot; or &quot;alkyl thiols&quot;. Thiols and alcohols have similar connectivity. Because sulfur atoms are larger than oxygen atoms, C−S bond lengths—typically around 180 picometres—are about 40 picometers longer than typical C−O bonds. The C−S−H angles approach 90° whereas the angle for the C−O−H group is more obtuse. In solids and liquids, the hydrogen-bonding between individual thiol groups is weak, the main cohesive force being Van der Waals interactions between the highly polarizable divalent sulfur centers.

The S−H bond is much weaker than the O−H bond as reflected in their respective bond dissociation energies (BDE). For CH3S−H, the BDE is , while for CH3O−H, the BDE is .

An S−H bond is moderately polar because of the small difference in the electronegativity of sulfur and hydrogen. In contrast, O−H bonds in hydroxyl groups are more polar. Thiols have a lower dipole moment relative to their corresponding alcohols.

==Nomenclature==
There are several ways to name the alkylthiols:
* The suffix &quot;-thiol&quot; is added to the name of the alkane. This method is nearly identical to naming an alcohol and is used by the IUPAC, e.g. CH3SH would be &quot;methanethiol&quot;.
* The word &quot;mercaptan&quot; replaces &quot;alcohol&quot; in the name of the equivalent alcohol compound. Example: CH3SH would be methyl mercaptan, just as CH3OH is called methyl alcohol.
* The term &quot;sulfhydryl-&quot; or &quot;mercapto-&quot; is used as a prefix, e.g. mercaptopurine.

==Physical properties==
===Odor===
Many thiols have strong odors resembling that of garlic. The odors of thiols, particularly those of low molecular weight, are often strong and repulsive. The spray of skunks consists mainly of low-molecular-weight thiols and derivatives. These compounds are detectable by the human nose at concentrations of only 10 parts per billion. Human sweat contains (&quot;R&quot;)/(&quot;S&quot;)-3-methyl-3-mercapto-1-ol (MSH), detectable at 2 parts per billion and having a fruity, onion-like odor. (Methylthio)methanethiol (MeSCH2SH; MTMT) is a strong-smelling volatile thiol, also detectable at parts per billion levels, found in male mouse urine. Lawrence C. Katz and co-workers showed that MTMT functioned as a semiochemical, activating certain mouse olfactory sensory neurons, and attracting female mice. Copper has been shown to be required by a specific mouse olfactory receptor, MOR244-3, which is highly responsive to MTMT as well as to various other thiols and related compounds. A human olfactory receptor, OR2T11, has been identified which, in the presence of copper, is highly responsive to the gas odorants (see below) ethanethiol and &quot;t&quot;-butyl mercaptan as well as other low molecular weight thiols, including allyl mercaptan found in human garlic breath, and the strong-smelling cyclic sulfide thietane.

Thiols are also responsible for a class of wine faults caused by an unintended reaction between sulfur and yeast and the &quot;skunky&quot; odor of beer that has been exposed to ultraviolet light.

Not all thiols have unpleasant odors. For example, furan-2-ylmethanethiol contributes to the aroma of roasted coffee, whereas grapefruit mercaptan, a monoterpenoid thiol, is responsible for the characteristic scent of grapefruit. The effect of the latter compound is present only at low concentrations. The pure mercaptan has an unpleasant odor.

In the United States, natural gas distributors were required to add thiols, originally ethanethiol, to natural gas (which is naturally odorless) after the deadly New London School explosion in New London, Texas, in 1937. Many gas distributors were odorizing gas prior to this event. Most currently-used gas odorants contain mixtures of mercaptans and sulfides, with &quot;t&quot;-butyl mercaptan as the main odor constituent in natural gas and ethanethiol in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG, propane). In situations where thiols are used in commercial industry, such as liquid petroleum gas tankers and bulk handling systems, an oxidizing catalyst is used to destroy the odor. A copper-based oxidation catalyst neutralizes the volatile thiols and transforms them into inert products.

===Boiling points and solubility===
Thiols show little association by hydrogen bonding, both with water molecules and among themselves. Hence, they have lower boiling points and are less soluble in water and other polar solvents than alcohols of similar molecular weight. For this reason also, thiols and their corresponding sulfide functional group isomers have similar solubility characteristics and boiling points, whereas the same is not true of alcohols and their corresponding isomeric ethers.

===Bonding===
The S−H bond in thiols is weak compared to the O−H bond in alcohols. For CH3X−H, the bond enthalpies are for X = S and for X = O. Hydrogen-atom abstraction from a thiol gives a thiyl radical with the formula RS•, where R = alkyl or aryl.

==Characterization==
Volatile thiols are easily and almost unerringly detected by their distinctive odor. Sulfur-specific analyzers for gas chromatographs are useful. Spectroscopic indicators are the D2O-exchangeable SH signal in the 1H NMR spectrum (33S is NMR-active but signals for divalent sulfur are very broad and of little utility). The &quot;ν&quot;SH band appears near 2400 cm−1 in the IR spectrum. In the nitroprusside reaction, free thiol groups react with sodium nitroprusside and ammonium hydroxide to give a red colour.

==Preparation==
In industry, methanethiol is prepared by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with methanol. This method is employed for the industrial synthesis of methanethiol:
:CH3OH + H2S → CH3SH + H2O
Such reactions are conducted in the presence of acidic catalysts. The other principal route to thiols involves the addition of hydrogen sulfide to alkenes. Such reactions are usually conducted in the presence of an acid catalyst or UV light. Halide displacement, using the suitable organic halide and sodium hydrogen sulfide has also been used.

Another method entails the alkylation of sodium hydrosulfide.
: RX + NaSH → RSH + NaX(X = Cl, Br, I)
This method is used for the production of thioglycolic acid from chloroacetic acid.

===Laboratory methods===
In general, on the typical laboratory scale, the direct reaction of a haloalkane with sodium hydrosulfide is &quot;in&quot;efficient owing to the competing formation of sulfides. Instead, alkyl halides are converted to thiols via an &quot;S&quot;-alkylation of thiourea. This multistep, one-pot process proceeds via the intermediacy of the isothiouronium salt, which is hydrolyzed in a separate step:

: CH3CH2Br + SC(NH2)2 → [CH3CH2SC(NH2)2]Br
: [CH3CH2SC(NH2)2]Br + NaOH → CH3CH2SH + OC(NH2)2 + NaBr

The thiourea route works well with primary halides, especially activated ones. Secondary and tertiary thiols are less easily prepared. Secondary thiols can be prepared from the ketone via the corresponding dithioketals. A related two-step process involves alkylation of thiosulfate to give the thiosulfonate (&quot;Bunte salt&quot;), followed by hydrolysis. The method is illustrated by one synthesis of thioglycolic acid:
:ClCH2CO2H + Na2S2O3 → Na[O3S2CH2CO2H] + NaCl

:Na[O3S2CH2CO2H] + H2O → HSCH2CO2H + NaHSO4

Organolithium compounds and Grignard reagents react with sulfur to give the thiolates, which are readily hydrolyzed:
:RLi + S → RSLi
:RSLi + HCl → RSH + LiCl

Phenols can be converted to the thiophenols via rearrangement of their &quot;O&quot;-aryl dialkylthiocarbamates.

Thiols are prepared by reductive dealkylation of sulfides, especially benzyl derivatives and thioacetals.

Thiophenols are produced by &quot;S&quot;-arylation or the replacement of diazonium leaving group with sulfhydryl anion (SH−):
: + SH− → ArSH + N2

==Reactions==
Akin to the chemistry of alcohols, thiols form sulfides, thioacetals, and thioesters, which are analogous to ethers, acetals, and esters respectively. Thiols and alcohols are also very different in their reactivity, thiols being more easily oxidized than alcohols. Thiolates are more potent nucleophiles than the corresponding alkoxides.

===&quot;S&quot;-Alkylation===
Thiols, or more specific their conjugate bases, are readily alkylated to give sulfides:
:RSH + R′Br + B → RSR′ + [HB]Br (B = base)

===Acidity===
Thiols are easily deprotonated. Relative to the alcohols, thiols are more acidic. The conjugate base of a thiol is called a thiolate. Butanethiol has a p&quot;K&quot;a of 10.5 vs 15 for butanol. Thiophenol has a p&quot;K&quot;a of 6, versus 10 for phenol. A highly acidic thiol is pentafluorothiophenol (C6F5SH) with a p&quot;K&quot;a of 2.68. Thus, thiolates can be obtained from thiols by treatment with alkali metal hydroxides. 
===Redox===
Thiols, especially in the presence of base, are readily oxidized by reagents such as bromine and iodine to give an organic disulfide (R−S−S−R).
: 2 R−SH + Br2 → R−S−S−R + 2 HBr
Oxidation by more powerful reagents such as sodium hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide can also yield sulfonic acids (RSO3H).
: R−SH + 3 H2O2 → RSO3H + 3 H2O
Oxidation can also be effected by oxygen in the presence of catalysts:
: 2 R–SH +  O2 → RS−SR + H2O

Thiols participate in thiol-disulfide exchange:
:RS−SR + 2 R′SH → 2 RSH + R′S−SR′
This reaction is important in nature.

===Metal ion complexation===
With metal ions, thiolates behave as ligands to form transition metal thiolate complexes. The term &quot;mercaptan&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;mercurium captans&quot; (capturing mercury) because the thiolate group bonds so strongly with mercury compounds. According to hard/soft acid/base (HSAB) theory, sulfur is a relatively soft (polarizable) atom. This explains the tendency of thiols to bind to soft elements and ions such as mercury, lead, or cadmium. The stability of metal thiolates parallels that of the corresponding sulfide minerals.

===Thioxanthates===
Thiolates react with carbon disulfide to give thioxanthate ().

== Thiyl radicals ==
Free radicals derived from mercaptans, called thiyl radicals, are commonly invoked to explain reactions in organic chemistry and biochemistry. They have the formula RS• where R is an organic substituent such as alkyl or aryl. They arise from or can be generated by a number of routes, but the principal method is H-atom abstraction from thiols. Another method involves homolysis of organic disulfides. In biology thiyl radicals are responsible for the formation of the deoxyribonucleic acids, building blocks for DNA. This conversion is catalysed by ribonucleotide reductase (see figure). Thiyl intermediates also are produced by the oxidation of glutathione, an antioxidant in biology. Thiyl radicals (sulfur-centred) can transform to carbon-centred radicals via hydrogen atom exchange equilibria. The formation of carbon-centred radicals could lead to protein damage via the formation of C−C bonds or backbone fragmentation.

Because of the weakness of the S−H bond, thiols can function as scavengers of free radicals.

==Biological importance==
=== Cysteine and cystine ===
As the functional group of the amino acid cysteine, the thiol group plays a very important role in biology. When the thiol groups of two cysteine residues (as in monomers or constituent units) are brought near each other in the course of protein folding, an oxidation reaction can generate a cystine unit with a disulfide bond (−S−S−). Disulfide bonds can contribute to a protein&#x27;s tertiary structure if the cysteines are part of the same peptide chain, or contribute to the quaternary structure of multi-unit proteins by forming fairly strong covalent bonds between different peptide chains. A physical manifestation of cysteine-cystine equilibrium is provided by hair straightening technologies.

Sulfhydryl groups in the active site of an enzyme can form noncovalent bonds with the enzyme&#x27;s substrate as well, contributing to covalent catalytic activity in catalytic triads. Active site cysteine residues are the functional unit in cysteine protease catalytic triads. Cysteine residues may also react with heavy metal ions (Zn2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, Ag+) because of the high affinity between the soft sulfide and the soft metal (see hard and soft acids and bases). This can deform and inactivate the protein, and is one mechanism of heavy metal poisoning.

Drugs containing thiol group
6-Mercaptopurine (anticancer)
Captopril (antihypertensive)
D-penicillamine (antiarthritic)
Sodium aurothiolate (antiarthritic)

===Cofactors===
Many cofactors (non-protein-based helper molecules) feature thiols. The biosynthesis and degradation of fatty acids and related long-chain hydrocarbons is conducted on a scaffold that anchors the growing chain through a thioester derived from the thiol Coenzyme A. The biosynthesis of methane, the principal hydrocarbon on Earth, arises from the reaction mediated by coenzyme M, 2-mercaptoethyl sulfonic acid. Thiolates, the conjugate bases derived from thiols, form strong complexes with many metal ions, especially those classified as soft. The stability of metal thiolates parallels that of the corresponding sulfide minerals.

===In skunks===
The defensive spray of skunks consists mainly of low-molecular-weight thiols and derivatives with a foul odor, which protects the skunk from predators. Owls are able to prey on skunks, as they lack a sense of smell.

<doc id="81632" wikidata="Q481808" url="?curid=81632" title="Acetyl group">
<text>In organic chemistry, an acetyl group is a functional group denoted by the chemical formula and the structure . It is sometimes represented by the symbol Ac (not to be confused with the element actinium). In IUPAC nomenclature, an acetyl group is called an ethanoyl group.

An acetyl group contains a methyl group () that is single-bonded to a carbonyl (), making it an acyl group. The carbonyl center of an acyl radical has one non-bonded electron with which it forms a chemical bond to the remainder (denoted with the letter &quot;R&quot;) of the molecule.

The acetyl moiety is a component of many organic compounds, including acetic acid, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, acetyl-CoA, acetylcysteine, acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol), and acetylsalicylic acid (also known as aspirin).

==Acetylation==
The process of adding an acetyl group into a molecule is called acetylation. An example of an acetylation reaction is the conversion of glycine to &quot;N&quot;-acetylglycine:

=== In biology ===
Enzymes which perform acetylation on proteins or other biomolecules are known as acetyltransferases. In biological organisms, acetyl groups are commonly transferred from acetyl-CoA to other organic molecules. Acetyl-CoA is an intermediate in the biological synthesis and in the breakdown of many organic molecules. Acetyl-CoA is also created during the second stage of cellular respiration (pyruvate decarboxylation) by the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase on pyruvic acid.

Proteins are often modified via acetylation, for various purposes. For example, acetylation of histones by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) results in an expansion of local chromatin structure, allowing transcription to occur by enabling RNA polymerase to access DNA. However, removal of the acetyl group by histone deacetylases (HDACs) condenses the local chromatin structure, thereby preventing transcription.

===In synthetic organic and pharmaceutical chemistry===
Acetylation can be achieved by chemists using a variety of methods, most commonly with the use of acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride, often in the presence of a tertiary or aromatic amine base.

==Pharmacology==
Acetylated organic molecules exhibit increased ability to cross the selectively permeable blood–brain barrier. Acetylation helps a given drug reach the brain more quickly, making the drug&#x27;s effects more intense and increasing the effectiveness of a given dose. The acetyl group in acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) enhances its effectiveness relative to the natural anti-inflammatant salicylic acid. In similar manner, acetylation converts the natural painkiller morphine into the far more potent heroin (diacetylmorphine).

There is some evidence that acetyl--carnitine may be more effective for some applications than -carnitine. Acetylation of resveratrol holds promise as one of the first anti-radiation medicines for human populations.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;acetyl&quot; was coined by the German chemist Justus von Liebig in 1839 to describe what he incorrectly believed to be the radical of acetic acid (the main component of vinegar, aside from water), which is now known as the vinyl group (coined in 1851); &quot;acetyl&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;acētum,&quot; meaning &quot;vinegar.&quot; When it was shown that Liebig&#x27;s theory was wrong and acetic acid had a different radical, his name was carried over to the correct one, but the name of acetylene (coined in 1860) was retained.

<text>A view camera is a large-format camera in which the lens forms an inverted image on a ground-glass screen directly at the film plane. The image is viewed, composed, and focused, then the glass screen is replaced with the film to expose exactly the same image seen on the screen.

This type of camera was developed during the era of the daguerreotype (1840s–1850s) and is still in use, some using drive mechanisms for movement (rather than loosen-move-tighten), more scale markings, and/or more spirit levels. It comprises a flexible bellows that forms a light-tight seal between two adjustable &quot;standards&quot;, one of which holds a lens, and the other a ground glass or a photographic film holder or a digital back. There are three general types: the rail camera, the field camera, and those that don&#x27;t fit into the other categories.

The bellows is a flexible, accordion-pleated box. It encloses the space between the lens and film, and flexes to accommodate the movements of the standards. The &quot;front standard&quot; is a frame that holds the lensboard, to which the lens (perhaps with shutter) is attached.

At the other end of the bellows, the &quot;rear standard&quot; is a frame that holds a ground glass plate, used for focusing and composing the image before exposure—and is replaced by a holder containing the light-sensitive film, plate, or image sensor for exposure. The front and rear standards can move relative to each other, unlike most other camera types. Whereas most cameras control only the distance of the plane of focus from the camera, the view camera can also adjust the orientation of the plane of focus, and perspective control. The camera is normally used on a tripod support.

==Types ==
Several types of view cameras are used for different purposes, and provide different degrees of movement and portability. They include:

* Rail camera – There are the smaller more maneuverable &quot;monorail camera&quot; and the large stable immovable multi-rail camera known as the &quot;process camera&quot;.
**The &quot;monorail camera&quot; is the most common type of studio view camera, with front and rear standards mounted to a single rail that is fixed to a camera support. This design gives the greatest range of movements and flexibility, with both front and rear standards able to tilt, shift, rise, fall, and swing in similar proportion. These are generally made of metal with leather or synthetic bellows, and are difficult to pack for travel. Sinar and Toyo are popular manufacturers of monorail view camera systems. ARCA-Swiss produces monorail cameras for field use in addition to models for the more conventional studio applications. Many manufacturers also offer monorail extensions that move the front or rear standards farther away from each other to facilitate focusing on close objects (macrophotography).
**The stationary &quot;process camera&quot; is used for copying nearly flat artwork that is held to a copyboard located at the far end of the camera rails of horizontally mounted cameras, or at the base of vertical cameras. The work to be copied and the film are often held in place by vacuum and copying is usually at 1:1 magnification. They use various sizes of film depending upon what is needed for the specific job.
* Field camera – These have the front and rear standard mounted on sliding rails fixed to a hinged flat bed that can be attached to a camera support, such as a tripod. These cameras are usually made of wood, or sometimes lightweight and strong composites such as carbon fiber. With the bellows fully retracted, the flat bed folds up, reducing the camera to a relatively small, light, and portable box. The trade off for this portability is that the standards are not as mobile or as adjustable as on a monorail design. The rear standard in particular may be fixed and offer no movement. These large format but transportable cameras are popular with landscape photographers. Tachihara and Wisner are examples of modern field cameras at opposite ends of the price scale.
** Extremely large field cameras use 11×14 film and larger, or panoramic film sizes such as 4×10 or 8×20. These are sometimes called &quot;banquet cameras&quot;, and once were commonly used to photograph large, posed groups of people to mark occasions, such as banquets or weddings.
** &quot;Studio and salon cameras&quot; are similar to field cameras, but do not fold up for portability.
** &quot;Folding plate cameras&quot; with limited movements were often used. An example is the Goerz Taro-Tenax 9x12cm.
** Press cameras that have a ground glass integral to the film-holder mechanism allow critical focus and use of available movements. More expensive examples had a wide array of movements, as well as focusing and composing aids like rangefinders and viewfinders. They are most often made of metal, designed to fold up quickly for portability, used by press photographers before and during the second world war. Some press cameras have more adjustment capabilities, including some ability to tilt the rear standard, and can be either hand-held or attached to a tripod for support.
*Other view cameras – Many unique view cameras have been built and used for special purposes or for general purpose.

View cameras use large format sheet film—one sheet per photograph. Standard sizes in inches are: 4×5, 5×7, 4×10, 5×12, 8×10, 11×14, 7×17, 8×20, 12×20, 20×24, and larger for &quot;process cameras&quot;. (It is usual to list the short side first in the Americas, and the long side in many other countries, thus 4×5 is the same as 5×4). A similar, but not identical, range of metric sizes is used in many countries; thus 9×12 cm is similar to, but not interchangeable with, 4×5 inches and 13×18 cm is similar to, but not interchangeable with, 5×7 inches. The most widely used format is 4×5, followed by 8×10.

A few rollfilm cameras have movements that make them as versatile as a sheet film view camera. Rollfilm and instant film backs are available to use in place of a sheetfilm holder on a single-film camera.

==Movements==
Photographers use view cameras to control focus and convergence of parallel lines. Image control is done by moving the front and/or rear standards. Movements are the ways the front and rear standards can move to alter perspective and focus. The term can also refer to the mechanisms on the standards that control their position.

Not all cameras have all movements available to both front and rear standards, and some cameras have more movements available than others. Some cameras have mechanisms that facilitate intricate movement combinations.

Some limited view camera–type movements are possible with SLR cameras using various tilt/shift lenses. Also, as use of view cameras declines in favor of digital photography, these movements are simulated using computer software.
===Rise and fall===

Rise and fall are the movements of either the front or rear standard vertically along a line in a plane parallel to the film (or sensor) plane. Rise is a very important movement especially in architectural photography. Generally, the lens is moved vertically—either up or down—along the lens plane to change the portion of the image captured on the film. In the 35 mm format, special shift lenses (sometimes called perspective control lenses) emulate the rise or fall of view cameras.

The main effect of rise is to eliminate converging parallels when photographing tall buildings. If a camera without movements is pointed at a tall building, the top is off. If the camera is tilted upwards to get it all in, the film plane is not parallel to the building, and the building seems narrower at the top than the bottom: lines that are parallel in the object converge in the image.

To avoid this apparent distortion, a wide-angle lens gets more of the building in, but includes more of the foreground and alters the perspective. A camera with rising front lets a normal lens be raised to include the top of the building without tilting the camera.

This requires that the image circle of the lens be larger than is required to cover the film without use of movements. If the lens can produce a circular image just large enough to cover the film, it can&#x27;t cover the bottom of the film as it rises. Consequently, lens coverage must be larger to accommodate rise (and fall, tilt and shift).

In Figure a) below (images are upside down, as a photographer would see them on the ground glass of a view camera), the lens has been shifted down (fall). Notice that much of the unwanted foreground is included, but not the top of the tower. In Figure b), the lens has been shifted up (rise): the top of the tower is now inside the area captured on film, at the sacrifice of unwanted green foreground.


===Shift===

Moving the front standard left or right from its normal position is called &quot;lens shift,&quot; or simply &quot;shift.&quot; This movement is similar to rise and fall, but moves the image horizontally rather than vertically. One use for shift is to remove the image of the camera from the final image when photographing a reflective surface.
===Tilt===

The axis of the lens is normally perpendicular to the film (or sensor). Changing the angle between axis and film by tilting the lens standard backwards or forwards is called &quot;lens tilt,&quot; or just &quot;tilt.&quot; Tilt is especially useful in landscape photography. By using the Scheimpflug principle, the “plane of sharp focus” can be changed so that any plane can be brought into sharp focus. When the film plane and lens plane are parallel as is the case for most 35 mm cameras, the plane of sharp focus is also parallel to these two planes. If, however, the lens plane is tilted with respect to the film plane, the plane of sharp focus is also tilted according to geometrical and optical properties. The three planes intersect in a line below the camera for downward lens tilt. The tilted plane of sharp focus is useful, in that this plane can be made to coincide with a near and far object. Thus, both near and far objects on the plane are in focus.

This effect is often incorrectly thought of as increasing the depth of field. Depth of field depends on the focal length, aperture, and subject distance. As long as the photographer wants sharpness in a plane that is parallel to the film, tilt is of no use. However, tilt has a strong effect on the depth of field by drastically altering its shape, making it asymmetrical. Without tilt, the limits of near and far acceptable focus are parallel to the plane of sharp focus as well as parallel to the film. With forward tilt, the plane of sharp focus tilts even more and the near and far limits of acceptable focus form a wedge shape (viewed from the side). Thus, the lens still sees a cone shaped portion of whatever is in front of it while the wedge of acceptable focus is now more closely aligned with this cone. Therefore, depending on the shape of the subject, a wider aperture can be used, lessening concerns about camera stability due to slow shutter speed and diffraction due to too-small aperture.

Tilting achieves the desired depth of field using the aperture at which the lens performs best. Too small an aperture risks losses to diffraction and camera/subject motion what is gained from depth of field. Only testing a given scene, or experience, shows whether tilting is better than leaving the standards neutral and relying on the aperture alone to achieve the desired depth of field. If the scene is sharp enough at f/32 with 2 degrees of tilt but would need f/64 with zero tilt, then tilt is the solution. If another scene would need f/45 with or without tilt, then nothing is gained. See Merklinger
and Luong
for extensive discussions on determining the optimal tilt (if any) in challenging situations.

With a forward tilt, the shape of the portion of a scene in acceptable focus is a wedge. Thus, the scene most likely to benefit from tilting is short in the front and expands to a greater height or thickness toward the horizon. A scene consisting of tall trees in the near, middle and far distance may not lend itself to tilting unless the photographer is willing to sacrifice either the top of the near trees and/or the bottom of the far trees.

Assuming lens axis front tilt, here are the trade offs in choosing between a small degree of tilt (say less than 3) and a larger tilt: A small tilt causes a wider or fatter wedge but one that is far off axis from the cone of light seen by the lens. Conversely, a large tilt (say 10 degrees) makes the wedge more aligned with the lens view, but with a narrower wedge. Thus, a modest tilt is often, or even usually, the best starting point.
Small and medium format cameras have fixed bodies that do not allow for misalignment of the film and lens planes, intentionally or not. Tilt/shift (“TS”) or perspective control (“PC”) lenses that provide limited movements for these cameras can be purchased from a number of lens makers. High-quality TS or PC lenses are expensive. The price of a new Canon TS-E or Nikon PC-E lens is comparable to that of a good used large-format camera, which offers a much greater range of adjustment.
===Swing===

Altering the angle of the lens standard in relation to the film plane by swiveling it from side to side is called swing. Swing is like tilt, but it changes the angle of the focal plane in the horizontal axis instead of the vertical axis. For example, swing can help achieve sharp focus along the entire length of a picket fence that is not parallel to the film plane.
===Back tilt/swing===
Angular movements of the rear standard change the angle between the lens plane and the film plane just as front standard angular movements do. Though rear standard tilt changes the plane of sharp focus in the same manner as front standard tilt, this is not usually the reason to use rear tilt/swing. When a lens is a certain distance (its focal length) away from the film, distant objects, such as faraway mountains, are in focus. Moving the lens farther from the film brings closer objects into focus. Tilting or swinging the film plane puts one side of the film farther from the lens than the center is and the opposite point of the film is therefore closer to the lens.

One reason to swing or tilt the rear standard is to keep the film plane parallel to the face of the subject. Another reason to swing or tilt the rear standard is to control apparent convergence of lines when shooting subjects at an angle.

It is often incorrectly stated that rear movements can be used to change perspective. The only thing that truly controls perspective is the location of the camera in relation to the objects in the frame. Rear movements can let a photographer shoot a subject from a perspective that puts the camera at an angle to the subject, yet still achieves parallel lines. Thus, rear movements allow a change of perspective by allowing a different camera location, yet no view camera movement actually alters perspective.

==Lenses==

A view camera lens typically consists of: 
* A &quot;front lens element&quot;— sometimes referred to as a &quot;cell.&quot;
* A &quot;shutter&quot;—an electronic or spring-actuated mechanism that controls exposure duration. Some early shutters were air-actuated. For long exposures, a lens with no shutter (a &quot;barrel lens&quot;) can be uncovered for the duration of the exposure by removing a lens cap.
* The aperture diaphragm
* A &quot;lensboard&quot;—a flat board, typically square in shape and made of metal or wood, that locks securely into the front standard of a particular view camera, with a central hole of the right size to insert a lens and shutter assembly, usually secured and made light-tight by screwing a ring onto a thread on the rear of the lens assembly. Lensboards, complete with lenses, can be removed and fitted quickly.
* A &quot;rear lens element&quot; (or cell).

Almost any lens of the appropriate coverage area may be used with almost any view camera. All that is required is that the lens be mounted on a lensboard compatible with the camera. Not all lensboards work with all models of view camera, though different cameras may be designed to work with a common lensboard type. Lensboards usually come with a hole sized according to the shutter size, often called the Copal Number. Copal is the most popular maker of leaf shutters for view camera lenses.

The lens is designed to split into two pieces, the front and rear elements screwed, usually by a trained technician, into the front and back of the shutter assembly, and the whole fitted in a lensboard.

View camera lenses are designed with both focal length and coverage in mind. A 300 mm lens may give a different angle of view (either over 31° or over 57°), depending on whether it was designed to cover a 4×5 or 8×10 image area. Most lenses are designed to cover more than just the image area to accommodate camera movements.

Focusing involves moving the entire front standard with the lens assembly closer to or further away from the rear standard, unlike many lenses on smaller cameras in which one group of lens elements is fixed and another moves.

Very long focus lenses may require that the camera be fitted with special extra-long rails and bellows. Very short focal length wide-angle lenses may require that the standards be closer together than a normal concertina-folded bellows allows. Such a situation requires a &quot;bag bellows&quot;, a simple light-tight flexible bag. Recessed lensboards are also sometimes used to get the rear element of a wide angle lens close enough to the film plane; they may also be of use with telephoto lenses, since these compressed long-focus lenses may also have very small spacing between the back of the lens and the film plane.

Zoom lenses are not used in view camera photography, as there is no need for rapid and continuous change of focal length with static subjects, and the price, size, weight, and complexity would be excessive. Some lenses are &quot;convertible&quot;: the front or rear element only, or both elements, may be used, giving three different focal lengths, though the quality of the single elements is not as good at larger apertures as the combination. These are popular with field photographers who can save weight by carrying one convertible lens rather than two or three lenses of different focal lengths.

Soft focus lenses introduce spherical aberration deliberately into the optical formula for an effect considered pleasing, and flattering to subjects with less than perfect complexions. The degree of soft-focus effect is determined by either aperture size or special disks that fit into the lens to modify the aperture shape. Some antique lenses, and some modern SLR soft focus lenses, provide a lever that controls the softening effect by altering the optical formula.

== Film ==
View cameras use sheet film but can use roll film (generally 120/220 size) by using special roll film holders. Popular &quot;normal&quot; image formats for the 4×5 camera are 6×6, 6×7, and 6×9 cm. 6×12 and 6×17 cm are suited to panoramic photography.

With an inexpensive modification of the darkslide, and no modification to the camera, half a sheet of film can be exposed at a time. While this technique could be used for economy where a larger image is not required, it is almost always used with the intention of obtaining a panoramic format so that, for example, a 4×5 camera can take two 2×5 photos, an 8×10 can take two 4×10s etc. This is popular for landscape photography, and in the past was common for group photographs (hence, half-frame panorama formats such as 4x10 are commonly referred to as &quot;Banquet formats&quot;)

Digital camera backs are available for view cameras to create digital images instead of using film. Prices are high compared to smaller digital cameras.

==Operation==

The camera must be set up in a suitable position. In some cases the subject can also be manipulated, as in a studio. In others the camera must be positioned to photograph subjects such as landscapes. The camera must be mounted in a way that prevents camera motion for the duration of the exposure. Usually a tripod is used—a camera with a long bellows extension may require two.

To operate the view camera, the photographer opens the shutter on the lens to focus and compose the image on a ground glass plate on the rear standard. The rear standard holds the ground glass in the same plane that the film later occupies—so that an image focused on the ground glass is focused on the film. The ground glass image can be somewhat dim and difficult to view in bright light. Photographers often use a focusing cloth or &quot;dark cloth&quot; over their heads and the rear of the camera. The dark cloth shrouds the viewing area and keeps environmental light from obscuring the image. In the dark space created by the dark cloth, the image appears as bright as it can, so the photographer can view, focus, and compose the image.

Often, a photographer uses a magnifying lens, usually a high quality loupe, to critically focus the image. An addition over the ground glass called a Fresnel lens can considerably brighten the ground glass image (with a slight loss of focusing accuracy). The taking lens may be stopped down to help gauge depth of field effects and vignetting, but the photographer generally opens the lens to its widest setting for focusing.

The ground glass and frame assembly, known as the spring back, is held in place by springs that pull and hold the ground glass firmly into the plane of focus during the focusing and composition process. Once focusing is complete, the same springs act as a flexible clamping mechanism to press the film holder into the same plane of focus that the ground glass occupied.

To take the photograph, the photographer pulls back the ground glass and slides the film holder into its place. The shutter is then closed and cocked, the shutter speed and aperture set. The photographer removes the darkslide that covers the sheet of film in the film holder, and triggers the shutter to make the exposure. Finally, the photographer replaces the darkslide and removes the film holder with the exposed film.

Sheet film holders are generally interchangeable between various brands and models of view cameras, adhering to de facto standards. The largest cameras and more uncommon formats are less standardized.

Special film holders and accessories can fit in place of standard film holders for specific purposes. A Grafmatic, for example, can fit six sheets of film in the space of an ordinary two-sheet holder, and some light meters have an attachment that inserts into the film holder slot on the camera back so the photographer can measure light that falls at a specific point on the film plane. The entire film holder/back assembly is often an industry standard Graflex back, removable so accessories like roll-film holders and digital imagers can be used without altering focus.

== Pros and cons compared to medium and 35mm formats ==

=== Advantages ===
* The ability to skew the plane of critical focus: In a camera without movements the film plane is always parallel to the lens plane. A camera with tilts and swings lets the photographer skew the plane of focus away from the parallel in any direction, which in many cases can bring the image of a subject that is not parallel to the lens plane into near-to-far focus without stopping down the aperture excessively. Both standards can be &quot;tilted&quot; through the horizontal or &quot;swung&quot; through the vertical axes to change the plane of focus. Tilts and swings of the front standard alone do not alter or distort shapes or converging lines in the image; tilts and swings of the rear standard do affect these things, as well as the plane of focus: if the plane of focus must be skewed without altering shapes in the image, front movements alone must be used. The Scheimpflug principle explains the relationship between lens tilts and swings, and the plane of sharp focus.
* The ability to distort the shape of the image by skewing the film plane: This is most often to reduce or eliminate, or deliberately exaggerate, convergence of lines that are parallel in the subject. If a camera with parallel film and lens planes is pointed at an angle to a plane subject with parallel lines, the lines appear to converge in the image, becoming closer to each other the further away from the camera they are. With a view camera the rear standard can be swung toward the wall to reduce this convergence. If the standard is parallel to the wall, convergence is eliminated. Moving the rear standard this way skews the plane of focus, which can be corrected with a front swing in the same direction as the rear swing.
* Improved image quality for a print of a given size: The larger a piece of film is, the less detail is lost at a given print size because the larger film requires less enlargement for the same size print. In other words, the same scene photographed on a large-format camera provides a better-quality image and allows greater enlargement than the same image in a smaller format. Additionally, the larger a piece of film is, the more subtle and varied the tonal palette and gradations are at a given print size. A large film size also allows same-size contact printing.
* Shallow depth of field: view cameras require longer focal length lenses than smaller format cameras, especially for the larger sizes, with shallower depth of field, letting the photographer focus solely on the subject.
* Smaller apertures can be used: much smaller apertures can be used than with smaller format cameras before diffraction becomes significant for a given print size.
*Low resale value is an advantage for buyers, but not for sellers. A top-of-the-line 8×10 camera that cost $8,000 new can often be bought in excellent condition, with additional accessories, for $1,500.

=== Disadvantages ===
* Lack of automation: most view cameras are fully manual, requiring time, and allowing even experienced photographers to make mistakes. Some cameras, such as Sinars, have some degree of automation with self-cocking shutters and film-plane metering.
* Steep learning curve: In addition to needing the knowledge required to operate a fully manual camera, view camera operators must understand a large number of technical matters that are not an issue to most small format photographers. They must understand, for example, view camera movements, bellows factors, and reciprocity. A great amount of time and study is needed to master those aspects of large format photography, so learning view camera operation requires a high degree of dedication.
* Large size and weight: monorail view cameras are unsuitable for handheld photography and are in most cases difficult to transport. A folding bed field camera like a Linhof Technika with a lens-coupled range finder system even allows action photography.
* Shallow depth of field: view cameras require longer focal length lenses than smaller format cameras, especially for the larger sizes, with shallower depth of field.
* Small maximum aperture: it is not feasible to make long focal length lenses with the wide maximum apertures available with shorter focal lengths.
* High cost: there is limited demand for view cameras, so that there are no economies of scale and they are much more expensive than mass-produced cameras. Some are handmade. Even though the cost of sheet film and processing is much higher than rollfilm, fewer sheets of film are exposed, which partially offsets the cost.

Some of these disadvantages can be viewed as advantages. For example, slow setup and composure time allow the photographer to better visualize the image before making an exposure. The shallow depth of field can be used to emphasize certain details and deemphasize others (in bokeh style, for example), especially combined with camera movements. The high cost of film and processing encourages careful planning. Because view cameras are rather difficult to set up and focus, the photographer must seek the best camera position, perspective, etc. before exposing. Beginning 35 mm photographers are even sometimes advised to use a tripod specifically because it slows down the picture-taking process.

<text>In chemistry, an acyl group is a moiety derived by the removal of one or more hydroxyl groups from an oxoacid, including inorganic acids. It contains a double-bonded oxygen atom and an organyl group () or hydrogen in the case of formyl group (). In organic chemistry, the acyl group (IUPAC name alkanoyl if the organyl group is alkyl) is usually derived from a carboxylic acid, in which case it has the formula , where R represents an organyl group or hydrogen. Although the term is almost always applied to organic compounds, acyl groups can in principle be derived from other types of acids such as sulfonic acids and phosphonic acids. In the most common arrangement, acyl groups are attached to a larger molecular fragment, in which case the carbon and oxygen atoms are linked by a double bond.

==Reactivity trends==
There are five main types of acyl derivatives. Acid halides are the most reactive towards nucleophiles, followed by anhydrides, esters, and amides. Carboxylate ions are essentially unreactive towards nucleophilic substitution, since they possess no leaving group. The reactivity of these five classes of compounds covers a broad range; the relative reaction rates of acid chlorides and amides differ by a factor of 1013.

A major factor in determining the reactivity of acyl derivatives is leaving group ability, which is related to acidity. Weak bases are better leaving groups than strong bases; a species with a strong conjugate acid (e.g. hydrochloric acid) will be a better leaving group than a species with a weak conjugate acid (e.g. acetic acid). Thus, chloride ion is a better leaving group than acetate ion. The reactivity of acyl compounds towards nucleophiles decreases as the basicity of the leaving group increases, as the table shows.

 Another factor that plays a role in determining the reactivity of acyl compounds is resonance. Amides exhibit two main resonance forms. Both are major contributors to the overall structure, so much so that the amide bond between the carbonyl carbon and the amide nitrogen has significant double bond character. The energy barrier for rotation about an amide bond is 75–85 kJ/mol (18–20 kcal/mol), much larger than values observed for normal single bonds. For example, the C–C bond in ethane has an energy barrier of only 12 kJ/mol (3 kcal/mol). Once a nucleophile attacks and a tetrahedral intermediate is formed, the energetically favorable resonance effect is lost. This helps explain why amides are one of the least reactive acyl derivatives.

Esters exhibit less resonance stabilization than amides, so the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate and subsequent loss of resonance is not as energetically unfavorable. Anhydrides experience even weaker resonance stabilization, since the resonance is split between two carbonyl groups, and are more reactive than esters and amides. In acid halides, there is very little resonance, so the energetic penalty for forming a tetrahedral intermediate is small. This helps explain why acid halides are the most reactive acyl derivatives.

==Compounds==
Well-known acyl compounds are the acyl chlorides, such as acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and benzoyl chloride (C6H5COCl). These compounds, which are treated as sources of acylium cations, are good reagents for attaching acyl groups to various substrates. Amides (RC(O)NR′2) and esters (RC(O)OR′) are classes of acyl compounds, as are ketones (RC(O)R′) and aldehydes (RC(O)H), where R and R′ stand for organyl (or hydrogen in the case of formyl).

==Acylium cations, radicals, and anions==

Acylium ions are cations of the formula . The carbon–oxygen bond length in these cations is near 1.1 Å (110-112 pm), which is shorter than the 112.8 pm of carbon monoxide and indicates triple-bond character.

The carbon centres of acylium ions generally have a linear geometry and sp atomic hybridization, and are best represented by a resonance structure bearing a formal positive charge on the oxygen (rather than carbon): . They are characteristic fragments observed in EI-mass spectra of ketones.

Acylium ions are common reactive intermediates, for example in the Friedel–Crafts acylation and many other organic reactions such as the Hayashi rearrangement. Salts containing acylium ions can be generated by removal of the halide from acyl halides:

Acyl radicals are readily generated from aldehydes by hydrogen-atom abstraction. However, they undergo rapid decarbonylation to afford the alkyl radical:

Acyl anions are almost always unstable—usually too unstable to be exploited synthetically. They readily react with the neutral aldehyde to form an acyloin dimer. Hence, synthetic chemists have developed various acyl anion synthetic equivalents, such as dithianes, as surrogates. However, as a partial exception, hindered dialkylformamides (e.g., diisopropylformamide, HCON&quot;i&quot;Pr2) can undergo deprotonation at low temperature (−78 °C) with lithium diisopropylamide as the base to form a carbamoyl anion stable at these temperatures.

==In biochemistry==
In biochemistry there are many instances of acyl groups, in all major categories of biochemical molecules.

Acyl-CoAs are acyl derivatives formed via fatty acid metabolism. Acetyl-CoA, the most common derivative, serves as an acyl donor in many biosynthetic transformations. Such acyl compounds are thioesters.

Names of acyl groups of amino acids are formed by replacing the &quot;-ine&quot; suffix with &quot;-yl&quot;. For example, the acyl group of glycine is glycyl, and of lysine is lysyl.

Names of acyl groups of ribonucleoside monophosphates such as AMP (5′-adenylic acid), GMP (5′-guanylic acid), CMP (5′-cytidylic acid), and UMP (5′-uridylic acid) are adenylyl, guanylyl, cytidylyl, and uridylyl respectively.

In phospholipids, the acyl group of phosphatidic acid is called phosphatidyl-.

Finally, many saccharides are acylated.

==In organometallic chemistry and catalysis==

Acyl ligands are intermediates in many carbonylation reactions, which are important in some catalytic reactions. Metal acyls arise usually via insertion of carbon monoxide into metal–alkyl bonds. Metal acyls also arise from reactions involving acyl chlorides with low-valence metal complexes or by the reaction of organolithium compounds with metal carbonyls. Metal acyls are often described by two resonance structures, one of which emphasizes the basicity of the oxygen center. &quot;O&quot;-alkylation of metal acyls gives Fischer carbene complexes.

==Nomenclature==
The common names of acyl groups are derived typically by replacing the -ic acid suffix of the corresponding carboxylic acid&#x27;s common name with -yl (or -oyl), as shown in the table below.

In the IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry, the systematic names of acyl groups are derived exactly by replacing the -yl suffix of the corresponding hydrocarbyl group&#x27;s systemic name (or the -oic acid suffix of the corresponding carboxylic acid&#x27;s systemic name) with -oyl, as shown in the table below.

The acyls are between the hydrocarbyls and the carboxylic acids.

The hydrocarbyl group names that end in -yl are not acyl groups, but alkyl groups derived from alkanes (methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl), alkenyl groups derived from alkenes (propenyl, butenyl), or aryl groups (benzyl).

==Reaction mechanisms==
Acyl compounds react with nucleophiles via an addition mechanism: the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. This reaction can be accelerated by acidic conditions, which make the carbonyl more electrophilic, or basic conditions, which provide a more anionic and therefore more reactive nucleophile. The tetrahedral intermediate itself can be an alcohol or alkoxide, depending on the pH of the reaction.

The tetrahedral intermediate of an acyl compound contains a substituent attached to the central carbon that can act as a leaving group. After the tetrahedral intermediate forms, it collapses, recreating the carbonyl C=O bond and ejecting the leaving group in an elimination reaction. As a result of this two-step addition/elimination process, the nucleophile takes the place of the leaving group on the carbonyl compound by way of an intermediate state that does not contain a carbonyl. Both steps are reversible and as a result, nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions are equilibrium processes. Because the equilibrium will favor the product containing the best nucleophile, the leaving group must be a comparatively poor nucleophile in order for a reaction to be practical.

===Acidic conditions===
Under acidic conditions, the carbonyl group of the acyl compound 1 is protonated, which activates it towards nucleophilic attack. In the second step, the protonated carbonyl 2 is attacked by a nucleophile (H−Z) to give tetrahedral intermediate 3. Proton transfer from the nucleophile (Z) to the leaving group (X) gives 4, which then collapses to eject the protonated leaving group (H−X), giving protonated carbonyl compound 5. The loss of a proton gives the substitution product, 6. Because the last step involves the loss of a proton, nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions are considered catalytic in acid. Also note that under acidic conditions, a nucleophile will typically exist in its protonated form (i.e. H−Z instead of Z−).

===Basic conditions===
Under basic conditions, a nucleophile (Nuc) attacks the carbonyl group of the acyl compound 1 to give tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate 2. The intermediate collapses and expels the leaving group (X) to give the substitution product 3. While nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions can be base-catalyzed, the reaction will not occur if the leaving group is a stronger base than the nucleophile (i.e. the leaving group must have a higher p&quot;K&quot;a than the nucleophile). Unlike acid-catalyzed processes, both the nucleophile and the leaving group exist as anions under basic conditions.

This mechanism is supported by isotope labeling experiments. When ethyl propionate with an oxygen-18-labeled ethoxy group is treated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), the oxygen-18 label is completely absent from propionic acid and is found exclusively in the ethanol.

==Acyl species==
In acyloxy groups the acyl group is bonded to oxygen: R−C(=O)−O−R′ where R−C(=O) is the acyl group.

Acylium ions are cations of the formula R−C≡O+. They are intermediates in Friedel-Crafts acylations.

<text>The Unimog (pronunciation in American English: &quot;YOU-nuh-mog&quot;; British English: &quot;YOU-knee-mog&quot;; German: , ) is a Daimler Truck line of multi-purpose, highly offroad capable AWD vehicles with power take-off (PTO) driveshafts that since 1948 can be used with additional equipment in the roles of tractors, light trucks and lorries, for snow plowing, in agriculture, forestry, rural firefighting, in the military, even in rallying and as recreational vehicles. The frame is designed to be a flexible part of the suspension, not to carry heavy loads. 

Conceived in 1944 in response to the Morgenthau Plan, former DB airplane engine engineers developed prototypes under occupation. The small universally-applicable motorised 25hp workhorse should be able to fit over two rows of potatoes to work on fields like a slow agricultural tractor, but with four equal size wheels on portal axles, coil spring suspension, and many gears, it was designed to also run fast on roads like a truck. Unimog production started in 1948 at in Göppingen. When larger production numbers were needed, Daimler-Benz took over manufacture of the Unimog in 1951, and first produced it in their Gaggenau plant, and the Unimog was sold under the Mercedes-Benz brand. However, the first Unimog to feature the three-pointed Mercedes-Benz star instead of the Boehringer bullhead was only introduced in 1953. From the 1970s, the more tractor-like MB-trac series was offered before it was outsourced in 1990. Since 2002, the Unimog has been built in the Mercedes-Benz truck plant in Wörth am Rhein in Germany. The Mercedes-Benz Türk A.Ş. plant assembles Unimogs in Aksaray, Turkey. Unimogs were also built in Argentina (first ever country to do so outside Germany) by Mercedes-Benz Argentina S.A. under licence from 1968 until 1983 (with some extra units built until 1991 off the assembly line from parts in stock) in the González Catán factory near the city of Buenos Aires, as stated in the book &quot;El Unimog en el Ejército Argentino&quot;, by Argentine author and historian Gaston Javier Garcia Loperena in 2015.

The first model was designed by Albert Friedrich and Heinrich Rößler shortly after World War II to be used in agriculture as a self-propelled machine providing a power take-off to operate saws in forests or harvesting machines on fields. It was designed with rear-wheel drive and switchable front-wheel drive, with equal-size wheels, in order to be driven on roads at higher speeds than standard farm tractors. With their very high ground clearance and a flexible frame that is essentially a part of the suspension, Unimogs are not designed to carry as much load as regular trucks.

Due to their off-road capabilities, Unimogs can be found in jungles, mountains and deserts as military vehicles, fire fighters, expedition campers, and even in competitions like truck trials and Dakar Rally rally raids. In Western Europe, they are commonly used as snowploughs, municipal equipment carriers, agricultural implements, forest ranger vehicles, construction equipment or road–rail vehicles and as army personnel or equipment carriers (in its armoured military version). New Unimogs can be purchased in one of two series: medium series 405, also known as the UGN (&quot;Geräteträger&quot; or equipment carrier), and heavy series 437, also known as the UHN (&quot;Hochgeländegängig&quot; or highly mobile cross country).&lt;ref name=&quot;Technical Info U4023/U5023 2014&quot;&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Unimog&quot; is an acronym for the German &quot;UNIversal-MOtor-Gerät&quot;, &quot;Gerät&quot; being the German word for a piece of equipment (also in the sense of &quot;device&quot;, &quot;machine&quot;, &quot;instrument&quot;, &quot;gear&quot;, &quot;apparatus&quot;). It was created by German engineer Hans Zabel, who made the note &quot;Universal-Motor-Gerät&quot; on one of the technical drawings for the Unimog. Later, the &quot;Universal-Motor-Gerät&quot; was shortened to the acronym &quot;Unimog&quot;. On 20 November 1946, the name Unimog was officially unveiled. Since 1952, Unimog has been a brand of Daimler Truck.

== Features ==

=== Design ===
The Unimog&#x27;s characteristic design element is its chassis: a flexible ladder frame with short overhangs, and coil sprung beam portal axles with a central torque tube and transverse links. Having portal axles, the wheels&#x27; centres are below the axle centre, which gives the Unimog a high ground clearance without the need for big tyres. The coil sprung axles with torque tubes allow an axle angle offset of up to , giving the wheels a wide range of vertical movement to allow the truck to drive over extremely uneven terrain, even boulders of one metre in height.

Unimogs are equipped with high visibility driving cabs to enable the operator to see the terrain and more easily manipulate mounted tools. The newest implement carrier Unimog models can be changed from left-hand drive to right-hand drive in the field to permit operators to work on the more convenient side of the truck. The ability to operate on highways enables the Unimog to be returned to a home garage or yard to thwart vandalism.

Unimogs can be equipped with front and rear tool mounting brackets and hydraulic connections to allow bucket loaders and hydraulic arms to be used. Most units have a power takeoff (PTO) connection to operate rotary equipment such as snow brooms, snow blowers, brush mowers, loaders or stationary conveyor belts.

=== Variants ===
Unimogs are available with short wheelbases for implement carrier operations or long wheelbases for all-terrain cargo carrying operations. Currently (2022), Daimler Trucks offers the 437.4 heavy series and the 405 implement carrier series. Starting in 1951 having purchased the traditional Unimog from Boehringer, Daimler-Benz started making the Unimog S series in the mid-1950s and added light, medium and heavy series to the model lineup in the 1960s and 1970s, before they successively reduced the available models during the 1990s to end up with the modern implement carrier and the heavy series today.

Originally, the traditional Unimog 70200 was a rather small agricultural tractor, measuring just in length. It was only offered as a Cabrio with a canvas roof. The engine power output of proved to be insufficient for many applications. To accommodate customer needs, a longer wheelbase version, a proper cab and more powerful engines (up to ) were introduced soon after Daimler-Benz took over Unimog manufacture; the traditional Unimog evolved into its final stage, the 411-series. Yet, Daimler-Benz decided that an entirely new, more powerful version of the Unimog would be required to meet future customer expectations. This Unimog version would later be known as 406-series.

The military Unimog S series is the first Unimog designed to be an offroad truck rather than a tractor, and it is the only series production Unimog that has an Otto engine. Daimler-Benz designed a new frame for it, but it still shares its drivetrain with the 411-series.

With the introduction of the 406-series in 1962, Daimler-Benz laid the foundation for a completely new Unimog model family, the 406-based medium series (in the 1960s known as &quot;heavy&quot; series). It was produced until 1994. Unimogs belonging to the medium series are the series 403, 413, 406, 416, 426, and 419. These models were offered with three different wheelbases (, , ) and two engines, the straight-four and straight-six direct injected Diesel engines OM 314 and OM 352, ranging from . The light series 421 and 431 share their frame design with the 411-series, but borrow their drivetrain and cab design from the 406-series, which is why they also count as 406-related Unimogs.

The heavy series Unimogs were introduced in 1974, and first featured the edgy cab, which is still a design feature of the Unimog today. The first heavy series Unimog was the 425-series, which was available from 1976. Soon after, the 435-series and 424-series followed, which caused a decline in Unimog 406 sales.The 425 was available with a wheelbase of , the 424 with and , and the 435 with , and . The introduction of new engines starting in 1986 caused a shift in the series numbers, but leaving the vehicles mostly unchanged otherwise. The 424 became 427 and both 425 and 435 were joined together and became 437. A derivative of the 437-series, the 437.4-series is still in production today.

In 1988, after declining Unimog sales, Daimler-Benz launched a new strategy that was supposed to increase sales and make the Unimog more profitable, called &quot;Unimog-Programm 1988&quot;. New models introduced with this programme were the new light series 407 and medium series 417, which ought to replace all Unimog 406-related series. 407- and 417-series were replaced after just four years, in 1992, with the 408- and 418-series. in 2000, these two models were replaced with the current 405 implement carrier series, making the 437.4 and the 405 the only remaining Unimog series.

== Technical description ==


=== Chassis ===
Like other trucks, but unlike agricultural tractors, the Unimog is a body-on-frame vehicle with short overhangs. The original Unimog was made with a plane ladder frame and a wheelbase of 1720 mm. Later, the wheelbase was extended several times to accommodate customer needs. Starting in the mid-1950s, with the introduction of the Unimog 404, the frame received a drop. Originally, this was done to make space for a spare tyre, but soon engineers found out that the new frame would improve the torsion performance, which is why all following Unimog series also received a frame with a drop. Several mounting brackets, additional cross members and tool boards were offered as factory options for the frame.

=== Suspension ===
The Unimog has live front and rear axles that have portal gears (portal axles). Such axles have a lifted axle centre, but the wheels&#x27; centre remains unchanged, meaning that a high ground clearance can be achieved with small wheels and tyres. Unlike &quot;regular&quot; trucks, the Unimog has coil springs with hydraulic shock absorbers rather than leaf springs, as coil springs provide more spring travel. The axles themselves have only one longitudinal pivot point each, the so-called torque tubes. The torque tubes contain the drive shafts and connect the axles&#x27; differential gearboxes to the Unimog gearbox, but being also parts of the suspension system, the torque tubes prevent longitudinal movement of the axles, whilst still allowing limited vertical movement. Lateral axle movement is prevented by panhard rods and transverse links. This design results in extreme axle angle offsets of up to possible.

A wide variety of wheels and tyres were available for the Unimog. Originally, the first Unimog was equipped with 6.5–18 in tyres designed for both on- and offroad use. Later, bigger wheels and tyres with different tread patterns were available, reaching from agricultural tractor tread patterns to massive bar tyre treads to low pressure ballon tyre treads. Until 1973, drum brakes were standard for all Unimogs, until they were replaced by disc brakes, however, until 1989, drum brakes remained an option for Unimogs of the 406-family. The steering system used to be a screw-and-nut system until 1970. Then it was replaced by a power assisted ball-and-nut system for the 406-series.

=== Drivetrain ===
The classical Unimog is rear-wheel drive vehicle, meaning that the rear axle is directly connected to the gearbox. Turning on front wheel drive automatically locks both axles, without torque compensation. The mechanical lever that turns on all wheel drive has a third position that locks front- and rear differentials. As of 1963, a pneumatic power switch was used instead of a lever. Due to the reduction gears inside the portal axles, the rotational frequency of the driveshafts inside the torque tubes is relatively high, meaning that the amount of torque they have to withstand is fairly low.

=== Gearbox ===
Traditionally, the Unimog has a splitter gearbox. Over the years, three different &quot;base gearbox&quot; designs have been used, all following the same principle, and having four gears and two ranges (called &quot;groups&quot;) and an additional direction gear. Those designs were &quot;UG-1/xx&quot;, &quot;UG-2/xx&quot;, and &quot;UG-3/xx&quot;. UG is an abbreviation for &quot;Unimog-Getriebe (Unimog-Gearbox)&quot;, the number after the slash resembles the input torque in kp·m (=9.80665 N·m). Until 1955, the Unimog &quot;base gearbox&quot; UG-1 was a constant-mesh countershaft gearbox, it was then upgraded with synchroniser rings to a synchromesh gearbox. However, the synchromesh-version was only used for the 404-series, and the constant-mesh version remained the standard gearbox for the 411-series. In 1957, the synchromesh-version became an option for the 411-series, before it became the standard gearbox for all Unimogs in 1959. The following gearbox versions UG-2 and UG-3 were made as synchromesh versions only.

There are different &quot;layouts&quot; of the gearbox, namely &quot;F-layout&quot; and &quot;G-layout&quot; as well as their upgraded layouts, not having particular names. The F-layout is the original gearbox layout and is limited to the first two gears in the first range as it does not have selector sleeves, meaning that in total there are six forward gears. Instead of a reverse gear, the gearbox has its direction gear, which, in theory, can be used to reverse any gear. Due to the lacking shifting sleeves however, the reverse direction can only be used in the first range, which itself is limited to the first two gears, resulting in only two reverse gears (resulting in six forward and two reverse gears). To operate the gearbox, there is only one shift lever with a six-speed H-layout, the gearbox shifts its ranges automatically. An additional shift lever is used for shifting into reverse. The &quot;G-layout&quot; has an additional reduction gearbox, which can be used in all gears. This effectively doubles the number of gears (twelve forward and four reverse gears). This reduction gearbox was also available with an additional crawler gear, which can only be used in the first range (twenty forward and eight reverse gears). As of 1976, shifting sleeves were added and a four-speed-H-layout replaced the six-speed-H-layout, which allows using all gears in all ranges. With the introduction of the UG-3-gearbox, the standard gearbox-shifter-layout was changed to an eight-speed-H-H-layout, with eight gears on one lever, without any additional switches. When shifting from &quot;4th&quot; into &quot;5th&quot; gear, the gearbox automatically shifts into range 2 and back into gear 1. Crawler gearboxes were offered as a factory option for the UG-3 gearbox as well, resulting in 24 gears. The design with the additional direction gear was kept, which means that all 24 gears can also be used in reverse mode. Since the highest final gear ratio allows top speeds of up to 110 km/h, and the reverse gear only comes with a small reduction of 1:1.03, the top speed in reverse mode is more than 100 km/h. To prevent such high reverse speeds, a lock for the second range was available as a factory option, allowing only the first range (gears &quot;1&quot; to &quot;4&quot;) in reverse mode.

=== Engine ===
The initial Unimogs were equipped with passenger car engines, the first Unimog series to receive a truck engine was the 406-series in 1963. All engines use the Diesel principle, except for engines used for the Unimog 404-series and the first four Unimog prototypes, which use the Otto principle. The following engines were used as of 1947, with &quot;M&quot; being Otto and &quot;OM&quot; being Diesel engines (the list is incomplete):

* M 136
* M 130
* M 180
* OM 636
* OM 621
* OM 615
* OM 616
* OM 312
* OM 314
* OM 352
* OM 353 
=== Cab ===
Traditionally, three different cab options were available for the Unimog: An open roof cab (Cabrio), single cab and double cab, with the single cab being the most popular. Because the Unimog was designed to be a better agricultural tractor, its original design did not include a closed cab (as agricultural tractors in Germany usually did not have a closed cab in the 1940s). The first Unimog series to be officially offered with a cab was the 401-series. However, the first cabs were made by Westfalia in Rheda-Wiedenbrück and then shipped to the Unimog plant in Gaggenau for assembly. These cabs are known as &quot;Westfalia type B&quot; or simply (&#x27;frog&#x27;s eye&#x27;). Starting in 1957, a new cab with 30% more volume, called &quot;Westfalia type DvF&quot;, Typ D, (Type D, widened cab), was used. Both Westfalia cabs were fairly narrow and came with the problem of engine heat causing high cabin temperatures. The first Unimog that was designed with a cab was the series 406. Just for the purpose of manufacturing cabs, Daimler-Benz built a new 1000-Megapond-sheet-panel-press in the Unimog plant. It was planned that the double cab parts would also be produced with this press, instead, the double cabs were manufactured by Wackenhut in Nagold. In 1974, the current heavy-duty-series&#x27; cab was introduced. Its basic design has not been changed since. The equipment carrier versions&#x27; cab on the other hand has received several modifications since its introduction in the late 1980s, with the current version being introduced in 2000.

=== Pneumatics and hydraulics ===
The original Unimog was offered with a pneumatic system. This system was used for powering all auxiliary devices as well as the three-point linkages. As of October 1961, a hydraulics system became an option, and as of 1963, the hydraulics system became standard, but unlike the pneumatics system, the hydraulics system was made by Westinghouse Air Brake Company in Hannover. With the introduction of the hydraulics system, the pneumatics system was solely used for operating the brakes.

== Users ==
=== Military ===
The Unimog was never meant to be a military vehicle; Allied permission to develop the Unimog was granted only because Albert Friedrich, inventor of the Unimog, ensured that the Unimog would not have any military purpose. However, the Unimog has always been used as a military vehicle. 44 Unimogs of the first model, the Unimog 70200, served as combat engineer tractors in the Swiss army. They proved successful, and the Swiss army purchased 540 units of the 70200&#x27;s successor, the Unimog 2010. These early Swiss military vehicles were known as ″Dieseli″. The Dieseli-Unimogs remained in service until 1989. Officers of the French army, then occupying forces in Germany, noted the Unimog testing at the Sauberg in the early 1950s and considered the Unimog useful for patrolling purposes. Soon after, the French army purchased Unimogs of the series 2010 and 401. The Unimog proved to be so successful that Daimler-Benz was ordered to develop an entirely new Unimog just for military purposes. This new model was supposed to be a small 1.5-tonne truck, capable of carrying 10 to 12 soldiers on its bed, at a speed of up to 90 km/h, rather than being an agricultural tractor. Being a NATO member state, France demanded that the military Unimog would have an engine running on petrol. Daimler-Benz decided to use an Otto cycle engine, the M 180, displacing 2.2 litres, and producing 85 PS (63 kW). The military Unimog would later be known as Unimog 404 or Unimog S.

In total, 64,242 units of the Unimog 404 were produced, which makes it the Unimog with the highest production figure. 36,638 Unimog 404 were purchased by the German Bundeswehr. Apart from the Bundeswehr, many different military forces have either used the Unimog in the past or still make use of it today. In addition to the military series 404, several civilian models have been adapted for military use. In Argentina, the series 426, actually a version of the civilian series 416 produced under licence, was made for the Argentinian, Chilean, Peruvian and Bolivian military. In total, 2643 units of the series 426 were made. The Argentinian made Unimog 431, which was a licensed version of the civilian series 421, was also used as a military vehicle, mainly as a self-propelled howitzer. Another civilian Unimog that was mainly used a military vehicle, is the series 418.

The military Unimogs are used as troop transportation vehicles, ambulances, and mobile command centers equipped with military communications equipment. The United States Marine Corps and United States Army uses the Unimog 419 as an engineer tractor, while the United States Army also uses Unimog vehicles to access remote installations. In total, 2416 Unimog 419 were made, and only used by United States Forces. Modern Unimogs also serve as military vehicles, and the current Unimog 437.4 chassis is used for the ATF Dingo. More than 5,500 Unimogs are in active service in the Turkish Armed Forces. They were produced by Mercedes-Benz Türk.

=== Civilian ===
Unimogs are used by the German emergency management agency Technisches Hilfswerk (THW),(literally &quot;Technical Relief Organization&quot;), by fire departments and municipalities as utility vehicles. They can be used as material handlers, auxiliary power providers (generators), and equipment carriers. Their ability to operate off-road, in high water, or mud, makes it easier to access remote areas in emergency situations. They are commonly used in snow removal where other vehicles might not be able to operate. Many Alpine towns and districts are equipped with one or more Unimog snow blowers to clear narrow mountain roads that have drifted closed.

In construction, Unimogs are used as carriers of equipment and, with the optional extended cabin, also of workers. They can be equipped with a backhoe, front loader, or other contracting equipment. On railroads, Unimogs are used as rail car movers and road-rail vehicles. They have also been used in mining areas, like seen in Gold Bridge, BC, Canada.

In agriculture, Unimogs are used to operate farm equipment. While most farm field implement operations are now performed by a tractor, Unimogs are used to haul produce, machinery and animals. They are also used around the farmyard to run chippers, grain augers, and conveyors.

Unimogs are also used as a prime mover, to pull heavy trailers, large wheeled conveyances and jet airliners. Often, only the front half, (an OEM part), is combined with a tailor-made rear.

Unimogs are used as tourist transport for jungle ecotourism or safaris.

=== North America ===

Unimogs have been uncommon in North America because of differing vehicle regulations and requirements from those in Germany, and due to the lack of a North American sales and support network. Most Unimog models found in North America have been imported by individual dealers or independent enthusiasts.

Between 1975 and 1980 the Case Corporation (now merged into CNH Global) imported the U-900 model into the United States and sold it through Case tractor dealerships as the MB4/94.

In 2002 DaimlerChrysler tried to re-enter the North American market with the Unimog and engaged in four years of aggressive marketing, which included activities such as; truck and trade shows, exposure on the television show &quot;Modern Marvels&quot;, numerous magazine articles and extensive demonstrations (both touring and on an individual basis). They were generally sold through Freightliner truck dealerships. Freightliner is a Daimler AG subsidiary. The UGN series was specifically manufactured for the North American market and was significantly different mechanically from its European counterpart. The UGN faced stiff competition in North America by manufacturers whose truck or equipment lines performed some of the same duties as the Unimog. Some of them are Caterpillar, John Deere, AM General, Sterling Trucks (also a Daimler AG subsidiary), and General Motors. After five years and selling only 184 Unimogs, Freightliner LLC exited the market. Daimler AG cited non-compliance with EPA07 emission requirements as the main reason for ceasing North American sales.

=== Motorsport ===

Unimogs have been used in three kinds of competition: Dakar Rally and other desert rally competitions, mud bogging, and slow-moving Truck Trials over obstacles.

Unimogs have won the truck class of the Dakar in 1982 and 1986, the latter an unexpected victory as the vehicle participated for Honda, primarily to provide support for the motorcycles of the team. High-powered factory-sponsored entries of truck companies aiming for the overall win have since taken the laurels, with Unimogs used mainly for service purposes.

== Derivatives ==
=== MB-trac ===

In 1968 the Unimog department in Gaggenau began development of the MB-trac, a tractor based on the Unimog 403 drivetrain. It was produced by Daimler-Benz until 1991, when the product line was sold to Werner Forst- und Industrietechnik. Werner continues to produce it as the WF trac.

=== Military derivatives ===

The Unimog also serves as a technical platform for armoured vehicles like the ATF Dingo, a mine-protected utility and reconnaissance vehicle used by the German and other European Armed Forces (e.g. Belgium) for territorial defence purposes as well as in international missions.

In late Autumn 1956, Daimler-Benz started developing a new military version of the Unimog, the &quot;Unimog SH&quot;. It was based on the Unimog S and had a rear engine (German: Heckmotor), hence the name Unimog &quot;SH&quot;. Until 1960, Daimler-Benz completed 24 Unimog SH and sent them to AB Landsverk for final assembly. Initially, the Belgian Army intended to purchase these vehicle for their police forces in the Belgian Congo, but only 9 vehicles were actually sold to the Belgian forces; the 15 remaining vehicles were purchased by the Irish Army in 1972. They were intended as a stop-gap vehicle for use until the first Panhard M3 VTT APCs entered service in 1972. The type had excellent off-road capability but poor on-road handling due to a high centre of gravity and several accidents occurred as a result. A four-man dismountable squad was carried, but space was cramped, and in any case a four-man detachment was far too small for any sort of realistic military purpose. Other considerations were that the FN MAG gunner&#x27;s position was too exposed. Eventually the Unimog Scout Cars arrived in Ireland in February 1972, their departure having been delayed by a local peace group who thought they were destined for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA). By mid-1978 all had been transferred to the Irish Army Reserve, the FCA. All were withdrawn by 1984, and two are preserved; one in the transport museum in Howth Co Dublin and one in the Muckleburgh Collection, England.

An updated version of the Unimog SH, the Unimog T was made for the German Bundeswehr in 1962. The German defence ministry decided not to purchase the Unimog T, which is why it was never put into series production. Further armoured vehicles developed in Germany using Unimog chassis are the UR-416, the Sonderwagen 4 and Condor 1 in Police service, and the ATF Dingo used by the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan. The French Aravis mine-protected vehicle, like the Dingo, based on the Special Chassis FGA 12.5. The Buffel, Mamba, RG-31, and RG-33 armoured personnel carriers from South Africa are based upon the Unimog driveline. The AV-VBL developed by Brazil&#x27;s Tectran is also an AFV family based on the Unimog.

== History ==
=== 1940s ===
==== 1945 – First prototype ====

Originally, the Unimog was developed in post-war Germany to be used as agricultural equipment. It was designed with equal-sized wheels, a mounting bracket in front, a hitch in the rear, and loading space in the center. This was to make it a multi-purpose vehicle that farmers could use in the field and on the highway.
Albert Friedrich was granted permission to develop the Unimog in November 1945, and entered a production agreement with Erhard und Söhne (Erhard and Sons) in Schwäbisch Gmünd on 1 December 1945. Development began on 1 January 1946. Soon after, Heinrich Rößler, the Unimog lead designer, joined the development team. The first prototype was ready by the end of 1946. The early prototypes were equipped with the M 136 Otto engine, because the development of the OM 636 Diesel engine had not been finished. The prototypes were similar to the later series production models. The original track width of was equivalent to two potato rows.

==== 1947 – Production ====

The 25-PS (18 kW) OM 636 Mercedes-Benz Diesel engine became standard equipment in the first production Unimogs at the end of 1947. The original emblem for the Unimog was a pair of ox horns in the shape of the letter U. The first 600 units of the 70200 series Unimogs were built by Boehringer. This was done mainly for two reasons: Erhard und Söhne did not have the capacity to build the Unimogs and Boehringer (a former tool manufacturer) could evade dismantling.

=== 1950s ===

In late 1950, Mercedes-Benz entered into a contract with Boeringer to take over production of the Unimog.

==== 1951 – Daimler-Benz – Gaggenau manufacturing plant ====

Daimler-Benz modified the Unimog for mass production to create the series 2010 and in 1951, started its manufacture in their Gaggenau plant in Baden-Württemberg, where production continued until 2002.

==== 1953 – The 401, 402 and the closed cab ====
In 1953, the Unimog was updated and the three-pointed Mercedes star began to appear on the bonnet, replacing the Unimog ox horn emblem. The new model became known as the series 401. A new series 402 with a long wheelbase chassis ( instead of ) also became available.

An enclosed driver&#x27;s cab was available as an option from 1953, making the Unimog a true all-weather vehicle.

==== 1955 – The 404 S ====

In 1955, the first Unimog 404 S series were produced. The primary customer of the 404 S was the Bundeswehr (literally &quot;Federal Defence&quot;, i.e. the West German Armed Forces), which was created in the mid-1950s in the era of the Cold War.

The 404 was intended to be a mobile cross-country truck, instead of an agricultural implement. The 404 S is the most popularly produced variant. 64,242 units were produced between 1955 and 1980. The oldest 404 known to exist is the first 1953 prototype, located in an East German museum.

==== 1957 ====
Starting in 1957, the Unimog 411 was offered with a synchromesh gearbox as an option, and in 1959, the synchromesh gearbox became standard.

=== 1960s ===

The 406/416 &quot;middle series&quot; were produced beginning in 1963. They were equipped with the six-cylinder pre-combustion chamber Diesel engine OM 312 producing . The 406 and 416 are similar, The 416 having a longer wheelbase compared to for the 406. Starting in 1964, the 406-series was equipped with the direct injected OM 352 Diesel engine starting with and going up to ( for the Unimog 416).

Between the original Unimog and the middle series, Daimler-Benz developed a &quot;light&quot; series. The light series consisted of two separate Unimog series, the 421 and the 403. The 403, which basically is a 406-series with a 3.8-litre four-cylinder engine, has a wheelbase and was later supplemented by the 413-series, which is a four-cylinder-version of the 416-series (long wheelbase () model). The 421 is the successor of the 411-series and has a wheelbase. It is powered by a 2.2-litre passenger car Diesel engine.

The 100,000th Unimog (a 421) was built in 1966 in Gaggenau.

Argentina was the first country to manufacture the Unimog outside Germany. The first Unimog produced in the Mercedes-Benz Argentina S.A. factory in Gonzalez Catán, in the outskirts of Buenos Aires city, rolled off the assembly line on 1 September 1968.

The two models made in Argentina, are the 426 and 431. They are versions of the 416 respectively 431 produced under licence.

=== 1970s ===
==== 1972 – MB Trac ====

Despite originally being designed as an agricultural vehicle, the Unimog had more success as a multi-purpose tool carrier. To actually serve the agricultural market, Daimler-Benz designed a completely new agricultural tractor in 1972, the MB Trac. It is a body-on-frame design &quot;trac&quot;-tractor, has four big wheels of the same size, and all-wheel-drive, a slim bonnet, and an angular driver cab. In contrast to conventional tractors the cab is situated between the axles, similar to comparable four-wheel-drive tractors. There is no articulation between the front and rear sections, instead, the MB Trac has conventional steering.

A wide range of MB Trac tractors were offered, ranging from the entry model MB-trac 65 to the top model MB Trac 1800 intercooler. Daimler-Benz later merged the MB-trac with the agricultural machinery activities of Deutz AG. The manufacturing of the MB Trac series ceased in 1991.

==== 1974 – Heavy series ====

In 1974, Mercedes-Benz presented the new Unimog U 120. It was the first model of the &quot;heavy duty&quot; Unimog series 425. The heavy duty series, or simply &quot;heavy&quot; series, extended the Unimog model lineup. The characteristic &quot;edgy&quot; bonnet introduced with the heavy Unimog series remains am Unimog style element to this day.

The series 425 have a wheelbase, 9 t permissible maximum mass and an OM 352 Diesel engine producing (shortly thereafter as U 125).

==== 1975 – Series 435 ====

Manufacture of the series 435 for the Bundeswehr began in 1975, as a successor of the Unimog S 404. The 435 was characterized by a long wheelbase of , or and shares its cab with the series 425.

==== 1976 – Unimog models renamed ====

The new 424 &quot;middle&quot; series of Unimogs was produced starting from 1976. They share the cab with the series-425 and are designated U 1000, U 1300/L, U 1500, and U 1700/L with engine performance.

In the same period Daimler-Benz re-ordered the type designations for the older series. The classical round form series of the Unimog were now designated U 600/L, U 800/L, U 900 and U 1100/L. (The letter L stands for a long wheelbase, because most models were available in two wheelbase variants.)

The Unimog with the rounded driving cab became known as the &quot;light&quot; series. The new series with angular cab was divided by payload into a &quot;middle&quot; and &quot;heavy&quot; series. Some engines overlap – the Unimog nomenclature is not simple to understand (see below for notes on series names).

The long-proven Unimog-S (404), although with clearly decreasing production figures, was the only Unimog with an Otto cycle engine in the lineup.

With the exception of the entry-level model, all Unimogs for 1976 were equipped with four wheel disc brakes.

==== 1977 – 200,000th Unimog ====
The 200,000th Unimog, a 424.121, was produced in 1977.

=== 1980s ===

In 1980, production of the U 404 (Unimog S) ended.

The light and medium series 407 and 427 were introduced in 1985.

Production of the 406 and 416 ceased in 1988 and the 437-series was introduced the same year.

=== 1990s ===
==== 1992 – New light models ====

In the early 1990s, the new light models 408 (U 90) and 418 (U 110-U 140) with newly designed cabins were introduced to replace the predecessor models. The new very diagonal front portion gives the operator a good overview forward. The 408 features an asymmetric front bonnet, which is lower on the driver&#x27;s side. This is supposed to permit the driver a good overview. A new ladder frame and progressively working coil springs to improve the Unimog&#x27;s handling were implemented. In addition to that, the Unimog received a new tyre pressure adjustment system that can be operated whilst driving, an anti-skid system, new engines, and a &quot;Servolock&quot; mechanism for the hydraulic connection of implements.

==== 1994 – The &quot;Funmog&quot; ====
In March 1994, Mercedes-Benz presented the design concept &quot;Funmog&quot;, a luxury version of the Unimog, on the International Off-Road-Exhibition in Köln, Germany. It was based on the 408-series and only built for customers who special-ordered it. Until 1997, Daimler-Benz made exactly 12 units of the Funmog, out of which most were exported to Japan. The Funmog features chrome bull bars, and air horns, but lacks hydraulics and is limited to a total mass of 5,000 kg. Mercedes-Benz offered luxury options such as leather seats, fine carpeting and other interior modifications for the Funmog. Starting price was DM 140,000.

==== 1995 – U 2450 L 6×6 ====

In 1995, the Unimog U 2450 L 6×6 (437.156), an all-wheel-drive, 3-axle Unimog version, was presented.

==== 1996 – UX 100 ====
Mercedes-Benz presented the Unimog 409 (officially called UX 100) in 1996. It is the smallest Unimog model ever made and designed to slip speedily over sidewalks and around plants. Within a few years, production of the UX 100 was transferred to the Multicar subsidiary of Hako GmbH, who specialize in vehicles of this kind and size.

=== 2000s ===


The all-new range of UGN models (405 series U 300, U 400, U 500) was introduced in 2000.

In August 2002 production ended in the Gaggenau plant after 51 years and more than 320,000 Unimogs being made, and started up in Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s truck manufacturing plant in Wörth am Rhein. The U 3000, U 4000 and U 5000 models (UHN 437.4 series) were introduced at the same time.

At the Dubai Motor Show in December 2005, the &quot;Unimog U 500 Black Edition&quot; premiered as an offering to wealthy desert-dwellers. It is a similar luxury offering comparable to the Funmog.

Starting from June 2006 the UGN series was produced with BlueTec technology so that the Euro IV emission requirements would be met. The design designations changed from 405.100 to 405.101.

At the IAA 2006 commercial vehicle show in Hanover a new Unimog&quot; U 20 &quot; was presented, which was to be available at the end of 2007. The most striking feature is the cab over design with no vestigial front bonnet characteristic of the traditional Unimog. It has a total mass of 7,500 kg up to 8,500 kg. The underlying technology comes from the U 300. The driving cab is from the new Brazilian Accelo light truck (Caminhões Leves) series. The wheelbase is shortened to .

=== 2010s ===

In August 2013, production of the next generation models commenced at the Wörth plant. The new models feature redesigned cabins and new engines that were claimed to meet the Euro VI emission standards.
== Series numbers and models ==
Unimog series numbers like 401, 406, or 425 in this article are the factory numerical designation (in German &quot;Baumuster&quot;, literally &quot;Construction Pattern&quot;). Unimogs also have a sales model number like U 80, U 120, or U 1350. Each series can have several model numbers, as they are equipped with different engines or chassis options.

Originally, the &quot;U&quot; model numbers were roughly equivalent to the horsepower of the engine (in German: PS):
* A 424.121 with a wheelbase equipped with the OM 352 engine is a U 1000
* A 427.100 with a wheelbase and the 100-PS 366 engines is also a U 1000.

Starting in 1976, model numbers added an extra 0 at the end. More recent model numbers may have three or four digits and sometimes do not relate to horsepower (the engine of the U 5000 is rated at 218 PS). The most recent models introduced since 2013 are:
* The 437.4 series is intended for extreme offroad use, with the smaller U 4023 and larger U 5023 models, which are only available with 230 PS engines
* The 405 series is intended for use with implements, with three digit model numbers. The first digit is related to the vehicle size (U 200, U 300, U400 and U 500 model ranges) and the second and third digits related to the engine power, starting from the 190 PS U 219 and going up to the 350 PS U 535.

<text>California State University, Northridge (CSUN or Cal State Northridge), is a public university in the Northridge neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, United States. With a total enrollment of 36,368 students (as of Fall 2023), it has the second largest undergraduate population as well as the third largest total student body in the California State University system, making it one of the largest comprehensive universities in the United States in terms of enrollment size. The size of CSUN also has a major impact on the California economy, with an estimated $1.9 billion in economic output generated by CSUN on a yearly basis. As of Fall 2021, the university had 2,187 faculty, of which 794 (or about 36%) were tenured or on the tenure track.

California State University, Northridge, was founded first as the Valley satellite campus of California State University, Los Angeles. It then became an independent college in 1958 as San Fernando Valley State College, with major campus master planning and construction. In 1972, the university adopted its current name of California State University, Northridge. The 1994 Northridge earthquake caused $400 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in damage to the campus, the heaviest damage ever sustained by an American college campus.

The university offers 134 different bachelor&#x27;s degree and master&#x27;s degree programs in 70 fields, as well as 4 doctoral degrees (2 Doctor of Education programs, Doctor of Audiology, and Doctor of Physical Therapy) and 24 teaching credentials. It is classified among &quot;Master&#x27;s Colleges &amp; Universities: Larger Programs&quot;.

CSUN is home to the National Center on Deafness and the university hosts the annual International Conference on Technology and Persons with Disabilities, more commonly known as the CSUN Conference. Cal State Northridge is a Hispanic-serving institution.

==History==
===Establishment===
The establishment of CSUN began in 1952 with the proposal of a new satellite campus for Los Angeles State College (now known as California State University, Los Angeles), to be established in Baldwin Hills. However, San Fernando Valley advocates persuaded state officials, including California Assembly member Julian Beck, to change the location to Northridge after a meeting at the Brown Derby restaurant on Wilshire Boulevard. The origins of San Fernando Valley State College trace back to September 1955, when classes first began in 10 leased classrooms at San Fernando High School. The official groundbreaking of the university occurred on January 4, 1956, and was performed by, among others, the Governor of California Goodwin Knight and Los Angeles State College President Howard S. McDonald. While it is situated in a suburban location nowadays, it was a rural location during its founding with several agricultural lands having to be cleared to start construction.

===1956–1965===
Classes started on September 24, 1956, in temporary buildings, with an enrollment of 1,500 students. Delmar Oviatt, the former namesake of the campus library (subsequently renamed University Library), was the dean of the satellite campus until July 1, 1958, when the campus separated from Los Angeles State College and was renamed San Fernando Valley State College (popularly abbreviated to Valley State College, Valley State, or SFVSC) after the California Legislature passed Assembly Bill No. 971. Ralph Prator was assigned as the first president of the university and enrollment reached 2,525 with a tuition of $29 per semester. During that same year, the first graduation ceremony was held for around 100 students at the Hollywood Bowl before being moved to campus during subsequent years. In 1959, the university became the first State College to have its own computer. In 1964, the pioneering computer lab was moved into new quarters in the recently completed Sierra Hall building complex, and student enrollment reached nearly 12,000. Other buildings were also swiftly constructed during the early 1960s to accommodate this rapidly growing student population. Additionally, in November 1963 the university established its own radio station, which continues operation to this day as KCSN.

On October 25, 1960, then vice presidential nominee Lyndon B. Johnson visited the campus accompanied by Governor Pat Brown to hold a rally in front of approximately 3,500 students. While some attending students were holding banners in support of his opponents, Johnson used the opportunity to criticize the opposing Republican Party and their candidate Richard Nixon. Four years later, then Republican candidate Nelson Rockefeller held a rally at the university in front of around 6,000 students, which was organized by the university&#x27;s Republican Club. Having just won the primary in Oregon, California would be crucial in deciding the Republican nominee for the 1964 presidential election. Rockefeller held the lead coming into California but nonetheless lost its primary to Barry Goldwater, effectively handing him the Republican nomination. In December 1965, with increasing conversation and tension on the topic of civil rights in the country, the university hosted a debate on the subject between conservative author and commentator William F. Buckley Jr. and liberal African American journalist Louis Lomax.

===1966–1972===

The campus&#x27;s quiet, moderately conservative and overwhelmingly white suburban setting did not shield it from a share of the noise, strife and social upheavals of the Vietnam War era. As on many college campuses, there were increasingly large antiwar demonstrations and occasional draft card burnings.

In September 1966, Vice President Hubert Humphrey visited the campus, where he was met by student protest and opposition to the Vietnam War. On March 25, 1968, a presidential primary campaign speech on campus by Robert F. Kennedy drew an orderly crowd of 10,000 and mainly focused on his opposition to the Vietnam War. Shortly thereafter, his opponent Eugene McCarthy also held a rally at the university which drew a crowd of 7,000 spectators; surprisingly smaller than the crowd of Robert Kennedy as campus polling indicated McCarthy was more popular.

However, 1968 would not end quite so peacefully on the campus. The April assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis, Tennessee, soon followed by the June assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in Los Angeles, then the August 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, had led to a series of riots throughout the nation. On November 4, the assault of an African American student athlete by his white coach on the CSUN campus led a group of African American students to hold the acting college president and more than 30 staff members hostage in the Administration Building for several hours, pressing demands for greater outreach in minority enrollment and employment and the establishment of minority studies departments. No one was hurt and, under duress, the president agreed to their demands. After subsequent negotiations, minority enrollment was increased and both the Africana and Chicano/a departments were established. Despite an assurance of amnesty, 28 of the students involved were later charged with kidnapping, assault, conspiracy, and false imprisonment, according to scholar Martha Biondi &quot;the most serious crimes ever in the history of campus protest.&quot; Nineteen were convicted and three served time in state prison. Almost one month later, a fire started by an arsonist gutted the president&#x27;s office. 
Furthermore, several massive antiwar demonstrations took place during 1969–1970, variously resulting in campus shutdowns, heavy police responses, violent clashes, hundreds of arrests, and in a few cases serious injuries to demonstrators. The last such demonstration was in May 1971, on the first anniversary of the Kent State shootings.

Aside from the demonstrations, the university also catered to hippie culture when Janis Joplin performed with Big Brother and the Holding Company at what is now the Matadome on May 12, 1968. Additionally, the Newport Pop Festival was held at the Devonshire Downs, now CSUN&#x27;s North Campus, in June 1969 and attracted 200,000 attendees to watch performances by Jimi Hendrix, Ike &amp; Tina Turner, Marvin Gaye, Jethro Tull and various others.

Despite the turmoil during this period, the university continued to grow and construction of the Oviatt Library began on May 19, 1971. The college also officially renamed itself to California State University, Northridge on June 1, 1972, by action of the Legislature and the Board of Trustees of the California State University.

===1973–1988===
On October 24, 1973, the university&#x27;s library, once named the Oviatt Library and renamed to the University Library in 2020, was completed and opened. In 1975, the construction of the CSUN sculpture began at the southeast corner of campus after the design by alumnus John T. Banks. By 1977, enrollment at the university was 28,023, with tuition at $95. In 1981, the campus officially established a foreign exchange student program with Japan, China, Ukraine, South Korea, Taiwan, Brazil and the Netherlands. In 1988, the campus had an enrollment of 31,575 and a $342 tuition fee.

In 1974, in partnership with UC Santa Barbara, CSUN opened the Ventura Learning Center in Ventura. This became the CSUN Ventura Campus in 1988 and was spun off into California State University, Channel Islands in 1998.

===1989–1997===
In 1990, the Marilyn Magaram Center for Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics was established; the Oviatt Library east and west wings were added; and the campus could boast of having the California State University system&#x27;s only fully established astronomy department with a planetarium.
The 1994 Northridge earthquake struck on January 17 and caused $400 million in damage to the campus, the heaviest damage ever sustained by an American college campus. The epicenter was less than two miles (3 km) away on a previously undiscovered blind thrust fault. Later the same month, Vice President Al Gore visited with a promise of funds to help with the reconstruction. Entire sections of the main library, the art building and several other major structures were either physically unusable or too hazardous to occupy. Among the structures judged to be so seriously damaged that repair was not a practical option were the Fine Arts building, designed by noted modernist architect Richard Neutra, and the South Library, the oldest permanent building on campus. The art courtyard survived. Due to inadequate earthquake engineering, the parking structure next to the Matadome was completely destroyed. It is currently a grass field used for kinesiology instruction, though the driveway formerly used to enter it is still visible from Zelzah Avenue. The large American flag atop the Oviatt Library was installed after the earthquake and has been flown ever since. In the aftermath of the 1994 earthquake, CSUN civil engineering faculty and students took part in the research on earthquake protection of building structures, in particular, in the field of seismic performance, vibration control, and base isolation.

Despite the extensive damage, classes for the spring term started only two weeks late. The classes were held in rapidly constructed tents and temporary facilities, remaining campus buildings deemed safe for use, and local high schools, community colleges, and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) while the campus was being rebuilt. On January 17, 1995, President Bill Clinton visited the campus to commemorate the first anniversary of the quake.

===1997–2019===

In April 1999, the Board of CSU trustees decided to give $27 million to construct post-earthquake projects. The university opened the first Central American Studies program in the nation in May 2000. In 2003, both University Hall and Manzanita Hall were opened, marking the completion of the earthquake recovery program. California State University trustees on March 15, 2006, voted their unanimous approval of Envision 2035, the Cal State Northridge planning initiative that framed the university&#x27;s physical development for the next several decades. The vote approved the revised master plan as well as an increase in the campus&#x27; master plan enrollment capacity from 25,000 to 35,000 full-time equivalent students (FTEs). The trustees also certified the final environmental impact report on the plan. The university in 2007, with clean energy advocates, built the new 1 megawatt fuel cell power plant which was the largest of its kind in any university in the world.

The campus community maintained its legacy of activism when budget cuts and tuition fee hikes were announced during the financial crisis of 2007–08. Students formed the Students Against Rising Tuition group and protested while Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger visited the campus in February 2008. Subsequently, students, staff and faculty protested further cuts introduced by the Governor later in the year. Protests against the budget cuts continued on March 4, 2010, when a statewide protest against the budget cuts was organized, with several professors cancelling class and large numbers of students leaving their classes to join the protests and march down Reseda Boulevard. The protests resulted in several arrests, but in turn students raised allegations of abusive behavior from the police. Aside from the protests, politicians continued to visit the campus as in previous decades, this time with visits from 2008 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, United States Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, and a visit in 2016 from future Vice President (then Attorney General of California) Kamala Harris.

The turmoil and budget cuts did not prevent Envision 2035 from being executed. Projects completed as part of the plan included Chaparral Hall (completed in 2009), the Younes and Soraya Nazarian Center for the Performing Arts (opened in 2011), the Student Recreation Center (opened in 2012), the Transit Center (finished in 2012), the Extended University Commons building (completed in 2016), the AS Sustainability Center (finished in 2017), and Lilac Hall (opened in 2019).

This period also saw increased donations to the university, with gift commitments reaching a record $31.7 million in 2018. Major donations included $7 million from Michael Eisner in 2002, $7.3 million from the Bayramian family estate in 2005, $10 million from Mike Curb in 2006, $10 million from David Nazarian in 2014, and a then record $17 million from Younes Nazarian in 2017. Various corporations like Amazon Alexa, Autodesk, Ernst &amp; Young, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, KPMG and NASA also provided support to the university. This period also saw an increase in sponsored research.

In 2019, a record 11,627 students graduated from the university. The same year, president Dianne F. Harrison announced she would retire at the end of June 2020.

=== 2020-present ===
Like many other universities around the U.S. and the world, CSUN was heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The university ceased in-person instruction on March 12, 2020, when the pandemic started to take hold in the United States. Two months later, the California State University was the first in the nation to announce that fall instruction would also be almost exclusively online. The university saw major revenue losses as a result of the pandemic and announced a budget cut in August 2020, despite receiving the 7th largest amount in the nation from the first wave of Covid relief funds under the CARES Act. In total, CSUN received the most federal Covid relief funds ($265 million) out of all universities in California after the three waves of relief funds from the CARES Act, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. In January 2021, CSUN became a vaccination site. When the site closed in June of the same year, around 250,000 people had been vaccinated on the campus.

CSUN received the two largest donations in its history in 2021. On June 15, 2021, the university announced it had received a donation of $40 million from MacKenzie Scott and her husband Dan Jewett; the largest gift from a single donor in its history. Three months later CSUN announced it had received the second largest donation in its history, $25 million, from Apple. The donation, combined with $25 million of state appropriations and over $7 million in support from Autodesk, was used for the establishment of a Global Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) Equity Innovation Hub and construction of the Autodesk Technology Engagement Center (which houses the hub). The hub allows for collaboration from across the CSU and other hispanic-serving institutions to improve student success, equity, and prepare students from historically disadvantaged backgrounds for STEM careers. Moreover, Apple will provide technology, design support and creative support at the hub as the project matures. The public–private partnership was made possible by political support from various state politicians, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Senator Alex Padilla, as well as an initial donation of $1 million from Autodesk for a feasibility study.

During this time period the university also completed construction of Maple Hall, which was financed by $49.9 million of CSU funds. The completion of this building cleared the way to renovate neighboring Sierra Hall, pending funding and construction approval.

==Academics==
=== Admissions ===
In the fall of 2018, there were 60,519 applicants, of which 31,102 were admitted for an acceptance rate of 51.4%. As of fall 2018, CSUN has the largest enrollment percentage of Latino Americans that are not Mexican American in the Cal State system. These are Latino Americans with heritage from Central America, South America and the Caribbean. In addition, CSUN has the third largest enrollment percentage of non-residents in the California State University system.

===International students===
For the academic year 2015–2016, the number of foreign students who attended U.S. institutions exceeded the one million mark. During the same year, CSUN was ranked as the number one Master&#x27;s institution, having the highest number of international students in the United States. The total number of international students for that academic year totaled 3,924.

===Colleges===
CSUN is divided into nine colleges:
*Mike Curb College of Arts, Media, &amp; Communication
*College of Humanities
*College of Science and Mathematics
*College of Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences
*David Nazarian College of Business &amp; Economics
*Michael D. Eisner College of Education
*College of Engineering &amp; Computer Science
*College of Health &amp; Human Development
*Roland Tseng College of Extended Learning

===Joint degrees===
The university, in partnership with Southwestern Law School, offers a dual B.A./J.D degree. The program allows students to graduate within six years instead of the traditional seven if both degrees were taken separately. The program began in fall 2014 with an estimated cohort size of 35 students. In addition, students accepted into the program receive an initial $10,000 Wildman/Schumacher entering student scholarship. Students in the program will have their first year of law school double count as their fourth year of undergraduate education.

The Roland Tseng College of Extended Learning is a division within the university aimed at addressing the educational needs of mid-career professionals. The college develops and offers study opportunities which are designed to ensure that the individuals, communities and organizations served by the university achieve their lifelong learning goals.

==== Community College Collaboratives ====
CSUN offers a pathway program for academic progression in the field of Nursing that links CSUN with designated California Community College (CC) partners. This program enables students who are interested in attaining an ADN to earn a BSN degree in just years from starting the program. Students will be concurrently enrolled in both nursing programs, taking courses for their BSN while completing their associate degree at the community college. On completion of their ADN students will be able to complete their BSN in one year. Students must be accepted into an ADN program at one of the participating community colleges.

The following California Community Colleges are currently partnered up with CSUN Nursing: Glendale Community College, College of the Canyons, Los Angeles Valley College, and Pierce College.

===Central American Studies Department===
Central American Studies is an interdisciplinary academic space with an emphasis on the transnational character of Central America. The department is the only program to focus on Central Americans in the United States. The Central American Studies program was established in 2000 after years of lobbying were derailed by the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The program began with a minor which required 18 units for graduation and developed into a Bachelor of Arts program with 13 graduates in 2017.

==Research==
CSUN has long been recognized as a major supplier of PhD students by the National Science Foundation. The university ranked fifth in the number of undergraduate students who went on to earn a PhD in the category of master&#x27;s colleges and universities in the 1999–2003 time frame (with a total of 264 alumni went on to earn a PhD in this time frame). The other universities in the top 5 of this category, with the exception of the James Madison University at fourth place, were also California State Universities. This trend has persisted in more recent years, with CSUN ranking 4th in this category in 2018 (with a total of 65 alumni who obtained a PhD in that year) and 9th in 2022 (with a total of 43 alumni who obtained a PhD in that year).
As a result, alumni have become professors at Ivy League institutions (including professor of economics and public affairs Mark Watson at Princeton University, associate professor of surgery Michael F. Daily at Dartmouth College, and associate professor of services marketing Robert Kwortnik at Cornell University) as well as various Public and Hidden Ivies, and other prominent institutions like New York University.

CSUN also has a high amount of research activity for a master&#x27;s level university. Since 2015, CSUN receives around $35 million annually in research funding from over 210 awards each year. For the most recent fiscal year of 2024, CSUN received funding of around $45 million from 230 grants. The College of Math and Science at CSUN is the biggest recipient of grant money, with around $11.4 million in funding in fiscal year 2024. Its faculty are published in numerous articles in peer-reviewed journals each year.

To support research activities for both faculty and students, CSUN built a research facility. Half of this building, named Lilac Hall, is currently occupied by The Health Equity Research &amp; Education (HERE) Center, which is funded by a $22 million NIH grant to support biomedical and health equity research at CSUN in the form of the BUILD PODER program; the other half of the building houses a laser lab containing femtosecond lasers to study energy flows and electric charges in nanomaterials, with the intention to design more efficient solar energy devices and nanomaterial-based photothermal therapy for cancer treatment. Another major research program at CSUN is the CSUN-UCLA Bridges to Stem Cell Research program. This ongoing collaboration allows undergraduate students to perform research in one of 50 stem cell research labs headed by UCLA faculty. CSUN has also been collaborating with the Princeton Center for Complex Materials at Princeton University since 2006. It is also a co-founder and partner institution of the Research Center for Translational Applications of Nanoscale Multiferroic Systems (TANMS), which was established at UCLA through an $18.5 million NSF grant in 2012. Other institutions involved at the center include Cornell University, University of California, Berkeley, ETH Zurich, University of Texas at Dallas and Northeastern University. In 2019, the university received $3 million from NASA to establish the NASA Autonomy Research Center for STEAHM. The interdisciplinary research center will comprehensively study increasingly autonomous (IA) systems, such as artificial intelligence and automation, through the collaboration between six of the university&#x27;s colleges, while also collaborating with researchers from NASA&#x27;s Armstrong Flight Research Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

CSUN is also home to the San Fernando Observatory. It has operated this observatory since 1976 and moved the observatory from its location in Sylmar to the campus in 2016. The observatory mainly functions as a solar observatory, and due to its decades long operation by CSUN, has allowed hundreds of students and faculty members to collect solar data. The photometric images from this facility are used to determine energy changes in the sun and the data collected by this observatory are used by researchers worldwide. The observatory, in combination with the Donald E. Bianchi Planetarium and the stellar (nighttime) observatory, form the only comprehensive astronomy network in the entire California State University system.

Additionally, over 70 CSUN Engineering and Computer Science students designed, built, programmed, and tested a CubeSat named CSUNSat1, which was funded by NASA&#x27;s Small Spacecraft Technology Partnership program. Its mission is to test a low temperature-capable energy storage system in space, developed by JPL, which will raise the technology readiness level of this storage system from 4 or 5 to 7. The success of this energy storage system will enable future space missions and scientific studies to conduct more experiments while requiring less energy, mass, and volume. The satellite was launched on 18 April 2017 as part of the ELaNa 17 mission by NASA on the Cygnus CRS OA-7 from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral to the ISS. The satellite was deployed by NanoRacks on May 17, 2017, and the nominal and cold temperature experiments were completed on June 18, 2017. The satellite is still operational and proceeding with its mission operations.

Various faculty members have been awarded prestigious Guggenheim Fellowships for research and creative activity, while over 50 have won Fulbright awards to conduct research or teach abroad. Recipients of the Guggenheim Fellowships have included Kim Victoria Abeles, Judy Baca, and Sabina Magliocco.

<doc id="81644" wikidata="Q1974087" url="?curid=81644" title="Removable singularity">
<text>In complex analysis, a removable singularity of a holomorphic function is a point at which the function is undefined, but it is possible to redefine the function at that point in such a way that the resulting function is regular in a neighbourhood of that point.

For instance, the (unnormalized) sinc function, as defined by
:formula_1
has a singularity at . This singularity can be removed by defining formula_2 which is the limit of as tends to 0. The resulting function is holomorphic. In this case the problem was caused by being given an indeterminate form. Taking a power series expansion for formula_3 around the singular point shows that
:formula_4

Formally, if formula_5 is an open subset of the complex plane formula_6, formula_7 a point of formula_8, and formula_9 is a holomorphic function, then formula_10 is called a removable singularity for formula_11 if there exists a holomorphic function formula_12 which coincides with formula_11 on formula_14. We say formula_11 is holomorphically extendable over formula_8 if such a formula_17 exists.

== Riemann&#x27;s theorem ==

Riemann&#x27;s theorem on removable singularities is as follows:

The implications 1 ⇒ 2 ⇒ 3 ⇒ 4 are trivial. To prove 4 ⇒ 1, we first recall that the holomorphy of a function at formula_10 is equivalent to it being analytic at formula_10 (proof), i.e. having a power series representation. Define

:formula_20

Clearly, &quot;h&quot; is holomorphic on formula_21, and there exists
:formula_22
by 4, hence &quot;h&quot; is holomorphic on &quot;D&quot; and has a Taylor series about &quot;a&quot;:

:formula_23

We have &quot;c&quot;0 = &quot;h&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = 0 and &quot;c&quot;1 = &quot;h″&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = 0; therefore

:formula_24

Hence, where formula_25, we have:

:formula_26

However,

:formula_27

is holomorphic on &quot;D&quot;, thus an extension of formula_28.

== Other kinds of singularities ==

Unlike functions of a real variable, holomorphic functions are sufficiently rigid that their isolated singularities can be completely classified. A holomorphic function&#x27;s singularity is either not really a singularity at all, i.e. a removable singularity, or one of the following two types:

#In light of Riemann&#x27;s theorem, given a non-removable singularity, one might ask whether there exists a natural number formula_29 such that formula_30. If so, formula_10 is called a pole of formula_11 and the smallest such formula_29 is the order of formula_10. So removable singularities are precisely the poles of order 0. A holomorphic function blows up uniformly near its other poles.
#If an isolated singularity formula_10 of formula_11 is neither removable nor a pole, it is called an essential singularity. The Great Picard Theorem shows that such an formula_11 maps every punctured open neighborhood formula_38 to the entire complex plane, with the possible exception of at most one point.

<doc id="81646" wikidata="Q1060611" url="?curid=81646" title="Thinking Machines Corporation">
<text>Thinking Machines Corporation was a supercomputer manufacturer and artificial intelligence (AI) company, founded in Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1983 by Sheryl Handler and W. Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Hillis to turn Hillis&#x27;s doctoral work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on massively parallel computing architectures into a commercial product named the Connection Machine. The company moved in 1984 from Waltham to Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, close to the MIT AI Lab. Thinking Machines made some of the most powerful supercomputers of the time, and by 1993 the four fastest computers in the world were Connection Machines. The firm filed for bankruptcy in 1994; its hardware and parallel computing software divisions were acquired in time by Sun Microsystems.

==Supercomputer products==
On the hardware side, Thinking Machines produced several Connection Machine models (in chronological order): the CM-1, CM-2, CM-200, CM-5, and CM-5E. The CM-1 and 2 came first in models with 64K (65,536) bit-serial processors (16 processors per chip) and later, the smaller 16K and 4K configurations. The Connection Machine was programmed in a variety of specialized programming languages, including *Lisp and CM Lisp (derived from Common Lisp), C* (derived by Thinking Machines from C), and CM Fortran. These languages used proprietary compilers to translate code into the parallel instruction set of the Connection Machine. The CM-1 through CM-200 were examples of &quot;single instruction, multiple data&quot; (SIMD) architecture using a hypercube interconnect to reduce hop-count and latency, while the later CM-5 and CM-5E were &quot;multiple instruction, multiple data&quot; (MIMD) that combined commodity SPARC processors and proprietary vector processors in a &quot;fat tree&quot; computer network.

All Connection Machine models required a serial front-end processor, which was most often a Sun Microsystems workstation, but on early models could also be a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX minicomputer or Symbolics Lisp machine.

Thinking Machines also introduced an early commercial &quot;redundant array of independent disks&quot; (RAID) 2 disk array, the DataVault, circa 1988.


==Business history==

In May 1985, Thinking Machines became the third company to register a .com domain name (think.com). The company became profitable in 1989, in part because of its contracts from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The next year, they sold $65 million (USD) worth of hardware and software, making them the market leader in parallel supercomputers. Thinking Machines&#x27; primary supercomputer competitor was Cray Research. Other parallel computing competitors included nCUBE, nearby Kendall Square Research, and MasPar, which made a computer similar to the CM-2, and Meiko Scientific, whose CS-2 was similar to the CM-5. In 1991, DARPA and the United States Department of Energy reduced their purchases amid criticism they were unfairly favoring Thinking Machines at the expense of Cray, nCUBE, and MasPar. Tightening export laws also prevented the most powerful Connection Machines from being exported. By 1992, the company was losing money, and CEO Sheryl Handler was forced out.

In August 1994, Thinking Machines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The hardware portion of the company was purchased by Sun Microsystems, and TMC re-emerged as a small software company specializing in parallel software tools for commodity clusters and data mining software for its installed base and former competitors&#x27; parallel supercomputers. In December 1996, the parallel software development section was also acquired by Sun Microsystems.

Thinking Machines continued as a pure data mining company until it was acquired in 1999 by Oracle Corporation. Oracle later acquired Sun Microsystems, thus re-uniting much of Thinking Machines&#x27; intellectual property.

The program &quot;wide area information server&quot; (WAIS), developed at Thinking Machines by Brewster Kahle, would later be influential in starting the Internet Archive and associated projects, including the Rosetta Project as part of Danny Hillis&#x27; Clock of the Long Now.

Architect Greg Papadopoulos later became Sun Microsystems&#x27;s chief technology officer (CTO).

==Dispersal==
Many of the hardware people left for Sun Microsystems and went on to design the Sun Enterprise series of parallel computers. The &quot;Darwin&quot; data mining toolkit, developed by Thinking Machines&#x27; Business Supercomputer Group, was purchased by Oracle. Most of the team that built &quot;Darwin&quot; had already left for Dun &amp; Bradstreet soon after Thinking Machines Corporation entered bankruptcy in 1994.

Thinking Machines alumni (known as &quot;Thunkos&quot;) helped create several parallel computing software start-ups, including Ab Initio Software; and Applied Parallel Technologies, which was later renamed Torrent Systems and acquired by Ascential Software, which was in turn acquired by IBM.

Besides Hillis, other noted people who worked for or with the company included Robert Millstein, Greg Papadopoulos, David Waltz, Guy L. Steele Jr., Karl Sims, Brewster Kahle, Bradley Kuszmaul, Carl Feynman, Cliff Lasser, Marvin Denicoff, Alex Vasilevsky, Allan Torres, Richard Fishman, Mirza Mehdi, Alan Harshman, Richard Jordan, Alan Mercer, James Bailey, Tsutomu Shimomura. Among the early corporate fellows of Thinking Machines were Marvin Minsky, Douglas Lenat, Stephen Wolfram, Tomaso Poggio, Richard Feynman, and Jack Schwartz, later joined by Charles E. Leiserson, Alan Edelman, Eric Lander, and Lennart Johnsson.

DARPA&#x27;s Connection Machines were decommissioned by 1996.

== References in popular culture ==
In the 1993 film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, Connection Machines (non-functioning dummies) are visible in the park&#x27;s control room, programmer Dennis Nedry mentions &quot;eight Connection Machines&quot; and a video about dinosaur cloning mentions &quot;Thinking Machines supercomputers&quot;.

In the 1996 film &quot;&quot;, Luther Stickell asks Franz Krieger for &quot;Thinking Machine laptops&quot; to help hack into the CIA&#x27;s Langley supercomputer.

Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; speaks of the NSA&#x27;s &quot;star machine from a company gone bankrupt, the Super-Connector from Thinking Machines, Inc., of Cambridge, Massachusetts&quot; in the NSA&#x27;s basement. In addition, in &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; says the National Security Agency could crack nearly any book or cipher with one of three custom operating systems designed for a Thinking Machines supercomputer.

In the 2008 video game &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, it is mentioned that the pre-war firm that made the computer systems for Vaults is called Think Machine.

<doc id="81648" wikidata="Q312229" url="?curid=81648" title="Lipoic acid">
<text>Lipoic acid (LA), also known as α-lipoic acid, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and thioctic acid, is an organosulfur compound derived from caprylic acid (octanoic acid). ALA, which is made in animals normally, is essential for aerobic metabolism. It is also available as a dietary supplement or pharmaceutical drug in some countries. Lipoate is the conjugate base of lipoic acid, and the most prevalent form of LA under physiological conditions. Only the (&quot;R&quot;)-(+)-enantiomer (RLA) exists in nature. RLA is an essential cofactor of many processes.

==Physical and chemical properties==
Lipoic acid contains two sulfur atoms connected by a disulfide bond in the 1,2-dithiolane ring. It also carries a carboxylic acid group. It is considered to be oxidized relative to its acyclic relative dihydrolipoic acid, in which each sulfur exists as a thiol. It is a yellow solid.

(&quot;R&quot;)-(+)-lipoic acid (RLA) occurs naturally, but (&quot;S&quot;)-(-)-lipoic acid (SLA) has been synthesized.

For use in dietary supplement materials and compounding pharmacies, the USP established an official monograph for R/S-LA.

==Biological function==
Lipoic acid is a cofactor for five enzymes or classes of enzymes: pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, the glycine cleavage system, branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase, and the α-oxo(keto)adipate dehydrogenase. The first two are critical to the citric acid cycle. The GCS regulates glycine concentrations.

HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC6, HDAC8, and HDAC10 are targets of the reduced form (open dithiol) of (&quot;R&quot;)-lipoic acid. 

===Biosynthesis and attachment===
Most endogenously produced RLA are not &quot;free&quot; because octanoic acid, the precursor to RLA, is bound to the enzyme complexes prior to enzymatic insertion of the sulfur atoms. As a cofactor, RLA is covalently attached by an amide bond to a terminal lysine residue of the enzyme&#x27;s lipoyl domains.
The precursor to lipoic acid, octanoic acid, is made via fatty acid biosynthesis in the form of octanoyl-acyl carrier protein. In eukaryotes, a second fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in mitochondria is used for this purpose. The octanoate is transferred as a thioester of acyl carrier protein from fatty acid biosynthesis to an amide of the lipoyl domain protein by an enzyme called an octanoyltransferase. Two hydrogens of octanoate are replaced with sulfur groups via a radical SAM mechanism, by lipoyl synthase. As a result, lipoic acid is synthesized attached to proteins and no free lipoic acid is produced. Lipoic acid can be removed whenever proteins are degraded and by action of the enzyme lipoamidase. Free lipoate can be used by some organisms as an enzyme called lipoate protein ligase that attaches it covalently to the correct protein. The ligase activity of this enzyme requires ATP.

===Cellular transport===

Along with sodium and the vitamins biotin (B7) and pantothenic acid (B5), lipoic acid enters cells through the SMVT (sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter). Each of the compounds transported by the SMVT is competitive with the others. For example research has shown that increasing intake of lipoic acid or pantothenic acid reduces the uptake of biotin and/or the activities of biotin-dependent enzymes.

===Enzymatic activity===
Lipoic acid is a cofactor for at least five enzyme systems. Two of these are in the citric acid cycle through which many organisms turn nutrients into energy. Lipoylated enzymes have lipoic acid attached to them covalently. The lipoyl group transfers acyl groups in 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes, and methylamine group in the glycine cleavage complex or glycine dehydrogenase.

Lipoic acid is the cofactor of the following enzymes in humans:

The most-studied of these is the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. These complexes have three central subunits: E1-3, which are the decarboxylase, lipoyl transferase, and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, respectively. These complexes have a central E2 core and the other subunits surround this core to form the complex. In the gap between these two subunits, the lipoyl domain ferries intermediates between the active sites. The lipoyl domain itself is attached by a flexible linker to the E2 core and the number of lipoyl domains varies from one to three for a given organism. The number of domains has been experimentally varied and seems to have little effect on growth until over nine are added, although more than three decreased activity of the complex.

Lipoic acid serves as co-factor to the acetoin dehydrogenase complex catalyzing the conversion of acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone) to acetaldehyde and acetyl coenzyme A.

The glycine cleavage system differs from the other complexes, and has a different nomenclature. In this system, the H protein is a free lipoyl domain with additional helices, the L protein is a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, the P protein is the decarboxylase, and the T protein transfers the methylamine from lipoate to tetrahydrofolate (THF) yielding methylene-THF and ammonia. Methylene-THF is then used by serine hydroxymethyltransferase to synthesize serine from glycine. This system is part of plant photorespiration.

===Biological sources and degradation===
Lipoic acid is present in many foods in which it is bound to lysine in proteins, but slightly more so in kidney, heart, liver, spinach, broccoli, and yeast extract. Naturally occurring lipoic acid is always covalently bound and not readily available from dietary sources. In addition, the amount of lipoic acid present in dietary sources is low. For instance, the purification of lipoic acid to determine its structure used an estimated 10 tons of liver residue, which yielded 30 mg of lipoic acid. As a result, all lipoic acid available as a supplement is chemically synthesized.

Baseline levels (prior to supplementation) of RLA and R-DHLA have not been detected in human plasma. RLA has been detected at 12.3−43.1 ng/mL following acid hydrolysis, which releases protein-bound lipoic acid. Enzymatic hydrolysis of protein bound lipoic acid released 1.4−11.6 ng/mL and &lt;1-38.2 ng/mL using subtilisin and alcalase, respectively.

Digestive proteolytic enzymes cleave the R-lipoyllysine residue from the mitochondrial enzyme complexes derived from food but are unable to cleave the lipoic acid--lysine amide bond. Both synthetic lipoamide and (&quot;R&quot;)-lipoyl--lysine are rapidly cleaved by serum lipoamidases, which release free (&quot;R&quot;)-lipoic acid and either -lysine or ammonia. Little is known about the degradation and utilization of aliphatic sulfides such as lipoic acid, except for cysteine.

Lipoic acid is metabolized in a variety of ways when given as a dietary supplement in mammals. Degradation to tetranorlipoic acid, oxidation of one or both of the sulfur atoms to the sulfoxide, and S-methylation of the sulfide were observed. Conjugation of unmodified lipoic acid to glycine was detected especially in mice. Degradation of lipoic acid is similar in humans, although it is not clear if the sulfur atoms become significantly oxidized. Apparently mammals are not capable of utilizing lipoic acid as a sulfur source.

== Diseases ==

=== Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) ===
In the metabolic disease combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) due to ACSF3 deficiency, mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFASII), which is the precursor reaction of lipoic acid biosynthesis, is impaired. The result is a reduced lipoylation degree of important mitochondrial enzymes, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (α-KGDHC). Supplementation with lipoic acid does not restore mitochondrial function.

==Chemical synthesis==

SLA did not exist prior to chemical synthesis in 1952. SLA is produced in equal amounts with RLA during achiral manufacturing processes. The racemic form was more widely used clinically in Europe and Japan in the 1950s to 1960s despite the early recognition that the various forms of LA are not bioequivalent. The first synthetic procedures appeared for RLA and SLA in the mid-1950s. Advances in chiral chemistry led to more efficient technologies for manufacturing the single enantiomers by both classical resolution and asymmetric synthesis and the demand for RLA also grew at this time. In the 21st century, R/S-LA, RLA and SLA with high chemical and/or optical purities are available in industrial quantities. At the current time, most of the world supply of R/S-LA and RLA is manufactured in China and smaller amounts in Italy, Germany, and Japan. RLA is produced by modifications of a process first described by Georg Lang in a Ph.D. thesis and later patented by DeGussa. Although RLA is favored nutritionally due to its &quot;vitamin-like&quot; role in metabolism, both RLA and R/S-LA are widely available as dietary supplements. Both stereospecific and non-stereospecific reactions are known to occur &quot;in vivo&quot; and contribute to the mechanisms of action, but evidence to date indicates RLA may be the eutomer (the nutritionally and therapeutically preferred form).

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacokinetics===
A 2007 human pharmacokinetic study of sodium RLA demonstrated the maximum concentration in plasma and bioavailability are significantly greater than the free acid form, and rivals plasma levels achieved by intravenous administration of the free acid form. Additionally, high plasma levels comparable to those in animal models where Nrf2 was activated were achieved.

The various forms of LA are not bioequivalent. Very few studies compare individual enantiomers with racemic lipoic acid. It is unclear if twice as much racemic lipoic acid can replace RLA.

The toxic dose of LA in cats is much lower than that in humans or dogs and produces hepatocellular toxicity.

===Pharmacodynamics===
The mechanism and action of lipoic acid when supplied externally to an organism is controversial. Lipoic acid in a cell seems primarily to induce the oxidative stress response rather than directly scavenge free radicals. This effect is specific for RLA. Despite the strongly reducing milieu, LA has been detected intracellularly in both oxidized and reduced forms. LA is able to scavenge reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species in a biochemical assay due to long incubation times, but there is little evidence this occurs within a cell or that radical scavenging contributes to the primary mechanisms of action of LA. The relatively good scavenging activity of LA toward hypochlorous acid (a bactericidal produced by neutrophils that may produce inflammation and tissue damage) is due to the strained conformation of the 5-membered dithiolane ring, which is lost upon reduction to DHLA. In cells, LA is reduced to dihydrolipoic acid, which is generally regarded as the more bioactive form of LA and the form responsible for most of the antioxidant effects and for lowering the redox activities of unbound iron and copper. This theory has been challenged due to the high level of reactivity of the two free sulfhydryls, low intracellular concentrations of DHLA as well as the rapid methylation of one or both sulfhydryls, rapid side-chain oxidation to shorter metabolites and rapid efflux from the cell. Although both DHLA and LA have been found inside cells after administration, most intracellular DHLA probably exists as mixed disulfides with various cysteine residues from cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins. Recent findings suggest therapeutic and anti-aging effects are due to modulation of signal transduction and gene transcription, which improve the antioxidant status of the cell. However, this likely occurs via pro-oxidant mechanisms, not by radical scavenging or reducing effects.

All the disulfide forms of LA (R/S-LA, RLA and SLA) can be reduced to DHLA although both tissue specific and stereoselective (preference for one enantiomer over the other) reductions have been reported in model systems. At least two cytosolic enzymes, glutathione reductase (GR) and thioredoxin reductase (Trx1), and two mitochondrial enzymes, lipoamide dehydrogenase and thioredoxin reductase (Trx2), reduce LA. SLA is stereoselectively reduced by cytosolic GR whereas Trx1, Trx2 and lipoamide dehydrogenase stereoselectively reduce RLA. (&quot;R&quot;)-(+)-lipoic acid is enzymatically or chemically reduced to (&quot;R&quot;)-(-)-dihydrolipoic acid whereas (&quot;S&quot;)-(-)-lipoic acid is reduced to (&quot;S&quot;)-(+)-dihydrolipoic acid. Dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) can also form intracellularly and extracellularly via non-enzymatic, thiol-disulfide exchange reactions.

RLA may function &quot;in vivo&quot; like a B-vitamin and at higher doses like plant-derived nutrients, such as curcumin, sulforaphane, resveratrol, and other nutritional substances that induce phase II detoxification enzymes, thus acting as cytoprotective agents. This stress response indirectly improves the antioxidant capacity of the cell.

The (&quot;S&quot;)-enantiomer of LA was shown to be toxic when administered to thiamine-deficient rats.

Several studies have demonstrated that SLA either has lower activity than RLA or interferes with the specific effects of RLA by competitive inhibition.

==Uses==
R/S-LA and RLA are widely available as over-the-counter nutritional supplements in the United States in the form of capsules, tablets, and aqueous liquids, and have been marketed as antioxidants and pertaining to cellular glucose utilization for metabolic disorders and type 2 diabetes.

Although the body can synthesize LA, it can also be absorbed from the diet. Dietary supplementation in doses from 200–600 mg is likely to provide up to 1000 times the amount available from a regular diet. Gastrointestinal absorption is variable and decreases with the use of food. It is therefore recommended that dietary LA be taken 30–60 minutes before or at least 120 minutes after a meal. Maximum blood levels of LA are achieved 30–60 minutes after dietary supplementation, and it is thought to be largely metabolized in the liver.

In Germany, LA is approved as a drug for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy since 1966 and is available as a non-prescription pharmaceutical.

==Clinical research==
According to the American Cancer Society as of 2013, &quot;there is no reliable scientific evidence at this time that lipoic acid prevents the development or spread of cancer&quot;. As of 2015, intravenously administered ALA is unapproved anywhere in the world except Germany for diabetic neuropathy, but has been proven reasonably safe and effective. As of 2012, there was no good evidence alpha lipoic acid helps people with mitochondrial disorders. A 2018 review recommended ALA as an anti-obesity supplement with low dosage (&lt; 600 mg/day) for a short period (&lt;10 weeks).

<doc id="81659" wikidata="Q412547" url="?curid=81659" title="Dehydrogenase">
<text>A dehydrogenase is an enzyme belonging to the group of oxidoreductases that oxidizes a substrate by reducing an electron acceptor, usually NAD+/NADP+ or a flavin coenzyme such as FAD or FMN. Like all catalysts, they catalyze reverse as well as forward reactions, and in some cases this has physiological significance: for example, alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde in animals, but in yeast it catalyzes the production of ethanol from acetaldehyde.

== IUBMB Classification ==
Oxidoreductases, enzymes that catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions, constitute Class EC 1 of the IUBMB classification of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Any of these may be called dehydrogenases, especially those in which NAD+ is the electron acceptor (oxidant), but reductase is also used when the physiological emphasis on reduction of the substrate, and oxidase is used &quot;only&quot; when O2 is the electron acceptor. The systematic name of an oxidoreductase is &quot;donor:acceptor oxidoreductase&quot;, but, when possible, it is more conveniently named as &quot;donor dehydrogenase&quot;.

== Reactions catalyzed ==

Dehydrogenases oxidize a substrate by transferring hydrogen to an electron acceptor, common electron acceptors being NAD+ or FAD. This would be considered an oxidation of the substrate, in which the substrate either loses hydrogen atoms or gains an oxygen atom (from water). The name &quot;dehydrogenase&quot; is based on the idea that it facilitates the removal (de-) of hydrogen (-hydrogen-) and is an enzyme (-ase). Dehydrogenase reactions come most commonly in two forms: the transfer of a hydride and release of a proton (often with water as a second reactant), and the transfer of two hydrogens.

=== Transferring a hydride and releasing a proton ===
Sometimes a dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction will look like this: AH + B+ ↔ A+ + BH when a hydride is transferred. A represents the substrate that will be oxidized, while B is the hydride acceptor. Note how when the hydride is transferred from A to B, the A has taken on a positive charge; this is because the enzyme has taken two electrons from the substrate in order to reduce the acceptor to BH.

The result of a dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction is not always the acquisition of a positive charge. Sometimes the substrate loses a proton. This may leave free electrons on the substrate that move into a double bond. This happens frequently when an alcohol is the substrate; when the proton on the oxygen leaves, the free electrons on the oxygen will be used to create a double bond, as seen in the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde carried out by alcohol dehydrogenase in the image on the right.

Another possibility is that a water molecule will enter the reaction, contributing a hydroxide ion to the substrate and a proton to the environment. The net result on the substrate is the addition of one oxygen atom. This is seen for example in the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, a step in the metabolism of ethanol and in the production of vinegar.

=== Transferring two hydrogens ===

In the above case, the dehydrogenase has transferred a hydride while releasing a proton, H+, but dehydrogenases can also transfer two hydrogens, using FAD as an electron acceptor. This would be depicted as AH2 + B ↔ A + BH2.
A double bond is normally formed in between the two atoms that the hydrogens were taken from, as in the case of succinate dehydrogenase. The two hydrogens have been transferred to the carrier or the other product, with their electrons.

=== Identifying a dehydrogenase reaction ===
The distinction between the subclasses of oxidoreductases that catalyze oxidation reactions lies in their electron acceptors.

Dehydrogenase and oxidase are easily distinguishable if one considers the electron acceptor. An oxidase will remove electrons from a substrate as well, but only uses oxygen as its electron acceptor. One such reaction is: AH2 + O2 ↔ A + H2O2.

Sometimes an oxidase reaction will look like this: 4A + 4H+ + O2 ↔ 4A+ + 2H2O. In this case, the enzyme is taking electrons from the substrate, and using free protons to reduce the oxygen, leaving the substrate with a positive charge. The product is water, instead of hydrogen peroxide as seen above. An example of an oxidase that functions like this is complex IV in the Electron Transport Chain (ETC).

Note that oxidases typically transfer the equivalent of dihydrogen (H2), and the acceptor is a dioxygen. Similarly, a peroxidase (another subclass of oxidoreductases) will use a peroxide (H2O2) as the electron acceptor, rather than an oxygen.

== Electron acceptors ==

Dehydrogenase enzymes transfer electrons from the substrate to an electron carrier; what carrier is used depends on the reaction taking place. Common electron acceptors used by this subclass are NAD+, FAD, and NADP+. Electron carriers are reduced in this process and considered oxidizers of the substrate. Electron carriers are coenzymes that are often referred to as &quot;redox cofactors.&quot;

=== NAD+ ===
NAD+, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, is a dinucleotide, containing two nucleotides. One of the nucleotides it contains is an adenine group, while the other is nicotinamide. In order to reduce this molecule, a hydrogen and two electrons must be added to the 6-carbon ring of nicotinamide; one electron is added to the carbon opposite the positively charged nitrogen, causing a rearrangement of bonds within the ring to give nitrogen more electrons; it will lose its positive charge as a result. The other electron is &quot;stolen&quot; from an additional hydrogen, leaving the hydrogen ion in solution. Reduction of NAD+: NAD+ + 2H+ + 2e− ↔ NADH + H+NAD+ is mostly used in catabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, that break down energy molecules to produce ATP. The ratio of NAD+ to NADH is kept very high in the cell, keeping it readily available to act as an oxidizing agent. 
=== NADP+ ===
NADP+ differs from NAD+ only in the addition of a phosphate group to the adenosine 5-membered carbon ring. The addition of the phosphate does not alter the electron transport abilities of the carrier. The phosphate group creates enough contrast between the two groups that they bind to the active site of different enzymes, generally catalyzing different types of reactions.

These two electron carriers are easily distinguished by enzymes and participate in very different reactions. NADP+ mainly functions with enzymes that catalyze anabolic, or biosynthetic, pathways. Specifically, NADPH will act as a reducing agent in these reactions, resulting in NADP+. These are pathways that convert substrates to more complicated products, using ATP. The reasoning behind having two separate electron carriers for anabolic and catabolic pathways relates to regulation of metabolism.
The ratio of NADP+ to NADPH in the cell is kept rather low, so that NADPH is readily available as a reducing agent; it is more commonly used as a reducing agent than NADP+ is used as an oxidizing agent.

=== FAD ===

FAD, or flavin adenine dinucleotide, is a prosthetic group (a non-polypeptide unit bound to a protein that is required for function) that consists of an adenine nucleotide and a flavin mononucleotide. FAD is a unique electron acceptor. Its fully reduced form is FADH2 (known as the hydroquinone form), but FAD can also be partially oxidized as FADH by either reducing FAD or oxidizing FADH2. Dehydrogenases typically fully reduce FAD to FADH2. The production of FADH is rare.

The double-bonded nitrogen atoms in FAD make it a good acceptor in taking two hydrogen atoms from a substrate. Because it takes two atoms rather than one, FAD is often involved when a double bond is formed in the newly oxidized substrate. FAD is unique because it is reduced by two electrons &quot;and&quot; two protons, as opposed to both NAD+ and NADP, which only take one proton.

=== Biological implications ===

Aldehydes are the natural by-product of many physiological processes, as well as being the consequence of many industrial processes, put out into the environment in the form of smog and motor vehicle exhaust. Build-up of aldehydes in the brain and pericardium can be detrimental to a person&#x27;s health, as they can form adducts with important molecules and cause their inactivation.

Considering how prevalent aldehydes are, there must be an enzyme to facilitate their oxidation to a less volatile compound. Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) are NAD+ dependent enzymes that function to remove toxic aldehydes from the body, functioning mostly in the mitochondria of cells. These enzymes are largely responsible for the detoxification of acetylaldehyde, which is an intermediate in the metabolism of ethanol. It has been shown that a mutation in the ALDH2 gene (one of 19 aldehyde dehydrogenase genes) is what leads to the common occurrence in East Asian population of a flushed face after consuming alcohol, due to the build-up of acetaldehyde. This build-up of acetaldehyde also causes headaches and vomiting (hangover symptoms) if not broken down quickly enough, another reason why those with acetaldehyde DH deficiencies have bad reactions to alcohol. Importantly, a lack of this enzyme has been linked to an increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, while activation has shown the enzyme&#x27;s ability to reduce damage caused by ischaemia.

Deactivation of aldehyde dehydrogenases has been shown to be instrumental in the mechanisms of many cancers. ALDHs function in cell differentiation, proliferation, oxidation, and drug resistance. These enzymes are only one example of the many different types of dehydrogenases in the human body; their wide array of functions, and the impact that their deactivation or mutations has upon crucial cell processes underscores the importance of all dehydrogenases in maintaining body homeostasis.

<doc id="81660" wikidata="Q174337" url="?curid=81660" title="Flavin group">
<text>Flavins (from Latin &quot;flavus&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;) refers generally to the class of organic compounds containing the tricyclic heterocycle isoalloxazine or its isomer alloxazine, and derivatives thereof. The biochemical source of flavin is the yellow B vitamin riboflavin. The flavin moiety is often attached with an adenosine diphosphate to form [[flavin adenine dinucleotide]] (FAD), and, in other circumstances, is found as [[flavin mononucleotide]] (or FMN), a phosphorylated form of riboflavin. It is in one or the other of these forms that flavin is present as a prosthetic group in flavoproteins. Despite the similar names, flavins (with &quot;i&quot;) are chemically and biologically distinct from the flavanoids (with &quot;a&quot;), and the flavonols (with &quot;o&quot;).

The flavin group is capable of undergoing oxidation-reduction reactions, and can accept either one electron in a two-step process or two electrons at once. Reduction is made with the addition of hydrogen atoms to specific nitrogen atoms on the isoalloxazine ring system:
In aqueous solution, flavins are yellow-coloured when oxidized, taking a red colour in the semi-reduced anionic state or blue in the neutral (semiquinone) state, and colourless when totally reduced. The oxidized and reduced forms are in fast equilibrium with the semiquinone (radical) form, shifted against the formation of the radical:

::Flox + FlredH2 ⇌ FlH•

where Flox is the oxidized flavin, FlredH2 the reduced flavin (upon addition of two hydrogen atoms) and FlH• the semiquinone form (addition of one hydrogen atom).

In the form of FADH2, it is one of the cofactors that can transfer electrons to the electron transfer chain.

==Photoreduction==
Both free and protein-bound flavins are photoreducible, that is, able to be reduced by light, in a mechanism mediated by several organic compounds, such as some amino acids, carboxylic acids and amines. This property of flavins is exploited by various light-sensitive proteins. For example, the LOV domain, found in many species of plant, fungi and bacteria, undergoes a reversible, light-dependent structural change which involves the formation of a bond between a cysteine residue in its peptide sequence and a bound FMN.

==FAD==

Flavin adenine dinucleotide is a group bound to many enzymes including ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase, monoamine oxidase, D-amino acid oxidase, glucose oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and acyl CoA dehydrogenase.

==FADH/FADH2==
FADH and FADH2 are reduced forms of FAD. FADH2 is produced as a prosthetic group in succinate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in the citric acid cycle. In oxidative phosphorylation, two molecules of FADH2 typically yield 1.5 ATP each, or three ATP combined.

==FMN==

Flavin mononucleotide is a prosthetic group found in, among other proteins, NADH dehydrogenase, &quot;E.coli&quot; nitroreductase and old yellow enzyme.

<text>Pyruvic acid (CH3COCOOH) is the simplest of the alpha-keto acids, with a carboxylic acid and a ketone functional group. Pyruvate, the conjugate base, CH3COCOO−, is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways throughout the cell.

Pyruvic acid can be made from glucose through glycolysis, converted back to carbohydrates (such as glucose) via gluconeogenesis, or converted to fatty acids through a reaction with acetyl-CoA. It can also be used to construct the amino acid alanine and can be converted into ethanol or lactic acid via fermentation.

Pyruvic acid supplies energy to cells through the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle) when oxygen is present (aerobic respiration), and alternatively ferments to produce lactate when oxygen is lacking.

==Chemistry==
In 1834, Théophile-Jules Pelouze distilled tartaric acid and isolated glutaric acid and another unknown organic acid. Jöns Jacob Berzelius characterized this other acid the following year and named pyruvic acid because it was distilled using heat. The correct molecular structure was deduced by the 1870s. 

Pyruvic acid is a colorless liquid with a smell similar to that of acetic acid and is miscible with water. In the laboratory, pyruvic acid may be prepared by heating a mixture of tartaric acid and potassium hydrogen sulfate, by the oxidation of propylene glycol by a strong oxidizer (e.g., potassium permanganate or bleach), or by the hydrolysis of acetyl cyanide, formed by reaction of acetyl chloride with potassium cyanide:
:CH3COCl + KCN → CH3COCN + KCl
:CH3COCN → CH3COCOOH

==Biochemistry==

Pyruvate is an important chemical compound in biochemistry. It is the output of the metabolism of glucose known as glycolysis. One molecule of glucose breaks down into two molecules of pyruvate, which are then used to provide further energy, in one of two ways. Pyruvate is converted into acetyl-coenzyme A, which is the main input for a series of reactions known as the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle). Pyruvate is also converted to oxaloacetate by an anaplerotic reaction, which replenishes Krebs cycle intermediates; also, the oxaloacetate is used for gluconeogenesis.

These reactions are named after Hans Adolf Krebs, the biochemist awarded the 1953 Nobel Prize for physiology, jointly with Fritz Lipmann, for research into metabolic processes. The cycle is also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle, because citric acid is one of the intermediate compounds formed during the reactions.

If insufficient oxygen is available, the acid is broken down anaerobically, creating lactate in animals and ethanol in plants and microorganisms (and in carp). Pyruvate from glycolysis is converted by fermentation to lactate using the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase and the coenzyme NADH in lactate fermentation, or to acetaldehyde (with the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase) and then to ethanol in alcoholic fermentation.

Pyruvate is a key intersection in the network of metabolic pathways. Pyruvate can be converted into carbohydrates via gluconeogenesis, to fatty acids or energy through acetyl-CoA, to the amino acid alanine, and to ethanol. Therefore, it unites several key metabolic processes.

===Pyruvic acid production by glycolysis===
In the last step of glycolysis, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is converted to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase. This reaction is strongly exergonic and irreversible; in gluconeogenesis, it takes two enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and PEP carboxykinase, to catalyze the reverse transformation of pyruvate to PEP.

===Decarboxylation to acetyl CoA===
Pyruvate decarboxylation by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex produces acetyl-CoA.
===Carboxylation to oxaloacetate===
Carboxylation by pyruvate carboxylase produces oxaloacetate.
===Transamination to alanine===
Transamination by alanine transaminase produces alanine.
===Reduction to lactate===
Reduction by lactate dehydrogenase produces lactate.
=== Environmental chemistry ===
Pyruvic acid is an abundant carboxylic acid in secondary organic aerosols.

==Uses==
Pyruvate is sold as a weight-loss supplement, though credible science has yet to back this claim. A systematic review of six trials found a statistically significant difference in body weight with pyruvate compared to placebo. However, all of the trials had methodological weaknesses and the magnitude of the effect was small. The review also identified adverse events associated with pyruvate such as diarrhea, bloating, gas, and increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the use of pyruvate for weight loss.

There is also &quot;in vitro&quot; as well as &quot;in vivo&quot; evidence in hearts that pyruvate improves metabolism by NADH production stimulation and increases cardiac function.

<doc id="81668" wikidata="Q409692" url="?curid=81668" title="Acetoacetic acid">
<text>Acetoacetic acid (IUPAC name: 3-oxobutanoic acid, also known as acetonecarboxylic acid or diacetic acid) is the organic compound with the formula CH3COCH2COOH. It is the simplest beta-keto acid, and like other members of this class, it is unstable. The methyl and ethyl esters, which are quite stable, are produced on a large scale industrially as precursors to dyes. Acetoacetic acid is a weak acid.

==Biochemistry==
Under typical physiological conditions, acetoacetic acid exists as its conjugate base, acetoacetate:
Unbound acetoacetate is primarily produced by liver mitochondria from its thioester with coenzyme A (CoA): 
The acetoacetate-CoA itself is formed by three routes:
*3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA releases acetyl CoA and acetoacetate:
*Acetoacetyl-CoA can come from beta oxidation of butyryl-CoA:
*Condensation of pair of acetyl CoA molecules as catalyzed by thiolase.

In mammals, acetoacetate produced in the liver (along with the other two &quot;ketone bodies&quot;) is released into the bloodstream as an energy source during periods of fasting, exercise, or as a result of type 1 diabetes mellitus. First, a CoA group is enzymatically transferred to it from succinyl CoA, converting it back to acetoacetyl CoA; this is then broken into two acetyl CoA molecules by thiolase, and these then enter the citric acid cycle. Heart muscle and renal cortex prefer acetoacetate over glucose. The brain uses acetoacetate when glucose levels are low due to fasting or diabetes.

== Synthesis and properties ==
Acetoacetic acid may be prepared by the hydrolysis of diketene. Its esters are produced analogously via reactions between diketene and alcohols, and acetoacetic acid can be prepared by the hydrolysis of these species.
In general, acetoacetic acid is generated at 0 °C and used in situ immediately.

It decomposes at a moderate reaction rate into acetone and carbon dioxide:
The acid form has a half-life of 140 minutes at 37 °C in water, whereas the basic form (the anion) has a half-life of 130 hours. That is, it reacts about 55 times more slowly. The corresponding decarboxylation of trifluoroacetoacetate is used to prepare trifluoroacetone:

It is a weak acid (like most alkyl carboxylic acids), with a p&quot;K&quot;a of 3.58.

Acetoacetic acid displays keto-enol tautomerisation, with the enol form being partially stabilised by extended conjugation and intramolecular H-bonding. The equilibrium is strongly solvent depended; with the keto form dominating in polar solvents (98% in water) and the enol form accounting for 25-49% of material in non-polar solvents.

==Applications==
Acetoacetic esters are used for the acetoacetylation reaction, which is widely used in the production of arylide yellows and diarylide dyes. Although the esters can be used in this reaction, diketene also reacts with alcohols and amines to the corresponding acetoacetic acid derivatives in a process called acetoacetylation. An example is the reaction with 4-aminoindane:

== Detection ==
Acetoacetic acid is measured in the urine of people with diabetes to test for ketoacidosis and for monitoring people on a ketogenic or low-carbohydrate diet. This is done using dipsticks coated in nitroprusside or similar reagents. Nitroprusside changes from pink to purple in the presence of acetoacetate, the conjugate base of acetoacetic acid, and the colour change is graded by eye. The test does not measure β-hydroxybutyrate, the most abundant ketone in the body; during treatment of ketoacidosis β-hydroxybutyrate is converted to acetoacetate so the test is not useful after treatment begins and may be falsely low at diagnosis.

Similar tests are used in dairy cows to test for ketosis.

<text>Claude Lorrain (; born Claude Gellée , called le Lorrain in French; traditionally just Claude in English; c. 1600 – 23 November 1682) was a French painter, draughtsman and etcher of the Baroque era. He spent most of his life in Italy, and is one of the earliest significant artists, aside from his contemporaries in Dutch Golden Age painting, to concentrate on landscape painting. His landscapes often transitioned into the more prestigious genre of history paintings by addition of a few small figures, typically representing a scene from the Bible or classical mythology.

By the end of the 1630s he was established as the leading landscapist in Italy, and enjoyed large fees for his work. His landscapes gradually became larger, but with fewer figures, more carefully painted, and produced at a lower rate. He was not generally an innovator in landscape painting, except in introducing the sun and streaming sunlight into many paintings, which had been rare before. He is now thought of as a French painter, but was born in the independent Duchy of Lorraine, and almost all his painting was done in Italy; before the late 19th century he was regarded as a painter of the &quot;Roman School&quot;. His patrons were also mostly Italian, but after his death he became very popular with English collectors, and the UK retains a high proportion of his works.
He was a prolific creator of drawings in pen and very often monochrome watercolour &quot;wash&quot;, usually brown but sometimes grey. Chalk is sometimes used for under-drawing, and white highlighting in various media may be employed, much less often other colours such as pink. These fall into three fairly distinct groups. Firstly, there are numerous sketches, mostly of landscapes, often created on-site; these have been greatly admired, and influenced other artists. Then there are studies for paintings, of various degrees of finish, many clearly done before or during the process of painting, while others were likely made after the painting was completed. This was certainly the case for the last group, the 195 drawings recording finished paintings collected in his &quot;Liber Veritatis&quot; (now in the British Museum). He produced over 40 etchings, often simplified versions of paintings, mainly before 1642. These served various purposes for him, but are now regarded as much less important than his drawings. He painted frescoes in his early career, which played an important part in making his reputation, but are now nearly all lost.

==Biography==


The earliest biographies of Claude are in Joachim von Sandrart&#x27;s &quot;Teutsche Academie&quot; (1675) and Filippo Baldinucci&#x27;s &quot;Notizie de&#x27; professori del disegno da Cimabue in qua&quot; (1682–1728). Both Sandrart and Baldinucci knew the painter personally, but at periods some 50 years apart, respectively at the start of his career and shortly before his death. Sandrart knew him well and lived with him for a while, whereas Baldinucci was probably not intimate with him, and derived much of his information from Claude&#x27;s nephew, who lived with the artist.

Claude&#x27;s tombstone gives 1600 as his year of birth, but contemporary sources indicate a later date, circa 1604 or 1605. He was born in the small village of Chamagne, Vosges, then part of the Duchy of Lorraine. He was the third of five sons of Jean Gellée and Anne Padose.

According to Baldinucci, Claude&#x27;s parents both died when he was twelve years old, and he then lived at Freiburg with an elder brother (Jean Gellée). Jean was an artist specializing in inlay work and taught Claude the rudiments of drawing. Claude then travelled to Italy, first working for in Naples, then joining the workshop of Agostino Tassi in Rome.

Sandrart&#x27;s account of Claude&#x27;s early years, however, is quite different, and modern scholars generally prefer this, or attempt to combine the two. According to Sandrart, Claude did not do well at the village school and was apprenticed to a pastry baker. With a company of fellow cooks and bakers (Lorraine had a high reputation for pâtisserie), Claude travelled to Rome and was eventually employed as a servant and cook by Tassi, who at some point converted him into an apprentice and taught him drawing and painting. Both Wals and Tassi were landscapists, the former very obscure and producing small works, while Tassi (known as the rapist of Artemisia Gentileschi) had a large workshop specializing in fresco schemes in palaces.

While the details of Claude&#x27;s pre-1620s life remain unclear, most modern scholars agree that he was apprenticed to Wals around 1620–1622, and to Tassi from circa 1622/23 to 1625. Finally, Baldinucci reports that in 1625 Claude undertook a voyage back to Lorraine to train with Claude Deruet, working on the backgrounds of a lost fresco scheme, but left his studio comparatively soon, in 1626 or 1627. He returned to Rome and settled in a house in the Via Margutta, near the Spanish Steps and Trinita dei Monti, remaining in that neighbourhood for the rest of his life.

On his travels, Claude briefly stayed in Marseille, Genoa, and Venice, and had the opportunity to study nature in France, Italy, and Bavaria. Sandrart met Claude in the late 1620s and reported that by then the artist had a habit of sketching outdoors, particularly at dawn and at dusk, making oil studies on the spot. The first dated painting by Claude, &quot;Landscape with Cattle and Peasants&quot; (Philadelphia Museum of Art) from 1629, already shows well-developed style and technique. In the next few years his reputation was growing steadily, as evidenced by commissions from the French ambassador in Rome (1633) and the King of Spain (1634–35). Baldinucci reported that a particularly important commission came from Cardinal Bentivoglio, who was impressed by the two landscapes Claude painted for him, and recommended the artist to Pope Urban VIII. Four paintings were made for the Pope in 1635–1638, two large and two small on copper.

From this point, Claude&#x27;s reputation was secured. He went on to fulfill many important commissions, both Italian and international. About 1636 he started cataloguing his works, making pen and wash drawings of nearly all his pictures as they were completed, although not always variant versions, and on the back of most drawings he wrote the name of the purchaser, not always sufficiently clearly to identify them now. This volume Claude named the &quot;Liber Veritatis&quot; (Book of Truth).

In 1650, Claude moved to a neighboring house in Via Paolina (today Via del Babuino), where he lived until his death. The artist never married, but adopted an orphan child, Agnese, in 1658; she may well have been Claude&#x27;s own daughter with a servant of the same name. Sons of Claude&#x27;s brothers joined the household in 1662 (Jean, son of Denis Gellée) and around 1680 (Joseph, son of Melchior Gellée). In 1663 Claude, who suffered much from gout, fell seriously ill, his condition becoming so serious that he drafted a will, but he managed to recover. He painted less after 1670, but works completed after that date include important pictures such as &quot;Coast View with Perseus and the Origin of Coral&quot; (1674), painted for the celebrated collector Cardinal Camillo Massimo, and &quot;Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia&quot;, Claude&#x27;s last painting, commissioned by Prince Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna, his most important patron in his last years. The artist died in his house on 23 November 1682. He was originally buried in Trinita dei Monti, but his remains were moved in 1840 to San Luigi dei Francesi.

At his death, he owned only four of his paintings, but most of his drawings. Apart from the &quot;Liber Veritatis&quot; many of these were in bound volumes, the inventory mentioning 12 bound books and a large &quot;case&quot; or folder of loose sheets. Five or six large bound volumes were left to his heirs including a &quot;Tivoli Book&quot;, &quot;Campagna Book&quot;, &quot;Early Sketchbook&quot;, and an &quot;animal album&quot;, all now broken up and dispersed, though as the sheets were numbered their contents have been largely reconstructed by scholars.

==Style and subjects==
===Influences===
Claude&#x27;s choice of both style and subject matter grew out of a tradition of landscape painting in Italy, mostly Rome, led by northern artists trained in the style of Northern Mannerism. Matthijs Bril had arrived in Rome from Antwerp around 1575, and was soon joined by his brother Paul. Both specialized in landscapes, initially as backgrounds in large frescos, a route apparently also taken by Lorrain some decades later. Matthijs died at 33 but Paul remained active in Rome until after Claude&#x27;s arrival there, although any meeting between them has not been recorded. Hans Rottenhammer and Adam Elsheimer were other northern landscapists associated with Bril, who had left Rome long before.

These artists introduced the genre of small cabinet pictures, often on copper, where the figures were dominated by their landscape surroundings, which were very often dense woodland placed not far behind figures in the foreground. Paul Bril had begun to paint larger pictures where the size and balance between the elements, and the type of landscape used, is closer to Claude&#x27;s work in the future, with an extensive open view behind much of the width of the picture.

Along with other seventeenth-century artists working in Rome, Claude was also influenced by the new interest in the genre of landscape that emerged in the mid-to-late sixteenth century within the Veneto; starting with the Venetian born painter Domenico Campagnola and the Dutch artist resident in both Padua and Venice, Lambert Sustris. Interest in landscape first emerged in Rome in the work of their Brescian pupil Girolamo Muziano, who earned the nickname in the city of Il giovane dei paesi (the young man of the landscapes). Following the integration of this tradition with other Northern sources, Bolognese artists such as Domenichino, who was in Rome from 1602, painted a number of &quot;Landscape with...&quot; subjects, drawn from mythology, religion and literature, as well as genre scenes. These usually have an open vista in one part of the composition, as well as a steep hill in another. Even when the action between the few small figures is violent, the landscape gives an impression of serenity. The compositions are careful and balanced, and look forward to Claude&#x27;s. The &quot;Landscape with the Flight into Egypt&quot; by Annibale Carracci (c. 1604) is one of the best Italian landscapes of the start of the century, but perhaps more a forerunner of Poussin than Claude.

In his method, Lorrain would often use a grid of median and diagonal lines to place elements in the landscape in order to create a dynamic and harmonious composition in which landscape and architecture are balanced against empty space.

===Early works===
Claude&#x27;s earliest paintings draw from both these groups, being mostly rather smaller than later. Agostino Tassi may have been a pupil of Paul Bril, and his influence is especially evident in Claude&#x27;s earliest works, at a larger size, while some small works of about 1631 recall Elsheimer. Initially Claude often includes more figures than was typical of his predecessors, despite his figure drawing being generally recognised as &quot;notoriously feeble&quot;, as Roger Fry put it.

More often than later, the figures were mere genre staffage: shepherds, travellers, and sailors, as appropriate for the scene. In the early 1630s the first religious and mythological subjects appear, with a Flight into Egypt probably of 1631, and a Judgement of Paris, both very common subjects in the &quot;Landscape with..&quot; genre. The pair to the latter is a very early harbour scene, already with tall classical buildings, a type of composition Claude was to use for the rest of his career.

==Figures and other non-landscape elements==
===Figures===
Although virtually every painting contains figures, even if only a shepherd, their weakness has always been recognised, not least by Claude himself; according to Baldinucci he joked that he charged for his landscapes, but gave the figures for free. According to Sandrart he had made considerable efforts to improve, but without success; certainly there are numerous studies, typically for groups of figures, among his drawings. It has often been thought that he handed the figures in some works over to others to paint, but it is now generally agreed that there are few such cases. Baldinucci mentions Filippo Lauri in this context, but he was only born in 1623, and can only have taken on such work from the 1640s at best. The rider in the small &quot;Landscape with an Imaginary View of Tivoli&quot; in the Courtauld Gallery in London, LV 67 and dated 1642, is one of the last of his figures to wear contemporary dress. Thereafter all of them wore &quot;pastoral dress&quot; or the 17th-century idea of ancient dress.

In his last years his figures tend to become ever more elongated, a process taken to an extreme in his last painting, &quot;Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia&quot;, of which even its owner, the Ashmolean Museum, says &quot;The hunters are impossibly elongated – Ascanius, in particular, is absurdly top-heavy&quot;. Its pendant &quot;View of Carthage with Dido and Aeneas&quot; (1676, Kunsthalle, Hamburg) has figures almost as extreme. With the mid-20th fashion for medical diagnosis through art, it was suggested that Claude had developed an optical condition accounting for such effects, but this has been rejected by doctors and critics alike.

===Architecture===
Claude only rarely painted topographical scenes showing the Renaissance and Baroque Roman architecture still being created in his lifetime, but often borrowed from it to work up imaginary buildings. Most of the buildings near the foreground of his paintings are grand imagined temples and palaces in a generally classical style, but without the attempt at archaeological rigour seen in Poussin&#x27;s equivalents. Elements are borrowed and worked up from real buildings, both ancient and modern, and in the absence of much knowledge of what an ancient palace facade looked like, his palaces are more like the late Renaissance Roman palaces many of his clients lived in. Buildings that are less clearly seen, such as the towers that often emerge above trees in his backgrounds, are often more like the vernacular and medieval buildings he would have seen around Rome.

One example of a semi-topographic painting with &quot;modern&quot; buildings (there are rather more such drawings) is &quot;A View of Rome&quot; (1632, NG 1319), which seems to represent the view from the roof of Claude&#x27;s house, including his parish church and initial burial place of Santa Trinita del Monte, and other buildings such as the Quirinal Palace. This view takes up the left-hand side of the painting, but on the right, behind a group of genre figures in modern dress (uniquely for Claude, these represent a scene of prostitution in the Dutch Merry Company tradition), is a statue of Apollo and a Roman temple portico, both of which are either wholly imaginary or at least not placed in their actual locations.
In a generic &quot;Seaport&quot; in the National Gallery (1644, NG5) a palace facade expanding on the gateway built about 1570 between the Farnese Gardens and the Roman Forum is next door to the Arch of Titus, here apparently part of another palace. Behind that Claude repeats a palace he had used before, that borrows from several buildings in and around Rome, including the Villa Farnesina and the Palazzo Senatorio. It is pointless to question how Ascanius finds in Latium a large stone temple in a fully developed Corinthian order, that has evidently been crumbling into ruins for several centuries.

===Shipping===
Claude&#x27;s lack of interest in avoiding anachronism is perhaps seen most clearly in the ships in his harbour scenes. Whether the subject, and the dress of the figures, is supposed to be contemporary, mythogical or from Roman or medieval history, the large ships are usually the same up-to-date merchant vessels. Some large rowed galleys are seen, as in &quot;Landscape with the Arrival of Aeneas before the City of Pallanteum&quot; (one of the &quot;Altieri Claudes&quot;, Anglesey Abbey), where Virgil&#x27;s text specifies galleys. Ships in the background are more likely to attempt to reflect an ancient setting; in the London &quot;Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba&quot; (1648, NG 14) the ship at the centre of the composition is modern, the others less so.

==Critical assessment and legacy==

As seen in his painting &quot;The Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba&quot;, Claude was innovative in including the Sun itself as a source of light in his paintings.

In Rome, Bril, Girolamo Muziano and Federico Zuccaro and later Elsheimer, Annibale Carracci and Domenichino made landscape vistas pre-eminent in some of their drawings and paintings (as well as Da Vinci in his private drawings or Baldassarre Peruzzi in his decorative frescoes of &quot;vedute&quot;); but it might be argued that not until Claude&#x27;s generation, did landscape completely reflect an aesthetic viewpoint which was seen as completely autonomous in its moral purpose within the cultural world of Rome.

In this matter of the importance of landscape, Claude was prescient. Living in a pre-Romantic era, he did not depict those uninhabited panoramas that were to be esteemed in later centuries, such as with Salvatore Rosa. He painted a pastoral world of fields and valleys not distant from castles and towns. If the ocean horizon is represented, it is from the setting of a busy port. Perhaps to feed the public need for paintings with noble themes, his pictures include demigods, heroes and saints, even though his abundant drawings and sketchbooks prove that he was more interested in scenography.

Claude Lorrain was described as kind to his pupils and hard-working; keenly observant, but an unlettered man until his death.

John Constable described Claude as &quot;the most perfect landscape painter the world ever saw&quot;, and declared that in Claude&#x27;s landscape &quot;all is lovely – all amiable – all is amenity and repose; the calm sunshine of the heart&quot;.

==Claude glass==
The Claude glass, named after Lorrain in England although there is no indication he used or knew of it or anything similar, gave a framed and dark-tinted reflection of a real view, that was supposed to help artists produce works of art similar to his, and tourists to adjust views to a Claudian formula. William Gilpin, the inventor of the picturesque ideal, advocated the use of a Claude glass saying, &quot;they give the object of nature a soft, mellow tinge like the colouring of that Master.&quot;

Claude glasses were widely used by tourists and amateur artists, who quickly became the targets of satire. Hugh Sykes Davies observed their facing away from the object they wished to paint, commenting, &quot;It is very typical of their attitude to Nature that such a position should be desirable.&quot;

<text>The viola d&#x27;amore (; ) is a 7- or 6-stringed musical instrument with additional sympathetic strings used chiefly in the baroque period. It is played under the chin in the same manner as the violin.

== Structure and sound ==

The viola d&#x27;amore shares many features of the viol family. It looks like a thinner treble viol without frets and sometimes with sympathetic strings added. The six-string viola d&#x27;amore and the treble viol also have approximately the same ambitus or range of playable notes. Like all viols, it has a flat back. An intricately carved head at the top of the peg box is common on both viols and viola d&#x27;amore, although some viols lack one. Unlike the carved heads on viols, the viola d&#x27;amore&#x27;s head occurs most often as Cupid blindfolded to represent the blindness of love. Its sound-holes are commonly in the shape of a flaming sword known as &quot;The Flaming Sword of Islam&quot; (suggesting the instrument&#x27;s development was influenced by the Islamic World). This was one of the three usual sound hole shapes for viols as well. It is unfretted, and played much like a violin, being held horizontally under the chin. It is about the same size as the modern viola.

The viola d&#x27;amore usually has six or seven playing strings, which are sounded by drawing a bow across them, just as with a violin. In addition, it has an equal number of sympathetic strings located below the main strings and the fingerboard which are not played directly but vibrate in sympathy with the notes played. A common variation is six playing strings, and instruments exist with as many as fourteen sympathetic strings alone. Despite the fact that the sympathetic strings are now thought of as the most characteristic element of the instrument, early forms of the instrument almost uniformly lacked them. The first unambiguous reference to a viola d&#x27;amore with sympathetic strings does not occur until the 1730s. Both types continued to be built and played through the 18th century.

Largely thanks to the sympathetic strings, the viola d&#x27;amore has a particularly sweet and warm sound. Leopold Mozart, writing in his &quot;Versuch einer gründlichen Violinschule&quot;, said that the instrument sounded &quot;especially charming in the stillness of the evening.&quot;

The first known mention of the name &quot;viol d&#x27;amore&quot; appeared in John Evelyn&#x27;s &quot;Diary&quot; (20 November 1679): &quot;for its swetenesse &amp; novelty the Viol d&#x27;Amore of 5 wyre-strings, plaid on with a bow, being but an ordinary violin, play&#x27;d on Lyra way by a German, than which I never heard a sweeter Instrument or more surprizing...&quot;

== Range ==
As on the treble viol, the register above the octave (d) on the top string would seldom be used except in contemporary music. The viola d&#x27;amore was normally tuned specifically for the piece it was to play - cf. scordatura. Towards the end of the 18th century the standard tuning became Open D Major: A, d, a, d&#x27;, f&#x27;, a&#x27;, d&quot;.

== Use ==

The instrument was especially popular in the late 17th century, although a specialised viola d&#x27;amore player would have been highly unusual, since it was customary for professional musicians to play a number of instruments, especially within the family of the musician&#x27;s main instrument. Later, the instrument fell from use, as the volume and power of the violin family became preferred over the delicacy and sweetness of the viol family. However, there has been renewed interest in the viola d&#x27;amore in the last century. The viola players Henri Casadesus and Paul Hindemith both played the viola d&#x27;amore in the early 20th century, and the film composer Bernard Herrmann made use of it in several scores. It may be noted that, like instruments of the violin family, the modern viola d&#x27;amore was altered slightly in structure from the baroque version, mainly to support the extra tension of steel wound strings.

Leoš Janáček originally planned to use the viola d&#x27;amore in his second string quartet, &quot;Intimate Letters&quot;. The use of the instrument was symbolic of the nature of his relationship with Kamila Stösslová, a relationship that inspired the work. However, the version with viola d&#x27;amore was found in rehearsal to be impracticable, and Janáček re-cast the part for a conventional viola.
Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s ballet &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; features a viola d&#x27;amore as well.
The viola d&#x27;amore can regularly be heard today in musical ensembles that specialise in historically informed performances of Baroque music on authentic instruments.

== Scordatura notation ==

&quot;Scordatura&quot; notation was first used in the late seventeenth century as a way to quickly read music for violin with altered tunings. It was a natural choice for viola d&#x27;amore and other stringed instruments not tuned in the usual fifths, especially those whose intervals between strings are not uniform across their range. Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber, Antonio Vivaldi and Johann Joseph Vilsmayr (a student of Biber), among others, wrote pieces for violin with one or more strings retuned to notes other than the usual fifths. Given that the viola d’amore was usually played by violinists and that many different tunings were used, scordatura notation made it easier for a violinist to read the music.

Scordatura notation exists in a number of different types. Treble clef, alto clef and soprano clefs are all used by different composers. Bass clef is typically used for notes on the lower two or three strings (6 or 7 string instruments) and usually sounds an octave higher than written. In scordatura, one imagines that one is playing a violin (or in some cases a viola, where alto clef is used) tuned in the normal fifths. Scordatura notation informs the player not about what note will sound but rather about where they should place their fingers; therefore, it may be referred to as a tablature or &quot;finger&quot; notation.

In Biber&#x27;s &quot;Harmonia Artificiosa&quot; no. VII, a different version of scordatura notation is used. Biber uses a nine line staff. The clefs used are based on alto clef (imagining that you are playing a viola). The piece is written for a six-stringed instrument. The upper part of the staff supposes that you are playing on the upper four strings and the lower part that you are playing on the lower four strings (still imagining that you are reading the four strings of a viola in alto clef). This does mean that there are two ways of notating notes on the middle two strings but it quickly becomes apparent, when playing, what the correct reading should be.

;Film and Television
* Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s score for &quot;On Dangerous Ground&quot; (1951) makes extensive use of the viola d&#x27;amore for the female protagonist&#x27;s theme. The performer of the instrument Virginia Majewski receives a credit in the film&#x27;s opening titles.
* Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s score for &quot;Little Girl Lost&quot; a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; (1962) television episode makes beautiful use of the viola d&#x27;amore to set a mood. Virginia Majewski performs most evocatively.
* James Newton Howard&#x27;s score for &quot;After Earth&quot; (2013) uses a quartet of violas d&#x27;amore to provide eerie soundscapes, performed by Pamela Goldsmith, Roland Kato, Jennie Hansen and Adriana Zoppo.

&quot;Note:&quot; The papers of Walter Voigtlander contain 142 arrangements and transcriptions of works for the instrument.

== Pedagogical works ==
* &quot;The Modern Viole d&#x27;Amour Player, Systematically Arranged Material for the Studie of the Viole d&#x27;Amour for the Violin Player&quot; by Walter Voigtlander (written before 1914). This is a basic pedagogical method, which starts the player from the most elementary elements of the instrument and progresses to a fair level of difficulty. It contains adaptations of violin and viola exercises by many well-known pedagogues. In addition, the work contains a supplement with many solo works and orchestral soli, by many composers, including his own 42 Studies (see below). Available as part of The Walter Voigtlander Collection of Viola d&#x27;Amore Music, ca. 1890–1930 at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts (see finding aid).
* &quot;42 Studies transcribed for the Viole d&#x27;Amour for the Violin Player, and Viola Studies for Self-Study&quot; by Walter Voigtlander. It has annotations in both German and English. It is the more advanced of his two pedagogical works, being intended, according to Rosenblum, largely for his own use. Exercises from well-known violin and viola method books are extracted and modified for the viola d&#x27;amore. Available as part of The Walter Voigtlander Collection of Viola d&#x27;Amore Music, ca. 1890–1930 at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts (see finding aid). 
* &quot;16 Studi-Capricci for Viola d&#x27;amore&quot; by Aurelio Arcidiacono (1915-2000) These are advanced etudes, music eminently suitable for performance. Published by Amore Publications (1990)

<text>Gaius Marius (; – 13 January 86 BC) was a Roman general and statesman. Victor of the Cimbric and Jugurthine wars, he held the office of consul an unprecedented seven times. Rising from a family of smallholders in a village called Ceraetae in the district of Arpinum, Marius acquired his initial military experience serving with Scipio Aemilianus at the Siege of Numantia in 134 BC. He won election as tribune of the plebs in 119 BC and passed a law limiting aristocratic interference in elections. Barely elected praetor in 115 BC, he next became the governor of Further Spain where he campaigned against bandits. On his return from Spain he married Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar.

Marius attained his first consulship in 107 BC and became the commander of Roman forces in Numidia, where he brought an end to the Jugurthine War. By 105 BC Rome faced an invasion by the Cimbri and Teutones, and the &quot;comitia centuriata&quot; elected Marius consul for a second time to face this new threat. Marius was consul every year from 104 to 100 BC, and he defeated the Teutones at Aquae Sextiae and the Cimbri at Vercellae. However, Marius suffered political setbacks during his sixth consulship in 100 BC and afterwards entered a period of semi-retirement from public life.

The Republic fell into crisis with the outbreak of the Social War in 91 BC, in which Marius fought with limited success. He then became embroiled in a conflict with the Roman general Sulla which resulted in his exile to Africa in 88 BC. Marius returned to Italy from Carthage during the War of Octavius, seized Rome, and began a bloody reign of terror in the city which culminated in him being elected consul a seventh time and then dying within weeks of assuming this seventh consulship, in 86 BC.

In the 19th century, Marius was credited with the so-called Marian reforms, including the shift from militia levies to a professional soldiery; improvements to the &quot;pilum&quot; (a kind of javelin); and changes to the logistical structure of the Roman army. Twenty-first-century historians generally view the notion as &quot;a construct of modern scholarship.&quot;

==Life==
===Early career===
Marius was born in Cereatae , a small village near the town of Arpinum in south-east Latium. The town had been conquered by the Romans in the late 4th century BC and was initially given Roman citizenship without voting rights (&quot;civitas sine suffragio&quot;). Only in 188 BC, thirty years before his birth, did the town receive full citizenship. Although Plutarch claims that Marius&#x27;s father was a labourer, this is almost certainly false since Marius had connections with the nobility in Rome, he ran for local office in Arpinum, and he had marriage relations with the local nobility in Arpinum, all of which when taken together indicate that he was born into a locally important family of equestrian status. While many of the problems he faced during his early career in Rome show the difficulties that faced a &quot;new man&quot; (&quot;novus homo&quot;) in being accepted into the stratified upper echelons of Roman society, Marius – even as a young man – was not poor or even middle-class; he was most assuredly born into inherited wealth, gained most likely from large land holdings. In fact, his family&#x27;s resources were definitely large enough to support not just one member of the family in Roman politics, but two: Marius&#x27;s younger brother, Marcus Marius, also entered Roman public life.

In 134 BC, Marius joined the personal legion of Scipio Aemilianus as an officer for the expedition to Numantia. It is unclear whether or not Marius was already present and serving in Numantia with the previous commander when Aemilianus arrived. While serving with the army at Numantia, his military aptitude brought him to the attention of Scipio Aemilianus. According to Plutarch, during a conversation after dinner, when the conversation turned to generals and someone asked Scipio Aemilianus where the Roman people would find a worthy successor to him, the younger Scipio gently tapped on Marius&#x27;s shoulder, saying &quot;Perhaps this is the man&quot;.

It would seem that even at this early stage of his military career, Marius had ambitions for a political career in Rome. He was elected on the basis of his accomplishments, even though he was not known by sight to the electors, as one of the twenty-four special military tribunes. After election, he likely served Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus on the Balearic Islands, helping him win a triumph. Next, Marius possibly ran for the quaestorship after losing an election for local office in Arpinum. He may have stood for local office as a means of gaining support back home, and lost to a local competitor. It is possible, however, that Marius never ran for the quaestorship at all, jumping directly to plebeian tribune. He likely participated in the major Roman victory at the Battle of the Isère River in 121 BC, which permanently cemented Roman control over southern Gaul.

In 120 BC, Marius was returned as a plebeian tribune for the following year. He won with the support of the Metelli, specifically Lucius Caecilius Metellus Dalmaticus. While Plutarch says the Metelli were one of his family&#x27;s hereditary patrons, this may be a latter-day exaggeration. It was not uncommon for prospective consuls to campaign for their candidates for the tribunate and lower the possibility of opposition tribunes exercising their vetoes.
Plutarch relates that against the wishes of his patrons, he pushed through a law that restricted the interference of the wealthy in elections. In the 130s, voting by ballot had been introduced in elections for choosing magistrates, passing laws and deciding legal cases, replacing the earlier system of oral voting. The wealthy continued to try to influence the voting by inspecting ballots, and Marius passed a law narrowing the passages down which voters passed to cast their votes in order to prevent outsiders from harassing the electors or seeing who was voted for. It is not clear, however, whether Plutarch&#x27;s narrative history properly reflects how controversial this proposal in fact was; Cicero, writing during the Republic, describes this as quite straightforward and uncontroversial. Plutarch reports that he then alienated the plebs by vetoing a bill expanding the grain dole, but it is more likely that Plutarch misinterpreted Marius as vetoing attempts to interfere in the existing grain provisions.

Soon thereafter, in 117 BC, Marius stood for the aedileship and lost. It seems clear that by this time, due to the enormous financial difficulties that any prospective aedile would have to shoulder, Marius had either amassed or was availed of significant financial resources. This loss was at least in part due to the enmity of the Metelli. In 116 BC he barely won election as praetor for the following year, coming in last, and was promptly accused of (electoral corruption). Being accused of electoral corruption was common during the middle and late Republic and details of the trial are sketchy or apocryphal. Marius, however, was able to win acquittal on this charge, and spent an uneventful year as praetor in Rome, likely as either or as president of the corruption court. In 114 BC, Marius&#x27;s imperium was prorogued and he was sent to govern the highly sought-after province of Further Spain () pro consule, where he engaged in some sort of minor military operation to clear brigands from untapped mining areas. He likely governed his province for two years before returning to Rome late in 113 BC with his personal wealth greatly enlarged.

He received no triumph on his return, but he did marry Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar. The Julii Caesares were a patrician family, but at this period seem to have found it hard to advance beyond the praetorship into the consulship. The Julii had done so only once in the 2nd century, in 157 BC. The match was advantageous to both sides: Marius gained respectability by marrying into a patrician family and the Julii received a great injection of energy and money. Sources are unclear on whether Marius joined the annual race of former praetors for the consulship, but it is likely that he failed to be elected at least once.

===Subordinate to Metellus===
The Jugurthine War started in 112 BC due to &quot;Roman exasperation with the ambitions of Jugurtha&quot;, a Numidian king who had killed his half-brothers, massacred Italians in his civil war against them, and bribed many prominent Romans to support him in the Senate. After the start of hostilities, the first army sent to Numidia was apparently bribed to withdraw and the second army was defeated and forced to pass under the yoke in humiliation. These debacles eroded trust in the ability of the aristocracy to adequately manage foreign affairs.

While Marius had seemingly broken with the Caecilii Metelli during his time as tribune and praetor, the Metelli did not seem to hold this rupture against him so much as to pass over him for selection as legate in the opening phases of the Jugurthine War. In 109 BC, likely to improve his chances for the consulship, Marius joined then-consul Quintus Caecilius Metellus in his campaign against Jugurtha. In Sallust&#x27;s long account of Metellus&#x27;s campaign, no other legates are mentioned, so Marius was probably Metellus&#x27;s senior subordinate and right-hand man. Metellus was using Marius&#x27;s strong military experience, while Marius was strengthening his position to stand for the consulship.

During the Battle of the Muthul, Marius&#x27;s actions probably saved the army of Metellus from annihilation. Jugurtha had cut the Romans off from the River Muthul where they wanted to refill their water reserves. The Romans had to fight Jugurtha in the desert where the Numidian light cavalry had an advantage. The Numidian cavalry scattered the Romans into small detachments and soon had control of the battlefield. Each group of Romans was fighting for survival independently. At this point Marius re-organized a few detachments and led a column of 2,000 men through the Numidians to link up with Metellus. Together they led their men against the Numidian infantry who occupied a hill. After gaining control of the hill Marius and Metellus led their men against the rear of the Numidian cavalry. The Romans gained the initiative and the Numidians had no choice but to withdraw.

===Standing for the consulship===
By 108 BC, Marius expressed his desire to stand for consul. Metellus did not give Marius his blessing to return to Rome, allegedly advising Marius to wait until Metellus&#x27;s son was elected (who was at the time only twenty, signifying a campaign decades in the future). Undeterred, Marius began to campaign for the consulship. Sallust claims that this was catalysed, in part, by a fortune-teller in Utica who &quot;declared that a great and marvellous career awaited him; the seer accordingly advised him, trusting in the gods, to carry out what he had in mind and put his fortune to the test as often as possible, predicting that all his undertakings would have a happy issue&quot;.

Marius soon earned the respect of the troops by his conduct towards them, eating his meals with them and proving he was not afraid to share in any of their labours. He also won over the Italian traders by claiming that he could capture Jugurtha in a few days with half of Metellus&#x27;s troops. Both groups wrote home in praise of him, suggesting that he could end the war quickly, unlike Metellus, who was pursuing a policy of methodically subduing the countryside.

During the winter of 109 and 108 BC, a detachment of Roman soldiers serving as the garrison of Vaga was ambushed and cut down almost to a man. The garrison commander, one Titus Turpilius Silanus, a client of Metellus, escaped unharmed. Marius allegedly urged Metellus to sentence Silanus to death on charges of cowardice, but then turned on Metellus, arguing that the sentence was disproportionate and overly harsh. Marius also sent letters back to Rome claiming that Metellus had become enamoured with the unlimited powers associated with his &quot;imperium&quot;. Metellus, wary of an increasingly disgruntled and resentful subordinate, permitted Marius to return to Rome. According to Plutarch, he returned with barely enough time to make it back for the consular elections; but according to Sallust, with enough time to effectively canvass for votes.

With growing political pressure towards a quick victory over Jugurtha and equestrian hostility toward the senate&#x27;s conduct of the war, Marius was elected consul for 107 BC, campaigning against Metellus&#x27;s apparent lack of swift action against Jugurtha, with Lucius Cassius Longinus as his colleague. The senate prorogued Metellus&#x27;s command in Numidia, thereby preventing Marius from assuming command. Marius got around this by inducing an ally of his, then-tribune Titus Manlius Mancinus, to have the &quot;concilium plebis&quot; override the Senate&#x27;s decision and give him the command. Metellus refused to personally hand over command to Marius and returned to Rome. Upon his return, the senate voted Metellus a triumph and the &quot;agnomen&quot; &quot;Numidicus&quot;.

Seeking troops to bolster the forces in Numidia and win his promised quick victory, Marius found it difficult to recruit from Rome&#x27;s traditional source of manpower, property-holding men. Except in emergencies, normal practice in the middle republic was only to allow property-owning citizens to enlist in the legions; this may have been related to Tiberius Gracchus&#x27;s reforms which would have, by giving more people more land, made more men eligible to serve in the legions. While the senate allowed Marius to conscript men normally, he preferred instead to request volunteers, especially among discharged veterans (), with promises of victory and plunder. He also recruited volunteers from men without property, the . With more troops mustering in southern Italy, Marius sailed for Africa, leaving his cavalry in the hands of his newly elected quaestor, Lucius Cornelius Sulla.

Marius found that ending the war was more difficult than he had previously boasted. Jugurtha was fighting a guerrilla war, and it appeared that no strategy would work better than Metellus&#x27;s strategy of denying Jugurtha local reinforcement and support. Marius arrived comparatively late in 107 BC but still fought and won a battle near Cirta (modern Constantine, Algeria). At the end of 107 he surprised Jugurtha by a dangerous desert march to Capsa in the far south where, after the town surrendered, he killed all the adult males, enslaved the remaining survivors, and razed the town, distributing the loot to his soldiers. Keeping up the pressure, he drove Jugurtha&#x27;s forces southwards and westwards into Mauretania. Marius had been supposedly unhappy at receiving the dissolute and libertine Lucius Cornelius Sulla as his quaestor, but Sulla proved a highly competent officer and was well liked by the men.

Meanwhile, Jugurtha was trying to get his father-in-law king Bocchus of Mauretania to join him in the war against the Romans. In 106, Marius marched his army far to the west, capturing a fortress near the river Molochath. Unfortunately, this advance brought him near the dominions of Bocchus, finally provoking the Mauretanian into action; in the deserts just west of Serif, Marius was taken by surprise by a combined army of Numidians and Mauretanians under the command of the two enemy kings. For once, Marius was unprepared for action and in the melee all he could do was form defensive circles. The attack was pressed by Mauretanian and Gaetulian horsemen and for a time Marius and his main force found themselves besieged on a hill, while Sulla and his men were on the defensive on another hill nearby. The Romans managed to hold off the enemy until evening and the Africans retired. The next morning at dawn the Romans surprised the Africans&#x27; insufficiently guarded camp and completely routed the Numidian–Mauretanian army. Marius then marched east to winter quarters in Cirta. The African kings harried the retreat with light cavalry, but were beaten back by Sulla, whom Marius had put in command of the cavalry. It was by now evident that Rome would not defeat Jugurtha&#x27;s guerrilla tactics through military means. Therefore, Marius resumed negotiations with Bocchus, who, though he had joined in the fighting, had not yet declared war.

Ultimately, Marius reached a deal with Bocchus whereby Sulla, who was friendly with members of Bocchus&#x27;s court, would enter Bocchus&#x27;s camp to receive Jugurtha as a hostage. In spite of the possibility of treachery on the Mauritanian&#x27;s part, Sulla agreed; Jugurtha&#x27;s remaining followers were massacred, and he himself was handed over in chains to Sulla by Bocchus. In the aftermath, Bocchus annexed the western part of Jugurtha&#x27;s kingdom and was recognised as an ally of Rome. Jugurtha was thrown into an underground prison (the Tullianum) in Rome, and ultimately died after gracing Marius&#x27;s triumph in 104 BC.

Sulla and Marius, after the triumph, disputed who received credit for capturing Jugurtha. As Sulla was acting as Marius&#x27;s subordinate, under Roman tradition, the credit was Marius&#x27;s; Sulla and his noble allies, however, focused on Sulla&#x27;s direct responsibility to discredit Marius&#x27;s victory. According to Plutarch, this was &quot;the first seed&quot; of their &quot;incurable hatred&quot;.

=== Putative reforms to the military ===
Marius has, in modern scholarship starting from the 1840s in Germany, repeatedly been attributed with broad reforms to the military during his consulships between 107 and 100 BC. The standard narrative is that after a series of manpower shortages, Marius received a dispensation to recruit volunteers from the poorest census class, the , for the war against Jugurtha in 107 BC. There is, however, very little evidence that Italy&#x27;s population fell during the second century, that any major reforms to the Roman army occurred in the second century, or that Marius was responsible; specialists now increasingly dismiss these &quot;Marian reforms&quot; as a &quot;construct of modern scholarship&quot;.

The recruitment of in 107, documented in Sallust, seems to have been a one-time affair: the volunteers were discharged on their return from the war and Marius, upon assuming command against the Cimbri, took over command of a consular army in northern Italy levied in the traditional manner. There are no indications that open recruitment of volunteers changed the social composition of the legions and later texts indicate that the Romans continued to raise most of their armies by conscription. The armies of the late Republic still were predominantly drawn from rural populations. The narrative that the army&#x27;s domination by poor volunteers, who in search of riches and retirement bonuses became the clients of their generals, who then used those armies to overthrow the republic, is now rejected.

Other reforms attributed to Marius include the abolition of the citizen cavalry and light infantry, a redesign of the , a standardised eagle standard for all legions, and the substitution of the cohort for the maniple. There is little evidence for the abolition of the citizen cavalry and light infantry by the first century BC, as they are still attested in evidence. If Marius redesigned the , archaeological finds indicate his design was soon discarded. Literary evidence indicates that eagle standards continued to co-exist through the late republic with other traditional animal standards including the ox and wolf. Lastly, there is no ancient evidence that Marius introduced the cohort; Sallust&#x27;s narrative gives the last attestation of the maniple in 109 BC under Metellus Numidicus&#x27; command.

Changes to logistical arrangements and training, the (&quot;Marius&#x27;s mules&quot;) of common historiography, were regular practice among Roman generals: seeking victory, they generally sought the speed advantages of operating without large baggage trains and to ensure that their men were well-trained for combat.

===Cimbri and Teutones===

In 109 BC a migrating Germanic tribe called the Cimbri appeared in Gaul and routed the Roman army there under Marcus Junius Silanus. This defeat reduced Roman prestige and resulted in unrest among the Celtic tribes recently conquered by the Romans in southern Gaul. In 107 the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus was completely defeated by the Tigurini, and the senior surviving officer (one Gaius Popillius, son of the consul of 132) had saved what was left only by surrendering half the baggage and suffering the humiliation of having his army &quot;pass under the yoke&quot;. The next year, 106 BC, another consul, Quintus Servilius Caepio, marched to Gaul with a new army to salvage the situation. Caepio was prorogued into the next year and the new consul for 105 BC, Gnaeus Mallius Maximus, was also assigned to southern Gaul with another army. Caepio&#x27;s disdain for Mallius – a new man like Marius with a hunger for glory – made it impossible for them to cooperate.

The Cimbri and another tribe called the Teutones appeared on the Rhône, and while Caepio was on the west bank he refused to come to the aid of Mallius on the east. The Senate was unable to induce Caepio to cooperate with Mallius, which proved both generals&#x27; undoing. At the Battle of Arausio (modern Orange), the Cimbri overran Caepio&#x27;s legions with massively overwhelming numbers. Caepio&#x27;s routed men crashed into Mallius&#x27;s troops, which led to both armies being pinned against the Rhône and annihilated by the numerically dominant Cimbrian warriors. News of this defeat reached Rome just shortly after Marius completed the campaign against Jugurtha successfully.

The Republic, altogether lacking generals who had recently concluded military campaigns successfully, took the illegal step of electing Marius &quot;in absentia&quot; for a second consulship in three years. While his election was not unprecedented, as Quintus Fabius Maximus had been elected for consecutive consulships and it was not unheard of for consuls to be elected &quot;in absentia&quot;, the precedent was certainly not recent. Yet, since the Assembly had the ability to overturn any law, it simply set aside the requirements and made Marius consul.

====As consul====
Marius was still in Africa when the Assembly elected him consul for 104 BC. At the start of his consulship, Marius returned from Africa in spectacular triumph, bringing Jugurtha and the riches of North Africa to awe the citizenry. Jugurtha, who had prophesied the purchase and destruction of Rome, met his end in a Roman prison after having been led through the streets of the city in chains. Marius was assigned (it is unclear whether by the Assembly or by sortition) the province of Gaul to deal with the Cimbric threat.

The Cimbri, after their decisive victory at Arausio, marched west into Hispania. Marius was tasked with rebuilding, effectively from scratch, the Gallic legions. Building his army around a core of trained legionaries from the last year, Marius again secured exemption from the property requirements and with his newly minted reputation for victory, raised an army of some thirty thousand Romans and forty thousand Italian allies and auxiliaries. He established a base around the town of Aquae Sextiae (modern Aix-en-Provence) and trained his men.

One of his legates was his old quaestor, Sulla, which shows that at this time there was no ill will between them. In 104 BC, Marius was returned as consul again for 103 BC. Though he could have continued to operate as proconsul, it is likely that the people re-elected him as consul so as to avoid another incident of disputed command à la Caepio and Mallius. While Plutarch – possibly referencing the memoirs of Rutilius Rufus – jibed that Marius&#x27;s consular colleagues were his servants, Evans dismisses this.

In 103 BC, the Germans still did not emerge from Hispania, and Marius&#x27;s colleague died, requiring Marius to return to Rome to call elections. Lacking a decisive conclusion to the Cimbrian conflict over the last two years, it was not a foregone conclusion that Marius would win reelection. An appeal by a young tribune, Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, in a public meeting before the vote – along with a field of candidates without great name recognition – allowed Marius to be returned as consul again in 102 BC. His colleague was Quintus Lutatius Catulus. Over his successive consulships, Marius was not idle. He trained his troops, built his intelligence network, and conducted diplomacy with the Gallic tribes on the provincial frontiers.

==== Battle with the Germanic tribes ====

The decision to re-elect Marius as consul for 102 BC was vindicated when the Cimbri returned from Hispania and, with a number of other tribes, moved on Italy. The Teutones and their allies the Ambrones were to head south and advance toward Italy from the west along the coast; the Cimbri were to attempt to cross the Alps into Italy from the north by the Brenner Pass; and the Tigurini (the allied Celtic tribe who had defeated Longinus in 107) were to cross the Alps from the northeast. The two consuls divided their forces, with Marius heading west into Gaul and Catulus holding the Italian Alps.

In the west, Marius denied the Teutones and Ambrones battle, staying inside a fortified camp and fighting off their attempts to storm it. Failing to take his camp, the Teutones and their allies moved on. Marius shadowed them, waiting for an opportune moment to attack. Near Aquae Sextiae (modern Aix-en-Provence), an accidental skirmish between Roman camp servants, getting water, and bathing Ambrones turned into a spontaneous battle between Marius&#x27;s army and the Ambrones in which the Romans defeated some 30,000 Ambrones. The next day, the Teutones and the Ambrones counterattacked up a hill against the Roman position. Marcus Claudius Marcellus flanked their advance with a column of three thousand men, turning the battle into a slaughter: estimates vary from 100,000 to 200,000 being slain or captured. Marius sent Manius Aquillius with a report to Rome that said 37,000 superbly trained Romans had succeeded in defeating over 100,000 Germans in two engagements.

Marius&#x27;s consular colleague in 102 BC, Quintus Lutatius Catulus, who Marius may have expected to &quot;spend a fruitless year employed in garrison duty&quot;, did not fare so well. He suffered some casualties in a minor engagement up in one of the mountain valleys near Tridentum. Catulus then withdrew and the Cimbri entered northern Italy. The Cimbri paused in northern Italy to regroup and await expected reinforcements from the other Alpine passes.

Shortly after Marius had vanquished the western invaders at Aquae Sextiae, Marius received news that he had been re-elected to his fourth consecutive consulship (and fifth consulship as a whole) as consul for 101 BC. His colleague would be his friend Manius Aquillius. After election, he returned to Rome to announce his victory at Aquae Sextiae, deferred a triumph, and promptly marched north with his army to join Catulus, whose command was prorogued since Marius&#x27;s consular colleague was dispatched to defeat a slave revolt in Sicily.

In late July 101 BC, during a meeting with the Cimbri, the invading tribesmen threatened the Romans with the advance of the Teutones and Ambrones. After informing the Cimbri of their allies&#x27; destruction, both sides prepared for battle. In the ensuing battle – the Battle of Vercellae (or the Raudine Plain) – Rome decisively defeated the Cimbri. Caught off guard by Sulla&#x27;s cavalry, pinned down by Catulus&#x27;s infantry and flanked by Marius, the Cimbri were slaughtered and the survivors enslaved. Upwards of 120,000 Cimbri perished. The Tigurini gave up their efforts to enter Italy from the northeast and went home.

After fifteen days of thanksgiving, Catulus and Marius celebrated a joint triumph. Plutarch reports that Marius was also hailed as &quot;the third founder of Rome&quot;, but this is unlikely, as the identification of Camillus as a &quot;second&quot; founder dates to after the Sullan-era annalists and may be in fact post-Ciceronean. In the popular imagination, it was Marius who &quot;deserved to be the sole beneficiary of the two triumphs awarded for the decisive conclusion of the war&quot;. At the same time, Marius&#x27;s consular colleague, Manius Aquillius, defeated the Sicilian slave revolt in the Second Servile War. Having saved the Republic from destruction and at the height of his political powers, Marius desired another consulship to secure land grants for his veteran volunteers and to ensure he received appropriate credit for his military successes. Marius was duly returned as consul for 100 BC with Lucius Valerius Flaccus; according to Plutarch, he also campaigned on behalf of his colleague so to prevent his rival Metellus Numidicus from securing a seat.

===Sixth consulship===

During the year of Marius&#x27;s sixth consulship (100 BC), Lucius Appuleius Saturninus was tribune of the plebs for the second time and advocated reforms like those earlier put forth by the Gracchi. Saturninus, after assassinating one of his political opponents to the tribunate, pushed for bills that would drive Marius&#x27;s former commanding officer Metellus Numidicus into exile, lower the price of wheat distributed by the state, and give colonial lands to the veterans of Marius&#x27;s recent war. Saturninus&#x27;s bill gave lands to all veterans of the Cimbric wars, including those of Italian allies, which was resented by some of the &quot;plebs urbana&quot;.

Marius worked with Saturninus and Saturninus&#x27;s ally Glaucia to pass the land bill and banish Metellus Numidicus, but then distanced himself from them and their more radical policies. Around the start of the annual campaign season for the consulship, Marius attempted to disqualify Glaucia from standing for consul. Because other candidates would lower the chances of Glaucia&#x27;s victory, Saturninus and Glaucia had an opponent – Gaius Memmius – killed during the consular elections for 99 BC. The elections then were delayed. The Senate responded to Saturninus&#x27;s attempt, to by violence force through Glaucia&#x27;s candidacy over Marius&#x27;s disqualification, by issuing a &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot;, and – for the first time – ordered the magistrates to take whatever actions they felt necessary to end unrest generated by other Roman magistrates.

After rejecting a plan to deploy the army near Rome under proconsul Marcus Antonius, Marius rallied volunteers from the urban plebs and his veterans. He cut the water supply to the Capitoline hill and put Saturninus under a short and decisive siege. After Saturninus surrendered, Marius attempted to keep Saturninus and his followers alive by locking them safely inside the senate house, where they would await prosecution. Possibly with Marius&#x27;s implied consent, an angry mob broke into the building and, by dislodging the roof tiles and throwing them at the prisoners below, lynched those inside. Glaucia too was dragged from a house and killed.

In complying with the Senate&#x27;s wishes, Marius tried to show the Senate, who had always been suspicious of his motives, that he was one of them instead of the outsider that Quintus Metellus said he was in 108 BC. Marius&#x27;s overall concern was always how to maintain the Senate&#x27;s esteem: in the words of the scholar A.N. Sherwin-White, Marius &quot;wanted to end his days as &quot;vir censorius&quot;, like the other great worthies among the &quot;novi homines&quot; of the second century&quot;. 

This episode in the city, however, won Marius little advantage. After he left office, Metellus Numidicus&#x27; relatives dogged him in mourning dress for his maltreatment of the general, pleading for his recall from exile. Plutarch states that Marius had alienated both senators and the people. It is, however, unlikely that Marius was abandoned by his clients and peers, as Plutarch also claims. Evans tells us that Marius entered a semi-retirement as an elder statesman, a role which &quot;precluded a more active participation in public life&quot;.

===90s BC===
After the events of 100 BC, Marius at first tried to oppose the recall of Metellus Numidicus, who had been exiled by Saturninus in 103. However, seeing that opposition was impossible, Marius decided to travel to the east to Galatia in 98 BC, ostensibly to fulfil a vow he had made to the goddess &quot;Magna Mater&quot;.

Plutarch portrays this voluntary exile as a great humiliation for the six-time consul: &quot;considered obnoxious to the nobles and to the people alike&quot;, he was even forced to abandon his candidature for the censorship of 97. Plutarch also reports that while in the East, Marius attempted to goad Mithridates VI of Pontus into declaring war on Rome – telling Mithridates to either become stronger than Rome or obey her commands – so that the Roman people might be forced to rely on Marius&#x27;s military leadership once more. This anecdote, however, is discounted by Evans, who dismisses it as &quot;nothing more than a malicious rumour&quot; perhaps created by Rutilius Rufus or Sulla. Other scholars have argued that the mission was instead planned by the Senate with the support of the &quot;princeps senatus&quot; Marcus Aemilius Scaurus for the purpose of investigating Mithridates&#x27; campaigns in Cappadocia without arousing too much suspicion.

However, scholars have pointed out that Marius&#x27;s supposed &quot;humiliation&quot; cannot have been too long-lasting. In c. 98–97 BC, he was given the unprecedented honour of being elected &quot;in absentia&quot; to the college of priestly augurs whilst away in Asia Minor. Furthermore, Marius&#x27;s mere presence at the trial of Manius Aquillius in 98 BC, his friend and former colleague as consul in 101 BC, was enough to secure acquittal for the accused, even though he was apparently guilty. Marius also successfully acted as sole defence for T. Matrinius in 95 BC, an Italian from Spoletium who had been granted Roman citizenship by Marius and who was now being prosecuted under a new citizenship law.

===Social War===

While Marius was away in the east and after he returned, Rome had several years of relative peace. But in 95 BC, Rome passed a decree, the &quot;lex Licinia Mucia&quot;, expelling from the city all residents who were not Roman citizens. In 91 BC, Marcus Livius Drusus was elected tribune; he proposed a wide-ranging reform programme to support the plebs with land reform and grain distribution laws, grant citizenship to the Italians to compensate for land reform&#x27;s infringement on Italian property rights, and enlarge the senate with equestrians. Marius seemed not to have an opinion on Drusus&#x27;s Italian question. However, after Drusus was assassinated, many of the Italian states revolted against Rome in the Social War of 91–87 BC, named after the Latin word for allies, &quot;socii&quot;.

In the next campaigning year, Marius is listed as one of the senior legates of the consul Publius Rutilius Lupus, who was perhaps one of his relatives. Lupus fell to a Marsic ambush on 11 June 90 BC while crossing the river Tolenus; Marius, commanding a different wing of the army, was yet able to drive the enemy back with heavy losses. The senate, after Lupus&#x27; death, appointed Marius in joint command with the praetor Quintus Servilius Caepio; Caepio, however, quickly fell to perfidy, leaving Marius in sole command. After taking command over the northern front of the war, Marius moved energetically forward, defeating the Marsi with his former legate Sulla&#x27;s help on hilly ground south of the Fucine Lake; Herius Asinius, a praetor of the Marrucini, was among the slain. According to Plutarch, Marius then entered a state of inaction and refused to pursue – probably because he did not trust his men – which led Poppaedius Silo to challenge him: &quot;So if you are such a great general, Marius, why not come down [from your fortifications] and fight?&quot; To this Marius retorted, &quot;Well, if you think you are any good a general, why don&#x27;t you try to make me?&quot;

The next year saw Marius relieved by Lucius Porcius Cato, one of the consuls, and him excluded from command. We do not know why for sure he was not given another command: &quot;his age should been outweighed by his experience&quot;. It may be possible that Marius had relinquished command on account of illness or had been relieved under a perception of insufficient aggressiveness. The war was immensely hard fought but drew to an end within the next few years, as the Romans brought the lex Julia in 90 BC, granting citizenship to all the allies who were loyal or would otherwise promptly put down arms. Marius&#x27;s efforts in the conflict brought him few honours, though he served at a senior level and won at least a few victories. In all likelihood, this experience rekindled his desire for further commands and glory, embarking him upon a path towards seeking command in the east.

===Sulla and the First Civil War===

During the Social War, one of Marius&#x27;s clients and friends, Manius Aquillius, had apparently encouraged the kingdoms of Nicomedia and Bithynia to invade Pontus. In response King Mithridates of Pontus invaded both kingdoms as well as the Roman holdings in Asia (in present-day western Turkey). Defeating the meagre forces at Aquillius&#x27;s disposal, Mithridates marched across the Bosphorus and Aquillius retreated to Lesbos. With the Social War concluded and with the prospects of a glorious and fabulously rich conquest, there was significant competition in the consular elections for 88 BC. Eventually, Lucius Cornelius Sulla was elected consul, and received command of the army being sent to Pontus.

After news of Mithridates&#x27; actions reached Rome, Marius may have considered a seventh term as consul. A tribune, Publius Sulpicius Rufus, was also working on proposals to distribute the new Italian citizens into the thirty-five voting tribes. Marius was likely the one pushing for this most, while also positioning himself for a seventh consulship and – when bundled with Sulpicius&#x27;s other voting reforms – a long-lasting political base. Sulpicius&#x27;s proposals raised a furore in the forum, leading to a riot in which the consul – Sulla – was forced to shelter in Marius&#x27;s house, where a compromise was reached allowing the voting bill to pass through and for Sulla to prepare to go east.

After Sulla left Rome to prepare for his army in Nola to depart for the east, Sulpicius had his measures passed into law, and tacked on a rider which unprecedentedly appointed Marius – now a private citizen lacking any office in the Republic – to the command in Pontus. Marius then sent two of his legates to take the command from Sulla. These moves were foolish: Evans notes &quot;Marius&#x27;s political ingenuity seems to have deserted him&quot; and calls his actions rash. Sulla refused to relinquish his post, even though all but one of his own subordinates opposed Sulla&#x27;s course of action. After killing Marius&#x27;s legates, Sulla rallied his troops to his personal banner and called upon them to defend him against the insults of the Marian faction. The ancient sources say that Sulla&#x27;s soldiers pledged their loyalty because they were worried that they would be kept in Italy while Marius raised troops from his own veterans who would then proceed to plunder great riches. Marius&#x27;s faction sent two tribunes to Sulla&#x27;s legions in eastern Italy, but the tribunes were promptly murdered by Sulla&#x27;s troops.

Sulla then ordered his troops to begin a slow march on Rome. This was a momentous event, unforeseen by Marius, as no Roman army had ever marched upon Rome: it was forbidden by law and ancient tradition. Once it became obvious that Sulla was going to defy the law and seize Rome by force, Marius attempted to organize a defence of the city with gladiators. Unsurprisingly, Marius&#x27;s ad hoc force was no match for Sulla&#x27;s legions. Marius was defeated and fled the city. He narrowly escaped capture and death on several occasions and eventually found safety with his veterans in Africa. Sulla and his supporters in the Senate proscribed twelve men, and passed a death sentence on Marius, Marius&#x27;s son, Sulpicius and a few other allies. Sulpicius was executed but, according to Plutarch, many Romans disapproved of Sulla&#x27;s actions.

Some who opposed Sulla were elected to office in 87 BC – Gnaeus Octavius, a supporter of Sulla, and Lucius Cornelius Cinna, a supporter of Marius and member of Sulla&#x27;s extended family, were elected consuls – as Sulla wanted to demonstrate his republican &quot;bona fides&quot;. Regardless, Sulla was again confirmed as the commander of the campaign against Mithridates, so he took his legions out of Rome and marched east to war.

===Seventh consulship and death===
While Sulla was on campaign in Greece, fighting broke out between the conservative supporters of Sulla, led by Octavius, and the popular supporters of Cinna over voting rights for the Italians. When Cinna was forced to flee the city by Octavius&#x27;s gangs, he was able to rally significant Italian support: some 10 legions including the Samnites. Marius along with his son then returned from exile in Africa to Etruria with an army he had raised there, and they placed themselves under Cinna&#x27;s command to oust Octavius. Marius demanded the tribunes lift his banishment by passage of law. Cinna&#x27;s vastly superior army coerced the Senate into opening the gates of the city.

They entered Rome and started to purge a number of their opponents, including Octavius. Their heads were exhibited in the Forum. Fourteen of the victims, including six former consuls, were noteworthy individuals: Lucius Licinius Crassus (older brother of the triumvir), Gaius Atilius Serranus, Marcus Antonius Orator, Lucius Julius Caesar, his brother Caesar Strabo, Quintus Mucius Scaevola the Augur, Publius Cornelius Lentulus, Gaius Nemotorius, Gaius Baebius and Octavius Ruso. A number of those targeted by the purge were not immediately killed: show trials were set up before the victims committed suicide. Marius and Cinna also declared Sulla an enemy of the state and stripped him of his proconsular command in the east.

While Marius and Cinna were both responsible for the deaths and the headed pikes in the forum, it is unlikely that Marius and his men killed everyone in their paths, as reported in Cassius Dio and Plutarch. The killings, more likely, served to terrorise the political opposition. With competitors suitably frightened, show elections were held for 86 BC, with Marius and Cinna being elected by the irregularly. Within a fortnight of assuming the consulship for the seventh time, Marius was dead.

Plutarch relates several opinions on the end of Marius: one, from Posidonius, holds that Marius contracted pleurisy; Gaius Piso has it that Marius walked with his friends and discussed all of his accomplishments with them, adding that no intelligent man ought leave himself to fortune. Plutarch then anonymously relates that Marius, having gone into a fit of passion in which he announced in a delusionary manner that he was in command of the Mithridatic War, began to act as he would have on the field of battle; finally, Plutarch relates that, ever an ambitious man, Marius lamented on his deathbed that he had not achieved all of which he was capable, despite his having acquired great wealth and having been chosen consul more times than any man before him.

After his death, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, another patrician like Cinna, was elected as the sole candidate to succeed Marius as consul; Flaccus was dispatched immediately with two legions to fight Mithridates alongside (but not with) Sulla. While Marius is at times blamed for the purges, his sudden death more than likely was used to deflect blame, avoiding an actual change in policy. Cinna and one of his later consular colleagues, Carbo, would lead their faction into the civil war, which continued until their defeat (and that of Marius&#x27;s son) by Sulla&#x27;s army, eventually allowing Sulla to make himself dictator. 

==Legacy==

Marius was an extremely successful Roman general and politician. In ancient sources, he has been repeatedly characterised as having unending ambition and opportunism. Plutarch says of him:

if Marius could have been persuaded to sacrifice to the Greek Muses and Graces, he would not have put the ugliest possible crown upon a most illustrious career in field and forum, nor have been driven by the blasts of passion, ill-timed ambition, and insatiable greed upon the shore of a most cruel and savage old age.

According to Evans this characterisation is not entirely fair, because Marius&#x27;s attempts to win the consulship and for self-aggrandisement were not out of the norm for politicians of the middle to late Republic. Marius&#x27;s legacy is heavily defined by his example: his five successive consulships, while seen at the time as necessary for the survival of Roman civilisation, gave unprecedented power into the hands of a single man over a never-before-seen length of time.

However, that Marius died &quot;so hated by contemporaries is really rather unremarkable, because to his unrealistic, even senile, dreams of further triumphs may be laid the prime cause for the disastrous civil war of 87 [BC]... His unquenchable &quot;ambitio&quot; overcame an unusually astute sense of judgement; the result, the beginning of the Roman revolution&quot;. Broadly, &quot;traditional republican culture had been based on the principles of equality between colleagues in office and short terms of office holding... the inherited republic could not survive Marius and his ambitions&quot;.

=== Supposed reforms to the legions ===
In the narratives of Plutarch and Sallust, Marius&#x27;s reforms to the recruitment process for the Roman legions are roundly criticised for creating a soldiery wholly loyal to their generals and beholden to their beneficence or ability to secure payment from the state. However, Evans argues this development did not emerge from Marius, and it was likely initially envisioned as nothing more than a temporary measure to meet the extraordinary threats of Numidia and the Cimbrian tribes. Moreover, the armies in the late republic were broadly similar to those of the middle republic.

The willingness of the soldiers to kill fellow Romans changed after the Social War: &quot;if Sulla&#x27;s army had been unwilling to march on Rome... then the outcome would obviously have been completely different, no matter how power-hungry Marius or Sulla were&quot;. The Social War had the related effect of breaking down the Roman government&#x27;s legitimacy. Lintott, in the &quot;Cambridge Ancient History&quot;, similarly writes that &quot;Roman armies were only to be used for civil war after their scruples had been drowned in a blood-bath of fighting with their own Italian allies... it may as well be argued that civil war created the self-seeking unprincipled soldier&quot;.

There were political effects, however, to the promise of land after service: the decision to call up the would not be fully felt until the time to draw down the troops. As the spoils of war became increasingly inadequate as compensation for the soldiers – the spoils of war do not guarantee a long term stream of income – it became common practice to allocate land (generally abroad) for the foundation of veterans&#x27; colonies. Political unrest over veterans&#x27; land bonuses in the first century BC, however, is exaggerated: soldiers both in the Marian and post-Marian periods largely went home peacefully when land demands were not immediately met. Moreover, through the post-Marian period, land distributions were sporadic and volunteers were taken on with no promises or reasonable expectations of land at discharge. It was only by the second half of the last century BC that veteran demands for land had become an expectation, later fulfilled by the Second Triumvirate.

=== Assemblies and foreign affairs ===
Marius&#x27;s repeated use of the Assemblies to overturn Senatorial commands had significant negative effects on the stability of the state. The senate generally used sortition to choose generals for command posts, removing the conflict of interest between consuls. Marius&#x27;s use of the Assemblies to remove Metellus from command in Numidia spelled an end to collective governance in foreign affairs. In later years, use of became the main means by which commands were granted to other generals, adding to personal rivalries and diminishing the ability to govern the state. The size of the rewards gained from manipulating the Assemblies was irresistible to future generations of ambitious politicians.

The similar use of the Assemblies in an attempt to replace Sulla with Marius for the Mithridatic War was unprecedented, as never before had laws been passed to confer commands on someone lacking any official title in the state. Marius&#x27;s legal strategy misfired disastrously because he failed to predict Sulla&#x27;s reaction of marching on the city to protect his command:

It was plainly expected that Sulpicius&#x27;s bill and the sanctity of the law, even if much abused, would be obeyed without question... Sulla&#x27;s unforeseen rejection of the &#x27;popular&#x27; will, which he must surely have believed to have been of equivocal legality, was made from a position of great strength since he had the means and the opportunity to impose his will on the situation.

=== Political violence ===
While political violence had been increasingly normalised throughout the middle and late Republic, starting with the murder of the Gracchi brothers, the passage of the against Saturninus and Glaucia in Marius&#x27;s sixth consulship normalised the use of force not only against private citizens, but also &quot;against properly elected magistrates in order to preserve [the Senate&#x27;s] own position&quot;. 

Moreover, Marius&#x27;s attempts to undermine Sulla&#x27;s command at the start of the First Mithridatic War massively expanded the scope of that violence. No longer would only mobs clash in the streets of Rome. No longer would personal grudges be pursued by mere political prosecutions in the courts: political enemies would be killed. The use of the Assemblies eroded senatorial control which, along with Sulla&#x27;s decision to march on Rome, created significant and prolonged instability, only resolved by the destruction of the Republican form of government and the transition to Empire.

<text>Windows Metafile (WMF) is an image file format originally designed for Microsoft Windows in the 1990s. The original Windows Metafile format was not device-independent (though could be made more so with placement headers) and may contain both vector graphics and bitmap components. It acts in a similar manner to SVG files. WMF files were later superseded by Enhanced Metafiles (EMF files) which did provide for device-independence. EMF files were then themselves enhanced via EMF+ files.

Essentially, a metafile stores a list of records consisting of drawing commands, property definitions and graphics objects to display an image on screen. The drawing commands used are closely related to the commands of the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) API used for drawing in Microsoft Windows.

There are three major types of metafiles – a WMF is a 16-bit format introduced in Windows 3.0. It is the native vector format for Microsoft Office applications such as Word, PowerPoint, and Publisher. , revision 18 of the Windows Metafile Format specification is available. EMF files, which replaced WMF files, work on the same principle only it is a 32-bit file format that also allows for the embedding of private data within &quot;comment&quot; records. EMF+ is an extension to EMF files and embedded in these comment records, allowing for images and text using commands, objects and properties that are similar to Windows GDI+.

==History==
The original 16 bit WMF file format was fully specified in volume 4 of the 1992 Windows 3.1 SDK documentation (at least if combined with the descriptions of the individual functions and structures in the other volumes), but that specification was vague about a few details. These manuals were published as printed books available in bookstores with no click through EULA or other unusual licensing restrictions (just a general warning that if purchased as part of a software bundle, the software would be subject to one).

Over time the existence of that historic specification was largely forgotten and some alternative implementations resorted to reverse engineering to figure out the file format from existing WMF files, which was difficult and error prone. In September 2006, Microsoft again published the WMF file format specification in a more complete form in the context of the Microsoft Open Specification Promise, promising to not assert patent rights to file format implementors.

Microsoft later deprecated WMF files in favour of 32-bit EMF files as WMF files had real issues with device independence, despite the use of a &quot;placeable&quot; file header which provided basic device independence. Microsoft found that developers who use the format were &quot;[embedding] application, location, or scaling comments in the metafiles... Others added headers to the metafile that provided various application-specific information&quot;, causing major compatibility issues. Thus, in 1992 with Windows NT 3.1, Microsoft introduced the Enhanced Metafile format (EMF) — a format which was based on the Win32 API and with which they built-in device independence. — these were also known as NT metafiles. With the release of Windows XP and GDI+, the set of records had to be significantly increased and so Microsoft released EMF+ as an extension to the existing EMF file format.

==Metafile structure==

WMF, EMF and EMF+ files all consist of a series of records that are played back to produce graphical output. Some records define objects which can specify graphical objects used to determine how graphics should be drawn (e.g. pens specify the color and width of lines). Each of these objects are stored in metafiles and are placed into an object table, which tracks the usage of graphic objects while processing the metafile. The object table is an associative array of indexes to graphical object structures defined within the metafile.

WMF and EMF files handle object processing differently to EMF+ records in EMF files. As a WMF and EMF file is being processed, the records are read into an object table once an object is defined. If an object is deleted then the object is released from the table and the identifier can be reused. Notably an object will not be used until it is specifically selected during record playback. This differs for EMF+ files, which also use an associative array via a hashmap which records the object along with an object identifier. However, unlike WMF and EMF files which can delete an object, when a new object is created that has the same index as an existing object, the entry in the table is replaced with the new object. An EMF file also does not need to specifically select an object before it is used.

===WMF===


WMF files were not originally designed to be device independent, meaning that a file could not be played back on output devices that differed from the original device on which the file was recorded. A partial solution to this issue was invented by Aldus Corporation, who added an additional &quot;placeable&quot; header, called the &quot;APM header&quot;, which added a bounding rectangle, a metafile version, metafile size, number of objects in the metafile and the size of the largest single record in the metafile. This was later incorporated into the WMF format by Microsoft, starting in Windows 2000.

WMF files are structured by a series of records, starting with a number of control records: the header record, the aforementioned optional placeable record, and finished by an end of file record.

Encapsulated by the control records are the records that make up the image itself. These records work within what is known as the &quot;playback device context&quot;, which is the collection of properties and objects that make up a device&#x27;s graphical environment as the metafile is being &quot;played back&quot; onto this output device.

Records other than control records can be largely grouped into bitmap records, drawing records, object records, state records and escape records.

====Bitmap records====

Bitmap records manage and output bitmap images.

====Drawing records====
Drawing records produce graphics output.

====Object records====
Object records create and manage graphics objects. In WMF files there are two broad categories of objects – graphics objects and structure objects. Structure objects are not explicitly created or deleted in a WMF, they are instead of complex structures. For example, the BitmapCoreHeader contains information about the dimensions and color format of a device-independent bitmap, which is itself part of a DeviceIndependentBitmap object. A graphics object, however, specifies parameters for graphics output and during playback of the WMF it sets up the playback device context.

Graphics objects can be &quot;brushes&quot; (defines the style, color and pattern of a brush which defines how to paint an area of the graphic), &quot;fonts&quot; (defines properties that affect how text is displayed), &quot;palettes&quot; (specifies colors as device-independent values, defined by an application), &quot;pens&quot; (specifies the graphical attributes of a line), and &quot;regions&quot; (which specify line and curve segments that define a shape).

====State records====
State records manage the graphics properties of the playback device context.

====Escape records====

Escape records are a means to extend metafile functionality via records that are not otherwise defined as a WMF record type. Each escape record contains a record function, an escape function and potentially escape data.

The following escape records make up a WMF file.

There was a major vulnerability found in escape records around the Abort escape record, which stores the abort procedure code within the record itself. This affected Windows systems (see ) and the Wine project (see ). According to Secunia, &quot;The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the handling of Windows Metafile files (&#x27;.wmf&#x27;) containing specially crafted SETABORTPROC &#x27;Escape&#x27; records. Such records allow arbitrary user-defined function to be executed when the rendering of a WMF file fails.&quot; According to the Windows 3.1 SDK documentation, the SETABORTPROC escape was obsoleted and replaced by the function of the same name in Windows 3.1, long before the WMF vulnerability was discovered. However the obsoleted escape code was retained for compatibility with 16 bit programs written for (or at least backwards compatible with) Windows 3.0. This change happened at approximately the same time as Microsoft was creating the 32 bit reimplementation of GDI for Windows NT, and it is likely that the vulnerability occurred during this effort.

After Steve Gibson accused Microsoft of deliberately implementing a backdoor into their code, Mark Russinovich provided a rebuttal, and stated that:

Peter Ferrie of Symantec Security Response, USA also disagreed with Gibson, noting that:

===EMF===

EMF files have three possible versions of headers. The original headers is just a container for images, the second and third version encapsulates the original header and contains a pixel format record and support for OpenGL records, and the third version encapsulates the second header extension and increases EMF accuracy and scalability of EMFs as it adds the ability to measure distances of device surfaces using the metric system.

Each EMF header starts with an EMR_HEADER record, and records the relevant properties of the device on which the metafile image was recorded. The original EMF header has an 80 byte header and an optional variable length description string. Other metafiles contain extension fields, which encapsulate the original header. codice_1 is a record that is inserted directly after the original EMF header, specifies whether there is a pixel format descriptor and the offset to the descriptor object within the header, as well as a field that specifies if OpenGL records exist in the metafile. The pixel format descriptor specifies the capabilities of the drawing surface and whether a pixel is encoded in RGBA or is an index into a color table. codice_2 is a record that is inserted directly after the codice_1 record, and it contains two fields with the X and Y values to measure the device surface in micrometers.

Like WMF files, records can be classified by function, however there are more record types in EMF files than there are in WMF files. Records can be classified as control, bitmap, clipping, comment, drawing, escape, object creation, object manipulation, OpenGL, path bracket, state and transform records.

===EMF+===

With the release of Windows XP, the &quot;Enhanced Metafile Format Plus Extensions&quot; (EMF+) format was introduced. EMF+ provides a way to serialize calls to the GDI+ API in the same way that WMF/EMF stores calls to GDI.

There are also compressed versions of Windows Metafiles known as &quot;Compressed Windows Metafile&quot; (WMZ) and &quot;Compressed Windows Enhanced Metafile&quot; (EMZ), which are basically gzip compressed WMF and EMF files correspondingly.

== Implementations ==

The WMF format was designed to be executed by the Windows GDI layer in order to restore the image, but as the WMF binary files contain the definition of the GDI graphic primitives that constitute this image, it is possible to design alternative libraries that render WMF binary files or convert them into other graphic formats.

<doc id="81675" wikidata="Q3444141" url="?curid=81675" title="Saint Vincent College">
<text>Saint Vincent College is a private Catholic, Benedictine college in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1846 by Boniface Wimmer, a monk from Bavaria, it is operated by the Benedictine Monks of Saint Vincent Archabbey, the first Benedictine monastery in the United States, which was also founded by Wimmer.

==History==
Saint Vincent Archabbey and College was founded in 1846 by Boniface Wimmer, a monk from Metten Abbey in Bavaria. On April 18, 1870, the Pennsylvania state legislature incorporated the school as a college, Saint Vincent College. On January 28, 1963 a fire destroyed many of the buildings on campus including a student chapel and a bell tower. Saint Vincent College became coeducational in 1983. In 2021, the college, along with the archabbey, seminary, and parish, observed the 175th anniversary of its founding.

===Presidents===
The current president of the college is Paul R. Taylor. He was announced as the 18th president of Saint Vincent College on June 14, 2019, in a press conference at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, while his official tenure began on July 1, 2019. Taylor had previously served as the college&#x27;s executive vice president from 2012 to 2019, while also having worked as vice president of institutional advancement and director of financial aid and admissions.

Taylor succeeded Norman W. Hipps who served as the 17th president of Saint Vincent College from 2010 to 2019.

Previous presidents of the college are:
* Boniface Wimmer (1871–1887)
* Andrew Hintenach (1887–1892)

* Paul R. Taylor (2019–)

==Academics==
Saint Vincent is organized into four schools; each includes several departments and major and minor programs offering undergraduate or graduate degrees, as well as special programs and public service outreach activities. Each school has its own Dean who works closely with students, faculty, and prospective students and a Council of Advisors composed of representatives of business, industry, and academia to advise and direct policy and programs.

===Alex G. McKenna School of Business, Economics, and Government===
This school was formed in 2001. It includes the departments of Business; Criminology, Law and Society, and Politics and Public Affairs. The school&#x27;s majors include Accounting; Business Education; Criminology, Law and Society; Economics; Entrepreneurship; Finance; International Business; Management; Marketing; Politics and Political Science; and Public Policy. The McKenna School also includes master&#x27;s programs in Criminology and Management: Operational Excellence.

===School of Social Sciences, Communication, and Education===
The school was formed in 2004. It includes the departments of Communication, Criminology, Education, Psychology, and Sociology/Anthropology. Associated with the school are the Saint Vincent College Drug and Alcohol Prevention Projects and the Fred M. Rogers Institute for Early Learning and Children&#x27;s Media.

===School of Humanities and Fine Arts===
The school was formed in 2004. It contains the departments and programs of English, Fine Arts (Art and Music), History, Liberal Arts, Modern and Classical Languages, Philosophy, and Theology. The Saint Vincent Gallery and the college&#x27;s Stage and Theatre programs are part of this school, in addition to numerous student music ensembles including The Saint Vincent College Singers, The March of the Bearcats Marching Band, as well as Pep Band, Concert Band, Jazz Band, and Percussion Ensemble.
===The Herbert W. Boyer School of Natural Science, Mathematics, and Computing===
The school was formed in 2004 and includes the departments of Biology, Chemistry, Computing and Information Science, Engineering, Mathematics, and Physics. Majors are also offered in Biochemistry, Bioinformatics, and Environmental Science. Teacher certification may be obtained in biology, chemistry, environmental education, mathematics, and physics. Cooperative programs with other institutions of higher education enable students to pursue degrees in specific engineering fields, actuarial science, nursing, occupational therapy, pharmacy, physical therapy, and physician assistant.

In addition to its general engineering degree, the college offers a five-year cooperative liberal arts and engineering program. Students spend three years at St. Vincent, fulfilling core requirements and prerequisites for an engineering major, then two years at the engineering college. Upon completion of this coursework students are guaranteed acceptance at Penn State University, the University of Pittsburgh and The Catholic University of America. Under this program, the student receives a Bachelor of Arts degree from St. Vincent and a Bachelor of Science degree from the engineering college.

In 2019 the college entered an agreement with Carlow University to offer a degree in Nursing on Saint Vincent&#x27;s campus. Students in this program remain enrolled at Saint Vincent for two years and then transfer to Carlow for the remaining two years of nursing courses and students ultimately receive a Carlow nursing degree. However, all courses and labs are administered at Saint Vincent and students remain in Latrobe throughout their degree.

==Athletics==
St. Vincent has intercollegiate teams, known as Bearcats, in women&#x27;s bowling, football, baseball, softball, volleyball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, track, and tennis. The college is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Almost all teams compete in the NCAA Division III Presidents&#x27; Athletic Conference (PAC). Two sports that are not sponsored by the PAC have other affiliations. In bowling, a sport with a single championship for all three NCAA divisions, the Bearcats compete in the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference (AMCC). The newest varsity sport of men&#x27;s volleyball, introduced for the 2020 season (2019–20 school year), is playing its first season as a Division III independent until joining the AMCC for the 2021 season and beyond. The school also offers men&#x27;s ice hockey and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rugby as club sports. The college also has an equestrian team that competes in the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association. One Saint Vincent basketball player, Daniel Santiago, has played in the NBA.

The athletic colors are green and gold.

===Pittsburgh Steelers training camp===
Since 1966, the college has served as the training camp host of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Before 1966, the team practiced at various locations around Pennsylvania and out of state including the University of Rhode Island. In 1963, the campus was damaged by a large fire and during the rebuilding, more buildings were added to the campus to provide more housing for players. Rooney Hall, completed in 1995, is a residence hall that is used by the Steelers during their stay on campus each summer. It is named in honor of the Steelers&#x27; founder, Arthur J. Rooney Sr.

Peter King of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; said about Chuck Noll Field, the site of training camp, &quot;I love the place. It&#x27;s the perfect training camp setting, looking out over the rolling hills of the Laurel Highlands in west-central Pennsylvania, an hour east of Pittsburgh. On a misty or foggy morning, standing atop the hill at the college, you feel like you&#x27;re in Scotland. Classic, wonderful slice of Americana. If you can visit one training camp, this is the one to see.&quot;&quot;

===Other sports===
The main athletic center is the Robert S. Carey Student Center. It was formerly known as Sportsman&#x27;s Hall, after the original name of St. Vincent Parish, and Kennedy Hall, after President John F. Kennedy, who received an honorary degree of law on February 4, 1958. It contains a gymnasium, swimming pool, student union, and fitness center.

In 2011, the Bearcat basketball team, led by All-American Brittany Sedlock, became the first team in school history to qualify for the NCAA Division-III postseason since the school made the move from the NAIA. Ranked among the top-20 nationally throughout the season, the Bearcats were defeated in their opening-round National Tournament game by Greensboro College. The women&#x27;s basketball team overcame a major tragedy during the 2010–11 season with the Christmas Day 2010 death of Kristen Zawacki (1958–2010), the lone women&#x27;s basketball coach in the program&#x27;s 25-year history. Zawacki, also the school&#x27;s associate athletic director, won over 500 games in her career. She was succeeded by assistant coach Jimmy Petruska, who was named interim coach immediately following her death, before being officially named the team&#x27;s head coach on April 27, 2011. During his eight-year tenure, Petruska&#x27;s teams have qualified for the NCAA Division III playoffs three times, highlighted by a 2018–19 season in which the Bearcats finished 23-5 overall and 15–1 in conference to earn their first PAC title.

In 2016, the Saint Vincent men&#x27;s basketball team earned their fourth straight Presidents&#x27; Athletic Conference Tournament Championship by defeating Thomas More College 65–62 to advance to the NCAA National Tournament and advancing to the NCAA Tournament for the fourth straight season.

On June 27, 2017, the school named Brian Niemiec the head coach of the men&#x27;s tennis team. In doing so, Niemiec became what is thought to be the youngest head coach of an NCAA team at the age of 21 years, 10 months, and 9 days.

The Saint Vincent women&#x27;s lacrosse team, coached by Jym Walters, boasts the top scorer in NCAA Division III history. As a senior in 2018, Maggie Nelson set Division III records with 141 goals and 178 points. During her senior campaign, Nelson scored 10 or more goals in 11 different games, while her 19 points (11 goals, 8 assists) in an April 11 win over Chatham University were also the most in a single game in NCAA D-III history. Nelson was featured in Sports Illustrated&#x27;s &quot;Faces in the Crowd&quot; on May 18, 2018. After the 2019 season, Nelson&#x27;s 496 career points rank second all-time in NCAA Division III history.

==Controversies==

===Jim Towey===

During Jim Towey&#x27;s four-year tenure as president, he stressed a more traditional Catholic identity. Towey attracted two high-profile commencement speakers: U.S. President George W. Bush in 2007 and Mike Tomlin, coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2008. During this same time Towey encountered opposition from some of the faculty. While Towey attributed much of the dissension to his lack of experience in academia and to faculty unaccustomed to rapid change, in 2008 three-quarters of the school&#x27;s tenured faculty signed a letter stating that several decisions made by Towey had caused a major crisis at the college. More than two years later, Towey left Saint Vincent College; he was named president of Ave Maria University in July 2011.

=== Mark Gruber ===

In November 2009 Mark Gruber, a Benedictine priest and faculty member who opposed Towey&#x27;s reforms, was accused by the college administration of sexual misconduct. Gruber admitted under oath that he created pornographic materials on a college computer and e-mailed the images. On July 2, 2012, Catholic Church officials confirmed that &quot;Gruber has been found guilty of the delicts (canonical crimes) of possession of child pornography; production of materials which gravely injure good morals; abuse of the Sacrament of Confession (but not a violation of the sacramental seal); and defamation of a legitimate superior.&quot; In July 2013 he was relieved of his monastic and priestly duties.

=== Alcuin Hall renaming ===
In 2018, Saint Vincent renamed a building on campus, after sexual abuse allegations were revealed about an early dean of the college. The former Alcuin Hall was renamed the Student Activity Center. The name changed after the St. Vincent Archabbey released a list on August 16, 2018, of a dozen Benedictines against whom credible allegations of sexual abuse had been made. That list included the Rev. Alcuin Tasch, whom the building was named after when it was completed in 1964.

==Basilica==
Saint Vincent Parish was founded in 1790. It was the first Catholic parish in Pennsylvania west of the Allegheny Mountains. Father Theodore Brouwers, O.F.M., purchased of land called &quot;Sportsmen&#x27;s Hall Tract.&quot; A church was built and dedicated on July 19, 1835. It was named after St. Vincent de Paul, whose feast day is July 19 (Roman Calendar, 1737–1969) and September 27.

The cornerstone of the basilica was laid in 1892, and the consecration took place on August 24, 1905. The basilica was completely restored in 1996, as part of the 150th anniversary of the founding of the college.
==Traditions==
Each year, on the Thursday before Thanksgiving, the Saint Vincent Community celebrates Founders Day, honoring all those who founded the college and have been a part of its community since its inception. The day features Honors Convocation (held in the Archabbey Basilica), a candle-lit turkey dinner in the gym, Zambelli fireworks, and the campus light-up, featuring lighted arches in Melvin Platz where the school&#x27;s Concert Band performs Christmas-themed repertoire.

The Saint Vincent College fight song, &quot;Forward, Saint Vincent,&quot; was approved by the college&#x27;s student government in 1996 and was written by Jen Waldmann, Heather Fields, and Chris Rodkey. The title, &quot;Forward, Saint Vincent,&quot; refers to a quotation from the school&#x27;s founder, Boniface Wimmer: &quot;Forward, always forward, everywhere forward! We must not be held back by debts, bad years, or by difficulties of the times. Man&#x27;s adversity is God&#x27;s opportunity.&quot; The fight song is performed by The March of the Bearcats Marching Band, along with other pep tunes at both football and basketball games.

There is a network of tunnels consisting of storage areas, maintenance rooms, and steam tunnels which runs underneath the Saint Vincent College campus. It is an unofficial tradition for students to enter and explore these tunnels.

<doc id="81677" wikidata="Q212943" url="?curid=81677" title="Pontifex maximus">
<text>The  (Latin for &quot;supreme pontiff&quot;) was the chief high priest of the College of Pontiffs (&quot;Collegium Pontificum&quot;) in ancient Rome. This was the most important position in the ancient Roman religion, open only to patricians until 254 BC, when a plebeian first held this position. Although in fact the most powerful office in the Roman priesthood, the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was officially ranked fifth in the ranking of the highest Roman priests (&quot;Ordo Sacerdotum&quot;), behind the &quot;Rex Sacrorum&quot; and the &quot;flamines maiores&quot; (&quot;Flamen Dialis&quot;, &quot;Flamen Martialis&quot;, &quot;Flamen Quirinalis&quot;).

A distinctly religious office under the early Roman Republic, it gradually became politicized until, beginning with Augustus, it was subsumed into the position of emperor in the Roman imperial period. Subsequent emperors were styled &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; well into Late Antiquity, including Gratian (), but during Gratian&#x27;s reign the phrase was replaced in imperial titulature with the (&quot;honourable pontiff&quot;), an example followed by Gratian&#x27;s junior co-emperor Theodosius the Great and which was used by emperors thereafter including the &quot;co&quot;-&quot;augusti&quot; Valentinian III (), Marcian () and the &quot;augustus&quot; Anastasius Dicorus (). The first to adopt the &quot;inclytus&quot; alternative to &quot;maximus&quot; may have been the rebel &quot;augustus&quot; Magnus Maximus ().

The word &quot;pontifex&quot; and its derivative &quot;pontiff&quot; became terms used for Christian bishops, including the Bishop of Rome. The title of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was applied to the Roman Catholic Church for the pope as its chief bishop and appears on buildings, monuments and coins of popes of Renaissance and modern times. The official list of titles of the pope given in the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; includes &quot;supreme pontiff&quot; () as the fourth title, the first being &quot;bishop of Rome&quot;.

==Etymology==

The etymology of &quot;pontifex&quot; is uncertain, but the word has been used since Roman times. The word appears to consist of the Latin word for &quot;bridge&quot; and the suffix for &quot;maker&quot;. However, there is a possibility that this definition is a folk etymology for an Etruscan term, since Roman religion was heavily influenced by Etruscan religion, and little is known about the Etruscan language, which is not Indo-European and thus has different origins from Latin.

According to the common interpretation, the term &quot;pontifex&quot; means &quot;bridge-builder&quot; (&quot;pons&quot; + &quot;facere&quot;); &quot;maximus&quot; means &quot;greatest&quot;. This was perhaps originally meant in a literal sense: the position of bridge-builder was indeed an important one in Rome, where the major bridges were over the Tiber, the sacred river (and a deity): only prestigious authorities with sacral functions could be allowed to &quot;disturb&quot; it with mechanical additions. However, it was always understood in its symbolic sense as well: the pontifices were the ones who smoothed the &quot;bridge&quot; between gods and men.

The interpretation of the word &quot;pontifex&quot; as &quot;bridge-builder&quot; was that of Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Marcus Terentius Varro. Plutarch pointed out that the term existed before there were any bridges in Rome and derived the word from Old Latin &quot;pontis&quot; meaning a powerful or absolute master, while others derived it from &quot;potis facere&quot; in the sense of &quot;able to sacrifice&quot;. The last derivation is mentioned also by Varro, who rejected it, but it was the view of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; Quintus Scaevola. Others have held that the word was originally &quot;pompifex&quot; (leader of public processions). The word &quot;pons&quot; originally meant &quot;way&quot; and &quot;pontifex&quot; would thus mean &quot;maker of roads and bridges.&quot;

Another opinion is that the word is a corruption of a similar-sounding but etymologically unrelated Etruscan word. Yet another hypothesis considers the word as a loan from the Sabine language, in which it would mean a member of a college of five, from Osco-Umbrian &quot;ponte&quot;, five. This explanation takes into account that the college was established by Sabine king Numa Pompilius and the institution is Italic: the expressions &quot;pontis&quot; and &quot;pomperias&quot; found in the Iguvine Tablets may denote a group or division of five or by five. The pontifex would thence be a member of a sacrificial college known as &quot;pomperia&quot; (Latin &quot;quinio&quot;).

The Roman title &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was rendered in Greek inscriptions and literature of the time as or by a more literal translation and order of words as . The term is used in the Greek Septuagint text of the Old Testament and in the New Testament to refer to the High Priest of Israel, including in 2 Maccabees ().

The word &quot;pontifex&quot;, Latin for &quot;pontiff,&quot; was used in ancient Rome to designate a member of the College of Pontiffs. In the Latin Vulgate translation of the New Testament, it is sometimes used to designate the Jewish high priest, as in the &quot;Gospel of John&quot; and &quot;Epistle to the Hebrews&quot; (; ). From perhaps as early as the 3rd century, it has been used to denote a Christian bishop. In the Vulgate, the term was originally applied to the High Priest of Israel, as in the &quot;Book of Judith&quot; (), whose place, each in his own diocese, the Christian bishops were regarded as holding, based on an interpretation of the &quot;First Epistle of Clement&quot; (I Clement 40).

==Origins of the Regal period==
The &quot;Collegium Pontificum&quot; (College of Pontiffs) was the most important priesthood of ancient Rome. The foundation of this sacred college and the office of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; is attributed to the second king of Rome, Numa Pompilius. Much of what is known about the Regal period in Roman history is semi-legendary or mythical. The &quot;Collegium&quot; presumably acted as advisers to the &quot;rex&quot; (king) in religious matters. The &quot;collegium&quot; was headed by the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, and all the &quot;pontifices&quot; held their office for life. But the pontifical records of early Rome were most likely destroyed when the city was sacked by the Gauls in 387 BC, and the earliest accounts of Archaic Rome come from the literature of the Republic, most of it from the 1st century BC and later.

According to the Augustan-era historian Livy, Numa Pompilius, a Sabine, devised Rome&#x27;s system of religious rites, including the manner and timing of sacrifices, the supervision of religious funds, authority over all public and private religious institutions, instruction of the populace in the celestial and funerary rites including appeasing the dead, and expiation of prodigies. Numa is said to have founded Roman religion after dedicating an altar on the Aventine Hill to Jupiter Elicius and consulting the gods by means of augury. Numa wrote down and sealed these religious instructions, and gave them to the first &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, Numa Marcius.

==Roman Republic==
In the Roman Republic, the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was the highest office in the state religion of ancient Rome and directed the College of Pontiffs. According to Livy, after the overthrow of the monarchy, the Romans created the priesthood of the &quot;rex sacrorum&quot;, or &quot;king of sacred rites,&quot; to carry out certain religious duties and rituals previously performed by the king. The &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; was explicitly deprived of military and political power, but the &quot;pontifices&quot; were permitted to hold both magistracies and military commands.

The official residence of the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was the &quot;Domus Publica&quot; (&quot;State House&quot;) which stood between the House of the Vestal Virgins and the Via Sacra, close to the Regia, in the Roman Forum. His religious duties were carried out from the Regia. Unless the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was also a magistrate, he was not allowed to wear the &quot;toga praetexta&quot;, i.e. toga with the purple border. In artistic representations, he can be recognized by his holding an iron knife &quot;(secespita)&quot; or the &quot;patera&quot;, and the distinctive robes or toga with part of the mantle covering the head &quot;(capite velato)&quot;, in keeping with Roman practice.

In practice, particularly during the late Republic, the office of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was generally held by a member of a politically prominent family. It was a coveted position mainly for the great prestige it conferred on the holder. Julius Caesar became pontifex in 73 BC and &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; in 63 BC.

The major Republican source on the pontiffs would have been the theological writings of Varro, which survive only in fragments preserved by later authors such as Aulus Gellius and Nonius Marcellus. Other sources are Cicero, Livy, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Valerius Maximus, Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Numa Pompilius&quot;, Festus&#x27;s summaries of Verrius Flaccus, and in later writers, including several of the Church Fathers. Some of these sources present an extensive list of everyday prohibitions for the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;; it seems difficult to reconcile these lists with evidence that many &quot;pontifices maximi&quot; were prominent members of society who lived normal lives.

===Election and number===
The number of Pontifices, elected by &quot;co-optatio&quot; (i.e. the remaining members nominate their new colleague) for life, was originally five, including the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;. The &quot;pontifices&quot;, moreover, could only come from the old nobility. In effect, this was only members of the patrician class. However, in 300–299 BC the &quot;lex Ogulnia&quot; opened the office of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; to public election and permitted the &quot;plebs&quot; (plebeians) to be co-opted as priests, so that part of the exclusivity of the title was lost. But it was only in 254 BC that Tiberius Coruncanius became the first plebeian &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;.

The &quot;lex Ogulnia&quot; also increased the number of pontiffs to nine (the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; included). In 104 BC the &quot;lex Domitia&quot; prescribed that the election of all pontiffs would henceforward be voted by the &quot;comitia tributa&quot; (an assembly of the people divided into voting districts); by the same law only 17 tribes, chosen by lot from the 35 tribes of the city, could vote. The law&#x27;s promulgator, L[ucius] Domitius Ahenobarbus, was shortly afterwards elected pontifex maximus after the death of the incumbent Metellus Dalmaticus: Something of a personal revenge because, the previous year, he had expected to be co-opted as a pontiff to replace his late father, but the pontifical college had appointed another candidate in his place. The office&#x27;s next holder, Q[uintus] Mucius Scaevola, was also elected under the same law, though without controversy or opposition since he was a former consul and long-serving pontiff.

This law was abolished in 81 BC by Sulla in his dictatorship, in the &quot;lex Cornelia de Sacerdotiis&quot;, which restored to the great priestly colleges their full right of &quot;co-optatio&quot;. Also under Sulla, the number of pontifices was increased to fifteen, the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; included, and Sulla appointed Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius as the next holder of the office – the only truly unelected &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; in history, since even the other pontiffs did not get a vote in the matter.

In 63 BC, the law of Sulla was abolished by the tribune Titus Labienus, and a modified form of the &quot;lex Domitia&quot; was reinstated providing for election by &quot;comitia tributa&quot; once again: Gaius Julius Caesar followed Ahenobarbus&#x27;s precedent by being elected by public vote, although Caesar at least had previously been a pontiff. Marcus Antonius later restored the right of &quot;co-optatio&quot; to the college, in time for the election of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Also under Julius Caesar, the number of pontifices were increased to sixteen, the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; included. (Possibly because Caesar&#x27;s own long absences from Rome necessitated the appointment of a deputy pontiff for those occasions when fifteen needed to be present.) The number of pontifices varied during the Empire but is believed to have been regular at fifteen.

===Extraordinary appointment of dictators===
The office came into its own with the abolition of the monarchy, when most sacral powers previously vested in the King were transferred either to the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; or to the Rex Sacrorum, though traditionally a (non-political) dictator was formally mandated by the Senate for one day, to perform a specific rite.

According to Livy in his &quot;History of Rome,&quot; an ancient instruction written in archaic letters commands: &quot;Let him who is the Praetor Maximus fasten a nail on the Ides of September.&quot; This notice was fastened on the right side of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, next to the chapel of Minerva. This nail is said to have marked the number of the year.

It was in accordance with this direction that the consul Horatius dedicated the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in the year following the expulsion of the kings; from the Consuls the ceremony of fastening the nails passed to the Dictators, because they possessed greater authority. As the custom had been subsequently dropped, it was felt to be of sufficient importance to require the appointment of a dictator. L[ucius] Manlius was accordingly nominated but his appointment was due to political rather than religious reasons. He was eager to command in the war with the Hernici. He caused an anger among the men liable to serve by the inconsiderate way in which he conducted the enrolment. In consequence of the unanimous resistance offered by the tribunes of the plebs, he gave way, either voluntarily or through compulsion, and laid down his dictatorship. Since then, this rite was performed by the Rex Sacrorum.

====Duties====
The main duty of the Pontifices was to maintain the &quot;pax deorum&quot; or &quot;peace of the gods.&quot;

The immense authority of the sacred college of pontiffs was centered on the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, the other pontifices forming his &quot;consilium&quot; or advising body. His functions were partly sacrificial or ritualistic, but these were the least important. His real power lay in the administration of &quot;ius divinum&quot; or divine law; the information collected by the pontifices related to the Roman religious tradition was bound in a &quot;corpus&quot; which summarized dogma and other concepts.

The chief departments of &quot;jus divinum&quot; may be described as follows:
# The regulation of all expiatory ceremonials needed as a result of pestilence, lightning, etc.
# The consecration of all temples and other sacred places and objects dedicated to the gods.
# The regulation of the calendar; both astronomically and in detailed application to the public life of the state.
# The administration of the law relating to burials and burying-places, and the worship of the &quot;manes&quot; or dead ancestors.
# The superintendence of all marriages by &quot;confarreatio&quot;, i.e. originally of all legal patrician marriages.
# The administration of the law of adoption and of testamentary succession.
# The regulation of the public morals, and fining and punishing offending parties.
# The selection of Vestal Virgins.

The pontifices had many relevant and prestigious functions such as being in charge of caring for the state archives, the keeping the official minutes of elected magistrates, the list of magistrates, and they kept the records of their own decisions (&quot;commentarii&quot;) and of the chief events of each year, the so-called &quot;public diaries&quot;, the .

The &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was also subject to several taboos. Among them was the prohibition to leave Italy. Plutarch described Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio (141–132 BC) as the first to leave Italy, after being forced by the Senate to do so, and thus break the sacred taboo. Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus (132–130 BC) was the first to leave Italy voluntarily. Afterwards it became common and no longer against the law for the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; to leave Italy. Among the most notable of those who did was Julius Caesar (63–44 BC).

The Pontifices were in charge of the lunisolar Roman calendar and determined when intercalary months needed to be added to synchronize the calendar to the seasons. Since the Pontifices were often politicians, and because a Roman magistrate&#x27;s term of office corresponded with a calendar year, this power was prone to abuse: a Pontifex could lengthen a year in which he or one of his political allies was in office, or refuse to lengthen one in which his opponents were in power. A Pontifex with other political responsibilities, especially away from Rome, might also have been simply distracted from his calendrical duties as chief priest. This caused the calendar to become out of step with the seasons; for example, Caesar&#x27;s crossing of the Rubicon in January 49 BC actually took place in mid-autumn.

Under his authority as &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, Julius Caesar introduced the calendar reform that created the entirely solar Julian calendar, with a fault of less than a day per century. This calendar remained the standard calendar of the Roman Empire until its collapse, and was used by the state church of the Roman Empire after the adoption of Christianity as the Roman state religion. The Julian calendar, established by Caesar in his capacity as &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, thus became the standard calendar in all of Europe, and continued in use in Western Europe until the Gregorian reform in the 16th century.

==The Roman Empire==
After Julius Caesar&#x27;s assassination in 44 BC, his ally Marcus Aemilius Lepidus was selected as &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;. Though Lepidus eventually fell out of political favor and was sent into exile as Augustus consolidated power, he retained the priestly office until his death in 13/12 BC, at which point Augustus was selected to succeed him and given the right to appoint other pontifices. Thus, from the time of Augustus, the election of pontifices ended and membership in the sacred college was deemed a sign of imperial favour. Augustus took the title of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; for political gain, in an attempt to restore traditional Roman values. With this attribution, the new office of Emperor was given a religious dignity and the responsibility for the entire Roman state cult. Most authors contend that the power of naming the Pontifices was not really used as an &quot;instrumentum regni&quot;, an enforcing power.

From this point on, &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was one of the many titles of the Emperor, slowly losing its specific and historical powers and becoming simply a referent for the sacral aspect of imperial duties and powers. During the Imperial period, a &quot;promagister&quot; (vice-master) performed the duties of the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; in lieu of the emperors whenever they were absent.

In post-Severan times (after 235 AD), the small number of pagan senators interested in becoming pontiffs led to a change in the pattern of office holding. In Republican and Imperial times no more than one family member of a gens was member of the College of Pontiffs, nor did one person hold more than one priesthood in this collegium. However, these rules were loosened in the later part of the 3rd century A.D. In periods of joint rule, at first only one of the emperors bore this title, as it occurred for the first time during the joint reign of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus (161–169 AD), when only Marcus Aurelius was &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, but later two &quot;pontifices maximi&quot; could serve together, as Pupienus and Balbinus did in 238 AD—a situation unthinkable in Republican times.

=== Late Antiquity ===
When Tertullian, a Montanist, furiously applied the term to a bishop with whom he was at odds (either Pope Callixtus I or Agrippinus of Carthage), ca. 220, over a relaxation of the Church&#x27;s penitential discipline allowing repentant adulterers and fornicators back into the Church, it was in bitter irony:

In the Crisis of the Third Century, emperors continued to assume the title &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;. The early Christian emperors, including Constantine the Great () and the rest of the Constantinian dynasty, continued to use it; it was only relinquished by Gratian, possibly in 376 at the time of his visit to Rome, or more probably in 383 when a delegation of pagan senators implored him to restore the Altar of Victory in the Roman Senate&#x27;s &quot;Curia Julia&quot;. Its last use with reference to the emperors is in inscriptions of Gratian.

The Edict of Thessalonica of 27 February 380 was enacted in Thessalonica (Thessaloniki) and published in Constantinople (Istanbul) for the whole empire. By it, Theodosius I established Nicene Christianity as the state church of the Roman Empire. The Latin text refers to the bishop of Rome, Damasus, as a &quot;pontifex&quot;, and the bishop of Alexandria, Peter, as an &quot;episcopus&quot;:... the profession of that religion which was delivered to the Romans by the divine Apostle Peter, as it has been preserved by faithful tradition and which is now professed by the &quot;Pontiff&quot; Damasus and by Peter, &quot;Bishop&quot; of Alexandria ... We authorize the followers of this law to assume the title Catholic Christians ...Various forms of (&#x27;highest pontiff&#x27; or bishop) were for centuries used not only of the Bishop of Rome but of other bishops also. Hilary of Arles (d. 449) is styled by Eucherius of Lyon (&quot;P. L.&quot;, vol. L, col. 773).

==== &quot;Pontifex inclytus&quot; ====
During Gratian&#x27;s reign or immediately afterwards the phrase &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; – which had unwelcome associations with traditional Roman religion during the Christianization of the Roman Empire – was replaced in imperial titulature with the . The first to adopt the &quot;inclytus&quot; alternative to &quot;maximus&quot; may have been the rebel &quot;augustus&quot; and devout Christian close to bishop Martin of Tours, Magnus Maximus (), who killed Gratian in August 383.

This practice was followed by Gratian&#x27;s junior co-emperor Theodosius the Great and was used by emperors thereafter, including the &quot;co&quot;-&quot;augusti&quot; Valentinian III (), Marcian () and the &quot;augustus&quot; Anastasius Dicorus (), for whom examples of official usage survive. Another inscription dedicated to Justin II () and naming him &quot;pontifex&quot; has long been recognized as a forgery, though there is no evidence to suggest the title could not have been used by Justinian the Great () or even by Constantine IV ().

== Middle Ages ==
Lanfranc is termed by his biographer, Milo Crispin (P. L., vol. CL, 10), but from the 11th century it appears to be applied only to the Pope.

== Catholic Church use of the title ==
In the 15th century, when the Renaissance drove new interest in ancient Rome, &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; became a regular title of honour for Popes. After the Fall of the Eastern Roman Empire with the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire and the death of the final Roman emperor Constantine XI in 1453, &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; became part of the papacy&#x27;s official titulature of the Bishop of Rome. The name given to the book containing the liturgical rites to be performed by any bishop, the &quot;Roman Pontifical&quot;, and to the form of liturgy known as Pontifical High Mass witness to the continued use of &quot;pontifex&quot; to refer to bishops in general.

Tertullian (), in his work &quot;De Pudicitia&quot; (On Modesty), criticized Pope Callixtus I for allowing repentant adulterers and fornicators back into the Church, even if they were repeat offenders, sarcastically referring to him as &quot;Pontifex Maximus.&quot;

While the title &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; has for some centuries been used in inscriptions referring to the Popes, it has never been included in the official list of papal titles published in the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot;. The official list of titles of the Pope given in the includes &quot;Supreme Pontiff of the whole Church&quot; (in Latin, ) as the fourth title, the first being &quot;Bishop of Rome.&quot; The title &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; appears in inscriptions on buildings and on coins and medallions.

In December 2012, Pope Benedict XVI adopted &quot;@pontifex&quot; as his X (formerly known as Twitter) handle, prompting users to pose questions with the &quot;#askpontifex&quot; hashtag. This has been maintained by his successor Pope Francis, who now uses it as his X handle.

<text>The cutting of the Gordian Knot is an Ancient Greek legend associated with Alexander the Great in Gordium in Phrygia, regarding a complex knot that tied an oxcart. Reputedly, whoever could untie it would be destined to rule all of Asia. In 333 BCE, Alexander was challenged to untie the knot. Instead of untangling it laboriously as expected, he dramatically cut through it with his sword, thus exercising another form of mental genius. It is thus used as a metaphor for a seemingly intractable problem which is solved by exercising brute force.
==Legend==
The Phrygians were without a king, but an oracle at Telmissus (the ancient capital of Lycia) decreed that the next man to enter the city driving an ox-cart should become their king. A peasant farmer named Gordias drove into town on an ox-cart and was immediately declared king. Out of gratitude, his son Midas dedicated the ox-cart to the Phrygian god Sabazios (whom the Greeks identified with Zeus) and tied it to a post with an intricate knot of cornel bark (&quot;Cornus mas&quot;). The knot was later described by Roman historian Quintus Curtius Rufus as comprising &quot;several knots all so tightly entangled that it was impossible to see how they were fastened&quot;.

The ox-cart still stood in the palace of the former kings of Phrygia at Gordium in the fourth century BCE when Alexander the Great arrived, at which point Phrygia had been reduced to a satrapy, or province, of the Persian Empire. An oracle had declared that any man who could unravel its elaborate knots was destined to become ruler of all of Asia. Alexander the Great wanted to untie the knot but struggled to do so before reasoning that it would make no difference &quot;how&quot; the knot was loosed. Sources from antiquity disagree on his solution. In one version of the story, he drew his sword and sliced it in half with a single stroke. However, Plutarch and Arrian relate that, according to Aristobulus, Alexander pulled the linchpin from the pole to which the yoke was fastened, exposing the two ends of the cord and allowing him to untie the knot without having to cut through it. Some classical scholars regard this as more plausible than the popular account. Literary sources of the story include Arrian (&quot;Anabasis Alexandri &quot;2.3), Quintus Curtius (3.1.14), Justin&#x27;s epitome of Pompeius Trogus (11.7.3), and Aelian&#x27;s &quot;De Natura Animalium&quot; 13.1.

Alexander the Great later went on to conquer Asia as far as the Indus and the Oxus, thus fulfilling the prophecy.

==Interpretations==
The knot may have been a religious knot-cipher guarded by priests and priestesses. Robert Graves suggested that it may have symbolised the ineffable name of Dionysus that, knotted like a cipher, would have been passed on through generations of priests and revealed only to the kings of Phrygia. 

The ox-cart suggests a longer voyage, rather than a local journey, perhaps linking Alexander the Great with an attested origin-myth in Macedon, of which Alexander is most likely to have been aware. Based on this origin myth, the new dynasty was not immemorially ancient, but had widely remembered origins in a local, but non-priestly &quot;outsider&quot; class, represented by Greek reports equally as an eponymous peasant or the locally attested, authentically Phrygian in his ox-cart. Roller (1984) separates out authentic Phrygian elements in the Greek reports and finds a folk-tale element and a religious one, linking the dynastic founder (with the cults of &quot;Zeus&quot; and Cybele).

Other Greek myths legitimize dynasties by right of conquest (compare Cadmus), but in this myth the stressed legitimising oracle suggests that the previous dynasty was a race of priest-kings allied to the unidentified oracular deity.

<text>Social control is the regulations, sanctions, mechanisms, and systems that restrict the behaviour of individuals in accordance with social norms and orders. Through both informal and formal means, individuals and groups exercise social control both internally and externally. As an area of social science, social control is studied by researchers of various fields, including anthropology, criminology, law, political science, and sociology.

Social control is considered one of the foundations of social order. Sociologists identify two basic forms of social control. Informal means of control refer to the internalization of norms and values through socialization. Formal means comprise external sanctions enforced by government to prevent the establishment of chaos or anomie in society. Some theorists, such as Émile Durkheim, refer to formal control as regulation.

== History ==
Social control developed together with civilization, as a rational measure against the uncontrollable forces of nature which tribal organisations were at prey to within archaic tribal societies. Criminal persecutions first emerged around sixth century B.C. as a form of formal social control in Athens, Greece. The purpose of these persecutions were to check certain groups and protect them from malicious interests. Historically, religion also provided an informal moral influence on communities and individuals.

Prior to the wider use of the term &quot;social control&quot;, social philosophers referred to the concept in early works. In &quot;Leviathan,&quot; Thomas Hobbes discusses how the state exerts social order using civil and military power. Cesare Beccaria&#x27;s &quot;On Crimes and Punishments&quot; argues that people will avoid criminal behavior if their acts result in harsher punishment, and that changes in punishment act as a form of social control. Sociologist Émile Durkheim also explored social control in the work &quot;The Division of Labour in Society&quot;, discussing the paradox of deviance and arguing that social control is what makes us abide by laws in the first place.

The term &quot;social control&quot; was first introduced to sociology by Albion Woodbury Small and George Edgar Vincent in 1894. However, at the time, sociologists only showed sporadic interest in the subject. While the concept of social control has been around since the formation of organized sociology, the meaning has been altered over time. Originally, the concept simply referred to society&#x27;s ability to regulate itself. However, in the 1930s, the term took on its more modern meaning of an individual&#x27;s conversion to conformity. Academics began to study social control theory as a separate field in the early 20th century. Within the 20th century, social scientists presumed that religion was still a principal factor of social control.

In the decades leading up to the end of the 1980s, an increased prevalence of the individual as a feature within society led to new psychotherapeutic modalities, suggesting the use of therapy as a means of social control.

==Informal control==

===Social values===
Social values are result of an individual internalizing certain norms and values. Social values present in individuals are products of informal social control, exercised implicitly by a society through particular customs, norms, and mores. Individuals internalize the values of their society, whether conscious or not of the indoctrination. Traditional society relies mostly on informal social control embedded in its customary culture to socialize its members. The internalization of these values and norms is known as a process called socialization. 

Sociologist Edward A. Ross argues that belief systems exert a greater control on human behavior than laws imposed by government, no matter what form the beliefs take.

===Sanctions===
Informal sanctions may include shame, ridicule, sarcasm, criticism, and disapproval, which can cause an individual to stray towards the social norms of the society. In extreme cases sanctions may include social discrimination and exclusion. Informal social control usually has more effect on individuals because the social values become internalized, thus becoming an aspect of the individual&#x27;s personality.

===Reward and punishment===
Informal controls reward or punish acceptable or unacceptable behavior (i.e., deviance) and are varied from individual to individual, group to group, and society to society. For example, at a Women&#x27;s Institute meeting, a disapproving look might convey the message that it is inappropriate to flirt with the minister. In a criminal gang, on the other hand, a stronger sanction applies in the case of someone threatening to inform to the police of illegal activity.

Social control by use of reward is known as positive reinforcement. In society and the laws and regulations implemented by the government tend to focus on punishment or the enforcing negative sanctions to act as a deterrent as means of social control.

===Theoretical bias within the modern media===
Theorists such as Noam Chomsky have argued that systemic bias exists in the modern media. The marketing, advertising, and public relations industries have thus been said to utilize mass communications to aid the interests of certain political and business elites. Powerful ideological, economic and religious lobbyists have often used school systems and centralized electronic communications to influence public opinion.

==Formal control==

===Sanctions===
Formal sanctions are usually imposed by the government and organizations in the form of laws to reward or punish behavior. Some formal sanctions include fines and incarceration in order to deter negative behavior. 
Other forms of formal social control can include other sanctions that are more severe depending on the behavior seen as negative such as censorship, expulsion, and limits on political freedom.

Examples of this can be seen in law. If a person breaks a law set forth by the government and is caught, they will have to go to court and depending on the severity, will have to pay fines or face harsher consequences.

According to a study on crime in cities, those where police make more arrests for public offenses and have higher incarceration rates tend to experience lower crime rates.

===Techniques===
Law is a technique used for the purposes of social control. For example, there are certain laws regarding appropriate sexual relationships; these are largely based on societal values. Historically, homosexuality has been criminalised in the West. In modern times, due to shifts in societal values, Western societies have mostly decriminalized homosexual relations. However, there are still laws regarding age of consent and incest, as these are still deemed as issues in society that require means of control.

A mechanism of social control occurs through the use of selective incentives. Selective incentives are private goods, which are gifts or services, made available to people depending on whether they do or don&#x27;t contribute to the good of a group, collective, or the common good. If people do contribute, they are rewarded, if they don&#x27;t they are punished. Mancur Olson gave rise to the concept in its first instance (c.f. &quot;The Logic of Collective Action&quot;).

Oberschall, in his work, identifies three elements to the pragmatics of social control as they exist in our current society. These are, confrontational control, such as riot control and crowd control, preventative measures to deter non-normal behaviors, which is legislation outlining expected boundaries for behavior, and measures complementary to preventative measures, which amount to punishment of criminal offences.

Cities can implement park exclusion orders (prohibiting individuals from frequenting some or all of the parks in a city for an extended period due to a previous infraction), trespass laws (privatizing areas generally thought of as public so police can choose which individuals to interrogate), and off-limit orders (Stay Out of Drug Areas (SODA) and Stay Out of Areas of Prostitution (SOAP) that obstruct access to these spaces). These are just a few of the new social control techniques cities use to displace certain individuals to the margins of society. Several common themes are apparent in each of these control mechanisms. The first is the ability to spatially constrain individuals in their own city. Defying any of the above statutes is a criminal offense resulting in possible incarceration. Though not all individuals subjected to an exclusion order obey it, these individuals are, at the very least, spatially hindered through decreased mobility and freedom throughout the city. This spatial constrain on individuals leads to disruption and interference in their lives. Homeless individuals generally frequent parks since the area provides benches for sleeping, public washrooms, occasional public services, and an overall sense of security by being near others in similar conditions. Privatizing areas such as libraries, public transportation systems, college campuses, and commercial establishments that are generally public gives the police permission to remove individuals as they see fit, even if the individual has ethical intent in the space. Off-limit orders attempting to keep drug addicts, prostitutes, and others out of concentrated areas of drug and sex crimes commonly restricts these individuals&#x27; ability to seek social services beneficial to rehabilitation, since these services are often located within the SODA and SOAP territories.

====Broken windows theory in the United States====
In the United States, early societies were able to easily expel individuals deemed undesirable from public space through vagrancy laws and other forms of banishment. In the 1960s and 1970s, however, these exclusion orders were denounced as unconstitutional in America and consequently were rejected by the US Supreme Court. The introduction of broken windows theory in the 1980s transformed the concepts cities used to form policies, to circumvent the previous issue of unconstitutionality. According to the theory, the environment of a particular space signals its health to the public, including to potential vandals. By maintaining an organized environment, individuals are dissuaded from causing disarray in that particular location. However, environments filled with disorder, such as broken windows or graffiti, indicate an inability for the neighborhood to supervise itself, therefore leading to an increase in criminal activity. Instead of focusing on the built environment, policies substantiated by the Broken Windows Theory overwhelmingly emphasize undesirable human behavior as the environmental disorder prompting further crime. The civility laws, originating in the late 1980s and early 1990s, provide an example of the usage of this latter aspect of the Broken Windows Theory as legitimization for discriminating against individuals considered disorderly in order to increase the sense of security in urban spaces. These civility laws effectively criminalize activities considered undesirable, such as sitting or lying on sidewalks, sleeping in parks, urinating or drinking in public, and begging, in an attempt to force the individuals doing these and other activities to relocate to the margins of society. Not surprisingly then, these restrictions disproportionally affect the homeless.

Individuals are deemed undesirable in urban space because they do not fit into social norms, which causes unease for many residents of certain neighborhoods. This fear has been deepened by the Broken Windows Theory and exploited in policies seeking to remove undesirables from visible areas of society. In the post-industrial city, concerned primarily with retail, tourism, and the service sector, the increasing pressure to create the image of a livable and orderly city has no doubt aided in the most recent forms of social control. These new techniques involve even more intense attempts to spatially expel certain individuals from urban space since the police are entrusted with considerably more power to investigate individuals, based on suspicion rather than on definite evidence of illicit actions.

<text>In ancient Greek religion and Greek mythology, Minthe (also spelled Menthe, Mintha or Mentha; or or ) is an underworld naiad associated with the river Cocytus. She was beloved by and mistress to Hades, the king of the underworld, but she was transformed into a mint plant by either his wife Persephone or her mother Demeter. The plant was also called by some as hedyosmos (), which means &quot;sweet-smelling&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The ancient Greek noun or translates to &#x27;mint&#x27;. According to Robert Beekes, it is of undoubtedly pre-Greek origin due to the variant ending in &quot;-ᾰ&quot;. The &quot;-nth-&quot;/&quot;-nthos-&quot; element in &quot;menthe&quot; has been described as a characteristic of a class of words borrowed from a Pre-Greek language: compare &quot;akanthos&quot;, &quot;Zakynthos&quot;, &quot;labyrinthos&quot;, &quot;Korinthos&quot;, and &quot;hyakinthos&quot;. The word has been also found in a Bronze Age tablet, spelled in Linear B as (mi-ta).

== Mythology ==
The naiad Minthe, daughter of the infernal river-god Cocytus, became concubine to Hades, the lord of the underworld and god of the dead. In jealousy, his wife Persephone intervened and metamorphosed Minthe, in the words of Strabo&#x27;s account, &quot;into the garden mint, which some call &quot;hedyosmos&quot; (lit. &#x27;sweet-smelling&#x27;)&quot;. A mountain near Pylos was named after Minthe, where one of the few temples of Hades in Greece was situated:

Near Pylus, towards the east, is a mountain named after Minthe, who, according to myth, became the concubine of Hades, was trampled under foot by Core, and was transformed into garden-mint, the plant which some call Hedyosmos. Furthermore, near the mountain is a precinct sacred to Hades

Similarly to that, a scholiast on Nicander wrote that Minthe became Hades&#x27; mistress; for this Persephone tore her into pieces, but Hades turned his dead lover into the fragrant plant that bore her name in her memory. Ovid also briefly mentions Minthe and her transformation at the hands of Persephone in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, but neglects to mention the story behind it. According to Oppian, Minthe had been Hades&#x27; mistress before he abducted and married Persephone, but he set her aside once he carried off and married his queen. Afterwards, she would boast that she surpassed Persephone in beauty and that Hades would soon return to her; in anger over the nymph&#x27;s insolence, Persephone&#x27;s mother Demeter trampled her, and thus from the earth sprang the mint herb:

Mint, men say, was once a maid beneath the earth, a Nymph of Cocytus, and she lay in the bed of Aidoneus; but when he raped the maid Persephone from the Aetnaean hill, then she complained loudly with overweening words and raved foolishly for jealousy, and Demeter in anger trampled her with her feet and destroyed her. For she had said that she was nobler of form and more excellent in beauty than dark-eyed Persephone and she boasted that Aidoneus would return to her and banish the other from his halls: such infatuation leapt upon her tongue. And from the earth sprang the weak herb that bears her name.

Bell notes that Demeter went through too much pain following Persephone&#x27;s abduction and partial return to tolerate any adulterous behaviour against her daughter. Oppian writing that she was trampled to death is perhaps an allusion to the verb , &quot;minytho&quot;, meaning &quot;to reduce&quot;. Orpheus wrote that Demeter, seeing the mint sad, hated it, and made it barren.

According to Julius Pollux&#x27;s &quot;Onomasticon&quot;, Minthe was mentioned by the poet Cratinus, an Athenian playwright of the Old Comedy, in his lost play &quot;Nomoi&quot; (&quot;Laws&quot;).

== Culture ==
The word used in ancient Greek texts to describe Minthe in relation to her affair with Hades is (&quot;pallakḗ&quot;), translating to &#x27;concubine&#x27; or &#x27;young girl&#x27;. In ancient Greek culture, a &quot;pallake&quot; referred to a man&#x27;s unmarried consort; she was of lower status than a legally married wife, but stood higher than a common prostitute or a &quot;hetaira&quot;.

In ancient Greece, mint was used in funerary rites, together with rosemary and myrtle, and not simply to offset the smell of decay; mint was an element in the fermented barley drink called the &quot;kykeon&quot; that was an essential preparatory entheogen for participants in the Eleusinian Mysteries, which offered hope in the afterlife for initiates. Minthe might have originated from Demeter&#x27;s mystery cults, alongside figures like Baubo and the daughters of Celeus. On the other hand, it has been argued that the myth is of Hellenistic (323 BC to 31 BC) origin instead. It is probable that it emerged as a local story at Hades&#x27;s shrine near Mount Minthe due to some special connection between the plant and the god.

The mint was highly valued due to its aromatic properties and its capacity as a condiment that brings out the flavour of many foods. Mint was used as an appetising spice, for perfume-making, woven in wreaths, and it would be hung up in rooms in order to improve and fresh up the air. It also was regarded as a powerful aphrodisiac, hence Minthe&#x27;s role in becoming the lover of Hades; at the same time it was used as a contraceptive method, as it was believed that consuming it before the act would prevent a pregnancy. Thus the mint, a plant of sterility, was seen as the opponent of Demeter, the goddess of fertility, argues Detienne.

Forbes Irving meanwhile disagrees with this interpretation, as Minthe&#x27;s connection to Demeter is already established via the kykeon, and while it is true that Hades and Minthe&#x27;s relationship is a barren one, since no children are produced from the couple, the same is true for Hades and Persephone&#x27;s. The pomegranate fruit, central to the myth of Hades and Persephone&#x27;s marriage, was also both a fertility symbol and a birth control method just like the mint.

<text>In Greco-Roman mythology, Leuce, also spelled Leuke (, &quot;white&quot;, specifically &quot;white poplar&quot;), was a nymph, an Oceanid; a daughter of the Titan Oceanus and his wife, Tethys.

== Mythology ==
Pluto fell in love with her and abducted her to the underworld. She lived out the span of her life in his realm, and when she died, the god turned her into a white poplar which he placed in the Elysian Fields. To celebrate his return from the underworld, the hero Heracles crowned himself with a branch of this tree.

==Mythology of the poplar==

Maurus Servius Honoratus identifies the tree as the white poplar, the leaf of which is distinctively two-sided, one white and one dark. The double color, Servius says, made a wreath that represented the duality of the hero&#x27;s labors in both the upper and the underworld. The association of white poplar leaves with Herakles is also attested by archaeological remains, such as the poplar-leaf motif carved on a statue base found in a small sanctuary to Herakles (Roman Hercules) along the Tiber river. It has been suggested that behind the vague outlines of this tale lurks an older myth having to do with Herakles&#x27; encounter with the river deity Achelous, who had chthonic associations and whose name was the subject of speculative theological etymology among the Greeks, in this case involving &quot;acherōïs&quot;, another Greek word for &quot;poplar.&quot; In a founding myth of the 1st century BC, Herakles is supposed to have established the Arvernian &quot;oppidum&quot; of Alesia, the name of which likely derives from the Gaulish word for poplar.

Celebrants of the Bacchic rites wore a wreath of poplar leaves to honor the chthonic aspect of Dionysus.

At Elis, white poplar was the only wood used in sacrifices to Zeus, according to Pausanias, because Herakles imported the tree and used it to burn the thigh bones of sacrificial victims at Olympia. The oak is the customary sacred tree of Zeus, and the substitution among the Eleans may simply reflect the more widespread growth habit of the poplar there. The hero was supposed to have discovered the tree growing on the banks of the upperworld Acheron in Thesprotia.
Pausanias says this is the reason for the Homeric epithet &quot;Acherōïda&quot; for the white poplar, which was also called &quot;leukē&quot; in Greek.

The white poplar might be worn as a crown at athletic contests in honor of Herakles, a patron of the Olympic games. Its infernal origin made it appropriate for funeral games, which played an important role in the development of Greek athletics.

The white poplar was also sacred to Persephone, for whom Leuce seems to be a doublet or epithet, as a goddess of regeneration. Robert Graves used the myth of Leuce in developing his poetic theories of mythology. Graves, for instance, holds that the back of the poplar leaf was turned white by the sweat of Herakles. In &quot;The White Goddess&quot;, he names the white poplar as one of the &quot;three trees of resurrection&quot;, along with alder and cypress.

<doc id="81686" wikidata="Q969307" url="?curid=81686" title="Latrobe, Pennsylvania">
<text>Latrobe ( ) is a city in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 8,060 as of the 2020 census. A part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, it is located near Pennsylvania&#x27;s scenic Chestnut Ridge. Latrobe was incorporated as a borough in 1854, and as a city in 1999. The current mayor is Eric J. Bartels.

Latrobe is the home of the Latrobe Brewery, the original brewer of Rolling Rock beer. Latrobe was the birthplace and childhood home of children&#x27;s television personality Fred Rogers and former professional golfer Arnold Palmer. The banana split was invented there by David Strickler in 1904. Latrobe is also home to the training camp of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Latrobe was long recognized as the site of the first professional American football game in 1895 until research found an 1892 game with paid players.

== History ==
In 1852, Oliver Barnes (a civil engineer for the Pennsylvania Railroad) laid out the plans for the community that was incorporated in 1854 as the Borough of Latrobe. Barnes named the town for his best friend and college classmate, Benjamin Henry Latrobe II, who was chief engineer for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. (His father, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, was the architect who rebuilt the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., after the War of 1812.)

Its location along the route of the Pennsylvania Railroad helped Latrobe develop into a significant industrial hub. Latrobe was also served by the Ligonier Valley Railroad from 1877 to 1952.

The banana split is claimed to have been invented 1904 in Latrobe by David Evans Strickler at the pharmacy that later became named Strickler&#x27;s Drug Store. In 2004, the National Ice Cream Retailers Association (NICRA) certified Latrobe as the birthplace of the banana split. The town holds an annual festival in honor of the dessert.

Two interurban (long-distance trolley) lines served Latrobe:

* The Westmoreland County Railway Company connected Latrobe to Derry and operated from 1904 to 1932.
* The Latrobe Street Railway Company connected Latrobe to Kingston and began operations in 1900. This line was purchased by West Penn Railways, which eventually linked it with its network running through Youngstown, Pleasant Unity, and eventually to Greensburg and Uniontown. Service ceased in 1952.

Latrobe has two sites on the National Register of Historic Places within its city boundaries:

* Pennsylvania Railroad Station at Latrobe (325 McKinley Avenue): This station was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1903.
* Citizens National Bank of Latrobe (816 Ligonier Street, at Main Street): This was previously known as the Mellon Bank Building. This six-story, 1926 structure was designed by the Greensburg firm of Batholomew and Smith.

The former Fort Sloan, a small fortress established by the British settlers in the 1700s, is now a private residence, situated on the corner of Cedar St. and Raymond Ave.

=== Early professional football team ===
From 1895 until 1909, Latrobe was the home of the Latrobe Athletic Association, one of the earliest professional football teams. The team&#x27;s quarterback, John Brallier, became the first football player to admit playing for money. In 1895, he accepted $10 and expenses to play for Latrobe in a 12–0 victory over the Jeannette Athletic Club. Brallier was thought to be the first professional football player, until the 1960s. Then, documents surfaced showing that Pudge Heffelfinger, a former three-time All-American from Yale, was employed to play guard for the Allegheny Athletic Association three years earlier. In 1897, Latrobe was the first football team to play a full season with a team composed entirely of professional players. In 1898, Latrobe and two players from their rivals, the Greensburg Athletic Association, formed the first professional football all-star team for a game against the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, to be played at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Exposition Park. Duquesne went on to win the game 16–0. On November 18, 1905, Latrobe defeated the Canton Bulldogs, which later became a founding member, and two-time champion, of the National Football League, 6–0.

Aside from Brallier, the Latrobe Athletic Association included several of the era&#x27;s top players, such as Ed Abbaticchio, Charles Barney, Alf Bull, Jack Gass, Walter Okeson, Harry Ryan, Doggie Trenchard, and Eddie Wood, and manager Dave Berry.

=== Brewing ===
The Latrobe Brewing Company, founded in 1939, was one of the largest breweries in the United States and the maker of Rolling Rock beer.

In May 2006, Anheuser-Busch purchased the Rolling Rock brands, but not the brewery. In June 2006, City Brewing Company from LaCrosse, Wisconsin, entered into negotiations to buy the brewery. In September 2006, City Brewing Company agreed to purchase the brewery, and they licensed it to the Boston Beer Company in April 2007 as a satellite brewery to produce Samuel Adams beers. Sam Adams production did not last long. The plant is currently brewing Iron City Beer under contract. In addition, Duquesne Bottling Company has brewed the revived Duquesne Beer, &quot;The Prince of Pilseners&quot;, at the Latrobe plant.

=== Mining ===
Coal mining was once an important industry in Westmoreland County. While mining activity has largely ceased, most of the city of Latrobe lies in a zone where abandoned underground mines are prevalent, according to a March 1, 2022, article in &quot;The Latrobe Bulletin&quot;. In 2017, a home in the city&#x27;s Cramer Heights neighborhood started to collapse after its foundation shifted. The house was condemned and eventually had to be torn down. After this incident, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection urged Latrobe residents to research whether their properties are undermined and consider applying for mine subsidence insurance.

<text>A field camera is a view camera that can be folded in a compact size. Modern designs are little different from the first folding field cameras from the 19th century. In general they have more limited camera movements than monorail cameras, but when folded are relatively compact and portable.

Modern field cameras originate from the early interlocking box cameras of the 19th century. Rather than the wooden box used in 19th-century cameras, modern models substitute bellows to reduce the bulk of the cameras and make them easier to use outside the studio. 

Although they have less flexibility than monorail cameras, modern field cameras tend to have most camera movements for the front standard, i.e. lens rise/fall/shift/tilt/swing, but are usually more limited in back movements, sometimes having only tilt/swing. 

They usually use sheet film, in sizes from 6x9cm (2.4×3.6&quot;) to 20×24 inches (e.g., the Polaroid 20×24 camera), but the most popular &quot;standard&quot; sizes are 4×5 and 8×10 inches. They are usually used by photographers who need the larger negative sizes and the portability.

<text>In Greek mythology, Clymenus (; means &quot;notorious&quot; or &quot;renowned&quot;) may refer to multiple individuals:

*Clymenus, a son of Phoroneus by either Cerdo or Teledice or Cinna. He and his sister Chthonia founded a sanctuary of Demeter.
*Clymenus was the son of Helios and king of Boeotia. In a variant genealogy, he is the father of the children of the Oceanid Merope (usually said to be the offspring of Helios and Clymene). These include Phaëton and the Heliades: Merope, Helie, Aegle, Lampetia, Phoebe, Aetherie, and Dioxippe. Sometimes Phaethousa is included in this number. The names &quot;Clymenus&quot; and &quot;Merope&quot; in Hyginus&#x27; version, which is not followed otherwise, may have resulted from incidental gender swap of the names of the Oceanid Clymene and her mortal husband Merops.
*Clymenus, who killed Hodites during the fight between Phineus and Perseus.
*Clymenus, son of Cardys and a descendant of Heracles of Ida. He became king of Olympia but was deposed by Endymion. He was credited with founding the temple of Athena Cydonia in Phrixa, Elis.
*Clymenus, a Calydonian prince as the son of King Oeneus and Althaea, daughter of King Thestius of Pleuron. He was the brother of Meleager, Periphas, Agelaus (or Ageleus), Thyreus (or Phereus or Pheres), Deianeira, Gorge, Eurymede and Melanippe. When the war between the Curetes and the Calydonians broke out, Clymenus along with his brothers, including Meleager, all fell during the battle.
*Clymenus or Periclymenus, son of either Presbon or Orchomenus (in the latter case, brother of Aspledon and Amphidocus) and a King of Orchomenus in Boeotia, which he inherited from its eponym Orchomenus - either as his son, or (in the version that makes him a son of Presbon) because Orchomenus left the kingdom to him, having no children of his own. By Boudeia or Bouzyge, daughter of Lycus, Clymenus was father of five sons: Erginus, Stratius, Arrhon, Pyleus, Azeus, and two daughters: Eurydice and Axia. At a festival of Poseidon at Onchestus, Clymenus quarreled with a group of Thebans over a minor cause and was mortally wounded as a result of a stone thrown at him by Perieres, the charioteer of Menoeceus. Being brought home half dead, Clymenus told Erginus, his successor-to-be, to avenge his death, and died; Erginus then led a war against Thebes.
*Clymenus, king of Arcadia, was the son of either Schoeneus or Teleus of Argos. By Epicasta, he fathered Idas, Therager and Harpalyce. He committed incest with his daughter which prompted him to commit suicide afterwards. Clymenus was also said to have eaten in a banquet the flesh of his sons by his own daughter Harpalyce.
*Clymenus, one of the Argonauts, and the brother of Iphiclus. He was probably son of Phylacus and Clymene and thus brother of Alcimede, mother of Jason.
*Clymenus, one of the sons of King Aeolus of Lipara, the keeper of the winds. He had five brothers namely: Periphas, Agenor, Euchenor, Xouthos and Macareus, and six sisters: Klymene, Kallithyia, Eurygone, Lysidike, Kanake and an unnamed one. According to various accounts, Aeolus yoked in marriage his sons, including Clymenus, and daughters in order to preserve concord and affection among them.
*Clymenus, one of the Suitors of Penelope who came from Dulichium along with other 56 wooers. He, with the other suitors, was shot dead by Odysseus with the help of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus.
*Clymenus, whose eldest daughter Eurydice was, according to Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the wife of Nestor.
*Clymenus, the name of Nyctimene&#x27;s father in one version, who tried to rape his daughter.
*Clymenus, a surname of Hades.

<doc id="81694" wikidata="Q9434" url="?curid=81694" title="Arnold Palmer">
<text>Arnold Daniel Palmer (September 10, 1929 – September 25, 2016) was an American professional golfer who is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most charismatic players in the sport&#x27;s history. Since embarking on a professional career in 1955, he won numerous events on both the PGA Tour and the circuit now known as PGA Tour Champions. Nicknamed &quot;The King&quot;, Palmer was one of golf&#x27;s most popular stars and seen as a trailblazer, the first superstar of the sport&#x27;s television age, which began in the 1950s.

Palmer&#x27;s social impact on golf was unrivaled among fellow professionals; his modest origins and plain-spoken popularity helped change the perception of golf from an elite, upper-class pastime of private clubs to a more populist sport accessible to middle and working classes via public courses. Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player were &quot;The Big Three&quot; in golf during the 1960s; they are credited with popularizing and commercializing the sport around the world.

In a career spanning more than six decades, Palmer won 62 PGA Tour titles from 1955 to 1973. He is fifth on the Tour&#x27;s all-time victory list, trailing only Sam Snead, Tiger Woods, Nicklaus, and Ben Hogan. He won seven major titles in a six-plus-year domination from the 1958 Masters to the 1964 Masters. He also won the PGA Tour Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998, and in 1974 was one of the 13 original inductees into the World Golf Hall of Fame.

==Early life==

Arnold Daniel Palmer was born on September 10, 1929, to Doris (née Morrison) and Milfred Jerome &quot;Deacon&quot; Palmer in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, a working-class steel mill town. He learned golf from his father, who had suffered from polio at a young age and was head professional and greenskeeper at Latrobe Country Club, which allowed young Palmer to accompany his father as he maintained the course.

Palmer attended Wake Forest College on a golf scholarship. He left upon the death of close friend Bud Worsham and enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard, where he served for three years, 1951–1954. At the Coast Guard Training Center in Cape May, New Jersey, he built a nine-hole course and had some time to continue to hone his golf skills. After Palmer&#x27;s enlistment term ended, he returned to college and competitive golf.

Palmer won the 1954 U.S. Amateur in Detroit and made the decision to turn pro in November of that year. &quot;That victory was the turning point in my life,&quot; he said. &quot;It gave me confidence I could compete at the highest level of the game.&quot; When reporters there asked Gene Littler who the young golfer was that was cracking balls on the practice tee, Littler said: &quot;That&#x27;s Arnold Palmer. He&#x27;s going to be a great player some day. When he hits the ball, the earth shakes.&quot;

After winning that match, Palmer quit his job selling paint and played in the Waite Memorial tournament in Shawnee-on-Delaware, Pennsylvania. There, he met his future wife, Winifred Walzer, and they remained married for 45 years until her death in 1999.

On November 17, 1954, Palmer announced his intentions to turn pro. &quot;What other people find in poetry, I find in the flight of a good drive,&quot; Palmer said.

==Career==
Palmer&#x27;s first tour win came during his 1955 rookie season, when he won the Canadian Open and earned $2,400 for his efforts. He raised his game status for the next several seasons. Palmer&#x27;s charisma was a major factor in establishing golf as a compelling television event in the 1950s and 1960s, which set the stage for the popularity it enjoys today. His first major championship win at the 1958 Masters Tournament, where he earned $11,250, established his position as one of the leading stars in golf, and by 1960 he had signed up as pioneering sports agent Mark McCormack&#x27;s first client.

In later interviews, McCormack listed five attributes that made Palmer especially marketable: his handsomeness; his relatively modest background (his father was a greenskeeper before rising to be club professional and Latrobe was a humble club); the way he played golf, taking risks and wearing his emotions on his sleeve; his involvement in a string of exciting finishes in early televised tournaments; and his affability.

Palmer is also credited by many for securing the status of The Open Championship (British Open) among U.S. players. Before Ben Hogan won that championship in 1953, few American professionals had traveled to play in The Open, due to its extensive travel requirements, its relatively small purse, and the style of its links courses (radically different from most American courses). Palmer wanted to emulate the feats of his predecessors Bobby Jones, Sam Snead and Hogan in his quest to become a leading American golfer.

In particular, Palmer traveled to Scotland in 1960 to compete in the British Open for the first time. He had already won both the Masters and U.S. Open and was trying to emulate Hogan&#x27;s 1953 feat of winning all three tournaments in a single year. Palmer played what he himself said were the four best rounds of his career, shooting 70-71-70-68. His scores had the English excitedly claiming that Palmer may well be the greatest golfer ever to play the game. British fans were excited about Palmer&#x27;s playing in the Open. Although he failed to win, losing out to Kel Nagle by a single shot, his subsequent Open wins in the early 1960s convinced many American pros that a trip to Britain would be worth the effort, and certainly secured Palmer&#x27;s popularity among British and European fans, not just American ones.

Palmer was greatly disappointed by his runner-up finish in the 1960 British Open. His appearance overseas drew American attention to the Open Championship, which had previously been ignored by the American golfers. Palmer went on to win the Open Championship in 1961 and 1962, and last played in it in 1995. Martin Slumbers, chief executive of The R&amp;A, called Palmer &quot;a true gentleman, one of the greatest ever to play the game and a truly iconic figure in sport&quot;. His participation in The Open Championship in the early 1960s &quot;was the catalyst to truly internationalize golf,&quot; said European Tour chief executive Keith Pelley.

Palmer won seven major championships:
* Masters Tournament: 1958, 1960, 1962, 1964
* U.S. Open: 1960
* The Open Championship: 1961, 1962

Palmer&#x27;s most prolific years were 1960–1963, when he won 29 PGA Tour events, including five major tournaments, in four seasons. In 1960, he won the Hickok Belt as the top professional athlete of the year and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; award. He built up a wide fan base, often referred to as &quot;Arnie&#x27;s Army&quot;, and in 1967 he became the first man to reach $1million in career earnings on the PGA Tour. By the late 1960s Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player had both acquired clear ascendancy in their rivalry, but Palmer won a PGA Tour event every year from 1955 to 1971 inclusive, and in 1971 he enjoyed a revival, winning four events.

For each of his wins at the Masters, Palmer&#x27;s caddie was Nathaniel &quot;Iron Man&quot; Avery; at the time, Augusta National required all golfers to use the club&#x27;s own caddies.

Palmer won the Vardon Trophy for lowest scoring average four times: 1961, 1962, 1964, and 1967. He played on six Ryder Cup teams: 1961, 1963, 1965, 1967, 1971, and 1973. He was the last playing captain in 1963, and captained the team again in 1975.

Palmer was eligible for the Senior PGA Tour (now PGA Tour Champions) from its first season in 1980, and he was one of the marquee names who helped it to become successful. He won ten events on the tour, including five senior majors.

Palmer won the first World Match Play Championship that was held in England. The event was originally organized by McCormack to showcase his stable of players. Their partnership was one of the most significant in the history of sports marketing. Long after he ceased to win tournaments, Palmer remained one of the highest earners in golf due to his appeal to sponsors and the public.
In 2004, he competed in the Masters Tournament for the last time, marking his 50th consecutive appearance in that event. At his death, he and Jack Nicklaus were the only two Masters champions to be regular members of Masters organizer Augusta National Golf Club (as opposed to the honorary membership the club grants to all Masters champions).

From 2007 until his death, Palmer served as an honorary starter for the Masters. He retired from tournament golf on October 13, 2006, when he withdrew from the Champions Tours&#x27; Administaff Small Business Classic after four holes due to dissatisfaction with his own play. He played the remaining holes but did not keep score.

===Golf businesses===
Palmer had a diverse golf-related business career, including owning the Bay Hill Club and Lodge in Orlando, Florida, which is the venue for the PGA Tour&#x27;s Arnold Palmer Invitational (renamed from the Bay Hill Invitational in 2007), helping to found The Golf Channel, and negotiating the deal to build the first golf course in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. This led to the formation of Palmer Course Design in 1972, which was renamed Arnold Palmer Design Company when the company moved to Orlando, Florida, in 2006. Palmer&#x27;s design partner was Ed Seay.

Palmer designed more than 300 golf courses in 37 states, 25 countries, and five continents (all except Africa and Antarctica), including the golf course at Henry Fok&#x27;s Zhongshan Hot Springs Hotel, which was one of the first golf courses built in China since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In 1971, he purchased Latrobe Country Club (where his father used to be the club professional) and owned it until his death. The licensing, endorsements, spokesman associations and commercial partnerships built by Palmer and McCormack are managed by Arnold Palmer Enterprises. Palmer was also a member of the American Society of Golf Course Architects.

In 1997, Palmer and fellow golfer Tiger Woods initiated a civil case in an effort to stop the unauthorized sale of their images and alleged signatures in the memorabilia market. The lawsuit was filed against Bruce Matthews, the owner of Gotta Have It Golf, Inc. and others. Matthews and associated parties counter-claimed that Palmer and associated businesses committed several acts, including breach of contract, breach of implied duty of good faith and violations of Florida&#x27;s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. On March 12, 2014, a Florida jury ruled in favor of Gotta Have It on its breach of contract and other related claims. The same jury rejected the counterclaims of Palmer and Woods, and awarded Gotta Have It $668,346 in damages.

One of Palmer&#x27;s most recent products (mass-produced starting in 2001) is a branded use of the beverage known as the &quot;Arnold Palmer&quot;, which combines sweetened iced tea with lemonade.

===Automotive businesses===
As a member of the Lincoln-Mercury Sports Panel, in the early 1970s Palmer was a brand ambassador for Lincoln-Mercury. In 1974, Palmer, along with partners Mark McCormack and Don Massey, purchased a Cadillac dealership in Charlotte, North Carolina. Over the years, Palmer would acquire several other dealerships in several states including a Buick-Cadillac store in his hometown of Latrobe. The Latrobe dealership, known as Arnold Palmer Motors, closed in 2017 after 36 years in business.

==Legacy==

According to Adam Schupak of &quot;Golf Week&quot;, &quot;No one did more to popularize the sport than Palmer&quot;. &quot;His dashing presence singlehandedly took golf out of the country clubs and into the mainstream. Quite simply, he made golf cool.&quot; Jack Nicklaus said: 
He is mentioned by James Bond&#x27;s caddie in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;: &quot;If that&#x27;s [Goldfinger&#x27;s] original ball, I&#x27;m Arnold Palmer.&quot;

In 2000, Palmer was ranked the sixth greatest player of all time in &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine&#x27;s rankings, and by 2008 had earned an estimated $30 million.

Palmer was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa - The National Leadership Honor Society in 1964 at Wake Forest University. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009. He was the first golfer to be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the second golfer, after Byron Nelson, to be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.

In addition to Palmer&#x27;s impressive list of awards, he was bestowed the honor of kicking off the Masters Tournament beginning in 2007. From 2007 to 2009, Palmer was the sole honorary starter. In 2010, longtime friend and competitor Jack Nicklaus was appointed by Augusta National to join Palmer. In 2012, golf&#x27;s The Big Three reunited as South African golfer Gary Player joined for the ceremonial tee shots as honorary starters for the 76th playing of the Masters Tournament. In describing the effect that Palmer had on the sport, biographer James Dodson stated:
==Personal life==

Palmer was married to the former Winnie Walzer for 45 years; the couple had two daughters, Peggy and Amy. Winnie died at age 65 on November 20, 1999, of complications from ovarian cancer.

Palmer&#x27;s grandson Sam Saunders is a professional golfer who grew up playing at Bay Hill, where he won the club championship at age 15. Saunders attended Clemson University in South Carolina on a golf scholarship and turned pro in 2008. He stated that Palmer&#x27;s family nickname is &quot;Dumpy.”

Palmer married his second wife, Kathleen Gawthrop, in 2005 in Hawaii.

During the spring and summer months, Palmer resided in Latrobe, and he spent winters in Orlando and La Quinta, California. He first visited Orlando in 1948 during a college match. When he took up residence in Orlando, Palmer helped the city become a recreation destination, &quot;turning the entire state of Florida into a golfing paradise.” That included building one of the premier events on the PGA Tour there, along with his contributions to new hospitals. On hearing about Palmer&#x27;s death, Tiger Woods said, &quot;My kids were born at the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women &amp; Babies, and his philanthropic work will be remembered along with his accomplishments in golf.&quot; Arnold Palmer Boulevard is named in his honor.

Palmer was a member of the Freemasons since 1958. Palmer created the Arnie&#x27;s Army Charitable Foundation to help children and youth. The Foundation saw the creation of the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women &amp; Babies Center, The Howard Philips Center for Children &amp; Families, the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children, and the Winnie Palmer Nature Reserve. He and O.J. Simpson were spokespersons for Hertz Rent-a-Car. Palmer served on the advisory board of U.S. English, a group that supports making English the official language of the United States.

During his playing career, Palmer smoked cigarettes, which caused him to battle an addiction to nicotine. He noted that many of his colleagues smoked, and he even endorsed the product in television commercials. Later in life, Palmer made a complete about-face and urged the public to give up smoking. He said that cigarette smoking has a negative effect on every organ in the body. As a testimonial for smoking cessation products, he was depicted in a 1989 photo by Robert Straus that was subject to copyright litigation as late as 20 years later.

Palmer was a Republican and donated money to Pat Toomey, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, and George W. Bush. He was approached on multiple occasions by the Republican Party encouraging him to run for political office, but he declined on each occasion.

In a September 2018 interview with The Sporting News, Palmer&#x27;s daughter, Peggy, characterized Palmer as a Goldwater Republican. She also said that her father was personal friends with president Dwight D. Eisenhower, who gave Palmer one of his paintings as a birthday present. Palmer also knew Donald Trump because Trump organized several golf tournaments. According to Peggy, Palmer appreciated Trump&#x27;s support for the game. However, around the time of Palmer&#x27;s death, which was during Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign, Palmer showed disgust towards Trump and made unflattering comments about him.

===Pilot===

Palmer&#x27;s early &quot;fear of flying&quot; led him to pursue his pilot certificate. After almost 55 years, he logged nearly 20,000 hours of flight time in various aircraft. His personal website reads:
On Palmer&#x27;s 70th birthday in 1999, Westmoreland County Airport in Latrobe was renamed Arnold Palmer Regional Airport in his honor. According to their website: &quot;[The airport] started as the Longview Flying Field in 1924. It became J.D. Hill Airport in 1928, Latrobe Airport in 1935 and Westmoreland County Airport in 1978. Complementing a rich history rooted in some of the earliest pioneers of aviation, the name was changed to Arnold Palmer Regional in 1999 to honor the Latrobe native golf legend who grew up less than a mile from the runway where he watched the world&#x27;s first official airmail pickup in 1939 and later learned to fly himself.&quot; There is a statue of Palmer made by Zenos Frudakis, holding a golf club in front of the airport&#x27;s entrance, unveiled in 2007.

Palmer thought he would pilot a plane for the last time on January 31, 2011, and flew from Palm Springs in California to Orlando in his Cessna Citation X. His pilot&#x27;s medical certificate expired that day and he chose not to renew it. However, public FAA records show he was issued a new third-class medical in May 2011.

==Death==
Palmer died on September 25, 2016 (shortly after his 87th birthday), while awaiting heart surgery at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (Shadyside) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was admitted three days earlier to undergo testing on his heart. After his funeral, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered in his hometown at Latrobe Country Club. His estate was valued at $875 million and was divided between his two daughters, his second wife (who received $10 million), eight employees who received $25,000 each, and his charity, Arnie&#x27;s Army, which received $10 million.

===Tributes===

Less than a week after Palmer died, his life was celebrated by both teams at the Ryder Cup at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minnesota, just outside the Twin Cities. The celebration included a video tribute and a moment of silence during the opening ceremony, which also included tributes from the opposing captains—Davis Love III for Team USA and Northern Ireland&#x27;s Darren Clarke for Team Europe—and the opposing honorary captains—Nicklaus for Team USA and England&#x27;s Tony Jacklin for Team Europe. During the matches, the players paid tribute to Palmer, which included wearing a special logo, button and pin. Palmer&#x27;s bag from the 1975 Ryder Cup was also placed on the first tee as a tribute. Palmer had won more than 22 Ryder Cup matches and had also captained Team USA to two victories, in addition to holding or being tied for the records for youngest captain, most career singles points and most points in a single Ryder Cup. PGA of America president Derek Sprague stated: 

Two days after a 17–11 victory, which marked the first American Ryder Cup triumph since 2008 at Valhalla and which Love dedicated to Palmer, the majority of the team attended the memorial service for Palmer at St. Vincent College in Latrobe and also brought the trophy after Palmer&#x27;s daughter Amy asked the team if they could do so.

A Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to Palmer on January 1, 2017.

The United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp honoring Palmer on March 4, 2020.

<text>In Greek mythology, King Haemus (; , &quot;Haîmos&quot;) of Thrace, was the son of Boreas, the north wind. 

== Mythology ==
Haemus was vain and haughty and compared himself and his wife, Queen Rhodope, to Zeus and Hera. The gods changed him and his wife into mountains (respectively Haemus Mons, now known as the Balkan Mountains, and the Rhodope Mountains). In ancient Greek, the Balkan Peninsula was thus known as the &quot;Peninsula of Haemus&quot; (), a name which retains some currency in modern Greek.

Another classic etymology derives the name &#x27;Haemos&#x27; from the myth about the fight of Zeus and the dragon Typhon:

:He was again driven to Thrace and hurled entire mountains at Zeus in the battle around Mount Haemus. When these bounced back upon him under the force of the thunderbolt, blood gushed out on the mountain. From this, they say, the mountain is called haemus (&quot;bloody&quot;).

<doc id="81699" wikidata="Q849438" url="?curid=81699" title="Iasion">
<text>In Greek mythology, Iasion () or [[Iasus]] (), also called [[Eetion (mythology)|Eetion]] (), was the founder of the mystic rites on the island of Samothrace.

== Family ==
According to the mythographer Apollodorus, Iasion is the son of the Pleiad Electra and Zeus, and the brother of Dardanus and possibly Emathion. Both Hellanicus and Diodorus Siculus repeat this parentage, adding Harmonia as his sister. According to an Italian version of the genealogy, Iasion and Dardanus are both Electra&#x27;s sons, and are both born in Italy, with Iasion fathered by Corythus and Dardanus by Zeus. In the &quot;Fabulae&quot; (attributed to Gaius Julius Hyginus), Iasion is called the son of Ilithyius.

With Demeter, Iasion was the father of Plutus, the god of wealth. According to Hyginus&#x27; &quot;De astronomia&quot;, Iasion was also the father of Philomelus, while, according to Diodorus Siculus, he was the father of a son named Corybas with Cybele.

== Mythology ==
At the marriage of Cadmus and Harmonia, Iasion was lured by Demeter away from the other revelers. They had intercourse as Demeter lay on her back in a freshly plowed furrow. When they rejoined the celebration, Zeus guessed what had happened because of the mud on Demeter&#x27;s backside, and out of envy killed Iasion with a thunderbolt. In one account, his death was caused by his impiety to the statue of Demeter instead. Servius, in his commentary upon Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, states that Iasion was killed by his brother Dardanus, whereas Hyginus attributes his death to horses. Ovid, in contrast, says that Iasion lived to an old age as the husband of Demeter.

Some versions of this myth conclude with Iasion and the agricultural hero Triptolemus then becoming the Gemini constellation.

<doc id="81702" wikidata="Q787492" url="?curid=81702" title="Harpocrates">
<text>Harpocrates (, Phoenician: 𐤇𐤓𐤐𐤊𐤓𐤈, ḥrpkrṭ, &quot;harpokratēs&quot;) is the god of silence, secrets and confidentiality in the Hellenistic religion developed in Ptolemaic Alexandria (and also an embodiment of hope, according to Plutarch). Greeks adapted Harpocrates from the Egyptian child-god Horus, who represented the newborn sun, rising each day at dawn. The name &quot;Harpocrates&quot; originated as a Hellenization of the Egyptian &quot;Har-pa-khered&quot; or &quot;Heru-pa-khered&quot;, meaning &quot;Horus the Child&quot;.

Horus the Child was portrayed as a naked boy with his finger to his mouth as if sucking on it, an Egyptian artistic convention for representing a child. Greeks and Romans misunderstood this pose as a gesture of silence and interpreted Harpocrates as the god of secrecy.

==Horus==
In Egyptian mythology, Horus was the child of Isis and Osiris. Osiris was the original divine pharaoh of Egypt, who had been murdered by his brother Set (by &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot;, identified with Typhon or Chaos), mummified, and thus became the god of the underworld. The Greeks melded Osiris with their underworldly Hades to produce the essentially Alexandrian syncretism known as Serapis.

Among the Egyptians, the full-grown Horus was considered the victorious god of the sun who each day overcomes darkness. He is often represented with the head of a Eurasian sparrowhawk, which was sacred to him, as the hawk flies high above the Earth. Horus fought battles against Set, until he finally achieved victory and became the ruler of Egypt. Thereafter, the pharaohs of Egypt were seen as reincarnations of the victorious Horus.

&quot;Horus on the Crocodiles&quot; steles depicting Heru-pa-Khered standing on the back of a crocodile and holding snakes in his outstretched hands were erected in Egyptian temple courtyards, where they would be immersed or lustrated (purified) in water; the water was then used for blessing and healing purposes as the name of Heru-pa-Khered was itself attributed with many protective and healing powers.

In the Alexandrian and Roman renewed vogue for the Greco-Roman mysteries at the turn of the millennium into the common era — mystery cults had already existed for centuries — the worship of Horus became widely extended, linked with his mother Isis and his father Serapis.
In this way Harpocrates, the child Horus, personifies the newborn sun each day, the first strength of the winter sun, and also the image of early vegetation. Egyptian statues represent the child Horus, pictured as a naked boy with his finger on his chin with the fingertip just below the lips of his mouth, a realization of the hieroglyph for &quot;child&quot; that is unrelated to the Greco-Roman and modern gesture for &quot;silence&quot;. Misunderstanding this sign, the later Greeks and Roman poets made Harpocrates the god of silence and secrecy, taking their cue from Marcus Terentius Varro, who asserted in &quot;De lingua Latina&quot; of &quot;Caelum&quot; (Sky) and &quot;Terra&quot; (Earth).

Ovid described Isis:
One other tale relates the story about the Greek gods. Aphrodite gave a rose to her son Eros, the god of love; he, in turn, gave it to Harpocrates to ensure that his mother&#x27;s indiscretions (or those of the gods in general, in other accounts) were kept under wraps. This gave roses the connotation of secrecy (a rose suspended from the ceiling of a council chamber pledged all present – &quot;sub rosa&quot; &quot;under the rose&quot;), which continued through the Middle Ages and through the modern era.

Inexpensive cast terracotta images of Harpocrates, suitable for house shrines, are found scattered throughout the Roman Empire. Thus Augustine of Hippo was aware of the iconic gesture of Harpocrates:

Martianus Capella, author of an allegorizing textbook that remained a standard through the Middle Ages recognized the image of the &quot;boy with his finger pressed to his lips&quot; but neglected to mention Harpocrates&#x27; name: &quot;[Q]uidam redimitus puer ad os compresso digito salutari silentium commonebat&quot;. The boy was identified, however, as Cupid in glosses, a syncresis that had already resulted in the figure of Harpocratic Cupid.

Plutarch wrote that Harpocrates was the second son of Isis and that he was born prematurely with lame legs. Horus the Child became the special protector of children and their mothers. As he was healed of a poisonous snake bite by Ra he became a symbol of hope in the gods looking after suffering humanity.

Another solar cult, not directly connected with Harpocrates, was that of Sol Invictus &quot;the Unconquered Sun&quot;.

==Modern occultist uses==
Modern occultists display his image, loosely connected now with Hermetic gnosticism. Typically, &quot;Harpocrates is the Babe in the Egg of Blue that sits upon the lotus flower in the Nile&quot;. He may be termed the &#x27;god of silence&#x27; and said to represent the higher self and be the Holy Guardian Angel and more in similar vein, adapted from Aleister Crowley&#x27;s often-reprinted &quot;Magick (Book 4)&quot;.

Many Discordians consider Harpo Marx to have been a contemporary avatar of Harpocrates. Because of this, Discordians often invoke Harpocrates as a trickster god or god of humor in addition to his classical attribution of god of silence.

==Cultural uses==

Roses, a symbol strongly associated with Harpocrates, can sometimes be seen painted or else plastered upon borders around the ceilings of rooms intended for the receiving of guests (dining rooms, parlours, etc.), as a sign that topics discussed within the room are not to be discussed or else repeated outside of the room and other outside parties. Similarly, roses may be placed over confessionals to symbolize confidentiality.

==Archaeology==

In 2018, archaeologists discovered a bone figurine depicting the god dating back to the 1st century BC. In addition to the god, two satyrs and a goose are depicted. It was discovered during excavations at the ancient Greek city of Tiritaka at Crimea. A statue of Harpocrates was also found in Saudi Arabia by the border with Yemen at Qaryat al-Faw, the capital of the Kingdom of Kinda in late antiquity.

<text>Veronica&quot; sect. &quot;Hebe is a group of plants within the genus &quot;Veronica&quot;, native to New Zealand, Rapa in French Polynesia, the Falkland Islands and South America. It was formerly treated as the separate genus Hebe (). It includes about 90 species. Almost all species occur in New Zealand, apart from &quot;Veronica rapensis&quot; (endemic to Rapa) and &quot;Veronica salicifolia&quot;, found in South America. It is named after the Greek goddess of youth, Hebe. Informally, species in the section may be called shrubby veronicas or hebes.

Hebes are widely grown as ornamental plants (see Cultivation below).

==Description==
Species in &quot;Veronica&quot; sect. &quot;Hebe&quot; have four perpendicular rows of leaves in opposite decussate pairs. The flowers are perfect, the corolla usually has four slightly unequal lobes, the flower has two stamens and a long style. Flowers are arranged in a spiked inflorescence. Identification of species is difficult, especially if they are not in flower. The plants range in size from dwarf shrubs to small trees up to 7 metres (23 feet), and are distributed from coastal to alpine ecosystems. Large-leaved species are normally found on the coast, in lowland scrub and along forest margins. At higher altitudes smaller-leaved species grow, and in alpine areas there are whipcord species with leaves reduced to thick scales.

==Taxonomy==
There are differing classifications for the genus. The former genus &quot;Hebe&quot;, together with the related Australasian genera &quot;Chionohebe&quot;, &quot;Derwentia&quot;, &quot;Detzneria&quot;, &quot;Parahebe&quot;, &quot;Heliohebe&quot; and &quot;Leonohebe&quot; are now included in the larger genus &quot;Veronica&quot; (hence the common name shrubby veronicas).

==Cultivation==
Hebes are valued in gardens in temperate climates as evergreen shrubs with decorative (sometimes variegated) leaves. The flowers, in shades of blue, purple, pink or white, appear throughout summer and autumn. Their ability to withstand salt-laden winds makes them especially suited to coastal areas, for instance the South West of England, where they are often grown as hedges. Prostrate varieties can be used as groundcover.

Hebes cope with most soil types, and can be propagated easily from both seed and cuttings. Wild hybrids in section &quot;Hebe&quot; are uncommon; however, there are many cultivated hybrids, such as &quot;Veronica&quot; × &quot;franciscana&quot;.

The Hebe Society, formed in 1985 under the auspices of the British Royal Horticultural Society, promotes the cultivation and conservation of hebes and other New Zealand native plants.

<text>Assisi (, ; ; from ; Central Italian: &quot;Ascesi&quot;) is a town and commune of Italy in the Province of Perugia in the Umbria region, on the western flank of Monte Subasio.

It is generally regarded as the birthplace of the Latin poet Propertius, born around 50–45 BC. It is the birthplace of St. Francis, who founded the Order of Friars Minor in that town in 1208, and of St. Clare of Assisi (&quot;Chiara d&#x27;Offreducci&quot;), who, with St. Francis, founded the Order of Poor Ladies, which later became the Order of Poor Clares after her death. The 19th-century St. Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows was also born in Assisi.

== History ==
The earliest attested people of Assisi were the Umbri. In 77AD Pliny the Elder described Regio VI Umbria and said that the Umbri were thought to be the oldest inhabitants of Italy. The people of Assisi were mentioned by name. The Romans took control of central Italy after the Battle of Sentinum in 295 BC. They built the flourishing &quot;municipium&quot; Asisium on a series of terraces on Monte Subasio. Roman remains can still be found in Assisi: city walls, the forum (now Piazza del Comune), a theatre, an amphitheatre and the Temple of Minerva (now transformed into the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva). In 1997, the remains of a Roman villa were also discovered containing several well-preserved rooms with frescoes and mosaics in a condition rarely found outside sites such as Pompei.

The Augustan age poet Propertius is considered to have been born in what is now the city of Assisi.

In 238 AD Assisi was converted to Christianity by bishop Rufino, who was martyred at Costano. According to tradition, his remains rest in the Cathedral Church of San Rufino in Assisi.

The Ostrogoths of king Totila destroyed most of the town in 545. Assisi then came under the rule of the Lombards as part of the Lombard and then Frankish Duchy of Spoleto.

The thriving commune became an independent Ghibelline commune in the 11th century. Constantly struggling with the Guelph Perugia, it was during one of those battles, the battle at Collestrada, that Giovanni di Bernardone (better known as St. Francis of Assisi) was taken prisoner, setting in motion the events that eventually led him to live as a beggar, renounce the world and establish the Order of Friars Minor.

The city, which had remained within the confines of the Roman walls, began to expand outside these walls in the 13th century. In this period the city was under papal jurisdiction. The Rocca Maggiore, the imperial fortress on top of the hill above the city, which had been plundered by the people in 1189, was rebuilt in 1367 on orders of the papal legate, cardinal Gil de Albornoz.

In the beginning, Assisi fell under the rule of Perugia and later under several despots, such as the soldier of fortune Biordo Michelotti, Gian Galeazzo Visconti and his successor Francesco I Sforza, dukes of Milan, Jacopo Piccinino and Federico II da Montefeltro, lord of Urbino. The city went into a deep decline through the plague of the Black Death in 1348.

The city came again under papal jurisdiction under the rule of Pope Pius II (1458–1464).

In 1569 construction was started of the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli. During the Renaissance and in later centuries, the city continued to develop peacefully, as the 17th-century palazzi of the Bernabei and Giacobetti attest.

Now the site of many a pilgrimage, Assisi is linked in legend with its native son, St. Francis. The gentle saint founded the Franciscan order and shares honours with St. Catherine of Siena as the patron saint of Italy. He is remembered by many, even non-Christians, as a lover of nature (his preaching to an audience of birds is one of the legends of his life).

During World War II Assisi was occupied by Nazi Germany in September 1943. To save Jews in Italy the Catholic Church started the Assisi Network and hid Jews in the city. As the Allies moved up Italy, Germany declared Assisi an open city and pulled out, turning the city over to Italian partisans. The 12th Royal Lancers (Prince of Wales) entered the city on 17 June 1944. Colonel Valentin Müller, a German medical officer and a Catholic, was able to make Assisi a German hospital city for German troops in Italy in the summer of 1944, helping save Assisi from destruction, unlike Cassino.

Assisi was hit by two devastating earthquakes that shook Umbria in September 1997. But the recovery and restoration have been remarkable, although much remains to be done. Massive damage was caused to many historical sites, but the major attraction, the Basilica di San Francesco, reopened less than 2 years later.

== Main sights ==
UNESCO collectively designated the Franciscan structures of Assisi as a World Heritage Site in 2000.

=== Churches ===
* Basilica of San Francesco d&#x27;Assisi (St. Francis): The Franciscan monastery, il Sacro Convento, and the lower and upper church (Italian: &quot;Basilica inferiore&quot; and &quot;Basilica superiore&quot;) of St Francis were begun immediately after his canonization in 1228, and completed in 1253. The lower church has frescoes by the late-medieval artists Cimabue and Giotto; the upper church houses frescoes of scenes in the life of St. Francis previously ascribed to Giotto, but now thought to be by artists of the circle of Pietro Cavallini from Rome. The Basilica was badly damaged by a 5.5 earthquake on 26 September 1997, during which part of the vault collapsed, killing four people inside the church and carrying with it a fresco by Cimabue. The edifice was closed for two years for restoration.
*Basilica of Santa Chiara (St. Clare): church, begun in 1257, with its massive lateral buttresses, rose window, and simple Gothic interior; and 13th‑century frescoes and paintings. It contains the tomb of the namesake saint. 
*Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli (St. Mary of the Angels); a large baroque church built to contain: 
** The Porziuncola, a chapel restored by St. Francis next to which was constructed the first convent of the Order of Friars Minor;
** The Transito, chapel built in the cell where St. Francis died. 
*Church of San Damiano one of the churches restored by St. Francis and the location of one of his most famous visions, given to St. Clare as a home for the first Poor Clares. 
*Cathedral of San Rufino (St. Rufinus): church with a façade in Romanesque style with three rose windows and a 16th‑century interior; part of it is built on a cistern from the Roman era. Location of the baptism of both St. Francis and St. Clare and the surviving font carved out of a granite Roman column.
*Chiesa Nuova: church built over the presumed parental home of St. Francis. 
* The Piccolino Chapel, legendary birth place of St. Francis.
*Eremo delle Carceri: a small monastery with a church at a canyon above the town, where St. Francis retreated and preached to birds
*Church of &quot;San Pietro&quot; (St. Peter): monastery built by the Benedictines in the 10th century and rebuilt in the 13th century. It has a rectangular façade with three rose windows; the Gothic chapel of the Holy Sacrament houses a triptych by Matteo di Gualdo.
*Santa Maria Maggiore (St. Mary the Greater): earliest extant church in Assisi and former cathedral.
*Santo Stefano: one of the oldest churches of Assisi.

=== Other landmarks ===

The town is dominated by two medieval castles. The larger, called &quot;Rocca Maggiore&quot;, is a massive reconstruction by Cardinal Albornoz (1366) and expanded by popes Pius II (polygonal tower, 1458) and Paul III (the cylindrical bastion near the entrance, 1535–1538). The smaller of the two was built in Roman era: it has been only partially preserved, a small portion and three towers being open to the public.

Other sights include:
*the Roman amphitheater, built in the early 1st century AD. Its elliptical plan is identifiable from the medieval houses built around it, and from an arch of travertine cunei. The arena now houses a garden.
*the &quot;Piazza del Comune&quot; (&quot;Communal Square&quot;), with the &quot;Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo&quot; (mid-13th century, featuring a series of merlons added in 1927), the adjoining &quot;Torre del Popolo&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Tower&quot;, 1305) the &quot;Palazzo dei Priori&quot; (&quot;Palace of the Priors&quot;, 1275–1493). The fountains with three lions on the southern side date from the 16th century.
*The Temple of Minerva, facing the &quot;Piazza del Comune&quot;
*The crypt of the demolished church of &quot;San Nicolò di Piazza&quot; also located on the &quot;Piazza del Comune&quot;, where St. Francis and Bernard of Quintavalle consulted the text of the Gospels when forming the earliest Franciscan Rule. 
*The abbey of St. Benedict, founded in the 10th century on the Monte Subasio. Remains include the crypt (late 11th century), the apse and the external walls.
=== Art ===
:&quot;See also &quot;

Assisi has had a rich tradition of art through the centuries and is now home to a number of well-known artistic works.

Artists Pietro Lorenzetti and Simone Martini worked shoulder to shoulder at Assisi. The Basilica of San Francesco d&#x27;Assisi includes a number of artistic works. Simone Martini&#x27;s 1317 fresco there reflects the influence of Giotto in realism and the use of brilliant colours. Lorenzetti&#x27;s fresco at the lower church of the Basilica includes a series of panels depicting the Crucifixion of Jesus, Deposition from the Cross, and Entombment of Christ. The figures Lorenzetti painted display emotions, yet the figures in these scenes are governed by geometric emotional interactions, unlike many prior depictions which appeared to be independent iconic aggregations. Lorenzetti&#x27;s 1330 Madonna dei Tramonti also reflects the ongoing influence of Giotto on his Marian art, midway through his career.
== Culture ==

The Calendimaggio Festival takes place on the first four days of May ending on a Saturday. The festival is a re-enactment of medieval and Renaissance life in the form of a challenge between the upper faction (parte de sopra) with a blue flag and the lower faction of the town (parte de sotto) with a red flag. It includes processions, theatrical presentations, choirs, crossbow, flag-waving and dancing contests.

Assisi Embroidery is a form of counted-thread embroidery which has been practised in Assisi since the 13th century.

Today many groups gather in Assisi for a variety of cultural and religious activities. One such group restored an 11th-century room and added altars to the world&#x27;s religions. Other organizations, such as Assisi Performing Arts, host musical performances and other cultural events.

== Saints ==
Assisi was the home of several saints, including:

*Agnes of Assisi
*Clare of Assisi
*Francis of Assisi
*Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows
*Rufinus of Assisi
*Vitalis of Assisi
*Sylvester of Assisi
It is also the final resting place of Blessed Carlo Acutis

== Transport ==
Assisi railway station, opened in 1866, forms part of the Foligno–Terontola railway, which also links Florence with Rome. The station is located at Piazza Dante Alighieri, in the frazione of Santa Maria degli Angeli, about southwest of the city centre.

== International relations ==
===Twin towns – sister cities===
Assisi is twinned with:

* Bethlehem, Palestine
* San Francisco, United States
* Santiago de Compostela, Spain
* Wadowice, Poland
=== Others ===

The two papal basilicas sited in Assisi (the only ones not in Rome) gave their name to the two major cities in California: &quot;San Francisco&quot; and &quot;St. Mary of the Angels at the Porziuncula&quot;.

<text>Assisi embroidery is a form of counted-thread embroidery based on an ancient Italian needlework tradition in which the background is filled with embroidery stitches and the main motifs are outlined but not stitched. The name is derived from the Italian town of Assisi where the modern form of the craft originated.

==Description of the technique==
Assisi work uses a method known as voiding in which cross-stitch fills the background while the motif itself is left blank. Holbein stitch, a style of linear blackwork, is used to outline and emphasize the motif and to create surrounding decorative scrollwork.
Traditionally, Assisi embroidery was rarely executed in cross-stitch but was most often in long-armed cross-stitch. Examples employing other stitches, such as Italian cross-stitch and Algerian plait stitch, are also known. The colours of thread used were red, blue, green or gold for the background and black or brown for the outlines. Traditional motifs were largely heraldic, especially heraldic beasts, and typically featured symmetrically arranged pairs of animals and birds surrounded by ornate filigree borders.

In the oldest pieces, the figures were drawn freehand on the fabric and surrounded with Holbein stitch. The background, often cream linen, was filled as well as possible. For more modern pieces the pattern was constructed carefully on a paper grid in much the same way as counted cross-stitch patterns are created. Today Assisi embroidery is nearly always done this way.

==History==
Historically, Italy has had a long tradition of bright and colourful embroidery. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries monastic embroideries developed a simpler style where designs and motifs were voided on fine linen cloth with the outlines and background embroidered in coloured silk. Motifs were strongly influenced by traditional designs of bird or animal pairs surrounded by elaborate scrollwork. These early articles were most often used for religious purposes, e.g., altar cloths and chasubles.

By the sixteenth century Assisi work had become more popular and employed a wider range of motifs, many based on Renaissance imagery of satyrs, demons and ancient mythical creatures.

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, however, this form of embroidery fell into decline and many of the designs and motifs were lost. It was only at the turn of the twentieth century that the practice was revived in the Italian town of Assisi from which this form of embroidery gets its name. St. Anne&#x27;s Convent in October 1902 established the Laboratorio Ricreativo Festivo Femminile San Francesco di Assisi. The aim of this handicrafts workshop was to revive traditional local handicrafts and provide employment to poor women to supplement their incomes. This cottage industry flourished and these designs using the counted thread technique quickly spread throughout Italy, Europe and further abroad.

==Modern Assisi work==
A modern version of Assisi embroidery has been evolving in the twenty-first century. Many different colours and patterns are used for the background, and the motifs are extremely varied. However, the revived traditional version is still practised in the town of Assisi where one can see the local women sitting in front of their houses and embroidering Assisi work items for the local co-operative embroidery shop.

<doc id="81709" wikidata="Q878246" url="?curid=81709" title="Cinyras">
<text>In Greek mythology, Cinyras (; – &quot;Kinyras&quot;) was a famous hero and king of Cyprus. Accounts vary significantly as to his genealogy and provide a variety of stories concerning him; in many sources he is associated with the cult of Aphrodite on Cyprus, and Adonis, a consort of Aphrodite, is mentioned as his son. Some scholars have proposed a connection with the minor Ugaritic deity Kinnaru, the god of the lyre. The city Cinyreia on Cyprus was believed to have taken its name from Cinyras. According to Strabo, he had previously ruled in the city of Byblos in Phoenicia.

== Biography ==
The name Cinyras does not appear again until he is mentioned by Pindar as &quot;beloved of Apollo,&quot; and the priest of Aphrodite. Pindar mentions Cinyras as being fabulously rich in &quot;Nemean Ode 8&quot; line 18.

Later, in Greek and Roman literature and in the Christian fathers such as Clement of Alexandria, the story of Cinyras is elaborated. They say that on Cyprus, Cinyras was revered as the creator of art and of musical instruments, such as the flute. In one source, he is also noted for his physical beauty. It is believed that his name comes from the Phoenician word kinnor (Greek: κινύρα) – an eastern string instrument. It is quite possible that it was a deliberate play on words, because the legend says that Cinyras was a singer and he posed a musical challenge to Apollo and tested his abilities, for which the god Mars took his life.

If Cinyras was the Cinyra, mentioned by Pliny, who was the son of Agriopas and a Cyprian, he was credited with inventing tiles and discovering copper-mines, both of which were found in the island. He was also regarded as the inventor of tongs, the hammer, the lever, and the anvil.

== Family ==
According to the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, Cinyras was a descendant of Eos and Cephalus. His parents were Sandocus, son of Astynous (himself son of Phaethon), and Pharnace, daughter of King Megassares of Hyria. Cinyras&#x27; father, Sandocus was an immigrant from Syria who settled in Cilicia and founded a city Celenderis. Cinyras upon his arrival in Cyprus with some of his people, founded the town of Paphos and married Metharme, daughter of King Pygmalion of Cyprus. His children according to Pseudo-Apollodorus were Adonis and Oxyporos, and also daughters Braesia, Laogora and Orsedice. These maidens, by reason of the wrath of Aphrodite, cohabited with foreigners, and ended their life in Egypt. Another daughter, Laodice who married Elatus, son of Arcas, and had by him two sons Stymphalus and Pereus.

Pausanias mentions a daughter of Cinyras as the consort of Teucer, who is known to have received the kingdom of Cyprus from Belus of Tyre for having assisted him in the invasion of the island. Her name is not given in Pausanias&#x27; account, but Tzetzes writes that Teucer married Eune &quot;daughter of Cyprus&quot;.

Stephanus of Byzantium informs us that Cinyras&#x27; mother was named Amathousa, and it was either from her or Amathous, a son of Heracles, that Amathous, the oldest city of Cyprus, received its name. Stephanus also mentions three otherwise unknown children of Cinyras: a daughter Cyprus, who had the island named after her, and two sons, Koureus and Marieus, eponyms of the towns Kourion and Marion respectively.

Hesychius says Cinyras was a son of Apollo, while Hyginus consistently calls him a son of Paphos (presumably the eponym of Paphos), and a scholiast on Pindar makes him a son of Eurymedon and the nymph Paphia. In other sources, he is the husband of Galatea. Cinyras was also called the father of Myrrha. Hesychius also mentions a daughter of Cinyras, Myrice who mourned so much she was transformed into a tamarisk tree.

Another son, Amaracus, who served as the royal perfumer of the court is mentioned by Servius.

== Mythology ==

=== Trojan War ===
In the earliest testimony for this character in ancient Greek literature (the account of Homer), Cinyras was a ruler on Cyprus who gave a corselet to Agamemnon as a guest-gift when he heard that the Greeks were planning to sail to Troy. Eustathius in his commentary on this passage relates that Cinyras promised assistance to Agamemnon, but did not keep his word: having promised to send fifty ships, he actually sent only one commanded by the son of Mygdalion, while the rest were sculpted from earth, with figures of men (also made of earth) imitating the crew. He was cursed by Agamemnon and subsequently punished by Apollo, who beat him in a musical contest (similar to that between Apollo and Marsyas, to see who was a better musician with a lyre) and killed him, whereupon Cinyras&#x27; fifty daughters threw themselves into the sea and were changed into sea birds (alcyones).

=== Myrrha ===
According to Ovid, Cinyras&#x27; daughter Myrrha, impelled by an unnatural lust for her own father (in retribution for her mother Cenchreis&#x27; hubris), slept with him, became pregnant, and asked the gods to change her into something other than human; she became a tree from whose bark myrrh drips. From this incestuous union sprang the child Adonis. Cinyras was said to have committed suicide over the matter. Other authors equate Cinyras and Myrrha with king Theias of Assyria and his daughter Smyrna, and relate the same story of them. Hyginus uses the name Cinyras for the father, but Smyrna for the daughter.

=== Priesthood of Paphian Aphrodite ===
Clement of Alexandria in his &quot;Protrepticus&quot; talks about the &quot;Cyprian Islander Cinyras, who dared to bring forth from night to the light of day the lewd orgies of Aphrodite in his eagerness to deify a strumpet of his own country.&quot;

In his &quot;Histories&quot;, Tacitus relates the account of divination rites at the famous Temple of Venus at Paphos; according to traditional tales, this temple was founded by King Aerias, but others say Cinyras consecrated the temple, which was built right on the spot where the goddess had first stepped on the land after her birth from the sea. Here Tacitus describes him as having come to Cyprus from Cilicia, whence he introduced the worship of Paphian Aphrodite. The divination practices at the temple are said to have been introduced by Tamiras of Cilicia. The office of priesthood became hereditary in the families of both Cinyras (Cinyradae) and Tamiras, but the descendants of the latter were eventually displaced by those of the former; in the times of Tacitus, only the priest of Cinyras&#x27; line was consulted. The footnotes to this story also state that Cinyras is &quot;Another mythical king of Cyprus. Hesychius calls him a son of Apollo, and Ovid makes him the father of Adonis.&quot;

<doc id="81716" wikidata="Q771366" url="?curid=81716" title="Myrrha">
<text>Myrrha (; ), also known as Smyrna (), is the mother of Adonis in Greek mythology. She was transformed into a myrrh tree after having intercourse with her father, and gave birth to Adonis in tree form. Although the tale of Adonis has Semitic roots, it is uncertain where the myth of Myrrha emerged from, though it was probably from Cyprus.

The myth details the incestuous relationship between Myrrha and her father, Cinyras. Myrrha falls in love with her father and tricks him into sexual intercourse. After discovering her identity, Cinyras draws his sword and pursues Myrrha. She flees across Arabia and, after nine months, turns to the gods for help. They take pity on her and transform her into a myrrh tree. While in plant form, Myrrha gives birth to Adonis. According to legend, the aromatic exudate of the myrrh tree are Myrrha&#x27;s tears.

The most familiar form of the myth was recounted in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; of Ovid, and the story was the subject of the most famous work (now lost) of the poet Helvius Cinna. Several alternate versions appeared in the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, the &quot;Fabulae&quot; of Hyginus, and the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; of Antoninus Liberalis, with major variations depicting Myrrha&#x27;s father as the Assyrian king Theias or depicting Aphrodite as having engineered the tragic liaison. Critical interpretation of the myth has considered Myrrha&#x27;s refusal of conventional sexual relations to have provoked her incest, with the ensuing transformation to tree as a silencing punishment. It has been suggested that the taboo of incest marks the difference between culture and nature and that Ovid&#x27;s version of Myrrha showed this. A translation of Ovid&#x27;s Myrrha, by English poet John Dryden in 1700, has been interpreted as a metaphor for British politics of the time, linking Myrrha to Mary II and Cinyras to James II.

In post-classical times, Myrrha has had widespread influence in Western culture. She was mentioned in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; by Dante, was an inspiration for &quot;Mirra&quot; by Vittorio Alfieri, and was alluded to in &quot;Mathilda&quot; by Mary Shelley. In the play &quot;Sardanapalus&quot; by Byron, a character named Myrrha appeared, whom critics interpreted as a symbol of Byron&#x27;s dream of romantic love. The myth of Myrrha was one of 24 tales retold in &quot;Tales from Ovid&quot; by English poet Ted Hughes. In art, Myrrha&#x27;s seduction of her father has been illustrated by German engraver Virgil Solis, her tree-metamorphosis by French engraver Bernard Picart and Italian painter Marcantonio Franceschini, while French engraver Gustave Doré chose to depict Myrrha in Hell as a part of his series of engravings for Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. In music, she has appeared in pieces by Sousa and Ravel. She was also the inspiration for several species&#x27; scientific names and an asteroid.

==Origin and etymology==

The myth of Myrrha is closely linked to that of her son, Adonis, which has been easier to trace. &quot;Adonis&quot; is the Hellenized form of the Phoenician word &quot;&quot;adoni&quot;, meaning &quot;my lord&quot;&quot;. It is believed that the cult of Adonis was known to the Greeks from around the sixth century B.C., but it is unquestionable that they became aware of it through contact with Cyprus. Around this time, the cult of Adonis is noted in the Book of Ezekiel in Jerusalem, though under the Babylonian name Tammuz.

Adonis originally was a Phoenician god of fertility representing the spirit of vegetation. It is further speculated that he was an avatar of the version of Ba&#x27;al, worshipped in Ugarit. It is likely that lack of clarity concerning whether Myrrha was called Smyrna, and who her father was, originated in Cyprus before the Greeks first encountered the myth. However, it is clear that the Greeks added much to the Adonis-Myrrha story, before it was first recorded by classical scholars.

Over the centuries Myrrha, the girl, and myrrh, the fragrance, have been linked etymologically. Myrrh was precious in the ancient world, and was used for embalming, medicine, perfume, and incense. The Modern English word &quot;myrrh&quot; (Old English: &quot;myrra&quot;) derives from the Latin &quot;Myrrha&quot; (or &quot;murrha&quot; or &quot;murra&quot;, all are synonymous Latin words for the tree substance). The Latin &quot;Myrrha&quot; originated from the Ancient Greek &quot;múrrā&quot;, but, ultimately, the word is of Semitic origin, with roots in the Arabic &quot;murr&quot;, the Hebrew &quot;mōr&quot;, and the Aramaic &quot;mūrā&quot;, all meaning &quot;bitter&quot; as well as referring to the plant. Regarding &quot;smyrna&quot;, the word is a Greek dialectic form of &quot;myrrha&quot;.

In the Bible, myrrh is referenced as one of the most desirable fragrances, and though mentioned alongside frankincense, it is usually more expensive. Several Old Testament passages refer to myrrh. In the Song of Solomon, which according to scholars dates to either the tenth century B.C. as a Hebrew oral tradition or to the Babylonian captivity in the 6th century B.C., myrrh is referenced seven times, making the Song of Solomon the passage in the Old Testament referring to myrrh the most, often with erotic overtones. In the New Testament the substance is famously associated with the birth of Christ when the magi presented their gifts of &quot;gold, frankincense, and myrrh&quot;.

==Myth==

===Ovid&#x27;s version===

Published in 8 A.D. the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; of Ovid has become one of the most influential poems by writers in Latin. The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; show that Ovid was more interested in questioning how laws interfered with people&#x27;s lives than writing epic tales like Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; or Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is not narrated by Ovid, but rather by the characters in the stories. The myth of Myrrha and Cinyras is sung by Orpheus in the tenth book of &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; after he has told the myth of Pygmalion and before he turns to the tale of Venus and Adonis. As the myth of Myrrha is also the longest tale sung by Orpheus (205 lines) and the only story that corresponds to his announced theme of girls punished for forbidden desire, it is considered the centerpiece of the song. Ovid opens the myth with a warning to the audience that this is a myth of great horror, especially to fathers and daughters:
The story I am going to tell is a horrible one: I beg that daughters and fathers should hold themselves aloof, while I sing, or if they find my songs enchanting, let them refuse to believe this part of my tale, and suppose that it never happened: or else, if they believe that it did happen, they must believe also in the punishment that followed.
According to Ovid, Myrrha was the daughter of King Cinyras and Queen Cenchreis of Cyprus. Ovid says that Cupid was not to blame for Myrrha&#x27;s incestuous love for her father, Cinyras; he comments that hating one&#x27;s father is a crime, but that Myrrha&#x27;s love was a greater crime, and blames it instead on the Furies.

Over several verses, Ovid depicts the psychic struggle Myrrha faces between her sexual desire for her father and the social shame she would face for acting on it. Sleepless, and losing all hope, she attempts suicide; however, she is discovered by her nurse, in whom she confides. The nurse tries to make Myrrha suppress the infatuation, but later agrees to help Myrrha into her father&#x27;s bed if she promises that she will not try to kill herself again.

During Cerealia the worshipping women, including Queen Cenchreis, Myrrha&#x27;s mother, were not to be touched by men for nine nights. Myrrha&#x27;s nurse told King Cinyras of a girl deeply in love with him, giving a false name. The affair lasted several nights in complete darkness to conceal Myrrha&#x27;s identity, until Cinyras wanted to know the identity of his paramour. Upon bringing in a lamp, and seeing his daughter, the king attempted to kill her on the spot, but Myrrha escaped.

Thereafter Myrrha walked in exile for nine months, past the palms of Arabia and the fields of Panchaea, until she reached Sabaea. Afraid of death and tired of life, and pregnant as well, she begged the gods for a solution, and was transformed into the myrrh tree, with the sap thereof representing her tears. Later, Lucina freed the newborn Adonis from the tree.

===Other versions===
The myth of Myrrha has been chronicled in several other works than Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Among the scholars who recounted it are Apollodorus, Hyginus, and Antoninus Liberalis. All three versions differ.

In his &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, written around the 1st century B.C., Apollodorus tells of three possible parentages for Adonis. In the first he states that Cinyras arrived in Cyprus with a few followers and founded Paphos, and that he married Metharme, eventually becoming king of Cyprus through her family. Cinyras had five children by Metharme: the two boys, Oxyporos and Adonis, and three daughters, Orsedice, Laogore, and Braisia. The daughters at some point became victims of Aphrodite&#x27;s wrath and had intercourse with foreigners, ultimately dying in Egypt.

For the second possible parentage of Adonis, Apollodorus quotes Hesiod, who postulates that Adonis could be the child of Phoenix and Alphesiboea. He elaborates no further on this statement.

For the third option, he quotes Panyasis, who states that King Theias of Assyria had a daughter called Smyrna. Smyrna failed to honor Aphrodite, incurring the wrath of the goddess, by whom was made to fall in love with her father; and with the aid of her nurse she deceived him for twelve nights until her identity was discovered. Smyrna fled, but her father later caught up with her. Smyrna then prayed that the gods would make her invisible, prompting them to turn her into a tree, which was named the Smyrna. Ten months later the tree cracked and Adonis was born from it.

In his &quot;Fabulae&quot;, written around 1 A.D., Hyginus states that King Cinyras of Assyria had a daughter by his wife, Cenchreis. The daughter was named Smyrna and the mother boasted that her child excelled even Venus in beauty. Angered, Venus punished the mother by cursing Smyrna to fall in love with her father. After the nurse had prevented Smyrna from committing suicide, she helped her engage her father in sexual intercourse. When Smyrna became pregnant, she hid in the woods from shame. Venus pitied the girl&#x27;s fate, changing her into a myrrh tree, from which was born Adonis.

In the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by Antoninus Liberalis, written somewhere in the 2nd or 3rd century A.D., the myth is set in Phoenicia, near Mount Lebanon. Here King Thias, son of Belus and Orithyia, had a daughter named Smyrna. Being of great beauty, she was sought by men from far and wide. She had devised many tricks in order to delay her parents and defer the day they would choose a husband for her. Smyrna had been driven mad by desire for her father and did not want anybody else. At first she hid her desires, eventually telling her nurse, Hippolyte, the secret of her true feelings. Hippolyte told the king that a girl of exalted parentage wanted to lie with him, but in secret. The affair lasted for an extended period of time, and Smyrna became pregnant. At this point, Thias desired to know who she was so he hid a light, illuminating the room and discovering Smyrna&#x27;s identity when she entered. In shock, Smyrna gave birth prematurely to her child. She then raised her hands and said a prayer, which was heard by Zeus who took pity on her and turned her into a tree. Thias killed himself, and it was on the wish of Zeus that the child was brought up and named Adonis.

In a rare version, Myrrha&#x27;s curse was inflicted on her by Helios, the sun god, over some unclear insult, which might reflect the role the Sun has in the myrrh&#x27;s production, but nevertheless this version was far from being a popular one.

==Interpretation==
The myth of Myrrha has been interpreted in various ways. The transformation of Myrrha in Ovid&#x27;s version has been interpreted as a punishment for her breaking the social rules through her incestuous relationship with her father. Like Byblis who fell in love with her brother, Myrrha is transformed and rendered voiceless making her unable to break the taboo of incest.

Myrrha has also been thematically linked to the story of Lot&#x27;s daughters. They live with their father in an isolated cave and because their mother is dead they decide to befuddle Lot&#x27;s mind with wine and seduce him in order to keep the family alive through him. Nancy Miller comments on the two myths:

[Lot&#x27;s daughters&#x27;] incest is sanctioned by reproductive necessity; because it lacks consequences, this story is not a socially recognized narrative paradigm for incest. [...] In the cases of both Lot&#x27;s daughters and Myrrha, the daughter&#x27;s seduction of the father has to be covert. While other incest configurations - mother-son, sibling - permit consensual agency, father-daughter incest does not; when the daughter displays transgressive sexual desire, the prohibitive father appears.
Myrrha has been interpreted as developing from a girl into a woman in the course of the story: in the beginning she is a virgin refusing her suitors, in that way denying the part of herself that is normally dedicated to Aphrodite. The goddess then strikes her with desire to make love with her father and Myrrha is then made into a woman in the grip of an uncontrollable lust. The marriage between her father and mother is then set as an obstacle for her love along with incest being forbidden by the laws, profane as well as divine. The way the daughter seduces her father illustrates the most extreme version a seduction can take: the union between two persons who by social norms and laws are strictly held apart.

James Richard Ellis has argued that the incest taboo is fundamental to a civilized society. Building on Sigmund Freud&#x27;s theories and psychoanalysis this is shown in Ovid&#x27;s version of the myth of Myrrha. When the girl has been gripped by desire, she laments her humanity, for if she and her father were animals, there would be no bar to their union.

That Myrrha is transformed into a myrrh tree has also been interpreted to have influenced the character of Adonis. Being the child of both a woman and a tree he is a split person. In Ancient Greece the word Adonis could mean both &quot;perfume&quot; and &quot;lover&quot; and likewise Adonis is both the perfume made from the aromatic drops of myrrh as well as the human lover who seduces two goddesses.

In her essay &quot;What Nature Allows the Jealous Laws Forbid&quot; literary critic Mary Aswell Doll compares the love between the two male protagonists of Annie Proulx&#x27; book &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (1997) with the love Myrrha has for her father in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Doll suggests that both Ovid&#x27;s and Proulx&#x27; main concerns are civilization and its discontents and that their use of images of nature uncovers similar understandings of what is &quot;natural&quot; when it comes to who and how one should love. On the subject of Ovid’s writing about love Doll states:
In Ovid’s work no love is &quot;taboo&quot; unless it arises out of a need for power and control. A widespread instance for the latter during the Roman Empire was the practice by the elite to take nubile young girls as lovers or mistresses, girls who could be as young as daughters. Such a practice was considered normal, natural.
Cinyras&#x27; relationship with a girl on his daughter&#x27;s age was therefore not unnatural, but Myrrha&#x27;s being in love with her own father was. Doll elaborates further on this stating that Myrrha&#x27;s lamenting that animals can mate father and daughter without problems is a way for Ovid to express a paradox: in nature a father-daughter relationship is not unnatural, but it is in human society. On this Doll concludes that &quot;Nature follows no laws. There is no such thing as &quot;natural law&quot;&quot;. Still, Ovid distances himself in three steps from the horrifying story:

First he does not tell the story himself, but has one of his in-story characters, Orpheus, sing it; second, Ovid tells his audience not even to believe the story (cf. quote in &quot;Ovid&#x27;s version&quot;); third, he has Orpheus congratulate Rome, Ovid&#x27;s home town, for its being far away from the land where this story took place (Cyprus). By distancing himself, Doll writes, Ovid lures his audience to keep listening. First then does Ovid begin telling the story describing Myrrha, her father and their relationship, which Doll compares to the mating of Cupid and Psyche: here the lovemaking occurs in complete darkness and only the initiator (Cupid) knows the identity of the other as well. Myrrha&#x27;s metamorphosing into a tree is read by Doll as a metaphor where the tree incarnates the secret. As a side effect, Doll notes, the metamorphosis also alters the idea of incest into something natural for the imagination to think about. Commenting on a Freudian analysis of the myth stating that Ovid &quot;disconcertingly suggests that [father-lust] might be an unspoken universal of human experience&quot;. Doll notes that Ovid&#x27;s stories work like metaphors: they are meant to give insight into the human psyche. Doll states that the moments when people experience moments like those of father-lust are repressed and unconscious, which means that they are a natural part of growing and that most grow out of it sometime. She concludes about Ovid and his version of Myrrha that: &quot;What is perverted, for Ovid, is the use of sex as a power tool and the blind acceptance of sexual male power as a cultural norm.&quot;

In 2008 the newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; named Myrrha&#x27;s relationship with her father as depicted in &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by Ovid as one of the top ten stories of incestuous love ever. It complimented the myth for being more disturbing than any of the other incestuous relationships depicted in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

Particularly in light of the themes of secrecy in the taboo, and the patriarchal nature of Ovid&#x27;s society, the myth may also serve to reverse the narrative on cases where the father manipulates and sexually abuses his own daughters and no actual seduction of the father by the daughter occurs, except in his own mind. This would be similar to how The Freudian Coverup theory functions socially.

==Cultural impact==

===Literature===

One of the earliest recordings of a play inspired by the myth of Myrrha is in the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, written in 93 A.D. by the Roman-Jewish historian Flavius Josephus. A tragedy entitled &quot;Cinyras&quot; is mentioned, wherein the main character, Cinyras, is to be slain along with his daughter Myrrha, and &quot;a great deal of fictitious blood was shed&quot;. No further details are given about the plot of this play.

Myrrha appears in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; poem &quot;Inferno&quot; by Dante Alighieri, where Dante sees her soul being punished in the eighth circle of Hell, in the tenth bolgia (ditch). Here she and other falsifiers such as the alchemists and the counterfeiters suffer dreadful diseases, Myrrha&#x27;s being madness. Myrrha&#x27;s suffering in the tenth bolgia indicates her most serious sin was not incest but deceit. Diana Glenn interprets the symbolism in Myrrha&#x27;s contrapasso as being that her sin is so unnatural and unlawful that she is forced to abandon human society and simultaneously she loses her identity. Her madness in Hell prevents even basic communication which attests to her being contemptuous of the social order in life.

Dante had already shown his familiarity with the myth of Myrrha in a prior letter to Emperor Henry VII, which he wrote on 17 April 1311. Here he compares Florence with &quot;Myrrha, wicked and ungodly, yearning for the embrace of her father, Cinyras&quot;; a metaphor, Claire Honess interprets as referring to the way Florence tries to &quot;seduce&quot; Pope Clement V away from Henry VII. It is incestuous because the Pope is the father of all and it is also implied that the city in that way rejects her true husband, the Emperor.

In the poem &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;, written by William Shakespeare in 1593 Venus refers to Adonis&#x27; mother. In the 34th stanza Venus is lamenting because Adonis is ignoring her approaches and in her heart-ache she says &quot;O, had thy mother borne so hard a mind, She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.&quot; Shakespeare makes a subtle reference to Myrrha later when Venus picks a flower: &quot;She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears, Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.&quot; It has been suggested that these plant juices being compared to tears are a parallel to Myrrha&#x27;s tears being the drops of myrrh exuding from the myrrh tree.

In another work of Shakespeare, &quot;Othello&quot; (1603), it has been suggested that he has made another reference. In act 5, scene 2 the main character Othello compares himself to a myrrh tree with its constant stream of tears (Myrrha&#x27;s tears). The reference is justified in the way that it draws inspiration from Book X of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, just like his previously written poem, &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;, did.

The tragedy &quot;Mirra&quot; by Vittorio Alfieri (written in 1786) is inspired by the story of Myrrha. In the play, Mirra falls in love with her father, Cinyras. Mirra is to be married to Prince Pyrrhus, but decides against it, and leaves him at the altar. In the ending, Mirra has a mental breakdown in front of her father who is infuriated because the prince has killed himself. Owning that she loves Cinyras, Mirra grabs his sword, while he recoils in horror, and kills herself.

The novella &quot;Mathilda&quot;, written by Mary Shelley in 1820, contains similarities to the myth and mentions Myrrha. Mathilda is left by her father as a baby after her birth causes the death of her mother, and she does not meet her father until he returns sixteen years later. Then he tells her that he is in love with her, and, when she refuses him, he commits suicide. In chapter 4, Mathilda makes a direct allusion: &quot;I chanced to say that I thought &quot;Myrrha&quot; the best of Alfieri&#x27;s tragedies.&quot; Audra Dibert Himes, in an essay entitled &quot;Knew shame, and knew desire&quot;, notes a more subtle reference to Myrrha: Mathilda spends the last night before her father’s arrival in the woods, but as she returns home the next morning the trees seemingly attempt to encompass her. Himes suggests that the trees can be seen as a parallel to Ovid’s metamorphosed Myrrha.

The tragedy &quot;Sardanapalus&quot; by George Gordon Byron published in 1821 and produced in 1834 is set in Assyria, 640 B.C., under King Sardanapalus. The play deals with the revolt against the extravagant king and his relationship to his favourite slave Myrrha. Myrrha made Sardanapalus appear at the head of his armies, but after winning three successive battles in this way he was eventually defeated. A beaten man, Myrrha persuaded Sardanapalus to place himself on a funeral pyre which she would ignite and subsequently leap onto - burning them both alive. The play has been interpreted as an autobiography, with Sardanapalus as Byron&#x27;s alter ego, Zarina as Byron&#x27;s wife Anne Isabella, and Myrrha as his mistress Teresa. At a more abstract level Myrrha is the desire for freedom driving those who feel trapped or bound, as well as being the incarnation of Byron&#x27;s dream of romantic love. Byron knew the story of the mythical Myrrha, if not directly through Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, then at least through Alfieri&#x27;s &quot;Mirra&quot;, which he was familiar with. In her essay &quot;A Problem Few Dare Imitate&quot;, Susan J. Wolfson phrases and interprets the relation of the play &quot;Sardanapalus&quot; and the myth of Myrrha:

Although [Byron&#x27;s] own play evades the full import of this complicated association, Myrrha&#x27;s name means that it [the name&#x27;s referring to incest, red.] cannot be escaped entirely - especially since Ovid&#x27;s story of Myrrha&#x27;s incest poses a potential reciprocal to the nightmare Byron invents for Sardanapalus, of sympathy with the son who is the object of his mother&#x27;s &#x27;incest&#x27;.
In 1997 the myth of Myrrha and Cinyras was one of 24 tales from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; that were retold by English poet Ted Hughes in his poetical work &quot;Tales from Ovid&quot;. The work was praised for not directly translating, but instead retelling the story in a language which was as fresh and new for the audience today as Ovid&#x27;s texts were to his contemporary audience. Hughes was also complimented on his achievements in using humour or horror when describing Myrrha or a flood, respectively. The work received critical acclaim winning the Whitbread Book Of The Year Award 1997 and being adapted to the stage in 1999, starring Sirine Saba as Myrrha.

In 1997 American poet Frank Bidart wrote &quot;Desire&quot;, which was another retelling of the myth of Myrrha as it was presented in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by Ovid. The case of Myrrha, critic Langdon Hammer notes, is the worst possible made against desire, because the story of Myrrha shows how sex can lead people to destroy others as well as themselves. He comments that &quot;the &quot;precious bitter resin&quot; into which Myrrha&#x27;s tears are changed tastes bitter &quot;and&quot; sweet, like &quot;Desire&quot; as a whole&quot;. He further writes: &quot;The inescapability of desire makes Bidart&#x27;s long story of submission to it a kind of affirmation. Rather than aberrant, the Ovidian characters come to feel exemplary&quot;.

Myrrha - or Smyrna - is also mentioned in André Aciman&#x27;s 2019 novel Find Me.

====John Dryden&#x27;s translation====
In 1700 English poet John Dryden published his translations of myths by Ovid, Homer, and Boccaccio in the volume &quot;Fables, Ancient and Modern&quot;. Literary critic Anthony W. Lee notes in his essay &quot;Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Cinyras and Myrrha&quot;&quot; that this translation, along with several others, can be interpreted as a subtle comment on the political scene of the late seventeenth-century England.

The translation of the myth of Myrrha as it appeared in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is suggested as being a critique of the political settlement that followed the Glorious Revolution. The wife of the leader of this revolution, William of Orange, was Mary, daughter of James II. Mary and William were crowned king and queen of England in 1689, and because Dryden was deeply sympathetic to James he lost his public offices and fell into political disfavor under the new reign. Dryden turned to translation and infused these translations with political satire in response - the myth of Myrrha being one of these translations.

In the opening lines of the poem Dryden describes King Cinyras just as Ovid did as a man who had been happier if he had not become a father. Lee suggests that this is a direct parallel to James who could have been counted as happier if he had not had his daughter, Mary, who betrayed him and usurped his monarchical position. When describing the act of incest Dryden uses a monster metaphor. Those lines are suggested as aimed at William III who invaded England from the Netherlands and whose presence Dryden describes as a curse or a punishment, according to Lee. A little further on the Convention Parliament is indicted. Lee suggests that Dryden critiques the intrusiveness of the Convention Parliament, because it acted without constituted legal authority. Finally the daughter, Mary as Myrrha, is described as an impious outcast from civilization, whose greatest sin was her disrupting the natural line of succession thereby breaking both natural as well as divine statutes which resulted in fundamental social confusion. When Myrrha craves and achieves her father&#x27;s (Cinyras&#x27;) bed, Lee sees a parallel to Mary&#x27;s ascending James&#x27; throne: both daughters incestuously occupied the place which belonged to their fathers.

Reading the translation of the myth of Myrrha by Dryden as a comment on the political scene, states Lee, is partly justified by the characterization done by the historian Julian Hoppit on the events of the revolution of 1688:
To most a monarch was God&#x27;s earthly representative, chosen by Him for the benefit of His people. For men to meddle in that choice was to tamper with the divine order, the inevitable price of which was chaos.
===Music===

In music, Myrrha was the subject of an 1876 band piece by John Philip Sousa, &quot;Myrrha Gavotte&quot; and in 1901, Maurice Ravel and André Caplet each wrote cantatas titled &quot;Myrrha&quot;. Caplet finished first over Ravel who was third in the Prix de Rome competition. The competition required that the candidates jumped through a series of academic hoops before entering the final where they were to compose a cantata on a prescribed text. Though it was not the best musical piece, the jury praised Ravel&#x27;s work for its &quot;melodic charm&quot; and &quot;sincerity of dramatic sentiment&quot;. Musical critic Andrew Clements writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented on Ravel&#x27;s failures at winning the competition: &quot;Ravel&#x27;s repeated failure to win the Prix de Rome, the most coveted prize for young composers in France at the turn of the 20th century, has become part of musical folklore.&quot;

Italian composer Domenico Alaleona&#x27;s only opera, premiering in 1920, was entitled &quot;Mirra&quot;. The libretto drew on the legend of Myrrha while the music was inspired by Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; (1902) as well as Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Elektra&quot; (1909). Suffering from being monotonic, the final showdown between father and daughter, the critics commented, was the only part really making an impact. &quot;Mirra&quot; remains Alaleona&#x27;s most ambitious composition and though the music tended to be &quot;eclectic and uneven&quot;, it showed &quot;technical enterprise&quot;.

More recently, Kristen Kuster created a choral orchestration, &quot;Myrrha&quot;, written in 2004 and first performed at Carnegie Hall in 2006. Kuster stated that the idea for &quot;Myrrha&quot; came when she was asked by the American Composers Orchestra to write a love-and-erotica themed concert. The concert was inspired by the myth of Myrrha in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; and includes excerpts from the volume that &quot;move in and out of the music as though in a dream, or perhaps Myrrha’s memory of the events that shaped her fate,&quot; as described by Kuster.

=== Art ===

The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; of Ovid has been illustrated by several artists through time. In 1563 in Frankfurt, a German bilingual translation by Johann Posthius was published, featuring the woodcuts of renowned German engraver Virgil Solis. The illustration of Myrrha depicts Myrrha&#x27;s deceiving her father as well as her fleeing from him. In 1717 in London, a Latin-English edition of &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; was published, translated by Samuel Garth and with plates of French engraver Bernard Picart. The illustration of Myrrha was entitled &quot;The Birth of Adonis&quot; and featured Myrrha as a tree delivering Adonis while surrounded by women. In 1857 French engraver Gustave Doré made a series of illustrations to Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, the depiction of Myrrha showing her in the eighth circle of Hell.

In 1690, Italian Baroque painter Marcantonio Franceschini depicted Myrrha as a tree while delivering Adonis in &quot;The Birth of Adonis&quot;. The painting was included in the art exhibition &quot;Captured Emotions: Baroque Painting in Bologna, 1575-1725&quot; at the J. Paul Getty Museum at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, California which lasted from December 16, 2008 through May 3, 2009. Normally the painting is exhibited in the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (English: Dresden State Art Collections) in Germany as a part of the &quot;Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister&quot; (English: Old Masters Picture Gallery).

In 1984, artist Mel Chin created a sculpture based on Doré&#x27;s illustration of Myrrha for the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. The sculpture was titled &quot;Myrrha of the Post Industrial World&quot; and depicted a nude woman sitting on a rectangular pedestal. It was an outdoor project in Bryant Park, and the skin of the sculpture was made of perforated steel. Inside was a visible skeleton of polystyrene. When finished, the sculpture was 29 feet tall.

===Science===

Several metamorphosing insects&#x27; scientific names reference the myth. &quot;Myrrha&quot; is a genus of ladybug beetles, such as the 18-spot ladybird (&quot;Myrrha octodecimguttata&quot;). &quot;Libythea myrrha&quot;, the club beak, is a butterfly native to India. &quot;Polyommatus myrrha&quot; is a rare species of butterfly named by Gottlieb August Wilhelm Herrich-Schäffer found on Mount Erciyes in south-eastern Turkey. &quot;Catocala myrrha&quot; is a synonym for a species of moth known as married underwing. In total the United Kingdom&#x27;s Natural History Museum lists seven Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) with the myrrha name.

Myrrh is a bitter-tasting, aromatic, yellow to reddish brown gum. It is obtained from small thorny flowering trees of the genus &quot;Commiphora&quot;, which is a part of the incense-tree family (Burseraceae). There are two main varieties of myrrh: bisabol and herabol. Bisabol is produced by &quot;C. erythraea&quot;, an Arabian species similar to the &quot;C. myrrha&quot;, which produces the herabol myrrh. &quot;C. myrrha&quot; grows in Ethiopia, Arabia, and Somalia.

A large asteroid, measuring is named 381 Myrrha. It was discovered and named on January 10, 1894 by A. Charlois at Nice. The mythical Myrrha inspired the name and her son, Adonis, is the name given to another asteroid, 2101 Adonis. Using classical names like Myrrha, Juno, and Vesta when naming minor planets was standard custom at the time when 381 Myrrha was discovered. It was the general opinion that using numbers instead might lead to unnecessary confusion.

<text>In Greek mythology, Theias () was the King of Assyria and father of Myrrha and Adonis. The birth of Adonis existed in two different versions:

#The most commonly accepted version is that Aphrodite urged Myrrha or Smyrna to commit incest with her father, Theias. Myrrha&#x27;s nurse helped with the scheme. When Theias discovered this, he flew into a rage, chasing his daughter with a knife. The gods turned her into a myrrh tree and Adonis eventually sprung from this tree. 
#It was also said that Myrrha fled from her father and Aphrodite turned her into a tree. Adonis was then born when Theias shot an arrow into the tree or when a boar used its tusks to tear the tree&#x27;s bark off.

<doc id="81720" wikidata="Q729332" url="?curid=81720" title="Helenus (son of Priam)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Helenus (; , &quot;Helenos&quot;, ) was a gentle and clever seer. He was also a Trojan prince as the son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy, and the twin brother of the prophetess Cassandra.

== Mythology ==

=== Early years ===
In the earliest sources, Helenus and his sister Cassandra were given the power of prophecy by Apollo after their ears were licked by snakes. In other sources, Helenus was taught the power by Cassandra, but others generally believed his predictions. After gaining foresight, he was renamed from Scamandrius to Helenus by a Thracian soothsayer. Helenus predicted that if Alexander (&quot;Paris&quot;) brought home a Greek wife (i.e. Helen), the Achaeans would pursue, and overpower Troy and slay his parents and brothers.

=== Trojan War ===
Helenus is described by Homer as being the greatest of augurs. He advises Hector to challenge any Achaean to a duel, which Telemonian Ajax accepts. Helenus led the third battalion of the Trojan forces along with his brother Deiphobus. He was also part of the Trojan forces led by his brother Hector that beat the Greeks back from the plains west of Troy, and attacked their camp in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. He is wounded in the hand by Menelaus and forced to retreat.

In the final year of the Trojan War, Helenus vied against his brother Deiphobus for the hand of Helen after the death of their brother Paris, but Helen was awarded to Deiphobus. Disgruntled over his loss, Helenus retreated to Mount Ida, where Odysseus later captured him. He tells Odysseus, perhaps after torture or coercion, how to capture Troy: they would win if they stole the Trojan Palladium, brought the bones of Pelops to Troy, and persuaded Neoptolemus (Achilles&#x27; son by the Scyrian princess Deidamia) and Philoctetes (who possessed Heracles&#x27; bow and arrows) to join the Greeks in the war. Neoptolemus was hiding from the war at Scyrus, but the Greeks retrieved him.

=== Aftermath ===
Neoptolemus had taken Andromache, Helenus&#x27;s sister-in-law and Hector&#x27;s widow, as a slave and concubine after the fall of Troy, and fathered Molossus, Pielus and Pergamus with her. After the fall of Troy, Helenus went with Neoptolemus, according to Apollodorus&#x27; Epitome 6.13. He traveled with Neoptolemus, Andromache and their children to Epirus, where Neoptolemus permitted him to found the city of Buthrotum. After Neoptolemus left Epirus, he left Andromache and their sons in Helenus&#x27;s care.

Neoptolemus was killed by Orestes, Agamemmon&#x27;s son, in a dispute over Hermione, the daughter of Menelaus and Helen, whom Orestes had been promised as wife, but whom Neoptolemus had taken. As the kingdom of Neoptolemus was partitioned, this led to Helenus acquiring the rule of Buthrotum, as king. &quot;Helenus, a son of Priam, was king over these Greek cities of Epirus, having succeeded to the throne and bed of Neoptolemus.&quot;

Andromache bore him a son, Cestrinus, who is identified with Genger or Zenter, a legendary Trojan king and father of Francus. Some mythographers alleged that Helenus was given the hand of both Deidamia and Andromache in marriage, which helped consolidate his claims to Neoptolemus&#x27; kingdom. Helenus prophesied Aeneas&#x27; founding of Rome when he and his followers stopped at Buthrotum, detailed by Virgil in &quot;Aeneid&quot; Book III.

=== Other myths ===
In one account, Helenus got his mother Hecuba after the Trojan War and they crossed over to the Chersonese where the queen was turned into a bitch. Helenus then buried her at the place now called the Bitch&#x27;s Tomb.

In one version of the myth, Agamemnon summoned all of the traitors who helped betray Troy and honored their promises to them after the sack of the Troy. Two of which were Helenus and Cassandra who had always pled with Priam for peace, and how Helenus had successfully urged the return of Achilles’ body for burial. Accordingly, Agamemnon, following the advice of the council, gave Helenus and Cassandra their freedom. Then Helenus, remembering how Hecuba and Andromache had always loved him, interceded with Agamemnon in their behalf. The latter by advice of the council gave these their freedom. It is said that these four migrated to the Thracian Chersonese where they settled with twelve hundred followers.

In Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; () Helenus was captured by Neoptolemus along with many other Trojans, and taken in chains to Greece as revenge for the death of Achilles in the Trojan War. Under Neoptolemus&#x27; orders, they and their descendants remained in slavery until the time of King Pandrasus several generations later, when they were liberated by Brutus of Troy.

<text>In Greek mythology, Dymas (Ancient Greek: Δύμας) is the name attributed to the following individuals:
* Dymas, a Mariandynian who warned the Argonauts about the cruelty of Amycus, king of the Bebrycians. Both Mariandynians and Bebrycians lived in northwestern Asia Minor.
* Dymas, a soldier who fought on the side of the Seven against Thebes. He took part in the foot-race at Opheltes&#x27; funeral games in Nemea. Dymas was wounded in battle and killed himself when the enemy started questioning him.
* Dymas, a Dorian and the ancestor of the Dymanes. His father, Aegimius, adopted Heracles&#x27; son, Hyllas. Dymas and his brother, Pamphylus, submitted to Hyllas.
* Dymas, king of Phrygia and father of Hecuba.
* Dymas, perhaps the same as the first. According to Quintus Smyrnaeus this Dymas was the father of Meges, a Trojan whose sons fought at Troy.
* Dymas, an Aulian warrior who came to fight at Troy under the leadership of Archesilaus. He died at the hands of Aeneas.
* Dymas, a Trojan soldier who fought with Aeneas and was killed at Troy.
* Dymas, was mentioned in Homer&#x27;s Odyssey as a Phaeacian captain, whose daughter was a friend to the princess Nausicaa.

<text>Oral tradition, or oral lore, is a form of human communication in which knowledge, art, ideas and culture are received, preserved, and transmitted orally from one generation to another. The transmission is through speech or song and may include folktales, ballads, chants, prose or poetry. The information is mentally recorded by oral repositories, sometimes termed &quot;walking libraries&quot;, who are usually also performers. Oral tradition is a medium of communication for a society to transmit oral history, oral literature, oral law and other knowledge across generations without a writing system, or in parallel to a writing system. It is the most widespread medium of human communication. They often remain in use in the modern era throughout for cultural preservation. 

Religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Catholicism, and Jainism have used oral tradition, in parallel to writing, to transmit their canonical scriptures, rituals, hymns and mythologies. African societies have broadly been labelled &quot;oral civilisations&quot;, contrasted with &quot;literate civilisations&quot;, due to their reverence for the oral word and widespread use of oral tradition.

Oral tradition is memories, knowledge, and expression held in common by a group over many generations: it is the long preservation of immediate or contemporaneous testimony. It may be defined as the recall and transmission of specific, preserved textual and cultural knowledge through vocal utterance. Oral tradition is usually popular, and can be exoteric or . It speaks to people according to their understanding, unveiling itself in accordance with their aptitudes. 

As an academic discipline, oral tradition refers both to objects and methods of study. It is distinct from oral history, which is the recording of personal testimony of those who experienced historical eras or events. Oral tradition is also distinct from the study of orality, defined as thought and its verbal expression in societies where the technologies of literacy (writing and print) are unfamiliar. Folklore is one albeit not the only type of oral tradition.

==History==
According to John Foley, oral tradition has been an ancient human tradition found in &quot;all corners of the world&quot;. Modern archaeology has been unveiling evidence of the human efforts to preserve and transmit arts and knowledge that depended completely or partially on an oral tradition, across various cultures:
Before the introduction of text, oral tradition remained the only means of communication in order to establish societies as well as its institutions. Despite widespread comprehension of literacy in the recent century, oral tradition remains the dominant communicative means within the world.

=== Africa ===

All indigenous African societies use oral tradition to learn their origin and history, civic and religious duties, crafts and skills, as well as traditional myths and legends. It is also a key socio-cultural component in the practice of their traditional spiritualities, as well as mainstream Abrahamic religions. The prioritisation of the spoken word is evidenced by African societies having chosen to record history orally whilst some had developed or had access to a writing script. Jan Vansina differentiates between &quot;oral&quot; and &quot;literate&quot; civilisations, stating: &quot;The attitude of members of an oral society toward speech is similar to the reverence members of a literate society attach to the written word. If it is hallowed by authority or antiquity, the word will be treasured.&quot; For centuries in Europe, all data felt to be important were written down, with the most important texts prioritised, such as Bible, and only trivia, such as song, legend, anecdote, and proverbs remained unrecorded. In Africa, all the principal political, legal, social, and religious texts were transmitted orally. When the Bamums in Cameroon invented a script, the first to be written down was the royal chronicle and the code of customary law. Most African courts had archivists who learnt by heart the royal genealogy and history of the state, and served as its unwritten constitution.

The performance of a tradition is accentuated and rendered alive by various gesture, social conventions and the unique occasion in which it is performed. Furthermore, the climate in which traditions are told influences its content. In Burundi, traditions were short because most of them were told at informal gatherings and everyone had to have his say during the evening; in neighbouring Rwanda, many narratives were spun-out because a one-man professional had to entertain his patron for a whole evening, with every production checked by fellow specialists and errors punishable. Frequently, glosses or commentaries were presented parallel to the narrative, sometimes answering questions from the audience to ensure understanding, although often someone would learn a tradition without asking their master questions and not really understand the meaning of its content, leading them to speculate in the commentary. Oral traditions only exist when they are told, except for in people&#x27;s minds, and so the frequency of telling a tradition aids its preservation. These African ethnic groups also utilize oral tradition to develop and train the human intellect, and the memory to retain information and sharpen imagination.
====West Africa====
Perhaps the most famous repository of oral tradition is the west African griot (named differently in different languages). The griot is a hereditary position and exists in Dyula, Soninke, Fula, Hausa, Songhai, Wolof, Serer, and Mossi societies among many others, although more famously in Mandinka society. They constitute a caste and perform a range of roles, including as a historian or library, musician, poet, mediator of family and tribal disputes, spokesperson, and served in the king&#x27;s court, not dissimilar from the European bard. They keep records of all births, death, and marriages through the generations of the village or family. When Sundiata Keita founded the Mali Empire, he was offered Balla Fasséké as his griot to advise him during his reign, giving rise to the Kouyate line of griots. Griots often accompany their telling of oral tradition with a musical instrument, as the &quot;Epic of Sundiata&quot; is accompanied by the balafon, or as the kora accompanies other traditions. In modern times, some griots and descendants of griots have dropped their historian role and focus on music, with many finding success, however many still maintain their traditional roles.

====East Africa====
Kenya safeguarded its oral tradition by ratifying the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in October 2007.

====North Africa====
====Central Africa====
====Southern Africa====
===Europe===
====Albania====
Albanian traditions have been handed down orally across generations. They have been preserved through traditional memory systems that have survived intact into modern times in Albania, a phenomenon that is explained by the lack of state formation among Albanians and their ancestors – the Illyrians, being able to preserve their &quot;tribally&quot; organized society. This distinguished them from civilizations such as Ancient Egypt, Minoans and Mycenaeans, who underwent state formation and disrupted their traditional memory practices.

Albanian epic poetry has been analysed by Homeric scholars to acquire a better understanding of Homeric epics. The long oral tradition that has sustained Albanian epic poetry reinforces the idea that pre-Homeric epic poetry was oral. The theory of oral-formulaic composition was developed also through the scholarly study of Albanian epic verse. The Albanian traditional singing of epic verse from memory is one of the last survivors of its kind in modern Europe, and the last survivor of the Balkan traditions.

==== Ancient Greece ====

&quot;All ancient Greek literature&quot;, states Steve Reece, &quot;was to some degree oral in nature, and the earliest literature was completely so&quot;. Homer&#x27;s epic poetry, states Michael Gagarin, &quot;was largely composed, performed and transmitted orally&quot;. As folklores and legends were performed in front of distant audiences, the singers would substitute the names in the stories with local characters or rulers to give the stories a local flavor and thus connect with the audience, but making the historicity embedded in the oral tradition unreliable. The lack of surviving texts about the Greek and Roman religious traditions have led scholars to presume that these were ritualistic and transmitted as oral traditions, but some scholars disagree that the complex rituals in the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations were an exclusive product of an oral tradition.

==== Ireland ====
An Irish &quot;seanchaí&quot; (plural: &quot;seanchaithe&quot;), meaning bearer of &quot;old lore&quot;&quot;,&quot; was a traditional Irish language storyteller (the Scottish Gaelic equivalent being the &quot;seanchaidh,&quot; anglicised as shanachie). The job of a &quot;seanchaí&quot; was to serve the head of a lineage by passing information orally from one generation to the next about Irish folklore and history, particularly in medieval times.

==== Rome ====
The potential for oral transmission of history in ancient Rome is evidenced primarily by Cicero, who discusses the significance of oral tradition in works such as &quot;Brutus&quot;, &quot;Tusculan Disputations&quot;, and &quot;On The Orator&quot;. While Cicero’s reliance on Cato’s Origines may limit the breadth of his argument, he nonetheless highlights the importance of storytelling in preserving Roman history. Valerius Maximus also references oral tradition in Memorable Doings and Sayings (2.1.10).

Wiseman argues that celebratory performances served as a vital medium for transmitting Roman history and that such traditions evolved into written forms by the third century CE. He asserts that the history of figures like the house of Tarquin was likely passed down through oral storytelling for centuries before being recorded in literature. Although Flower critiques the lack of ancient evidence supporting Wiseman&#x27;s broader claims, Wiseman maintains that dramatic narratives fundamentally shaped historiography.

=== Asia ===
In Asia, the transmission of folklore, mythologies as well as scriptures in ancient India, in different Indian religions, was by oral tradition, preserved with precision with the help of elaborate mnemonic techniques:

According to Goody, the Vedic texts likely involved both a written and oral tradition, calling it a &quot;parallel products of a literate society&quot;. Mostly recently, research shows that oral performance of (written) texts could be a philosophical activity in early China.

It is a common knowledge in India that the primary Hindu books called Vedas are great example of Oral tradition. Pundits who memorized three Vedas were called Trivedis. Pundits who memorized four vedas were called Chaturvedis. By transferring knowledge from generation to generation Hindus protected their ancient Mantras in Vedas, which are basically Prose.

The early Buddhist texts are also generally believed to be of oral tradition, with the first by comparing inconsistencies in the transmitted versions of literature from various oral societies such as the Greek, Serbia and other cultures, then noting that the Vedic literature is too consistent and vast to have been composed and transmitted orally across generations, without being written down.

====Middle East====

In the Middle East, Arabic oral tradition has significantly influenced literary and cultural practices. Arabic oral tradition encompassed various forms of expression, including metrical poetry, unrhymed prose, rhymed prose (&quot;saj&#x27;&quot;), and prosimetrum—a combination of prose and poetry often employed in historical narratives. Poetry held a position of particular importance, as it was believed to be a more reliable medium for information transmission than prose. This belief stemmed from observations that highly structured language, with its rhythmic and phonetic patterns, tended to undergo fewer alterations during oral transmission.

Each genre of rhymed poetry served distinct social and cultural functions. These range from spontaneous compositions at celebrations to carefully crafted historical accounts, political commentaries, and entertainment pieces. Among these, the folk epics known as siyar (singular: sīra) were considered the most intricate. These prosimetric narratives, combining prose and verse, emerged in the early Middle Ages. While many such epics circulated historically, only one has survived as a sung oral poetic tradition: Sīrat Banī Hilāl. This epic recounts the westward migration and conquests of the Banu Hilal Bedouin tribe from the 10th to 12th centuries, culminating in their rule over parts of North Africa before their eventual defeat. The historical roots of Sīrat Banī Hilāl are evident in the present-day distribution of groups claiming descent from the tribe across North Africa and parts of the Middle East. The epic&#x27;s development into a cohesive narrative was first documented by the historian Ibn Khaldūn in the 14th century. In his writings, Ibn Khaldūn describes collecting stories and poems from nomadic Arabs, using these oral sources to discuss the merits of colloquial versus classical poetry and the value of oral histories in written historical works.

The Torah and other ancient Jewish literature, the Judeo-Christian Bible and texts of early centuries of Christianity are rooted in an oral tradition, and the term &quot;People of the Book&quot; is a medieval construct. This is evidenced, for example, by the multiple scriptural statements by Paul admitting &quot;previously remembered tradition which he received&quot; orally.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
Australian Aboriginal culture has thrived on oral traditions and oral histories passed down through thousands of years.
In a study published in February 2020, new evidence showed that both Budj Bim and Tower Hill volcanoes erupted between 34,000 and 40,000 years ago. Significantly, this is a &quot;minimum age constraint for human presence in Victoria&quot;, and also could be interpreted as evidence for the oral histories of the Gunditjmara people, an Aboriginal Australian people of south-western Victoria, which tell of volcanic eruptions being some of the oldest oral traditions in existence. A basalt stone axe found underneath volcanic ash in 1947 had already proven that humans inhabited the region before the eruption of Tower Hill.

=== Americas ===
==== Native American ====
Native American society was always reliant upon oral tradition, if not storytelling, in order to convey knowledge, morals and traditions amongst others, a trait Western settlers deemed as representing an inferior race without neither culture nor history, often cited as a reason behind indoctrination.

Writing systems are not known to exist among Native North Americans before contact with Europeans except among some Mesoamerican cultures, and possibly the South American quipu and North American wampum, although those two are debatable. Oral storytelling traditions flourished in a context without the use of writing to record and preserve history, scientific knowledge, and social practices. While some stories were told for amusement and leisure, most functioned as practical lessons from tribal experience applied to immediate moral, social, psychological, and environmental issues. Stories fuse fictional, supernatural, or otherwise exaggerated characters and circumstances with real emotions and morals as a means of teaching. Plots often reflect real life situations and may be aimed at particular people known by the story&#x27;s audience. In this way, social pressure could be exerted without directly causing embarrassment or social exclusion. For example, rather than yelling, Inuit parents might deter their children from wandering too close to the water&#x27;s edge by telling a story about a sea monster with a pouch for children within its reach. One single story could provide dozens of lessons. Stories were also used as a means to assess whether traditional cultural ideas and practices are effective in tackling contemporary circumstances or if they should be revised.

Native American storytelling is a collaborative experience between storyteller and listeners. Native American tribes generally have not had professional tribal storytellers marked by social status. Stories could and can be told by anyone, with each storyteller using their own vocal inflections, word choice, content, or form. Storytellers not only draw upon their own memories, but also upon a collective or tribal memory extending beyond personal experience but nevertheless representing a shared reality. Native languages have in some cases up to twenty words to describe physical features like rain or snow and can describe the spectra of human emotion in very precise ways, allowing storytellers to offer their own personalized take on a story based on their own lived experiences. Fluidity in story deliverance allowed stories to be applied to different social circumstances according to the storyteller&#x27;s objective at the time. One&#x27;s rendition of a story was often considered a response to another&#x27;s rendition, with plot alterations suggesting alternative ways of applying traditional ideas to present conditions.

Listeners might have heard the story told many times, or even may have told the same story themselves. This does not take away from a story&#x27;s meaning, as curiosity about what happens next was less of a priority than hearing fresh perspectives on well-known themes and plots. Elder storytellers generally were not concerned with discrepancies between their version of historical events and neighboring tribes&#x27; version of similar events, such as in origin stories. Tribal stories are considered valid within the tribe&#x27;s own frame of reference and tribal experience. The 19th century Oglala Lakota tribal member Four Guns was known for his justification of the oral tradition and criticism of the written word.

Stories are used to preserve and transmit both tribal history and environmental history, which are often closely linked. Native oral traditions in the Pacific Northwest, for example, describe natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. Various cultures from Vancouver Island and Washington have stories describing a physical struggle between a Thunderbird and a Whale. One such story tells of the Thunderbird, which can create thunder by moving just a feather, piercing the Whale&#x27;s flesh with its talons, causing the Whale to dive to the bottom of the ocean, bringing the Thunderbird with it. Another depicts the Thunderbird lifting the Whale from the Earth then dropping it back down. Regional similarities in themes and characters suggests that these stories mutually describe the lived experience of earthquakes and floods within tribal memory. According to one story from the Suquamish Tribe, Agate Pass was created when an earthquake expanded the channel as a result of an underwater battle between a serpent and bird. Other stories in the region depict the formation of glacial valleys and moraines and the occurrence of landslides, with stories being used in at least one case to identify and date earthquakes that occurred in 900 CE and 1700.

Further examples include Arikara origin stories of emergence from an &quot;underworld&quot; of persistent darkness, which may represent the remembrance of life in the Arctic Circle during the last ice age, and stories involving a &quot;deep crevice&quot;, which may refer to the Grand Canyon. Despite such examples of agreement between geological and archeological records on one hand and Native oral records on the other, some scholars have cautioned against the historical validity of oral traditions because of their susceptibility to detail alteration over time and lack of precise dates. The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act considers oral traditions as a viable source of evidence for establishing the affiliation between cultural objects and Native Nations.

==Transmission==

Oral traditions face the challenge of accurate transmission and verifiability of the accurate version, particularly when the culture lacks written language or has limited access to writing tools. Oral cultures have employed various strategies that achieve this without writing. For example, a heavily rhythmic speech filled with mnemonic devices enhances memory and recall. A few useful mnemonic devices include alliteration, repetition, assonance, and proverbial sayings. In addition, the verse is often metrically composed with an exact number of syllables or morae—such as with Greek and Latin prosody and in Chandas found in Hindu and Buddhist texts.

The verses of the epic or text are typically designed wherein the long and short syllables are repeated by certain rules, so that if an error or inadvertent change is made, an internal examination of the verse reveals the problem. Oral traditions can be passed on through plays and acting, as shown in modern-day Cameroon by the Graffis or Grasslanders who perform and deliver speeches to teach their history through oral tradition. Such strategies facilitate transmission of information without a written intermediate, and they can also be applied to oral governance.

===Oral transmission of law===


Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; provides an excellent demonstration of oral governance in the Law of the Jungle. Not only does grounding rules in oral proverbs allow for simple transmission and understanding, but it also legitimizes new rulings by allowing extrapolation. These stories, traditions, and proverbs are not static, but are often altered upon each transmission, barring any change to the overall meaning. In this way, the rules that govern the people are modified by the whole and not authored by a single entity.

===Indian religions===
Ancient texts of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism were preserved and transmitted by an oral tradition. For example, the śrutis of Hinduism called the Vedas, the oldest of which trace back to the second millennium BCE. Michael Witzel explains this oral tradition as follows:

Ancient Indians developed techniques for listening, memorization and recitation of their knowledge, in schools called Gurukul, while maintaining exceptional accuracy of their knowledge across the generations. Many forms of recitation or &quot;pathas&quot; were designed to aid accuracy in recitation and the transmission of the &quot;Vedas&quot; and other knowledge texts from one generation to the next. All hymns in each Veda were recited in this way; for example, all 1,028 hymns with 10,600 verses of the Rigveda was preserved in this way; as were all other Vedas including the Principal Upanishads, as well as the Vedangas. Each text was recited in a number of ways, to ensure that the different methods of recitation acted as a cross check on the other. Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat summarizes this as:
* &quot;Samhita-patha&quot;: continuous recitation of Sanskrit words bound by the phonetic rules of euphonic combination;
* &quot;Pada-patha&quot;: a recitation marked by a conscious pause after every word, and after any special grammatical codes embedded inside the text; this method suppresses euphonic combination and restores each word in its original intended form;
* &quot;Krama-patha&quot;: a step-by-step recitation where euphonically combined words are paired successively and sequentially and then recited; for example, a hymn &quot;word1 word2 word3 word4...&quot;, would be recited as &quot;word1word2 word2word3 word3word4 ...&quot;; this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Gargya and Sakalya in the Hindu tradition and mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini (dated to pre-Buddhism period);
* &quot;Krama-patha&quot; modified: the same step-by-step recitation as above, but without euphonic-combinations (or free form of each word); this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Babhravya and Galava in the Hindu tradition, and is also mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini;
* &#x27;, &#x27; and &quot;&quot; are methods of recitation of a text and its oral transmission that developed after 5th century BCE, that is after the start of Buddhism and Jainism; these methods use more complicated rules of combination and were less used.

These extraordinary retention techniques guaranteed an accurate Śruti, fixed across the generations, not just in terms of unaltered word order but also in terms of sound. That these methods have been effective, is testified to by the preservation of the most ancient Indian religious text, the &quot;&quot; ().

===Poetry of Homer===

Research by Milman Parry and Albert Lord indicates that the verse of the Greek poet Homer has been passed down not by rote memorization but by &quot;oral-formulaic composition&quot;. In this process, extempore composition is aided by use of stock phrases or &quot;formulas&quot; (expressions that are used regularly &quot;under the same metrical conditions, to express a particular essential idea&quot;). In the case of the work of Homer, formulas included &quot;eos rhododaktylos&quot; (&quot;rosy fingered dawn&quot;) and &quot;oinops pontos&quot; (&quot;winedark sea&quot;) which fit in a modular fashion into the poetic form (in this case six-colon Greek hexameter). Since the development of this theory, of oral-formulaic composition has been &quot;found in many different time periods and many different cultures&quot;, and according to another source (John Miles Foley) &quot;touch[ed] on&quot; over 100 &quot;ancient, medieval and modern traditions.&quot;

===Islam===
The most recent of the world&#x27;s major religions, Islam claims two major sources of divine revelation—the Quran and hadith—compiled in written form relatively shortly after being revealed:
*The Quran—meaning &quot;recitation&quot; in Arabic—is believed by Muslims to be God&#x27;s revelation to the Islamic prophet Muhammad, delivered to him from 610 CE until his death in 632 CE. It is said to have been carefully compiled and edited into a standardized written form (known as the ) about two decades after the last verse was revealed.
*Hadith—meaning &quot;narrative&quot; or &quot;report&quot; in Arabic—is the record of the words, actions, and the silent approval, of Muhammad, and was transmitted by &quot;oral preachers and storytellers&quot; for around 150–250 years. Each hadith includes the (chain of human transmitters who passed down the tradition before it was sorted according to accuracy, compiled, and committed to written form by a reputable scholar.

The oral milieu in which the sources were revealed, and their oral form in general are important. The Arab poetry that preceded the Quran and the hadith were orally transmitted. Few Arabs were literate at the time and paper was not available in the Middle East.

The written Quran is said to have been created in part through memorization by Muhammad&#x27;s companions, and the decision to create a standard written work is said to have come after the death in battle (Yamama) of a large number of Muslims who had memorized the work.

For centuries, copies of the Qurans were transcribed by hand, not printed, and their scarcity and expense made reciting the Quran from memory, not reading, the predominant mode of teaching it to others. To this day the Quran is memorized by millions and its recitation can be heard throughout the Muslim world from recordings and mosque loudspeakers (during Ramadan). Muslims state that some who teach memorization/recitation of the Quran constitute the end of an &quot;un-broken chain&quot; whose original teacher was Muhammad himself. It has been argued that &quot;the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s rhythmic style and eloquent expression make it easy to memorize,&quot; and was made so to facilitate the &quot;preservation and remembrance&quot; of the work.

Islamic doctrine holds that from the time it was revealed to the present day, the Quran has not been altered, its continuity from divine revelation to its current written form insured by the large numbers of Muhammad&#x27;s supporters who had reverently memorized the work, a careful compiling process and divine intervention. (Muslim scholars agree that although scholars have worked hard to separate the corrupt and uncorrupted hadith, this other source of revelation is not nearly so free of corruption because of the hadith&#x27;s great political and theological influence.)

At least two non-Muslim scholars (Alan Dundes and Andrew G. Bannister) have examined the possibility that the Quran was not just &quot;recited orally, but actually composed orally&quot;. Bannister postulates that some parts of the Quran—such as the seven re-tellings of the story of the Iblis and Adam, and the repeated phrases &quot;which of the favours of your Lord will you deny?&quot; in sura 55—make more sense addressed to listeners than readers.

Banister, Dundes and other scholars (Shabbir Akhtar, Angelika Neuwirth, Islam Dayeh) have also noted the large amount of &quot;formulaic&quot; phraseology in the Quran consistent with &quot;oral-formulaic composition&quot; mentioned above. The most common formulas are the attributes of Allah—all-mighty, all-wise, all-knowing, all-high, etc.—often found as doublets at the end of a verse. Among the other repeated phrases are &quot;Allah created the heavens and the earth&quot; (found 19 times in the Quran).

As much as one third of the Quran is made up of &quot;oral formulas&quot;, according to Dundes&#x27; estimates. Bannister, using a computer database of (the original Arabic) words of the Quran and of their &quot;grammatical role, root, number, person, gender and so forth&quot;, estimates that depending on the length of the phrase searched, somewhere between 52% (three word phrases) and 23% (five word phrases) are oral formulas. Dundes reckons his estimates confirm &quot;that the Quran was orally transmitted from its very beginnings&quot;. Bannister believes his estimates &quot;provide strong corroborative evidence that oral composition should be seriously considered as we reflect upon how the Qur&#x27;anic text was generated.&quot;

Dundes argues oral-formulaic composition is consistent with &quot;the cultural context of Arabic oral tradition&quot;, quoting researchers who have found poetry reciters in the Najd (the region next to where the Quran was revealed) using &quot;a common store of themes, motives, stock images, phraseology and prosodical options&quot;, and &quot;a discursive and loosely structured&quot; style &quot;with no fixed beginning or end&quot; and &quot;no established sequence in which the episodes must follow&quot;.{{ref|group=Note|Scholar Saad Sowayan referring to the genre of &quot;Saudi Arabian historical oral narrative genre called {{transliteration|ar|suwalif}}&quot;.

=== Catholicism ===
The Catholic Church upholds that its teaching contained in its deposit of faith is transmitted not only through scripture, but as well as through sacred tradition. The Second Vatican Council affirmed in {{lang|la|Dei verbum}} that the teachings of Jesus Christ were initially passed on to early Christians by &quot;the Apostles who, by their oral preaching, by example, and by observance handed on what they had received from the lips of Christ, from living with Him, and from what He did&quot;. The Catholic Church asserts that this mode of transmission of the faith persists through current-day bishops, who by right of apostolic succession, have continued the oral passing of what had been revealed through Christ through their preaching as teachers.

===Historiography===
{{expand section|date=May 2024}}
Oral traditions have been utilised in many historical fields, however are most associated with pre-colonial African history. Historians generally view oral traditions as neither entirely symbolic or wholly true, but a synthesis of the two, requiring great skill and subtlety to separate them.{{Rp|page=11}} 

Jan Vansina, who specialised in the history of Central Africa, pioneered the study of oral tradition in his book &quot;Oral tradition as history&quot; (1985). Vansina differentiates between &quot;oral&quot; and &quot;literate&quot; civilisations, depending on whether emphasis is placed on the sanctity of the written or oral word in a society. The Akan proverbs translated as &quot;Ancient things in the ear&quot; and &quot;Ancient things are today&quot; refer to present-day delivery and the past content, and as such oral traditions are both simultaneously expressions of the past and the present. Vansina says that to ignore the duality either way would be reductionistic. Vansina states: 
{{blockquote|Members of literate societies find it difficult to shed the prejudice and contempt for the spoken word, the counterpart of pride in writing and respect for the written word. Any historian who deals with oral tradition will have to unlearn this prejudice in order to rediscover the full wonder of words: the shades of meaning they convey to those who ponder them and learn them with care so that they may transmit the wisdom they contain as the culture&#x27;s most precious legacy to the next generation.{{rp|page=442}}}}

===Development within Europe===

In the work of the Serb scholar Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787–1864), a contemporary and friend of the Brothers Grimm. Vuk pursued similar projects of &quot;salvage folklore&quot; (similar to rescue archaeology) in the cognate traditions of the South Slavic regions which would later be gathered into Yugoslavia, and with the same admixture of romantic and nationalistic interests (he considered all those speaking the Eastern Herzegovinian dialect as Serbs). Somewhat later, but as part of the same scholarly enterprise of nationalist studies in folklore, the turcologist Vasily Radlov (1837–1918) would study the songs of the Kara-Kirghiz in what would later become the Soviet Union; Karadzic and Radloff would provide models for the work of Parry.

====Walter Ong====
In a separate development, the media theorist Marshall McLuhan (1911–1980) would begin to focus attention on the ways that communicative media shape the nature of the content conveyed. He would serve as mentor to the Jesuit Walter Ong (1912–2003), whose interests in cultural history, psychology and rhetoric would result in &quot;Orality and Literacy&quot; (Methuen, 1980) and the important but less-known &quot;Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality and Consciousness&quot; (Cornell, 1981). These two works articulated the contrasts between cultures defined by primary orality, writing, print, and the secondary orality of the electronic age.

Ong&#x27;s works also made possible an integrated theory of oral tradition which accounted for both production of content (the chief concern of Parry-Lord theory) and its reception. This approach, like McLuhan&#x27;s, kept the field open not just to the study of aesthetic culture but to the way physical and behavioral artifacts of oral societies are used to store, manage and transmit knowledge, so that oral tradition provides methods for investigation of cultural differences, other than the purely verbal, between oral and literate societies.

The most-often studied section of &quot;Orality and Literacy&quot; concerns the &quot;psychodynamics of orality&quot; This chapter seeks to define the fundamental characteristics of &#x27;primary&#x27; orality and summarizes a series of descriptors (including but not limited to verbal aspects of culture) which might be used to index the relative orality or literacy of a given text or society.

====John Miles Foley====
In advance of Ong&#x27;s synthesis, John Miles Foley began a series of papers based on his own fieldwork on South Slavic oral genres, emphasizing the dynamics of performers and audiences. Foley effectively consolidated oral tradition as an academic field when he compiled &quot;Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research&quot; in 1985. The bibliography gives a summary of the progress scholars made in evaluating the oral tradition up to that point, and includes a list of all relevant scholarly articles relating to the theory of Oral-Formulaic Composition. He also both established both the journal &quot;Oral Tradition&quot; and founded the &quot;Center for Studies in Oral Tradition&quot; (1986) at the University of Missouri. Foley developed Oral Theory beyond the somewhat mechanistic notions presented in earlier versions of Oral-Formulaic Theory, by extending Ong&#x27;s interest in cultural features of oral societies beyond the verbal, by drawing attention to the agency of the bard and by describing how oral traditions bear meaning.

The bibliography would establish a clear underlying methodology which accounted for the findings of scholars working in the separate Linguistics fields (primarily Ancient Greek, Anglo-Saxon and Serbo-Croatian). Perhaps more importantly, it would stimulate conversation among these specialties, so that a network of independent but allied investigations and investigators could be established.

Foley&#x27;s key works include &quot;The Theory of Oral Composition&quot; (1988); &quot;Immanent Art&quot; (1991); &quot;Traditional Oral Epic: The Odyssey, Beowulf and the Serbo-Croatian Return-Song&quot; (1993); &quot;The Singer of Tales in Performance&quot; (1995); &quot;Teaching Oral Traditions&quot; (1998); &quot;How to Read an Oral Poem&quot; (2002). His Pathways Project (2005–2012) draws parallels between the media dynamics of oral traditions and the Internet.

===Acceptance and further elaboration===
The theory of oral tradition would undergo elaboration and development as it grew in acceptance. While the number of formulas documented for various traditions proliferated, the concept of the formula remained lexically bound. However, numerous innovations appeared, such as the &quot;formulaic system&quot;{{#tag:ref|Donald K. Fry responds to what was known, pejoratively, in Greek studies as the &quot;hard Parryist&quot; position, in which the formula was defined in terms of verbatim lexical repetition (see Rosenmyer, Thomas G. &quot;The Formula in Early Greek Poetry&quot; &quot;Arion&quot; 4 (1965):295-311). Fry&#x27;s model proposes underlying generative templates which provide for variation and even artistic creativity within the constraints of strict metrical requirements and extempore composition-in-performance|group=Note}} with structural &quot;substitution slots&quot; for syntactic, morphological and narrative necessity (as well as for artistic invention). Sophisticated models such as Foley&#x27;s &quot;word-type placement rules&quot; followed. Higher levels of formulaic composition were defined over the years, such as &quot;ring composition&quot;, &quot;responsion&quot; and the &quot;type-scene&quot; (also called a &quot;theme&quot; or &quot;typical scene&quot;). Examples include the &quot;Beasts of Battle&quot; and the &quot;Cliffs of Death&quot;. Some of these characteristic patterns of narrative details, (like &quot;the arming sequence;&quot; &quot;the hero on the beach&quot;; &quot;the traveler recognizes his goal&quot;) would show evidence of global distribution.

At the same time, the fairly rigid division between oral and literate was replaced by recognition of transitional and compartmentalized texts and societies, including models of diglossia (Brian Stock Franz Bäuml, and Eric Havelock). Perhaps most importantly, the terms and concepts of &quot;orality&quot; and &quot;literacy&quot; came to be replaced with the more useful and apt &quot;traditionality&quot; and &quot;textuality&quot;. Very large units would be defined (The Indo-European Return Song) and areas outside of military epic would come under investigation: women&#x27;s song, riddles and other genres.

The methodology of oral tradition now conditions a large variety of studies, not only in folklore, literature and literacy, but in philosophy, communication theory, Semiotics, and including a very broad and continually expanding variety of languages and ethnic groups, and perhaps most conspicuously in biblical studies, in which Werner Kelber has been especially prominent. The annual bibliography is indexed by 100 areas, most of which are ethnolinguistic divisions.

Present developments explore the implications of the theory for rhetoric and composition, interpersonal communication, cross-cultural communication, postcolonial studies, rural community development, popular culture and film studies and many other areas. The most significant areas of theoretical development at present may be the construction of systematic hermeneutics and aesthetics specific to oral traditions.

==Criticism and debates==
The theory of oral tradition encountered early resistance from scholars who perceived it as potentially supporting either one side or another in the controversy between what were known as &quot;unitarians&quot; and &quot;analysts&quot;—that is, scholars who believed Homer to have been a single, historical figure, and those who saw him as a conceptual &quot;author function,&quot; a convenient name to assign to what was essentially a repertoire of traditional narrative. A much more general dismissal of the theory and its implications simply described it as &quot;unprovable&quot; Some scholars, mainly outside the field of oral tradition, represent (either dismissively or with approval) this body of theoretical work as reducing the great epics to children&#x27;s party games like &quot;telephone&quot; or &quot;Chinese whispers&quot;. While games provide amusement by showing how messages distort content via uncontextualized transmission, Parry&#x27;s supporters argue that the theory of oral tradition reveals how oral methods optimized the signal-to-noise ratio and thus improved the quality, stability and integrity of content transmission.

There were disputes concerning particular findings of the theory. For example, those trying to support or refute Crowne&#x27;s hypothesis found the &quot;Hero on the Beach&quot; formula in numerous Old English poems. Similarly, it was also discovered in other works of Germanic origin, Middle English poetry, and even an Icelandic prose saga. J.A. Dane, in an article characterized as &quot;polemics without rigor&quot; claimed that the appearance of the theme in Ancient Greek poetry, a tradition without known connection to the Germanic, invalidated the notion of &quot;an autonomous theme in the baggage of an oral poet.&quot;

Within Homeric studies specifically, Lord&#x27;s &quot;The Singer of Tales&quot;, which focused on problems and questions that arise in conjunction with applying oral-formulaic theory to problematic texts such as the &quot;Iliad&quot;, &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and even &quot;Beowulf&quot;, influenced nearly all of the articles written on Homer and oral-formulaic composition thereafter. However, in response to Lord, Geoffrey Kirk published &quot;The Songs of Homer&quot;, questioning Lord&#x27;s extension of the oral-formulaic nature of Serbian and Croatian literature (the area from which the theory was first developed) to Homeric epic. Kirk argues that Homeric poems differ from those traditions in their &quot;metrical strictness&quot;, &quot;formular system[s]&quot;, and creativity. In other words, Kirk argued that Homeric poems were recited under a system that gave the reciter much more freedom to choose words and passages to get to the same end than the Serbo-Croatian poet, who was merely &quot;reproductive&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Eric Havelock&#x27;s &quot;Preface to Plato&quot; revolutionized how scholars looked at Homeric epic by arguing not only that it was the product of an oral tradition, but also that the oral-formulas contained therein served as a way for ancient Greeks to preserve cultural knowledge across many different generations. Adam Parry, in his 1966 work &quot;Have we Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;?&quot;, theorized the existence of the most fully developed oral poet to his time, a person who could (at his discretion) creatively and intellectually create nuanced characters in the context of the accepted, traditional story. In fact, he discounted the Serbo-Croatian tradition to an &quot;unfortunate&quot; extent, choosing to elevate the Greek model of oral-tradition above all others. Lord reacted to Kirk&#x27;s and Parry&#x27;s essays with &quot;Homer as Oral Poet&quot;, published in 1968, which reaffirmed Lord&#x27;s belief in the relevance of Yugoslav poetry and its similarities to Homer and downplayed the intellectual and literary role of the reciters of Homeric epic.

Many of the criticisms of the theory have been absorbed into the evolving field as useful refinements and modifications. For example, in what Foley called a &quot;pivotal&quot; contribution, Larry Benson introduced the concept of &quot;written-formulaic&quot; to describe the status of some Anglo-Saxon poetry which, while demonstrably written, contains evidence of oral influences, including heavy reliance on formulas and themes A number of individual scholars in many areas continue to have misgivings about the applicability of the theory or the aptness of the South Slavic comparison, and particularly what they regard as its implications for the creativity which may legitimately be attributed to the individual artist. However, at present, there seems to be little systematic or theoretically coordinated challenge to the fundamental tenets of the theory; as Foley put it, &quot;&quot;there have been numerous suggestions for revisions or modifications of the theory, but the majority of controversies have generated further understanding.
