<text>The Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) is a collegiate athletic conference headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, which is made up of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the Southern United States. It participates in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I for most sports; in football, it participates in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), formerly referred to as Division I-AA.

The SWAC is considered the premier HBCU conference and ranks among the elite in the nation in terms of alumni affiliated with professional sports teams, particularly in football. On the gridiron, the conference has been the biggest draw on the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) level of the NCAA, leading the nation in average home attendance every year except one since FCS has been in existence. In 1994, the SWAC fell just 40,000 fans short of becoming the first non-Football Bowl Subdivision conference to attract one million fans to its home games.

==History==
In 1920, athletic officials from six Texas HBCUs — C. H. Fuller of Bishop College, Red Randolph and C. H. Patterson of Paul Quinn College, E. G. Evans, H. J. Evans and H. J. Starns of Prairie View A&amp;M, D. C. Fuller of Texas College and G. Whitte Jordan of Wiley University — met in Houston to discuss common interests. At this meeting, they agreed to form a new league, the SWAC.

Paul Quinn became the first of the original members to withdraw from the league in 1929. When Langston University of Oklahoma was admitted into the conference two years later, it began the migration of state-supported institutions into the SWAC. Southern University entered the ranks in 1934, followed by Arkansas AM&amp;N (now the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff) in 1936 and Texas Southern University in 1954.

Rapid growth in enrollment of the state-supported schools made it difficult for the church-supported schools to finance their athletics programs and one by one they fell victim to the growing prowess of the state-supported colleges. Huston–Tillotson (formerly Samuel Huston) withdrew from the conference in 1954, Bishop in 1956, and Langston in 1957—one year before the admittance of two more state-supported schools: Grambling College and Jackson State College. The enter-exit cycle continued in 1962 when Texas College withdrew, followed by the admittance of Alcorn A&amp;M (now Alcorn State University) that same year. Wiley left in 1968, the same year Mississippi Valley State College entered. Arkansas AM&amp;N exited in 1970 and Alabama State University entered in 1982. Arkansas–Pine Bluff (formerly Arkansas AM&amp;N) rejoined the SWAC on July 1, 1997, regaining full-member status one year later. Alabama A&amp;M University became the conference&#x27;s tenth member when it became a full member in September 1999 after a one-year period as an affiliate SWAC member. Most of the former SWAC members that have left the conference are currently a part of the Red River Athletic Conference of the NAIA.

On 3 September 2020, the SWAC had announced that there would be a division realignment with the additions of Florida A&amp;M University and Bethune-Cookman University beginning with the 2021–22 academic year; which both would compete in the SWAC East, while Alcorn State would be moving to the SWAC West.

==Competitions==
The SWAC is one of three FCS conferences – the others being the Ivy League and the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference – whose conference champion does not participate in the FCS playoffs, opting instead to play in the Celebration Bowl against the champion of the MEAC. However, SWAC teams can still be invited via an at-large invitation, as was the case in 2021 when SWAC member Florida A&amp;M University was invited over SWAC conference football champion Jackson State, who was obligated via contract to play in the 2021 Celebration Bowl. The SWAC instead splits its schools into two divisions, and plays a conference championship game. Three of the SWAC&#x27;s teams, Alabama State in the Turkey Day Classic and Grambling and Southern in the Bayou Classic, play their last games of the regular season on Thanksgiving weekend, preventing the SWAC Championship from being decided until the first weekend of December, long after the tournament is underway.

Current championship competition offered by the SWAC includes competition for men in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, indoor track, outdoor track &amp; field and tennis. Women&#x27;s competition is offered in the sports of basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, indoor track, outdoor track &amp; field, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball.

==SWAC championships==
===Football===
Prior to splitting into divisions and using a postseason championship game to decide its overall champion, the SWAC determined its champions by winning-percentage against conference opponents in regular season play.

In 1933 Langston appeared to win the title outright with a 4–0 conference record after the regular season, while Wiley finished 4–1, and Prairie View A&amp;M finished 3–1. Langston was invited to the Prairie View Bowl, which was won by Prairie View. The Panthers subsequently declared themselves SWAC champions even though their claim was based on a postseason game. The SWAC seems to acknowledge both schools&#x27; claims to the title in the conference&#x27;s football media guide, although some other sources including Michael Hurd&#x27;s &quot;Black College Football, 1892–1992: One Hundred Years of History, Education, and Pride&quot; (1993) also list Wiley as an additional co-champion, apparently since all three schools had 4–1 records against conference opponents if the postseason game is incorporated into the regular season conference standings.

Prairie View vacated its 1941 championship. No championship was awarded in 1943 due to World War II. Grambling vacated its 1975 championship due to a violation of SWAC rules for scheduling opponents.
Games from 1999 to 2012 were played at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. The conference moved the game in 2013 to NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas. Starting in 2019, the game will officially be played at the first place team&#x27;s home. Since 2015, the winner of the SWAC plays the winner of the MEAC conference in an overall HBCU championship bowl game called the Celebration Bowl in Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The MEAC gave up its automatic bid to the FCS Playoffs for this game.

Texas Southern vacated its 2010 championship due to violations of NCAA rules.

The 2020–21 football season was played during Spring 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since splitting into western and eastern divisions and using a postseason championship game to decide its overall champion, the SWAC determines its division champions by winning-percentage against conference opponents in regular season play. For the 1999 season only, inter-divisional conference games did not count in the conference standings. Each division&#x27;s outright champion or top-seeded co-champion advances to the championship game.

Texas Southern vacated its 2010 division championship due to violations of NCAA rules.
Note: an asterisk denotes the division&#x27;s top-seeded co-champion and representative in the SWAC Championship Game; a double-asterisk denotes that the division&#x27;s co-champion was ineligible for the SWAC Championship Game due to a violation of SWAC rules that were in effect from 2011 to 2014 concerning Academic Progress Rate (APR) scores.

Starting with the 2021 season with the additions of both Bethune-Cookman and Florida A&amp;M, the football schedule is as follows:

* Each school plays eight conference games (five divisional, three non-divisional) and rotates three teams from the opposite division every two years.
* The best team in the SWAC gets to host the SWAC championship game. 
* The SWAC champion advances to the Celebration Bowl versus the MEAC champion. The loser ends its season.

===Celebration Bowl results===
===Men&#x27;s basketball===

The 1977–78 season was the SWAC&#x27;s first as an NCAA Division I basketball conference.

The semi-final and championship SWAC Basketball Tournament games are held at the Bill Harris Arena in Birmingham, Alabama. As of the 2017 tournaments, they feature an eight-team three-day layout with the quarterfinal rounds hosted on campus sites. This changes the previous 10-team, five-day tournament format. The higher seeded teams will host a combined eight games leaving two days for travel and practice rounds. The tournament concludes with the semi-finals and championship rounds inside Birmingham&#x27;s Bill Harris Arena. Winners of the tournaments earn automatic bids to their respective NCAA Division I Tournaments. The championship games are nationally televised live annually on an ESPN network.

In recent decades, the conference tournament has determined the overall champions; for specifics concerning the tournament in particular, see the Southwestern Athletic Conference baseball tournament.

==SWAC marching bands==

Marching bands have a rich tradition being a centerpiece of school spirit and pride for each institution in the conference. Furthermore, the competitiveness, prestige, pageantry, and showmanship of SWAC marching bands significantly add to the unique identity and culture of the conference.

<text>In ancient Greek religion Artemis Caryatis (Καρυᾶτις) was an epithet of Artemis that was derived from the small &quot;polis&quot; of Caryae in Laconia; there an archaic open-air &quot;temenos&quot; was dedicated to Carya, the &quot;Lady of the Nut-Tree&quot;, whose priestesses were called the &quot;caryatides&quot;, represented on the Athenian Acropolis as the marble caryatids supporting the porch of the Erechtheum. The late accounts made of the eponymous Carya a virgin who had been transformed into a nut-tree, whether for her unchastity (with Dionysus) or to prevent her rape. The particular form of veneration of Artemis at Karyai suggests that in pre-classical ritual Carya was goddess of the nut tree who was later assimilated into the Olympian goddess Artemis. Pausanias noted that each year women performed a dance called the &quot;caryatis&quot; at a festival in honor of Artemis Caryatis called the &quot;Caryateia&quot;.

<text>The Pioneer Football League (PFL) is a collegiate athletic conference which operates in the United States. The conference participates in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) as a football-only conference. It has member schools that range from New York, North Carolina, and Florida in the east to California in the west. It is headquartered in St. Louis, in the same complex that also contains the offices of the Missouri Valley Conference and Missouri Valley Football Conference. Unlike most other Division I FCS conferences, the Pioneer League consists of institutions that choose not to award athletic scholarships (&quot;grants-in-aid&quot;) to football players.

Most of the PFL&#x27;s members are private schools. Morehead State University is the only public school in the conference.

Following an NCAA rule change passed in January 1991, which required Division I schools to conduct all sports at the Division I level by 1993, the conference was formed by charter members Butler University, the University of Dayton, Drake University, the University of Evansville, and Valparaiso University. The University of San Diego joined in 1992, and the league played its first season in 1993. The six original schools which played in the 1993 season had previously sponsored football at the Division I, Division II and Division III levels.

===Membership changes===
Original contraction

In 1997, the league was reduced to five members when the University of Evansville downgraded football from Division I to club status.

2001 expansion

In 2001, the conference nearly doubled in size and was reorganized with the five pre-2001 members forming the North Division, and newcomers Austin Peay State University, Davidson College, Jacksonville University and Morehead State University forming the South Division. The reorganization spawned a new championship system in which the best record holders from each division would play in a title game for the conference championship.

2005–2008 membership changes

On April 8, 2005, Austin Peay announced its departure from the league effective after the 2005 season; Austin Peay returned to scholarship-granting competition in 2007 as a member of the Ohio Valley Conference in which it competes in other sports. As a result, the conference reverted to round-robin play; the divisions and championship game were abolished. On April 7, 2006, Campbell University announced the reinstatement of football effective in 2008, and on December 5, 2007, accepted an invitation to the PFL. In February 2008, Marist College announced that it would join the PFL for the 2009 season, after the MAAC stopped sponsoring football. Although Campbell moved in 2011 from the Atlantic Sun Conference to the Big South Conference, which sponsors football, it did not join the Big South in football and remained in the PFL through the 2017 season.

2013 membership changes &amp; automatic playoff berth

On June 13, 2011, Mercer University and Stetson University were announced as league members (effective 2013) bringing membership to 12 schools. In addition, as of 2013, the league has an automatic bid into the FCS division I playoffs. Soon after its PFL membership was announced, Mercer accepted an invitation to join the Southern Conference (scholarship-granting) effective July 1, 2014. During its one season in the league, Mercer set a Division I win–loss record for start-up programs; Mercer finished the 2013 season with an overall record of 10–2 including an undefeated 8–0 record at home, also a Division I record held jointly with Auburn University, which likewise went undefeated at home in 2013.

On July 1, 2014, Mercer University joined the Southern Conference for all sports, including football.

The next change in conference membership was announced on November 14, 2016, when Campbell announced it would transition to scholarship football and add that sport to its existing Big South membership effective with the 2018 season, temporarily reducing the PFL membership to 10. Barring any further changes to conference membership, the PFL would have returned to 11 members in 2021, following the November 20, 2017 announcement of Presbyterian College that it would join the conference starting with the 2021 season. Presbyterian remains in the Big South Conference for all other sports. While Presbyterian did not become a full conference member until July 2021, it began PFL play in the spring 2021 season, rescheduled from fall 2020 due to COVID-19. After two PFL members chose not to play in the 2020–21 school year, the conference entered into a scheduling agreement with Presbyterian that included it in the spring 2021 schedule. While PC was not eligible for the PFL title in that season, it was eligible for the league&#x27;s individual awards and honors.

2019: Jacksonville drops football

On December 3, 2019 Jacksonville University announced that it discontinued its football program immediately.

2021: Further expansion

Presbyterian was joined as a new PFL member in 2021 by the University of St. Thomas, a Twin Cities school that had been expelled from its longtime Division III home of the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) effective in 2021–22. Shortly after the MIAC announced St. Thomas&#x27; expulsion, the Summit League, a non-football Division I conference, offered the Tommies membership. The NCAA announced on July 15, 2020 that it had granted a waiver to allow St. Thomas to make the jump to D-I on a five-year schedule, instead of the four years used for moves from Division II. The Tommies will not be eligible for the FCS playoffs until the transition is completed in 2026.

==Rivalries==
One in-state rivalry currently exists in the PFL. A second had existed before Jacksonville discontinued its football program.

Butler and Valparaiso first met in 1927, and have played every year since 1951. Since 2006, the schools have played for the Hoosier Helmet Trophy. Butler leads the all-time series 54–30. The rivalry extended to all sports when both schools were in the Horizon League from 2007 to 2012.

Jacksonville and Stetson had a football rivalry that ran from 2013, when Stetson began PFL play, to 2019, after which Jacksonville dropped football. The schools have been conference rivals in other sports since 1998, when Jacksonville joined the ASUN Conference, home to Stetson since 1985.

Butler and Dayton also have a rivalry based on proximity to each other. The teams have met every year since 1977 with the exception of 1991, 1992 and 2020. Dayton leads 34–14–1.

=== PFL champions===
(*) Due to COVID-19, the Pioneer Football League suspended the fall 2020 football season. Dayton and Marist opted out of the spring season. Presbyterian played a full PFL schedule, but was ineligible for the conference title, and its games were not counted in PFL standings.

==League titles by school==
* – Won in PFL Championship Game

&quot;Italics&quot; – Co-champions

==PFL Championship Game==
== Postseason games==
The Pioneer Football League has had alliances with the Gridiron Classic and the Sports Network Cup. In addition, league members are allowed to accept at-large invitations to other college bowl games and teams are eligible to compete in the FCS playoffs.

Through the 2012 season, the NCAA did not offer the league an automatic invite to the FCS playoffs and never offered an at-large bid to any of its teams, effectively barring the league from the tournament. Starting in 2013, the Pioneer League received an automatic bid to compete in the Division I Football Championship as the playoffs expanded from 20 teams to 24. The PFL won its first playoff game in 2016, as San Diego advanced past the first round of the playoffs.

The PFL was a participant in the NCAA Division I FCS Consensus Mid-Major Football National Championship, along with the Northeast Conference and Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, two other conferences without automatic playoff bids. The Consensus championship has since been discontinued; the NEC first earned an automatic postseason bid in 2010, while the MAAC no longer sponsors football.

===Members pre-PFL postseason results===
Below are postseason accomplishments by past and current members prior to the formation of the Pioneer Football League.

=== PFL Sports Network Cup results ===
*See Sports Network Cup

=== PFL Gridiron Classic results===
From 2006 through 2009, the PFL and Northeast Conference (NEC) staged the Gridiron Classic, an exempted postseason football game that matched the champions of the two conferences which were technically members of Division I FCS, but which were not the recipients of automatic invitations to the football championship playoff at the time.

=== NCAA Division I Football Championship results===
Since 2013, the PFL champion has received an invite to the FCS playoffs; previously, PFL teams had to receive an at-large bid, which no team ever received.

* - St. Thomas was the PFL champion in 2022; however, they were ineligible for postseason play due to still being in transition from Division III. Davidson, the runner-up, was awarded the auto-bid in their place.

<text>The Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10) is a collegiate athletic conference whose schools compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s (NCAA) Division I. The A-10&#x27;s member schools are located mostly on the East Coast and Midwest of the United States: Illinois, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.

Although some of its members are state-funded, half of its membership is made up of private, Catholic institutions. Despite the name, there are 15 full-time members in the conference; three affiliate members participate in women&#x27;s field hockey and men&#x27;s lacrosse.

The conference&#x27;s commissioner since 2008 is Bernadette McGlade. In fall, 2023, the A-10 moved its headquarters from Newport News, Virginia, to Washington, D.C.

==History==


===Early History===
The Atlantic 10 Conference was founded in 1975 as the Eastern Collegiate Basketball League (ECBL) and began conference play in 1976. At that time, basketball was its only sport. After its first season, it added sports other than basketball and changed its name to the Eastern Athletic Association. However, despite its official names, it was popularly known as the Eastern 8, as it then had eight members (Villanova, Duquesne, Penn State, West Virginia, George Washington, Massachusetts, Pittsburgh, and Rutgers).

After changes in membership that saw charter members Villanova and Pittsburgh leave (in 1980 and 1982, respectively) and new members St. Bonaventure (1979), Rhode Island (1980), Saint Joseph&#x27;s (1982), and Temple (1982) enter, establishing the league with 10 members, the conference adopted the current Atlantic 10 name in 1982.

===Expansion, Contraction, and Football===
Further membership changes saw the league expand to its maximum of 16 members. From 1997 through 2006, the league also operated a football conference; during that period, more than 20 schools were participating in A-10 competition in at least one sport. This ended when the A-10 football programs all departed to join a new football conference sponsored by the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA; now known as the Coastal Athletic Association). In 2012, Butler joined the conference after leaving the Horizon League and VCU joined after leaving the CAA.

===Conference Realignments and Expanding Media Presence===
Conference realignment in 2013 saw the departure of Temple to the American Athletic Conference, Butler and Xavier to the reconfigured Big East, and Charlotte to Conference USA. George Mason joined from the CAA, and Davidson from the Southern Conference announced it would join in 2014.

The league headquarters is located in Washington, DC. In the Fall of 2023 they relocated the HQ from Newport News, Virginia where it had been located since fall 2009. Prior to that, the headquarters was in Philadelphia, within a few miles of member schools Saint Joseph&#x27;s and La Salle.

The conference currently has media deals with ESPN, CBS Sports Network, NBC Sports, and digital broadcasts with ESPN+.

On November 16, 2021, Loyola University Chicago announced that its athletic program - the Loyola Ramblers - would leave the Missouri Valley Conference and join the A-10 effective July 1, 2022. On May 23, 2022, the addition of men&#x27;s lacrosse was announced for the 2023 season. The four full members that sponsor the sport (Richmond, St. Bonaventure, Saint Joseph&#x27;s, UMass) were joined by new affiliate members High Point and Hobart.

On December 14, 2023, the conference announced a five-year media deal with its current affiliates, ESPN, CBS, and NBC. The deal would expand basketball coverage and revenue for the schools. The first year of the new contract is the 2024-2025 season and runs through the 2028-29 season.

In late February 2024, it was announced that the 2024-25 season for UMass sports will be the last season as members of the Atlantic 10. The Minutemen will rejoin the Mid-American Conference (MAC) as a full member beginning in 2025.

After expansion in the Colonial Athletic Association brought that conference to 6 football-playing schools, it was agreed that the CAA would take over management of the Atlantic 10&#x27;s football conference starting in the 2007–08 school year as the legally separate entity of CAA Football. All the schools on this list (except Boston U. and Connecticut) were in the A-10 football conference when it became CAA Football, but Hofstra and Northeastern discontinued their football programs after the 2009–10 school year. Membership dates include time in the Yankee Conference (which was an all-sports conference from the 1947–48 to 1975–76 seasons, and a football-only conference after that) which merged into the A-10 in the 1997–98 school year.

==Atlantic 10 rivalries==
There are a number of intense rivalries within the Atlantic 10, with rivalries that carry over from the Big 5 which includes Saint Joseph&#x27;s, La Salle, and Temple (now in the American Athletic Conference). URI and UMass also have a long-standing rivalry. St. Bonaventure and Duquesne also maintain a rivalry that predates their affiliation with the conference. UMass and Temple also had a basketball rivalry while John Chaney was coaching Temple but it has died down a bit since, and even more so now that Temple has left the conference. Due to both teams sharing the Ram mascot, the Fordham - URI rivalry has increased in recent years as the competitions are heralded as &quot;The Battle of the Rams.&quot; The long-standing crosstown rivalry between Richmond and VCU, now known as the Capital City Classic, became a conference rivalry with VCU&#x27;s arrival in the A10. Rivals St. Louis and Dayton play each year in basketball for the Arch-Baron Cup. George Washington and George Mason compete annually in the Revolutionary Rivalry across all sports.

== Sports ==
In the 2021–22 academic year, the Atlantic 10 Conference sponsors championship competition in ten men&#x27;s and thirteen women&#x27;s NCAA sanctioned sports, with lacrosse becoming the 10th sponsored men&#x27;s sport in 2022–23 and women&#x27;s golf becoming the 13th sponsored women&#x27;s sport in 2024–25. In addition to the 15 full members, two Pennsylvania schools, Lock Haven and Saint Francis, are affiliate members in field hockey. High Point and Hobart became men&#x27;s lacrosse affiliates in July 2022.

==Football (1997–2006)==

===Origin===
The A-10 began sponsoring football in 1997 when it absorbed the Yankee Conference, a Division I-AA (now known as Division I FCS) football-only conference. The move was triggered by a change in NCAA rules that reduced the influence of single-sport conferences over NCAA legislation. The following teams were in the Yankee Conference at the time of its demise:
* Boston University Terriers football
* Connecticut Huskies football
* Delaware Fightin&#x27; Blue Hens football
* James Madison Dukes football
* Maine Black Bears football
* UMass Minutemen football
* New Hampshire Wildcats football
* Northeastern Huskies football
* Rhode Island Rams football
* Richmond Spiders football
* Villanova Wildcats football
* William &amp; Mary Tribe football
Boston University dropped football after the first season of A-10 football. After the 1999 season, UConn started a transition from Division I-AA to Division I-A football (now Division I FBS) that was completed in 2002. In 2004, UConn, already a member of the Big East for other sports, became a football member of that conference. The other schools all remained in the A-10 football conference until the management change after the 2006 season.

===Football champions===
===Demise/&quot;Rename&quot;===
The 2005 move of Northeastern University, a football-only member of the A-10, to the Colonial Athletic Association for basketball and Olympic sports began a chain of events that would lead to the demise of the A-10 football conference, at least under the A-10 banner.

At that time, the CAA did not sponsor football, but five of its members in the 2004–05 academic year (Delaware, Hofstra, James Madison, Towson, and William &amp; Mary) were football members of the A-10. The addition of Northeastern gave the CAA six schools with football programs, which under NCAA rules allows a conference to sponsor football. Northeastern agreed to join any future CAA football conference, which meant that the A-10 football conference would drop to six members once CAA football began operation.

With six football members in place, the CAA decided to start a football conference in 2007. The league then invited Richmond, a member of the CAA from 1983 to 2001, to rejoin for football only, because of UR&#x27;s long-standing in-state rivalries with William &amp; Mary and James Madison. UR accepted the invitation, taking the A-10 football conference below the NCAA minimum of six. Shortly after this, the A-10 football conference opted to disband, with all of its members becoming charter members of the CAA football conference. This league continues to operate under the administration of the multi-sports CAA, now known as the Coastal Athletic Association, as the legally separate entity of CAA Football (in full, the Coastal Athletic Association Football Conference).

===A-10 schools in DI-A/FBS===
A-10 charter members Penn State, Pittsburgh, Rutgers, West Virginia, and Villanova played I-A football as independents while members of the A-10 in other sports. Villanova became a member of the Big East in 1980 with Pittsburgh following in 1982. Temple joined the A-10 that year. Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1991 (effectively in 1993), and three A-10 members joined the Big East as football-only members: Rutgers, West Virginia, and Temple (only Rutgers and West Virginia would later join the Big East as full members in 1995).

Virginia Tech joined the A-10 in 1995 as a result of the merger that created Conference USA. They would then join the Big East as full members in 2000, following the football program which was already a member of the league. Temple remained a football-only member of the Big East until 2004; they would join the MAC for football in 2007 until 2012, and re-joined the Big East in football for the 2012 season. Temple planned to move the rest of its sports into the Big East in 2013, but the conference realigned into the football-sponsoring American Athletic Conference and a new non-football Big East. Temple joined The American. Massachusetts joined them in FBS football with membership in the MAC beginning in the 2012 season and as an FBS independent beginning in 2016. Charlotte, which started a football program in 2013, left for Conference USA and eventually joined The American in 2023.

<text>The Missouri Valley Football Conference (MVFC), formerly the Gateway Football Conference, is a collegiate athletic conference which operates in the Midwestern United States. It participates in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) as a football-only conference.

==History==
The Missouri Valley Football Conference has a complex history that involves three other conferences:

* Missouri Valley Conference (MVC): A long-established conference, in existence since 1907, that sponsored football until 1985. In its last years as a football conference, it was a hybrid league that included teams in NCAA Divisions I-A (today&#x27;s FBS) and I-AA (now FCS).
* Gateway Collegiate Athletic Conference (Gateway): A women&#x27;s sports conference founded in 1982 by MVC member schools.
* Association of Mid-Continent Universities (AMCU): An all-sports conference, also founded in 1982, that sponsored football at the I-AA level through the 1984 season. The AMCU had absorbed the Mid-Continent Athletic Association, a football-only league founded in 1978. (After dropping football, the AMCU later became the Mid-Continent Conference, and is now The Summit League.)

In 1985, the MVC stopped sponsoring football. At that time, the two remaining I-AA members from the MVC (Illinois State and Southern Illinois) joined Eastern Illinois, Northern Iowa, Southwest Missouri State, and Western Illinois from the AMCU and together became a football conference under Gateway&#x27;s auspices. Indiana State, which had left MVC football after the 1981 season to become a Division I-AA independent while remaining a full MVC member, would join the next year.

In 1992, when the Gateway Collegiate Athletic Conference merged with the MVC, the football conference kept the Gateway charter, with a minor name change to Gateway Football Conference. After Eastern Illinois joined the Ohio Valley Conference for football in 1996, Youngstown State joined in 1997 and was followed by Western Kentucky University in 2001. Southwest Missouri State changed its name to Missouri State in 2005.

Western Kentucky moved to the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; formerly Division I-A) after the 2006 season, leaving the GFC with seven members for the 2007 season. Great West Football Conference members North Dakota State and South Dakota State were invited to join the conference beginning with the 2008 season. Subsequently, the Gateway Football Conference changed its name to the Missouri Valley Football Conference in June 2008. This change aligned the conference with the Missouri Valley Conference, a conference in which five of the nine Missouri Valley Football schools were (and still are) all-sports members. The conferences continue to share the &quot;Missouri Valley&quot; name, and space in the same building in St. Louis, but remain separate administratively.

The University of South Dakota joined as the 10th member in 2012. The University of North Dakota joined as the 11th member in 2020, bringing back the yearly rivalries among North Dakota, North Dakota State, South Dakota and South Dakota State which had existed under the Division II North Central Conference that NDSU and SDSU left in 2004–05.

On April 4, 2022, Murray State University, who had previously been announced as a new MVC member effective in July 2022, joined the MVFC in 2023, bringing the league up to a record high of 12 active members. This was short-lived however, as on May 12, 2023, founding member Western Illinois announced that they would be leaving the MVFC and their full time conference, the Summit League, for the Ohio Valley Conference beginning in fall 2023 and 2024. They would leave the Summit beginning in fall 2023, and would leave the Valley after the conclusion of the 2023 football season. Almost exactly a year after that, on May 10, 2024, fellow founding member Missouri State announced that they accepted an invitation to join Conference USA in all sports, beginning with the 2025-26 academic year.

<text>The Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) is a collegiate athletic conference which operates in the Midwestern and Southeastern United States. It participates in Division I of the NCAA; the conference&#x27;s football programs compete in partnership with the Big South Conference in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS; formerly known as Division I-AA), the lower of two levels of Division I football competition. The OVC has 11 members, seven of which compete in football in the conference.

==History==
&quot;Primary source:&quot;
The Ohio Valley Conference can trace its roots to 1941 when Murray State athletic director Roy Stewart, Eastern Kentucky athletic director Charles &quot;Turkey&quot; Hughes, and Western Kentucky public relations director Kelly Thompson first formulated the idea of establishing a regional athletics conference. The plan was put on hold due to World War II, but it was resurrected after the conclusion of the war. In 1948, the three schools joined with Louisville, Morehead State, and Evansville to form the Ohio Valley Conference. While many collegiate conferences are struggling today with the question of whether their policies and rules should be determined by the athletic departments or by the institutional heads, from the very beginning, the OVC has been run by the presidents of its member schools.

Historically, the OVC was a pioneer in racial desegregation, with Morehead State signing the conference&#x27;s first Black athlete, Marshall Banks, in 1958. The rest of the OVC soon followed in Morehead State&#x27;s wake. From 1986 to 2018, the OVC was unique among NCAA Division I conferences in that it included one historically Black university, Tennessee State University, in a conference that otherwise consists of institutions that are not traditionally Black. During this period, every other HBCU in NCAA Division I belonged to either the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference or Southwestern Athletic Conference. That distinction changed when both Hampton University and North Carolina A&amp;T State University joined the Big South Conference in 2018 and 2021, respectively; both schools have since joined the Coastal Athletic Association.

The OVC has also been a leader in advancement of sports opportunities for women. The conference began adding championship competitions for women in 1977 several years after the AIAW began sponsoring national championships for women, but seven years before the NCAA was ready to move into the field. Since 2009, the OVC has been led by Commissioner Beth DeBauche, one of only six female commissioners for the thirty-two Division I conferences.

Athletic rivalries, really close colleges and especially when competitors are in relatively close proximity, can generate problems with fan behavior, and the conference leadership struggled with controlling the issue for many years. When the national debate on the problem reached its apex in the mid-1990s, the OVC unveiled the national first of its kind &quot;Sportsmanship Statement&quot; in 1995, stating the conference&#x27;s policy on, &quot;... principles of fair play, ethical conduct and respect for one&#x27;s opponent.&quot; Since then, the OVC has also introduced individual, team (for each sport), and institutional sportsmanship awards.

Founded by six schools, the expansions of 2007 and 2011 brought the Ohio Valley Conference membership to twelve schools, the most in its history. The OVC dropped to 10 members after the 2020–21 school year, when founding member Eastern Kentucky and Jacksonville State left for the Atlantic Sun Conference (then branded as the ASUN Conference; &quot;ASUN&quot; is still the official abbreviation). At that time, the OVC was searching for teams to replace both.

The OVC lost three more members after the 2021–22 school year. Football-sponsoring Austin Peay left for the ASUN, which ultimately launched its own football league in 2022. Non-football Belmont left for the Missouri Valley Conference. Another football school, founding member Murray State, left for the MVC. When announcing its move to the MVC, Murray State announced that it was seeking membership in the football-only Missouri Valley Football Conference, and also announced that it would continue to house its rifle team in the OVC. In a separate statement, Murray State&#x27;s president indicated that the football team would remain in the OVC in the 2022 season, ensuring that the OVC would retain its automatic bid to the FCS playoffs in that season and giving the league more time to add new football members. Murray State would eventually be accepted by the MVFC effective in 2023.

Also in July 2022, the OVC added two non-football members in the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, athletically known as Little Rock, and the University of Southern Indiana, which started a transition from NCAA Division II, plus a new football-sponsoring member in Lindenwood University, also transitioning from D-II.

According to a report from Matt Brown of the &quot;Extra Points&quot; college sports blog, the OVC expected to lose Murray State, and was considering multiple expansion candidates, with Southern Indiana among them. Other schools named by Brown&#x27;s sources as possible candidates were FCS programs Arkansas–Pine Bluff and Western Illinois, plus potential Division II upgraders Grand Valley State, Hillsdale, and Lincoln Memorial.

On February 22, 2022, the conference announced its intent to combine its football membership with the Big South Conference beginning in 2023 and operate as the OVC–Big South Football Association. The alliance follows the model that the ASUN and Western Athletic Conference used in 2021 and 2022 before merging their football leagues in 2023 as the United Athletic Conference.

Shortly after the 2022 membership changes took effect, the OVC and the Horizon League jointly announced that they would merge their men&#x27;s tennis leagues under the Horizon banner, effective immediately. All five OVC members that sponsored men&#x27;s tennis became Horizon affiliates in that sport.

On March 28, 2023, the OVC announced it was adding men&#x27;s soccer as its 19th championship sport. The four OVC members sponsoring the sport in other conferences were joined by Chicago State University, Houston Christian University, University of the Incarnate Word, and Liberty University. Chicago State was also announced as an incoming men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf associate on that day. Chicago State&#x27;s OVC teams left the conference at the end of the 2023–24 school year when the university joined the Northeast Conference, which sponsors all sports that CSU housed in the OVC.

On May 12, 2023, it was announced that Western Illinois University would join the OVC from the Summit League in most non-football sports beginning for the 2023 season. Western Illinois football, which was then a member of the Missouri Valley Football Conference, played the 2023 season in that league before joining the university&#x27;s other sports in the OVC for the 2024 season. Western later announced its men&#x27;s soccer team would also play the 2023 season in its former all-sports home of the Summit League before joining the OVC in 2024.

==OVC Digital Network==
In August 2012, the OVC announced that it had launched the OVC Digital Network as a replacement for and improvement over the conference&#x27;s former efforts to provide streaming video coverage of many athletic events that had been in place since 2006. This website carried live, student-produced coverage of most conference games and some non-conference games in baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, football, soccer, softball, and volleyball as well as some coaches&#x27; shows, special presentations, and archived game-casts available for later viewing.

In its first two years, the network provided well over 600,000 viewings of streamed live video of more than 1,400 events.

In the 2018–19 school year, the coverage previously carried on the OVC Digital Network was switched over to ESPN+.

====Comments====
* Morehead State&#x27;s football team competes in the Pioneer Football League, a Division I FCS football-only conference whose members choose not to offer athletic scholarships for football.
* Austin Peay&#x27;s football team left the OVC after the 1996 season to compete as an NCAA D-I FCS Independent. After four seasons as an Independent, the team joined the Pioneer Football League in 2001, and remained there through the 2005 season. Austin Peay then returned to scholarship football, spending the 2006 season as an Independent before re-entering OVC football competition in 2007.

==Conference divisions==
Starting with the 2012–13 school year, the twelve member schools were split into two divisions for those sports where all schools competed. In the 2014–15 season, women&#x27;s sports with twelve teams returned to a single league table, while continuing to play a divisional schedule. Men&#x27;s basketball moved to an 18-game schedule in 2017–18, and they continued to play home-and-home versus the former divisional rivals, and they play home-and-home versus two teams from the other division, with those opponents on a rotation that sets up different pairs from year-to-year. The OVC returned to a single-table format after Eastern Kentucky and Jacksonville State left in 2021.
==Sports offered==
The Ohio Valley Conference currently offers championship competition in 19 NCAA sanctioned sports, with eight for men, 10 for women, and rifle for men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and coed teams.

<text>The Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC ) is a collegiate athletic conference whose full members are historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the Southeastern and the Mid-Atlantic United States. It participates in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, and in football, in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).

Currently, the MEAC has automatic qualifying bids for NCAA postseason play in men&#x27;s basketball (since 1981), women&#x27;s basketball (since 1982), softball (since 1995), men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis (since 1998), and volleyball (since 1994). Bowling was officially sanctioned as a MEAC-governed sport in 1999. Before that season, the MEAC was the first conference to secure NCAA sanctioning for women&#x27;s bowling by adopting the club sport prior to the 1996–97 school year.

==History==

In 1969, a group whose members were long associated with interscholastic athletics met in Durham, North Carolina for the purpose of discussing the organization of a new conference. After the formulation of a committee, and their research reported, seven institutions, Delaware State University, Howard University, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Morgan State University, North Carolina A&amp;T State University, North Carolina Central University and South Carolina State College, agreed to become the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. South Carolina State had been a longtime member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, while the other charter members had been longtime members of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association.

The conference&#x27;s main goals were to establish and supervise an intercollegiate athletic program among a group of educational institutions that shared the same academic standards and philosophy of co-curricular activities and seek status as a Division I conference for all of its sports.

The conference was confirmed in 1970, and had its first season of competition in football in 1971. The MEAC has had three full-time commissioners. In 1978, the MEAC selected its first full-time commissioner, Kenneth A. Free, who served as commissioner until he resigned in 1995. He was succeeded by Charles S. Harris, who served at the position until 2002. On September 1, 2002, Dennis E. Thomas became the conference&#x27;s commissioner. He retired on December 31, 2021. Sonja O. Stills became the first female commissioner of the MEAC on January 1, 2022. She is also the only female commissioner of a Division I HBCU athletic conference.

The MEAC experienced its first expansion in 1979 when Bethune–Cookman College (now Bethune–Cookman University) and Florida A&amp;M University were admitted as new members. That same year, founding members Morgan State University, North Carolina Central University and University of Maryland Eastern Shore withdrew from the conference. All three schools eventually returned to the conference; Maryland Eastern Shore rejoined in 1981, Morgan State in 1984, and North Carolina Central in 2010.

On June 8, 1978, the MEAC was classified as a Division I conference by the NCAA. Prior to that year, the league operated as a Division II conference. The following month the MEAC received an automatic qualification to the NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship.

In 1984, membership in the MEAC again changed, as Florida A&amp;M chose to leave. The university returned to the conference two years later. Coppin State College, now Coppin State University, joined the conference in 1985. The MEAC found some stability in membership with the addition of two HBCUs in Virginia, Hampton University and Norfolk State University in 1995 and 1997, respectively. For the next ten years, the MEAC remained an 11-member conference. In 2007, former CIAA member Winston-Salem State University was granted membership, but announced on September 11, 2009, that it would return to Division II at the end of 2009–10 and apply to return to the CIAA before ever becoming a full member of the MEAC.

North Carolina Central University rejoined the conference effective July 1, 2010. NCCU was one of seven founding member institutions of the MEAC, but withdrew from the conference in 1979, opting to remain a Division II member when the conference reclassified to Division I.

Savannah State University was announced as the newest member of the MEAC on March 10, 2010. Savannah State originally applied for membership into the MEAC in 2006 but faced an NCAA probationary period soon after. Membership was then deferred until the completion of the imposed probation period, which ended in May 2009. Savannah State then resubmitted their application for membership again in 2009 and was finally granted probationary membership status. On September 8, 2011, the university was confirmed as a full MEAC member.

While the MEAC has had no new full members since then, the conference added an associate member in 2014 when Augusta University, then known as Georgia Regents University, a Division II institution with Division I programs in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, joined for men&#x27;s golf. Augusta became the MEAC&#x27;s first associate member and first non-HBCU with any type of membership. The conference has since added two more non-HBCU associate members, with Monmouth University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) joining for bowling in 2018.

In April 2017, Savannah State announced that it would drop to Division II effective with the 2019–20 school year. In November 2017, Hampton announced they would leave the MEAC to join the Big South Conference beginning with the 2018–19 season.

In February 2020 North Carolina A&amp;T announced departing MEAC to join Big South Conference effective July 2021. Within few months, in June 2020, Florida A&amp;M and Bethune-Cookman also announced that they will leave the MEAC and join the SWAC starting in July 2021. As a result, the MEAC will have eight members remaining for 2021, with only six of its members sponsoring football. The MEAC has hired a consulting firm to help assess its current schools and to help it identify potential institutions for addition to the conference. The conference plans to operate with eight current members, starting 2021 until further expansion, in a compact geographical footprint removing North and South divisions.

In May 2021, multiple websites that report on HBCU sports indicated that the MEAC had reached out to two Division II HBCUs about their interest in transitioning to D-I and joining the MEAC. Kentucky State University and Virginia State University, respectively members of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference and Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association, confirmed that they had discussed possible membership with the MEAC and had commissioned feasibility studies on moving to Division I. Officials at both schools stated that they were considering the move, but would not commit to any change. One report also indicated that Chicago State University, a predominantly African-American school but not an HBCU, had lobbied the MEAC regarding membership. CSU was scheduled to leave the Western Athletic Conference, a league in which it is a major geographic outlier, in July 2022 to become an independent. According to this report, the MEAC had offered CSU associate membership in one sport, but was lukewarm to CSU becoming a full member because it does not sponsor football and is well outside the MEAC&#x27;s geographic footprint.

In July 2022, the Northeast Conference (NEC) announced a partnership with the MEAC in which MEAC schools sponsoring baseball and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf would become NEC affiliate members in their respective sports beginning in the 2022-23 season.

The MEAC, along with the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC), are the only two Division I conferences whose members are mostly Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). In 2015, the MEAC joined the SWAC and Ivy leagues in abstaining from sending their conference champions to the FCS Playoffs. While the conference champion faces off in the Celebration Bowl against the SWAC Champion, the remaining conference members remain eligible for at-large bids for the playoffs.

&quot;This is a partial list of the last 10 champions. For the full history, see List of Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference football champions.&quot;

====Celebration Bowl results====

=== Men&#x27;s basketball ===

On June 8, 1980, the MEAC earned the classification as a Division I conference by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since 1981, the MEAC has received a qualifying bid to NCAA post season play in the sport of basketball. In three cases, MEAC schools seeded 15th (Coppin State in 1997, Hampton in 2001, Norfolk State in 2012) defeated second-seeded teams South Carolina, Iowa State and Missouri, respectively, in the NCAA tournament.

Coppin State again made history, as it qualified for the tournament as the first 20-loss team to play in the NCAA Tournament.

<text>The Patriot League is a collegiate athletic conference comprising private institutions of higher education and two United States service academies based in the Northeastern United States. Except for the Ivy League, it is the most selective group of higher education institutions in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and has a very high student-athlete graduation rate for both the NCAA graduation success rate and the federal graduation rate.

The Patriot League has 10 core members: American University, the United States Military Academy (Army), Boston University, Bucknell University, Colgate University, College of the Holy Cross, Lafayette College, Lehigh University, Loyola University Maryland, and the United States Naval Academy (Navy). All 10 core members participate in the NCAA Division I for all Patriot League sports that they offer. Since not all schools sponsor every available NCAA sport, most schools are affiliated with other collegiate conferences for sports such as ice hockey and wrestling.

Only half of the conference&#x27;s core members compete in the Patriot League for football, as part of the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS): Bucknell, Colgate, Holy Cross, Lafayette, and Lehigh. Of the five other conference members, American, Boston University, and Loyola Maryland do not sponsor football, while Army and Navy play in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision as football-only members of the American Athletic Conference (The American).

Four other private institutions are Patriot League members only for specific sports, and are referred to as associate members. Fordham University and Georgetown University are associate members in football, while MIT is an associate member in women&#x27;s rowing and the University of Richmond is an associate member in women&#x27;s golf. Starting in the 2025 season, Richmond will also be an associate member in football.

==About==
Patriot League members are schools with very strong academic reputations that adhere strongly to the ideal of the &quot;scholar-athlete&quot;, with the emphasis on &quot;scholar&quot;. An academic index ensures that athletes are truly representative of and integrated with the rest of the student body. Out-of-league play for Patriot League schools is often with members of the Ivy League, which follow similar philosophies regarding academics and athletics.

Patriot League members have some of the oldest collegiate athletic programs in the country. In particular, &quot;The Rivalry&quot; between Lehigh University and Lafayette College is both the nation&#x27;s most-played and longest-uninterrupted college football series.

The winner of the Patriot League basketball tournament receives an automatic invitation to the NCAA Division I basketball tournament every March. In recent years, Bucknell (twice) and Lehigh have both won NCAA tournament games. The Patriot League champions in a number of other sports also receive an automatic invitation to their respective NCAA tournaments.

==History==

The origins of the Patriot League began after the eight Ivy League schools expanded their football schedules to ten games starting in 1980. Needing opponents with a similar competitive level on a regular basis for each team&#x27;s three nonconference games, the league contacted two university presidents, the Reverend John E. Brooks, S.J., of Holy Cross, and Peter Likins of Lehigh, about forming a new conference that also prohibited athletic scholarships. The result was the Colonial League, a football-only circuit that began competition in 1986. Its six charter members were Holy Cross, Lehigh, Bucknell, Colgate, Lafayette, and Davidson. Davidson dropped out after the 1988 season for reasons related to geography, lack of competitiveness, and a reluctance to relinquish its basketball scholarships in case the conference expanded into other sports.
In 1990, the league changed its name to the Patriot League at the suggestion of Carl F. Ullrich, who would go on to become the conference&#x27;s first full-time administrator. At the start of the 1990–91 academic year, the league became an all-sport conference, with 22 sports (11 for men and 11 for women), and now had seven full members, including Fordham and the United States Military Academy (Army) as new members. In 1991, the league gained an eighth full member, the United States Naval Academy (Navy).

In 1993, the league hired Constance (Connie) H. Hurlbut as executive director. She was the first woman and youngest person to be the leader of an NCAA Division I conference.

In 1995, Fordham resigned its full membership (leaving the league with seven full members) but continued as an associate member in football. In 1996, Fairfield and Ursinus joined as associate members in field hockey. (Fairfield left after the 2003 fall season and is now an associate member of the Northeast Conference. Ursinus left after the 2001 fall season and is now a full member of the Division III Centennial Conference.) In 1997, Towson joined as an associate member in football. (Towson left after the 2003 fall season to join the Atlantic 10 Conference, whose football conference would be absorbed by the Colonial Athletic Association in 2007.) In 1999, Hobart joined as an associate member in men&#x27;s lacrosse and Villanova joined as an associate member in women&#x27;s lacrosse. (Hobart left after the 2004 spring season, to join the ECAC Lacrosse League, while Villanova left after the 2006 spring season.) In 2001, American University joined as the eighth full member and Georgetown University joined as an associate member in football. Two schools announced in summer 2012 that they would join the league for the 2013–14 academic year, with Boston University making its announcement on June 15, and Loyola University Maryland doing so on August 29.

In May 2024, the University of Richmond, who at the time was already an associate member of the league for women&#x27;s golf, announced that they would also move their football program to the Patriot League for the 2025 season, becoming the Patriot League&#x27;s first new football-playing member in over 20 years.

===Athletic scholarships===
While Patriot League colleges have always offered need-based financial aid, league members have only been allowed to give athletic scholarships in recent years. Basketball scholarships were first allowed beginning with freshmen entering the league in the fall of 1998.

In 2001, when the league admitted American, which gave scholarships in all its sports (AU does not play football), the league began allowing all schools to do so in sports other than football. Lafayette, the last holdout with no athletic scholarships, began granting full rides in basketball and other sports with freshmen entering the school in the fall of 2006. Most Patriot League schools do not give athletic scholarships in a number of sports, and Bucknell only granted them in basketball prior to the addition of football scholarships in 2013.

In the spring of 2009, Fordham University announced that it would start offering football scholarships in the fall of 2010. This action made Fordham ineligible for the league championship in that sport, but it also prompted a league-wide discussion on football scholarships. On February 13, 2012, the Patriot League announced its members could begin offering football scholarships starting with the 2013–14 academic year. Since then, each school has been allowed no more than the equivalent of 15 scholarships to incoming football players. Presidents from six of the seven football schools indicated they would award scholarships in the fall of 2012. Georgetown University did not commit to offering scholarships. Since the transition to scholarship football was completed for the 2016–17 academic year, each football member has been allowed up to 60 scholarship equivalents per season, a total only slightly lower than the NCAA limit of 63 scholarship equivalents for FCS programs. Currently, Patriot League schools are permitted to offer up to the NCAA maximum of 63 scholarships for its football programs.

===President&#x27;s Cup===

The Patriot League Presidents&#x27; Cup is awarded to the member institution with the highest cumulative sports point total for their Patriot League standings in sponsored men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports. Points are awarded based upon a combination of an institution&#x27;s regular-season and tournament finishes in each sport.

;NCAA

In NCAA basketball, Boston, Bucknell, Navy, Lehigh, and Holy Cross are the only teams in the conference ever to have recorded NCAA Tournament victories. Bucknell won tournament games in 2005 over Kansas and in 2006 over Arkansas. Lehigh won over Duke in the first round in the 2012 tournament.

The Bison, Mountain Hawks, and Crusaders are the only teams to win in the NCAA tournament while actually representing the Patriot League. A Navy team—then representing the Colonial Athletic Association—led by future Hall of Famer David Robinson won three tournament games while advancing to the regional finals in 1986, while BU won two games in the 1959 tournament before falling in the regional finals. Holy Cross was among the best teams in the country in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and won the 1947 national championship with a team that included future Hall of Famer Bob Cousy. Its combined record in the NCAA tournament is 8–12. After a 63-year drought, Holy Cross defeated Southern University in the 2016 NCAA Tournament. Bryan Cohen of Bucknell was named Patriot League Defensive Player of Year in 2010, 2011, and 2012; he was the only player in league history to win the award three times.

The Patriot League prohibited athletic scholarships for football from its founding (as the Colonial League) until the league presidents voted to approve football scholarships starting with the 2013 recruiting class. Since then, each school has been allowed no more than the equivalent of 15 scholarships to incoming football players in any given season. With the transition to scholarship football having been completed in 2016, each school is now allowed a maximum of 60 scholarship equivalents per season, three short of the NCAA FCS maximum. However, Georgetown does not offer scholarships.

Until 1997, Patriot League teams did not participate in the NCAA Division I Football Championship playoffs. This practice was in step with the Ivy League&#x27;s policy of not participating in the playoffs, since the Patriot League was founded with the Ivy League&#x27;s athletics philosophy. Since 1997, the league champion receives an automatic playoff berth. If there are co-champions, a tie-breaker determines the playoff participant, though the other co-champion is eligible to be selected with an at-large invitation.

Colgate was the first team to receive the league&#x27;s automatic berth, in 1997. The following year, Lehigh won the league&#x27;s first playoff game. This was also the first year in which a Patriot League team, Colgate, received a playoff invitation without being a league co-champion. Fordham has since repeated that feat in 2013, 2015 and 2022.

Because the Georgetown Hoyas opted out of the 2020-21 NCAA Division I FCS football season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Patriot League split into a north and south division for the first time. This led to the first ever Patriot League Football Championship Game

==Literature==
The Patriot League was profiled in the John Feinstein book &quot;The Last Amateurs&quot; (2000). The title is derived from the belief that the Patriot League was the last Division I basketball league that plays a conference tournament (the Ivy League, which operates under the same model, albeit with no scholarships, did not hold a conference tournament until the 2016–17 season) and functions as a place for student-athletes rather than a &quot;de facto&quot; minor professional circuit with players not representative of their student bodies. The book is Feinstein&#x27;s chronicle of all seven of the league&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball teams at the time during the 1999–2000 season.

<text>The Surveyor program was a NASA program that, from June 1966 through January 1968, sent seven robotic spacecraft to the surface of the Moon. Its primary goal was to demonstrate the feasibility of soft landings on the Moon. The Surveyor craft were the first American spacecraft to achieve soft landing on an extraterrestrial body. The missions called for the craft to travel directly to the Moon on an impact trajectory, a journey that lasted 63 to 65 hours, and ended with a deceleration of just over three minutes to a soft landing. 

The program was implemented by NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to prepare for the Apollo program, and started in 1960. JPL selected Hughes Aircraft in 1961 to develop the spacecraft system. The total cost of the Surveyor program was officially $469 million.

Five of the Surveyor craft successfully soft-landed on the Moon, including the first one. The other two failed: Surveyor 2 crashed at high velocity after a failed mid-course correction, and Surveyor 4 lost contact (possibly exploding) 2.5 minutes before its scheduled touch-down.

All seven spacecraft are still on the Moon; none of the missions included returning them to Earth. Some parts of Surveyor 3 were returned to Earth by the crew of Apollo 12, which landed near it in 1969. The camera from this craft is on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.

== Goals ==
The program performed several other services beyond its primary goal of demonstrating soft landings. The ability of spacecraft to make midcourse corrections was demonstrated, and the landers carried instruments to help evaluate the suitability of their landing sites for crewed Apollo landings. Several Surveyor spacecraft had robotic shovels designed to test lunar soil mechanics. Before the Soviet Luna 9 mission (landing four months before Surveyor 1) and the Surveyor project, it was unknown how deep the dust on the Moon was. If the dust was too deep, then no astronaut could land. The Surveyor program proved that landings were possible. Some of the Surveyors also had alpha scattering instruments and magnets, which helped determine the chemical composition of the soil.

The simple and reliable mission architecture was a pragmatic approach to solving the most critical space engineering challenges of the time, namely the closed-loop terminal descent guidance and control system, throttleable engines, and the radar systems required for determining the lander&#x27;s altitude and velocity. The Surveyor missions were the first time that NASA tested such systems in the challenging thermal and radiation environment near the Moon.

== Launch and lunar landing ==
Each Surveyor mission consisted of a single unmanned spacecraft designed and built by Hughes Aircraft Company. The launch vehicle was the Atlas-Centaur, which injected the craft directly into trans-lunar flightpath. The craft did not orbit the Moon on reaching it, but directly decelerated from impact trajectory, from 2.6 km/s relative to the Moon before firing retrorockets to a soft landing about 3 minutes 10 seconds later.

Each craft was planned to slow to about 110 m/s (4% of speed before retrofire) by a main solid fuel retrorocket, which fired for 40 seconds starting at an altitude of 75.3 km above the Moon, and then was jettisoned along with the radar unit at 11 km from the surface. The remainder of the trip to the surface, lasting about 2.5 minutes, was handled by smaller doppler radar units and three vernier engines running on liquid fuels fed to them using pressurized helium. (The successful flight profile of Surveyor 5 was given a somewhat shortened vernier flight sequence as a result of a helium leak.) The last 3.4 meters to the surface was accomplished in free fall from zero velocity at that height, after the vernier engines were turned off. This resulted in a landing speed of about 3 m/s. The free-fall to the surface was in an attempt to avoid surface contamination by rocket blast.

Surveyor 1 required a total of about 63 hours (2.6 days) to reach the Moon, and Surveyor 5 required 65 hours (2.7 days). The launch weights (at lunar injection) of the seven Surveyors ranged from to , and their landing weights (minus fuel, jettisoned retrorocket, and radar unit) ranged from to .

== Missions ==

=== Surveyor 1 ===
Surveyor 1 was launched May 30, 1966 and sent directly into a trajectory to the Moon without any parking orbit. Its retrorockets were turned off at a height of about 3.4 meters above the lunar surface. Surveyor 1 fell freely to the surface from this height, and it landed on the lunar surface on June 2, 1966, on the &quot;Oceanus Procellarum&quot;. This location was at . This is within the northeast portion of the large crater called Flamsteed P (or the &quot;Flamsteed Ring&quot;). Flamsteed itself lies within Flamsteed P on the south side.

Surveyor 1 transmitted video data from the Moon beginning shortly after its landing through July 14, 1966, but with a period of no operations during the two-week long lunar night of June 14, 1966 through July 7, 1966. 

The return of engineering information (temperatures, etc.) from Surveyor 1 continued through January 7, 1967, with several interruptions during the lunar nights. The spacecraft returned data on the motion of the Moon, which would be used to refine the map of its orbital path around the Earth as well as better determine the distance between the two worlds.

=== Surveyor 2 ===

Surveyor 2 was launched on September 20, 1966. A mid-course correction failure resulted in the spacecraft losing control. Contact was lost with the spacecraft at 9:35 UTC, September 22.

=== Surveyor 3 ===

Launched on April 17, 1967, Surveyor 3 landed on April 20, 1967, at the Mare Cognitum portion of the Oceanus Procellarum (S3° 01&#x27; 41.43&quot; W23° 27&#x27; 29.55&quot;), in a small crater that was subsequently named Surveyor. It transmitted 6,315 TV images to the Earth, including the first images to show what planet Earth looked like from the Moon&#x27;s surface.

Surveyor 3 was the first spacecraft to unintentionally lift off from the Moon&#x27;s surface, which it did twice, due to an anomaly with Surveyor&#x27;s landing radar, which did not shut off the vernier engines but kept them firing throughout the first touchdown and after it. Surveyor 3&#x27;s TV and telemetry systems were found to have been damaged by its unplanned landings and liftoffs.

Surveyor 3 was visited by Apollo 12 astronauts Pete Conrad and Alan Bean in November 1969, and remains the only probe visited by humans on another world. The Apollo 12 astronauts excised several components of Surveyor 3, including the television camera, and returned them to Earth for study.

=== Surveyor 4 ===

Launched on July 14, 1967, Surveyor 4 crashed after an otherwise flawless mission; telemetry contact was lost 2.5 minutes before touchdown. The solid-fuel retrorocket may have exploded near the end of its scheduled burn. The planned landing target was Sinus Medii (Central Bay) at 0.4° north latitude and 1.33° west longitude.

=== Surveyor 5 ===
Surveyor 5 was launched on September 8, 1967 from Cape Canaveral. It landed on Mare Tranquillitatis on September 11, 1967. The spacecraft transmitted excellent data for all experiments from shortly after touchdown until October 18, 1967, with an interval of no transmission from September 24 to October 15, 1967, during the first lunar night. Transmissions were received until November 1, 1967, when shutdown for the second lunar night occurred. Transmissions were resumed on the third and fourth lunar days, with the final transmission occurring on December 17, 1967. A total of 19,118 images were transmitted to Earth. 

=== Surveyor 6 ===
Surveyor 6 was the first spacecraft planned to lift off from the Moon&#x27;s surface.

It was launched on November 7, 1967, and landed on November 10, 1967 in Sinus Medii (near the crash site of Surveyor 4). The successful completion of this mission satisfied the Surveyor program&#x27;s obligation to the Apollo project.

Surveyor 6&#x27;s engines were restarted and burned for 2.5 seconds in the first lunar liftoff on November 17 at 10:32 UTC. This created 150 lbf (700 N) of thrust and lifted the vehicle 12 feet (4 m) from the lunar surface. After moving west eight feet, (2.5 m) the spacecraft once again successfully soft landed and continued functioning as designed. On November 24, 1967, the spacecraft was shut down for the two-week lunar night. Contact was made on December 14, 1967, but no useful data was obtained.

=== Surveyor 7 ===
Surveyor 7 was launched on January 7, 1968, landing on the lunar surface on January 10, 1968, on the outer rim of the crater Tycho. Operations of the spacecraft began shortly after the soft landing. On January 20, while the craft was still in daylight, the TV camera clearly saw two laser beams aimed at it from the night side of the crescent Earth, one from Kitt Peak National Observatory, Tucson, Arizona, and the other at Table Mountain at Wrightwood, California.

Operations on the second lunar day occurred from February 12 to 21, 1968. The mission objectives were fully satisfied by the spacecraft operations. Battery damage was suffered during the first lunar night and transmission contact was subsequently sporadic. Contact with Surveyor 7 was lost on February 21, 1968.

== Surveyor mission list ==
Surveyor-Model were generic mass simulators, while Surveyor SD had the same structure as the real Surveyor landers with all equipment replaced by dummy weights. These served to test Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle performance, and were not intended to reach the Moon. 

Of the seven Surveyor missions, five were successful. 
== Space Race competition ==
During the time of the Surveyor missions, the United States was actively involved in the Space Race with the Soviet Union. Thus, the Surveyor 1 landing in June 1966, only four months after the Soviet Luna 9 probe landed in February, was an indication the programs were at similar stages.

<doc id="79405" wikidata="Q7312795" url="?curid=79405" title="RenderMan Interface Specification">
<text>The RenderMan Interface Specification, or RISpec in short, is an open API developed by Pixar Animation Studios to describe three-dimensional scenes and turn them into digital photorealistic images. It includes the RenderMan Shading Language.

As Pixar&#x27;s technical specification for a standard communications protocol (or interface) between modeling programs and rendering programs capable of producing photorealistic-quality images, RISpec is a similar concept to PostScript but for describing 3D scenes rather than 2D page layouts. Thus, modelling programs which understand the RenderMan Interface protocol can send data to rendering software which implements the RenderMan Interface, without caring what rendering algorithms are utilized by the latter.

The interface was first published in 1988 (version 3.0) and was designed to be sufficiently future proof to encompass advances in technology for a significant number of years. The current revision is 3.2.1, released in November 2005.

What set the RISpec apart from other standards of the time was that it allowed using high-level geometric primitives, like quadrics or bicubic patches, to specify geometric primitives implicitly, rather than relying on a modeling application to generate polygons approximating these shapes explicitly beforehand. Another novelty introduced by the RISpec at the time was the specification of a shading language.

The RenderMan shading language allows material definitions of surfaces to be described not only by adjusting a small set of parameters, but in an arbitrarily complex fashion by using a C-like programming language to write shading procedures commonly known as procedural textures and shaders. Lighting, and displacements on the surface, are also programmable using the shading language. The shading language allows each statement to be executed in a SIMD manner, but does not insist on it. Another feature that sets renderers based on the RISpec apart from many other renderers is the ability to output arbitrary variables as an image: surface normals, separate lighting passes and pretty much anything else can be output from the renderer in a single pass.

RenderMan has much in common with OpenGL (developed by the now-defunct Silicon Graphics), despite the two APIs being targeted to different sets of users (OpenGL to real-time hardware-assisted rendering and RenderMan to photorealistic off-line rendering). Both APIs take the form of a stack-based state machine with (conceptually) immediate rendering of geometric primitives. It is possible to implement either API in terms of the other.

==Required capabilities==

For a renderer to call itself &quot;RenderMan-compliant&quot;, it must implement at least the following capabilities:
*A complete hierarchical graphics state, including the attribute and transformation stacks and the active light list.
*Orthographic and perspective viewing transformations.
*Depth-based hidden-surface elimination.
*Pixel filtering and spatial anti-aliasing.
*Gamma correction and dithering before quantization.
*Output of images containing any combination of RGB, A, and Z. The resolutions of these files must be as specified by the user.
*All of the geometric primitives described in the specification, and provide all of the standard primitive variables applicable to each primitive.
*The ability to perform shading calculations through user-programmable shading
*The ability to index texture maps, environment maps, and shadow depth maps
*The fifteen standard light source, surface, volume, displacement, and imager shaders required by the specification. Any additional shaders, and any deviations from the standard shaders presented in this specification, must be documented by providing the equivalent shader expressed in the RenderMan shading language.

==Optional advanced capabilities==

Additionally, the renderer may implement any of the following optional capabilities:
* Area light sources
* Depth of field
* Displacement mapping
* Environment mapping
* Global illumination
* Level of detail
* Motion blur
* Special camera projections
* Spectral colors
* Ray tracing
* Solid modeling
* Volume shading

<text>A dryad (; , ) is an oak tree nymph or oak tree spirit in Greek mythology; &quot;Drys&quot; (δρῦς) means &quot;tree&quot;, and more specifically &quot;oak&quot; in Greek. Today the term is often used to refer to tree nymphs in general.

== Types ==
===Daphnaie===

These were nymphs of the laurel trees.

===Epimelides===

The Maliades, Meliades or Epimelides were nymphs of apple and other fruit trees and the protectors of sheep. The Greek word &quot;melas&quot;, from which their name derives, means both apple and sheep. The Hesperides, the guardians of the golden apples, were regarded as this type of dryad.

===Hamadryad===

Dryads, like all nymphs, were supernaturally long-lived and, like many, were tied to their homes, but some were a step beyond most nymphs. These were the hamadryads, who were an integral part of their trees, such that if the tree died, the hamadryad associated with it also died. For these reasons, dryads and the Greek gods punished any mortal who harmed trees without first the tree-nymphs. (associated with Oak trees)

===Meliae===

The dryads of the ash tree were called the Meliae. The Meliae sisters tended the infant Zeus in Rhea&#x27;s Cretan cave. In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Gaia gave birth to the Meliae after being made fertile by the blood of the castrated Uranus.

==Names==
Some of the individual dryads or hamadryads are:

*Atlanteia and Phoebe, two of the many wives or concubines of Danaus
*Chrysopeleia
*Dryope
*Erato
*Eurydice
*Phigalia
*Tithorea

== In popular culture ==

* Keats addresses the nightingale as &quot;light-winged Dryad of the trees&quot;, in his &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; . 
* In the poetry of Donald Davidson they illustrate the themes of tradition and the importance of the past to the present.
*In The Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis, dryads appear as inhabitants of Narnia, as do many creatures from Greek mythology. In Prince Caspian the activity of the Telmarines in felling trees and defiling streams forces the dryads and naiads – denizens of &#x27;Old Narnia&#x27; – into a deep sleep, from which they awaken when Bacchus and Silenus are summoned by Aslan to aid in the fight against King Miraz&#x27;s army.

<doc id="79409" wikidata="Q153454" url="?curid=79409" title="Diane Abbott">
<text>Diane Julie Abbott (born 27 September 1953) is a British Labour Party politician who has served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Hackney North and Stoke Newington since 1987. She served in the Shadow Cabinet of Jeremy Corbyn as Shadow Home Secretary from 2016 to 2020 and is an advisor to the Privy Council. She was the first black woman elected to parliament and is the longest-serving black MP, as well as the longest continually serving female MP since 2024, making her the Mother of the House.

Born in Paddington to a British-Jamaican family, Abbott attended Harrow County School for Girls before reading History at Newnham College, Cambridge. After working for the Civil Service, she worked as a reporter for Thames Television and TV-am before becoming a press officer for the Greater London Council. Joining the Labour Party, she was elected to Westminster City Council in 1982 and then as an MP in 1987, being re-elected in every general election since.

She was a member of the Labour Party Black Sections. Critical of Tony Blair&#x27;s New Labour project that moved the party towards the centre during the mid- to late 1990s, Abbott voted against several Blair policies, including the Iraq War and the Identity Cards Act 2006. She stood for election as Leader of the Labour Party on a left-wing platform in the 2010 leadership election, finishing in last place in a contest that was won by Ed Miliband, who appointed her Shadow Minister for Health on the Official Opposition frontbench.

A supporter of Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s bid to become Labour leader in 2015, Abbott became Shadow Secretary of State for International Development, then Shadow Secretary of State for Health, and eventually Shadow Home Secretary. A Corbyn ally, she supported his leftward push of the Labour Party. She unsuccessfully attempted to be chosen as the Labour candidate for the 2016 London mayoral election, and backed the unsuccessful Britain Stronger in Europe campaign to retain UK membership of the European Union. Following the 2019 general election, Abbott was removed from the Shadow Cabinet by Keir Starmer.

In April 2023, Abbott wrote a letter to &quot;The Observer&quot; in which she said that Jewish, Irish and Traveller people experienced prejudice but not racism and this was not the same as the racism experienced by Black people. As a result, the Labour Party withdrew the whip. The Labour Party National Executive Committee concluded its inquiry into her comments in December 2023 and issued her with a &quot;formal warning&quot;. The Labour Party restored the whip on 28 May 2024. Abbott said she had been barred from standing as a Labour Party candidate at the 2024 general election, but Starmer later said she would be &quot;free&quot; to stand as a Labour candidate.

At the general election held on 4 July 2024, Abbott retained her seat as Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington and became Mother of the House as the longest continuously serving female MP.

==Early life and career==
Diane Abbott was born on 27 September 1953 in Paddington to Jamaican parents. Her father was a welder and her mother a nurse. Both of her parents left school at the age of 14. She attended Harrow County School for Girls (a grammar school) and then Newnham College, Cambridge, where she studied history, achieving a lower second-class degree (2:2). At Cambridge, one of her supervisors was Simon Schama.

After university, Abbott became an administration trainee at the Home Office (1976 to 1978), and then a Race Relations Officer at the National Council for Civil Liberties (1978 to 1980). She was a researcher and reporter at Thames Television from 1980 to 1983, and then a researcher at the breakfast television company TV-am from 1983 to 1985. She was a press officer at the Greater London Council under Ken Livingstone from 1985 to 1986, and Head of Press and Public Relations at Lambeth Council from 1986 to 1987.

In 2024, during the Undercover Policing Inquiry into the conduct of about 139 undercover police officers who infiltrated and disrupted social justice groups, the Metropolitan Police apologised for using undercover officers to spy on anti-racism campaigners, including Abbott, during the 1980s and 1990s. Many secret police reports on Abbott were uncovered by the inquiry. Abbott criticised these activities as being racist and unjustified.

Abbott&#x27;s career in politics began in 1982 when she was elected to Westminster City Council, serving until 1986. In 1983, she was active in the Labour Party Black Sections movement, alongside Bernie Grant, Paul Boateng and Keith Vaz, campaigning for greater African Caribbean and Asian political representation. In 1985, she unsuccessfully fought to be selected in Brent East, losing out to Ken Livingstone.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1987 general election, Abbott was elected to Parliament as MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, winning with 48.7% of the vote and a majority of 7,678. She was the first black woman to become an MP.

Abbott has served on a number of parliamentary committees on social and international issues and held shadow ministerial positions in successive Shadow Cabinets. For most of the 1990s, she also served on the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons. She went on to serve on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. She gave birth to her son in October 1991, one year before the House of Commons introduced a crèche.

At the 1992 general election, Abbott was re-elected as MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington with an increased vote share of 57.8% and an increased majority of 10,727. She was again re-elected at the 1997 general election with an increased vote share of 65.2% and an increased majority of 15,627. She was again re-elected at the 2001 general election, with a decreased vote share of 61% and a decreased majority of 13,651. She was again re-elected at the 2005 general election, with a decreased vote share of 48.6% and a decreased majority of 7,427.

Abbott&#x27;s speech on civil liberties, in the debate on the Counter-Terrorism Bill 2008, won &quot;The Spectator&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Parliamentary Speech of the Year&quot; award, and further recognition at the 2008 Human Rights awards.

Abbott chairs the All-Party Parliamentary British-Caribbean Group and the All-Party Sickle Cell and Thalassemia Group. She is the founder of the London Schools and the Black Child initiative, which aims to raise educational achievement levels amongst black children.

At the 2010 general election, Abbott was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 55% and an increased majority of 14,461.

At Goldsmiths&#x27; College, on 26 October 2012, a jubilee celebration was held to honour Abbott&#x27;s 25 years in Parliament, with participants in a series of contributions including Herman Ouseley, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Kadija Sesay, Aminatta Forna, Shami Chakrabarti, SuAndi, Yvonne Brewster, Malika Booker, Zena Edwards and others.

At the 2015 general election, Abbott was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 62.9% and an increased majority of 24,008. At the snap 2017 general election, she was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 75.1% and an increased majority of 35,139.

A speech by Abbott in a House of Commons debate on the Caribbean is included in Margaret Busby&#x27;s 2019 anthology &quot;New Daughters of Africa&quot;.

At the 2019 general election, Abbott was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 70.3% and a decreased majority of 33,188.

At the 2024 general election held on 4 July, Abbott was re-elected with a vote share of 60%.

Abbott was given the symbolic title Mother of the House as the longest continuously serving female MP, delivering her first speech in that role on 9 July 2024, when she congratulated new MPs and said: &quot;It is a great job and you will never regret coming here. ... When I was a new member in 1987, there were only 40 female members of Parliament. Today we have 264, and some of us are glad that we have lived to see this. And I can&#x27;t speak about the increased numbers of female members of Parliament without referencing my predecessor Baroness Harriet Harman, who did so much to work to have an equal and diverse House.&quot; Tributes were paid to Abbott by Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle, as well as by Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

===2010 leadership election and frontbench role===
On 20 May 2010, Abbott announced her intention to stand in the Labour leadership contest. She secured the necessary 33 nominations, assisted by the withdrawal of John McDonnell and support from David Miliband and Jack Straw, among others. On 25 September 2010, Ed Miliband was announced as the new leader of the Labour Party, Abbott having been eliminated in the first round of voting after securing 7.24% of votes.

Abbott was later appointed Shadow Minister for Public Health by Ed Miliband, taking shadow responsibility for a range of issues including children&#x27;s health, maternity services, sexual health, tobacco, nursing, obesity and alcohol abuse. Following her move onto the front bench, the &quot;Telegraph&quot; said on 27 September 2011 that Abbott had &quot;become one of Labour&#x27;s best front bench performers&quot;.

On the issue of abortion, Abbott has become a vocal &quot;pro-choice&quot; supporter, opposing moves towards changing abortion counselling policy, and reducing the abortion time limit. She resigned from a cross-party group on abortion counselling, saying it was no more than a front to push forward an anti-abortion agenda without debate in parliament.

In 2011, she voted in favour of military intervention in Libya.

On 5 February 2013, following the Second Reading, Abbott voted in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill.

===Removal from the frontbench and 2015 London mayoral election===

On 8 October 2013, Abbott was sacked as Shadow Public Health Minister in a reshuffle by Labour leader Ed Miliband, and replaced by Luciana Berger. On 23 June 2014, Abbott had stated she would consider standing in the 2016 London mayoral election; on 30 November 2014, Abbott announced her intention to put herself forward to become Labour&#x27;s candidate in the election, but was unsuccessful in the 2015 nomination process.

She was one of 16 signatories of an open letter to Ed Miliband in January 2015 calling on the party to commit to oppose further austerity, take rail franchises back into public ownership and strengthen collective bargaining arrangements.

===Return to the frontbench===
A close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, Abbott was one of 36 Labour MPs to nominate him as a candidate in the Labour leadership election of 2015. Following Corbyn&#x27;s election as Labour leader, Abbott was appointed to the post of Shadow Secretary of State for International Development.

On 27 June 2016, following the resignations of many of Labour&#x27;s ministerial team in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, Abbott was promoted to the position of Shadow Health Secretary.

On 6 October 2016, following the resignation of Andy Burnham, Abbott was appointed Shadow Home Secretary. Following the Article 50 vote in February 2017, Abbott was involved in a controversy with fellow MP David Davis.

She was sworn of the Privy Council on 15 February 2017.

===2017 general election===

On 2 May 2017, during that year&#x27;s general election campaign, Labour&#x27;s pledge to recruit an extra 10,000 police officers was overshadowed by Abbott&#x27;s inability to give accurate funding figures. In an interview on LBC Radio with Nick Ferrari, she repeatedly struggled to explain how the promise would be funded. In the interview, Abbott frequently paused, shuffled her papers and gave out the wrong figures. When asked about her performance, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, insisted he was not embarrassed by what many pundits called a &quot;car crash&quot; interview.

In a further interview conducted by ITV on 5 May 2017, as the 2017 local elections results were being announced, Abbott was again unable to give accurate figures on the Labour Party&#x27;s performance suggesting that the party had a net loss of 50 seats. However, her figure was corrected by the interviewer who stated that Labour had in fact lost 125 seats, at which point Abbott said that the last figures she had seen were a net loss of around 100.

Appearing on Andrew Marr&#x27;s Sunday morning programme for the BBC on 28 May, Abbott&#x27;s apparent support for the IRA nearly 35 years ago came up, along with some parliamentary votes Marr thought questionable. These included her advocacy of the abolition of &quot;conspiratorial groups&quot; such as MI5 and Special Branch in the late 1980s, both of which she said had been successfully reformed. She defended a vote opposing the proscription of a list of groups, including al-Qaida, on the basis that some of the others had the status of dissidents in their country of origin and Abbott would have voted to ban al-Qaida in isolation. According to Sam Coates in &quot;The Times&quot;, this appearance was arranged without the consent of Labour&#x27;s campaign team.

On 5 June 2017, during a Sky News interview, Abbott was unable to answer questions about the Harris report on how to protect London from terror attacks. She insisted that she had read the report, but was unable to recall any of the 127 recommendations. When asked if she could remember the specific recommendations, Abbott said: &quot;I think it was an important review and we should act on it.&quot; Abbott also denied reports that Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell were attempting to stop her from making broadcasts. The next day, Abbott withdrew at the last minute – citing illness – from a joint interview on &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; on 6 June, in which she had been due to face her Conservative frontbench opposite number Amber Rudd. On 7 June, Corbyn announced that Abbott was &quot;not well&quot; and had stepped aside in her role as Shadow Home Secretary. Lyn Brown was temporarily assigned to replace her. Barry Gardiner said in a radio interview on LBC that Abbott had been diagnosed with having a &quot;long-term&quot; medical condition, and was &quot;coming to terms with that&quot;.

The following week it became known that Abbott had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2015. &quot;During the election campaign, everything went crazy – and the diabetes was out of control, the blood sugar was out of control&quot;, she told &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Dealing with six or seven interviews in a row became problematic because she was not eating enough food, which forced a break upon her; however, the condition is back under control. Abbott returned to the role of Shadow Home Secretary on 18 June.

=== 2017– 2023 ===
On 2 October 2019, Abbott became the first black MP at the dispatch box at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions. She served as a temporary stand-in for the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, while First Secretary of State Dominic Raab stood in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Abbott was a supporter of Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow, and defended him from bullying allegations made by David Leakey.

On 23 February 2020, Abbott said she would be standing down as Shadow Home Secretary and leaving the frontbench upon the election of a new Labour leader. She stood down on 5 April and was succeeded by Nick Thomas-Symonds.

In April 2020, she was appointed to the Home Affairs Select Committee.

In May 2021, she wrote in a &quot;Guardian&quot; article that if Labour were to lose the Batley and Spen by-election, Starmer should resign as Labour leader. She described the local elections as disappointing for Labour. Abbott criticised the shadow cabinet reshuffle later carried out by Keir Starmer. She told Sophy Ridge on Sky News that his demotion of Angela Rayner was &quot;baffling&quot;. Following the 2022 local elections, Abbott said that Keir Starmer should resign if he is fined by Durham Constabulary over Beergate.

On 24 February 2022, Abbott was one of eleven Labour MPs who signed a statement by the Stop the War Coalition criticising the UK government for &quot;sabre-rattling&quot; over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and for saying Ukraine has a right to join NATO if it wishes. The statement called on NATO to stop its &quot;eastward expansion and commit to a new security deal for Europe&quot;. All eleven MPs subsequently removed their signatures after being threatened with losing the whip.

===April 2023: Loss of Labour Party whip ===
In April 2023, Abbott wrote to &quot;The Observer&quot; in response to an article on racism faced by Irish people, Jewish people and Travellers, saying they do not experience racism as black people do. Labour withdrew the whip following its publication. Abbott withdrew her remarks, apologised and said: &quot;Racism takes many forms, and it is completely undeniable that Jewish people have suffered its monstrous effects, as have Irish people, Travellers and many others.&quot; Abbott also said the letter was an initial draft sent by mistake. According to the &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot;, the letter had been sent twice.

In September 2023, Abbott, still suspended, said that she had realised that &quot;As a Black woman, I will not get a fair hearing from this Labour leadership&quot;.

The Labour Party National Executive Committee concluded its inquiry into her comments in December 2023 and issued her with a &quot;formal warning&quot; for &quot;engaging in conduct that was, in the opinion of the NEC, prejudicial and grossly detrimental to the Labour Party&quot;. She was also directed to complete an online e-learning module, which she did in February 2024. The campaign group Momentum criticised the Labour Party and Starmer for failing to restore the whip to Abbott once she had completed the module.

=== Frank Hester ===
On 11 March 2024, &quot;The Guardian&quot; alleged that businessman and Conservative Party donor Frank Hester had said in 2019 that Abbott made him &quot;want to hate all black women&quot; and that &quot;she should be shot&quot;. Hester apologised to Abbott on X (previously Twitter) after the allegations were published, stating that his comments were &quot;rude&quot; and had &quot;nothing to do with her gender nor colour of skin&quot;. The comments led to Labour and the Liberal Democrats calling on the Conservative Party to return Hester&#x27;s £10 million donation. Abbott described Hester&#x27;s remarks as &quot;frightening&quot; and reported Hester to the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s parliamentary liaison and investigations team.

On 13 March 2024, Abbott criticised the Speaker of the House of Commons (Sir Lindsay Hoyle) after he failed to call on her to speak during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, which was dominated by the &quot;race row&quot; surrounding her. It was reported that Abbott stood up 46 times in 35 minutes to try to have her say, without success. She later criticised the Speaker, saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t know whose interests the Speaker thinks he is serving. But it is not the interests of the Commons or democracy.&quot;

=== Whip restored ===
Abbott did receive some support from Labour Party MPs. Deputy Leader of the Labour Party Angela Rayner said she hoped for Abbott to have the whip restored. On 17 March, a former deputy leader of the party, Harriet Harman, said she would be sad if Abbott&#x27;s career ended without her being readmitted to the Parliamentary Labour Party. At a rally in support of Abbott, Jeremy Corbyn criticised the Labour Party for &quot;using [Abbott&#x27;s] image and story as a way of trying to raise money for the Labour party while at the same time not recognising the injustice of her removal from the parliamentary Labour party&quot;.

The Labour Party restored the whip to Abbott on 28 May 2024. The following day Abbott said that she has been barred by the Labour Party from standing as a Labour Party candidate at the 2024 UK general election. Starmer said that no decision had yet been taken.

On 30 May, an open letter signed by many prominent Black British figures (including Lenny Henry, David Harewood, Reni Eddo-Lodge, Misan Harriman, Afua Hirsch, Jackie Kay, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Adrian Lester and Gary Younge) claimed that the Labour Party&#x27;s indecisiveness about Abbott&#x27;s future was an example &quot;of the systemic racism highlighted in the Forde report on factionalism in the Labour party commissioned by Starmer himself&quot;.

Starmer said on 31 May that Abbott would be &quot;free&quot; to stand as a Labour candidate.

On 2 June 2024, Abbott tweeted that she was now the Labour candidate for Hackney North and Stoke Newington at the general election.

At the 2024 general election held on 4 July, Abbott was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 59.5% and a decreased majority of 15,080.

==Media work==
Until her appointment as a shadow minister in October 2010, Abbott appeared alongside media personality and former Conservative politician Michael Portillo on the BBC&#x27;s weekly politics digest &quot;This Week&quot;. Abbott and Portillo have known each other since their schooldays, during which they appeared in joint school productions of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (although not in the title roles), and of &quot;Macbeth&quot; as Lady Macduff and Macduff respectively.

In August 2012, the BBC Trust ruled that payments to Abbott for her appearances on &quot;This Week&quot; were made in breach of BBC guidelines that banned payments to MPs who were representing their political parties. For her part, Abbott had correctly declared the payments in the Parliamentary Register of Members&#x27; Interests. The Trust also said that Abbott had appeared on the show too often.

Abbott is a frequent public speaker, newspaper contributor and TV performer, appearing on programmes including &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Come Dine with Me&quot; and &quot;Cash in the Celebrity Attic&quot;.

Abbott was shortlisted for the Grassroot Diplomat Initiative Award in 2015 for her work on London Schools and the Black Child, and remains in the directory of the &quot;Grassroot Diplomat Who&#x27;s Who&quot; publication.

==Political positions==
Abbott has a record of differing from some party policies, voting against the Iraq War, opposing ID cards and campaigning against the renewal of Britain&#x27;s Trident nuclear weapons.

===Abortion rights===
Abbott supported a number of amendments to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill (now Act) that favoured abortion rights (along with Katy Clark MP and John McDonnell MP) – including in 2008 leading on the NC30 Amendment of the Abortion Act 1967: Application to Northern Ireland. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Abbott argued that

It was reported that the Labour Government at the time (in particular Harriet Harman) asked MPs not to table these pro-abortion amendments (and at least until Third Reading) and then allegedly used parliamentary mechanisms in order to prevent a vote accordingly. Speaking in the debate in Parliament, Abbott criticised these &quot;manoeuvres&quot;:

===Saudi Arabia===
Abbott criticised David Cameron&#x27;s government for its continued support for Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen. In March 2016, Abbott wrote: &quot;over the past year alone, Britain has sold around £6bn worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, whose campaign in Yemen is targeting civilians – 191 such attacks have collectively been reported by the UN, HRW and Amnesty.&quot;

===European Union===
Abbott voted against the Maastricht Treaty.

Abbott campaigned and supported the Labour Party&#x27;s official preference for the remain campaign in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. In December 2016, she told Andrew Marr that Labour policy was to respect the result of the referendum.

In January 2017, Abbott stated that Labour could oppose the bill to trigger Article 50 if Labour&#x27;s amendments were rejected. She abstained from voting on the second reading of the Brexit Bill, after becoming ill hours before the vote, and later voted in favour at the third and final reading. She said she did this out of party loyalty and respect for democracy. In December 2017, Abbott did not support holding a second referendum, saying in 2018 that the UK would vote to leave again in a hypothetical poll. She supported the holding of one following the 2019 European Parliament elections. She consistently voted against the withdrawal agreement.

=== Israel and Palestine conflict ===
During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, Abbott spoke at a Free Palestine rally in London condemning the Israeli occupation of Palestine.

===Windrush scandal===
Abbott wrote to Sajid Javid demanding that he publish the figures for people caught up in the Windrush scandal, and also tell how many Commonwealth citizens lost their jobs, became homeless and were prevented from using public services. She wrote that &quot;warm words are not enough&quot;, and maintained that transparency was needed to give the Windrush generation confidence ministers have come to grips with what is 
In August 2018, Abbott complained that there were still delays in settling Windrush claims, saying: &quot;From the Windrush scandal to immigration detention, to these outrageous delays – it is long past time that the government takes responsibility for leaving people distressed and destitute.&quot;

===Comments about Mao Zedong===
In 2008, during a BBC One &quot;This Week&quot; interview between Abbott, Michael Portillo and Andrew Neil, Abbott said about the Chinese leader Mao Zedong: &quot;I suppose some people will judge that on balance Mao did more good than harm... He led his country from feudalism, he helped to defeat the Japanese and he left his country on the verge of the great economic success they are having now.&quot; She finished by saying: &quot;I was just putting the case for Mao.&quot;

===Assisted dying===

In November 2024, Abbott said she would not support Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill on assisted dying for terminally ill people. She also criticised the amount of time available for scrutiny of the bill, brought by Labour backbencher Kim Leadbeater. She co-wrote a piece in The Guardian with Father of the House Conservative MP Edward Leigh opposing the assisted suicide bill.

==Political controversies==

===Education of Abbott&#x27;s son===
Abbott&#x27;s decision in 2003 to send her son to the private City of London School after criticising colleagues for sending their children to selective schools, which she herself described as &quot;indefensible&quot; and &quot;intellectually incoherent&quot;, caused controversy and criticism.

According to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, she said: 
Her son contacted a radio phone-in to say that his mother was following his own wishes: &quot;She&#x27;s not a hypocrite, she just put what I wanted first instead of what people thought,&quot; he told LBC. He added that he had wanted to attend a private school rather than attend a local state school in Abbott&#x27;s Hackney constituency.

===Comments on race===
In 1996, Abbott was criticised after she said that &quot;blonde, blue-eyed Finnish girls&quot; were unsuitable as nurses at her local hospital because they had &quot;never met a black person before.&quot; In response, Marc Wadsworth, founder of the Anti-Racist Alliance, whose mother is Finnish, pointed out that the then-current Miss Finland, Lola Odusoga, was black, of Nigerian and Finnish descent. &quot;She&#x27;s a black Finn like me&quot;, he said. Abbott&#x27;s position was supported by fellow black Labour MP Bernie Grant: &quot;Bringing someone here from Finland who has never seen a black person before and expecting them to have some empathy with black people is nonsense. Scandinavian people don&#x27;t know black people—they probably don&#x27;t know how to take their temperature.&quot;

On 4 January 2012, Abbott tweeted: &quot;White people love playing &#x27;divide and rule&#x27;. We should not play their game.&quot; This led to widespread criticism, including accusations of racism. Abbott later apologised for &quot;any offence caused&quot;, stating that she had not intended to &quot;make generalisations about white people&quot;; she said in an interview with Andrew Neil that her tweet was referring to the history of the British Empire. The Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg called her comments a &quot;stupid and crass generalisation&quot;. Nadhim Zahawi, Conservative MP, said: &quot;This is racism. If this was a white member of Parliament saying that all black people want to do bad things to us he would have resigned within the hour or been sacked.&quot; Members of the public lodged complaints, but the Metropolitan Police stated that no investigation would be launched, and no charges would be brought against her, saying she &quot;did not commit a criminal offence.&quot;

In April 2023, as a result of a letter Abbott wrote to &quot;The Observer&quot; in which she said racism experienced by Jewish, Irish, and Traveller people was not the same as that experienced by black people, the Labour Party withdrew the whip. Abbott had written in the letter that Irish, Jewish and Traveller people &quot;undoubtedly experience prejudice&quot;, which she called &quot;similar to racism&quot;, and added &quot;it is true that many types of white people with points of difference, such as redheads, can experience this prejudice . . . but they are not all their lives subject to racism.&quot; The Board of Deputies of British Jews described the comments as &quot;disgraceful&quot; and Labour&#x27;s Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, called the comments &quot;simply unacceptable&quot;, adding: &quot;Keir Starmer has done the right thing by suspending Diane Abbott.&quot;

On 15 March 2024, Abbott strongly denied unattributed briefings in &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper that stated the Labour whip would have been restored if she had agreed to attend an antisemitism course. She called the journalism &quot;shoddy&quot; and the information &quot;false&quot;.

===IRA===
In May 2017, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that Abbott backed the IRA in a 1984 interview with &quot;Labour and Ireland&quot;, a pro-republican journal. In the 1984 interview, Abbott criticised the Unionist population of Northern Ireland as an &quot;enclave of white supremacist ideology comparable to white settlers in Zimbabwe&quot;, and called for their views to be ignored on the question of Unification, adding: &quot;Ireland is our struggle—every defeat of the British state is a victory for all of us. A defeat in Northern Ireland would be a defeat indeed.&quot;

In May 2017, while Shadow Home Secretary, she was asked by Andrew Marr whether she regretted her comments on the IRA. Abbott replied that &quot;It was 34 years ago. I&#x27;ve moved on.&quot;

===Charging a fee for a speech to University of Birmingham undergraduates===
In 2013, Abbott was criticised by University of Birmingham students after it emerged that in 2011, she charged the university £1,750 for a 50-minute speech to undergraduates. An online petition called on Abbott to repay the money to be used for educational purposes.

===Sasha Johnson tweet===
Following the shooting of Sasha Johnson on 23 May 2021, Abbott tweeted:
The tweet was criticised by a Home Office source who accused Abbott of departing from the facts and stoking racial tensions by suggesting that the shooting was racially motivated and that Johnson was targeted because of her activism. Abbott denies the claim that the tweet inflamed racial divides.

==Online abuse==
In a &quot;Guardian&quot; article in February 2017, Abbott wrote about receiving racist and sexist abuse online every day, such as threats of rape. A few days later, in an interview with Sophy Ridge on Sky News, Abbott proposed a parliamentary inquiry into the sexist and racist abuse of MPs in social media and the way Twitter and Facebook investigate cases that arise. An Amnesty International report found that Abbott was the subject of almost half of all abusive tweets about female MPs on Twitter during the 2017 election campaign, receiving ten times more abuse than any other MP.

==Personal life==
Abbott had a brief relationship with Jeremy Corbyn, who later became the Labour leader, when he was a councillor in north London in the late 1970s. She credits him with sparking her interest in party politics and joining the Labour Party. In 1991, she married David P. Ayensu-Thompson, a Ghanaian architect. They had one son, James, before divorcing in 1993. Abbott chose her Conservative MP voting pair, Jonathan Aitken, as her son&#x27;s godfather.

In 2007, Abbott began learning the piano under the tutelage of Paul Roberts, Professor of Piano at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, for the BBC documentary television programme &quot;Play It Again&quot;. She performed Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Prelude No. 4 in E minor before an audience.

In 2015, Abbott was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

In July 2019, Abbott called 999 after being &quot;chased around her home&quot; by her son, James Abbott-Thompson. In relation to this incident, as well as subsequent incidents away from Abbott&#x27;s home, Abbott-Thompson later pleaded guilty to 12 assaults and racially aggravated criminal damage and exposing himself and was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order.

In September 2020, an authorised biography of Diane Abbott was released, &quot;Diane Abbott: The Authorised Biography&quot;, by Robin Bunce and Samara Linton, published by Biteback. In 2020, Abbott was invited to participate in the television dance contest show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. Speaking on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme, she said that she refused the invitation, pausing only &quot;for about sixty seconds&quot;. She said that, instead, she will continue to do what she has done all of her life, speaking up on human rights, civil liberties, women&#x27;s rights, and representing the people of Hackney.

On 12 March 2024, after allegations that she had been targeted by racist remarks from a Conservative Party donor, Abbott issued a statement saying that &quot;as a single woman&quot; she felt &quot;vulnerable&quot; in her constituency.

Extracts from Abbott&#x27;s memoir &quot;A Woman Like Me&quot; were published in September 2024 in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, where she &quot;opens up about three pivotal moments in her life in politics&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, Catreus or Katreus (, ; ) was the eldest son of Minos and Pasiphaë, and Minos&#x27; successor as king of Crete. Catreus had one son, Althaemenes, and three daughters, Apemosyne, Aerope and Clymene. Catreus was mistakenly killed by his son Althaemenes thereby fulfilling an oracle&#x27;s prophecy.

== Mythology ==

According to Apollodorus&#x27; account, an oracle told Catreus that one of his children would kill him. Although Catreus kept the prophecy secret, his son Althaemenes found out, and fearing that he would be the one to kill his father, took his sister Apemosyne and left Crete for Rhodes. Catreus gave his other daughters to Nauplius to be sold off in foreign lands, and Aerope married Pleisthenes (or Atreus), but Nauplius kept Clymene for himself as wife. Years later, as an old man Catreus sailed the seas searching for his son, so that he could pass on his kingship to him. His ship stopped at Rhodes and was mistaken by some cowherds for a pirate ship. Catreus tried to explain who he was, but could not be heard above the barking of the cowherds&#x27; dogs. Althaemenes arrived and killed his father with his javelin, thus fulfilling the prophecy. When Althaemenes realized what he had done, Althaemenes prayed and was swallowed up by a chasm in the ground.

Diodorus Siculus, gives a slightly different version of the story, saying that an oracle had been given to Althaemenes which said that he was destined to kill his father. Another tradition involving Catreus&#x27; daughter Aerope, followed by Euripides in his lost play &quot;Kressai&quot;, and possibly by Sophocles in his play &quot;Ajax&quot;, was that Catreus found Aerope in bed with a slave and sent her to Nauplius to be drowned.

Catreus, an ancient Cretan city mentioned by the second-century Greek geographer Pausanias, was apparently supposed by the Cretans to have been founded by Catreus. According to Apollodorus, Catreus&#x27; grandson Menelaus (Aerope&#x27;s son) was away in Crete, presiding at Catreus&#x27; funeral, when Paris took Helen to Troy.

== Parallel story ==
The story of Catreus shares similarities with stories told about Aleus, king of Tegea. In these stories, Aleus received an oracle that his grandson would kill Aleus&#x27; sons, so Aleus took measures to keep his daughter Auge a virgin, nevertheless Auge became pregnant (by Heracles) and Aleus (as did Catreus) gives his daughter to Nauplius, to be drowned but instead Nauplius sold her to the Mysian king Tethras, who adopts her son Telephus, as his heir. As an adult Telephus returns to Tegea and unknowingly kills his uncles.

<text>In Greek mythology, Apemosyne (Ancient Greek: ) was a Cretan princess as the daughter of King Catreus of Crete, the son of Minos. She had a brother Althaemenes, and two sisters, Aerope and Clymene.

== Mythology ==
Apemosyne was mentioned in the account of Apollodorus. According to Apollodorus, Catreus received an oracle saying that he would be killed by one of his children, and although Catreus hid the oracles, his son Althaemenes found out. Fearing that he would be the one to kill Catreus, Althaemenes took Apemosyne and fled with her to Rhodes.

There, Hermes fell in love with Apemosyne, but Apemosyne fled from him. Hermes could not catch her, because she ran faster than him. On her way back from a spring, Apemosyne slipped on freshly skinned hides that Hermes had laid across her path. Hermes then caught and raped her. Later, when Apemosyne told her brother what had happened, he became angry, thinking that she was lying about being molested by the god. In his anger, he kicked her to death.

== Interpretation ==
Arthur Bernard Cook, saw in the myth of Apemosyne an historical element reflecting the relationship between Minoan Crete and Rhodes, as well as a possible etiological aspect explaining an ancient Rhodian custom involving human sacrifice.

<text>In Greek mythology, Althaemenes or Althemenes (Ancient Greek: Ἀλθαιμένης) was a Cretan prince as the only son of King Catreus of Crete. He was the brother of Apemosyne, Aerope and Clymene. Althaemenes mistakenly killed his father thereby fulfilling an oracle.

== Mythology ==
Althaemenes is known through the accounts of Diodorus Siculus and Apollodorus. According to the first of these, Althaemenes received an oracle saying that he was destined to kill his father. So to avoid this fate, Althaemenes, with many followers, fled Crete for Rhodes, and established on Mount Atabyrus (modern Attavyros) an altar to Zeus Atabyrius. Years later, Catreus sailed the seas searching for his son, and heir to his throne. One night, his ship stopped at Rhodes, fighting arose, and Althaemenes, unknowingly killed Catreus with his spear. When Althaemenes discovered what he had done, he wandered from place to place, and eventually died from grief. After which, commanded by an oracle, the Rhodians honored him as a hero.

Apollodorus relates a similar story. In his account, Catreus received an oracle saying that he would be killed by one of his children. And although Catreus hid the oracles, Althaemenes found out and fled with his sister Apemosyne to Rhodes. There Apemosyne was raped by the god Hermes, but when Apemosyne told Althaemenes this, Althaemenes did not believe her and kicked Apemosyne to death. Catreus having set to sea in search of Althaemenes, landed at Rhodes, and his company being mistaken for pirates were attacked and as before Althaemenes unknowingly killed his father. In this telling, when Althaemenes realized what had happened he prayed to the gods and fell into a chasm.

<text>Katherine Patricia Irene Adams, Baroness Adams of Craigielea (born 27 December 1947) is a Scottish Labour peer who served as the Member of Parliament for Paisley North from 1990 to 2005.

==Early life==
Adams was educated at Stanley Green High School in Paisley, marrying Allen Adams in February 1968 with whom she had three children. In 1970 she was on Paisley Town Council and by 1972 was appointed Justice of the Peace. In 1974, as Katherine Adams, she became a councillor for Stanley Ward of Renfrew District Council, but failed to be reelected in 1977 following a general collapse in the Labour vote. In 1979, she stood for and won the Paisley Craigielea seat on Strathclyde Regional Council succeeding her husband, Allen Adams, who had stepped down from the council following his election as MP. She successfully stood for reelection in 1982, retiring in 1986.

==Parliamentary career==
Her husband, Allen Adams, had been MP for Paisley North until his death on 5 September 1990 at the age of 44 from a brain haemorrhage. Irene, who had served as his secretary during his time as MP, stood in the subsequent by-election and despite a swing to the SNP, went on to win with 44% of the vote. She successfully defended the seat in the next three General Elections.

As an MP, she had been outspoken on the issue of drug abuse and gang violence and received death threats. Media sources speculated that the 1999 torching of her car was as a result of this work. Despite being loyal to the Labour government of the day, Adams was seen as clearly on its left wing including being against the Iraq war, a Eurosceptic and one of the more pro-devolution Scottish Labour members. Within the Labour party, it was alleged that she had been the target of &quot;bad mouthing&quot; by fellow Labour MP Tommy Graham, which lead to Graham&#x27;s expulsion from the party in 1999.

Adams was persuaded to stand down with the promise of a peerage, in order to allow sitting West Renfrewshire MP Jim Sheridan to be selected to fight in the May 2005 election for the newly merged seat of Paisley and Renfrewshire North. Following the General Election, on 13 May 2005 it was announced that she would be created a life peer as Baroness Adams of Craigielea, of Craigielea in the County of Renfrewshire, on 28 June.

===Peerage and expenses===
Despite no longer being a member of the House of Commons, Adams along with 13 other MPs was the subject of a court case over the release of information into parliamentary expenses. As a result of the widespread expenses scandal within parliament, she was ultimately asked pay over £50,000 which she initially refused to do.

Adams is not noted for being an active member of the House of Lords, and attracted criticism for claiming expenses despite having only made a single contribution, her maiden speech, between May 2005 and October 2010. She currently lives in a converted mill in Paisley.

<doc id="79416" wikidata="Q500739" url="?curid=79416" title="Cecrops I">
<text>Cecrops (; ; , ) was a legendary king of Attica which derived from him its name Cecropia, according to the Parian Chronicle having previously borne the name of Acte or Actice (from Actaeus). He was the founder and the first king of Athens itself though preceded in the region by the earth-born king Actaeus of Attica. Cecrops was a culture hero, teaching the Athenians marriage, reading and writing, and ceremonial burial.

== Etymology and form ==
According to Strabo, the name of Cecrops is not of Greek origin. It was said that he was born from the earth itself (an autochthon) and was accordingly called a γηγενής (&quot;gēgenḗs&quot; &quot;native&quot;), and described as having his top half shaped like a man and the bottom half in serpent or fish-tail form. Hence he was called διφυής (&quot;diphuḗs&quot;, &quot;of two natures&quot;). Diodorus rationalized that his double form was because of his double citizenship, Greek and barbarian. Some ancients referred the epithet διφυής to marriage, of which tradition made him the founder.

== Family ==
Apparently Cecrops married Aglaurus, the daughter of Actaeus, former king of the region of Attica, whom he succeeded on the throne. It is disputed that this woman was the mother of Cecrops&#x27;s son Erysichthon. Erysichthon predeceased him, and he was succeeded by Cranaus, who is said to have been one of the wealthiest citizens of Athens at that time. 

Cecrops was the father of three daughters: Herse, Pandrosus and Aglaurus. To them was given a box or jar containing the infant Erichthonius to guard unseen. They looked and, terrified by the two serpents Athena had set within to guard the child, they fled in terror and leapt from the Acropolis to their deaths. Some accounts say one of the sisters was turned to stone instead.

==Mythology==
=== Culture hero ===
Cecrops was represented in the Attic legends as the author of the first elements of civilized life such as marriage, the political division of Attica into twelve communities, and also as the introducer of a new mode of worship. He was said to have been the first who deified Zeus, and ordained sacrifices to be offered to him as the supreme Deity. Cecrops was likewise affirmed to have been the first who built altars and statues of the gods, offered sacrifices, and instituted marriage among the Athenians, who, before his time, it seems, lived promiscuously. Pausanias tells us that he forbade the sacrificing of any living creatures to the gods, as well as any sort of other offering, only allowing cakes (πέλανοι) formed into the shape of an ox with horns, called by the Athenians Pelanous, which signifies an ox. He is likewise said to have taught his subjects the art of navigation; and, for the better administration of justice and intercourse among them, to have divided them into the four tribes called Cecropis, Autochthon, Actea, and Paralia. Some likewise make him the founder of the areopagus.

The Acropolis was also known as the Cecropia in his honor. The Athenians are said to have called themselves Cecropidæ, during the reigns of the five following kings, in his honor.

=== Patronage of Athens ===
During his reign which lasted for 50 years, the gods resolved to take possession of cities in which each of them should receive their own peculiar worship. Athena became the patron goddess of the city of Athens in a competition with Poseidon, as judged by Cecrops. The two raced ferociously towards the Acropolis and it was a very close race. Poseidon was the first to reach Attica and struck the acropolis with his trident and thereby created a salt sea which was known in later times by the name of the Erechthean well, from its being enclosed in the temple of Erechtheus. After him, Athena arrived and called on Cecrops to witness her act of taking possession. She planted an olive tree on the hill of the acropolis, which continued to be shown in the Pandrosium down to the latest times. But when the two gods continued to strive for possession of the country, Zeus parted them and appointed arbiters - not, as some have affirmed, Cecrops and Cranaus, nor Erysichthon, but the twelve gods. And in accordance with their verdict the country was adjudged to Athena, because Cecrops bore witness that she had been the first to plant the olive. Athena, therefore, called the city Athens after herself. Poseidon in hot anger flooded the Thriasian plain and laid Attica under the sea.

A rationalistic explanation of the fable was propounded by the eminent Roman antiquary Varro. According to him, the olive-tree suddenly appeared in Attica, and at the same time there was an eruption of water in another part of the country. So king Cecrops sent to inquire of Apollo at Delphi what these portents might signify. The oracle answered that the olive and the water were the symbols of Athena and Poseidon respectively, and that the people of Attica were free to choose which of these deities they would worship. Accordingly, the question was submitted to a general assembly of the citizens and citizenesses; for in these days women had the vote as well as men. All the men voted for the god, and all the women voted for the goddess; and as there was one more woman than there were men, the goddess appeared at the head of the poll. Chagrined at the loss of the election, Poseidon flooded the country with the water of the sea, and to appease his wrath it was decided to deprive women of the vote and to forbid children to bear their mother&#x27;s names for the future.

The Athenians said that the contest between Poseidon and Athena took place on the second of the month Boedromion, and hence they omitted that day from the calendar.


== Multiple Cecrops ==
The name of Cecrops occurs also in other parts of Greece, especially where there existed a town named Athenae, such as in Boeotia, where he is said to have founded the ancient towns of Athenae and Eleusis on the Triton River, and where he had a heroön at Haliartus. Tradition there called him a son of Pandion. In Euboea, which also had a town named Athenae, Cecrops was called a son of Erechtheus and Praxithea, and a grandson of Pandion. From these traditions it appears, that Cecrops must be regarded as a hero of the Pelasgian race; and Müller remarks that the different mythical personages of this name connected with the towns in Boeotia and Euboea are only multiplications of the one original hero, whose name and story were transplanted from Attica to other places. The later Greek writers describe Cecrops as having immigrated into Greece with a band of colonists from Sais in Egypt. But this account is not only rejected by some of the ancients themselves and modern critics.

<text>Cecropia is a Neotropical genus consisting of 61 recognized species with a highly distinctive lineage of dioecious trees. 
The genus consists of pioneer trees in the more or less humid parts of the Neotropics, with the majority of the species being myrmecophytic. Berg and Rosselli state that the genus is characterized by some unusual traits: spathes fully enclosing the flower-bearing parts of the inflorescences until anthesis, patches of dense indumentums (trichilia) producing Mullerian (food) at the base of the petiole, and anthers becoming detached at anthesis. &quot;Cecropia&quot; is most studied for its ecological role and association with ants. Its classification is controversial; in the past, it has been placed in the Cecropiaceae, Moraceae (the mulberry family), or Urticaceae (the nettle family). The modern Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system places the &quot;cecropiacean&quot; group in the Urticaceae.

The genus is native to the American tropics, where it is one of the most recognizable components of the rainforest. The genus is named after Cecrops I, the mythical first king of Athens. Common local names in Venezuela include yarumo or yagrumo, or more specifically &quot;yagrumo hembra&quot; (&quot;female &quot;yagrumo&quot;&quot;) to distinguish them from the similar-looking but unrelated &quot;Didymopanax&quot; (which are called &quot;yagrumo macho&quot;, &quot;male &quot;yagrumo&quot;&quot;). In English, these trees are occasionally called pumpwoods (though this may also refer to &quot;C. schreberiana&quot; specifically) or simply &quot;Cecropias&quot;. Spanish-speaking countries in Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean, Colombia, Ecuador commonly use the vernacular name, &quot;guarumo&quot;.

==Taxonomic history==
&quot;Cecropia&quot; was first recognized and accounted for by Marcgrave (1648) and Piso (1658), the latter including an illustration with characteristic features. Loefling (1758) coined the generic name &quot;Cecropia&quot;. In 1759, Linnaeus described &quot;Cecropia peltata&quot; which he applied to many species. Willdenow (1806) created &quot;C. palmate&quot;, which was also applied to a various species. Over the next decade, additional species were added by Bertoloni (1840), Martius (1841), and Liebmann (1851). Mixing of specimens was very common and a problem arose, which continues today, with many collections of &quot;Cecropia&quot;. Many species were also described by Hemsley (1883), Richter (1897), Donnell Smith (1899), Rusby (1907, 1910), Huber (1910), Robinson (1912), Pittier (1917), Bailey (1922), and the most extensive number by Snethlage (1923, 1924). Additional species were recognized by Burret (1924), Mildbread (1925, 1933), Standly (1929, 1940), Macbride (1937), Diels (1941), Standley &amp; Steyermark (1944), and Stadley &amp; Williems (1952).

Hans Melchior (1964) placed &quot;Cecropia&quot; in the Urticales and Moraceae (Concephaleideae) because of its woody bark. Later based on the floral characters, most notably the basal ovule and gynoecium, which appears to be formed from a single carpel, Thorne (1976) moved it to the Malvanae- Urticales, family Urticaceae. Berg (1978), however, placed it in its own family Cecropiaceae. When phylogenetic data became available, &quot;Cecropia&quot; was then moved back into the Urticaceae.

==Description==
The genus is easily identified by its large, circular, palmately lobed leaves, about 30–40 cm in diameter and deeply divided into 7–11 lobes. The trees consist of very few branches, usually with candelabrum-like branching system. In Costa Rica, three-toed sloths are often spotted easily in &quot;Cecropia&quot; trees because of their open, leafless branches compared to other trees. Berg and Roselli state, “Branch development is often initiated in seedlings, even in the axils of the first formed (opposite) leaves; prophylls are formed, and often the development of the first leaf begins but is arrested (if the seedling is not decapitated). In the axils of the leaves formed during later development, the axillary branch primordia do not produce more than one or two prophylls and a bud.” The branches of &quot;C. garciae&quot; and &quot;C. hispidissima&quot; occur at a height of 0.6 to 1 m and the branches depart at acute angles. In most species of &quot;Cecropia&quot;, the branches depart at obtuse angles and the crown has a distinct umbrella shape.

High variation is seen in the morphology of &quot;Cecropia&quot; species, but most form small to medium-sized trees, 5–15 m tall. Although some species (&quot;C. distachya&quot;, &quot;C. herthae&quot;, &quot;C. insignis&quot;, and &quot;C. sciadophylla&quot;) grow much taller, as large as 40 m, and some (&quot;C. ulei&quot;) rarely surpass 5 m. The high degree of variation can be attributed to regional habitat differences and longevity. 
The family Cecropiaceae is characterized by having adventitious roots, and in &quot;Cecropia&quot;, they become stilt-roots, which are a common feature of large trees, especially living near rivers or marshes. &quot;Cecropia&quot; spp. are usually full of vines, but not normally overgrown by them. Most species have internodes that are hollow and contain whitish pith. These internodes provide a nesting area for the &quot;Azteca&quot; ants that inhabit the trees.

When the branches are cut, they release a watery, often mucilaginous sap, which turns black when it is exposed to the air. To prevent inhabitation by ants and occupation and damage by herbivorous insect larvae, the terminal buds and upper internodes are filled with mucilage. Several species&#x27; leafy twigs are covered by a waxy layer, making them bluish.

Berg and Rosselli describe in detail six types of trichomes that can be recognized on &quot;Cecropia&quot; and more information on each can be found in their paper. They are: thick unicellular hairs, thin unicellular hairs, pluricellular trichomes, cystolith hairs, pearl glands (or pearl bodies), and Müllerian bodies.

Parts of the &quot;Cecropia&quot; such as the stipules, the spathes, and the main veins of the lamina have red-coloring substances. The concentration of the substances varies, even within species, and some parts can be green, bluish, pale pink, dark red, dark purple, and even blackish. The color may fade with age, and can be deposited equally or in patterns such as longitudinal stripes.

The leaves of adult &quot;Cecropia&quot; species are large and peltate, almost circular in circumference. The lamina is attached to the petiole, the venation is radiate, and the lamina is radially incised between the radiating main veins. Variation is high in the number of lobes or leaf segments, ranging from five to more than 20.

===Similar species===
&quot;Pourouma bicolor&quot; is very similar in appearance to the &quot;Cecropia&quot;, with its umbrella-shaped leaves, stilt roots, large leaves with wide lobes, and whitish color on the underside. The distinctions between the two, however, are: the petiole attaches at the base of the leaf rather than at the center of the leaf like &quot;Cecropia&quot; and &quot;Pourouma&quot; has leaf lobes that are triangular and pointed at the tip, whereas most &quot;Cecropia&quot; are rounded.

==Habitat and distribution==
Between 40 and 50% of the 61 species of &quot;Cecropia&quot; are montane or submontane Andean, with the majority of species in the northern part of the Andes, in Colombia and Ecuador. The Andean region is regarded as the center of species richness and speciation because of the additional 25% of lowland taxa that reach the eastern or western foothills of the Andes. Therefore, only about 25% of the species occur outside of the Andean region. A map of the distribution of &quot;Cecropia&quot; can be found in the article written by Berg and Rosselli, 2005. Most species of &quot;Cecropia&quot; are lowland humid/rainforest species occurring from sea level to 1,300 m in altitude, while submontane species occupy an altitudinal range from 1,300-2,000 m, and montane species are found in cloud forest from 2,000-2,600 m. Many species have a narrow altitudinal and ecological niche, with certain species specializing in specific habitats, such as seasonally inundated habitats, rocky slopes, swamps, natural or man-made clearings, etc.

Species in the genus &quot;Cecropia&quot; are some of the most abundant pioneer tree species in natural tree-fall gaps inside primary forests. Its geographic distribution extends along the Pacific and Atlantic Mexican coasts and in Central and South American forests, and are found over an elevation range of 0 to 2,600 m. &quot;Cecropia&quot; species are among the most abundant pioneers of other neotropical forests. It is native to the Neotropics and occurs as an introduced exotic plant elsewhere. In most low-elevation, wet regions of the Neotropics, &quot;Cecropia&quot; trees are ubiquitous and important invaders of man-made clearings.

The species &quot;C. pachystachya&quot; and &quot;C. peltata&quot; are invasive species in Old World localities including Singapore, Cameroon, Java, Malaysia, Ivory Coast, French Polynesia, and Hawaii. &quot;C. peltata&quot; has been nominated as one of the “100 of the World’s Worst Invasive Alien Species” by the Global Invasive Species Database. &quot;C. peltata&quot; was introduced to the Singapore Botanic Gardens in 1902 and has spread widely throughout Singapore along with &quot;C. pachystachya&quot;, which was introduced in the 1960s. The species is successful as an invasive species because of its ability to pollinate without the need for pollinators, the possible preferential liking for its fruits by frugivorous birds, and its lack of natural predators.

==Reproduction==
&quot;Cecropia&quot; species have staminate and pistillate flowers on separate trees, more commonly referred to as a dioecious species. The fruits are achenes enveloped by a fleshy perianths, oblongoid, elliptic, subobovoid or subovoid. The pericarp is tuberculate in most species, although it is smooth in some species. Seeds can be viable for more than five years and germinate when triggered by full sunlight and changing temperatures. Full-grown &quot;Cecropia&quot; trees can produce up to a million seeds, and this regular presence of fruits allows this genus to play a major role in the ecosystem. It is often the keystone food supply for frugivorous animals, such as birds, fruit bats, monkeys, opossums, and even fish.

===Pollination and dispersal===
Traits of the staminate flowers and inflorescences are adapted to wind pollination- either by pendulous spikes, which can be moved by the wind to shed the pollen or by the special adaptation of detachment of anthers, and their secondary attachment allowing the shedding of pollen by motion of anthers. The dryness and its easy release by movement make it ideal for wind pollination. Wind pollination is the dominant form, but insects, small beetles, and flies can be pollinators. In the Neotropics, toucans and other birds help disperse the seeds of species with short infructescences, while bats are associated with species with long peduncles and spikes. Species growing near rivers, though, are usually dispersed by water.

==Conservation==
&quot;Cecropia&quot; spp. are generally not endangered; so no major conservation efforts are in place. Their abundance increases temporarily with the clearing of forest or creation of gaps.

==Ecology==
&quot;Cecropia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the arctiid moth &quot;Hypercompe icasia&quot;; the Cecropia moth (&quot;Hyalophora cecropia&quot;) is a North American species, however, thus allopatric with the plant genus. The leaves and buds are also eaten by sloths as their main source of food, but many herbivores avoid these plants; most &quot;Cecropia&quot; spp. are myrmecophytes, housing dolichoderine ants of the genus &quot;Azteca&quot;, which vigorously defend their host plants against getting eaten. This symbiosis has been studied extensively by biologists such as Daniel Janzen.

&quot;Cecropia&quot; fruit, known as snake fingers, are a popular food of diverse animals, including bats like the common fruit bat (&quot;Artibeus jamaicensis&quot;) and &quot;short-tailed fruit bat&quot;, the Central American squirrel monkey (&quot;Saimiri oerstedii&quot;), and birds such as the green aracari (&quot;Pteroglossus viridis&quot;), the keel-billed toucan (&quot;Ramphastos sulfuratus&quot;), the peach-fronted conure (&quot;Eupsittula aurea&quot;), the bare-throated bellbird (&quot;Procnias nudicollis&quot;) and particularly nine-primaried oscines. The seeds are not normally digested, so these animals are important in distributing the trees.
Some birds – e.g. the common potoo (&quot;Nyctibius griseus&quot;) – nest in &quot;Cecropia&quot; trees. The elfin-woods warbler (&quot;Setophaga angelae&quot;) is notable for using &quot;Cecropia&quot; leaves as nesting material, which no other New World warbler (family Parulidae) seems to do.

===Pioneer species===
&quot;Cecropia&quot; is a major pioneer tree genus in regions of the Neotropics with wet lowland and montane forest. These trees are characteristic features of many American tropical rainforest ecosystems and may be among the dominant tree species in some places. Being aggressive, rapid-growth trees, whose succulent fruits are readily sought by various animals, they tend to be among the first pioneer species to occupy former forest areas cleared for pasture or altered by human activity. &quot;C. hololeuca&quot;, known in Brazil as &quot;silver cecropia&quot;, has broad, silver-hued leaves that make it desirable as an ornamental plant for landscaping projects, as is the case with the similar species &quot;C. pachystachya&quot;. Greenhouse experiments have been performed with some species of &quot;Cecropia&quot; indicating them as “gap” and “pioneer” species under different light regimens and nutrient treatments. Some species (&quot;C. maxima&quot;, &quot;C. tacuna&quot;, &quot;C. teleabla&quot;, and &quot;C. telenitida&quot;) do not show the traits of pioneer species, though, as they occur evenly in the forest. The pioneer &quot;Cecropia&quot; species have a higher demand for light, occur in open habitats, relatively rapid growth rates, and short-lived leaves. According to McKey&#x27;s theory, these pioneer species tend to invest more heavily in pearl bodies and less heavily in Mullerian bodies than more shade-tolerant species with slower intrinsic growth rates and longer leaf lifespans. In the small light gaps (which are more shaded than normal), the most distinctive myrmecophytic &quot;Cecropia&quot; spp, are found.

===Myrmecophytism===
Species of &quot;Cecropia&quot; often display myrmecophytism as a form of biotic defense. D.W. Davidson said,
:“In all the world, the genus &quot;Cecropia&quot; is unrivaled for the number of myrmecophytes, or true “ant-plants” counted among its species. Based on the proportion of &quot;Cecropia&quot; species producing Mullerian bodies in at least some parts of their distribution, myrmecophytes comprise the vast majority (80%) of species in the genus; most nonmyrmecophytes occur at higher elevations and on islands, where their ants are missing.” (Berg, Rosselli and Davidson, 2005: page 214) 

Myrmecophytism is a mutualistic relationship formed with ant colonies, where the ants protect the tree from herbivory and the trees provide shelter and food for the ants. Along with protection against herbivory, the ants also prevent the &quot;Cecropia&quot; from encroaching vines and other plants. This may vary between or within species and over geographical locations. The main ants found living in &quot;Cecropia&quot; are different species of &quot;Azteca&quot; ants, although all ants belong to the same family, the Formicidae. The genus &quot;Azteca&quot; is endemic to the New World and its greatest abundance is in the lowland tropics. In the article written by Davidson, 2005 on page 221, Table 1 contains known obligate Cecropia-ants listed by species and geographic distribution. Ants and &quot;Cecropia&quot; have coadapted to each other, meaning that each species has evolved one or more traits in response to selective pressures exerted by the other. An example is the recognition and use of both prostomata and Mullerian bodies by queens and worker ants.

==Use==
The wood from &quot;Cecropia&quot; trees is used by local people mainly to make musical instruments and tool handles. Flutes and guitars are commonly made of &quot;Cecropia&quot; wood. In addition, the wood is used for production of matches and cheap boxes. An attempt was made to use the wood to produce paper, but the wood pulp was too high in resin and it was not suitable. The fibers of the bark can be twisted into rope and the ropes are manufactured for bowstrings and hammocks. The leaves can also be burned and the ashes mixed in with roasted and powdered coca leaves to be placed between the cheek and gum under the tongue as “dip”.

The main human use of &quot;Cecropia&quot; trees is planting them in soil erosion-prone areas. The trees make few demands on the soil and grow very quickly. The trees are used in clear-cut areas because they retain the soil, create new biomass, and allow other types of plants to settle in the area. Berg and Rosselli stated that decoctions of leaves are made to stimulate the cardiac system, to treat asthma and pneumonia, to treat diabetes and as a diuretic. Powder of leaves is used for control of Parkinson&#x27;s disease and extract of roots is used to heal wounds or eczema.

Red &quot;Cecropia&quot; (&quot;C. glaziovii&quot;) shows antidepressant-like activity in rats. Native peoples use &quot;Cecropia&quot; for food, firewood, and in herbalism; some species also have cultural significance. In Trinidad and Tobago, &quot;C. peltata&quot; root is chewed and given to dogs that have been bitten by venomous snakes as an emergency remedy (although there is no strong scientific evidence that this is useful). &quot;Cecropia&quot; leaves can be used as a substitute for sandpaper. In western South America, &quot;Cecropia&quot; leaf ash is used in the traditional preparation of &quot;ypadu&quot;, a mild coca-based stimulant. &quot;Cecropia&quot; bark can be used in rope making and in tannery. &quot;Cecropia&quot; wood is used in the manufacture of boxes, toys, aeromodeling models, and rafts.

==Pharmaceutical applications==
So far, no pharmaceuticals in the North or South American markets are based on &quot;Cecropia&quot; species. However, scientists in Brazil have been studying the preparation of pharmaceutical products containing mainly &quot;C. glaziovii&quot; extracts. The preparation of pellets by extrusion-spheronization and polymeric nanoparticles has been reported.

<doc id="79418" wikidata="Q2470563" url="?curid=79418" title="Cedalion">
<text>In Greek mythology, Cedalion or Kedalion (Classical Greek Κηδαλίων) was a servant of Hephaestus in Lemnos. According to one tradition, he was Hephaestus&#x27;s tutor, with whom Hera fostered her son on Naxos to teach him smithcraft. Kerenyi compares him to the Cabeiri, to Chiron, and to Prometheus.

== Mythology ==
The more common story of Cedalion tells of his part in the healing of Orion, who came to Lemnos after he was blinded by Oenopion. Orion took up Cedalion and set the youth upon his shoulders for a guide to the East. There, the rays of Helios restored Orion&#x27;s sight.

Sophocles wrote a satyr play &quot;Cedalion&quot;, of which a few words survive. Its plot is uncertain, whether the blinding of Orion by Oenopion and the satyrs on Chios, probably with Cedalion offstage and prophesied, or the recovery of Orion&#x27;s sight on Lemnos. It has also been suggested that the subject may be Hephaestus&#x27;s fostering; or the instructions given to the blinded Orion by satyrs in Cedalion&#x27;s service. One of the surviving lines suggests extreme drunkenness; Burkert reads this fragment as from a chorus of Cabeiri.

One traditional etymology is from &quot;kēdeuein&quot; &quot;to take charge, to care for&quot;, and early nineteenth century scholars agreed. Scholars since Wilamowitz, however, support the other traditional interpretation, as &quot;phallos&quot;, from a different sense of the same verb: &quot;to marry&quot; (said of the groom).

Wilamowitz speculates that Cedalion is the dwarf in the Louvre relief showing Dionysius in Hephaestus&#x27; workplace.

<text>&quot;&quot; () is the national anthem of Tanzania. It is a Swahili language version of Enoch Sontonga&#x27;s Xhosa language hymn &quot;&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word in Swahili means God and its title, therefore, translates as &quot;God bless Africa&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Mungu ibariki Afrika&quot; was translated and became the state anthem of Tanganyika. It was essentially assigned to Enoch Sontonga, who died in 1905. &quot;Mungu ibariki Afrika&quot; used the tune to &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; with a Swahili translation of the words. It is not known who composed the lyrics, but it is known that it was Samuel Mqhayi and Enoch Sontonga who created the early versions used by the African National Congress.

===Swahili translation===
It was first performed in Swahili at a ceremony on 8 December 1961 following the independence of Tanganyika from the British Empire. &quot;Mungu ibariki Afrika&quot; was composed to replace the British national anthem, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, as the national anthem of Tanganyika. This made Tanganyika the first African nation to adopt the tune of &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; as its national anthem. In 1964, Tanganyika formed a union with Zanzibar, which created the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar (later renamed to Tanzania). The newly united country adopted &quot;Mungu ibariki Afrika&quot; as its national anthem instead of Zanzibar&#x27;s anthem. Tanzania&#x27;s use of &quot;Mungu ibariki Afrika&quot; led the way for other African countries such as Zimbabwe; Ciskei and Transkei adopted &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; Afrika&quot;, in parts, as their national anthems. South Africa, where the song comes from, uses only some of the words, Zambia uses only the tune and other countries have now abandoned its use. &quot;Mungu ibariki Afrika&quot; was inspired by the African National Congress&#x27;s (ANC) use of &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; (&quot;God Bless Africa&quot;) as its party song after its use at Ohlange High School. The ANC party anthem led to &quot;Mungu ibariki Afrika&quot; being selected as the national anthem of Tanzania. &quot;Mungu ibariki Afrika&quot; is also used as a hymn requesting Tanzania remain united and independent.

Tanganyika, and later Tanzania, had concerns about religious unrest between Christians and Muslims after independence. This was because of Christian references in government proceedings and official oaths. The wording of &quot;Mungu ibariki Afrika&quot; was intended to help offset this by being inclusive of the different religious views.

&quot;Mungu ibariki Afrika&quot; is sung daily at Tanzanian schools. A circular issued in 1998 by the nation&#x27;s Commissioner of Education recommended the singing of the national anthem as a way to promote patriotism in Tanzania&#x27;s youth.

In 2007, a legal issue arose over the anthem, after students who were members of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses refused to sing the song at their primary and secondary schools in Mbozi District, Mbeya Region. Five students were expelled from school, and 122 others received other forms of discipline for their refusal. They objected to singing the anthem because they believed it suggested obeisance to the flag of Tanzania before God. On 2 December 2010, the High Court of Tanzania ruled that the schools&#x27; disciplinary actions were appropriate. The Court of Appeal of Tanzania overturned that ruling on 12 July 2013, indicating that the disciplinary action taken by the school was unlawful and stating that there was no obligation to sing the national anthem in Tanzanian law.

<doc id="79422" wikidata="Q329761" url="?curid=79422" title="Emperor Jomei">
<text>was the 34th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Jomei&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 629 through 641.

==Traditional narrative==
Before Jomei&#x27;s ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was or . As emperor, his name would have been &quot;Okinagatarashihi Hironuka Sumeramikoto&quot; (息長足日広額天皇).

He was a grandson of Emperor Bidatsu, both paternally and maternally. His father was Prince Oshisakanohikohito-no-Ōe, his mother was Princess Nukate-hime, who was a younger sister of his father.

==Events in Jomei&#x27;s reign==
He succeeded his great aunt, Empress Suiko. Suiko did not make it clear who was to succeed her after her death. Before her death in 629, she called Tamura and Prince Shōtoku&#x27;s son, Prince Yamashiro-no-Ōe, and gave some brief advice to each of them. After her death the court was divided into two factions, each supporting one of the princes for the throne. Soga no Emishi, the head of Soga clan, supported Tamura. He claimed that Empress Suiko&#x27;s last words suggested her desire that Tamura succeed her to the throne. Scholars then construed that the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by Tamura. Shortly thereafter, he is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;) as Emperor Jomei. Prince Yamashiro-no-Ōe was later attacked by the Soga clan and committed suicide along with his entire family.

Jomei&#x27;s contemporary title would not have been &quot;tennō&quot;, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably &quot;Sumeramikoto&quot; (written the same way as &quot;tennō&quot;: 天皇) or &quot;Amenoshita Shiroshimesu Ōkimi&quot; (治天下大王), meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;. Alternatively, Jomei might have been referred to as (ヤマト大王/大君) or the &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;.

During Emperor Jomei&#x27;s reign, Soga no Emishi seized several political initiatives. After Jomei&#x27;s death, the throne was passed to his wife and niece, Empress Kōgyoku, and then to her younger brother, Emperor Kōtoku, before eventually being inherited by two of his sons, Emperor Tenji and Emperor Tenmu.

Emperor Jomei&#x27;s reign lasted 13 years. In the 13th year of his reign (舒明天皇十三年), he died at the age of 49.

=== Grave ===
The actual site of Jomei&#x27;s grave is known. The emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) located in Sakurai, Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Jomei&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Osaka no uchi no misasagi&quot;.

It is commonly called . It is an . It is identified as the tomb of Emperor Jomei by the Imperial Household Agency and of the same form as the . and of his wife Empress Kōgyoku buried in Kengoshizuka Kofun.

===Poetry===
The &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; includes poems attributed to emperors and empresses, including &quot;Climbing Kagu-yama and looking upon the land&quot;, which is said to have been composed by Emperor Jomei:
:::Countless are the mountains in Yamato,
::: But perfect is the heavenly hill of Kagu;
:::When I climb it and survey my realm,
:::Over the wide plain the smoke-wreaths rise and rise,
:::Over the wide lake the gulls are on the wing;
:::A beautiful land it is, the land of Yamato!
:::::: – Emperor Jomei

<text>In Greek mythology, Deucalion (; ) was the son of Prometheus; ancient sources name his mother as Clymene, Hesione, or Pronoia. He is closely connected with a flood myth in Greek mythology.

== Etymology ==
According to folk etymology, Deucalion&#x27;s name comes from , &quot;deukos&quot;, a variant of , &quot;gleucos&quot;, i.e. &quot;sweet new wine, must, sweetness&quot; and from , &quot;haliéus&quot;, i.e. &quot;sailor, seaman, fisher&quot;. His wife Pyrrha&#x27;s name derives from the adjective , -ά, -όν, &quot;pyrrhós, -á, -ón&quot;, i.e. &quot;flame-colored, orange&quot;.

== Family ==
Of Deucalion&#x27;s birth, the &quot;Argonautica&quot; (from the 3rd century BC) stated:

According to &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, Deucalion and Pyrrha had at least two children, Hellen and Protogenea, and possibly a third, Amphictyon. Another account, adds a daughter Melanthea to the list of the couple’s progeny. This daughter, also called Melantho, became the mother of Delphus by Poseidon.

Deucalion’s and Pyrrha’s children are apparently named in one of the oldest texts, &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, include daughters Pandora and Thyia, and at least one son, Hellen. Their descendants were said to have dwelt and ruled in Thessaly.

One source mentioned three sons of Deucalion and his wife: Orestheus, Marathonios and Pronous (father of Hellen). Lastly, Deucalion sired a son, no mention of the mother, Candybus who gave his name to the town of Candyba in Lycia. 







== Mythology ==
=== Deluge accounts ===
The flood in the time of Deucalion was caused by the anger of Zeus, ignited by the hubris of Lycaon and his sons, descendants of Pelasgus. According to this story, King Lycaon of Arcadia had sacrificed a boy to Zeus, who, appalled by this offering, decided to put an end to the &quot;Bronze&quot; Age by unleashing a deluge. During this catastrophic flood, the rivers ran in torrents and the sea flooded the coastal plain, engulfing the foothills with spray, and washing everything clean.

Deucalion, with the aid of his father Prometheus, was saved from this deluge by building a chest. Like the biblical Noah and the Mesopotamian counterpart Utnapishtim, he used this device to survive the great flood with his wife, Pyrrha.

The most complete accounts are given by Ovid, in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (late 1 BCE to early 1 CE), and by the mythographer Apollodorus (1st or 2nd century CE). Deucalion, who reigned over the region of Phthia, had been forewarned of the flood by his father Prometheus. Deucalion was to build a chest and provision it carefully (no animals are rescued in this version of the flood myth), so that when the waters receded after nine days, he and his wife Pyrrha, daughter of Epimetheus, were the one surviving pair of humans. Their chest touched solid ground on Mount Parnassus, or Mount Etna in Sicily, or Mount Athos in Chalkidiki, or Mount Othrys in Thessaly.

Hyginus mentioned the opinion of a Hegesianax that Deucalion is to be identified with Aquarius, &quot;because during his reign such quantities of water poured from the sky that the great Flood resulted.&quot;

Once the deluge was over and the couple had given thanks to Zeus, Deucalion (said in several of the sources to have been aged 82 at the time) consulted an oracle of Themis about how to repopulate the earth. He was told to &quot;cover your head and throw the bones of your mother behind your shoulder&quot;. Deucalion and Pyrrha understood that &quot;mother&quot; was Gaia, the mother of all living things, and the &quot;bones&quot; to be rocks. They threw the rocks behind their shoulders and the stones formed people. Pyrrha&#x27;s became women; Deucalion&#x27;s became men. These people were later called the Leleges who populated Locris. This can be related to Pindar&#x27;s account that recounted &quot;Pyrrha and Deucalion came down from Parnassus and made their first home, and without the marriage-bed they founded a unified race of stone offspring, and the stones gave the people their name.&quot;

The 2nd-century AD writer Lucian gave an account of the Greek Deucalion in &quot;De Dea Syria&quot; that seems to refer more to the Near Eastern flood legends: in his version, Deucalion (whom he also calls &quot;Sisythus&quot;) took his children, their wives, and pairs of animals with him on the ark, and later built a great temple in Manbij (northern Syria), on the site of the chasm that received all the waters; he further describes how pilgrims brought vessels of sea water to this place twice a year, from as far as Arabia and Mesopotamia, to commemorate this event.

=== Variant stories ===
On the other hand, Dionysius of Halicarnassus stated Deucalion&#x27;s parents to be Prometheus and Clymene, daughter of Oceanus, and mentioned nothing about a flood but instead named him as commander of those from Parnassus who drove the &quot;sixth generation&quot; of Pelasgians from Thessaly.

One of the earliest Greek historians, Hecataeus of Miletus, was said to have written a book about Deucalion, but it no longer survived. The only extant fragment of his to mention Deucalion does not mention the flood either, but named him as the father of Orestheus, king of Aetolia. The much later geographer Pausanias, following on this tradition, named Deucalion as a king of Ozolian Locris and father of Orestheus.

Plutarch mentioned a legend that Deucalion and Pyrrha had settled in Dodona, Epirus; while Strabo asserted that they lived at Cynus, and that her grave was still to be found there, while his may be seen at Athens. This can be related to an account that after the deluge, Deucalion, founder and king of Lycoreia in Mt. Parnassus was said to have fled from his kingdom to Athens with his sons Hellen and Amphictyon during the reign of King Cranaus. Shortly thereafter, Deucalion died there and was said to have been buried near Athens. During his stay in there, he was credited with having built the ancient sanctuary of Olympian Zeus. Additionally, Strabo mentioned a pair of Aegean islands named after the couple.

== Interpretation ==

=== Mosaic accretions ===
The 19th-century classicist John Lemprière, in &quot;Bibliotheca Classica&quot;, argued that as the story had been re-told in later versions, it accumulated details from the stories of Noah: &quot;Thus Apollodorus gives Deucalion a great chest as a means of safety; Plutarch speaks of the pigeons by which he sought to find out whether the waters had receded; and Lucian of the animals of every kind which he had taken with him. &amp;c.&quot; However, the Epic of Gilgamesh contains each of the three elements identified by Lemprière: a means of safety (in the form of instructions to build a boat), sending forth birds to test whether the waters had receded, and stowing animals of every kind on the boat. These facts were unknown to Lemprière because the Assyrian cuneiform tablets containing the Gilgamesh Epic were not discovered until in the 1850s. This was 20 years after Lemprière had published his &quot;Bibliotheca Classica&quot;. The Gilgamesh epic is widely considered to be at least as old as Genesis, if not older. Given the prevalence of religious syncretism in the ancient Greek world, these three elements may already have been known to some Greek-speaking peoples in popular oral variations of the flood myth, long before they were recorded in writing. The most immediate source of these three particular elements in the later Greek versions is unclear.

=== Dating by early scholars ===
For some time during the Middle Ages, many European Christian scholars continued to accept Greek mythical history at face value, thus asserting that Deucalion&#x27;s flood was a regional flood, that occurred a few centuries later than the global one survived by Noah&#x27;s family. On the basis of the archaeological &quot;stele&quot; known as the Parian Chronicle, Deucalion&#x27;s Flood was usually fixed as occurring some time around 1528 BC. Deucalion&#x27;s flood may be dated in the chronology of Saint Jerome to 1460 BC. According to Augustine of Hippo (&quot;City of God&quot; XVIII,8,10,&amp;11), Deucalion and his father Prometheus were contemporaries of Moses. According to Clement of Alexandria in his Stromata, &quot;in the time of Crotopus occurred the burning of Phaethon, and the deluges of Deucalion.&quot;

<text>In Greek mythology, Pyrrha (; ) was the daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora and wife of Deucalion of whom she had three sons, Hellen, Amphictyon, Orestheus; and three daughters Protogeneia, Pandora and Thyia. According to some accounts, Hellen or Helmetheus was credited to be born from Pyrrha&#x27;s union with Zeus.

== Etymology ==
In Latin, the word &quot;pyrrhus&quot; means red from the Greek adjective πυρρός, &quot;purrhos&quot;, meaning &quot;flame coloured&quot;, or simply &quot;red&quot;, referring in particular to people with red hair, as Pyrrha is described by both Horace and Ovid.

== Mythology ==

When Zeus decided to end the Bronze Age with the great deluge, Pyrrha and her husband, Deucalion, were the only survivors. Even though he was imprisoned, Prometheus who could see the future and had foreseen the coming of this flood, told his son, Deucalion, to build an ark and, thus, they survived. During the flood, they landed on Mount Parnassus, the only place spared by the flood.

Once the deluge was over and the couple were on land again, Deucalion consulted the oracle of Themis about how to repopulate the earth. He was told to throw the bones of his mother behind his shoulder. Deucalion and Pyrrha understood the &quot;mother&quot; to be Gaia, the mother of all living things, and the &quot;bones&quot; to be rocks. They threw the rocks behind their shoulders, which soon began to lose their hardness and change form. Their mass grew greater, and the beginnings of human form emerged. The parts that were soft and moist became skin, the veins of the rock became people&#x27;s veins, and the hardest parts of the rocks became bones. The stones thrown by Pyrrha became women; those thrown by Deucalion became men.

The story of Deucalion and Pyrrha is also retold in the Roman poet Ovid&#x27;s famous collection &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. In this retelling, Jove (the Roman equivalent of Zeus) takes pity on the couple, recognizing them to be devout worshipers. He parts the clouds and ends the deluge specifically to save Deucalion and Pyrrha, who are floating aimlessly on a raft. When the storm has cleared and the waters have subsided, Deucalion and Pyrrha are taken aback by the desolate wreckage of the land, and understand that they are now responsible for repopulating the earth. Confused on how to carry out their destiny, they go to see the goddess Themis. Themis tells Pyrrha that she must cast the bones of her mother to successfully reproduce. Pyrrha is distraught at the idea of desecrating her mother&#x27;s honor by digging up her bones, but Deucalion correctly reasons that Themis is referring to great mother earth, as Themis would never advise someone to commit a crime. Both Pyrrha and Deucalion throw a stone over their shoulder – Pyrrha&#x27;s turning into a woman, Deucalion&#x27;s turning into a man.

Once the land has been repopulated with humans, mother earth follows suit and begins to produce all other forms of life. Ovid uses this opportunity to inform his audience that heat and water are the sources of all life, &quot;because when heat and moisture blend in due balance, they conceive: these two, these are the origin of everything. Though fire and water fight, humidity and warmth create all things; that harmony&quot;.

<text>Domestic technology is the incorporation of applied science into the home. There are multiple aspects of domestic technology. On one level, there are home appliances, home automation and other devices commonly used in the home, such as clothes dryers and washing machines.

On another level, domestic technology recognizes the use of applied science to construct homes to achieve a particular goal, such as energy efficiency or self-sufficiency. For more information, read about self-sufficient homes. It has been claimed that domestic technology has led to decreases in the time people spend on household work, although the factual basis of this claim is disputed.

== Types of domestic technology ==

Many technologies are now routinely used around the home. For example, microwave ovens and washing machines, among others.

== Home automation ==
In the 21st century, especially by the 2010s, home automation has increasingly been introduced into the modern household, colloquially referred to as smart home technology.

While the technology was already in development in the 1990s, only in the next two decades was local area networking ubiquitous in the home, thanks to the introduction of computer networking.

Since modern home networks often make use of wireless networking (e.g. Wi-Fi), modern automation can easily be set up without having to run wires through the building. Alternatively, they can be connected to wired networks.

=== Types of home automation ===
* Smart home appliances
* Automatic vacuum cleaners and other Domestic robots
* Smart locks
* Smart speakers, with voice controlled digital personal assistants.

=== Concerns towards home automation ===

Unlike older forms of domestic technology, smart appliances are Internet-facing, and there have been many concerns that cyberattacks may be conducted on insecure home appliances. A kind of attack is to deploy malware on smart home appliances known as botnets, which can be controlled by a remote attacker.

<text>Will, within philosophy, is a faculty of the mind. Will is important as one of the parts of the mind, along with reason and understanding. It is considered central to the field of ethics because of its role in enabling deliberate action.

A recurring question in Western philosophical tradition is about free willand the related, but more general notion of fatewhich asks how the will can truly be free if a person&#x27;s actions have either natural or divine causes determining them. In turn, this is directly connected to discussions on the nature of freedom and to the problem of evil.

==Classical philosophy==
The classical treatment of the ethical importance of will is to be found in the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; of Aristotle, in Books III (chapters 1–5), and Book VII (chapters 1–10). These discussions have been a major influence in the development of ethical and legal thinking in Western civilization.

In Book III Aristotle divided actions into three categories instead of two:
* Voluntary (&quot;ekousion&quot;) acts.
* Involuntary or unwilling (&quot;akousion&quot;) acts, which are in the simplest case where people do not praise or blame. In such cases a person does not choose the wrong thing, for example if the wind carries a person off, or if a person has a wrong understanding of the particular facts of a situation. Note that ignorance of what aims are good and bad, such as people of bad character always have, is not something people typically excuse as ignorance in this sense. &quot;Acting on account of ignorance seems different from acting while being ignorant&quot;.
* &quot;Non-voluntary&quot; or &quot;non willing&quot; actions (&quot;ouk ekousion&quot;) which are bad actions done by choice, or more generally (as in the case of animals and children when desire or spirit causes an action) whenever &quot;the source of the moving of the parts that are instrumental in such actions is in oneself&quot; and anything &quot;up to oneself either to do or not&quot;. However, these actions are not taken because they are preferred in their own right, but rather because all options available are worse.

It is concerning this third class of actions that there is doubt about whether they should be praised or blamed or condoned in different cases.

Virtue and vice, according to Aristotle, are &quot;up to us&quot;. This means that although no one is willingly unhappy, vice by definition always involves actions which were decided upon willingly. Vice comes from bad habits and aiming at the wrong things, not deliberately aiming to be unhappy. The vices then, are voluntary just as the virtues are. He states that people would have to be unconscious not to realize the importance of allowing themselves to live badly, and he dismisses any idea that different people have different innate visions of what is good.

In Book VII, Aristotle discusses self-mastery, or the difference between what people decide to do, and what they actually do. For Aristotle, &quot;akrasia&quot;, &quot;unrestraint&quot;, is distinct from animal-like behavior because it is specific to humans and involves conscious rational thinking about what to do, even though the conclusions of this thinking are not put into practice. When someone behaves in a purely animal-like way, then for better or worse they are not acting based upon any conscious choice.

Aristotle also addresses a few questions raised earlier, on the basis of what he has explained:
* Not everyone who stands firm on the basis of a rational and even correct decision has self-mastery. Stubborn people are actually more like a person without self-mastery, because they are partly led by the pleasure coming from victory.
* Not everyone who fails to stand firm on the basis of his best deliberations has a true lack of self mastery. As an example he gives the case of Neoptolemus (in Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Philoctetes&quot;) refusing to lie despite being part of a plan he agreed with.
* A person with practical wisdom (&quot;phronesis&quot;) can not have &quot;akrasia&quot;. Instead it might sometimes seem so, because mere cleverness can sometimes recite words which might make them sound wise, like an actor or a drunk person reciting poetry. A person lacking self-mastery can have knowledge, but not an active knowledge to which they are paying attention. For example, when someone is in a state such as being drunk or enraged, people may have knowledge, and even show that they have that knowledge, like an actor, but not be using it.

==Medieval-European philosophy==
Inspired by Islamic philosophers Avicenna and Averroes, Aristotelian philosophy became part of a standard approach to all legal and ethical discussion in Europe by the time of Thomas Aquinas His philosophy can be seen as a synthesis of Aristotle and early Christian doctrine as formulated by Boethius and Augustine of Hippo, although sources such as Maimonides and Plato and the aforementioned Muslim scholars are also cited.

With the use of Scholasticism, Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; makes a structured treatment of the concept of will. A very simple representation of this treatment may look like this:

* Does the will desire nothing? (&quot;No.&quot;)
* Does it desire all things of necessity, whatever it desires? (&quot;No.&quot;)
* Is it a higher power than the intellect? (&quot;No.&quot;)
* Does the will move the intellect? (&quot;Yes.&quot;)
* Is the will divided into irascible and concupiscible? (&quot;No.&quot;)

This is related to the following points on free will:

* Does man have free-will? (&quot;Yes.&quot;)
* What is free-will—a power, an act, or a habit? (&quot;A power.&quot;)
* If it is a power, is it appetitive or cognitive? (&quot;Appetitive.&quot;)
* If it is appetitive, is it the same power as the will, or distinct? (&quot;The same&quot;, with contingencies).

==Early-modern philosophy==
The use of English in philosophical publications began in the early modern period, and therefore the English word &quot;will&quot; became a term used in philosophical discussion. During this same period, Scholasticism, which had largely been a Latin language movement, was heavily criticized. Both Francis Bacon and René Descartes described the human intellect or understanding as something which needed to be considered limited, and needing the help of a methodical and skeptical approach to learning about nature. Bacon emphasized the importance of analyzing experience in an organized way, for example experimentation, while Descartes, seeing the success of Galileo in using mathematics in physics, emphasized the role of methodical reasoning as in mathematics and geometry. Descartes specifically said that error comes about because the will is not limited to judging things which the understanding is limited to, and described the possibility of such judging or choosing things ignorantly, without understanding them, as free will. Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius, considered the freedom of human will is to work toward individual salvation and constrictions occur due to the work of passion that a person holds. Augustine calls will as &quot;the mother and guardian of all virtues&quot;.

Under the influence of Bacon and Descartes, Thomas Hobbes made one of the first attempts to systematically analyze ethical and political matters in a modern way. He defined will in his &quot;Leviathan&quot; Chapter VI, in words which explicitly criticize the medieval scholastic definitions:
In deliberation, the last appetite, or aversion, immediately adhering to the action, or to the omission thereof, is that we call the will; the act, not the faculty, of willing. And beasts that have deliberation, must necessarily also have will. The definition of the will, given commonly by the Schools, that it is a rational appetite, is not good. For if it were, then could there be no voluntary act against reason. For a voluntary act is that, which proceedeth from the will, and no other. But if instead of a rational appetite, we shall say an appetite resulting from a precedent deliberation, then the definition is the same that I have given here. Will therefore is the last appetite in deliberating. And though we say in common discourse, a man had a will once to do a thing, that nevertheless he forbore to do; yet that is properly but an inclination, which makes no action voluntary; because the action depends not of it, but of the last inclination, or appetite. For if the intervenient appetites, make any action voluntary; then by the same reason all intervenient aversions, should make the same action involuntary; and so one and the same action, should be both voluntary and involuntary.

By this it is manifest, that not only actions that have their beginning from covetousness, ambition, lust, or other appetites to the thing propounded; but also those that have their beginning from aversion, or fear of those consequences that follow the omission, are voluntary actions.

Concerning &quot;free will&quot;, most early modern philosophers, including Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke and Hume believed that the term was frequently used in a wrong or illogical sense, and that the philosophical problems concerning any difference between &quot;will&quot; and &quot;free will&quot; are due to verbal confusion (because all will is free):

a FREEMAN, &quot;is he, that in those things, which by his strength and wit he is able to do, is not hindered to do what he has a will to&quot;. But when the words &quot;free&quot;, and &quot;liberty&quot;, are applied to any thing but bodies, they are abused; for that which is not subject to motion, is not subject to impediment: and therefore, when it is said, for example, the way is free, no liberty of the way is signified, but of those that walk in it without stop. And when we say a gift is free, there is not meant any liberty of the gift, but of the giver, that was not bound by any law or covenant to give it. So when we &quot;speak freely&quot;, it is not the liberty of voice, or pronunciation, but of the man, whom no law hath obliged to speak otherwise than he did. Lastly, from the use of the word &quot;free-will&quot;, no liberty can be inferred of the will, desire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to do..&quot;

Spinoza argues that seemingly &quot;free&quot; actions aren&#x27;t actually free, or that the entire concept is a because &quot;internal&quot; beliefs are necessarily caused by earlier external events. The appearance of the internal is a mistake rooted in ignorance of causes, not in an actual volition, and therefore the will is always determined. Spinoza also rejects teleology, and suggests that the causal nature along with an originary orientation of the universe is everything we encounter.

Some generations later, David Hume made a very similar point to Hobbes in other words:

But to proceed in this reconciling project with regard to the question of liberty and necessity; the most contentious question of metaphysics, the most contentious science; it will not require many words to prove, that all mankind have ever agreed in the doctrine of liberty as well as in that of necessity, and that the whole dispute, in this respect also, has been hitherto merely verbal. For what is meant by liberty, when applied to voluntary actions? We cannot surely mean that actions have so little connexion with motives, inclinations, and circumstances, that one does not follow with a certain degree of uniformity from the other, and that one affords no inference by which we can conclude the existence of the other. For these are plain and acknowledged matters of fact. By liberty, then, we can only mean a &quot;power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the will&quot;; that is, if we choose to remain at rest, we may; if we choose to move, we also may. Now this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains. Here, then, is no subject of dispute.

==Rousseau==
Jean-Jacques Rousseau added a new type of will to those discussed by philosophers, which he called the &quot;General will&quot; (&quot;volonté générale&quot;). This concept developed from Rousseau&#x27;s considerations on the social contract theory of Hobbes, and describes the shared will of a whole citizenry, whose agreement is understood to exist in discussions about the legitimacy of governments and laws.

The general will consists of a group of people who believe they are in unison, for which they have one will that is concerned with their collective well-being. In this group, people maintain their autonomy to think and act for themselves—to much concern of libertarians, including &quot;John Locke, David Hume, Adam Smith, and Immanuel Kant,&quot; who proclaim an emphasis of individuality and a separation between &quot;public and private spheres of life.&quot; Nonetheless, they also think on behalf of the community of which they are a part.

This group creates the social compact, that is supposed to voice cooperation, interdependence, and reciprocal activity. As a result of the general will being expressed in the social contract, the citizens of the community that composes the general will consent to all laws, even those that they disagree with, or are meant to punish them if they disobey the law—the aim of the general will is to guide all of them in social and political life. This, in other words, makes the general will consistent amongst the members of the state, implying that every single one of them have citizenship and have freedom as long as they are consenting to a set of norms and beliefs that promote equality, the common welfare, and lack servitude.

According to Thompson, the general will has three rules that have to be obeyed in order for the general will to function as intended: (1) the rule of equality—no unequal duties are to be placed upon any other community member for one&#x27;s personal benefit or for that of the community; (2) the rule of generality—the general will&#x27;s end must be applicable to the likewise needs of citizens, and all the members&#x27; interests are to be accounted for; (3) the rule of non-servitude—no one has to relinquish themselves to any other member of the community, corporation, or individual, nor do they have to be subordinate to the mentioned community&#x27;s, corporation&#x27;s, or individuals&#x27; interests or wills.

Nonetheless, there are ways in which the general will can fail, as Rousseau mentioned in &quot;The Social Contract&quot;. If the will does not produce a consensus amongst a majority of its members, but has a minority consensus instead, then liberty is not feasible. Also, the general will is weakened consequent to altruistic interests becoming egoistical, which manifests into debates, further prompting the citizenry to not participate in government, and bills directed for egotistical interests get ratified as &quot;&#x27;laws.&#x27;&quot; This leads into the distinction between the &quot;will of all&quot; versus the &quot;general will&quot;: the former is looking after the interests of oneself or that of a certain faction, whereas the latter is looking out for the interests of society as a whole.

Although Rousseau believes that the general will is beneficial, there are those in the libertarian camp who assert that the will of the individual trumps that of the whole. For instance, G.W.F Hegel criticized Rousseau&#x27;s general will, in that it could lead to tension. This tension, in Hegel&#x27;s view is that between the general will and the subjective particularity of the individual. Here is the problem: when one consents to the general will, then individuality is lost as a result of one having to be able to consent to things on behalf of the populace, but, paradoxically, when the general will is in action, impartiality is lost as a result of the general will conforming to one course of action alone, that consented to by the populace.

Another problem that Hegel puts forth is one of arbitrary contingency. For Hegel, the problem is called &quot;&quot;the difference that action implies,&#x27;&quot; in which a doer&#x27;s description of an action varies from that of others, and the question arises, &quot;Who [chooses] which [action] description is appropriate?&quot; To Rousseau, the majority is where the general will resides, but to Hegel that is arbitrary. Hegel&#x27;s solution is to find universality in society&#x27;s institutions—this implies that a decision, a rule, etc. must be understandable and the reasoning behind it cannot rest on the majority rules over the minority alone. Universality in societies&#x27; institutions is found via reflecting on historical progress and that the general will at present is a part of the development from history in its continuation and improvement. In terms of the general will, universality from looking at historical development can allow the participants composing the general will to determine how they fit into the scheme of being in an equal community with others, while not allowing themselves to obey an arbitrary force. The people of the general will see themselves as superior to their antecedents who have or have not done what they are doing, and judge themselves in retrospect of what has happened in the course of occurrences in the present in order to from an equal community with others that is not ruled arbitrarily.

Besides Hegel, another philosopher who differed in the Rousseauian idea of the general will was John Locke. Locke, though a social contractarian, believed that individualism was crucial for society, inspired by reading Cicero&#x27;s &quot;On Duties&quot;, in which Cicero proclaimed that all people &quot;desire preeminence and are consequently reluctant to subject themselves to others.&quot; Also, Cicero mentioned how every person is unique in a special way; therefore, people should &quot;accept and tolerate these differences, treating all with consideration and upholding the [dignity]... of each.&quot; In addition, Locke was inspired by Cicero&#x27;s idea of rationally pursuing one&#x27;s self-interest, from his book &quot;On Duties.&quot; Locke wrote how people have a duty to maximize their personal good while not harming that of their neighbor. For Locke, another influence was Sir Francis Bacon. Locke started to believe, and then spread, the ideas of &quot;freedom of thought and expression&quot; and having &quot;a... questioning attitude towards authority&quot; one is under and opinions one receives because of Sir Francis Bacon.

For Locke, land, money, and labor were important parts of his political ideas. Land was the source of all other products that people conceived as property. Because there is land, money can cause property to have a varying value, and labor starts. To Locke, labor is an extension of a person because the laborer used his body and hands in crafting the object, which him- or herself has a right to only, barring others from having the same. Nonetheless, land is not possessed by the owner one-hundred percent of the time. This is a result of a &quot;fundamental law of nature, the preservation of society...takes precedence over self-preservation.&quot;

In Locke&#x27;s &quot;Second Treatise,&quot; the purpose of government was to protect its citizens&#x27; &quot;life, liberty, and property-- these he conceived as people&#x27;s natural rights. He conceived a legislature as the top sector in power, which would be beholden to the people, that had means of enforcing against transgressors of its laws, and for law to be discretionary when it did not clarify, all for the common good. As a part of his political philosophy, Locke believed in consent for governmental rule at the &quot;individual&quot; level, similar to Rousseau, as long as it served the common good, in obedience with the law and natural law. Furthermore, Locke advocated for freedom of expression and thought and religious toleration as a result of that allowing for commerce and economy to prosper. In other words, Locke believed in the common good of society, but there are also certain natural rights that a government is bound to protect, in the course of maintaining law and order-- these were the mentioned: life, liberty, and property.&quot;

==Kant==

Immanuel Kant&#x27;s theory of the will consists of the will being guided subjectively by maxims and objectively via laws. The former, maxims, are precepts. On the other hand, laws are objective, apprehended &quot;a priori&quot;—prior to experience. In other words, Kant&#x27;s belief in the &quot;a priori&quot; proposes that the will is subject to a before-experience practical law—this is, according to Kant in the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot;, when the law is seen as &quot;valid for the will of every rational being&quot;, which is also termed as &quot;universal laws&quot;

Nonetheless, there is a hierarchy of what covers a person individually versus a group of people. Specifically, laws determine the will to conform to the maxims before experience is had on behalf of the subject in question. Maxims, as mentioned, only deal with what one subjectively considers.

This hierarchy exists as a result of a universal law constituted of multi-faceted parts from various individuals (people&#x27;s maxims) not being feasible.

Because of the guidance by the universal law that guides maxims, an individual&#x27;s will is free. Kant&#x27;s theory of the will does not advocate for determinism on the ground that the laws of nature on which determinism is based prompts for an individual to have only one course of action—whatever nature&#x27;s prior causes trigger an individual to do. On the other hand, Kant&#x27;s categorical imperative provides &quot;objective &quot;oughts&quot;&quot;, which exert influence over us &quot;a priori&quot; if we have the power to accept or defy them. Nonetheless, if we do not have the opportunity to decide between the right and the wrong option in regard to the universal law, in the course of which our will is free, then natural causes have led us to one decision without any alternative options.

There are some objections posited against Kant&#x27;s view. For instance, in Kohl&#x27;s essay &quot;Kant on Determinism and the Categorical Imperative&quot;, there is the question about the imperfect will, if one&#x27;s will compels them to obey the universal law, but not for &quot;recognizing the law&#x27;s force of reason.&quot; To this, Kant would describe the agent&#x27;s will as &quot;impotent rather than... imperfect since... the right reasons cannot [compel] her to act.&quot;
Besides the objections in Kohl&#x27;s essay, John Stuart Mill had another version of the will, as written in his &quot;Utilitarianism&quot; book. John Stuart Mill, as his ethical theory runs, proposes the will operates in the same fashion, that is following the greatest happiness principle: actions are morally right as long as they advocate for happiness and morally wrong if they advocate for pain The will is demonstrated when someone executes their goals without pleasure from incentivizing their contemplation or the end of fulfilling them, and he or she continues to act according to his or her goals, even if the emotions one had felt in the beginning of fulfilling their goals has decreased over time, whether it be from changes in their personality or desires, or their goals become counterbalanced by the pains of trying to fulfill them. Also, John Stuart Mill mentioned that the process of using one&#x27;s will can become unnoticeable. This is a consequence of habit making volition—the act &quot;of choosing or determining&quot;—second nature. Sometimes, using the will, according to Mill, becomes so habitual that it opposes any deliberate contemplation of one&#x27;s options. This, he believes, is commonplace among those who have sinister, harmful habits.

Although the will can seem to become second nature because of habit, that is not always the case since the habit is changeable to the will, and the &quot;will is [changeable] to habit.&quot; This could happen when one wills away from habit what he or she no longer desires for their self, or one could desire from willing to desire something. In the case of someone who does not have a virtuous will, Mill recommends to make that individual &quot;&quot;desire&quot; virtue&quot;. In this, Mill means desiring virtue because of the pleasure it brings over the pain that not having it would bring, in accordance with the greatest happiness principle: actions are morally right as long as they advocate for happiness and morally wrong if they advocate for pain. Then, one has to routinely &quot;will what is right&quot; in order to make their will instrumental in achieving more pleasure than pain.

==Schopenhauer==
Schopenhauer disagreed with Kant&#x27;s critics and stated that it is absurd to assume that phenomena have no basis. Schopenhauer proposed that we cannot know the thing in itself as though it is a cause of phenomena. Instead, he said that we can know it by knowing our own body, which is the only thing that we can know at the same time as both a phenomenon and a thing in itself.

When we become conscious of ourself, we realize that our essential qualities are endless urging, craving, striving, wanting, and desiring. These are characteristics of that which we call our will. Schopenhauer affirmed that we can legitimately think that all other phenomena are also essentially and basically will. According to him, will &quot;is the innermost essence, the kernel, of every particular thing and also of the whole. It appears in every blindly acting force of nature, and also in the deliberate conduct of man...&quot; Schopenhauer said that his predecessors mistakenly thought that the will depends on knowledge. According to him, though, the will is primary and uses knowledge in order to find an object that will satisfy its craving. That which, in us, we call will is Kant&#x27;s &quot;thing in itself&quot;, according to Schopenhauer.

Arthur Schopenhauer put the puzzle of free will and moral responsibility in these terms:
Everyone believes himself &quot;a priori&quot; to be perfectly free, even in his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence another manner of life ... But &quot;a posteriori&quot;, through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns...
In his &quot;On the Freedom of the Will&quot;, Schopenhauer stated, &quot;You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can &quot;will&quot; only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing.&quot;

==Nietzsche==
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was influenced by Schopenhauer when younger, but later felt him to be wrong. However, he maintained a modified focus upon will, making the term &quot;will to power&quot; famous as an explanation of human aims and actions.

==Psychology/psychiatry==
Psychologists also deal with issues of will and &quot;willpower&quot;. They investigate the ability of people to affect their will in behaviour. Some people are highly intrinsically motivated and do whatever seems best to them, while others are &quot;weak-willed&quot; and easily suggestible (extrinsically motivated) by society or outward inducement. Apparent failures of the will and volition have also reportedly been associated with a number of mental and neurological disorders. They also study the phenomenon of Akrasia, wherein people seemingly act against their best interests and know that they are doing so (for instance, restarting cigarette smoking after having intellectually decided to quit). Advocates of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s psychology stress the importance of the influence of the unconscious mind upon the apparent conscious exercise of will. Abraham Low, a critic of psychoanalysis, stressed the importance of will, the ability to control thoughts and impulses, as fundamental for achieving mental health.

<text>Nicholas Richard Ainger (born 24 October 1949) is a Welsh politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, previously Pembrokeshire, from 1992 to 2010. A member of the Labour Party, he served in government under Prime Minister Tony Blair from 1997 to 2007.

==Early life==
Ainger was born in Sheffield in 1949, and was educated at the Netherthorpe Grammar School in Staveley, Derbyshire, and after leaving education in 1967 moved to Milford Haven and became a dock worker at the Marine and Port Services of Pembroke Dock. He was a senior shop steward in the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union for 14 years whilst at the docks, and became elected to the former Dyfed County Council, on which he served from 1981 until his election to Parliament in 1992.

==Parliamentary career==
Ainger was first elected for the seat of Pembrokeshire at the 1992 general election with a slender majority of 755. He re-elected in 1997 for the re-drawn seat of Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire with a majority of 9,621.

From 1997 to 2001, Ainger served as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Wales Office, previously the Welsh Office, under Welsh Secretaries Ron Davies, Alun Michael and Paul Murphy. He was promoted to a Commons Whip and Lord Commissioner of the Treasury in 2001. In 2005, he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, a position he held until Tony Blair departed office in 2007. 

Ainger spent the remainder of his tenure in Parliament as a backbencher, serving on the Treasury Select Committee from November 2007 to May 2010. He campaigned on fuel poverty and better regulation of the banking industry.

At the 2010 general election, Ainger was defeated by the Conservative candidate Simon Hart.

<doc id="79445" wikidata="Q2734873" url="?curid=79445" title="Green belt (United Kingdom)">
<text>In British town planning, the green belt is a policy for controlling urban growth. The term, coined by Octavia Hill in 1875, refers to a ring of countryside where urbanisation will be resisted for the foreseeable future, maintaining an area where local food growing, forestry and outdoor leisure can be expected to prevail. The fundamental aim of green belt policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open, and consequently the most important attribute of green belts is their openness.

The Metropolitan Green Belt around London was first proposed by the Greater London Regional Planning Committee in 1935. The Town and Country Planning Act 1947 then allowed local authorities to include green belt proposals in their development plans. In 1955, Minister of Housing Duncan Sandys encouraged local authorities around the country to consider protecting land around their towns and cities by the formal designation of clearly defined green belts.

Green belt policy has been criticised for reducing the amount of land available for building and therefore pushing up house prices, as 70% of the cost of building new houses is the purchase of the land (up from 25% in the late 1950s).

==England and Wales==

The government formerly set out its policies and principles towards green belts in England and Wales in Planning Policy Guidance Note 2: Green Belts, but this planning guidance was superseded by the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in March 2012. Planning authorities are strongly urged to follow the NPPF&#x27;s detailed advice when considering whether to permit additional development in the green belt. In the green belt there is a general presumption against inappropriate development, unless very special circumstances can be demonstrated to show that the benefits of the development will outweigh the harm caused to the green belt. The NPPF sets out what would constitute appropriate development in the green belt.

According to the NPPF, there are five stated purposes of including land within the green belt:
*To check the unrestricted sprawl of large built-up areas
*To prevent neighbouring towns from merging into one another
*To assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment
*To preserve the setting and special character of historic towns
*To assist in urban regeneration, by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land.

Once an area of land has been defined as green belt, the stated opportunities and benefits include:
*Providing opportunities for access to the open countryside for the urban population
*Providing opportunities for outdoor recreation near urban areas
*The retention of attractive landscapes and the enhancement of landscapes, near to where people live
*Improvement of damaged and derelict land around towns
*The securing of nature conservation interests 
*The retention of land for local food growing, forestry and related uses.

===England===
Although 16 city and town urban cores are identified by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) who are the present central government department maintaining responsibility for green belts, a countryside interest group, Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) continue to group these into 14 green belt areas, the North West green belt encompassing three urban cores.

The area designated as green belt land in England as at 12 October 2023 was estimated at 1,638,420 hectares, about 13 per cent of the land area.

The distribution of green belt designated land by region of England as in 2003, 2013 and 2023 was as follows:
* Counts are rounded

The total area of green belt land in England since 2003 was as follows:

As well as any underlying re-designations, changes in green belt area are explained in part by alterations in land designation by local authorities, and may also be influenced by improvements with measurement associated with digital mapping. Note that from 2006, estimates exclude the area of Green Belt land in New Forest DC and Test Valley BC (47,300 hectares) which were designated as New Forest National Park in 2005.

In July 2024 the Labour government announced plans to prioritise building on &quot;poor quality and ugly areas&quot; within England&#x27;s green belt, including brownfield sites, which it termed the &quot;grey belt&quot;.

===Wales===
Wales has one green belt, between the cities of Cardiff and Newport.

==Northern Ireland==
Northern Ireland has 30 green belt areas, accounting for approximately 226,600 hectares, about 16 percent of its total area.

==Scotland==
Green belt policy in Scotland is set out in Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) 21, published by the Scottish Government in February 2010. On 29 November, the Government published &quot;Green Belt Policy in Scotland 10/85&quot;

As of 2010 Scotland had 10 green belt areas: Aberdeen, Ayr, Clackmannanshire, East Lothian, Edinburgh, Falkirk and Grangemouth, Greater Glasgow, Midlothian and Stirling. There are also plans for green belts around Dunfermline, Perth and St Andrews.

The Scottish Government is clear that the purpose of green belt designation in the development plan as part of the settlement strategy for an area is to:

* direct planned growth to the most appropriate locations and support regeneration,
* protect and enhance the quality, character, landscape setting and identity of towns and cities, and
* protect and give access to open space within and around towns and cities
However, the Scottish Government recognises that certain types of development might actually promote and support appropriate rural diversification:

* Development associated with agriculture, including the re-use of historic agricultural buildings,
* Woodland and forestry, including community woodlands,
* Horticulture, including market gardening and directly connected retailing,
* Recreational uses that are compatible with an agricultural or natural setting, and
* Essential infrastructure such as electronic communications infrastructure and electricity grid connections
The Government requires that locally established green belt plans: maintain the identity of a city by the clearly establishing physical boundaries and preventing coalescence; provide countryside for recreation of denizens; and maintain the landscape setting of the city in question. In its Planning Policy (129), the Scottish Government states that:

“All public bodies, including planning authorities, have a duty to further the conservation of biodiversity under the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004, and this should be reflected in development plans and development management decisions. Biodiversity is important because it provides natural services and products that we rely on, is an important element of sustainable development and makes an essential contribution to Scotland&#x27;s economy and cultural heritage.”
==History==

The term emerged from continental Europe where broad boulevards were increasingly used to separate new development from the centre of historic towns; most notably the Ringstraße in Vienna. Various proposals were put forward from 1890 onwards but the first to garner widespread support was put forward by the London Society in its &quot;Development Plan of Greater London&quot; 1919. Alongside the CPRE they lobbied for a continuous belt (of up to two miles wide) to prevent urban sprawl, beyond which new development could occur.

Implementation of the notion dated from Herbert Morrison&#x27;s 1934 leadership of the London County Council. It was first formally proposed by the Greater London Regional Planning Committee in 1935, &quot;to provide a reserve supply of public open spaces and of recreational areas and to establish a green belt or girdle of open space&quot;. It was again included in an advisory Greater London Plan prepared by Patrick Abercrombie in 1944 (which sought a belt of up to six miles wide). However, it was some 14 years before the elected local authorities responsible for the area around London had all defined the area on scaled maps with some precision (encouraged by Duncan Sandys to designate a belt of some 7–10 miles wide).

The motives for a green belt around London were not just environmental, Frank Pick the CEO of the London Passenger Transport Board made an economic case; he believed that London Underground had a finite potential capacity which would be breached by the growth of the city&#x27;s population and overall physical size. Pick presented this case to the Barlow Commission (Royal Commission on the Geographical Distribution of the Industrial Population), arguing that if London&#x27;s radius grew beyond 12–15 miles, the capital&#x27;s commuter infrastructure could not cope in financial or capacity terms, to the detriment of city&#x27;s overall economy. He instead made the case for a number of economically self-sufficient new towns beyond a new green belt.

New provisions for compensation in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 allowed local authorities around the country to incorporate green belt proposals in their first development plans. The codification of Green Belt policy and its extension to areas other than London came with the historic Circular 42/55 inviting local planning authorities to consider the establishment of green belts. This decision was made in tandem with the 1946 New Towns Act, which sought to depopulate urban centres in the South East of England and accommodate people in new settlements elsewhere. Green belt could therefore be designated by local authorities without worry that it would come into conflict with pressure from population growth.

As the outward growth of London was seen to be firmly repressed, residents owning properties further from the built-up area also campaigned for this policy of urban restraint, partly to safeguard their own investments but often invoking an idealised scenic/rustic argument which laid the blame for most social ills upon urban influences. In mid-1971, for example, the government decided to extend the Metropolitan Green Belt northwards to include almost all of Hertfordshire. The Metropolitan Green Belt now covers parts of 68 different Districts or Boroughs.

Since 1955 London&#x27;s green belt has extended significantly, stretching some 35 miles out in places. London&#x27;s green belt now covers an area of 516,000 hectares, an area broadly three times larger than that of London itself. The London Society began debate about the city&#x27;s green belt in 2014 with publication of a report entitled &quot;Green Sprawl&quot;. Other organisations, including the Planning Officers Society, have since responded with specific calls for a review and proposals to balance land release with environmental protection. In 2016, the London Society and the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for London&#x27;s Planning and Built Environment published plans for a &#x27;green web&#x27; to replace the green belt in some locations. The ambition is to create a &quot;multifunctional green infrastructure landscape&quot; in which new-build and publicly accessible natural space sat side by side.

Research undertaken by the London School of Economics in 2016 suggests that by 1979, the area covered by green belt in England comprised 721,500 hectares, and by 1993, this had been extended to 1,652,310 hectares.

==Criticism==
Several academics, policy groups and town planning organisations in recent years have criticised the idea and implementation of green belts in the UK. Green belt policy has been attacked as too rigid in the face of new urban and environmental challenges, principally the lack of housing available in many cities in the UK. The policy has been criticised for reducing the amount of land available for building and therefore pushing up house prices, as 70% of the cost of building new houses is the purchase of the land (up from 25% in the late 1950s). It has also been claimed that areas of green belt can be of unremarkable environmental quality, and may not be well managed or provide the recreational opportunities originally envisaged.

===Environmental===
The Town and Country Planning Association, an organisation heavily involved in initiating the concept several decades previously, published a policy statement in 2002, which proposed a more flexible policy which would allow the introduction of green wedge and strategic gap policies rather than green belts, and so permit the expansion of some urban areas. In October 2007, Sir Martin Doughty, then Chair of Natural England, argued for a review of green belts, saying: &quot;The time has come for a greener green belt. We need a 21st century solution to England&#x27;s housing needs which puts in place a network of green wedges, gaps and corridors, linking the natural environment and people.&quot;. Similarly, the London Society published a comprehensive history of the green belt (as it emerged in the first part of the twentieth century) in 2014. Authored by the influential English urbanist Jonathan Manns, this called for a &quot;move away from the simplistic and naïve idea that countryside is a sacrosanct patchwork of medieval hedgerows and towards an empirically informed position which once more recognises housing as a need to be met in locations with appropriate environmental capacity&quot;.

===Effect on house prices===
&quot;The Economist&quot; has criticised green belt policy, saying that unless more houses are built through reforming planning laws and releasing green belt land, then housing space will need to be rationed out. In March 2014, it was noted that if general inflation had risen as fast as housing prices had since 1971, a chicken would cost £51; and that Britain is &quot;building less homes today than at any point since the 1920s&quot;. According to the Institute of Economic Affairs, there is &quot;overwhelming empirical evidence that that planning restrictions have a substantial impact on housing costs&quot; and are the main reason why housing is two and a half times more expensive in 2011 than it was in 1975. The free market Adam Smith Institute is a particular critic of the green belt, and has claimed that removing the green belt from land within ten minutes walk of a railway station would release enough land to build 1 million homes.

In response to the claims made by the Adams Smith Institute, the Royal Town Planning Institute commissioned the Building In The Green Belt? report to look into the commuting patterns in London&#x27;s metropolitan green belt. The study found only 7.4% of commuters, who lived near a railway station actually travelled to London by train on a regular basis with the vast majority (72%) travelling by private vehicle to jobs in their hometown and to other places not within London. Thus the proposal put forward in the Adam Smith report could result in 3.96 to 7.45 million additional car journeys per week on already congested roads around London. CPRE say it is a myth to connect green belts to rising house prices, since there is no clear difference in house prices between cities with green belts and cities without them, and both land and house prices are inflated by other factors such as investment.

Lewis Abbott has identified green belt barriers to urban expansion as one of several major protectionist political-economic barriers to house building with negative effects on the supply, cost/prices, and quality of new homes. (The others include new housing development taxes and quasi-taxes; political discrimination against particular classes of new housing supplier, household consumer, and housing product; and controls on housing technical-product development – in particular, the blocking of innovative low-cost house building using new materials and production technologies). Abbott argues that the greenbelts actually defeat their own stated objective of saving the countryside and open spaces. By preventing existing towns and cities from extending normally and organically, they result in more land-extensive housing developments further out – i.e., the establishment beyond the greenbelts of new communities with lower building densities, their own built infrastructure and other facilities, and greater dependence on cars and commuting, etc. Meanwhile, valuable urban green space and brownfield sites best suited to industry and commerce are lost in existing conurbations as more and more new housing is crammed into them.

Commentators such as Alan Evans and Tom Papworth have called for outright abolition of green belts, principally on the grounds that by inhibiting the free use of land they restrict home ownership.

However, in England, where 65% of people are property-owners who benefit from scarcity of building land, the concept of &quot;green belt&quot; has become entrenched as a fundamental part of government policy, and the possibility of reviewing boundaries is often viewed with considerable hostility by environmental charities, neighbouring communities and their elected representatives.

==Related concepts==
The general concept of &quot;green belt&quot; has evolved in recent years to encompass &quot;Greenspace&quot; and &quot;Greenstructure&quot;, taking into account urban greenspace, an important aspect of sustainable development in the 21st century. However, while in general these concepts are quite distinct in the UK from the green belt as a statutory development plan designation, an exception occurs in London where land may be designated as &quot;Metropolitan Open Land&quot; (MOL). Areas of MOL are subject to the same planning restrictions as the green belt while lying within the urban area. In 2005, the European Commission&#x27;s COST Action C11 (COST European Cooperation in Science and Technology) undertook in-depth city case studies into cities across 15 European countries. Sheffield was one such case study city for the UK. Conclusions were published in &quot;Case studies in Greenstructure Planning&quot;.

<doc id="79448" wikidata="Q207947" url="?curid=79448" title="Ralph Vaughan Williams">
<text>Ralph Vaughan Williams ( ; 12 October 1872– 26 August 1958) was an English composer. His works include operas, ballets, chamber music, secular and religious vocal pieces and orchestral compositions including nine symphonies, written over sixty years. Strongly influenced by Tudor music and English folk-song, his output marked a decisive break in British music from its German-dominated style of the 19th century.

Vaughan Williams was born to a well-to-do family with strong moral views and a progressive social outlook. Throughout his life he sought to be of service to his fellow citizens, and believed in making music as available as possible to everybody. He wrote many works for amateur and student performance. He was musically a late developer, not finding his true voice until his late thirties; his studies in 1907–1908 with the French composer Maurice Ravel helped him clarify the textures of his music and free it from Teutonic influences.

Vaughan Williams is among the best-known British symphonists, noted for his very wide range of moods, from stormy and impassioned to tranquil, from mysterious to exuberant. Among the most familiar of his other concert works are &quot;Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis&quot; (1910) and &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot; (1914). His vocal works include hymns, folk-song arrangements and large-scale choral pieces. He wrote eight works for stage performance between 1919 and 1951. Although none of his operas became popular repertoire pieces, his ballet &quot;&quot; (1930) was successful and has been frequently staged.

Two episodes made notably deep impressions in Vaughan Williams&#x27;s personal life. The First World War, in which he served in the army, had a lasting emotional effect. Twenty years later, though in his sixties and devotedly married, he was reinvigorated by a love affair with a much younger woman, who later became his second wife. He went on composing through his seventies and eighties, producing his last symphony months before his death at the age of eighty-five. His works have continued to be a staple of the British concert repertoire, and all his major compositions and many of the minor ones have been recorded.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Vaughan Williams was born at Down Ampney, Gloucestershire, the third child and younger son of the vicar, the Reverend Arthur Vaughan Williams (1834–1875), and his wife, Margaret, &quot;née&quot; Wedgwood (1842–1937). His paternal forebears were of mixed English and Welsh descent; many of them went into the law or the Church. The judges Sir Edward and Sir Roland Vaughan Williams were respectively Arthur&#x27;s father and brother. Margaret Vaughan Williams was a great-granddaughter of Josiah Wedgwood and niece of Charles Darwin.
Arthur Vaughan Williams died suddenly in February 1875, and his widow took the children to live in her family home, Leith Hill Place, Wotton, Surrey. The children were under the care of a nurse, Sara Wager, who instilled in them not only polite manners and good behaviour but also liberal social and philosophical opinions. Such views were consistent with the progressive-minded tradition of both sides of the family. When the young Vaughan Williams asked his mother about Darwin&#x27;s controversial book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, she answered, &quot;The Bible says that God made the world in six days. Great Uncle Charles thinks it took longer: but we need not worry about it, for it is equally wonderful either way&quot;.

In 1878, at the age of five, Vaughan Williams began receiving piano lessons from his aunt, Sophy Wedgwood. He displayed signs of musical talent early on, composing his first piece of music, a four-bar piano piece called &quot;The Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot;, in the same year. He did not greatly like the piano, and was pleased to begin violin lessons the following year. In 1880, when he was eight, he took a correspondence course in music from Edinburgh University and passed the associated examinations.

In September 1883 he went as a boarder to Field House preparatory school in Rottingdean on the south coast of England, forty miles (64 km) from Wotton. He was generally happy there, although he was shocked to encounter for the first time social snobbery and political conservatism, which were rife among his fellow pupils. From there he moved on to the public school Charterhouse in January 1887. His academic and sporting achievements there were satisfactory, and the school encouraged his musical development. In 1888 he organised a concert in the school hall, which included a performance of his G major Piano Trio (now lost) with the composer as violinist.

While at Charterhouse Vaughan Williams found that religion meant less and less to him, and for a while he was an atheist. This softened into &quot;a cheerful agnosticism&quot;, and he continued to attend church regularly to avoid upsetting the family. His views on religion did not affect his love of the Authorised Version of the Bible, the beauty of which, in the words of his widow Ursula Vaughan Williams in her 1964 biography of the composer, remained &quot;one of his essential companions through life.&quot; In this, as in many other things in his life, he was, according to his biographer Michael Kennedy, &quot;that extremely English product the natural nonconformist with a conservative regard for the best tradition&quot;.

===Royal College of Music and Trinity College, Cambridge===

In July 1890 Vaughan Williams left Charterhouse and in September he was enrolled as a student at the Royal College of Music (RCM), London. After a compulsory course in harmony with Francis Edward Gladstone, professor of organ, counterpoint and harmony, he studied organ with Walter Parratt and composition with Hubert Parry. He idolised Parry, and recalled in his &quot;Musical Autobiography&quot; (1950):
Vaughan Williams&#x27;s family would have preferred him to have remained at Charterhouse for two more years and then go on to Cambridge University. They were not convinced that he was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but feeling it would be wrong to prevent him from trying, they had allowed him to go to the RCM. Nevertheless, a university education was expected of him, and in 1892 he temporarily left the RCM and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years, studying music and history.

Among those with whom Vaughan Williams became friendly at Cambridge were the philosophers G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell, the historian G. M. Trevelyan and the musician Hugh Allen. He felt intellectually overshadowed by some of his companions, but he learned much from them and formed lifelong friendships with several. Among the women with whom he mixed socially at Cambridge was Adeline Fisher, the daughter of Herbert Fisher, an old friend of the Vaughan Williams family. She and Vaughan Williams grew close, and in June 1897, after he had left Cambridge, they became engaged to be married.
During his time at Cambridge Vaughan Williams continued his weekly lessons with Parry, and studied composition with Charles Wood and organ with Alan Gray. He graduated as Bachelor of Music in 1894 and Bachelor of Arts the following year. After leaving the university he returned to complete his training at the RCM. Parry had by then succeeded Sir George Grove as director of the college, and Vaughan Williams&#x27;s new professor of composition was Charles Villiers Stanford. Relations between teacher and student were stormy but affectionate. Stanford, who had been adventurous in his younger days, had grown deeply conservative; he clashed vigorously with his modern-minded pupil. Vaughan Williams had no wish to follow in the traditions of Stanford&#x27;s idols, Brahms and Wagner, and he stood up to his teacher as few students dared to do. Beneath Stanford&#x27;s severity lay a recognition of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s talent and a desire to help the young man correct his opaque orchestration and extreme predilection for modal music.

In his second spell at the RCM (1895–1896) Vaughan Williams got to know a fellow student, Gustav Holst, who became a lifelong friend. Stanford emphasised the need for his students to be self-critical, but Vaughan Williams and Holst became, and remained, one another&#x27;s most valued critics; each would play his latest composition to the other while still working on it. Vaughan Williams later observed, &quot;What one really learns from an Academy or College is not so much from one&#x27;s official teachers as from one&#x27;s fellow-students ... [we discussed] every subject under the sun from the lowest note of the double bassoon to the philosophy of &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;&quot;. In 1949 he wrote of their relationship, &quot;Holst declared that his music was influenced by that of his friend: the converse is certainly true.&quot;

===Early career===

Vaughan Williams had a modest private income, which in his early career he supplemented with a variety of musical activities. Although the organ was not his preferred instrument, the only post he ever held for an annual salary was as a church organist and choirmaster. He held the position at St Barnabas, in the inner London district of South Lambeth, from 1895 to 1899 for a salary of £50 a year. He disliked the job, but working closely with a choir was valuable experience for his later undertakings.

In October 1897 Adeline and Vaughan Williams were married. They honeymooned for several months in Berlin, where he studied with Max Bruch. On their return they settled in London, originally in Westminster and, from 1905, in Chelsea. There were no children of the marriage.

In 1899 Vaughan Williams passed the examination for the degree of Doctor of Music at Cambridge; the title was formally conferred on him in 1901. The song &quot;Linden Lea&quot; became the first of his works to appear in print, published in the magazine &quot;The Vocalist&quot; in April 1902 and then as separate sheet music. In addition to composition he occupied himself in several capacities during the first decade of the century. He wrote articles for musical journals and for the second edition of &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, edited the first volume of Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Welcome Songs&quot; for the Purcell Society, and was for a while involved in adult education in the University Extension Lectures. From 1904 to 1906 he was music editor of a new hymn-book, &quot;The English Hymnal&quot;, of which he later said, &quot;I now know that two years of close association with some of the best (as well as some of the worst) tunes in the world was a better musical education than any amount of sonatas and fugues&quot;. Always committed to music-making for the whole community, he helped found the amateur Leith Hill Musical Festival in 1905, and was appointed its principal conductor, a post he held until 1953.

In 1903–1904 Vaughan Williams started collecting folk-songs. He had always been interested in them, and now followed the example of a recent generation of enthusiasts such as Cecil Sharp and Lucy Broadwood in going into the English countryside noting down and transcribing songs traditionally sung in various locations. Collections of the songs were published, preserving many that could otherwise have vanished as oral traditions died out. Vaughan Williams incorporated some into his own compositions, and more generally was influenced by their prevailing modal forms. This, together with his love of Tudor and Stuart music, helped shape his compositional style for the rest of his career.

Over this period Vaughan Williams composed steadily, producing songs, choral music, chamber works and orchestral pieces, gradually finding the beginnings of his mature style. His compositions included the tone poem &quot;In the Fen Country&quot; (1904) and the &quot;Norfolk Rhapsody No. 1&quot; (1906). He remained unsatisfied with his technique as a composer. After unsuccessfully seeking lessons from Sir Edward Elgar, he contemplated studying with Vincent d&#x27;Indy in Paris. Instead, he was introduced by the critic and musicologist M.D.Calvocoressi to Maurice Ravel, a more modernist, less dogmatic musician than d&#x27;Indy.

===Ravel; rising fame; First World War===

Ravel took few pupils, and was known as a demanding taskmaster for those he agreed to teach. Vaughan Williams spent three months in Paris in the winter of 1907–1908, working with him four or five times each week. There is little documentation of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s time with Ravel; the musicologist Byron Adams advises caution in relying on Vaughan Williams&#x27;s recollections in the &quot;Musical Autobiography&quot; written forty-three years after the event. The degree to which the French composer influenced the Englishman&#x27;s style is debated. Ravel declared Vaughan Williams to be &quot;my only pupil who does not write my music&quot;; nevertheless, commentators including Kennedy, Adams, Hugh Ottaway and Alain Frogley find Vaughan Williams&#x27;s instrumental textures lighter and sharper in the music written after his return from Paris, such as the String Quartet in G minor, &quot;On Wenlock Edge&quot;, the Overture to &quot;The Wasps&quot; and &quot;A Sea Symphony&quot;. Vaughan Williams himself said that Ravel had helped him escape from &quot;the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner&quot;.

In the years between his return from Paris in 1908 and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Vaughan Williams increasingly established himself as a figure in British music. For a rising composer it was important to receive performances at the big provincial music festivals, which generated publicity and royalties. In 1910 his music featured at two of the largest and most prestigious festivals, with the premieres of the &quot;Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis&quot; at the Three Choirs Festival in Gloucester Cathedral in September and &quot;A Sea Symphony&quot; at the Leeds Festival the following month. The leading British music critics of the time, J. A. Fuller Maitland of &quot;The Times&quot; and Samuel Langford of &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, were strong in their praise. The former wrote of the fantasia, &quot;The work is wonderful because it seems to lift one into some unknown region of musical thought and feeling. Throughout its course one is never sure whether one is listening to something very old or very new&quot;. Langford declared that the symphony &quot;definitely places a new figure in the first rank of our English composers&quot;. Between these successes and the start of war Vaughan Williams&#x27;s largest-scale work was the first version of &quot;A London Symphony&quot; (1914). In the same year he wrote &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot; in its original form for violin and piano.
Despite his age—he was approaching forty-two in October—Vaughan Williams volunteered for military service on the outbreak of the First World War in August. Joining the Royal Army Medical Corps as a private, he served as a stretcher bearer in an ambulance crew in France and later in Greece. Frogley writes of this period that Vaughan Williams was considerably older than most of his comrades, and &quot;the back-breaking labour of dangerous night-time journeys through mud and rain must have been more than usually punishing&quot;. The war left its emotional mark on Vaughan Williams, who lost many comrades and friends, including the young composer George Butterworth. In 1917 Vaughan Williams was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, seeing action in France from March 1918. The continual noise of the guns damaged his hearing, and led to deafness in his later years. After the armistice in 1918 he served as director of music for the British First Army until demobilised in February 1919.

===Inter-war years===
During the war Vaughan Williams stopped writing music, and after returning to civilian life he took some time before feeling ready to compose new works. He revised some earlier pieces, and turned his attention to other musical activities. In 1919 he accepted an invitation from Hugh Allen, who had succeeded Parry as director, to teach composition at the RCM; he remained on the faculty of the college for the next twenty years. In 1921 he succeeded Allen as conductor of the Bach Choir, London. It was not until 1922 that he produced a major new composition, &quot;A Pastoral Symphony&quot;; the work was given its first performance in London in May conducted by Adrian Boult and its American premiere in June conducted by the composer.
Throughout the 1920s Vaughan Williams continued to compose, conduct and teach. Kennedy lists forty works premiered during the decade, including the Mass in G minor (1922), the ballet &quot;Old King Cole&quot; (1923), the operas &quot;Hugh the Drover&quot; and &quot;Sir John in Love&quot; (1924 and 1928), the suite &quot;Flos Campi&quot; (1925) and the oratorio &quot;Sancta Civitas&quot; (1925).

During the decade Adeline became increasingly immobilised by arthritis, and the numerous stairs in their London house finally caused the Vaughan Williamses to move in 1929 to a more manageable home, &quot;The White Gates&quot;, Dorking, where they lived until Adeline&#x27;s death in 1951. Vaughan Williams, who thought of himself as a complete Londoner, was sorry to leave the capital, but his wife was anxious to live in the country, and Dorking was within reasonably convenient reach of town.

In 1932 Vaughan Williams was elected president of the English Folk Dance and Song Society. From September to December of that year he was in the US as a visiting lecturer at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania. The texts of his lectures were published under the title &quot;National Music&quot; in 1934; they sum up his artistic and social credo more fully than anything he had published previously, and remained in print for most of the remainder of the century.

During the 1930s Vaughan Williams came to be regarded as a leading figure in British music, particularly after the deaths of Elgar, Delius and Holst in 1934. Holst&#x27;s death was a severe personal and professional blow to Vaughan Williams; the two had been each other&#x27;s closest friends and musical advisers since their college days. After Holst&#x27;s death Vaughan Williams was glad of the advice and support of other friends including Boult and the composer Gerald Finzi, but his relationship with Holst was irreplaceable.

In some of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s music of the 1930s there is an explicitly dark, even violent tone. The ballet &quot;&quot; (1930) and the Fourth Symphony (1935) surprised the public and critics. The discordant and violent tone of the symphony, written at a time of growing international tension, led many critics to suppose the symphony to be programmatic. Hubert Foss dubbed it &quot;The Romantic&quot; and Frank Howes called it &quot;The Fascist&quot;. The composer dismissed such interpretations, and insisted that the work was absolute music, with no programme of any kind; nonetheless, some of those close to him, including Foss and Boult, remained convinced that something of the troubled spirit of the age was captured in the work.

As the decade progressed, Vaughan Williams found musical inspiration lacking, and experienced his first fallow period since his wartime musical silence. After his anti-war cantata &quot;Dona nobis pacem&quot; in 1936 he did not complete another work of substantial length until late in 1941, when the first version of the Fifth Symphony was completed.

In 1938 Vaughan Williams met Ursula Wood (1911–2007), the wife of an army officer, Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) Michael Forrester Wood. She was a poet, and had approached the composer with a proposed scenario for a ballet. Despite their both being married, and a four-decade age-gap, they fell in love almost from their first meeting; they maintained a secret love affair for more than a decade. Ursula became the composer&#x27;s muse, helper and London companion, and later helped him care for his ailing wife. Whether Adeline knew, or suspected, that Ursula and Vaughan Williams were lovers is uncertain, but the relations between the two women were of warm friendship throughout the years they knew each other. The composer&#x27;s concern for his first wife never faltered, according to Ursula, who admitted in the 1980s that she had been jealous of Adeline, whose place in Vaughan Williams&#x27;s life and affections was unchallengeable.

===1939–1952===
During the Second World War Vaughan Williams was active in civilian war work, chairing the Home Office Committee for the Release of Interned Alien Musicians, helping Myra Hess with the organisation of the daily National Gallery concerts, serving on a committee for refugees from Nazi oppression, and on the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), the forerunner of the Arts Council. In 1940 he composed his first film score, for the propaganda film &quot;49th Parallel&quot;.

In 1942 Michael Wood died suddenly of heart failure. At Adeline&#x27;s behest the widowed Ursula was invited to stay with the Vaughan Williamses in Dorking, and thereafter was a regular visitor there, sometimes staying for weeks at a time. The critic Michael White suggests that Adeline &quot;appears, in the most amicable way, to have adopted Ursula as her successor&quot;. Ursula recorded that during air raids all three slept in the same room in adjacent beds, holding hands for comfort.
In 1943 Vaughan Williams conducted the premiere of his Fifth Symphony at the Proms. Its serene tone contrasted with the stormy Fourth, and led some commentators to think it a symphonic valediction. William Glock wrote that it was &quot;like the work of a distinguished poet who has nothing very new to say, but says it in exquisitely flowing language&quot;. The music Vaughan Williams wrote for the BBC to celebrate the end of the war, &quot;Thanksgiving for Victory&quot;, was marked by what the critic Edward Lockspeiser called the composer&#x27;s characteristic avoidance of &quot;any suggestion of rhetorical pompousness&quot;. Any suspicion that the septuagenarian composer had settled into benign tranquillity was dispelled by his Sixth Symphony (1948), described by the critic Gwyn Parry-Jones as &quot;one of the most disturbing musical statements of the 20th century&quot;, opening with a &quot;primal scream, plunging the listener immediately into a world of aggression and impending chaos.&quot; Coming as it did near the start of the Cold War, many critics thought its &quot;pianissimo&quot; last movement a depiction of a nuclear-scorched wasteland. The composer was dismissive of programmatic theories: &quot;It never seems to occur to people that a man might just want to write a piece of music.&quot;

In 1951 Adeline died, aged eighty. In the same year Vaughan Williams&#x27;s last opera, &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, was staged at Covent Garden as part of the Festival of Britain. He had been working intermittently on a musical treatment of John Bunyan&#x27;s allegory for forty-five years, and the 1951 &quot;morality&quot; was the final result. The reviews were respectful, but the work did not catch the opera-going public&#x27;s imagination, and the Royal Opera House&#x27;s production was &quot;insultingly half-hearted&quot; according to Frogley. The piece was revived the following year, but was still not a great success. Vaughan Williams commented to Ursula, &quot;They don&#x27;t like it, they won&#x27;t like it, they don&#x27;t want an opera with no heroine and no love duets—and I don&#x27;t care, it&#x27;s what I meant, and there it is.&quot;

===Second marriage and last years===
In February 1953 Vaughan Williams and Ursula were married. He left the Dorking house and they took a lease of 10 Hanover Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park, London. It was the year of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation; Vaughan Williams&#x27;s contribution was an arrangement of the Old Hundredth psalm tune, and a new setting of &quot;O taste and see&quot; from Psalm 34, performed at the service in Westminster Abbey.
Having returned to live in London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula&#x27;s encouragement, became much more active socially and in &quot;pro bono publico&quot; activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1956 he set up and endowed the RVW Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception. Kennedy describes it as &quot;like a musical state occasion&quot;.

Of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s works from the 1950s, &quot;Grove&quot; makes particular mention of &quot;Three Shakespeare Songs&quot; (1951) for unaccompanied chorus, the Christmas cantata &quot;Hodie&quot; (1953–1954), the Violin Sonata, and, most particularly, the &quot;Ten Blake Songs&quot; (1957) for voice and oboe, &quot;a masterpiece of economy and precision&quot;. Unfinished works from the decade were a cello concerto and a new opera, &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot;. The predominant works of the 1950s were his three last symphonies. The seventh—officially unnumbered, and titled &quot;Sinfonia antartica&quot;—divided opinion; the score is a reworking of music Vaughan Williams had written for the 1948 film &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot;, and some critics thought it not truly symphonic. The Eighth, though wistful in parts, is predominantly lighthearted in tone; it was received enthusiastically at its premiere in 1956, given by the Hallé Orchestra under the dedicatee, Sir John Barbirolli. The Ninth, premiered at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent in April 1958, puzzled critics with its sombre, questing tone, and did not immediately achieve the recognition it later gained.

Having been in excellent health, Vaughan Williams died suddenly in the early hours of 26 August 1958 at Hanover Terrace, aged 85. Two days later, after a private funeral at Golders Green, he was cremated. On 19 September, at a crowded memorial service, his ashes were interred near the burial plots of Purcell and Stanford in the north choir aisle of Westminster Abbey.

==Music==
Michael Kennedy characterises Vaughan Williams&#x27;s music as a strongly individual blending of the modal harmonies familiar from folk‐song with the French influence of Ravel and Debussy. The basis of his work is melody, his rhythms, in Kennedy&#x27;s view, being unsubtle at times. Vaughan Williams&#x27;s music is often described as visionary; Kennedy cites the masque &quot;Job&quot; and the Fifth and Ninth Symphonies. Vaughan Williams&#x27;s output was prolific and wide-ranging. For the voice he composed songs, operas, and choral works ranging from simpler pieces suitable for amateurs to demanding works for professional choruses. His comparatively few chamber works are not among his better-known compositions. Some of his finest works elude conventional categorisation, such as the &quot;Serenade to Music&quot; (1938) for sixteen solo singers and orchestra; &quot;Flos Campi&quot; (1925) for solo viola, small orchestra, and small chorus; and his most important chamber work, in Howes&#x27;s view—not purely instrumental but a song cycle—&quot;On Wenlock Edge&quot; (1909) with accompaniment for string quartet and piano.

In 1955 the authors of &quot;The Record Guide&quot;, Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor, wrote that Vaughan Williams&#x27;s music showed an exceptionally strong individual voice: Vaughan Williams&#x27;s style is &quot;not remarkable for grace or politeness or inventive colour&quot;, but expresses &quot;a consistent vision in which thought and feeling and their equivalent images in music never fall below a certain high level of natural distinction&quot;. They commented that the composer&#x27;s vision is expressed in two main contrasting moods: &quot;the one contemplative and trance-like, the other pugnacious and sinister&quot;. The first mood, generally predominant in the composer&#x27;s output, was more popular, as audiences preferred &quot;the stained-glass beauty of the Tallis Fantasia, the direct melodic appeal of the &quot;Serenade to Music&quot;, the pastoral poetry of &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot;, and the grave serenity of the Fifth Symphony&quot;. By contrast, as in the ferocity of the Fourth and Sixth Symphonies and the Concerto for Two Pianos: &quot;in his grimmer moods Vaughan Williams can be as frightening as Sibelius and Bartók&quot;. 

===Symphonies===
It is as a symphonist that Vaughan Williams is best known. The composer and academic Elliott Schwartz wrote (1964), &quot;It may be said with truth that Vaughan Williams, Sibelius and Prokofieff are the symphonists of this century&quot;. Although Vaughan Williams did not complete the first of them until he was thirty-eight years old, the nine symphonies span nearly half a century of his creative life. In his 1964 analysis of the nine, Schwartz found it striking that no two of the symphonies are alike, either in structure or in mood. Commentators have found it useful to consider the nine in three groups of three—early, middle and late.
====&quot;Sea&quot;, &quot;London&quot; and &quot;Pastoral&quot; Symphonies (1910–1922)====
The first three symphonies, to which Vaughan Williams assigned titles rather than numbers, form a sub-group within the nine, having programmatic elements absent from the later six.

&quot;A Sea Symphony&quot; (1910), the only one of the series to include a part for full choir, differs from most earlier choral symphonies in that the choir sings in all the movements. The extent to which it is a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley describes it as a hybrid work, with elements of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its sheer length—about eighty minutes—was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow.
&quot;A London Symphony&quot; (1911–1913) which the composer later observed might more accurately be called a &quot;symphony by a Londoner&quot;, is for the most part not overtly pictorial in its presentation of London. Vaughan Williams insisted that it is &quot;self-expressive, and must stand or fall as &#x27;absolute&#x27; music&quot;. There are some references to the urban soundscape: brief impressions of street music, with the sound of the barrel organ mimicked by the orchestra; the characteristic chant of the lavender-seller; the jingle of hansom cabs; and the chimes of Big Ben played by harp and clarinet. But commentators have heard—and the composer never denied or confirmed—some social comment in sinister echoes at the end of the scherzo and an orchestral outburst of pain and despair at the opening of the finale. Schwartz comments that the symphony, in its &quot;unified presentation of widely heterogeneous elements&quot;, is &quot;very much like the city itself&quot;. Vaughan Williams said in his later years that this was his favourite of the symphonies.

The last of the first group is &quot;A Pastoral Symphony&quot; (1921). The first three movements are for orchestra alone; a wordless solo soprano or tenor voice is added in the finale. Despite the title the symphony draws little on the folk-songs beloved of the composer, and the pastoral landscape evoked is not a tranquil English scene, but the French countryside ravaged by war. Some English musicians who had not fought in the First World War misunderstood the work and heard only the slow tempi and quiet tone, failing to notice the character of a requiem in the music and mistaking the piece for a rustic idyll. Kennedy comments that it was not until after the Second World War that &quot;the spectral &#x27;Last Post&#x27; in the second movement and the girl&#x27;s lamenting voice in the finale&quot; were widely noticed and understood.

====Symphonies 4–6 (1935–1948)====
The middle three symphonies are purely orchestral, and generally conventional in form, with sonata form (modified in places), specified home keys, and four-movement structure. The orchestral forces required are not large by the standards of the first half of the 20th century, although the Fourth calls for an augmented woodwind section and the Sixth includes a part for tenor saxophone. The Fourth Symphony (1935) astonished listeners with its striking dissonance, far removed from the prevailing quiet tone of the previous symphony. The composer firmly contradicted any notions that the work was programmatical in any respect, and Kennedy calls attempts to give the work &quot;a meretricious programme ... a poor compliment to its musical vitality and self-sufficiency&quot;.

The Fifth Symphony (1943) was in complete contrast to its predecessor. Vaughan Williams had been working on and off for many years on his operatic version of Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. Fearing—wrongly as it turned out—that the opera would never be completed, Vaughan Williams reworked some of the music already written for it into a new symphony. Despite the internal tensions caused by the deliberate conflict of modality in places, the work is generally serene in character, and was particularly well received for the comfort it gave at a time of all-out war. Neville Cardus later wrote, &quot;The Fifth Symphony contains the most benedictory and consoling music of our time.&quot;

With the Sixth Symphony (1948) Vaughan Williams once again confounded expectations. Many had seen the Fifth, composed when he was seventy, as a valedictory work, and the turbulent, troubled Sixth came as a shock. After violent orchestral clashes in the first movement, the obsessive &quot;ostinato&quot; of the second and the &quot;diabolic&quot; scherzo, the finale perplexed many listeners. Described as &quot;one of the strangest journeys ever undertaken in music&quot;, it is marked &quot;pianissimo&quot; throughout its 10–12-minute duration.

====&quot;Sinfonia antartica&quot;, Symphonies 8 and 9 (1952–1957)====
The seventh symphony, the &quot;Sinfonia antartica&quot; (1952), a by-product of the composer&#x27;s score for &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot;, has consistently divided critical opinion on whether it can be properly classed as a symphony. Alain Frogley in &quot;Grove&quot; argues that though the work can make a deep impression on the listener, it is neither a true symphony in the understood sense of the term nor a tone poem and is consequently the least successful of the mature symphonies. The work is in five movements, with wordless vocal lines for female chorus and solo soprano in the first and last movements. In addition to large woodwind and percussion sections the score features a prominent part for wind machine.

The Eighth Symphony (1956) in D minor is noticeably different from its seven predecessors by virtue of its brevity and, despite its minor key, its general light-heartedness. The orchestra is smaller than for most of the symphonies, with the exception of the percussion section, which is particularly large, with, as Vaughan Williams put it, &quot;all the &#x27;phones&#x27; and &#x27;spiels&#x27; known to the composer&quot;. The work was enthusiastically received at its early performances, and has remained among Vaughan Williams&#x27;s most popular works.

The final symphony, the Ninth, was completed in late 1957 and premiered in April 1958, four months before the composer&#x27;s death. It is scored for a large orchestra, including three saxophones, a flugelhorn, and an enlarged percussion section. The mood is more sombre than that of the Eighth; &quot;Grove&quot; calls its mood &quot;at once heroic and contemplative, defiant and wistfully absorbed&quot;. The work received an ovation at its premiere, but at first the critics were not sure what to make of it, and it took some years for it to be generally ranked alongside its eight predecessors.

===Other orchestral music===

&quot;Grove&quot; lists more than thirty works by Vaughan Williams for orchestra or band over and above the symphonies. They include two of his most popular works—the &quot;Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis&quot; (1910, revised 1919), and &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot;, originally for violin and piano (1914); orchestrated 1920. Other works that survive in the repertoire in Britain are the &quot;Norfolk Rhapsody No 1&quot; (1905–1906), &quot;The Wasps, Aristophanic suite&quot;—particularly the overture (1909), the &quot;English Folk Song Suite&quot; (1923) and the &quot;Fantasia on Greensleeves&quot; (1934).

Vaughan Williams wrote four concertos: for violin (1925), piano (1926), oboe (1944) and tuba (1954); another concertante piece is his Romance for harmonica, strings and piano (1951). None of these works has rivalled the popularity of the symphonies or the short orchestral works mentioned above. Bartók was among the admirers of the Piano Concerto, written for and championed by Harriet Cohen, but it has remained, in the words of the critic Andrew Achenbach, a neglected masterpiece.

In addition to the music for &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot;, Vaughan Williams composed incidental music for eleven other films, from &quot;49th Parallel&quot; (1941) to &quot;The Vision of William Blake&quot; (1957).

===Chamber and instrumental===
By comparison with his output in other genres, Vaughan Williams&#x27;s music for chamber ensembles and solo instruments forms a small part of his oeuvre. &quot;Grove&quot; lists twenty-four pieces under the heading &quot;Chamber and instrumental&quot;; three are early, unpublished works. Vaughan Williams, like most leading British 20th-century composers, was not drawn to the solo piano and wrote little for it. From his mature years, there survive for standard chamber groupings two string quartets (1908–1909, revised 1921; and 1943–1944), a &quot;phantasy&quot; string quintet (1912), and a sonata for violin and piano (1954). The first quartet was written soon after Vaughan Williams&#x27;s studies in Paris with Ravel, whose influence is strongly evident. In 2002 the magazine &quot;Gramophone&quot; described the second quartet as a masterpiece that should be, but is not, part of the international chamber repertory. It is from the same period as the Sixth Symphony, and has something of that work&#x27;s severity and anguish. The quintet (1912) was written two years after the success of the &quot;Tallis Fantasia&quot;, with which it has elements in common, both in terms of instrumental layout and the mood of rapt contemplation. The violin sonata has made little impact.

===Vocal music===
Ursula Vaughan Williams wrote of her husband&#x27;s love of literature, and listed some of his favourite writers and writings:

In addition to his love of poetry, Vaughan Williams&#x27;s vocal music is inspired by his lifelong belief that the voice &quot;can be made the medium of the best and deepest human emotion.&quot;

====Songs====
Between the mid-1890s and the late 1950s Vaughan Williams set more than eighty poems for voice and piano accompaniment. The earliest to survive is &quot;A Cradle Song&quot;, to Coleridge&#x27;s words, from about 1894. The songs include many that have entered the repertory, such as &quot;Linden Lea&quot; (1902), &quot;Silent Noon&quot; (1904) and the song cycles &quot;Songs of Travel&quot; (1905 and 1907) and &quot;On Wenlock Edge&quot;. To Vaughan Williams the human voice was &quot;the oldest and greatest of musical instruments&quot;. He described his early songs as &quot;more or less simple and popular in character&quot;, and the musicologist Sophie Fuller describes this simplicity and popularity as consistent throughout his career. Many composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries wrote sentimental works for female voice; by contrast, songs by Vaughan Williams, such as &quot;The Vagabond&quot; from &quot;Songs of Travel&quot;, to words by Robert Louis Stevenson, are &quot;a particularly masculine breath of fresh air&quot; (Fuller), &quot;virile open-air verses&quot; (Kennedy). Some of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s later songs are less well known; Fuller singles out the cycle &quot;Three Poems by Walt Whitman&quot;, a largely dark work, as too often overlooked by singers and critics. For some of his songs the composer expands the accompaniment to include two or more string instruments in addition to the piano; they include &quot;On Wenlock Edge&quot;, and the Chaucer cycle &quot;Merciless Beauty&quot; (1921), judged by an anonymous contemporary critic as &quot;surely among the best of modern English songs&quot;.

====Choral music====
 Despite his agnosticism Vaughan Williams composed many works for church performance. His two best known hymn tunes, both from c. 1905, are &quot;Down Ampney&quot; to the words &quot;Come Down, O Love Divine&quot;, and &quot;Sine nomine&quot; &quot;For All the Saints&quot;. &quot;Grove&quot; lists a dozen more, composed between 1905 and 1935. Other church works include a &quot;Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis&quot; (1925), the Mass in G minor (1920–1921), a Te Deum (1928) and the motets &quot;O Clap Your Hands&quot; (1920), &quot;Lord, Thou hast been our Refuge&quot; (1921) and &quot;O Taste and See&quot; (1953, first performed at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II).

Vaughan Williams&#x27;s choral works for concert performance include settings of both secular and religious words. The former include &quot;Toward the Unknown Region&quot; to words by Whitman (composed 1904–1906), &quot;Five Tudor Portraits&quot;, words by John Skelton (1935), and the Shakespearean &quot;Serenade to Music&quot; (in its alternative version for chorus and orchestra, 1938). Choral pieces with religious words include the oratorio &quot;Sancta Civitas&quot; (1923–1925) and the Christmas cantata &quot;Hodie&quot; (1954). In 1953 the composer said that of his choral works &quot;Sancta Civitas&quot; was his favourite. The &quot;Dona Nobis Pacem&quot;, an impassioned anti-war cantata (1936) is a combination of both, with words from Whitman and others juxtaposed with extracts from the Latin mass, anticipating a similar mixture of sacred and secular text in Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot; twenty-five years later.

===Stage works===
Vaughan Williams was wary of conventional labels; his best known ballet is described on the title page as &quot;a masque for dancing&quot; and only one of his operatic works is categorised by the composer simply as an opera. For some of his theatre pieces that could be classed as operas or ballets, he preferred the terms &quot;masque&quot;, &quot;romantic extravaganza&quot;, &quot;play set to music&quot;, or &quot;morality&quot;.

In a 2013 survey of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s stage works, Eric Saylor writes, &quot;With the possible exception of Tchaikovsky, no composer&#x27;s operatic career was less emblematic of his success elsewhere.&quot; Although Vaughan Williams was a regular opera-goer, enthusiastic and knowledgeable about works by operatic masters from Mozart to Wagner and Verdi, his success in the operatic field was at best patchy. There is widespread agreement among commentators that this was partly due to the composer&#x27;s poor choice of librettists for some, though not all, of his operas. Another problem was his keenness to encourage amateurs and student groups, which sometimes led to the staging of his operas with less than professional standards. A further factor was the composer&#x27;s expressed preference for &quot;slow, long &quot;tableaux&quot;&quot;, which tended to reduce dramatic impact, although he believed them essential, as &quot;music takes a long time to speak—much longer than words by themselves.&quot;

&quot;Hugh the Drover, or Love in the Stocks&quot; (completed 1919, premiere 1924) has a libretto, by the writer and theatre critic Harold Child, which was described by &quot;The Stage&quot; as &quot;replete with folksy, Cotswold village archetypes&quot;. In the view of the critic Richard Traubner the piece is a cross between traditional ballad opera and the works of Puccini and Ravel, &quot;with rhapsodic results.&quot; The score uses genuine and pastiche folk-songs but ends with a passionate love duet that Traubner considers has few equals in English opera. Its first performance was by students at the Royal College of Music, and the work is rarely staged by major professional companies.

&quot;Old King Cole&quot; (1923) is a humorous ballet. The score, which makes liberal use of folk-song melodies, was thought by critics to be strikingly modern when first heard. Kennedy comments that the music &quot;is not a major work but it is fun.&quot; The piece has not been seen frequently since its premiere, but was revived in a student production at the RCM in 1937.

&quot;On Christmas Night&quot; (1926), a masque by Adolph Bolm and Vaughan Williams, combines singing, dancing and mime. The story is loosely based on Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. The piece was first given in Chicago by Bolm&#x27;s company; the London premiere was in 1935. Saylor describes the work as a &quot;dramatic hodgepodge&quot; which has not attracted the interest of later performers.

The only work that the composer designated as an opera is the comedy &quot;Sir John in Love&quot; (1924–1928). It is based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;. Folk-song is used, though more discreetly than in &quot;Hugh the Drover&quot;, and the score is described by Saylor as &quot;ravishingly tuneful&quot;. Although versions of the play had already been set by Nicolai, Verdi, and Holst, Vaughan Williams&#x27;s is distinctive for its greater emphasis on the love music rather than on the robust comedy. In 1931, with the Leith Hill Festival in mind, the composer recast some of the music as a five-section cantata, &quot;In Windsor Forest&quot;, giving the public &quot;the plums and no cake&quot;, as he put it.

&quot;The Poisoned Kiss&quot; (1927–1929, premiered in 1936) is a light comedy. Vaughan Williams knew the Savoy operas well, and his music for this piece was and is widely regarded as in the Sullivan vein. The words, by an inexperienced librettist, were judged to fall far short of Gilbert&#x27;s standards. Saylor sums up the critical consensus that the work is something between &quot;a frothy romantic comedy [and] a satirical fairy-tale&quot;, and not quite successful in either category.
&quot;Job: A Masque for Dancing&quot; (1930) was the first large-scale ballet by a modern British composer. Vaughan Williams&#x27;s liking for long &quot;tableaux&quot;, however disadvantageous in his operas, worked to successful effect in this ballet. The work is inspired by William Blake&#x27;s &quot;Illustrations of the Book of Job&quot; (1826). The score is divided into nine sections and an epilogue, presenting dance interpretations of some of Blake&#x27;s engravings. The work, choreographed by Ninette de Valois, made a powerful impression at its early stagings, and has been revived by the Royal Ballet several times. Kennedy ranks the score as &quot;one of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s mightiest achievements&quot;, and notes that it is familiar in concert programmes, having &quot;the stature and cohesion of a symphony.&quot;

In Kennedy&#x27;s view the one-act &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot; (1925–1931, premiered 1937) is artistically Vaughan Williams&#x27;s most successful opera; Saylor names &quot;Sir John in Love&quot; for that distinction, but rates &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot; as one of the composer&#x27;s finest works in any genre. It is an almost verbatim setting of J. M. Synge&#x27;s 1902 play of the same name, depicting family tragedy in an Irish fishing village. Kennedy describes the score as &quot;organized almost symphonically&quot; with much of the thematic material developed from the brief prelude. The orchestration is subtle, and foreshadows the ghostly finale of the Sixth Symphony; there are also pre-echoes of the &quot;Sinfonia antartica&quot; in the lamenting voices of the women and in the sound of the sea.

&quot;The Bridal Day&quot; (1938–1939) is a masque, to a scenario by Ursula, combining voice, mime and dance, first performed in 1953 on BBC television. Vaughan Williams later recast it a cantata, &quot;Epithalamion&quot; (1957).

&quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1951), the composer&#x27;s last opera, was the culmination of more than forty years&#x27; intermittent work on the theme of Bunyan&#x27;s religious allegory. Vaughan Williams had written incidental music for an amateur dramatisation in 1906, and had returned to the theme in 1921 with the one-act &quot;The Shepherds of the Delectable Mountains&quot; (finally incorporated, with amendments, into the 1951 opera). The work has been criticised for a preponderance of slow music and stretches lacking in dramatic action, but some commentators believe the work to be one of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s supreme achievements. Summaries of the music vary from &quot;beautiful, if something of a stylistic jumble&quot; (Saylor) to &quot;a synthesis of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s stylistic progress over the years, from the pastoral mediation of the 1920s to the angry music of the middle symphonies and eventually the more experimental phase of the &quot;Sinfonia antartica&quot; in his last decade&quot; (Kennedy).

==Recordings==
Vaughan Williams conducted a handful of recordings for gramophone and radio. His studio recordings are the overture to &quot;The Wasps&quot; and the ballet &quot;Old King Cole&quot; (both made in 1925), and the Fourth Symphony (1937). Live concert tapings include &quot;Dona Nobis Pacem&quot; (1936), the &quot;Serenade to Music&quot;, and the Fifth Symphony, recorded in 1951 and 1952, respectively. There is a recording of Vaughan Williams conducting the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; with his Leith Hill Festival forces. In the early days of LP in the 1950s Vaughan Williams was better represented in the record catalogues than most British composers. &quot;The Record Guide&quot; (1955) contained nine pages of listings of his music on disc, compared with five for Walton, and four apiece for Elgar and Britten.

All the composer&#x27;s major works and many of the minor ones have been recorded. There have been numerous complete LP and CD sets of the nine symphonies, beginning with Boult&#x27;s Decca cycle of the 1950s, most of which was recorded in the composer&#x27;s presence. Although rarely staged, the operas have fared well on disc. The earliest recording of a Vaughan Williams opera was &quot;Hugh the Drover&quot;, in an abridged version conducted by Sargent in 1924. Since the 1960s there have been stereophonic recordings of &quot;Hugh the Drover&quot;, &quot;Sir John in Love&quot;, &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot;, &quot;The Poisoned Kiss&quot;, and &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. Most of the orchestral recordings have been by British orchestras and conductors, but notable non-British conductors who have made recordings of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s works include Herbert von Karajan, Leonard Bernstein, Leopold Stokowski, and, most frequently, André Previn, who conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in the first complete stereo cycle of the symphonies, recorded between 1967 and 1972. Among the British conductors most closely associated with Vaughan Williams&#x27;s music on disc and in concert in the generations after Boult, Sargent and Barbirolli are Vernon Handley, Richard Hickox, Sir Mark Elder and Sir Andrew Davis. Record companies with extensive lists of Vaughan Williams recordings include EMI, Decca, Chandos, Hyperion and Naxos.

==Honours and legacy==
Vaughan Williams refused a knighthood at least once, and declined the post of Master of the King&#x27;s Music after Elgar&#x27;s death. The one state honour he accepted was the Order of Merit in 1935, which confers no prenominal title: he preferred to remain &quot;Dr Vaughan Williams&quot;. His academic and musical honours included an honorary doctorate of music from the University of Oxford (1919); the Cobbett medal for services to chamber music (1930); the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society (1930); the Collard life fellowship of the Worshipful Company of Musicians (1934, in succession to Elgar); an honorary fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge (1935); the Shakespeare prize of the University of Hamburg (1937); the Albert medal of the Royal Society of Arts (1955); and the Howland memorial prize of Yale University (1954). 

After Vaughan Williams&#x27;s death, &quot;The Times&quot; summed up his legacy in a leading article:
In 1994 a group of enthusiasts founded the Ralph Vaughan Williams Society, with the composer&#x27;s widow as its president and Roy Douglas and Michael Kennedy as vice presidents. The society, a registered charity, has sponsored and encouraged performances of the composer&#x27;s works including complete symphony cycles and a Vaughan Williams opera festival. The society has promoted premieres of neglected works, and has its own record label, Albion Records.
Composers of the generation after Vaughan Williams reacted against his style, which became unfashionable in influential musical circles in the 1960s; diatonic and melodic music such as his was neglected in favour of atonal and other modernist compositions. In the 21st century this neglect has been reversed. In the fiftieth anniversary year of his death two contrasting documentary films were released: Tony Palmer&#x27;s &quot;O Thou Transcendent: The Life of Vaughan Williams&quot; and John Bridcut&#x27;s &quot;The Passions of Vaughan Williams&quot;. British audiences were prompted to reappraise the composer. The popularity of his most accessible works, particularly the &quot;Tallis Fantasia&quot; and &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot;, increased, but a wide public also became aware of what a reviewer of Bridcut&#x27;s film called &quot;a genius driven by emotion&quot;. Among the 21st-century musicians who have acknowledged Vaughan Williams&#x27;s influence on their development are John Adams, PJ Harvey, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Anthony Payne, Wayne Shorter, Neil Tennant and Mark-Anthony Turnage.

===Cultural legacy===
The Royal College of Music commissioned an official portrait of the composer from Sir Gerald Kelly (1952) which hangs in the college. The Manchester Art Gallery has a bronze sculpture of Vaughan Williams by Epstein (1952) and the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) has drawings by Joyce Finzi (1947) and Juliet Pannett (1957 and 1958); versions of a bronze head of the composer by David McFall (1956) are in the NPG and at the entrance to the Music reading room of the British Library. There is a statue of Vaughan Williams in Dorking, and a bust by Marcus Cornish in Chelsea Embankment Gardens, near his old house in Cheyne Walk.

<text>A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy, wherein the mother gives birth to two or more babies. A term most applicable to vertebrate species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in &quot;twins&quot; and &quot;triplets&quot;. In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a &quot;litter&quot;, and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.

A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal (&quot;non-identical&quot;) fetuses, or it may be a combination of these factors. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called &quot;monozygotic&quot;, from two zygotes is called &quot;dizygotic&quot;, or from three or more zygotes is called &quot;polyzygotic&quot;. 
Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical or as dizygotic (in cases of twins) or polyzygotic (for three or more siblings) if they are fraternal, i.e., non-identical.

Each fertilized ovum (zygote) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called &quot;fraternal&quot; and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material and hence are called &quot;identical&quot;. Identical twins are always the same sex.

==Terminology==
Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth, where a number higher than three ends with the suffix &quot;-uplet&quot;:
*two offspring – twins
*three offspring – triplets
*four offspring – quadruplets
*five offspring – quintuplets
*six offspring – sextuplets
*seven offspring – septuplets
*eight offspring – octuplets
*nine offspring – nonuplets

Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring are based on the zygosity of the pregnancy:
* Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote
* Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes:
** Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes
** Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes
** Sesquizygotic – an egg which is fertilized by 2 sperms, which produce 2 fetuses

Multiple pregnancies are also classified by how the fetuses are surrounded by one or more placentas (chorionicity) and amniotic sacs (amnionicity).

==Human multiple births==
In humans, the average length of pregnancy (2 weeks fewer than gestation) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to 36 weeks for twin births, 32 weeks for triplets, and 30 weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.

Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births, and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology.

===Twins===

Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. Compared to other multiple births, twin births account for 97% of them in the US. Without fertility treatments, the probability is about 1 in 60; with fertility treatments, it can be as high as 20-25%.

Dizygotic (fraternal) twins can be caused by a hyperovulation gene in the mother. Although the father&#x27;s genes do not influence the woman&#x27;s chances of having twins, he could influence his children&#x27;s chances of having twins by passing on a copy of the hyperovulation gene to them.

Monozygotic (identical) twins do not run in families. The twinning is random, due to the egg splitting, so all parents have an equal chance of conceiving identical twins.

===Triplets===


Triplets can be either fraternal, identical, or a combination of both. The most common are strictly fraternal triplets, which come from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Less common are triplets from a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two identical fetuses, and the other does not. Least common are identical triplets, three fetuses from one egg. In this case, sometimes the original zygote divides into two and then one of those two zygotes divides again but the other does not, or the original zygote divides into three.

Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4,300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than .1%, or 1 in 1,000. According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, &quot;No one really knows the incidence&quot;.

Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies.

===Quadruplets===
Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3,556 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets, all of whom developed schizophrenia. Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as &quot;quads&quot; in Britain.
===Quintuplets===
Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the identical female Canadian Dionne quintuplets, born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as &quot;quins&quot; in the UK and &quot;quints&quot; in North America. A famous set of all-girl quintuplets are the Busby quints from the TV series OutDaughtered.

===Sextuplets===

Born in Liverpool, England, on November 18, 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world&#x27;s first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world&#x27;s fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born on May 10, 2004, in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Reality television shows &quot;Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8&quot; and later &quot;Kate Plus 8&quot; have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets. Other shows of this nature include &quot;Table for 12&quot; and &quot;Sweet Home Sextuplets&quot;.

===Very high-order multiple births===
In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets, born in Des Moines, Iowa, became the first septuplets known to survive infancy. The first surviving set of octuplets on record are the Suleman octuplets, born in 2009 in Bellflower, California. In 2019, all 8 children celebrated their 10th birthday. Multiple births of as many as 9 babies have been born alive; In May 2021, the Cissé nonuplets were born in Morocco to Halima Cissé, a 25-year-old woman from Mali. , two years since their births, all 9 are still living and reportedly in good health.

The list of multiple births covers notable examples.

==Causes and frequency==

The frequency of &quot;N&quot; multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89&quot;N&quot;−1 (&quot;Hellin&#x27;s law&quot;) and as about 1:80&quot;N&quot;−1. This gives:
*1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins
*1:892 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:802 (= 1:6400) for triplets
*1:893 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:803 for quadruplets

North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were:
* Twins – 132,562 (3.31%)
* Triplets – 5,503 (0.14%)
* Quadruplets – 313 (0.0078%)
* Quintuplets and more – 37 (0.00092%)

Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).

For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation.

The number of multiple births has increased since the late 1970s. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization. Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH, followed by intrauterine insemination, are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.
Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:
*mother&#x27;s age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women
*mother&#x27;s use of fertility drugs: approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child

Women conceiving multiples over the age of 35 increase the risk of having fetuses with certain conditions and complications that are not as common in women who are pregnant.

The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally &quot;Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8&quot; and (following their divorce) &quot;Kate Plus 8&quot;, which became the highest-rated show on the &quot;TLC&quot; network.

==Risks==
===Premature birth and low birth weight===
Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born &quot;very preterm&quot;, compared to 1.7% in singletons.

Drugs known as betamimetics can be used to relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth in singleton pregnancies. There is some evidence that these drugs can also reduce the risk of preterm birth for twin pregnancies, but existing studies are small. More data is required before solid conclusions can be drawn. Likewise, existing studies are too small to determine if a cervical suture is effective for reducing prematurity in cases of multiple birth.

As a result of preterm birth, multiples tend to have lower birth weight than singletons. Exceptions are possible, however, as with the Kupresak triplets, born in 2008 in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Their combined weight was 17 lbs, 2.7 oz, which set a world record. Two of the triplets were similar in size and, as expected, moderately low birth weight. The two combined weighed 9 lbs, 2.7 oz. The third triplet, however, was much larger and weighed 8 lbs. individually.

===Cerebral palsy===
Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England. This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.

=== Behavioral issues ===
Premature birth is associated with a higher risk for a breadth of behavioral and socioemotional difficulties that begin in childhood and continue through teenagehood and often into adulthood. Conditions where the risk is greatest include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and anxiety disorders.

===Incomplete separation===

Multiples may be monochorionic, sharing the same chorion, with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic, sharing the same amniotic sac, resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord. In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins, possibly impairing function of internal organs.

===Mortality rate (stillbirth)===
Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses.
Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.

===Prevention in IVF===
Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a 1997 study of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.

The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table:

Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available.

==Management==
Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study.

===Selective reduction (procedure)===
Selective reduction is the practice of reducing the number of fetuses in a multiple pregnancy; it is also called &quot;multifetal reduction&quot;.

The procedure generally takes two days; the first day for testing in order to select which fetuses to remove, and the second day for the procedure itself, in which potassium chloride is injected into the heart of each selected fetus under the guidance of ultrasound imaging. Risks of the procedure include bleeding requiring transfusion, rupture of the uterus, retained placenta, infection, a miscarriage, and prelabor rupture of membranes. Each of these appears to be rare. There are also ethical concerns about this procedure, since it is a form of abortion, and also because of concerns over which fetuses are terminated and why.

Selective reduction was developed in the mid-1980s, as people in the field of assisted reproductive technology became aware of the risks that multiple pregnancies carried for the mother and for the fetuses.

===Care in pregnancy===
Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than &#x27;normal&#x27; antenatal care. Women with a multiple pregnancy are also encouraged after 24 weeks to be on bed rest. This recommendation is not a requirement for women with a multiple pregnancy, but it has been used as a method to prevent complications. Some doctors may prescribe this method to be on the safe side and if they believe it is necessary.

===Nutrition===
As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known.

===Cesarean section or vaginal delivery===
A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation, planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability, as compared with planned vaginal delivery. In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications. In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%.

Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies.

Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies&#x27; wellbeing. The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services.

Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.

===Neonatal intensive care===
Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care or a special care nursery in the hospital immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992 to 1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies (i.e. 165 babies) were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.

==Society and culture==
===Insurance coverage===
====Iran====
In Iran, the Iranian government provides free housing to families that have birthed quintuplets.

====United States====
A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid.

===Cultural aspects===
Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil.

Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented.

In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city (Romulus and Remus) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.

In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces, and Heracles and Iphicles, are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins (Polydeuces, Heracles) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus; his brother is the son of their mother&#x27;s mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called &quot;superfecundation&quot;.

In certain medieval European chivalric romances, such as Marie de France&#x27;s &quot;Le Fresne&quot;, a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

==Ethics of multiple births==
===Medically assisted procreation===
In vitro fertilization (IVF) was first successfully completed in the 1970s as a form of assisted reproductive technology. Out of all the assisted reproductive technology available that is currently in practice, in vitro fertilization has the highest chance of producing multiple offspring. Per each female egg, IVF currently has a 60–70% chance of conceiving. Fertilization is made possible by administering a fertility drug to the eggs or by directly injecting semen into the eggs. There is an increased chance for women over the age of 35 to have multiple births. IVF is a common genetic and ethical topic. Through IVF individuals can produce offspring successfully when natural procreation is not viable. However, in vitro can become genetically specific and allow for the selection of particular genes or expressible traits to be dominantly present in the formed embryo. Ethical dilemmas arise when determining health care coverage and the deviation from natural selection and gene variations. In regards to multiple births different ethical concerns arise from the use of in vitro fertilization. Overall, multiple pregnancies can cause potential harm to the mother and children due to potential complications. Such complications can include uterine bleeding and children not receiving equal nutrients. IVF has also revealed some pre term deliveries and lower birth weights in babies. While some view medically assisted procreation as a saving grace to have children, others consider these procedure to be unnatural and costly to the community.

===Multifetal pregnancy reduction===
Multifetal pregnancy reduction is the reduction of one or more embryos from the bearing woman. Selective reduction usually occurs for pregnancies assisted by assisted reproductive technology (ART). The first multifetal pregnancy reductions to occur in a clinical setting took place in the 1980s. The procedure aims to reduce pregnancies down to approximately one to two fetuses. The overarching purpose of the procedure is not primarily to simply terminate life, but to increase the survival and success of the mother and babies. However, multifetal pregnancy reduction raises some ethical questions. The main argument is similar to abortion ethics in reduction of fetus versus fetus life. The protection of maternal well being versus harm of newly formed fetal life is an extension of the aforementioned ethical question. It can be viewed that all life is important and that no life should be terminated without consent from the life that is being terminated. A polar opposite viewpoint advocates for the right of choice, that being the choice to terminate a pregnancy due to desire or pregnancy risks. Overall, most multifetal pregnancy reductions that occur as a result of ART are being done for the protection of the child-bearer&#x27;s health and to maximize the health of the remaining fetuses.

<text>William Pitt (28 May 1759 – 23 January 1806) was a British statesman who served as the last prime minister of Great Britain from 1783 until the Acts of Union 1800, and then first prime minister of the United Kingdom from January 1801. He left office in March 1801, but served as prime minister again from 1804 until his death in 1806. He was also Chancellor of the Exchequer for all of his time as prime minister. He is known as &quot;Pitt the Younger&quot; to distinguish him from his father, William Pitt the Elder, who had also previously served as prime minister.

Pitt&#x27;s prime ministerial tenure, which came during the reign of King George III, was dominated by major political events in Europe, including the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. Pitt, although often referred to as a Tory, or &quot;new Tory&quot;, called himself an &quot;independent Whig&quot; and was generally opposed to the development of a strict partisan political system.

Pitt was regarded as an outstanding administrator who worked for efficiency and reform, bringing in a new generation of competent administrators. He increased taxes to pay for the great war against France and cracked down on radicalism. To counter the threat of Irish support for France, he engineered the Acts of Union 1800 and tried (but failed) to secure Catholic emancipation as part of the Union. He created the &quot;new Toryism&quot;, which revived the Tory Party and enabled it to stay in power for the next quarter-century.

The historian Asa Briggs argues that his personality did not endear itself to the British mind, for Pitt was too solitary and too colourless, and too often exuded an attitude of superiority. His greatness came in the war with France. Pitt reacted to become what Lord Minto called &quot;the Atlas of our reeling globe&quot;. William Wilberforce said, &quot;For personal purity, disinterestedness and love of this country, I have never known his equal.&quot; Historian Charles Petrie concludes that he was one of the greatest prime ministers &quot;if on no other ground than that he enabled the country to pass from the old order to the new without any violent upheaval ... He understood the new Britain.&quot; For this he is ranked highly amongst all British prime ministers in multiple surveys.

Pitt served as prime minister for a total of eighteen years, 343 days, making him the second-longest-serving British prime minister of all time, after Robert Walpole. At age 24, Pitt is the youngest prime minister in British history and is the youngest ever person to hold the position of prime minister in world history. 

==Early life==
=== Family ===

William Pitt, the second son of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, was born on 28 May 1759 at Hayes Place in the village of Hayes, Kent. He was from a political family on both sides, as his mother, Hester Grenville, was sister of former prime minister George Grenville. According to biographer John Ehrman, Pitt exhibited the brilliance and dynamism of his father&#x27;s line, and the determined, methodical nature of the Grenvilles.

=== Education ===
Suffering from occasional poor health as a boy, he was educated at home by the Reverend Edward Wilson. An intelligent child, Pitt quickly became proficient in Latin and Greek. He was admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge, on 26 April 1773, a month before turning fourteen, going up to Cambridge in October 1773. He studied political philosophy, classics, mathematics, trigonometry, chemistry and history. At Cambridge, Pitt was tutored by George Pretyman, who became a close personal friend and looked after Pitt whilst at University. Pitt later appointed Pretyman Bishop of Lincoln, then Winchester, and drew upon his advice throughout his political career. While at Cambridge, he befriended the young William Wilberforce, who became a lifelong friend and political ally in Parliament. Pitt tended to socialise only with fellow students and others already known to him, rarely venturing outside the university grounds. Yet he was described as charming and friendly. According to Wilberforce, Pitt had an exceptional wit along with an endearingly gentle sense of humour: &quot;no man ... ever indulged more freely or happily in that playful facetiousness which gratifies all without wounding any.&quot; An example of Pitt&#x27;s innocent wit was recorded by Sir John Sinclair. In the early years&#x27; of Pitt&#x27;s ministry there was great interest in the new young First minister. Sinclair was required to write an account of Pitt to satisfy foreign curiosity when he was abroad. At the end of a long description of Britain&#x27;s eminent leader he added: ‘Of all the places where you have been, where did you fare best?’ My answer was, ‘In Poland; for the nobility live there with uncommon taste and splendour; their cooks are French,- their confectioners Italian, - and their wine Tokey.’ He immediately observed, ‘I have heard before of The Polish diet.’ 

In 1776, Pitt, plagued by poor health, took advantage of a little-used privilege available only to the sons of noblemen, and chose to graduate without having to pass examinations. Pitt&#x27;s father was said to have insisted that his son spontaneously translate passages of classical literature orally into English, and declaim impromptu upon unfamiliar topics in an effort to develop his oratorical skills. Pitt&#x27;s father, who had by then been raised to the peerage as Earl of Chatham, died in 1778. As the younger son, Pitt received only a small inheritance.In the months following the death of the Earl of Chatham, Pitt was forced to defend his father&#x27;s reputation. This came about when the Bute family made claims that the late Lord had sought out the Earl of Bute with the desire to form a political coalition. Pitt although just over nineteen years of age publicly argued that this was not the case. Faced with Pitt&#x27;s arguments the Bute family backed off and ceased making their claims. He acquired his legal education at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and was called to the bar in the summer of 1780.

== Early political career (1780–1783)==
===Member of Parliament===
During the general elections of September 1780, at the age of 21, Pitt contested the University of Cambridge seat, but lost, coming bottom of the poll of the five candidates. Pitt had campaigned on his own merit, not as part of any group or with prominent backers. He explained to a friend that &#x27;I do not wish to be thought inlisted [sic] in any party or to call myself anything but the Independent Whig, which in words is hardly a distinction, as every one alike pretends to it.&#x27; intent on entering Parliament, Pitt secured the patronage of James Lowther, later 1st Earl Lowther, with the help of his university friend, Charles Manners, 4th Duke of Rutland. Lowther effectively controlled the pocket borough of Appleby; a by-election in that constituency sent Pitt to the House of Commons in January 1781. Pitt&#x27;s entry into parliament is somewhat ironic as he later railed against the very same pocket and rotten boroughs that had given him his seat.

In Parliament, the youthful Pitt cast aside his tendency to be withdrawn in public, emerging as a noted debater right from his maiden speech. Pitt&#x27;s first speech made a dramatic impression. Sir John Sinclair, member of Parliament for Lostwithiel, thought that Pitt&#x27;s first speech was never surpassed and ‘rarely equalled by any ever delivered in that assembly.’ When Pitt resumed his seat after finishing speaking there was thunderous applause. Sinclair noted that there was ‘utter astonishment … by an audience accustomed to the most splendid efforts of eloquence.’ Pitt originally aligned himself with prominent Whigs such as Charles James Fox. With the Whigs, Pitt denounced the continuation of the American War of Independence, as his father strongly had. Instead he proposed that the prime minister, Lord North, make peace with the rebellious American colonies. Pitt also supported parliamentary reform measures, including a proposal that would have checked electoral corruption. He renewed his friendship with William Wilberforce, now MP for Hull, with whom he frequently met in the gallery of the House of Commons.

=== Chancellorship ===
After Lord North&#x27;s ministry collapsed in 1782, the Whig Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, was appointed prime minister. Pitt was offered the minor post of Vice-Treasurer of Ireland, but he refused, considering the post overly subordinate. Lord Rockingham died only three months after coming to power; he was succeeded by another Whig, William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne. Many Whigs who had formed a part of the Rockingham ministry, including Fox, now refused to serve under Lord Shelburne, the new prime minister. Pitt, however, was comfortable with Shelburne, and thus joined his government; he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Fox, who became Pitt&#x27;s lifelong political rival, then joined a coalition with Lord North, with whom he collaborated to bring about the defeat of the Shelburne administration. When Lord Shelburne resigned in 1783, King George III, who despised Fox, offered to appoint Pitt to the office of prime minister. But Pitt wisely declined, for he knew he would be incapable of securing the support of the House of Commons. The Fox–North coalition rose to power in a government nominally headed by William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland.

Pitt, who had been stripped of his post as Chancellor of the Exchequer, joined the Opposition. He raised the issue of parliamentary reform in order to strain the uneasy Fox–North coalition, which included both supporters and detractors of reform. He did not advocate an expansion of the electoral franchise, but he did seek to address bribery and rotten boroughs. Though his proposal failed, many reformers in Parliament came to regard him as their leader, instead of Charles James Fox.

=== Effects of the American War of Independence ===
Losing the war and the Thirteen Colonies was a shock to the British system. The war revealed the limitations of Britain&#x27;s fiscal-military state when it had powerful enemies and no allies, depended on extended and vulnerable transatlantic lines of communication, and was faced for the first time since the 17th century by both Protestant and Catholic foes. The defeat heightened dissension and escalated political antagonism to the king&#x27;s ministers. Inside parliament, the primary concern changed from fears of an over-mighty monarch to the issues of representation, parliamentary reform, and government retrenchment. Reformers sought to destroy what they saw as widespread institutional corruption. The result was a crisis from 1776 to 1783. The peace in 1783 left France financially prostrate, while the British economy boomed due to the return of American business. That crisis ended in 1784 as a result of the king&#x27;s shrewdness in outwitting Fox and renewed confidence in the system engendered by the leadership of Pitt. Historians conclude that the loss of the American colonies enabled Britain to deal with the French Revolution with more unity and organisation than would otherwise have been the case. Britain turned towards Asia, the Pacific, and later Africa with subsequent exploration leading to the rise of the Second British Empire.

==First Premiership (1783–1801)==
=== Rise to power ===


The Fox–North Coalition fell in December 1783, after Fox had introduced Edmund Burke&#x27;s bill to reform the East India Company to gain the patronage he so greatly lacked while the king refused to support him. Fox stated the bill was necessary to save the company from bankruptcy. Pitt responded that: &quot;Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves.&quot; The king was opposed to the bill; when it passed in the House of Commons, he secured its defeat in the House of Lords by threatening to regard anyone who voted for it as his enemy. Following the bill&#x27;s failure in the Upper House, George III dismissed the coalition government and finally entrusted the premiership to William Pitt, after having offered the position to him three times previously.

==== Appointment ====
A constitutional crisis arose when the king dismissed the Fox–North coalition government and named Pitt to replace it. Though faced with a hostile majority in Parliament, Pitt was able to solidify his position within a few months. Some historians argue that his success was inevitable given the decisive importance of monarchical power; others argue that the king gambled on Pitt and that both would have failed but for a run of good fortune.

Pitt, at the age of 24, became Great Britain&#x27;s youngest prime minister ever. The contemporary satire &quot;The Rolliad&quot; ridiculed him for his youth:

Many saw Pitt as a stop-gap appointment until some more senior statesman took on the role. However, although it was widely predicted that the new &quot;mince-pie administration&quot; would not outlast the Christmas season, it survived for seventeen years.

So as to reduce the power of the Opposition, Pitt offered Charles James Fox and his allies posts in the Cabinet; Pitt&#x27;s refusal to include Lord North, however, thwarted his efforts. The new government was immediately on the defensive and in January 1784 was defeated on a motion of no confidence. Pitt, however, took the unprecedented step of refusing to resign, despite this defeat. He retained the support of the king, who would not entrust the reins of power to the Fox–North Coalition. He also received the support of the House of Lords, which passed supportive motions, and many messages of support from the country at large, in the form of petitions approving of his appointment which influenced some Members to switch their support to Pitt. At the same time, he was granted the Freedom of the City of London. When he returned from the ceremony to mark this, men of the City pulled Pitt&#x27;s coach home themselves, as a sign of respect. When passing a Whig club, the coach came under attack from a group of men who tried to assault Pitt. When news of this spread, it was assumed Fox and his associates had tried to bring down Pitt by any means.

==== Electoral victory ====

Pitt gained great popularity with the public at large as &quot;Honest Billy&quot; who was seen as a refreshing change from the dishonesty, corruption and lack of principles widely associated with both Fox and North. Despite a series of defeats in the House of Commons, Pitt defiantly remained in office, watching the Coalition&#x27;s majority shrink as some Members of Parliament left the Opposition to abstain.

In March 1784, Parliament was dissolved, and a general election ensued. An electoral defeat for the government was out of the question because Pitt enjoyed the support of King George III. Patronage and bribes paid by the Treasury were normally expected to be enough to secure the government a comfortable majority in the House of Commons, but on this occasion, the government reaped much popular support as well. In most popular constituencies, the election was fought between candidates clearly representing either Pitt or Fox and North. Early returns showed a massive swing to Pitt with the result that many Opposition Members who still had not faced election either defected, stood down, or made deals with their opponents to avoid expensive defeats.

A notable exception came in Fox&#x27;s own constituency of Westminster, which contained one of the largest electorates in the country. In a contest estimated to have cost a quarter of the total spending in the entire country, Fox bitterly fought against two Pittite candidates to secure one of the two seats for the constituency. Great legal wranglings ensued, including the examination of every single vote cast, which dragged on for more than a year. Meanwhile, Fox sat for the Scottish pocket borough of Tain Burghs. Many saw the dragging out of the result as being unduly vindictive on the part of Pitt and eventually the examinations were abandoned with Fox declared elected. Elsewhere, Pitt won a personal triumph when he was elected a Member for the University of Cambridge, a constituency he had long coveted and which he would continue to represent for the remainder of his life. Pitt&#x27;s new constituency suited him perfectly as he was able to act independently. Sir James Lowther&#x27;s pocket borough of Appleby, which had been Pitt&#x27;s previous constituency, had strings attached. Now Pitt could really be the &#x27;independent Whig&#x27; he identified as. 

===First government===
In domestic politics, Pitt concerned himself with the cause of parliamentary reform. In 1785, he introduced a bill to remove the representation of thirty-six rotten boroughs, and to extend, in a small way, the electoral franchise to more individuals. Pitt&#x27;s support for the bill, however, was not strong enough to prevent its defeat in the House of Commons. The bill of 1785 was the last parliamentary reform proposal introduced by Pitt to British legislators.

====Colonial reform====

His administration secure, Pitt could begin to enact his agenda. His first major piece of legislation as prime minister was the India Act 1784, which re-organised the British East India Company and kept a watch over corruption. The India Act created a new Board of Control to oversee the affairs of the East India Company. It differed from Fox&#x27;s failed India Bill 1783 and specified that the board would be appointed by the king. Pitt was appointed, along with Lord Sydney, who was appointed president. The act centralised British rule in India by reducing the power of the governors of Bombay and Madras and by increasing that of Governor-General Charles Cornwallis. Further augmentations and clarifications of the governor-general&#x27;s authority were made in 1786, presumably by Lord Sydney, and presumably as a result of the company&#x27;s setting up of Penang with their own superintendent (governor), Captain Francis Light, in 1786.

Convicts were originally transported to the Thirteen Colonies in North America, but after the American War of Independence ended in 1783, the newly formed United States refused to accept further convicts. Pitt&#x27;s government took the decision to settle what is now Australia and found the penal colony in August 1786. The First Fleet of 11 vessels carried over a thousand settlers, including 778 convicts. The Colony of New South Wales was formally proclaimed by Governor Arthur Phillip on 7 February 1788 at Sydney.

====Finances====

Another important domestic issue with which Pitt had to concern himself was the national debt, which had doubled to £243 million during the American war. Every year, a third of the budget of £24 million went to pay interest. Pitt sought to reduce the national debt by imposing new taxes. In 1786, he instituted a sinking fund so that £1 million a year was added to a fund so that it could accumulate interest; eventually, the money in the fund was to be used to pay off the national debt. Pitt had learned of the idea of the &#x27;Sinking Fund&#x27; from his father in 1772. Earl Chatham had been informed of the Welshman, Sir Richard Price&#x27;s idea, Pitt approved of the idea and adopted it when he was in office. By 1792, the debt had fallen to £170 million.

Pitt always paid careful attention to financial issues. A fifth of Britain&#x27;s imports were smuggled in without paying taxes. He made it easier for honest merchants to import goods by lowering tariffs on easily smuggled items such as tea, wine, spirits, and tobacco. This policy raised customs revenues by nearly £2 million a year.

In 1797, Pitt was forced to protect the kingdom&#x27;s gold reserves by preventing individuals from exchanging banknotes for gold. Great Britain would continue to use paper money for over two decades. Pitt also introduced Great Britain&#x27;s first-ever income tax. The new tax helped offset losses in indirect tax revenue, which had been caused by a decline in trade. Pitt&#x27;s two policies of suspending cash payments and introducing Income Tax were later cited by the French Minister of Finance as being &#x27;genius&#x27;. As they had stopped the French from destroying Britain&#x27;s economy. 

====Foreign affairs====
Pitt sought European alliances to restrict French influence, forming the Triple Alliance with Prussia and Holland in 1788. During the Nootka Sound Controversy in 1790, Pitt took advantage of the alliance to force Spain to give up its claim to exclusive control over the western coast of North and South America. The Alliance, however, failed to produce any other important benefits for Great Britain.

Pitt was alarmed at Russian expansion in the 1780s at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. The relations between Russia and Britain were disturbed during the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792 by Pitt&#x27;s subscription to the view of the Prussian government that the Triple Alliance could not with impunity allow the balance of power in Eastern Europe to be disturbed. In peace talks with the Ottomans, Russia refused to return the key Ochakov fortress. Pitt wanted to threaten military retaliation. However Russia&#x27;s ambassador Semyon Vorontsov organised Pitt&#x27;s enemies and launched a public opinion campaign. Pitt had become alarmed at the opposition to his Russian policy in parliament, Burke and Fox both uttering powerful speeches against the restoration of Ochakov to the Turks. Pitt won the vote so narrowly that he gave up. The outbreak of the French Revolution and its attendant wars temporarily united Britain and Russia in an ideological alliance against French republicanism.

====The king&#x27;s condition====
In 1788, Pitt faced a major crisis when the king fell victim to a mysterious illness, a form of mental disorder that incapacitated him. If the sovereign was incapable of fulfilling his constitutional duties, Parliament would need to appoint a regent to rule in his place. All factions agreed that the only viable candidate was the king&#x27;s eldest son and heir apparent, George, Prince of Wales. The Prince, however, was a supporter of Charles James Fox. Had the Prince come to power, he would almost surely have dismissed Pitt. He did not have such an opportunity, however, as Parliament spent months debating legal technicalities relating to the regency. Fortunately for Pitt, the king recovered in February 1789, just after a Regency Bill had been introduced and passed in the House of Commons.

The general elections of 1790 resulted in a majority for the government, and Pitt continued as prime minister. In 1791, he proceeded to address one of the problems facing the growing British Empire: the future of British Canada. By the Constitutional Act of 1791, the province of Quebec was divided into two separate provinces: the predominantly French Lower Canada and the predominantly English Upper Canada. In August 1792, coincident with the capture of Louis XVI by the French revolutionaries, George III appointed Pitt as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, a position whose incumbent was responsible for the coastal defences of the realm. The king had in 1791 offered him a Knighthood of the Garter, but he suggested the honour go to his elder brother, the second Earl of Chatham.

====French Revolution====
An early favourable response to the French Revolution encouraged many in Great Britain to reopen the issue of parliamentary reform, which had been dormant since Pitt&#x27;s reform bill was defeated in 1785. The reformers, however, were quickly labelled as radicals and associates of the French revolutionaries. Pitt, due to economic reasons, wanted to remain aloof from War with France. However, this option was taken away from him by an ultimatum from King George III. Pitt could either resign or go to war. Committed to making Britain financially stable Pitt agreed, albeit very reluctantly, to go to war against the French Revolutionaries. Though France&#x27;s declaration of hostilities against Britain meant that Britain was forced into war. Subsequently, in 1794, Pitt&#x27;s administration tried three of them for treason but lost. Parliament began to enact repressive legislation in order to silence the reformers. Individuals who published seditious material were punished, and, in 1794, the writ of habeas corpus was suspended. Other repressive measures included the Seditious Meetings Act 1795, which restricted the right of individuals to assemble publicly, and the Combination Acts, which restricted the formation of societies or organisations that favoured political reforms. Problems manning the Royal Navy also led to Pitt to introduce the Quota System in 1795 in addition to the existing system of impressment.

The war with France was extremely expensive, straining Great Britain&#x27;s finances. Unlike in the latter stages of the Napoleonic Wars, at this point Britain had only a very small standing army, and thus contributed to the war effort mainly through sea power and by supplying funds to other coalition members facing France.

====Ideological struggle====

Throughout the 1790s, the war against France was presented as an ideological struggle between French republicanism vs. British monarchism with the British government seeking to mobilise public opinion in support of the war. The Pitt government waged a vigorous propaganda campaign contrasting the ordered society of Britain dominated by the aristocracy and the gentry vs. the &quot;anarchy&quot; of the French revolution and always sought to associate British &quot;radicals&quot; with the revolution in France. Some of the writers the British government subsidized (often from Secret Service funds) included Edmund Burke, William Cobbett, William Playfair, John Reeves, and Samuel Johnson (the last through the pension granted him in 1762). 

Though the Pitt government did drastically reduce civil liberties and created a nationwide spy network with ordinary people being encouraged to denounce any &quot;radicals&quot; that might be in their midst, the historian Eric J. Evans argued the picture of Pitt&#x27;s &quot;reign of terror&quot; as portrayed by the Marxist historian E.P. Thompson is incorrect, stating there is much evidence of a &quot;popular conservative movement&quot; that rallied in defence of King and Country. Evans wrote that there were about 200 prosecutions of &quot;radicals&quot; suspected of sympathy with the French revolution in British courts in the 1790s, which was much less than the prosecutions of suspected Jacobites after the rebellions of 1715 and 1745. 

However, the spy network maintained by the government was efficient. In Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, which was written in the 1790s, but not published until 1817, one of the characters remarks that it is not possible for a family to keep secrets in these modern times when spies for the government were lurking everywhere. This comment captures well the tense, paranoid atmosphere of the 1790s, when people were being encouraged to report &quot;radicals&quot; to the authorities.

====Haiti====

In 1793, Pitt decided to take advantage of the Haitian Revolution to seize St. Domingue, the richest French colony in the world, believing this would strike a great blow at France while bringing St. Domingue into the British Empire and ensuring that the slaves in the British West Indies would not be inspired to revolt likewise. Many of those who owned slave plantations in the British West Indies had been greatly alarmed by the revolution, which began in 1791, and they were strongly pressing Pitt to restore slavery in St. Domingue, lest their own slaves be inspired to seek freedom. Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, who was Pitt&#x27;s Secretary of State for War, instructed Sir Adam Williamson, the lieutenant-governor of Jamaica, to sign an agreement with representatives of the French colonists that promised to restore the , slavery, and discrimination against mixed-race colonists, a move that drew criticism from abolitionists William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson.

The British landed in St. Domingue on 20 September 1793, stating they had come to protect the white population from the blacks, and were able to seize some coastal enclaves. The fact that the British had come to restore slavery in St. Domingue inspired ferocious resistance from the Haitians, who had no desire to be forced into chains again. The heavy death toll caused by yellow fever, the much dreaded &quot;black vomit&quot;, made conquering St. Domingue impossible, but an undeterred Pitt launched what he called the &quot;great push&quot; in 1795, sending out an even larger British expedition.

In November 1795, some 218 ships left Portsmouth for St. Domingue. After the failure of the Quiberon expedition earlier in 1795, when the British landed a force of French royalists on the coast of France who were annihilated by the forces of the republic, Pitt had decided it was crucial for Britain to have St. Domingue, no matter what the cost in lives and money, to improve Britain&#x27;s negotiating hand when it came time to make peace with the French republic. The British historian Michael Duffy argued that since Pitt committed far more manpower and money to the Caribbean expeditions, especially the one to St. Domingue, than he ever did to Europe in the years 1793–1798, it is proper to view the West Indies as Britain&#x27;s main theatre of war and Europe as more of a sideshow. By 1795, 50% of the British Army was deployed in the West Indies (with the largest contingent in St. Domingue), whereas the rest of the British Army was divided among Britain, Europe, India, and North America.

As the British death toll, largely caused by yellow fever, continued to climb, Pitt was criticised in the House of Commons. Several MPs suggested it might be better to abandon the expedition, but Pitt insisted that Britain had given its word of honour that it would protect the French planters from their former slaves, and the expedition to St. Domingue could not be abandoned. The British attempt to conquer St. Domingue in 1793 ended in disaster; the British pulled out on 31 August 1798 after having spent 4 million pounds (roughly £ million in ) and having lost about 100,000 men—dead or crippled for life, mostly from disease—over the preceding five years. The British historian Sir John William Fortescue wrote that Pitt and his cabinet had tried to destroy French power &quot;in these pestilent islands ... only to discover, when it was too late, that they practically destroyed the British army&quot;. Fortescue concluded that Pitt&#x27;s attempt to add St. Domingue to the British empire had killed off most of the British army, cost the British treasury a fortune and weakened British influence in Europe, making British power &quot;fettered, numbered and paralysed&quot;, all for nothing.

====Ireland====
Pitt maintained close control over Ireland. The Lord Lieutenants were to follow his policy of Protestant control and very little reform for the Catholic majority. When the opposition Portland group joined Pitt&#x27;s ministry, splitting the Foxite opposition, Pitt was put in a difficult situation. He wanted to replace his friend Westmorland, who was Lord Lieutenant, with Lord Camden, whom he could trust. However, one of Portland&#x27;s group, Earl Fitzwilliam, wanted the position. Pitt, to keep Portland on side, appointed Fitzwilliam but allowed the new Lord Lieutenant to believe that he had free range to reform the government in Ireland. Thus, when Fitzwilliam&#x27;s reforms became public in London he was quickly recalled and Camden replaced him. This ensured Pitt had his man in Dublin Castle, whilst also retaining Portland and his group. The unfortunate effect was to produce optimism amongst Irish Catholics who wanted political reform. In May 1798, the long-simmering unrest in Ireland exploded into outright rebellion with the United Irishmen Society launching a revolt to win independence for Ireland. Pitt took an extremely repressive approach to the United Irishmen with the Crown executing about 1,500 United Irishmen after the revolt. The revolt of 1798 destroyed Pitt&#x27;s faith in the governing competence of the Dublin parliament (dominated by Protestant Ascendancy families). Thinking a less sectarian and more conciliatory approach would have avoided the uprising, Pitt sought an Act of Union that would make Ireland an official part of the United Kingdom and end the &quot;Irish Question&quot;. The French expeditions to Ireland in 1796 and 1798 (to support the United Irishmen) were regarded by Pitt as near-misses that might have provided an Irish base for French attacks on Britain, thus making the &quot;Irish Question&quot; a national security matter. As the Dublin parliament did not wish to disband, Pitt made generous use of what would now be called &quot;pork barrel politics&quot; to bribe Irish MPs to vote for the Act of Union.
Throughout the 1790s, the popularity of the Society of United Irishmen grew. Influenced by the American and French revolutions, this movement demanded independence and republicanism for Ireland. The United Irishmen Society was very anti-clerical, being equally opposed to the &quot;superstitions&quot; promoted by both the Church of England and the Roman Catholic church, which caused the latter to support the Crown. Realising that the Catholic church was an ally in the struggle against the French Revolution, Pitt had tried fruitlessly to persuade the Dublin parliament to loosen the anti-Catholic laws to &quot;keep things quiet in Ireland&quot;. Pitt&#x27;s efforts to soften the anti-Catholic laws failed in the face of determined resistance from the families of the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland, who forced Pitt to recall Earl Fitzwilliam as Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1795, when the latter had indicated he would support a bill for Catholic relief. In fact, the actions of Fitzwilliam had been encouraged by Pitt who wanted an excuse to remove Fitzwilliam and replace him with the Earl of Camden, however, Pitt had managed this feat without witnesses. Pitt was very much opposed to Catholic relief and the repeal of their political disabilities which were contained in the Test and Corporation Laws. In much of rural Ireland, law and order had broken down as an economic crisis further impoverished the already poor Irish peasantry, and a sectarian war with many atrocities on both sides had begun in 1793 between Catholic &quot;Defenders&quot; versus Protestant &quot;Peep o&#x27; Day Boys&quot;. A section of the Peep o&#x27;Day Boys who had renamed themselves the Loyal Orange Order in September 1795 were fanatically committed to upholding Protestant supremacy in Ireland at &quot;almost any cost&quot;. In December 1796, a French invasion of Ireland led by General Lazare Hoche (scheduled to coordinate with a rising of the United Irishmen) was only thwarted by bad weather. To crush the United Irishmen, Pitt sent General Lake to Ulster in 1797 to call out Protestant Irish militiamen and organised an intelligence network of spies and informers.

====Spithead mutiny====
In April 1797, the mutiny of the entire Spithead fleet shook the government (sailors demanded a pay increase to match inflation). This mutiny occurred at the same moment that the Franco-Dutch alliance were preparing an invasion of Britain. To regain control of the fleet, Pitt agreed to navy pay increases and had George III pardon the mutineers. By contrast, the more political &quot;floating republic&quot; naval mutiny at the Nore in June 1797 led by Richard Parker was handled more repressively. Pitt refused to negotiate with Parker, whom he wanted to see hanged as a mutineer. In response to the 1797 mutinies, Pitt passed the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797 making it unlawful to advocate breaking oaths to the Crown. In 1798, he passed the Defence of the Realm act, which further restricted civil liberties. Despite the major concerns to Britain&#x27;s defences when the navy mutinied Pitt remained calm and in control. He was confident that the matter would be resolved. Lord Spencer, the First Lord of the Admiralty recalled how calm Pitt was. Very late one evening after visiting the Minister with desperate news of the fleet, as Spencer proceeded away from Downing Street, he remembered he had some more information to give to Pitt. He immediately returned to Number 10 only to be informed that Pitt was fast asleep. Henry Dundas, who was President of the Board of Control, Treasurer of the Navy, Secretary at War and a close friend of Pitt, envied the First Minister for his ability to sleep well in all crcumstances.

====Failure====
Despite Pitt&#x27;s efforts, the French continued to defeat the First Coalition, which collapsed in 1798. A Second Coalition, consisting of Great Britain, Austria, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire, was formed, but it, too, failed to overcome the French. The fall of the Second Coalition with the defeat of the Austrians at the Battle of Marengo (14 June 1800) and at the Battle of Hohenlinden (3 December 1800) left Great Britain facing France alone.

===Resignation===
Following the Acts of Union 1800, Pitt sought to inaugurate the new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland by granting concessions to Roman Catholics, who formed a 75% majority of the population in Ireland, by abolishing various political restrictions under which they suffered. The king was strongly opposed to Catholic emancipation; he argued that to grant additional liberty would violate his coronation oath, in which he had promised to protect the established Church of England. Pitt, unable to change the king&#x27;s strong views, resigned on 16 February 1801 so as to allow Henry Addington, his political friend, to form a new administration. At about the same time, however, the king suffered a renewed bout of madness, with the consequence that Addington could not receive his formal appointment. Though he had resigned, Pitt temporarily continued to discharge his duties; on 18 February 1801, he brought forward the annual budget. Power was transferred from Pitt to Addington on 14 March, when the king recovered.

== Opposition (1801–1804)==
=== Backbencher ===
Shortly after leaving office, Pitt supported the new administration under Addington, but with little enthusiasm; he frequently absented himself from Parliament, preferring to remain in his Lord Warden&#x27;s residence of Walmer Castle—before 1802 usually spending an annual late-summer holiday there, and later often present from the spring until the autumn.

From the castle, he helped organise a local Volunteer Corps in anticipation of a French invasion, acted as colonel of a battalion raised by Trinity House—he was also a Master of Trinity House—and encouraged the construction of Martello towers and the Royal Military Canal in Romney Marsh. He rented land abutting the Castle to farm on which to lay out trees and walks. His niece Lady Hester Stanhope designed and managed the gardens and acted as his hostess.

The Treaty of Amiens in 1802 between France and Britain marked the end of the French Revolutionary Wars. Everyone expected it to be only a short truce. By 1803, war had broken out again with France under Napoleon Bonaparte. Although Addington had previously invited him to join the Cabinet, Pitt preferred to join the Opposition, becoming increasingly critical of the government&#x27;s policies. Addington, unable to face the combined opposition of Pitt and Fox, saw his majority gradually evaporate and resigned in late April 1804.
== Second Premiership (1804–1806)==
===Reappointment===

Pitt finally returned to the premiership on 10 May 1804. He had originally planned to form a broad coalition government, with both the Tories and Whigs under one government. But Pitt faced the opposition of George III to the inclusion of Fox, due to the king&#x27;s dislike. Moreover, many of Pitt&#x27;s former supporters, including the allies of Addington, joined the Opposition. Thus, Pitt&#x27;s second ministry was considerably weaker than his first.

Nevertheless, Pitt formed a second government which consisted of largely Tory members with some former ministers of the previous ministry. These include Lord Eldon as Lord Chancellor, former Foreign Secretary Lord Hawkesbury as Home Secretary, Lord Harrowby as Foreign Secretary, former prime ministers Duke of Portland and Addington as Lord Privy Seal and Lord President of the Council, with Pitt&#x27;s prominent allies the Viscount Melville and Lord Castlereagh as First Lord of the Admiralty and Secretary of State for the Colonies, respectively.

=== Second government ===
==== Resuming war ====
By the time Pitt became prime minister in 1804, the war in Europe had been escalating for sometime since the peace of Amiens in 1801 and in 1803 the War of the Third Coalition began. Pitt&#x27;s new government resumed the war effort yet again to confront the French and to defeat Napoleon. Pitt had initially allied Britain with Austria, Prussia and Russia and now renewed the alliance with Austria Prussia and Russia against Napoleonic France and its allies.
The British government began placing pressure on the French Emperor, Napoleon I. By imposing sanctions, putting up a blockade across the English Channel and undermining French naval activities, Pitt&#x27;s efforts proved a success and thanks to his efforts, the United Kingdom joined the Third Coalition, an alliance that included Austria, Russia, and Sweden. In October 1805, the British Admiral Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson, won a crushing victory in the Battle of Trafalgar, ensuring British naval supremacy for the remainder of the war. At the annual Lord Mayor&#x27;s Banquet toasting him as &quot;the Saviour of Europe&quot;, Pitt responded in a few words that became the most famous speech of his life:
:I return you many thanks for the honour you have done me; but Europe is not to be saved by any single man. England has saved herself by her exertions, and will, as I trust, save Europe by her example.

Nevertheless, the Coalition collapsed, having suffered significant defeats at the Battle of Ulm (October 1805) and the Battle of Austerlitz (December 1805). After hearing the news of Austerlitz Pitt referred to a map of Europe, &quot;Roll up that map; it will not be wanted these ten years.&quot;

====Finances====
Pitt was an expert in finance and served as chancellor of the exchequer. Critical to his success in confronting Napoleon was using Britain&#x27;s superior economic resources. He was able to mobilise the nation&#x27;s industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France.

With a population of 16 million, the United Kingdom was barely half the size of France, which had a population of 30 million. In terms of soldiers, however, the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for a large proportion of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 in 1813.

Britain used its economic power to expand the Royal Navy, doubling the number of frigates and increasing the number of the larger ships of the line by 50%, while increasing the roster of sailors from 15,000 to 133,000 in eight years after the war began in 1793. The British national output remained strong, and the well-organised business sector channelled products into what the military needed. France, meanwhile, saw its navy shrink by more than half. The system of smuggling finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to ruin the British economy by cutting off markets.

By 1814, the budget that Pitt in his last years had largely shaped had expanded to £66 million, including £10 million for the Navy, £40 million for the Army, £10 million for the Allies, and £38 million as interest on the national debt. The national debt soared to £679 million, more than double the GDP. It was willingly supported by hundreds of thousands of investors and tax payers, despite the higher taxes on land and a new income tax.

The whole cost of the war came to £831 million. The French financial system was inadequate and Napoleon&#x27;s forces had to rely in part on requisitions from conquered lands.
===Death===
The setbacks took a toll on Pitt&#x27;s health. He had long suffered from poor health, beginning in childhood, and was plagued with gout and &quot;biliousness&quot;, which was worsened by a fondness for port that began when he was advised to consume it to deal with his chronic ill health. On 23 January 1806, Pitt died at Bowling Green House on Putney Heath, probably from peptic ulceration of his stomach or duodenum; he was unmarried and left no children.

Pitt&#x27;s debts amounted to £40,000 () when he died, but Parliament agreed to pay them on his behalf. A motion was made to honour him with a public funeral and a monument; it passed despite some opposition. Pitt&#x27;s body was buried in Westminster Abbey on 22 February, having lain in state for two days in the Palace of Westminster.

Pitt was succeeded as prime minister by his first cousin William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville, who headed the Ministry of All the Talents, a coalition which included Charles James Fox.

==Personal life==

Pitt became known as a &quot;three-bottle man&quot; in reference to his heavy consumption of port wine. Each of these bottles would be around in volume.

At one point rumours emerged of an intended marriage to Eleanor Eden, to whom Pitt had grown close. Pitt broke off the potential marriage in 1797, writing to her father, Lord Auckland, &quot;I am compelled to say that I find the obstacles to it decisive and insurmountable&quot;.

Of his social relationships, biographer William Hague writes: Pitt was happiest among his Cambridge companions or family. He had no social ambitions, and it was rare for him to set out to make a friend. The talented collaborators of his first 18 months in office—Beresford, Wyvil and Twining—passed in and out of his mind along with their areas of expertise. Pitt&#x27;s lack of interest in enlarging his social circle meant that it did not grow to encompass any women outside his own family, a fact that produced a good deal of rumour. From late 1784, a series of satirical verses appeared in &quot;The Morning Herald&quot; drawing attention to Pitt&#x27;s lack of knowledge of women: &quot;Tis true, indeed, we oft abuse him,/Because he bends to no man;/But slander&#x27;s self dares not accuse him/Of stiffness to a woman.&quot;
Others made snide references to Pitt&#x27;s friendship with Tom Steele, Secretary to the Treasury. At the height of the constitutional crisis in 1784, Sheridan had compared Pitt to James I&#x27;s favourite, the Duke of Buckingham, a clear reference to homosexuality. Socially, Pitt preferred the company of young men, and would continue to do so into his thirties and forties. It may be that Pitt had homosexual leanings but suppressed any urge to act on them for the sake of his ambitions. He could be charming to women, but it seems certain that he rejected intimacy whenever it was proffered—and would do so publicly at a later date. In practical terms it appears that Pitt was essentially asexual throughout his life.

==Legacy==

William Pitt the Younger was a prime minister who consolidated the powers of his office. Though he was sometimes opposed by members of his Cabinet, he helped define the role of the Prime Minister as the supervisor and co-ordinator of the various government departments. After his death the conservatives embraced him as a great patriotic hero.

One of Pitt&#x27;s accomplishments was a rehabilitation of the nation&#x27;s finances after the American War of Independence. Pitt made changes to the tax system in order to improve its capture of revenue, which helped manage the mounting national debt.

Some of Pitt&#x27;s domestic plans were not successful; he failed to secure parliamentary reform, emancipation, or the abolition of the slave trade although this last took place with the Slave Trade Act 1807, the year after his death. The 1792 Slave Trade Bill passed the House of Commons mangled and mutilated by the modifications and amendments of Pitt, it lay for years, in the House of Lords. Biographer William Hague considers the unfinished abolition of the slave trade to be Pitt&#x27;s greatest failure. He notes that by the end of Pitt&#x27;s career, conditions were in place that would have allowed a skillful attempt to pass an abolition bill to succeed, partly because of the long campaigning Pitt had encouraged with his friend William Wilberforce. Hague goes on to note that the failure was likely due to Pitt being a &quot;spent force&quot; by the time favourable conditions had arisen. In Hague&#x27;s opinion, Pitt&#x27;s long premiership, &quot;tested the natural limits of how long it is possible to be at the top. From 1783 to 1792, he faced each fresh challenge with brilliance; from 1793 he showed determination but sometimes faltered; and from 1804 he was worn down by ... the combination of a narrow majority and war&quot;.

Historian Marie Peters has compared his strengths and weaknesses with his father:
:Having some of his father&#x27;s volatility and much of the self-confidence bordering on arrogance, the younger Pitt inherited superb and carefully nurtured oratorical gifts. These gave him, like his father, unsurpassed command of the Commons and power to embody the national will in wartime. There were, however, significant differences. The younger Pitt&#x27;s eloquence, unlike his father&#x27;s, included the force of sustained reasoned exposition. This was perhaps in part expression of his thoroughly professional approach to politics, so unlike his father&#x27;s, but possibly deriving something from Shelburne. The younger Pitt was continuously engaged in depth with major issues of his day. He regularly and energetically sought the best information. He was genuinely progressive, as his father was not, on parliamentary reform, Catholic emancipation, commercial policy, and administrative reform. His constructive capacity in his chief responsibility, financial policy and administration, far surpassed his father&#x27;s record, if it was less impressive and perhaps more equally matched in foreign and imperial policy and strategy. With good reason, his long career in high office was the mirror image of his father&#x27;s short tenure. In contrast, only briefly was Chatham able to rise to the challenge of his age. By his last decade time had passed him by.

<doc id="79452" wikidata="Q44920" url="?curid=79452" title="Viruses of the Mind">
<text>&quot;Viruses of the Mind&quot; is an essay by British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, first published in the book &quot;Dennett and His Critics: Demystifying Mind&quot; (1993). Dawkins originally wrote the essay in 1991 and delivered it as a Voltaire Lecture on 6 November 1992 at the Conway Hall Humanist Centre. The essay discusses how religion can be viewed as a meme - an idea which Dawkins had previously expressed in &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; (1976). Dawkins analyzes the propagation of religious ideas and behaviors as a memetic virus, analogous to how biological and computer viruses spread. The essay was later published in &quot;A Devil&#x27;s Chaplain&quot; (2003), and its ideas are further explored in Dawkins&#x27;s documentary television programme &quot;The Root of All Evil?&quot; (2006).

==Content==

Dawkins lists possible &quot;symptoms&quot; of infection with a &quot;mind-virus&quot;
such as religion, providing examples for most of them, and tries to define a connection between the elements of religion and the religion&#x27;s survival value (invoking Zahavi&#x27;s handicap principle of sexual selection, applied to believers of a religion).
Dawkins also describes religious beliefs as &quot;mind parasites&quot;,
and as &quot;gangs [that] will come to constitute a package, which may be sufficiently stable to deserve a collective name such as Roman Catholicism ... or ... component parts to a single virus&quot;.

Dawkins suggests that religious belief in the &quot;faith-sufferer&quot; typically shows the following elements:
* It is impelled by some deep, inner conviction that something is true, or right, or virtuous: a conviction that doesn&#x27;t seem to owe anything to evidence or reason, but which, nevertheless, the believer feels as totally compelling and convincing.
* The believer typically makes a positive virtue of faith&#x27;s being strong and unshakable, despite it not being based upon evidence.
* There is a conviction that &quot;mystery&quot;, &quot;per se&quot;, is a good thing; the belief that it is not a virtue to solve mysteries but to enjoy them and revel in their insolubility.
* There may be intolerant behaviour towards perceived rival faiths, in extreme cases even the killing of opponents or advocating of their deaths. Believers may be similarly violent in disposition towards apostates or heretics, even if those espouse only a slightly different version of the faith.
* The particular convictions that the believer holds, while having nothing to do with evidence, are likely to resemble those of the believer&#x27;s parents.
* If the believer is one of the rare exceptions who follows a different religion from his parents, the explanation may be cultural transmission from a charismatic individual.
* The internal sensations of the &#x27;faith-sufferer&#x27; may be reminiscent of those more ordinarily associated with sexual love.

Dawkins stresses his claim that religious beliefs do not spread as a result of evidence in their support, but typically by cultural transmission, in most cases from parents or from charismatic individuals. He refers to this as involving &quot;epidemiology, not evidence&quot;. Further Dawkins distinguishes this process from the spread of scientific ideas, which, he suggests, is constrained by the requirement to conform with certain virtues of standard methodology: &quot;testability, evidential support, precision, quantifiability, consistency, intersubjectivity, repeatability, universality, progressiveness, independence of cultural milieu, and so on&quot;. He points out that faith &quot;spreads despite a total lack of every single one of these virtues&quot;.

==Critical reactions==
Alister McGrath, a Christian theologian, has commented critically on Dawkins&#x27; analysis, suggesting that &quot;memes have no place in serious scientific reflection&quot;, that there is strong evidence that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate intentional actions, that &quot;evolution&quot; of ideas is more Lamarckian than Darwinian, and suggests there is no evidence that epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas. McGrath also cites a meta-review of 100 studies and argues that &quot;If religion is reported as having a positive effect on human well-being by 79% of recent studies in the field, how can it conceivably be regarded as analogous to a virus?&quot;

<text>Abruzzo (, ; ; , &quot;Abbrìzze&quot; or &quot;Abbrèzze&quot; ; ), historically known as Abruzzi, is a region of Southern Italy with an area of 10,763 square km (4,156 sq mi) and a population of 1.3 million. It is divided into four provinces: L&#x27;Aquila, Teramo, Pescara, and Chieti. Its western border lies east of Rome. Abruzzo borders the region of Marche to the north, Lazio to the west and north-west, Molise to the south and the Adriatic Sea to the east. Geographically, Abruzzo is divided into a mountainous area in the west, which includes the highest massifs of the Apennines, such as the Gran Sasso d&#x27;Italia and the Maiella, and a coastal area in the east with beaches on the Adriatic Sea.

Abruzzo is considered a region of Southern Italy in terms of its culture, language, economy, and history, though in terms of physical geography, it is often considered part of Central Italy. The Italian Statistical Authority (ISTAT) deems it to be part of Southern Italy, partly because of Abruzzo&#x27;s historic association with the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

Almost half of the region&#x27;s territory is protected through national parks and nature reserves, more than any administrative region on the continent, leading it to be dubbed &quot;the greenest region in Europe.&quot; There are three national parks, one regional park, and 38 protected nature reserves. These ensure the survival of rare species, such as the golden eagle, the Abruzzo (or Abruzzese) chamois, the Apennine wolf and the Marsican brown bear. Abruzzo&#x27;s parks and reserves host 75% of Europe&#x27;s animal species. The region is also home to Calderone, one of Europe&#x27;s southernmost glaciers.

Nineteenth-century Italian diplomat and journalist (1853–1917) chose the adjectives &quot;forte e gentile&quot; (&quot;strong and kind&quot;) to capture what he saw as the character of the region and its people. &quot;Forte e gentile&quot; has since become the motto of the region.

==Provinces and politics==
===Provinces===
Abruzzo is divided into four administrative provinces:

===Politics===

Abruzzo is governed as a presidential representative democracy with a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the regional government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the regional council.

The regional government (&quot;Giunta regionale&quot;) is presided over by the president of the region (&quot;presidente della Regione&quot;) who is elected for a five-year term. The government is composed of the president and eight ministers (&quot;assessori&quot;), including a vice president (&quot;vicepresidente&quot;) and an undersecretary (&quot;sottosegretario&quot;).
==History==

=== Prehistory ===
==== Paleolithic ====
Although an earlier presence cannot be ruled out, findings in the region related to archaic humans date from up to around 700,000 years ago (Acheulean Culture). Thousands of flint tools and weapons have been collected on fluvial terraces (e.g. Madonna del Freddo at Chieti) and near former lakes (e.g. Valle Giumentina at Caramanico Terme and Valle Peligna at Popoli). These testify to the presence of different Homo species over time, ranging from Homo erectus and Neanderthals to modern humans. A site located at Popoli (Svolte di Popoli) also contained animal bones, which in that case was of a hippopotamus. The most important evidence of Neanderthals presence in the region was found in caves in Calascio and dates back to the Middle Paleolithic.

Significant evidence of Upper Paleolithic human populations has been found in various places, including the Fucino depression and Montebello di Bertona, the latter giving its name to a distinctive stoneworking technique called &quot;Bertonian&quot;.

==== Neolithic ====
After the Mesolithic transition, which was characterized by climate change and a lack of food resources, agriculture was introduced in Abruzzo by Neolithic farmers from the Middle East. A skeleton from Lama dei Peligni in the province of Chieti was dated back to 6,540 BC using radiometric dating.

In Abruzzo and Marche, villages typical of in the 5–6th millennium BC consisted of huts, and were generally located on fluvial terraces or hills overlooking rivers. In some cases they were defended by a moat. Caves were often used for rituals. They practiced agriculture, husbandry, hunting, fishing, and production of pottery, which was painted or decorated. Other older Neolithic cultures present in Abruzzo are called Impressed Ceramic and Catignano.

==== Metal Ages ====
The Bronze Age saw the spread of Apennine culture and Subapennine culture in central-southern Italy, including in Abruzzo. The former has been associated with pastoralism, and the latter with agriculture. During the Late Bronze Age, Proto-Villanovan culture emerged in Abruzzo.

There are sites of Iron Age necropoli at Fiorano (Loreto Aprutino&#x27;s &quot;frazione&quot;), Campovalano (Campli), Alfedena and Capestrano.

=== Ancient history ===
At the end of the Iron Age, Abruzzo was inhabited by different tribes, including those defined by ancient Roman tradition as Sabelli: Oscan-speaking Pentri, Carricini and Frentani, and, more generically, Osco-Umbrian Aequi, Praetutii, Vestini, Marrucini, Marsi and Peligni.

Considered strong warriors by ancient writers, they fought against the Romans in the Samnite Wars (from 343 to 290 BC). Some tribes accepted the alliance with the Romans, whereas others surrendered after the Samnite Wars. Following progressive Romanization, they supported the Romans and contributed to many victories in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. They fought again with Rome during the Social War (91–87 BC) to gain political rights and created the ephemeral state called Italia with Corfinio as the capital. After the Social War, they obtained Roman citizenship and in the Imperial period favoured economic activities such as trade and pastoralism. On the basis of a division by Augustus, the territory of what is now Abruzzo was part of &quot;Regio V Picenum&quot; and especially &quot;Regio IV Sabina et Samnium&quot;. Much later, the region corresponded to the Valeria province, according to Diocletian decisions, and was among the first to see the arrival of Christianity.

Evidence from archeological sites shows that many cities in Abruzzo date back to ancient times. Corfinio was known as Corfinium when it was the chief city of the Paeligni, and it became the capital of &quot;Italia&quot; against the Romans during the Social War. Today&#x27;s Chieti has been inhabited since the Chalcolithic era, and was an important center of Marrucini (Teate Marrucinorum). Atri was known as Hatria and Teramo was known variously in ancient times as Interamnia and Teramne. Pinna (today Penne), Anxanum (Lanciano), Hortona (Ortona), Histonium (Vasto), Sulmona and Marruvium (San Benedetto dei Marsi) are among the settlements that are still inhabited, while others are no longer so, such as Cluviae near Casoli.

=== Middle Ages ===
The region was known as Aprutium in the Middle Ages and, according to a hypothesis, it is a combination of Praetutium, or rather of the name of the people, Praetutii, applied to their chief city, Interamnia, the old Teramo.

==== Early Middle Ages ====

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Gothic War between the Byzantine Empire and the Ostrogothic Kingdom, looting and devastation of monasteries and towns followed the arrival of Germanic Lombards in the region. Around 572, the Lombards divided Abruzzo into the Duchy of Benevento and of Spoleto, with Faroald I of Spoleto becoming the first Duke of Spoleto. His successor, Ariulf of Spoleto, annexed other territories: the former territories controlled by Aequi, Marsi, Peligni and Vestini. In the 8th century, Transamund II of Spoleto rebelled against Liutprand, King of the Lombards, but was able to recover his duchy and also to include other remaining territories of former Valeria province.

After the beginning of domination by the Franks, in 801, Teate (today&#x27;s Chieti) also passed from the Lombardic Duchy of Benevento to the Frankish Duchy of Spoleto. In 843, some territories were separated from the duchy (all the region together with the district of Rieti and except that of Teramo according to &quot;Liber provincialis&quot;), with Celano as capital. So counts of Marsi from different lineages ruled &quot;Marsia&quot; from 843 to 926. In 871, Louis II of Italy founded, as the Carolingian Emperor, a monastery, which would become very powerful in the history of Abruzzo (Abbey of San Clemente a Casauria). With the rule of Hugh of Italy from 926, the territories were divided: Penne and Teate to , and today&#x27;s province of L&#x27;Aquila to Berardo.

==== Kingdom of Sicily ====

After two attempted conquests from two Norman princes of Capua in Abruzzo, two other Normans, Robert Guiscard and Robert I of Loritello, conquered Teate, Valva and Penne. Later, all Abruzzo was definitively conquered by Norman Roger II of Sicily, and in 1156 his son William I of Sicily had these victories officially recognized by Pope Adrian IV. 

As part of the Kingdom of Sicily, Abruzzo was involved in the conflicts following the death of William II of Sicily in 1189, and the territories sided with Constance, Queen of Sicily and Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, but after the death of the former in 1198, they were invaded by Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor. They were also involved in the conflicts between Frederick II (son of Queen Costance) and Pope Gregory IX, including the War of the Keys. The administrative region of Abruzzo was formed in the 1230s, when Frederick II divided his realms into justiciarates, with Abruzzo forming one of them. 

The newly founded L&#x27;Aquila was destroyed by Manfred, King of Sicily (son of Frederick II) in 1259, and supported in the Battle of Tagliacozzo (1268) the defeat of his nephew Conradin against Charles I of Anjou, the new king of Sicily. Since the last half of the 13th century, L&#x27;Aquila took a central role in the region. Abruzzo was divided into &quot;Abruzzo Citra&quot; (nearer Abruzzo) and &quot;Abruzzo Ultra&quot; (further Abruzzo) by Charles I of Anjou in the 1270s.

=== Kingdom of Naples ===
After the rebellion called Sicilian Vespers and the subsequent war, in 1302 the Peace of Caltabellotta divided the former Kingdom of Sicily as follows: Sicily to the Crown of Aragon and the Southern Italian Peninsula (including Abruzzo) still to the Capetian House of Anjou.

The region was profoundly affected during the wars that followed a conspiracy which resulted in the assassination of Andrew, Duke of Calabria, the husband of Queen Joanna I of Naples. Different towns (L&#x27;Aquila, Penne, Chieti, Lanciano, Ortona) sided at first with the brother of the victim, Louis I of Hungary. In 1443, Alfonso V of Aragon, King of Sicily, conquered the Kingdom of Naples. In the same years, Abruzzo saw many battles, including the ones associated with the War of L&#x27;Aquila. Under the Aragonese rulers, L&#x27;Aquila started to become a military center, giving up its political and economic importance to Chieti. This period was characterized by economic decline and the spread of brigandage, but coastal centers were favored by trade with the Republic of Venice&#x27;s overseas territories.

Shortly after the Italian War of 1494–1495 carried out by Charles VIII of France, the Kingdom of Naples returned to Ferdinand II of Aragon. In this and in the following conflict between the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Spain over the Kingdom of Naples, Abruzzo sided with France, but Spain won in 1503 and started to dominate the Kingdom of Naples with its viceroys.

In Abruzzo, the aristocracy vainly tried to regain more control when there was a rebellion in the Kingdom of Naples led by a fisherman named Masaniello in 1647.

At the beginning of the 18th century, the region was affected by destructive earthquakes, which also devastated L&#x27;Aquila (1703 Apennine earthquakes) and Sulmona (1706 Abruzzo earthquake), and the War of the Spanish Succession, with the Austrian siege at Pescara in 1707. In 1734, Charles III of the  House of Bourbon, King of Spain, ended the short Hasburg Austrian domination, which contributed to large land concentrations in Abruzzo.

=== French invasions ===
In accordance with a general diffidence against the Enlightenment ideas, the Abruzzo population of different social classes rebelled in an improvised way against French invasion in 1798 and 1799. After the proclamation of the ephemeral Parthenopean Republic, they continued to be hostile to French invaders (&quot;Sanfedismo&quot;).

During the client kingdom (1806–1815) of Napoleon, in 1806, Abruzzo Ultra was divided into two, as Abruzzo Ultra I and Abruzzo Ultra II (being divided at the Gran Sasso d&#x27;Italia); the same Citra/Ultra I/Ultra II scheme was used for Calabria.

=== Kingdom of Two Sicilies ===

The return of the Bourbons was granted by the Congress of Vienna, while Abruzzo was plagued by decline and brigandage. The House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies established the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1816, and ruled until Italian unification (also known as the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;).

=== Italian unification ===

Many rebelled again in 1821, 1841 and 1848, but the ideologies of insurgents were different, and included liberal, Jacobin, or reactionary ideas. During the unification of Italy, in 1860, Abruzzo became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia and, in 1861, the Kingdom of Italy. Some supporters of the Bourbons fought against volunteers of Garibaldi, and later banded with simple criminals to participate for political reasons in brigandage, which would be eradicated years later. However, many accepted the new order with neither enthusiasm nor opposition.

Since 1870, due to its economic conditions, Abruzzo saw massive emigration to other regions and countries, which contributed to Italian diaspora.

=== Fascism and World War II ===
During the Italian fascism period, Pescara became an important center for its homonymous port, tourism and trade. With the Second World War, Abruzzo was on the Gustav Line, part of the German Winter Line. One of the most brutal battles was the Battle of Ortona. Abruzzo was the location of two prisoners of war camps, Campo 21 in Chieti, and Campo 78 in Sulmona. The Sulmona camp also served as a POW camp in World War I; much of the facility is still intact and attracts tourists interested in military history.

=== Italian Republic ===
Despite the high level of destructions and victims caused by the Second World War, there was remarkable development in the second half of the 20th century, which particularly favored Fucino and Adriatic coastal areas.

In the 1948 Italian Constitution, these were unified with Molise into the Abruzzi e Molise region, though in the first draft Abruzzo and Molise were separate, and in 1963 Abruzzi e Molise was separated into the two regions of Abruzzo and Molise. Abruzzo Citeriore is now the province of Chieti. The province of Teramo and province of Pescara now comprise what was Abruzzo Ulteriore I. Abruzzo Ulteriore II is now the province of L&#x27;Aquila.

==Geography==
Geographically, Abruzzo is nearly at the center of Italian peninsula, stretching from the heart of the Apennines to the Adriatic Sea, and includes mainly mountainous and wild land. The mountainous land is occupied by a vast plateau, including Gran Sasso, at the highest peak of the Apennines, and Mount Majella at . The Adriatic coastline is characterized by long sandy beaches to the North and pebbly beaches to the South. Abruzzo is well known for its landscapes and natural environment, parks and nature reserves, characteristic hillside areas rich in vineyards and olive groves. Many beaches have been awarded the Blue Flag beach status.

===Climate===
In Abruzzo there are two climatic zones. The coastal strip and sub-Apennine hills have a climate markedly different from that of the mountainous interior. Coastal areas have a Mediterranean climate with hot dry summers and mild winters. Inland hilly areas have a sublittoral climate with temperatures decreasing progressively with increasing altitude. Precipitation is also strongly affected by the presence of the Apennines mountain range. Rainfall is abundant on slopes oriented to the west, and lower in east and east-facing slopes. The Adriatic coast is shielded from rainfall by the barrier effect created by the Apennines. The minimum annual rainfall is found in some inland valleys, sheltered by mountain ranges, such as Peligna or Tirino (Ofena, Capestrano), where as little as were recorded. Rainfall along the coast almost always never falls below . Pescara has relatively less rainfall (about ) than Chieti (about ). The highest rainfall occurs in upland areas on the border with Lazio; they are especially vulnerable to Atlantic disturbances. Around of precipitation is typical.

==Flora and fauna==


The flora of Abruzzo is typically Mediterranean. Along the coastal belt Mediterranean shrubland Is the dominant natural vegetation, with species including myrtle, heather and mastic. Inland are found olive, pine, willow, oak, poplar, alder, arbutus, broom, acacia, capers, rosemary, hawthorn, licorice and almond trees, interspersed with oak trees. At elevations between there is sub-montane vegetation, with mixed woodlands of oak and turkey oak, maple and hornbeam; shrubs include dog rose and red juniper. Elevations between are dominated by beech. In the Apennine Mountains at elevations above species include alpine orchid, mountain juniper, silver fir, black cranberry and the Abruzzo edelweiss.

The fauna of Abruzzo is very diverse, including the region&#x27;s symbol, the Abruzzo chamois (&quot;Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata&quot;), which has recovered from near-extinction. Common species include Marsican brown bear, Italian wolf, deer, lynx, roe deer, snow vole, fox, porcupine, wild cat, wild boar, badger, otter, and viper.

The natural parks of the region are the Abruzzo National Park, the Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park, the Maiella National Park and the Sirente-Velino Regional Park, as well as many other natural reserves and protected areas.

In 2017, the ancient beech forests of the Abruzzo Lazio and Molise National Park of Europe were recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, with the region thus gaining its first prestigious site.

==Economy==

Until a few decades ago, Abruzzo was a backward region of Southern Italy. Since the 1950s, Abruzzo has showed steady economic growth. In 1951, per capita income or GDP was 53% of that of wealthier Northern Italy. The gap has since narrowed, being 65% in 1971 and 76% by 1994. The region reached the highest per capita GDP of Southern Italy through the highest growth rate of every other region of Italy. The unemployment rate stood at 9.3% in 2020.

Abruzzo is the 16th most productive region in the country, and is the 15th for GRP per capita among Italian regions.

As of 2003, Abruzzo&#x27;s per capita GDP was €19,506 or 84% of the national average of €23,181, compared to the average value for Southern Italy of €15,808. In 2006, the region&#x27;s average GDP per capita was approximately 20,100 EUR. The construction of motorways from Rome to Teramo (A24) and Rome to Pescara (A25), which provided better access to the region, is credited as a driver of public and private investments.

The 2009 L&#x27;Aquila earthquake led to a sharp economic slowdown. However, according to statistics at the end of 2010, some signals of recovery were noted. Regional economic growth was recorded as 1.47%, which actually placed Abruzzo fourth among Italy&#x27;s regions after Lazio, Lombardy and Calabria. In 2011, Abruzzo&#x27;s economic growth was +2.3%, the highest percentage among the regions of Southern Italy. 

=== Industry ===
From the early 1950s to the mid-1990s, Abruzzo&#x27;s industrial sector expanded rapidly, especially in mechanical engineering, transportation equipment and telecommunications. The structure of production in the region reflects the transformation of the economy from agriculture to industry and services. The industrial sector relies on few large enterprises and the predominance of small and medium enterprises. In the applied research field, there are major institutes and enterprises involved in the fields of pharmaceutics, biomedicine, electronics, aerospace and nuclear physics. The industrial infrastructure is dispersed throughout the region in industrial zones. The most important of these are: Val Pescara, Val di Sangro, Val Trigno, Val Vibrata and Conca del Fucino.

The province of Teramo is one of the most industrialized areas of Italy and of the region, with numerous small and medium-sized companies, then follows the province of Chieti and that of Pescara, which is also supported by tourism; the Val Vibrata (province of Teramo), on the border with the Marche region, is home to a myriad of small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the textile and footwear sectors. The Val di Sangro (province of Chieti), on the other hand, is home to important multinationals and a factory belonging to the Fiat (Sevel) group. The area of Valle Peligna (province of L&#x27;Aquila) is also home to industries (the famous one of Sulmona sugared almonds), while other areas such as Pescara and Theatine are home to numerous industries, including multinationals (for example De Cecco, Procter &amp; Gamble, Monti &amp; Ambrosini Editori, Brioni, Ennedue and Miss Sixty, mostly concentrated in the industrial district of Val Pescara in the province of Chieti).

===Agriculture===

Agriculture, based on small holdings, has modernised and produces high-quality products. The mostly small-scale producers are active in wine, cereals, sugar beet, potatoes, olives, vegetables, fruit and dairy products. Traditional products are saffron and liquorice. By the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Montepulciano d&#x27;Abruzzo, the region&#x27;s most famous wine, had become one of the most widely exported DOC-classed wines in Italy.

The region produces about 850,000 quintals of fruit, 5 million quintals of vegetables, 1,600,000 quintals of potatoes, and 5,000,000 quintals of grapes, produced both for eating and for winemaking; the latter is estimated at between 3 and 4 million hectoliters, with the production of wines such as Montepulciano d&#x27;Abruzzo in the red and cerasuolo (rosé) varieties, Trebbiano d&#x27;Abruzzo, Pecorino and the Chardonnay; oil production, on the other hand, stands at 1,350,000 quintals of olives and 240,000 quintals of oil (&quot;Aprutino Pescarese&quot;, &quot;Pretuziano delle Colline Teramane&quot; and &quot;Colline Teatine&quot;), figures that put Abruzzo in sixth place among the Italian regions; as regards cereals, the durum wheat with over 1.5 million quintals constitutes the main cereal, followed by soft wheat (one million quintals), then barley (0.5 million quintals ); other crops are also grown, among them beetroot (2,500,000 quintals), and tobacco (45,000 quintals).

===Tourism===
Tourism is an important economic sector; in the past decade, tourism has increased, mainly centered on its national parks and natural reserves, ski and beach resorts, in particular along the Trabocchi Coast. Abruzzo&#x27;s castles and medieval towns, especially in the area of L&#x27;Aquila, have led to the creation of the nickname of &quot;Abruzzoshire&quot;, along Tuscany&#x27;s &quot;Chiantishire&quot;. In spite of this, Abruzzo is still &quot;off the beaten path&quot; for most visitors to Italy.

Very popular with visitors from all over Italy and Europe are the natural parks of the region, such as Parco Nazionale d&#x27;Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise, Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park, Maiella National Park, and regional park Sirente Velino Regional Park which every year see thousands of visitors attracted by their unspoiled nature and rare wild fauna and flora species such as Abruzzo chamois, with the region boasting many reserves and protected natural areas and lakes (Campotosto Lake and Lago di Scanno). 
In the inland mountain areas there are the ski resorts of Scanno, Ovindoli, Pescasseroli, Roccaraso, Campo Imperatore, Campo Felice, Rivisondoli, Pescocostanzo and Pianoro Campitelli where winter tourism is highly developed and then you can play sports such as alpine skiing, snowboarding, ski mountaineering, ski touring, cross-country skiing and dog sledding. Other trails and facilities are in Passolanciano-Majelletta, Campo Rotondo, Campo di Giove, Piani di pezza, Voltigno, Centomonti, Macchiarvana, Monte Piselli where winter tourism is highly developed and then you can play sports such as alpine skiing, snowboarding, ski mountaineering, ski touring, cross-country skiing and dog sledding.
Also of considerable importance is the summer coastal and seaside tourism, which sees the presence of numerous tourist bathing establishments equipped in various centers of the coast such as Montesilvano, Pineto, Roseto degli Abruzzi, Giulianova, Alba Adriatica, Tortoreto, Francavilla al Mare, Ortona, Vasto, Martinsicuro, Silvi Marina and the Trabocchi Coast.

Finally, tourism for historical and cultural purposes is also important, concentrated above all in the cities of Lanciano, Chieti, Teramo, Vasto, Giulianova, Sulmona, and above all L&#x27;Aquila which can boast many monuments, museums, castles and churches (St. Gabriel&#x27;s shrine and Santa Maria di Collemaggio) of national importance; also Pescara despite being a modern city, boasts monuments, churches and museums of historical importance such as the Birthplace of Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio Museum. In the inland mountain areas there are ancient villages, castles, hermitages, sanctuaries abbeys, and ancient churches.

Abruzzo has many small and picturesque villages, 26 of them have been selected by (), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities. These villages are:

* Abbateggio
* Anversa degli Abruzzi
* Bugnara
* Campli
* Caramanico Terme
* Casoli
* Castel del Monte
* Castelli
* Città Sant&#x27;Angelo
* Civitella del Tronto
* Crecchio
* Guardiagrele
* Navelli
* Opi
* Pacentro
* Palena
* Penne
* Pescocostanzo
* Pettorano sul Gizio
* Pietracamela
* Pretoro
* Rocca San Giovanni
* Santo Stefano di Sessanio
* Scanno
* Tagliacozzo
* Villalago

==Demographics==
Although the population density of Abruzzo has increased over recent decades, it is still well below the Italian national average: in 2008, 123.4 inhabitants per km2, compared to 198.8. In the provinces, the density varies: Pescara is the most densely populated with 260.1 inhabitants per km2, whereas L&#x27;Aquila is the least densely populated with 61.3 inhabitants per km2, although it has the largest area. After decades of emigration from the region, the main feature of the 1980s is immigration from third world countries. The population increase is due to the positive net migration. Since 1991 more deaths than births were registered in Abruzzo (except for 1999, when their numbers were equal). In 2008, the Italian national institute of statistics ISTAT estimated that 59,749 foreign-born immigrants live in Abruzzo, equal to 4.5% of the total regional population.

The most serious demographic imbalance is between the mountainous areas of the interior and the coastal strip. The largest province, L&#x27;Aquila, is situated entirely in the interior and has the lowest population density. The movement of the population of Abruzzo from the mountains to the sea has led to the almost complete urbanization of the entire coastal strip especially in the province of Teramo and Chieti. The effects on the interior have been impoverishment and demographic aging, reflected by an activity rate in the province of L&#x27;Aquila which is the lowest among the provinces in Abruzzo – accompanied by geological degradation as a result of the absence of conservation measures. In the coastal strip, however, there is such a jumble of accommodations and activities that the environment has been negatively affected. The policy of providing incentives for development has resulted in the setting-up of industrial zones, some of which (Vasto, Avezzano, Carsoli, Gissi, Val Vibrata, Val di Sangro) have made genuine progress, while others (Val Pescara, L&#x27;Aquila) have run into trouble after their initial success. The zones of Sulmona and Guardiagrele have turned out to be more or less failures. Outside these zones, the main activities are agriculture and tourism.
In 2016, the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; placed Abruzzo in fifth position among the 12 best regions in the world for quality of life.
===Main settlements===
L&#x27;Aquila is both the capital city of the Abruzzo region and of the Province of L&#x27;Aquila and second largest city (pop. 73,000). L&#x27;Aquila was hit by an earthquake on 6 April 2009, which destroyed much of the city center. The other provincial capitals are Pescara, which is Abruzzo&#x27;s largest city and major port (pop. 123,000); Teramo (pop. 55,000) and Chieti (pop. 55,000). Other large municipalities in Abruzzo include the industrial and high tech center Avezzano (pop. 41,000), as well as three important industrial and touristic centers such as Vasto (pop. 40,636), Lanciano (pop. 36,000), and Sulmona (pop. 25,000).

== Transport ==
=== Airports ===
*Abruzzo International Airport is the only international airport in the region. Open to civilian traffic since 1996, the number of passengers has increased over the years because of low-cost air carriers&#x27; use of the facility. Today, the airport has a catchment area of over 500,000 passengers annually.
*L&#x27;Aquila-Preturo Airport is located near L&#x27;Aquila, but remains underused.

=== Ports ===
There are four main ports in Abruzzo: Pescara, Ortona, Vasto and Giulianova.

Over the years, the Port of Pescara has become one of the most important tourist ports of Italy and the Adriatic Sea. Heavily damaged in World War II, it underwent major renovations for some sixty years. It now consists of a modern marina with advanced moorings and shipbuilding facilities. It has been awarded the European Union&#x27;s blue flag for its services. The port of Pescara has lost passenger traffic because of its shallowness and silting, but its fishery and aquaculture activities are thriving.

===Railways===
There is a significant disparity between the railways of the Abruzzo coast and the inland areas, which badly need modernization to improve the service, in particular, the Rome-Pescara line.

Existing railway lines:

* Adriatic railway runs through the whole of Italy from north to south, along the Adriatic Sea.
* Rome – Sulmona – Pescara
* Sulmona – Carpinone
* Sulmona–Terni railway
* Avezzano railroad – Roccasecca
* Giulianova – Teramo
* Sangritana (Lanciano – Castel di Sangro)

===Highways===
There are three highways that serve the region:
* A24 (Rome – L&#x27;Aquila – Teramo) was built in the 1970s and connects Rome with the Adriatic coast in less than two hour-drive. The Gran Sasso tunnel, the longest road tunnel entirely on Italian territory, was opened in 1984.
* A25 (Torano – Avezzano – Pescara) connects Rome with Pescara. The road branches off A24 in Torano, spans the Fucino basin, crosses the Apennines, and merges with A14 near Pescara.
* A14 Bologna – Taranto known as the &quot;Adriatica&quot;, includes of dual-carriage motorway between Bologna and Taranto.

==Culture==

The museum Museo Archeologico Nazionale d&#x27;Abruzzo in Chieti houses the famed statue &quot;Warrior of Capestrano&quot; which was found in a necropolis of the 6th century BC. Across the region, among the prominent cultural and historical buildings are: Teramo Cathedral, its archeological museum and the Roman theater, the Castello della Monica, the Collurania-Teramo Observatory, the famous L&#x27;Aquila Basilica of Santa Maria di Collemaggio (which holds the remains of Pope Celestine V), the Museo Nazionale d&#x27;Abruzzo, Santa Maria del Suffragio, the Forte Spagnolo, the Fountain of 99 Spouts, Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s house in Pescara, Campli&#x27;s Scala Sancta and its church, the church of Santissima Annunziata in Sulmona, the cathedrals of Chieti, Lanciano, Guardiagrele, Atri and Pescara along with the castles of Ortona, Celano and Ortucchio.
Every year on 28–29 August, L&#x27;Aquila&#x27;s Santa Maria di Collemaggio commemorates the Perdonanza Celestiniana, the indulgence issued by Pope Celestine V to anyone who, &quot;truly repentant and confessed&quot; would visit that Church from the Vespers of the vigil to the vespers of 29 August. Sulmona&#x27;s Holy Week is commemorated with traditional celebrations and rituals, such as &quot;La Madonna che scappa in piazza&quot;, when a large statue of the Mary, carried by a group of local fraternities, is carried across the square in procession. Cocullo, in the province of L&#x27;Aquila, holds the annual &quot;Festa dei serpari&quot; (festival of snake handlers) in which a statue of St. Dominic, covered with live snakes, is carried in a procession through the town; it attracts thousands of Italian and foreign visitors. In many Abruzzo villages, Anthony the Great&#x27;s feast is celebrated in January with massive and scenic bonfires. 

In the past, the region of Abruzzo was well known for the transumanza, the seasonal movement of sheep floks: these used to travel mostly southbound towards the region of Puglia during the cold winter months. The Feast of St. Biagio, protector of wool dealers is celebrated across the region. On the third of February in Taranta Peligna every year since the sixteenth century an evocative ritual is held: &quot;panicelle&quot;, or small loaves made of flour and water, in the shape of a blessing hand, are distributed among the faithful.
Historical figures from the region include: the Roman orator Asinius Pollio; Latin poets Sallust and Ovid, who were born in L&#x27;Aquila and Sulmona respectively, Gaius Cassius Longinus, Roman senator and leading instigator of the plot to kill Julius Caesar. Pontius Pilate is said to have been native to the region. Abruzzo&#x27;s religious personalities include Saint Berardo; John of Capistrano; Thomas of Celano, author of three hagiographies of Saint Francis of Assisi; and Alessandro Valignano, who introduced Catholicism to the Far East and Japan. The Polish Pope John Paul II loved the mountains of Abruzzo, where he would retire often and pray in the church of San Pietro della Ienca. Local personalities in the humanities include: poet Ignazio Silone, movie director Ennio Flaiano who co-wrote &quot;La dolce vita&quot;, philosopher Benedetto Croce, poet Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, composer Paolo Tosti, sculptor Venanzo Crocetti and artist LorenzoArs.

American artists and celebrities such as: Dean Martin, Perry Como, Henry Mancini, Nancy Pelosi, Rocky Marciano, Rocky Mattioli, Bruno Sammartino, Mario Batali, John and Dan Fante, Tommy Lasorda, Dan Marino, Mario Lanza, Garry Marshall, Penny Marshall, Ariana Grande, and Al Martino trace part of their family roots to Abruzzo.

Some international movies shot in Abruzzo include &quot;The American&quot;, Jean-Jacques Annaud&#x27;s &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Strada&quot; and &quot;I Vitelloni&quot;, Schwarzenegger&#x27;s &quot;Red Sonja&quot;, &quot;Ladyhawke&quot;, &quot;King David&quot;, &quot;Francesco&quot;, &quot;Keoma&quot;, &quot;The Barbarians&quot;, &quot;The Fox and the Child&quot; and &quot;Krull&quot;.

===Medieval and Renaissance hill towns===
Before the 2009 earthquake, Abruzzo was the region with the highest number of castles and hill towns in Italy. It still holds many of Italy&#x27;s best-preserved medieval and Renaissance hill towns, twenty-three of which are among &quot;I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia&quot;. This listing recognises their scenic beauty, arts and culture, their historical importance and quality of life.

The abrupt decline of Abruzzo&#x27;s agricultural economy in the early to mid-20th-century spared some of the region&#x27;s historic hill towns from modern development. Many lie entirely within regional and national parks. Among the most well preserved are Castel del Monte and Santo Stefano di Sessanio, within the Gran Sasso National Park on the edge of the high plain of Campo Imperatore and nestled beneath the Apennines&#x27; highest peaks. Both hill towns, which were ruled by the Medicis for over a century-and-a-half, see relatively little tourism. Between the two towns sits Rocca Calascio, the ruin of an ancient fortress popular with filmmakers. Both Monteferrante and Roccascalegna are two of the most representative Abruzzo villages in the province of Chieti. Within the Gran Sasso National Park is also found Castelli, an ancient pottery center whose artisans produced ceramics for most of the royal houses of Europe.
Civitella del Tronto played a crucial role in the history of the unification of Italy. The fortress of Civitella is the most visited monument in the Abruzzo region today. Other medieval hill towns located within Abruzzo&#x27;s park system are Pacentro in the Maiella National Park and Pescasseroli in the Abruzzo National Park. Pacentro, which features a 14th-century castle with two intact towers, has been little touched by modernisation. The Shrine of Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows, in the province of Teramo, which attracts some two million visitors per year, is one of the 15 most-visited sanctuaries in the world. Capestrano, a small town in the province of L&#x27;Aquila, is the hometown of Saint John of Capistrano, Franciscan friar and Catholic priest, as well as the namesake of the Franciscan missions San Juan Capistrano in Southern California, the mission Mission San Juan Capistrano in Texas and the city of San Juan Capistrano in Orange County, California. Giulianova is a notable example of a Renaissance &quot;ideal city&quot;.

The proximity to Rome, the protected areas and scenic landscapes making the region one of the greenest in Europe, the presence of quaint villages, its rich and varied culinary traditions are important tourist attractions. In 2010, visitors included 6,381,067 Italians and 925,884 foreign tourists.

In 2015, the American organization Live and Invest Overseas included Abruzzo on its list of World&#x27;s Top 21 Overseas Retirement Havens. The study was based on such factors as climate, infrastructure, health care, safety, taxes, cost of living and more. In 2017 the Chamber of Commerce of Pescara presented Abruzzo region to the Annual conference of Live and Invest Overseas in the U.S. city of Orlando, Florida. One year later, in October 2018, Live and Invest Overseas held its first conference in Abruzzo.

=== Universities ===

There are three universities in the Abruzzo region:
* University of L&#x27;Aquila

===Dialects===
The regional dialects of Abruzzo include &quot;Teramano&quot;, &quot;Abruzzese Orientale Adriatico&quot; and &quot;Abruzzese Occidentale&quot;. The first two forms are a dialect of the Southern Italian language also known simply as Neapolitan since the region has been part of the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, while &quot;Aquilano&quot; is related to the Central Italian dialects including Romanesco.
The dialects spoken in the Abruzzo region can be divided into three main groups:
# Sabine dialect, in the province of L&#x27;Aquila, a central Italian dialect
# Abruzzo Adriatic dialect, in the province of Teramo, Pescara and Chieti, that is virtually abandoned in the province of Ascoli Piceno, a southern Italian dialect
# Abruzzo western dialect, in the province of L&#x27;Aquila, a southern Italian dialect

==Cuisine==

Abruzzo&#x27;s cuisine is renowned for its variety and richness. Both the agricultural and coastal areas of Abruzzo have contributed to its cuisine. Due to the mountains, much of Abruzzo was relatively isolated until the 20th century. This has contributed to preservIng local culinary traditions.

===Ingredients===

In terms of common ingredients, cuisine in Abruzzo often includes:
* Lamb and mutton, primarily in the mountains. Sheep&#x27;s milk (or ricotta) is an important source of Abruzzese cheese, and lamb intestines are used as sausage casing or for stuffed meat rolls. Mountain goat meat is also common in Abruzzo.
* Truffles and mushrooms, particularly wild mushrooms from the forests and hills 
* Garlic, especially red garlic
* Rosemary
* Hot chili pepper or peperoncini, regionally known as &quot;diavolilli&quot; or &quot;diavoletti&quot;, is common in Abruzzese cuisine and often used to add spice to dishes. Abruzzo residents are well known for frequently adding peperoncini, or hot peppers, to their meals. 
* Vegetables such as lentils, grasspeas and other legumes, artichoke, eggplant, and cauliflower

===Starter and main dishes===
* &quot;Spaghetti alla chitarra&quot; which is made by pressing or cutting pasta through a &quot;chitarra&quot;, an implement to form long thin noodles similar to spaghetti. The pasta is served with a tomato-based sauce, often flavored with peppers, pork, goose, or lamb. This dish is complemented by regional side dishes, such as the bean and noodle soup, &quot;sagne e fagioli&quot;. This soup is traditionally flavored with tomatoes, garlic, oil, and peperoncini.
* &quot;&quot;, flavored with bacon, eggs and pecorino cheese
*&quot;Scrippelle&quot;, a rustic French-style crêpe served either &quot;&quot; (a type of soup) or used to form a sort of soufflé with some ragù and stuffed with chicken liver, meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, and cheese
* &quot;Pastuccia&quot;, a polenta stew with sausage, eggs, and cheese
* &quot;Pasta allo sparone&quot;, a pasta roll filled with ricotta cheese and spinach. The pasta roll is boiled in hot water and served with tomato sauce and Parmesan cheese.
* &quot;Pasta alla mugnaia,&quot; a long, uneven and thick type of pasta that is hand-pulled to a diameter of up to 6mm and is traditionally served with tomato sauce. Pasta alla mugnaia, also simply known as &quot;mugnaia&quot;, is the flagship dish of the town of Elice.

* &quot;Porchetta abruzzese&quot;: moist boneless-pork roast, slow-roasted with rosemary, garlic, and pepper

===Seafood===
Seafood is also popular, especially in coastal areas. The variety of fish available locally resulted in several fish-based &quot;brodetti&quot; (&quot;broths&quot;), coming from such places as Vasto, Giulianova, and Pescara. These broths are often made by cooking fish, flavored with tomatoes, herbs, and peperoncino, in an earthenware pot. Other fish products are &quot;scapece alla vastese&quot;, baccalà all&#x27;abruzzese, and &quot;coregone di Campotosto&quot;, typical lake fish.

<text>Campobasso (, ; ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in southern Italy, the capital of the region of Molise and of the province of Campobasso. It is located in the high basin of the Biferno river, surrounded by Sannio and Matese mountains.

Campobasso is renowned for the craftsmanship of blades (including scissors and knives), a fact well documented since the 14th century. It is also famous for the production of pears and scamorza (cheese). The city is home of the University of Molise and of the Archdiocese of Campobasso-Boiano.

==History==

The origins of Campobasso are disputed. According to the most widely held theory, the city was founded by the Lombards before the 8th century as a fortified camp on the slope of the hill where the castle stands. The original name was &quot;Campus vassorum&quot;, suggesting that the city was the seat of the vassals of the duke of Spoleto.

After the Norman conquest of Southern Italy, Campobasso lost its importance as a defensive stronghold, but became a significant trading and administration centre.

From 1330 to 1745 the city was ruled by the Monforte-Gambatesa family, who built the castle and established a mint. Later it came under the control of the Di Capua, Gonzaga, Vitagliano, Carafa and Romano families.

The original old town of Campobasso contains the Castello Monforte, although in 1732 the inhabitants built a new town on a lower-level plain. In 1763 the citizens abandoned the old city and settled in the lower valley. The current city was expanded in 1814 by the king of Naples Joachim Murat, and lies on the &quot;Campo Basso&quot; (&quot;Low field&quot;).

Campobasso was the scene of heavy fighting during the Second World War. In the months of October and November 1943 a battle between the German and the Canadian troops for possession of the city caused the destruction of many public buildings, including the City Hall and the archives held there. Thirty eight civilians were killed in the action, including the bishop of the diocese, Bishop Secondo Bologna, and an unknown number of people were injured in the intensive bombardment. The occupation by the Canadian troops, and the administrative and political control resulting, had such an impact on the town that it became known as &quot;Canada Town&quot; or &quot;Maple Leaf City&quot;.

In 1995 the city was awarded the Bronze Medal for Civil Valour in recognition of the hard work done in clearing the region of dangerous unexploded warheads, a task that lasted well into 1948.

==Main sights==
One of the main attractions of Campobasso is the &quot;Castello Monforte&quot;, built in 1450 by the local ruler Nicola II Monforte, over Lombard or Norman ruins. The castle has Guelph merlons and stands on a commanding point, where traces of ancient settlements (including Samnite walls) have been found. The current construction is the result of later rebuilding after the earthquakes of 1456 and 1805.

Next to the castle is the &quot;Chiesa della Madonna del Monte&quot; (Santa Maria Maggiore), erected in the 11th century and rebuilt in 1525. It houses a precious wooden statue of the &quot;Incoronata&quot; from 1334. Below the castle, the church of St. George is probably the oldest in Campobasso, built around the year 1000 AD over the ruins of a Pagan temple.

The Cathedral, or &quot;Chiesa della Santissima Trinità&quot; (Church of the Holy Trinity), was built in 1504 outside the city walls. It was destroyed by an earthquake in 1805 and a new Neoclassical edifice was built in 1829.

The church of &quot;San Bartolomeo&quot; is a Romanesque building from the 11th century, in limestone. The interior has a nave and two aisles.

&quot;San Leonardo&quot; (14th century) has a façade mixing Gothic and Romanesque elements, and a side mullioned window with vegetable decorations influenced by the Apulian architecture of the period.

&quot;Villa de Capoa&quot;, recently restored, is a noteworthy garden with statues and a wide variety of plant species, including sequoias, Norway Spruces, cypresses and Lebanon Cedars.

<text>Gelert () is a legendary hound in a Welsh folk-tale. He is associated with the village of Beddgelert in Gwynedd in north-west Wales, the name of which was formerly believed to mean &quot;Gelert&#x27;s grave&quot;. In the legend, Llywelyn the Great returns from hunting to find his baby missing, the cradle overturned, and Gelert with a blood-smeared mouth. Believing the dog had devoured the child, Llywelyn draws his sword and kills Gelert. After the dog&#x27;s dying yelp, Llywelyn hears the cries of the baby, unharmed under the cradle, along with a dead wolf which had attacked the child and been killed by Gelert. Llywelyn is overcome with remorse and buries the dog with great ceremony, (then leading to the town name) but can still hear its dying yelp. After that day, Llywelyn never smiles again.

The story is a variation on the &quot;&quot;Faithful Hound&quot; folk-tale motif&quot;, which lives on as an urban legend. It is classified as Aarne–Thompson type 178A.

==Poems and other interpretations==

This story formed the basis for several English poems, among which are &quot;Beth Gêlert; or, the Grave of the Greyhound&quot; by William Robert Spencer written around 1800; &quot;Beth Gelert&quot; by Richard Henry Horne; &quot;Gelert&quot; by Francis Orray Ticknor and the dramatic poem &quot;Llewellyn&quot; by Walter Richard Cassels. The tale is also alluded to by John Critchley Prince in lines 24 to 29 of his poem &quot;North Wales:&quot; &quot;Thou hast not trod with pilgrim foot the ground / Where sleeps the canine martyr of distrust, / Poor Gelert, famed in song, as brave a hound / As ever guarded homestead, hut, or hall, / Or leapt exulting at the hunter’s call; / As ever grateful man consigned to dust.&quot; Despite this, and despite the presence of a raised mound in the village called Gelert&#x27;s Grave, historians do not believe that Gelert ever existed. 

It is recorded in &quot;Wild Wales&quot; (1862) by George Borrow, who notes it as a well known legend; by &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot;, which details versions of the same story from other cultures; and by &quot;The Nuttall Encyclopaedia&quot;, under the Anglicised spellings &quot;Gellert&quot; and &quot;Killhart&quot;. John Fiske discusses Gelert in his &quot;Myths and Myth-makers&quot;, saying regretfully that &quot;as the Swiss must give up his Tell, so must the Welshman be deprived of his brave dog Gellert, over whose cruel fate I confess to having shed more tears than I should regard as well bestowed upon the misfortunes of many a human hero of romance.&quot; He notes that &quot;to this day the visitor to Snowdon is told the touching story, and shown the place, called Beth-Gellert, where the dog&#x27;s grave is still to be seen. Nevertheless, the story occurs in the fireside lore of nearly every Aryan people.&quot;

The tale indeed appears in numerous cultures with minor variations. The Alpine ligurian poem &quot;R sacrifisi dr can&quot;, written in Ligurian, tells of how a shepherd shot his sheepdog after finding it covered in sheep blood, only to later find a dead wolf in the stable. 

In India, a black snake replaces the wolf and a mongoose replaces the dog. In Egypt, the story goes that a cook nearly killed a Wali for having smashed a pot of herbs, but later discovers that the pot contained a poisonous snake. 

In Malaysian folklore, a similar story involves a tame bear, kept by a Malay hunter as the guardian of his young daughter. As in the story of Gelert, the hunter returns home from an expedition, and finds his daughter gone and the bear covered in blood. Hastily thinking the bear has devoured his daughter, the hunter kills it with his spear, but later finds the body of a tiger, killed by the bear in defence of the hunter&#x27;s daughter, who shortly emerges from the jungle, from where she took refuge.

In the Disney movie &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; (1955), Tramp is carried off to the pound after Aunt Sarah finds him in a nursery with the cradle overturned. In this version of the tale, the &quot;Gelert&quot; figure is rescued: Lady manages to show &quot;Jim Dear&quot; the dead rat hidden behind a curtain, and the parents realize that Tramp actually saved their child from the rat.

London Children&#x27;s Ballet produced ballet versions of the story at the Peacock Theatre in 1996 and 2002.

In 2002 the &quot;Incredible Story Studios&quot; made a short film called &quot;The Return of Gelert&quot;, written by a Welsh schoolchild, which depicts the ghost of Gelert returning to haunt early 21st century Beddgelert.

==Gelert&#x27;s grave==
It is now accepted that the village of Beddgelert took its name from an early saint named Kilart or Celert, rather than from the dog. The &quot;grave&quot; mound is ascribed to David Prichard, landlord of the Goat Hotel in Beddgelert in the late eighteenth century, who connected the legend to the village to encourage tourism.

On the supposed grave of Gelert there are two slate memorials, one in Welsh and the other in English. The latter reads: 

IN THE 13TH CENTURY, LLYWELYN, PRINCE OF NORTH WALES, HAD A PALACE AT BEDDGELERT. ONE DAY HE WENT HUNTING WITHOUT GELERT &quot;THE FAITHFUL HOUND&quot; WHO WAS UNACCOUNTABLY ABSENT. ON LLYWELYN&#x27;S RETURN, THE TRUANT STAINED AND SMEARED WITH BLOOD, JOYFULLY SPRANG TO MEET HIS MASTER. THE PRINCE ALARMED HASTENED TO FIND HIS SON, AND SAW THE INFANT&#x27;S COT EMPTY, THE BEDCLOTHES AND FLOOR COVERED WITH BLOOD. THE FRANTIC FATHER PLUNGED THE SWORD INTO THE HOUND&#x27;S SIDE THINKING IT HAD KILLED HIS HEIR. THE DOG&#x27;S DYING YELL WAS ANSWERED BY A CHILD&#x27;S CRY. LLYWELYN SEARCHED AND DISCOVERED HIS BOY UNHARMED BUT NEAR BY LAY THE BODY OF A MIGHTY WOLF WHICH GELERT HAD SLAIN, THE PRINCE FILLED WITH REMORSE IS SAID NEVER TO HAVE SMILED AGAIN. HE BURIED GELERT HERE. THE SPOT IS CALLED BEDDGELERT.

<text>Beddgelert () is a village and community in the Snowdonia area of Gwynedd, Wales. The population of the community taken at the 2021 census was 460 (rounded to the nearest 10). This includes Nantmor and Nant Gwynant. It is reputed to be named after the legendary hound Gelert. The community is large and sparsely populated and covers 86 square kilometres.

== Location ==
The village stands in a valley at the confluence of the River Glaslyn and the Afon Colwyn. Just above the confluence of the rivers, in the centre of the village, is an old stone bridge with two arches. Many of the houses and hotels are built of local dark stone. To the west is Moel Hebog and to the north and a series of hills rising to the Snowdon horseshoe. The A4085 between Caernarfon ( north) and Porthmadog ( south) runs through the village.

The outdoor equipment company Gelert originated in Bryncir then moved to Beddgelert but later moved its headquarters to nearby Porthmadog.

==History==
The folk tale of the faithful hound &quot;Gelert&quot; is often associated with the village. A raised mound in the village is called &quot;Gelert&#x27;s Grave&quot; and is a significant tourist attraction. But the grave was built by the late 18th-century landlord of the Goat Hotel, David Pritchard, who created it in order to encourage tourism. Similar legends can be found in other parts of Europe and Asia.
The village is probably named after an early Christian missionary and leader called Celert (or Cilert) who settled here early in the 8th century. The earliest record of the name Beddgelert appears on a document dated 1258, and the name recorded is &quot;Bekelert&quot;. In a document of 1269 it is recorded as &quot;Bedkelerd&quot;. The current name of the village is often rendered &quot;Begél&quot; in the local Welsh dialect.

The Church of St. Mary stands at the end of Stryd yr Eglwys (Church Street). This was originally a part of an Augustinian Monastery (the chapel), but is all that remains since the rest of the monastery was burnt down during Edward I&#x27;s war of conquest. Rebuilding was probably not completed at the time of the suppression of the monastery in about 1536. Parts of the building date from the 12th century and is still in active use today.

== Economy and attractions ==

Beddgelert is a significant tourist attraction, its picturesque bridge crossing the Afon Colwyn just upstream of its confluence with the Afon Glaslyn. It is also the nearest village to the scenic Glaslyn gorge, an area of tumultuous river running between steep wooded hills. Much of the area is, however, becoming invaded by the alien plant, &quot;Rhododendron ponticum&quot; which provides a covering of pink blossom in May and June, but which is slowly blanketing out the native flora. Attempts have been made to control its spread by cutting and burning.

River levels on the River Glaslyn in Beddgelert are constantly monitored by the Natural Resources Wales, in order to give advance warning of flood conditions lower down the valley.

Beddgelert has a range of hotels with public bars, guesthouses, cafes, and restaurants. The car park in the village provides the easiest access route for climbing Moel Hebog, the mountain which directly overlooks the village.

Part of the restored Welsh Highland Railway runs through the village. In April 2009 the railway station was reopened to the public. The line links the village with Caernarfon to the north and Porthmadog to the south.

Other local attractions include the Sygun Copper Mine.

The village is also linked with the Rupert Bear stories, as Alfred Bestall wrote and illustrated some of the stories whilst he lived in the village, in a cottage at the foot of Mynydd Sygun. There is even a small area known as &#x27;Rupert Garden&#x27; in the village, dedicated to the Bear; a short walk from Alfred Bestall&#x27;s old home.

Many films have made use of the scenery around Beddgelert, most notably The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, starring Ingrid Bergman. Parts of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life, starring Angelina Jolie, were also shot here.

== Demographics ==
In 2021 the population of Beddgelert was recorded as 460, 34.5% of which were aged 55 to 74, higher than the national average of 25.1%. The largest ethnic group is White, making up 97.2% of the population, higher than the national average of 93.8%, with the second largest being Mixed with 2.2% of the population, higher than the national average of 1.6%. The largest religious group in Beddgelert is No religion with 46.5% of the population, which is also the national average, with the second largest being Christianity with 42.6%, lower than the national average of 43.6%.

== Notable locals ==
* Renowned bards who lived in the area in the 15th–16th centuries include Rhys Goch Eryri (fl.1385–1448), Dafydd Nanmor (fl.1450–1490) and Rhys Nanmor (fl.1480–1513). More recently, from the 19th to the 20th centuries, both Glasynys (Owen Wynne Jones) and Carneddog (Richard Griffith) lived in Nantmor. Currently Nantmor is still home to poets, including Nia Powell and Cynan Jones.
* John Williams ( – ), goldsmith who worked for King James I, was from Beddgelert, and donated a silver cup to the church in 1610.
* Marged ferch Ifan (1696–1793), Welsh harpist and wrestler, was born here.
* Alfred Bestall (1892–1986), one of the illustrators and storytellers of the comic strip character Rupert Bear, lived in the village for many years.

== Beddgelert meteorite ==

On 21 September 1949 a meteorite struck the Prince Llewelyn Hotel in the early hours of the morning, causing damage to the roof and a bedroom in the hotel. The following week the &quot;Caernarvon &amp; Denbigh Herald&quot; reported the incident:

The proprietor of the hotel, a Mr Tillotson, subsequently sold half the meteorite to the British Museum and half to Durham University, which had placed an advertisement in the local papers asking for information and offering a reward for any recovered fragments of the meteorite.

There have only ever been two such verified meteorite falls in Wales: the Beddgelert incident, and an earlier incident away in Pontllyfni in 1931, at the other end of the Nantlle Ridge.

<text>The Upper Angara (, &quot;Verkhnyaya Angara&quot;; , &quot;Deede Angar&quot;) is a river in Buryatia, Siberia to the northeast of Lake Baikal. the third longest river in the Baikal basin. It is long, and has a drainage basin of . 

The Baikal–Amur Mainline runs along the north side of the river northeast up its valley, crossing between Anamakit and Novy Uoyan and crossing the river a second time upstream before heading into the mountains.
==Course==
The Upper Angara rises at about in an area of small glacial lakes of the Delyun-Uran range, right by the Northern Muya Range, Stanovoy Highlands. It its upper course the river flows in a WSW direction across mountainous terrain, with rapids and waterfalls. It enters then a floodplain and crosses the spurs of the Upper Angara and the Barguzin ranges. Near Yanchukan it flows through the Upper Angara tectonic basin. Finally it ends in Lake Baikal forming a delta in the shallow northern end of the lake, separated from the deep part by long sandy spits, including Yarki Island. The Upper Angara is navigable in its last stretch.

The main tributaries of the Upper Angara are the long Angarakan, the long Yanchui, the long Churo and the long Kotera.

<doc id="79474" wikidata="Q2124" url="?curid=79474" title="Valéry Giscard d'Estaing">
<text>Valéry René Marie Georges Giscard d&#x27;Estaing (, ; ; 2 February 19262 December 2020), also known as simply Giscard or VGE, was a French politician who served as President of France from 1974 to 1981.

After serving as Minister of Finance under prime ministers Jacques Chaban-Delmas and Pierre Messmer, Giscard d&#x27;Estaing won the presidential election of 1974 with 50.8% of the vote against François Mitterrand of the Socialist Party. His tenure was marked by a more liberal attitude on social issues—such as divorce, contraception and abortion—and by attempts to modernise the country and the office of the presidency, notably overseeing such far-reaching infrastructure projects as the TGV and the turn towards reliance on nuclear power as France&#x27;s main energy source. Giscard d&#x27;Estaing launched the Grande Arche, Musée d&#x27;Orsay, Arab World Institute and Cité des Sciences et de l&#x27;Industrie projects in the Paris region, later included in the Grands Projets of François Mitterrand. He promoted liberalisation of trade; however, his popularity suffered from the economic downturn that followed the 1973 energy crisis, marking the end of the &quot;Trente Glorieuses&quot; (the &quot;Thirty Glorious Years&quot; of prosperity after 1945). He imposed austerity budgets, and allowed unemployment to rise in order to avoid deficits. Giscard d&#x27;Estaing in the centre faced political opposition from both sides of the spectrum: from the newly unified left under Mitterrand and a rising Jacques Chirac, who resurrected Gaullism on a right-wing opposition line. In 1981, despite a high approval rating, he was defeated in a runoff against Mitterrand, with 48.2% of the vote.

As president, Giscard d&#x27;Estaing promoted cooperation among the European nations, especially in tandem with West Germany, 1974–1982 ruled by the first, second and third cabinet under chancelor Helmut Schmidt (SPD). 

As a former president, he was a member of the Constitutional Council. He also served as president of the Regional Council of Auvergne from 1986 to 2004. Involved with the process of European integration, he notably presided over the Convention on the Future of Europe that drafted the ill-fated Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. In 2003, he was elected to the , taking the seat that his friend and former president of Senegal Léopold Sédar Senghor had held. He died at the age of 94, and is the longest-lived French president in history.
==Early life and ancestry==
Valéry René Marie Georges Giscard d&#x27;Estaing was born on 2 February 1926 in Koblenz, Germany, during the French occupation of the Rhineland. He was the elder son of Jean Edmond Lucien Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, a high-ranking civil servant, and his wife, Marthe Clémence Jacqueline Marie (May) Bardoux. His mother was the daughter of senator and academic Achille Octave Marie Jacques Bardoux, and a granddaughter of minister of state education Agénor Bardoux.
Giscard had an elder sister, Sylvie, and younger siblings Olivier, Isabelle, and Marie-Laure. Despite the addition of &quot;d&#x27;Estaing&quot; to the family name by his grandfather, Giscard was not a male-line descendant of the extinct aristocratic family of Vice-Admiral d&#x27;Estaing. His connection to the D&#x27;Estaing family was very remote. His ancestress was Lucie Madeleine d&#x27;Estaing, Dame de Réquistat (1769–1844), who in turn was descendant of Joachim I d&#x27;Estaing, sieur de Réquistat (1610–1685), illegitimate son of Charles d&#x27;Estaing (1585–1661), sieur de Cheylade, Knight of Saint John of Jerusalem, son of Jean III d&#x27;Estaing, seigneur de Val (1540–1621) and his wife, Gilberte de La Rochefoucauld (1560–1623).

Giscard studied at the Lycée Blaise-Pascal in Clermont-Ferrand, the École Gerson and the Lycées Janson-de-Sailly and Louis-le-Grand in Paris.

He joined the French Resistance and participated in the Liberation of Paris; during the liberation, he was assigned to protecting Alexandre Parodi. He then joined the French First Army and served until the end of the war. He was later awarded the Croix de guerre for his military service.

In 1948, he spent a year in Montreal, Canada, where he worked as a teacher at Collège Stanislas.

He graduated from the École Polytechnique and the École nationale d&#x27;administration (1949–1951) and chose to enter the prestigious Inspection des finances. He was admitted to the Tax and Revenue Service, then joined the staff of Prime Minister Edgar Faure (1955–1956). He was fluent in German.

==Early political career==

===First offices: 1956–1962===
In 1956, he was elected to the National Assembly as a deputy for the Puy-de-Dôme &quot;département&quot;, in the domain of his maternal family. He joined the National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNIP), a conservative grouping. After the proclamation of the Fifth Republic, the CNIP leader Antoine Pinay became Minister of Economy and Finance and chose him as Secretary of State for Finances from 1959 to 1962.

===Member of the Gaullist majority: 1962–1974===
In 1962, while Giscard had been nominated Minister of Economy and Finance, his party broke with the Gaullists and left the majority coalition. Giscard refused to resign and founded the Independent Republicans (RI), which became the junior partner of the Gaullists in the &quot;presidential majority&quot;. It was during his time at the Ministry of the Economy that he coined the phrase &quot;exorbitant privilege&quot; to characterise the hegemony of the US dollar in international payments under the Bretton Woods system.

However, in 1966, he was dismissed from the cabinet. He transformed the RI into a political party, the National Federation of the Independent Republicans (FNRI), and founded the Perspectives and Realities Clubs. In this, he criticised the &quot;solitary practice of the power&quot; and summarised his position towards De Gaulle&#x27;s policy by a &quot;yes, but ...&quot;. As chairman of the National Assembly Committee on Finances, he criticised his successor in the cabinet.

For that reason the Gaullists refused to re-elect him to that position after the 1968 legislative election. In 1969, unlike most of FNRI&#x27;s elected officials, Giscard advocated a &quot;no&quot; vote in the constitutional referendum concerning the regions and the Senate, while De Gaulle had announced his intention to resign if the &quot;no&quot; won. The Gaullists accused him of being largely responsible for De Gaulle&#x27;s departure.

During the 1969 presidential campaign, he supported the winning candidate Georges Pompidou, after which he returned to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. He was representative of a new generation of politicians emerging from the senior civil service, seen as &quot;technocrats&quot;.

=== Presidential election victory ===
In 1974, after the sudden death of President Georges Pompidou, Giscard announced his candidacy for the presidency. His two main challengers were François Mitterrand for the left and Jacques Chaban-Delmas, a former Gaullist prime minister. Jacques Chirac and other Gaullist personalities published the where they explained that Giscard was the best candidate to prevent the election of Mitterrand. In the election, Giscard finished well ahead of Chaban-Delmas in the first round, though coming second to Mitterrand. In the run-off on 20 May, however, Giscard narrowly defeated Mitterrand, receiving 50.7% of the vote.

==President of France==
In 1974, Giscard was elected President of France, defeating Socialist candidate François Mitterrand by 425,000 votes. At 48, he was the third youngest president in French history at the time, after Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte and Jean Casimir-Perier.

In his appointments he was innovative regarding women. He gave major cabinet positions to Simone Veil as Minister of Health and Françoise Giroud as secretary for women&#x27;s affairs. Giroud worked to improve access to meaningful employment and to reconcile careers with childbearing. Veil confronted the abortion issue.

===Domestic policy===
On taking office Giscard was quick to initiate reforms; they included increasing the minimum wage as well as family allowances and old-age pensions. He extended the right to political asylum, expanded health insurance to cover all Frenchmen, lowered the voting age to 18, and modernised the divorce law. On 25 September 1974, Giscard summed up his goals: 
He pushed for the development of the TGV high speed train network and the Minitel telephone upgrade, a precursor of the Internet. He promoted nuclear power, as a way to assert French independence.

Economically, Giscard&#x27;s presidency saw a steady rise in personal incomes, with the purchasing power of workers going up by 29% and that of old age pensioners by 65%.

The great crisis that overwhelmed his term was a worldwide economic crisis based on rapidly rising oil prices. He turned to Prime Minister Raymond Barre in 1976, who advocated numerous complex, strict policies (&quot;Barre Plans&quot;). The first Barre plan emerged on 22 September 1976, with a priority to stop inflation. It included a 3-month price freeze; a reduction in the value added tax; wage controls; salary controls; a reduction of the growth in the money supply; and increases in the income tax, automobile taxes, luxury taxes and bank rates. There were measures to restore the trade balance, and support the growth of the economy and employment. Oil imports, whose price had shot up, were limited. There was special aid to exports, and an action fund was set up to aid industries. There was increased financial aid to farmers, who were suffering from a drought, and for social security. The package was not very popular, but was pursued with vigor.

Giscard initially tried to project a less monarchical image than had been the case for past French presidents. He took a ride on the Métro, ate monthly dinners with ordinary Frenchmen, and even invited garbage men from Paris to have breakfast with him in the Élysée Palace. However, when he learned that most Frenchmen were somewhat cool to this display of informality, Giscard became so aloof and distant that his opponents frequently attacked him as being too far removed from ordinary citizens.

In domestic policy, Giscard&#x27;s reforms worried the conservative electorate and the Gaullist party, especially the law by Simone Veil legalising abortion. Although he said he had &quot;deep aversion against capital punishment&quot;, Giscard claimed in his 1974 campaign that he would apply the death penalty to people committing the most heinous crimes. He did not commute three of the death sentences that he had to decide upon during his presidency. France under his administration was thus the last country in the European Community to apply the death penalty, and until the resumption of executions in the United States in 1977, the only in the Western world. The last death sentence, bearing Giscard&#x27;s signature, was executed in September 1977, the last ratified by the Court of Cassation in March 1981, but rescinded by presidential pardon after Giscard&#x27;s defeat in the presidential election in May.

A rivalry arose with his Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, who resigned in 1976. Raymond Barre, called the &quot;best economist in France&quot; at the time, succeeded him.

Unexpectedly, the right-wing coalition won the 1978 legislative election. Nevertheless, relations with Chirac, who had founded the Rally for the Republic (RPR), became more tense. Giscard reacted by founding a centre-right confederation, the Union for French Democracy (UDF).

===Foreign policy===
Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing was a close friend of West German chancellor Helmut Schmidt and together they persuaded smaller European states to hold regular summit meetings, and set up the European Monetary System. They induced the Soviet Union to establish a degree of liberalisation through the Helsinki Accords.

He promoted the creation of the European Council at the Paris Summit in December 1974. In 1975, he invited the heads of government from West Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States to a summit in Rambouillet, to form the Group of Six major economic powers (now the G7, including Canada and the European Union).

In 1975, Giscard pressured the future King of Spain Juan Carlos I to leave Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet out of his coronation by stating that if Pinochet attended he would not. Although France received many Chilean political refugees, Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s government secretly collaborated with Pinochet&#x27;s and Videla&#x27;s juntas as shown by journalist Marie-Monique Robin.

Giscard d&#x27;Estaing sought to improve Franco-Romanian ties and in 1979 visited Bucharest. In 1980 he received Romanian president Nicolae Ceaucescu as a guest in Paris.

====Africa====
Giscard continued de Gaulle&#x27;s African policy, and sought to maintain good relations with Middle East Muslim countries so that they would continue delivering oil to France. Senegal, Ivory Coast, Gabon, and Cameroon were the largest and most reliable African allies, and received most of the investments. In 1977, in Opération Lamantin, he ordered fighter jets to deploy in Mauritania and suppress the Polisario guerrillas fighting against the Mauritanian government.

The most important advisor on African affairs during the Giscard era was René Journiac, successor of Jacques Foccart at the Secretariat for African and Malagasy Affairs, which was renamed to the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Cellule africaine&quot;). Journiac largely continued Foccart&#x27;s approach of maintaining French influence in its former colonies through a web of personal relationships with African strongmen. In 1977, documents forgotten by the mercenary Bob Denard during a coup attempt in Benin suggested that Denard&#x27;s group had received support from official channels, namely through Journiac.

Most controversial was Giscard&#x27;s involvement with the regime of Jean-Bédel Bokassa in the Central African Republic. Giscard was initially a friend of Bokassa, and supplied the regime. The growing unpopularity of that government led Giscard to begin distancing himself from Bokassa. In 1979&#x27;s Operation Caban, French troops helped drive Bokassa out of power and restore former president David Dacko to power. This action was also controversial, particularly given that Dacko was Bokassa&#x27;s cousin and had appointed Bokassa as head of the military; and unrest continued in the Central African Republic, leading to Dacko being overthrown in another coup in 1981.

The Diamonds Affair, known in France as &quot;l&#x27;affaire des diamants&quot;, was a major political scandal in the Fifth Republic. In 1973, while Minister of Finance, Giscard d&#x27;Estaing was given a number of diamonds by Bokassa. The affair was unveiled by the satirical newspaper &quot;Le Canard Enchaîné&quot; on 10 October 1979, towards the end of Giscard&#x27;s presidency.

In order to defend himself, Giscard d&#x27;Estaing claimed to have sold the diamonds and donated the proceeds to the Central African Red Cross. He expected CARC authorities to confirm the story. However, the head of the local Red Cross society, Jeanne-Marie Ruth-Rolland, publicly denied the French claims. Ruth-Rolland was quickly dismissed from her post in what she described as a &quot;coup de force&quot; by Dacko. The saga contributed to Giscard losing his 1981 reelection bid.

====Soviet Union====
Giscard d&#x27;Estaing fancied himself a peace-maker with the Soviet Union and their embroilment in Afghanistan. At their summit in May 1980, he proposed an arrangement that would see Leonid Brezhnev partially withdraw his forces and thought the latter had agreed once month later only to be humiliated in front of his G7 partners when Brezhnev fooled him with a lie. His Socialist rival, François Mitterrand, acidly observed in the Assemblée Nationale that he was the &quot;petit télégraphiste de Varsovie&quot; (&quot;little telegraph operator from Warsaw&quot;).

===1981 presidential election===
In the 1981 presidential election, Giscard took a severe blow to his support when Chirac ran against him in the first round. Chirac finished third and refused to recommend that his supporters back Giscard in the runoff, though he declared that he himself would vote for Giscard. Giscard lost to Mitterrand by 3 points in the runoff and blamed Chirac for his defeat thereafter. In later years, it was widely said that Giscard loathed Chirac; certainly on many occasions Giscard criticised Chirac&#x27;s policies despite supporting Chirac&#x27;s governing coalition.

While campaigning for the 1981 French election, Giscard was the target of an attempted assassination at Ajaccio airport on 16 April 1981. The attack was carried out by the Gravona brigade of the National Liberation Front of Corsica (FLNC). The FLNC had recently declared a ceasefire on 1 April 1981 as not to hinder the left in the upcoming elections, but disdain for Giscard and the right was still present. The Gravona brigade, led by François Santoni, placed two time bombs in the airport terminal in an area where Giscard was predicted to enter. The bombs went off two minutes after he entered the terminal, though he never entered the half of the building where the bombs were stored, and made it out unharmed. In a speech he delivered right after the attack, he condemned the action, calling it a &quot;cowardly&quot; attack and stated that it was an &quot;attitude unworthy of Corsica.&quot;

Giscard&#x27;s farewell speech as president became a legendary moment in French television. After delivering a solemn seven-minute address, he paused and bade a pronounced &quot;&quot; before walking out as &quot;La Marseillase&quot; was played, leaving audiences to view his empty desk for the duration of the song.

==Post-presidency==

===Return to politics: 1984–2004===

After his defeat, Giscard retired temporarily from politics. In 1984, he was re-elected to his seat in the National Assembly and won the presidency of the regional council of Auvergne. He was president of the Council of European Municipalities and Regions from 1997 to 2004.

In 1982, along with his friend Gerald Ford, he co-founded the annual AEI World Forum. He also served on the Trilateral Commission after being president, writing papers with Henry Kissinger.

He hoped to become prime minister during the first &quot;cohabitation&quot; (1986–1988) or after the re-election of Mitterrand with the theme of &quot;France united&quot;, but he was not chosen for this position. During the 1988 presidential campaign, he refused to choose publicly between the two right-wing candidates, his two former Prime Ministers Jacques Chirac and Raymond Barre.

He served as president of the UDF from 1988 to 1996, but he was faced with the rise of a new generation of politicians called the &quot;rénovateurs&quot; (&quot;renovation men&quot;). Most of the UDF politicians supported the candidacy of the RPR Prime Minister Édouard Balladur at the 1995 presidential election, but Giscard supported his old rival Jacques Chirac, who won the election. That same year Giscard suffered a setback when he lost a close election for the mayoralty of Clermont-Ferrand.

In 2000, he made a parliamentary proposal to reduce the length of a presidential term from seven to five years, a proposal that eventually won its referendum proposal by President Chirac. Following his retirement from the National Assembly his son Louis Giscard d&#x27;Estaing was elected in his former constituency.

===Retired from politics: 2004–2020===

In 2003, Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing was admitted to the Académie française.

Following his narrow defeat in the regional elections of March 2004, marked by the victory of the left wing in 21 of 22 regions, he decided to leave partisan politics and to take his seat on the Constitutional Council as a former president of the country. Some of his actions there, such as his campaign in favour of the treaty establishing the European Constitution, were criticised as unbecoming to a member of this council, which should embody nonpartisanship and should not appear to favour one political option over the other. Indeed, the question of the membership of former presidents in the council was raised at this point, with some suggesting that it should be replaced by a life membership in the Senate.

On 19 April 2007, he endorsed Nicolas Sarkozy for the presidential election. He supported the creation of the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents in 2012 and the introduction of same-sex marriage in France in 2013. In 2016, he supported former Prime Minister François Fillon in The Republicans presidential primaries.

A 2014 poll suggested that 64% of the French thought he had been a good president. He was considered to be an honest and competent politician, but also a distant man.

On 21 January 2017, with a lifespan of 33,226 days, he surpassed Émile Loubet (1838–1929) in terms of longevity, and became the oldest former president in French history.

==European activities==
Throughout his political career, Giscard was a proponent of a greater amount of European integration in the European Community (in what would become the European Union). In 1978, he was for this reason the obvious target of Jacques Chirac&#x27;s Call of Cochin, denouncing the &quot;party of the foreigners&quot;.

From 1989 to 1993, Giscard served as a member of the European Parliament. From 1989 to 1991, he was also chairman of the Liberal and Democratic Reformist Group.

From 2001 to 2004, he served as president of the Convention on the Future of Europe. On 29 October 2004, the heads of government of the European Union gathered in Rome, approved and signed the European Constitution based on a draft strongly influenced by Giscard&#x27;s work at the convention. Although the Constitution was rejected by French voters in May 2005, Giscard continued to actively lobby for its passage in other EU states.

Giscard d&#x27;Estaing attracted international attention at the time of the June 2008 Irish vote on the Lisbon Treaty. In an article for &quot;Le Monde&quot; in June 2007, published in English translation by &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, he said that a &quot;divide and ratify&quot; approach, whereby &quot;public opinion would be led to adopt, without knowing it, the proposals we dare not present to them directly&quot;, would be unworthy and would reinforce the idea that the construction of Europe was being organised behind the public&#x27;s backs by lawyers and diplomats; the quotation was taken out of context by prominent supporters of a &quot;no&quot; vote and distorted to give the impression that Giscard was advocating such a deception, instead of repudiating it.

In 2008, he became the honorary president of the Atomium - European Institute for Science and Democracy. On 27 November 2009, Giscard publicly launched the institute during its first conference, held at the European Parliament, declaring: &quot;European intelligence could be at the very root of the identity of the European people.&quot; A few days before he had signed, together with the President of the institute Michelangelo Baracchi Bonvicini, the European Manifesto of Atomium.

==Personal life==
Giscard&#x27;s name was often shortened to &quot;VGE&quot; by the French media. He was also known simply as &quot;l&#x27;Ex&quot;, particularly during the time he was the only living former president.

On 17 December 1952, Giscard married Anne-Aymone Sauvage de Brantes. The couple had four children.

Giscard&#x27;s private life was the source of many rumours at both national and international level. His family did not live in the presidential Élysée Palace, and &quot;The Independent&quot; reported on his affairs with women. In 1974, &quot;Le Monde&quot; reported that he used to leave a sealed letter stating his whereabouts in case of emergency.

In May 2020, Giscard was accused of groping a German journalist&#x27;s buttocks during an interview in 2018. He denied the accusation.

===Possession of the Estaing castle===

In 2005 he and his brother bought the castle of Estaing, formerly a possession of the above-mentioned Admiral d&#x27;Estaing who was beheaded in 1794. The brothers never used the castle as a residence but for its symbolic value, and they explained the purchase, supported by the local municipality, as an act of patronage. However, a number of major newspapers in several countries questioned their motives and some hinted at self-appointed nobility and a usurped historical identity. The castle was put up for sale in 2008 for €3 million and is now the property of the Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing Foundation.

===2009 novel===
Giscard wrote his second romantic novel, published on 1 October 2009 in France, entitled &quot;The Princess and the President&quot;. It tells the story of French President Jacques-Henri Lambertye having a romantic liaison with Patricia, Princess of Cardiff of the British royal family. This fuelled rumours that the piece of fiction was based on a real-life liaison between Giscard and Diana, Princess of Wales. He later stressed that the story was entirely made up and no such affair had actually occurred.

==Illness and death==
On 14 September 2020, Giscard d&#x27;Estaing was hospitalised for care for breathing complications at the Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou in Paris. He was later diagnosed with a lung infection. He was hospitalised again on 15 November, but was discharged on 20 November.

Giscard d&#x27;Estaing died from complications attributed to COVID-19 on 2 December 2020, at the age of 94. His family said that his funeral would be held in &quot;strict intimacy&quot;. His funeral and burial was held on 5 December in Authon with forty people attending the event.

President Emmanuel Macron released a statement describing Giscard d&#x27;Estaing as a &quot;servant of the state, a politician of progress and freedom&quot;; the president declared a national day of mourning for Giscard d&#x27;Estaing on 9 December. Former presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, 2017 presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, German chancellor Angela Merkel, and European Union leaders Charles Michel, David Sassoli, and Ursula von der Leyen all issued statements praising Giscard&#x27;s efforts in modernising France and strengthening relations with the European Union.

==Legacy==
Giscard d&#x27;Estaing was seen as the pioneer in modernising France and strengthening the European Union. He introduced numerous small social reforms, such as reducing the voting age by three years, allowing divorce by common consent, and legalising abortion. He was committed to supporting innovative technology, and focused on creating the TGV high-speed rail network, promoting nuclear power, and developing the telephone system.

Despite his ambitions, he was unable to resolve the great economic crisis of his term, a worldwide economic recession caused primarily by a very rapid increase in oil prices. His foreign policy was remembered for his close relationship with West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, and together they persuaded Europe&#x27;s lesser economic powers to collaborate and form new permanent organisations, especially the European Monetary System and the G-7 system.

In December 2022, Anne-Aymone Giscard d&#x27;Estaing put up some of her late husband&#x27;s art and furniture for sale at Hotel Drouot: the collection included a Rodin bust of Mahler.

<text>Irkutsk Oblast (; ) is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast), located in southeastern Siberia in the basins of the Angara, Lena, and Nizhnyaya Tunguska Rivers. The administrative center is the city of Irkutsk. It had a population of 2,370,102 at the 2021 Census.

==Geography==
Irkutsk Oblast borders the Republic of Buryatia and the Tuva Republic in the south and southwest, which separate it from Khövsgöl Province, Mongolia; Krasnoyarsk Krai in the west; the Sakha Republic in the northeast; and Zabaykalsky Krai in the east. 

The unique and world-famous Lake Baikal is located in the southeast of the region. It is drained by the Angara, which flows north across the province; the outflow rate is controlled by the Irkutsk Dam. The two other major dams on the Irkutsk Oblast&#x27;s section of the Angara are at Bratsk and Ust-Ilimsk; both forming large reservoirs. The Lena has its source in Irkutsk Oblast as well, and flows north-east into the neighboring Sakha Republic.

Irkutsk Oblast consists mostly of the hills and broad valleys of the Central Siberian Plateau, with the Lena-Angara Plateau. The Primorsky Range and the Baikal Mountains stretch along Lake Baikal, and in the northeast rise the North Baikal Highlands and the Patom Plateau. Pik Tofalariya is the highest point of the oblast.

==History==

===Pre-history===
Mongolic-related Slab Grave cultural monuments survive in Baikal territory. The territory of Buryatia came under the control of the Xiongnu Empire (209 BC – 93 CE), of the Mongolian Xianbei state (93–234), of the Rouran Khaganate (330–555), of the Göktürk Khaganate (555-603), of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate (603-744), of the Uyghur Khaganate (744-847), of the Yenisei Kyrgyz (847-1219), of the Mongol Empire (1206–1368) and of the Northern Yuan (1368–1691). 
Medieval Mongol tribes like the Merkit, Bayads, Barga Mongols and Tümeds inhabited Buryatia. Today Buryat-Mongols remain in the territory of the oblast.

Russian presence in the area dates from the 17th century: the Russian Tsardom expanded eastward following the conquest of the Khanate of Sibir in 1582. By the end of the 17th century, Irkutsk had become a small town, monasteries were being built, and suburbs and agricultural settlements had started to form.
===18th century===
From the 18th century trades and crafts began to develop, and gold- and silver-smiths appeared. As the Russian state expanded to the east of Irkutsk, the city became the capital of enormous territories from the Yenisey River to the Pacific Ocean, and played an important role in the exploration and securing of vast Eastern-Siberian and Far-Eastern territories for Russia. Gradually, Irkutsk gained more importance as the main transportation- and trade-center of Eastern Siberia; it became a center of trade routes from Kamchatka, Chukotka, Yakutia to Mongolia, and China. The administrative importance of the city also increased, and it became a center of a fifth of the provinces of Siberia; in 1764 it became the center of an independent province, the Irkutsk Governorate.

For Irkutsk the 18th century was a time of research expeditions. Some of the organization of Vitus Bering&#x27;s first (1725–1730) and second (1733-1743) expeditions to the shores of Kamchatka took place in Irkutsk.

A merchant class developed in the city of Irkutsk. In the second half of the eighteenth century, the Irkutsk industrial and merchant companies of Golikov, Trapeznikov, , , began to explore the Aleutian Islands and later Alaska. In 1799 the merchant companies came together in a Russian-American Company &quot;for the trades on the territory of the Aleutian and Kuril islands and the rest of the North-Eastern sea, belonging to Russia by the right of discovery&quot;. Grigorii Ivanovich Shelikhov, an outstanding seafarer, played an important role in controlling enormous spaces of the northern part of the Pacific Ocean. He founded the first colonies of Russian America through the Shelikhov-Golikov Company. In 1727 the Russian Orthodox Church established the Irkutsk Eparchy.

During the 18th century, schools, professional-technical education colleges, science museums, libraries, theaters, and book-printers developed in Irkutsk. Educational and cultural organizations opened. In 1725 the first school in Eastern Siberia, attached to the (founded in 1672), opened, and in 1754 sea (navigation) schools and secondary schools opened throughout the Irkutsk area. The 1780s saw the opening of the second public library in provincial towns in Russia, as well as a regional museum and an amateur theater. In Irkutsk outstanding citizens appeared, still remembered today. These included the architect, geographer and historian (1765–1829), the writer (1797–1863), and the teacher Semyon Semyonovich Schukin (1789—1863). Siberian science buildings opened. A.G. Laxman, Lomonosov&#x27;s apprentice, one of the first Siberian mineralogists, worked in Irkutsk.

The city landscape of Irkutsk was changing. The of 1706 (one of the oldest stone buildings in Eastern Siberia), the unique (1747), the &quot;Prikaznaya izba&quot; (order house), the first stone construction, and the Triumph gate were built.
===19th century===

In the late eighteenth century and the early nineteenth century, Irkutsk Province gradually increased in importance as a center of trade, craft, and culture. It became the center of Russian trade with China and, from the 1830s, a gold-manufacturing center of Eastern Siberia. In 1803 Irkutsk became the center of the Siberian Governorate-General, and in 1822 it became the center of the Eastern Siberian Governorate-General. The Governors-General of Eastern Siberia greatly influenced the development of the city.

Irkutsk merchants explored the Yeniseysky and Leno-Vitimsky gold regions and substantially increased their capital, which made them the richest merchants in Siberia. The Irkutsk merchant class began to play a major role in the city&#x27;s development. Intensive city construction took place. Private residences, hospitals, orphanages, and schools were built, while significant funds went towards education and the development of science in the region.

The architecture of the city of Irkutsk underwent change. The , done in Russian classic style in 1800–1804, and the – a monument of the nineteenth century, were built in honor of the tenth anniversary of Alexander I&#x27;s reign.
In the second half of the nineteenth century the printing art developed in Irkutsk, the first newspapers being, “Irkutsk province news” and “Amur”. The names of A.P.Schapov, M.B.Zagoskin, V.I.Vagin were connected with the newspaper “Siberia”. In 1851, the first scientific organization in Eastern Siberia – the Siberian branch of Russian geographical society, was opened. In 1877, it was called the Eastern-Siberian branch. V.I.Dybovskii, A.L.Chekanovskii, I.D.Cherskii, V.A.Obruchev, geologists, geographers and researchers of Siberia, worked in Irkutsk Oblast on exploring Lake Baikal and the Lena River.

The summer of 1879 could be considered to be a dramatic period in the city of Irkutsk&#x27;s history. During a July 22–24 fire almost all the central parts of the city were burnt, and more than two thirds of city buildings and 75 city districts were destroyed. The city began to revive, getting a new look. Stone and wooden constructions built after the fire have been preserved up to the present day. In 1898 the arrival of the first train via the Trans-Siberian Railway to Irkutsk Oblast was a major event. The construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway contributed to further city development.

Several politically exiled figures were connected with Irkutsk city. Among the first of the exiled was A.N. Radischev, who lived in Irkutsk for more than 3 months. Since the 1830s, the Decembrists lived in settlements and in colonies in the Irkutsk Oblast. The exiled houses of Volkonsky and Trubetskoy later became house-museums. N. A. Panov, I. V. Podzhio, A. Z. Muravyov, P. A. Mukhanov, A. P. Yushnevsky, V. A. Bechasnov, the wife of Trubetskoy and their children stayed in Irkutsk for the rest of their lives. In the late 1850s, the Petrashevtzy appeared in Irkutsk. The exiled historian-democrat, A.P. Schapov, lived here until his last days, and the Polish rebels and revolutionaries (including the &quot;narodnik&quot;) also lived here.
A well-known Russian publicist of the nineteenth century, N. Shelgunov, wrote about Irkutsk: “Irkutsk is the only Siberian city, which has the city character. ...As England created London, France - Paris, Siberia – created Irkutsk. Siberia is proud of Irkutsk, “not to see this city” means “not to see Siberia”.

In the early nineteenth century the city was considerably changed, especially its center. Large buildings were being built, mason streets were being made, cab drivers and street lights appeared. The water supply and the first electrification stations were built. The Irkutsk Regional museum was stamped with the names of Siberian researchers on its walls (1883), the building of the first public community, city theater (1897), Kazan&#x27; cathedral, made in new Byzantine style (1893), and the Roman Catholic cathedral (1895) completed an architectural style of the city. In 1908 a monument to Alexander III was opened on the Angara embankment.

===20th century===

The city was damaged and influenced by the political events of the twentieth century – the Russian revolution, the 1917 October Revolution, the Civil war and the Great Patriotic War (as the Soviet Union&#x27;s part in WW2 is commonly referred to in Russia. This is distinct from WW2, in that it began with 1941 Operation Barbarossa, whereas WW2 began with the September 1939 invasion of Poland).

Since the 1930s the industrial construction of the city had begun. Mechanical engineering plants, the air plant, brick and concrete plants, tea fabric, and food industry plants were being built. Economic development of the city contributed to scientific, educational and cultural development. The first Higher education in Eastern Siberia, Irkutsk State University was founded in 1918. Its departments were developing as independent institutes: medical, pedagogical, finance-economical. In 1930 the metallurgic institute was opened, in 1934 the agricultural institute was organized.

The early Soviets educated women in traditional professions like nursing and primary education. At right is the Irkutsk orphanage named for E. Medvednikova, which served both as an eleemosynary institution and educational facility.

Since the 1950s a rapid development of the city of Irkutsk took place. In 1947 streetcar routes were opened in the city and trolleybus routes were opened in 1972. In 1958 a TV center was established. The city&#x27;s larger districts and micro regions construction period began. New districts such as Baykalsky, Solnechny, Yubileyny, Primorsky, Akademgorodok and others were created.

==Administrative divisions==
==Economy==

The main industries of Irkutsk Oblast are metals, energy, logging, oil and fuels, machine-building, chemicals, food industry, and hydroelectricity. The average wages in Irkutsk Oblast are 10% higher than in Russia overall.

==Politics==

===Soviet era===
During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Irkutsk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). After the abolition of Article 6 of the Constitution of the USSR in March 1990, the CPSU lost its monopoly on power. The head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.
===Russian Federation===
The Charter of Irkutsk Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Irkutsk Oblast is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

==Demographics==

The oblast is very thinly populated, with a population density of 3 people per square kilometer, compared to a national average of 8.4. Irkutsk is the administrative center and largest city, with 612,973 residents. Other large cities are Bratsk (238,825 people), Angarsk (229,592 people), Ust-Ilimsk (83,635 people), and Usolye-Sibirskoye (80,331 people).

Most of the population are ethnic Russians. A minority group, the Buryats, have a special Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug inside the oblast. Russians and other Slavic/Germanic groups make up 92.9% of the population, according to the 2021 Census, while Buryats are 3.6%. Tofalars number 659, a decrease from 722 in 1989.
One small ethnic group, concentrated in three villages (Pikhtinsk, Sredne-Pikhtinsk, and Dagnik) in Zalarinsky District is the so-called &quot;Bug Hollanders&quot;: descendants of Polish-speaking Lutheran farmers who had moved to Siberia from the then Russian Volhynia in 1911–1912 in search of affordable land. Although they had long lost German (or Dutch) language of their ancestors (even in the early twentieth century they spoke Ukrainian and read Polish), they were still considered ethnic Germans, and during World War II were usually drafted for work in labor camps, instead of front-line military service.

===Religion===
According to a 2012 survey 28.1% of the population of Irkutsk Oblast adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 7% are unaffiliated generic Christians, 6% are Orthodox Christian believers without belonging to any church or are members of other (non-Russian) Orthodox churches, 2% of the population adheres to the Slavic native faith (Rodnovery), and 1% to Islam. In addition, 37% of the population declares to be &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, 17% is atheist, and 1.9% follows other religions or did not give an answer to the question.

<text> (, ) is a graduate engineering school, with roots back to 1854 as the &quot;École des arts industriels et des mines de Lille&quot;, re-organised in 1872 as &quot;Institut industriel du Nord&quot;. It is one of the Centrale Graduate Schools.

Its different curricula lead to the following French and European degrees:
* Ingénieur Centralien de Lille (Centralien Graduate engineer Masters program with EUR-ACE EURopean ACcredited Engineer label)
* Masters Recherche &amp; Doctorat (PhD doctorate studies)
* Mastères Spécialisés (MS) (Specialized Masters)
* Massive open online course in project management.

Academic activities and industrial applied research are performed mainly in French and English languages. Students from a dozen of nationalities participate to the different curricula at .

Most of the 1,300 graduate engineer students at live in dedicated residential buildings nearby research labs and metro public transports on a science and technology campus (Cité Scientifique) that is shared with 20,000 students from the University of Lille.

The school is located in the campus of Science and Technology (Cité Scientifique) of the University of Lille in Villeneuve-d&#x27;Ascq (European Metropolis of Lille - Hauts-de-France).

== History ==
 was founded as École des arts industriels et des mines de Lille in 1854, the same year when Louis Pasteur became the dean of &quot;Faculté des sciences de Lille&quot; and pioneered applied research with industry cooperations, with support of scientists such as Charles Frédéric Kuhlmann. Between 1854 and 1871, students attending the two-year curriculum grew to 90 per annum. Baccalaureate was a prerequisite to admission to the engineering school.

In 1872 lectures and research activities in the engineering school were reorganised into a three-year curriculum and developed within its Institut industriel du Nord, with a focus on civil engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry and manufacturing engineering. Electrical engineering full courses were added in 1892, automobile design has been taught from 1899 onwards. More than 200 students graduated in year 1914. Aerodynamics studies started in 1930. A stress on automatic control and computers was initiated in 1957. Later came courses and research in computer science, supply chain management, materials science, micro-electronics and telecommunications.

Since early 20th century, student admission has been based on a competitive exam after attending a classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles or similar undergraduate studies.

École Centrale de Lille was originally located in Lille central district from 1854 to 1875. Larger buildings with dedicated laboratories were inaugurated in 1875 nearby the &quot;Faculté des sciences de Lille&quot;. It then moved in 1968 in the modern campus of Lille University of Science and Technology (Cité Scientifique), in the south-east suburb of Lille.

== Admission ==


Admission to the Centralien engineering Programme implemented at École Centrale de Lille is possible after two/three year scientific undergraduate studies and requires success to either:
* an admission exam for the Bachelor of Science degree : CASTing - Concours d&#x27;Admission sur Titre Ingénieur (2-year curriculum)
* a French nationwide selective exam with &quot;numerus clausus&quot; : concours Centrale-Supelec (3-year curriculum including at least 2 years in France)
* a selective application as per TIME double degrees procedures applicable in Europe (2+2-year curriculum, including 2 years in France)
* a selective application as per TIME Overseas double degree procedures applicable for selected Universities and Institutes of Technology in Brasil, Canada, Chile, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea (2+2-year curriculum, including 2 years in France)
* a selective application as per IMCC procedure for one-semester or one-year accredited post-graduate study period in France and USA (1 year curriculum)
* a specific application process for other international students presented by their originating University.

The Centralien Programme typically lasts three years and results in a master&#x27;s degree, augmented with international experience. Thus undergraduate studies + the Centralien Programme account for more than a cumulated 300 ECTS credit in the European education system.

However, graduate students enrolled in the TIME double degree procedure are required to spend two-years at École Centrale de Lille and spend two years in the TIME-partner institute for a total of four years resulting in a double master&#x27;s degree.

Not to mention that 18% students attending courses at École Centrale de Lille are international students, all students enrolled in the Centralien Programme have an international exposure with opportunities to perform industry training and internship in enterprises worldwide, study abroad for 1 year in selected partner institutes providing Master (M2) courses, or be part of the 2+2 year TIME double degree programme.

In addition to the Centralien Programme, École Centrale de Lille provides a range of master&#x27;s degree cursus in science and engineering that are opened to applicants who have completed their undergraduate studies in other institutes. Admission to Masters&#x27; second-year research cursus (M2R) is also possible for applicants who have performed their Master&#x27;s first year (M1) in another institute and wish to focus on a research topic associated to Centrale Lille research labs.

Admission to one of the 6 Masters (M1+M2 or M2) from École Centrale de Lille is possible upon an application assessment process based on academic criteria. Note that Masters/Research (M2R) workload is 60 ECTS credits and may be the starting point for doctorate studies. These 6 Masters and a larger number of Masters (M2) from other Centrale Graduate Schools and from partner institutes are also possible as electives for a double degree alongside the Centralien Programme.

Admission to one of the 6 Specialized Masters for Master-level specialization and continuing education in specific engineering and management fields is possible upon application assessment based on candidate profile. Prerequisite to apply for this specialized curriculum is to already hold a Master or an equivalent postgraduate degree in a different scientific field. MS lectures at École Centrale de Lille are taught in English and/or in French. MS workload is 75 ECTS credits.

In partnership with ENSI Poitiers and ISAE-ENSMA, Ecole Centrale de Lille is a part of the prestigious International Master&#x27;s Program in Turbulence. At the end of this highly selective two-year program, students are awarded a master&#x27;s degree in Fluid Dynamics and Turbulence.
== Research ==

École Centrale de Lille is a member of the European Doctoral College Lille Nord de France that provides 400 doctorate dissertations every year. École Centrale de Lille delivers the Doctorate degree in 7 Engineering Sciences specialities.

<text>Tahrs ( , ) or tehrs ( ) are large artiodactyl ungulates related to goats and sheep. There are three species, all native to Asia. Previously thought to be closely related to each other and placed in a single genus, &quot;Hemitragus&quot;, genetic studies have since proven that they are not so closely related and they are now considered as members of three separate monotypic genera: &quot;Hemitragus&quot; is now reserved for the Himalayan tahr, &quot;Nilgiritragus&quot; for the Nilgiri tahr, and &quot;Arabitragus&quot; for the Arabian tahr.

==Ranges==
While the Arabian tahr of Oman and the Nilgiri tahr of South India both have small ranges and are considered endangered, the Himalayan tahr remains relatively widespread in the Himalayas, and has been introduced to the Southern Alps of New Zealand, where it is hunted recreationally. Also, a population exists on Table Mountain in South Africa, descended from a pair of tahrs that escaped from a zoo in 1936, but most of these have been culled. As for the Nilgiri tahr, research indicates its presence to be in the mountain ranges of southern India. Totalling ~1400 individuals in 1998, its largest remaining population appears to survive between the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, where it may be vulnerable to poachers and illegal hunting.

==Behavior==
A routine of feeding during the morning followed by a long rest period, then feeding in the evening, constitutes the tahr&#x27;s daily routine. Tahrs are not generally active or feed at night and can be found at the same location morning and evening.

==Tamilnadu==
Nilgiri Tahr is the state animal of Tamil Nadu. It has references from Tamil Sangam Literature like Cilappatikaram and Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi. In 2023, Tamil nadu government has declared October 7 as Nilgiri Tahr Day in honour of E. R. C. Davidar

<doc id="79488" wikidata="Q421922" url="?curid=79488" title="Paper shredder">
<text>A paper shredder is a mechanical device used to cut sheets of paper into either strips or fine particles. Government organizations, businesses, and private individuals use shredders to destroy private, confidential, or otherwise sensitive documents.

==History==
===Invention===
The first paper shredder is credited to inventor Abbot Augustus Low, whose patent was filed on February 2, 1909. His invention was never manufactured because he died prematurely soon after filing the patent.

Adolf Ehinger&#x27;s paper shredder, based on a hand-crank pasta maker, was the first to be manufactured in 1935 in Germany. Supposedly he created a shredding machine to shred his anti-Nazi leaflets to avoid the inquiries of the authorities. Ehinger later marketed and began selling his patented shredders to government agencies and financial institutions switching from hand-crank shredders to electric motor shredders. Ehinger&#x27;s company, EBA Maschinenfabrik, manufactured the first cross-cut paper shredders in 1959 and continues to do so today as EBA Krug &amp; Priester GmbH &amp; Co. in Balingen.

Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, a “wet shredder” was invented in the former German Democratic Republic. To prevent paper shredders in the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) from glutting, this device mashed paper snippets with water.

With a shift from paper to digital document production, modern industrial shredders can process non-paper media, such as credit cards and CDs, and destroy thousands of documents in under one minute.

===Applications===
Until the mid-1980s, it was rare for paper shredders to be used by non-government entities.

A high-profile example of their use was when the U.S. embassy in Iran used shredders to reduce paper pages to strips before the embassy was taken over in 1979. Some documents were reconstructed from the strips, as detailed below.

After Colonel Oliver North told Congress that he used a Schleicher cross-cut model to shred Iran-Contra documents, sales increased nearly 20 percent in 1987.

Paper shredders became more popular among U.S. citizens with privacy concerns after the 1988 Supreme Court decision in &quot;California v. Greenwood&quot;; in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the warrantless search and seizure of garbage left for collection outside of a home. Anti-burning laws also resulted in increased demand for paper shredding.

More recently, concerns about identity theft have driven increased personal use of paper shredders, with the US Federal Trade Commission recommending that individuals shred financial documents before disposal.

Information privacy laws such as FACTA, HIPAA, and the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act drive shredder usage, as businesses and individuals take steps to securely dispose of confidential information.

==Types==
Shredders range in size and price. Small, inexpensive units are designed for a certain number of pages. Large, expensive units are used by commercial shredding services and can shred millions of documents per hour. While the smallest shredders may be hand-cranked, most shredders are electric.

Over time, new features were added to improve user experience, including rejecting paper over capacity to avoid jams, and other safety features to reduce risk. Some shredders designed for use in shared workspaces or department copy rooms have noise reduction.

===Mobile shredding truck===
Large organizations or shredding services sometimes use &quot;mobile shredding trucks&quot;, typically constructed as a box truck with an industrial-size paper shredder mounted inside with storage space for shredded materials. Such units may also provide the shredding of CDs, DVDs, hard drives, credit cards, and uniforms, among other things.

===Kiosks===
A &#x27;shredding kiosk&#x27; is an automated retail machine (or kiosk) that allows public access to a commercial or industrial-capacity paper shredder. This is an alternative solution to the use of a personal or business paper shredder, where the public can use a faster and more powerful shredder, paying for each shredding event rather than purchasing shredding equipment.

===Services===
Some companies outsource their shredding to &#x27;shredding services&#x27;. These companies either shred on-site, with mobile shredder trucks or have off-site shredding facilities. Documents slated for shredding are often placed in locked bins that are emptied periodically.

==Shredding method, and output==
As well as size and capacity, shredders are classified according to the method they use; and the size and shape of the shreds they produce.

*Strip-cut shredders use rotating knives to cut narrow strips as long as the original sheet of paper.
*Cross-cut or confetti-cut shredders use two contra-rotating drums to cut rectangular, parallelogram, or lozenge (diamond-shaped) shreds.
*Particle-cut or Micro-cut shredders create tiny square or circular pieces.
*Cardboard shredders are designed specifically to shred corrugated material into either strips or a mesh pallet.
*Disintegrators and &quot;granulators&quot; repeatedly cut the paper at random with rotating knives in a drum until the particles are small enough to pass through a fine mesh.
*Hammermills pound the paper through a screen.
*Pierce-and-tear shredders have rotating blades that pierce the paper and then tear it apart.
*Grinders have a rotating shaft with cutting blades that grind the paper until it is small enough to fall through a screen.

===Security levels===
There is a number of standards covering the security levels of paper shredders, including:

====&quot;Deutsches Institut für Normung&quot; (DIN)====
The previous DIN 32757 standard has now been replaced with DIN 66399. This is complex, but can be summarized as below:
*Level P-1 = ≤ 2000 mm2 particles or ≤ 12 mm wide strips of any length (For shredding general internal documents such as instructions, forms, expired notices)
*Level P-2 = ≤ 800 mm2 particles or ≤ 6 mm wide strips of any length
*Level P-3 = ≤ 320 mm2 particles or ≤ 2 mm wide strips of any length (For highly sensitive documents and personal data subject to high protection requirements, purchase order, order confirmations or delivery notes with address data)
*Level P-4 = ≤ 160 mm2 particles with width ≤ 6 mm (Particularly sensitive and confidential data, working documents, customer/client data, invoices, private tax and financial documents)
*Level P-5 = ≤ 30 mm2 particles with width ≤ 2 mm (Data that must be kept secret, balance sheets and profit-and-loss, strategy papers, design and engineering documents, personal data)
*Level P-6 = ≤ 10 mm2 particles with width ≤ 1 mm (Secret high-security data, patents, research and development documents)
*Level P-7 = ≤ 5 mm2 particles with width ≤ 1 mm (Top secret, highly classified data for the military, embassies, intelligence services)

====NSA/CSS====
The United States National Security Agency and Central Security Service produce &quot;NSA/CSS Specification 02-01 for High Security Crosscut Paper Shredders&quot;. They provide a list of evaluated shredders.

====ISO/IEC====
The International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission produce &quot;ISO/IEC 21964 Information technology — Destruction of data carriers&quot;. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in May 2018, regulates the handling and processing of personal data. ISO/IEC 21964 and DIN 66399 support data protection in business processes.

=== Legislation ===
Navigating the complex landscape of federal regulations for data protection and document destruction is crucial for businesses in maintaining compliance and avoiding penalties. Understanding these regulations ensures that sensitive information, whether in digital or physical form, is handled securely.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) - 1996 Established by the federal government, HIPAA mandates businesses to implement safeguards for protecting health information. Non-compliance can result in substantial fines. This act emphasizes the importance of handling medical records with utmost confidentiality and security. More information about HIPAA can be found on the CDC&#x27;s website.

Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) - 1984 The CFAA regulates how businesses manage sensitive data on digital platforms. It underscores that simply deleting files from a hard drive doesn&#x27;t guarantee data security. To ensure complete data destruction, the physical destruction of hard drive platters is necessary. Detailed information on CFAA is available at the U.S. Department of Justice website.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) - The GLBA sets forth guidelines for financial institutions on the disposal and management of financial records. This act ensures that financial documents are handled and destroyed in a manner that prevents unauthorized access and misuse. The Federal Trade Commission provides further details.

Legal Document Protection Across 32 States and Puerto Rico - A majority of states and Puerto Rico have enacted laws to safeguard identifying information managed by law firms, businesses, and government entities. These laws dictate the storage duration, handling, and destruction methods for legal documents, requiring them to be rendered unreadable or undecipherable. New York’s specific regulation can be explored at N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 399-H.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act - 2002 This act governs the retention period for business records before destruction is permissible. It&#x27;s vital for businesses to be aware of these retention times to ensure compliance. For further guidance, refer to the official bill text.

Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) - An amendment to the Fair Credit Report Act, FACTA protects consumers from identity theft by providing guidelines on the proper disposal and protection of customer data, including account numbers and social security numbers. The FTC’s website offers comprehensive information on FACTA.

Understanding and adhering to these federal regulations is vital for businesses to ensure the secure handling and destruction of sensitive data, thereby safeguarding against breaches and maintaining compliance. Information provided by Country Mile Document Destruction.

==Destruction of evidence==
There have been many instances where it is alleged that documents have been improperly or illegally destroyed by shredding, including:

*Oliver North shredded documents relating to the Iran–Contra affair between November 21 and November 25, 1986. During the trial, North testified that on November 21, 22, or 24, he witnessed John Poindexter destroy what may have been the only signed copy of a presidential covert action finding that sought to authorize CIA participation in the November 1985 Hawk missile shipment to Iran.
*According to the report of the Paul Volcker Committee, between April and December 2004, Kofi Annan&#x27;s &quot;Chef de Cabinet&quot;, Iqbal Riza, authorized thousands of United Nations documents shredded, including the entire chronological files of the Oil-for-Food Programme during the years 1997 through 1999.
*The Union Bank of Switzerland used paper shredders to destroy evidence that their company owned property stolen from Jews during the Holocaust by the Nazi government. The shredding was disclosed to the public through the work of Christoph Meili, a security guard working at the bank who happened to wander by a room where the shredding was taking place. Also in the shredding room were books from the German Reichsbank. They listed stock accounts for companies involved in the holocaust, including BASF, Degussa, and Degesch. They also listed real-estate records for Berlin properties that had been forcibly taken by the Nazis, placed in Swiss accounts, and then claimed to be owned by UBS. Destruction of such documents was a violation of Swiss laws.

==Unshredding and forensics==
To achieve their purpose, it should not be possible to reassemble and read shredded documents. In practice the feasibility of this depends on
* how well the shredding has been done, and
* the resources put into reconstruction.

The resources put into reconstruction should depend on the importance of the document, e.g. whether it is

* a simple personal matter,
* corporate espionage,
* a criminal matter,
* a matter of national security.

How easy reconstruction is will depend on:

* the size and legibility of the text
* whether the document is single- or double-sided
* the size and shape of the shredded pieces
*the orientation of the material when fed
*how effectively the shredded material is further randomized afterwards
*whether other processes such as pulping and chemical decomposition are used

Even without a full reconstruction, in some cases useful information can be obtained by forensic analysis of the paper, ink, and cutting method.

===Reconstruction examples===
*After the Iranian Revolution and the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979, Iranians enlisted local carpet weavers who reconstructed the pieces by hand. The recovered documents would be later released by the Iranian government in a series of books called &quot;Documents from the US espionage Den&quot;. The US government subsequently improved its shredding techniques by adding pulverizing, pulping, and chemical decomposition protocols.
*Modern computer technology considerably speeds up the process of reassembling shredded documents. The strips are scanned on both sides, and then a computer determines how the strips should be put together. Robert Johnson of the National Association for Information Destruction has stated that there is a huge demand for document reconstruction. Several companies offer commercial document reconstruction services. For maximum security, documents should be shredded so that the words of the document go through the shredder horizontally (i.e. perpendicular to the blades). Many of the documents in the Enron Accounting scandals were fed through the shredder the wrong way, making them easier to reassemble.
*In 2003, there was an effort underway to recover the shredded archives of the Stasi, the East German secret police. There are &quot;millions of shreds of paper that panicked Stasi officials threw into garbage bags during the regime&#x27;s final days in the fall of 1989&quot;. As it took three dozen people six years to reconstruct 300 of the 16,000 bags, the Fraunhofer-IPK institute has developed the &quot;Stasi-Schnipselmaschine&quot; (&#x27;Stasi snippet machine&#x27;) for computerized reconstruction and is testing it in a pilot project.
*The DARPA Shredder Challenge 2011 called upon computer scientists, puzzle enthusiasts, and anyone else with an interest in solving complex problems, to compete for up to $50,000 by piecing together a series of shredded documents. The Shredder Challenge consisted of five separate puzzles in which the number of documents, the document subject matter and the method of shredding were varied to present challenges of increasing difficulty. To complete each problem, participants were required to provide the answer to a puzzle embedded in the content of the reconstructed document. The overall prizewinner and prize awarded was dependent on the number and difficulty of the problems solved. DARPA declared a winner on December 2, 2011 (the winning entry was submitted 33 days after the challenge began) – the winner was &quot;All Your Shreds Are Belong To U.S.&quot; using a combination system that used automated sorting to pick the best fragment combinations to be reviewed by humans.

===Forensic identification===
The individual shredder that was used to destroy a given document may sometimes be of forensic interest. Shredders display certain device-specific characteristics, &quot;fingerprints&quot;, like the exact spacing of the blades, the degree and pattern of their wear. By closely examining the shredded material, the minute variations of size of the paper strips and the microscopic marks on their edges may be able to be linked to a specific machine. (c.f. the forensic identification of typewriters.)

==Recycling of waste==
The resulting shredded paper can be recycled in a number of ways, including:
*&quot;Animal bedding&quot; — To produce a warm and comfortable bed for animals
*&quot;Void fill and packaging&quot; — Void fill for the transportation of goods
*&quot;Briquettes&quot; — an alternative to non-renewable fuels
*&quot;Insulation&quot; — Shredded newsprint mixed with flame-retardant chemicals and glue to create a sprayable insulation material for wall interiors and the underside of roofing

<text>Belukha Mountain (; , also known as Beluga Mountain, Icemount Peak ( / ), or The Three Peaks ( / ), is the highest peak of the Altai Mountains in Russia and the highest of the South Siberian Mountains system. It is part of the Golden Mountains of Altai World Heritage Site.

Since 2008, one is required to apply for a special border zone permit in order to be allowed into the area (if travelling independently without using an agency). Foreigners should apply for the permit to their regional FSB border guard office two months before the planned date.
==Geography==
Located in the Altai Republic, Belukha is a three-peaked mountain massif that rises along the border of Russia and Kazakhstan, just a few dozen miles north of the point where this border meets with the border of China. There are several small glaciers on the mountain, including Belukha Glacier. Of the two peaks, the eastern peak (4,506 m, 14,784 ft.) is higher than the western peak (4,440 m, 14,567 ft.).

==History==
Belukha was first climbed in 1914 by the Tronov brothers. Most ascents of the eastern peak follow the same southern route as that taken in the first ascent. Though the Altai is lower in elevation than other Asian mountain groups, it is very remote, and much time and planning are required for its approach.

In the summer of 2001, a team of scientists traveled to the remote Belukha Glacier to assess the feasibility of extracting ice cores at the site. Research was carried out from 2001 to 2003: both shallow cores and cores to bedrock were extracted and analyzed (Olivier and others, 2003; Fujita and others, 2004). Based on tritium dating techniques, the deeper cores may contain as much as 3,000–5,000 years of climatic and environmental records. A Swiss-Russian team also studied the glacier.
