<text>Ventura County () is a county located in the southern part of the U.S. state of California. As of the 2020 census, the population was 843,843. The largest city is Oxnard, and the county seat is the city of Ventura.

Ventura County comprises the Oxnard–Thousand Oaks–Ventura, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is part of the Greater Los Angeles area (Los Angeles–Long Beach, CA Combined Statistical Area). It is also considered the southernmost county along the California Central Coast.

Two of the Channel Islands are part of the county: Anacapa Island, which is the most visited island in Channel Islands National Park, and San Nicolas Island.

==History==
===Indigenous===

Ventura County was historically inhabited by the Chumash people, who also settled much of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties, with their presence dating back 10,000–12,000 years. The Chumash were hunter-gatherers, fishermen, and also traders with the Mojave, Yokuts, and Tongva Indians. The Chumash are also known for their rock paintings and for their great basketry. Chumash Indian Museum in Thousand Oaks has several reconstructed Chumash houses (&#x27;apa) and there are several Chumash pictographs in the county, including the Burro Flats Painted Cave in Simi Valley. The plank canoe, called a &quot;tomol&quot; in Chumash, was important to their way of life. Canoe launching points on the mainland for trade with the Chumash of the Channel Islands were located at the mouth of the Ventura River, Mugu Lagoon and Point Hueneme. This has led to speculations among archeologists of whether the Chumash could have had a pre-historic contact with Polynesians. According to diachronic linguistics, certain words such as tomolo&#x27;o (canoe) could be related to Polynesian languages. The dialect of the Chumash language that was spoken in Ventura County was Ventureño.

Several place names in the county has originated from Chumash, including Ojai, which means moon, and Simi Valley, which originates from the word Shimiyi and refers to the stringy, thread-like clouds that typify the region. Others include Point Mugu from the word Muwu (meaning &quot;beach&quot;), Saticoy from the word Sa&#x27;aqtiko&#x27;y (meaning &quot;sheltered for the wind&quot;), and Sespe Creek from the word S&#x27;eqp&#x27;e (meaning &quot;kneecap&quot;).

===Spanish period===

In October 1542, the expedition led by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo anchored in an inlet near Point Mugu; its members were the first Europeans to arrive in the area that would become Ventura County.

Active occupation of California by Spain began in 1769. Gaspar de Portolà led a military expedition by land from San Diego to Monterey, passing through Ventura County in August of that year. A priest with the expedition, Father Juan Crespí, kept a journal of the trip and noted that the area was ideal for a mission to be established and it was a &quot;good site to which nothing is lacking&quot;. Also on this expedition was Father Junípero Serra, who later founded a mission on this site.

On March 31, 1782, the Mission San Buenaventura was founded by Father Serra. It is named after Saint Bonaventure, one of the early intellectual founders of the Franciscan order. The town that grew up around the mission was originally named San Buenaventura (and retains the name officially), it has been known as Ventura since 1891.

In the 1790s, the Spanish Governor of California began granting land concessions to Spanish Californians who were often retiring soldiers. These concessions were known as ranchos and consisted of thousands of acres of land that were used primarily as ranch land for livestock. In Ventura County, Rancho Simi was granted in 1795 and Rancho El Conejo in 1802. Fernando Tico was granted Ojai and part of Ventura by Gov. Alvarado.

===Mexican period===

In 1822, California was notified of Mexico&#x27;s independence from Spain and the Governor of California, the Junta, the military in Monterey and the priests and neophytes at Mission San Buenaventura swore allegiance to Mexico on April 11, 1822. California land that had been vested in the King of Spain was now owned by the nation of Mexico.

By the 1830s, Mission San Buenaventura was in a decline with fewer neophytes joining the mission. The number of cattle owned by the mission dropped from first to fifteenth ranking in the California Missions. The missions were secularized by the Mexican government in 1834. The Mexican governors began granting land rights to Mexican Californians, often retiring soldiers. By 1846, there were 19 rancho grants in Ventura County. In 1836, Mission San Buenaventura was transferred from the Church to a secular administrator. The natives who had been working at the mission gradually left to work on the ranchos. By 1839, only 300 Indians were left at the Mission and it slipped into neglect.

Several outhouses dating back to the 1800s were discovered in July 2007, at a site that had been cleared to prepare for development. The area proved to be a treasure trove for archaeologists who braved the lingering smell in the dirt to uncover artifacts that showed heavy utilization by mission inhabitants, Indians, early settlers and Spanish and Mexican soldiers.

===American period===
The Mexican–American War began in 1846 but its effect was not felt in Ventura County until 1847. In January of that year, Captain John C. Frémont led the California Battalion into San Buenaventura to find that the Europeans had fled, leaving only Native Americans in the Mission. Fremont and the Battalion continued south to sign the Treaty of Cahuenga with General Andrés Pico. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo formally transferred California to the United States in 1848.

By 1849, a constitution had been adopted for the California territory. The new Legislature met and divided the pending state into 27 counties. At the time, the area that would become Ventura County was the southern part of Santa Barbara County.

The 1860s brought many changes to the area. A drought caused many of the ranchos to experience financial difficulties and most were divided, sub-divided and sold. Large sections of land were bought by eastern capitalists based on favorable reports of petroleum deposits. A United States Post Office was opened at Mission San Buenaventura in 1861. On April 1, 1866, the town of San Buenaventura was incorporated, becoming the first officially recognized town in what would become Ventura County.

On January 1, 1873, Ventura County was officially split from Santa Barbara County, bringing a flurry of change. That same year, a courthouse and wharf were built in San Buenaventura. A bank was opened and the first public library was created. The school system grew, with the first high school opening in 1890.

Other towns were being established in the county. A plan for Hueneme (later Port Hueneme) was recorded in 1874, and Santa Paula&#x27;s plan was recorded in 1875. Along the banks of the Santa Clara River, the township of New Jerusalem (which would eventually be named El Rio) was founded in 1875 by the owner of general store named Simon Cohen who became its first postmaster and banker in 1882. The community of Nordhoff (later renamed Ojai) was started in 1874. Bardsdale, Fillmore, Piru, and Montalvo were established in 1887. 1892 saw Simi (later Simi Valley), Somis, Saticoy, and Moorpark. Oxnard was a latecomer, not being established until 1898.

The Southern Pacific Railroad laid tracks through San Buenaventura in 1887. For convenience in printing their timetables, Southern Pacific shortened San Buenaventura to Ventura. The Post Office soon followed suit. While the city remains officially known as San Buenaventura, it is more commonly referred to as Ventura. The rail line to Northern California originally went through Saugus, Fillmore and Santa Paula, providing a boom to those communities along the line. In 1905, Tunnel #26 was completed between Chatsworth and Corriganville near Simi Valley, shortening the rail route. At a length of , Tunnel #26 was the longest tunnel ever constructed in its day. This tunnel joined to the railroad spur coming the other direction from Montalvo through Camarillo, Moorpark and Simi Valley, making the contemporary main line used today. One stop along the way, at a 90-degree turn, was at a sugar beet processing factory. The factory bore the name of its absentee owners, the Oxnard Brothers. A small community of farm and factory workers grew near the train stop. That community, now bearing the name of the factory shortened to the one word train stop Oxnard, has become the largest city in Ventura County.
Oil has been known in Ventura County since before the arrival of the Europeans, as the native Chumash people used tar from natural seeps as a sealant and waterproofing for baskets and canoes. In the 1860s, several attempts were made to harvest the petroleum products under Ventura County but none were financially successful, and the oil speculators eventually changed from oil to land development. In 1913, oil exploration began in earnest, with Ralph Lloyd obtaining the financial support of veteran oil man Joseph B. Dabney. Their first well, named &quot;Lloyd No. 1&quot;, was started on January 20, 1914. The well struck oil at but was destroyed when it went wild. Other wells met a similar fate, until 1916, when a deal was struck with the Shell Oil Company. 1916 was the year that the large South Mountain Oil Field was discovered; other deals followed with General Petroleum in 1917 and Associated Oil Company in 1920. At its peak, the largest oil field in the county, the Ventura Avenue oilfield, discovered in 1919 in the hills north of Ventura, was producing of oil a day, with annual production of over 1.5million barrels. More oil fields came online in the 1920s and 1930s, with the Rincon field, the second largest, in 1927, and the adjacent San Miguelito in 1931.

In the early hours of the morning of March 12–13, 1928, the St. Francis Dam collapsed, sending nearly of water rushing through the Santa Clarita Valley killing as many as 600 people, destroying 1,240 homes and flooding of land, devastating farm fields and orchards. This was the single largest disaster to strike Ventura County and the second largest, in terms of lives lost, in the state.

===Modern period===
Ventura County can be separated into two major parts, East County and West County, which are divided by the Conejo Grade. East County consists of all cities east of the Conejo Grade. Geographically East County is the end of the Santa Monica Mountains, in which the Conejo Valley is located, and where there is a considerable increase in elevation. Communities which are considered to be in the East County are Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park, Lake Sherwood, Hidden Valley, Santa Rosa Valley, part of Westlake Village, Oak Park, Moorpark, and Simi Valley. A majority of these communities are in the Conejo Valley.

West County, which is everything west of the Conejo Grade, consists of communities such as Camarillo, Oxnard, Somis, Point Mugu, Port Hueneme, Ventura, Ojai, Santa Paula, and Fillmore. West County consists of some of the first developed cities in the county. The largest beach communities are located in West County on the coastline of the Channel Islands Harbor.

Starting in the mid-20th century, there was a large growth in population in the East County, moving from the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles and out into the Conejo and Simi Valleys. Part of the Conejo Valley is situated in Los Angeles County. This part consists of Calabasas, Hidden Hills, Agoura Hills, Agoura, and Westlake Village. The other half of the Conejo Valley, which belongs to Ventura County, consists of Lake Sherwood, Hidden Valley, Oak Park, Thousand Oaks, and Newbury Park, which was formerly an unincorporated area that is now the most westerly part of Thousand Oaks. Many working-class people migrated to this area during the 1960s and 1970s out of East and Central Los Angeles. As a result, there was a large growth in population into the Conejo Valley and into Ventura County through the U.S. Route 101 corridor. Making the U.S. 101 a full freeway in the 1960s, and the expansions that followed, helped make commuting to Los Angeles easier and opened the way for development westward. The communities that have seen the most substantial development are Calabasas, Hidden Hills, Agoura Hills, Westlake Village, Thousand Oaks, and Newbury Park. The neighboring East County area of Simi Valley saw its already considerable population of nearly 60,000 inhabitants in 1970 grow to over 100,000 over the following two decades.

Development moved farther down the U.S. 101 corridor and sent population rising in West County cities as well. The largest population growth there has been in Camarillo, Oxnard, and Ventura. Development in the East County and along the US 101 corridor is rare today, because most of these cities, such as Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley, are approaching build-out. Although the area still has plenty of open space and land, almost all of it is in greenbelts between the cities. Because of this, its private low-key location, its country feel, and its proximity to Los Angeles, the Conejo Valley area has become a very attractive place to live. Like most areas of Ventura County, it once had relatively inexpensive real estate, but prices have risen sharply. For example, real estate in Newbury Park has increased in price by more than 250% in the last 10 years.

====Thomas Fire====

The Thomas Fire was a massive wildfire that affected Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties, and one of multiple wildfires that ignited in Southern California in December 2017. It burned approximately , becoming the largest wildfire in modern California history, before it was fully contained on January 12, 2018.

The Thomas Fire destroyed at least 1,063 structures, while damaging 280 others; and the fire caused over $2.176 billion (2018 USD) in damages, including more than $204.5 million in suppression costs, becoming the seventh-most destructive wildfire in state history. The agriculture industry suffered at least $171 million in losses due to the Thomas Fire. Southern California Edison paid the county over $11 million in claims related to damages and costs since its equipment was likely associated with one ignition point of the fire near Santa Paula.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (16.5%) is water.

Parts of the county are on the Oxnard Plain which includes the cities of Oxnard, Camarillo, Port Hueneme and much of Ventura. Other cities and communities lie in the intermountain valleys of the Transverse Range. The Santa Clara River Valley is the most prominent valley, while other valleys include Conejo Valley, Simi Valley, Santa Rosa Valley, Tierra Rejada Valley and Las Posas Valley. Other parts of the county are on small coastal mountains, such as the Santa Ynez Mountains, Simi Hills, Santa Monica Mountains and the Piru Mountains. Most of the population of Ventura County lives in the southern portion of the county. The major population centers are the Oxnard Plain and the Simi and Conejo Valleys. In local media, the county is usually split between the eastern portion, generally associated with the San Fernando Valley, and the western portion, often referred to as &quot;Oxnard-Ventura&quot;. To the east is Los Angeles County.

Because the total amount of precipitation is small, conserving water and obtaining water from additional sources outside of Ventura County are vital concerns. The climate, though mostly mild and dry, varies because of the variations in topography through for instance differences in elevation and physical geography. The Santa Clara River is the principal waterway. Lake Casitas, an artificial reservoir, is the largest body of water.

The highest peaks in the county include Mount Pinos (), Frazier Mountain (), and Reyes Peak () in the Transverse Ranges. The uplands are well-timbered with coniferous forests, and receive plentiful snow in the winter. Mount Pinos is sacred to the Chumash Indians. It is known to them as Iwihinmu, and was considered to be the center of the universe; being the highest peak in the vicinity, it has unimpeded views in three directions.

The USDA Economic Research Service rated Ventura County the most desirable county to live in the 48 contiguous states, using six metrics of climate (&quot;mild, sunny winters, temperate summers, low humidity&quot;), topographic variation, and access to water, &quot;that reflect environmental qualities most people prefer.&quot;

=== Physical geography ===
There are outside of national forest land in Ventura County, which means that 53 percent of the county&#x27;s total area is made up of national forest. Of the land outside of national forest land, approximately 59 percent is agricultural and 17.5 percent urban. North of Highway 126, the county is mountainous and mostly uninhabited, and contains some of the most unspoiled, rugged and inaccessible wilderness remaining in southern California. Most of this land is in the Los Padres National Forest, and includes the Chumash Wilderness in the northernmost portion, adjacent to Kern County, as well as the large Sespe Wilderness and portions of both the Dick Smith Wilderness and Matilija Wilderness (both of these protected areas straddle the line with Santa Barbara County). All of the wilderness areas are within the jurisdiction of Los Padres National Forest.

The coastal plain was formed by the deposition of sediments from the Santa Clara River and from the streams of the Calleguas-Conejo drainage system. It has a mean elevation of , but at points south of the Santa Clara River, the elevation is as much as , and at points north of the river, as much as . The coastal plain is generally known as the Oxnard Plain with the part that centers on Camarillo lying east of the Revelon Slough is called Pleasant Valley. Most of the arable land in the county is found on the coastal plain. Small coastal mountains rim Ventura County on its landward side. They range in elevation from along the coast south of the coastal plain, to about in the Santa Monica Mountains. The Santa Ynez Mountains, the Topatopa Mountains, and the Piru Mountains make up the northern boundary of the coastal plain, the Santa Susana Mountains are alongside the eastern boundary of the county, and the Simi Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains are along the southern border with Los Angeles County. South Mountain and Oak Ridge are low and long mountains that separate Santa Clara Valley from the Las Posas Valley and Simi Valley. The Camarillo Hills and the Las Posas Hills extend from Camarillo to Simi Valley and separate the Las Posas-Simi area from the Santa Rosa Valley and Tierra Rejada Valley.
The intermountain valley of the Santa Clara River is the most prominent valley in the county and trends east–southwest. The Santa Clara River drains an area of and flows from its headwaters in Los Angeles to where it empties into the Pacific. Its principal tributaries are Piru Creek, Santa Paula Creek, and Sespe Creek. The valley of the Ventura River is a narrow valley north of Ventura. Ojai Valley is connected to the Ventura River Valley by San Antonio Creek. The small Upper Ojai Valley, east of Ojai Valley and higher, drains to the Ventura River on the west and to Santa Paula Creek on the east. Ojai and Upper Ojai Valleys are surrounded by mountains and are rich agricultural areas. The Ventura River flows south and drains an area of . Over South Mountain and Oak Ridge, south of the Santa Clara River, are Las Posas Valley and Simi Valley. Las Posas Valley extends eastward from the Oxnard Plain almost to Simi Valley, which is in the east end of Ventura County. The city of Simi Valley is bounded on the east by the Santa Susana Mountains and on the south by the Simi Hills. To the south, over the Camarillo- and Las Posas Hills, are Santa Rosa- and Tierra Rejada Valleys, which extend from Camarillo eastward for . In the hills south of Santa Rosa Valley is the broad Conejo Valley. Santa Rosa Valley, Conejo Valley, Simi Valley, and Tierra Rejada Valley are drained by Calleguas Creek and its principal tributary, Conejo Creek. These creeks originate in the Santa Susana and Santa Monica Mountains.

The county&#x27;s diverse coastline features a variety of terrain. There are many State beaches: Emma Wood, San Buenaventura, McGrath, and Mandalay State Beach. Other beaches include Channel Islands Beach, Solimar Beach, Oxnard Beach Park, and Silver Strand Beach. While Point Mugu State Park is known for its steep coastal terrain with little beach access, nearby County Line Beach in the south coast community of Solromar is part of the fabled Malibu coastline. Ventura County has plenty of other surf spots along the coast including the notable surf spot, Rincon Point, on the Santa Barbara County-line.

The Channel Islands in Ventura County are Anacapa and San Nicholas Islands.

=== Climate ===

Ventura County has a considerable range in climate because of differences in topography between one part of the county and another. Rainfall is limited in summer and crops have to be irrigated. The average annual temperature is near 60 °F at low elevations near the ocean, in the 50s over most of the northern two-thirds of the county, and less than 45 °F in the Topatopa Mountains. The annual range in temperature is between 70 °F and 80 °F on the Coastal Plain and as much as 100 °F in the interior. For July, the average maximum temperature is between 70 °F and 80 °F on the Coastal Plain but exceeds 90 °F in the upper part of the Ventura- and Cuyama River Valleys. For January, the average minimum temperature is near 40 °F on the coast but in the lower 30s and upper 20s in the northern parts of Ventura County. No temperature data are available for the highest point in the county, Mount Pinos. The length of the growing season ranges more than 300 days near the coast to less than 175 days in the coldest part in northern Ventura County. In both the northern and southern ends of the county, the annual precipitation totals between ten and fifteen inches. In the Topatopa Mountains, the annual total is more than thirty-three inches. The drier parts of the county get less than five inches of rain annually, and the higher and wetter parts get more than 60 inches annually. Measureable amounts of rainfall in Ventura County are reported on thirty to thirty-five days annually, and half an inch or more on six to twelve days annually. In the northern parts of Ventura County, snowfall averages five inches or more per year, and along the northern border and Mount Pinos, more than twenty inches.

====Air quality====

Automobile emissions account for most of the air pollution. Other sources include chemical plants, gasoline stations, paint and cleaning products.

===Housing===
Ventura County typically has limited housing inventory, making it a consistently expensive location in Southern California, where it is usually the third-most-expensive county behind Orange and Los Angeles counties. , the county was not on track to meet its state-mandated housing goals. Individual cities are responsible for meeting their assigned housing goals, while the county government is responsible for housing goals in unincorporated areas. Several affordable housing groups that are actively working on building housing for veterans and low income people have long waiting lists. Farmworker housing also has waiting lists though designated units continue to be built.

===Metropolitan Statistical Area===
The United States Office of Management and Budget has designated Ventura County as the Oxnard–Thousand Oaks–Ventura, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area. The United States Census Bureau ranked the Oxnard–Thousand Oaks–Ventura, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area as the 66th most populous metropolitan statistical area of the United States as of July 1, 2012.

The Office of Management and Budget has further designated the Oxnard–Thousand Oaks–Ventura, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area as a component of the more extensive Los Angeles–Long Beach, CA Combined Statistical Area, the second most populous combined statistical area and primary statistical area of the United States as of July 1, 2012.

==Economy==

In 2019, the county faced a weak economic outlook due to the declining housing affordability and lack of job growth.

=== Agriculture ===
Lemons are the number two crop in the county according to the 2018 crop and livestock report. The economic value of lemons is more than $244 million a year, Valencia oranges are nearly $20 million a year, and mandarins/tangelos are more than $17 million a year.

The county became a major producer in the state for hemp after it was removed from a list of controlled substances along with other provisions of the Hemp Farming Act of 2018. These provisions were included in the 2018 Farm Bill which made hemp legal for agricultural uses. The agricultural commissioner enforces state rules regarding testing of the plants, varieties that can be grown and registration of acreage. By October 2019, close to for cultivation and seed breeding have been registered in the county. The annual crop report had 3,470 harvestable acres for 2019 with an estimated gross value $35.5 million.

Several cities within the county are banning or have a moratorium on the planting, harvesting, drying, processing and manufacture of hemp products. These city councils were reacting to complaints about the smell. With some fields in unincorporated area being near residences, homeowners also brought their concerns to the county board of supervisors.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCS 2019/11/06 Nyeland Acres&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The acreage available for planting was reduced when a buffer zone was established around schools and residential communities in 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCS 2020/01/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cannabis===

State law says local governments may not prohibit adults from growing, using or transporting marijuana for personal use but they can prohibit companies from growing, testing, and selling cannabis within their jurisdiction by licensing none or only some of these activities. The state allows deliveries without local agency licensing at the point of delivery.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCS 2019/01/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the legalization of the sale and distribution of cannabis in California, Ventura County voters approved Measure O in 2020, which sets up taxes on marijuana cultivation, as well as limits on the amounts of growing. Allowing retail sales to the general public in the unincorporated areas was not approved as part of the referendum although sales are allowed within the cities of Port Hueneme and Ojai. It restricted operations to the inside of existing greenhouses with only of commercial cannabis allowed within the county, though an additional is available for nursery cultivation.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCS 2021/08/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A greenhouse facility, on which construction had begun in 1996 to grow tomatoes and other produce, began preparing to grow cannabis in 2021 under the rules put in place by Measure O.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCS 2020/10/03&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government and policing===
====County supervisors====
Ventura County is administered by five elected Supervisors who each serve four year terms. They appoint the county executive officer who appoints non-elected department administrators who manage county functions. The county seal, that was adopted in 1964, was reviewed in 2022 due to prominent depiction of Junípero Serra that could be hurtful to those who allege that Serra was responsible for the suppression of the culture of Chumash people. The seal also had images referring to atomic energy and oil drilling that no longer represented the county industries. A new seal was adopted that depicts Arch Rock off Anacapa Island.

====Ventura County Sheriff====
The Ventura County Sheriff provides court protection, county jail administration, and patrol for the unincorporated areas of the county plus contracted police services for the incorporated cities of Thousand Oaks, Fillmore, Camarillo, Moorpark, and Ojai.

====Municipal police departments====
The incorporated cities of Ventura, Oxnard, Simi Valley, Port Hueneme, and Santa Paula have municipal police departments.

=== 2040 General Plan ===
In 2020, the County of Ventura updated its general plan to the Ventura County 2040 General Plan, as mandated by the California Office of Planning and Research. This document establishes guidelines and a regulatory basis for development and policy-making in the county until it is updated again in 2040. The County held surveys, workshops, advisory committees, and hearings to encourage community participation in the process of shaping and adopting the Ventura County 2040 General Plan. The final 2040 General Plan, adopted on September 15, 2020, by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, is centered on the following nine elements of governance:

* Land Use and Community Character
* Housing
* Circulation, Transportation, and Mobility
* Public Facilities, Services, and Infrastructure
* Conservation and Open Space
* Hazards and Safety
* Agriculture
* Water Resources
* Economic Vitality.

The Environmental Impact Review done by the state on the Ventura County 2040 General Plan Update, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act, projects that the county will see a population increase of 13% from 2018 to 2040. As such, the review found no significant population or housing need changes anticipated for the county during this period.

A 2020 lawsuit filed against the county by The Ventura County Coalition of Labor, Agriculture and Business and the Ventura County Agricultural Association opposed policies in the 2040 General Plan which restricted oil and gas development, raised costs of agriculture, set high housing quality standards, and limited brush clearance. The suit was settled in February 2023 with the county&#x27;s adoption of an Implementation Clarification for Certain Policies and Programs Contained in the 2040 General Plan, which stated the county&#x27;s ongoing support of agricultural operations without altering the content of the Plan.

==Politics==
For many years, Ventura County voted consistently for Republican candidates for local, statewide and federal offices. Only recently has the county begun favoring Democratic candidates in both federal and state elections. While Republicans used to win a large majority of votes throughout the 1970s and 1980s, no party received greater than 55% of the county&#x27;s vote from 1992 to 2016. Prior to Barack Obama&#x27;s victory in the county in 2008, the last Democrat to win a majority was Lyndon Johnson in 1964, though Democrat Bill Clinton carried the county by a plurality in both of his victories in 1992 and 1996.

On March 3, 2008, Democratic registration surpassed Republican registration and the former&#x27;s edge has grown since. The cities of Camarillo, Moorpark, Simi Valley, and Thousand Oaks all have voter rolls with Republican pluralities. The remaining cities and towns in the county have a Democratic plurality or majority on the voter rolls, while the unincorporated areas are split almost evenly between the two major parties.

With a population at the 2020 census of 115,162, Provo is the fourth-largest city in Utah and the principal city in the Provo-Orem metropolitan area, which had a population of 526,810 at the 2010 census. It is Utah&#x27;s second-largest metropolitan area after Salt Lake City.

Provo is the home to Brigham Young University (BYU), a private higher education institution operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Provo also has the LDS Church&#x27;s largest Missionary Training Center (MTC). The city is a focus area for technology development in Utah, with several billion-dollar startups. The city&#x27;s Peaks Ice Arena was a venue for the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002.

==History==

The Provo area was originally called Timpanogas, a Numic (Ute people) word perhaps meaning &quot;rock river&quot;. The area was inhabited by the Timpanogos. It was the largest and most settled area in modern-day Utah. The ample food from the Provo River made the Timpanogos a peaceful people. The area also served as the traditional meeting place for the Ute and Shoshone tribes and was used as a common location for worship of their creator deity.

Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, a Spanish Franciscan missionary-explorer, is considered the first European explorer to have visited the area in 1776. He was guided by two Timpanogos Utes, whom he called Silvestre and Joaquín. Escalante chronicled this first European exploration across the Great Basin Desert. The Europeans did not build a permanent settlement but traded with the Timpanogos, whom they called Lagunas (lake people) or Come Pescado (fish eaters).

In 1847, the Mormon pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, which was just north of Timpanogos Mountain. At first, the Natives were friendly with the Mormons. But, as relations deteriorated with the Shoshoni and Utes because of disputes over land and cattle, tensions rose. Because of the reported stolen goods of settlers by the Utes, Brigham Young gave small militia orders &quot;to take such measures as would put a final end to their [Indian] depredations in future.&quot; This ended in what is known as the Battle Creek massacre, in modern-day Pleasant Grove, Utah.
The Mormons continued pushing into Timpanog lands. In 1849, 33 Mormon families from Salt Lake City established Fort Utah. In 1850, Brigham Young sent an army from Salt Lake to drive out the Timpanogos in what is called the Provo War. Escalating tensions with the Timpanog contributed to the Walker War. Fort Utah was renamed Provo in 1850 for Étienne Provost, an early French-Canadian trapper who arrived in the region in 1825.

In 1850, the first schoolhouse was constructed in Provo, built within Utah Fort.

As more Latter-day Saints arrived, Provo quickly grew as a city. It soon was nicknamed &quot;The Garden City&quot; with a large number of fruit orchards and gardens there.

In 1872, a railroad reached Provo. It was also this year that the Provo Woolen Mills opened. They were the first large factory in Provo and employed about 150 people, initially mainly skilled textile laborers who had emigrated from Britain.

There is a large hillside letter &quot;Y&quot; made of whitewashed concrete halfway up the steep mountain, built in the early part of the 20th century to commemorate BYU (original plans included construction use of all three letters). Wild deer (and less frequently, cougars, and moose) still roam the mountains (and occasionally the city streets). The geography allows for hiking, skiing, fishing and other outdoor activities.

<text>Bourges ( ; ; &quot;Borges&quot; in Berrichon) is a commune in central France on the river Yèvre. It is the capital of the department of Cher, and also was the capital city of the former province of Berry.

==History==

The name of the commune derives either from the Bituriges, the name of the original inhabitants, or from the Germanic word &quot;&quot; (French: &quot;bourg&quot;; Spanish: &quot;burgo&quot;; English, others: &quot;burgh&quot;, &quot;&quot;, or &quot;borough&quot;), for &quot;hill&quot; or &quot;village&quot;. The Celts called it &quot;Avaricon&quot;; Latin-speakers: &quot;Avaricum&quot;. In the fourth century BC, as in the time of Caesar, the area around it was the center of a Gallic (Celtic) confederacy.

In 52 BC, the sixth year of the Gallic Wars, while the Gauls implemented a scorched-earth policy to try to deny Caesar&#x27;s forces supplies, the inhabitants of Avaricum convinced the council not to have their town burned. It was temporarily spared due to its good defences provided by the surrounding marshes, by a river that nearly encircled it, and by a strong southern wall. Julius Caesar&#x27;s forces, nevertheless, captured and destroyed the town, killing all but 800 of its inhabitants.

Rome reconstructed Avaricum as a Roman town, with a monumental gate, aqueducts, &quot;thermae&quot; and an amphitheatre; it reached a greater size than it would attain during the Middle Ages. The massive walls surrounding the late-Roman town, enclosing 40 hectares, were built in part with stone re-used from earlier public buildings.

The third-century AD Saint Ursinus, also known as Saint Ursin, is considered the first bishop of the town. Bourges functions as the seat of an archbishopric. During the 8th century Bourges lay on the northern fringes of the Duchy of Aquitaine and was therefore the first town to come under Frankish attacks when the Franks crossed the Loire. The Frankish Charles Martel captured the town in 731, but Duke Odo the Great of Aquitaine immediately re-took it. It remained under the rule of counts who pledged allegiance to the Aquitanian dukes up to the destructive siege by the Frankish King Pepin the Short in 762, when Basque troops are found defending the town along with its count.
During the Middle Ages, Bourges served as the capital of the Viscounty of Bourges until 1101. In the fourteenth century, it became the capital of the Duchy of Berry (established in 1360). The future king of France, Charles VII (), sought refuge there in the 1420s during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. His son, Louis XI, was born there in 1423. In 1438, Charles VII decreed the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges. During this period, Bourges was a major centre of alchemy. In 1487, a third of Bourges was destroyed by fire, after which the economic decline of the city started. 

The Gothic Cathedral of Saint Étienne, begun at the end of the twelfth century, ranks as a World Heritage Site. It is one of the earliest examples of the High Gothic style of the thirteenth century.

Bourges has a long tradition of art and history. Apart from the cathedral, other sites of importance include the 15th-century Palais Jacques Cœur and a sixty-five-hectare district of half-timbered houses and fine town-houses.

<text>In Greek mythology, Hellen (; ) is the eponymous progenitor of the Hellenes. He is the son of Deucalion (or Zeus) and Pyrrha, and the father of three sons, Dorus, Xuthus, and Aeolus, by whom he is the ancestor of the Greek peoples.

== Family ==

The &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot; (sixth century BC?) is a fragmentary poem attributed to Hesiod; the work is structured around a large genealogy of mortals, Hellen&#x27;s family being described in Book 1 of the poem. According to a scholion on Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27; &quot;Argonautica&quot;, Hellen, in the poem, is called the son of Pyrrha, by either Deucalion, or alternatively, by Prometheus (who is called the father of Deucalion in the same passage). The latter parentage, however, it seems was not a part of the &quot;Catalogue&quot;, but rather a mistake on the part of the scholion. A scholion on the &quot;Odyssey&quot; similarly calls Hellen a son of Deucalion and Pyrrha, giving his siblings as Amphictyon, Protogeneia, and Melanthea (Melantho). The scholion, however, also states that &quot;some say that Hellen was the son of Zeus by birth but was said to be the son of Deucalion&quot;, leading M. L. West to consider Hellen&#x27;s real father in the &quot;Catalogue&quot; to in fact be Zeus, and Deucalion only, in West&#x27;s words, his &quot;nominal father&quot;.

Plutarch, in his &quot;Moralia&quot;, quotes a passage from the &quot;Catalogue&quot; in which Hellen is the father of three sons, Dorus, Xuthus, and Aeolus. He does not, however, give the source of the passage; it is instead the Byzantine poet John Tzetzes who attributes it to the &quot;Catalogue&quot;. Though no mother is specified in the passage, West suggests that she was one &quot;Othryis&quot;, the nymph of Mount Othrys, based upon the mothers given by Apollodorus and a scholion on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; (see below).

A scholion on Thucydides&#x27; &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot; attributes to Hecataeus (c. 550 BC – c. 476 BC) a very different genealogy of Hellen, in which he is not the son of Deucalion but rather the grandson, being the son of one &quot;Pronous&quot;, himself the son of Deucalion, alongside &quot;Orestheus&quot; and &quot;Marathonius&quot;. According to a scholion on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; citing Hellanicus (fl. late fifth century BC), Hellen &quot;was born to Deukalion and Pyrrha, or according to some, to Zeus and Pyrrha&quot;, and was the father, by &quot;Othreis&quot;, of Dorus, Xuthus, Aeolus, and in addition a daughter, named Xenopatra.

Conon (before 444 BC – after 394 BC), in his &quot;Narrations&quot;, similarly considers Hellen to be the son of Deucalion, and the father of Dorus, Xuthus, and Aeolus, though he also notes that &quot;some&quot; say he is the son of Zeus. A scholion on Pindar, in contrast, makes Deucalion the brother of Hellen (rather than the father), and them both sons of Prometheus.

Vitruvius (c. 80–70 BC – after c. 15 BC), in his &quot;De architectura&quot;, calls Dorus the son of Hellen by the &quot;nymph Phthia&quot;, while Dionysius of Halicarnassus (c. 60 BC – after 7 BC) apparently considered Amphictyon to be Hellen&#x27;s son (usually Hellen&#x27;s brother).

Hyginus (c. 64 BC – AD 17), in his &quot;Fabulae&quot;, at one point calls Hellen the son of Zeus by Pyrrha, while later, he is listed among the sons of Poseidon, where he is called his son by Antiope (the son of Aeolus, who is usually Hellen&#x27;s descendant), and the brother of Boeotus.

According to the mythographer Apollodorus (first or second century AD), Hellen&#x27;s parents are Deucalion and Pyrrha, and his siblings Amphictyon and Protogeneia, or according to &quot;some&quot;, his parents are Zeus and Pyrrha. Apollodorus, similarly to the &quot;Catalogue&quot; and other sources, calls him the father of Dorus, Xuthus and Aeolus; however, he specifies the nymph Orseis (rather than Othreis) as their mother.

According to the Byzantine chronicler John Malalas (c. 491 – 578), Hellen was the son of &quot;Picus Zeus&quot;, and the father (rather than son) of Deucalion. According to Stephanus of Byzantium (fl. 6th century AD), the historian Archinus had Hellen as the father of one &quot;Neonus&quot;, father of &quot;Dotus&quot;, the latter of which gave his name to Dotium in Thessaly.

== Progenitor and eponym of the Hellenes ==

Hellen was Thessalian. Homer, in the part of the &quot;Iliad&quot; known as the Catalogue of Ships, mentions the Hellenes () as a small tribe in Thessalic Phthia, among those commanded by Achilles. Similarly, according to a scholion on Apollonius of Rhodes, Hecataeus and &quot;Hesiod&quot; considered Deucalion&#x27;s descendants to be Thessalian. According to Thucydides, Achaea Phthiotis, as the birthplace of Hellen, was the home of the Hellenes; he says that before Hellen the name &quot;Hellas&quot; () didn&#x27;t exist, but rather there were various tribes which went under different names, particularly &quot;Pelasgian&quot;. It was only when Hellen and his sons &quot;grew strong in Phthiotis&quot; that they allied with various cities in war and these cities, one by one, through their association with Hellen and his sons, came to be called &quot;Hellenes&quot;, though it was a long time before the name came to be applied to all.

== &quot;Melanippe Wise&quot; ==

Though primarily genealogical in importance, Hellen does feature briefly in Euripides&#x27; lost play &quot;Melanippe Wise&quot; (c. 420 BC). In the play, Melanippe, the daughter of Aeolus (and thus the granddaughter of Hellen), becomes by Poseidon the mother of twins, Aeolus and Boeotus. They are placed in a cowshed, leading Aeolus to think they are the &quot;unnatural offspring of a cow&quot;, and Hellen convinces Aeolus to burn the twins. This story is depicted on an Apulian volute krater dating to the late 4th century BC, in which a shepherd shows the twins to Hellen, in the presence of Melanippe, Aeolus, and Aeolus&#x27; son Cretheus.

<text>In Greek mythology, Xuthus (; &quot;Xouthos&quot;) was a Phthian prince who later became a king of Peloponnesus. He was the founder (through his sons) of the Achaean and Ionian nations.

== Etymology ==
According to the author Robert Graves, Xuthus&#x27; name came from the ancient Greek word , meaning &quot;sparrow&quot;.

== Family ==
Xuthus was a son of King Hellen of Thessaly and the nymph Orseis; and brother of Dorus, Aeolus, Xenopatra and probably Neonus. He had two sons, Ion and Achaeus, and a daughter named Diomede by Creusa, the Athenian daughter of King Erechtheus. Euripides&#x27;s play, &quot;Ion&quot;, provided an unusual alternate version, according to which Xuthus was the son of Aeolus and Ion was in fact been begotten on Xuthus&#x27;s wife Creusa by Apollo. Xuthus and Creusa visited the Oracle at Delphi to ask the god if they could hope for a child, at which point they are told they already have a child, Ion, who was father by Apollo and mothered by Creusa, though Creusa had forgotten her son due to the trauma of being raped by Apollo. The Oracle at Delphi tells the couple that Ion is Xuthus&#x27; son and that Creusa&#x27;s family should adopt him as Athenian. This makes Creusa so angry she tries to murder her stepson, but she fails. It is at this point the Creusa finds the crib that young Ion slept in and realizes she is his mother. Despite Ion being adopted, Xuthus is proud to be a father and introduces Ion as his legitimate son to Athens. Variation&#x27;s of Xuthus paternity regarding Ion are that he is the true father, that he has been tricked by Apollo and Creusa, or that he has deluded himself into believing he is the father, but the most common version is that told above with the Oracle of Delphi. Xuthus will later father Dorus and Achaeus with Creusa, though Dorus is normally presented as Xuthus&#x27;s brother.

== Mythology ==
According to the Hesiodic &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot; on the origin of the Greeks, Hellen&#x27;s three sons Dorus, Xuthus (with his sons Ion and Achaeus) and Aeolus, comprised the set of progenitors of the major ancient tribes that formed the Greek nation.

<doc id="82137" wikidata="Q192107" url="?curid=82137" title="Hemera">
<text>In Greek mythology, Hemera (; ) was the personification of day. According to Hesiod, she was the daughter of Erebus (Darkness) and Nyx (Night), and the sister of Aether. Though separate entities in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Hemera and Eos (Dawn) were often identified with each other.

== Genealogy ==
In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Hemera and her brother Aether were the offspring of Erebus and Nyx. Bacchylides apparently had Hemera as the daughter of Chronus (Time) and Nyx. In the lost epic poem the &quot;Titanomachy&quot; (late seventh century BC?), Hemera was perhaps the mother, by Aether, of Uranus (Sky). In some rare versions, Hemera was instead the daughter of Helios (the Sun) by an unknown mother.

== Mythology ==
According to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Hemera left Tartarus just as Nyx (Night) entered it; when Hemera returned, Nyx left:

== Roman counterpart Dies ==
Hemera&#x27;s Roman counterpart Dies (Day) had a different genealogy. According to the Roman mythographer Hyginus, Chaos and Caligio (Mist) were the parents of Nox (Night), Dies, Erebus, and Aether. Cicero says that Aether and Dies were the parents of Caelus (Sky). While, Hyginus says that, in addition to Caelus, Aether and Dies were also the parents of Terra (Earth), and Mare (Sea). Cicero also says that Dies and Caelus were the parents of Mercury, the Roman counterpart of Hermes.

== Identified with Eos ==
Although Eos (Dawn) is a separate entity in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;—where she is the daughter of the Titans Theia and Hyperion, the mother of Memnon, and the lover of Cephalus—elsewhere Eos and Hemera are identified. For example, the geographer Pausanias describes seeing depictions, on the &quot;Royal Portico&quot; at Athens and on the throne of Apollo at Amyclae, of Cephalus being carried off by a goddess whom he identifies as Hemera. He also describes a stone pedestal at Olympia which depicted Hemera pleading with Zeus for the life of her son Memnon. Similarly, although, in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Eos is said to be the abductor of Orion, a scholiast on that passage says that, according to Euphorion, Hemera fell in love with Orion and carried him away.

== Worship ==
While there is little evidence of Hemera having received a cult in ancient times, archaeological evidence has proven the existence of a small shrine to Hemera and Helios, the god of the sun, on the island of Kos.

<doc id="82138" wikidata="Q11746" url="?curid=82138" title="Wuhan">
<text>Wuhan is the capital of Hubei, China. With a population of over eleven million, it is the most populous city in Hubei and the eighth-most-populous city in China. It is also one of the nine national central cities and the second most livable city in China.

Wuhan historically served as a busy city port for commerce and trading with some crucial influences on Chinese history. The name &quot;Wuhan&quot; came from the city&#x27;s historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the &quot;Three Towns of Wuhan&quot; (). Wuhan lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze river and its largest tributary, the Han River, and is known as &quot;Nine Provinces&#x27; Thoroughfare&quot; (). Wuhan was the site of the 1911 Wuchang Uprising against the Qing dynasty which ended 2,000 years of dynastic rule. Wuhan was briefly a capital of China twice, in 1927 under a left wing Kuomintang (KMT) government, and in 1937 as a provisional wartime capital during World War II. In 1938, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the city was the site of the Battle of Wuhan. On December 31, 2019, SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus that later caused the COVID-19 pandemic, was first discovered in Wuhan and the city was the location of the first lockdown of the pandemic in January 2020.

Wuhan is considered the political, economic, financial, commercial, cultural, and educational center of Central China. It is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads, and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities. Because of its key role in domestic transportation, Wuhan is sometimes referred to as &quot;the Chicago of China&quot; by foreign sources. The &quot;Golden Waterway&quot; of the Yangtze River and the Han River traverse the urban area and divide Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the city. The Three Gorges Dam, the world&#x27;s largest power station in terms of installed capacity, is located nearby. Historically, Wuhan has suffered risks of flooding, prompting the government to alleviate the situation by introducing ecologically friendly absorption mechanisms.

While Wuhan has been a traditional manufacturing hub for decades, it is also one of the areas promoting modern industrial changes in China. Wuhan has three national development zones, four scientific and technological development parks, over 350 research institutes, 1,656 high tech enterprises, numerous enterprise incubators and investments from 230 Fortune Global 500 firms. It produced GDP (nominal) of US$274 billion in 2021. The Dongfeng Motor Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, is headquartered in Wuhan. The city is home to multiple notable institutes of higher education, including Wuhan University and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Wuhan is a major city in the world by scientific research outputs and it ranks 9th globally and 5th in the Asia-Pacific &amp; China (after Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing and Guangzhou). In 2017, Wuhan was designated as a Creative City by UNESCO, in the field of design. Wuhan is classified as a Beta- (global second tier) city together with seven other cities in China, including Changsha, Dalian, Jinan, Shenyang, Xiamen, Xi&#x27;an and Zhengzhou by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Wuhan is also one of the world&#x27;s top 100 financial centers, according to the Global Financial Centres Index.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Wuhan&quot; comes from the two major cities on the banks of the Yangtze River that make up the Wuhan metropolis: &quot;Wu&quot; refers to the city of Wuchang (), which lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze, while &quot;Han&quot; refers to the city of Hankou (), which lies on the northern bank of the Yangtze. &quot;Hankou&quot; means &quot;Mouth of the Han&quot;, from its position at the confluence of the Han with the Yangtze River.

In 1926, the Northern Expedition reached the Wuhan area and it was decided to merge Hankou, Wuchang and Hanyang into one city in order to make a new capital for Nationalist China. On January 1, 1927, the resulting city was proclaimed as &quot; (the traditional Chinese characters for &#x27;Wuhan&#x27;), which was later simplified as &quot; (also &#x27;Wuhan&#x27;).

==History==

===Antiquity era ===
The Wuhan area has been settled for 3,500 years. Panlongcheng, an archaeological site primarily associated with the Erligang culture ( BC) (being sparsely populated during the earlier Erlitou period), is located in modern-day Huangpi District of Wuhan.

During the Western Zhou the State of E, which gives its name to the single character abbreviation for Hubei province, controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state in 863 BC, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the State of Chu for the rest of the Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou periods. After the State of Huang was conquered by State of Chu in the summer of 648 BC, the people of Huang were moved into the area in and around present-day Wuhan. Local geographical terms including the name of Wuhan&#x27;s Huangpi District were named after the State of Huang. Chu was in turn conquered by Qin in 223 BC.

===Imperial China===

During the Han dynasty, Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The Battle of Xiakou in AD 203 and Battle of Jiangxia five years later were fought in the region over control of Jiangxia Commandery, territories of which included much of present-day eastern Hubei. In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in Chinese history and a central event in the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;—the Battle of Red Cliffs—took place near the Yangtze River, with the cliffs near Wuhan identified as one of the potential locations. Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the Yellow Crane Tower, one of the Four Great Towers of China, was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of Sun Quan, leader of the Eastern Wu. The tower became a sacred site of Taoism.

Due to tensions between the Eastern Wu and Cao Wei kingdoms, in the autumn of 228, Cao Rui, grandson of Cao Cao and the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei, ordered the general Man Chong to lead troops to Xiakou (; in present-day Wuhan). In 279, Wang Jun and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as Xiling (in present-day Yichang, Hubei), Xiakou (; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang (; present-day Ezhou, Hubei).

During the Northern and Southern dynasties period, the Wuhan area was part of the successive Southern dynasty states Liu Song (420–479), Southern Qi (479–502), Liang, and Western Liang.

In fall 550, Hou Jing sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan&#x27;s son Xiao Si (). Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control. Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia (, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi&#x27;s ire—believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne—and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan. In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned Wu Mingche as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang (). The opposing sides met at Zhuankou (, in modern Wuhan).

The city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies. Cui Hao, a celebrated poet of the Tang dynasty, visited the Yellow Crane Tower in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.

In spring 877, Wang Xianzhi captured E Prefecture (, in modern Wuhan). He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture (, in modern Shangqiu, Henan). In winter 877, Huang Chao pillaged Qi and Huang (, in modern Wuhan) Prefectures.

Before Kublai Khan arrived in 1259, word reached him that Möngke had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on the Wuhan area, near the Yangtze. The present-day Wuying Pagoda was constructed at the end of the Song dynasty between attacks by the Mongolian forces. Under the Mongol rulers (Yuan dynasty) (after 1301), the Wuchang prefecture, headquartered in the town, became the capital of Hubei province. Hankou, from the Ming to late Qing, was under the administration of the local government in Hanyang, although it was already one of the four major national markets () of the Ming dynasty.

Hanyang&#x27;s Guiyuan Temple was completed in the 15th year of Shunzhi (1658).

By the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China&#x27;s top four trading centers. In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north–south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important transshipment point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a concession in Hankou. During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Wuhan area was controlled for many years by rebel forces and the Yellow Crane Tower, Xingfu Temple, Zhuodaoquan Temple and other buildings were repurposed or damaged. During the Second Opium War (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856–1860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the Treaties of Tianjin and the Convention of Peking, which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.

In the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Smith Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of along the Yangtze River (from latter-day Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession.

In 1862, Russian tea merchants arrived in the treaty port of Hankou. Russians in Hankou established four factories using assembly lines and machinery to produce brick tea, and became the city&#x27;s richest industrialists in what would become the Russian concession. Japanese immigrants, mainly traders, also started arriving in 1874.

In 1889, Zhang Zhidong was transferred from Viceroy of Liangguang (Guangdong and Guangxi provinces) to Viceroy of Huguang (Hunan and Hubei provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of &quot;Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,&quot; known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, Daye Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China&#x27;s modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a &quot;zhen&quot; and a &quot;xie&quot; (both &quot;zhen&quot; and &quot;xie&quot; are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.

Originally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the Hanyang Arsenal was founded in 1891, with funds diverted from the Nanyang Fleet in Guangdong to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years. On April 23, 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some , could start production of small-caliber cannons. It built magazine-fed rifles, Gruson quick fire guns, and cartridges.

In 1896, the Russian Empire also acquired a concession in Hankou.

===Wuchang Uprising===

By 1900, according to Collier&#x27;s magazine, Hankou, the Yangtze River boom town, was &quot;the St. Louis and Chicago of China.&quot; On October 10, 1911, Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s followers launched the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the collapse of the Qing state and 2,000 years of dynastic rule, as well as the establishment of the Republic of China.

The Wuchang Uprising of October 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty, originated in Wuhan. Before the uprising, anti-Qing secret societies were active in Wuhan. In September 1911, the outbreak of the protests in Sichuan forced the Qing authorities to send part of the New Army garrisoned in Wuhan to suppress the rebellion. On September 14 the Literary Society () and the Progressive Association (), two local revolutionary organizations in Hubei, set up joint headquarters in Wuchang and planned for an uprising. On the morning of October 9, a bomb at the office of the political arrangement exploded prematurely and alerted local authorities. The proclamation for the uprising, beadroll and the revolutionaries’ official seal fell into the hands of Rui Cheng, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei, who demolished the uprising headquarters the same day and set out to arrest the revolutionaries listed in the beadroll. This forced the revolutionaries to launch the uprising earlier than planned.

On the night of October 10, the revolutionaries fired shots to signal the uprising at the engineering barracks of Hubei New Army. They then led the New Army of all barracks to join the revolution. Under the guidance of Wu Zhaolin, Cai Jimin and others, this revolutionary army seized the official residence of the governor and government offices. Rui Cheng fled in panic into the Chuyu ship. Zhang Biao, the commander of the Qing army, also fled the city. On the morning of the 11th, the revolutionary army took the whole city of Wuchang, but leaders such as Jiang Yiwu and Sun Wu disappeared. Thus the leaderless revolutionary army recommended Li Yuanhong, the assistant governor of the Qing army, as the commander-in-chief. Li founded the Hubei Military Government, proclaimed the abolition of the Qing rule in Hubei, the founding of the Republic of China and published an open telegram calling for other provinces to join the revolution.

As the revolution spread to other parts of the country, the Qing government concentrated loyalist military forces to suppress the uprising in Wuhan. From October 17 to December 1, the revolutionary army and local volunteers defended the city in the Battle of Yangxia against better armed and more numerous Qing forces commanded by Yuan Shikai. Huang Xing would arrive in Wuhan in early November to take command of the revolutionary army. After fierce fighting and heavy casualties, Qing forces seized Hankou and Hanyang. But Yuan agreed to halt the advance on Wuchang and participated in peace talks, which would eventually lead to the return of Sun Yat-sen from exile, founding of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912. Through the Wuchang Uprising, Wuhan is known as the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution, named after the Xinhai year on the Chinese calendar. The city has several museums and memorials to the revolution and the thousands of martyrs who died defending the revolution.

===Republic of China===

With the northern extension of the Northern Expedition, the center of the Great Revolution shifted from the Pearl River basin to the Yangtze River basin. On November 26, the Kuomintang Central Political Committee decided to move the capital from Guangzhou to Wuhan. In mid-December, most of the KMT central executive commissioners and national government commissioners arrived in Wuhan, set up the temporary joint conference of central executive commissioners and National Government commissioners, performed the top functions of central party headquarters and National Government, declared they would work in Wuhan on January 1, 1927, and decided to combine the towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang into Wuhan City, called &quot;Capital District&quot;. The new national government, later known as &quot;Wuhan nationalist government&quot;, was based in the Nanyang Building in Hankou, while the central party headquarters and other organizations chose their locations in Hankou or Wuchang.

In March 1927, Mao Zedong appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing Wang Jingwei leader. The first phase of the Northern Expedition was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the Nanjing faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan. Members of the Chinese Communist Party, who had survived the April 12 massacre, met at Wuhan and reelected Chen Duxiu (Ch&#x27;en Tu-hsiu) as the Party&#x27;s Secretary General. The split was partially motivated by the purge of the Communists within the party, which marked the end of the First United Front, and Chiang Kai-shek briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.

In June 1927, Stalin sent a telegram to the Communists in Wuhan, calling for the mobilization of an army of workers and peasants. This alarmed Wang Jingwei, who decided to break with the Communists and come to terms with Chiang Kai-shek. The Wuhan coup was a political shift made on July 15, 1927, by Wang Jingwei towards Chiang Kai-shek, and his Shanghai-based rival in the Kuomintang. The Wuhan Nationalist Government was established in Wuhan on February 21, 1927, and ended by August 19, 1927. After the end of the Northern Expedition, Hankou was elevated to a centrally-controlled municipality.

In the 1931 China floods, one of the deadliest flood disasters in world history, Wuhan was a refuge for flood victims from outlying areas, who had been arriving since the late spring. But when the city itself was inundated in the early summer, and after a catastrophic dike failure just before 6:00 AM on July 27, an estimated 782,189 urban citizens and rural refugees were left homeless. The flood covered an area of 32 square miles and the city was flooded under many feet of water for close to three months. Large numbers gathered on flood islands throughout the city, with 30,000 sheltering on a railway embankment in central Hankou. With little food and a complete breakdown in sanitation, thousands soon began to succumb to diseases. Jin Shilong, Senior Engineer at the Hubei Flood Prevention Agency, described the flooding:There was no warning, only a sudden great wall of water. Most of Wuhan&#x27;s buildings in those days were only one story high, and for many people there was no escape – they died by the tens of thousands. ... I was just coming off duty at the company&#x27;s main office, a fairly new three-story building near the center of town ... When I heard the terrible noise and saw the wall of water coming, I raced to the top story of the building. ... I was in one of the tallest and strongest buildings left standing. At that time no one knew whether the water would subside or rise even higher.The high-water mark was reached on August 19 at Hankou, with the water level exceeding above normal. In 1936, when natural disaster struck Central China with widespread flooding affecting Hebei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Wuhan and Chongqing caused by the Yangtze and Huai Rivers bursting their banks, Ong Seok Kim, as Chairman of the Sitiawan Fundraising and Disaster Relief Committee, raised money and materials in support of the victims.
During the Second Sino-Japanese War and following the fall of Nanking in December 1937, Wuhan had become the provisional capital of China&#x27;s Kuomintang government, and became another focal point of pitched air battles beginning in early 1938 between modern monoplane bomber and fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese forces and the Chinese Air Force, which included support from the Soviet Volunteer Group in both planes and personnel, as U.S. support in war materials waned. As the battle raged on through 1938, Wuhan and the surrounding region had become the site of the Battle of Wuhan. After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.

In early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT gunboat &quot;Zhongshan&quot; came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the &quot;Zhongshan&quot; sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the &quot;Zhongshan&quot; has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan&#x27;s suburban Jiangxia District, which opened on September 26, 2011.

As a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China. On December 18, 1944, in a planned strategic move, and as revenge for the torture and execution of three captured American pilots by Japanese soldiers in the city, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers with the approval of Chiang Kai-Shek. This set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the military resources of the city. For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city. The air raids also killed thousands of Chinese civilians. &quot;According to casualty statistics compiled by Hankou city in 1946, more than 20,000 were killed or injured in the December bombings of 1944.&quot;

Wuhan returned to Chinese control in September 1945. Administratively, Wuchang and Hanyang were initially combined into a new City of Wuchang, but in October 1946 were separated into the City of Wuchang (including Wuchang only) and the County of Hanyang. Hankou became a centrally controlled municipality in August 1947. Militarily, the Wuhan Forward Headquarters was established in Wuhan, headed by Bai Chongxi.
During the later stages of the Chinese Civil War, Bai sought to broker peace, proposing that the Communist Party could rule northern China while the Nationalist government retained southern China. This was rejected, and on May 15, 1949, Bai and the Wuhan garrison retreated from the city. People&#x27;s Liberation Army troops entered Wuhan on the afternoon of Monday, May 16, 1949.

===People&#x27;s Republic===

The Communists redeveloped industry in Wuhan, which had damaged by war. During the PRC&#x27;s first decade, it became an important center of industry again. Hundreds of factories were built in the city, including most prominently Wuhan Iron and Steel, which opened in 1958.

The Changjiang Water Resources Commission was reestablished in February 1950 with its headquarters in Wuhan. From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.

Before construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Hunslet Engine Company built two extra heavy 0-8-0 locomotives for loading the train ferries for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.

The project of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the Beijing–Hankou railway with the Guangdong–Hankou railway into the Beijing–Guangzhou railway, making Wuhan a &#x27;thoroughfare to nine provinces&#x27; () in name and in fact.

After Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.

As the Third Front campaign shifted the focus of industrial development to China&#x27;s hinterlands, Wuhan&#x27;s development slowed.

In July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the Wuhan Incident (&quot;July 20th Incident&quot;), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the Cultural Revolution. Economic development was further disrupted by the Cultural Revolution.

In 1981, the Wuhan City Government commenced reconstruction of the Yellow Crane Tower at a new location, about from the original site, and it was completed in 1985. In 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was built with one trestle of the bridge on the site of the tower, which had been last destroyed in 1884.

During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, students in Wuhan blocked the Yangtze River Railway bridge and another 4,000 gathered at the railway station. About one thousand students staged a railroad &#x27;sit-in&#x27;. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike. The situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a bank run and resorted to panic-buying.

Wuhan was the first stop on Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s 1992 southern tour.

In the wake of the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on May 7, 1999, protests broke out throughout China, including in Wuhan.

On June 22, 2000, a Wuhan Airlines flight from Enshi to Wuhan was forced to circle for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms. The aircraft eventually crashed on the banks of Han River in Hanyang District, all on-board perished (there were varying accounts of number of crews and passengers). In addition, the crash also killed 7 people on the ground.

Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao. On May 19, 2011, Fang Binxing, the Principal of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (also known as &quot;Father of China&#x27;s Great Fire Wall&quot;) was hit on the chest by a shoe thrown at him by a Huazhong University of Science and Technology student who calls herself &quot;hanjunyi&quot; (, or ) while Fang was giving a lecture at Wuhan University.

The city has been subject to devastating floods, which are now supposed to be controlled by the ambitious Three Gorges Dam, a project which was completed in 2008. The 2008 Chinese winter storms damaged water supply equipment in Wuhan: up to 100,000 people were out of running water when several water pipes burst, cutting the supply to local households. The 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave hit Wuhan on July 3.
In the 2010 China floods, the Han River at Wuhan experienced its worst flooding in twenty years, as officials continued sandbagging efforts along the Han and Yangtze Rivers in the city and checked reservoirs. In the 2011 China floods, Wuhan was flooded, with parts of the city losing power. In the 2016 China floods, Wuhan saw of rainfall during the first week of July, surpassing the record that fell on the city in 1991. A red alert for heavy rainfall was issued on July 2, the same day that eight people died after a section of a tall wall collapsed on top of them. The city&#x27;s subway system, the Wuhan Metro was partially submerged as was the main railway station. At least 14 city residents were killed, one was missing, and more than 80,000 were relocated.

The 2019 Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan in October.

In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, was first discovered in Wuhan, and the city was the location of the first lockdown of the pandemic in January 2020. Wuhan and other Hubei cities were placed under lockdown for nearly three months to contain the disease. On April 8, 2020, the Wuhan lockdown officially came to an end after no new domestic cases were reported in Hubei province. The virus is believed to have been a mutation of a virus that existed in bats, and first spread to humans at a wet market in Wuhan. Although no bats were sold at the market, some 38 other species of animals were offered, one of which could have served as an intermediary species. In December 2024, a congressional committee, chaired by Rep. Brad Wenstrup, completed a two-year investigation and released a final report concluding that the Covid-19 likely leaked from a virology laboratory in Wuhan.

==Geography==
===Overview===

Wuhan is in east-central Hubei, at latitude 29° 58&#x27;–31° 22&#x27; N and longitude 113° 41&#x27;–115° 05&#x27; E. Wuhan sits at the confluence of the Han River flowing into the Yangtze River at the East of the Jianghan Plain along the Yangtze&#x27;s middle reaches.

The metropolitan area comprises three parts—Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang—commonly called the &quot;Three Towns of Wuhan&quot; (hence the name &quot;Wuhan&quot;, combining &quot;Wu&quot; from the first city and &quot;Han&quot; from the other two). The consolidation of these cities occurred in 1927 and Wuhan was thereby established. The three former cities face each other across the rivers and are linked by bridges, including one of the first modern bridges in China, known as the &quot;First Bridge&quot;.
* Wuchang lies south east of the Yangtze River that separates it from both Hankou and Hanyang.
* Hankou sits north of the Yangtze River separating it from Wuchang. Hankou is north of the Han River separating it from Hanyang.
* Hanyang lies west of the Yangtze separating it from Wuchang. Hanyang is south of the Han river separating it from Hankou.
It is simple in terrain—low and flat in the middle and hilly in the south, with the Yangtze and Han rivers winding through the city. The She River enters the Yangtze in Huangpi District. Wuhan occupies a land area of , most of which is alluvial plain and decorated with hills and a great number of lakes and ponds. Water makes up one quarter of Wuhan&#x27;s urban territory, which is the highest percentage among major cities in China. Wuhan has nearly 200 lakes, including the East Lake of 33 km2, and Tangxun Lake, which are the largest lakes entirely within a city in China.

Other well-known lakes include South Lake and Sand Lake. Liangzi Lake, the largest lake by surface area in Hubei province, is located in the southeast of Jiangxia District.The twin peaks at the junction of Huangpi District and Xiaogan City, with an altitude of 872.5 meters, are the highest points in Wuhan. There are also several mountains within the city limits of Wuhan including Mount Luojia () in Wuchang District as well as Mount Hong () and Mount Yujia () in Hongshan District.

===Climate===
Wuhan&#x27;s climate is humid subtropical (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) with abundant rainfall in summer and four distinctive seasons. Wuhan is known for its humid summers, when dewpoints can often reach or more. Historically, along with Chongqing and Nanjing, Wuhan is referred to as one of the &quot;Three Furnacelike Cities&quot; along the Yangtze River for their hot summers. However, the climate data of recent years suggests that Wuhan is no longer among the top tier of &quot;The hottest cities in summer&quot; list, the New Four Furnacelike Cities are Chongqing, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanchang. Spring and autumn are generally mild, while winter is cool with quite low rainfall and occasional snow. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July. Annual precipitation totals just under , the majority of which falls from April to July; the annual mean temperature is , the frost-free period lasts 211 to 272 days. With monthly possible sunshine percentage ranging from 30 percent in January to 53 percent in August, the city proper receives 1,783 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extreme low and high temperatures recorded are on January 31, 1977, and on July 27, 2017 / on August 18, 2022 (unofficial record of on August 10, 1934).
==Government and politics==

Wuhan is a sub-provincial city. Municipal government is regulated by the local Chinese Communist Party (CCP), led by the Wuhan CCP Secretary (), Wang Zhonglin (). The local CCP issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People&#x27;s Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.

Government officials include the Mayor of Wuhan (), Cheng Yongwen (), and vice-mayors. Numerous bureaus focus on law, public security, and other affairs. Zhou Xianwang () was mayor from 2018 to 2021.

===Administrative divisions===

The sub-provincial city of Wuhan currently comprises 13 districts. As of the Sixth Census of China in 2010, the 13 districts comprised 160 township-level divisions including 156 subdistricts, 3 towns, 1 townships.

===Diplomatic missions===

There are four countries that have consulates in Wuhan:

The current U.S. Consul General, Jamie Fouss, was posted to Wuhan in August 2017. The office of the U.S. Consulate General, Central China (located in Wuhan) celebrated its official opening on November 20, 2008, and is the first new American consulate in China in over 20 years.

In 2015, Japan
and Russia announced their intentions to establish consular offices in Wuhan.

==Economy==
Up until the 21st century, Wuhan was largely an agricultural region. Since 2004 it has been a focal point of the Rise of Central China Plan, which aims to build less-developed inland economies into hubs of advanced manufacturing.

Since 1890, the steel industry has been the backbone of Wuhan&#x27;s industry. In 2010, automobile industry exceeded GDP for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) steel for the first time. There are 5 car manufacturers, including Dongfeng Honda, Citroën, SAIC-GM, DFM Passenger Vehicle and Dongfeng Renault. Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Co., Ltd is headquartered in the city.

As of 2016, Wuhan has attracted foreign investment from over 80 countries, with 5,973 foreign-invested enterprises established in the city with a total capital injection of $22.45 billion USD. Among these, about 50 French companies including Renault and PSA Group have operations in the city, representing over one third of French investment in China, and the highest level of French investment in any Chinese city.

Wuhan is an important center for economy, trade, finance, transportation, information technology, and education in China. Its major industries include optic-electronic, automobile manufacturing, iron and steel manufacturing, new pharmaceutical sector, biology engineering, new materials industry and environmental protection. Environmental sustainability is highlighted in Wuhan&#x27;s list of emerging industries, which include energy efficiency technology and renewable energy.

As of 2021, Wuhan is ranked among the world&#x27;s top 100 financial centers, according to the Global Financial Centres Index.
===Industrial zones===
Major industrial zones in Wuhan include in chronological order:

* Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone
Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone is a national level industrial zone incorporated in 1993. Its current zone size is about 10–25 square km and it plans to expand to 25–50 square km. Industries encouraged in Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone include Auto-mobile Production/Assembly, Biotechnology/Pharmaceuticals, Chemicals Production and Processing, Food/Beverage Processing, Heavy Industry, and Telecommunications Equipment.

Wuhan Optics Valley Software Park is jointly developed by East Lake High-Tech Development Zone and Dalian Software Park Co., Ltd. The planned area is with total floor area of . The zone is away from the 316 National Highway and is away from the Wuhan Tianhe Airport.
* Wuhan Biolake
Biolake is an industrial base established in 2008 in the Optics Valley of China. Located in East Lake New Technology Development Zone of Wuhan, Biolake covers , and has six parks including Bio-innovation Park, Bio-pharma Park, Bio-agriculture Park, Bio-manufacturing Park, Medical Device Park and Medical Health Park, to accommodate both research activities and living.

==Demographics==
Wuhan is the most populous city in Central China and among the most populous in China. In the Seventh Census of China in 2020, Wuhan was home to 12,326,500 inhabitants, a 25.97% increase by 2.5411 million compared to the last census in 2010. 2010-2020 is the fastest growing 10 years in history since the census was established, averaging 2.34% annually, and it was the first time that Wuhan&#x27;s population reached 10 million.

The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, , a population of 19 million.
As of November 2019, urban development status considering both spatial and socioeconomic processes has been examined using Night Time Lighting data and land cover data as proxies; it showed Wuhan&#x27;s high concentration
of socioeconomic activities compared to its urban spatial development.

===Religion===

According to a survey published in 2017, 79.2% of the population of Wuhan are either irreligious or practice worship of gods and ancestors; among these 0.9% are Taoists. Among other religious doctrines, 14.7% of the population adheres to Buddhism, 2.9% to Protestantism, 0.3% to Catholicism and 1.6% to Islam, and 1.6% of the population adheres to unspecified other religions.


== Transportation ==
=== Railways ===
China Railway Wuhan Group manages the Wuhan Railway Hub. Wuhan Railway Hub is considered one of the four key railway hubs of China. The city of Wuhan is served by three major railway stations: the Hankou railway station in Hankou, the Wuchang railway station in Wuchang, and the Wuhan railway station, located in a newly developed area east of the East Lake (Hongshan District). As the stations are many miles apart, it is important for passengers to be aware of the particular station(s) used by a particular train.

The (original) Hankou Station was the terminus for the Jinghan railway from Beijing, while the Wuchang Station was the terminus for the Yuehan railway to Guangzhou. Since the construction of the First Yangtze Bridge and the linking of the two lines into the Jingguang railway, both Hankou and Wuchang stations have been served by trains going to all directions, which contrasts with the situation in such cities as New York or Moscow, where different stations serve different directions.

With the opening of the Hefei-Wuhan high-speed railway on April 1, 2009, Wuhan became served by high-speed trains with Hefei, Nanjing, and Shanghai; several trains a day now connect the city with Shanghai, getting there in under six hours. As of early 2010, most of these express trains leave from the Hankou railway station.

In 2006, construction began on the new Wuhan railway station with 11 platforms, located on the northeastern outskirts of the city. In December 2009, the station was opened, as China unveiled its second high-speed train with scheduled runs from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Billed as the fastest train in the world, it can reach a speed of . The travel time between the two cities has been reduced from ten and a half hours to just three. The rail service has been extended north to Beijing.

, the new Wuhan railway station is primarily used by the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed trains, while most regular trains to other destinations continue to use the Hankou and Wuchang stations.

In 2012 the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle programs in China are the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. China has seen a rise in private &quot;dockless&quot; bike shares with fleets that dwarf systems in size outside China. Initially, a number of traditional (third-generation) docked public bike systems operated by local municipal governments opened across China, with the largest ones being in Wuhan and Hangzhou. The first was introduced in Beijing in 2007. However, third-generation bike sharing is not considered successful for the majority cities in China. Bike sharing in Beijing virtually stopped and it also has encountered difficulties in Shanghai and Wuhan.

&quot;No need to be particular about the recipes; all foods have their own uses. Rice wine and tangyuan are excellent midnight snacks, while fat bream and flowering Chinese cabbages are great delicacies.&quot; This attitude expressed in &quot;Hankou Zhuzhici&quot; reflects indirectly the eating habits and a wide variety of distinctive snacks with a long history in Wuhan, such as Qingshuizong (a pyramid-shaped dumpling made of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves) in the Period of the Warring States, Chunbinbian in Northern and Southern dynasties, mung bean jelly in the Sui dynasty, youguo (a deep-fried twisted dough stick) in the Song and Yuan dynasties, rice wine and mianwo in the Ming and Qing dynasties, as well as three-delicacy stuffed skin of bean milk, tangbao (steamed dumpling filled with minced meat and gravy) and hot braised noodles (reganmian) in modern times.

* Soup dumpling or &quot;xiaolongtangbao&quot; () is a kind of dumpling with thin skin made of flour, steamed with very juicy meat inside, hence the name: &quot;tang&quot; (soup) &quot;bao&quot; (bun) – every time one takes a bite from it the &quot;soup&quot; inside is liable to spill out.
* A salty doughnut or &quot;mianwo&quot; () is a kind of savory donut with a salty taste. It is much thinner than a common donut and is a typical Wuhan local food.

===Bridges===

Wuhan has eleven bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called the First Bridge, was built over the Yangtze in 1957, carrying a railroad directly across the river between hills known as Snake Hill and Turtle Hill. Before this bridge was built it could take up to an entire day to barge railcars across. Including its approaches, it is long, and it accommodates both a double-track railway on a lower deck and a four-lane roadway above. It was built with the assistance of advisers from the Soviet Union.

The Second Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge built of prestressed concrete, has a central span of ; it is in length (including of the main bridge) and in width. Its main bridgeheads are high each, pulling 392 thick slanting cables together in the shape of double fans so that the central span of the bridge is well poised on the piers and the bridge&#x27;s stability and vibration resistance are ensured. With six lanes on the deck, the bridge is designed to handle the daily passage of 50,000 motor vehicles. The bridge was completed in 1995.

The Third Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called Baishazhou Bridge, was completed in September 2000. Located southwest of the First Bridge, construction of Baishazhou Bridge started in 1997. With an investment of over 1.4 billion yuan (about ), the bridge, which is long and wide, has six lanes and has a capacity of 50,000 vehicles a day. The bridge is expected to serve as a major passage for the future Wuhan Ring Road, greatly easing the city&#x27;s traffic and aiding local economic development.

The Yangluo Bridge carries Wuhan&#x27;s Ring Road across the Yangtze in the city&#x27;s eastern suburbs (connecting the Hongshan District with the Xinzhou District). It was opened on December 26, 2007.

The Wuhan Tianxingzhou Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the northeastern part of the city, downstream of the Second bridge. It is named after Tianxing Island (&quot;Tianxingzhou&quot;), above which it crosses the river. Built at a cost of 11 billion yuan, the 4,657-meter cable suspension bridge was opened on December 26, 2009, in time for the opening of the Wuhan railway station. It is a combined road and rail bridge, and carries the Wuhan–Guangzhou high-speed railway across the river.

<text>In Greek mythology, Nyx ( ; , , &quot;Night&quot;) is the goddess and personification of the night. In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, she is the offspring of Chaos, and the mother of Aether and Hemera (Day) by Erebus (Darkness). By herself, she produces a brood of children which are mainly personifications of primarily negative forces. She features in a number of early cosmogonies, which place her as one of the first deities to exist. In the works of poets and playwrights, she lives at the ends of the Earth, and is often described as a black-robed goddess who drives through the sky in a chariot pulled by horses. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Homer relates that even Zeus fears to displease her.

Night is a prominent figure in several theogonies of Orphic literature, in which she is often described as the mother of Uranus and Gaia. In the earliest Orphic cosmogonies, she is the first deity to exist, while in the later Orphic Rhapsodies, she is the daughter and consort of Phanes, and the second ruler of the gods. She delivers prophecies to Zeus from an adyton, and is described as the nurse of the gods. In the Rhapsodies, there may have been three separate figures named Night.

In ancient Greek art, Nyx often appears alongside other celestial deities such as Selene, Helios and Eos, as a winged figure driving a horse-pulled chariot. Though of little cultic importance, she was also associated with several oracles. The Romans referred to her as Nox, whose name also means &quot;Night&quot;.

== Genealogy ==
According to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Nyx is the offspring of Chaos, alongside Erebus (Darkness), by whom she becomes the mother of Aether and Hemera (Day). Without the assistance of a father, Nyx produces Moros (Doom, Destiny), Ker (Destruction, Death), Thanatos (Death), Hypnos (Sleep), the Oneiroi (Dreams), Momus (Blame), Oizys (Pain, Distress), the Hesperides, the Moirai (Fates), the Keres, Nemesis (Indignation, Retribution), Apate (Deceit), Philotes (Love), Geras (Old Age), and Eris (Strife). A number of these offspring are similarly described as her children by later authors. Other early sources, however, give genealogies which differ from Hesiod&#x27;s. According to one such account, she is the mother of Tartarus by Aether, while in others, she is described as the mother of Eros by Aether, or the mother of Aether, Eros, and Metis by Erebus. The poet Bacchylides apparently considered Nyx to be the mother of Hemera by Chronos (Time), and elsewhere mentions Hecate as her daughter. Aeschylus mentions Nyx as the mother of the Erinyes (Furies), while Euripides considered Lyssa (Madness) to be the daughter of Nyx and Uranus.

Nox, the Roman equivalent of Nyx, features in several genealogies given by Roman authors. According to Cicero, Aether and Dies (Day) are the children of Nox and Erebus, in addition to Amor (Love), Dolus (Guile), Metus (Fear), Labor (Toil), Invidentia (Envy), Fatum (Fate), Senectus (Old Age), Mors (Death), Tenebrae (Darkness), Miseria (Misery), Querella (Lamentation), Gratia (Favour), Fraus (Fraud), Pertinacia (Obstinacy), the Parcae, the Hesperides, and the Somnia (Dreams). In the genealogy given by the Roman mythographer Hyginus, Nox is the offspring of Chaos and Caligo (Mist), alongside Dies (Day), Erebus (Darkness), and Aether. With Erebus, she produces Fatum (Fate), Senectus (Old Age), Mors (Death), Letum (Destruction), Continentia (Strife), Somnus (Sleep), the Somnia (Dreams), Lysimeles (Thoughtfulness), Epiphron (Hedymeles), Porphyrion, Epaphus, Discordia (Discord), Miseria (Misery), Petulantia (Petulance), Nemesis, Euphrosyne (Cheerfulness), Amicitia (Friendship), Misericordia (Pity), Styx, the Parcae (Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos), and the Hesperides (Aegle, Hesperia, and Erythea). Several other Roman sources mention Nox as the mother of the Furies, with Pluto sometimes given as the father.

In an early Orphic source, in which Nyx is the first deity to exist, she is the mother of Uranus, possibly without a father. In a later account, she is described as both the consort and daughter of Phanes, by whom she becomes the mother of Uranus and Gaia. In another account, likely derived from an Orphic cosmogony, Nyx gives birth to a &quot;wind-egg&quot;, from which Eros emerges. In later Orphic sources, she is mentioned as the mother of the Stars (by Uranus?), and, in one account, is the daughter of Eros. Elsewhere, the late Greek poet Quintus Smyrnaeus mentions Nyx as the mother of Eos (Dawn), while according to Byzantine author Tzetzes, she is the mother of the Moirai, apparently by the Titan Cronus. In the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; of Nonnus, Nyx is the offspring of Chaos, as she is in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, while in a genealogy given by the 12th-century writer Michael of Ephesus (incorrectly attributed to Alexander of Aphrodisias), she is the offspring of Oceanus, and the mother of Uranus.

== Mythology ==
=== Early sources ===
Homer, in the &quot;Iliad&quot; (c. 8th century BC), relates a story in which Nyx saves Hypnos from the anger of Zeus. When Hera comes to Hypnos and attempts to persuade him into lulling Zeus to sleep, he refuses, reminding her of the last time she asked the same favour of him, when it had allowed her to persecute Heracles without her husband&#x27;s knowledge. Hypnos recounts that once Zeus awoke, he was furious, and would have hurled him into the sea, had he not fled to the protection of Nyx, as Zeus, despite his anger, was &quot;in awe of doing anything to swift Night&#x27;s displeasure&quot;. It has been suggested that the apparent status which Nyx has in Homer&#x27;s account may indicate he was aware of a genealogy in which she came before even Oceanus and Tethys (often believed to be the primeval couple in the &quot;Iliad&quot;), and Pietro Pucci claims that the story may have been derived from an earlier work, which contained a more detailed account of the event.

In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; (late 8th century BC), which the Greeks considered the &quot;standard&quot; account of the origin of the gods, Nyx is one of the earliest beings to exist, as the offspring of Chaos alongside Erebus (Darkness); in the first sexual coupling, she and Erebus produce their personified opposites, Aether and Hemera (Day). Hesiod also makes Nyx, without the aid of a father, the mother of a number of abstract personifications, which are primarily negative in nature. Despite their abstract nature, however, to the Greeks these deities would have represented forces which &quot;exercise[d] a real power in the world&quot;. Hesiod locates the home of Nyx at the far western end of the Earth, though it is unclear whether or not he considered it to be beyond Oceanus, the river which encircles the world. In a (somewhat confused) section of the Theogony, Hesiod seems to locate her home near the entrance to the underworld, and describes it as being &quot;wrapped in dark clouds&quot;. He reports that the Titan Atlas, who is holding up the sky, stands outside of the house, and that the homes of two of her children, Hypnos and Thanatos, are situated nearby. He relates that Nyx and her daughter Hemera live in the same dwelling, and that each day they pass one another at the entrance to the house, with one of them leaving and the other one entering; throughout the day, one passes across the Earth, while the other stays inside, waiting for their turn to leave. In her journey over the world, Hesiod describes Nyx as &quot;wrapped in a vaporous cloud&quot;, and as holding her son Hypnos in her arms.

Nyx features in a number of early cosmogonies other than Hesiod&#x27;s, where she is similarly mentioned among the earliest deities. The philosopher Philodemus, writing in his &quot;De pietate&quot; (&quot;On Piety&quot;), reports that the legendary poet Musaeus considered Tartarus and Night to be the first beings to exist, followed by Air. Philodemus also writes that, according to Epimenides (7th or 6th century BC), the two first principles are Air and Night, from which &quot;everything else is constituted&quot;; the Neoplatonist Damascius adds to this, stating that from Air and Night is born Tartarus, who in turn produces two Titans (by Night?). Damascius also writes that the logographer and mythographer Acusilaus (6th century BC) believed that Chaos precedes Erebus and Night, and that this pair then produce Aether, Eros, and Metis; a scholium on Theocritus, in contrast, states that Acusilaus considered Night and Aether to be the parents of Eros. In the cosmogony given by the comic playwright Antiphanes (4th century BC), as recorded by the Christian writer Irenaeus, Night is first deity to exist alongside Silence, and out of this initial pair comes Chaos. From Night and Chaos then springs Eros (Love), who in turn produces Light and the first generation of the gods. Philodemus, writing in his &quot;De pietate&quot;, also records that Night is described as the &quot;first goddess&quot; in the first book of Chrysippus&#x27; &quot;Physics&quot;, and mentions another cosmogony (the origin of which he does not specify), in which Night and Tartarus are the first pair, from whom &quot;all things are born&quot;.

Authors following Hesiod similarly describe Nyx as living at the ends of the Earth. The choral lyric poet Alcman (7th century BC), as recorded by a scholium on Sophocles, considered Nyx to live in the far north, describing the Riphean Mountains as being &quot;breast of black night&quot;. In the &quot;Geryoneis&quot; of Stesichorus (6th century BC), Nyx appears to live beyond Oceanus in the far west, as Stesichorus writes that after Helios crosses the river at the end of the day, he &quot;reach[es] the depths of holy, dark night&quot;. The Pre-Socratic philosopher Parmenides (6th or 5th centuries BC), in the proem to his philosophical treatise, appropriates Hesiod&#x27;s description of the alternation of Nyx and Hemera, referring to &quot;the gates of the ways of Night and Day&quot;, and, according to Walter Burkert, he considered the Heliades to live in the house of Night. In tragedy, the &quot;Orestes&quot; of Euripides (5th century BC) states that Nyx has her abode in Erebus, while a fragment of Sophocles mentions the &quot;springs of Night&quot;, which are located in the north. Later, Apollonius of Rhodes (3rd century BC) writes in his &quot;Argonautica&quot; that the Eridanus river &quot;ris[es] from the end of the earth, where the gates and precincts of Night are located&quot;, locating her home in the far west.

Among descriptions of Nyx in 5th century BC tragedy, Euripides, in his play &quot;Ion&quot;, represents her as being &quot;robed in black&quot;, and her chariot as being pulled by two horses. He reports that she prepares her chariot as Helios finishes his journey across the sky at the end of the day, and that the stars are her companions in her course through the sky. In a fragment from his &quot;Andromeda&quot;, he refers to her driving her chariot through Olympus, and in his &quot;Orestes&quot;, he describes her as having wings, while according to Aeschylus she wears a black robe which is &quot;studded with colourful stars&quot;. Following the 5th century BC, Apollonius of Rhodes describes her as &quot;putting the yoke on her horses&quot; as the sun is setting, and Theocritus (3rd century BC) mentions the stars as the &quot;attendants at the chariot of quiet Night&quot;.

=== Late sources ===

In the works of Roman poets, descriptions of Nox (the Roman equivalent of Nyx) put a greater emphasis on her terrifying nature. In Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; (1st century BC) she seems to have lived in the underworld, and drives a chariot across the sky, while Tibullus (1st century BC) describes her chariot as being pulled by four horses, and relates that the Stars come behind her in her journey, with Sleep following after them. In the &quot;Thebaid&quot;, Statius reports that Sleep is her &quot;charioteer&quot;, while Ovid, in his &quot;Fasti&quot;, describes her as wearing a &quot;wreath of poppy&quot; around her head.

In the works of Greek poets, Thetis is a Nereid who attracts the attention of both Zeus and Poseidon, until they receive a prophecy from the Titan Themis warning them that any son she produces will be greater in power than his father; according to the late Greek writer Libanius (4th century AD), however, it is Nyx who delivers this prophecy, rather than Themis. In the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; of Nonnus (5th century), the goddess Iris, on the request on Hera, approaches Hypnos in the &quot;ugly form&quot; of his mother Nyx, and in a lengthy speech persuades him to help set Zeus to sleep.

=== Orphic literature ===
==== An ancient theogony? ====
Several passages from early authors, which seem to be Orphic in influence, have been taken as evidence of the existence of an &quot;old&quot; or &quot;ancient&quot; Orphic theogony, in which Night was one of the earliest figures. The earliest of these is a passage from Aristophanes&#x27; comedy &quot;The Birds&quot; (414 BC), which presents a parody of a cosmogony, often considered to have been derived from an Orphic theogony. Night is described as one of the first beings to come into existence, alongside Chaos, Erebus and Tartarus, and lays a &quot;wind-egg&quot; from which Eros is born:
A passage from Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Hypsipyle&quot; (performed c. 411–407) also makes reference to Night and other early deities, seemingly containing traces of an early Orphic theogony:
Several modern scholars have interpreted these fragments as evidence of an early Orphic theogony in which Night featured as one of the first deities. According to Luc Brisson, the cosmogony which Aristophanes parodies came from a work which he calls the &quot;ancient version&quot; (&quot;la version ancienne&quot;), which he sees as the earliest Orphic theogony. In this work, he believes that Night is, by herself, the first being to exist (a position she loses in later Orphic theogonies), and that she produces an egg from which comes Eros (as she does in Aristophanes&#x27; parody), from whom all things arise. similarly sees these fragments as alluding to an &quot;ancient&quot; theogony (&quot;priscae Orphicae theogoniae&quot;) which centred around the birth of Eros from an egg, produced by &quot;Chaos-Night&quot;.

==== Eudemian Theogony ====
Night seems to have been considered the first deity in the earliest known Orphic cosmogonies. The oldest Orphic theogony in which Night is known to have appeared is the Eudemian Theogony (5th century BC), which receives its name from the philosopher Eudemus of Rhodes, a student of Aristotle, who spoke of an Orphic theogony in one of his works; this theogony was later referred to by the Neoplatonist Damascius, in his &quot;De Principiis&quot; (&quot;On First Principles&quot;), using Eudemus as his source. The only piece of information known for certain about this theogony is that it started with Night; as Damascius writes:

Aristotle similarly refers to earlier authors who attributed a primordial role to Night, presumably commenting upon the same text as his pupil. In his &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, he makes reference to theologians &quot;who make Night parent of all&quot;, and describes Night as being one of the deities who are placed as &quot;the first&quot; by &quot;the ancient poets&quot;. In addition, the Byzantine author John the Lydian writes in his &quot;De Mensibus&quot; that &quot;three first beginnings of generation sprouted out, according to Orpheus: Night, Ge, and Ouranos&quot;, a passage which scholars have seen as referring to the Eudemian Theogony. Because of this, it has been proposed that Night, presumably on her own, is described as the mother of Uranus and Gaia in the work; West takes this further, claiming that Night is the mother of Uranus and Gaia, and that they are the parents of Oceanus and Tethys, who produce the Titans.

==== Derveni Theogony ====
In the Derveni Theogony (4th century BC), an Orphic poem known through the commentary on the work found in the Derveni papyrus, Night appears to have been the first deity; according to Bernabé, she exists eternally before the creation of the cosmos, at a time when the universe sits in a state of &quot;cold and passive darkness&quot;. In a surviving line from the poem, quoted in the Derveni papyrus, she is described as the mother of Uranus:

It is unclear, however, whether or not there was a father, and, if there was, what his identity was: Bernabé argues that Night produces him without a partner (though this view has been criticised), while other scholars have suggested that Aether may have been the father, or Phanes. Gábor Betegh also adds Gaia as the offspring of Night in the poem, alongside Uranus.

In the poem, Night was called the &quot;immortal nurse of the gods&quot; (as quoted in the Derveni papyrus), and in its narrative she nurtures and gives shelter to the young Zeus. Later in the work, after Zeus overthrows his father Cronus and becomes king, he consults Night on how he can consolidate his rule. She is described as she &quot;who knows all the oracles&quot;, and delivers a prophecy to him from within her shrine (&quot;adyton&quot;); several reconstructed lines from the work describe this:

After Zeus receives this prophecy from Night (and one from his father Cronus), he apparently swallows either the phallus of Uranus (or, as other have suggested, the body of Phanes).

The role which Night plays in the Derveni Theogony has been compared to that which Gaia plays in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;. It has pointed out that both are described as the mother of Uranus, and occupy a similar position at the beginning of creation, with Gaia being the second being to exist in the &quot;Theogony&quot;. In addition, following the creation of world, rather than becoming rulers themselves, both deities remain present and occasionally offer guidance and assistance to younger generations. The prophecy which Night delivers to Zeus, which causes him to swallow Phanes, has been compared to the prophecy Gaia and Uranus report to Zeus in the &quot;Theogony&quot;, which leads him to swallow his wife Metis. In the &quot;Theogony&quot;, Zeus is also given to Gaia after his birth, which has been connected to the role Night plays in nurturing the young Zeus in his infancy.

==== Rhapsodies ====
In the longest Orphic poem, the Rhapsodic Theogony, or Rhapsodies (1st century BC/AD), though the first deity to exist is Chronos, several fragments appear to assign a primordial role to Night. Several writers describe the elemental mass from which Chronos emerges as dark and shadowy in nature, while the Byzantine author John Malalas reports that in Orpheus it is &quot;gloomy Night&quot; who &quot;[comes] first&quot;, and Damascius similarly refers to Night as the &quot;first being&quot;. When the god Phanes springs from the cosmic egg created by Chronos, there emerges a bright light, at which point Night is the only one who looks upon him. Phanes then creates the cosmos, doing so from within the cave of Night; a passage from the Rhapsodies states that &quot;these things are what the father made in the misty cave&quot;, and the Neoplatonist philosopher Hermias describes Phanes as being seated in the &quot;shrine of Night&quot;. Damascius similarly records that the two deities live together, while Proclus refers to the couple as the &quot;two rulers in the sky ... seated eternally in the innermost shrine&quot;. In the poem&#x27;s narrative, Night is both the consort and his daughter of Phanes, and, by him, becomes the mother of Uranus and Gaia. She is described as the second ruler of the gods, being preceded in this role by Phanes, and followed by her son Uranus. Proclus relates that Phanes passes on his rule to Nyx by giving her a sceptre which he created himself, handing it on to her willingly, and that after her own time as ruler, she too passes on the sceptre voluntarily, giving it to her son Uranus. When Phanes gives her the sceptre, he seemingly also confers upon her the gift of prophecy.

Proclus reports that Night is called the &quot;immortal nurse of the gods&quot; in the Rhapsodies, as she is the Derveni Theogony, and Damascius similarly refers to her as the &quot;nurse of all things&quot;. In the poem&#x27;s narrative, she is described as raising her grandson Cronus, though West suggests that she may have nurtured all of the Titans. According to Hermias, the young Zeus is reared in the cave of Night by the nymphs Amalthea and Adrasteia, the latter of which protects the child by standing at the door of the cave, clanging cymbals. Once Zeus reaches adulthood, Night delivers several prophecies to him, presumably from this same cave. During the reign of Cronus, she prophesies to Zeus that he will become the fifth king of the gods, and advises him on how he can overthrow his father. She directs him to use a &quot;trick through honey&quot;, and then wait until Cronus is standing &quot;under trees with high foliage, drunk with the works of loud-buzzing bees&quot;, before binding him. After becoming king, Zeus returns to Night, and asks her how he can solidify his rule, to which she responds:

After hearing this advice, Zeus consumes his ancestor Phanes, and, in doing so, takes in the entire creation, which he contains in his stomach. Following this, Zeus keeps Night as his advisor, and it is on her recommendation that he takes Nomos (Law) to sit beside him. Night also prophesies that Themis, who becomes Zeus&#x27;s consort, will continue to be a virgin until a son of Cronus and Rhea is born.

Several fragments from the Rhapsodies seem to refer to three separate deities named Night. Hermias reports that &quot;three Nights have been transmitted in Orpheus&quot;, and gives them the following descriptions:

Clémence Ramnoux interprets these three Nights as forming a &quot;feminine trinity&quot; around Phanes, the first being his mother, the second his consort, and the third his daughter. Bernabé, in his collection of Orphic fragments, arranges passages relating to Night into three groups, interpreting the Nights as three separate deities who appear in different parts of the poem&#x27;s narrative. He sees the first Night as a primordial deity, eternal in nature, and the offspring of Chronos, and interprets this as the Night who observes Phanes at his emergence from the egg; he views her as the same figure described as the nurse of the gods, as well as the Night who prophesies, claiming that she receives the gift of prophecy from Chronos. A passage from Proclus relates that Phanes &quot;brings forth the Nights and, as a father, has intercourse with the middle one&quot;, which Bernabé sees as referring to the second Night giving birth to the third. Brisson interprets Night as the feminine aspect of the bisexual deity Phanes, who is simultaneously his mother, sister, and daughter, and argues that when he mates with Night he is copulating with this feminine half. Dwayne Meisner, however, rejects the idea that there were three separate Nights in the poem, and interprets Hermias&#x27;s passage in terms of Neoplatonic allegory. One passage from Proclus apparently describes there as being five Nights, as opposed to three.

==== Later sources ====
The fifth of the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot; (2nd century AD?) is dedicated to Night, and describes her as the &quot;mother of gods and men&quot;, who &quot;gave birth to all&quot;; in this role as a progenitor, she is addressed in the &quot;Hymn&quot; as Cypris (an epithet of Aphrodite). In the proem to the &quot;Hymns&quot;, in which Orpheus addresses Musaeus, she is similarly called the &quot;oldest of all&quot;. The later &quot;Orphic Argonautica&quot; (4th or 5th centuries AD) also mentions &quot;holy oracles of Night about the lord Bacchus&quot;, seemingly referring to the Rhapsodies.

== Iconography ==

In ancient Greek and Roman art, Nyx is often difficult to identify, as she lacks a specific defined appearance, and it can be hard to distinguish her from other deities, such as Selene and Eos. According to Pausanias, she was depicted on the chest of Cypselus (6th century BC) as the nurse of Hypnos and Thanatos, where she held the two gods, portrayed as children, in each of her hands. In the 5th century BC, Nyx appears on a number of vases alongside other celestial deities such as Helios, Selene, and Eos. The earliest surviving representation of Nyx is an Attic lekythos (c. 500 BC), which shows her driving a two-horse chariot away from Helios, who is ascending into the sky in his quadriga at the start of the new day. Most depictions of Nyx portray her as having wings, and in early representations she is usually shown riding in a chariot. On the lid of a 5th-century BC Athenian pyxis, for example, she is a winged figure driving a chariot pulled by four horses, with stars dotted above her head; she rides towards a column which signifies the edge of the world, and is followed by Selene and Helios (or Eos). She is sometimes also shown wearing a dress which has black borders, or has a black piece of cloth placed on her clothes; on an Attic kylix, for example, is a winged figure (probably Nyx) wearing a black-bordered peplos, walking behind the horse of Selene.

Following the 5th century BC, depictions of Nyx no longer show her alongside other celestial deities, and most representations are uncertain. She has been identified as one of the deities fighting against the Giants on the Gigantomachy frieze of the Pergamon Altar (2nd century BC), where she is shown grabbing the edge of a shield belonging to bearded giant, and in her other hand holds a jar with a snake wrapped around it. In later depictions, Nyx is often portrayed as a &quot;velificans&quot; (with a veil billowing behind her head), and on Roman sarcophagi is a figure who puts others to sleep.

== Cult ==
There exist few examples of Nyx having played a role in cult. According to Pausanias, there was an oracle which belonged to Night on the acropolis of Megara, alongside temples to Dionysus Nyktelios and Zeus, and a sanctuary of Aphrodite. A scholiast on Pindar claims that Nyx was the earliest owner of the Oracle of Delphi, and was followed in this role by Themis and Python, while according to Menander Rhetor, Apollo competed with Nyx, Poseidon, and Themis for control of the site. Plutarch similarly refers to an oracle which belonged to Nyx and Selene. In addition to her association with oracles, Pausanias records that there was a statue of Night in the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, created by the artist Rhoecus. Several Roman authors also mention animals which were sacrificed to Night: Ovid refers to black roosters slain to her, Statius black bulls, and Virgil a black sheep.

<doc id="82140" wikidata="Q27026" url="?curid=82140" title="Central Valley (California)">
<text>The Central Valley is a broad, elongated, flat valley that dominates the interior of California, United States. It is wide and runs approximately from north-northwest to south-southeast, inland from and parallel to the Pacific coast of the state. It covers approximately , about 11% of California&#x27;s land area. The valley is bounded by the Coast Ranges to the west and the Sierra Nevada to the east.

The Central Valley is a region known for its agricultural productivity. It provides a large share of the food produced in California, which provides more than half of the fruits, vegetables, and nuts grown in the United States. More than of the valley are irrigated via reservoirs and canals. The valley hosts many cities, including the state capital Sacramento, as well as Redding, Chico, Stockton, Modesto, Merced, Fresno, Visalia, Porterville, and Bakersfield.

The Central Valley watershed comprises , or over a third of California. It consists of three main drainage systems: the Sacramento Valley in the north, which receives over of rain annually; the drier San Joaquin Valley in the south, and the Tulare Basin and its semi-arid desert climate at the southernmost end. The Sacramento and San Joaquin river systems drain their respective valleys and meet to form the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, a large expanse of interconnected canals, stream beds, sloughs, marshes and peat islands. The delta empties into the San Francisco Bay, and ultimately into the Pacific. The waters of the Tulare Basin essentially never reach the ocean (with the exception of Kings River waters diverted northward for irrigation), though they are connected by man-made canals to the San Joaquin.

The valley encompasses all or parts of 18 California counties: Butte, Colusa, Glenn, Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, Placer, San Joaquin, Sacramento, Shasta, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tehama, Tulare, Yolo and Yuba. Given the Central Valley&#x27;s geographical isolation from most North American commercial markets, and its high rates of poverty, asthma, and fungal lung infection, the Valley has struggled to transform its economy into relevance beyond its role as an agricultural breadbasket.

Older names include &quot;the Great Valley&quot;, a name still often seen in scientific references (notably Great Valley Sequence), as well as &quot;Golden Empire&quot;, a booster name that is still referred to by some organizations (notably Golden Empire Transit, Golden Empire Council).

Ideas about what constitutes the &quot;Central Valley&quot; can vary from person-to-person. While almost all authoritative sources and external observers consider the Sacramento Valley to be part of the &quot;Central Valley&quot;, many residents consider the Central Valley to consist of only the San Joaquin Valley. This is perhaps due to significant landscape and cultural differences between the two; the San Joaquin Valley is poorer and drier with more fertile soil, while the Sacramento Valley is wealthier and wetter with poorer soils. The major presence of the Sacramento River and its tributaries in the Sacramento Valley, with its high year-round flow and wide waterways, has been compared to the small and seasonal rivers of the San Joaquin basin; this also contributes to different identities between the two regions.

==Population==
Subregions and their counties commonly associated with the valley include:
* North Sacramento Valley (all or parts of Shasta, Tehama, Glenn, Butte and Colusa counties)
* Sacramento Metropolitan area (all or parts of Sacramento, El Dorado, Sutter, Yuba, Yolo and Placer counties)
* North San Joaquin (all or parts of San Joaquin, Stanislaus and Merced counties)
* South San Joaquin (all or parts of Madera, Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Kern counties)

The four main population centers in the Central Valley area are roughly equidistant from the next. From south to north, they are Bakersfield, Fresno, Sacramento and Redding. While these four cities act as hubs for regional commerce and transportation, the Central Valley&#x27;s geographical isolation from most North American commercial markets (among major American highways only Interstate 80 directly connects the Valley to the eastern United States), and its high demographic rates of poverty, asthma, and fungal lung infection, the Valley has struggled to transform its economy into relevance beyond its role as an agricultural breadbasket, with profound consequences on its population dynamics.

The table displays the counties of Central Valley and their respective population during the 2020 US Decennial Census. Total jobs for each county is from the U.S. Census Bureau, OnTheMap Application and LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (Beginning of Quarter Employment, 2nd Quarter of 2002–2020).
===Metropolitan areas===
As of 2020, some 7.2 million people lived in the Central Valley; it was the fastest-growing region in California. It includes 12 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) and 1 Micropolitan Statistical Area (μSA). Below, they are listed by MSA and μSA population. The largest city is Fresno followed by the state capital Sacramento. The following metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas are listed from largest to smallest:
===Ethnography===
After English and Spanish, Punjabi is the third most commonly spoken language in the Central Valley. The valley has the largest Sikh population in the nation.

==Geology==

The flatness of the valley floor contrasts with the rugged hills or gentle mountains that are typical of most of California&#x27;s terrain. The valley is thought to have originated below sea level as an offshore area depressed by subduction of the Farallon Plate into a trench farther offshore. The valley has no earthquake faults of its own but is surrounded by faults to the east and west.
The valley was enclosed by the uplift of the Coast Ranges, with its original outlet into Monterey Bay. Faulting moved the Coast Ranges, and a new outlet developed near what is now San Francisco Bay. Over the millennia, the valley filled with the sediments of these same ranges, as well as the rising Sierra Nevada to the east; that filling eventually created an extraordinary flatness just barely above sea level. Before California&#x27;s flood control and aqueduct system was built, annual snow melt turned much of the valley into an inland sea.

The one notable exception to the flat valley floor is Sutter Buttes, the remnants of an extinct volcano just to the northwest of Yuba City.

Another significant geologic feature of the Central Valley lies hidden beneath the delta. The Stockton Arch is an upwarping of the crust beneath the valley sediments that extends southwest to northeast across the valley.

The Central Valley lies within the California Trough physiographic section, which is part of the larger Pacific Border province, which in turn is part of the Pacific Mountain System.

Excessive groundwater pumping in Central Valley has caused measurable amounts of land subsidence in recent years.

==Environment==
===Flora===

The Central Valley was formerly a diverse expanse of grassland, containing areas of prairie, desert grassland (at the southern end), oak savanna, riparian forest, marsh, several types of seasonal vernal pools, and large lakes such as now-dry Tulare Lake (once the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi), Buena Vista Lake and Kern Lake. However, much of the Central Valley environment has been altered by human activity, including the introduction of exotic plants, notably grasses. The valley&#x27;s grasslands, wetlands, and riparian forests constitute the California Central Valley grasslands, a temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands ecoregion. The foothill oak woodlands and chaparral that fringe the valley have been categorized as the California interior chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. High rates of poverty, asthma, and fungal lung infection have resulted in the Central Valley due to a combination of its climate, its geography and valley topography, and its heavily agricultural economy.

The dominant grass of the valley was &quot;Nassella pulchra&quot; mixed with other species, but today only 1% of the grassland in the valley is intact. Grassland flowers include California poppy (&quot;Eschscholzia californica&quot;), lupins, and purple owl&#x27;s clover (&quot;Castilleja exserta&quot;), which can still be seen, especially in Antelope Valley in the Tehachapi Mountains. Riverside trees include willows, western sycamore (&quot;Platanus racemosa&quot;), box elder (&quot;Acer negundo&quot;), Fremont cottonwood (&quot;Populus fremontii&quot;), and the endemic valley oak (&quot;Quercus lobata&quot;). Another endemic species is brittlescale (&quot;Atriplex depressa&quot;) which grows in saline and alkali soils.

===Fauna===
The Central Valley was once home to large populations of pronghorn antelope (&quot;Antilocapra americana&quot;), elk including the endemic tule elk subspecies (&quot;Cervus elaphus nannodes&quot;), mule deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus&quot;), California ground squirrels, gophers, mice, hare, rabbits and kangaroo rats, along with their predators including the San Joaquin kit fox (an endangered subspecies surviving on the San Joaquin Valley&#x27;s hillsides). The valley&#x27;s wetlands were an important habitat for wintering waterbirds and migrating birds of other kinds. Reptiles and amphibians of the valley include the endemic San Joaquin coachwhip snake (&quot;Masticophis flagellum ruddocki&quot;), blunt-nosed leopard lizard (&quot;Gambelia sila&quot;), Gilbert&#x27;s skink (&quot;Eumeces gilberti&quot;) and the western aquatic garter snake (&quot;Thamnophis couchii&quot;). Endemic invertebrates are present. The Central Valley is home to endemic fish species, including the Sacramento pikeminnow, Sacramento perch, Sacramento blackfish, and Sacramento splittail.

===Protected areas===
The Great Valley Grasslands State Park preserves an example of the valley&#x27;s native grass habitat, while oak savanna habitats survive near Visalia. Areas of wetland and riverside woodland are found in the north, especially by the Sacramento River system, including the Nature Conservancy&#x27;s Cosumnes River Preserve just south of Sacramento, Gray Lodge Wildlife Area, Butte Sink Wildlife Management Area, and other patches in the delta area. Remaining vernal pools include Pixley National Wildlife Refuge between Tulare, California, and Bakersfield and Jepson Prairie Preserve in the delta. Large blocks of desert scrubland exist in the southern San Joaquin Valley and the Carrizo Plain, just outside the valley, but offering a similar landscape.

The wetlands have been the target of rescue operations to restore areas replaced by agriculture.

These patches of natural habitat are disconnected, which is particularly damaging for wildlife that is used to migrating along the rivers. Agriculture, grazing land, and the draining of lakes and rivers have radically altered valley habitats. Most of the grassland has been overtaken by new species; most vernal pools have been destroyed, leaving only those on the higher slopes; the marshland has been drained, and the riverbank woodlands have nearly all been affected.

===Health===

The valley gives its name to Valley fever, which is primarily a disease of the lungs that is common in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is caused by the fungus &quot;Coccidioides immitis&quot;, which grows in soils in areas of low rainfall, high summer temperatures, and moderate winter temperatures. These fungal spores become airborne when the soil is disturbed by winds, construction, or farming. This illness frequently takes weeks or months to resolve. Occasionally Valley Fever is life-threatening or even fatal. Given the Central Valley&#x27;s high rates of poverty, asthma, and fungal lung infection, compounded by its geographic desolation relative to most North American commercial markets, the Valley has struggled to transform its economy into relevance beyond its role as an agricultural breadbasket.

Due to the agricultural industry&#x27;s significant presence in the Valley, pesticide drift and leaching have become concerns. Residents risk contamination when living in proximity to application sites.

=== Air pollution ===

Air pollution is a growing problem that affects all of the citizens in the Central Valley. Some reasons of poor air pollution in the Central Valley are due to agriculture and its geographical features, increasing the stagnation of automobile and other particulate pollution.

Since the Central Valley consists mostly of farming land in a wide, flat valley, the emissions from the soil that is used for growing produce are released into the air. The soil exudes nitrous oxide, an odorless and colorless gas that can be harmful when exposed to it for a long period of time, and incorporates itself into the ozone layer located at ground level. Production of nitrous oxide in California has shown that the addition of soil and fertilization can emit about 161,100 metric tons per year. Long term effects that nitrous oxide can have on a human being is loss of blood pressure, fainting, anemia, or lung cancer.

The physical geographical attributes can also contribute to the air pollution quality. The Central Valley is surrounded by mountain ranges which can capture the pollution coming from the agricultural farming, preventing it from dispersing from the other areas in California.

==Climate==
The northern Central Valley has a hot Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;); the more southerly parts in rainshadow zones are dry enough to be Mediterranean steppe or even low-latitude desert (&quot;BWh&quot;, as in areas around Bakersfield). It is very hot and dry during the summer and cool and damp in winter when frequent ground fog known regionally as &quot;tule fog&quot; can obscure vision. Summer daytime temperatures frequently surpass , and common heat waves might bring temperatures exceeding . Mid-autumn to mid-spring is the &quot;rainy season&quot;—although during the late summer, southeasterly winds can bring tropical thunderstorms, mainly in the southern half of the San Joaquin Valley but occasionally to the Sacramento Valley. The northern half of the Central Valley receives greater precipitation than the semidesert southern half. Frost occurs at times in the fall months, but snow is extremely rare.

===Tule fog===


Tule fog is a thick ground fog that settles along the valley&#x27;s length. Tule fog forms during the late fall and winter (California&#x27;s rainy season), after the first significant rainfall. The official season is from November 1 to March 31. This phenomenon is named after the valley&#x27;s tule grass wetlands (&quot;tulares&quot;). Auto collisions caused by the tule fog are the leading cause of weather-related casualties in California.

==Hydrography==
Two river systems drain and define the two parts of the Central Valley. The Sacramento River, along with its tributaries the Feather River and American River, flows southwards through the Sacramento Valley for about . In the San Joaquin Valley, the San Joaquin River flows roughly northwest for , picking up tributaries such as the Merced River, Tuolumne River, Stanislaus River and Mokelumne River. The Central Valley watershed encompasses over a third of California at , with 46 percent draining into the Sacramento River, 26 percent into the San Joaquin, and 27 percent into Tulare Lake.

In the southern part of the San Joaquin Valley, the alluvial fan of the Kings River and another from Coast Ranges streams have created a divide. The dry Tulare basin of the Central Valley receives flow from four major Sierra Nevada rivers, the Kings, Kaweah, Tule, and Kern. This basin, usually endorheic, formerly filled during snowmelt and spilled out into the San Joaquin River. Called Tulare Lake, it is usually dry because the rivers feeding it have been diverted for agricultural purposes.

Central Valley rivers converge in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a network of marshy channels, distributaries, and sloughs that wind around islands mainly used for agriculture. There the rivers merge with tidewater, and eventually reach the ocean after passing through Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, upper San Francisco Bay, and finally the Golden Gate. Many of the islands lie below sea level because of intensive agriculture, and face a high risk of flooding, which would allow salt water to rush back into the delta, especially when too little fresh water is flowing in from the Valley.

The Sacramento River carries far more water than the San Joaquin, with an estimated of virgin annual runoff, as compared to the San Joaquin&#x27;s approximately . Intensive agricultural and municipal water consumption decreased the rate of outflow to about for the Sacramento and for the San Joaquin. These figures vary widely from year to year. Over 25 million people, living in the valley and other regions of the state, rely on the water carried by these rivers.

===River engineering===
Sierra Nevada runoff provides one of California&#x27;s largest water resources. The Sacramento River is the second largest river to empty into the Pacific from the contiguous United States, behind only the Columbia River and greater than the Colorado River. Combined with the fertile and expansive area of the Central Valley&#x27;s floor, the Central Valley is ideal for agriculture.

The Central Valley is one of the United States&#x27; most productive growing regions. This is made possible by engineering the watercourses to prevent flooding during the spring snowmelt and drying up in the summer and autumn. Many dams, including Shasta Dam, Oroville Dam, Folsom Dam, New Melones Dam, Don Pedro Dam, Hetch Hetchy Dam, Friant Dam, Pine Flat Dam and Isabella Dam, were constructed on the rivers, with many of them being part of the Central Valley Project. These dams impact physical, economic, cultural, and ecological resources: for example, enabling the development of its vast agricultural resources but leading to the loss of the Chinook salmon.

Post-World War II demand for urban development, most notably the San Francisco Bay Area and the Los Angeles/Inland Empire/San Diego, required water resources. Moreover, agriculture in the southern Central Valley required far more water than was available locally. The Feather River in the Sacramento Valley was looked to as a water source, leading to the California State Water Project. This transports water to the southern San Joaquin Valley and urban areas south of the Tehachapi Mountains.

Runoff from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers is intercepted in the delta through a series of pumps that divert water into the California Aqueduct, which runs south along the length of the San Joaquin Valley. In parallel, pumps divert water into the Delta–Mendota Canal. The flow of the Sacramento River is further supplemented by a tunnel from the Trinity River (a tributary of the Klamath River, northwest of the Sacramento Valley) near Redding. Cities of the San Francisco Bay Area, also needing water, built aqueducts from the Mokelumne River and Tuolumne River that run east to west across the middle part of the Central Valley.

===Flooding===
Most valley lowlands are prone to flooding, especially in the old Tulare Lake, Buena Vista Lake, and Kern Lake rivers. The Kings, Kaweah, Tule and Kern rivers originally flowed into these seasonal lakes, which would expand each spring to flood large parts of the southern San Joaquin Valley. Farms, towns, and infrastructure in these lakebeds are protected with levee systems, while the risk of floods damaging properties increased greatly.

The Great Flood of 1862 was the valley&#x27;s worst flood in recorded history, flooding most of the valley and putting some places as much as under water.

In 2003, it was determined that Sacramento had both the least protection against and nearly the highest risk of flooding. Congress then granted a $220 million loan for upgrades in Sacramento County. Other counties in the valley that often face flooding are Yuba, Stanislaus, and San Joaquin.

=== Landslides ===
There is a very strong positive correlation between rainfall and slow-moving landslides in Northern California, especially in the Central Valley region. Changes in climate and precipitation levels have shown that consistent average rainfall has increased the number and intensity of landslides within the past 5–6 years. This information was shown in a study that focused on the behavior of these slow-moving landslides and how their nature changed with years of extreme average rainfall versus minimal average rainfall. In 2016, the average annual precipitation levels were lower because of a drought that was coming to an end at that time. The minimal rainfall in that year showed that 119 landslides had been moving. Comparatively, in 2017, there were very extreme levels of precipitation in the Central Valley, which cause 312 landslides to move that year. Slow-moving landslides are impacted even if the intensity of the rainfall is not as severe.

Consistent, moderately intense rainfall increases the saturation of water in the ground. This over-saturation is what causes the movement of a slow-moving landslide, rather than the more quick-moving and rigorous landslides that also occur in this region of California. Quick-moving landslides are caused by very intense rain, or sometimes earthquakes, that make a greater difference in the land in a shorter amount of time. According to a survey paper written in 1988 about a storm that occurred in 1982 in the Central Valley region, rainstorms that can cause that type of landslide to happen about every 5 years. Landslides to higher degrees, such as the ones that happened due to the 1982 storm, only occur every 20 to 100+ years. This intense storm in the San Francisco Bay area caused a lot of damage as a result of moving debris and landslides. They caused damage to the land and put people living in these areas that are susceptible to these disasters in great harm. The aftermath of this storm involved millions of dollars in retributions to restore the land and surrounding areas. It also led people to make greater efforts into planning around the danger of these landslides, as in how to manipulate the land to accommodate the consequences.

=== Droughts ===

Out of the past twenty-two years, California has experienced significant drought conditions for thirteen years. From 2000 to 2018 was the second driest period that California has ever experienced. The driest three-year period ever in California was from 2012 to 2014. Three-quarters of the state of California is experiencing extreme drought conditions. There are also multiple types of droughts such as agricultural droughts, meteorological droughts, snow droughts, and hydrological droughts. All of these droughts affect California in different ways. Droughts can damage forests and can cause wildfires. Droughts cause forests to become dry which causes trees to die. Dead trees result in wildfires. The U.S. drought monitor is released every Thursday, showing which parts of the U.S. are in a drought. It started in 2000, and since then the longest duration of a drought in California lasted a total of 376 weeks. It started on December 11, 2011, and ended on March 5, 2019. The most intense period captured on the drought monitor was on the week of July 29, 2014. It showed that 58.41% of California&#x27;s land was affected by a drought. In 2014–2015, farm-related losses in California totaled $5 billion and 20,000 farmers also lost their jobs.

==Economy==
Agriculture is the primary industry in most of the Central Valley. A notable exception is the Sacramento area, which hosts a large and stable workforce of government employees. Despite state hiring cutbacks and the closure of several military bases, Sacramento&#x27;s economy has continued to expand and diversify and now more closely resembles that of the San Francisco Bay Area. Primary sources of population growth are Bay Area migrants seeking lower housing costs, augmented by immigration from Asia, Central America, Mexico, Ukraine, and the rest of the former Soviet Union. The Central Valley&#x27;s geographical isolation from most North American commercial markets, and its high rates of poverty, asthma, and fungal lung infection, have impeded the Valley from transforming its economy into relevance beyond its role as an agricultural breadbasket.

===Agriculture===
The Central Valley is one of the world&#x27;s most productive agricultural regions. More than 230 crops are grown there. On less than 1 percent of the total farmland in the United States, the Central Valley produces 8 percent of the nation&#x27;s agricultural output by value: US$43.5 billion in 2013. California&#x27;s farms and ranches earned almost $50 billion in 2018. The valley&#x27;s productivity relies on irrigation from surface water and badly depleted underground aquifers. About one-sixth of the US&#x27; irrigated land is in the Central Valley.

Virtually all non-tropical crops are grown in the Central Valley, which is the primary source for produce throughout the United States, including tomatoes, grapes, cotton, apricots, and asparagus. Six thousand almond growers produced more than in 2000, about 70 percent of the world&#x27;s supply and nearly 100 percent of domestic production.

The US&#x27; top four counties in agricultural sales are in the Central Valley (2007 Data).

Early farming was concentrated close to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where the water table was high year-round and water transport was readily available. Subsequent irrigation projects brought many more parts of the valley into productive use. The even larger California State Water Project was formed in the 1950s and construction continued over the following decades.

===National Farmworkers Association (NFWA)===

In the 1960s, farm labor leaders Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta organized Mexican American grape pickers into a union, the National Farmworkers Association (NFWA), to improve their working conditions. This organizing took place primarily in the Central Valley because of the extensive agriculture, especially in and around Delano.

==Utilities==

The state water project&#x27;s Oroville Dam in the Sacramento Valley provides water and power for the California Aqueduct in the San Joaquin Valley. The aqueduct runs from Clifton Court Forebay in the Delta southwards across the Transverse Ranges. The Central Valley Project includes numerous facilities between Shasta Dam in the north and Bakersfield in the south. Pacific Gas and Electric, Western Area Power Administration, and Southern California Edison built an interconnected electric grid connecting the north and south ends of the Central Valley.

<text>Edward Frederic Benson (24 July 1867 – 29 February 1940) was an English novelist, biographer, memoirist, historian and short story writer.

==Early life==
E. F. Benson was born at Wellington College in Berkshire, the fifth child of the headmaster, Edward White Benson (later chancellor of Lincoln Cathedral, Bishop of Truro and Archbishop of Canterbury), and his wife born Mary Sidgwick (&quot;Minnie&quot;).

E. F. Benson was the younger brother of Arthur Christopher Benson, who wrote the words to &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;, Robert Hugh Benson, author of several novels and Roman Catholic apologetic works, and Margaret Benson (Maggie), an author and amateur Egyptologist. Two other siblings died young. Benson&#x27;s parents had six children and no grandchildren.

Benson was educated at Temple Grove School, then at Marlborough College, where he wrote some of his earliest works and upon which he based his novel &quot;David Blaize&quot;. He continued his education at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he was a member of the Pitt Club, and later in life he became an honorary fellow of Magdalene College.

==Works==
Benson was a precocious and prolific writer. His first book was &quot;Sketches from Marlborough&quot;, published while he was a student. He started his novel-writing career with the (then) fashionably controversial &quot;Dodo&quot; (1893), which was an instant success, and followed it with a variety of satire and romantic and supernatural melodrama. He repeated the success of &quot;Dodo&quot;, which featured a scathing description of composer and militant suffragette Ethel Smyth, with the same cast of characters a generation later: &quot;Dodo the Second&quot; (1914), &quot;a unique chronicle of the pre-1914 Bright Young Things&quot; and &quot;Dodo Wonders&quot; (1921), &quot;a first-hand social history of the Great War in Mayfair and the Shires&quot;.

The Mapp and Lucia series, written relatively late in his career, consists of six novels and two short stories. The novels are: &quot;Queen Lucia&quot;, &quot;Miss Mapp&quot;, &quot;Lucia in London&quot;, &quot;Mapp and Lucia&quot;, &quot;Lucia&#x27;s Progress&quot; (published as &quot;The Worshipful Lucia&quot; in the United States) and &quot;Trouble for Lucia&quot;. The short stories are &quot;The Male Impersonator&quot; and &quot;Desirable Residences&quot;. Both appear in anthologies of Benson&#x27;s short stories, and the former is also often appended to the end of the novel &quot;Miss Mapp&quot;.

Benson was also known as a writer of atmospheric and at times humorous or satirical ghost stories, which often were published in story magazines such as &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Magazine&quot; or &quot;Hutchinson&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, twenty of which were illustrated by Edmund Blampied. These &quot;spook stories&quot;, as he called them, were reprinted in collections by his principal publisher Walter Hutchinson. His 1906 short story &quot;The Bus-Conductor&quot;, a fatal-crash premonition tale about a person haunted by a hearse driver, has been adapted several times.

Benson&#x27;s story &quot;David Blaize and the Blue Door&quot; (1918) is a children&#x27;s fantasy influenced by the work of Lewis Carroll. &quot;Mr Tilly&#x27;s Seance&quot; is a witty and amusing story about a man flattened by a traction engine who finds himself dead and conscious on the &#x27;other side&#x27;. Other notable stories are the eerie &quot;The Room in the Tower&quot; and &quot;Pirates&quot;.

Benson is known for a series of biographies/autobiographies and memoirs, including one of Charlotte Brontë. His last book, delivered to his publisher ten days before his death, was an autobiography titled &quot;Final Edition.&quot;

==Links to Rye, East Sussex==

The principal setting of four of the Mapp and Lucia books is a town named Tilling, which is recognizably based on Rye, East Sussex, where Benson lived from 1918 and served as mayor from 1934. Benson&#x27;s home, Lamb House, served as the model for Mallards, Mapp&#x27;s – and ultimately Lucia&#x27;s – home in some of the Tilling series. There really was a handsome &quot;Garden Room&quot; adjoining the street but it was destroyed by a bomb during the Second World War. Lamb House attracted writers: it was earlier the home of Henry James, and later of Rumer Godden.

He donated a church window of the main parish church in Rye, St Mary&#x27;s, in memory of his brother, as well as providing a gift of a viewing platform overlooking the Town Salts.

==Personal life==
Benson was an intensely discreet homosexual. At Cambridge, he fell in love with several fellow students, including Vincent Yorke (father of the novelist Henry Green), about whom he confided to his diary, &quot;I feel perfectly mad about him just now... Ah, if only he knew, and yet I think he does.&quot; In later life, Benson maintained friendships with a wide circle of homosexual men and shared a villa on the Italian island of Capri with John Ellingham Brooks; before the First World War, the island had been popular with wealthy homosexual men.

Homoeroticism and a general homosexual sensibility suffuse his literary works, such as &quot;David Blaize&quot; (1916), and his most popular works are famed for their wry and dry camp humour and social observations.

In London he lived at 395 Oxford Street, W1, now a branch of Russell &amp; Bromley just west of Bond Street Underground Station, 102 Oakley Street, SW3, and 25 Brompton Square, SW3, where much of the action of &quot;Lucia in London&quot; occurs and where English Heritage placed a Blue Plaque in 1994.

==Death==
Benson died on 29 February 1940 of throat cancer at University College Hospital, London. He is buried in the cemetery at Rye, East Sussex.

<doc id="82144" wikidata="Q839730" url="?curid=82144" title="List of counties in Illinois">
<text>There are 102 counties in Illinois. The most populous of these is Cook County, the second-most populous county in the United States and the home of Chicago, while the least populous is Hardin County. The largest by land area is McLean County, while the smallest is Putnam County. Illinois&#x27;s FIPS state code is 17 and its postal abbreviation is IL.

What is now Illinois was claimed as part of Illinois County, Virginia, between 1778 and 1782. Modern-day county formation dates to 1790 when the area was part of the Northwest Territory; two counties—St. Clair and Knox—were created at that time. Knox would later become a county in Indiana and is unrelated to the current Knox County in Illinois, while St. Clair would become the oldest county in Illinois. 15 counties had been created by the time Illinois achieved statehood in 1818. The last county, Ford County, was created in 1859. Cook County, established in 1831 and named for the early Illinois Attorney General Daniel Pope Cook, contained the absolute majority of the state&#x27;s population in the first half of the 20th century and retains more than 40% of it .

Most counties in Illinois were named after early American leaders, especially of the American Revolutionary War, as well as soldiers from the Battle of Tippecanoe and the War of 1812. Some are named after natural features or counties in other states. Some are named for early Illinois leaders. Two counties are named for Native American tribes, and one bears the name of a plant used as a food source by Native Americans. While it does have a Lincoln city, Illinois does not have a county named after its favorite son, Abraham Lincoln; it does, however, have a Douglas County (founded 1859) named after his political rival Stephen A. Douglas. It also has Calhoun County (founded 1825), named after John C. Calhoun, outspoken for his pro-slavery and pro-southern views in the years preceding the American Civil War. Several of the counties are named after Southerners, reflecting the fact that Illinois was for a short time part of Virginia, and settled in its early years by many Southerners. No counties are named after heroes of the Civil War, mainly because the counties were all named before that war. The state does have a Lee County (founded 1839) named after Henry Lee III, the father of Robert E. Lee, who at one time served in Illinois. Illinois also has two counties named after the same person, New York governor DeWitt Clinton (DeWitt County, and Clinton County).

Information on the FIPS county code, county seat, year of establishment, origin, etymology, population, area and map of each county is included in the table below.

<text>Jean Berko Gleason (born 1931) is an American psycholinguist and professor emerita in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Boston University who has made fundamental contributions to the understanding of language acquisition in children, aphasia, gender differences in language development, and parent–child interactions.

Gleason created the Wug Test, in which a child is shown pictures with nonsense names and then prompted to complete statements about them, and used it to demonstrate that even young children possess implicit knowledge of linguistic morphology. Menn and Ratner have written that &quot;Perhaps no innovation other than the invention of the tape recorder has had such an indelible effect on the field of child language research&quot;, the &quot;wug&quot; (one of the imaginary creatures Gleason drew in creating the Wug Test) being &quot;so basic to what [psycholinguists] know and do that increasingly it appears in the popular literature without attribution to its origins.&quot;

==Biography==

Jean Berko was born to Hungarian immigrant parents in Cleveland, Ohio. As a child, she has said, &quot;I was under the impression that whatever you said meant something in some language.&quot; Her older brother&#x27;s cerebral palsy made it difficult for most people to understand his speech, but
After graduating from Cleveland Heights High School in 1949, Berko Gleason (then yet Berko) earned a B.A. in history and literature from Radcliffe College, then an M.A. in linguistics, and a combined Ph.D. in linguistics and psychology, at Harvard; from 1958 to 1959 she was a postdoctoral fellow at MIT. In graduate school she was advised by Roger Brown, a founder in the field of child language acquisition. In January 1959 she married Harvard mathematician Andrew Gleason; they had three daughters.

Most of Berko Gleason&#x27;s professional career has been at Boston University, where she served as Psychology Department chair and director of the Graduate Program in Applied Linguistics; Lise Menn and Harold Goodglass were among her collaborators there.

She has been a visiting scholar at Harvard University, Stanford University, and at the Linguistics Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Although officially retired and no longer teaching, she to be involved in research.

Gleason is the author or co-author of some 125 papers on language development in children, language attrition, aphasia, and gender and cultural aspects of language acquisition and use; and is editor/coeditor of two widely used textbooks, &quot;The Development of Language&quot; (first edition 1985, ninth edition 2016) and &quot;Psycholinguistics&quot; (1993). She is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and of the American Psychological Association, and was president of the International Association for the Study of Child Language from 1990 to 1993, and of the Gypsy Lore Society 1996 to 1999.
She has also served on the editorial boards of numerous academic and professional journals and was associate editor of &quot;Language&quot; from 1997 to 1999.

Gleason was profiled in &quot;Beyond the Glass Ceiling: Forty Women Whose Ideas Shape the Modern World&quot; (1996).
A festschrift in her honor, &quot;Methods for Studying Language Production&quot;, was published in 2000.
In 2016 she received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Washington &amp; Jefferson College for her work as &quot;a pioneer in the field of psycholinguistics&quot;,
and in 2017 the Roger Brown Award (recognizing &quot;outstanding contribution to the international child language community&quot;) from the International Association for the Study of Child Language.

Since 2007 she has delivered the &quot;Welcome, welcome&quot; and &quot;Goodbye, goodbye&quot; speeches at the annual Ig Nobel Awards ceremonies.

==Selected research==

===Children&#x27;s learning of English morphologythe Wug Test===

Gleason devised the Wug Test as part of her earliest research (1958), which used nonsense words to gauge children&#x27;s acquisition of morphological rulesfor example, the &quot;default&quot; rule that most English plurals are formed by adding an , , or sound depending on the final consonant, e.g. &quot; &quot;
A child is shown simple pictures of a fanciful creature or activity,
with a nonsense name, and prompted to complete a statement about it:
:&quot;This is a WUG. Now there is another one. There are two of them. There are two ________.&quot;
Each &quot;target&quot; word was a made-up (but plausible-sounding) pseudoword, so that the child cannot have heard it before.
A child who knows that the plural of &quot;witch&quot; is &quot;witches&quot; may have heard and memorized that pair, but a child responding that the plural of &quot;wug&quot; (which the child presumably has never heard) is &quot;wugs&quot; (/wʌgz/, using the /z/ allomorph since &quot;wug&quot; ends in a voiced consonant) has apparently inferred (perhaps unconsciously) the basic rule for forming plurals.

The Wug Test also includes questions involving verb conjugations, possessives, and other common derivational morphemes such as the agentive &quot;-er&quot; (e.g. &quot;A man who &#x27;zibs&#x27; is a ________?&quot;),
and requested explanations of common compound words e.g. &quot;Why is a birthday called a birthday?&quot;
Other items included:
*&quot;This is a dog with QUIRKS on him. He is all covered in QUIRKS. What kind of a dog is he? He is a ________ dog.&quot;
*&quot;This is a man who knows how to SPOW. He is SPOWING. He did the same thing yesterday. What did he do yesterday? Yesterday he ________.&quot;
(The expected answers were &quot;QUIRKY&quot; and &quot;SPOWED&quot;.)

Gleason&#x27;s major finding was that even very young children are able to connect suitable endingsto produce plurals, past tenses, possessives, and other formsto nonsense words they have never heard before, implying that they have internalized systematic aspects of the linguistic system which no one has necessarily tried to teach them.
However, she also identified an earlier stage at which children can produce such forms for real words, but not yet for nonsense wordsimplying that children start by memorizing singularplural pairs they hear spoken by others, then eventually extract rules and patterns from these examples which they apply to novel words.

The Wug Test was the first experimental proof that young children have extracted generalizable rules from the language around them, rather than simply memorizing words that they have heard, and it was almost immediately adapted for children speaking languages other than English, to bilingual children, and to children (and adults) with various impairments or from a variety of cultural backgrounds. Its conclusions are viewed as essential to the understanding of when and how children reach major language milestones, and its variations and progeny remain in use worldwide for studies on language acquisition. It is &quot;almost universal&quot; for textbooks in psycholinguistics and language acquisition to include assignments calling for the student to carry out a practical variation of the Wug Test paradigm. The ubiquity of discussion of the wug test has led to the wug being used as a mascot of sorts for linguists and linguistics students.

The Wug Test&#x27;s fundamental role in the development of psycholinguistics as a discipline has been mapped by studying references to Gleason&#x27;s work in &quot;seminal journals&quot; in the field, many of which carried articles referencing it in their founding issues:
According to Ratner and Menn, &quot;As an enduring concept in psycholinguistic research, the wug has become generic, like [&quot;kleenex&quot;] or [&quot;xerox&quot;], a concept so basic to what we know and do that increasingly it appears in the popular literature without attribution to its origins... Perhaps no innovation other than the invention of the tape recorder has had such an indelible effect on the field of child language research.&quot;

It has been proposed that Wug Testlike instruments be used in the diagnosis of learning disabilities, but in practice success in this direction has been limited.

===Parent–child interactions===

Another of Gleason&#x27;s early papers &quot;Fathers and Other Strangers: Men&#x27;s Speech to Young Children&quot; (1975) explored differences between mothers&#x27; and fathers&#x27; spoken interaction with their children, primarily using data produced by two female and two male daycare teachers at a large university, and by three mothers and three fathers, mostly during family dinners.
Among other conclusions, this study found that:
*mothers used less complex constructions in speaking to their children than did fathers;
*mothers generated lengthier and more complex constructions in speaking to their eldest child than to their younger children;
*fathers issued significantly more commands than did mothers, along with more threats and more teasing in the way of namecalling; and
*the fathers&#x27; language also reflected traditional gender roles in the families (such as in an example in which a father, playing a game with his son, directs the son to the mother when the need for a diaper change arises).

In contrast, both male and female daycare teachers used language that was similar both quantitatively and qualitatively, with both focusing on a dialogue based in the present and on the immediate needs of the children.
Differences included that the male teachers tended to address the children by name more often than did the female teachers and that the male teachers issued more imperatives than did the female teachers.

===Acquisition of routines in children===

Gleason&#x27;s research eventually extended into the study of children&#x27;s acquisition of routinesthat is, standardized chunks of language (or language-plus-gesture) that the culture expects of everyone, such as greetings, farewells, and expressions of thanks. Gleason was one of the first to study the acquisition of politeness, examining English-speaking children&#x27;s use of routines such as &quot;thank you&quot;, &quot;please&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m sorry&quot;. Researchers in this area have since studied both verbal and non-verbal routinization, and the development of politeness routines in a variety of cultures and languages.

====The Halloween routine====

Gleason&#x27;s 1976 paper with Weintraub, &quot;The Acquisition of Routines in Child Language&quot;,
analyzed performance on the culturally standardized Halloween trick-or-treat routine in 115 children aged two to sixteen years.
Alterations in ability and the function of parental contribution were analyzed concerning cognitive and social components.
They discovered that in the acquisition of routines
(in contrast to the acquisition of much of the rest of language) parents&#x27; major interest is for their children to achieve accurate performance, with little stress on children&#x27;s understanding of what they are expected to say.
Gleason and Weintraub found that the parents rarely if ever explain to children the meaning of such routines as &quot;Bye-bye&quot; or &quot;Trick or treat&quot;there was no concern with the child&#x27;s thoughts or intentions as long as the routine was performed as expected at the appropriate times.
Thus, parents&#x27; role in the acquisition of routines is very different from their role in most of the rest of language development.

====&quot;Hi, Thanks, and Goodbye&quot;====
Gleason and Greif analyzed children&#x27;s acquisition of three ubiquitous routines in &quot;Hi, Thanks, and Goodbye: More Routine Information&quot; (1980).
The subjects were eleven boys and eleven girls and their parents.
At the conclusion of a parent-child play period, an assistant entered the playroom bearing a present, in order to evoke routines from the children.
The study&#x27;s purpose was to analyze how parents communicate these routines to their children; major questions proposed included whether or not some routines were more obligatory than others, and whether mothers and fathers provide different models of politeness behavior for their children. The results suggest that children&#x27;s &quot;spontaneous&quot; construction of the three routines was low, with &quot;Thank you&quot; the rarest.
However, parents strongly encouraged their children to generate routines and, typically, the children complied.
In addition, parents were more likely to prompt the &quot;Thank you&quot; routine than the &quot;Hi&quot; and &quot;Goodbye&quot; routines.
Parents practiced the routines themselves, though mothers were more likely than fathers to speak &quot;Thank you&quot; and &quot;Goodbye&quot; to the assistant.

====Apologies====

Gleason and Ely made an in-depth study of apologies in children&#x27;s dialogue in their paper, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I said that: apologies in young children&#x27;s discourse&quot; (2006),
which analyzed apology term usage (in parent–child dialogue) of five boys and four girls, aged one to six years.
Their research suggested that apologies appear later in children than do other politeness routines, and that as the children grew older they developed a progressively refined expertise with this routine, gradually requiring fewer direct prompts and producing more elaborate apologies instead of just saying &quot;I&#x27;m sorry&quot;.
They also found that parents and other adults play an important role in fostering growth of apologetic abilities through the setting of examples, by encouraging the children to apologize, and by speaking specifically and purposefully to them about apologies.

====Attention to language in family discourse====

With Ely, MacGibbon, and Zaretsky, Gleason also explored the discourse of middle-class parents and their children at the dinner table in, &quot;Attention to Language: Lessons Learned at the Dinner Table&quot; (2001),
finding that the everyday language of these parents involves a remarkable portion of attention to language.
The dinner-table conversation of twentytwo middle-class families, each with a child between two years and five and onehalf years old, were recorded,
then analyzed for the existence and activity of languagecentered terms, including words like &quot;ask&quot;, &quot;tell&quot;, &quot;say&quot;, and &quot;speak&quot;.
Mothers spoke more about language than did fathers, and fathers spoke more about it than did children:
roughly eleven percent of mothers&#x27; sentences contained one or more languagecentered terms, and the corresponding proportions for fathers and children were seven percent and four percent.
Uses that were metalinguistic (for example, accounting for and remarking on speech) exceeded uses that were pragmatic (for example, managing how and when speech appears).

The more that mothers used language-centered terms, the more the children did as wellbut this was not true for fathers.
The results imply that in routine family conversations, parents supply children with considerable information on the way language is used to communicate information.

===Foreign-language studies===

Gleason has carried out significant research involving the learning and maintenance of second languages by sequential bilinguals. She has studied the acquisition of a second language while retaining the first (additive bilingualism),
examining discourse behaviors of parents who follow the one person-one language principle by using different languages with their child.
She has also studied language attrition, the loss of a known language through lack of use,
and suggests that the order in which a language is learned is less important in predicting its retention than the thoroughness with which it is learned.

====Psychophysiological responses to taboo words====

An unusual study carried out with Harris and Aycicegi, &quot;Taboo words and reprimands elicit greater autonomic reactivity in a first language than in a second language&quot; (2003), investigated the involuntary psychophysiological reactions of bilingual speakers to taboo words.
Thirtytwo TurkishEnglish bilinguals judged the pleasantness of an array of words and phrases in Turkish (their first language), and in English (their second), while their skin conductance was monitored via fingertip electrodes.
Participants manifested greater autonomic arousal in response to taboo words and childhood reprimands in their first language than to those in their second language, confirming the commonplace claim that speakers of two languages are less uncomfortable speaking taboo words and phrases in their second language than in their native language.

====Maintenance of first and second languages====

In &quot;Maintaining Foreign Language Skills&quot;, which discusses &quot;the personal, cultural, and instructional factors involved with keeping up foreign language skills&quot; (1988), Gleason and Pan consider both humans&#x27; remarkable capacity for language acquisition and their ability to lose it.
In addition to brain damage, strokes, trauma and other physical causes of language loss, individuals may lose language skills due to the absence of a linguistically supportive social environment in which to maintain such skills, such as when a speaker of a given language relocates to a place where that language is not spoken. Culture also factors in. More often than not, individuals speaking two or more languages come into contact with one another, for reasons ranging from emigration and interrelationships to alterations in political borders. The result of such contact is typically that the community of speakers undergoes a progressive shift in usage from one language to the other.

===Aphasia===

Gleason has also done significant research on aphasia,
a condition (usually due to brain injury) in which a person&#x27;s ability to understand and/or to produce language, including their ability to find the words they need and their use of basic morphology and syntax, is impaired in a variety of ways.

In &quot;Some Linguistic Structures in the Speech of a Broca&#x27;s Aphasic&quot; (1972) Gleason, Goodglass, Bernholtz, and Hyde discuss an experiment carried out with a man who, after a stroke, had been left with Broca&#x27;s aphasia/agrammatism,
a specific form of aphasia typically impairing the production of morphology and syntax more than it impairs comprehension.
This experiment employed the Story Completion Test (often used to probe a subject&#x27;s capacity for producing various common grammatical forms)
as well as free conversation and repetition to elicit speech from the subject;
this speech was then analyzed to evaluate how well he used inflectional morphology
(e.g. plural and past tense word endings) and basic syntax (the formation of, for example, simple declarative, imperative, and interrogative sentences).

To do this the investigator, in a few sentences, began a simple story about a pictured situation, then asked the subject to conclude the narrative.
The stories were so designed that a nonlanguageimpaired person&#x27;s response would typically employ particular structures, for example, the plural of a noun, the past tense of a verb, or a simple but complete yesno question (e.g. &quot;Did you take my shoes?&quot;).

Gleason, Goodglass, Bernholtz, and Hyde concluded that the transition from verb to object was easier for this subject than was the transition from subject to verb and that auxiliary verbs and verb inflections were the parts of speech most likely to be omitted by the subject. There was considerable variation among consecutive repeat trials of the same test item, although responses on successive attempts usually came closer to those a normal speaker would have produced. The study concluded that the subject&#x27;s speech was not the product of a stable abnormal grammar, and could not be accounted for by assuming that he was simply omitting words to minimize his effort in producing themquestions
of significant theoretical controversy at the time.

Thirty-eight parishes are governed by a council called a police jury. The remaining 26 have various other forms of government, including: council-president, council-manager, parish commission, and consolidated parish/city.

==History==
Louisiana was formed from French and Spanish colonies, which were both officially Roman Catholic. Local colonial government was based upon parishes, as the local ecclesiastical division.

Following the Louisiana Purchase, the territorial legislative council in April 1805 divided the Territory of Orleans (the predecessor of Louisiana state) into 12 counties. The borders of these counties were poorly defined, but largely coincided with the colonial ecclesiastical parishes.

On March 31, 1807, the territorial legislature created 19 parishes without abolishing any of the old counties (which term continued to exist until 1845). In 1811, a constitutional convention was held to prepare for Louisiana&#x27;s admission into the Union. This organized the state into seven judicial districts, each consisting of groups of parishes. In 1816, the first official map of the state used the term &quot;parish&quot;, as did the 1845 constitution. Since then, the official term for Louisiana&#x27;s primary civil divisions has been &quot;parishes&quot;.

The 19 original parishes were joined by Catahoula Parish in 1808. In 1810 four additional parishes were created from the formerly Spanish West Florida territory—these are part of what is now referred to as the Florida Parishes.

By April 1812, Attakapas Parish became St. Martin Parish and St. Mary Parish. On April 30, the state was admitted to the Union with 25 parishes.

By 1820, Washington Parish was added, and Feliciana Parish split into West and East in 1824. The next year, Jefferson Parish was carved from Orleans Parish. By 1830, Claiborne Parish was created, and the old Warren Parish was mostly absorbed into Ouachita Parish, only to return as Carroll Parish a few years later.

In 1838, Caddo Parish was created from Natchitoches, as were Madison and Caldwell parishes in the east. In 1839, Union Parish was formed from Ouachita, and Calcasieu was formed from St. Landry in 1840.

Five parishes were created in 1843: Bossier, DeSoto, Franklin, Sabine, and Tensas. Morehouse Parish and Vermilion Parish were formed from Ouachita and Lafayette parishes, respectively, in 1844. The next year, Jackson Parish was formed, the old county units were abandoned, and the units were officially referred to as &quot;parishes&quot;. In 1848, Bienville Parish was formed from Claiborne Parish. In 1852, Winn Parish was formed, while parishes further south added and lost land.

In 1853, Lafourche Interior Parish was renamed to Lafourche Parish. During Reconstruction, state government created a number of new parishes, with the first being Iberia and Richland parishes. Plans for creating a parish like Iberia from St. Martin and St. Mary parishes had dated from the 1840s. (A surveying error in Iberia&#x27;s creation broke St. Martin Parish into two non-contiguous parts, making it and Norfolk County, Massachusetts as the only county-level units with their own exclaves.) Tangipahoa and Grant parishes followed in 1869. In 1870, the fifth Reconstruction parish, Cameron, was created, which was followed by the sixth, seventh, and eighth parishes (Red River, Vernon, and Webster, respectively) in 1871. The ninth parish to be formed under Radical Republican rule was Lincoln, named after the late president and formed in 1873. In 1877, the old parish of Carroll divided into East and West Carroll parishes, which are unofficially called the tenth and eleventh Reconstruction parishes, as the project ended that year.

No new parishes were formed until 1886, when Acadia Parish was formed from St. Landry. Again, no new parishes were formed, this time until 1908, when the western half of Catahoula parish became LaSalle parish.

In 1910, the parish count rose to 61 with the creation of Evangeline Parish, and the 62nd, 63rd, and 64th parishes (Allen, Beauregard, and Jefferson Davis) were created from areas of Calcasieu Parish. There were several minor boundary changes afterward, the most substantial being the division of Lake Pontchartrain among Tangipahoa, St. Tammany, Orleans, Jefferson, St. John the Baptist, and St. Charles Parishes in 1979.

== Territorial counties ==
On April 10, 1805, the Territorial Council enacted a map dividing the territory into 12 counties based upon ecclesiastical districts established under Spanish rule. In 1807, the Territorial Council revised the 12-county system to create 19 civil parishes.

The original twelve counties defined by the Territorial Legislative Council in 1805 were:
* Acadia County – Parishes of St. James and the Ascension (also known as the First and Second Acadian Coasts). In 1807, divided into Ascension and St. James parishes.
* Attakapas County – Parish of St. Martin. In 1807, renamed Attakapas Parish. In 1811, it was subdivided into St. Martin and St. Mary parishes.
* Concordia County – The only portion not part of preexisting ecclesiastical district. In 1807, renamed Concordia Parish.
* German Coast County – Parishes of St. Charles and St. John the Baptist (also known as the First and Second German Coasts). In 1807, divided into St. Charles and St. John the Baptist parishes.
* Iberville County – Parish of St. Gabriel and part Parish of St. Bernard. In 1807, renamed Iberville Parish.
* Lafourche County – Parish of Assumption. In 1807, divided into Assumption and Lafourche Interior parishes.
* Natchitoches County – Parish of St. Francis. In 1807, renamed Natchitoches Parish.
* Opelousas County – Parish of St. Landry. In 1807, renamed St. Landry Parish.
* Orleans County – All territory on both sides of the &quot;Mississippi from the Balize to the beginning of the parishes of St. Bernard and St. Louis.&quot; In 1807, divided into Orleans, St. Bernard, and Plaquemines parishes.
* Ouachita County – The Ouachita settlements. In 1807, renamed Ouachita Parish.
* Pointe Coupée County – The Parish of St. Francis. In 1807, divided into Baton Rouge and Pointe Coupée parishes.
* Rapides County – The settlements of Rapides, Avoyelles, Catahoula, Bayou Boeuf, Bayou Robert, and other settlements in the region. In 1807, divided into Avoyelles and Rapides parishes.

On December 7, 1810, William C. C. Claiborne, governor of the Orleans Territory, annexed the short-lived Republic of West Florida to the United States and Louisiana as Feliciana County. On December 22, 1810, the county west of the Pearl River was organized in four civil parishes: East Baton Rouge, Feliciana, St. Helena, and St. Tammany. Later, in 1824, Feliciana Parish was divided into East Feliciana and West Feliciana parishes.

==Fictional parishes==

* In the novels &quot;Little Altars Everywhere&quot;, &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;, and Ya-Yas in Bloom, author Rebecca Wells created the fictional Garnet Parish.
* The movie &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; was said to take place in the fictional Chinquapin Parish, likely a suburban parish of Shreveport. However, the movie was shot in Natchitoches, and involved several elements of culture indicative of the town and parish of the same name. For example, the annual Christmas Festival of Lights in Natchitoches is shown, as are Cajun dance styles with a distinctive country-Cajun band. (Natchitoches is in the Crossroads region of Louisiana, where southern Louisiana&#x27;s predominantly Catholic, Cajun culture meets the primarily Protestant, Anglo culture of northern Louisiana.)
* Part of Walter Jon Williams&#x27; novel &quot;The Rift&quot; is set in the fictional Spottswood Parish.
* &quot;The Southern Vampire Mysteries&quot; series of novels written by Charlaine Harris and HBO&#x27;s &quot;True Blood&quot;, which is based on the novels, take place in the fictional northwestern Louisiana Renard Parish.
* In the movie &quot;In the Electric Mist&quot;, Deputy Jason J. Bayard was from the fictional St. Clare Parish.
* In the DC Comics Universe, Belle Reve Parish is a parish in Louisiana that contains the Bell Reve Penitentiary.
* In the movie &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, a fictional parish named Trapingus Parish is featured in the movie. The film was actually shot in Tennessee.
* In the Cinemax TV series &quot;Banshee&quot;, Chayton Littlestone is seen fighting in the fictional Sang Tholis Parish, which is said to be in New Orleans. &quot;Sang&quot; is the French word for &quot;blood&quot;, but could also be a dialect for &quot;sans&quot;, without. &quot;Tholis&quot; is not a French word. In reality, the city of New Orleans is located entirely in Orleans Parish. 
* In the movie &quot;Doctor Detroit&quot;, protagonist Clifford Skridlow (played by Dan Aykroyd) appears in a Detroit court as a stereotypical (based on &quot;Atticus Finch&quot; in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;) Southern attorney from Bay Saint Louis Parish.
* In the 2017 video game &quot;Resident Evil 7: Biohazard&quot;, the vast majority of the game takes place in the fictional Dulvey Parish, somewhere on the coast.
* The &quot;Faster, Baby!&quot; DLC for &quot;Mafia III&quot;, also a 2017 video game, takes place in Sinclair Parish just west of the fictional city of &#x27;New Bordeaux&#x27;, a fictional version of New Orleans set in 1968.
* In the 1973 James Bond film &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, Sheriff J.W. Pepper (Clifton James) of Pontrain Parish is featured as a supporting character. The parish name is likely derived from the real Lake Pontchartrain. 
* In Season 2 of &quot;Designated Survivor&quot; a flu outbreak originates in South Carroll Parish.
* The television series &quot;Queen Sugar&quot; is set in St. Josephine Parish, which borders Orleans Parish and is where the titular family; the Bordelon&#x27;s, reside.
* The 2006 sequel movie &quot;Road House 2&quot; is set in the coastal Tyree Parish.
* The 2011 crime thriller film &quot;Catch .44&quot; takes place in Civil Parish, with one of the antagonists stealing a parish sheriff deputy&#x27;s uniform. 
* The 2013 action thriller &quot;Homefront&quot; takes place in the fictional Labranche Parish, possibly named after or inspired by the real LaBranche Plantation Dependency.
* The 2014 supernatural horror film &quot;Jessabelle&quot; is set in the fictional Feliciana Parish, a genericised version of West Feliciana Parish.
* In the DC Universe series &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, the primary setting is Montrivelle Parish. The county seat of the parish is the also fictional city of Marais.
* In the 1972 movie &quot;Buck and the Preacher&quot; starring Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte and Ruby Dee, the members of the rescued wagon train were former slaves from the fictional St. Ann Parish.

<text>Suprême NTM (), or simply NTM, is a French hip hop band formed in 1989 in Saint-Denis, Île-de-France. The band comprises rappers JoeyStarr and Kool Shen. Their 6 albums were released by Sony Music.

The group takes its name from the French slang &quot;NTM&quot;, an initialism for &quot;&quot;Nique Ta Mère&quot;&quot; (&quot;Fuck Your Mother&quot;; the vulgar slang word &quot;niquer&quot; is derived from North African Sabir &quot;i nik&quot; (&quot;he makes love&quot;), which in turn comes from the Arabic &quot;nak&quot; (same meaning)). Suprême NTM is known for representing the perspective of minority groups in underprivileged, &quot;invisible&quot; neighborhoods around Paris. Through the use of politically-conscious lyrics, NTM raises awareness of police brutality, racist legislation, and youth violence, culminating in a series of highly-publicized legal battles with the French authorities. Their musical style is predominantly hardcore rap, although later albums include funk, soul and reggae influences.

The group is outspokenly critical of racism and class inequality in French society, and while their earlier music is violent, some of their later work, such as &quot;Pose ton Gun&quot; (&quot;Put down your Gun&quot;), is explicitly anti-violent.

In 1998, the group released its last album of original material under the NTM moniker, as both Joey Starr and Kool Shen started their own labels, promoting new bands and branching out in other fields such as the clothing industry (2High is Kool Shen&#x27;s brand, Com-8 is Joey Starr&#x27;s).

While officially the band still exists, and its well-known name was used in 2001 to promote a &#x27;duel&#x27; album pitting the two labels&#x27; artists against each other, Kool Shen was quoted in 2004 saying &quot;on a fini avec NTM en 98&quot; (&quot;We finished with NTM in 1998&quot;).

The group is known for its gritty, dark and sometimes violent lyrics, as well as for the contrast between the two rappers&#x27; styles. While Joey Starr (also known as Jaguar Gorgonne and Double-R) has a relatively slow flow, aggressive lyrics and a deep, booming voice (which he sometimes uses to yell such as in &quot;Pose ton Gun&quot;), Kool Shen has a funkier flow as well as witty and rather melancholic lyrics.

==Conflicts with authority==
Everything started in summer 1983 where Joey Starr and Kool Shen were watching American hip hop dancers break it down in Paris. Joey Starr and Kool Shen started learning how to dance and defined their own style, smurf for Joey Starr and break dancing for Kool Shen. They then started painting graffiti, and were part of a graffiti writer group that was composed of DRC, TCG, 93 MCs and Joey and Kool Shen. After this period Joey and Kool got into the rapping industry where they were publicly heard on the radio for the first time in 1989 on radio Nova. Understanding the background of this group facilitates understanding the message behind its harsh lyrics. NTM is considered to be a hardcore rap group; the themes in their songs are mainly about social inequality and racism where Jean-Marie Le Pen is often used as a racist figure in their songs. Some political figures proclaim that there are too many immigrants in France as a 1991 survey indicated that 71% of the French population said that there were too many Arabs in France. Most French hip hop groups are represented by the youth, and this generation is the second generation of those immigrants and were born on French soil.

The 1993 release &quot;1993… J&#x27;appuie sur la Gâchette&quot; (&quot;1993… I&#x27;m Pulling the Trigger&quot;) contained a track with the same name, about suicide, which was censored on most French TV channels (despite not creating any scandal, unlike &quot;La Police&quot;) and a track &quot;Police&quot; that featured violent criticism of the police. The police responded to this by taking NTM to court. The court decided in favor of NTM. However, many French radio stations decided to boycott the group&#x27;s music.

A second encounter with the police occurred in 1995 when the group made further comments critical of the French police during a live concert that allegedly included advocating violence against the police. The group was again taken to court, and this time they were sentenced, initially to six months imprisonment, a sentence that was shortened to two months imprisonment and a 50&#x27;000 Franc fine on appeal.

Joey Starr was later convicted of and imprisoned for charges unrelated to his musical career: assaulting a flight attendant in November 1998, and then assaulting his ex-girlfriend in 1999, shortly after his release.

Starr tried creating a new &quot;watered down&quot; public image in 2002, releasing a solo single which was not received well by critics, as it didn&#x27;t have the trademark &quot;energy&quot; of the past NTM releases. The same year, his public image suffered further when he was filmed brutalizing a pet monkey in a documentary.

In June 2009, Joeystarr was sentenced to six months in prison for assaulting three people and demolishing their car with an axe. He claims he was under the influence of drugs and admits he overreacted.

==NTM live==
NTM began to be known not only for their hard but conscious lyrics but for their stage presence during live events in the 1990s.

Already in their first big event in 1992 at the Zenith NTM came with a large number of dancers, back up singers, and slogans like &quot;fuck the police&quot; and lyrics like &quot;&quot;Le monde de demain&quot; which powerfully demanded change in modern society. Police surrounded the concert and several riots then ensued.

Throughout their career, two major live events have set France&#x27;s hip hop history and are for many French hip hop fans the best concerts there ever have been in hip hop music overall: NTM Live au Bataclan in 1996 and NTM Live au Zenith in 1998.

One of their most impressive songs played live was &quot;Qu&#x27;est ce qu&#x27;on attend...&quot;&quot;: &quot;What are we wating for.. to set everything on fire&quot; in which Joey Starr finishes the song with his lion-like voice by a now famous &quot;&quot;dorénavant la rue ne pardonne plus&quot;&quot; meaning &quot;henceforth the street no longer forgives.&quot; This song was accused among others by some politicians to have contributed in unleashing the social riots that France has known in October 2005

In January 2008, a newspaper (&quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot;) has announced the possible return of NTM on stage. Both singers have indeed said, that even if they have no intention of reforming (they haven&#x27;t spoken for eight years now), a live event is not out of the question. Many interviews done this last month caused huge buzz in France and many now think that the live event might be held at the Stade de France (France&#x27;s biggest stadium), where NTM was supposed to do a concert in 1999 but was canceled since the group already had been separated.

It was confirmed on the 12 March 2008, that NTM would be back for three concerts at Bercy. Tickets went on sale on the 15 of March and sold out in 30 minutes.

==Collaborations==
NTM has collaborated with a number of international artists.
NTM collaborates with Nas for a song called Affirmative Action. This is a cross continental, cross cultural attack of the racially stratified status quo. (It is one of many trans-atlantic collaborations within the hip hop world. MC Solaar, IAM, Afro Jazz, Monsieur R, Booba, Assassin, and other French rappers also collaborated with famous American rappers ). Nas espouses messages of the corrupt nature of governmental agencies saying, &quot;Feds cost me 2 mil to get the system off me&quot;. This collaboration played an undeniable role in the elevation of NTM to the international stage, and in their ability to spread awareness of &quot;The condition of the black minority in France today and the bankruptcy of the African continent [which is] by no means a reflection of the continents worth and potential&quot;. Both contexts/rappers espouse the organization of a Mafiaesque counter governmental organization meant to empower the lower classes of the US and France in this song. NTM collaborated with Lord Kossity from Martinique to create a track that mixed rap with dancehall. The song, titled &quot;Ma Benz&quot; appeared on NTM&#x27;s 1998 self-titled album. NTM&#x27;s established success helped to boost Lord Kossity&#x27;s popularity.

<text>There are 87 counties in the U.S. state of Minnesota. There are also several historical counties.

On October 27, 1849, nine counties were established: Benton, Dahkotah, Itasca, Ramsey, Mahkahta, Pembina, Wabasha, Washington, and Wahnata. Six of these names still exist. With the foundation of Kittson County on March 9, 1878, Pembina County no longer existed. When Minnesota was organized as a state, 57 of the present 87 counties were established. The last county to be created was Lake of the Woods County in 1923.

The names of many of the counties allude to the long history of exploration. Over ten counties are named for Native American groups residing in parts of what is now Minnesota. Another fifteen counties are named after physical geographic features, and the remainder for politicians.

The FIPS county code is the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the United States. The three-digit number is unique to each individual county within a state, but to be unique within the entire United States, it must be prefixed by the state code. This means that, for example, the number 001 is shared by Aitkin County, Minnesota, Adams County, Wisconsin, and Adair County, Iowa. To uniquely identify Aitkin County, Minnesota, one must use the state code of 27 plus the county code of 001; therefore, the unique nationwide identifier for Aitkin County, Minnesota is 27001. The links in the column FIPS County Code are to the Census Bureau Info page for that county.

<text>A two-stroke (or two-stroke cycle) engine is a type of internal combustion engine that completes a power cycle with two strokes of the piston (one up and one down movement) in one revolution of the crankshaft in contrast to a four-stroke engine which requires four strokes of the piston in two crankshaft revolutions to complete a power cycle. During the stroke from bottom dead center to top dead center, the end of the exhaust/intake (or scavenging) is completed along with the compression of the mixture. The second stroke encompasses the combustion of the mixture, the expansion of the burnt mixture and, near bottom dead center, the beginning of the scavenging flows.

Two-stroke engines often have a higher power-to-weight ratio than a four-stroke engine, since their power stroke occurs twice as often. Two-stroke engines can also have fewer moving parts, and thus be cheaper to manufacture and weigh less. In countries and regions with stringent emissions regulation, two-stroke engines have been phased out in automotive and motorcycle uses. In regions where regulations are less stringent, small displacement two-stroke engines remain popular in mopeds and motorcycles. They are also used in power tools such as chainsaws and leaf blowers. SSG and SLG glider planes are frequently equipped with two-stroke engines.

== History ==
The first commercial two-stroke engine involving cylinder compression is attributed to Scottish engineer Dugald Clerk, who patented his design in 1881. However, unlike most later two-stroke engines, his had a separate charging cylinder. The crankcase-scavenged engine, employing the area below the piston as a charging pump, is generally credited to Englishman Joseph Day. On 31 December 1879, German inventor Karl Benz produced a two-stroke gas engine, for which he received a patent in 1880 in Germany. The first truly practical two-stroke engine is attributed to Yorkshireman Alfred Angas Scott, who started producing twin-cylinder water-cooled motorcycles in 1908.

Two-stroke gasoline engines with electrical spark ignition are particularly useful in lightweight or portable applications such as chainsaws and motorcycles. However, when weight and size are not an issue, the cycle&#x27;s potential for high thermodynamic efficiency makes it ideal for diesel compression ignition engines operating in large, weight-insensitive applications, such as marine propulsion, railway locomotives, and electricity generation. In a two-stroke engine, the exhaust gases transfer less heat to the cooling system than a four-stroke, which means more energy to drive the piston, and if present, a turbocharger.

== Emissions ==
Crankcase-compression two-stroke engines, such as common small gasoline-powered engines, are lubricated by a petroil mixture in a total-loss system. Oil is mixed in with their petrol fuel beforehand, in a fuel-to-oil ratio of around 32:1. This oil then forms emissions, either by being burned in the engine or as droplets in the exhaust, historically resulting in more exhaust emissions, particularly hydrocarbons, than four-stroke engines of comparable power output. The combined opening time of the intake and exhaust ports in some two-stroke designs can also allow some amount of unburned fuel vapors to exit in the exhaust stream. The high combustion temperatures of small, air-cooled engines may also produce NOx emissions.

==Applications==


Two-stroke gasoline engines are preferred when mechanical simplicity, light weight, and high power-to-weight ratio are design priorities. By mixing oil with fuel, they can operate in any orientation as the oil reservoir does not depend on gravity.
A number of mainstream automobile manufacturers have used two-stroke engines in the past, including the Swedish Saab, German manufacturers DKW, Auto-Union, VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau, VEB Automobilwerk Eisenach, and VEB Fahrzeug- und Jagdwaffenwerk, and Polish manufacturers FSO and FSM. The Japanese manufacturers Suzuki and Subaru did the same in the 1970s. Production of two-stroke cars ended in the 1980s in the West, due to increasingly stringent regulation of air pollution. Eastern Bloc countries continued until around 1991, with the Trabant and Wartburg in East Germany.

Two-stroke engines are still found in a variety of small propulsion applications, such as outboard motors, small on- and off-road motorcycles, mopeds, motor scooters, motorized bicycles, tuk-tuks, snowmobiles, go-karts, RC cars, ultralight and model airplanes. Particularly in developed countries, pollution regulations have meant that their use for many of these applications is being phased out. Honda, for instance, ceased selling two-stroke off-road motorcycles in the United States in 2007, after abandoning road-going models considerably earlier.

Due to their high power-to-weight ratio and ability to be used in any orientation, two-stroke engines are common in handheld outdoor power tools including leaf blowers, chainsaws, and string trimmers.

Two-stroke diesel engines are found mostly in large industrial and marine applications, as well as some trucks and heavy machinery.

==Designs==

Although the principles remain the same, the mechanical details of various two-stroke engines differ depending on the type. The design types vary according to the method of introducing the charge to the cylinder, the method of scavenging the cylinder (exchanging burnt exhaust for fresh mixture) and the method of exhausting the cylinder.

===Inlet port variations===
====Piston-controlled inlet port====
Piston port is the simplest of the designs and the most common in small two-stroke engines. All functions are controlled solely by the piston covering and uncovering the ports as it moves up and down in the cylinder. In the 1970s, Yamaha worked out some basic principles for this system. They found that, in general, widening an exhaust port increases the power by the same amount as raising the port, but the power band does not narrow as it does when the port is raised. However, a mechanical limit exists to the width of a single exhaust port, at about 62% of the bore diameter for reasonable piston ring life. Beyond this, the piston rings bulge into the exhaust port and wear quickly. A maximum 70% of bore width is possible in racing engines, where rings are changed every few races. Intake duration is between 120 and 160°. Transfer port time is set at a minimum of 26°. The strong, low-pressure pulse of a racing two-stroke expansion chamber can drop the pressure to -7 psi when the piston is at bottom dead center, and the transfer ports nearly wide open. One of the reasons for high fuel consumption in two-strokes is that some of the incoming pressurized fuel-air mixture is forced across the top of the piston, where it has a cooling action, and straight out the exhaust pipe. An expansion chamber with a strong reverse pulse stops this outgoing flow.

A fundamental difference from typical four-stroke engines is that the two-stroke&#x27;s crankcase is sealed and forms part of the induction process in gasoline and hot-bulb engines. Diesel two-strokes often add a Roots blower or piston pump for scavenging.

====Reed inlet valve====
The reed valve is a simple but highly effective form of check valve commonly fitted in the intake tract of the piston-controlled port. It allows asymmetric intake of the fuel charge, improving power and economy, while widening the power band. Such valves are widely used in motorcycle, ATV, and marine outboard engines.

====Rotary inlet valve====
The intake pathway is opened and closed by a rotating member. A familiar type sometimes seen on small motorcycles is a slotted disk attached to the crankshaft, which covers and uncovers an opening in the end of the crankcase, allowing charge to enter during one portion of the cycle (called a disc valve).

Another form of rotary inlet valve used on two-stroke engines employs two cylindrical members with suitable cutouts arranged to rotate one within the other - the inlet pipe having passage to the crankcase only when the two cutouts coincide. The crankshaft itself may form one of the members, as in most glow-plug model engines. In another version, the crank disc is arranged to be a close-clearance fit in the crankcase, and is provided with a cutout that lines up with an inlet passage in the crankcase wall at the appropriate time, as in Vespa motor scooters.

The advantage of a rotary valve is that it enables the two-stroke engine&#x27;s intake timing to be asymmetrical, which is not possible with piston-port type engines. The piston-port type engine&#x27;s intake timing opens and closes before and after top dead center at the same crank angle, making it symmetrical, whereas the rotary valve allows the opening to begin and close earlier.

Rotary valve engines can be tailored to deliver power over a wider speed range or higher power over a narrower speed range than either a piston-port or reed-valve engine. Where a portion of the rotary valve is a portion of the crankcase itself, of particular importance, no wear should be allowed to take place.

===Scavenging variations===
====Cross-flow scavenging====

In a cross-flow engine, the transfer and exhaust ports are on opposite sides of the cylinder, and a deflector on the top of the piston directs the fresh intake charge into the upper part of the cylinder, pushing the residual exhaust gas down the other side of the deflector and out the exhaust port. The deflector increases the piston&#x27;s weight and exposed surface area, and the fact that it makes piston cooling and achieving an effective combustion chamber shape more difficult is why this design has been largely superseded by uniflow scavenging after the 1960s, especially for motorcycles, but for smaller or slower engines using direct injection, the deflector piston can still be an acceptable approach.

====Loop scavenging====
This method of scavenging uses carefully shaped and positioned transfer ports to direct the flow of fresh mixture toward the combustion chamber as it enters the cylinder. The fuel/air mixture strikes the cylinder head, then follows the curvature of the combustion chamber, and then is deflected downward.

This not only prevents the fuel/air mixture from traveling directly out the exhaust port, but also creates a swirling turbulence which improves combustion efficiency, power, and economy. 
Usually, a piston deflector is not required, so this approach has a distinct advantage over the cross-flow scheme (above).

Often referred to as &quot;Schnuerle&quot; (or &quot;Schnürle&quot;) loop scavenging after Adolf Schnürle, the German inventor of an early form in the mid-1920s, it became widely adopted in Germany during the 1930s and spread further afield after World War II.

Loop scavenging is the most common type of fuel/air mixture transfer used on modern two-stroke engines. Suzuki was one of the first manufacturers outside of Europe to adopt loop-scavenged, two-stroke engines. This operational feature was used in conjunction with the expansion chamber exhaust developed by German motorcycle manufacturer, MZ, and Walter Kaaden.

Loop scavenging, disc valves, and expansion chambers worked in a highly coordinated way to significantly increase the power output of two-stroke engines, particularly from the Japanese manufacturers Suzuki, Yamaha, and Kawasaki. Suzuki and Yamaha enjoyed success in Grand Prix motorcycle racing in the 1960s due in no small way to the increased power afforded by loop scavenging.

An additional benefit of loop scavenging was the piston could be made nearly flat or slightly domed, which allowed the piston to be appreciably lighter and stronger, and consequently to tolerate higher engine speeds. The &quot;flat top&quot; piston also has better thermal properties and is less prone to uneven heating, expansion, piston seizures, dimensional changes, and compression losses.

SAAB built 750- and 850-cc three-cylinder engines based on a DKW design that proved reasonably successful employing loop charging. The original SAAB 92 had a two-cylinder engine of comparatively low efficiency. At cruising speed, reflected-wave, exhaust-port blocking occurred at too low a frequency. Using the asymmetrical three-port exhaust manifold employed in the identical DKW engine improved fuel economy.

The 750-cc standard engine produced 36 to 42 hp, depending on the model year. The Monte Carlo Rally variant, 750-cc (with a filled crankshaft for higher base compression), generated 65 hp. An 850-cc version was available in the 1966 SAAB Sport (a standard trim model in comparison to the deluxe trim of the Monte Carlo).
Base compression comprises a portion of the overall compression ratio of a two-stroke engine.
Work published at SAE in 2012 points that loop scavenging is under every circumstance more efficient than cross-flow scavenging.

====Uniflow scavenging====


In a uniflow engine, the mixture, or &quot;charge air&quot; in the case of a diesel, enters at one end of the cylinder controlled by the piston and the exhaust exits at the other end controlled by an exhaust valve or piston. The scavenging gas-flow is, therefore, in one direction only, hence the name uniflow.

The design using exhaust valve(s) is common in on-road, off-road, and stationary two-stroke engines (Detroit Diesel), certain small marine two-stroke engines (Gray Marine Motor Company, which adapted the Detroit Diesel Series 71 for marine use), certain railroad two-stroke diesel locomotives (Electro-Motive Diesel) and large marine two-stroke main propulsion engines (Wärtsilä). Ported types are represented by the opposed piston design in which two pistons are in each cylinder, working in opposite directions such as the Junkers Jumo 205 and Napier Deltic. The once-popular split-single design falls into this class, being effectively a folded uniflow. With advanced-angle exhaust timing, uniflow engines can be supercharged with a crankshaft-driven blower, either piston or Roots-type.

===Stepped piston engine===
The piston of this engine is &quot;top-hat&quot;-shaped; the upper section forms the regular cylinder, and the lower section performs a scavenging function. The units run in pairs, with the lower half of one piston charging an adjacent combustion chamber.

The upper section of the piston still relies on total-loss lubrication, but the other engine parts are sump lubricated with cleanliness and reliability benefits. The mass of the piston is only about 20% more than a loop-scavenged engine&#x27;s piston because skirt thicknesses can be less.

==Power-valve systems==
Many modern two-stroke engines employ a power-valve system. The valves are normally in or around the exhaust ports. They work in one of two ways; either they alter the exhaust port by closing off the top part of the port, which alters port timing, such as Rotax R.A.V.E, Yamaha YPVS, Honda RC-Valve, Kawasaki K.I.P.S., Cagiva C.T.S., or Suzuki AETC systems, or by altering the volume of the exhaust, which changes the resonant frequency of the expansion chamber, such as the Suzuki SAEC and Honda V-TACS system. The result is an engine with better low-speed power without sacrificing high-speed power. However, as power valves are in the hot gas flow, they need regular maintenance to perform well.

==Direct injection==

Direct injection has considerable advantages in two-stroke engines. In carburetted two-strokes, a major problem is a portion of the fuel/air mixture going directly out, unburned, through the exhaust port, and direct injection effectively eliminates this problem. Two systems are in use: low-pressure air-assisted injection and high-pressure injection.

Since the fuel does not pass through the crankcase, a separate source of lubrication is needed.

==Two-stroke reversibility==
For the purpose of this discussion, it is convenient to think in motorcycle terms, where the exhaust pipe faces into the cooling air stream, and the crankshaft commonly spins in the same axis and direction as do the wheels i.e. &quot;forward&quot;. Some of the considerations discussed here apply to four-stroke engines (which cannot reverse their direction of rotation without considerable modification), almost all of which spin forward, too. It is also useful to note that the &quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot; faces of the piston are - respectively - the exhaust port and intake port sides of it, and are not to do with the top or bottom of the piston.

Regular gasoline two-stroke engines can run backward for short periods and under light load with little problem, and this has been used to provide a reversing facility in microcars, such as the Messerschmitt KR200, that lacked reverse gearing. Where the vehicle has electric starting, the motor is turned off and restarted backward by turning the key in the opposite direction. Two-stroke golf carts have used a similar system. Traditional flywheel magnetos (using contact-breaker points, but no external coil) worked equally well in reverse because the cam controlling the points is symmetrical, breaking contact before top dead center equally well whether running forward or backward. Reed-valve engines run backward just as well as piston-controlled porting, though rotary valve engines have asymmetrical inlet timing and do not run very well.

Serious disadvantages exist for running many engines backward under load for any length of time, and some of these reasons are general, applying equally to both two-stroke and four-stroke engines. This disadvantage is accepted in most cases where cost, weight, and size are major considerations. The problem comes about because in &quot;forward&quot; running, the major thrust face of the piston is on the back face of the cylinder, which in a two-stroke particularly, is the coolest and best-lubricated part. The forward face of the piston in a trunk engine is less well-suited to be the major thrust face, since it covers and uncovers the exhaust port in the cylinder, the hottest part of the engine, where piston lubrication is at its most marginal. The front face of the piston is also more vulnerable since the exhaust port, the largest in the engine, is in the front wall of the cylinder. Piston skirts and rings risk being extruded into this port, so having them pressing hardest on the opposite wall (where there are only the transfer ports in a crossflow engine) is always best and support is good. In some engines, the small end is offset to reduce thrust in the intended rotational direction and the forward face of the piston has been made thinner and lighter to compensate, but when running backward, this weaker forward face suffers increased mechanical stress it was not designed to resist. This can be avoided by the use of crossheads and also using thrust bearings to isolate the engine from end loads.

Large two-stroke ship diesels are sometimes made to be reversible. Like four-stroke ship engines (some of which are also reversible), they use mechanically operated valves, so require additional camshaft mechanisms. These engines use crossheads to eliminate sidethrust on the piston and isolate the under-piston space from the crankcase.

On top of other considerations, the oil pump of a modern two-stroke may not work in reverse, in which case the engine suffers oil starvation within a short time. Running a motorcycle engine backward is relatively easy to initiate, and in rare cases, can be triggered by a back-fire. It is not advisable.

Model airplane engines with reed valves can be mounted in either tractor or pusher configuration without needing to change the propeller. These motors are compression ignition, so no ignition timing issues and little difference between running forward and running backward are seen.

<doc id="82157" wikidata="Q1161678" url="?curid=82157" title="List of counties in New Jersey">
<text>There are 21 counties in the U.S. state of New Jersey. These counties together contain 564 municipalities, or administrative entities composed of clearly defined territory; 253 boroughs, 52 cities, 15 towns, 240 townships, and 4 villages. In New Jersey, a county is a local level of government between the state and municipalities. County government in New Jersey includes a Board of County Commissioners, sheriff, clerk, and surrogate (responsible for uncontested and routine probate), all of which are elected officials. Counties organized under the Optional County Charter Law may also have an elected county executive. Counties traditionally perform state-mandated duties such as the maintenance of jails, parks, and certain roads. The site of a county&#x27;s administration and courts is called the county seat.

==History==

New Jersey was governed by two groups of proprietors as two distinct provinces, East Jersey and West Jersey, between 1674 and 1702. New Jersey&#x27;s first counties were created as administrative districts within each province, with East Jersey split in 1675 into Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Monmouth counties, while West Jersey&#x27;s initial counties of Burlington and Salem date to 1681. The most recent county created in New Jersey is Union County, created in 1857 and named after the union of the United States when the Civil War was imminent. New Jersey&#x27;s county names derive from several sources, though most of its counties are named after place names in England and prominent leaders in the colonial and revolutionary periods. Bergen County is the most populous county—as of the 2010 Census—with 905,116 people, while Salem County is the least populous with 66,083 people.

==New Jersey legislature representation==
Until the 1960s, the New Jersey Senate had 21 representatives, one from each county regardless of population. In the wake of the 1964 decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot;, establishing the one man, one vote principle that state legislative districts must be approximately equal in size, David Friedland filed suit in New Jersey Supreme Court on behalf of two union leaders, challenging a system under which each county was represented by a single member in the New Jersey Senate. The court ruled unanimously that the existing system was unconstitutional, ordered that interim measures be established by statute for the 1965 legislative elections, and ordered that the needed constitutional changes to restructure the New Jersey Legislature to be in compliance with &quot;one man, one vote&quot; requirements be in place before elections took place in 1967. The senate unilaterally—by internal rule, not by statute—enacted a proposal whereby each senator&#x27;s vote would be weighted based on the population of the county represented, under which Cape May County&#x27;s senator would receive one vote while the senator from Essex County would receive 19.1 votes, in direct relation to the ratio of residents between counties. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that it was unconstitutional for the senate to adopt a weighted voting system unilaterally. In 1966, the constitution was amended to establish 40 districts statewide, each represented by one senator and two assembly members, without relation to county boundaries.

==FIPS code==

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry. FIPS codes are five-digit numbers; for New Jersey the codes start with 34 and are completed with the three-digit county code. The FIPS code for each county in the table links to census data for that county.

<doc id="82159" wikidata="Q762726" url="?curid=82159" title="List of counties in New York">
<text>There are 62 counties in the U.S. state of New York.

The first 12 counties were created in 1683 soon after the British took over the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam; two of these counties were later abolished, their land going to Massachusetts. These counties were carried over after independence in 1783, but most of the counties were created by the state in the 19th century. The newest county is the Bronx, created in 1914 from the portions of New York County that had been annexed from Westchester County in the late 19th century. New York&#x27;s counties are named for various Native American words; British provinces, counties, cities, and royalty; early American statesmen and military personnel; and New York State politicians.

==Authority==
Excepting the five boroughs of New York City, New York counties are governed by New York County Law and have governments run by either a Board of Supervisors or a County Legislature, and either an elected County Executive or appointed county manager. Counties without charters are run by a Board of Supervisors, in which Town Supervisors from towns within the county also sit on the county Board of Supervisors. For counties with a charter, the executives generally have powers to veto acts of the county legislature. The legislatures have powers of setting policies, levying taxes and distributing funds.

Throughout the state, including NYC, the court system and public prosecution is primarily a matter of state law but is generally organized along county lines, chosen by county voters.

==Five boroughs of New York City==

Five of New York&#x27;s counties are each coextensive with New York City&#x27;s five boroughs. They are New York County (Manhattan), Kings County (Brooklyn), Bronx County (The Bronx), Richmond County (Staten Island), and Queens County (Queens). They are the smallest counties in New York by area.

In contrast to other counties of New York, the powers of the five boroughs of New York City are very limited and in nearly all respects are governed by the city government. Some officials are elected on a borough-wide basis, the five borough presidents deal with Borough matters, while the district attorneys, and all county and state supreme court judges are generally concerned with the administration of state criminal and civil law and local ordinances in the county. There are no official county seats, but the locations of borough halls and courthouses bestow certain neighborhoods an informal designation as county seats within their boroughs:

* The Bronx County Courthouse and the borough&#x27;s main post office are located in the Concourse section of the Bronx. The separate Bronx Borough Hall burned down in 1969.
* Brooklyn Borough Hall, the Federal Building and Post Office, and county Supreme Court are in Downtown Brooklyn.
* The Municipal Building, where the Manhattan Borough President&#x27;s office is located, and most courthouses are in the downtown Civic Center. The General Post Office is in Midtown Manhattan.
* Queens Borough Hall and a courthouse are in Kew Gardens. Another major courthouse, post office, and the Long Island Railroad hub are in Jamaica. Queens also has general post offices in Flushing, Long Island City and Far Rockaway.
* Staten Island Borough Hall, three courthouses, and the St. George Terminal transportation hub are in the St. George neighborhood.

<text>Hill County is a county located in the U.S. state of Montana. As of the 2020 census, the population was 16,309. Its county seat is Havre. It lies along the United States border with Canada, abutting Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Part of its territory is within the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation, which is held by the federally recognized Chippewa-Cree Tribe.

==History==
The first European-American settlement in the future county area was Fort Assinniboine, garrisoned by the United States Army in 1879. Fifteen of the original 104 structures from the fort are still standing. A portion of the fort was ceded for use as the Indian reservation, which was established in 1916.

The county is named after James J. Hill, president of the Great Northern Railway Company, which built the rail line across Montana as part of the Transcontinental Railroad to the Pacific coast.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.6%) is water.

Hill County is on the &quot;Hi-Line&quot; in north-central Montana. It borders Blaine County to the east, Liberty County to the west, and Canada to the north. Hill County contains Beaver Creek Park, the nation&#x27;s largest county park.

It is one of the few locations in the United States to have an antipodal point on land, and its community of Rudyard is the only populated such place. The Kerguelen Islands are on the opposite side of the earth from parts of Hill County, while the antipodal points of almost all other places in the United States lie in the Indian Ocean.

==Politics==
In presidential elections, Hill County is a swing county. Since 1952, it has voted for the Democratic nominee nine times and the Republican nominee nine times and the nationwide winner from 1992 to 2016. The rural parts of the county vote heavily Republican, and the city of Havre is also majority Republican. However, the Rocky Boy&#x27;s Reservation in the southeastern part of the county is a Democratic stronghold, having voted by as much as 84% Democratic in 2024 (down from 93% in 2020). This leads the county to be less Republican overall than multiple neighboring counties. The county swung heavily to support Barack Obama in 2008 and ever since then the county has seen a steady Republican trend. Donald Trump, who swung the county back into the Republican column in 2016, showed the strongest performance by any Republican candidate in the county&#x27;s history in 2024 when he received over 56% of the vote.

<doc id="82161" wikidata="Q204146" url="?curid=82161" title="Hermaphroditus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Hermaphroditus (; , ) was a child of Aphrodite and Hermes. According to Ovid, he was born a remarkably beautiful boy whom the naiad Salmacis attempted to rape and prayed to be united with forever. A god, in answer to her prayer, merged their two forms into one and transformed him into a hermaphrodite, he being considered the origin of the name. His name is compounded of his parents&#x27; names, Hermes and Aphrodite. He was one of the Erotes.

Because Hermaphroditus was a child of Hermes, and consequently a great-grandchild of Atlas (Hermes&#x27;s mother Maia was the daughter of Atlas), he is sometimes called Atlantiades ().

==Symbolism==

Hermaphroditus, the two-sexed child of Aphrodite and Hermes (Venus and Mercury), had long been a symbol of androgyny or effeminacy, and was portrayed in Greco-Roman art as a female figure with male genitals.

Theophrastus&#x27;s account also suggests a link between Hermaphroditus and the institution of marriage. The reference to the fourth day of the month is telling: this is the luckiest day to have a wedding. association with marriage seems to have been that, by embodying both masculine and feminine qualities, he symbolized the coming together of men and women in sacred union. Another factor linking Hermaphroditus to weddings was his parents&#x27; role in protecting and blessing brides.

Hermaphroditus&#x27;s name is derived from those of their parents Hermes and Aphrodite. All three of these gods figure largely among erotic and fertility figures, and all possess distinctly sexual overtones. Sometimes, Hermaphroditus is referred to as Aphroditus.

==Mythology==

Ovid&#x27;s account relates that Hermaphroditus was nursed by naiads in the caves of Mount Ida, a sacred mountain in Phrygia (present day Turkey). At the age of fifteen, he grew bored with his surroundings and traveled to the cities of Lycia and Caria. It was in the woods of Caria, near Halicarnassus (modern Bodrum, Turkey) that he encountered the nymph Salmacis, in her pool. She was overcome by lust for the boy, who was very beautiful but still young, and tried to flirt with him, but was rejected. When he thought she had left, Hermaphroditus undressed and entered the waters of the empty pool. Salmacis sprang out from behind a tree and jumped into the pool. She wrapped herself around the youth, forcibly kissing him and touching his breast, attempting to rape him. While he struggled, she called out to the gods that they should never part. Her wish was granted, and their bodies blended into one form, &quot;a creature of both sexes&quot;. Hermaphroditus prayed to Hermes and Aphrodite that anyone else who bathed in the pool would be similarly transformed, and his wish was granted.

Hungarian classical philologist Károly Kerényi wrote: &quot;In this form the story was certainly not ancient&quot;. He related it to the Greek myths involving male youths (&quot;ephebes&quot;), noting the legends of Narcissus and Hyacinth, who had archaic hero-cults, and also those involving Hymen (Hymenaios).

Diodorus Siculus, in his work &quot;Library of History&quot;, mentions that some say that Hermaphroditus is a god and appears at certain times among men, but there are some who declare that such creatures of two sexes are monstrosities, and coming rarely into the world as they do have the quality of presaging the future, sometimes for evil and sometimes for good.

In a description found on the remains of a wall in Halicarnassus, Hermaphroditus&#x27; mother, Aphrodite, names Salmacis as the nymph who nursed and took care of an infant Hermaphroditus after being placed in her care, a very different version than the one presented by Ovid.

The satirical author Lucian of Samosata also implies that Hermaphroditus was born like that, rather than becoming later in life against his will, and blames it on the identity of the child&#x27;s father, Hermes.

==Cult and worship==
The oldest traces of the cult in Greek countries are found in Cyprus. Here, according to Macrobius (&quot;Saturnalia&quot;, iii. 8), there was a bearded statue of a male Aphrodite, called Aphroditus by Aristophanes. Philochorus in his &quot;Atthis&quot; (ap. Macrobius &quot;loc. cit.&quot;) further identified this divinity, at whose sacrifices men and women exchanged garments, with the Moon. A terracotta plaque from the 7th century BC depicting Aphroditos, which was found in Perachora, suggests it was an archaic Greek cult.

The deification and the origins of the cult of Hermaphroditus beings stem from Eastern religions, where the hermaphrodite nature expressed the idea of a primitive being that united both sexes. This double sex also attributed to Dionysus and Priapus – the union in one being of the two principles of generation and conception – denotes extensive fertilizing and productive powers.

This Cyprian Aphrodite is the same as the later Hermaphroditos, which simply means Aphroditos in the form of a herma, and first occurs in the &quot;Characters&quot; (16) of Theophrastus. After its introduction at Athens (probably in the 5th century BC), the importance of this deity seems to have declined. It appears no longer as the object of a special cult, but limited to the homage of certain sects, expressed by superstitious rites of obscure significance.

We find in Alciphron that there was at Athens a temple of Hermaphroditus. The passage proposes that he might be considered as the deity who presided over married people; the strict union between husband and wife being aptly represented by a deity, who was male and female inseparably blended together.

In &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;, at the chapter in which describe the statues in the Baths of Zeuxippus, it also mentions and describes a statue of Hermaphroditus.

==Literature==
The earliest mention of Hermaphroditus in Greek literature is by the philosopher Theophrastus (3rd century BC), in his book &quot;The Characters&quot;, XVI The Superstitious Man, in which he portrays various types of eccentric people.

The first mention of Hermes and Aphrodite as Hermaphroditus&#x27;s parents was by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC) in his book &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot;, book IV, 4.6.5.

The only full narration of his myth is that of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, IV.274–388 (8 AD), where the emphasis is on the feminine snares of the lascivious water-nymph Salmacis and her compromising of Hermaphroditus&#x27; erstwhile budding manly strength, detailing his bashfulness and the engrafting of their bodies.

A rendering of the story into an &quot;epyllion&quot;, published anonymously in 1602, was later (1640) attributed by some to Francis Beaumont.

Ausonius, in his &quot;Epigramata de diversis rebus / Epigrams on various matters&quot; (4th century), also tells of Hermaphroditus&#x27; parentage and union with the nymph Salmacis.

In the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot;, IX.783 (980 AD), there is a reference to a sculpture of Hermaphroditus which was placed in a bath for both sexes. The passage IX.317 is in dialogue form, based on the dialogue between Hermaphroditus and Silenus. The latter claims that he has had sexual intercourse with Hermaphroditus three times. Hermaphroditus complains and objects to the fact by invoking Hermes in an oath, while Silenus invokes Pan for the reliability of his allegations.

Algernon Charles Swinburne&#x27;s poem &quot;&quot; in &quot;Poems and Ballads&quot; is subscribed &quot;Au Musée du Louvre, Mars 1863&quot;, leaving no doubt that it was the Borghese Hermaphroditus that had inspired his ode.

<doc id="82162" wikidata="Q828579" url="?curid=82162" title="Salmacis">
<text>Salmacis () was an atypical Naiad nymph of Greek mythology. She rejected the ways of the virginal Greek goddess Artemis in favour of vanity and idleness.

== Mythology ==
=== Ovid&#x27;s version ===
Salmacis&#x27; attempted rape of Hermaphroditus is narrated in the fourth book of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (see also Dercetis).

One day, Hermaphroditus went swimming in his pool. Upon seeing him, Salmacis was struck with love for him, approached him and confessed her love to him; but he was not interested, and demanded she leave. She did so, but her passion took her back, unable to stay away from him. As Hermaphroditus emerged from the pool, she threw herself at him, and forcibly kissed him as he tried to escape. Salmacis then cried to the gods and begged them to let them stay together forever; and the gods answered by fusing them together for all time, into a deity that had both male and female parts. She thus becomes one with Hermaphroditus and he curses the fountain to have the same effect on every other person who would bathe there.

=== Other versions ===
In a description found on the remains of a wall in Halicarnassus, Hermaphroditus&#x27; mother Aphrodite names Salmacis as the nymph who nursed and took care of an infant Hermaphroditus after his parents put him in her care, a very different version than the one presented by Ovid.

Lucian of Samosata also implies that Hermaphroditus was born like that, rather than becoming later in life against his will, and blames it on the identity of the boy&#x27;s father Hermes.

== Salmacis fountain ==

Salmacis was the name of a fountain or spring located in modern-day Bodrum, Turkey. According to some classical authors, the water had the reputation of making men effeminate and soft. This legend lies at the heart of Ovid&#x27;s tale of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus.

== Ancient art ==
A fresco in Room 10 of the &quot;Casa della Venere in Conchiglia&quot; (House of Venus in the Shell) in Pompeii depicts Eros standing in between Hermaphroditus and Salmacis. The fresco is possibly the earliest (before 79 AD) and the only ancient artwork of the water nymph before her union with Hermaphroditus.

== Post-Classical reception ==
=== Literature ===
Francis Beaumont, a poet and playwright, wrote a poem &quot;Salmacis and Hermaphroditus&quot; based on Ovid&#x27;s work. The poem was published anonymously in London in 1602.

Algernon Charles Swinburne&#x27;s 1863 poem &quot;Hermaphroditus&quot;, based on the Bernini sculpture of the same name in the Louvre, makes mention of Salmacis in the final stanza.

A novel of short stories by Italian writer Mario Soldati called &quot;Salmace&quot; (Salmacis), a title that spans the entire collection. In the story it tells of the transformation of a man into a woman, in a highly metaphorical context.

=== Sculpture ===
A sculpture by François-Joseph Bosio, &quot;La nymphe Salmacis&quot; from 1826, can be seen on display at the Louvre Museum in Paris.

A sculpture by Sir Thomas Brock of Salmacis (aka &quot;The Bather Surprised&quot;) was designed in 1868. It was modelled and exhibited at the Royal Academy, London in 1869. A variety of porcelain replicas were made from 1875 and an example was exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1878.

The &quot;Fontana Greca&quot; (&quot;Greek Fountain&quot;) is a fountain from the Renaissance period located in Gallipoli, southern Italy. The fountain has bas-reliefs depicting three metamorphoses in Greek mythology. The center bas-relief shows Eros flying beside Aphrodite, while Hermaphroditus and Salmacis are shown below laying together and embracing.

=== Painting ===
A painting of Salmacis in 1877 by French artist Charles Landelle was one of the most admired works at the Paris Exhibition according to The Art Journal of 1878. The painting depicts a startled Salmacis seated among reeds, clutching her drapery to her chest in alarm.

=== Music ===
The British progressive rock band Genesis wrote and performed a song entitled &quot;Fountain of Salmacis&quot; on their 1971 album &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;. It tells the story of Salmacis&#x27; attempted rape of Hermaphroditus. At the end of the song, the lyrics state that Salmacis and Hermaphroditus were &quot;joined as one&quot; and forever live beneath the lake from which the fountain appears.

<text>The Count of Monte Cristo () is an adventure novel by the French author Alexandre Dumas (&quot;père&quot;) serialized from 1844 to 1846. It is one of the author&#x27;s most popular works, along with &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and &quot;Man in the Iron Mask&quot;. Like many of his novels, it was expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter, Auguste Maquet.

The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815–1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis Philippe I. It begins on the day that Napoleon left his first island of exile, Elba, beginning the Hundred Days period of his return to power. The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story centrally concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness.

Before he can marry his fiancée Mercédès, Edmond Dantès, a French nineteen-year-old first mate of the merchant ship &quot;Pharaon&quot;, is falsely accused of treason, arrested, and imprisoned without trial in the Château d&#x27;If, a grim island fortress off Marseille. A fellow prisoner, Abbé Faria, correctly deduces that romantic rival Fernand Mondego, envious crewmate Danglars, and double-dealing magistrate De Villefort are responsible for his imprisonment. Over the course of their long imprisonment, Faria educates Dantès and, knowing himself close to death, inspires him to retrieve for himself a cache of treasure Faria had discovered. After Faria dies, Dantès escapes and finds the treasure. As the fabulously wealthy, powerful and mysterious Count of Monte Cristo, he enters the fashionable Parisian world of the 1830s to avenge himself.

The book is widely considered a literary classic today.

==Plot==

===Marseille and Château d&#x27;If===

On the day in 1815 when Napoleon escapes from Elba, Edmond Dantès sails the &quot;Pharaon&quot; into Marseille after the death of the captain, Leclère. The ship&#x27;s owner, Morrel, will make Dantès the next captain. On his deathbed, Leclère charged Dantès to deliver a package to General Bertrand (exiled with Napoleon), and a letter from Elba to a Bonapartist in Paris named Noirtier. 

Crewmate Danglars is jealous of Dantès&#x27;s rapid promotion. On the eve of Dantès&#x27;s wedding to his Catalan fiancée Mercédès, Danglars meets Fernand Mondego, Mercédès&#x27;s cousin and a rival for her affections, and Mondego and Danglars hatch a plot to anonymously accuse him of being a Bonapartist. Dantès&#x27;s neighbor, Caderousse, is present; he too is jealous of Dantès, but although he objects to the plot, he becomes too drunk to prevent it. 

On the day of his wedding, Dantès is arrested, but the cowardly Caderousse stays silent. Villefort, the deputy crown prosecutor in Marseille, is Noirtier&#x27;s son. Knowing that it would destroy his political career for it to be known that his father is a Bonapartist, he destroys the letter and silences Dantès by sentencing him without trial to life imprisonment.
After six years of solitary imprisonment in the Château d&#x27;If, Dantès is on the verge of suicide when another prisoner, the Abbé Faria, an Italian scholarly priest, digs an escape tunnel that by mistake ends in Dantès&#x27;s cell. The Abbé helps Dantès deduce the culprits of his imprisonment. Over the next eight years, Faria educates Dantès in languages, history, culture, mathematics, chemistry, medicine, and science. Knowing himself to be close to death from catalepsy and having grown fond of his pupil, Faria tells Dantès the location of a vast treasure hidden on the island of Monte Cristo.

On 28 February 1829, Faria dies. Dantès takes Faria&#x27;s body to his cell and takes its place in the burial sack. When he is thrown into the sea, Dantès cuts through the sack and swims to a nearby island, where, claiming to be a shipwrecked sailor, he is rescued by Genoese smugglers. Some months later, he locates and retrieves the treasure; he later purchases the island of Monte Cristo and the title of count from the Tuscan government.

Having sworn vengeance on Danglars, Mondego, and Villefort, Dantès returns to Marseille in search of information for his vengeance. Traveling as the Abbé Busoni, Dantès finds Caderousse, who regrets not intervening in Dantès&#x27;s arrest. Caderousse informs him that Mercédès eventually resigned herself to marrying Fernand, that Dantès&#x27;s father died of starvation, and that his old employer Morrel tried in vain to secure Dantès&#x27;s release and tend after his father in his absence, but is now on the brink of bankruptcy. Both Danglars and Fernand have prospered greatly. Danglars became a speculator, amassed a fortune, married a wealthy widow, and became a baron. Fernand served in the French Army, rising to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Dantès rewards Caderousse with a diamond. Later, Caderousse negotiates the sale of the diamond to a jeweler, but kills the jeweler to keep both the diamond and the money; he is eventually arrested and sentenced to the galleys.

To rescue Morrel from bankruptcy, Dantès poses as a banker, buys Morrel&#x27;s debts, and gives him three months&#x27; reprieve. At the end of the three months, Morrel is about to commit suicide when he learns that the debts have been mysteriously paid and that one of his lost ships has returned with a full cargo, secretly rebuilt and laden by Dantès.

===Revenge===
Dantès reappears nine years later, in 1838, as the mysterious, fabulously wealthy Count of Monte Cristo. Fernand is now the Count de Morcerf, Danglars a baron and banker, and Villefort a (&#x27;royal prosecutor&#x27;).

In Rome, at Carnival time, Dantès befriends Viscount Albert de Morcerf, the son of Mercédès and Fernand. He arranges for Albert to be captured by the bandit Luigi Vampa, and &quot;rescues&quot; the boy, earning his trust. Albert introduces the Count to Parisian high society. Dantès, in his guise as the Count, meets Mercédès for the first time in 23 years, and eventually makes the acquaintance of Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort. 

The Count purchases a home in Auteuil, a suburb of Paris. He has learned from his servant Bertuccio that it is the home in which Villefort once had an extramarital affair with Danglars&#x27;s wife, who gave birth to a child that Villefort buried alive in order to cover up the affair. The infant was rescued by Bertuccio, named Benedetto, and raised by Bertuccio&#x27;s sister Assunta, but Benedetto turned to a life of crime as a young man, murdered Assunta, and was sentenced to the galleys himself.

Having impressed Parisian society with his wealth and air of mystery, the Count begins setting up the pieces for his revenge. He persuades Danglars to extend him a credit of six million francs. He discusses the properties of various poisons with Villefort&#x27;s second wife Heloïse, and allows her to borrow some of his supply. He allows his ward, Haydée—the exiled daughter of Ali Pasha of Janina, whom Dantès purchased from slavery—to see Fernand, recognizing him as the man who betrayed and murdered her father and stole his fortune. Having freed Benedetto and Caderousse from the galleys (under the alias &quot;Lord Wilmore&quot;), he anonymously hires Benedetto to impersonate an Italian nobleman, &quot;Viscount Andrea Cavalcanti&quot;, and introduces him to Parisian society. He manipulates the financial markets by bribing a telegraph operator to transmit a false message, causing Danglars to lose hundreds of thousands of francs.

Meanwhile, Villefort&#x27;s daughter Valentine is engaged to marry Albert&#x27;s friend Franz, but is secretly in love with Morrel&#x27;s son Maximilien; Noirtier, her grandfather, induces Franz to break the engagement by revealing that Noirtier himself killed Franz&#x27;s father in a duel. Benedetto ingratiates himself to Danglars, who betroths his daughter Eugénie to him after canceling her engagement to Albert. Caderousse blackmails Benedetto, threatening to reveal his past if he does not share his newfound wealth. Heloïse begins poisoning members of Villefort&#x27;s family, intending to ensure that all of the family&#x27;s wealth will be inherited by her son Édouard, rather than her stepdaughter Valentine; Noirtier secretly begins dosing Valentine with a drug that will give her limited resistance to the poison.

Caderousse attempts to rob the Count&#x27;s house but is caught by &quot;Abbé Busoni&quot; and forced to write a letter to Danglars, exposing &quot;Cavalcanti&quot; as an impostor. When Caderousse leaves the estate, he is stabbed by Benedetto. Caderousse dictates a deathbed statement naming his killer, and the Count reveals his true identity to Caderousse before he dies.

The Count anonymously leaks to the newspapers Fernand&#x27;s betrayal of Ali Pasha, and at the Chamber of Peers&#x27; inquiry into the accusations Haydée testifies against him as an eyewitness. Albert blames the Count for his father&#x27;s downfall and challenges him to a duel. The Count is later visited by Mercédès, who had recognized him as Dantès upon their first meeting but chose not to say anything. Mercédès begs Dantès to spare her son. He tells her of the injustices inflicted on him, but agrees not to kill Albert. Realizing that Dantès intends to let Albert kill him, she reveals the truth to Albert, who makes a public apology to the Count. Albert and Mercédès disown Fernand, renounce their titles and wealth and depart to begin new lives. Albert enlists as a soldier, while Mercedes lives alone in Dantès&#x27;s old house in Marseilles. Fernand confronts the Count of Monte Cristo, who reveals his identity. Fernand shoots himself.
At the party to celebrate &quot;Cavalcanti&quot;&#x27;s engagement to Eugénie Danglars, the police arrive to arrest Benedetto for Caderousse&#x27;s murder. Benedetto flees, but is arrested and returned to Paris. Eugénie (who is implied to be a lesbian) also takes the opportunity to flee Paris with her girlfriend. 

Valentine barely survives Héloïse&#x27;s first attempt to poison her, and Maximilien begs the Count to protect her from the unknown poisoner. He does so by faking her death, making it appear that the poisoner succeeded. Villefort, deducing that Héloïse is the murderer, gives her a choice between the shame of a public trial and committing suicide in private, before leaving to prosecute Benedetto&#x27;s trial. At the trial, Benedetto reveals that he is Villefort&#x27;s son and was rescued after Villefort buried him alive, having learned the truth from Bertuccio. Villefort admits his guilt and rushes home to prevent his wife&#x27;s suicide but is too late; she is dead and has poisoned her son Édouard as well. The Count confronts Villefort, revealing his true identity, which drives Villefort insane. Dantès tries but fails to resuscitate Édouard, causing him to question if his revenge has gone too far.

As a result of the Count&#x27;s financial manipulations, Danglars is left with a ruined reputation and 5,000,000 francs he has been holding in deposit for hospitals. The Count demands this sum to fulfill their credit agreement, and Danglars embezzles the hospital fund. He flees to Italy with the Count&#x27;s receipt for the cash and 50,000 francs of his own, and is reimbursed the 5,000,000 francs from the Count&#x27;s own bank account. While leaving Rome, he is kidnapped by Luigi Vampa. The bandits extort Danglars&#x27;s ill-gotten gains out of him by forcing him to pay exorbitant prices for food and water; Dantès anonymously returns the money to the hospitals. Danglars finally repents of his crimes, and a softened Dantès forgives him and allows him to depart with his 50,000 francs.

===Resolution and return to the Orient===
Maximilien Morrel is driven to despair by Valentine&#x27;s apparent death and considers suicide. Dantès reveals his true identity and persuades Maximilien to delay his suicide for one month. One month later, on the island of Monte Cristo, he reunites Valentine with Maximilien and reveals the true sequence of events. Having found peace, Dantès leaves the couple part of his fortune on the island and departs for the East to begin a new life with Haydée, who has declared her love for him. The reader is left with a final line: &quot;l&#x27;humaine sagesse était tout entière dans ces deux mots: attendre et espérer!&quot; (&quot;all human wisdom is contained in these two words: &#x27;Wait and Hope&#x27;&quot;).

==Characters==
===Edmond Dantès and his aliases===
* Edmond Dantès (born 1796): A sailor with good prospects, engaged (1815) to Mercédès. After his transformation into the Count of Monte Cristo (1830s), he reveals his true name to his enemies as each revenge is completed. During the course of the novel, he falls in love with Haydée.
* The Count of Monte Cristo: The identity Dantès assumes when he emerges from prison and acquires his vast fortune. As a result, the Count of Monte Cristo is usually associated with a coldness and bitterness that come from an existence based solely on revenge. This character thinks of Lord Wilmore as a rival.
* Chief Clerk of the banking firm Thomson &amp; French, an Englishman.
* Lord Wilmore: An Englishman, and the persona in which Dantès performs random acts of generosity.
* Sinbad the Sailor: The persona that Dantès assumes when he saves the Morrel family and while conducting business with smugglers and brigands.

After acknowledging the truth of his father&#x27;s war crimes and the false accusation towards the sailor Edmond Dantès, he decides to leave his home with Mercédès and start a new life as a soldier under the name of &quot;Herrera&quot; (his mother&#x27;s maiden name), leaving for Africa in search of fortune and to bring new honor to his family name.

===Danglars family===
* Baron Danglars: Dantès&#x27;s jealous junior officer (1815) and mastermind behind his imprisonment, writing the letter of denunciation which Fernand mails. He is later (1830s) a wealthy banker, but goes bankrupt and is left with only 50,000 francs, after stealing 5,000,000 francs.

==Themes==
The Count of Monte Cristo explores key themes such as justice and vengeance, focusing on Edmond Dantès&#x27; quest for revenge against those who wronged him. This pursuit raises moral questions about the consequences of vengeance and its impact on both the avenger and the targets. The theme of hope is central, driving Dantès through his trials and symbolizing his belief in eventual redemption. Mercy and forgiveness are contrasted with vengeance, as Dantès grapples with the morality of his actions. Additionally, the novel touches on themes of fate, identity, and redemption, making it a complex exploration of human nature.

==Background to elements of the plot==
A short novel titled &quot;Georges&quot; by Dumas was published in 1843, before &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; was written. This novel is of particular interest to scholars because Dumas reused many of the ideas and plot devices in &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.

Dumas wrote that the germ of the idea of revenge as one theme in his novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; came from an anecdote (&quot;Le Diamant et la Vengeance&quot;) published in a memoir of incidents in France in 1838, written by an archivist of the Paris police. The archivist was Jacques Peuchet, and the multi-volume book was called &quot;Memoirs from the Archives of the Paris Police&quot; in English. Dumas included this essay in one of the editions of his novel published in 1846.

Peuchet related the tale of a shoemaker, Pierre Picaud, living in Nîmes in 1807, who was engaged to marry a rich woman when three jealous friends falsely accused him of being a spy on behalf of England in a period of wars between France and England. Picaud was placed under a form of house arrest in the Fenestrelle Fort, where he served as a servant to a rich Italian cleric. When the cleric died, he left his fortune to Picaud, whom he had begun to treat as a son. Picaud then spent years plotting his revenge on the three men who were responsible for his misfortune. He stabbed the first with a dagger on which the words &quot;Number One&quot; were printed, and then he poisoned the second. The third man&#x27;s son he lured into crime and his daughter into prostitution, finally stabbing the man himself. This third man, named Loupian, had married Picaud&#x27;s fiancée while Picaud was under arrest.

In another of the true stories reported by Ashton-Wolfe, Peuchet describes a poisoning in a family. This story is also mentioned in the Pléiade edition of this novel, and it probably served as a model for the chapter of the murders inside the Villefort family. The introduction to the Pléiade edition mentions other sources from real life: a man named Abbé Faria existed, was imprisoned but did not die in prison; he died in 1819 and left no large legacy to anyone. As for Dantès, his fate is quite different from his model in Peuchet&#x27;s book, since that model is murdered by the &quot;Caderousse&quot; of the plot.

==Publication==
&quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; was originally published in the &quot;Journal des Débats&quot; in eighteen parts. Serialization ran from 28 August 1844 to 15 January 1846. The first edition in book form was published in Paris by &quot;Pétion&quot; in 18 volumes with the first two issued in 1844 and the remaining sixteen in 1845. Most of the Belgian pirated editions, the first Paris edition and many others up to the &quot;Lécrivain et Toubon&quot; illustrated edition of 1860 feature a misspelling of the title with &quot;Christo&quot; used instead of &quot;Cristo&quot;. The first edition to feature the correct spelling was the &quot;L&#x27;Écho des Feuilletons&quot; illustrated edition, Paris 1846. This edition featured plates by Paul Gavarni and Tony Johannot and was said to be &quot;revised&quot; and &quot;corrected&quot;, although only the chapter structure appears to have been altered with an additional chapter entitled &quot;La Maison des Allées de Meilhan&quot; having been created by splitting &quot;Le Départ&quot; into two.
===English translations===

The first appearance of &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; in English was the first part of a serialization by W. Harrison Ainsworth in volume VII of &quot;Ainsworth&#x27;s Magazine&quot; published in 1845, although this was an abridged summary of the first part of the novel only and was entitled &quot;The Prisoner of If&quot;. Ainsworth translated the remaining chapters of the novel, again in abridged form, and issued these in volumes VIII and IX of the magazine in 1845 and 1846 respectively. Another abridged serialization appeared in &quot;The London Journal&quot; between 1846 and 1847.

The first single volume translation in English was an abridged edition with woodcuts published by Geo Pierce in January 1846 entitled &quot;The Prisoner of If or The Revenge of Monte Christo&quot;.

In April 1846, volume three of the &quot;Parlour Novelist&quot;, Belfast, Ireland: Simms and M&#x27;Intyre, London: W S Orr and Company, featured the first part of an unabridged translation of the novel by Emma Hardy. The remaining two parts would be issued as the Count of Monte Christo volumes I and II in volumes 8 and 9 of the Parlour Novelist respectively.

The most common English translation is an anonymous one originally published in 1846 by Chapman and Hall. This was originally released in ten weekly installments from March 1846 with six pages of letterpress and two illustrations by M Valentin. The translation was released in book form with all twenty illustrations in two volumes in May 1846, a month after the release of the first part of the above-mentioned translation by Emma Hardy. The translation follows the revised French edition of 1846, with the correct spelling of &quot;Cristo&quot; and the extra chapter &quot;The House on the Allées de Meilhan&quot;.

Most English editions of the novel follow the anonymous translation. In 1889, two of the major American publishers &quot;Little Brown&quot; and &quot;T.Y. Crowell&quot; updated the translation, correcting mistakes and revising the text to reflect the original serialized version. This resulted in the removal of the chapter
&quot;The House on the Allées de Meilhan&quot;, with the text restored to the end of the chapter called &quot;The Departure&quot;.

In 1955, Collins published an updated version of the anonymous translation which cut several passages, including a whole chapter entitled &quot;The Past&quot;, and renamed others. This abridgment was republished by many Collins imprints and other publishers including the Modern Library, Vintage, and the 1998 Oxford World&#x27;s Classics edition (later editions restored the text). In 2008 Oxford released a revised edition with translation by David Coward. The 2009 Everyman&#x27;s Library edition reprints the original anonymous English translation that first appeared in 1846, with revisions by Peter Washington and an introduction by Umberto Eco.

In 1996, Penguin Classics published a new translation by Robin Buss. Buss&#x27; translation updated the language, making the text more accessible to modern readers, and restored content that was modified in the 1846 translation because of Victorian English social restrictions (for example, references to Eugénie&#x27;s lesbian traits and behavior) to reflect Dumas&#x27; original version.

In addition to the above, there have also been many abridged translations such as an 1892 edition published by F.M. Lupton, translated by Henry L. Williams (this translation was also released by M.J. Ivers in 1892 with Williams using the pseudonym of Professor William Thiese). A more recent abridgment is the translation by Lowell Bair for &quot;Bantam Classics&quot; in 1956.

Many abridged translations omit the Count&#x27;s enthusiasm for hashish. When serving a hashish jam to the young Frenchman Franz d&#x27;Épinay, the Count (calling himself Sinbad the Sailor), calls it, &quot;nothing less than the ambrosia which Hebe served at the table of Jupiter&quot;. When he arrives in Paris, the Count brandishes an emerald box in which he carries small green pills compounded of hashish and opium which he uses for sleeplessness. (Source: Chapters 31, 32, 38, 40, 53 &amp; 77 in the 117-chapter unabridged Pocket Books edition.) Dumas was a member of the Club des Hashischins.

In June 2017, Manga Classics, an imprint of UDON Entertainment, published The Count of Monte Cristo as a faithfully adapted Manga edition of the classic novel.

===Japanese translations===
The first Japanese translation by Kuroiwa Shūroku was entitled &quot;Shigai Shiden Gankutsu-ou&quot; (史外史伝巌窟王, &quot;a historical story from outside history, the King of the Cavern&quot;), and serialized from 1901 to 1902 in the Yorozu Chouhou newspaper, and released in book form in four volumes by publisher Aoki Suusandou in 1905. Though later translations use the title &quot;Monte Cristo-haku&quot; (モンテ・クリスト伯, the Count of Monte Cristo), the &quot;Gankutsu-ou&quot; title remains highly associated with the novel and is often used as an alternative. As of March 2016, all movie adaptations of the novel brought to Japan used the title &quot;Gankutsu-ou&quot;, with the exception of the 2002 film, which has it as a subtitle (with the title itself simply being &quot;Monte Cristo&quot;).

The novel is popular in Japan, and has spawned numerous adaptations, the most notable of which are the novels &quot;Meiji Gankutsu-ou&quot; by Taijirou Murasame and &quot;Shin Gankutsu-ou&quot; by Kaitarō Hasegawa. Its influence can also be seen in how one of the first prominent cases of miscarriage of justice in Japan, in which an innocent man was charged with murder and imprisoned for half a century, is known in Japanese as the &quot;Yoshida Gankutsu-ou incident&quot; (吉田岩窟王事件).

A manga adaptation of the novel, titled &quot;Monte Cristo Hakushaku&quot; (モンテ・クリスト, 伯爵) and made by Ena Moriyama, was published in November 2015.

===Chinese translations===
The first translation into Chinese was published in 1907. The novel had been a personal favorite of Jiang Qing, and the 1978 translation became one of the first mass-popularized foreign novels in mainland China after end of the Cultural Revolution. Since then, there have been another 22 Chinese translations.

==Reception and legacy==
The original work was published in serial form in the &quot;Journal des Débats&quot; in 1844. Carlos Javier Villafane Mercado described the effect in Europe:

George Saintsbury stated that &quot;&quot;Monte Cristo&quot; is said to have been at its first appearance, and for some time subsequently, the most popular book in Europe. Perhaps no novel within a given number of years had so many readers and penetrated into so many different countries.&quot; This popularity has extended into modern times as well. The book was &quot;translated into virtually all modern languages and has never been out of print in most of them. There have been at least twenty-nine motion pictures based on it ... as well as several television series, and many movies [have] worked the name &#x27;Monte Cristo&#x27; into their titles.&quot; The title &quot;Monte Cristo&quot; lives on in a &quot;famous gold mine, a line of luxury Cuban cigars, a sandwich, and any number of bars and casinos—it even lurks in the name of the street-corner hustle three-card monte.&quot;

Modern Russian writer and philologist Vadim Nikolayev determined &quot;The Count of Monte-Cristo&quot; as a megapolyphonic novel.

The novel has been the inspiration for many other books, from Lew Wallace&#x27;s &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1880), then to a science fiction retelling in Alfred Bester&#x27;s &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot;, and to Stephen Fry&#x27;s &quot;The Stars&#x27; Tennis Balls&quot; (entitled &quot;Revenge&quot; in the U.S.).

Fantasy novelist Steven Brust&#x27;s Khaavren Romances series have all used Dumas novels (particularly the Three Musketeers series) as their chief inspiration, recasting the plots of those novels to fit within Brust&#x27;s established world of Dragaera. His 2020 novel &quot;The Baron of Magister Valley&quot; follows suit, using &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; as a starting point. Jin Yong has admitted some influence from Dumas, his favorite non-Chinese novelist. Some commentators feel that the plot of &quot;A Deadly Secret&quot; resembles &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, except that they are based in different countries and historical periods.

==Historical background==

The success of &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; coincides with France&#x27;s Second Empire. In the novel, Dumas tells of the 1815 return of Napoleon I, and alludes to contemporary events when the governor at the Château d&#x27;If is promoted to a position at the castle of Ham. The attitude of Dumas towards &quot;bonapartisme&quot; was conflicted. His father, Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, a Haitian of mixed descent, became a successful general during the French Revolution. In 1840, the body of Napoleon I was brought to France and became an object of veneration in the church of Les Invalides, renewing popular patriotic support for the Bonaparte family. As the story opens, the character Dantès is not aware of the politics, considers himself simply a good French citizen, and is caught between the conflicting loyalties of the royalist Villefort during the Restoration, and the father of Villefort, Noirtier, loyal to Napoleon, a firm bonapartist, and the bonapartist loyalty of his late captain, in a period of rapid changes of government in France.
In &quot;Causeries&quot; (1860), Dumas published a short paper, &quot;État civil du Comte de Monte-Cristo&quot;, on the genesis of the Count of Monte Cristo. It appears that Dumas had close contacts with members of the Bonaparte family while living in Florence in 1841. In a small boat, he sailed around the island of Monte Cristo, accompanied by a young prince, a cousin to Louis Bonaparte, who was to become Emperor Napoleon III of the French ten years later, in 1851. During this trip, he promised that cousin of Louis Bonaparte that he would write a novel with the island&#x27;s name in the title. In 1841 when Dumas made his promise, Louis Bonaparte himself was imprisoned at the citadel of Ham – the place mentioned in the novel. Dumas did visit him there, although Dumas does not mention it in &quot;Etat civil&quot;.

===Sequel books===
In 1853, a work professing to be the sequel of the book, entitled &quot;The Hand of the Deceased&quot;, appeared in Portuguese and French editions (respectively entitled &quot;A Mão do finado&quot; and &quot;La Main du défunt&quot;). The novel, falsely attributed to Dumas, but in fact, originally published anonymously or sometimes attributed to one F. Le Prince, has been traced to Portuguese writer .

Other sequels include:
* 1856: &quot;&quot;, by . 
* 1881: &quot;The Son of Monte Cristo&quot;, Jules Lermina (1839–1915). This novel was divided in the English translation into two books: &quot;The Wife of Monte Cristo&quot; and &quot;The Son of Monte Cristo&quot;). Both were published in English in New York, 1884, translated by Jacob Ralph Abarbanell (1852–1922).

* 1902: &quot;Countess of Monte Cristo&quot;, by Jacob Ralph Abarbanell.

===Plays and musicals===
Alexandre Dumas and Auguste Maquet wrote a set of four plays that collectively told the story of &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;: &quot;Monte Cristo Part I&quot; (1848); &quot;Monte Cristo Part II&quot; (1848); &quot;Le Comte de Morcerf&quot; (1851) and &quot;Villefort&quot; (1851). The first two plays were first performed at Dumas&#x27; own Théâtre Historique in February 1848, with the performance spread over two nights, each with a long duration (the first evening ran from 18:00 until 00:00). The play was also unsuccessfully performed at Drury Lane in London later that year where rioting erupted in protest against French companies performing in England.

The adaptation differs from the novel in many respects: several characters, such as Luigi Vampa, are excluded; whereas the novel includes many different plot threads that are brought together at the conclusion, the third and fourth plays deal only with the fate of Mondego and Villefort respectively (Danglars&#x27;s fate is not featured at all); the play is the first to feature Dantès shouting &quot;the world is mine!&quot;, an iconic line that would be used in many future adaptations.
Two English adaptations of the novel were published in 1868. The first, by Hailes Lacy, differs only slightly from Dumas&#x27; version with the main change being that Fernand Mondego is killed in a duel with the Count rather than committing suicide. Much more radical was the version by Charles Fechter, a notable French-Anglo actor. The play faithfully follows the first part of the novel, omits the Rome section and makes several sweeping changes to the third part, among the most significant being that Albert is actually the son of Dantès. The fates of the three main antagonists are also altered: Villefort, whose fate is dealt with quite early on in the play, kills himself after being foiled by the Count trying to kill Noirtier (Villefort&#x27;s half brother in this version); Mondego kills himself after being confronted by Mercedes; Danglars is killed by the Count in a duel. The ending sees Dantès and Mercedes reunited and the character of Haydee is not featured at all. The play was first performed at the Adelphi in London in October 1868. The original duration was five hours, resulting in Fechter abridging the play, which, despite negative reviews, had a respectable sixteen-week run. Fechter moved to the United States in 1869 and Monte Cristo was chosen for the inaugural play at the opening of the Globe Theatre, Boston in 1870. Fechter last performed the role in 1878.

In 1883, John Stetson, manager of the Booth Theatre and The Globe Theatre, wanted to revive the play and asked James O&#x27;Neill (the father of playwright Eugene O&#x27;Neill) to perform the lead role. O&#x27;Neill, who had never seen Fechter perform, made the role his own and the play became a commercial, if not an artistic success. O&#x27;Neill made several abridgments to the play and eventually bought it from Stetson. A motion picture based on Fechter&#x27;s play, with O&#x27;Neill in the title role, was released in 1913 but was not a huge success. O&#x27;Neill died in 1920, two years before a more successful motion picture, produced by Fox and partially based on Fechter&#x27;s version, was released. O&#x27;Neill came to despise the role of Monte Cristo, which he performed more than 6000 times, feeling that his typecasting had prevented him from pursuing more artistically rewarding roles. This discontent later became a plot point in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s semi-autobiographical play &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey Into Night&quot;.

In 2008, the Russian theater of Moscow Operetta set a musical &quot;Monte-Cristo&quot; based on the book with music of Roman Ignatiev and lyrics of Yulii Kim. Six years later it won in Daegu International Musical Festival in South Korea. Original plot was slightly changed and some characters are not mentioned in the musical.

&quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is a musical based on the novel, with influences from the 2002 film adaptation of the book. The music is written by Frank Wildhorn and the lyrics and book are by Jack Murphy. It debuted in Switzerland in 2009.

<text>The U.S. state of North Carolina is divided into 100 counties. North Carolina ranks 28th in size by area, but has the seventh-highest number of counties in the country.

Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, King Charles II rewarded eight persons on March 24, 1663, for their faithful support of his efforts to regain the throne of England. He gave the eight grantees, called Lords Proprietor, the land called Carolina, in honor of King Charles I, his father. The Province of Carolina, from 1663 to 1729, was a North American English (1663–1707), then British (from 1707 union with Scotland) colony. In 1729, the Province of North Carolina became a separate entity from the Province of South Carolina.

The establishment of North Carolina counties stretches over 240 years, beginning in 1668 with the creation of Albemarle County and ending with the 1911 creation of Avery and Hoke counties. Five counties have been divided or abolished altogether, the last being Dobbs County in 1791.

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry. North Carolina&#x27;s FIPS code is 37, which when combined with the county code is written as 37.
==List==
==Historic counties==
For several months in 1784, Cumberland County was known as Fayette County and sent representatives to the North Carolina General Assembly of April 1784 under this name.

===Proposed counties===
In the state&#x27;s history, two counties have officially been proposed, but not created—Hooper County and Lillington County, in 1851 and 1859, respectively. The former was to be created from parts of Richmond and Robeson Counties, and the latter was to be created from parts of New Hanover County. Both of the proposals failed in their respective referendums. Later on, Scotland County would be created in the area where Hooper County was proposed, and Pender County would fill the area where Lillington County was proposed.

<doc id="82167" wikidata="Q187709" url="?curid=82167" title="The Rutles">
<text>The Rutles () were a rock band that performed visual and aural pastiches and parodies of the Beatles. This originally fictional band, created by Eric Idle and Neil Innes for a sketch in Idle&#x27;s mid-1970s BBC television comedy series &quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot;, later toured and recorded, releasing two studio albums and garnering two UK chart hits. The band toured again from 2002 until Innes&#x27;s death in 2019.

Encouraged by the positive public reaction to the sketch, Idle wrote the mockumentary television film &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; (1978, &quot;The Rutles&quot;). Idle co-directed the film with Gary Weis; it features 20 Beatles&#x27; music pastiches written by Innes, which he performed with three musicians as the Rutles. A soundtrack album in 1978 was followed in 1996 by &quot;Archaeology&quot;, which spoofed the then-recent &quot;Beatles Anthology&quot; series. A second film, &quot;The Rutles 2: Can&#x27;t Buy Me Lunch&quot; (modelled on the 2000 TV special &quot;The Beatles Revolution&quot;), was made in 2002 and released in the US on DVD in 2003.

==History==
===&quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot; (1975–76)===
The Rutles were foreshadowed in episode 3 of Eric Idle&#x27;s 1975 BBC television series &quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot;, in which Neil Innes accompanied himself on a piano singing what later became the song &quot;Good Times Roll&quot; (included on the Rutles&#x27; first, self-titled album in 1978). The Rutles themselves first appeared in a sketch later in 1975, which presented a mock mini-documentary about the fictional 1960s band. The sketch featured Neil Innes (formerly of the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band and a frequent Monty Python collaborator) fronting the band, singing &quot;I Must Be in Love&quot;, a pastiche of Lennon and McCartney&#x27;s 1964 style.

The sketch was the work of Innes and Idle. Innes was the musician and composer for Rutland Weekend Television, and he routinely created songs along with ideas of how to present the songs on the show. After writing &quot;I Must Be in Love&quot;, Innes conceived parodying the film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, because he felt the song sounded very &quot;Beatle-y&quot;. He passed the idea of a Beatles spoof along to Idle, who had a separate idea about a boring TV documentary maker, and they merged the ideas into a single extended sketch for the TV show. The &quot;Rutles&quot; band name was a running joke based on the regional premise of the TV show, which was presented as a programme by a fictional TV station based in Rutland, the smallest county in England. The initial idea had been to do a parody of the Rolling Stones called the Rutland Stones but, when it became a parody of the Beatles, Idle suggested the name &quot;Rutles&quot;. &#x27;The Prefab Four&#x27; is a play on the Beatles&#x27; nickname &#x27;the Fab Four&#x27; with an additional subtext: a prefab was a cheap postwar form of British housing, intended to be temporary, often poorly constructed, draughty and leaky, and not well-regarded by those who had to live in them.

The Rutles had connections with the Beatles aside from the parody. The Beatles were fans of Innes&#x27;s previous band, the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, and had featured the Bonzos in their television film &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; (1967). Paul McCartney (working with Gus Dudgeon under the collective alias Apollo C. Vermouth) had produced the Bonzos&#x27; hit single &quot;I&#x27;m the Urban Spaceman&quot; in 1968. George Harrison made a guest appearance on &quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot;″s 1975 Boxing Day special, with Idle and Innes, and he encouraged them to make a film that would parody the Beatles&#x27; career and serve to deflate the myths surrounding the band&#x27;s legacy.

In 1976, BBC Records produced &quot;The Rutland Weekend Songbook&quot;, an album containing 23 tracks including the Rutles songs &quot;I Must Be in Love&quot; and &quot;The Children of Rock and Roll&quot; (later reworked as &quot;Good Times Roll&quot;).

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1976–77)===
One year after their initial BBC appearance, on 2 October 1976 Idle appeared on the American NBC show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and showed videotape extracts from &quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot; – including the Rutles clip. That led to a suggestion by &quot;SNL&quot; executive producer Lorne Michaels to extend the skit into a one-hour mock documentary for television. This proposal led to the mockumentary &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; (1978), directed by &quot;SNL&quot; film director Gary Weis, with Idle credited as co-director.

On 23 April 1977, Idle made another appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, with Neil Innes as a musical guest. A running theme for this episode was the &quot;Save Great Britain Telethon&quot;, and it included an appearance by &quot;the Rutle who lives in New York, Nasty&quot;. Innes appeared as Nasty with a lone white piano, singing a short version of &quot;Cheese &amp; Onions&quot;. Later in the episode, as Neil Innes, he performed &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, a song subsequently recorded by the Rutles.

===&quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot;, 1978===
Written by Idle and Innes, &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; documents the rise and fall of the Rutles, paralleling much of the history of the Beatles. The project was given extra recognition through Harrison&#x27;s support; as well as providing ideas, he supplied Idle and Innes with a copy of the Beatles&#x27; long-planned documentary, &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; (eventually re-titled &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; and released in 1995). Idle drew inspiration from this 1976 version of the documentary, as compiled by Neil Aspinall, and was granted permission to use some of the archival footage to tell the Rutles&#x27; story.

Innes wrote, composed, and produced the music. He relied on his memory of Beatles music, and not careful later analysis, to create sound-alike songs. Innes assembled a band (himself, John Halsey, Ollie Halsall, Andy Brown, and Ricky Fataar) and the group played in a London pub to gel. During Rutles performances and studio recordings, Innes took lead on the songs that resembled Lennon&#x27;s; Halsall sang on most McCartney-esque tunes; Fataar sang the Harrison songs; and Halsey sang a Ringo Starr-type song. Idle mimed to Halsall&#x27;s singing and Brown&#x27;s bass playing in the completed film. Halsall appeared in the film as &quot;Leppo&quot;, the fifth Rutle who in the earliest years &quot;mainly stood at the back&quot;. Brown did not appear in the film.

The film is a series of skits and gags that illustrate the Rutles story, following the chronology of the Beatles. The glue of the film is the soundtrack by Innes, who wrote and composed 19 more songs for the film, each a pastiche of a Beatles song or genre. Fourteen songs were on a soundtrack album. The CD version added the six songs omitted from the original vinyl album. The 2018 vinyl reissue contains the original 14-song configuration and includes a bonus EP containing the 6 extra songs (interestingly, due of its purchase by Warner Bros., the reissue came out on the Parlophone label, the label the Beatles originally were publishing on). The album was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Comedy Recording of the year. The orchestrations and arrangements were by film composer John Altman, and it was recorded and mixed by Steve James.

&quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; was not a success on American television on its first showing on 22 March 1978, finishing at the bottom of all programs that week. The show fared better on BBC television when it premiered a week later, on 27 March 1978.

A 66-minute version was edited for TV and was released on video and DVD, but this has been superseded by the restored 72-minute version.

Additional actors in the special include Dan Aykroyd as the man who turned down the Rutles, John Belushi as Ron Decline (a parody of Allen Klein), Bill Murray as &quot;Bill Murray the K&quot;, Gilda Radner as a reluctant street interviewee, George Harrison as a TV reporter, Mick Jagger and Paul Simon as themselves, Michael Palin as Eric Manchester (a parody of Beatles press agent Derek Taylor), Ron Wood as a biker, Lorne Michaels as a man who wants to merchandise the Rutles, Al Franken and Tom Davis as Ron Decline employees, and many others. It includes actual footage of David Frost and Ed Sullivan taken from TV appearances.

===The Beatles&#x27; reaction===

* George Harrison was involved in the project from the beginning. Producer Gary Weis said: &quot;We were sitting around in Eric&#x27;s kitchen one day, planning a sequence that really ripped into the mythology and George looked up and said, &#x27;We were the Beatles, you know!&#x27; Then he shook his head and said, &#x27;Aw, never mind.&#x27; I think he was the only one of the Beatles who really could see the irony of it all.&quot; Harrison said: &quot;The Rutles sort of liberated me from the Beatles in a way. It was the only thing I saw of those Beatles television shows they made. It was actually the best, funniest and most scathing. But at the same time, it was done with the most love.&quot;
* Ringo Starr liked the happier scenes in the film, but felt the scenes that mimicked sadder times hit too close.
* John Lennon loved the film and refused to return the videotape and soundtrack he was given for approval. He told Innes, however, that &quot;Get Up and Go&quot; was too close to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Get Back&quot; and to be careful not to be sued by ATV Music, owners of the Beatles catalogue copyright at the time. The song was consequently omitted from the 1978 vinyl LP soundtrack.
* Paul McCartney, who had just released his own album &quot;London Town&quot;, always answered &quot;No comment.&quot; According to Innes: &quot;He had a dinner at some awards thing at the same table as Eric one night and Eric said it was a little frosty.&quot; Idle claimed that McCartney changed his mind because his wife Linda thought it was funny. McCartney also warmed up to the film when he learned that Idle was from Wallasey, opposite Liverpool. According to Idle, he said: &quot;Hey, Linda, it&#x27;s okay, he&#x27;s a Scouse, he&#x27;s one of us!&quot;

Idle claims on the &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; DVD commentary track that Harrison and Starr at one point discussed starting a band with Innes and Idle, based on the Beatles&#x27; and Rutles&#x27; shared and imaginary histories. Harrison and Starr also surprised him and Innes one day by singing a version of the Rutles&#x27; &quot;Ouch!&quot;

===Later history===
In 1979, Idle and Fataar issued a single as &quot;Dirk and Stig&quot;—&quot;Ging Gang Goolie&quot; backed with &quot;Mr. Sheene&quot;. This was Idle&#x27;s only appearance on a Rutles-related disc. There were no Rutles projects throughout the 1980s.

In 1982, the Rutles were involved in a record scandal reminiscent of the one surrounding the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot; album. Rhino Records, at the time a small Los Angeles label specialising in offbeat releases, released an album that it called &quot;Beatlesongs&quot;, purportedly a collection of Beatles novelty songs but actually a weird catch-all of assorted Beatles-related tunes. For the collection, Rhino licensed the Rutles&#x27; &quot;Hold My Hand&quot; from Warner Bros Records. The cover of the album was done by well-known commercial artist William Stout, who had made a name for himself drawing the cover artwork for some of the best-looking Beatles bootleg records in the 1970s. His cover drawing included a representation of Mark Chapman, the man who had killed John Lennon. The ensuing uproar prompted Rhino to reissue the album with a new cover featuring a photograph of Beatles memorabilia, claiming that Stout refused to amend his work.

A clip from &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; appeared on a VHS compilation tape of comedy videos put out by the now-defunct Vestron Home Video in 1985. The clip is simply the Tragical History Tour part of &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot;, with the sound clunkily muted out during the segment&#x27;s narration in order to leave just the music. This home video release was released on both VHS and Laserdisc.

Innes, with a group called the Moptops backed by the &#x27;Rutland Symphony Orchestra&#x27;, performed as &quot;Ron Nasty and the New Rutles&quot; at a convention honouring the 25th anniversary of Monty Python in 1994. This led to a Rutles reunion album in 1996, featuring Innes, Fataar and Halsey. Halsall died in 1992, but the reunion album, titled &quot;Archaeology&quot; as a play on the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Anthology&quot; series, featured several tracks recorded in 1978 that included his contributions. The Japanese version included four bonus tracks.

In 2000, Idle released &quot;Eric Idle Sings Monty Python&quot;, a live concert album in which he performs &quot;I Must Be in Love&quot; as Sir Dirk McQuickly.

In 2002, Idle made &quot;The Rutles 2: Can&#x27;t Buy Me Lunch&quot;, which remained unreleased for a year. The film employs unused footage from the previous Rutles film, and features an even bigger number of celebrity interviews discussing the band&#x27;s influence. This was met with mixed reactions from fans, particularly because no new footage of the Rutles was filmed. The DVD had yet to be released in the UK as of February 2014.

McQuickly and Nasty have cameos in the 2004 graphic novel, &quot;&quot;, co-written by former Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus member John Cleese.

In 2007, a reissue of &quot;Archaeology&quot; included a new Rutles track called &quot;Rut-a-lot&quot; (a jab at Idle&#x27;s stage show &quot;Spamalot&quot;) which is simply a live medley of songs from the first Rutles album.

On 17 March 2008, all four movie Rutles (Innes, Idle, Fataar and Halsey) reunited for the first time at a 30th anniversary screening of &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood. The event included a question and answer session and performance by members of the tribute show &quot;Rutlemania&quot; which ran for a week at the Ricardo Montalbán Theatre in Hollywood before doing a week in NYC at the Blender Gramercy Theater. The &quot;Rutlemania&quot; live show was conceived and written by Eric Idle which starred the Beatles tribute group the Fab Four as &quot;The Pre-Fab Four&quot; Rutles.

In February 2009, on his website &quot;InnesBookOfRecords.Com&quot;, Innes released what he referred to as &quot;Ron Nasty&#x27;s Final Song&quot;, titled &quot;Imitation Song&quot;, a parody of &quot;Imagine&quot;. This was also Innes&#x27;s first and only entry in the &quot;Masters of Song-Fu&quot; competition run by Quick Stop Entertainment.

On 9 February 2014, Idle reprised his narrator persona from &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; as part of &quot;The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to The Beatles&quot;, noting how the Rutles had made their American debut 50 years earlier, and it was an amazing coincidence the Beatles were there the same day. He then lent straight narration to biographical sketches of the Beatles&#x27; early lives.

On 29 December 2019, Innes died of a heart attack at the age of 75, and the Rutles disbanded shortly afterwards. In his final interview before his death, Innes expressed enthusiasm about either a late 2019 U.S. tour or a 2020 spring tour for the Rutles.

==Lawsuits==
Following the release of the 1978 the Rutles album, ATV Music, the then-owner of the publishing rights to the Beatles catalogue sued Innes for copyright infringement. Though Innes hired a musicologist to defend the originality of his songs, he settled with ATV out of court for 50% of the royalties on the 14 songs included on the album. The settlement did not include any other Rutles songs which were not on the original LP release (some of which were included in the television film, e.g., &quot;Baby Let Me Be&quot;, &quot;Between Us&quot;, &quot;Blue Suede Schubert&quot;, &quot;Get Up And Go&quot;, &quot;Goose Step Mama&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Looking Good&quot;); Innes retained 100% royalties to these. On actual Rutles releases, LP, CD, etc., writing credit for all songs has always been printed as Neil Innes only.

<doc id="82172" wikidata="Q182357" url="?curid=82172" title="Lyric poetry">
<text>Modern lyric poetry is a formal type of poetry which expresses personal emotions or feelings, typically spoken in the first person.
The term for both modern lyric poetry and modern song lyrics derives from a form of Ancient Greek literature, the Greek lyric, which was defined by its musical accompaniment, usually on an instrument known as a kithara, a seven-stringed lyre (hence &quot;lyric&quot;). These three are not equivalent, though song lyrics &quot;are&quot; often in the lyric mode and Ancient Greek lyric poetry &quot;was&quot; principally chanted verse. 

The term owes its importance in literary theory to the division developed by Aristotle among three broad categories of poetry: lyrical, dramatic, and epic. Lyric poetry is one of the earliest forms of literature.

==Meters==
Much lyric poetry depends on regular meter based either on syllable or on stress – two short syllables or one long syllable typically counting as equivalent – which is required for song lyrics in order to match lyrics with interchangeable tunes that followed a standard pattern of rhythm. Although much modern lyric poetry is no longer song lyrics, the rhythmic forms have persisted without the music.

The most common meters are as follows:
* Iambic – two syllables, with the short or unstressed syllable followed by the long or stressed syllable.
* Trochaic – two syllables, with the long or stressed syllable followed by the short or unstressed syllable. In English, this metre is found almost entirely in lyric poetry.
* Pyrrhic – Two unstressed syllables
*Anapestic – three syllables, with the first two short or unstressed and the last long or stressed.
* Dactylic – three syllables, with the first one long or stressed and the other two short or unstressed.
* Spondaic – two syllables, with two successive long or stressed syllables.
Some forms have a combination of meters, often using a different meter for the refrain.

==History==

===Antiquity===
====Greece====

For the ancient Greeks, lyric poetry had a precise technical meaning: Verse that was accompanied by a lyre, cithara, or barbitos. Because such works were typically sung, it was also known as melic poetry. The lyric or melic poet was distinguished from the writer of plays (although Athenian drama included choral odes, in lyric form), the writer of trochaic and iambic verses (which were recited), the writer of elegies (accompanied by the flute, rather than the lyre) and the writer of epic.
The scholars of Hellenistic Alexandria created a canon of nine lyric poets deemed especially worthy of critical study. These archaic and classical musician-poets included Sappho, Alcaeus, Anacreon and Pindar. Archaic lyric was characterized by strophic composition and live musical performance. Some poets, like Pindar extended the metrical forms in odes to a triad, including strophe, antistrophe (metrically identical to the strophe) and epode (whose form does &quot;not&quot; match that of the strophe).

====Rome====
Among the major surviving Roman poets of the classical period, only Catullus ( 11, 17, 30, 34, 51, 61) and Horace (&quot;Odes&quot;) wrote lyric poetry, which was instead read or recited. What remained were the forms, the lyric meters of the Greeks adapted to Latin. Catullus was influenced by both archaic and Hellenistic Greek verse and belonged to a group of Roman poets called the &quot;Neoteroi&quot; (&quot;New Poets&quot;) who spurned epic poetry following the lead of Callimachus. Instead, they composed brief, highly polished poems in various thematic and metrical genres. The Roman love elegies of Tibullus, Propertius, and Ovid (&quot;Amores&quot;, &quot;Heroides&quot;), with their personal phrasing and feeling, may be the thematic ancestor of much medieval, Renaissance, Romantic, and modern lyric poetry, but these works were composed in elegiac couplets and so were not lyric poetry in the ancient sense.

====China====

During China&#x27;s Warring States period, the &quot;Songs of Chu&quot; collected by Qu Yuan and Song Yu defined a new form of poetry that came from the exotic Yangtze Valley, far from the Wei and Yellow River homeland of the traditional four-character verses collected in the &quot;Book of Songs&quot;. The varying forms of the new &quot;Chu Ci&quot; provided more rhythm and greater latitude of expression.

===Medieval verse===
Originating in 10th century Persian, a &quot;ghazal&quot; is a poetic form consisting of couplets that share a rhyme and a refrain. Formally, it consists of a short lyric composed in a single meter with a single rhyme throughout. The subject is love. Notable authors include Hafiz, Amir Khusro, Auhadi of Maragheh, Alisher Navoi, Obeid e zakani, Khaqani Shirvani, Anvari, Farid al-Din Attar, Omar Khayyam, and Rudaki. The &quot;ghazal&quot; was introduced to European poetry in the early 19th century by the Germans Schlegel, Von Hammer-Purgstall, and Goethe, who called Hafiz his &quot;twin&quot;.

Lyric in European literature of the medieval or Renaissance period means a poem written so that it could be set to music—whether or not it actually was. A poem&#x27;s particular structure, function, or theme might all vary.
The lyric poetry of Europe in this period was created by the pioneers of courtly poetry and courtly love largely without reference to the classical past.
The troubadors, travelling composers and performers of songs, began to flourish towards the end of the 11th century and were often imitated in successive centuries. Trouvères were poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France. The first known &quot;trouvère&quot; was Chrétien de Troyes (fl. 1160s–80s). The dominant form of German lyric poetry in the period was the &quot;minnesang&quot;, &quot;a love lyric based essentially on a fictitious relationship between a knight and his high-born lady&quot;.
Initially imitating the lyrics of the French troubadours and trouvères, &quot;minnesang&quot; soon established a distinctive tradition. There was also a large body of medieval Galician-Portuguese lyric.

Hebrew singer-poets of the Middle Ages included Yehuda Halevi, Solomon ibn Gabirol, and Abraham ibn Ezra.

In Italy, Petrarch developed the sonnet form pioneered by Giacomo da Lentini and Dante&#x27;s &quot;Vita Nuova&quot;. In 1327, according to the poet, the sight of a woman called Laura in the church of Sainte-Claire d&#x27;Avignon awoke in him a lasting passion, celebrated in the &quot;Rime sparse&quot; (&quot;Scattered rhymes&quot;). Later, Renaissance poets who copied Petrarch&#x27;s style named this collection of 366 poems &quot;Il Canzoniere&quot; (&quot;The Song Book&quot;). Laura is in many ways both the culmination of medieval courtly love poetry and the beginning of Renaissance love lyric.

A &quot;bhajan&quot; or &quot;kirtan&quot; is a Hindu devotional song. &quot;Bhajans&quot; are often simple songs in lyrical language expressing emotions of love for the Divine. Notable authors include Kabir, Surdas, and Tulsidas.

Chinese Sanqu poetry was a Chinese poetic genre popular from the 12th-century Jin Dynasty through to the early Ming. Early 14th century playwrights like Ma Zhiyuan and Guan Hanqing were well-established writers of Sanqu. Against the usual tradition of using Classical Chinese, this poetry was composed in the vernacular.

===16th century===
In 16th-century Britain, Thomas Campion wrote lute songs and Sir Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, and William Shakespeare popularized the sonnet.

In France, La Pléiade, a group including Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay, and Jean-Antoine de Baïf, aimed to break with earlier traditions of French poetry, particularly Marot and the &quot;grands rhétoriqueurs&quot;, and began imitating classical Greek and Roman forms such as the ode. Favorite poets of the school were Pindar, Anacreon, Alcaeus, Horace, and Ovid. They also produced Petrarchan sonnet cycles.

Spanish devotional poetry adapted the lyric for religious purposes. Notable examples were Teresa of Ávila, John of the Cross, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Garcilaso de la Vega, Francisco de Medrano and Lope de Vega. Although better known for his epic &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot;, Luís de Camões is also considered the greatest Portuguese lyric poet of the period.

In Japan, the &quot;naga-uta&quot; (&quot;long song&quot;) was a lyric poem popular in this era. It alternated five and seven-syllable lines and ended with an extra seven-syllable line.

===17th century===
Lyrical poetry was the dominant form of 17th century English poetry from John Donne to Andrew Marvell.
The poems of this period were short. Rarely narrative, they tended towards intense expression. Other notable poets of the era include Ben Jonson, Robert Herrick, George Herbert, Aphra Behn, Thomas Carew, John Suckling, Richard Lovelace, John Milton, Richard Crashaw, and Henry Vaughan. A German lyric poet of the period is Martin Opitz; in Japan, this was the era of the noted haiku-writer Matsuo Bashō.

===18th century===
In the 18th century, lyric poetry declined in England and France. The atmosphere of literary discussion in the English coffeehouses and French salons was not congenial to lyric poetry.
Exceptions include the lyrics of Robert Burns, William Cowper, Thomas Gray, and Oliver Goldsmith. German lyric poets of the period include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Novalis, Friedrich Schiller, and Johann Heinrich Voß. Kobayashi Issa was a Japanese lyric poet during this period. In Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, Louis chevalier de Jaucourt described lyric poetry of the time as &quot;a type of poetry totally devoted to sentiment; that&#x27;s its substance, its essential object&quot;.

===19th century===

In Europe, the lyric emerged as the principal poetic form of the 19th century and came to be seen as synonymous with poetry.
Romantic lyric poetry consisted of first-person accounts of the thoughts and feelings of a specific moment; the feelings were extreme but personal.

The traditional sonnet was revived in Britain, with William Wordsworth writing more sonnets than any other British poet. Other important Romantic lyric writers of the period include Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Lord Byron. Later in the century, the Victorian lyric was more linguistically self-conscious and defensive than the Romantic forms had been.
Such Victorian lyric poets include Alfred Lord Tennyson and Christina Rossetti.

Lyric poetry was popular with the German reading public between 1830 and 1890, as shown in the number of poetry anthologies published in the period.
According to Georg Lukács, the verse of Joseph von Eichendorff exemplified the German Romantic revival of the folk-song tradition initiated by Goethe, Herder, and Arnim and Brentano&#x27;s &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot;.

France also saw a revival of the lyric voice during the 19th century.
The lyric became the dominant mode of French poetry during this period.
For Walter Benjamin, Charles Baudelaire was the last example of lyric poetry &quot;successful on a mass scale&quot; in Europe.

In Russia, Aleksandr Pushkin exemplified a rise of lyric poetry during the 18th and early 19th centuries.
The Swedish &quot;Phosphorists&quot; were influenced by the Romantic movement and their chief poet Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom produced many lyric poems.
Italian lyric poets of the period include Ugo Foscolo, Giacomo Leopardi, Giovanni Pascoli, and Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio. Spanish lyric poets include Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer, Rosalía de Castro, and José de Espronceda. Catalan lyric poets include Jacint Verdaguer, and Miquel Costa i Llobera. Japanese lyric poets include Taneda Santoka, Masaoka Shiki, and Ishikawa Takuboku.

===20th century===
In the earlier years of the 20th century rhymed lyric poetry, usually expressing the feelings of the poet, was the dominant poetic form in the United States, Europe, and the British colonies. The English Georgian poets and their contemporaries such as A. E. Housman, Walter de la Mare, and Edmund Blunden used the lyric form. The Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore was praised by William Butler Yeats for his lyric poetry; Yeats compared him to the troubadour poets when the two met in 1912.

The relevance and acceptability of the lyric in the modern age was, though, called into question by modernist poets such as Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, H.D., and William Carlos Williams, who rejected the English lyric form of the 19th century, feeling that it relied too heavily on melodious language, rather than complexity of thought.

After World War II, the American New Criticism returned to the lyric, advocating a poetry that made conventional use of rhyme, meter, and stanzas, and was modestly personal in the lyric tradition.

Lyric poetry dealing with relationships, sex, and domestic life constituted the new mainstream of American poetry in the middle of the 20th century, following such movements as the confessional poets of the 1950s and 1960s, who included Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton. the Black Mountain movement with Robert Creeley, Organic Verse represented by Denise Levertov, Projective verse or &quot;open field&quot; composition as represented by Charles Olson, and also Language Poetry which aimed for extreme minimalism along with numerous other experimental verse movements throughout the remainder of the 20th century, up into today where these questions of what constitutes poetry, lyrical or otherwise, are still being discussed but now in the context of hypertext and multimedia as it is used via the Internet.

<text>There are 88 counties in the U.S. state of Ohio. Nine of them existed at the time of the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802. A tenth county, Wayne, was established on August 15, 1796, and encompassed roughly the present state of Michigan. During the Convention, the county was opposed to statehood, and was not only left out of the Convention, but dissolved; the current Wayne County is in northeastern Ohio, considerably distant from the area that was the original Wayne County.

The Ohio Constitution allows counties to set up a charter government as many cities and villages do, but only Summit and Cuyahoga counties have done so, the latter having been approved by voters in November 2009. Counties do not possess home rule powers and can do only what has been expressly authorized by the Ohio General Assembly. The elected county officials in Ohio county governments include three commissioners, a sheriff (the highest law enforcement officer in the county); prosecutor (equivalent of a district attorney in other states); coroner, engineer, Recorder, auditor, treasurer, and clerk of courts.

Population figures are based on the 2023 vintage Census population estimates. The population of Ohio was 11,785,935 at that time, a decrease of 0.1% from 2020. The average population of Ohio&#x27;s counties was 133,931; Franklin County was the most populous (1,326,063) and Vinton County was the least (12,474). The average land area is . The largest county by area is Ashtabula County at , and its neighbor, Lake County, is the smallest at . The total area of the state is .

==List of county codes==
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is used by the U.S. government to uniquely identify counties. In the following table, these codes link to the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s &quot;quick facts&quot; for each county. Ohio&#x27;s FIPS code of 39 is used to distinguish from counties in other states. For example, Adams County&#x27;s unique nationwide identifier is 39001.

Various state agencies identify counties by different coding schemes. The Ohio Department of Taxation assigns consecutive numbers for the purpose of enumerating taxing districts. The Ohio Department of Public Safety, including the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles, associates these county numbers with vehicle registrations. The Department of Transportation uses three-letter abbreviations in road inventory and traffic management applications. For historic preservation purposes, Ohio History Connection refers to counties by two- and three-letter abbreviations in the Ohio Archaeological Inventory and Ohio Historic Inventory, respectively.

<doc id="82175" wikidata="Q1334169" url="?curid=82175" title="List of counties in Oklahoma">
<text>The U.S. state of Oklahoma has 77 counties. It is ranked 20th in size and 17th in the number of counties, between Mississippi with 82 counties and Arkansas with 75 counties.

Oklahoma originally had seven counties (Logan, Cleveland, Oklahoma, Canadian, Kingfisher, Payne, and Beaver) when it was first organized as the Oklahoma Territory. These counties were designated numerically, first through seventh. New counties added after this were designated by letters of the alphabet. The first seven counties were later renamed. The Oklahoma Constitutional Convention named all of the counties that were formed when Oklahoma entered statehood in 1907. Only two counties have been formed since then. Upon statehood, all Oklahoma counties allowed civil townships within their counties. A few years after statehood, a constitutional amendment allowed them to be abolished on a county-by-county basis, and by the mid-1930s, all Oklahoma counties had voted to do so.

According to the Oklahoma Constitution, a county can be disorganized if the sum of all taxable property is less than $2.5 million. If so, then a petition must be signed by one-fourth of the population and then a vote would occur. If a majority votes for dissolution of the county, the county will be combined with an adjacent county with the lowest valuation of taxable property.

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.

The area in these tables is land area, and does not include water area.

Oklahoma&#x27;s postal abbreviation is OK and its FIPS state code is 40.

Citing lack of space, inefficiency and high operating costs, the County Board chose to erect a new courthouse, which was designed by Wight &amp; Co. and completed in 2020. Considerable controversy surrounded the disposition of the 1969 courthouse, with Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois including the building on its “2022 Most Endangered Historic Places in Illinois”. After a number of votes and appeals, demolition was approved and the destruction of the building began on December 4, 2023.

==Politics==
Like most of the collar counties, Will County was once a Republican stronghold. It went Republican in all but three elections from 1892 to 1988. Since the 1990s, it has become a swing county. It voted for the national winner in every presidential election from 1980 to 2012, but Chicago-born Hillary Clinton won it along with the rest of the &quot;collar counties&quot; aside from McHenry in 2016.

<doc id="82181" wikidata="Q3039460" url="?curid=82181" title="Great Apostasy">
<text>The Great Apostasy is a concept within Christianity to describe a perception that mainstream Christian Churches have fallen away from the original faith founded by Jesus and promulgated through his Twelve Apostles.

A belief in a Great Apostasy has been characteristic of the Restorationist tradition of Christianity, which includes unrelated groups emerging after the Second Great Awakening, such as the Christadelphians, Swedenborgians, Latter Day Saints, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and Iglesia ni Cristo. These Restorationist groups hold that traditional Christianity, represented by Catholicism, Protestantism and Orthodoxy, has fallen into error and thus, the true faith needs to be restored.

The term has been used to describe the perceived fallen state of traditional Christianity, especially the Catholic Church, sometimes claiming that it changed the doctrines of the early church and allowed traditional Greco-Roman culture (i.e., Greco-Roman mysteries, deities of solar monism such as Mithras and Sol Invictus, pagan festivals and Mithraic sun worship and idol worship) into the Church on its own perception of authority. Because it made these changes using claims of tradition and not from scripture, the Church – in the opinion of those adhering to this concept – has fallen into apostasy. A major thread of this perception is the suggestion that, to attract and convert people to Christianity, the Church in Rome incorporated pagan beliefs and practices within the Christian religion, mostly Graeco-Roman rituals, mysteries, and festivals. 

The term is derived from the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, in which the Apostle Paul informs the Christians of Thessalonica that a great apostasy must occur before the return of Christ, when &quot;the man of sin is revealed, the son of destruction&quot; (chapter ). The Catholic Church, Lutheran Church, Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches have interpreted this chapter as referring to a future falling-away, during the reign of the Antichrist at the end of time.

==Overview==

Some modern scholars believe that the Christian Church in the early stages picked up pagan oral teachings from Jewish and Hellenistic sources, which formed the basis of a secret oral tradition, which in the 4th century came to be called the &quot;disciplina arcani&quot;. Mainstream theologians believe it contained liturgical details and certain other pagan traditions which remain a part of some branches of mainstream Christianity (for example, some Catholic theologians thought that the doctrine of transubstantiation was a part of this). Important esoteric influences on the church were the Christian theologians Clement of Alexandria and Origen, the main figures of the Catechetical School of Alexandria.

Restorationists teach that the Papacy slowly became corrupted as it strove to attain great dominion and authority, both civil and ecclesiastical. For example, they say, it reinstated the pagan ceremonies and obligations of the &quot;Collegium Pontificum&quot; and the position of &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot; and created Christian religious orders to replace the ancient Roman ones such as the Vestal Virgins and the &quot;flamines&quot;. It brought into the church the ancient pagan festivals and made them &#x27;Holy Days&#x27;. Catholics as well as the Reformers pointed to the office of the Papacy as responsible for the fallen state of the church as they considered the conduct of those in power had grown so spiritually or morally corrupt that it was called the Antichrist power by those within as well as outside of the church.

== Protestant views ==

Reformers like Martin Luther, John Calvin and others disagreed with the papacy&#x27;s claim of temporal power over all secular governments and the autocratic character of the papal office, and challenged papal authority as a corruption from the early church and questioned the Catholic Church&#x27;s ability to define Christian practice.

===Reformed perspective===

The defenses of the right belief and worship of the church resided in the bishops, and Protestants theorize that the process of unifying the doctrine of the church also concentrated power into their own hands (see also Ignatius of Antioch, who advocated a powerful bishop), and made their office an instrument of power coveted by ambitious men. They charge that, through ambition and jealousy, the church has been at times, and not very subtly, subverted from carrying out its sacred aim. For the Reformers, the culmination of this gradual corruption was typified, in a concentrated way, in the office of the pope who took on ancient titles such as &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot; and supreme power in the church.

Calvin, Luther, and many later churches and preachers have held that Scripture points out the Catholic Church as the fallen church of biblical prophecy.

Martin Luther believed and taught that the church had strayed and fallen away from the true teachings of the scripture. He challenged the authority of the pope of the Roman Catholic Church by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge, and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood.

Although Lutherans and Calvinists hold that the Ecumenical Councils of the early and medieval church are true expressions of the Christian faith, many assert the councils are at times inconsistent with one another, and err on particular points. The true church, they argue, will be mixed with alien influences and false beliefs, which is necessary in order for these impurities ultimately to be overcome and the truth to be vindicated.

The Westminster Confession of Faith (Calvinist), states:

The purest churches under heaven are subject both to mixture and error; and some have so degenerated as to become no churches of Christ, but synagogues of Satan. Nevertheless, there shall be always a church on earth, to worship God according to his will.

===Dispensationalist perspective===
The Historicist biblical interpretation was the viewpoint of most major Protestant Reformers, beginning with the accusations of Martin Luther. Refuting these claims was accordingly a major objective of the Counter-Reformation, both in the Catholic Church&#x27;s initial response to Luther and especially in the aftermath of the Council of Trent. This required a renewed effort to interpret the relevant scriptural passages in light of the arguments put forth by the early Protestants. Two particularly noteworthy theories were proposed during the Counter-Reformation to address the historicist claim that the Antichrist was actually the Roman Catholic church.

Francisco Ribera and Luis de Alcazar, both 16th-century Spanish Jesuits, rose to meet the challenge by introducing counter-interpretations of the prophecies in Daniel and Revelation. Their approaches became known as the Preterist and Futurist schools, and both theologies quickly gained traction throughout Catholic Europe.

Gradually, Preterism and Futurism gained currency even in Protestant thought. Few mainstream Protestant leaders today still employ the vocabulary of &quot;apostasy&quot; and &quot;anti-Christ&quot; when discussing the papacy, although some conservative Evangelical and fundamentalist churches still accept these teachings to varying degrees.

The spread of dispensationalist doctrine has led many conservative Protestants to drop the traditional interpretation of the Book of Revelation as prediction of events that have taken place throughout history (historicism) and shifted it to future events (futurism), eliminating any relation between the prophecies and the Catholic Church. This has resulted in a re-interpretation of the end times. Although Protestant fundamentalists still largely object to Catholic doctrine concerning the papacy, most have dropped the harsher Reformation view and no longer identify the pope as the Antichrist.

==Restorationist perspective==
===Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
According to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Great Apostasy started not long after the ascension of Jesus and continued until Joseph Smith&#x27;s First Vision in 1820. To LDS Church members, or Latter-day Saints, the Great Apostasy is marked by:
*the difficulty of the Apostles to keep early Christians from distorting the teachings of Jesus and to prevent the followers from dividing into different ideological groups;
*the persecution and martyrdom of the church&#x27;s Apostles;
*the loss of leaders with priesthood authority to administer the church and its ordinances;
*the lack of continuous revelation to instruct the leaders and guide the church; and
*the corruption of Christian doctrine by Greek or other allegedly pagan philosophies such as Neo-Platonism, Platonic realism, Aristotelianism and Asceticism.

Beginning in the 1st century and continuing up to the 4th century AD, some emperors of the Roman Empire carried out violent persecutions against early Christians.

The LDS Church believes that all priesthood leaders with authority to conduct and perpetuate church affairs were either martyred, taken from the earth, or began to teach impure doctrines, causing a break in the necessary apostolic succession. It is a belief that what survived was a portion of the light and truth that Jesus had established: the Church of Jesus Christ, as established by him, was no longer to be found on the earth. Survivors of the persecutions were overly-influenced by various pagan philosophies either because they were not well indoctrinated in Jesus&#x27; teachings or they corrupted their Christian beliefs (willingly, by compulsion, or with good intentions but without direct revelation from God to help them interpret said beliefs) by accepting non-Christian doctrines into their faith. LDS Church doctrine is that many plain and simple truths of the gospel of Christ were, therefore, lost.

The LDS Church and its members understand various writings in the New Testament to be an indication that even soon after the ascension of Jesus the Apostles struggled to keep early Christians from distorting the teachings of Jesus and to prevent the followers from dividing into different ideological groups. The doctrine highlights statements from the Scriptures that various Old Testament and New Testament scriptures, like 2 Thessalonians 2:3, that Jesus Christ prophesied this &quot;falling away&quot; or &quot;apostasy.&quot; The Christian believers who survived the persecutions took it upon themselves to speak for God, interpret, amend or add to his doctrines and ordinances, and carry out his work without proper authority and divine direction from God. During this time, important doctrines and rites were lost or corrupted. The doctrine of the Trinity adopted at the Council of Nicaea is an example shown of how pagan philosophy corrupted the teachings of Jesus. The LDS Church believes that Joseph Smith&#x27;s visions and revelations taught an important and sacrosanct doctrine that God, the Eternal Father, His Son, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are not one substance, but three separate and distinct beings forming one Godhead. Latter-day Saints reject the early ecumenical councils for what they see as misguided human attempts without divine assistance to decide matters of doctrine, substituting debate or politics for divine revelation. The LDS Church teaches that the often heated proceedings of such councils were evidence that the church was no longer led by revelation and divine authority. Indeed, the normative Christian view is that public revelation, or revelation that is binding on all Christians, concluded with the death of the last Apostle.

As a result, LDS Church members refer to the &quot;restitution of all things&quot; mentioned in and believe that a restoration of all the original and primary doctrines and rites of Christianity was necessary. Church members believe that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Smith, then a 14-year-old boy, and called him to be a prophet. Later Peter, James, and John, three of Christ&#x27;s apostles in the New Testament, appeared from heaven to Smith and ordained him an apostle. Through Christ&#x27;s priesthood authority and divine direction, church members believe that Smith was called and ordained to re-establish Christ&#x27;s church. Hence, members of the faith refer to their church as &quot;The Church of Jesus Christ,&quot; a name which they believe to have been revealed to Smith after the church&#x27;s founding on 6 April 1830, originally called the Church of Christ. Latter-day Saints is a term members believe refers to members of Christ&#x27;s church who were originally called &quot;saints&quot; and that the LDS Church is Christ&#x27;s restored church in these days, believed by many Christian denominations to be the last days prior to the prophesied second coming of Jesus.

===Adventists===
Ellen White wrote

Seventh-day Adventists believe that the mark of the Beast refers to the apostate church which in the end times will legally enforce Sunday-worship. &quot;Those who reject God&#x27;s memorial of creatorship – the Bible Sabbath – choosing to worship and honor Sunday in the full knowledge that it is not God&#x27;s appointed day of worship, will receive the &#x27;mark of the beast. &quot;Sunday Sabbath is purely a child of the Papacy. It is the mark of the beast.&quot; They see an apostate church that changed God&#x27;s law, preferred pagan traditions, allowed pagan beliefs and ceremonies into the church, and brought oppression against and persecuted the true believers throughout the Dark Ages for 1260 years as prophesied in Revelation 12:6, 14–16.

===Hyperdispensationalism===

Hyperdispensationalism is a niche view in Protestantism which views Pauline Christianity or the beliefs and doctrines espoused by the apostle Paul through his writings as the purest form of Christian faith and worship from which the church fell away. E. W. Bullinger framed the position for early apostasy thus:

==Responses of Catholicism, Lutheranism==
Regarding &quot;forbidding to marry&quot; and the &quot;commanding to abstain from meats&quot; in 1 Timothy 4 (Paul might have spoken in general in regard to any new sects or doctrines which could arise), the Catholic Church responds:

Martin Luther, who spearheaded the Reformation, sought to &quot;reform&quot; the Catholic Church, as opposed to &quot;restoring&quot; it. The Lutheran Church traditionally sees itself as the &quot;main trunk of the historical Christian Tree&quot; founded by Christ and the Apostles, holding that during the Reformation, the Church of Rome fell away. As such, the Augsburg Confession, the Lutheran confession of faith, teaches that &quot;the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church&quot;. When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, they explained &quot;that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils&quot;.

<text>The following is a list of the 67 counties of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The city of Philadelphia is coterminous with Philadelphia County, the municipalities having been consolidated in 1854, and all remaining county government functions having been merged into the city after a 1951 referendum. Eight of the ten most populous counties are in the southeastern portion of the state, including four out of the top five, and eight of the top ten most populous counties are in either the Greater Philadelphia or Greater Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical Areas.

==FIPS code==

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, used by the U.S. government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry. FIPS codes are five-digit numbers; for Pennsylvania the codes start with 42 and are completed with the three-digit county code. The FIPS code for each county in the table links to census data for the specific county.

==Former counties==
The Province of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Three Lower Counties had been transferred from New York Colony in 1682. In 1701 these counties became a separate colony called Delaware Colony, although it shared the same colonial governor as Pennsylvania until independence in 1776.

<doc id="82184" wikidata="Q828144" url="?curid=82184" title="Floor (gymnastics)">
<text>In gymnastics, the floor is a specially prepared exercise surface, considered an apparatus. The floor exercise (English abbreviation FX) is the event performed on the floor, in both women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s artistic gymnastics (WAG and MAG). The same floor is used for WAG FX and MAG FX, but rules and scoring differ; most obviously, a WAG FX routine is synchronised to a piece of recorded dance music, whereas MAG FX has no musical accompaniment.

A spring floor is used in all gymnastics to provide more bounce and help prevent potential injuries to gymnasts&#x27; lower extremity joints due to the nature of the apparatus, which includes the repeated pounding required to train it. Cheerleading also uses spring floors for practice. The sprung floor used for indoor athletics is designed to reduce bounce.

== The apparatus ==
The apparatus originated as a &#x27;free exercise&#x27; for men, very similar to the floor exercise of today. Most competitive gymnastics floors are spring floors. They contain springs and/or a rubber foam and plywood combination, which make the floor bouncy, soften the impact of landings, and enable the gymnast to gain height when tumbling. Floors have designated perimeters called the delimitation strip, indicating an out of bounds area.

=== Dimensions ===
Measurements of the apparatus are published by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) in the &quot;Apparatus Norms&quot; brochure. The dimensions are the same for male and female competitors.

Artistic Gymnastics, Acrobatic Gymnastics

* Performance area: 1,200 centimetres (39 ft) x 1,200 centimetres (39 ft) ± 3 centimetres (1.2 in)
* Diagonals: 1,697 centimetres (55.68 ft) ±5 centimetres (2.0 in)
* Border: 100 centimetres (3.3 ft)

Rhythmic Gymnastics

* Performance area: 1,300 centimetres (43 ft) x 1,300 centimetres (43 ft) ± 3 centimetres (1.2 in)
* Diagonals: 1,838 centimetres (60.30 ft) ±5 centimetres (2.0 in)
* Border: 50 centimetres (1.6 ft)

== WAG scoring and rules ==

Floor exercise routines last up to 90 seconds, and there is one timekeeper for this event. The routine is choreographed in advance, and is composed of acrobatic and dance elements. Above all others, this event allows the gymnast to express their personality through their dance and musical style. The moves that are choreographed in the routine must be precise, in sync with the music, and entertaining.

At the international elite level of competition, the composition of the routine is decided by the gymnast and their coaches. Many gymnasiums and national federations hire special choreographers to design routines for their gymnasts. Well-known gymnastics choreographers include Adriana Pop (Romania, France, China), Dominic Zito (United States), and Geza Pozar (Romania, United States). Others opt to choreograph their FX routines in-house. Some gymnasts adopt a new FX yearly; others keep the same routine for several competitive seasons. It is not uncommon for coaches to modify a routine&#x27;s composition between meets, especially if it is used for an extended length of time. It is uncommon for gymnasts to use multiple FX routines in the same season. However, it is not entirely unheard of; for instance, at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Russian Dina Kotchetkova&#x27;s routine in the FX event finals had completely different music, choreography and composition than that of her all-around exercise.

The music used for the routine is also the choice of the gymnast and their coaches. It may be of any known musical style and played with any instrument(s), but it may not include spoken words or sung lyrics. Vocalization is allowed if the voice is purely done as an instrument. It is usually the responsibility of the coach to bring the music to every competition.

Scores are based on difficulty, artistry, demonstration of required elements, and overall performance quality. The score is divided into two pieces, D-score and E-score, which are added together to get the overall score. D-score is a bonus added on to the overall score for the difficulty level of the routine. The D-score is calculated by adding values for the eight most difficult skills, connections, and compositional requirements.

The E-score is based on execution and begins at a value of up to 10.0; deductions are taken for poor form and execution, lack of required elements, and falls. The gymnast is expected to use the entire floor area for their routine and to tumble from one corner of the mat to the other. Steps outside the designated perimeters of the floor incur deductions. The gymnast will also incur a deduction if there are lyrics in the music.

=== International level routines ===
&quot;For detailed information on score tabulation, please see the Code of Points article&quot;

Routines can include up to four tumbling lines and several dance elements, turns, and leaps. A floor routine must consist of at least:

* Connection of two dance elements (one must be a 180 degree split)
* Saltos forward/sideways and backward
* Double saltos
* Saltos with a minimum of one full twist

== MAG scoring and rules ==
Men&#x27;s floor exercise routines are no longer than 70 seconds, and there is one timekeeper for this event. A loud beep will be sounded to alert gymnasts when they have 10 seconds left within the allocated time to finish their routine before receiving a penalty for exceeding the legal time allowed. Routines are typically made up of acrobatic elements combined with other elements that display the gymnast&#x27;s strength and flexibility while using the entire floor area.

As with Women&#x27;s Artistic Gymnastics, scores are based on difficulty, form, and overall performance quality, with the overall score being the addition of the D-score and the E-score. Deductions are taken for lack of flexibility, not using the whole floor area, and pausing before tumbling lines.

=== International level routines ===
A floor routine should contain at least one element from all element groups:
*I. Non-acrobatic elements
*II. Acrobatic elements forward
*III. Acrobatic elements backward, &amp; Arabian elements

The dismount can come from any element group other than group I. Those competing as seniors must include a double salto in their routines.

== Floor exercises in rhythmic gymnastics ==

Floor exercises are also in rhythmic gymnastics for the youngest gymnasts, up to 10 years old, who perform their routines freehand, which means without any apparatus (contrary to the remaining five - rope, hoop, ball, clubs and ribbon). Their length and content are still clearly specified and differ in each age category.

<doc id="82186" wikidata="Q655301" url="?curid=82186" title="Balance beam">
<text>The balance beam is a rectangular artistic gymnastics apparatus and an event performed using the apparatus. The apparatus and the event are sometimes simply called &quot;beam&quot;. The English abbreviation for the event in gymnastics scoring is BB. The balance beam is performed competitively only by female gymnasts.

== The Apparatus==
The beam is a small, thin beam that is typically raised from the floor on a leg or stand at both ends. It is usually covered with leather-like material and is only four inches wide.

Balance beams used in international gymnastics competitions must conform to the guidelines and specifications set forth by the International Gymnastics Federation &quot;Apparatus Norms&quot; brochure. Several companies manufacture and sell beams, including AAI (USA), Janssen-Fritsen (Europe) and Acromat (Australia). Most gymnastics schools purchase and use balance beams that meet the FIG&#x27;s standards, but some may also use beams with carpeted surfaces for practice situations. While learning new skills, gymnasts often work on floor beams with the same dimensions and surface of regulation apparatus but are set a very short distance from or on the ground. They may also work on medium beams, mini beams, road beams, or even lines on a mat.

Originally, the beam surface was plain polished wood. In earlier years, some gymnasts competed on a beam made of basketball-like material. However, this beam type was eventually banned due to its extreme slipperiness. Since the 1980s, beams have been covered in leather or suede. In addition, they are now also sprung to accommodate the stress of high-difficulty tumbling, turns, and poses.

The Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) publishes the apparatus&#x27;s measurements in the &quot;Apparatus Norms&quot; brochure.
*Height: 
*Length: 
*Width: 

== Competition ==
A beam routine must consist of:
*A connection of two dance elements, one a leap, jump, or hop with legs in a 180-degree split
*A full turn on one foot
*One series of two acrobatic skills, one being a salto
*Acrobatic elements in different directions (forward/sideward and backward)
*A dismount

The gymnast may mount the beam using a springboard or from the mat; however, the mount must come from the Code of Points. The routines can last up to 90 seconds.

=== Scoring ===
&quot;For detailed information on score tabulation, please see the Code of Points article.&quot;

Several aspects of the performance determine the gymnast&#x27;s final mark. All elements in the routine, as well as all errors, are noted by the judges.

Deductions are taken for all errors made while on the beam, including lapses in control, balance checks (i.e., wobbling or stumbling to maintain balance), poor technique and execution, and failure to fulfill the required &quot;Code of Points&quot; elements. Falls automatically incur a deduction depending on the level the gymnast is on.

=== Rules ===
The gymnast may compete barefoot or wear special beam shoes if she chooses. She may also chalk her hands and/or feet for added stability on the apparatus. Small markings may also be placed on the beam.

Once the exercise has started, the gymnast&#x27;s coach may not spot her or interfere. The only time the gymnast may be accompanied on the podium is during a mount involving a springboard. In this instance, the coach may quickly remove the springboard from the area.
In the event of a fall, once the athlete is on her feet, she has 10 seconds to remount the beam and continue the routine. If she does not return to the beam within this time limit, she cannot continue.

Under FIG rules, the maximum allowed time for a balance beam routine is 1:30 minutes. The routine is timed on the scoreboard timer, visible to gymnasts and judges. In addition, a warning tone or bell is sounded at 1:20 into the exercise. If the gymnast has not left the beam by 1:30, another bell is sounded, and a score deduction is incurred, which is 0.1.

== History ==

In the early days of women&#x27;s artistic gymnastics, beam was based more on dance than in tumbling. Even at the elite level, routines were composed of combinations of leaps, dance poses, handstands, rolls, and walkovers. In the 1960s, the most difficult acrobatic skill performed by the average Olympic gymnast was a back handspring.

Balance beam difficulty began to increase dramatically in the 1970s. Olga Korbut and Nadia Comăneci pioneered advanced tumbling combinations and aerial skills on beam; other athletes and coaches began to follow suit. The change was also facilitated by transitioning from wooden beams to safer, less slippery models with suede-covered surfaces and elastic padding. By the mid-1980s, top gymnasts routinely performed flight series and multiple aerial elements on beam.

Today, balance beam routines still consist of a mixture of acrobatic skills, dance elements, leaps, and poses, but they are significantly more difficult. It is also an individual medal competition in the Olympics.

<doc id="82187" wikidata="Q1057405" url="?curid=82187" title="List of counties in South Carolina">
<text>The U.S. state of South Carolina is made up of 46 counties, the maximum allowable by state law. They range in size from 392 square miles (1,015 square kilometers) in the case of Calhoun County to 1,358 square miles (3,517 square kilometers) in the case of Charleston County. The least populous county is Allendale County, with only 7,369 residents, while the most populous county is Greenville County, with a population of 558,036, despite the state&#x27;s most populous city, Charleston, being located in Charleston County.

==History==
In the colonial period, the land around the coast was divided into parishes corresponding to the parishes of the Church of England. There were also several counties that had judicial and electoral functions. As people settled the backcountry, judicial districts and additional counties were formed. This structure continued and grew after the Revolutionary War. In 1800, all counties were renamed as districts. In 1868, the districts were converted back to counties. The South Carolina Department of Archives and History has maps that show the boundaries of counties, districts, and parishes starting in 1682.

Historically, county government in South Carolina has been fairly weak. The 1895 Constitution made no provision for local government, effectively reducing counties to creatures of the state. Each county&#x27;s delegation to the General Assembly, comprising one senator and at least one representative, also doubled as its county council. Under this system, the state senator from each county wielded the most power. From the eighteenth century to 1973, counties in South Carolina performed limited functions such as the provision of law enforcement and the construction of transportation infrastructure.

In 1964, the United States Supreme Court case &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; required reapportionment according to the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;, which resulted in legislative districts crossing county lines. However, it was not until 1973 that the constitution was amended to provide for limited home rule at the county level. This was finally enacted in 1975 with the Home Rule Act, which provided for elected councils in each county. Further, in 1989, all counties were given the authority to exercise broad police powers. Thus, they may enact regulations and ordinances related to the provision or preservation of security, health, peace, and order, so long as the regulation is not inconsistent with state law. Nonetheless, all counties and municipalities in South Carolina lack “fiscal home rule,” meaning they may only enact taxes authorized by the General Assembly.

County ordinances become applicable within municipal boundaries when the municipality and the county make a formal agreement, and the municipality formally adopts the ordinance. Unincorporated areas are governed by the county&#x27;s land use plans.

<text>The U.S. state of Texas is divided into 254 counties, more than any other U.S. state. While only about 20% of Texas counties are generally located within the Houston—Dallas—San Antonio—Austin areas, they serve a majority of the state&#x27;s population with approximately 22,000,000 inhabitants.

Texas was originally divided into municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot; in Spanish), a unit of local government under Spanish and Mexican rule. When the Republic of Texas gained its independence in 1836, the 23 municipalities became the original Texas counties. Many of these were later divided into new counties. The last county to be initially created was Kenedy County in 1921, but Loving County is the newest organized county; it was first organized in 1893 in an apparent scheme to defraud, abolished in 1897, then reorganized in 1931. Most of these recent counties, especially near the northwest, were created from Bexar County during the 1870s.

Each county is run by a commissioners&#x27; court, consisting of four elected commissioners (one from each of four precincts drawn based on population) and a county judge elected from all the voters of the county. In smaller counties, the county judge actually does perform judicial duties, but in larger counties, the county judge functions as the county&#x27;s chief executive officer. Certain officials, such as the sheriff and tax collector, are elected separately by the voters, but the commissioners&#x27; court determines their office budgets, and sets overall county policy. All county elections are partisan; the one exception is the board of trustees of the Dallas County department of education (the Harris County trustees were elected on a nonpartisan basis until 1984).

While the counties have eminent domain power and control all unincorporated land within their boundaries, they have neither home-rule authority nor zoning power. The county is responsible for providing essential services (except for fire and ambulance, which are often supplied by volunteer fire departments). Unlike other US states, Texas does not allow for consolidated city-county governments. Cities and counties (as well as other political entities) are permitted to enter &quot;interlocal agreements&quot; to share services (as an example, a city and a school district may enter into agreements with the county whereby the county bills for and collects property taxes for the city and school district; thus, only one tax bill is sent instead of three). School districts are independent of county and city government (with the exception of the Stafford Municipal School District, which is city controlled).

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry. Texas&#x27; code is codice_1, which when combined with any county code would be written in the form of codice_2. The FIPS code for each county in the table links to census data for that county.

==Defunct counties==
There have been at least thirty-two counties established by Texas law that no longer exist. These fall into five categories: judicial counties; counties established by the Constitutional Convention of 1868–69; counties never organized which were abolished by legislative act; counties whose territory is no longer considered part of the state; and counties whose names have been changed.

* Buchel County, formed in 1887 from Presidio County. Annexed in 1897 to Brewster County.
* Dawson County, formed in 1858 in what is now Kinney County and Uvalde County and abolished in 1866 (not to be confused with the present-day Dawson County).
* Encinal County, formed in 1856. Abolished in 1899 and annexed to Webb County.
* Foley County, formed in 1887 from Presidio County. Annexed in 1897 to Brewster County.
* Greer County, formed in 1860. Separated from Texas by U.S. Supreme Court ruling in &quot;United States v. the State of Texas&quot;, and is now part of southwestern Oklahoma.
* Perdido County, formed in 1824 and forgotten during the upheavals of the 1840s. Perdido was reportedly abolished in 1858 and again in 1871. Records of annexation to Dawson County are also inconclusive.
* Santa Fe County, Texas formed in 1848 from lands claimed by the Republic of Texas and ceded by Mexico. It included a vast area later becoming portions of several states from New Mexico east of the Rio Grande extending northward into south-central Wyoming. Within Texas&#x27; modern boundaries, the county included the Trans-Pecos and most of the Panhandle. The county was abolished when Texas ceded its western lands under the Compromise of 1850.
* Wegefarth County, formed in 1873 in the Texas Panhandle and abolished in 1876.
* Worth County, formed in 1850 from part of Santa Fe County. Abolished under the Compromise of 1850 and is now part of east-central New Mexico.
