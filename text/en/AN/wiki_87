He also taught at several universities and institutions. He authored several books on viola technique.

==Biography==

===Early years===
William Primrose was born in Glasgow, Scotland to John Primrose and Margaret McInnis (Whiteside) Primrose. He was the oldest of their three children. His father, John Primrose, taught violin and was part of the Scottish Orchestra. His father bought Primrose his first violin in 1908, when Primrose was only 4 years old. That same year, his father arranged violin lessons with Camillo Ritter, who had studied with Joseph Joachim and Otakar Ševčík. Primrose performed his first public concert on the violin in 1916, at the age of 12, playing Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto. During his childhood, Primrose also enjoyed reading and playing chess in addition to studying music and performing.

In 1919, Primrose&#x27;s family moved to London, and he began to study violin at the Guildhall School of Music in London on scholarship, where he would later be named Fellow. Primrose graduated in 1924, having received its highest honor, a gold medal, although he admitted that he skipped some of his classes because the violin did not interest him.

On the urging of the accompanist Ivor Newton, Primrose moved to Belgium to study under Eugène Ysaÿe from 1926 to 1929. Ysaÿe heard Primrose play an Amati viola that his father had forbidden him to play, and suggested that Primrose pursue the viola instead of the violin.

===London String Quartet===
Primrose became a professional violinist in 1924. In London, on October 2, 1928, William married Dorothy Friend, daughter of Arthur John Friend and Susanna Jane Luscombe. He moved from violin to viola in 1930 when he became the violist of the London String Quartet. He was joined in the group by Warwick Evans, John Pennington, and Thomas Petre. They toured throughout North and South America in the 1930s; however, due to financial pressures of the Great Depression, they disbanded in 1935. After the disbandment of the London String Quartet, Primrose took a variety of jobs; he performed in Berlin, at La Scala in Milan, and a number of concerts in England.

===NBC Orchestra and the Primrose Quartet===

In 1937, NBC established their namesake symphony orchestra under Arturo Toscanini. Primrose was a violist for the orchestra, but he was never their principal violist. He played with the orchestra for four years until it was rumored that Toscanini would leave the Symphony in 1941.

In 1939, NBC suggested that Primrose form his own group, and the Primrose Quartet was founded. The other players (all with the NBC Orchestra at the time) were Oscar Shumsky, Josef Gingold and Harvey Shapiro. Primrose boasted that &quot;no quartet ever played that had the instrumental ability of my quartet&quot;. The Primrose Quartet was short-lived, but recorded three sets of commercial 78s for RCA, along with a few unissued recordings.

While performing with the NBC Symphony, Primrose also made recordings with Jascha Heifetz and Gregor Piatigorsky. However, they stopped playing together in 1964 due to Primrose&#x27;s declining hearing and his increased absences due to his teaching career.

===Soloist===
Primrose made his debut as a violin soloist in 1923; however his soloist career playing the viola didn&#x27;t take off until 1941 when he started touring with Richard Crooks. He accompanied Crooks on five tours in the next four years, playing in 32 concerts in 1941–1942. While touring with Crooks, Arthur Judson, an influential concert manager, sought out Primrose. He signed with Judson who furthered Primrose&#x27;s soloist career. Primrose doubled his concert performances, playing in 64 concerts in 1943–1944.

In 1944, he was the soloist in the first studio recording of Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Harold in Italy&quot; with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Serge Koussevitzky.That same year, he commissioned a viola concerto from Béla Bartók. This was left incomplete at Bartók&#x27;s death in 1945, and had to wait four years for its completion by Tibor Serly.Primrose was the soloist in the world premiere performance of the concerto in America, on 2 December 1949, with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra and Antal Doráti conducting.He gave the European premiere at the Edinburgh Festival in 1950 with Sir John Barbirolli and The Hallé orchestra. In 1950, Benjamin Britten wrote for him &quot;Lachrymae&quot; based on the song by Dowland.

Primrose was known for his tremendous technique. When he performed Paganini&#x27;s violin caprices on viola, Mischa Elman is said to have exclaimed, &quot;It must be easier on viola!&quot; Primrose wrote many transcriptions and arrangements for viola, often technically dazzling, including &quot;La Campanella&quot; (from Paganini&#x27;s second violin concerto) and the famous &quot;Nocturne&quot; from Borodin&#x27;s second string quartet, the latter &quot;out of jealousy&quot; for the cello&#x27;s long melodic lines.

He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1952, in recognition of his musical contributions.

===Teacher===
Primrose was also a teacher during his violist career. He taught in many countries across the world, including the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He taught at the University of Southern California from 1961 to 1965 with Jascha Heifetz. After teaching at USC, he moved to the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music where he remained from 1965 to 1972. In 1971, Primrose went to the Tokyo University of the Arts and the Toho Gakuen School of Music. He occasionally taught at Juilliard School, Eastman School of Music and the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, In Australia, Richard Tognetti was one of his students. Primrose was a guest lecturer at Brigham Young University from 1979 to 1982.

Primrose wrote and contributed to several books on viola playing: &quot;Art and Practice of Scale Playing&quot; (1954), &quot;Technique is Memory&quot; (1960), &quot;Violin and Viola&quot; (with Yehudi Menuhin and Denis Stevens, 1976), and &quot;Playing the Viola&quot; (1988).

Some of his notable students include Canadian violinist Albert Pratz, former principal of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Alan de Veritch, the American composer David Campbell, and Olympic Music Festival founder and violist Alan Iglitzin.

Other notable pupils include, Martha Strongin Katz, Karen Tuttle, Joseph de Pasquale and Cynthia Phelps.

===Later years===
Primrose had developed a hearing problem in 1946 which affected his ability to hear certain notes. He was later diagnosed with cancer in 1977, from which he died in Provo, Utah on 1 May 1982.

===Legacy===
*Primrose&#x27;s large collection of annotated viola scores became the nucleus for the William Primrose International Viola Archive at the Harold B. Lee Library at Brigham Young University.
*For his contribution to the recording industry, Primrose has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles.
*The Primrose International Viola Competition, created in 1979 in honor of William Primrose, was the first international music competition for viola players.
*The Primrose Piano Quartet, a British ensemble formed in 2004, is named after him.

==Instruments==
===Primrose Amati viola===
For the first part of his career, Primrose played an Amati viola, formerly owned by his father. Primrose had noted that the viola had a wolf tone and did not project easily. He sold the Amati viola in 1951. The ex-Primrose Amati is now owned by Roberto Díaz, who is currently the president of the Curtis Institute of Music and recorded a CD of Primrose&#x27;s transcriptions for Naxos Records. Prior to the recording, the viola was inspected and was found to have had adjustments of questionable workmanship, which were subsequently repaired.

===The Primrose Guarneri viola===

In 1954, Primrose purchased the 1697 Guarneri viola now known as the ex-Primrose. This viola is one of seven known Guarneri family violas. It bears an original label of Andrea Guarneri who died in 1698, but experts believe that the work is that of his son Joseph Guarneri &#x27;filius Andreae&#x27; who inherited his father&#x27;s workshop. The back of the viola is Italian maple and the front is open-grained spruce. It has a deep golden varnish with a subtle orange tint.

The viola was purchased by the Earl of Harrington in 1874. It was acquired by the Rembert Wurlitzer Company in the 1950s and came to Primrose&#x27;s attention. It became his solo instrument. Before Primrose, the instrument had never been owned by a professional violist. In 1975 or 1978 Primrose sold the Guarneri viola to Gary Vandosdale, a former student. It was then sold in 1978 to Ulrich Fritze, who played the viola during his 30-year tenure as principal violist of the Berlin Philharmonic. The viola was sold in 2012 by Tarisio &quot;for over $4 million, the highest price paid for a Guarneri family instrument at auction and the highest publicly recorded price for a viola of any type&quot;.

===Other instruments===
Primrose was also known to have owned two violas by William Moennig Jr. of Philadelphia. Primrose used the &quot;MacDonald&quot; Stradivari on loan during the 1940s. His Pierre Vidoudez and Yu Iida violas are currently on display in the Primrose International Viola Archive at Brigham Young University&#x27;s Harold B. Lee Library in Provo, Utah.

<doc id="83427" wikidata="Q7565" url="?curid=83427" title="Father">
<text>A father is the male parent of a child. Besides the paternal bonds of a father to his children, the father may have a parental, legal, and social relationship with the child that carries with it certain rights and obligations. A biological father is the male genetic contributor to the creation of the infant, through sexual intercourse or sperm donation. A biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him, such as an obligation of monetary support. An adoptive father is a man who has become the child&#x27;s parent through the legal process of adoption. A putative father is a man whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established. A [[stepfather]] is a non-biological male parent married to a child&#x27;s preexisting parent and may form a family unit but generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child.

The adjective &quot;paternal&quot; refers to a father and comparatively to &quot;maternal&quot; for a mother. The verb &quot;to father&quot; means to procreate or to sire a child from which also derives the noun &quot;fathering&quot;. Biological fathers determine the sex of their child through a sperm cell which either contains an X chromosome (female), or Y chromosome (male). Related terms of endearment are &quot;dad&quot; (&quot;dada&quot;, &quot;daddy&quot;), &quot;baba, papa&quot;, &quot;pappa&quot;, papasita, (&quot;pa&quot;, &quot;pap&quot;) and &quot;pop&quot;. A male role model that children can look up to is sometimes referred to as a &quot;father-figure&quot;.

== Responsible and positive parenting ==
In today&#x27;s world, the terms responsible parenting and positive parenting are often used.

UNICEF distinguishes the term &quot;positive parenting&quot;.

Positive parenting is parenting that creates an environment conducive to child development that prioritizes healthy parent-child relationships. 

Responsible parenting is parenting that implies the fulfillment of the functions assigned to them by parents and is manifested in individual and social aspects, includes raising children, as well as taking into account the stage before the birth of a child, maintaining family relations with already adult children.

==Paternal rights==

The paternity rights of a father with regard to his children differ widely from country to country often reflecting the level of involvement and roles expected by that society.

Unlike motherhood, fatherhood is not mentioned in Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

;Paternity leave
Parental leave is when a father takes time off to support his newly born or adopted baby. Paid paternity leave first began in Sweden in 1976, and is paid in more than half of European Union countries. In the case of male same-sex couples the law often makes no provision for either one or both fathers to take paternity leave.

;Child custody
Fathers&#x27; rights movements such as Fathers 4 Justice argue that family courts are biased against fathers.

;Child support
Child support is an ongoing periodic payment made by one parent to the other; it is normally paid by the parent who does not have custody.

;Paternity fraud
An estimated 2% of British fathers experiences paternity fraud during a non-paternity event, bringing up a child they wrongly believe to be their biological offspring.

==Role of the father==

In almost all cultures fathers are regarded as secondary caregivers. This perception is slowly changing with more and more fathers becoming primary caregivers, while mothers go to work, or in single parenting situations and male same-sex parenting couples.

=== Fatherhood in the Western World ===

In the West, the image of the married father as the primary wage-earner is changing. The social context of fatherhood plays an important part in the well-being of men and their children. In the United States 16% of single parents were men as of 2013.

=== Importance of father or father-figure ===
Involved fathers offer developmentally specific provisions to their children and are impacted themselves by doing so. Active father figures may play a role in reducing behavior and psychological problems in young adults. An increased amount of father–child involvement may help increase a child&#x27;s social stability, educational achievement, and their potential to have a solid marriage as an adult. Their children may also be more curious about the world around them and develop greater problem-solving skills. Children who were raised with fathers perceive themselves to be more cognitively and physically competent than their peers without a father. Mothers raising children together with a father reported less severe disputes with their child.

The father-figure is not always a child&#x27;s biological father, and some children will have a biological father as well as a step- or nurturing father. When a child is conceived through sperm donation, the donor will be the &quot;biological father&quot; of the child.

Fatherhood as legitimate identity can be dependent on domestic factors and behaviors. For example, a study of the relationship between fathers, their sons, and home computers found that the construction of fatherhood and masculinity required that fathers display computer expertise.

==Determination of parenthood==
Roman law defined fatherhood as &quot;Mater semper certa; pater est quem nuptiae demonstrant&quot; (&quot;The [identity of the] mother is always certain; the father is whom the marriage vows indicate&quot;). The recent emergence of accurate scientific testing, particularly DNA testing, has resulted in the family law relating to fatherhood experiencing rapid changes.

== History of fatherhood ==
Many male animals do not participate in the rearing of their young. The development of human men as creatures which are involved in their offspring&#x27;s upbringing took place during the stone age.

In medieval and most of modern European history, caring for children was predominantly the domain of mothers, whereas fathers in many societies provide for the family as a whole. Since the 1950s, social scientists and feminists have increasingly challenged gender roles in Western countries, including that of the male breadwinner. Policies are increasingly targeting fatherhood as a tool of changing gender relations. Research from various societies suggest that since the middle of the 20th century fathers have become increasingly involved in the care of their children.

==Patricide==
In early human history there have been notable instances of patricide. For example:
* Tukulti-Ninurta I (r. 1243–1207 B.C.E.), Assyrian king, was killed by his own son after sacking Babylon.
* Sennacherib (r. 704–681 B.C.E.), Assyrian king, was killed by two of his sons for his desecration of Babylon.
* King Kassapa I (473 to 495 CE) creator of the Sigiriya citadel of ancient Sri Lanka killed his father king Dhatusena for the throne.
* Emperor Yang of Sui in Chinese history allegedly killed his father, Emperor Wen of Sui.
* Beatrice Cenci, Italian noblewoman who, according to legend, killed her father after he imprisoned and raped her. She was condemned and beheaded for the crime along with her brother and her stepmother in 1599.
* Lizzie Borden (1860–1927) allegedly killed her father and her stepmother with an axe in Fall River, Massachusetts, in 1892. She was acquitted, but her innocence is still disputed.
* Iyasus I of Ethiopia (1654–1706), one of the great warrior emperors of Ethiopia, was deposed by his son in 1706 and subsequently assassinated.

In more contemporary history there have also been instances of father–offspring conflicts, such as:

* Chiyo Aizawa (born 1939) murdered her own father who had been raping her for fifteen years, on October 5, 1968, in Japan. The incident changed the Criminal Code of Japan regarding patricide.
* Kip Kinkel (born 1982), an Oregon boy who was convicted of killing his parents at home and two fellow students at school on May 20, 1998.
* Sarah Marie Johnson (born 1987), an Idaho girl who was convicted of killing both parents on the morning of September 2, 2003.
* Dipendra of Nepal (1971–2001) reportedly massacred much of his family at a royal dinner on June 1, 2001, including his father King Birendra, mother, brother, and sister.
* Christopher Porco (born 1983), was convicted on August 10, 2006, of the murder of his father and attempted murder of his mother with an axe.

==Terminology==

===Biological fathers===

* Baby Daddya biological father who bears financial responsibility for a child, but with whom the mother has little or no contact.
* Birth fatherthe biological father of a child who, due to adoption or parental separation, does not raise the child or cannot take care of one.
* Biological father or sometimes simply referred to as &quot;Father&quot; is the genetic father of a child.
* Posthumous fatherfather died before children were born (or even conceived in the case of artificial insemination).
* Putative fatherunwed man whose legal relationship to a child has not been established but who is alleged to be or claims that he may be the biological father of a child.
* Sperm donoran anonymous or known biological father who provides his sperm to be used in artificial insemination or in vitro fertilisation in order to father a child for a third-party female. Also used as a slang term meaning &quot;baby daddy&quot;.
* Surprise fatherwhere the men did not know that there was a child until possibly years afterward
* Teenage father/youthful fatherfather who is still a teenager.

===Non-biological (social and legal relationship)===
* Adoptive fatherthe father who has adopted a child
* Cuckolded fatherwhere the child is the product of the mother&#x27;s adulterous relationship
* DI Dadsocial/legal father of children produced via Donor Insemination (where a donor&#x27;s sperm were used to impregnate the DI Dad&#x27;s partner)
* Father-in-lawthe father of one&#x27;s spouse
* Foster fatherchild is raised by a man who is not the biological or adoptive father
* Mother&#x27;s partnerassumption that current partner fills father role
* Mother&#x27;s husbandunder some jurisdictions (e.g., in Quebec civil law), if the mother is married to another man, the latter will be defined as the father
* Presumed fatherwhere a presumption of paternity has determined that a man is a child&#x27;s father regardless of if he actually is or is not the biological father
* Social fatherwhere a man takes &quot;de facto&quot; responsibility for a child, such as caring for one who has been abandoned or orphaned (the child is known as a &quot;child of the family&quot; in English law)
* Stepfathera married non-biological father where the child is from a previous relationship

===Fatherhood defined by contact level===
* Absent fatherfather who cannot or will not spend time with his child(ren)
* Second fathera non-parent whose contact and support is robust enough that near parental bond occurs (often used for older male siblings who significantly aid in raising a child, sometimes for older men who took care of younger friends (only males) who have no families)
* Stay-at-home dadthe male equivalent of a housewife with child, where his spouse is breadwinner
* Weekend/holiday fatherwhere child(ren) only stay(s) with father on weekends, holidays, etc.

==Non-human fatherhood==
For some animals, it is the fathers who take care of the young.
* Darwin&#x27;s frog (&quot;Rhinoderma darwini&quot;) fathers carry eggs in the vocal pouch.
* Most male waterfowl are very protective in raising their offspring, sharing scout duties with the female. Examples are the geese, swans, gulls, loons, and a few species of ducks. When the families of most of these waterfowl travel, they usually travel in a line and the fathers are usually the ones guarding the offspring at the end of the line while the mothers lead the way.
* The female seahorse (&quot;Hippocampus&quot;) deposits eggs into the pouch on the male&#x27;s abdomen. The male releases sperm into the pouch, fertilizing the eggs. The embryos develop within the male&#x27;s pouch, nourished by their individual yolk sacs.
* Male catfish keep their eggs in their mouth, foregoing eating until they hatch.
* Male emperor penguins alone incubate their eggs; females do no incubation. Rather than building a nest, each male protects his egg by balancing it on the tops of his feet, enclosed in a special brood pouch. Once the eggs are hatched, the females will rejoin the family.
* Male beavers secure their offspring along with the females during their first few hours of their lives. As the young beavers mature, their fathers will teach them how to search for materials to build and repair their own dams, before they disperse to find their own mates.
* Wolf fathers help feed, protect, and play with their pups. In some cases, several generations of wolves live in the pack, giving pups the care of grandparents, aunts/uncles, and siblings, in addition to parents. The father wolf is also the one who does most of the hunting when the females are securing their newborn pups.
* Coyotes are monogamous and male coyotes hunt and bring food to their young.
* Dolphin fathers help in the care of the young. Newborns are held on the surface of the water by both parents until they are ready to swim on their own.
* A number of bird species have active, caring fathers who assist the mothers, such as the waterfowls mentioned above.
* Apart from humans, fathers in few primate species care for their young. Those that do are tamarins and marmosets. Particularly strong care is also shown by siamangs where fathers carry infants after their second year. In titi and owl monkeys fathers carry their infants 90% of the time with &quot;titi monkey infants developing a preference for their fathers over their mothers&quot;. Silverback gorillas have less role in the families but most of them serve as an extra protecting the families from harm and sometimes approaching enemies to distract them so that his family can escape unnoticed.

Many species, though, display little or no paternal role in caring for offspring. The male leaves the female soon after mating and long before any offspring are born. It is the females who must do all the work of caring for the young.
* A male bear leaves the female shortly after mating and will kill and sometimes eat any bear cub he comes across, even if the cub is his. Bear mothers spend much of their cubs&#x27; early life protecting them from males. (Many artistic works, such as advertisements and cartoons, depict kindly &quot;papa bears&quot; when this is the exact opposite of reality.)
* Domesticated dog fathers show little interest in their offspring, and unlike wolves, are not monogamous with their mates and are thus likely to leave them after mating.
* Male lions will tolerate cubs, but only allow them to eat meat from dead prey after they have had their fill. A few are quite cruel towards their young and may hurt or kill them with little provocation. A male who kills another male to take control of his pride will also usually kill any cubs belonging to that competing male. However, it is also the males who are responsible for guarding the pride while the females hunt. However, the male lions are the only felines that actually have a role in fatherhood.
* Male rabbits generally tolerate kits but unlike the females, they often show little interest in the kits and are known to play rough with their offspring when they are mature, especially towards their sons. This behaviour may also be part of an instinct to drive the young males away to prevent incest matings between the siblings. The females will eventually disperse from the warren as soon as they mature but the father does not drive them off like he normally does to the males.
* Horse stallions and pig boars have little to no role in parenting, nor are they monogamous with their mates. They will tolerate young to a certain extent, but due to their aggressive male nature, they are generally annoyed by the energetic exuberance of the young and may hurt or even kill the young. Thus, stud stallions and boars are not kept in the same pen as their young or other females.

Finally, in some species neither the father nor the mother provides any care.
* This is true for most insects, reptiles, and fish.

<text>A mother is the female parent of a child. A woman may be considered a mother by virtue of having given birth, by raising a child who may or may not be her biological offspring, or by supplying her ovum for fertilisation in the case of gestational surrogacy.

A biological mother is the female genetic contributor to the creation of the infant, through sexual intercourse or egg donation. A biological mother may have legal obligations to a child not raised by her, such as an obligation of monetary support. An adoptive mother is a female who has become the child&#x27;s parent through the legal process of adoption. A putative mother is a female whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established. A stepmother is a non-biological female parent married to a child&#x27;s preexisting parent, and may form a family unit but generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child.

A father is the male counterpart of a mother. Women who are pregnant may be referred to as expectant mothers or mothers-to-be. The process of becoming a mother has been referred to as &quot;matrescence&quot;.

The adjective &quot;maternal&quot; refers to a mother and comparatively to &quot;paternal&quot; for a father. The verb &quot;to mother&quot; means to procreate or to sire a child, or to provide care for a child, from which also derives the noun &quot;mothering&quot;. Related terms of endearment are &quot;mom&quot; (&quot;mama&quot;, &quot;mommy&quot;), &quot;mum&quot; (&quot;mummy&quot;), &quot;mumsy&quot;, &quot;mamacita&quot; (&quot;ma&quot;, &quot;mam&quot;) and &quot;mammy&quot;. A female role model that children can look up to is sometimes referred to as a &quot;mother-figure&quot;.

==Types of motherhood==

=== Biological mother ===
Biological motherhood for humans, as in other mammals, occurs when a pregnant female gestates a fertilized ovum (the &quot;egg&quot;). A female can become pregnant through sexual intercourse after she has begun to ovulate. In well-nourished girls, menarche (the first menstrual period) usually takes place around the age of 12 or 13.

Typically, a fetus develops from the viable zygote, resulting in an embryo. Gestation occurs in the woman&#x27;s uterus until the fetus (assuming it is carried to term) is sufficiently developed to be born. In humans, gestation is often around 9 months in duration, after which the woman experiences labor and gives birth. This is not always the case, however, as some babies are born prematurely, late, or in the case of stillbirth, do not survive gestation. Usually, once the baby is born, the mother produces milk via the lactation process. The mother&#x27;s breast milk is the source of antibodies for the infant&#x27;s immune system, and commonly the sole source of nutrition for newborns before they are able to eat and digest other foods; older infants and toddlers may continue to be breastfed, in combination with other foods, which should be introduced from approximately six months of age.

Childlessness is the state of not having children. Childlessness may have personal, social or political significance. Childlessness may be voluntary childlessness, which occurs by choice, or may be involuntary due to health problems or social circumstances. Motherhood is usually voluntary, but may also be the result of forced pregnancy, such as pregnancy from rape. Unwanted motherhood occurs especially in cultures which practice forced marriage and child marriage.

=== Non-biological mother ===
&quot;Mother&quot; can often apply to a woman other than the biological parent, especially if she fulfills the main social role in raising the child. This is commonly either an adoptive mother or a stepmother (the biologically unrelated partner of a child&#x27;s father). The term &quot;othermother&quot; or &quot;other mother&quot; is also used in some contexts for women who provide care for a child not biologically their own in addition to the child&#x27;s primary mother.

Adoption, in various forms, has been practiced throughout history, even predating human civilization. Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be governed by comprehensive statutes and regulations. In recent decades, international adoptions have become more and more common.

Adoption in the United States is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared to other Western countries). In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the US accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.

===Surrogate mother===

A surrogate mother is a woman who bears a child that came from another woman&#x27;s fertilized ovum on behalf of a couple unable to give birth to children. Thus the surrogate mother carries and gives birth to a child that she is not the biological mother of. Surrogate motherhood became possible with advances in reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization.

Not all women who become pregnant via in vitro fertilization are surrogate mothers. Surrogacy involves both a genetic mother, who provides the ovum, and a gestational (or surrogate) mother, who carries the child to term.

=== Lesbian and bisexual motherhood ===
The possibility for lesbian and bisexual women in same-sex relationships to become mothers has increased over the past few decades due to technological developments. Modern lesbian parenting originated with women who were in heterosexual relationships who later identified as lesbian or bisexual, as changing attitudes provided more acceptance for non-heterosexual relationships. Other ways for such women to become mothers is through adopting, foster parenting or in vitro fertilization.

=== Transgender motherhood ===

Transgender women may have biological children with a partner by utilizing their sperm to fertilize an egg and form an embryo. For transgender women, there is currently no accessible way to carry a child. However, research is being done on uterus transplants, which could potentially allow transgender women to carry and give birth to children through Caesarean section. Other types of motherhood include adoption or foster parenting. However, adoption agencies often refuse to work with transgender parents or are reluctant to do so.

==Social role==


The social roles associated with motherhood are variable across time, culture, and social class. Historically, the role of women was confined to some extent to being a mother and wife, with women being expected to dedicate most of their energy to these roles, and to spend most of their time taking care of the home. In many cultures, women received significant help in performing these tasks from older female relatives, such as mothers in law or their own mothers.
Regarding women in the workforce, mothers are said to often follow a &quot;mommy track&quot; rather than being entirely &quot;career women&quot;. Mothers may be stay at home mothers or working mothers. In recent decades there has been an increase in stay at home fathers too. Social views on these arrangements vary significantly by culture: in Europe for instance, in German-speaking countries there is a strong tradition of mothers exiting the workforce and being homemakers. Mothers have historically fulfilled the primary role in raising children, but since the late 20th century, the role of the father in child care has been given greater prominence and social acceptance in some Western countries. The 20th century also saw more and more women entering paid work. Mothers&#x27; rights within the workforce include maternity leave and parental leave.

The social role and experience of motherhood varies greatly depending upon location. Mothers are more likely than fathers to encourage assimilative and communion-enhancing patterns in their children. Mothers are more likely than fathers to acknowledge their children&#x27;s contributions in conversation. The way mothers speak to their children (&quot;motherese&quot;) is better suited to support very young children in their efforts to understand speech (in context of the reference English) than fathers.

Since the 1970s, in vitro fertilization has made pregnancy possible at ages well beyond &quot;natural&quot; limits, generating ethical controversy and forcing significant changes in the social meaning of motherhood. This is, however, a position highly biased by Western world locality: outside the Western world, in-vitro fertilization has far less prominence, importance or currency compared to primary, basic healthcare, women&#x27;s basic health, reducing infant mortality and the prevention of life-threatening diseases such as polio, typhus and malaria.

Traditionally, and still in most parts of the world today, a mother was expected to be a married woman, with birth outside of marriage carrying a strong social stigma. Historically, this stigma not only applied to the mother, but also to her child. This continues to be the case in many parts of the developing world today, but in many Western countries the situation has changed radically, with single motherhood being much more socially acceptable now. For more details on these subjects, see Legitimacy (family law) and single parent.

The total fertility rate (TFR), that is, the number of children born per woman, differs greatly from country to country. The TFR in 2013 was estimated to be highest in Niger (7.03 children born per woman) and lowest in Singapore (0.79 children/woman).

In the United States, the TFR was estimated for 2013 at 2.06 births per woman. In 2011, the average age at first birth was 25.6 and 40.7% of births were to unmarried women.

==Health==


A &quot;maternal death&quot; is defined by WHO as &quot;the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes&quot;.

About 56% of maternal deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa and another 29% in South Asia.

In 2006, the organization Save the Children has ranked the countries of the world, and found that Scandinavian countries are the safest places to give birth, whereas countries in sub-Saharan Africa are the least safe to give birth. This study argues a mother in the bottom ten ranked countries is over 750 times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth, compared to a mother in the top ten ranked countries, and a mother in the bottom ten ranked countries is 28 times more likely to see her child die before reaching their first birthday.

The most recent data suggests that Italy, Sweden and Luxembourg are the safest countries in terms of maternal death and Afghanistan, Central African Republic and Malawi are the most dangerous.

Childbirth can be a dangerous process in the absence of effective measures to reduce death. When none of these measure are taken, the maternal death rate has been estimated as being within the order of magnitude of 1,500 deaths per 100,000 births. Modern medicine has greatly alleviated the risk of childbirth. In modern Western countries the current maternal mortality rate is around 10 deaths per 100,000 births.

==Religious==
Nearly all world religions define tasks or roles for mothers through either religious law or through the glorification of mothers who served in substantial religious events. There are many examples of religious law relating to mothers and women.

Major world religions which have specific religious law or religious texts that comment on mothers include: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Some examples of honoring motherhood include the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary as Mother of God and the multiple positive references to active womanhood as a mother in the Book of Proverbs.

Hindu&#x27;s Mother Goddess and Demeter of ancient Greek pre-Christian belief are also mothers.

==Mother-offspring violence==

History records many conflicts between mothers and their children. Some even resulted in murder, such as the conflict between Cleopatra III of Egypt and her son Ptolemy X.

In modern cultures, matricide (the killing of one&#x27;s mother) and filicide (the killing of one&#x27;s son or daughter) have been studied but remain poorly understood. Psychosis and schizophrenia are common causes of both, and young, indigent mothers with a history of domestic abuse are slightly more likely to commit filicide. Mothers are more likely to commit filicide than fathers when the child is 8 years old or younger. Matricide is most frequently committed by adult sons.

In the United States in 2012, there were 130 matricides (0.4 per million people) and 383 filicides (1.2 per million), or 1.4 incidents per day.

==In art==


Throughout history, mothers have been depicted in a variety of art works, including paintings, sculptures and written texts, that have helped define the cultural meaning of &#x27;mother&#x27;, as well as ideals and taboos of motherhood.

Fourth century grave reliefs on the island of Rhodes depicted mothers with children.

Paintings of mothers with their children have a long tradition in France. In the 18th century, these works embodied the Enlightenment&#x27;s preoccupation with strong family bonds and the relation between mothers and children.

At the end of the nineteenth century, Mary Cassatt was a painter well known for her portraits of mothers.

American poet, essayist and feminist Adrienne Rich has noted &quot;the disjuncture between motherhood as patriarchal institution and motherhood as complexly and variously lived experience&quot;. The vast majority of works depicting motherhood in western art history have been created by artists who are men, with very few having been created by women or mothers themselves, and these often focus on the &quot;institution of motherhood&quot; rather than diverse lived experiences. At the same time, art concerning motherhood has been historically marginalized within the feminist art movement, though this is changing with an increasing number of feminist publications addressing this topic.

The institution of motherhood in western art is often depicted through &quot;the myth of the all-loving, all-forgiving and all-sacrificing mother&quot; and related ideals. Examples include works featuring the Virgin Mary, an archetypal mother and a key historical basis for depictions of mothers in western art from the European Renaissance onwards. Mothers depicted in dominant art works are also primarily white, heterosexual, middle class and young or attractive.

These ideals of motherhood have been challenged by artists with lived experience as mothers. An example in western contemporary art is Mary Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Post-Partum Document&quot;. Bypassing typical themes of tenderness or nostalgia, this work documents in extensive detail the challenges, complexities and day-to-day realities of the mother-child relationship. Other artists have addressed similar aspects of motherhood that fall outside dominant ideals, including maternal ambivalence, desire, and the pursuit of self-fulfillment.   While the ideal of maternal self-sacrifice and the &#x27;good mother&#x27; forms an important part of many works of art relating to the Holocaust, other women&#x27;s Holocaust and post-Holocaust art has engaged more deeply with mothers&#x27; trauma, taboos, and the experiences of second and third-generation Holocaust survivors. For example, works by first-generation survivors of the Holocaust such as Ella Liebermann-Shiber and Shoshana Neuman have depicted mothers abandoning and suffocating their children in an effort to stay alive themselves.

Increasingly diverse representations of motherhood can be found in contemporary works of art. Catherine Opie&#x27;s self-portrait photographs, including of herself nursing, reference the existing Virgin Mary archetype while subverting its norms around sexuality by centering her identity as a lesbian. Rather than attempting to make her experience of motherhood fit into existing norms, Opie&#x27;s photographs are &quot;non-traditional and non-apologetic representations&quot;.

In her 2020 photography collection, Solana Cain explored the meaning of joy for Black mothers to challenge the lack of images in mainstream media that represent Black motherhood. Renee Cox&#x27;s &quot;Yo Mama&quot; series of nude self-portraits challenge historical representations of both the black female body and of maternity and slavery in the US, the latter of which is often characterized by the &quot;extreme passivity and devalued love&quot; typically associated with motherhood.

==Synonyms and translations==

===Etymology===

The modern English word is from Middle English moder, from Old English mōdor, from Proto-Germanic *mōdēr (cf. East Frisian muur, Dutch moeder, German Mutter), from Proto-Indo-European *méh₂tēr (cf. Irish máthair, Tocharian A mācar, B mācer, Lithuanian mótė).

* Eve
* Gaia
* Isis
* Jocasta
* Juno

== Zoology ==
In zoology, particularly in mammals, a mother fills many similar biological functions as a human mother.

=== Mammals ===
Many other mammal mothers also have numerous commonalities with humans.

==== Primates ====
The behavior and role of mothers in non-human species is most similar in species most closely related to humans. This means great apes are most similar, then the broader superfamily of all apes, then all primates.

<text>Dad is a BBC1 sitcom that ran for 13 episodes (each 30 minutes long) over two series and a Christmas special. Described by the BBC as a &#x27;generation-gap comedy&#x27;, it centered on the trials and tribulations of Alan Hook (Kevin McNally) and his father Brian (George Cole). Alan would often find himself getting increasingly frustrated with the endeavours of his father, whilst the world seemed to be forever against him.

Toby Ross-Bryant played Alan&#x27;s son Vincent, and Julia Hills played Alan&#x27;s wife Beryl. It was written by Andrew Marshall, who was best known for his popular sitcom, &quot;2point4 Children&quot;. The title of each episode was a pun on the word &quot;Dad&quot;.

The theme tune for the first series was the 1965 hit &#x27;Tijuana Taxi&#x27; performed by Herb Alpert &amp; the Tijuana Brass. For the second series, this was replaced with the song &#x27;Go Daddy-O&#x27; by California swing revival band, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.

* George Cole as Brian Hook
* Toby Ross-Bryant as Vincent Hook
* Julia Hills as Beryl Hook&lt;br&gt;Initially, due to Julia Hills being in &quot;2point4 Children&quot;, which was still running at the time of the first series of &quot;Dad&quot; being broadcast, the BBC didn&#x27;t want her to be in it. However, after her audition, any fears and doubts were quickly quashed.

==Plot==
Alan Hook is a highly-strung and often unfortunate individual, constantly getting frustrated with the endeavours of his father Brian, and forever venting his anger at the world around him. His long-suffering wife Beryl tries her best to keep her husband calm, though this proves difficult due to Brian, who, without meaning to, is always getting on his son&#x27;s nerves with his over engineered ideas, and old fashioned ways.

Then there is Alan&#x27;s own son Vincent, a typical moody teenager who Alan seems to be forever embarrassing.

==Episodes==

===Series overview===

===Series 1 (1997)===
The theme tune for the first series was the 1965 hit &quot;Tijuana Taxi&quot; performed by Herb Alpert &amp; the Tijuana Brass. The first episode was shot as part of a handful of pilots for various shows, and was then one of the few chosen to be made into a full series. Alan&#x27;s house in series one differs to that in series two; the director wanted a bigger set for the kitchen, to fit more cameras in, hence the house move.

===Series 2 (1999)===
For the second series the theme song was &#x27;Go Daddy-O&#x27; by Californian swing revival band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.
Series Two also comprised six episodes and was first aired from 11 January to 15 February 1999, but this time on Mondays at 8.30 pm. The episodes were entitled (in order of their airing):

===Christmas Special (1999)===
The final episode was a Christmas special that aired on 21 December 1999, this time a Tuesday, at 8.30 pm. It broke with the tradition of punning on &#x27;Dad&#x27; for the title, and was named &#x27;Nemesis&#x27;, although Andrew Marshall later revealed that the original title &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot; was nixed by the BBC, feeling it too obscure.
==Reception==

The show received less critical acclaim than the similar BBC family sitcom &quot;2point4 Children&quot;, also written by Andrew Marshall.

==Cancellation==

During the second series, writer Andrew Marshall was convinced the show would go to a third series. Kevin McNally also believed they&#x27;d be doing the show for quite a while. However, after 13 episodes, and despite going from strength to strength, &quot;Dad&quot; ended with a 1999 Christmas special. McNally commented that the show got &#x27;somehow lost&#x27;, and its cancellation was to do with a regime change at the BBC. George Cole believed the show&#x27;s cancellation was down to focus groups that began to decide what TV shows should be axed.

==Home release==

Both series one and two are available on DVD in Australia; they were released by &#x27;Madman&#x27;. Both DVDs come with special features, one of which is an audio commentary from George Cole and Kevin McNally who discuss the show; it hasn&#x27;t been released in the United States or UK, and it also isn&#x27;t repeated on TV in these two countries.

The show is streamed via tubi.

==Trivia==
The estate agent named on the &#x27;for sale&#x27; signs in the first episode of series 2 are called &#x27;Renwick&#x27;; a nod to Andrew Marshall&#x27;s ex-writing partner, David Renwick.

<doc id="83440" wikidata="Q43510" url="?curid=83440" title="Nightwish">
<text>Nightwish is a Finnish symphonic metal band from Kitee. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and former lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, &quot;Angels Fall First&quot; (1997). In 2001, Vänskä was replaced by Marko Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. Although Nightwish have been prominent in their home country since &quot;Angels Fall First&quot;, they did not achieve wider success until the release of the albums &quot;Oceanborn&quot; (1998), &quot;Wishmaster&quot; (2000) and &quot;Century Child&quot; (2002).

Their 2004 album, &quot;Once&quot;, has sold more than one million copies and was the band&#x27;s breakthrough in the United States. Their biggest US hit single, &quot;Wish I Had an Angel&quot; (2004), received MTV airplay and was included on three US film soundtracks. The band produced three more singles and two music videos for &quot;Once&quot;, as well as a re-recording of &quot;Sleeping Sun&quot; for the compilation album, &quot;Highest Hopes: The Best of Nightwish&quot; (2005), before Turunen&#x27;s dismissal in October 2005. In May 2007, Nightwish announced Anette Olzon as Turunen&#x27;s replacement. That September, the band released their sixth album, &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot;, which has sold almost 2 million copies. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Amaranth&quot;, became one of Nightwish&#x27;s most successful in Europe. Their seventh studio album, &quot;Imaginaerum&quot;, was released in November 2011. Nightwish parted ways with Olzon in October 2012 and finished the tour with Floor Jansen, who later became a permanent member of the band alongside longtime session uilleann pipes player Troy Donockley in October 2013.

In July 2019, Nevalainen, who had been inactive since 2014 due to severe insomnia, announced that he would not be returning to the band, with Kai Hahto, who had acted as his replacement since 2014, becoming the official drummer. Bassist Marko Hietala parted ways with the band in January 2021, and Jukka Koskinen was announced as Hietala&#x27;s replacement in August 2022.

Nightwish is the third-best-selling band and musical entity in Finland with certified sales of nearly 900,000 certified copies. The group is also the most successful Finnish band worldwide, selling more than 10 million records and receiving more than 60 gold and platinum awards, having released six Number 1 albums and thirteen Number 1 singles. On October 26, 2018, Nightwish was inducted into the Finnish Music Hall of Fame, becoming the honorary gallery&#x27;s 11th member.

==History==

===1996: Formation===

After playing keyboards in several heavy metal bands in the 1990s, including Darkwoods My Betrothed, Tuomas Holopainen decided to create his own project while sitting around a campfire with friends on July 6, 1996. He immediately had a clear idea of the music: experimental acoustic music he had written himself during his time in the Finnish Army, similar to the music usually played around campfires, but with a distinct sound and atmosphere and played on his keyboards.

He soon invited friend and schoolmate Erno &quot;Emppu&quot; Vuorinen to play acoustic guitars, and the classical vocalist Tarja Turunen, who had shared the same music teacher, Plamen Dimov, a few years earlier. The three musicians recorded their self-titled acoustic demo in late 1996. The name &quot;Nightwish&quot; was derived from their first song together – the demo also included the song &quot;The Forever Moments&quot;, and an early version of &quot;Etiäinen&quot;.

===1997–1998: Debut album and first tour===
In early 1997, Jukka &quot;Julius&quot; Nevalainen joined the band, and acoustic guitar was replaced with electric guitar. The addition of heavy metal elements to Nightwish&#x27;s existing experimental music gave the band a different sound, forming the core of the band&#x27;s distinct style.

The band entered the studio in April 1997 to record seven songs for their second demo, titled &quot;Angels Fall First&quot;. In May 1997, the demo made its way to the Finnish record label Spinefarm Records, who wanted to release it as the band&#x27;s debut album. The label offered Nightwish a record deal, and the band returned to the studio to record four more songs to complement the tracks of the demo. The full-length &quot;Angels Fall First&quot; album was released in November 1997 and reached number 31 on the Finnish album charts, with the single &quot;The Carpenter&quot; reaching number 3 on the Finnish singles chart; &quot;The Carpenter&quot; single was released as a split with fellow Spinefarm artists Children of Bodom and Thy Serpent. The album is also one of the two releases which features Holopainen&#x27;s vocals, appearing on four of the album&#x27;s eleven tracks alongside Turunen&#x27;s.

The band made their live debut in their hometown Kitee at the Huvikeskus on December 31, 1997, in front of 400 people. The band recalled being both nervous and terrified when performing for the first time. Since they were missing a bass player, Samppa Hirvonen joined them as a sessional live member. Marianna Pellinen was also a sessional live member as an additional keyboard player and a backing vocalist for Turunen. There were plans to make Hirvonen a permanent member, but he joined the army as part of Finnish army conscription just as they began recording &quot;Oceanborn&quot;, so they asked Sami Vänskä to join instead, since Tuomas knew him from the band Nattvindens Gråt. During early 1998, the band performed seven concerts, while Turunen was finishing her schooling, and Nevalainen and Vuorinen were serving their obligatory Finnish military service. They played warm-up shows for bands Babylon Whores, Children of Bodom and Tarot.

===1998–2000: International success with &quot;Oceanborn&quot; and &quot;Wishmaster&quot;===
Nightwish returned to the studio in August 1998 as a five-piece to record a follow-up for Spinefarm Records, which would become their second full-length album, &quot;Oceanborn&quot;. Adopting a more technical and progressive sound than &quot;Angels Fall First&quot;, &quot;Oceanborn&quot; saw the band abandon much of the ambient and folk elements present on their debut release, with the exception of the song &quot;Moondance&quot;. In contrast to the female vocals of Turunen, the album also featured guest growling vocals by Tapio Wilska (ex-Finntroll), since Tuomas did not want to sing again. Wilska is also a former member of Nattvindens Gråt.

The AllMusic review said that the album &quot;as a whole works great&quot;, with songs that are &quot;very strong&quot;. &quot;Oceanborn&quot; was released on December 7, 1998 in Finland only. It was an instant success, reaching number 5 on the Finnish album charts. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Sacrament of Wilderness&quot;, hit number 1 on the Finnish singles charts, where it stayed for several weeks. The album&#x27;s release was initially limited to Finland, but because of the success of &quot;Sacrament of Wilderness&quot;, Spinefarm released &quot;Oceanborn&quot; internationally in the spring of 1999. In May 1999, Nightwish recorded the song &quot;Sleeping Sun&quot;, and 13,000 copies of its single were purchased in pre-release sales in Germany alone. Following the band&#x27;s first international success, Nightwish was added as the opening band for Rage&#x27;s 1999 European tour. Both the album &quot;Oceanborn&quot; and the singles &quot;Sacrament of Wilderness&quot; and &quot;Walking in the Air&quot; were certified gold in Finland in August 1999.

While in the studio in early 2000 working on their third album, Nightwish was accepted in the Finnish Eurovision Song Contest preselection final with the song &quot;Sleepwalker&quot;. Despite winning the public vote, Nightwish eventually finished in third place, with the jury choosing gospel singer Nina Åström to represent Finland.

On 19 May 2000, Nightwish released their third studio album, &quot;Wishmaster&quot;. It debuted and spent three weeks at number one on the Finnish album charts, selling enough records to be certified gold in Finland. Critical response to the album was mixed, with AllMusic calling the album repetitive, and saying &quot;as a whole album, it can be a little annoying, even frustrating&quot;. However, German magazine &quot;Rock Hard&quot; declared &quot;Wishmaster&quot; &quot;Album of the Month&quot;, despite competing against long-awaited May releases from Iron Maiden and Bon Jovi. Following the release of &quot;Wishmaster&quot;, Nightwish embarked on their first world tour, playing dates in South America, Mexico and Canada. In the summer, the band returned to Europe for their first headlining European tour with Sinergy and Eternal Tears of Sorrow, appearing at the Wacken Open Air festival and the Biebop Metal Fest.

===2001–2003: Arrival of Hietala and symphonic elements with &quot;Century Child&quot;===
In 2001, Nightwish recorded a cover of Gary Moore&#x27;s &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; together with two new songs (&quot;10th Man Down&quot;, unreleased from &quot;Oceanborn&quot; sessions, and &quot;Away&quot;, unreleased from &quot;Wishmaster&quot; sessions) and a remake of &quot;Astral Romance&quot; (from the &quot;Angels Fall First&quot; album) with Tony Kakko (Sonata Arctica) singing Tuomas&#x27; part. This new material was released as their first (and until 2009 the only) EP, &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot;.

The record also included guest performances by Tapio Wilska once again on &quot;10th Man Down&quot;. Nightwish&#x27;s version of &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; was well received by fans, becoming a frequent part of the band&#x27;s live performances, but the other songs never broke through and have not been re-released, with the exception of a live performance of &quot;10th Man Down&quot; on the &quot;End of Innocence&quot; DVD with Marko Hietala. In the same year, they also released (as VHS, DVD and CD) their first live album, &quot;From Wishes to Eternity&quot;, recorded during a show in Tampere, Finland, on 29 December 2000.

Soon after the release of &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot;, Nightwish met what has been described as one of hardest points of their career. The issues centered on the bassist, Sami Vänskä, who had started misbehaving towards the band, according to Holopainen, by missing appointments and failing to take concerts as seriously as the other members did. After the band discussed his behavior with Vänskä several times, without getting any change, everyone simply stopped caring and tensions grew. Meanwhile, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen had started complaining about his role in the band, feeling like &quot;a hired gun who would only do what he&#x27;s asked to&quot;. According to their music teacher, Plamen Dimov, he and Holopainen have totally different characters, and thus difficulties were expected to arise. But Vuorinen was told to stay cool and &quot;bite the bullet&quot;, and the problem was never addressed again.

Later, Holopainen confessed that, at that time, he seriously started thinking about breaking Nightwish up. After a show in Russia, he sent a text message to fellow musician Tony Kakko of metal band Sonata Arctica, telling him that he did not think he had a band any longer, and asking him what plans he had for next year. After the &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; tour in 2001, Holopainen called their labels Drakkar and Spinefarm, unofficially declaring Nightwish was over. He told them he might produce another album, but he&#x27;d never perform another show with the band. The same message was also written on the band&#x27;s message board.

Straight after the last show of the tour, Holopainen went on a week-long hiking trip to Lapland with Tony Kakko, where they talked about the band, leading Holopainen to decide that he could not break Nightwish up that easily. When he returned from Lapland he immediately received a phone call from Ewo Pohjola, CEO of Spinefarm, offering to become their manager and help him straighten things up, and Holopainen agreed.

To continue with Nightwish, Holopainen decided some changes were in order. Beside choosing Ewo as their new manager, he also asked Vänskä to leave the band. He would later cite musical differences as another reason for the breakup. Marko Hietala (Tarot) was asked to replace Vänskä, effectively leaving his previous band, Sinergy. In addition to playing bass guitar, Hietala would also perform male vocals. Holopainen has since said publicly that he and Vänskä still keep in touch, contrary to rumours saying that they have not met since. However, they are not interested in making another project together.

In 2002, Nightwish released &quot;Century Child&quot;, along with the singles &quot;Ever Dream&quot; and &quot;Bless the Child&quot;. &quot;Century Child&quot; was certified gold two hours after its release, and platinum two weeks afterwards. It set a record on the Finnish album charts of most distance between a first place album and the second place. A music video was filmed for &quot;Bless the Child&quot;, with a second one filmed for &quot;End of All Hope&quot; later, without any single support. It contains clips from the Finnish movie &quot;Kohtalon kirja&quot; (English: &quot;The Book of Fate&quot;).

The main difference from previous albums is the use of a live Finnish orchestra on the tracks &quot;Bless the Child&quot;, &quot;Ever Dream&quot;, &quot;Feel For You&quot; and &quot;The Beauty of the Beast&quot;. An enduring favorite of fans is the band&#x27;s version of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, from the famous musical of the same name by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber. The song was routinely played in concerts until October 21, 2005, when vocalist Tarja Turunen was fired from the band and later replaced with Anette Olzon, whereupon the band announced that they would never play the song live again. This would hold true for 17 years until 27 and 28 November 2022, when Nightwish was joined by Dutch singer Henk Poort on stage at the Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam to perform the song.

In 2003, Nightwish released their second DVD, the documentary &quot;End of Innocence&quot;. It tells the story of the band in Holopainen, Nevalainen and Tapio Wilska&#x27;s words for two hours. The documentary also features live performances and other exclusive footage. Vocalist Tarja Turunen got married during the summer of 2003, and there were rumours that the band was about to be dissolved. These rumors were, at the time, proven to be false, as the band continued to play concerts for another year and released another album. Tarja&#x27;s marriage later played a part in her dismissal from the band in the autumn of 2005.

===2004–2005: Chart-topping success with &quot;Once&quot; and Turunen&#x27;s dismissal===


Nightwish released their fifth album, &quot;Once&quot;, on 7 June 2004, along with its first single, &quot;Nemo&quot;. The popularity of Evanescence in 2003 had piqued international and especially American interest in symphonic goth metal bands like Nightwish, Lacuna Coil, and Within Temptation. Consequently, &quot;Once&quot; sold triple platinum in Finland, platinum in Germany, and gold in 6 other countries; it also reached No. 1 in the Greek, Norwegian and German album charts, and charted the Top 10 in France, Hungary and Sweden. &quot;Nemo&quot; topped the charts in Finland and Hungary, and reached the charts in six additional countries. The following singles were: &quot;Wish I Had an Angel&quot; (featured on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;), &quot;Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan&quot; (released only in Finland and Japan) and &quot;The Siren&quot;. Besides the commercial success, &quot;Once&quot; was also well received by critics, with many positive reviewers drawing comparisons with &quot;Oceanborn&quot;. &quot;Nemo&quot; remains the band&#x27;s most successful single release to date.

&quot;Once&quot; utilizes a full orchestra in nine of the eleven songs on the album. Unlike for &quot;Century Child&quot;, Nightwish looked for an orchestra outside of Finland this time, choosing the London Philharmonic Orchestra. It is also their second album to feature a full-length song in Finnish, &quot;Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan&quot; (English: &quot;Death Makes an Artist&quot;). 
The production cost of &quot;Once&quot; totaled approximately 250,000 euros (over 1,000,000 including video production), making it Finland&#x27;s most expensive recording in history. The band would go on to break this record again later in their career.

The success of the album allowed them to perform the Once Upon a Tour, in which the band played in many countries they had never visited before. Nightwish performed at the opening ceremony of the 2005 World Championships in Athletics, held in Helsinki, highlighting the acclaim the band had gained. A &quot;best of&quot; album, &quot;Highest Hopes&quot;, was released in September 2005. The compilation also featured a live cover &quot;High Hopes&quot; (from the Pink Floyd album &quot;The Division Bell&quot;). Besides &quot;High Hopes&quot;, a remake of &quot;Sleeping Sun&quot; (from &quot;Oceanborn&quot;) was included on the album and released as a single. A video for the remake was shot, featuring a medieval battle, and can be found on the German release of the single and as a separate DVD released by Spinefarm.

The four other members of Nightwish had decided that it was best to continue Nightwish without Turunen. After a concert in the Hartwall Areena (Helsinki) on 21 October 2005, recorded for the live DVD &quot;End of an Era&quot; (released June 2006), they expressed their decision through an open letter which was given to Turunen by Holopainen, and afterwards posted on the band&#x27;s website. It was written by Holopainen and signed by all four band members. The main justification given in the letter for Turunen&#x27;s dismissal was that the band felt that both her husband Marcelo Cabuli (an Argentine businessman) and commercial interests had changed her attitude towards the band.

Turunen responded to the incident twice, during press conferences in Finland and Germany, saying that her dismissal came entirely as a shock to her, given that she had not been notified before the letter was given to her. She felt that the personal attacks on her husband were unwarranted, and that playing the issue out in public was &quot;senselessly cruel&quot;. She expressed these feelings through her own open letter, which was published on her personal website, and through various TV, magazine, and newspaper interviews.

===2006–2009: Arrival of Anette Olzon and &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot;===
To find a replacement for Turunen as the female vocalist of the band, on 17 March 2006, the band allowed interested vocalists to send in demo tapes as an audition for the spot. During this time, speculation emerged about who would eventually be chosen and the band stated on their website that fans should not believe any source other than the band itself for information regarding the new vocalist. In the end, the 35-year-old Alyson Avenue&#x27;s ex-lead singer, Anette Olzon, from Sweden, was chosen.

In September 2006, the band entered the studio to record their sixth studio album, &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot;. In May, next year, Anette Olzon was announced to replace Turunen. Holopainen has said in interviews that he did not wish to reveal her identity until new material was available because he did not want fans judging her by nothing more than a picture, or past work.
The day after this revealing, 25 May 2007, charity single &quot;Eva&quot; was released for download only as the first offering from the new album, and the first featuring Olzon. It was originally scheduled for release on 30 May, but the date was changed because of a leak on a British music download site. On June 13, Nightwish revealed the title and artwork for the new album on their official website, as well as the name and cover of the second single (this time CD), &quot;Amaranth&quot;; it was released in Finland on August 22 and included a bonus track entitled &quot;While Your Lips Are Still Red&quot; written by Tuomas as the main theme for the upcoming Finnish feature film &quot;Lieksa!&quot;. The single achieved gold status in Finland after less than two days in stores.
&quot;Dark Passion Play&quot; was released around Europe in the last week of September 2007, in the UK on October 1 and the United States on October 2. It was awarded double platinum in Finland the second day after its release and took the number one position on the charts of Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Hungary and Croatia and got in top 100 in other 16 countries, including the United States.

&quot;Dark Passion Play&quot; broke the band&#x27;s previous record for Finland&#x27;s most expensive audio recording, with the final production cost coming in at over 500,000 euros (twice the cost of &quot;Once&quot;, the previous record-setter, and approximately $675,000).

On this album, male vocalist Marko Hietala had more freedom in the use of his voice: he sings backup on the songs &quot;Cadence of Her Last Breath&quot; and &quot;Sahara&quot;, lead vocals on the songs &quot;The Islander&quot;, &quot;Master Passion Greed&quot; and &quot;While Your Lips Are Still Red&quot; and chorus on the songs &quot;Bye Bye Beautiful&quot; and &quot;7 Days to the Wolves&quot;. He also sings one part in &quot;The Poet and the Pendulum&quot;, besides singing backup in the chorus. Before the band found the new singer and the album was recorded, Marko sang on all the demo versions. Holopainen also sang on the demo versions of &quot;Bye Bye Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Master Passion Greed&quot; but these songs have never been released.

On 22 September 2007, the band hosted a secret concert at Rock Café in Tallinn, Estonia, disguising itself as a Nightwish cover band called Nachtwasser. Their first official concert with Olzon was in Tel Aviv, Israel, on 6 October 2007. The &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot; tour thus started, visiting the United States, Canada, most of Europe, Asia, and Australia.
The third single of the album was &quot;Erämaan viimeinen&quot;, a previously unreleased vocal version of the instrumental &quot;Last of the Wilds&quot;. It was released in Finland only on 5 December 2007. On this song, Jonsu of the Finnish pop and rock band Indica performs the Finnish vocals. &quot;Bye Bye Beautiful&quot;, the fourth single, was released on 15 February 2008, and concerns the 2005 dismissal of Turunen, as does one other song on the album (&quot;Master Passion Greed&quot;). The single includes yet another bonus track, &quot;Escapist&quot;, which is also included on the Japanese version of &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot;. Within a week after the release, the fifth single was announced to be &quot;The Islander&quot;. It was released over a month after the release of its music video, shot in late 2007 in Rovaniemi in Finnish Lapland.

The Dark Passion Play tour turned out to be Nightwish&#x27;s longest tour yet, lasting from late 2007 to September 2009, when it ended with a concert in Hartwall Arena – the band&#x27;s second concert there – with the band Apocalyptica.

On 6 March 2009, Nightwish released a new live EP/DVD entitled &quot;Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places)&quot;. The eight live tracks were recorded during the &quot;Dark Passion Play World Tour&quot; in 2007–2008, and the album also includes one B-side from the &quot;Bye Bye Beautiful&quot; single, one B-side from the &quot;Amaranth&quot; single, a previously unreleased demo version of &quot;Cadence of Her Last Breath&quot;, and a bonus DVD with three music videos as well as a 37-minute documentary called &quot;Back in the Day is Now&quot;.

===2009–2012: &quot;Imaginaerum&quot; and Olzon&#x27;s dismissal===

In the June 2009 edition of the Finnish magazine &quot;Soundi&quot;, Holopainen stated that he had started work on a new Nightwish album. In October 2009, rumors about the new album&#x27;s name were going around with the title &quot;Wind Embraced&quot;, but lead vocalist Anette Olzon listed the rumors as &quot;not true&quot; and said that the songs for the new album had not yet been completed apart from three songs written before May 2009. Holopainen said in a 2010 interview that &quot;[...]I can&#x27;t reveal to you any more but there is going to be a big twist so to say, on the next album.&quot; In an interview with Uilleann piper Troy Donockley (who recorded with the band on &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot;), when asked about his involvement in the new album, he stated &quot;Oh yes, I &quot;will&quot; be playing on the next album and from what Tuomas has told me, it is going to be something extraordinary...&quot;

On 1 February 2010, Olzon stated on her blog that Holopainen had nine songs ready for the new album. In April 2010, Holopainen revealed on the Nightwish homepage that he had finished writing the songs, and on June 2, it was announced that he had finished recording the pre-production demo.

The band announced in late 2010 that more information on the album&#x27;s actual content would be released in late January, but on February 1, the official website bore a statement written by Holopainen that because of the schedule changes he can&#x27;t yet give away as many details as he would have wanted, but more information will be out after a couple of months. He added, however, that &quot;it still is the Burton-Gaiman-Dalí – amusement park we are about to enter&quot;. In the same statement, it was revealed that the album would be a theme album and &quot;mood changes seem to be more present than ever before&quot;, and the orchestration demos he had received from Pip Williams were described as &quot;beautiful, twisted, tribal and cinematic stuff&quot;. In the Finnish version of the statement, it was also revealed that a few songs will not get any orchestrations at all, differing from their latest album on which all songs had the background orchestra.
Announcements continued throughout 2011. On February 10, Nightwish announced on their website that the new album title would be &quot;Imaginaerum&quot;. They also declared that the band had been preparing a movie based on the album, which would be released in 2012 and directed by Stobe Harju, who previously directed the music video for &quot;The Islander&quot;. On 22 August 2011, the band&#x27;s official website announced that the album of &quot;Imaginaerum&quot; would be released at the end of the year. On August 31, Nightwish announced on its website a change in title, from &quot;Imaginarium&quot; to &quot;Imaginaerum&quot;, &quot;to avoid mix-ups with various things named &#x27;Imaginarium. On September 2, the group announced on its website that the new single, &quot;Storytime&quot;, would be released on Friday, November 11, and on September 9, Nightwish revealed the cover and track list.

On 11 January 2012, Nightwish announced on its website that the second single, &quot;The Crow, the Owl and the Dove&quot;, would be released on February 29. Roadrunner Records announced that Nightwish would be releasing a 10-inch LP titled &quot;Trials of Imaginaerum&quot; in conjunction with Record Store Day (21 April 2012). The 10-inch LP is a two-sided picture disk that contains four early demos of &quot;Storytime&quot;, &quot;The Crow, The Owl and The Dove&quot;, &quot;I Want My Tears Back&quot; and &quot;Slow, Love, Slow&quot;.

On 1 October 2012, Nightwish announced via its Facebook page that they were parting ways with Olzon. According to the press statement, &quot;it has become increasingly obvious that the direction and the needs of the band were in conflict, and this has led to a division from which we cannot recover&quot;. This announcement came days after Olzon fell ill at a show in Denver, Colorado, and was unable to perform. Nightwish used replacement singers from the opening band, Kamelot, and Olzon later expressed her disappointment, saying &quot;I was never asked if it was okay that they used Elize and Alissa in the show [Friday] night [...] I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good decision they made and I&#x27;m sorry for those of you who came to see the whole band but got something else. But I was very ill and this decision wasn&#x27;t mine.&quot; According to the statement, Dutch singer Floor Jansen (ex-After Forever, ReVamp) would sing for the remainder of the Imaginaerum World Tour.

On 11 January 2013, Olzon announced on her official blog that she was pregnant with her third child, due in spring 2013, which she claimed was a contributing factor to her being dismissed. The band then released a statement on its website counterclaiming that the reason Olzon gave for her dismissal and other statements she made were untrue and that Olzon herself had agreed to help find a replacement while she was on maternity leave. Later, Olzon gave several interviews in which she said she never agreed with a replacement, even when she was pregnant, and proposed to the band to postpone the tour, which culminated in her firing. She also added that she was against Jansen joining the band in her period of maternity, mainly because of the difference in their vocal styles.

In a 2015 interview, Holopainen said the band &quot;emerged stronger&quot; from the line-up changes it went through.

=== 2013–2018: Arrival of Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley with &quot;Endless Forms Most Beautiful&quot; ===
In an interview with &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; in November 2012, Tuomas Holopainen stated that they already had a rehearsal place booked from July 2014 to September 2014, but before they began rehearsing the band members would be taking a break from Nightwish for several months.

On 9 October 2013, Nightwish announced Floor Jansen as the permanent replacement for Olzon. Troy Donockley was also announced as a full-time member, making the band a sextet for the first time. In a later interview, Tuomas said that Donockley&#x27;s previous work with Nightwish had already made him &quot;much a band member&quot;, so the band just &quot;made it official&quot;. According to the band&#x27;s webpage, the band would enter the studio in 2014 to record its eighth full-length album for a 2015 release. At that time, the band had already announced that it would contain Nightwish&#x27;s longest song to date.

At the end of November, the band released the live album &quot;Showtime, Storytime&quot;. Despite the recording happening when they were only four members, it is the first Nightwish release to feature Jansen and to have her and Donockley credited as band members. The album also carries a documentary containing the behind-the-scenes of Jansen&#x27;s first days in the band and the process of replacing Olzon.

In May 2014, Holopainen updated his official website, stating that he and producer Tero &quot;TeeCee&quot; Kinnunen had been recording 12 demos (and possibly three bonus tracks) for the new album in Hattula, Finland. The band expected to start rehearsing in July in Eno, Finland, to complete recording by January 2015, and to release the album in spring of that year, &quot;If everything goes as scheduled&quot;. Commenting on the music, Tuomas said:

On August 6, the band announced that founding member and drummer Jukka Nevalainen would not be part of the upcoming album due to his debilitating insomnia. Kai Hahto (Wintersun) would be taking his place on the album and the upcoming tour.
Evolutionary biologist and author Richard Dawkins was announced as a guest star on the album, with Holopainen stating that he had &quot;been so enthusiastic about this kind of literature for the past few months, and will be for the upcoming months, that it&#x27;s going to come out somehow.&quot;

In November, the band filmed a music video for &quot;Élan&quot;, one of the tracks of the album. On December 8, the band announced that it would be the first single from the album, which would be released on February 13, 2015.

The new album&#x27;s cover art and its title, &quot;Endless Forms Most Beautiful&quot;, were revealed on 22 December, and the album was released on 27 March 2015, produced by Tero &quot;TeeCee&quot; Kinnunen. The title for Endless Forms Most Beautiful was taken from the writings of English naturalist Charles Darwin. The album features the participation of London&#x27;s The Metro Voices choir group, London&#x27;s Young Musicians Children&#x27;s Choir, and the Orchestre De Grandeur, led by the esteemed orchestral arranger Pip Williams, who teaches music and music technology at the London College of Music. Professor Richard Dawkins not only narrates the introduction to the album&#x27;s opener, &quot;Shudder Before the Beautiful&quot;, but also the album&#x27;s closer, &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, which takes its name from his 2009 book on evolution. To promote the album&#x27;s release, the band went on the Endless Forms Most Beautiful World Tour, which started on April 9, 2015, in New York City and concluded on October 9, 2016, in Saitama, Japan.
In July 2015, it was announced that Sonata Arctica&#x27;s vocalist Tony Kakko would replace Jukka Nevalainen as the band&#x27;s special guest at the 2015 edition of Rock in Rio. In December 2015, Nightwish became the first Finnish band to headline a show at the Wembley Arena, in London. The sold-out show featured guest performer Richard Dawkins, who spoke his parts on stage. The Tampere and London shows were filmed for a live album release known as &quot;Vehicle of Spirit&quot;.

On 20 August 2016, the band played a special 20th-anniversary show at Himos Areena in Finland. The show featured original bassist Sami Vänskä on the song &quot;Stargazers&quot; and drummer Jukka Nevalainen on the song &quot;Last Ride of the Day&quot;. The band took a break in 2017, during which Jansen was focusing on her first child. Holopainen said that the band would continue between the years of 2018 and 2020, with another album that would continue the themes explored in &quot;Endless Forms Most Beautiful&quot;.

On 9 June 2017, the band announced that 9 March 2018 would mark not only the debut of a nine-month world tour titled &quot;&quot;, which had concluded in December that same year, but also the release of a new compilation album, titled &quot;Decades&quot;. The tour featured &quot;rarely heard material&quot; and a special set for fans. During the Latin American leg of the tour, the Buenos Aires show was filmed for a live DVD known as &quot;&quot; which was released on December 6, 2019.

===2019–2023: Further lineup changes and &quot;Human. :II: Nature.&quot;===
In July 2018, Holopainen stated that he had written &quot;80 or 90%&quot; of the material for Nightwish&#x27;s next album, which would consist of ten or eleven songs. He stated that the inspiration for the new album came from the completion of the 2018 self-titled debut album of Auri, a band he created with Donockley and Johanna Kurkela the previous year. Recording would start in July 2019, with a planned spring 2020 release. The band would &quot;use the [orchestral] instrumentation in a different way than before&quot;, with Holopainen stating, &quot;You want to search for some new ways of using it so that it doesn&#x27;t end up sounding the same as before&quot;. Jansen stated in November that she believed the recording process would be similar to &quot;Endless Forms Most Beautiful&quot;″s, for which the band went through lengthy rehearsals before starting to record.

On 15 July 2019, the band announced that Kai Hahto would permanently take over for Jukka Nevalainen as the band&#x27;s drummer. In a statement, Nevalainen explained that while he was managing his insomnia well and having few issues, he did not want to &#x27;push his luck&#x27; by returning to the band as a full-time member. He did confirm, however, that he would continue to take care of band-related business behind the scenes.

On 31 October 2019, Floor Jansen confirmed that recording for the new album had been completed. On 18 December 2019, it was confirmed that Tuomas Holopainen was at Finnvox Studios mixing Nightwish&#x27;s next studio album, set for release in the first quarter of 2020. Holopainen confirmed on 10 January 2020 that mixing and mastering for the album had finished and it was ready for release, with the album title and other details to be released soon.

The new album&#x27;s cover and track list, along with its title, &quot;Human. :II: Nature.&quot;, were revealed on 16 January 2020, and the album was released on 10 April 2020. The first single of the album, titled &quot;Noise&quot; was released on 7 February 2020, with an accompanying music video. The second single from the album, &quot;Harvest&quot;, was released on 6 March 2020, with a lyric video to accompany its release. On the day the album was released, Nightwish released lyric videos for all of the songs on the album. The album debuted in the top 10 charts as number one in Finland, Spain, Switzerland and Germany, as well as being charted in other countries including Canada, Austria, Hungary, Poland and the United States.

Nightwish announced on 11 March 2020 that they had joined a partnership with an international conservation charity organization named World Land Trust. With their announcement was a video that promoted the organization, which in turn features the song &quot;Ad Astra&quot; from their ninth album. When asked about the partnership with the organization in an interview, Floor commented:

On 10 July 2020, a new crab species, the &quot;Tanidromites nightwishorum&quot;, which was discovered by curator of palaeontology Dr. Adiel A. Klompmaker of the Alabama Museum of Natural History, was named in honor of the band, in particular for their 2015 album &quot;Endless Forms Most Beautiful&quot;. On 12 August 2020, a prehistoric rockshelter called the &quot;Alpenglow Rockshelter&quot;, that was discovered in Pennsylvania, USA was, too, named for Nightwish, particularly in honor of their ninth track, &quot;Alpenglow&quot;, from their 2015 album.

On 12 January 2021, Marko Hietala announced his departure from the band, citing his struggles with chronic depression and his disillusionment with the music scene in general. The band released another statement, that a temporary member would fill in on bass for the tour. In his statement, Hietala wrote:
The band began their world tour in support of the album in May 2021 with an interactive livestream experience in a virtual reality tavern which featured songs from the album, as well as revealed the identity of the session bass player, Jukka Koskinen, via VIP virtual session. Both of the performances had broken records with the first drawing 150,000 viewers and setting it as the most viewed virtual performance in Finland, with the box office exceeding one million in euros. The virtual performances were released on DVD on 11 March 2022. The band resumed their tour in Finland in late July 2021 with a &quot;secret&quot; performance in Oulu. The tour was originally scheduled to begin in spring 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the band postponed the tour to the next year. The tour concluded in June 2023.

On 21 January 2021, the band were nominated by the Finnish Emma Awards for the categories of Album of the Year, Band of the Year and Viewer&#x27;s Choice of the Year, winning the category of Metal Album of the Year. The awards ceremony in which they were nominated was held on 14 May 2021, at the Hartwall Arena in Helsinki.

Following a number of summer festivals in Europe, the band announced the addition of Jukka Koskinen as the band&#x27;s permanent bass player on 21 August 2022.

===2023–present: &quot;Yesterwynde&quot; and touring hiatus===

In April 2021, Holopainen had said in an interview that he started sketching drafts for the next Nightwish album. He stated in May 2021 that he had been working on new material for &quot;the past month or two&quot; while he was busy with his side projects Auri and the reunited Darkwoods My Betrothed in which he became a full-time member. He confirmed that the band booked a studio for the next album, which is set to happen in the summer of 2023 for three months at the Röskö campsite. On 2 March 2022, it was confirmed that Holopainen was in the studio, writing demos for the next Nightwish album, which were finished in June 2022.

Jansen, who was at the time working on her debut solo album, &quot;Paragon&quot;, stated on 10 June 2022 that the sound of the upcoming new album would be heavier, but would retain the band&#x27;s sound, while she also kept the concept for the album a secret. Holopainen confirmed in an interview before the band&#x27;s performance at Knotfest in Turku, Finland on 12 August 2022, that the band had listened to the demos. Holopainen later confirmed that the next album would be both a follow-up to &quot;Human. :II: Nature.&quot; and the third and final part of a trilogy which started with &quot;Endless Forms Most Beautiful&quot;, as well as stating that the album would come out around early 2024. The band confirmed that recording had begun for their upcoming tenth studio album following the completion of the demos. After the recording was finished, mixing and mastering for the album began in January 2024, and was completed at the end of February. The band renewed a multi-album deal with Nuclear Blast in March 2024.

The name of the tenth studio album, &quot;Yesterwynde&quot;, was announced on 30 April 2024, and the album was released on 20 September 2024. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, three singles were released in support of the album: &quot;Perfume of the Timeless&quot;, &quot;The Day of...&quot;, and &quot;An Ocean of Strange Islands&quot;.

There was no touring cycle in support of the album, as the band had issued a statement on April 6, 2023 that they would be going on a hiatus from touring for two to three years following the album&#x27;s release. Donockley stated the reason behind the touring hiatus in a September 2024 interview, citing personal reasons and the dangers of burning out. In the same interview, he did not rule out the band performing some shows in 2027 for the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

==Music==
===Musical style===
Nightwish performs goth-influenced symphonic metal with female vocals. Their music has been also described as symphonic gothic metal which mixes metal, opera, weepy power ballads, and keyboard solos. Although the combination of operatic vocals and melodic heavy metal made Nightwish famous, they don&#x27;t employ operatic vocals as much as they used to. On the ninth studio album, &quot;Human. :II: Nature.&quot;, &quot;Shoemaker&quot; was the only song with an operatic vocal after Tarja Turunen&#x27;s departure. They have also been known to play power metal, progressive metal, folk metal and gothic metal.

The band&#x27;s music is known to be complex and layered. Their approach is epic, theatrical and operatic. Critic Steve Huey notes &quot;their rich melodicism, dynamic textures, and theatrical approach to performance make them a unique musical entity&quot;
The usage of a female vocalist has become a sort of trademark, though less so since the outbreak of new female fronted metal bands in the mid-2000s with the popularization of bands such as Evanescence and Within Temptation as well as several gothic metal bands mixing female and male vocals, such as Lacuna Coil, Tristania, Epica and After Forever.

Former bassist and vocalist Marko Hietala describes the style of the band&#x27;s music as &quot;melodic symphonic metal;&quot; though this is not a view shared by all members of the group, including band composer Tuomas Holopainen, who describes the band as simply symphonic metal. Some critics find that the band had a gothic sound since their debut. The music of Nightwish had been &quot;distinguished by the operatic voice&quot; of soprano Tarja Turunen, a &quot;charismatic frontwoman with a powerful voice&quot;. Critics observed that her vocals became less operatic with the release of &quot;Once&quot;. Following the departure of Tarja Turunen from the group, Nightwish left behind the &quot;signature operatic vocals&quot; of their earlier albums, though the band somewhat reintroduced this style when Floor Jansen became lead singer.

While the music of Nightwish is centered on a female lead singer, the band has also featured some male vocals on their albums ever since their debut release, &quot;Angels Fall First&quot;. This debut album also included &quot;elements of folk music and ambience&quot; that were discarded on their subsequent album, &quot;Oceanborn&quot;. However, the song &quot;Creek Mary&#x27;s Blood&quot; from the album &quot;Once&quot; featured some use of folk-oriented Native American melodies, and their 2007 release &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot; featured folk music elements on the songs &quot;The Islander&quot; and &quot;Last of the Wilds&quot;.

===Lyrical themes===
In the beginning, Holopainen mainly wrote about mythological and fantasy themes, and often used references to &quot;metaphysics and nature&quot;. Fantasy novels especially are a big influence on Nightwish&#x27;s lyrics. Songs such as &quot;Wishmaster,&quot; &quot;Elvenpath,&quot; and &quot;Wanderlust&quot; make fairly clear references to fantasy novels, in this case the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; series and J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. &quot;FantasMic&quot; from &quot;Wishmaster&quot; is a direct tribute to Walt Disney and Disney animated films, which Holopainen has said are among his influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;powermetal/00&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot; featured the return to the fantasy theme with songs such as &quot;Sahara&quot;, &quot;Whoever Brings the Night&quot; and &quot;7 Days to the Wolves&quot;, which is loosely based on Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot;, the fifth book in the Dark Tower series.&lt;ref name=&quot;pm 7/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The song &quot;The Poet and the Pendulum&#x27;s&quot; first section is called &quot;The White Lands of Empathica&quot;, which is a reference to the seventh book in the Dark Tower series.

Over the years, the lyrics became more personal. &quot;Dead Boy&#x27;s Poem&quot; from &quot;Wishmaster&quot; is an emotional piece, which Holopainen calls his &quot;legacy and [...] testament for the whole world. [...] I wanted to do this song before I die because I wanted to tell the whole world what I think and feel. It expresses a lot of myself.&quot; The personal development became even more obvious on the &quot;Wishmaster&quot; successor &quot;Century Child&quot;. Turunen thinks that the lyrics no longer deal &quot;with the dreamland we were used to, but with the brutal reality of life.&quot;

&quot;Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan&quot; (in English, &quot;Death Makes an Artist&quot;) from &quot;Once&quot; describes the experience of loss and its impact on art, &quot;Nemo&quot; deals with the feeling of being lost,&lt;ref name=&quot;u-empire/holo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Dead Gardens&quot; deals with a bout of writer&#x27;s block Holopainen suffered. &quot;Creek Mary&#x27;s Blood&quot; is based on Dee Brown&#x27;s story of the same name, which presents the situation of Native Americans at the end of the 19th century.

2007&#x27;s &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot; included an unusual number of personal songs, including &quot;The Poet and the Pendulum&quot;, which has been described as Holopainen&#x27;s life story, and about being a composer and musician. &quot;Meadows of Heaven&quot; is a depiction of Holopainen&#x27;s childhood and the feeling that it&#x27;ll never return. &quot;Bye Bye Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Master Passion Greed&quot; are about ex-member Tarja Turunen and her husband Marcelo Cabuli. &quot;Cadence of Her Last Breath&quot; is a &quot;very personal song&quot; about running away. The album also contains many references to authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Walt Whitman.

&quot;Imaginaerum&quot; has different lyrical themes. For example, the song &quot;Ghost River&quot; is about &quot;a duel between the Devil and Mother Gaia&quot;, while &quot;Scaretale&quot; concerns &quot;childhood nightmares and monsters&quot;.
On &quot;Endless Forms Most Beautiful&quot;, lyrical themes included the beauty of the world and everything it has to offer (&quot;Shudder Before The Beautiful&quot;), criticism about how some religions restrict people&#x27;s lives (&quot;Weak Fantasy&quot;), and the meaning of life, which can be something different for all of us (&quot;Élan&quot;).

The first disc of &quot;Human. :II: Nature.&quot; continues the theme of Nightwish&#x27;s previous album, with the album&#x27;s theme being based on human nature and how they are as a species, with songs about modern society (&quot;Noise&quot;), life (&quot;Harvest&quot;), the human imagination (&quot;Pan&quot;), and an ode to human empathy (&quot;How&#x27;s the Heart?&quot;).

&quot;Yesterwynde&quot;, the tenth studio album, continues the themes on the previous two studio albums: time, humanism and history.

Although the lyrics of Nightwish generally are serious with dark meanings, they have also produced several less serious songs, including the bonus track &quot;Nightquest&quot;, which talks about the band members&#x27; (the three original members as well as Nevalainen) connection as musicians, and the &quot;quest&quot; of Nightwish.

===Language===
Nightwish mainly writes songs in English, though a few are in Finnish: one song on band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Angels Fall First&quot; (1997); &quot;Kuolema tekee taiteilijan&quot;, from the &quot;Once&quot; album (2004); the single &quot;Erämaan viimeinen&quot; (2007), which is a vocal version of the instrumental &quot;Last of the Wilds&quot;; and &quot;Taikatalvi&quot; (&quot;Magic Winter&quot;), from &quot;Imaginaerum&quot; (2011). Holopainen was very uncertain about the lyrics of &quot;Erämaan viimeinen&quot;, because he thinks that writing in Finnish is rather hard, and has said that &quot;Finnish [could] quickly sound really cheesy.&quot;

===Influence===

Tuomas Holopainen, writer of most of the band&#x27;s lyrics and music, says that he gets most of the inspiration for Nightwish&#x27;s songs from film music. Songs like &quot;Beauty of the Beast&quot; (from &quot;Century Child&quot;), &quot;Ghost Love Score&quot; (from &quot;Once&quot;) and &quot;The Poet and the Pendulum&quot; (from &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot;) are examples of this influence. Holopainen has also said that film music is the music he listens to for leisure. He likes, for example, the musical scores to &quot;The Village&quot;, &quot;Van Helsing&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; and &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;, and practically everything written by Hans Zimmer. Other songs, such as &quot;Bye Bye Beautiful&quot; (from &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot;), and &quot;Wish I Had an Angel&quot; (from &quot;Once&quot;) have elements of industrial metal, and some others, like &quot;The Islander&quot; and &quot;Last of the Wilds&quot; (from &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot;), &quot;Creek Mary&#x27;s Blood&quot; (from &quot;Once&quot;), and the &quot;Angels Fall First&quot; album have elements of folk music. Bands stated as an influence on Nightwish include Children of Bodom, Theatre of Tragedy, The Gathering, My Dying Bride, Tiamat and The 3rd and the Mortal.

Nightwish has also been noted as a source of inspiration for other bands. Simone Simons, lead singer of Dutch symphonic/gothic metal band Epica, stated that she began singing in a classical style because of Nightwish&#x27;s 1998 &quot;Oceanborn&quot; album. Sander Gommans of After Forever said that Nightwish &quot;will certainly influence us in creating new songs&quot;. Power metal band Sonata Arctica&#x27;s lead singer Tony Kakko has explained how much of an influence Nightwish is to him. In December 2015, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; Dave Everley described them as &quot;mainland Europe&#x27;s most successful metal band, give or take a Rammstein&quot;.

<text>A parent is either the progenitor of a child or, in humans, it can refer to a caregiver or legal guardian, generally called an adoptive parent or step-parent. The gametes of a parent result in a child, a male through the sperm, and a female through the ovum. Parents who are progenitors are first-degree relatives and have 50% genetic meet. A female can also become a parent through surrogacy. Some parents may be adoptive parents, who nurture and raise an offspring, but are not related to the child. Orphans without adoptive parents can be raised by their grandparents or other family members.

A parent can also be elaborated as an ancestor removed one generation. With recent medical advances, it is possible to have more than two biological parents. Examples of third biological parents include instances involving surrogacy or a third person who has provided DNA samples during an assisted reproductive procedure that has altered the recipients&#x27; genetic material.

The most common types of parents are mothers, fathers, step-parents, and grandparents. A mother is &quot;a woman in relation to a child or children to whom she has given birth.&quot; The extent to which it is socially acceptable for a parent to be involved in their offspring&#x27;s life varies from culture to culture, however one that exhibits too little involvement is sometimes said to exhibit child neglect, while one that is too involved is sometimes said to be overprotective, cosseting, nosey, or intrusive.

== Types ==

===Biological ===
A person&#x27;s biological parents are the persons from whom the individual inherits their genes. The term is generally only used if there is a need to distinguish an individual&#x27;s foster parents from their biological parents, For example, an individual whose father has remarried may call the father&#x27;s new wife their stepmother and continue to refer to their mother normally, though someone who has had little or no contact with their biological mother may address their foster parent as their mother, and their biological mother as such, or perhaps by her first name. 

=== Mother ===

A mother is a female who has a maternal connection with another individual, whether arising from conception, by giving birth to, or raising the individual in the role of a parent. More than one female may have such connections with an individual. Because of the complexity and differences of a mother&#x27;s social, cultural, and religious definitions and roles, it is challenging to define a mother to suit a universally accepted definition. The utilization of a surrogate mother may result in explication of there being two biological mothers.

=== Father ===

A father is a male parent of any type of offspring. It may be the person who shares in the raising of a child or who has provided the biological material, the sperm, which results in the birth of the child.

=== Grandparent ===

Grandparents are the parents of a person&#x27;s own parent, whether that be a father or a mother. Every sexually reproducing creature who is not a genetic chimera has a maximum of four genetic grandparents, eight genetic great-grandparents, sixteen genetic great-great-grandparents and so on. Rarely, such as in the case of sibling or half-sibling incest, these numbers are lower.

== Paternity issues ==

A paternity test is conducted to prove paternity, that is, whether a male is the biological father of another individual. This may be relevant in view of rights and duties of the father. Similarly, a maternity test can be carried out. This is less common, because at least during childbirth and pregnancy, except in the case of a pregnancy involving embryo transfer or egg donation, it is obvious who the mother is. However, it is used in a number of events such as legal battles where a person&#x27;s maternity is challenged, where the mother is uncertain because she has not seen her child for an extended period of time, or where deceased persons need to be identified.

Although not constituting completely reliable evidence, several congenital traits such as attached earlobes, a widow&#x27;s peak, or the cleft chin, may serve as tentative indicators of (non-) parenthood as they are readily observable and inherited via autosomal-dominant genes.

A more reliable way to ascertain parenthood is via DNA analysis (known as genetic fingerprinting of individuals), although older methods have included ABO blood group typing, analysis of various other proteins and enzymes, or using human leukocyte antigens. The current techniques for paternity testing are using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. For the most part, however, genetic fingerprinting has all but taken over all the other forms of testing.

== Roles and responsibilities ==

=== Guardianship ===
A legal guardian is a person who has the legal authority (and the corresponding duty) to care for the personal and property interests of another person, called a ward. Guardians are typically used in three situations: guardianship for an incapacitated senior (due to old age or infirmity), guardianship for a minor, and guardianship for developmentally disabled adults.

Most countries and states have laws that provide that the parents of a minor child are the legal guardians of that child, and that the parents can designate who shall become the child&#x27;s legal guardian in the event of death, subject to the approval of the court. Some jurisdictions allow a parent of a child to exercise the authority of a legal guardian without a formal court appointment. In such circumstances the parent acting in that capacity is called the natural guardian of that parent&#x27;s child.

=== Parenting ===
Parenting or child rearing is the process of promoting and supporting the physical, emotional, social, financial, and intellectual development of a child from infancy to adulthood. Parenting refers to the aspects of raising a child aside from the biological relationship.

== Gender and gender mix ==
A child has at least one biological father and at least one biological mother, but not every family is a traditional nuclear family. There are many variants, such as adoption, shared parenting, stepfamilies, and LGBT parenting, over which there has been controversy.

The social science literature rejects the notion that there is an optimal gender mix of parents or that children and adolescents with same-sex parents suffer any developmental disadvantages compared with those with two opposite-sex parents. The professionals and the major associations now agree there is a well-established and accepted consensus in the field that there is no optimal gender combination of parents. The family studies literature indicates that it is family processes (such as the quality of parenting and relationships within the family) that contribute to determining children&#x27;s well-being and &quot;outcomes&quot;, rather than family structures, per se, such as the number, gender, sexuality and co-habitation status of parents.

== Genetics ==

=== Parent–offspring conflict ===
An offspring who hates their father is called a misopater, one that hates their mother is a misomater, while a parent that hates their offspring is a misopedist. Parent–offspring conflict describes the evolutionary conflict arising from differences in optimal fitness of parents and their offspring. While parents tend to maximize the number of offspring, the offspring can increase their fitness by getting a greater share of parental investment often by competing with their siblings. The theory was proposed by Robert Trivers in 1974 and extends the more general selfish gene theory and has been used to explain many observed biological phenomena. For example, in some bird species, although parents often lay two eggs and attempt to raise two or more young, the strongest fledgling takes a greater share of the food brought by parents and will often kill the weaker sibling, an act known as siblicide.

===Empathy===
David Haig has argued that human fetal genes would be selected to draw more resources from the mother than it would be optimal for the mother to give, a hypothesis that has received empirical support. The placenta, for example, secretes allocrine hormones that decrease the sensitivity of the mother to insulin and thus make a larger supply of blood sugar available to the fetus. The mother responds by increasing the level of insulin in her bloodstream, the placenta has insulin receptors that stimulate the production of insulin-degrading enzymes which counteract this effect.

==Having children and happiness==

In Europe, parents are generally happier than non-parents. In women, happiness increases after the first child, but having higher-order children is not associated with further increased well-being. Happiness seems to increase most in the year before and after the first childbirth.

<text>Birth is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring, also referred to in technical contexts as parturition. In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe.

In some species, the offspring is precocial and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others, it is altricial and completely dependent on parenting.

In marsupials, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestation and develops further in its mother&#x27;s womb pouch.

It is not only mammals that give birth. Some reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates carry their developing young inside them. Some of these are ovoviviparous, with the eggs being hatched inside the mother&#x27;s body, and others are viviparous, with the embryo developing inside their body, as in the case of mammals.

==Human childbirth==

Humans usually produce a single offspring at a time. The mother&#x27;s body is prepared for birth by hormones produced by the pituitary gland, the ovary and the placenta. The total gestation period from fertilization to birth is normally about 38 weeks (birth usually occurring 40 weeks after the last menstrual period). The normal process of childbirth takes several hours and has three stages. The first stage starts with a series of involuntary contractions of the muscular walls of the uterus and gradual dilation of the cervix. The active phase of the first stage starts when the cervix is dilated more than about 4 cm in diameter and is when the contractions become stronger and regular. The head (or the buttocks in a breech birth) of the baby is pushed against the cervix, which gradually dilates until it is fully dilated at 10 cm diameter. At some time, the amniotic sac bursts and the amniotic fluid escapes (also known as rupture of membranes or breaking the water). In stage two, starting when the cervix is fully dilated, strong contractions of the uterus and active pushing by the mother expels the baby out through the vagina, which during this stage of labour is called a birth canal as this passage contains a baby, and the baby is born with umbilical cord attached. In stage three, which begins after the birth of the baby, further contractions expel the placenta, amniotic sac, and the remaining portion of the umbilical cord usually within a few minutes.

Enormous changes take place in the newborn&#x27;s circulation to enable breathing in air. In the uterus, the fetus is dependent on circulation of blood through the placenta for sustenance including gaseous exchange and the unborn baby&#x27;s blood bypasses the lungs by flowing through the foramen ovale, which is a hole in the septum dividing the right atrium and left atrium. After birth the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the baby starts to breathe air, and blood from the right ventricle starts to flow to the lungs for gaseous exchange and oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium, which is pumped into the left ventricle, and then pumped into the main arterial system. As a result of these changes, the blood pressure in the left atrium exceeds the pressure in the right atrium, and this pressure difference forces the foramen ovale to close separating the left and right sides of the heart. The umbilical vein, umbilical arteries, ductus venosus and ductus arteriosus are not needed for life in air and in time these vessels become ligaments (embryonic remnants).

==Other mammals==
Large mammals, such as primates, cattle, horses, some antelopes, giraffes, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, elephants, seals, whales, dolphins, and porpoises, generally are pregnant with one offspring at a time, although they may have twin or multiple births on occasion.

In these large animals, the birth process is similar to that of a human, though in most the offspring is precocial. This means that it is born in a more advanced state than a human baby and is able to stand, walk and run (or swim in the case of an aquatic mammal) shortly after birth.

In the case of whales, dolphins and porpoises, the single calf is normally born tail first which minimizes the risk of drowning. The mother encourages the newborn calf to rise to the surface of the water to breathe.

Large mammals which give birth to twins is much more rare, but it does occur occasionally even for mammals as large as elephants. In April 2018, approximately 8-month old elephant twins were sighted joining their mother&#x27;s herd in the Tarangire National Park of Tanzania, estimated to have been born in August 2017.

===Cattle===

Birthing in cattle is typical of a larger mammal. A cow goes through three stages of labor during normal delivery of a calf. During stage one, the animal seeks a quiet place away from the rest of the herd. Hormone changes cause soft tissues of the birth canal to relax as the mother&#x27;s body prepares for birth. The contractions of the uterus are not obvious externally, but the cow may be restless. She may appear agitated, alternating between standing and lying down, with her tail slightly raised and her back arched. The fetus is pushed toward the birth canal by each contraction and the cow&#x27;s cervix gradually begins to dilate. Stage one may last several hours, and ends when the cervix is fully dilated. Stage two can be seen to be underway when there is external protrusion of the amniotic sac through the vulva, closely followed by the appearance of the calf&#x27;s front hooves and head in a front presentation (or occasionally the calf&#x27;s tail and rear end in a posterior presentation). During the second stage, the cow will usually lie down on her side to push and the calf progresses through the birth canal. The complete delivery of the calf (or calves in a multiple birth) signifies the end of stage two. The cow scrambles to her feet (if lying down at this stage), turns round and starts vigorously licking the calf. The calf takes its first few breaths and within minutes is struggling to rise to its feet. The third and final stage of labor is the delivery of the placenta, which is usually expelled within a few hours and is often eaten by the normally herbivorous cow.

===Dogs===

Birth is termed whelping in dogs. Among dogs, as whelping approaches, contractions become more frequent. Labour in the bitch can be divided into 3 stages. The first stage is when the cervix dilates, causing discomfort and restlessness in the dog. Common signs of this stage are panting, fasting, and/or vomiting. This may last up to 12 hours. Stage two is the passage of the offspring. The amniotic sac looking like a glistening grey balloon, with a puppy inside, is propelled through the vulva. After further contractions, the sac is expelled and the bitch breaks the membranes, releasing clear fluid and exposing the puppy. The mother chews at the umbilical cord and licks the puppy vigorously, which stimulates it to breathe. If the puppy has not taken its first breath within about six minutes, it is likely to die. Further puppies follow in a similar way one by one usually with less straining than the first usually at 15-60-minute intervals. If a pup has not been passed in 2 hours a veterinarian should be contacted. Stage three is the passing of the placentas. This often occurs in conjunction with stage two with the passing of each offspring. The mother will then usually eat the afterbirth. This is an adaption to keep the den clean and prevent its detection by predators.

===Marsupials===
An infant marsupial is born in a very immature state. The gestation period is usually shorter than the intervals between oestrus periods. The first sign that a birth is imminent is the mother cleaning out her pouch. When it is born, the infant is pink, blind, furless and a few centimetres long. It has nostrils in order to breathe and forelegs to cling onto its mother&#x27;s hairs but its hind legs are undeveloped. It crawls through its mother&#x27;s fur and makes its way into the pouch. Here it fixes onto a teat which swells inside its mouth. It stays attached to the teat for several months until it is sufficiently developed to emerge. Joeys are born with &quot;oral shields&quot;; in species without pouches or with rudimentary pouches these are more developed than in forms with well-developed pouches, implying a role in maintaining the young attached to the mother&#x27;s nipple.

==Other animals==

Many reptiles and the vast majority of invertebrates, most fish, amphibians and all birds are oviparous, that is, they lay eggs with little or no embryonic development taking place within the mother. In aquatic organisms, fertilization is nearly always external with sperm and eggs being liberated into the water (an exception is sharks and rays, which have internal fertilization). Millions of eggs may be produced with no further parental involvement, in the expectation that a small number may survive to become mature individuals. Terrestrial invertebrates may also produce large numbers of eggs, a few of which may avoid predation and carry on the species. Some fish, reptiles, and amphibians have adopted a different strategy and invest their effort in producing a small number of young at a more advanced stage which are more likely to survive to adulthood. Birds care for their young in the nest and provide for their needs after hatching and it is perhaps unsurprising that internal development does not occur in birds, given their need to fly.

Ovoviviparity is a mode of reproduction in which embryos develop inside eggs that remain in the mother&#x27;s body until they are ready to hatch. Ovoviviparous animals are similar to viviparous species in that there is internal fertilization and the young are born in an advanced state, but differ in that there is no placental connection and the unborn young are nourished by egg yolk. The mother&#x27;s body provides gas exchange (respiration), but that is largely necessary for oviparous animals as well. In many sharks the eggs hatch in the oviduct within the mother&#x27;s body and the embryos are nourished by the egg&#x27;s yolk and fluids secreted by glands in the walls of the oviduct. The Lamniforme sharks practice &quot;oophagy&quot;, where the first embryos to hatch consume the remaining eggs and sand tiger shark pups cannibalistically consume neighbouring embryos. The requiem sharks maintain a &quot;placental&quot; link to the developing young, this practice is known as viviparity. This is more analogous to mammalian gestation than to that of other fishes. In all these cases, the young are born alive and fully functional. The majority of caecilians are ovoviviparous and give birth to already developed offspring. When the young have finished their yolk sacs they feed on nutrients secreted by cells lining the oviduct and even the cells themselves which they eat with specialist scraping teeth. The Alpine salamander (&quot;Salamandra atra&quot;) and several species of Tanzanian toad in the genus &quot;Nectophrynoides&quot; are ovoviviparous, developing through the larval stage inside the mother&#x27;s oviduct and eventually emerging as fully formed juveniles.

A more developed form of viviparity called placental viviparity is adopted by some species of scorpions and cockroaches, certain genera of sharks, snakes and velvet worms. In these, the developing embryo is nourished by some form of placental structure. The earliest known placenta was found recently in a group of extinct fishes called placoderms. A fossil from Australia&#x27;s Gogo Formation, laid down in the Devonian period, 380 million years ago, was found with an embryo inside it connected by an umbilical cord to a yolk sac. The find confirmed the hypothesis that a sub-group of placoderms, called ptyctodontids, fertilized their eggs internally. Some fishes that fertilize their eggs internally also give birth to live young, as seen here. This discovery moved our knowledge of live birth back 200 million years. The fossil of another genus was found with three embryos in the same position. Placoderms are a sister group of the ancestor of all living jawed fishes (Gnathostomata), including both chondrichthyans, the sharks &amp; rays, and Osteichthyes, the bony fishes.

Among lizards, the viviparous lizard &quot;Zootoca vivipara&quot;, the Jackson&#x27;s chameleon, slow worms and many species of skink are viviparous, giving birth to live young. Some are ovoviviparous but others such as members of the genera &quot;Tiliqua&quot; and &quot;Corucia&quot;, give birth to live young that develop internally, deriving their nourishment from a mammal-like placenta attached to the inside of the mother&#x27;s uterus. In a recently described example, an African species, &quot;Trachylepis ivensi&quot;, has developed a purely reptilian placenta directly comparable in structure and function to a mammalian placenta. Vivipary is rare in snakes, but boas and vipers are viviparous, giving birth to live young.
The majority of insects lay eggs but a very few give birth to offspring that are miniature versions of the adult. The aphid has a complex life cycle and during the summer months is able to multiply with great rapidity. Its reproduction is typically parthenogenetic and viviparous and females produce unfertilized eggs which they retain within their bodies. The embryos develop within their mothers&#x27; ovarioles and the offspring are clones of their mothers. Female nymphs are born which grow rapidly and soon produce more female offspring themselves. In some instances, the newborn nymphs already have developing embryos inside them.

<text>Latrun (, &quot;Latrun&quot;; , &quot;al-Latrun&quot;) is a strategic hilltop in the Latrun salient in the Ayalon Valley. It overlooks the road between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, 25 kilometers west of Jerusalem and 14 kilometers southeast of Ramla. It was the site of fierce fighting during the 1948 war. During the period of 1949–1967, it was occupied by Jordan at the edge of a no man&#x27;s land between the armistice lines. In the 1967 war, it was occupied by Israel.

The hilltop includes the Latrun Abbey, Mini Israel (a park with scale models of historic buildings around Israel), The International Center for the Study of Bird Migration (ICSBM), the Yad La-Shiryon memorial to armored corps soldiers killed in action, and military tank museum. Neve Shalom (Oasis of Peace) is a joint Israeli-Palestinian community on a hilltop south of Latrun. Canada Park is nearby to the east.

==Etymology==
The name Latrun is derived from the ruins of a medieval Crusader castle. There are two theories regarding the origin of the name. One is that it is a corruption of the Old French &quot;La toron des chevaliers&quot;, or of the Castilian &quot;La torón de los caballeros&quot; (The Castle of the Knights), so named by the Knights Templar, or by its Castilian founder, Rodrigo Gonzales de Lara (see below). The other is that it is from the Latin, &quot;Domus boni Latronis&quot; (The House of the Good &quot;&quot;), a name given by 14th-century Christian pilgrims after the penitent thief who was crucified by the Romans alongside Jesus ().

==History==
===In the Hebrew Bible===
In the Hebrew Bible, the Ayalon Valley was the site of a battle in which the Israelites, led by Joshua, defeated the Amorites ().

===Hellenistic period===
Later, Judah Maccabee established his camp here in preparation for battle with the Seleucid Greeks, who had invaded Judea and were camped at Emmaus; this site is today identified by archaeologists as Hurvat Eked. According to the Book of Maccabees, Judah Maccabee learned that the Greeks were planning to march on his position, and successfully ambushed the invaders. The Jewish victory in what was later called the Battle of Emmaus led to greater Jewish autonomy under Hasmonean rule over the next century.

===Crusader period===
Little remains of the castle, which was reputedly built in 1130s by a Castilian nobleman Rodrigo González de Lara who later gave it to the Templars. The main tower was later surrounded with a rectangular enclosure with vaulted chambers. This in turn was enclosed by an outer court, of which one tower survives.

===Ottoman period===
====Village====
Walid Khalidi in his book &quot;All That Remains&quot; describes al-Latrun as a small village established in the late 19th century by villagers from nearby Emmaus.

In 1883, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described Latrun as a few adobe huts among the ruins of a medieval fortress.
====Trappist monastery====
In December 1890, a monastery was established at Latrun by French, German and Flemish monks of the Trappist order, from Sept-Fons Abbey in France, at the request of Monseigneur Poyet of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The monastery(fr) is dedicated to Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows. The liturgy is in French. The monks bought the &#x27;Maccabee Hotel&#x27;, formerly called &#x27;The Howard&#x27; from the Batato brothers together with two-hundred hectares of land and started the community in a building which still stands in the monastic domain. The old monastery complex was built between 1891 and 1897. In 1909 it was given the status of a priory and that of an abbey in 1937. The community was expelled by the Ottoman Turks between 1914–1918 and the buildings pillaged, a new monastery being built during the next three decades.

The monks established a vineyard using knowledge gained in France and advice from an expert in the employ of Baron Edmond James de Rothschild from the Carmel-Mizrahi Winery. Today they produce a wide variety of wines that are sold in the Abbey shop and elsewhere.

===British Mandate===
In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &quot;Latrun&quot; had a population of 59, all Muslims. In addition, &quot;Dair Latrun&quot; (&quot;The monastery of Latrun&quot;) had a population of 37 Christian males. In the 1931 census they were counted together, and Latrun had a population 120; 76 Muslims and 44 Christians, in a total of 16 &quot;houses&quot;.

During WWI the monastery sustained significant damage. Latrun and its environs saw heavy fighting during the Sinai and Palestine campaign, an offensive launched in the fall of 1917 by the Entente powers against the Ottoman Empire and its allies. The monastery&#x27;s interior furnishings, as well as all of its windows and doors, were either looted or destroyed as a result of the conflict. After the war, a new monastery was built at Latrun in 1926, and the crypt was completed in 1933. However the church was again damaged during the Arab-Israeli war of 1948, and required further restoration. This work was completed, and the church officially consecrated, on 21 November 1953. The monastery was designed by the community&#x27;s first abbot, Dom Paul Couvreur, and is an example of Cistercian architecture. Many of the stained-glass windows were produced by a monk of the community.

A Juniorate, a school for young boys, ran from 1931 until 1963 and provided many vocations for the community, especially of Lebanese monks.

Following the 1936–39 Arab revolt, the British authorities built a number of police forts (named Tegart forts after their designer) at various locations; Latrun was chosen due to its strategic significance, particularly its dominant position above the Tel-Aviv-Jerusalem road. Many members of the Yishuv who had resisted the British administration were imprisoned in a detention camp at Latrun. Moshe Sharett, later Israel&#x27;s second Prime Minister, and several other members of the Jewish Agency&#x27;s Executive Committee, were held at Latrun for several months in 1946.

As of the 1945 statistics, the population of the Latrun village had grown to 190 Christians, with a total of 8,376 dunams of land. Of this, a total of 6,705 dunams were used for cereals, 439 dunams were irrigated or used for orchards, 7 for citrus and bananas, while 4 dunams were classified as built-up public areas.


===1948 and 1967 Arab–Israeli Wars===

The road from the coastal plain to Jerusalem was blocked after the British withdrew and handed the fort of Latrun over to Jordan&#x27;s Arab Legion. The Arab Legionnaires used the fort to shell Israeli vehicles traveling on the road below, effectively imposing a military siege on Jerusalem and the Jewish residents there, despite that the United Nations plan was to keep Jerusalem as an international zone with neither Jordan, Israel, nor the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee having sovereignty over it.

On 24 May 1948, ten days after the Israeli Declaration of Independence per the United Nations General Assembly&#x27;s Resolution 181 and the Arab assaults against Israel which followed, the Jordanian Legion&#x27;s fort was assaulted by combined forces of Israel&#x27;s newly created 7th Armored Brigade, and a battalion of the Alexandroni Brigade. Ariel Sharon, then a platoon commander, was wounded at Latrun along with many of his soldiers. The assault, codenamed Operation Bin Nun Alef (24–25 May), was unsuccessful, sustaining heavy casualties. On 31 May 1948, a second attack against the fort, codenamed Operation Bin Nun Bet, also failed, although the outer defenses had been breached.

Many of the Israeli fighters were young Holocaust survivors who had just arrived in the country and had minimal military training. The official casualty figure for both battles was 139.
To circumvent the blocked road, a makeshift camouflaged road through the seemingly impassable mountains towards Jerusalem was constructed under the command of Mickey (David) Marcus. This bypassed the main routes overlooked by Latrun and was named the Burma Road after its emergency supply-line namesake between Kunming (China) and Lashio (Burma), improvised by the Allies in World War II. By 10 June 1948, the road was fully operational, putting an end to the month-old Arab blockade.

On 2 August, the Truce Commission drew the attention of the Security Council to the Arabs&#x27; refusal to allow water and food supplies to reach Jewish West Jerusalem. After much negotiation, it was agreed that United Nations convoys would transport supplies, but the convoys often came under sniper fire. Towards the end of August, the situation improved. The destruction of the Latrun pumping station made it impossible for water in adequate quantities to flow to West Jerusalem, but the Israelis built an auxiliary small-capacity water pipeline along the &quot;Burma Road&quot;, which provided a minimum amount of water.

After Operation Danny, Israeli forces anticipated a Jordanian counterattack, possibly from Latrun, but King Abdullah remained within the bounds of the tacit agreement made with the Jewish Agency and kept his troops at Latrun.

In the 1949 Armistice Agreements, the fort remained a salient under Jordanian control, which was in turn surrounded by a perimeter of no man&#x27;s land. Under the cease-fire agreement, Jordan was not to disrupt Israeli travelers using this road; in practice, constant sniper attacks led Israel to build a bypass road around the bulge.

In the Six-Day War of 1967, Latrun was captured by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), and the main road to Jerusalem was reopened and made safe for travel. 


===Since the Six-Day War===
The Latrun monastic community allowed two communities, Neve Shalom/Wahat as-Salam and an affiliate of the , to be established on its land.
The Tegart fort became the Yad La-Shiryon memorial for the fallen soldiers of the Israeli Armored Corps and a museum was established there.

<doc id="83448" wikidata="Q911699" url="?curid=83448" title="Pumping Iron">
<text>Pumping Iron is a 1977 American docudrama about the world of professional bodybuilding, with a focus on the 1975 IFBB Mr. Universe and 1975 Mr. Olympia competitions. Directed by George Butler and Robert Fiore and edited by Geof Bartz and Larry Silk, it is inspired by the 1974 book of the same name by photographer Butler and writer Charles Gaines and nominally centers on the competition between Arnold Schwarzenegger and one of his primary competitors for the title of Mr. Olympia, Lou Ferrigno. The film also features segments on bodybuilders Franco Columbu and Mike Katz, in addition to appearances by Ken Waller, Ed Corney, Serge Nubret, and other famous bodybuilders of the era.

Shot during the 100 days leading up to the Mr. Universe and Mr. Olympia competitions and during the competitions themselves, the filmmakers ran out of funds to finish production and it stalled for two years. Ultimately, Schwarzenegger and other bodybuilders featured in the film helped raise funds to complete production, and it was released in 1977. The film became a box office success, making Schwarzenegger a household name. The film also served to popularize the culture of bodybuilding, which was somewhat niche at the time, and helped inspire the fitness craze of the 1980s; following the film&#x27;s release, there was a marked increase in the number of commercial gyms in the U.S.

The film was released on CED and VHS, and then re-released on DVD in 2003 for the 25th anniversary of the theatrical debut. The film inspired three sequels: George Butler&#x27;s &quot;Pumping Iron II: The Women&quot; (1985), a documentary about the world of female bodybuilding; David and Scott McVeigh&#x27;s &quot;Raw Iron&quot; (2002), a documentary about the making of &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; and how the film affected the lives of those who appeared in it; and Vlad Yudin&#x27;s &quot;Generation Iron&quot; (2013), a documentary on which &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; producer Jerome Gary served as executive producer.

==Plot==
In 1975, bodybuilders are preparing for the upcoming Mr. Universe amateur competition and Mr. Olympia professional competition in Pretoria, South Africa. The first part of the film documents the life of Mike Katz, a hopeful for the title of Mr. Universe. Katz was bullied in his youth for being Jewish and wearing glasses, which spurred him to become a pro football player; when his career with the New York Jets was ended by a leg injury, he became a bodybuilder. His psychological balance is thrown off by a prank by fellow contender Ken Waller, who steals Katz&#x27;s lucky shirt before the competition. Waller wins Mr. Universe and Katz comes in fourth. Fighting back tears, Katz cheerfully appraises the situation before calling home to check on his wife and children. He then congratulates Waller.

The film then switches focus to the rivalry between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno, professional bodybuilders competing for the title of Mr. Olympia. Schwarzenegger, at this point a ten-year veteran of bodybuilding, has won Mr. Olympia for five consecutive years and intends to retire after a final competition. Ferrigno, who at a height of 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) and 275 lb (125 kg) is the largest bodybuilder to date, is determined to be the man to finally dethrone Schwarzenegger. The film contrasts each man&#x27;s personality, home environment, and training style: Schwarzenegger is extroverted, aggressive, and works out with other bodybuilders at Gold&#x27;s Gym and Muscle Beach, whereas the quiet, reserved Ferrigno—who went partially deaf after a childhood ear infection—trains with his father in a dimly lit, private, basement gym. While Ferrigno surrounds himself with his family, Schwarzenegger is accompanied wherever he goes by other bodybuilders, reporters, and beautiful women.

In between interviews and workout demonstrations with Ferrigno and Schwarzenegger, the latter explains the basic concepts behind bodybuilding. Although he emphasizes the importance of physique in bodybuilding, Schwarzenegger also stresses the psychological aspects of competition, crediting his use of psychological warfare for his numerous victories. The film briefly looks at Schwarzenegger&#x27;s training partner, Franco Columbu, a favorite to win the under-200 lb division at Mr. Olympia. A former boxer from the tiny village of Ollolai, Sardinia, Columbu returns home to celebrate a traditional dinner with his family, who still adhere to old world values and are skeptical of the overt aggression of boxing and bodybuilding. Nevertheless, Columbu impresses his family with a display of strength by lifting up the back end of a car and angling it so it can escape a tight parking spot.

In South Africa, Schwarzenegger wages his psychological warfare on Ferrigno, befriending Ferrigno and then subtly insulting him over breakfast with Ferrigno&#x27;s family. Schwarzenegger later attends the judging for the under-200 lb class to scope out who his competition will be for the overall Mr. Olympia title, jokingly disparaging Columbu. The appearance of Ed Corney stuns Schwarzenegger, who praises another bodybuilder for the only time in the film, openly admiring Corney&#x27;s physique and posing prowess. Columbu places first and he moves on to compete against the winner of the over-200 lb category.

Schwarzenegger, Ferrigno, and Serge Nubret prepare to go onstage and compete for the over-200 lb category. In the locker room, Schwarzenegger engages in some last-minute intimidation of Ferrigno, who is visibly shaken onstage and subsequently ends up placing third behind Nubret and Schwarzenegger, who is declared the winner. Schwarzenegger and Columbu engage in a posedown for the title of Mr. Olympia. Schwarzenegger uses his stage presence and intimidating looks to unnerve Columbu, and is declared Mr. Olympia. In a post-victory speech, he announces his official retirement from professional bodybuilding. Later, at an after-party for the competitors, Schwarzenegger celebrates his victory by smoking marijuana and eating fried chicken. With the competition over, he wishes Ferrigno happy birthday and leads the other competitors in singing &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; as a cake is revealed. The film ends with Schwarzenegger, Ferrigno, and Ferrigno&#x27;s parents riding together to the airport, with Schwarzenegger saying he is returning back home to Austria to celebrate with his family.

==Production==
George Butler asked approximately 3000 people to help finance his bodybuilding documentary, showing them 10 minutes of footage of Schwarzenegger that Butler shot at an amusement park. He eventually raised $400,000. Schwarzenegger was focused on acting and reluctant to compete in another Mr. Olympia, but he said yes after Butler agreed to pay him $50,000. Filming took place over 14 weeks in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Montreal, Paris, South Africa, and a mountain village in Sardinia (Franco Columbu&#x27;s childhood home).

The film began as a look at bodybuilding from the perspective of a newcomer to the sport; to this end, the production had hired slim actor Bud Cort, with the intention of following Cort&#x27;s development from a physically slight man to a muscular, strong bodybuilder. Cort trained at Gold&#x27;s Gym for a brief period, taking lessons from Schwarzenegger, but ultimately felt that he was wrong for the project; Cort and the producers amicably parted ways, and the documentary team began to focus more intently on the established bodybuilders at Gold&#x27;s.

In order to compensate for the loss of Cort&#x27;s narrative arc, Butler decided to capitalize on Schwarzenegger and Ferrigno&#x27;s contrasting personalities and cast the film as the story of a heroic but &quot;sinister&quot; underdog (Ferrigno) against a charismatic, powerful &quot;villain&quot; (Schwarzenegger). To this end, Butler intentionally avoided filming Ferrigno&#x27;s training sequences with bright lighting and emphasized the open-air atmosphere of Gold&#x27;s Gym and the sunlight at Muscle Beach for Schwarzenegger&#x27;s training sequences. Schwarzenegger claims to have helped Butler in casting himself as a villain, citing his story about not returning home for his father&#x27;s funeral as having been told to him by a French bodybuilder; however, following the film&#x27;s release, claims surfaced that Schwarzenegger had in fact refused to attend the funeral. Butler additionally cast the relationship between Mike Katz and Ken Waller as a sinister rivalry, filming the &quot;football scene&quot; where Waller decides to steal Katz&#x27;s shirt after the fact in order to fill in a narrative gap. Waller and Katz were in fact close friends, and Waller&#x27;s theft of the shirt was simply a spur-of-the-moment prank not intended to upset Katz to the extent that it did. Waller was later regretful of the football sequence, claiming that audiences at bodybuilding competitions continued to boo him for years after the film&#x27;s release.

Following the Mr. Olympia contest, the production ran out of money and ended up in development hell for nearly two years. In an effort to raise funds, Butler arranged an exhibit with the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City: Bodybuilders would become &quot;living sculptures,&quot; posing on rotating platforms while art critics analyzed the aesthetics of the bodybuilding physique and compared and contrasted the men to Greek sculpture. To increase interest in the event, Butler arranged for Candice Bergen to be a celebrity commentator; Schwarzenegger also agreed to appear as one of the &quot;living sculptures&quot;, having received modest attention for his Golden Globe-winning appearance in the film &quot;Stay Hungry&quot;. The event proved to be a great success, generating more money than Butler had anticipated and allowing him to complete production on the film.

Upon its release, &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; became a commercial and critical success. Schwarzenegger&#x27;s popularity grew beyond that afforded him by &quot;Stay Hungry&quot;. Ferrigno was shortly thereafter cast as &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, a role he would continue to play in a variety of mediums into the 2010s. Although bodybuilding had been a subculture regarded by many as being on par with early 20th century freak shows prior to the film&#x27;s release, the film normalized the idea to the point that interest in bodybuilding began spreading into mainstream American culture. In the years following the film&#x27;s release, hundreds of commercial gyms began appearing across the United States as demand rose for access to weightlifting equipment.

==Reception==

The film received positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 92%, with an average rating of 7/10. The critical consensus reads, &quot;In addition to offering an enlightening early look into the world of future star/politician Arnold Schwarzenegger, &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; provides a witty and insightful overview of competitive bodybuilding.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 72% based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Richard Eder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;an interesting, rather slick and excessively long documentary about the small but intensely competitive world of bodybuilding.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Technical credits are generally excellent with Fiore&#x27;s camerawork a major asset. Commercial aspects will depend on the interest in local markets in the sport itself. Certainly, after the first quarter hour of flexing muscles, they all begin to look alike to the non-athletic viewer.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;The film allows us to get to know two bodybuilders very well, and, as a result, &#x27;Pumping Iron&#x27; is much more a story of human beings than it is a freak show. I actually ended up caring who won the contest.&quot; He ranked it #9 in his year-end list of the best films of 1977.

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Directed by Butler and Robert Fiore, who is also the film&#x27;s very adroit cinematographer, the witty and entertaining &#x27;Pumping Iron&#x27; confronts what has been generally considered as a rather exotic subculture with the utmost sophistication. Butler and Fiore regard the bodybuilders with neither compassion nor ridicule but rather a steadfast, cool detachment—even when they themselves are being nakedly manipulative—which makes for a slick, shrewdly calculated, highly amusing and thoroughly enjoyable experience.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;an amusing, buoyant documentary about competitive body building,&quot; and observed that &quot;Schwarzenegger is the first personality since Bruce Lee who might become a unique and credible &quot;physical&quot; star, idolized in particular by kids but enjoyed and admired by a vast cross-section of the public.&quot; Louise Sweet of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that Schwarzenegger &quot;inspires envy rather than disgust at ostentatious musculature, and lures even the reluctant viewer into his unusual world. Almost all the body-builders here are likable, but Schwarzenegger&#x27;s articulateness and humour make the film cohere and convince.&quot;

==&quot;Raw Iron&quot;==
For the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary, filmmakers David and Scott McVeigh tracked down the participants in &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; to follow up on their lives and see how the film&#x27;s success had affected them personally and professionally. The resultant film, &quot;Raw Iron&quot;, also served to document the making of &quot;Pumping Iron&quot;, exploring the difficulties that Butler had in producing the film and the narrative choices he made. 

&quot;Raw Iron&quot; also debunked much of the drama in &quot;Pumping Iron&quot;, such as a cold comment by Schwarzenegger about why he did not attend his father&#x27;s funeral, and the fact that Matty Ferrigno, Lou&#x27;s father, had not previously been involved in his son&#x27;s training and was brought into the production for dramatic purposes. The film originally aired on Starz, and was later featured as an extra on the DVD of &quot;Pumping Iron&quot;.

<text>Childbirth, also known as labour, parturition and delivery, is the completion of pregnancy where one or more babies exits the internal environment of the mother via vaginal delivery or caesarean section. In 2019, there were about 140.11 million human births globally. In developed countries, most deliveries occur in hospitals, while in developing countries most are home births.
The most common childbirth method worldwide is vaginal delivery. It involves four stages of labour: the shortening and opening of the cervix during the first stage, descent and birth of the baby during the second, the delivery of the placenta during the third, and the recovery of the mother and infant during the fourth stage, which is referred to as the postpartum. The first stage is characterised by abdominal cramping or also back pain in the case of back labour, that typically lasts half a minute and occurs every 10 to 30 minutes. Contractions gradually become stronger and closer together. Since the pain of childbirth correlates with contractions, the pain becomes more frequent and strong as the labour progresses. The second stage ends when the infant is fully expelled. The third stage is the delivery of the placenta. The fourth stage of labour involves the recovery of the mother, delayed clamping of the umbilical cord, and monitoring of the neonate. All major health organisations advise that immediately after giving birth, regardless of the delivery method, that the infant be placed on the mother&#x27;s chest (termed skin-to-skin contact), and to delay any other routine procedures for at least one to two hours or until the baby has had its first breastfeeding.
Vaginal delivery is generally recommended as a first option. Cesarean section can lead to increased risk of complications and a significantly slower recovery. There are also many natural benefits of a vaginal delivery in both mother and baby. Various methods may help with pain, such as relaxation techniques, opioids, and spinal blocks. It is best practice to limit the amount of interventions that occur during labour and delivery such as an elective cesarean section. However in some cases a scheduled cesarean section must be planned for a successful delivery and recovery of the mother. An emergency cesarean section may be recommended if unexpected complications occur or little to no progression through the birthing canal is observed in a vaginal delivery.

Each year, complications from pregnancy and childbirth result in about 500,000 birthing deaths, seven million women have serious long-term problems, and 50 million women giving birth have negative health outcomes following delivery, most of which occur in the developing world. Complications in the mother include obstructed labour, postpartum bleeding, eclampsia, and postpartum infection. Complications in the baby include lack of oxygen at birth (birth asphyxia), birth trauma, and prematurity.
==Signs and symptoms==
The most prominent sign of labour is strong repetitive uterine contractions. Pain in contractions has been described as feeling similar to very strong menstrual cramps. Crowning, when the baby&#x27;s head becomes visible, may be experienced as an intense stretching and burning.

Back labour is a complication that occurs during childbirth when the feet or the bottom of the baby is visible first (bottom-first presentation), instead of the being born head down (head-first presentation). This leads to more intense contractions, and causes pain in the lower back that persists between contractions as the back of the fetus’ head exerts pressure on the mother&#x27;s sacrum.

Another prominent sign of labour is the rupture of membranes, commonly known as &quot;water breaking&quot;. During pregnancy, a baby is surrounded and cushioned by a fluid-filled sac (the amniotic sac). Usually the sac ruptures at the beginning of or during labour. It may cause a gush of fluid or leak in an intermittent or constant flow of small amounts from a woman&#x27;s vagina. The fluid is clear or pale yellow. If the amniotic sac has not yet broken during labour the health care provider may break it in a technique called an amniotomy. In an amniotomy a thin plastic hook is used to make a small opening in the sac, causing the water to break. If the sac breaks before labour starts, it&#x27;s called a prelabour rupture of membranes. Contractions will typically start within 24 hours after the water breaks. If not, the care provider will generally begin labour induction within 24 to 48 hours. If the baby is preterm (less than 37 weeks of pregnancy), the healthcare provider may use a medication to delay delivery.

=== Labour pain ===

Labor pains have both visceral and somatic components. During the first and second stages of labour, uterine contractions cause stretching and opening of the cervix. This in turn triggers visceral pain in the inner cervix and lower segment of the spine. Somatic pain is triggered at the end of the first and second stages of labour by pain receptors that supply the nerves on the vaginal surface of the cervix, resulting from stretching, distention, and tearing of the vagina, perineum, and pelvic floor. Compared to visceral pain, somatic pain is more resistant to opioid pain medication. Nitrous oxide may be used in hospitals and birthing centers for this reason. 

Beyond physical pain, there are also well-documented biocultural and psychosocial aspects of labour pain and pain management. Pain is experienced distinctly by different cultures and there are various culturally-relevant interventions than can lessen labour pain, such as having extended female family members present during childbirth. Labour might be less painful in subsequent births, and this has been associated with lessened fear.

Pain management techniques during labour can include pain relief with medication (such as an epidural injection) or coping techniques (such as the Lamaze breathing).

=== Psychological ===

During the later stages of gestation, there is an increase in abundance of oxytocin, a hormone that is known to evoke feelings of contentment, reductions in anxiety, and feelings of calmness. Oxytocin is further released during labour when the fetus stimulates the cervix and vagina, and it is believed that it plays a major role in the bonding of a mother to her infant and in the establishment of maternal behaviour. The father of the child also has an increase in oxytocin levels following contact with the infant and parents with higher oxytocin levels show being more responsivene and &quot;in synch&quot; in their interactions with their infant. The act of nursing a child also causes a release of oxytocin to help the baby get milk more easily from the nipple.

== Vaginal birth ==

Station refers to the relationship of the fetal presenting part to the level of the ischial spines. When the presenting part is at the ischial spines the station is 0 (synonymous with engagement). If the presenting fetal part is above the spines, the distance is measured and described as minus stations, which range from −1 to −4 cm. If the presenting part is below the ischial spines, the distance is stated as plus stations ( +1 to +4 cm). At +3 and +4 the presenting part is at the perineum and can be seen.

The baby&#x27;s head may temporarily change shape (becoming more elongated or cone shaped) as it moves through the birth canal. This change in the shape of the fetal head is called &quot;molding&quot; and is much more prominent in women having their first vaginal delivery.

Cervical ripening is the physical and chemical changes in the cervix to prepare it for the stretching that will take place as the fetus moves out of the uterus and into the birth canal. A scoring system called a Bishop score can be used to judge the degree of cervical ripening to predict the timing of labour and delivery of the infant or for women at risk for preterm labour. It is also used to judge when a woman will respond to induction of labour for a postterm pregnancy or other medical reasons. There are several methods of inducing cervical ripening which will allow the uterine contractions to effectively dilate the cervix.

Vaginal delivery involves four stages of labour: the shortening and opening of the cervix during the first stage, descent and birth of the baby during the second, the delivery of the placenta during the third, and the fourth stage of recovery which lasts until two hours after the delivery. The first stage is characterised by abdominal cramping or back pain that typically lasts around half a minute and occurs every 10 to 30 minutes. The contractions (and pain) gradually becomes stronger and closer together. The second stage ends when the infant is fully expelled. In the third stage, the delivery of the placenta. The fourth stage of labour involves recovery, the uterus beginning to contract to pre-pregnancy state, delayed clamping of the umbilical cord, and monitoring of the neonatal tone and vitals. All major health organisations advise that immediately following a live birth, regardless of the delivery method, that the infant be placed on the mother&#x27;s chest, termed skin-to-skin contact, and delaying routine procedures for at least one to two hours or until the baby has had its first breastfeeding.

===Onset of labour===

Definitions of the onset of labour include:
* Regular uterine contractions at least every six minutes with evidence of change in cervical dilation or cervical effacement between consecutive digital examinations.
* Regular contractions occurring less than 10 minutes apart and progressive cervical dilation or cervical effacement.
* At least three painful regular uterine contractions during a 10-minute period, each lasting more than 45 seconds.

Common signs that labour is about to begin may include what is known as &quot;lightening&quot;, which is the process of the baby moving down from the rib cage with the head of the baby engaging deep in the pelvis. The pregnant woman may then find breathing easier, since her lungs have more room for expansion, but pressure on her bladder may cause more frequent need to urinate. Lightening may occur a few weeks or a few hours before labour begins, or even not until labour has begun. Some women also experience an increase in vaginal discharge several days before labour begins when the &quot;mucus plug&quot;, a thick plug of mucus that blocks the opening to the uterus, is pushed out into the vagina. The mucus plug may become dislodged days before labour begins or not until the start of labour.

While inside the uterus the baby is enclosed in a fluid-filled membrane called the amniotic sac. Shortly before, at the beginning of, or during labour the sac ruptures, commonly known as the &quot;water breaking&quot;. Once the sac ruptures the baby is at risk for infection and the mother&#x27;s medical team will assess the need to induce labour if it has not started within the time they believe to be safe for the infant.

===Stages of labour===
====First stage====
The first stage of labour is divided into latent and active phases, where the latent phase is sometimes included in the definition of labour, and sometimes not.

The latent phase is generally defined as beginning at the point at which the woman perceives regular uterine contractions. In contrast, Braxton Hicks contractions, which are contractions that may start around 26 weeks gestation and are sometimes called &quot;false labour&quot;, are infrequent, irregular, and involve only mild cramping. Braxton Hicks contractions are the uterine muscles preparing to deliver the infant.

Cervical effacement, which is the thinning and stretching of the cervix, and cervical dilation occur during the closing weeks of pregnancy. Effacement is usually complete or near-complete and dilation is about 5 cm by the end of the latent phase. The degree of cervical effacement and dilation may be felt during a vaginal examination.
The active phase of labour has geographically differing definitions. The World Health Organization describes the active first stage as &quot;a period of time characterised by regular painful uterine contractions, a substantial degree of cervical effacement and more rapid cervical dilatation from 5 cm until full dilatation for first and subsequent labours”. In the US, the definition of active labour was changed from 3 to 4 cm, to 5 cm of cervical dilation for mothers who had given birth previously, and at 6 cm for those who had not given birth before. This was done in an effort to increase the rates of vaginal delivery.

Health care providers may assess the mother&#x27;s progress in labour by performing a cervical exam to evaluate the cervical dilation, effacement, and station. These factors form the Bishop score. The Bishop score can also be used as a means to predict the success of an induction of labour.

During effacement, the cervix becomes incorporated into the lower segment of the uterus. During a contraction, uterine muscles contract causing shortening of the upper segment and drawing upwards of the lower segment, in a gradual expulsive motion. The presenting fetal part then is permitted to descend. Full dilation is reached when the cervix has widened enough to allow passage of the baby&#x27;s head, around 10 cm dilation for a term baby.

A standard duration of the latent first stage has not been established and can vary widely from one woman to another. However, the duration of active first stage (from 5 cm until full cervical dilatation) usually does not extend beyond 12 hours in the labour of first-time mothers, and usually does not extend beyond 10 hours in subsequent pregnancies.

==== Second stage ====

The second stage begins when the cervix is fully dilated, and ends when the baby is born. As pressure on the cervix increases, a sensation of pelvic pressure is experienced, and, with it, an urge to begin pushing. At the beginning of the normal second stage, the head is fully engaged in the pelvis; the widest diameter of the head has passed below the level of the pelvic inlet. The fetal head then continues descent into the pelvis, below the pubic arch and out through the vaginal opening. This is assisted by the additional maternal efforts of pushing, or bearing down, similar to defecation. The appearance of the fetal head at the vaginal opening is termed crowning. At this point, the mother will feel an intense burning or stinging sensation.

When the amniotic sac has not ruptured during labour or pushing, the infant can be born with the membranes intact. This is referred to as &quot;delivery en caul&quot;.

Complete expulsion of the baby signals the successful completion of the second stage of labour. Some babies, especially preterm infants, are born covered with a waxy or cheese-like white substance called vernix. It is thought to have some protective roles during fetal development and for a few hours after birth.

The second stage varies from one woman to another. In first labours, birth is usually completed within three hours whereas in subsequent
labours, birth is usually completed within two hours. Second-stage labours longer than three hours are associated with declining rates of spontaneous vaginal delivery and increasing rates of infection, perineal tears, and obstetric haemorrhage, as well as the need for intensive care of the neonate.

==== Third stage ====

The period from just after the fetus is expelled until just after the placenta is expelled is called the &quot;third stage of labour&quot; or the &quot;involution stage&quot;. Placental expulsion begins as a physiological separation from the wall of the uterus. The average time from delivery of the baby until complete expulsion of the placenta is estimated to be 10–12 minutes dependent on whether active or expectant management is employed. In as many as 3% of all vaginal deliveries, the duration of the third stage is longer than 30 minutes and raises concern for retained placenta.

Placental expulsion can be managed actively or it can be managed expectantly, allowing the placenta to be expelled without medical assistance. Active management is the administration of a uterotonic drug within one minute of fetal delivery, controlled traction of the umbilical cord and fundal massage after delivery of the placenta, followed by performance of uterine massage every 15 minutes for two hours. Active management of the third stage of labour in vaginal deliveries helps to prevent postpartum haemorrhage.

Delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord for at least one minute or until it ceases to pulsate, which may take several minutes, improves outcomes as long as there is the ability to treat jaundice if it occurs. For many years it was believed that late cord cutting led to a mother&#x27;s risk of experiencing significant bleeding after giving birth, called postpartum bleeding. However, delaying cord cutting in healthy full-term infants results in early haemoglobin concentration and higher birthweight and increased iron reserves up to six months after birth with no change in the rate of postpartum bleeding.

==== Postpartum period ====
Postpartum, sometimes termed the fourth stage of labour, is the period beginning immediately after childbirth, and extends for about six weeks. The terms &quot;postpartum&quot; and &quot;postnatal&quot; are often used for this period. The woman&#x27;s body, including hormone levels and uterus size, return to a non-pregnant state and the newborn adjusts to life outside the mother&#x27;s body. The World Health Organization (WHO) describes the postnatal period as the most critical and yet the most neglected phase in the lives of mothers and babies; most deaths occur during the postnatal period.

Following the birth, if the mother had an episiotomy or a tearing of the perineum, it is stitched. This is also an optimal time for uptake of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), such as the contraceptive implant or intrauterine device (IUD), both of which can be inserted immediately after delivery while the woman is still in the delivery room. The mother has regular assessments for uterine contraction and fundal height, vaginal bleeding, heart rate and blood pressure, and temperature, for the first 24 hours after birth. Some women may experience an uncontrolled episode of shivering or postpartum chills following the birth. The first passing of urine should be documented within six hours. Afterpains (pains similar to menstrual cramps), contractions of the uterus to prevent excessive blood flow, continue for several days. Vaginal discharge, termed &quot;lochia&quot;, can be expected to continue for several weeks; initially bright red, it gradually becomes pink, changing to brown, and finally to yellow or white.

At one time babies born in hospitals were removed from their mothers shortly after birth and brought to the mother only at feeding times. Mothers were told that their newborns would be safer in the nursery and that the separation would offer the mothers more time to rest. As attitudes began to change, some hospitals offered a &quot;rooming in&quot; option wherein after a period of routine hospital procedures and observation, the infant could be allowed to share the mother&#x27;s room. As of 2020, rooming-in has increasingly become standard practice in maternity wards.

===Early skin-to-skin contact===
Skin-to-skin contact (SSC), sometimes also called kangaroo care, is a technique of newborn care where babies are kept chest-to-chest and skin-to-skin with a parent, typically their mother or possibly the father. This means without the shirt or undergarments on the chest of both the baby and parent. Early skin-to-skin contact results in a decrease in infant crying, improves cardio-respiratory stability and blood glucose levels, and improves breastfeeding duration and effectiveness.

Early postpartum SSC is endorsed by all major organisations that are responsible for the well-being of infants. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that &quot;the process of
childbirth is not finished until the baby has safely transferred from placental to mammary nutrition.&quot; It is advised that the newborn be placed skin-to-skin with the mother following vaginal birth, or as soon as the mother is alert and responsive after a Caesarean section, postponing any routine procedures for at least one to two hours or until the baby has had its first breastfeeding. The baby&#x27;s father or other support person may also choose to hold the baby SSC until the mother recovers from the anaesthetic.

The WHO suggests that any initial observations of the infant can be done while the infant remains close to the mother, saying that even a brief separation before the baby has had its first feed can disturb the bonding process. They further advise frequent skin-to-skin contact as much as possible during the first days after delivery, especially if it were interrupted for some reason after the delivery.

La Leche League advises women to have a delivery team which includes a support person who will advocate to assure that:
:* The mother and her baby are not separated unnecessarily
:*The baby will receive only her milk
:*The baby will receive no supplementation without a medical reason
:* All testing, bathing or other procedures are done in the parent&#x27;s room

It has long been known that a mother&#x27;s level of the hormone oxytocin elevates when she interacts with her infant. The oxytocin level in fathers that engage in SSC is increased as well and SSC reduces stress and anxiety in parents after interaction.&quot;

===Discharge===

For births that occur in hospitals the WHO recommends a hospital stay of at least 24 hours following an uncomplicated vaginal delivery and 96 hours for a Cesarean section. Looking at length of stay (in 2016) for an uncomplicated delivery around the world shows an average of less than 1 day in Egypt to 6 days in (pre-war) Ukraine. Averages for Australia are 2.8 days and 1.5 days in the UK. While this number is low, two-thirds of women in the UK have midwife-assisted births and in some cases the mother may choose a hospital setting for birth to be closer to the wide range of assistance available for an emergency situation. However, women with midwife care may leave the hospital shortly after birth and her midwife will continue her care at her home.
In the U.S. the average length of stay has gradually dropped from 4.1 days in 1970 to a current stay of 2 days. The CDC attributed the drop to the rise in health care costs, saying people could not afford to stay in the hospital any longer. To keep it from dropping any lower, in 1996 Congress passed the Newborns&#x27; and Mothers&#x27; Health Protection Act that requires insurers to cover at least 48 hours for uncomplicated delivery.

==Management==
=== Natural childbirth ===

The reemergence of &quot;natural childbirth&quot; began in Europe and was adopted by some in the US as early as the late 1940s. Early supporters believed that the drugs used during deliveries interfered with &quot;happy childbirth&quot; and could negatively impact the newborn&#x27;s &quot;emotional wellbeing&quot;. By the 1970s, the call for natural childbirth was spread nationwide, in conjunction with the second-wave of the feminist movement. While it is still most common for American women to deliver in the hospital, supporters of natural birth still widely exist, especially in the UK where midwife-assisted home births have gained popularity.

===Coping===
Distress levels vary widely during pregnancy as well as during labour and delivery. They appear to be influenced by fear and anxiety levels, experience with prior childbirth, cultural ideas of childbirth pain, mobility during labour, and the support received during labour.

Personal expectations, the amount of support from caregivers, quality of the caregiver-patient relationship, and involvement in decision-making are more important in the mother&#x27;s overall satisfaction with the birthing experience than are other influencing factors such as age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, preparation, physical environment, pain, immobility, or medical interventions.

===Aid===
Obstetric care frequently subjects women to institutional routines, which may have adverse effects on the progress of labour. Supportive care during labour may involve emotional support, comfort measures, and information and advocacy which may promote the physical process of labour as well as women&#x27;s feelings of control and competence, thus reducing the need for obstetric intervention. The continuous support may be provided either by hospital staff such as nurses or midwives, doulas, or by companions of the woman&#x27;s choice from her social network.

Continuous labour support may help women to give birth spontaneously, that is, without caesarean or vacuum or forceps, with slightly shorter labours, and to have more positive feelings regarding their experience of giving birth. Continuous labour support may also reduce women&#x27;s use of pain medication during labour and reduce the risk of babies having low five-minute Apgar scores.

The participation of the child&#x27;s father in the birth contributes to a better birth experience for the mother, promotes paternal bonding and makes the transition to fatherhood easier.

===Preparation===
Eating or drinking during labour is an area of ongoing debate. While some have argued that eating in labour has no harmful effects on outcomes, others continue to have concern regarding the increased possibility of an aspiration event (choking on recently eaten foods) in the event of an emergency delivery due to the increased relaxation of the oesophagus in pregnancy, upward pressure of the uterus on the stomach, and the possibility of general anaesthetic in the event of an emergency cesarean. However with good obstetrical anaesthesia there is no additional harm from allowing eating and drinking during labour in those who are unlikely to need surgery. Additionally, not eating does not necessarily mean that the mother&#x27;s stomach is empty or that its contents are not as acidic.

At one time shaving of the area around the vagina, was common practice due to the belief that hair removal reduced the risk of infection, made an episiotomy (a surgical cut to enlarge the vaginal entrance) easier, and helped with instrumental deliveries. It is currently less common, though it is still a routine procedure in some countries even though there is no scientific evidence to recommend shaving. Side effects appear later, including irritation, redness, and multiple superficial scratches from the razor. Another effort to prevent infection has been the use of the antiseptic chlorhexidine or providone-iodine solution in the vagina. However it is unclear if chlorhexidine offers any benefits in preventing infections. Providone-iodine decreases the risk of infection when a cesarean section is to be performed.

===Labour induction===
Labor induction is the procedure where a medical professional starts the process of labor instead of letting it start on its own. Labor may be induced (started) if the health of the mother or the baby is at risk. Induction of labor can be accomplished with medication or mechanical methods.

Medical guidelines recommend a full evaluation of the maternal-fetal status, the status of the cervix, and at least a 39 completed weeks (full term) of gestation for optimal health of the newborn when considering elective induction of labour. Indications for induction may include:
* Problems with the placenta
* Health issues with the fetus
* Maternal conditions such as gestational diabetes or chronic kidney disease
* Preeclampsia, eclampsia or gestational hypertension
* Premature rupture of membranes
* Postterm pregnancy

Induction may also be considered for logistical reasons, such as the distance from hospital or psychosocial conditions. In these instances gestational age confirmation must be done, and the maturity of the fetal lung must be confirmed by testing. The contraindications for induced labour are the same as for spontaneous vaginal delivery, including vasa previa, complete placenta praevia, umbilical cord prolapse or active genital herpes infection, in which cases a cesarean section is the safest delivery method.

Women often do not receive clear and detailed information about the process of labor induction, its benefits and risks. For example women might not know how long the process will last, how long they need to stay in the hospital and how strong the pain caused by the procedure would be. Providing up-to-date information about the procedure allows women to make an informed choice and give an informed consent or refuse the induction.

===Forceps or vacuum assisted delivery===
An assisted delivery is used in about 1 in 8 births, and may be needed if either mother or infant appears to be at risk during a vaginal delivery. The methods used are termed obstetrical forceps extraction and vacuum extraction, also called ventouse extraction. Done properly, they are both safe with some preference for forceps rather than vacuum, and both are seen as preferable to an unexpected C-section. While considered safe, some risks for the mother include vaginal tearing, including a higher chance of having a more major vaginal tear that involves the muscle or wall of the anus or rectum. For women undergoing operative vaginal delivery with vacuum extraction or forceps, there is strong evidence that prophylactic antibiotics help to reduce the risk of infection. There is a higher risk of blood clots forming in the legs or pelvis – anti-clot stockings or medication may be ordered to avoid clots. Urinary incontinence is not unusual after childbirth but it is more common after an instrument delivery. Certain exercises and physiotherapy will help the condition to improve.

===Pain control===
====Non-pharmaceutical====
Some women prefer to avoid analgesic medication during childbirth. Psychological preparation may be beneficial. Relaxation techniques, immersion in water, massage, and acupuncture may provide pain relief. Acupuncture and relaxation were found to decrease the number of caesarean sections required. Immersion in water has been found to relieve pain during the first stage of labour, reduce the need for anaesthesia, and shorten the duration of labour. Additionally, water birth is associated with a decreased risk of postpartum hemorrhaging, low Apgar scores, neonatal infections, requirement for neonatal resuscitation, and neonatal admission to intensive care. However, there is a higher chance of cord avulsion.

Most women like to have someone to support them during labour and birth; such as a midwife, nurse, or doula; or a lay person such as the father of the baby, a family member, or a close friend. Studies have found that continuous support during labour and delivery reduce the need for medication and a caesarean or operative vaginal delivery, and result in an improved Apgar score for the infant.

====Pharmaceutical====
Different measures for pain control have varying degrees of success and side effects to the woman and her baby. In some countries of Europe, doctors commonly prescribe inhaled nitrous oxide gas for pain control, especially as 53% nitrous oxide, 47% oxygen, known as Entonox; in the UK, midwives may use this gas without a doctor&#x27;s prescription. Opioids such as fentanyl may be used, but if given too close to birth there is a risk of respiratory depression in the infant.

Popular medical pain control in hospitals include the regional anaesthetics epidurals (EDA), and spinal anaesthesia. Epidural analgesia is a generally safe and effective method of relieving pain in labour, but has been associated with longer labour, more operative intervention (particularly instrument delivery), and increases in cost. However, a more recent (2017) Cochrane review suggests that the new epidural techniques have no effect on labour time and the use of instruments or the need for C-section deliveries. Generally, pain and stress hormones rise throughout labour for women without epidurals, while pain, fear, and stress hormones decrease upon administration of epidural analgesia, but rise again later.
Medicine administered via epidural can cross the placenta and enter the bloodstream of the fetus. Epidural analgesia has no statistically significant impact on the risk of caesarean section, and does not appear to have an immediate effect on neonatal status as determined by Apgar scores.

===Augmentation===

Augmentation is the process of stimulating the uterus to increase the intensity and duration of contractions after labour has begun. Several methods of augmentation are commonly been used to treat slow progress of labour (dystocia) when uterine contractions are assessed to be too weak. Oxytocin is the most common method used to increase the rate of vaginal delivery. The World Health Organization recommends its use either alone or with amniotomy (rupture of the amniotic membrane) but advises that it must be used only after it has been correctly confirmed that labour is not proceeding properly if harm is to be avoided. The WHO does not recommend the use of antispasmodic agents for prevention of delay in labour.

===Episiotomy===
For years an episiotomy was thought to help prevent more extensive vaginal tears and heal better than a natural tear. Perineal tears can occur at the vaginal opening as the baby&#x27;s head passes through, especially if the baby descends quickly. Tears can involve the perineal skin or extend to the muscles and the anal sphincter and anus. Once common, they are now recognised as generally not needed. When needed, the midwife or obstetrician makes a surgical cut in the perineum to prevent severe tears that can be difficult to repair. Conducting episiotomy when necessary (restrictive episiotomy) appears to give a number of benefits compared to using routine episiotomy. Women experience less severe perineal trauma, less posterior perineal trauma, less suturing and fewer healing complications at seven days. Furthermore it does not cause a higher occurrence of pain, urinary incontinence, painful sex or severe vaginal/perineal trauma after birth.

===Multiple births===

In cases of a head first-presenting first twin, twins can often be delivered vaginally. In some cases twin delivery is done in a larger delivery room or in an operating theatre, in the event of complication e.g.
* Both twins born vaginally – this can occur both presented head first or where one comes head first and the other is breech and/or helped by a forceps/ventouse delivery
* One twin born vaginally and the other by caesarean section.
* If the twins are joined at any part of the body – called conjoined twins, delivery is mostly by caesarean section.

===Fetal monitoring===

For external monitoring of the fetus during childbirth, a simple pinard stethoscope or doppler fetal monitor (&quot;doptone&quot;) can be used.
A method of external (noninvasive) fetal monitoring (EFM) during childbirth is cardiotocography (CTG), using a &quot;cardiotocograph&quot; that consists of two sensors: The &quot;heart&quot; (cardio) sensor is an ultrasonic sensor, similar to a Doppler fetal monitor, that continuously emits ultrasound and detects motion of the fetal heart by the characteristic of the reflected sound. The pressure-sensitive &quot;contraction&quot; transducer, called a &quot;tocodynamometer&quot; (toco) has a flat area that is fixated to the skin by a band around the belly. The pressure required to flatten a section of the wall correlates with the internal pressure, thereby providing an estimate of contraction.
Monitoring with a cardiotocograph can either be intermittent or continuous. The World Health Organization (WHO) advises that for healthy women undergoing spontaneous labour continuous cardiotocography is not recommended for assessment of fetal well-being. The WHO states: &quot;In countries and settings where continuous CTG is used defensively to protect against litigation, all stakeholders should be made aware that this practice is not evidence-based and does not improve birth outcomes.&quot;

A mother&#x27;s water has to break before internal (invasive) monitoring can be used. More invasive monitoring can involve a fetal scalp electrode to give an additional measure of fetal heart activity, and/or intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC). It can also involve fetal scalp pH testing.

===Caesarean section===
Caesarean section is the removal of the neonate through a surgical incision in the abdomen, rather than through vaginal birth. During the procedure the patient is usually numbed with an epidural or a spinal block, but general anaesthesia can be used as well. A cut is made in the patient&#x27;s abdomen and then in the uterus to remove the baby. Before the 1970s, once a woman delivered one baby via C-section, it was recommended that all of her future babies be delivered by C-section, but that recommendation has changed. Unless there is some other indication, mothers can attempt a trial of labour and most are able to have a vaginal birth after C-section (VBAC). Induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks can be harmful to the neonate as well as harmful or without benefit to the mother. Therefore, many guidelines recommend against non-medically required induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks.

The WHO recommends a C-section rate of between 10 and 15% because C-sections rates higher than 10% are not associated with a decrease in morbidity and mortality. In 2018, a group of medical professionals called the rates of increase around the world &quot;alarming&quot;. In a &quot;Lancet&quot; report, C-sections were found to have more than tripled from about 6% of all births to 21%. In a statement by the maternal and child health organisation, the March of Dimes, the increase is largely due to an increase of elective C-sections rather than when it is really necessary or indicated.

==Complications==

===Labour and delivery complications===
====Obstructed labour====
Obstructed labour also called &quot;dysfunctional labour&quot; or &quot;labour dystocia&quot;, is difficult labour or abnormally slow progress of labour, involving progressive cervical dilatation or lack of descent of the fetus. The second stage of labour may be delayed or lengthy due to poor or uncoordinated uterine action, an abnormal uterine position such as breech or shoulder dystocia, and cephalopelvic disproportion (a small pelvis or large infant). Prolonged labour may result in maternal exhaustion, fetal distress, and other complications including obstetric fistula.

====Eclampsia====
Eclampsia is the onset of seizures (convulsions) in a woman with pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy in which there is high blood pressure and either large amounts of protein in the urine or other organ dysfunction. Pre-eclampsia is routinely screened for during prenatal care. Onset may be before, during, or rarely, after delivery. Around 1% of women with eclampsia die.

===Maternal complications===

A puerperal disorder or postpartum disorder is a complication which presents primarily during the puerperium, or postpartum period. The postpartum period can be divided into three distinct stages; the initial or acute phase, six to 12 hours after childbirth; subacute postpartum period, which lasts two to six weeks, and the delayed postpartum period, which can last up to six months. In the subacute postpartum period, 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem. Long-term health problems (persisting after the delayed postpartum period) are reported by 31% of women.

====Postpartum bleeding====

Bleeding (haemorrhage) is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide accounting for approximately 27.1% of maternal deaths. Within maternal deaths due to haemorrhage, two-thirds are caused by postpartum haemorrhage. The causes of postpartum haemorrhage can be separated into four main categories: tone, trauma, tissue, and thrombin. Tone represents uterine atony, the failure of the uterus to contract adequately following delivery. Trauma includes lacerations or uterine rupture. Tissue includes conditions that can lead to a retained placenta. Thrombin, which is a molecule used in the human body&#x27;s blood clotting system, represents all coagulopathies.

====Postpartum infections====

Postpartum infections, also historically known as childbed fever and medically as puerperal fever, are any bacterial infections of the reproductive tract following childbirth or miscarriage. Signs and symptoms usually include a fever greater than 38.0 °C (100.4 °F), chills, lower abdominal pain, and possibly bad-smelling vaginal discharge. The infection usually occurs after the first 24 hours and within the first ten days following delivery. Infection remains a major cause of maternal deaths and morbidity in the developing world.

====Psychological complications====
Childbirth can be an intense event and strong emotions, both positive and negative, can be brought to the surface. Abnormal and persistent fear of childbirth is known as tokophobia. The prevalence of fear of childbirth around the world ranges between 4–25%, with 3–7% of pregnant women having clinical fear of childbirth.
Although pain may be seen as a self-evident and indisputable fact, in reality pain is only one sensation of childbirth. There are many other sensations such as bliss, joy and satisfaction which can be more powerful than pain. Negative expectations can actually increase sensitivity to pain through the process of nocebo hyperalgesia. At the same time positive expectations can reduce pain through placebo analgesia.

Most new mothers may experience mild feelings of unhappiness and worry after giving birth. Babies require a lot of care, so it is normal for mothers to be worried about, or tired from, providing that care. The feelings, often termed the &quot;baby blues&quot;, affect up to 80% of mothers. They are somewhat mild, last a week or two, and usually go away on their own.

Postpartum depression is different from the &quot;baby blues&quot;. With postpartum depression, feelings of sadness and anxiety can be extreme and might interfere with a woman&#x27;s ability to care for herself or her family. Because of the severity of the symptoms, postpartum depression usually requires treatment. The condition, which occurs in nearly 15% of births, may begin shortly before or any time after childbirth, but commonly begins between a week and a month after delivery.

Childbirth-related post-traumatic stress disorder is a psychological disorder that can develop in women who have recently given birth. Causes include issues such as an emergency C-section, preterm labour, inadequate care during labour,
lack of social support following childbirth, and others. Examples of symptoms include intrusive symptoms, flashbacks and nightmares, as well as symptoms of avoidance (including amnesia for the whole or parts of the event), problems in developing a mother-child attachment, and others similar to those commonly experienced in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Many women who are experiencing symptoms of PTSD after childbirth are misdiagnosed with postpartum depression or adjustment disorders. These diagnoses can lead to inadequate treatment.

Postpartum psychosis is a rare psychiatric emergency in which symptoms of high mood and racing thoughts (mania), depression, severe confusion, loss of inhibition, paranoia, hallucinations and delusions set in, beginning suddenly in the first two weeks after childbirth. The symptoms vary and can change quickly. It usually requires hospitalisation. The most severe symptoms last from two to 12 weeks, and recovery takes six months to a year.

===Fetal complications===

Five causes make up about 80% of newborn deaths globally: prematurity, low-birth-weight, infections, lack of oxygen at birth, and trauma during birth.

====Stillbirth====

Stillbirth is typically defined as fetal death at or after 20 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. It results in a baby born without signs of life.

Worldwide prevention of most stillbirths is possible with improved health systems. About half of stillbirths occur during childbirth, and stillbirth is more common in the developing than developed world. Otherwise depending on how far along the pregnancy is, medications may be used to start labour or a type of surgery known as dilation and evacuation may be carried out. Following a stillbirth, women are at higher risk of another one; however, most subsequent pregnancies do not have similar problems.

Worldwide in 2019 there were about 2 million stillbirths that occurred after 28 weeks of pregnancy, this equates to 1 in 72 total births or one every 16 seconds. Still births are more common in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Stillbirth rates have declined, though more slowly since the 2000s.

====Preterm birth====

Preterm birth is the birth of an infant at fewer than 37 weeks gestational age. Globally, about 15 million infants were born before 37 weeks of gestation. Premature birth is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age though many that survive experience disabilities including learning defects and visual and hearing problems. Causes for early birth may be unknown or may be related to certain chronic conditions such as diabetes, infections, and other known causes. The World Health Organization has developed guidelines with recommendations to improve the chances of survival and health outcomes for preterm infants.

If a pregnant woman enters preterm labour, delivery can be delayed by giving medications called tocolytics. Tocolytics delay labour by inhibiting contractions of the uterine muscles that progress labour. The most widely used tocolytics include beta agonists, calcium channel blockers, and magnesium sulfate. The goal of administering tocolytics is not to delay delivery to the point that the child can be delivered at term, but instead to postponing delivery long enough for the administration of glucocorticoids which can help the fetal lungs to mature enough to reduce morbidity and mortality from infant respiratory distress syndrome.

==== Post-term birth ====

The term postterm pregnancy is used to describe a condition in which a woman has not yet delivered her baby after 42 weeks of gestation, two weeks beyond the usual 40-week duration of pregnancy. Postmature births carry risks for both the mother and the baby, including meconium aspiration syndrome, fetal malnutrition, and stillbirths. The placenta, which supplies the baby with oxygen and nutrients, begins to age and will eventually fail after the 42nd week of gestation. Induced labour is indicated for postterm pregnancy.

====Neonatal infection====

Newborns are prone to infection in the first month of life. The pathogenic bacterium &quot;Streptococcus agalactiae&quot; (a group B streptococcus) is most often the cause of these occasionally fatal infections. The baby contracts the infection from the mother during labour. In 2014 it was estimated that about one in 2000 newborn babies had a group B streptococcuss infection within the first week of life, usually evident as respiratory disease, general sepsis, or meningitis.

Untreated sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are associated with birth defects, and infections in newborn babies, particularly in the areas where rates of infection remain high. The majority of STIs have no symptoms or only mild symptoms that may not be recognised. Mortality rates resulting from some infections may be high, for example the overall perinatal mortality rate associated with untreated syphilis is 30%.

====Perinatal asphyxia====
Perinatal asphyxia is the medical condition resulting from deprivation of oxygen to a newborn infant that lasts long enough during the birth process to cause physical harm. Hypoxic damage can also occur to most of the infant&#x27;s organs (heart, lungs, liver, gut, kidneys), but brain damage is of most concern and perhaps the least likely to quickly or completely heal. Oxygen deprivation can lead to permanent disabilities in the child, such as cerebral palsy.

====Mechanical fetal injury====

Risk factors for fetal birth injury include fetal macrosomia (big baby), maternal obesity, the need for instrumental delivery, and an inexperienced attendant. Specific situations that can contribute to birth injury include breech presentation and shoulder dystocia. Most fetal birth injuries resolve without long term harm, but brachial plexus injury may lead to Erb&#x27;s palsy or Klumpke&#x27;s paralysis.

==Accommodation==
=== Location ===

Childbirth routinely occurs in hospitals in many developed countries. Before the 20th century and in some countries to the present day, such as the Netherlands, it has more typically occurred at home.

In rural and remote communities of many countries, hospitalised childbirth may not be readily available or the best option. Maternal evacuation is the predominant risk management method for assisting mothers in these communities. Maternal evacuation is the process of relocating pregnant women in remote communities to deliver their babies in a nearby urban hospital setting. This practice is common in Indigenous Inuit and Northern Manitoban communities in Canada as well as Australian aboriginal communities. Maternal evacuation, due to a lack of social support provided to these women, can have negative effects on mothers. These negative effects include an increase in maternal newborn complications and postpartum depression, and decreased breastfeeding rates.

The exact location in which childbirth takes place is an important factor in determining nationality, in particular for birth aboard aircraft and ships.

=== Hospitals ===
====Baby Friendly Hospitals====

In 1991 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a global programme, the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI), that urges birthing centres and hospitals to institute procedures that encourage mother/baby bonding and breastfeeding. The Johns Hopkins Hospital describes the process of receiving the Baby Friendly designation:
Every major health organisation, such as the CDC, supports the BFHI. As of 2019, 28% of hospitals in the US have been accredited by the WHO.

===Facilities===
Facilities for childbirth include:
* A &quot;maternity ward&quot;, also called &quot;maternity unit&quot;, &quot;labour ward&quot; or &quot;delivery ward&quot;, is generally a hospital department that provides health care to women and their children during childbirth. It is generally closely linked to the hospital&#x27;s neonatal intensive care unit and/or obstetric surgery unit if present. It usually includes facilities both for childbirth and for postpartum rest and observation of mothers in normal as well as complicated cases.
* A maternity hospital is a hospital that specialises in caring for women while they are pregnant and during childbirth and provide care for newborn babies,
* A birthing centre is a midwife-led unit that generally presents a more home-like environment. Birthing centres may be located on hospital grounds or &quot;free standing&quot; (that is, not affiliated with a hospital).
* A home birth is usually accomplished with the assistance of a midwife. Some women choose to give birth at home without any professionals present, termed an unassisted childbirth.

===Associated occupations===
Medical doctors who practise in the field of childbirth include categorically specialised obstetricians, family practitioners and general practitioners whose training, skills and practices include obstetrics, and in some contexts general surgeons. These physicians and surgeons variously provide care across the whole spectrum of normal and abnormal births and pathological labour conditions. Categorically specialised obstetricians are qualified surgeons, so they can undertake surgical procedures relating to childbirth. Some family practitioners or general practitioners also perform obstetrical surgery. Obstetrical procedures include cesarean sections, episiotomies, and assisted delivery. Categorical specialists in obstetrics are commonly trained in both obstetrics and gynaecology (OB/GYN), and may provide other medical and surgical gynaecological care, and may incorporate more general, well-woman, primary care elements in their practices. Maternal–fetal medicine specialists are obstetrician/gynecologists subspecialised in managing and treating high-risk pregnancy and delivery.

Anaesthetists or anaesthetists are medical doctors who specialise in pain relief and the use of drugs to facilitate surgery and other painful procedures. They may contribute to the care of a woman in labour by performing an epidural or by providing anaesthesia (often spinal anaesthesia) for Cesarean section or forceps delivery. They are experts in pain management during childbirth.

Obstetric nurses assist midwives, doctors, women, and babies before, during, and after the birth process, in the hospital system. They hold various nursing certifications and typically undergo additional obstetric training in addition to standard nursing training.

Paramedics are healthcare providers that are able to provide emergency care to both the mother and infant during and after delivery using a wide range of medications and tools on an ambulance. They are capable of delivering babies but can do very little for infants that become &quot;stuck&quot; and are unable to be delivered vaginally.

Lactation consultants assist the mother and newborn to breastfeed successfully. A health visitor comes to see the mother and baby at home, usually within 24 hours of discharge, and checks the infant&#x27;s adaptation to extrauterine life and the mother&#x27;s postpartum physiological changes.

==== Birth attendants ====
Different categories of birth attendants may provide support and care during pregnancy and childbirth, although there are important differences across categories based on professional training and skills, practice regulations, and the nature of care delivered. Many of these occupations are highly professionalised, but other roles exist on a less formal basis.

Midwives are autonomous practitioners who provide basic and emergency health care before, during and after pregnancy and childbirth, generally to women with low-risk pregnancies. Midwives are trained to assist during labour and birth, either through direct-entry or nurse-midwifery education programmes. Jurisdictions where midwifery is a regulated profession will typically have a registering and disciplinary body for quality control, such as the American Midwifery Certification Board in the United States, the College of Midwives of British Columbia in Canada or the Nursing and Midwifery Council in the United Kingdom.

In the past, midwifery played a crucial role in childbirth throughout most indigenous societies. Although western civilisations attempted to assimilate their birthing technologies into certain indigenous societies, like Turtle Island, and get rid of the midwifery, the National Aboriginal Council of Midwives brought back the cultural ideas and midwifery that were once associated with indigenous birthing.

In jurisdictions where midwifery is not a regulated profession, traditional birth attendants, also known as traditional or lay midwives, may assist women during childbirth, although they do not typically receive formal health care education and training.

Childbirth educators are instructors who aim to teach pregnant women and their partners about the nature of pregnancy, labour signs and stages, techniques for giving birth, breastfeeding and newborn baby care. Training for this role can be found in hospital settings or through independent certifying organisations. Each organisation teaches its own curriculum and each emphasises different techniques. The Lamaze technique is one well-known example.

Doulas are assistants who support mothers during pregnancy, labour, birth, and postpartum. They are not medical attendants; rather, they provide emotional support and non-medical pain relief for women during labour. Like childbirth educators and other unlicensed assistive personnel, certification to become a doula is not compulsory, thus, anyone can call themself a doula or a childbirth educator.

Confinement nannies are individuals who are employed to provide assistance and stay with the mothers at their home after childbirth. They are usually experienced mothers who took courses on how to take care of mothers and newborn babies.

=== Role of males ===
Both preterm and full term infants benefit from skin to skin contact, sometimes called kangaroo care, immediately following birth and for the first few weeks of life. Some fathers have begun to hold their newborns skin to skin; the new baby is familiar with the father&#x27;s voice and it is believed that contact with the father helps the infant to stabilise and promotes father to infant bonding. Looking at recent studies, a 2019 review found that the level of oxytocin was found to increase not only in mothers who had experienced early skin to skin attachment with their infants but in the fathers as well, suggesting a neurobiological connection. If the infant&#x27;s mother had a caesarean birth, the father can hold their baby in skin-to-skin contact while the mother recovers from the anaesthetic.

==Economics==

===Costs===
The cost of childbirth varies dramatically by country.
According to a 2013 analysis, in the United States the average amount actually paid by insurance companies or other payers in 2012 averaged $9,775 for an uncomplicated conventional delivery and $15,041 for a caesarean birth. A 2013 study found varying costs by facility for childbirth expenses in California, varying from $3,296 to $37,227 for a vaginal birth and from $8,312 to $70,908 for a caesarean birth.

Reporting on costs in 2023, &quot;Forbes&quot; gave an average cost of $18,865 ($14,768 for vaginal and
$26,280 for cesarean) which included pregnancy, delivery and postpartum care. However, many factors determined the costs, including where the woman lived, the type of birth, and whether or not they had insurance. Even with insurance, average out of the pocket expenses for a vaginal delivery were $2,655 and $3,214 for a cesarean birth. Variables which determined charges included length of hospital stay, which averaged 48 hours for vaginal birth and 96 hours for a cesarean. There could be charges for any complications before or after the birth, for example an induced labour costs more than a spontaneous birth. Babies that had a difficult birth may need special tests and monitoring, adding to the costs of childbirth.

Beginning in 2014, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence began recommending that women with low-risk pregnancies give birth at home under the care of a midwife rather than an obstetrician, citing lower expenses and better healthcare outcomes. The median cost associated with home birth was estimated to be about $1,500 vs. about $2,500 in hospital.

==Mortality==
===Maternal mortality===

Causes for maternal mortality range from severe bleeding to obstructed labour, for which there are highly effective interventions.

In 2008 at least seven million mothers experienced serious health problems while 50 million more had adverse health consequences after childbirth.

The United Nations Population Fund estimated that 303,000 women died of pregnancy or childbirth related causes in 2015. 

Additionally postpartum infections, most often transmitted by the dirty hands and tools of doctors, used to be one of the main causes of maternal mortality until germ theory was accepted in the mid-1800s and adopted thereafter. Before that it was assumed that puerperal fever was caused by a variety of sources, including the leakage of breast milk into the body and anxiety. Still, home births facilitated by trained midwives produced the best outcomes from 1880 to 1930 in the US and Europe, whereas physician-facilitated hospital births produced the worst. When antibiotics were discovered in the 1930s, rates of puerperal fever started to decrease significantly. 

The change in trend of maternal mortality can be attributed with the widespread use of antibiotics along with the progression of medical technology, more extensive physician training, and less medical interference with normal deliveries.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged midwife training to strengthen maternal and newborn health services. To support the upgrading of midwifery skills the WHO established a midwife training programme, Action for Safe Motherhood.

There was a 44% decline in the maternal death rate between 1990 and 2015. However, 830 women died every day in 2015 from causes related to pregnancy or childbirth and for every woman who dies, 20 or 30 encounter injuries, infections or disabilities. Most of these deaths and injuries are preventable. In the decades since 1990 the global maternal mortality ratio has fallen from 385 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 216 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2015, and it was reported in 2017 that many countries had halved their maternal death rates in the last 10 years, as women have gained access to family planning and skilled birth attendants with backup emergency obstetric care.

====United States====

Since the US began recording childbirth statistics in 1915, the US has had historically poor maternal mortality rates in comparison to other developed countries.

The rising maternal death rate in the US is of concern. In 1990 the US ranked 12th of the 14 developed countries that were analysed. However, since that time the rates of every country have steadily continued to improve while the US rate has spiked dramatically. While every other developed nation of the 14 analysed in 1990 shows a 2017 death rate of less than 10 deaths per every 100,000 live births, the US rate has risen to 26.4. By comparison, the United Kingdom ranks second highest at 9.2 and Finland is the safest at 3.8.

In 2022, the WHO reported that the US had the highest maternal death rate of any developed nation while other nations continued to experience declines. The death rate of black women has also continued to climb with a 2020 CDC report showing the maternal death rate at 55.3 deaths per 100,000 live births – 2.9 times the rate for white women. In 2023, a study reported that deaths among Native American women were even higher, at 3.5 times the rate for White women. The report attributed the high rate in part to the fact that Native American women are cared for under a poorly funded Federal Health Care System that is so stretched that the average monthly visit lasts only from three to seven minutes. Such a short visit allows neither time for performing an adequate health assessment nor time for the patient to discuss any problems she may be experiencing.

===Infant mortality===
Looking at 168 countries around the world, a 2015 Save the Children&#x27;s report found that each day about 8,000 newborns die during the first month of life. Worldwide, more than 1 million babies die during their first day even though simple measures such as antibiotics, hand-held breathing masks and other simple interventions could prevent the deaths of 70% of infants.

==== United States ====
The United States had the highest first-day infant death rate of all the industrialised nations in the world. In the US, each year about 11,300 newborns die within 24 hours of their birth, 50% more first-day deaths than all other industrialised countries combined.

Compared to other developed nations, the United States also has high infant mortality rates. The Trust for America&#x27;s Health reports that as of 2011, about one-third of American births have some complications; many are directly related to the mother&#x27;s health including increasing rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and physical inactivity. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has led an initiative to improve woman&#x27;s health previous to conception in an effort to improve both neonatal and maternal death rates.

==Culture==
Some communities rely heavily on religion for their birthing practices. It is believed that if certain acts are carried out, then it will allow the child for a healthier and happier future. One example of this is the belief in the Chillihuani that if a knife or scissors are used for cutting the umbilical cord, it will cause for the child to go through clothes very quickly. To prevent this, a jagged ceramic tile is used to cut the umbilical cord.

Comfort and proximity to extended family and social support systems may be a childbirth priority of many communities in developing countries, such as the Chillihuani in Peru and the Mayan town of San Pedro La Laguna. Home births can help women in these cultures feel more comfortable as they are in their own home with their family around them helping out in different ways. Traditionally, it has been rare in these cultures for the mother to lie down during childbirth, opting instead for standing, kneeling, or walking around prior to and during birthing.

In contemporary Mayan societies, ceremonial gifts are presented to the mother throughout pregnancy and childbirth to help her into the beginning of her child&#x27;s life. Maya women who work in agricultural fields of some rural communities will usually continue to work in a similar function to how they normally would throughout pregnancy, in some cases working until labour begins.

=== Placentophagy ===
In some cultures the placenta may be consumed as a nutritional boost, but it may also be seen as a special part of birth and eaten by the newborn&#x27;s family ceremonially. In the developed world the placenta may be eaten believing that it reduces postpartum bleeding, increases milk supply, provides micronutrients such as iron, and improves mood and boosts energy. The CDC advises against this practice, saying it has not been shown to promote health but has been shown to possibly transmit disease organisms that were passed from the placenta into the mother&#x27;s breastmilk and then infecting the baby.

===Variation===
Cultural values, assumptions, and practices of pregnancy and childbirth vary across cultures and time.

==Research directions==
It is currently possible to collect two types of stem cells during childbirth: amniotic stem cells and umbilical cord blood stem cells. They are being studied as possible treatments of a number of conditions.

== History ==

=== Giving birth in hospitals ===

Historically, most women gave birth at home without emergency medical care available. In the early days of hospitalisation for childbirth, a 17th-century maternity ward in Paris was incredibly congested, with up to five pregnant women sharing one bed. At this hospital, one in five women died during the birthing process. At the onset of the Industrial Revolution, giving birth at home became more difficult due to congested living spaces and dirty living conditions. That drove urban and lower-class women to newly available hospitals, while wealthy and middle-class women continued to labour at home. Consequently, wealthier women experienced lower maternal mortality rates than those of a lower social class. Throughout the 1900s, there was an increasing availability of hospitals, and more women began going into the hospital for labour and delivery. In the United States, 5% of women gave birth in hospitals in 1900. By 1930, 50% of all women and 75% of urban-dwelling women delivered in hospitals. By 1960, this number increased to 96%. By the 1970s, home birth rates fell to approximately 1%. In the United States, the middle classes were especially receptive to the medicalisation of childbirth, which promised a safer and less painful labour.

Accompanied by the shift from home to hospital was the shift from midwife to physician. Male physicians began to replace female midwives in Europe and the United States in the 1700s. The rise in status and popularity of this new position was accompanied by a drop in status for midwives. By the 1800s, affluent families were primarily calling male doctors to assist with their deliveries, and female midwives were seen as a resource for women who could not afford better care. That completely removed women from assisting in labour, as only men were eligible to become doctors at the time. Additionally, it privatised the birthing process as family members and friends were often banned from the delivery room.

There was opposition to the change from both progressive feminists and religious conservatives. The feminists were concerned about job security for a role that had traditionally been held by women. The conservatives argued that it was immoral for a woman to be exposed in such a way in front of a man. For that reason, many male obstetricians performed deliveries in dark rooms or with their patient fully covered with a drape.

=== Pain medication in labour ===
The use of pain medication in labour has been a controversial issue for hundreds of years. A Scottish woman was burned at the stake in 1591 for requesting pain relief in the delivery of twins. Medication became more acceptable in 1852, when Queen Victoria used chloroform as pain relief during labour. The use of morphine and scopolamine, also known as &quot;twilight sleep&quot;, was first used in Germany and popularised by German physicians Bernard Kronig and Karl Gauss. This concoction offered minor pain relief but mostly allowed women to completely forget the entire delivery process. Under twilight sleep, mothers were often blindfolded and restrained as they experienced the immense pain of childbirth. The cocktail came with severe side effects, such as decreased uterine contractions and altered mental state. Additionally, babies delivered with the use of childbirth drugs often experienced temporarily-ceased breathing. The feminist movement in the United States openly and actively supported the use of twilight sleep, which was introduced to the country in 1914. Some physicians, many of whom had been using painkillers for the past fifty years, including opium, cocaine, and quinine, embraced the new drug. Others were hesitant.

=== Cesarean section ===
The proportion of pregnancies delivered by C section between 1976 and 1996 in the U.S. increased from 6.7% in 1976 to 14.2% in 1996, with maternal choice the most frequent reason given. By 2018 the rate had climbed to one-third of all births.

=== Outdated methods ===
Friedman&#x27;s Curve, developed in 1955, was for many years used to determine obstructed labour. However, more recent medical research suggests that the Friedman curve may not be applicable any more.

=== Role of males ===
Historically, women have been attended and supported by other women during labour and birth. Midwife training in European cities began in the 1400s, but rural women were usually assisted by female family or friends. However, it was not simply a ladies&#x27; social bonding event as some historians have portrayed – fear and pain often filled the atmosphere, as death during childbirth was a common occurrence. In the United States before the 1950s, a father would not be in the birthing room. It did not matter if it was a home birth; the father would be waiting downstairs or in another room in the home. If it was in a hospital, then the father would wait in the waiting room. Fathers were only permitted in the room if the life of the mother or baby was severely at-risk. In 1522, a German physician was sentenced to death for sneaking into a delivery room dressed as a woman.

The majority of guidebooks related to pregnancy and childbirth were written by men who had never been involved in the birthing process. A Greek physician, Soranus of Ephesus, wrote a book about obstetrics and gynaecology in the second century, which was referenced for the next thousand years. The book contained endless home remedies for pregnancy and childbirth, many of which would be considered heinous by modern women and medical professionals.

=== Childbed fever ===
The work of Ignaz Semmelweis was seminal in the pathophysiology and treatment of childbed fever (postpartum infection) and his work saved many lives.

<doc id="83461" wikidata="Q744387" url="?curid=83461" title="Rocky Mountain spotted fever">
<text>Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a bacterial disease spread by ticks. It typically begins with a fever and headache, which is followed a few days later with the development of a rash. The rash is generally made up of small spots of bleeding and starts on the wrists and ankles. Other symptoms may include muscle pains and vomiting. Long-term complications following recovery may include hearing loss or loss of part of an arm or leg.
The disease is caused by &quot;Rickettsia rickettsii&quot;, a type of bacterium that is primarily spread to humans by American dog ticks, Rocky Mountain wood ticks, and brown dog ticks. Rarely the disease is spread by blood transfusions. Diagnosis in the early stages is difficult. A number of laboratory tests can confirm the diagnosis but treatment should be begun based on symptoms. It is within a group known as spotted fever rickettsiosis, together with &quot;Rickettsia parkeri&quot; rickettsiosis, Pacific Coast tick fever, and rickettsialpox.
Treatment of RMSF is with the antibiotic doxycycline. It works best when started early and is recommended in all age groups, as well as during pregnancy. Antibiotics are not recommended for prevention. Approximately 0.5% of people who are infected die as a result. Before the discovery of tetracycline in the 1940s, more than 10% of those with RMSF died.
Fewer than 5,000 cases are reported a year in the United States, most often in June and July. It has been diagnosed throughout the contiguous United States, Western Canada, and parts of Central and South America. Rocky Mountain spotted fever was first identified in the 1800s in the Rocky Mountains.

==Signs and symptoms==
Spotted fever can be very difficult to diagnose in its early stages, due to the similarity of symptoms with many different diseases. People infected with &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; usually notice symptoms following an incubation period of one to two weeks after a tick bite. The early clinical presentation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is nonspecific and may resemble a variety of other infectious and noninfectious diseases.

Initial symptoms:
* Fever
* Nausea
* Emesis (vomiting)
* Severe headache
* Muscle pain
* Malaise

Later signs and symptoms:
* Maculopapular rash
* Petechial rash
* Abdominal pain
* Joint pain
* Conjunctivitis
* Forgetfulness

The classic triad of findings for this disease are fever, rash, and history of tick bite. However, this combination is often not identified when patients initially present for care. The rash has a centripetal, or &quot;inward&quot; pattern of spread, meaning it begins at the extremities and courses towards the trunk.

===Rash===
The rash first appears two to five days after the onset of fever, and it is often quite subtle. Younger patients usually develop the rash earlier than older patients. Most often the rash begins as small, flat, pink, nonitchy spots (macules) on the wrists, forearms, and ankles. These spots turn pale when pressure is applied and eventually become raised on the skin. The characteristic red, spotted (petechial) rash of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is usually not seen until the sixth day or later after onset of symptoms, but this type of rash occurs in only 35 to 60% of patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The rash involves the palms or soles in as many as 80% of people. However, this distribution may not occur until later on in the course of the disease. As many as 15% of patients may never develop a rash.

===Complications===
People can develop permanent disabilities including &quot;cognitive deficits, ataxia, hemiparesis, blindness, deafness, or amputation following gangrene&quot;.

==Cause==

Ticks are the natural hosts of the disease, serving as both reservoirs and vectors of &quot;R. rickettsii&quot;. Ticks transmit the bacteria primarily by their bites. Less commonly, infections may occur following exposure to crushed tick tissues, fluids, or tick feces.

A female tick can transmit &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; to her eggs in a process called transovarial transmission. Ticks can also become infected with &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; while feeding on blood from the host in either the larval or nymphal stage. After the tick develops into the next stage, the &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; may be transmitted to the second host during the feeding process. Furthermore, male ticks may transfer &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; to female ticks through body fluids or spermatozoa during the mating process. These types of transmission represent how generations or life stages of infected ticks are maintained. Once infected, the tick can carry the pathogen for life.

Rickettsiae are transmitted through saliva injected while a tick is feeding. Unlike Lyme disease and other tick-borne pathogens that require a prolonged attachment period to establish infection, a person can become infected with &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; in a feeding time as short as 2 hours. In general, about 1-3% of the tick population carries &quot;R. rickettsii&quot;, even in areas where the majority of human cases are reported. Therefore, the risk of exposure to a tick carrying &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; is low.

The disease is spread by the American dog tick (&quot;Dermacentor variabilis&quot;), Rocky Mountain wood tick (&quot;D. andersoni&quot;), brown dog tick (&quot;Rhipicephalus sanguineus&quot;), and &quot;Amblyomma sculptum&quot;. Not all of these are of equal importance, and most are restricted to certain geographic areas.

The two major vectors of &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; in the United States are the American dog tick and the Rocky Mountain wood tick. American dog ticks are widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains and they also occur in limited areas along the Pacific Coast. Dogs and medium-sized mammals are the preferred hosts of an adult American dog tick, although it feeds readily on other large mammals, including human beings. This tick is the most commonly identified species responsible for transmitting &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; to humans. Rocky Mountain wood ticks (&quot;D. andersoni&quot;) are found in the Rocky Mountain states and in southwestern Canada. The lifecycle of this tick may require up to three years for its completion. The adult ticks feed primarily on large mammals. The larvae and nymphs feed on small rodents.

Other tick species have been shown to be naturally infected with &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; or serve as experimental vectors in the laboratory. These species are likely to play only a minor role in the ecology of &quot;R. rickettsii&quot;.

==Pathophysiology==

===Entry into host===
&quot;Rickettsia rickettsii&quot; can be transmitted to human hosts through the bite of an infected tick. As with other bacterium transmitted via ticks, the process generally requires a period of attachment of 4 to 6 hours. However, in some cases a &quot;Rickettsia rickettsii&quot; infection has been contracted by contact with tick tissues or fluids. Then, the bacteria induce their internalization into host cells via a receptor-mediated invasion mechanism.

Researchers believe that this mechanism is similar to that of &quot;Rickettsia conorii&quot;. This species of &quot;Rickettsia&quot; uses an abundant cell surface protein called OmpB to attach to a host cell membrane protein called Ku70. It has previously been reported that Ku70 migrates to the host cell surface in the presence of &quot;Rickettsia&quot;. Then, Ku70 is ubiquitinated by c-Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This triggers a cascade of signal transduction events resulting in the recruitment of Arp2/3 complex. CDC42, protein tyrosine kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and Src-family kinases then activate Arp2/3. This causes the alteration of local host cytoskeletal actin at the entry site as part of a zipper mechanism. Then, the bacteria is phagocytosized by the host cell and enveloped by a phagosome.

Studies have suggested that rOmpB is involved in this process of adhesion and invasion. Both rOmpA and rOmpB are members of a family of surface cell antigens (Sca) which are autotransporter proteins; they act as ligands for the Omp proteins and are found throughout the &quot;rickettsiae&quot;.

===Exit from host cell===
The cytosol of the host cell contains nutrients, adenosine triphosphate, amino acids, and nucleotides which are used by the bacteria for growth. For this reason, as well as to avoid phagolysosomal fusion and death, rickettsiae must escape from the phagosome. To escape from the phagosome, the bacteria secrete phospholipase D and hemolysin C. This causes disruption of the phagosomal membrane and allows the bacteria to escape. Following generation time in the cytoplasm of the host cells, the bacteria utilizes actin based motility to move through the cytosol.

RickA, expressed on the rickettsial surface, activates Arp2/3 and causes actin polymerization. The rickettsiae use the actin to propel themselves throughout the cytosol to the surface of the host cell. This causes the host cell membrane to protrude outward and invaginate the membrane of an adjacent cell. The bacteria are then taken up by the neighboring cell in a double membrane vacuole that the bacteria can subsequently lyse, enabling spread from cell to cell without exposure to the extracellular environment.

===Consequences of infection===
&quot;Rickettsia rickettsii&quot; initially infect blood vessel endothelial cells, but eventually migrate to vital organs such as the brain, skin, and the heart via the blood stream. Bacterial replication in host cells causes endothelial cell proliferation and inflammation, resulting in mononuclear cell infiltration into blood vessels and subsequent red blood cell leakage into surrounding tissues. The characteristic rash observed in Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the direct result of this localized replication of rickettsia in blood vessel endothelial cells.

==Diagnosis==
This disease can be diagnosed by a doctor with and without the use of lab testing. Lab tests are not always relied upon because treatment may be necessary before the results are returned.

Abnormal laboratory findings seen in patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever may include a low platelet count, low blood sodium concentration, or elevated liver enzyme levels. Serology testing and skin biopsy are considered to be the best methods of diagnosis. Although immunofluorescent antibody assays are considered some of the best serology tests available, most antibodies that fight against &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; are undetectable on serology tests during the first seven days after infection.

Differential diagnosis includes dengue, leptospirosis, chikungunya, and Zika fever.

==Treatment==
Appropriate antibiotic treatment should be started immediately when there is a suspicion of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Treatment should not be delayed for laboratory confirmation of disease as early initiation of treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is associated with lower mortality. Failure to respond to a tetracycline argues against a diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Severely ill people may require longer periods before their fever resolves, especially if they have experienced damage to multiple organ systems. Preventive therapy in healthy people who have had recent tick bites is not recommended and may only delay the onset of disease.

Doxycycline (a tetracycline) is the drug of choice for patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. According to the CDC, &quot;Doctors often avoid prescribing doxycycline to young children because of a warning that tooth staining may occur when used in children less than 8 years old. ..Misperceptions about the use of doxycycline for children prevent kids from getting lifesaving treatment&quot; of rickettsial diseases. &quot;Delay in treatment of rickettsial diseases may lead to severe illness or death. Children are five times more likely than adults to die from RMSF.&quot; A 2013 study shows that &quot;short courses of…doxycycline can be used in children without causing tooth staining or weakening of tooth enamel.&quot; The CDC observed that &quot;clearer language on the drug label may help avoid hesitation in prescribing life-saving doxycycline to children.&quot;

Treatment typically consists of 100 milligrams every 12 hours, or for children under at 4 mg/kg of body weight per day in two divided doses. Treatment should be continued for at least three days after the fever subsides, and until there is unequivocal evidence of clinical improvement. This will be generally for a minimum time of five to ten days. Severe or complicated outbreaks may require longer treatment courses. Chloramphenicol is an alternative drug that can be used to treat Rocky Mountain spotted fever, specifically in pregnancy. However, this drug may be associated with a wide range of side effects, and careful monitoring of blood levels is required.

==Prognosis==
Rocky Mountain spotted fever can be a very severe illness and patients often require hospitalization. Because &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; infects the cells lining blood vessels throughout the body, severe manifestations of this disease may involve the respiratory system, central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, or kidneys. Long-term health problems following acute Rocky Mountain spotted fever infection include partial paralysis of the lower extremities, gangrene requiring amputation of fingers, toes, or arms or legs, hearing loss, loss of bowel or bladder control, movement disorders, and language disorders. These complications are most frequent in persons recovering from severe, life-threatening disease, often following lengthy hospitalizations.

==Epidemiology==

There are between 500 and 2500 cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever reported in the United States per year, and in only about 20% can the tick be found.

Host factors associated with severe or fatal Rocky Mountain spotted fever include advanced age, male sex, African or Caribbean background, long-term excessive alcohol use and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Deficiency of G6PD is a genetic condition affecting about 12 percent of the Afro-American male population. Deficiency in this enzyme is associated with a high proportion of severe cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. This is a rare clinical complication that is often fatal within five days of the onset of the disease.

In the early 1940s, outbreaks were described in the Mexican states of Sinaloa, Sonora, Durango, and Coahuila driven by dogs and &quot;Rhipicephalus sanguineus&quot; sensu lato, the brown dog tick. Over the ensuing 100 years case fatality rates were 30%–80%. In 2015, there was an abrupt rise in Sonora cases with 80 fatal cases. From 2003 to 2016, cases increased to 1394 with 247 deaths.

==History==
Rocky Mountain spotted fever (or &quot;black measles&quot; because of its characteristic rash) was recognized in the early 1800s, and in the last 10 years of the 1800s (1890–1900) it became very common, especially in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana. The disease was originally noted to be concentrated on the west side of the Bitterroot river. Though it would be decades before scientists discovered the tick as the carrier of the disease, in as early as 1866, Dr. John B. Buker (establishing a practice in Missoula, MT) noticed a tick embedded in the skin of one of his patients. His notes were later studied as part of later research.

In 1901, Dr. A. F. Longeway was appointed to solve &quot;the black measles problem&quot; in Montana. He in turn enlisted his friend Dr. Earl Strain to help him. Strain suspected that the illness was from ticks. In 1906, Howard T. Ricketts, a pathologist recruited from the University of Chicago, was the first to establish the identity of the infectious organism (the organism smaller than a bacterium and larger than a virus) that causes this disease. He and others characterized the basic epidemiological features of the disease, including the role of tick vectors. Their studies found that Rocky Mountain spotted fever is caused by &quot;Rickettsia rickettsii&quot;, named in Ricketts&#x27;s honor. Ricketts died of typhus (another rickettsial disease) in Mexico in 1910, shortly after completing his studies on Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

Prior to 1922, Doctors McCray and McClintic both died while doing research on Rocky Mountain spotted fever, as did an aide of Noguchi Hideyo at the Rockefeller Institute.

Research began in 1922 in western Montana, in the Bitterroot Valley around Hamilton, Montana, after the Governor&#x27;s daughter and his son-in-law died of the fever. However, prior to that, in 1917, Dr. Lumford Fricks introduced herds of sheep into the Bitterroot Valley. His hypothesis was that the sheep would eat the tall grasses where ticks lived and bred. Past Assistant Surgeon R.R. Spencer of the Hygienic Laboratory of the U.S. Public Health Service was ordered to the region, and he led a research team at an abandoned schoolhouse through about 1924. Spencer was assisted by R. R. Parker, Bill Gettinger, Henry Cowan, Henry Greenup, Elmer Greenup, Gene Hughes, Salsbury, Kerlee, and others, of whom Gettinger, Cowan and Kerlee died of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Through a series of discoveries, the team found that a previous blood meal was necessary to make the tick deadly to its hosts, as well as other facets of the disease. On May 19, 1924, Spencer put a large dose of mashed wood ticks, from lot 2351B, and some weak carbolic acid into his arm by injection. This vaccine worked, and for some years after it was used by people in that region to convert the illness from one with high fatality rate (albeit low incidence) to one that could be either prevented entirely (for many of them) or modified to a non-deadly form (for the rest). Today there is no commercially available vaccine for RMSF because, unlike in the 1920s when Spencer and colleagues developed one, antibiotics are now available to treat the disease, so prevention by vaccination is no longer the sole defense against likely death.

Much of the early research was conducted at Rocky Mountain Laboratories, a part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The schoolhouse laboratory of 1922–1924, filled with ticks in various phases of the life cycle, is identified in retrospect as a biohazard, although the team did not fully appreciate it at first. The deaths of Gettinger and Cowan, and the near death of the janitor&#x27;s son, were the results of inadequate biocontainment, but in the 1920s, the elaborate biocontainment systems of today had not been invented.

==Popular culture==
In the 1936 film &quot;His Brother&#x27;s Wife&quot;, Robert Taylor plays a doctor who is part of a team frustrated by their inability to find RMSF in ticks collected from plants in the jungle, while infected people die all around them. When they finally test ticks from infected goats, they find their source and save a colleague&#x27;s life.

Research into this disease in Montana is a sub-plot of the 1937 film &quot;Green Light&quot;, starring Errol Flynn. Some of the researchers who perished are mentioned by name and their photographs are shown.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a big part of the 1947 Republic Pictures movie &quot;Driftwood&quot;, starring Walter Brennan, James Bell, Dean Jagger, Natalie Wood, and Hobart Cavanaugh.

In December 2013, hockey player Shane Doan was diagnosed with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and returned to play in January 2014.

==Other names==
Some synonyms for Rocky Mountain spotted fever in other countries include &quot;tick typhus&quot;, &quot;Tobia fever&quot; (Colombia), &quot;São Paulo fever&quot; or &quot;&quot;febre maculosa&quot; (Brazil), and &quot;fiebre manchada&quot;&quot; (Mexico).

<doc id="83463" wikidata="Q135637" url="?curid=83463" title="Chiptune">
<text>Chiptune, also called 8-bit music, is a style of electronic music made using the programmable sound generator (PSG) sound chips or synthesizers in vintage arcade machines, computers and video game consoles. The term is commonly used to refer to tracker format music using extremely basic and small samples that an old computer or console could produce (this is the original meaning of the term), as well as music that combines PSG sounds with modern musical styles. It has been described as &quot;an interpretation of many genres&quot;. Any existing song can be arranged in a chiptune style. It can be defined by choice of instrument, by timbre more than specific style elements.

== Technology ==
A waveform generator is a fundamental module in a sound synthesis system. A waveform generator usually produces a basic geometrical waveform with a fixed or variable timbre and variable pitch. Common waveform generator configurations usually included two or three simple waveforms and often a single pseudo-random-noise generator (PRNG). Available waveforms often included pulse wave (whose timbre can be varied by modifying the duty cycle), square wave (a symmetrical pulse wave producing only odd overtones), triangle wave (which has a fixed timbre containing only odd harmonics but is softer than a square wave), and sawtooth wave (which has a bright raspy timbre and contains odd and even harmonics). Two notable examples of systems employing this technology were the Game Boy portable game console and the Commodore 64 personal computer. The Game Boy uses two pulse channels (switchable between 12.5%, 25%, 50% and 75% wave duty cycle), a channel for a 4-bit waveform generator, and a pseudo-random-noise generator. The Commodore 64 however used the MOS Technology SID chip which offered 3 channels, each switchable between pulse, saw-tooth, triangle, and noise. Unlike the Game Boy, the pulse channels on the Commodore 64 allowed full control over wave duty cycles. The SID was a very technically advanced chip, offering many other features including ring modulation and adjustable resonance filters.

Due to the limited number of voices in early sound chips, one of the main challenges is to produce rich polyphonic music with them. The usual method to emulate it is via quick arpeggios, which is one of the most relevant features of chiptune music (along with its electronic timbres).

Some older systems featured a simple beeper as their only sound output, as the original ZX Spectrum and IBM PC; despite this, many skilled programmers were able to produce unexpectedly rich music with this bare hardware, where the sound is fully generated by the system&#x27;s CPU by direct control of the beeper.

== History ==

=== 1951–1979: Precursors ===

The earliest precursors to chip music can be found in the early history of computer music. In 1951, the computers CSIRAC and Ferranti Mark 1 were used to perform real-time synthesized digital music in public.

One of the earliest commercial computer music albums came from the First Philadelphia Computer Music Festival, held August 25, 1978, as part of the Personal Computing &#x27;78 show. The First Philadelphia Computer Music Festival recordings were published by Creative Computing in 1979. The Global TV program &quot;Science International&quot; (1976–1979) credited a PDP-11/10 for the music.

=== Mid-1970s–1980s: Video game origins ===
Chiptune music began to appear with the video game music produced during the golden age of video arcade games. An early example was the opening tune in Tomohiro Nishikado&#x27;s arcade game &quot;Gun Fight&quot; (1975). The first video game to use a continuous background soundtrack was Tomohiro Nishikado&#x27;s 1978 release &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, which had four simple chromatic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, though it was dynamic and interacted with the player, increasing pace as the enemies descended on the player.
The first video game to feature continuous melodic background music was &quot;Rally-X&quot;, an arcade game released by Namco in 1980, featuring a simple tune that repeats continuously during gameplay.
It was also one of the earliest games to use a digital-to-analog converter to produce sampled sounds.
That same year, the first video game to feature speech synthesis was also released, Sunsoft&#x27;s shoot &#x27;em up arcade game &quot;Stratovox&quot;.

In the late 1970s, the pioneering synth-pop/electronic dance music group Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO) were using computers to produce synthesized music.
Some of their early music, including their 1978 self-titled debut album, were sampling sounds from popular arcade games such as &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Gun Fight&quot;. In addition to incorporating sounds from contemporary video games into their music, the band would later have a major influence on much of the video game and chiptune music produced during the 8-bit and 16-bit eras. Sega&#x27;s 1982 arcade game &quot;Super Locomotive&quot; for example featured a chiptune cover version of YMO&#x27;s &quot;Rydeen&quot; (1979); several later computer games also covered the song, such as &quot;Trooper Truck&quot; (1983) by Rabbit Software as well as &quot;Daley Thompson&#x27;s Decathlon&quot; (1984) and &quot;Stryker&#x27;s Run&quot; (1986) arranged by Martin Galway.

By 1983, Konami&#x27;s arcade game &quot;Gyruss&quot; utilized five sound chips along with a digital-to-analog converter, which were partly used to create an electronic rendition of J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D minor&quot;.
In 1984, former YMO member Haruomi Hosono released an album produced entirely from Namco arcade game samples entitled &quot;Video Game Music&quot;, an early example of a chiptune record
and the first video game music album.
The record featured the work of Namco&#x27;s chiptune composers: Toshio Kai (&quot;Pac-Man&quot; in 1980), Nobuyuki Ohnogi (&quot;Galaga&quot;, &quot;New Rally-X&quot; and &quot;Bosconian&quot; in 1981, and &quot;Pole Position&quot; in 1982), and Yuriko Keino (&quot;Dig Dug&quot; and &quot;Xevious&quot; in 1982).

=== Early 1980s–1994: FM synthesis ===
A major advance for chip music was the introduction of frequency modulation synthesis (FM synthesis), first commercially released by Yamaha for their digital synthesizers and FM sound chips, which began appearing in arcade machines from the early 1980s.
Arcade game composers utilizing FM synthesis at the time included Konami&#x27;s Miki Higashino (&quot;Gradius&quot;, &quot;Yie-Ar Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;) and Sega&#x27;s Hiroshi Kawaguchi (&quot;Space Harrier&quot;, &quot;Hang-On&quot;, &quot;Out Run&quot;).

By the early 1980s, significant improvements to personal computer game music were made possible with the introduction of digital FM synthesis sound. Yamaha began manufacturing FM synth boards for Japanese computers such as the NEC PC-8801 and PC-9801 in the early 1980s, and by the mid-1980s, the PC-8801 and FM-7 had built-in FM sound. This allowed computer game music to have greater complexity than the simplistic beeps from internal speakers. These FM synth boards produced a &quot;warm and pleasant sound&quot; that musicians such as Yuzo Koshiro and Takeshi Abo utilized to produce music that is still highly regarded within the chiptune community.
In the early 1980s, Japanese personal computers such as the NEC PC-88 and PC-98 featured audio programming languages such as Music Macro Language (MML) and MIDI interfaces, which were most often used to produce video game music.

Fujitsu also released the &quot;FM Sound Editor&quot; software for the FM-7 in 1985, providing users with a user-friendly interface to create and edit synthesized music.

In 1987, FM synthesis became available for Western computers when Canadian company Ad Lib released the AdLib Music Synthesizer Card for the IBM Personal Computer, while Singapore-based Creative Labs incorporated the AdLib card&#x27;s sound chip into its Sound Blaster card in 1989. Both cards were widely supported by MS-DOS game developers in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The widespread adoption of FM synthesis by consoles would later be one of the major advances of the 16-bit era, by which time 16-bit arcade machines were using multiple FM synthesis chips. A major chiptune composer during this period was Yuzo Koshiro.
Despite later advances in audio technology, he would continue to use older PC-8801 hardware to produce chiptune soundtracks for series such as &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; (1991–1994) and &quot;Etrian Odyssey&quot; (2007–present). His soundtrack to &quot;The Revenge of Shinobi&quot; (1989) featured house
and progressive techno compositions that fused electronic dance music with traditional Japanese music.
The soundtrack for &quot;Streets of Rage 2&quot; (1992) is considered &quot;revolutionary&quot; and &quot;ahead of its time&quot; for its &quot;blend of swaggering house synths, dirty electro-funk and trancey electronic textures that would feel as comfortable in a nightclub as a video game.&quot;
For the soundtrack to &quot;Streets of Rage 3&quot; (1994), Koshiro created a new composition method called the &quot;Automated Composing System&quot; to produce &quot;fast-beat techno like jungle&quot;,
resulting in innovative and experimental sounds generated automatically.
Koshiro also composed chiptune soundtracks for series such as &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;, &quot;Ys&quot;, &quot;Shinobi&quot;, and &quot;ActRaiser&quot;. Another important FM synth composer was the late Ryu Umemoto, who composed chiptune soundtracks for various visual novel and shoot &#x27;em up games.

=== 1986–present: SID music culture ===
Later on, several demo groups moved to using their own music instead of ripped game music. In 1986, Jeroen &quot;Red&quot; Kimmel studied Rob Hubbard&#x27;s player routine and used it for original demo songs
before writing a routine of his own in 1987. Hobbyists were also writing their own dedicated music editor software, such as Chris Hülsbeck&#x27;s &quot;Soundmonitor&quot; which was released as a type-in listing in a 1986 issue of the German C-64 magazine &quot;64&#x27;er&quot;.

The practice of SID music composition has continued seamlessly until this day in conjunction with the Commodore 64 demoscene. The High Voltage SID Collection, a comprehensive archive of SID music, contains over 55,000 pieces of SID music.

== Mainstream popularity ==
The heyday of chiptune music was the 1980s. The earliest commercial chiptune records produced entirely from sampling arcade game sounds have existed since the mid-1980s, an early example being Haruomi Hosono&#x27;s &quot;Video Game Music&quot; in 1984. Though entirely chiptune records were uncommon at the time, many mainstream musicians in the pop rock, hip hop and electronic music
genres were sampling arcade game sounds and bleeps during the golden age of video arcade games (late 1970s to mid-1980s), as early as Yellow Magic Orchestra&#x27;s &quot;Computer Game&quot; in 1978. Buckner &amp; Garcia&#x27;s &quot;Pac-Man Fever&quot; and the album of the same name were major hits in 1982. Arcade game sounds were one of the foundational elements of the electro music genre, which in turn inspired many other electronic dance music genres such as techno and house music, which were sometimes referred to as &quot;bleep music&quot;. &quot;Space Invaders&quot; inspired Player One&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1979), which in turn provided the bassline for Jesse Saunders&#x27; &quot;On and On&quot; (1984),
the first Chicago house track. Warp&#x27;s record &quot;Testone&quot; (1990) by Sweet Exorcist sampled video game sounds from Yellow Magic Orchestra&#x27;s &quot;Computer Game&quot; and defined Sheffield&#x27;s bleep techno scene in the early 1990s.

After the 1980s, however, chiptune music began declining in popularity. Since then, up until the 2000s, chip music was rarely performed live and the songs were nearly exclusively spread as executable programs and other computer file formats. Some of the earliest examples of record label releases of pure chip music can be found in the late 1990s.
Chiptune music began gaining popularity again towards the end of the 1990s. The first electroclash record, I-F&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass&quot; (1997), has been described as &quot;burbling electro in a vocodered homage to Atari-era hi-jinks&quot;.

By the mid-2000s, 8-bit chip music began making a comeback in mainstream pop music, when it was used by acts such as Beck (for example, the 2005 song &quot;Girl&quot;), The Killers (for example, the 2004 song &quot;On Top&quot;), No Doubt with the song &quot;Running&quot;, and particularly The Postal Service in many of their songs. The low-quality digital PCM styling of early game music composers such as Hiroshi Kawaguchi also began gaining popularity.
In 2003, the J-pop girl group Perfume,
along with producer Yasutaka Nakata, began producing music combining chiptunes with synth-pop and electro house; their breakthrough came in 2007 with &quot;Game&quot;, which led to other Japanese female artists using a similar electronic style, including Aira Mitsuki, immi, Mizca, SAWA, Saori@destiny, and Sweet Vacation.
Electro house producer Deadmau5 started his career in the late 1990s, with a chiptune and demoscene movements-influenced sound. Three self-released compilations, Project 56, deadmau5 Circa 1998–2002 and A Little Oblique, were finished in 2006.

In 2007, the entirely chiptune album &quot;8-Bit Operators: The Music of Kraftwerk&quot; was released on major mainstream label Astralwerks/EMI Records, which included several prominent and noted chipmusicians, including Nanoloop
creator Oliver Wittchow, and LittleSoundDJ
creator Johan Kotlinski who appears as the artist &quot;Role Model&quot;. Kraftwerk founding member Ralf Hütter personally selected the tracks.
A vinyl 12-inch single version was released on February 24, 2007 as a precursor to the full-length CD, and reached as high as number 17
on the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine Hot Dance Singles Sales Chart. In March 2007, the CD release reached as high as number 1 on the &quot;CMJ RPM&quot; (North American college Electronic) charts.
Edinburgh-born electronic musician Unicorn Kid has helped further popularize chiptune, especially with the song &quot;True Love Fantasy&quot; and other songs from the EP &quot;Tidal Rave&quot; being played on late night radio, including on BBC Radio 1, where he played live on the Festive Festival 2011. In Canada, Eightcubed and Crystal Castles helped the popularity further via the Toronto underground club scene and created a lasting impression with the music video &quot;Heart Invaders&quot; debuting on MuchMusic in 2008
and the single &quot;Alice Practice&quot; hitting 29th on NME &quot;150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years&quot;.

During the late 2000s, a new wave of chiptune culture took place, boosted by the release of software such as LittleSoundDJ for the Game Boy. This new culture has much more emphasis on live performances and record releases than the demoscene and tracker culture, of which the new artists are often only distantly aware.
In recent years, 8-bit chiptune sounds, or &quot;video game beats&quot;, have been used by a number of mainstream pop artists. Examples include artists such as Kesha
(most notably in &quot;Tik Tok&quot;, the best-selling single of 2010),
50 Cent with the hit single &quot;Ayo Technology&quot;, Robyn, Snoop Dogg,
Eminem (for example, &quot;Hellbound&quot;), Nelly Furtado, and Timbaland . The influence of video game sounds can also be heard in contemporary British electronica music by artists such as Dizzee Rascal and Kieran Hebden,
as well as in heavy metal bands such as DragonForce. Grime music in particular samples sawtooth wave sounds from video games which were popular in East London.
Some dubstep producers have also been influenced by video game chiptunes, particularly the work of Yuzo Koshiro.
In 2010, a BBC article stated that the &quot;sights and sounds of old-school games&quot; (naming &quot;Frogger&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; as examples) are &quot;now becoming a part of mainstream music and culture.&quot;
Complextro pioneer Porter Robinson has also cited video game sounds, or chiptunes, as an influence on his style of music along with 1980s analog synth music.

== Tracker chiptunes ==
The Commodore Amiga (1985) with its sample-based sound generation distanced the concept of microcomputer music away from plain chip-synthesized sounds. Amiga tracker music software, beginning from Karsten Obarski&#x27;s Ultimate Soundtracker (1987), inspired great numbers of computer enthusiasts to create computer music. As an offshoot of the burgeoning tracker music culture, a type of tracker music reminiscent of Commodore 64 SID music was born, that utilized simple waveforms instead of digitized samples. This type of music came to be called &quot;chiptunes&quot;, referring to the sound of early video game console and home computer sound chips.

Earliest examples of tracker chiptunes date back to 1989 and are attributed to the demoscene musicians 4mat, Baroque, TDK, Turtle and Duz. Tracker chiptunes are based on very short looped waveforms which are modulated by tracker effects such as arpeggio, vibrato, and portamento. A very common loop length is 128 samples, which at an approximate sample rate of 17 kHz misses a C note by a few cents.

There is at least one commercial game for the Amiga, Nebulus II, that used chiptune style music, although with some conventional sampled instrument sounds as well as speech. The game apparently was initially planned for release for the C64 but was canceled.

The small amount of sample data made tracker chiptunes far more space-efficient than most other types of tracker music, which made them appealing to size-limited demoscene demos and crack intros. Tracker chiptunes have also been commonly used in other warez scene executables such as keygens.

Nowadays the term &quot;chiptune&quot; is also used to cover chip music using actual chip-based synthesis, but some sources such as the Amiga Music Preservation project still define a chiptune specifically as a small tracker module. Modern trackers used today include OpenMPT, Famitracker, Furnace and Goattracker.

== Contemporary chiptune music ==


The chip scene has become relevant thanks to &quot;compos&quot; being held, groups releasing music disks and with the cracktro/demo scene. New tracker tools are used for making chip sounds available to less tech-savvy musicians. The NES platform has the MidiNES, a cartridge that turns the system into a full blown hardware MIDI controlled synthesizer. Around 2007, the Mssiah was released for the Commodore 64, which is very similar to the MidiNES, but with greater parameter controls, sequencing, analog drum emulation, and limited sample playback. The Commodore PET has the open-source PetSynth software, which uses the PET&#x27;s 6522 chip for sound, allows the computer to be played like a piano keyboard, and features many effects. On the DOS platform, Fast Tracker is one of the most famous chiptune makers because of the ability to create hand-drawn samples with the mouse. Chiptune artist Pixelh8 has also designed music software such as Music Tech
for the Game Boy and the Pro Performer
for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS which turn both machines into real time synthesizers.

There have been a number of television segments featuring chiptunes and chip music artists in the past few years. On April 11, 2005, 8 Bit Weapon played their songs &quot;Bombs Away&quot; and &quot;Gameboy Rocker&quot; on G4&#x27;s &quot;Attack of the Show&quot; live broadcast Episode #5058. In 2008, as a parody of &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;, the first four episodes of &quot;Boing Boing Video&quot;″s &quot;SPAMasterpiece Theater&quot; opened with a chiptune remix of Jean-Joseph Mouret&#x27;s &quot;Rondeau: Fanfare&quot; (1735) by Hamhocks Buttermilk Johnson.
Another chipmusic feature included little-scale, Dot.AY, Ten Thousand Free Men &amp; Their Families and Jim Cuomo on the Australian television series &quot;Good Game&quot; in 2009.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation in December 2010 used a faux 8-bit game with an 8-bit sound track by to demonstrate its notable legal achievements for that year.

In March 2012, the Smithsonian American Art Museum&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Video Games&quot; exhibit opened featuring a chipmusic soundtrack at the entrance by artists 8 Bit Weapon &amp; ComputeHer. 8 Bit Weapon also created a track called &quot;The art of Video Games Anthem&quot; for the exhibit. In September 2015, the first music compilation based on Domo (NHK), Domo Loves Chiptune, was released on iTunes, Amazon, and all major music streaming services.
The compilation features top artists in the Chiptune genre such as Anamanaguchi and Disasterpeace. Domo Loves Chiptune also features the first Chiptune remix of the Domo theme song by Mystery Mansion. The New York City chiptune scene was also the subject of a documentary called &quot;Reformat the Planet&quot; by 2 Player Productions. This film was an official selection at the 2008 South by Southwest.

Chip music has returned to 21st-century gaming, either in full-chip music style or using chip samples in the music. Popular games that feature chiptune elements in their soundtracks include &quot;Shovel Knight&quot; and &quot;Undertale&quot;.

== Events ==
Events take place all around the world that focus around the celebration and recognition of chiptune music.

=== Blip Festival ===
=== MAGFest&#x27;s Chipspace ===
In the United States, during Super MAGFest—a yearly convention that hosts a variety of video game-related events—popular chiptune artists such as goto80 and Chipzel have previously performed on the Concert Hall mainstage. A chiptune-focused mainstage show (aptly named &quot;Chip Rave&quot;) typically occurs on the third day of the convention within the concert hall and has featured countless prominent faces in the chiptune community.

Super MAGFest also holds a continuous venue called Chipspace, a place where participants in the chiptune community go on-stage and perform their music through an open mic system. Originally started by Chiptunes=WIN founder Brandon L. Hood and maintained by geekbeatradio,
Chipspace has evolved over the course of MAGFest&#x27;s lifespan to bring chiptune fans closer together.
Among these daily performances are showcases, which are curated by chiptune netlabels such as Chiptunes = WIN, geekbeatradio, and more.

<doc id="83464" wikidata="Q635717" url="?curid=83464" title="Lizzie McGuire">
<text>Lizzie McGuire is an American comedy television series created by Terri Minsky that premiered on Disney Channel on January 12, 2001. The series stars Hilary Duff as the titular character who learns to navigate the personal and social issues of her teenage years. Duff also voices an animated version of Lizzie that performs soliloquies to express the character&#x27;s inner thoughts and emotions. The series also stars Lalaine, Adam Lamberg, Jake Thomas, Hallie Todd, and Robert Carradine. The series concluded on February 14, 2004, after a total of 65 episodes were produced. A feature film based on the series, &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot;, was released in 2003.

The series was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 2003 and 2004 for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program. The pilot received a nomination at the Writers Guild of America Awards for Best Children&#x27;s Script. The series also received various awards and nominations at the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards from 2002 to 2005. Television critics acknowledged the innocent nature of the series, and the appeal of the writing towards adolescents.

A revival series was announced in August 2019 to be entering production for Disney+, with Duff reprising her role and Minsky returning as showrunner, but Minsky later departed from the role. Lamberg, Thomas, Todd and Carradine were also attached to return to the series in their original roles. The series began production in association with Disney Channel, but entered a hiatus after Minsky&#x27;s departure and did not resume; the revival was officially canceled in December 2020.

==Premise==
The series follows Lizzie McGuire, a thirteen-year-old girl who faces the personal and social issues of adolescence. She attends junior high alongside her best friends Miranda and Gordo. Episodes depict Lizzie&#x27;s transition into adolescence at home and school, including the friends&#x27; rivalry with their classmate Kate, and affections for Ethan. Lizzie tries to develop her own identity, but is also attracted to the idea of popularity at school and longs for social acceptance by her peers. She has a close relationship with her family: her mother, Jo; her father, Sam; and her younger brother, Matt. Lizzie&#x27;s thoughts and emotions are conveyed sporadically in the episodes through her animated persona, who sometimes speaks to the audience.

==Production==
===Development===

In 2000, Hilary Duff was asked to audition for a series on Disney Channel. Created by Terri Minsky, the series was known by the working title &quot;What&#x27;s Lizzie Thinking?&quot; throughout development. The series was later retitled &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;, and Duff successfully auditioned for the title character of Lizzie, who was described as a regular teenager. The premise for the series was based on a script previously written by Minsky, which featured the main character&#x27;s inner thoughts and emotions as narration. Producer Stan Rogow conceived a high-concept version of the script in which an animated version of the character would be featured to convey these thoughts. This concept became known the &quot;animated Lizzie&quot; persona, and was also voiced by Duff. The animation was originally envisioned as a talking head in the corner of the screen. Rogow stated that the visual design of the show was inspired by the film &quot;Run Lola Run&quot;.

Independent animator Debra Solomon designed the animated version of Lizzie, based on Duff&#x27;s appearance on her audition tape. Rather than drawing a mere caricature of Duff, she tried to capture the actress&#x27;s essence by giving Lizzie&#x27;s alter ego a more &quot;hip&quot; look: cropped shirts with trim pants and high flip-flops. New York&#x27;s Tapehouse Toons produced the animation along with Kratky Studios. The drawings were digitally inked and painted using the Animo 3.1 software and then composited into the live-action footage at Disney&#x27;s Los Angeles studio. Due to the low budget given by Disney, there are only two minutes of animated Lizzie in each episode.

In July 2001, a second season of 22 episodes were ordered, to begin production in September and air in 2002. Lalaine&#x27;s character Miranda did not appear in the last 5 episodes filmed for the second season, or &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot;, due to Lalaine leaving the series early to work on other projects such as &quot;You Wish!&quot;. Filming of the movie and series concluded in December 2002 after 65 episodes were produced, a standard limit for Disney Channel&#x27;s series.

===Canceled spin-offs===
In May 2003, it was revealed that &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; would end production due to contract disagreements between Duff and Disney. The company was interested in transitioning the program into a high school-centered series for ABC and expanding the franchise with a further film, while Duff was receiving offers for lucrative roles with other studios. After the series ended its original run, Disney Channel also considered producing an animated version of the series. In November 2004, a pilot for an intended spin-off was ordered, which was to center on Miranda&#x27;s younger sister Stevie Sanchez and her Latino family. The series would follow the 12-year-old central character, who was played in the pilot by Selena Gomez, and would also feature an animated version of the character like Lizzie. It was to star LaLaine, and be produced by Minsky and Rogow. The pilot was produced in 2005, but the series was not picked up in favor of &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;.

===Canceled revival===
In December 2018, Duff stated that there had been discussions about reviving the series. On August 23, 2019, it was announced at the D23 Expo that Disney was developing a revival television series of &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;. The series was revealed to be in production for exclusive distribution on the Disney+ streaming service, with Duff reprising her role as the title character; the original series creator, Terri Minsky, planned to serve as the revival&#x27;s showrunner. The sequel series would have centered on Lizzie at the age of thirty, navigating life working as an apprentice to an interior decorator. She would be living in an apartment in Brooklyn, New York City, engaged to a man who owns a restaurant in SoHo, Manhattan. When Lizzie discovers her fiancé cheating on her, she returns home to Los Angeles. The animated alter ego of Lizzie would also have appeared in the series. The series was to be produced by Salty Pictures in association with Disney Channel as part of an overall deal with Minsky. Duff was to serve as an executive producer, alongside Rachel Winter, and co-executive producer Ranada Shepard. In October 2019, it was announced that Thomas, Todd and Carradine would also return to the series, reprising their roles as Matt, Jo and Sam McGuire respectively. It was later announced that Lamberg would be reprising his role as Gordo and Federico Dordei would be joining the cast as new character, Dominic Shaw. Production on the sequel series began on October 29, 2019, on location in Washington Square Park in New York. Further filming for the series would have taken place in Los Angeles.

Minsky departed as the showrunner of the revival in January 2020 after the first two episodes of the series had been filmed, due to creative differences with Disney. Production of the series was placed on a hiatus. In February 2020, Duff hinted on social media that production had stopped because the series was not thought &quot;family-friendly&quot; enough by Disney+ executives; Disney reaffirmed that the development of the series was ongoing. Duff later posted a statement publicly pleading for Disney+ to move the series to Hulu as had been done with &quot;Love, Victor&quot; and &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, stating that it would allow the series to fully represent the life of a thirty-year-old without the constraints of a &quot;family friendly&quot; classification. While it was reported in April 2020 that development was still ongoing, Duff announced the following December that the revival was officially canceled.

==Release==
The series premiered on Disney Channel on January 12, 2001, as a special sneak preview, following the premiere of the film &quot;&quot;. The series officially premiered on January 19, 2001. &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; was scheduled to begin airing in reruns on ABC as part of Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning on September 15, 2001. On September 14, 2002, the series began airing on the rebranded ABC Kids programming block.

In 2006, Superstation WGN acquired the rights to &quot;Even Stevens&quot; and &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;.

Egmont Imagination, who co-financed the production of the series with Disney, handled worldwide distribution of the series outside North America. After the division was shuttered by Egmont, Telescreen acquired its catalogue and began to distribute the series themselves.

==Other media==
===Film===
Walt Disney Pictures released a film based on the series, &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot;, on May 2, 2003, in the United States. Set after the conclusion of the series and her junior high graduation, the film follows Lizzie and her classmates on a school trip to Rome, Italy. It earned $42.7 million at the U.S. box office and $12.8 million internationally, for a total of $55.6 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who found it superficial, but thought the show&#x27;s fans would enjoy it.

===Merchandising===
Throughout the early 2000s, the series&#x27; popularity led Disney to release merchandise, including a series of books and comics, a Lizzie McGuire character doll, a bedroom set, and board games. Disney Interactive published three video games for the Game Boy Advance, including: &quot;Lizzie McGuire: On the Go!&quot; in 2003, &quot;Lizzie McGuire 2: Lizzie Diaries&quot; in 2004, and &quot;Lizzie McGuire 3: Homecoming Havoc&quot; in 2005. Toys were also released through a partnership with McDonald&#x27;s in 2004. &quot;Fortune&quot; estimated in 2003 that &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; merchandise had earned nearly $100 million. Two soundtracks for the series were produced, &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; and &quot;Lizzie McGuire Total Party!&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the first season of &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; has an approval rating of 80% based on reviews from 5 critics, while the second season has an approval rating of 100% based on reviews from 5 critics. Common Sense Media claimed that the series was relatable for both boys and girls, and described its representation of friendship as realistic. Reviewing the series premiere in 2001, Laura Fries of &quot;Variety&quot; called the program &quot;good-natured&quot;, and praised the writers&#x27; ability to include adolescent vernacular and pop culture references. A review on the &quot;DVDizzy&quot; blog called early episodes &quot;clever, funny, and pretty sincere&quot;, but suggested that the show later suffered from a creative decline in favor of more celebrity guest appearances. A DVD review by &quot;Dove.org&quot; in 2003 called the series &quot;wholesome&quot;, and noted its real-world lessons. Susan Benner of &quot;TV Guide&quot; praised the filming style of the show, and explained that the writing and pop-culture references would appeal to children. Katie Minard of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed &quot;Picture Day&quot; as the best episode of the series in her 2016 ranking, arguing that it has a relatable plot and an important moral.

<doc id="83465" wikidata="Q2744385" url="?curid=83465" title="Crack intro">
<text>A crack intro, also known as a cracktro, loader, or just intro, is a small introduction sequence added to cracked software. It aims to inform the user which cracking crew or individual cracker removed the software&#x27;s copy protection and distributed the crack.

==History==
Crack intros first appeared on Apple II computers in the late 1970s or early 1980s, and then on ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC games that were distributed around the world via Bulletin Board Systems (BBSes) and floppy disk copying. By 1985, when reviewing the commercially available ISEPIC cartridge which adds a custom crack intro to memory dumps of Commodore 64 software, &quot;Ahoy!&quot; wrote that such intros were &quot;in the tradition of the true hacker&quot;. Early crack intros resemble graffiti in many ways, although they invaded the private sphere and not the public space.

As time went on, crack intros became a medium to demonstrate the purported superiority of a cracking group. Such intros grew very complex, sometimes exceeding the size and complexity of the software itself. Crack intros only became more sophisticated on more advanced systems such as the Amiga, Atari ST, and some IBM PC compatibles with sound cards. These intros feature big, colourful effects, music, and scrollers.

Cracking groups would use the intros not just to gain credit for cracking, but to advertise their BBSes, greet friends, and gain themselves recognition. Messages were frequently of a vulgar nature, and on some occasions made threats of violence against software companies or the members of some rival crack-group.

Crack-intro programming eventually became an art form in its own right, and people started coding intros without attaching them to a crack just to show off how well they could program. This practice evolved into the demoscene.

Crack intros and other small software created by software crackers such as keygens and patches that remove protection from commercial applications often use chiptunes in the form of background music. These chiptunes are now still accessible as downloadable &quot;musicdisks&quot; or &quot;musicpacks&quot;.

<text>Arthur Eric Rowton Gill (22 February 1882 – 17 November 1940) was an English sculptor, letter cutter, typeface designer, and printmaker. Although the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; describes Gill as &quot;the greatest artist-craftsman of the twentieth century: a letter-cutter and type designer of genius&quot;, he is also a figure of considerable controversy following the revelations of his sexual abuse of two of his daughters and of his pet dog.

Gill was born in Brighton and grew up in Chichester, where he attended the local college before moving to London. There he became an apprentice with a firm of ecclesiastical architects and took evening classes in stone masonry and calligraphy. Gill abandoned his architectural training and set up a business cutting memorial inscriptions for buildings and headstones. He also began designing chapter headings and title pages for books.

As a young man, Gill was a member of the Fabian Society, but later resigned. Initially identifying with the Arts and Crafts Movement, by 1907 he was lecturing and campaigning against the movement&#x27;s perceived failings. He became a Roman Catholic in 1913 and remained so for the rest of his life. Gill established a succession of craft communities, each with a chapel at its centre and with an emphasis on manual labour as opposed to more modern industrial methods. The first of these communities was at Ditchling in Sussex, where Gill established the Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic for Catholic craftsmen. Many members of the Guild, including Gill, were also members of the Third Order of Saint Dominic, a lay division of the Dominican Order. At Ditchling, Gill and his assistants created several war memorials including those at Chirk in north Wales and at Trumpington near Cambridge, along with numerous works on religious subjects.

In 1924, the Gill family left Ditchling and moved to an isolated, disused monastery at Capel-y-ffin in the Black Mountains of Wales. The isolation of Capel-y-ffin suited Gill&#x27;s wish to distance himself from what he regarded as an increasingly secular and industrialised society, and his time there proved to be among the most productive of his artistic career. At Capel, Gill made the sculptures &quot;The Sleeping Christ&quot; (1925), &quot;Deposition&quot; (1925), and &quot;Mankind&quot; (1927). He created engravings for a series of books published by the Golden Cockerel Press considered among the finest of their kind, and it was at Capel that he designed the typefaces Perpetua, Gill Sans, and Solus. After four years at Capel, Gill and his family moved into a quadrangle of properties at Speen in Buckinghamshire. From there, in the last decade of his life, Gill became an architectural sculptor of some fame, creating large, high profile works for central London buildings, including both the headquarters of the BBC and the forerunner of London Underground. His mammoth frieze &quot;The Creation of Man&quot; was the British Government&#x27;s gift to the new League of Nations building in Geneva. Despite failing health Gill was active as a sculptor until the last weeks of his life, leaving several works to be completed by his assistants after his death.

Gill was a prolific writer on religious and social matters, with some 300 printed works including books and pamphlets to his name. He frequently courted controversy with his opposition to industrialisation, modern commerce, and the use of machinery in both the home and the workplace. In the years preceding World War II, he embraced pacifism and left-wing causes.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Eric Gill was born in 1882 in Hamilton Road, Brighton, the second of the 13 children of the Reverend Arthur Tidman Gill and (Cicely) Rose King (died 1929), formerly a professional singer of light opera under the name Rose le Roi. Arthur Tidman Gill had left the Congregational Church in 1878 over doctrinal disagreements and became a minister of the Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s Connexion, a grouping of Calvinist Methodists. Arthur was born in the South Seas, where his father, George Gill, was a Congregational minister and missionary. Eric Gill was the elder brother of the graphic artist MacDonald &quot;Max&quot; Gill (1884–1947). Two of his other brothers, Romney and Cecil, became Anglican missionaries while their sister, Madeline, became a nun and also undertook missionary work. The film historian David Gill was a nephew.

In 1897, the family moved to Chichester, when Arthur Tidman Gill left the Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s Connexion, became a mature student at Chichester Theological College and joined the Church of England. Eric Gill studied at Chichester Technical and Art School, where he won a Queen&#x27;s Prize for perspective drawing and developed a passion for lettering. Later in his life, Gill cited the Norman and medieval carved stone panels in Chichester Cathedral as a major influence on his sculpture. In 1900, Gill became disillusioned with Chichester and moved to London to train as an architect with the practice of W. D. Caröe, specialists in ecclesiastical architecture with a large office close to Westminster Abbey.

=== London 1900–1907 ===
Frustrated with his architectural training, Gill took evening classes in stonemasonry at the Westminster Technical Institute and, from 1901, in calligraphy at the Central School of Arts and Crafts while continuing to work at Caröe&#x27;s. The calligraphy course was run by Edward Johnston, creator of the London Underground typeface, who became a strong and lasting influence on Gill. For a year, until 1903, Gill and Johnston shared lodgings at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in central London. 

During 1903, Gill gave up training in architecture to become a calligrapher, letter-cutter and monumental mason. After making a copy of a small stone tablet from Westminster Abbey, Gill&#x27;s first public inscription was for a stone memorial tablet, to a Percy Joseph Hiscock, in Chichester Cathedral. Through a contact at the Central School, Gill was employed to cut the inscription for a tombstone at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey. Other work quickly followed, including an inscription for Holy Trinity, Sloane Street, plus commissions from architects and private individuals, including Count Kessler. Kessler, on Johnston&#x27;s recommendation, employed Gill to design chapter headings and title pages for the Insel Verlag publishing house. W.H. Smith &amp; Son employed Gill to paint the lettering on the fascias of several of their bookshops including, in 1903, their Paris store. For a time, Gill combined this work with his job at Caröe&#x27;s but eventually the scale and frequency of these commissions required him to leave the company. After Gill died, his brother, Evan, compiled an inventory of 762 inscriptions known to have been carved by him.

In 1904, Gill married Ethel Hester Moore (1878–1961), a former art student, later known as Mary, the daughter of a businessman who was also the head verger at Chichester Cathedral. Gill and Moore would eventually have three daughters and foster a son. After a short period in Battersea, the couple moved into 20 Black Lion Lane, Hammersmith in west London, near the, recently married, Johnstons&#x27; home on Hammersmith Terrace. Artists associated with the Arts and Crafts movement, including Emery Walker, T. J. Cobden-Sanderson and May Morris were already based in the area, as were several printing presses, including the Doves Press. Gill formed a business partnership with Lawrence Christie and recruited staff, including the 14-year old Joseph Cribb, to work in his studio. Gill began giving lectures at the Central School and taught courses in monumental masonry and lettering for stonemasons at the Paddington Institute. In 1905, he was elected to the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society and joined the Fabian Society the following year. After a period of intense involvement with the Fabians, Gill became disillusioned with both them and the Arts and Craft movement. By 1907 he was writing and making speeches about the failures, both theoretical and practical, of the craft movement to resist the advance of mass-production.

In his diaries, Gill records two affairs while living at Hammersmith. He had a brief affair with the family maid while his wife was pregnant and then a relationship with Lillian Meacham, who he met through the Fabian Society. Gill and Meacham visited the Paris Opera and Chartres Cathedral together and when their affair ended, she became an apprentice in Gill&#x27;s workshop and remained a family friend throughout his life.

=== Ditchling Village 1907–1913 ===
In 1907, Gill moved with his family to Sopers, a house in the village of Ditchling in Sussex, which would later become the centre of an artists&#x27; community inspired by Gill. Although by April 1908 Gill had established a workshop in Ditchling and dissolved his business partnership with Lawrence Christie, he continued to spend considerable amounts of time in London visiting clients and delivering lectures, while his wife Ethel organised their household and smallholding in Sussex. In London, Gill would stay at his old lodgings in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn with his brother Max or with his sister Gladys and Ernest Laughton, her future husband. Gill continued to concentrate on lettering and inscriptions for stonework and employed a pupil for his signwriting business. He also began to use wood engraving techniques for his book illustration work, including a 1907 edition of &quot;Homer&quot; for Count Kessler.

Late in 1909, Gill decided to become a sculptor. Gill had always considered himself an artisan craftsman rather than an artist. He rejected the usual sculpture technique of first making a model and then scaling up using a pointing machine, in favour of directly carving the final figure. His first sculptures included &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; (1910), which the art critic Roger Fry described as a depiction of &quot;pathetic animalism&quot;, and the almost life-size work now known as &quot;Ecstasy&quot; (1911). The models for &quot;Ecstasy&quot; were his sister Gladys Gill and her husband Ernest Laughton. The incestuous relationships between Gill and Gladys that continued during their lives had already begun at this point. There is also some evidence, from Gill&#x27;s own writings, of an incestuous relationship with Angela, another of his sisters.

An early admirer of Gill&#x27;s sculptures was William Rothenstein and he introduced Gill, who was fascinated by Indian temple sculptures, to the Ceylonese philosopher and art historian Ananda Coomaraswamy. Along with his friend and collaborator Jacob Epstein, Gill planned the construction in the Sussex countryside of a colossal, hand-carved monument in imitation of the large-scale structures at Gwalior Fort in Madhya Pradesh. Throughout the second half of 1910, Epstein and Gill would meet on an almost daily basis, but eventually their friendship soured very badly. Earlier in the year they had held long discussions with Rothenstein and other artists, including Augustus John and Ambrose McEvoy, about the formation of a religious brotherhood. At Ditchling, Epstein worked on elements of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s tomb in Père Lachaise cemetery for which Gill designed the inscription before sending Joseph Cribb, who had moved to Ditchling in 1907, to Paris to carve the lettering.

Gill had his first sculpture exhibition in 1911 at the Chenil Gallery in London. Eight works by Gill were included in the Second Post-Impressionism Exhibition organised by Roger Fry at the Grafton Galleries in London during 1912 and 1913.

By 1912, while Gill&#x27;s main source of income was from gravestone inscriptions, he had also carved Madonna figures and was widely assumed, wrongly at that time, to be a Catholic artist. As such he was invited to an exhibition of Catholic art in Brussels and, on route, stayed for some days at the Benedictine monastery at Mont-César Abbey near Louvain. Gill&#x27;s experiences at Louvain, seeing the monks at prayer and hearing plainsong for the first time convinced him to become a Catholic. In February 1913, after religious instructions from English Benedictines, Gill and Ethel were received into the Catholic Church and Ethel changed her name to Mary.

===Westminster Cathedral 1914–1918===

In 1913, after Gill and his wife became Roman Catholics they moved to Hopkin&#x27;s Crank at Ditchling Common, two miles north of Ditchling village. There, Gill worked primarily for Catholic clients, such as his 1914 commission for the 14 Stations of the Cross in Westminster Cathedral. Gill was a surprising choice for the commission as he had only recently become a Catholic and had only been a sculptor for three years. However he was prepared to do the work quicker and for a lower fee than more established sculptors would. Gill modelled both the Christ figure in panel ten and a soldier in the second panel on himself. The Stations were not universally well received when they were erected with criticism of their simple appearance and how starkly they contrasted with the rest of the cathedral interior. A minority, that eventually included Nikolaus Pevsner, praised their uncluttered design and unsentimental treatment of the subject. They are now considered among Gill&#x27;s most accomplished large scale works. Subsequently, Gill submitted proposals for decorations and works in other parts of the Cathedral building and, eventually, his design for the Chapel of Saint George and the English Martyrs was commissioned.

Gill had been granted exemption from military service while working on the Stations of the Cross and when they were finished spent three months, from September 1918, as a driver at an RAF camp in Dorset, before returning to Ditchling.

=== Ditchling Common 1918–1924 ===
After World War I, together with Hilary Pepler and Desmond Chute, Gill founded a guild association to promote the ideals of medieval, or pre-industrial, craft production, the Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic at Ditchling. The Guild&#x27;s emphasis was on manual labour as opposed to more modern industrial methods, such that they did not use mechanised tools and considered craft working a form of holy worship. All members of the Guild were Catholics and most, including Gill, were also members of the Third Order of Saint Dominic, a third order of the Dominican Order. Lay members were not expected to follow the Dominicans&#x27; daily Liturgy of the Hours, a schedule of prayers from the Angelus at 6am to Compline at 9pm, but the group at Ditchling, unusually, did so. A chapel, designed by Gill, was built in the centre of the Guild&#x27;s workshops and a wooden cross, with a Christ figure carved by Gill, was erected on a nearby hill. Gill had also taken to wearing a habit, often with a symbolic cord of chastity added. In his family home, Gill determined that the household was to be free of modern appliances, with no bathroom, water drawn by a pump and cooking done on a log fire. One guest who brought a typewriter into the house was scolded for doing so. The children did not attend school.
Alongside the Guild, Pepler set up the St Dominic&#x27;s Press with a 100-year old Stanhope press that he bought. The Press printed books and pamphlets promoting the ideals of the Guilds&#x27; traditional craft techniques and also provided an outlet for Gill&#x27;s engravings and woodcut illustrations. Gill and Pepler together produced issues of &quot;The Game&quot;, a small journal, mostly illustrated by Gill and containing articles on craft and social matters. The views promoted by Gill and Pepler in &quot;The Game&quot; and their other publications were often deliberately provocative, anti-capitalist and opposed to industrialisation.

Along with his Guild work and illustrations, Gill designed several war memorials in this period. These included the Trumpington War Memorial in Cambridgeshire, the Chirk War Memorial in north Wales, the memorial at Ditchling, and the wall panel recording 228 names of the fallen in the ante-chapel at New College, Oxford. Gill also created the memorial at Briantspuddle in Dorset and, with Chute and Hilary Stratton, the monument at South Harting. Beside the main entrance to the British Museum, Gill designed and carved, with Joseph Cribb, the memorial inscription to the museum staff killed in the conflict and for the Victoria and Albert Museum, again with Cribb, he created the war memorial in that museum&#x27;s entrance hall. Previously, in 1911, Gill had cut the inscription for the foundation stone of the British Museum&#x27;s new King Edward VII building. Gill&#x27;s other significant work from this period was the Stations of the Cross that he carved, with Chute, for the Church of St Cuthbert in the Manningham area of Bradford.

Commissioned to produce a war memorial for the University of Leeds, Gill produced a frieze depicting the Cleansing of the Temple but showing contemporary merchants as the money-changers Jesus was driving from the Temple. While fully aware that this was an inappropriate subject for a war memorial and one likely to cause great offence in a commercial centre such as Leeds, Gill persisted with the design regardless. The cartoon-like nature of the finished frieze, which included the Hound of St Dominic knocking over a cash till, only added to the ferocity of the resulting uproar.

Even before the Leeds memorial controversy, Gill&#x27;s series of illustrations that included the &quot;Nuptials of God&quot;, &quot;The Convert&quot; and &quot;Divine Lovers&quot; and his views on the sexual nature of Christianity were causing alarm within the Roman Catholic hierarchy and distancing Gill from other members of the Ditchling community. The series of life-drawings and prints of his daughters, including &quot;Girl in Bath&quot; and &quot;Hair Combing&quot; done at Ditchling, were considered among Gill&#x27;s finest works. The sexual abuse Gill was perpetrating on his two eldest daughters during the same period only became known after his death.

Professional craft workers joined the community, such that by the early 1920s the community had grown to 41 people, occupying several houses in the 20 acres surrounding the Guild&#x27;s chapel and workshops. Visitors to the Common included G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc, whose Distributist ideas the Guild followed. Some young men who had been in combat in World War I came to stay for longer periods. These included Denis Tegetmeier, Reginald Lawson and the artist and poet David Jones, who was to become engaged for a time to Gill&#x27;s second daughter, Petra. 
However, Gill became disillusioned with the direction of the Guild and fell out badly with his close friend Pepler, partly over the latter&#x27;s wish to expand the community and form closer ties with Ditchling village and also because Gill&#x27;s daughter, Betty, wanted to marry Pepler&#x27;s son, David. Gill resigned from the Guild in July 1924 and, after considering other locations in Britain and Ireland, moved his family to a deserted monastery in the Black Mountains of Wales.

=== Capel-y-ffin 1924–1928 ===
In August 1924, the Gills left Ditchling and, with two other families, moved to a disused Anglican monastery, Llanthony Abbey, at Capel-y-ffin in the Black Mountains of Wales. The dilapidated building was high in an isolated valley about fourteen miles from Abergavenny. Finding the monastery chapel beyond repair, a new one was quickly built and a Benedictine monk from Caldey Abbey was assigned to the group to hold a daily Mass. Donald Attwater arrived at Capel-y-ffin shortly before the Gills, David Jones and René Hague, Joan Gill&#x27;s future husband, all joined shortly after. Joseph Cribb did not make the move to Wales but his younger brother, Lawrence Cribb (1898–1979), did and eventually became Gill&#x27;s main assistant.

Within a few weeks of arriving at Capel-y-ffin, Gill completed &quot;Deposition&quot;, a black marble torso of Christ, and made &quot;The Sleeping Christ&quot;, a stone head now in Manchester City Art Gallery. In 1926 he completed a sculpture of &quot;Tobias and Sara&quot; for the library of St John&#x27;s College, Oxford. A war memorial altarpiece in oak relief for Rossall School was completed in 1927.

When approached, in 1924, by Robert Gibbings to produce designs for the Golden Cockerel Press which he and his wife, Moira, had recently acquired, Gill initially refused to work with the couple as they were not Catholics. Gill changed his mind when they sought to publish a volume of poems by his sister Enid. The relationship between Gill and the Gibbingses grew such that throughout the following ten years Gill became the chief engraver and illustrator for the Golden Cockerel Press. Several of the resulting books, including &quot;The Song of Songs&quot; (1925), &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; (1927), &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (1928), and &quot;The Four Gospels&quot; (1931) are considered classics of specialist book production. Gill created striking designs that unified and integrated illustrations into the text and also created a new typeface for the Press. The erotic nature of &quot;The Song of Songs&quot; and of the illustrations for Edward Powys Mathers&#x27;s &quot;Procreant Hymn&quot; caused considerable controversy in Roman Catholic circles and led to protracted arguments between Gill and members of the clergy. The Golden Cockerel printed four of Gill&#x27;s own books and he illustrated a further thirteen works for the press. In addition, between 1924 and his death, Gill wrote 38 books and illustrated a further 28. 

The other key working relationship Gill established while at Capel-y-ffin was with Stanley Morison, the Typographic Advisor to the Monotype Corporation. Morison persuaded Gill to apply the skills and knowledge he had gained in letter cutting to fonts suitable for mechanical reproduction. It was at Capel that Gill designed the typefaces Perpetua (1925), Gill Sans (1927 onwards) and began work on Solus (1929). Gill Sans is considered one of the most successful typefaces ever designed and remains in widespread use.

While living at Capel-y-ffin, Gill spent many weekends at Robert and Moira Gibbings&#x27; home in Waltham St Lawrence, enjoying the couple&#x27;s unconventional and hedonistic lifestyle. He was also spending sizable amounts of time in Bristol with a group of young intellectuals centred around Douglas Cleverdon, a bookseller who published and distributed some of Gill&#x27;s writings. From 1925 onwards, Gills&#x27; secretary, and mistress, was Elizabeth Bill. Bill owned a villa set in several acres in the French Pyrenees at Salies-de-Béarn and which the Gills often visited. The Gill family spent the winter of 1926–27 there, and which was where Gill did many of the engravings for &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot;. For the last months of 1927 he worked in a studio in London at Glebe Place in Chelsea creating the sculpture originally known as &quot;Humanity&quot; and now called &quot;Mankind&quot;. The work, a giant torso, was modelled by Angela Gill and shown at the Goupil Gallery in London, to considerable acclaim, before being purchased by the artist Eric Kennington. Some years later, Kennington offered the work to Whipsnade Zoo. The zoo refused the offer, and the work is now in the Tate collection but displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

It had been too impractical to transport the stone for &quot;Mankind&quot; to Capel-y-ffin and it was clear that the site had become too remote and isolated for Gill&#x27;s increasing commercial workload and by May 1928 he was seeking a new home for his family and workshops.

===Pigotts, Buckinghamshire 1928–1934===
In October 1928, the Gill family moved to Pigotts at Speen, five miles from High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. Around a quadrangle with a central pigsty were a large farmhouse housing Eric and Mary Gill, a cottage for Petra and her husband Denis Tegetmeier and another for Joanna and René Hague. Stables and barns were converted to studios and workshops and to house printing presses. A chapel was fitted into one corner and licensed within six months for the saying of Mass.

The success of his 1928 exhibition at the Goupil Gallery had raised Gill&#x27;s profile considerably and led to Charles Holden commissioning him to lead a team of five sculptors, including Henry Moore, in creating some of the external sculptures for the new headquarters building of the London Electric Railway, the forerunner of London Underground. Gill started on the project within days of arriving at Pigotts and worked on site in London from November 1928 to carve three of eight relief sculptures on the theme of &quot;The Four Winds&quot; for the building.
&quot;Art-Nonsense And Other Essays by Eric Gill&quot; was published in 1929 and marked the first commercial use of the &quot;Perpetua&quot; typeface. The frontispiece of the book had an engraving of &quot;Belle Sauvage&quot;, an image of a naked women stepping out of some woods. The various versions of &quot;Belle Sauvage&quot; became among the most popular of Gill&#x27;s illustrations and were modelled by Beatrice Warde, a historian of typography, an executive of the Monotype Corporation and sometimes Gill&#x27;s lover. 

In 1929, Douglas Cleverdon published &quot;Engravings by Eric Gill&quot;. This edition reproduced over a hundred of Gill&#x27;s engravings on wood and metal up to the year 1927, and also included a complete chronological list of engravings, and a preface by Gill.

By 1930 Gladys Gill had divorced her second husband after her first, Ernest Laughton, had been killed in the Battle of the Somme, and she and Eric appear, from his diary entries, to have resumed their incestuous relationship. Later that same year, the diaries record what Gill called his &quot;experiments&quot; with a dog. In September 1930, he was taken seriously ill with a variety of symptoms, including amnesia, and spent several weeks in hospital.

The following two years were among the most creatively accomplished of Gill&#x27;s career, with several achievements. The Hague and Gill press was established at Pigotts in 1931 and eventually printed 16 of Gill&#x27;s own books and booklets while he also illustrated six other books for the company. For the Hague and Gill press he created the &quot;Joanna&quot; typeface, which was eventually adapted for commercial use by Monotype. He completed &quot;The Four Gospels&quot;, widely considered to be the finest of all the books produced by the Golden Cockerel Press, and began working on the sculpture &quot;Prospero and Ariel&quot; for the BBC&#x27;s Broadcasting House in London. Throughout 1931 and into 1932, Gill worked on &quot;Prospero and Ariel&quot;, and four other works for the BBC, on site in central London. Carving in the open air up on scaffolding in the middle of London further increased Gill&#x27;s public profile. Although Gill had accepted the BBC&#x27;s choice of subject matter when he took the commission, he did not see its relevance and frequently claimed that the figures he created represented God the Father and God the Son, the latter complete with the marks of the stigmata.

The Midland Hotel, Morecambe was built in 1932–33 by the London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway to the Art Deco design of Oliver Hill and included several works by Gill, Marion Dorn, and Eric Ravilious. For the project Gill, with Lawrence Cribb and Donald Potter, produced two seahorses, modelled as Morecambe shrimps, for the outside entrance; a round plaster relief on the ceiling of the circular staircase inside the hotel; a decorative wall map of the north-west of England; and a large stone relief of Odysseus being welcomed from the sea by Nausicaa for the entrance lounge. While working in Morecambe, Gill met May Reeves, who became a regular visitor to Pigotts before moving there to run a small school and becoming Gill&#x27;s resident mistress for several years.

===Jerusalem and Pigotts, 1934–1938===
In 1934 Gill, with Lawrence Cribb, visited Jerusalem to work at the Palestine Archaeological Museum, now the Rockefeller Archaeological Museum. There they carved a stone bas-relief of the meeting of Asia and Africa above the front entrance, together with ten stone reliefs illustrating different cultures, and a gargoyle fountain in the inner courtyard. He also carved stone signage throughout the museum in English, Hebrew and Arabic.

Gill&#x27;s two visits to Jerusalem had a profound impact on his state of mind. He became increasingly unhappy with the impact of humanity upon the world and also become convinced of his own role as one chosen by God to change society. Returning to England, Gill&#x27;s mood of pessimism deepened with the death of his son-in-law, David Pepler, and he became increasingly antagonistic towards the Church and towards other artists. Paradoxically, alongside this despondent world view Gill dropped his long-standing opposition to the use of modern home comforts and appliances. A bathroom was installed at Pigotts, a chauffeur and a gardener were appointed and his secretaries were allowed to use typewriters. Religious observance was no longer expected of the workshop staff and among the additional apprentices and assistants Gill employed were non-Catholics, including Walter Ritchie. Prudence Pelham, the daughter of the Earl of Chichester, became Gill&#x27;s only female apprentice. During his career, Gill employed at least twenty-seven apprentices including his nephew John Skelton, Hilary Stratton, Desmond Chute, David Kindersley and Donald Potter.

Gill&#x27;s 1935 essay &quot;All Art is Propaganda&quot; marked a complete reversal of his previous belief that artists should not concern themselves with political activity. He became a supporter of social credit and later moved towards a socialist position. In 1934, Gill contributed art to an exhibition mounted by the left-wing Artists&#x27; International Association, and defended the exhibition against accusations in &quot;The Catholic Herald&quot; that its art was &quot;anti-Christian&quot;. Gill became a regular speaker at left-wing meetings and rallies throughout the second half of the 1930s. He was adamantly opposed to fascism, and was one of the few Catholics in Britain to openly support the Spanish Republicans. Gill became a pacifist and helped set up the Catholic peace organisation Pax with E. I. Watkin and Donald Attwater. Later, Gill joined the Peace Pledge Union and supported the British branch of the Fellowship of Reconciliation.

Gill was commissioned to produce a sequence of seven bas-relief panels for the façade of The People&#x27;s Palace, now the Great Hall of Queen Mary University of London, which opened in 1936. In 1937, he designed the background of the first George VI definitive stamp series for the post office. In 1938 Gill was commissioned to create a mammoth artwork for the Palace of Nations building in Geneva, as the British Government&#x27;s gift to the League of Nations. Gill&#x27;s original proposal was to create a larger, international, version of the &quot;Moneychangers&quot; frieze that had caused such outrage in Leeds years earlier, but after objections from delegates to the League, submitted an alternative scheme. &quot;The Creation of Man&quot; flanked by &quot;Man&#x27;s Gifts to God&quot; and &quot;God&#x27;s Gifts to Man&quot; are three marble bas-reliefs in seventeen sections and constitute the largest single work Gill created during his career but are not considered among his finest works.

In 1935, Gill was elected an Honorary Associate of the Institute of British Architects and in 1937 was made a Royal Designer for Industry, the highest British award for designers, by the Royal Society of Arts, and became a founder-member of the RSA&#x27;s Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry when it was established in 1938. In April 1937, Gill was elected an associate member of the Royal Academy. Quite why Gill was offered, let alone accepted, these honours from institutions he had openly reviled throughout his career is unclear.

===Final works, 1939–1940===
During 1938 and 1939 Gill designed his only complete piece of architecture, the Roman Catholic Church of St Peter the Apostle at Gorleston-on-Sea. He designed the building around a central altar which, at the time, was considered a radical departure from the Catholic practice of the altar being at the east end of a church.

Gill&#x27;s final publications included &quot;Twenty-Five Nudes&quot; and &quot;Drawings from Life&quot; both of which included drawings of Daisy Hawkins, the teenage daughter of the Gills&#x27; housekeeper with whom Gill began an affair in 1937. The affair lasted two years during which time Gill drew her on an almost daily basis. When Hawkins was sent away from Pigotts, to the boarding house at Capel-y-ffin run by Betty Gill, Eric Gill followed her there to continue the relationship.

Among Gill&#x27;s last sculptures were a series of commissions for Guildford Cathedral. He spent time between October and December 1939 working at Guildford, on scaffolding carving the figure of John the Baptist. He also worked on a set of panels depicting the stations of the cross for the Anglican St Alban&#x27;s Church in Oxford, finishing the drawings three weeks before he died and completing nine of the pieces himself. For the Chapel of Saint George and the English Martyrs, in Westminster Cathedral, Gill designed a low relief sculpture to occupy the wall behind the altar. Gill&#x27;s design showed a life-sized figure of Christ the Priest on the cross attended by Sir Thomas More and John Fisher. Gill died before the work was completed and Lawrence Cribb was tasked with finishing the piece by the Cathedral authorities who insisted he remove an element of Gill&#x27;s original design, a figure of a pet monkey. When the chapel was eventually opened to the public this censorship of Gills&#x27; last work was a matter of some considerable controversy.

From the end of 1939 into the middle of 1940, Gill had a series of illnesses, including rubella, but managed to write his autobiography that summer. Gill died of lung cancer in Harefield Hospital in Middlesex on the morning of Sunday 17 November 1940 and, after a funeral mass at the Pigotts chapel, was buried in Speen&#x27;s Baptist churchyard.

After Gill died an inventory of over 750 of his carved inscriptions was compiled, in addition to the over 100 stone sculptures and reliefs, 1000 engravings, the several typeface designs he created and his 300 printed works including books, articles and pamphlets.

Gill&#x27;s religious beliefs did not limit his sexual activity, which included several extramarital affairs. His religious views contrast with his deviant sexual behaviour, including, as described in his personal diaries, the child sexual abuse of his adolescent daughters, an incestuous relationship with at least one of his sisters, and also sexual experiments with a dog. Since these revelations became public in 1989, there have been calls for works by Gill to be removed from public buildings and art collections. This aspect of Gill&#x27;s life was little known beyond his family and friends until the publication of the 1989 biography by Fiona MacCarthy. A 1966 biography by Robert Speaight mentioned none of it. 

Gill&#x27;s daughter Petra Tegetmeier, who was alive at the time of the MacCarthy biography, described her father as having &quot;endless curiosity about sex&quot; and that &quot;we just took it for granted&quot;, and told her friend Patrick Nuttgens she was unembarrassed. The children were educated at home and, according to Tegetmeier, she was then unaware of how her father&#x27;s behaviour would seem to others. Despite the acclaim the book received, and the widespread revulsion towards aspects of Gill&#x27;s sexual life that followed publication, MacCarthy received some criticism for revealing Gill&#x27;s incest in his daughter&#x27;s lifetime. Others, like Bernard Levin, thought she had been too indulgent towards Gill. MacCarthy commented: 
[A]fter the initial shock, ... as Gill&#x27;s history of adulteries, incest, and experimental connection with his dog became public knowledge in the late 1980s, the consequent reassessment of his life and art left his artistic reputation strengthened. Gill emerged as one of the twentieth century&#x27;s strangest and most original controversialists, a sometimes infuriating, always arresting spokesman for man&#x27;s continuing need of God in an increasingly materialistic civilization, and for intellectual vigour in an age of encroaching triviality.

Despite MacCarthy&#x27;s revelations, for several years Gill&#x27;s reputation as an artist continued to grow but, following the exposure of other high-profile paedophiles, this changed with groups and individuals calling for the removal of works by Gill.

In 1998, a group, Ministers and Clergy Sexual Abuse Survivors, called for Gill&#x27;s &quot;Stations of the Cross&quot; to be removed from Westminster Cathedral, leading to a debate within the British Catholic press. There were calls for Gill&#x27;s statue of St Michael the Archangel to be removed from St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church in Dumbarton. In 2016, some residents in Ditchling objected to a proposal to erect a plaque by the village war memorial which would have identified Gill as the maker of the monument.
In January 2022, a man climbed the façade of Broadcasting House and damaged the statue of &quot;Prospero and Ariel&quot; with a hammer, while another man shouted about Gill&#x27;s paedophilia. Some 2,500 people had previously signed a petition calling on the BBC to take the work down. In May 2023 the statue was again attacked by a man wielding a hammer. Guildford Cathedral announced in February 2022 that it was considering a &#x27;new interpretation&#x27; concerning Gill&#x27;s statues of John the Baptist and of Christ on the Cross which are on their building. Several organisations, including Save the Children, resolved to stop using typefaces designed by Gill.

When, in 2017, the journalist Rachel Cooke contacted museums holding Gill&#x27;s work to question what, if any, impact the abuse revelations had on their policy towards showing material by him, the majority refused to engage with her. An exception was the Ditchling Museum of Art + Craft, which holds many examples of Gill&#x27;s work and also Gill family objects. Previously, in October 2016, the museum had held a workshop, &quot;Not Turning a Blind Eye&quot;, with artists, curators and journalists invited to discuss how to address Gill&#x27;s behaviour in its exhibition programme. This resulted in a 2017 exhibition &quot;Eric Gill: The Body&quot; and a commitment by the museum to include at least one display highlighting Gill&#x27;s offending in its permanent exhibitions. However in 2022, &quot;The Observer&quot; reported that it appeared that the museum had decided to reduce the prominence given to Gill&#x27;s work among its exhibits.

== Typefaces and inscriptions ==
In 1909, Gill carved &quot;Alphabets and Numerals&quot; for a book, &quot;Manuscript and Inscription Letters for Schools and Classes and for the Use of Craftsmen&quot;, compiled by Edward Johnston. He later gave them to the Victoria and Albert Museum so they could be used by students at the Royal College of Art. In 1914, Gill had met the typographer Stanley Morison, later a typographic consultant for the Monotype Corporation. Commissioned by Morison, he designed the Gill Sans typeface in 1927–30. Gill Sans was based on the sans-serif lettering originally designed for the London Underground. Gill had collaborated with Edward Johnston in the early design of the Underground typeface, but dropped out of the project before it was completed. In 1925, he designed the Perpetua typeface for Morison, with the uppercase based upon monumental Roman inscriptions. An in-situ example of Gill&#x27;s design and personal cutting in the style of Perpetua can be found in the nave of the church in Poling, West Sussex, on a wall plaque commemorating the life of Sir Harry Johnston. In the period 1930–31, Gill designed the typeface Joanna which he used to hand-set his book, &quot;An Essay on Typography&quot;.

Gill&#x27;s other types include:
* Golden Cockerel Press Type (for the Golden Cockerel Press; 1929) Designed bolder than some of Gill&#x27;s other typefaces to provide a complement to wood engravings.
* Solus (1929)
* Aries (1932)
* Floriated Capitals (1932)
* Bunyan (1934)
* Pilgrim (recut version of Bunyan; 1953)
* Jubilee (also known as Cunard; 1934)

These dates are not precise, since a lengthy period could pass between Gill creating a design and it being finalised by the Monotype drawing office team (who would work out many details such as spacing) and cut into metal. In addition, some designs such as Joanna were released to fine printing use long before they became widely available from Monotype.

One of the most widely used British typefaces, Gill Sans, was used in the classic design system of Penguin Books and by the London and North Eastern Railway and later British Railways, with many additional styles created by Monotype both during and after Gill&#x27;s lifetime. In the 1990s, the BBC adopted Gill Sans for its wordmark and many of its on-screen television graphics.

The family Gill Facia was created by Colin Banks as an emulation of Gill&#x27;s stone carving designs, with separate styles for smaller and larger text.

Gill was commissioned to develop a typeface with the number of allographs limited to what could be used on Monotype systems or Linotype machines. The typeface was loosely based on the Arabic Naskh style but was considered unacceptably far from the norms of Arabic script. It was rejected and never cut into type.

== Published works ==

Gill published numerous essays on the relationship between art and religion, and erotic engravings.

* The Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ, according to the four evangelists. Hague &amp; Gill Printers. 1934 Faber &amp; Faber
== Archives ==
Gill&#x27;s reference file of his engraved work, including impressions of almost all the engravings together with some related drawings, was donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum by his widow in 1952. The collection was supplemented by a later donation from Douglas Cleverdon. The collection formed the basis of a catalogue of Gill&#x27;s engraved work prepared by John Physick and published in 1963.

Gill&#x27;s papers and library are archived at the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library at UCLA in California, designated by the Gill family as the repository for his manuscripts and correspondence. Some of the books in his collection have been digitised as part of the Internet Archive. Additional archival and book collections related to Gill and his work reside at the University of Waterloo Library and the University of Notre Dame&#x27;s Hesburgh Library. Much of Gill&#x27;s work and memorabilia is held and is on display at the Ditchling Museum of Art + Craft.

<text>Lazarus Long is a fictional character featured in a number of science fiction novels by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. Born in 1912 in the third generation of a selective breeding experiment run by the Ira Howard Foundation, Lazarus (birth name Woodrow Wilson Smith) becomes unusually long-lived, living well over two thousand years with the aid of occasional rejuvenation treatments. Heinlein &quot;patterned&quot; Long on science fiction writer Edward E. Smith, mixed with Jack Williamson&#x27;s fictional Giles Habibula.

His exact (natural) life span is never revealed. In his introduction at the beginning of &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot;, he claims he is 213 years old. Approximately 75 years pass during the course of the novel, but because large amounts of this time are spent traveling close to the speed of light, the 75-year measurement is an expression of the time elapsed on Earth, rather than time seen from his perspective. At one point, he estimates his natural life span to be around 250 years, but this number is not expressed with certainty. He acknowledges that such a long life span should not be expected as a result of a mere three generations of selective breeding, but offers no alternative explanation except by having a character declare: &quot;A mutation, of course — which simply says that we don&#x27;t know&quot;.

In &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot;, Long mentions visiting Hugo Pinero, the scientist appearing in Heinlein&#x27;s first published story &quot;Life-Line&quot;, who had invented a machine that precisely measured lifespan. Pinero refuses to reveal the results of Lazarus&#x27;s reading and returns his money.

The promotional copy on the back of &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, the second book featuring Lazarus Long, states that Lazarus was &quot;so in love with time that he became his own ancestor&quot;, but this never happens in any of the published books. In the book, Lazarus does travel back in time and is seduced by his mother, but this takes place years after his own birth. Heinlein did, however, use just such a plot device in the short story &#x27;—All You Zombies—&#x27;, in which a character becomes both of his own parents.

A rugged individualist with a distrust of authority, Lazarus drifts from world to world, settling down periodically and leaving when the situation becomes too regimented for his taste, often just before an angry mob arrives to capture him.

The Lazarus Long set of books involve time travel, parallel dimensions, free love, individualism, and a concept that Heinlein named World as Myth — the theory that universes are created by the act of imagining them, such that even fictional worlds are real.

== Appearances ==
Novels featuring Lazarus include:
* &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot; (serialized 1941, expanded to novel 1958)
* &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; (1973)
* &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; (1980)
* &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot; (1985)
* &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot; (1987)

&quot;The Notebooks of Lazarus Long&quot;, a book containing sayings of the character Lazarus Long largely taken from &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, was published in 1978.

James Gifford postulates that Doctor MacRae in &quot;Red Planet&quot; may also be another incarnation of Lazarus Long: &quot;McRae&#x27;s [sic] actions and description, combined with Lazarus Long&#x27;s brief discussions of his early history in &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot; and &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, would seem to say so. There is no conclusive evidence one way or another. But the pieces fit together rather well, and Heinlein must have had some reason for including the anomalous and cryptic reference to McRae&#x27;s [sic] recall of events that apparently predate his birth.&quot;

== &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot; ==
When the character of Lazarus Long is introduced in &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot;, he is 213 years old, and the breeding experiment that created the Howard Families has proven to be a success, with most &quot;Howards&quot; enjoying a lifespan of approximately 150 years and changing identities periodically to conceal their long lifespans. Ten percent of them have elected to end &quot;The Masquerade&quot; and live publicly, with the approval of the Howard Foundation, but this process has backfired.

The general public of Earth, once exposed to the Howards&#x27; lifespan, believes incorrectly that the Howards have discovered an anti-aging process that they are choosing to conceal, and come to resent them. Civil liberties applied to the Howards are suspended and, with the exception of Lazarus, the entire membership of the Howard Families is detained.

With the aid of the elected head of the world government, Slayton Ford, Lazarus hijacks the &quot;New Frontiers&quot;, a starship designed to travel to distant stars, and liberates the Howards. While the &quot;New Frontiers&quot; was designed to sustain a colony in travel at speeds significantly below the speed of light, a Howard named Andrew Jackson &quot;Slipstick&quot; Libby increases the ship&#x27;s top speed to nearly the speed of light. With the ship thus modified, the Howard Families, under the leadership of Lazarus Long, escape the Solar System in search of a planet of their own.

The first planet they encounter is populated by the Jockaira, an intelligent species that has been domesticated for another, unnamed and undescribed, species, whom they worship as gods. When the latter discover that the humans cannot be domesticated, all of the humans are forcibly removed from the planet and placed in their ship, which is then transferred to another star system and planet by means of technology sufficiently advanced that it is not observable by the humans.

This second planet is populated by a diminutive furry species called the &quot;Little People&quot;, who are a very advanced collective intelligence. They are very accommodating to the humans. In fact, their world is pleasant enough to be considered a paradise. After many years, Mary Sperling — a close friend of Lazarus and the second-oldest of the Howard Families — joins the collective intelligence in order to escape thanatophobia, whereupon Lazarus and many other Howards return to Earth. Approximately twelve thousand remain behind.

Upon return to Earth, the Howards learn that a rejuvenation treatment has been developed to approximate the secret of longevity supposedly held by them, thus permitting Lazarus, who has grown old, to regain his youth.

Note that Heinlein&#x27;s basic concept in Methuselah&#x27;s Children bears some similarities to George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Back to Methuselah&quot;, which Heinlein had mentioned having read.

== &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; ==
At the beginning of this book, Lazarus has grown weary of life and decides to die. He returns to Secundus, where a standing order is in place to notify the Chairman Pro Tempore of the Howard Families if he came on world. He is located and, without his consent, subjected to rejuvenation at the behest of his descendant Ira Weatheral, Chairman &quot;Pro Tempore&quot; of the Howard Families, who believes that the society and culture of Secundus are in death throes, and wishes to lead the Families to a new planet named Tertius, having had Lazarus advise him in doing so. Lazarus later agrees, promising to commit suicide if Ira does not meet his demands, and in exchange, Ira orders a search to find Lazarus a new amusement. This search, using a &quot;Zwicky box&quot;, is performed by an artificial intelligence named Minerva, who handles most of the computerized functions of the planetary government, is in love with Ira, and becomes friends with Lazarus. Meanwhile, the latter&#x27;s rejuvenator, named Ishtar, and Ira&#x27;s daughter, named Hamadryad, both give birth to female clones of him, their Y chromosome being replaced by an identical copy of the X chromosome, producing &quot;daughters&quot; named Lapis Lazuli and Lorelei Lee. Lazarus&#x27; advice to Ira appears alternately as proverbs and as stories.

Lazarus assists Ira in the migration to Tertius, settles the latter, and attempts a trans-temporal journey to Earth, around 1919–1929, but mistakenly arrives in 1916, there to insinuate himself into his parents&#x27; family under the name of &quot;Ted Bronson&quot;, whom his grandfather Ira suspects to be an illegitimate nephew or son of his own. Lazarus also discovers, to his surprise and (initial) shame, a sexual desire of his own mother, Maureen. When his family learns that he has no plans to join the army in World War I, they spurn him, prompting him to enlist. His genetic father, Brian Smith, an officer, makes arrangements for him to go overseas, thinking that he is doing &quot;Ted&quot; a favor.

Before deployment, Lazarus again visits his family, whereupon he learns that Maureen is as attracted to him as he is to her. She explains that her husband does not insist on fidelity, although she is careful not to become pregnant by any man but Brian, and being newly pregnant, consummates her attraction to Lazarus. Overseas, Lazarus is seriously wounded in combat, but is rescued by his Tertian household.

== Other novels ==
In &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, the main characters discover a way to travel to fictional worlds, and in the course of their explorations, visit the world of Lazarus Long. Using the technology of these characters&#x27; ship (which can travel through space and time), Lazarus snatches his mother out of the time stream at the end of her life and replaces her with a dead clone.

In &quot;The Pursuit of the Pankera&quot;, which is a parallel novel of &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, Lazarus is mentioned by the name &quot;Doc Lafe Hubert&quot; (a known alternate name for Lazarus), who claims to have &quot;delivered over twelve thousand babies[,] about fifty of them his own&quot;, and later in the book: &quot;After this ruckus, Maureen wants your family to visit ours.&quot;

Lazarus also appears as a minor character in &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot; and plays a role in Heinlein&#x27;s last novel, &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot;, which is the life story of Maureen. In the former novel, Lazarus is revealed at the end of the novel as the father of protagonist Colin &quot;Richard Ames&quot; Campbell, whereas in the latter novel, Maureen as narrator tells a somewhat different version of Lazarus&#x27; visit to Earth in 1916–1918, details that information about the future received from Lazarus was crucial to the Howard Foundation&#x27;s survival of the Great Depression, and reveals that Lazarus (as Woodrow &quot;Bill&quot; Smith) was the backup pilot of the first lunar expedition.

<text>Chad refers to fragments sometimes created when holes are made in a paper, card or similar synthetic materials, such as computer punched tape or punched cards. The word &quot;chad&quot; has been used both as a mass noun (as in &quot;a pile of chad&quot;) and as a countable noun (pluralizing as in &quot;many chads&quot;).

== Etymology ==
The origin of the term chad is uncertain. Patent documents from the 1930s and 1940s show the word &quot;chad&quot;, often in reference to punched tape used in telegraphy. These patents sometimes include synonyms such as &quot;chaff&quot; and &quot;chips&quot;. A patent filing in 1930 included a &quot;receptacle or &quot;chad box&quot; ... to receive the chips cut from the edge of the tape.&quot; A 1938 patent filing included a &quot;chaff or &quot;chad chute&quot;&quot; to collect the waste fragments. Both patents were assigned to Teletype Corporation.

The plural &quot;chads&quot; is attested from about 1939, along with &quot;chadless&quot;, meaning &quot;without [loose] chad&quot;. Clear definitions for both terms are offered by Walter Bacon in a patent application filed in 1940 assigned to Bell Telephone Laboratories: &quot;... In making these perforations, the perforator cuts small round pieces of paper, known in the art as &quot;chads&quot;, out of the tape. These &quot;chads&quot; are objectionable ... &quot;Chadless&quot; tape is prepared by feeding blank tape through a device which will not punch a complete circle in the tape but, instead, will only cut approximately three-quarters of the circumference of a circle ... thereby leaving a movable, or hinged, lid of paper in the tape.&quot;

In the &quot;New Hacker&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, two unattributed and likely humorous derivations for &quot;chad&quot; are offered, a back-formation from a personal name &quot;Chadless&quot; and an acronym for &quot;Card Hole Aggregate Debris&quot;. Other etymologies claim derivation from the Scottish name for river gravel, &quot;chad&quot;, or the British slang for louse, &quot;chat&quot;.

==Partially punched chad==
When a chad is not fully detached, it is described by various terms corresponding to the level of modification from the unpunched state. The distinctions are of importance in counting cards used in voting. The following terms are sometimes used when describing a four-cornered chad:

*Hanging chads are attached to the ballot at only one corner.
*Swinging chads are attached to the ballot at two corners.
*Tri-chads are attached to the ballot at three corners.
*Dimpled chads are attached to the ballot at all four corners, but bear an indentation indicating the voter may have intended to mark the ballot. (Sometimes &quot;pregnant&quot; is used to indicate a greater mark than &quot;dimpled&quot;.)

==2000 United States presidential election controversy==
In the 2000 United States presidential election in Florida, many of the state&#x27;s counties used Votomatic-style punched card ballots where incompletely punched holes resulted in partially punched chads: either a &quot;hanging chad&quot;, where one or more corners were still attached, or a &quot;fat chad&quot; or &quot;pregnant chad&quot;, where all corners were still attached, but an indentation appears to have been made. These votes were not counted by the tabulating machines. The aftermath of the controversy (&quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;) caused the rapid discontinuance of punch card ballots in the United States.

<doc id="83482" wikidata="Q48672" url="?curid=83482" title="Mother of vinegar">
<text>Mother of vinegar is a biofilm composed of a form of cellulose, yeast, and bacteria that sometimes develops on fermenting alcoholic liquids during the process that turns alcohol into acetic acid with the help of oxygen from the air and acetic acid bacteria (AAB). It is similar to the symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY) mostly known from production of kombucha, but develops to a much lesser extent due to lesser availability of yeast, which is often no longer present in wine/cider at this stage, and a different population of bacteria. Mother of vinegar is often added to wine, cider, or other alcoholic liquids to produce vinegar at home, although only the bacteria is required, but historically has also been used in large scale production.

== Discovery ==
Hermann Boerhaave was one of the first scientists to study vinegar. In the early 1700s, he showed the importance of the mother of vinegar in the acetification process, and how having an increased oxidation surface allowed for better vinegar production. He called the mother a &quot;vegetal substance&quot; or &quot;flower.&quot;

In 1822, South African botanist, Christian Hendrik Persoon named the mother of vinegar &quot;Mycoderma,&quot; which he believed was a fungus&quot;.&quot; He attributed the vinegar production to the &quot;Mycoderma&quot;, since it formed on the surface of wine when it has been left open to air.

In 1861, Louis Pasteur made the conclusion that vinegar is made by a &quot;plant&quot; that belonged to the group &quot;Mycoderma,&quot; and not made purely by chemical oxidation of ethanol. He named the plant &quot;Mycoderma aceti.&quot; Mycoderma aceti, is a Neo-Latin expression, from the Greek μύκης (&quot;fungus&quot;) plus δέρμα (&quot;skin&quot;), and the Latin &quot;aceti&quot; (&quot;of the acid&quot;).

Martinus Willem Beijerinck, who was a founder of modern microbiology, identified acetic acid bacteria in the mother of vinegar. He named the bacteria &quot;Acetobacter aceti&quot; in 1898. In 1935, Toshinobu Asai, a Japanese microbiologst, discovered a new genus of bacteria in the mother of vinegar, &quot;Gluconobacter&quot;. After this discovery, 12 genera and 59 species of bacteria were found to compose the AAB found in mother of vinegar.

== Description ==

Mother of Vinegar forms a grayish veil which can be fine or more solid depending on the conditions. The veil forms in conditions that include nutrients like proteins that are found in wine, limited acidity, and ideal concentrations of alcohol.

=== Bacteria ===
The veil is nontoxic and is composed of cellulose and AAB. The raw materials and other manufacturing features determine what genus the bacteria that composes the AAB is from. PCR fingerprinting revealed that &quot;Acetobacter&quot; genus was the most abundant in mother of vinegar resulting from apples, while &quot;Komagataeibacter&quot; genus was most dominant in mother of vinegar resulting from grapes. Mother of vinegar from apples had &quot;A. okinawenis&quot; as the most abundant species of bacteria. Grape vinegar and the mother had &quot;K. europaeus&quot; as the most dominant bacterial species.

There are also many other bacterial genera that are in mother of vinegar. Polymerase Chain Reaction Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) was used to detect the bacterial components and genera in vinegar. These groups include: &quot;Acetobacter, Acidomonas, Ameyamaea, Asaia, Gluconacetobacter, Gluconobacter, Granulibacter, Komagataeibacter, Kozakia, Neoasaia, Saccharibacter, Swaminathania, and Tanticharoenia.&quot; These bacteria are normally gram-negative or gram-variable and have polar flagella. They also need an aerobic environment to grow and prefer an environment with a pH of 5-6.5 but can survive in pH of 3-4. They are non-spore forming bacteria. These bacteria are difficult to find in spontaneous fermentation. This is because they are in competition with other microbial groups during the time the mother of vinegar is in the viable but not culturable (VBNC) state.  The genera, &quot;Gluconacetobacter&quot; and &quot;Komagataeibacter&quot; produce high levels of bacterial cellulose, which is what mother of vinegar is composed of.

The amount of &quot;Gluconacetobacter&quot; and &quot;Acetobacter&quot; in the mother of vinegar is associated with the concentration of acetic acid in the vinegar. Vinegars with a concentration of acetic acid greater than 6% contained more &quot;Gluconacetobacter&quot;, while those with a concentration of less than 6% typically see &quot;Acetobacter&quot; present. However, on an industrial scale, &quot;Acetobacter&quot; was seen in acetic acid concentrations of 11.5-12%.

Lactic acid bacteria are also present in mother of vinegar to aid in the breakdown of carbohydrates in the alcohol fermentation process. Lactic acid bacteria create lactic acid, which results in a pH decrease in the final vinegar product. In Shanxi aged vinegar, there were 7 species of 3 different bacterial genera present in its mother of vinegar. These species include, &quot;Limosilactobacillus fermentum&quot; (formerly &quot;Lactobacillus fermentum&quot;), &quot;Weissella confusa&quot;, &quot;Lentilactobacillus buchneri&quot; (aka &quot;Lactobacillus buchneri&quot;), &quot;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&quot; (aka &quot;Lactobacillus plantarum&quot;), &quot;Lacticaseibacillus casei&quot; (formerly &quot;Lactobacillus casei&quot;), &quot;Pediococcus acidilactici&quot;, and &quot;P. pentosaceus.&quot; These bacteria are all gram-positive, long rod-shaped, or elliptical shaped. There were very few cocci shaped bacteria present.

=== Yeast ===
Mother of vinegar is also composed of yeasts that ferment the sugars in the wine, cider, or other alcoholic liquids into ethanol. In the making of Shanxi mature vinegar, the &quot;Daqu&quot; alcoholic fermentation starter mainly includes &quot;S. cerevisae&quot;, &quot;P. anomala&quot;, and &quot;Candida&quot; spp. As fermentation proceeds, &quot;S. cerevisae&quot; quickly becomes dominant for its tolerance to ethanol. Hence the acetic acid fermentation starts with relative few species of yeasts, mainly &quot;S. cerevisae&quot;. (The actual mother of vinegar used in the making of Shanxi mature vinegar, &quot;Pei&quot;, is not analyzed in this study.)

== Applications ==
Mother of vinegar is used as an aid in the production of vinegar. There are some drawbacks. If the mother of vinegar does not penetrate the mass of the vinegar, then it disrupts the vinegar making process. This is because the mycoderms consume the oxygen in the wine, breaking it down. Having a thick layer of mother of vinegar can also destroy the odorant compounds in vinegar. A way to avoid these side effects is to only use the surface veil of mother of vinegar.

Vinegar can be made on a mass scale. A system that utilizes mother of vinegar is called Orleans or French. It was named this since many wines were sold to vinegar brewers at Orleans, which is a port on the Loire, in France. The system grows mother of vinegar on a big surface. The mother is fed with organic liquids that are rich in phosphates and nitrogen. The mother is then placed on top of the wine in big shallow vats. The vat is then covered with another vat or just a cover. The mother acetifies the wine into vinegar.

Mother of vinegar is also used in the traditional production of balsamic vinegar. Balsamic vinegar is created by cooking down grape juice to create a concentrate. The concentrate is poured into a demijohn and is left to sit throughout the winter. In the spring, the concentrate is transferred to a wooden barrel. By summer, mother of vinegar is used to start the vinegar fermentation. The concentrate and mother are then separated into different barrels of varying wood types. The vinegar is created over the course of 13 years.

Mother of vinegar can also form in store-bought vinegar if there is some residual sugar, leftover yeast and bacteria and/or alcohol contained in the vinegar. This is more common in unpasteurized vinegar, since the pasteurization might not stabilize the process completely. While not necessarily appetizing in appearance, mother of vinegar is completely harmless and the surrounding vinegar does not have to be discarded because of it. It can be filtered out using a coffee filter, used to start a bottle of vinegar, or simply ignored.

== Mother of kombucha ==
Mother of vinegar and mother of kombucha share many similarities, but they are different. Kombucha mother is created from the fermentation of tea, while mother of vinegar is created from the fermentation of wine, cider, or other alcoholic beverages. The fermentation process of tea creates SCOBY. The SCOBY creates a bacterial cellulose film, like that seen in mother of vinegar. The bacteria also oxidizes the alcohol to create acetic acid. The main bacterial genus involved in the mother of kombucha is &quot;Acetobacter&quot;, which is also a main genus in mother of vinegar. Kombucha mother also has the bacteria genus &quot;Gluconobacter&quot;, which is found in some vinegar types. Both vinegar and kombucha mothers contain yeast, which ferments sugars to ethanol. After the fermentation process, the AAB oxidizes the ethanol into acetic acid.

The main difference between mother of vinegar and mother of kombucha is the acetic acid tolerance. Vinegar has a higher acetic acid concentration than kombucha, therefore the species in mother of vinegar needs to tolerate higher levels of acetic acid. Due to the differences in the compositions of the mothers, mother of vinegar cannot be used to produce kombucha due to it not being derived from tea and its bacteria having different characteristics.

<text>Asceticism is a lifestyle characterized by abstinence from worldly pleasures, often for the purpose of pursuing spiritual goals. Ascetics may withdraw from the world for their practices or continue to be part of their society, but typically adopt a frugal lifestyle, characterised by the renunciation of material possessions and physical pleasures, and also spend time fasting while concentrating on the practice of religion, prayer, or meditation. Some individuals have also attempted an ascetic lifestyle to free themselves from addictions to things such as alcohol, tobacco, drugs, entertainment, sex, food, etc.

Asceticism has been historically observed in many religious and philosophic traditions, most notably among Ancient Greek philosophical schools (Epicureanism, Gymnosophism, Stoicism, and Pythagoreanism), Indian religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism), Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Judaism, Islam), and contemporary practices continue amongst some of their followers. Practitioners abandon sensual pleasures and lead an abstinent lifestyle, in the pursuit of redemption, salvation, and/or spirituality. Many ascetics believe the action of purifying the body helps to purify the soul, and that in doing so, they will obtain a greater connection with the Divine or find inner peace. This may take the form of rituals, the renunciation of pleasure, and/or self-mortification.

However, ascetics maintain that self-imposed constraints bring them greater freedom in various areas of their lives, such as increased clarity of thought and the ability to resist potentially destructive temptations. Asceticism is seen in some ancient theologies as a journey towards spiritual transformation, where the simple is sufficient, the bliss is within, the frugal is plenty. Inversely, several ancient religious traditions, such as Zoroastrianism, Ancient Egyptian religion, the Dionysian Mysteries, and &quot;vāmācāra&quot;, abstain from ascetic practices and focus on various types of good deeds in the world and the importance of family life.

==Etymology and meaning==
The adjective &quot;ascetic&quot; derives from the ancient Greek term , which means &quot;training&quot; or &quot;exercise&quot;. The original usage did not refer to self-denial, but to the physical training required for athletic events. Its usage later extended to rigorous practices used in many major religious traditions, in varying degrees, to attain redemption and higher spirituality.

Dom Cuthbert Butler classified asceticism into natural and unnatural forms:

* &quot;Natural asceticism&quot; involves a lifestyle which reduces material aspects of life to the utmost simplicity and to a minimum. This may include minimal, simple clothing, sleeping on a floor or in caves, and eating a simple, minimal amount of food. Natural asceticism, state Wimbush and Valantasis, does not include maiming the body or harsher austerities that make the body suffer.
* &quot;Unnatural asceticism&quot;, in contrast, covers practices that go further, and involves body mortification, punishing one&#x27;s own flesh, and habitual self-infliction of pain, such as by sleeping on a bed of nails.

==Religion==
Self-discipline and abstinence in some form and degree are parts of religious practice within many religious and spiritual traditions. Ascetic lifestyle is associated particularly with monks, nuns, and fakirs in Abrahamic religions, and bhikkhus, munis, sannyasis, vairagis, goswamis, and yogis in Indian religions.

===Abrahamic religions===
====Bahá&#x27;í Faith====
In the Baháʼí Faith, according to Shoghi Effendi, the maintenance of a high standard of moral conduct is neither to be associated or confused with any form of extreme asceticism, nor of excessive and bigoted puritanism. The religious standard set by Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, founder of the Baháʼí Faith, seeks under no circumstances to deny anyone the legitimate right and privilege to derive the fullest advantage and benefit from the manifold joys, beauties, and pleasures with which the world has been so plentifully enriched by God, which Baháʼís regard as an all-loving creator.

====Christianity====


Notable Christian authors of Late Antiquity such as Origen, St Jerome, John Chrysostom, and Augustine of Hippo, interpreted meanings of the Biblical texts within a highly asceticized religious environment. Scriptural examples of asceticism could be found in the lives of John the Baptist, Jesus Christ, the twelve apostles, and Paul the Apostle. The Dead Sea Scrolls revealed ascetic practices of the ancient Jewish sect of Essenes who took vows of abstinence to prepare for a holy war. An emphasis on an ascetic religious life was evident in both early Christian writings (&quot;see&quot;: Philokalia) and practices (&quot;see&quot;: Hesychasm). Other Christian practitioners of asceticism include saints such as Paul the Hermit, Simeon Stylites, David of Wales, John of Damascus, Peter Waldo, Tamar of Georgia, and Francis of Assisi.

According to Richard Finn, much of early Christian asceticism has been traced to Judaism, but not to traditions within Greek asceticism. Some of the ascetic thoughts in Christianity nevertheless, Finn states, have roots in Greek moral thought. Virtuous living is not possible when an individual is craving bodily pleasures with desire and passion. Morality is not seen in the ancient theology as a balancing act between right and wrong, but a form of spiritual transformation, where the simple is sufficient, the bliss is within, the frugal is plenty.

The deserts of the Middle East were at one time inhabited by thousands of male and female Christian ascetics, hermits and anchorites, including St. Anthony the Great (otherwise known as St. Anthony of the Desert), St. Mary of Egypt, and St. Simeon Stylites, collectively known as the Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers. In 963 an association of monasteries called &quot;Lavra&quot; was formed on Mount Athos, in Eastern Orthodox tradition. This became the most important center of orthodox Christian ascetic groups in the centuries that followed. In the modern era, Mount Athos and Meteora have remained a significant center.

Sexual abstinence such as those of the Encratites sect of Christians was only one aspect of ascetic renunciation, and both natural and unnatural asceticism have been part of Christian asceticism. The natural ascetic practices have included simple living, begging, fasting and ethical practices such as humility, compassion, meditation, patience and prayer. Evidence of extreme asceticism in Christianity appear in second century texts and thereafter, in both Eastern &amp; Western Christian traditions, such as the practice of chaining the body to rocks, eating only grass, praying seated on a pillar in the elements for decades such as by the monk Simeon Stylites, solitary confinement inside a cell, abandoning personal hygiene and adopting lifestyle of a beast, self-inflicted pain and voluntary suffering, however they were often rejected as beyond measure by other ascetics such as Barsanuphius of Gaza and John the Prophet. Ascetic practices were linked to the Christian concepts of sin and redemption.

The Proto-Protestant Waldensian sect originated as an ascetic group within medieval Western Christianity, persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church.

=====Evagrius Ponticus: monastic teaching=====

Evagrius Ponticus, also called Evagrius the Solitary (345–399 CE), was a highly educated monastic teacher who produced a large theological body of work, mainly ascetic, including the &quot;Gnostikos&quot; (, &quot;gnōstikos&quot;, &quot;learned&quot;, from γνῶσις, &quot;gnōsis&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot;), also known as &quot;The Gnostic: To the One Made Worthy of Gnosis&quot;. The &quot;Gnostikos&quot; is the second volume of a trilogy containing the &quot;Praktikos&quot;, intended for young monks to achieve &quot;apatheia&quot;, i.e., &quot;a state of calm which is the prerequisite for love and knowledge&quot;, in order to purify their intellect and make it impassible, to reveal the truth hidden in every being. The third book, &quot;Kephalaia Gnostika&quot;, was meant for meditation by advanced monks. Those writings made him one of the most recognized ascetic teachers and scriptural interpreters of his time, which include Clement of Alexandria and Origen.

The ascetic literature of early Christianity was influenced by pre-Christian Greek philosophical traditions, especially Plato and Aristotle, looking for the perfect spiritual way of life. According to Clement of Alexandria, philosophy and Scriptures can be seen as &quot;double expressions of one pattern of knowledge&quot;. According to Evagrius, &quot;body and the soul are there to help the intellect and not to hinder it&quot;.

====Islam====


The Arabic term for &quot;asceticism&quot; is &quot;zuhd&quot;. The Islamic prophet Muhammad and his followers practiced asceticism. However, contemporary mainstream Islam has not had a tradition of asceticism, but its Sufi groups have cherished their own ascetic tradition for several centuries. Islamic literary sources and historians report that during the early Muslim conquests of the Middle East and North Africa (7th–10th centuries), some of the Muslim warriors guarding the frontier settlements were also ascetics; numerous historical accounts also report of some Christian monks that apostatized from Christianity, converted to Islam, and joined the &quot;jihad&quot;, as well as of several Muslim warriors that repudiated Islam, converted to Christianity, and became Christian monks. Monasticism is forbidden in Islam. Scholars in the field of Islamic studies have argued that asceticism (&quot;zuhd&quot;) served as a precursor to the later doctrinal formations of Sufis that began to emerge in the tenth century through the works of individuals such as al-Junayd, al-Qushayrī, al-Sarrāj, al-Hujwīrī and others.

Sufism emerged and grew as a mystical, somewhat hidden tradition in the mainstream Sunni and Shia denominations of Islam, state Eric Hanson and Karen Armstrong, likely in reaction to &quot;the growing worldliness of Umayyad and Abbasid societies&quot;. Acceptance of asceticism emerged in Sufism slowly because it was contrary to the &quot;sunnah&quot;, states Nile Green, and early Sufis condemned &quot;ascetic practices as unnecessary public displays of what amounted to false piety&quot;. The ascetic Sufis were hunted and persecuted both by Sunni and Shia rulers, in various centuries. Sufis were highly influential and greatly successful in spreading Islam between the 10th and 19th centuries, particularly to the furthest outposts of the Muslim world in the Middle East and North Africa, the Balkans and Caucasus, the Indian subcontinent, and finally Central, Eastern, and Southeast Asia. Some scholars have argued that Sufi Muslim ascetics and mystics played a decisive role in converting the Turkic peoples to Islam between the 10th and 12th centuries and Mongol invaders in Persia during the 13th and 14th centuries, mainly because of the similarities between the extreme, ascetic Sufis (fakirs and dervishes) and the Shamans of the traditional Turco-Mongol religion.

Sufism was adopted and then grew particularly in the frontier areas of Islamic states, where the asceticism of its fakirs and dervishes appealed to populations already used to the monastic traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, and medieval Christianity. Ascetic practices of Sufi fakirs have included celibacy, fasting, and self-mortification. Sufi ascetics also participated in mobilizing Muslim warriors for holy wars, helping travelers, dispensing blessings through their perceived magical powers, and in helping settle disputes. Ritual ascetic practices, such as self-flagellation (&quot;Tatbir&quot;), have been practiced by Shia Muslims annually at the Mourning of Muharram.

====Judaism====


Asceticism has not been a dominant theme within Judaism, but minor to significant ascetic traditions have been a part of Jewish spirituality. The history of Jewish asceticism is traceable to first millennium BCE era with the references of the Nazirite (or Nazorean, Nazarene, Naziruta, Nazir), whose rules of practice are found in Book of Numbers 6:1–21. The ascetic practices included not cutting the hair, abstaining from eating meat or grapes, abstention from wine, or fasting and hermit style living conditions for a period of time. Literary evidence suggests that this tradition continued for a long time, well into the common era, and both Jewish men and women could follow the ascetic path, with examples such as the ascetic practices for fourteen years by Queen Helena of Adiabene, and by Miriam of Tadmor. After the Jews returned from the Babylonian exile and the Mosaic institution was done away with, a different form of asceticism arose when Antiochus IV Epiphanes threatened the Jewish religion in 167 BCE. The Essene tradition of the second Temple period is described as one of the movements within historic Jewish asceticism between second century BCE and first century CE.

Ascetic Jewish sects existed in ancient and medieval era times, most notably the Essenes. According to Allan Nadler, two most significant examples of medieval Jewish asceticism have been Havoth ha-Levavoth and Hasidei Ashkenaz. Pious self-deprivation was a part of the dualism and mysticism in these ascetic groups. This voluntary separation from the world was called &quot;Perishuth&quot;, and the Jewish society widely accepted this tradition in late medieval era. Extreme forms of ascetic practices have been opposed or controversial in the Hasidic movement.

The Ashkenazi Hasidim () were a Jewish mystical, ascetic movement in the German Rhineland whose practices are documented in the texts of the 12th and 13th centuries. Peter Meister states that this Jewish asceticism emerged in the tenth century, grew much wider with prevalence in southern Europe and the Middle East through the Jewish pietistic movement. According to Shimon Shokek, these ascetic practices were the result of an influence of medieval Christianity on Ashkenazi Hasidism. The Jewish faithful of this Hasidic tradition practiced the punishment of body, self-torture by starvation, sitting in the open in freezing snow, or in the sun with fleas in summer, all with the goal of purifying the soul and turning one&#x27;s attention away from the body unto the soul.

Another significant school of Jewish asceticism appeared in the 16th century led from Safed. These mystics engaged in radical material abstentions and self-mortification with the belief that this helps them transcend the created material world, reach and exist in the mystical spiritual world. A studied example of this group was Hayyim ben Joseph Vital, and their rules of ascetic lifestyle (&quot;Hanhagoth&quot;) are documented.

===Indian religions===

Asceticism is found in both non-theistic and theistic traditions within Indian religions. The origins of the practice are ancient, and a heritage shared by the major Indian religions: Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism. They are referred by many names such as Sadhu, Pravrajita, Bhikshu, Yati etc.

Asceticism in Indian religions includes a spectrum of diverse practices, ranging from the mild self-discipline, self-imposed poverty and simple living typical of Buddhism and Hinduism, to more severe austerities and self-mortification practices of monks in Jainism and now extinct Ajivikas in the pursuit of salvation. Some ascetics live as hermits relying on whatever food they can find in the forests, then sleep and meditate in caves; others travel from one holy site to another while sustaining their body by begging for food; yet others live in monasteries as monks or nuns. Some ascetics live like priests and preachers, other ascetics are armed and militant, to resist any persecution—a phenomenon that emerged after the arrival of Islam in India. Self-torture is relatively uncommon practice but one that attracts public attention. In Indian traditions such as Buddhism and Hinduism, self-mortification is typically criticized. However, Indian mythologies also describe numerous ascetic gods or demons who pursued harsh austerities for decades or centuries that helped each gain special powers.

====Buddhism====

The historical Siddhartha Gautama adopted an extreme ascetic life in search of enlightenment. However, after enlightenment he rejected extreme asceticism in favor of a more moderated version, the &quot;Middle Way.&quot;

According to Hajime Nakamura and other scholars, some early Buddhist texts suggest that asceticism was a part of Buddhist practice in its early days. Further, in practice, records from about the start of the common era through the 19th century suggest that asceticism has been a part of Buddhism, both in Theravada and Mahayana traditions.

=====Theravada=====
Textual evidence suggests that ascetic practices were a part of the Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka by the third century BC, and this tradition continued through the medieval era in parallel to &quot;sangha&quot; style monastic tradition.

In the Theravada tradition of Thailand, medieval texts report of ascetic monks who wander and dwell in the forest or crematory alone, do austere practices, and these came to be known as . Ascetic Buddhist monks have been and continue to be found in Myanmar, and as in Thailand, they are known to pursue their own version of Buddhism, resisting the hierarchical institutionalized structure of monasteries in Buddhism.

=====Mahayana=====
In the Mahayana tradition asceticism with esoteric and mystical meanings became an accepted practice, such as in the Tendai and Shingon schools of Japanese Buddhism. These Japanese practices included penance, austerities, ablutions under a waterfall, and rituals to purify oneself. Japanese records from the 12th century record stories of monks undertaking severe asceticism, while records suggest that 19th century Nichiren Buddhist monks woke up at midnight or 2:00 am daily, and performed ascetic water purification rituals under cold waterfalls. Other practices include the extreme ascetic practices of eating only pine needles, resins, seeds and ultimately self-mummification, while alive, or &quot;Sokushinbutsu&quot; (&quot;miira&quot;) in Japan.

In Chinese Buddhism self-mummification ascetic practices were less common but recorded in the &quot;Ch&#x27;an&quot; (Zen Buddhism) tradition there. More ancient Chinese Buddhist asceticism, somewhat similar to &quot;Sokushinbutsu&quot; are also known, such as the public self-immolation (self-cremation, as shaoshen 燒身 or zifen 自焚) practice, aimed at abandoning the impermanent body. The earliest-documented ascetic Buddhist monk biography is of Fayu (法羽) in 396 CE, followed by more than fifty documented cases in the centuries that followed including that of monk Daodu (道度). This was considered as evidence of a renunciant bodhisattva, and may have been inspired by the Jataka tales wherein the Buddha in his earlier lives immolates himself to assist other living beings, or by the Bhaiṣajyaguruvaiḍūryaprabhārāja-related teachings in the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;. Historical records suggest that the self-immolation practices were observed by nuns in Chinese Buddhism as well.

The Chinese Buddhist asceticism practices, states James Benn, were not an adaptation or import of Indian ascetic practices, but an invention of Chinese Buddhists, based on their unique interpretations of &quot;Saddharmapuṇḍarīka&quot; or &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;. It may be an adoption of more ancient pre-Buddhist Chinese practices, or from Taoism. It is unclear if self-immolation was limited primarily to Chinese asceticism tradition, and strong evidence of it being a part of a large scale, comprehensive ascetic program among Chinese Buddhists is lacking.

====Hinduism====

Renunciation from the worldly life, and a pursuit of spiritual life either as a part of monastic community or a hermit, has been a historic tradition of Hinduism since ancient times. The renunciation tradition is called Sannyasa, and this is not the same as asceticism—which typically connotes severe self-denial and self-mortification. &quot;Sannyasa&quot; often involved a simple life, one with minimal or no material possessions, study, meditation and ethical living. Those who undertook this lifestyle were called &quot;Sannyasi&quot;, &quot;Sadhu&quot;, &quot;Yati&quot;, &quot;Bhiksu&quot;, &quot;Pravrajita/Pravrajitā&quot; and Parivrajaka in Hindu texts. The term with a meaning closer to asceticism in Hindu texts is Tapas, but it too spans a spectrum of meanings ranging from inner heat, to self-mortification and penance with austerities, to meditation and self-discipline.

The 11th century literary work &quot;Yatidharmasamuccaya&quot; is a Vaishnava text that summarizes ascetic practices in Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism. In Hindu traditions, as with other Indian religions, both men and women have historically participated in a diverse spectrum of ascetic practices.

===== Vedas and Upanishads =====
Asceticism-like practices are hinted in the Vedas, but these hymns have been variously interpreted as referring to early Yogis and loner renouncers. One such mention is in the Kesin hymn of the Rigveda, where Keśins (&quot;long-haired&quot; ascetics) and Munis (&quot;silent ones&quot;) are described. These Kesins of the Vedic era, are described as follows by Karel Werner:

The Vedic and Upanishadic texts of Hinduism, states Mariasusai Dhavamony, do not discuss self-inflicted pain, but do discuss self-restraint and self-control. The monastic tradition of Hinduism is evidenced in first millennium BCE, particularly in its Advaita Vedanta tradition. This is evidenced by the oldest Sannyasa Upanishads, because all of them have a strong Advaita Vedanta outlook. Most of the Sannyasa Upanishads present a Yoga and nondualism (Advaita) Vedanta philosophy. The 12th-century &quot;Shatyayaniya Upanishad&quot; is a significant exception, which presents qualified dualistic and Vaishnavism (Vishishtadvaita Vedanta) philosophy. These texts mention a simple, ethical lifestyle but do not mention self-torture or body mortification. For example:

Similarly, the Nirvana Upanishad asserts that the Hindu ascetic should hold, according to Patrick Olivelle, that &quot;the sky is his belief, his knowledge is of the absolute, union is his initiation, compassion alone is his pastime, bliss is his garland, the cave of solitude is his fellowship&quot;, and so on, as he proceeds in his effort to gain self-knowledge (or soul-knowledge) and its identity with the Hindu metaphysical concept of Brahman. Other behavioral characteristics of the &quot;Sannyasi&quot; include: ahimsa (non-violence), akrodha (not become angry even if you are abused by others), disarmament (no weapons), chastity, bachelorhood (no marriage), avyati (non-desirous), amati (poverty), self-restraint, truthfulness, sarvabhutahita (kindness to all creatures), asteya (non-stealing), aparigraha (non-acceptance of gifts, non-possessiveness) and shaucha (purity of body speech and mind).

===== Bhagavad Gita =====
In the Bhagavad Gita, verse 17.5 criticize a form of asceticism that diverges from scriptural guidance and is driven by pride, ego, or attachment, rather than for genuine spiritual growth. Verse 17.6 extends the criticism of such ascetic practices, noting that they are considered harmful to both the practitioner&#x27;s body and the divine within. With these two verses, Krishna emphasizes that true ascetic practices should align with scriptural teachings and aim towards higher spiritual goals.

====Jainism====

Asceticism in one of its most intense forms can be found in Jainism. Ascetic life may include nakedness symbolizing non-possession of even clothes, fasting, body mortification, penance and other austerities, in order to burn away past karma and stop producing new karma, both of which are believed in Jainism to be essential for reaching &quot;siddha&quot; and &quot;moksha&quot; (liberation from rebirths, salvation). In Jainism, the ultimate goal of life is to achieve the liberation of soul from endless cycle of rebirths (moksha from samsara), which requires ethical living and asceticism. Most of the austerities and ascetic practices can be traced back to Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara who practiced 12 years of asceticism before reaching enlightenment.

Jain texts such as &quot;Tattvartha Sutra&quot; and &quot;Uttaradhyayana Sutra&quot; discuss ascetic austerities to great lengths and formulations. Six outer and six inner practices are most common, and oft repeated in later Jain texts. According to John Cort, outer austerities include complete fasting, eating limited amounts, eating restricted items, abstaining from tasty foods, mortifying the flesh and guarding the flesh (avoiding anything that is a source of temptation). Inner austerities include expiation, confession, respecting and assisting mendicants, studying, meditation and ignoring bodily wants in order to abandon the body.

The Jain text of &quot;Kalpa Sūtra&quot; describes Mahavira&#x27;s asceticism in detail, whose life is a source of guidance on most of the ascetic practices in Jainism:

Both Mahavira and his ancient Jaina followers are described in Jainism texts as practicing body mortification and being abused by animals as well as people, but never retaliating and never initiating harm or injury (ahimsa) to any other being. With such ascetic practices, he burnt off his past Karma, gained spiritual knowledge, and became a Jina. These austere practices are part of the monastic path in Jainism. The practice of body mortification is called &quot;kaya klesha&quot; in Jainism and is found in verse 9.19 of the &quot;Tattvartha Sutra&quot; by Umaswati, the most authoritative oldest surviving Jaina philosophical text.

=====Monastic practice=====
In Jain monastic practice, the monks and nuns take ascetic vows, after renouncing all relations and possessions. The vows include a complete commitment to nonviolence (&quot;Ahimsa&quot;). They travel from city to city, often crossing forests and deserts, and always barefoot. Jain ascetics do not stay in a single place for more than two months to prevent attachment to any place. However, during the four months of monsoon (rainy season) known as &quot;chaturmaas&quot;, they stay at a single place to avoid killing life forms that thrive during the rains. Jain monks and nuns practice complete celibacy. They do not touch or share a sitting platform with a person of the opposite sex.

Jain ascetics follow a strict vegetarian diet without root vegetables. Prof. Pushpendra K. Jain explains:

Clearly enough, to procure such vegetables and fruits, one must pull out the plant from the root, thus destroying the entire plant, and with it all the other micro organisms around the root. Fresh fruits and vegetables should be plucked only when ripe and ready to fall off, or ideally after they have fallen off the plant. In case they are plucked from the plants, only as much as required should be procured and consumed without waste.

The monks of Śvetāmbara sub-tradition within Jainism do not cook food but solicit alms from householders. Digambara monks have only a single meal a day. Neither group will beg for food, but a Jain ascetic may accept a meal from a householder, provided that the latter is pure of mind and body and offers the food of his own volition and in the prescribed manner. During such an encounter, the monk remains standing and eats only a measured amount. A routine feature of Jain asceticism are fasting periods, where adherents abstain from consuming food, and sometimes water, only during daylight hours, for up to 30 days. Some monks avoid (or limit) medicine and/or hospitalization out of disregard for the physical body.

Śvētāmbara monks and nuns wear only unstitched white robes (an upper and lower garment), and own one bowl they use for eating and collecting alms. Male Digambara sect monks do not wear any clothes, carry nothing with them except a soft broom made of shed peacock feathers (&quot;pinchi&quot;) to gently remove any insect or living creature in their way or bowl, and they eat with their hands. They sleep on the floor without blankets, and sit on wooden platforms. Other austerities include meditation in seated or standing posture near riverbanks in the cold wind, or meditation atop hills and mountains, especially at noon when the sun is at its fiercest. Such austerities are undertaken according to the physical and mental limits of the individual ascetic.

When death is imminent from an advanced age or terminal disease, many Jain ascetics take a final vow of Santhara or Sallekhana, a fast to peaceful and detached death, by first reducing intake of and then ultimately abandoning all medicines, food, and water. Scholars state that this ascetic practice is not a suicide, but a form of natural death, done without passion or turmoil or suddenness, and because it is done without active violence to the body.

====Sikhism====
While Sikhism treats lust as a vice, it has at the same time unmistakingly pointed out that man must share the moral responsibility by leading the life of a householder. What is important is to be God-centred. According to Sikhism, ascetics are certainly not on the right path. When Guru Nanak visited Gorakhmata, he discussed the true meaning of asceticism with some yogis:

===Other religions===

====Inca religion====
In Inca religion of medieval South America, asceticism was practiced. The high priests of the Inca people lived an ascetic life, which included fasting, chastity and eating simple food. The Jesuit records report Christian missionaries encountering ascetic Inca hermits in the Andean mountains.

====Taoism====
Historical evidence suggests that the monastic tradition in Taoism practiced asceticism, and the most common ascetic practices included fasting, complete sexual abstinence, self-imposed poverty, sleep deprivation, and secluding oneself in the wilderness. More extreme and unnatural ascetic Taoist practices have included public self-drowning and self-cremation. The goal of this spectrum of practices, like in other religions, was to reach the divine and get past the mortal body. According to Stephen Eskildsen, asceticism continues to be a part of modern Taoism.

====Zoroastrianism====
In Zoroastrianism, active participation in life through good thoughts, good words and good deeds is necessary to ensure happiness and to keep the chaos at bay. This &quot;active&quot; participation is a central element in Zoroaster&#x27;s concept of free will. In the &quot;Avesta&quot;, the sacred scriptures of Zoroastrianism, fasting and mortification are forbidden.

== Academic views ==

=== Sociological and psychological views ===
Early 20th-century German sociologist Max Weber made a distinction between &quot;innerweltliche&quot; and &quot;ausserweltliche&quot; asceticism, which means (roughly) &quot;inside the world&quot; and &quot;outside the world&quot;, respectively. Talcott Parsons translated these as &quot;worldly&quot; and &quot;otherworldly&quot;—however, some translators use &quot;inner-worldly&quot;, and this is more in line with inner world explorations of mysticism, a common purpose of asceticism. &quot;Inner- or Other-worldly&quot; asceticism is practised by people who withdraw from the world to live an ascetic life (this includes monks who live communally in monasteries, as well as hermits who live alone). &quot;Worldly&quot; asceticism refers to people who live ascetic lives but do not withdraw from the world:
Weber claimed this distinction originated in the Protestant Reformation, but later became secularized, so the concept can be applied to both religious and secular ascetics.

The 20th century American psychological theorist David McClelland suggested worldly asceticism is specifically targeting worldly pleasures that &quot;distract&quot; people from their calling and may accept worldly pleasures that are not distracting. As an example, he pointed out Quakers have historically objected to bright-coloured clothing, but wealthy Quakers often made their drab clothing out of expensive materials. The color was considered distracting, but the materials were not. Amish groups use similar criteria to make decisions about which modern technologies to use and which to avoid.

==== Nietzsche&#x27;s and Epicurus&#x27;s view ====
In the third essay (&quot;What Do Ascetic Ideals Mean?&quot;) from his 1887 book &quot;On the Genealogy of Morals&quot;, Friedrich Nietzsche discusses what he terms the &quot;ascetic ideal&quot; and its role in the formulation of morality along with the history of the will. In the essay, Nietzsche describes how such a paradoxical action as asceticism might serve the interests of life: through asceticism one can overcome one&#x27;s desire to perish from pain and despair and attain mastery over oneself. In this way one can express both ressentiment and the will to power. Nietzsche describes the morality of the ascetic priest as characterized by Christianity as one where, finding oneself in pain or despair and desiring to perish from it, the will to live causes one to place oneself in a state of hibernation and denial of the material world in order to minimize that pain and thus preserve life, a technique which Nietzsche locates at the very origin of secular science as well as of religion. He associated the &quot;ascetic ideal&quot; with Christian decadence.

Asceticism is not always life-denying or pleasure-denying. Some ascetic practices have actually been carried out as disciplines of pleasure. Epicurus taught a philosophy of pleasure, but he also engaged in ascetic practices like fasting. This may have been done in the service of testing the limits of nature, of desires, of pleasure, and of his own body. In the eighth of his Principal Doctrines, Epicurus says that we sometimes choose pains if greater pleasures ensue from them, or avoid pleasures if greater pains ensue, and in the &quot;autarchy&quot; portion of his Letter to Menoeceus, he teaches that living frugally can help us to better enjoy luxuries when we have them.

<text>Advent is a season observed in most Christian denominations as a time of waiting and preparation for both the celebration of Jesus&#x27;s birth at Christmas and the return of Christ at the Second Coming. It begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas, often referred to as Advent Sunday. Advent is the beginning of the liturgical year in Western Christianity. The name comes from Latin (&#x27;coming; arrival&#x27;), translating the Greek from the New Testament, originally referring to the Second Coming.

The season of Advent in the Christian calendar anticipates the &quot;coming of Christ&quot; from three different perspectives: the physical nativity in Bethlehem, the reception of Christ in the heart of the believer, and the eschatological Second Coming.

Practices associated with Advent include Advent calendars, lighting an Advent wreath, praying an Advent daily devotional, erecting a Chrismon tree, lighting a Christingle, as well as other ways of preparing for Christmas, such as setting up Christmas decorations, a custom that is sometimes done liturgically through a hanging of the greens ceremony.

The analogue of Advent in Eastern Christianity is called the Nativity Fast, but it differs in meaning, length, and observances, and does not begin the liturgical church year as it does in the West. The Eastern Nativity Fast does not use the term in its preparatory services.

== Dates ==

In the Anglican, Lutheran, Moravian, Presbyterian, and Methodist calendars, Advent begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas (always falling between 27 November and 3 December), and ends on Christmas Eve on 24 December.

In the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, Advent begins with First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of the Sunday that falls on or closest to 30 November and it ends before First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of Christmas. The first day of Advent also begins a new liturgical year. In the Ambrosian Rite and the Mozarabic Rite of the Catholic Church, Advent begins on the sixth Sunday before Christmas, the Sunday after St. Martin&#x27;s Day (11 November).

== Significance ==
For Western Christians of the Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican traditions, Advent signifies preparation for a threefold coming of Christ: firstly in the Incarnation at Bethlehem, then in a perpetual sacramental presence in the Eucharist, and thirdly at his Second Coming and final judgement. Furthermore, Advent is a time to focus on his present coming to mankind in the Word and Sacraments.

== History ==
It is not known when the period of preparation for Christmas that is now called Advent began, though it was certainly in existence from about 480; the novelty introduced by the Council of Tours of 567 was to order monks to fast every day in the month of December until Christmas. According to J. Neil Alexander, it is &quot;impossible to claim with confidence a credible explanation of the origin of Advent&quot;.
Associated with Advent as a time of penitence was a period of fasting, known also as St Martin&#x27;s Lent or the Nativity Fast. According to Saint Gregory of Tours the celebration of Advent began in the fifth century when the Bishop Perpetuus directed that starting with the St. Martin&#x27;s Day on 11 November until Christmas, one fasts three times per week; this is why Advent was sometimes also named &quot;Lent of St. Martin&quot;. This practice remained limited to the diocese of Tours until the sixth century.

The Council of Macon held in 581 adopted the practice in Tours. Soon all France observed three days of fasting a week from the feast of Saint Martin until Christmas. The most devout worshipers in some countries exceeded the requirements adopted by the council, and fasted every day of Advent.

The first clear references in the Western Church to Advent occur in the Gelasian Sacramentary, which provides Advent Collects, Epistles, and Gospels for the five Sundays preceding Christmas and for the corresponding Wednesdays and Fridays. The homilies of Gregory the Great in the late sixth century showed four weeks to the liturgical season of Advent, but without the observance of a fast. Under Charlemagne in the ninth century, writings claim that the fast was still widely observed.

In the 13th century, the fast of Advent was not commonly practised although, according to Durand of Mende, fasting was still generally observed. As quoted in the bull of canonisation of St. Louis, the zeal with which he observed this fast was no longer a custom observed by Christians of great piety. It was then limited to the period from the feast of Saint Andrew until Christmas Day, since the solemnity of this apostle was more universal than that of St. Martin.

When Pope Urban V ascended the papal seat in 1362, he imposed abstinence on the papal court but there was no mention of fasting. It was then customary in Rome to observe five weeks of Advent before Christmas. The Ambrosian Rite has six. The Greeks show no more real consistency: Advent was an optional fast that some begin on 15 November, while others begin on 6 December or only a few days before Christmas.

The liturgy of Advent remained unchanged until the Second Vatican Council introduced minor changes, differentiating the spirit of Lent from that of Advent, emphasising Advent as a season of hope for Christ&#x27;s coming now as a promise of his Second Coming.

== Traditions ==

The theme of readings and teachings during Advent is often the preparation for the Second Coming and the Last Judgement. While the Sunday readings relate to the first coming of Jesus Christ as saviour as well as to his Second Coming as judge, traditions vary in the relative importance of penitence and expectation during the weeks in Advent.

=== Liturgical colour ===

Since approximately the 13th century, the usual liturgical colour in Western Christianity for Advent has been violet; Pope Innocent III declared black to be the proper colour for Advent, though Durandus of Saint-Pourçain claims violet has preference over black. The violet or purple colour is often used for antependia, the vestments of the clergy, and often also the tabernacle.
On the third Sunday of Advent, Gaudete Sunday, rose may be used instead, referencing the rose used on Laetare Sunday, the fourth Sunday of Lent. A rose-coloured candle in Western Christianity is referenced as a sign of joy () lit on the third Sunday of Advent.

While the traditional colour for Advent is violet, there is a growing interest in and acceptance, by some Christian denominations of blue as an alternative liturgical colour for Advent, a custom traced to the usage of the Church of Sweden (Lutheran) and the Mozarabic Rite, which dates from the 8th century.

The Lutheran Book of Worship lists blue as the preferred colour for Advent, while the Methodist Book of Worship and the Presbyterian Book of Common Worship identify purple or blue as appropriate for Advent. Proponents of this new liturgical trend argue that purple is traditionally associated with solemnity and somberness, which is fitting to the repentant character of Lent. There has been an increasing trend in Protestant churches to supplant purple with blue during Advent as it is a hopeful season of preparation that anticipates both Bethlehem and the consummation of history in the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRI/Voice, Institute – The Color Blue in Advent&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This colour is often called &quot;Sarum blue&quot;, referring to its purported use at Salisbury Cathedral. Many of the ornaments and ceremonial practices associated with the Sarum rite were revived in the Anglican Communion in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as part of the Anglo-Catholic Oxford Movement in the Church of England. While Anglican liturgist Percy Dearmer does not object to the use of blue during Advent, he did not attribute its use to Sarum. &quot;[T]he so-called Sarum uses are really one-half made up from the fancy of nineteenth-century ritualists.&quot;

While the Sarum use was influential, different dioceses, including Salisbury, used a variety of coloured vestments. &quot;In the Sarum Rite the Advent colour was red, but it could very well have been the red-purple known as murray ...&quot;

The Roman Catholic Church retains the traditional violet. Blue is not generally used in Latin Catholicism, and where it does regionally, it has nothing to do with Advent specifically, but with veneration of the Blessed Virgin. However, on some occasions that are heavily associated with Advent, such as the Rorate Mass (but not on Sundays), white is used.

During the Nativity Fast, red is used by Eastern Christianity, although gold is an alternative colour.

=== Music ===
Many churches hold special musical events, such as Nine Lessons and Carols and singing of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; oratorio. The Advent Prose, an antiphonal plainsong, may be sung. The &quot;Late Advent Weekdays&quot;, 17–24 December, mark the singing of the Great Advent &#x27;O antiphons&#x27;. These are the daily antiphons for the Magnificat at Vespers, Evensong, or Evening Prayer, in the Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran churches, and mark the forthcoming birth of the Messiah. They form the basis for each verse of the popular Advent hymn &quot;O come, O come, Emmanuel&quot;.

German songs for Advent include from the 15th century and , published in 1622. Johann Sebastian Bach composed several cantatas for Advent in Weimar, from , BWV 61, to , BWV 147a, but only one more in Leipzig where he worked for the longest time, because there Advent was a silent time which allowed cantata music only on the first of the four Sundays.

During Advent, the Gloria of the Mass is omitted, so that the return of the angels&#x27; song at Christmas has an effect of novelty.
Mass compositions written especially for Lent, such as Michael Haydn&#x27;s , in D minor for choir and organ, have no Gloria and so are appropriate for use in Advent.

=== Fasting ===

Bishop Perpetuus of Tours, who died in 490, ordered fasting three days a week from the day after Saint Martin&#x27;s Day (11 November). In the 6th century, local councils enjoined fasting on all days except Saturdays and Sundays from Saint Martin&#x27;s Day to Epiphany (the feast of baptism), a period of 56 days, but of 40 days fasting, like the fast of Lent. It was therefore called (Saint Martin&#x27;s Lent). This period of fasting was later shortened and called &quot;Advent&quot; by the Church.

In the Anglican and Lutheran churches this fasting rule was later relaxed. The Roman Catholic Church later abolished the precept of fasting during Advent (at an unknown date at the latest in 1917), later, but kept Advent as a season of penitence. In addition to fasting, dancing and similar festivities were forbidden in these traditions. On Gaudete Sunday, relaxation of the fast was permitted. Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches still hold the tradition of fasting for 40 days before Christmas.

=== Local rites ===

In England, especially in the northern counties, there was a custom (now extinct) for poor women to carry around the &quot;Advent images&quot;, two dolls dressed to represent Jesus and the Blessed Virgin Mary. A halfpenny coin was expected from every one to whom these were exhibited and bad luck was thought to menace the household not visited by the doll-bearers before Christmas Eve at the latest.

In Normandy, farmers employed children under twelve to run through the fields and orchards armed with torches, setting fire to bundles of straw, and thus, it was believed, driving out such vermin as were likely to damage the crops.

In Italy, among other Advent celebrations, is the entry into Rome in the last days of Advent of the Calabrian , or bagpipe players, who play before the shrines of Mary, the mother of Jesus: in Italian tradition, the shepherds played these pipes when they came to the manger at Bethlehem to pay homage to the infant Jesus.

In recent times, the most common observance of Advent outside church circles has been the keeping of an Advent calendar or Advent candle, with one door being opened in the calendar, or one section of the candle being burned, on each day in December leading up to Christmas Eve. In many countries, the first day of Advent often heralds the start of the Christmas season, with many people opting to erect their Christmas trees and Christmas decorations on or immediately before Advent Sunday.

Since 2011, an Advent labyrinth consisting of 2,500 tealights has been formed for the third Saturday of Advent in Frankfurt-Bornheim.

== Advent wreath ==


The keeping of an Advent wreath is a common practice in homes or churches. The concept of the Advent wreath originated among German Lutherans in the 16th century. However, it was not until three centuries later that the modern Advent wreath took shape.

The modern Advent wreath, with its candles representing the Sundays of Advent, originated from an 1839 initiative by Johann Hinrich Wichern, a Protestant pastor in Germany and a pioneer in urban mission work among the poor. To deal with the impatience of the children awaiting Christmas, whom he was teaching, Wichern made a ring of wood, with 19 small red tapers and four large white candles. Every morning a small candle was lit, and every Sunday a large candle. Modern practice only retains the large candles.

The wreath crown is traditionally made of fir tree branches knotted with a red ribbon and decorated with pine cones, holly, laurel, and sometimes mistletoe. It is also an ancient symbol signifying several things; first of all, the crown symbolises victory, in addition to its round form evoking the sun and its return each year. The number four represents the four Sundays of Advent, and the green twigs are a sign of life and hope.

The fir tree is a symbol of strength and laurel a symbol of victory over sin and suffering. The latter two, with the holly, do not lose their leaves, and thus represent the eternity of God. The flames of candles are the representation of the Christmas light approaching and bringing hope and peace, as well as the symbol of the struggle against darkness. For Christians, this crown is also the symbol of Christ the King, the holly recalling the crown of thorns resting on the head of Christ.

The Advent wreath is adorned with candles, usually three violet or purple and one pink; the pink candle is lit on the Third Sunday of Advent, called &quot;Gaudete Sunday&quot; after the opening word, , meaning &#x27;Rejoice&#x27;, of the entrance antiphon at Mass. Some add a fifth candle (white), known as the &quot;Christ candle&quot;, in the middle of the wreath, to be lit on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.

The candles symbolize, in one interpretation, the great stages of salvation before the coming of the Messiah; the first is the symbol of the forgiveness granted to Adam and Eve, the second is the symbol of the faith of Abraham and of the patriarchs who believe in the gift of the Promised Land, the third is the symbol of the joy of David whose lineage does not stop and also testifies to his covenant with God, and the fourth and last candle is the symbol of the teaching of the prophets who announce a reign of justice and peace. Alternatively, they symbolize the four stages of human history; creation, the Incarnation, the redemption of sins, and the Last Judgment.

In Orthodox churches there are sometimes wreaths with six candles, in line with the six-week duration of the Nativity Fast/Advent.

In Sweden, white candles, symbol of festivity and purity, are used in celebrating Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day, 13 December, which always falls within Advent.

== Four Sundays ==
=== Roman Catholic Church ===

In the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, the readings of Mass on the Sundays of Advent have distinct themes:

*First Sunday in Advent: On the First Sunday (Advent Sunday), they look forward to the Second Coming of Christ.
*Second Sunday in Advent: On the Second Sunday, the Gospel reading recalls the preaching of John the Baptist, who came to &quot;prepare the way of the Lord&quot;; the other readings have associated themes.
*Third Sunday in Advent: On the Third Sunday (&quot;Gaudete Sunday&quot;), the Gospel reading is again about John the Baptist, the other readings about the joy associated with the coming of the Saviour.
*Fourth Sunday in Advent: On the Fourth Sunday, the Gospel reading is about the events involving Mary and Joseph that led directly to the birth of Jesus, while the other readings are related to these.

=== Anglican, Lutheran, Presbyterian, and Methodist traditions ===
A variety of practices derived from the Roman rite are observed in various protestant churches which retain similar liturgical practices.

*Last Sunday before Advent: In the Roman Catholic Church since 1969, and in most Anglican churches since at least 2000, the Sunday before Advent (the final Sunday of the liturgical year) is celebrated as the Feast of Christ the King. This feast is now also widely observed in many Protestant churches, sometimes as the &quot;Reign of Christ&quot;.
*First Sunday in Advent: The readings for the first Sunday in Advent relate to the Old Testament patriarchs who were Christ&#x27;s ancestors, so some call the first Advent candle that of hope.
*Second Sunday in Advent: The readings for the second Sunday concern Christ&#x27;s birth in Bethlehem and other prophecies, so the candle may be called the &quot;Bethlehem candle&quot;, the &quot;way candle&quot;, or the &quot;prophets&#x27; candle&quot;.
*Third Sunday in Advent: The third Sunday, called Sunday after the first word of the introit (Philippians 4:4), is celebrated with rose-coloured vestments similar to Laetare Sunday at the middle point of Lent. The readings relate to John the Baptist, and the rose-coloured candle may be called the &quot;joy candle&quot;, &quot;Mary candle&quot;, or &quot;shepherds&#x27; candle&quot;.
*Fourth Sunday in Advent: The readings for the fourth Sunday relate to the annunciation of Christ&#x27;s birth, for which the or &quot;Song of Mary&quot; may be featured. The candle may be known as the &quot;angel&#x27;s candle&quot;.
*First Sunday after Advent: Where an Advent wreath includes a fifth candle, it is known as the &quot;Christ candle&quot; and is lit during the Christmas Eve service.

=== Other weekly theme variations ===
Other variations of the themes celebrated on each of the four Sundays include:
* The Prophets&#x27; Candle, symbolizing hope; the Bethlehem Candle, symbolizing faith; the Shepherds&#x27; Candle, symbolizing joy; the Angel&#x27;s Candle, symbolizing peace
* Hope–Love–Joy–Peace
* Hope–Peace–Joy–Love
* Faithfulness–Hope–Joy–Love
* Prophets–Angels–Shepherds–Magi
* Faith–Prepare–Joy–Love

<text>A story within a story, also referred to as an embedded narrative, is a literary device in which a character within a story becomes the narrator of a second story (within the first one). Multiple layers of stories within stories are sometimes called nested stories. A play may have a brief play within it, such as in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;; a film may show the characters watching a short film; or a novel may contain a short story within the novel. A story within a story can be used in all types of narration including poems, and songs. 

Stories within stories can be used simply to enhance entertainment for the reader or viewer, or can act as examples to teach lessons to other characters. The inner story often has a symbolic and psychological significance for the characters in the outer story. There is often some parallel between the two stories, and the fiction of the inner story is used to reveal the truth in the outer story. Often the stories within a story are used to satirize views, not only in the outer story, but also in the real world. When a story is told within another instead of being told as part of the plot, it allows the author to play on the reader&#x27;s perceptions of the characters—the motives and the reliability of the storyteller are automatically in question.

Stories within a story may disclose the background of characters or events, tell of myths and legends that influence the plot, or even seem to be extraneous diversions from the plot. In some cases, the story within a story is involved in the action of the plot of the outer story. In others, the inner story is independent, and could either be skipped or stand separately, although many subtle connections may be lost. Often there is more than one level of internal stories, leading to deeply-nested fiction. &quot;Mise en abyme&quot; is the French term for a similar literary device (also referring to the practice in heraldry of placing the image of a small shield on a larger shield).

== Frame stories and anthology works ==

The literary device of stories within a story dates back to a device known as a &quot;frame story&quot;, where a supplemental story is used to help tell the main story. Typically, the outer story or &quot;frame&quot; does not have much matter, and most of the work consists of one or more complete stories told by one or more storytellers.

The earliest examples of &quot;frame stories&quot; and &quot;stories within stories&quot; were in ancient Egyptian and Indian literature, such as the Egyptian &quot;Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor&quot; and Indian epics like the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, &quot;Seven Wise Masters&quot;, &quot;Hitopadesha&quot; and &quot;Vikrama and Vethala&quot;. In Vishnu Sarma&#x27;s &quot;Panchatantra&quot;, an inter-woven series of colorful animal tales are told with one narrative opening within another, sometimes three or four layers deep, and then unexpectedly snapping shut in irregular rhythms to sustain attention. In the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the Kurukshetra War is narrated by a character in Vyasa&#x27;s &quot;Jaya&quot;, which itself is narrated by a character in Vaisampayana&#x27;s &quot;Bharata&quot;, which itself is narrated by a character in Ugrasrava&#x27;s &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

Both &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; by Apuleius and &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by Ovid extend the depths of framing to several degrees. Another early example is the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (&quot;Arabian Nights&quot;), where the general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by Scheherazade. In many of Scheherazade&#x27;s narrations, there are also stories narrated, and even in some of these, there are some other stories. An example of this is &quot;The Three Apples&quot;, a murder mystery narrated by Scheherazade. Within the story, after the murderer reveals himself, he narrates a flashback of events leading up to the murder. Within this flashback, an unreliable narrator tells a story to mislead the would-be murderer, who later discovers that he was misled after another character narrates the truth to him. As the story concludes, the &quot;&quot; is narrated within it. This perennially popular work can be traced back to Arabic, Persian, and Indian storytelling traditions.

Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; has a deeply nested frame story structure, that features the narration of Walton, who records the narration of Victor Frankenstein, who recounts the narration of his creation, who narrates the story of a cabin dwelling family he secretly observes. Another classic novel with a frame story is &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, the majority of which is recounted by the central family&#x27;s housekeeper to a boarder. Similarly, Roald Dahl&#x27;s story &quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar&quot; is about a rich bachelor who finds an essay written by someone who learned to &quot;see&quot; playing cards from the reverse side. The full text of this essay is included in the story, and itself includes a lengthy sub-story told as a true experience by one of the essay&#x27;s protagonists, Imhrat Khan.

Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot; books, &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865) and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; (1871), have several multiple poems that are mostly recited by several characters to the titular character. The most notable examples are &quot;You Are Old, Father William&quot;, &#x27;Tis the Voice of the Lobster&quot;, &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, and &quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter&quot;.

Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; and Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; are also classic frame stories. In Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, the characters tell tales suited to their personalities and tell them in ways that highlight their personalities. The noble knight tells a noble story, the boring character tells a very dull tale, and the rude miller tells a smutty tale. Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; too makes use of this device; Odysseus&#x27; adventures at sea are all narrated by Odysseus to the court of king Alcinous in Scheria. Other shorter tales, many of them false, account for much of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Many modern children&#x27;s story collections are essentially anthology works connected by this device, such as Arnold Lobel&#x27;s &quot;Mouse Tales&quot;, Paula Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Little Swineherd&quot;, and Phillip and Hillary Sherlock&#x27;s &quot;Ears and Tails and Common Sense&quot;.

A well-known modern example of framing is the fantasy genre work &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (both the book and the film). In the film, a grandfather is reading the story of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; to his grandson. In the book, a more detailed frame story has a father editing a much longer (but fictive) work for his son, creating his own &quot;Good Parts Version&quot; (as the book called it) by leaving out all the parts that would bore or displease a young boy. Both the book and the film assert that the central story is from a book called &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; by a nonexistent author named S. Morgenstern.

In the Welsh novel (1852) see by Gwilym Hiraethog, a visitor to a farm in north Wales tells the story of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; to those gathered around the hearth.

Sometimes a frame story exists in the same setting as the main story. On the television series &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;, each episode was framed as though it were being told by Indy when he was older (usually acted by George Hall, but once by Harrison Ford). The same device of an adult narrator representing the older version of a young protagonist is used in the films &quot;Stand by Me&quot; and &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, and the television show &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; and &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;.

=== Frame stories in music ===
In &quot;The Amory Wars&quot;, a tale told through the music of Coheed and Cambria, tells a story for the first two albums but reveals that the story is being actively written by a character called the Writer in the third. During the album, the Writer delves into his own story and kills one of the characters, much to the dismay of the main character.

The critically acclaimed Beatles album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; is presented as a stage show by the fictional eponymous band, and one of its songs, &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, is in the form of a story within a dream. Similarly, the Fugees album &quot;The Score&quot; is presented as the soundtrack to a fictional film, as are several other notable concept albums, while Wyclef Jean&#x27;s &quot;The Carnival&quot; is presented as testimony at a trial. The majority of Ayreon&#x27;s albums outline a sprawling, loosely interconnected science fiction narrative, as do the albums of Janelle Monae.

On Tom Waits&#x27;s concept album &quot;Alice&quot; (consisting of music he wrote for the musical of the same name), most of the songs are (very) loosely inspired by both &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, and the book&#x27;s real-life author, Lewis Carroll, and inspiration Alice Liddell. The song &quot;Poor Edward&quot;, however, is presented as a story told by a narrator about Edward Mordrake, and the song &quot;Fish and Bird&quot; is presented as a retold story that the narrator heard from a sailor.

== Examples of nested stories by type ==

=== Nested books ===
In his 1895 historical novel &quot;Pharaoh&quot;, Bolesław Prus introduces a number of stories within the story, ranging in length from vignettes to full-blown stories, many of them drawn from ancient Egyptian texts, that further the plot, illuminate characters, and even inspire the fashioning of individual characters. Jan Potocki&#x27;s &quot;The Manuscript Found in Saragossa&quot; (1797–1805) has an interlocking structure with stories-within-stories reaching several levels of depth.

The provenance of the story is sometimes explained internally, as in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien, which depicts the Red Book of Westmarch (a story-internal version of the book itself) as a history compiled by several of the characters. The subtitle of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (&quot;There and Back Again&quot;) is depicted as part of a rejected title of this book within a book, and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is a part of the final title.

An example of an interconnected inner story is &quot;The Mad Trist&quot; in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, where through somewhat mystical means the narrator&#x27;s reading of the story within a story influences the reality of the story he has been telling, so that what happens in &quot;The Mad Trist&quot; begins happening in &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;. Also, in &quot;Don Quixote&quot; by Miguel de Cervantes, there are many stories within the story that influence the hero&#x27;s actions (there are others that even the author himself admits are purely digressive).
Most of the first part is presented as a translation of a found manuscript by (fictional) Cide Hamete Benengeli.

A commonly independently anthologised story is &quot;The Grand Inquisitor&quot; by Dostoevsky from his long psychological novel &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, which is told by one brother to another to explain, in part, his view on religion and morality. It also, in a succinct way, dramatizes many of Dostoevsky&#x27;s interior conflicts.

An example of a &quot;bonus material&quot; style inner story is the chapter &quot;The Town Ho&#x27;s Story&quot; in Herman Melville&#x27;s novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;; that chapter tells a fully formed story of an exciting mutiny and contains many plot ideas that Melville had conceived during the early stages of writing &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;—ideas originally intended to be used later in the novel—but as the writing progressed, these plot ideas eventually proved impossible to fit around the characters that Melville went on to create and develop. Instead of discarding the ideas altogether, Melville wove them into a coherent short story and had the character Ishmael demonstrate his eloquence and intelligence by telling the story to his impressed friends.

One of the most complicated structures of a story within a story was used by Vladimir Nabokov in his novel &quot;The Gift&quot;. There, as inner stories, function both poems and short stories by the main character Fyodor Cherdyntsev as well as the whole Chapter IV, a critical biography of Nikolay Chernyshevsky (also written by Fyodor). This novel is considered one of the first metanovels in literature.

With the rise of literary modernism, writers experimented with ways in which multiple narratives might nest imperfectly within each other. A particularly ingenious example of nested narratives is James Merrill&#x27;s 1974 modernist poem &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;.

In Rabih Alameddine&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hakawati&quot;, or &quot;The Storyteller&quot;, the protagonist describes coming home to the funeral of his father, one of a long line of traditional Arabic storytellers. Throughout the narrative, the author becomes hakawati (an Arabic word for a teller of traditional tales) himself, weaving the tale of the story of his own life and that of his family with folkloric versions of tales from Qur&#x27;an, the Old Testament, Ovid, and One Thousand and One Nights. Both the tales he tells of his family (going back to his grandfather) and the embedded folk tales, themselves embed other tales, often 2 or more layers deep.

In Sue Townsend&#x27;s &quot;Adrian Mole: The Wilderness Years&quot;, Adrian writes the book &quot;Lo! The Flat Hills of My Homeland&quot;, in which the character Jake Westmorland writes a book called &quot;Sparg of Kronk&quot;, where the character Sparg writes a book with no language.

In Anthony Horowitz&#x27;s &quot;Magpie Murders&quot;, a significant proportion of the book features a fictional but authentically formatted mystery novel by Alan Conway, titled &#x27;Magpie Murders&#x27;. The secondary novel ends before its conclusion returning the narrative to the original, and primary, story where the protagonist and reviewer of the book attempts to find the final chapter. As this progresses characters and messages within the fictional &quot;Magpie Murders&quot; manifest themselves within the primary narrative and the final chapter&#x27;s content reveals the reason for its original absence.

Dreams are a common way of including stories inside stories, and can sometimes go several levels deep. Both the book &quot;The Arabian Nightmare&quot; and the curse of &quot;eternal waking&quot; from the Neil Gaiman series &quot;The Sandman&quot; feature an endless series of waking from one dream into another dream. In Charles Maturin&#x27;s novel &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot;, the use of vast stories-within-stories creates a sense of dream-like quality in the reader.

The 2023 Christian fictional novel &quot;Just Once&quot; by Karen Kingsbury features a series of three nested stories, all centering around the main characters of Hank and Irvel Myers:
*The outermost story (set in 2018) features their granddaughter, Audra, at a ceremony where the members of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) will be recognized. Unknown to anyone in her family, Irvel served as a spy in OSS (she had told everyone she was a nurse), and the story would have been lost but for her father finding a set of forgotten videotapes while remodeling his childhood home.
*The next story (set in 1989) features Irvel being diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease; she and Hank decide to videotape their story before it is lost to Irvel&#x27;s failing memory.
*The innermost story (set between 1940 and 1945) tells of Hank and Irvel&#x27;s relationship before and after World War II, and her work within OSS.

==== Religion and philosophy ====
This structure is also found in classic religious and philosophical texts. The structure of &quot;The Symposium&quot; and &quot;Phaedo&quot;, attributed to Plato, is of a story within a story within a story. In the Christian Bible, the gospels are accounts of the life and ministry of Jesus. However, they also include within them the parables that Jesus told. In more modern philosophical works, Jostein Gaarder&#x27;s books often feature this device. Examples are &quot;The Solitaire Mystery&quot;, where the protagonist receives a small book from a baker, in which the baker tells the story of a sailor who tells the story of another sailor, and &quot;Sophie&#x27;s World&quot;, about a girl who is actually a character in a book that is being read by Hilde, a girl in another dimension. Later on in the book Sophie questions this idea, and realizes that Hilde too could be a character in a story that in turn is being read by another.

&quot;Mahabharata&quot;, an Indian epic that is also the world&#x27;s longest epic, has a nested structure.

==== Nested science fiction ====
The experimental modernist works that incorporate multiple narratives into one story are quite often science fiction or science fiction influenced. These include most of the various novels written by the American author Kurt Vonnegut. Vonnegut includes the recurring character Kilgore Trout in many of his novels. Trout acts as the mysterious science fiction writer who enhances the morals of the novels through plot descriptions of his stories. Books such as &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; and &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot; are sprinkled with these plot descriptions. Stanisław Lem&#x27;s &quot;Tale of the Three Storytelling Machines of King Genius&quot; from &quot;The Cyberiad&quot; has several levels of storytelling. All levels tell stories of the same person, Trurl.

&quot;House of Leaves&quot; is the tale of a man who finds a manuscript telling the story of a documentary that may or may not have ever existed, contains multiple layers of plot. The book includes footnotes and letters that tell their own stories only vaguely related to the events in the main narrative of the book, and footnotes for fake books.

Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s later books (&quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot; and &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot;) propose the idea that every real universe is a fiction in another universe. This hypothesis enables many writers who are characters in the books to interact with their own creations. Margaret Atwood&#x27;s novel &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot; is interspersed with excerpts from a novel written by one of the main characters; the novel-within-a-novel itself contains a science fiction story written by one of &quot;that&quot; novel&#x27;s characters.

In Philip K. Dick&#x27;s novel &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;, each character comes into interaction with a book called &quot;The Grasshopper Lies Heavy&quot;, which was written by the Man in the High Castle. As Dick&#x27;s novel details a world in which the Axis Powers of World War II had succeeded in dominating the known world, the novel within the novel details an alternative to this history in which the Allies overcome the Axis and bring stability to the world – a victory which itself is quite different from real history.

In &quot;Red Orc&#x27;s Rage&quot; by Philip J. Farmer, a doubly recursive method is used to intertwine its fictional layers. This novel is part of a science fiction series, the &quot;World of Tiers&quot;. Farmer collaborated in the writing of this novel with an American psychiatrist, A. James Giannini, who had previously used the &quot;World of Tiers&quot; series in treating patients in group therapy. During these therapeutic sessions, the content and process of the text and novelist was discussed rather than the lives of the patients. In this way subconscious defenses could be circumvented. Farmer took the real life case-studies and melded these with adventures of his characters in the series.

The &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; novel &quot;Knights of the Morningstar&quot; also features a character who writes a book by that name. In Matthew Stover&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; novel &quot;Shatterpoint&quot;, the protagonist Mace Windu narrates the story within his journal, while the main story is being told from the third-person limited point of view.

Several &quot;Star Trek&quot; tales are stories or events within stories, such as Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s novelization of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, J. A. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Angels&quot;, John M. Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Final Reflection&quot;, Margaret Wander Bonanno&#x27;s &quot;Strangers from the Sky&quot; (which adopts the conceit that it is a book from the future by an author called Gen Jaramet-Sauner), and J. R. Rasmussen&#x27;s &quot;Research&quot; in the anthology &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds II&quot;. Steven Barnes&#x27;s novelization of the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Far Beyond the Stars&quot; partners with Greg Cox&#x27;s &quot;The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh&quot; (Volume Two) to tell us that the fictional story &quot;Far Beyond the Stars&quot; (whose setting and cast closely resemble &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;)—and, by extension, all of &quot;Star Trek&quot; itself—is the creation of 1950s writer Benny Russell.

The book &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; (later adapted into a film by The Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer) consisted of six interlinked stories nested inside each other in a Russian doll fashion. The first story (that of Adam Ewing in the 1850s befriending an escaped slave) is interrupted halfway through and revealed to be part of a journal being read by composer Robert Frobisher in 1930s Belgium. His own story of working for a more famous composer is told in a series of letters to his lover Rufus Sixsmith, which are interrupted halfway through and revealed to be in the possession of an investigative journalist named Luisa Rey and so on. Each of the first five tales are interrupted in the middle, with the sixth tale being told in full, before the preceding five tales are finished in reverse order. Each layer of the story either challenges the veracity of the previous layer, or is challenged by the succeeding layer. Presuming each layer to be a true telling within the overall story, a chain of events is created linking Adam Ewing&#x27;s embrace of the abolitionist movement in the 1850s to the religious redemption of a post-apocalyptic tribal man over a century after the fall of modern civilization. The characters in each nested layer take inspiration or lessons from the stories of their predecessors in a manner that validates a belief stated in the sixth tale that &quot;Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present and by each crime, and every kindness, we birth our future.&quot;

====Play or film within a book====
&quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; by Thomas Pynchon has several characters seeing a play called &quot;The Courier&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; by the fictitious Jacobean playwright Richard Wharfinger. The events of the play broadly mirror those of the novel and give the character Oedipa Maas a greater context to consider her predicament; the play concerns a feud between two rival mail distribution companies, which appears to be ongoing to the present day, and in which, if this is the case, Oedipa has found herself involved. As in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the director makes changes to the original script; in this instance, a couplet that was added, possibly by religious zealots intent on giving the play extra moral gravity, are said only on the night that Oedipa sees the play.

From what Pynchon relates, this is the only mention in the play of Thurn and Taxis&#x27; rivals&#x27; name—Trystero—and it is the seed for the conspiracy that unfurls. A significant portion of Walter Moers&#x27; &quot;Labyrinth of Dreaming Books&quot; is an ekphrasis on the subject of an epic puppet theater presentation. Another example is found in Samuel Delany&#x27;s &quot;Trouble on Triton&quot;, which features a theater company that produces elaborate staged spectacles for randomly selected single-person audiences. Plays produced by the &quot;Caws of Art&quot; theater company also feature in Russell Hoban&#x27;s modern fable, &quot;The Mouse and His Child&quot;. Raina Telgemeier&#x27;s best-selling &quot;Drama&quot; is a graphic novel about a middle-school musical production, and the tentative romantic fumblings of its cast members.

In Manuel Puig&#x27;s &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot;, ekphrases on various old movies, some real, and some fictional, make up a substantial portion of the narrative. In Paul Russell&#x27;s &quot;Boys of Life&quot;, descriptions of movies by director/antihero Carlos (loosely inspired by controversial director Pier Paolo Pasolini) provide a narrative counterpoint and add a touch of surrealism to the main narrative. They additionally raise the question of whether works of artistic genius justify or atone for the sins and crimes of their creators. Auster&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Illusions&quot; (2002) and Theodore Roszak&#x27;s &quot;Flicker&quot; (1991) also rely heavily on fictional films within their respective narratives.

=== Nested plays ===
This dramatic device was probably first used by Thomas Kyd in &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; around 1587, where the play is presented before an audience of two of the characters, who comment upon the action. From references in other contemporary works, Kyd is also assumed to have been the writer of an early, lost version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; (the so-called &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot;), with a play-within-a-play interlude. William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; retains this device by having Hamlet ask some strolling players to perform &quot;The Murder of Gonzago&quot;. The action and characters in &quot;The Murder&quot; mirror the murder of Hamlet&#x27;s father in the main action, and Prince Hamlet writes additional material to emphasize this. Hamlet wishes to provoke the murderer, his uncle, and sums this up by saying &quot;the play&#x27;s the thing wherein I&#x27;ll catch the conscience of the king.&quot; Hamlet calls this new play &quot;The Mouse-trap&quot; (a title that Agatha Christie later took for the long-running play &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;). Christie&#x27;s work was parodied in Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;The Real Inspector Hound&quot;, in which two theater critics are drawn into the murder mystery they are watching. The audience is similarly absorbed into the action in Woody Allen&#x27;s play &quot;God&quot;, which is about two failed playwrights in Ancient Greece. The phrase &quot;The Conscience of the King&quot; also became the title of a &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode featuring a production of Hamlet which leads to the exposure of a murderer (although not a king).

The play &quot;I Hate Hamlet&quot; and the movie &quot;A Midwinter&#x27;s Tale&quot; are about a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which in turn includes a production of &quot;The Murder of Gonzago&quot;, as does the &quot;Hamlet&quot;-based film &quot;Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;, which even features a third-level puppet theatre version within their play. Similarly, in Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; there are specific allusions to &quot;Hamlet&quot;: in the first act a son stages a play to impress his mother, a professional actress, and her new lover; the mother responds by comparing her son to Hamlet. Later he tries to come between them, as Hamlet had done with his mother and her new husband. The tragic developments in the plot follow in part from the scorn the mother shows for her son&#x27;s play.

Shakespeare adopted the play-within-a-play device for many of his other plays as well, including &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;Love&#x27;s Labours Lost&quot;. Almost the whole of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; is a play-within-a-play, presented to convince Christopher Sly, a drunken tinker, that he is a nobleman watching a private performance, but the device has no relevance to the plot (unless Katharina&#x27;s subservience to her &quot;lord&quot; in the last scene is intended to strengthen the deception against the tinker) and is often dropped in modern productions. The musical &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; is about the production of a fictitious musical, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, based on the comedy &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; by William Shakespeare, and features several scenes from it. &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot; draws in part on the 14th-century &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot; (itself a frame story) by John Gower, and Shakespeare has the ghost of Gower &quot;assume man&#x27;s infirmities&quot; to introduce his work to the contemporary audience and comment on the action of the play.

In Francis Beaumont&#x27;s &quot;Knight of the Burning Pestle&quot; (c. 1608) a supposed common citizen from the audience, actually a &quot;planted&quot; actor, condemns the play that has just started and &quot;persuades&quot; the players to present something about a shopkeeper. The citizen&#x27;s &quot;apprentice&quot; then acts, pretending to extemporise, in the rest of the play. This is a satirical tilt at Beaumont&#x27;s playwright contemporaries and their current fashion for offering plays about London life.

The opera &quot;Pagliacci&quot; is about a troupe of actors who perform a play about marital infidelity that mirrors their own lives, and composer Richard Rodney Bennett and playwright-librettist Beverley Cross&#x27;s &quot;The Mines of Sulphur&quot; features a ghostly troupe of actors who perform a play about murder that similarly mirrors the lives of their hosts, from whom they depart, leaving them with the plague as nemesis. John Adams&#x27; &quot;Nixon in China&quot; (1985–1987) features a surreal version of Madam Mao&#x27;s &quot;Red Detachment of Women&quot;, illuminating the ascendance of human values over the disillusionment of high politics in the meeting.

In Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Caucasian Chalk Circle&quot;, a play is staged as a parable to villagers in the Soviet Union to justify the re-allocation of their farmland: the tale describes how a child is awarded to a servant-girl rather than its natural mother, an aristocrat, as the woman most likely to care for it well. This kind of play-within-a-play, which appears at the beginning of the main play and acts as a &quot;frame&quot; for it, is called an &quot;induction&quot;. Brecht&#x27;s one-act play &quot;The Elephant Calf&quot; (1926) is a play-within-a-play performed in the foyer of the theatre during his &quot;Man Equals Man&quot;.

In Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s play &quot;Ondine&quot;, all of act two is a series of scenes within scenes, sometimes two levels deep. This increases the dramatic tension and also makes more poignant the inevitable failure of the relationship between the mortal Hans and water sprite Ondine.

&quot;The Two-Character Play&quot; by Tennessee Williams has a concurrent double plot with the convention of a play within a play. Felice and Clare are siblings and are both actor/producers touring &quot;The Two-Character Play&quot;. They have supposedly been abandoned by their crew and have been left to put on the play by themselves. The characters in the play are also brother and sister and are also named Clare and Felice.

&quot;The Mysteries&quot;, a modern reworking of the medieval mystery plays, remains faithful to its roots by having the modern actors play the sincere, naïve tradesmen and women as they take part in the original performances.

Alternatively, a play might be about the production of a play, and include the performance of all or part of the play, as in &quot;Noises Off&quot;, &quot;A Chorus of Disapproval&quot;, or &quot;Lilies&quot;. Similarly, the musical &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; presents the story of Don Quixote as an impromptu play staged in prison by &quot;Quixote&quot;″s author, Miguel de Cervantes.

In most stagings of the musical &quot;Cats&quot;, which include the song &quot;Growltiger&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; – a recollection of an old play by Gus the Theatre Cat – the character of Lady Griddlebone sings &quot;The Ballad of Billy McCaw&quot;. (However, many productions of the show omit &quot;Growltiger&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;, and &quot;The Ballad of Billy McCaw&quot; has at times been replaced with a mock aria, so this metastory is not always seen.) Depending on the production, there is another musical scene called &quot;The Awful Battle of the Pekes and the Pollices&quot; where the Jellicles put on a show for their leader. In &quot;&quot;, there are three play within a plays. First, when Lestat visits his childhood friend, Nicolas, who works in a theater, where he discovers his love for theater; and two more when the Theater of the Vampires perform. One is used as a plot mechanism to explain the vampire god, Marius, which sparks an interest in Lestat to find him.

A play within a play occurs in the musical &quot;The King and I&quot;, where Princess Tuptim and the royal dancers give a performance of &quot;Small House of Uncle Thomas&quot; (or &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;) to their English guests. The play mirrors Tuptim&#x27;s situation, as she wishes to run away from slavery to be with her lover, Lun Tha.

In stagings of Dina Rubina&#x27;s play &quot;Always the Same Dream&quot;, the story is about staging a school play based on a poem by Pushkin.

Joseph Heller&#x27;s 1967 play &quot;We Bombed in New Haven&quot; is about actors engaged in a play about military airmen; the actors themselves become at times unsure whether they are actors or actual airmen.

The 1937 musical &quot;Babes in Arms&quot; is about a group of kids putting on a musical to raise money. The central plot device was retained for the popular 1939 film version with Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney. A similar plot was recycled for the films &quot;White Christmas&quot; and &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;.

=== Nested films ===

The 1946 film noir &quot;The Locket&quot; contains a nested flashback structure, with a screenplay by Sheridan Gibney based on the story &quot;What Nancy Wanted&quot; by Norma Barzman.

The François Truffaut film &quot;Day for Night&quot; is about the making of a fictitious movie called &quot;Meet Pamela&quot; () and shows the interactions of the actors as they are making this movie about a woman who falls for her husband&#x27;s father. The story of &quot;Pamela&quot; involves lust, betrayal, death, sorrow, and change, events that are mirrored in the experiences of the actors portrayed in &quot;Day for Night&quot;. There are a wealth of other movies that revolve around the film industry itself, even if not centering exclusively on one nested film. These include the darkly satirical classic &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; about an aging star and her parasitic victim, and the Coen Brothers&#x27; farce &quot;Hail, Caesar!&quot;

The script to Karel Reisz&#x27;s movie &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1981), written by Harold Pinter, is a film-within-a-film adaptation of John Fowles&#x27;s book. In addition to the Victorian love story of the book, Pinter creates a present-day background story that shows a love affair between the main actors.

&quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; begins with the Muppets sitting down in a theater to watch the eponymous movie, which Kermit the Frog claims to be a semi-biographical account of how they all met.

In Buster Keaton&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot;, Keaton&#x27;s protagonist actually enters into a film while it is playing in a cinema, as does the main character in the Arnold Schwarzenegger film &quot;The Last Action Hero&quot;. A similar device is used in the music video for the song &quot;Take On Me&quot; by A-ha, which features a woman entering a pencil sketch. Conversely, Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; is about a film character exiting the film to interact with the real world. Allen&#x27;s earlier film &quot;Play it Again, Sam&quot; featured liberal use of characters, dialogue and clips from the film classic &quot;Casablanca&quot; as a central device.

The 2002 Pedro Almodóvar film &quot;Talk to Her&quot; () has the chief character Benigno tell a story called &quot;The Shrinking Lover&quot; to Alicia, a long-term comatose patient whom Benigno, a male nurse, is assigned to care for. The film presents &quot;The Shrinking Lover&quot; in the form of a black-and-white silent melodrama. To prove his love to a scientist girlfriend, &quot;The Shrinking Lover&quot; protagonist drinks a potion that makes him progressively smaller. The resulting seven-minute scene, which is readily intelligible and enjoyable as a stand-alone short subject, is considerably more overtly comic than the rest of &quot;Talk to Her&quot;—the protagonist climbs giant breasts as if they were rock formations and even ventures his way inside a (compared to him) gigantic vagina. Critics have noted that &quot;The Shrinking Lover&quot; essentially is a sex metaphor. Later in &quot;Talk to Her&quot;, the comatose Alicia is discovered to be pregnant and Benigno is sentenced to jail for rape. &quot;The Shrinking Lover&quot; was named Best Scene of 2002 in the &quot;Skandies&quot;, an annual survey of online cinephiles and critics invited each year by critic Mike D&#x27;Angelo.

&quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; (2008) is a comedy film revolving around a group of prima donna actors making a Vietnam War film (itself also named &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;) when their fed-up writer and director decide to abandon them in the middle of the jungle, forcing them to fight their way out. The concept was perhaps inspired by the 1986 comedy &quot;Three Amigos&quot;, where three washed-up silent film stars are expected to live out a real-life version of their old hit movies. The same idea of life being forced to imitate art is also reprised in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; parody &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;.

The first episode of the anime series &quot;The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&quot; consists almost entirely of a poorly made film that the protagonists created, complete with Kyon&#x27;s typical, sarcastic commentary.

Chuck Jones&#x27;s 1953 cartoon &quot;Duck Amuck&quot; shows Daffy Duck trapped in a cartoon that an unseen animator repeatedly manipulates. At the end, it is revealed that the whole cartoon was being controlled by Bugs Bunny. The &quot;Duck Amuck&quot; plot was essentially replicated in one of Jones&#x27; later cartoons, &quot;Rabbit Rampage&quot; (1955), in which Bugs Bunny turns out to be the victim of the sadistic animator (Elmer Fudd). A similar plot was also included in an episode of &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot;, in which Bugs is the victim, Daffy is the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. In 2007, the &quot;Duck Amuck&quot; sequence was parodied on &quot;Drawn Together&quot; (&quot;Nipple Ring-Ring Goes to Foster Care&quot;).

All feature-length films by Jörg Buttgereit except feature a film within the film. In , the protagonist goes to the cinema to see the fictional slasher film &quot;Vera&quot;. In , one of the character watches a video of the fictional Nazi exploitation film and in , the characters go to see a film called , which is a parody of Louis Malle&#x27;s &quot;My Dinner with André&quot;.

Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; depicts a Nazi propaganda film called &quot;Nation&#x27;s Pride&quot;, which glorifies a soldier in the German army. &quot;Nation&#x27;s Pride&quot; is directed by Eli Roth.

Joe Dante&#x27;s &quot;Matinee&quot; depicts &quot;Mant&quot;, an early-1960s sci-fi/horror movie about a man who turns into an ant. In one scene, the protagonists see a Disney-style family movie called &quot;The Shook-Up Shopping Cart&quot;.

==== Story within a film ====
The 2002 martial arts epic &quot;Hero&quot; presented the same narrative several different times, as recounted by different storytellers, but with both factual and aesthetic differences. Similarly, in the whimsical 1988 Terry Gilliam film &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;, and the 2003 Tim Burton film &quot;Big Fish&quot;, the bulk of the film is a series of stories told by an (extremely) unreliable narrator. In the 2006 Tarsem film &quot;The Fall&quot;, an injured silent-movie stuntman tells heroic fantasy stories to a little girl with a broken arm to pass time in the hospital, which the film visualizes and presents with the stuntman&#x27;s voice becoming voiceover narration. The fantasy tale bleeds back into and comments on the film&#x27;s &quot;present-tense&quot; story. There are often incongruities based on the fact that the stuntman is an American and the girl Persian—the stuntman&#x27;s voiceover refers to &quot;Indians&quot;, &quot;a squaw&quot; and &quot;a teepee&quot;, but the visuals show a Bollywood-style devi and a Taj Mahal-like castle. The same conceit of an unreliable narrator was used to very different effect in the 1995 crime drama &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (which garnered an Oscar for Kevin Spacey&#x27;s performance).

Walt Disney&#x27;s 1946 live-action drama film &quot;Song of the South&quot; has three animated sequences, all based on the Br&#x27;er Rabbit stories, told as moral fables by Uncle Remus (James Baskett) to seven-year-old Johnny (Bobby Driscoll) and his friends Ginny (Luana Patten) and Toby (Glenn Leedy).

The seminal 1950 Japanese film &quot;Rashomon&quot;, based on the Japanese short story &quot;In a Grove&quot; (1921), utilizes the flashback-within-a-flashback technique. The story unfolds in flashback as the four witnesses in the story—the bandit, the murdered samurai, his wife, and the nameless woodcutter—recount the events of one afternoon in a grove. But it is also a flashback within a flashback, because the accounts of the witnesses are being retold by a woodcutter and a priest to a ribald commoner as they wait out a rainstorm in a ruined gatehouse.

The film &quot;Inception&quot; has a deeply nested structure that is itself part of the setting, as the characters travel deeper and deeper into layers of dreams within dreams. Similarly, in the beginning of the music video for the Michael Jackson song &quot;Thriller&quot;, the heroine is terrorized by her monster boyfriend in what turns out to be a film within a dream. The film &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; has four layers of narration: starting with a young girl at the author&#x27;s memorial reading his book, it cuts to the old author in 1985 telling of an incident in 1968 when he, as a young author, stayed at the hotel and met the owner, old Zero. He was then told the story of young Zero and M. Gustave, from 1932, which makes up most of the narrative.

==== Play within a film ====
The 2001 film &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; features a fictitious musical within a film, called &quot;Spectacular Spectacular&quot;. The 1942 Ernst Lubitsch comedy &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; confuses the audience in the opening scenes with a play, &quot;The Naughty Nazis&quot;, about Adolf Hitler which appears to be taking place within the actual plot of the film. Thereafter, the acting company players serve as the protagonists of the film and frequently use acting/costumes to deceive various characters in the film. &quot;Hamlet&quot; also serves as an important throughline in the film, as suggested by the title. Laurence Olivier sets the opening scene of his 1944 film of &quot;Henry V&quot; in the tiring room of the old Globe Theatre as the actors prepare for their roles on stage. The early part of the film follows the actors in these &quot;stage&quot; performances and only later does the action almost imperceptibly expand to the full realism of the Battle of Agincourt. By way of increasingly more artificial sets (based on mediaeval paintings) the film finally returns to The Globe.

Mel Brooks&#x27; film &quot;The Producers&quot; revolves around a scheme to make money by producing a disastrously bad Broadway musical, &quot;Springtime for Hitler.&quot; Ironically the film itself was later made into its own Broadway musical (although a more intentionally successful one). The Outkast music video for the song &quot;Roses&quot; is a short film about a high school musical. In &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&quot;, the middle-schoolers put on a play of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, while &quot;High School Musical&quot; is a romantic comedy about the eponymous musical itself. A high school production is also featured in the gay teen romantic comedy &quot;Love, Simon&quot;.

A 2012 Italian film, &quot;Caesar Must Die&quot;, stars real-life Italian prisoners who rehearse Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; in Rebibbia prison playing &quot;fictional&quot; Italian prisoners rehearsing the same play in the same prison. In addition, the film itself becomes a &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; adaption of sorts as the scenes are frequently acted all around the prison, outside of rehearsals, and the prison life becomes indistinguishable from the play.

The main plot device in &quot;Repo! The Genetic Opera&quot; is an opera which is going to be held the night of the events of the film. All of the principal characters of the film play a role in the opera, though the audience watching the opera is unaware that some of the events portrayed are more than drama. The 1990 biopic &quot;Korczak&quot;, about the last days of a Jewish children&#x27;s orphanage in Nazi occupied Poland, features an amateur production of Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s &quot;The Post Office&quot;, which was selected by the orphanage&#x27;s visionary leader as a way of preparing his charges for their own impending death. That same production is also featured in the stage play &quot;Korczak&#x27;s Children,&quot; also inspired by the same historical events.

==== TV show within a film ====
The 1973 film &quot;The National Health&quot;, an adaptation of the 1969 play &quot;The National Health&quot; by Peter Nichols, features a send-up of a typical American hospital soap opera being shown on a television situated in an underfunded, unmistakably British NHS hospital.

The Jim Carrey film &quot;The Truman Show&quot; is about a person who grows to adulthood without ever realizing that he is the unwitting hero of the immersive eponymous television show.

In &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, the lead character Woody learns that he is based on the lead character of the same name of a 1950s Western show known as &quot;Woody&#x27;s Roundup&quot;, which was seemingly cancelled due to the rise of science fiction, though this is eventually debunked after the final episode of the show can be seen playing.

=== Nested video games ===

The first example of a video game within a video game is almost certainly Tim Stryker&#x27;s 1980s era text-only game &quot;Fazuul&quot; (also the world&#x27;s first online multiplayer game), in which one of the objects that the player can create is a minigame. Another early use of this trope was in Cliff Johnson&#x27;s 1987 hit &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot;, a thematically linked narrative puzzle game, in which several of the puzzles were semi-independent games played against NPCs.

&quot;Power Factor&quot; has been cited as a rare example of a video game in which the entire concept is a video game within a video game: The player takes on the role of a character who is playing a &quot;Virtual Reality Simulator&quot;, in which he in turn takes on the role of the hero Redd Ace. The &quot;.hack&quot; franchise also gives the concept a central role. It features a narrative in which internet advancements have created an MMORPG franchise called The World. Protagonists Kite and Haseo try to uncover the mysteries of the events surrounding The World. Characters in &quot;.hack&quot; are aware that they are video game characters.

More commonly, however, the video game within a video game device takes the form of mini-games that are non-plot-oriented, and optional to the completion of the game. For example, in the &quot;Yakuza&quot; and &quot;Shenmue&quot; franchises, there are playable arcade machines featuring other Sega games that are scattered throughout the game world.

In &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; there are several video games that can be played in an arcade in the Gold Saucer theme park. In &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, the player can acquire individual NES emulations through various means and place them within their house, where they are playable in their entirety. When placed in the house, the games take the form of a Nintendo Entertainment System. In &quot;Fallout 4&quot; and &quot;Fallout 76&quot;, the protagonist can find several cartridges throughout the wasteland that can be played on their pip-boy (an electronic device that exists only in the world of the game) or any terminal computer.

==== TV show within a video game ====
In the Remedy video game titled &quot;Max Payne&quot;, players can chance upon a number of ongoing television shows when activating or happening upon various television sets within the game environs, depending on where they are within the unfolding game narrative. Among them are &quot;Lords &amp; Ladies&quot;, &quot;Captain Baseball Bat Boy&quot;, &quot;Dick Justice&quot; and the pinnacle television serial &quot;Address Unknown&quot; – heavily inspired by David Lynch-style film narrative, particularly &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, &quot;Address Unknown&quot; sometimes prophesies events or character motives yet to occur in the Max Payne narrative.

In &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;, the player can watch several TV channels which include many programs: reality shows, cartoons, and even game shows.

=== Nested TV shows ===

&quot;Terrance &amp; Phillip&quot; from &quot;South Park&quot; comments on the levels of violence and acceptable behaviour in the media and allow criticism of the outer cartoon to be addressed in the cartoon itself. Similarly, on the long running animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Bart&#x27;s favorite cartoon, &quot;Itchy and Scratchy&quot; (a parody of &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry&quot;), often echoes the plotlines of the main show. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; also parodied this structure with numerous &#x27;layers&#x27; of sub-stories in the Season 17 episode &quot;The Seemingly Never-Ending Story&quot;.

The animated series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; features numerous fictional shows, most notably, &quot;The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy,&quot; which stars the titular elderly superheroes Mermaid Man (Ernest Borgnine) and Barnacle Boy (Tim Conway).

On the show &quot;Dear White People&quot;, the &quot;Scandal&quot; parody &quot;Defamation&quot; offers an ironic commentary on the main show&#x27;s theme of interracial relationships. Similarly, each season of the HBO show &quot;Insecure&quot; has featured a different fictional show, including the slavery-era soap opera &quot;Due North&quot;, the rebooted black 1990s sitcom &quot;Kev&#x27;yn,&quot; and the investigative documentary series &quot;Looking for LaToya&quot;.

The Irish television series &quot;Father Ted&quot; features a television show, &quot;Father Ben&quot;, which has characters and storylines almost identical to that of &quot;Father Ted&quot;.

The television shows &quot;30 Rock&quot;, &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Sonny with a Chance&quot;, and &quot;Kappa Mikey&quot; feature a sketch show within the TV show.

An extended plotline on the semi-autobiographical sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; dealt with the main characters developing a sitcom about their lives. The gag was reprised on &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, another semi-autobiographical show by and about &quot;Seinfeld&quot; co-creator Larry David, when the long-anticipated &quot;Seinfeld&quot; reunion was staged entirely inside the new show.

The &quot;USS Callister&quot; episode of the &quot;Black Mirror&quot; anthology television series is about a man who is obsessed with a &quot;Star Trek&quot;-like show and recreates it as part of a virtual reality game.

The concept of a film within a television series is employed in the Macross universe. &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?&quot; (1984) was originally intended as an alternative theatrical re-telling of the television series &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; (1982), but was later &quot;retconned&quot; into the Macross canon as a popular film within the television series &quot;Macross 7&quot; (1994).

The &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; episode &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot; features a fictional TV show with an almost identical premise to &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. A later episode, &quot;200&quot;, depicts ideas for a possible reboot of &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot;, including using a &quot;younger and edgier&quot; cast, or even Thunderbirds-style puppets.

The &quot;Glee&quot; episode &quot;Extraordinary Merry Christmas&quot; features the members of New Directions starring in a black-and-white Christmas television special that is presented within the episode itself. The special is a homage to both &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; and the &quot;Judy Garland Christmas Special&quot;.

The British TV series &quot;Don&#x27;t Hug Me I&#x27;m Scared&quot;, based on the web series &quot;Don&#x27;t Hug Me I&#x27;m Scared&quot;, is notable for being a puppet show that includes a fictional claymation TV series within the show: &quot;Grolton &amp; Hovris&quot;, a parody of &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot;.

==== Film within a TV show ====
&quot;Seinfeld&quot; had a number of reoccurring fictional films, including a sci-fi film called &quot;The Flaming Globes of Sigmund&quot; and, most notably, &quot;Rochelle, Rochelle&quot;, a parody of artsy but exploitative foreign films. The trippy, metaphysically loopy thriller &quot;Death Castle&quot; is a central element of the &quot;Master of None&quot; episode &quot;New York, I Love You&quot;.

The series finale of &quot;Barry&quot; features a biopic of the titular character which was called &#x27;The Mask Collector&quot;, and its production served as the catalyst for the last 4 episodes of &quot;Barry&quot; final season.

== Fantasy within realism ==
Stories inside stories can allow for genre changes. Arthur Ransome uses the device to let his young characters in the &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; series of children&#x27;s books, set in the recognisable everyday world, take part in fantastic adventures of piracy in distant lands: two of the twelve books, &quot;Peter Duck&quot; and &quot;Missee Lee&quot; (and some would include &quot;Great Northern?&quot; as a third), are adventures supposedly made up by the characters. Similarly, the film version of &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; uses a story within a story format to tell a purely fantastic fairy tale within a relatively more realistic frame-story. The film version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; does the same thing by making its inner story into a dream. Lewis Carroll&#x27;s celebrated &quot;Alice&quot; books use the same device of a dream as an excuse for fantasy, while Carroll&#x27;s less well-known &quot;Sylvie and Bruno&quot; subverts the trope by allowing the dream figures to enter and interact with the &quot;real&quot; world. In each episode of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, the main story was realistic fiction, with live action human characters, while an inner story took place in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, in which most characters were puppets, except Lady Aberlin and occasionally Mr. McFeely, played by Betty Aberlin and David Newell in both realms.

== Fractal fiction ==

Some stories feature what might be called a literary version of the Droste effect, where an image contains a smaller version of itself (also a common feature in many fractals). An early version is found in an ancient Chinese proverb, in which an old monk situated in a temple found on a high mountain recursively tells the same story to a younger monk about an old monk who tells a younger monk a story regarding an old monk sitting in a temple located on a high mountain, and so on. The same concept is at the heart of Michael Ende&#x27;s classic children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Neverending Story&quot;, which prominently features a book of the same title. This is later revealed to be the same book the audience is reading, when it begins to be retold again from the beginning, thus creating an infinite regression that features as a plot element. Another story that includes versions of itself is Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman: Worlds&#x27; End&quot; which contains several instances of multiple storytelling levels, including &quot;Cerements&quot; (issue #55) where one of the inmost levels corresponds to one of the outer levels, turning the story-within-a-story structure into an infinite regression. Jesse Ball&#x27;s &quot;The Way Through Doors&quot; features a deeply nested set of stories within stories, most of which explore alternate versions of the main characters. The frame device is that the main character is telling stories to a woman in a coma (similar to Almodóvar&#x27;s &quot;Talk to Her&quot;, mentioned above).

Richard Adams&#x27; classic Watership Down includes several memorable tales about the legendary prince of rabbits, El-Ahraira, as told by master storyteller, Dandelion.

Samuel Delany&#x27;s great surrealist sci-fi classic &quot;Dhalgren&quot; features the main character discovering a diary apparently written by a version of himself, with incidents that usually reflect, but sometimes contrast with the main narrative. The last section of the book is taken up entirely by journal entries, about which readers must choose whether to take as completing the narrator&#x27;s own story. Similarly, in Kiese Laymon&#x27;s &quot;Long Division&quot;, the main character discovers a book, also called &quot;Long Division&quot;, featuring what appears to be himself, except as living twenty years earlier. The title book in Charles Yu&#x27;s &quot;How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe&quot; exists within itself as a stable creation of a closed loop in time. Likewise, in the Will Ferrell comedy &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot; the main character discovers he is a character in a book that (along with its author) also exists in the same universe. The 1979 book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot; by Douglas Hofstadter includes a narrative between Achilles and the Tortoise (characters borrowed from Lewis Carroll, who in turn borrowed them from Zeno), and within this story they find the book &quot;Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe&quot;, which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of the Tortoise, and Achilles taking the part of Achilles. Within this self-referential narrative, the two characters find the book &quot;Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe&quot;, which they begin to read, this time each taking the other&#x27;s part. The 1979 experimental novel &quot;If on a winter&#x27;s night a traveler&quot; by Italo Calvino follows a reader, addressed in the second person, trying to read the very same book, but being interrupted by ten other recursively nested incomplete stories.

Robert Altman&#x27;s satirical Hollywood noir &quot;The Player&quot; ends with the antihero being pitched a movie version of his own story, complete with an unlikely happy ending. The long-running musical &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; dramatizes its own creation, and the life stories of its own original cast members. The famous final number does double duty as the showstopper for both the musical the audience is watching and the one the characters are appearing in. &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; begins with an action film opening, which turns out to be a sequence being filmed by Steven Spielberg. Near the ending, the events of the film itself are revealed to be a movie being enjoyed by the characters. Jim Henson&#x27;s &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; is framed as a screening of the movie itself, and the screenplay for the movie is present inside the movie, which ends with an abstracted, abbreviated re-staging of its own events. The 1985 Tim Burton film &quot;Pee-Wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; ends with the main characters watching a film version of their own adventures, but as reimagined as a Hollywood blockbuster action film, with James Brolin as a more stereotypically manly version of the Paul Reubens title character. Episode 14 of the anime series &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot; is essentially a clip show, but has several newly animated segments based on &quot;Gekigangar III&quot;, an anime that exists within its universe and that many characters are fans of, that involves the characters of that show watching Nadesico. The episode ends with the crew of the Nadesico watching the very same episode of Gekigangar, causing a paradox. Mel Brooks&#x27;s 1974 comedy &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; leaves its Western setting when the climactic fight scene breaks out, revealing the setting to have been a set in the Warner Bros. studio lot; the fight spills out onto an adjacent musical set, then into the studio canteen, and finally onto the streets. The two protagonists arrive at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre, which is showing the &quot;premiere&quot; of &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;; they enter the cinema to watch the conclusion of their own film. Brooks recycled the gag in his 1987 &quot;Star Wars&quot; parody, &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, where the villains are able to locate the heroes by watching a copy of the movie they are in on VHS video tape (a comic exaggeration of the phenomenon of films being available on video before their theatrical release). Brooks also made the 1976 parody &quot;Silent Movie&quot; about a buffoonish team of filmmakers trying to make the first Hollywood silent film in forty years—which is essentially that film itself (another forty years later, life imitated art imitating art, when an actual modern silent movie became a hit, the Oscar winner &quot;The Artist&quot;).

The film-within-a-film format is used in the &quot;Scream&quot; horror series. In &quot;Scream 2&quot;, the opening scene takes place in a movie theater where a screening of &quot;Stab&quot; is played which depicts the events from the first film. In between the events of &quot;Scream 2&quot; and &quot;Scream 3&quot;, a second film was released called &quot;Stab 2&quot;. &quot;Scream 3&quot; is about the actors filming a fictional third installment in the Stab series. The actors playing the trilogy&#x27;s characters end up getting killed, much in the same way as the characters they are playing on screen and in the same order. In between the events of &quot;Scream 3&quot; and &quot;Scream 4&quot;, four other Stab films are released. In the opening sequence of &quot;Scream 4&quot; two characters are watching &quot;Stab 7&quot; before they get killed. There&#x27;s also a party in which all seven Stab movies were going to be shown. References are also made to &quot;Stab 5&quot; involving time travel as a plot device. In the fifth installment of the series, also named &quot;Scream&quot;, an eighth Stab film is mentioned having been released before the film takes place. The characters in the film, several of which are fans of the series, heavily criticize the film, similar to how &quot;Scream 4&quot; was criticized. Additionally, late in the film, Mindy watches the first Stab by herself. During the depiction of Ghostface sneaking up behind Randy on the couch from the first film in Stab, Ghostface sneaks up on Mindy and attacks and stabs her.

Director Spike Jonze&#x27;s &quot;Adaptation&quot; is a fictionalized version of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s struggles to adapt the non-cinematic book &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot; into a Hollywood blockbuster. As his onscreen self succumbs to the temptation to commercialize the narrative, Kaufman incorporates those techniques into the script, including tropes such as an invented romance, a car chase, a drug-running sequence, and an imaginary identical twin for the protagonist. (The movie also features scenes about the making of &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, previously written by Kaufman and directed by Jonze.) Similarly, in Kaufman&#x27;s self-directed 2008 film &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot;, the main character Caden Cotard is a skilled director of plays who receives a grant, and ends up creating a remarkable theater piece intended as a carbon copy of the outside world. The layers of copies of the world ends up several layers deep. The same conceit was previously used by frequent Kaufman collaborator Michel Gondry in his music video for the Björk song &quot;Bachelorette&quot;, which features a musical that is about, in part, the creation of that musical. A mini-theater and small audience appear on stage to watch the musical-within-a-musical, and at some point, within that second musical a yet-smaller theater and audience appear.

Fractal fiction is sometimes utilized in video games to play with the concept of player choice: In the first chapter of &quot;Stories Untold&quot;, the player is required to play a text adventure, which eventually becomes apparent to be happening in the same environment the player is in; in &quot;Superhot&quot; the narrative itself is constructed around the player playing a game called Superhot.

== From story within a story to separate story ==
Occasionally, a story within a story becomes such a popular element that the producer(s) decide to develop it autonomously as a separate and distinct work. This is an example of a spin-off. Such spin-offs may be produced as a way of providing additional information on the fictional world for fans.

In &quot;Homestuck&quot; by Andrew Hussie, there is a comic called Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff, created by one of the characters, Dave Strider. It was later adapted to its own ongoing series.

In the &quot;Toy Story&quot; film universe, Buzz Lightyear is an animated toy action figure, which was based on a fictitious cartoon series, &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot;, which did not exist in the real world except for snippets seen within &quot;Toy Story&quot;. Later, &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot; was produced in the real world and was itself later joined by &quot;Lightyear&quot;, a film described as the source material for the toy and cartoon series.

&quot;Kujibiki Unbalance&quot;, a series in the &quot;Genshiken&quot; universe, has spawned merchandise of its own, and been remade into a series on its own.

In the animated online franchise &quot;Homestar Runner&quot;, many of the best-known features were spun off from each other. The best known was &quot;Strong Bad Emails&quot;, which depicted the villain of the original story giving snarky answers to fan emails, but that in turn spawned several other long-running features which started out as figments of Strong Bad&#x27;s imagination, including the teen-oriented cartoon parody &quot;Teen Girl Squad&quot; and the anime parody &quot;20X6&quot;.

In the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, three such supplemental books have been produced: &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot;, a guidebook used by the characters; &quot;Quidditch Through the Ages&quot;, a book from the school library; and &quot;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&quot;, presenting fairy tales told to children of the wizarding world.

<doc id="83496" wikidata="Q1332528" url="?curid=83496" title="Capital punishment by country">
<text>Capital punishment, also called the death penalty, is the state-sanctioned killing of a person as a punishment for a crime. It has historically been used in almost every part of the world. Since the mid-19th century many countries have abolished or discontinued the practice. In , the five countries that executed the most people were, in descending order, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United States.

The 193 United Nations member states and two observer states fall into four categories based on their use of capital punishment. :

*53 (27%) maintain the death penalty in law and practice.
*23 (12%) permit its use but have abolished it &quot;de facto:&quot; per Amnesty International standards, they have not used it for at least 10 years &quot;and&quot; are believed to have a policy or practice of not carrying out executions.
*9 (5%) have abolished it for all crimes except those committed under exceptional circumstances (such as during war).
*110 (56%) have completely abolished it, most recently Zimbabwe (2024).
In addition, Cook Islands, Niue, and Kosovo are abolitionist whereas Taiwan is retentionist.

Since 1990, at least 11 countries have executed offenders who were minors (under the age of 18 or 21) at the time the crime was committed, which is a breach of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by all countries but the United States. These are China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Sudan, Sudan, the United States, and Yemen. In the United States, this ended in 2005 with the Supreme Court case &quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot;, in Nigeria in 2015 by law, and in Saudi Arabia in 2020 by royal decree.

==Global overview==
===Africa===
In Africa, many countries maintain the death penalty in law. Some such countries, such as Algeria and Cameroon, have moratoriums and have not used it for over a decade, making them abolitionist in practice. In Nigeria, some states are &quot;de facto&quot; abolitionist while others are retentionist. 

In 2018, Burkina Faso repealed the death penalty for civilian crimes, and the Gambia announced a moratorium as a first step towards abolition. Sierra Leone abolished capital punishment in 2021, as did the Central African Republic in 2022, followed by Zimbabwe in 2024. For civilian crimes, Equatorial Guinea and Zambia abolished it in 2022, and Ghana did so in 2023.

===Americas===
Since 2008, the United States has been the only country in the Americas to carry out executions. In Caribbean countries, the death penalty exists at least &quot;de jure&quot;, except in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which abolished it in 1969 and 1987, respectively. Grenada is abolitionist in practice; its last execution was in 1978. The last execution in the Caribbean was in Saint Kitts and Nevis, in 2008. In Central and South America, the death penalty exists in Belize and Guyana, though it has not been used since 1985 and 1997. In Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Peru, executions are legal in some circumstances, such as war crimes, and were abolished for civil crimes. In 1976, Canada abolished the death penalty for non-military offences; in 1999, it abolished it for military offences. In 2005, Mexico abolished the death penalty; in 2009 Argentina abolished it.

===Asia===
China is the world&#x27;s most active user of the death penalty; according to Amnesty International, China executes more people than the rest of the world combined, each year; but the death penalty for all crimes do not apply to the two special administrative regions, Hong Kong and Macau. In December 2015, Mongolia repealed the death penalty for all crimes.

India rarely executes criminals, carrying out just 30 executions since 1991. India most recently executed 4 perpetrators of a gang rape and murder case in March 2020.

Japan sometimes executes criminals, carrying out 130 executions since 1993. Japan most recently executed Tomohiro Katō in July 2022.

According to a 2017 report by the National Human Rights Commission from Myanmar, over 700 prisoners in 26 prisons across the country had death sentences commuted to life imprisonment.

Singapore resumed executions in March 2022 after a two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Singapore came under scrutiny for executing drug traffickers in several high-profile cases, including Nagaenthran Dharmalingam who was hanged in April 2022, and Tangaraju Suppiah who was hanged in April 2023. In July 2023, a convicted drug trafficker named Saridewi binte Djamani was executed, becoming the first female offender hanged in Singapore in 19 years, after the 2004 hanging of Yen May Woen. Singapore&#x27;s first execution for murder since 2019 was carried out in February 2024, when Bangladeshi painter Ahmed Salim was hanged for murdering his ex-girlfriend in 2018.

===Europe===

The European Union holds a strong position against the death penalty; its abolition is a key objective for the Union&#x27;s human rights policy. Abolition is also a pre-condition for entry into the European Union. In Europe, only Belarus continues to actively use capital punishment.

Capital punishment has been completely abolished in all European countries except for Belarus and Russia, the latter of which has a moratorium and has not conducted an execution since 1996. The absolute ban on the death penalty is enshrined in both the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (EU) and two widely adopted protocols of the European Convention on Human Rights of the Council of Europe, and is thus considered a central value. Of all present European countries, San Marino, Portugal and the Netherlands were the first to abolish capital punishment; Romania banned it even earlier in 1864, but it was much later reintroduced from 1936 to 1990 during the dictatorial and communist eras; in Italy the nationwide ban on the death penalty dates from 1889 (capital punishment had previously not been in force in Tuscany alone since 1859, and even earlier for short periods starting from 1786), but it was then reintroduced during the fascist regime; now only Belarus still uses capital punishment. In 2012, Latvia became the last EU member state to abolish capital punishment in wartime.

===Post-Soviet states===

Russia retains the death penalty in law, but there has been a moratorium since 1996, making it &quot;de facto&quot; abolitionist. The last execution on Russian territory was in Chechnya in 1999. Of the other former Soviet republics, only Belarus and Tajikistan have not formally abolished capital punishment, and only Belarus uses it in practice. In 2000, Ukraine abolished the death penalty completely (in peace and wartime), as did Kazakhstan in June 2022.

===Oceania===
The Kingdom of Tahiti (when the island was independent) was the first legislative assembly in the world to abolish the death penalty in 1824. Tahiti commuted the death penalty to banishment. Nearly all countries in this region have abolished the death penalty as a form of punishment, and the last country that still has it in law (Tonga) has not used it since 1982 and is considered de facto abolitionist. Australia abolished the death penalty completely in 1985.

===Human Development Index===
There are 65 sovereign states with a very high human development according to the 2021/2022 Human Development Report. Of these:

*14 (22%) maintain the death penalty in both law and practice: Singapore, Japan, the United States, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, the Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago, Belarus, Malaysia, and Thailand.
*3 (5%) permit its use, but have not used it for at least 10 years and are believed to have a policy or established practice of not carrying out executions: South Korea, Brunei, and Russia.
*2 (3%) have abolished it for all crimes except those committed under exceptional circumstances (such as during war): Israel and Chile.
*46 (71%) have completely abolished it, including Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.

Singapore has the highest Human Development Index of all the countries that use the death penalty, while Japan has both the highest inequality-adjusted HDI and the highest planetary pressures–adjusted HDI.

===Developed countries===
As of 2022, 36 of the 40 countries and territories that are classified by the IMF as developed countries (advanced economies), including China&#x27;s Special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau have completely abolished the death penalty. Only the United States, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan retain the death penalty for ordinary crimes, and Israel for crimes under exceptional circumstances (such as during war).

===Numbers executed in 2022===
At least 21 countries performed executions in :

* Americas (1 country): United States (18)
* Asia (13 countries): Afghanistan (unknown), Bangladesh (4), China (unknown), Iran (596+), Iraq (unknown), Japan (1), Kuwait (7), North Korea (unknown), Saudi Arabia (146), Singapore (11), Syria (unknown), Vietnam (unknown), Yemen (1)
* Africa (3 countries): Egypt (unknown), Somalia (19), South Sudan (2)

Precise numbers are unavailable for some countries, so the total number of executions is unknown. Other countries, like Myanmar and Libya, have conducted extrajudicial executions.

==Capital punishment by continents==
===Africa===
There are 54 United Nations member states in Africa. Of these:

*12 (22%) maintain the death penalty in both law and practice.
*14 (26%) permit its use but have not used it for at least 10 years and are believed to have a policy of not carrying out executions.
*4 (7%) have abolished it for all crimes except those committed under exceptional circumstances (such as during war).
*24 (44%) have completely abolished it.

Many African countries have carried out no executions for over 10 years, but are not believed to have an abolitionist policy or established practice.

Nigeria is only retentionist in the northern states that use sharia law, and in some southern states such as Imo. Many southern states are abolitionist in practice due to a moratorium that has been in place since 2004.

The countries in Africa that most recently abolished the death penalty are Ghana (2023), Zambia (2022) and Equatorial Guinea (2022) for ordinary crimes, Zimbabwe (2024), Central African Republic (2022) and Sierra Leone (2021) for all crimes.

Executions in Africa in 2019: Botswana (1), Egypt (29+), Somalia (13+), South Sudan (7+).


===Americas===
There are 35 United Nations member states in the Americas. Of these:

*13 (37%) maintain the death penalty in both law and practice.
*1 (3%) permits its use, but has not used it for at least 10 years and is believed to have a policy or established practice of not carrying out executions.
*5 (14%) have abolished it for all crimes except those committed under exceptional circumstances (such as during war).
*16 (46%) have completely abolished it.

Many Caribbean countries have carried out no executions for over 10 years, but are not believed to have an abolitionist policy or established practice.

As of 2024, the United States is the only country in the Americas to conduct executions for civil purposes. Capital punishment applies nationwide on the federal level, for certain federal crimes, and in the Military. However, most capital crimes are prosecuted at the state level. Twenty-three of the fifty states and the federal district have abolished capital punishment entirely. Five states and the Federal Government have imposed formal moratoriums, and three of them are classifiable as &quot;abolitionist in practice&quot; according to the United Nations criteria, having passed a period of over ten years without executions.

Outside of the United States, the last execution elsewhere in the Americas was in Saint Kitts and Nevis in 2008.

The countries in the Americas that most recently abolished the death penalty are Suriname (2015), Argentina (2009), and Bolivia (2009). Guatemala abolished the death penalty for civil cases in 2017.

Executions in the Americas in 2019: United States (22).



===Asia===
There are 42 United Nations member states in Asia, and one observer state. Of these:

*27 (63%) maintain the death penalty in both law and practice.
*5 (12%) permit its use for ordinary crimes, but have not used it for at least 10 years and are believed to have a policy or established practice of not carrying out executions.
*1 (2%) has abolished it for all crimes except those committed under exceptional circumstances (such as during war).
*10 (23%) have completely abolished it.

The information above does not include Taiwan, which is not a UN member. Taiwan practices the death penalty by shooting, and conducted one execution each in 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2025.

Hong Kong and Macau are listed below (they abolished the death penalty before their handover to China), but they are not included in the figures above as they do not have UN membership separate from China. This makes China retentionist only in the mainland.

On 25 July 2022, because of Myanmar&#x27;s civil war between the military junta (who rule most areas of the country) and the civilian government it overthrew, the junta carried out executions making them the first executions since 1988, making the country retentionist in areas controlled by the Tatmadaw. Under the civilian government (who internationally and according to the UN remain the legal government) and in areas controlled by it the country continues to be abolitionist in practice.

Iraq also has a regional variety of retentionism and abolitionism, as Iraqi Kurdistan is &quot;de facto&quot; abolitionist for ordinary crimes due to a moratorium that has been in place since 2007. The rest of Iraq (the majority of the country) is fully retentionist.

Indonesia has an informal moratorium and Malaysia a formal one, both in place since 2018. In April 2023, legislation abolishing the mandatory death penalty was passed in Malaysia.

The countries in Asia that most recently abolished the death penalty are Kazakhstan (2021), Mongolia (2017), and Uzbekistan (2008).

In 2019, Asia had the world&#x27;s five leading practitioners of capital punishment: China, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam. Executions in Asia in 2019: Bahrain (3), Bangladesh (2), China (1000+), Iran (256+), Japan (3), North Korea (Unknown), Pakistan (20+), Saudi Arabia (184+), Singapore (4), Syria (Unknown), Vietnam (Unknown), Yemen (7+).



===Europe===

There are 48 United Nations member states in Europe, and one observer state. Of these:

*1 (2%) maintains the death penalty in both law and practice.
*1 (2%) permits its use for ordinary crimes, but has not used it for at least 10 years and is believed to have a policy or established practice of not carrying out executions.
*47 (96%) have completely abolished it.

Abolition of death penalty is a pre-condition for entry into the European Union, which considers capital punishment a &quot;cruel and inhuman&quot; practice and &quot;not been shown in any way to act as a deterrent to crime&quot;.

Since 1999, Belarus has been the only recognized country in Europe to carry out executions. 2009, 2015, 2020 are the first three years in recorded history when Europe was completely free of executions.

The countries in Europe that most recently abolished the death penalty are Bosnia and Herzegovina (2019), Latvia (2012), and Albania (2007).

Executions in Europe in 2019: Belarus (2+).



===Oceania===
There are 14 member states of the United Nations in Oceania. Of these:

*1 (7%) permits its use for ordinary crimes, but has not used it for at least 10 years and is believed to have a policy or established practice of not carrying out executions.
*13 (93%) have completely abolished it.

Only Tonga has not formally abolished capital punishment despite not using the practice since 1982.

The countries in Oceania that most recently abolished the death penalty are Papua New Guinea (2022), Nauru (2016), and Fiji (2015).



==Abolition chronology==
The table below lists in chronological order the 109 UN member or observer states that have completely abolished the death penalty. In the century after the abolition of capital punishment by Venezuela in 1863, only 11 more countries followed, not counting temporary abolitions that were later reversed. From the 1960s onwards, abolition accelerated: 4 countries abolished capital punishment in the 1960s (a record up to that time for any decade), 11 in the 1970s, and 10 in the 1980s. After the Cold War, many more countries followed: 36 countries abolished capital punishment in the 1990s, with 9 in 1990 alone, 23 in the 2000s, 11 in the 2010s, and 7 so far in the 2020s. Since 1985, there have been only 6 years when no country has abolished the death penalty: 2001, 2003, 2011, 2013, 2018 and 2023.

When a country has abolished, re-instated, and abolished again (e.g. Philippines, Switzerland, Portugal, Italy) only the later abolition date is included. Countries which have abolished and since reinstated it and have yet to abolish it again (e.g. Liberia, Malawi) are excluded altogether. Dependent territories are considered being under the jurisdiction of their parent country – which leads to unexpectedly late abolition dates for the UK, New Zealand and the Netherlands, where Jersey (UK), the Cook Is (NZ), and the Netherlands Antilles, were the last territories of those states to abolish capital punishment, and all were later than the abolitions on the respective mainlands. References are in the continental tables above and not repeated here. Federal countries such as the United States where it has not been abolished everywhere do not appear, even if some jurisdictions in that country have abolished the death penalty.

<text>The Wise Little Hen is a 1934 Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; cartoon, based on the fable &quot;The Little Red Hen.&quot; The cartoon features the debut of Donald Duck, dancing to &quot;The Sailor&#x27;s Hornpipe&quot;. Donald and his friend Peter Pig try to avoid work by faking stomach aches until Mrs. Hen teaches them the value of labor.

==Plot==
The Wise Little Hen of the title is looking for someone to help her plant her corn for the winter. Peter Pig and Donald Duck both feign belly aches to get out of the chore, since they would rather play than work. With help from her chicks, she plants it herself. Harvest time comes; again, Peter and Donald claim belly aches, but the hen sees through this when boards of their clubhouse fall off showing their little act when they shake hands with each other for evading responsibility. Upon wising up to their ruse, she and her chicks wink at each other upon knowing what to do with Peter and Donald later. She cooks up a tantalizing assortment of corn dishes, and heads over to Peter and Donald to help her eat them, but before she can open her mouth, they already fake their belly aches. Once she asks them to help her eat the corn, they snap out of their façade and are excited to eat, but all she gives them is castor oil. As the hen and her chicks eat the corn themselves, Peter and Donald repent with all their might by kicking each other in the rump.

==Cast==
* Florence Gill - The Wise Little Hen
* Clarence Nash - Donald Duck, Peter Pig
* Pinto Colvig - Peter Pig (moaning noises)

== Production ==
Though distributor United Artists gave June 9, 1934 as the cartoon&#x27;s release date, it was actually first shown on May 3, 1934, at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles for a benefit program, while it was later given its official debut on June 7 at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City as a short subject to its showing of &quot;Sisters Under the Skin&quot;.

This cartoon featured the first appearance of Clarence Nash in a Disney production. Nash had been a performer in Chautauqua and vaudeville during the 1920s and later met Wilfred Jackson who wanted Nash to provide bird sounds for a cartoon. During the call, Nash performed a rendition of &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; as a duck, and Jackson sent the music into Walt Disney&#x27;s office. Disney himself proclaimed &quot;[t]hat&#x27;s our talking duck&quot;.

The short was animated by Art Babbitt, Dick Huemer, Clyde Geronimi, Louie Schmitt, and Frenchy de Tremaudan (with assistance from a group of junior animators headed by Ben Sharpsteen) and directed by Wilfred Jackson. Animation on the hen was done by Wolfgang Reitherman and supervised by Ben Sharpsteen. Art Babbitt worked on Peter Pig and Donald Duck. Ward Kimball worked as an inbetweener on this short. The song featured in the short, &quot;Help Me Plant My Corn&quot; was written by Leigh Harline.

==Theatrical release==
&quot;The Wise Little Hen&quot; had its world premiere as the underbill to &quot;Gulliver Mickey&quot; at the Carthay Circle Theater in Los Angeles, California, on May 3, 1934.

==Adaptations==
The &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; Sunday comic strip ran a three-month-long adaptation of &quot;The Wise Little Hen&quot; from September 16 to December 16, 1934. The story was adapted by Ted Osborne and Al Taliaferro, and it also was Donald Duck&#x27;s first appearance in Disney comics.

The 1962 storybook &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Story Land: 55 Favorite Stories&quot; featured an adaptation of the cartoon called &quot;Mrs. Cackle&#x27;s Corn&quot;. In this version, Clara Cluck is telling the story. By 1962, Donald Duck was thought unsuitable for a bit part in a fairy tale, so they use Daniel Duck instead. Patsy Pig was substituted for Peter Pig.

== Analysis ==
Dr. Tracey Mollet suggests that the short&#x27;s narrative reflects the economic reality of the time, the Great Depression, and President Roosevelt&#x27;s efforts to bolster the agricultural sector. Mollet surmises that Peter Pig and Donald Duck&#x27;s actions, not helping to cultivate and harvest crops, is a rejection of &quot;early New Deal policy of self-sufficiency in farming&quot;. The short reinforces the belief in New Deal policy by having Donald and Peter pay a consequence for their rugged individualism by being fed castor oil as the Hen and her chicks eat their crops. The featured song also draws upon contemporary elements as it references the &quot;harsh weather [that] had antagonized the crises in the rural sector&quot; across the 1933-1934 winter as the Hen seeks to grow corn &quot;so she is &#x27;not left short when winter comes again&#x27;&quot;. The short&#x27;s end reinforces the &quot;self-sufficiency of the hen&quot; in contrast to &quot;Donald and Peter&#x27;s laziness [which] is punished as they are left hungry&quot;.

==Home media==
The short has been released several times on home media. The first release was in 1986 on Betamax on &quot;Donald Duck Volume 1&quot;. It was released in 1989 on VHS, Beta, and Laserdisc on &quot;Mickey Mouse &amp; Donald Duck Volume 2&quot;. It was re-released on those same three formats in 1991 on &quot;Donald Duck&#x27;s 50th Birthday&quot;.

It was released on December 4, 2001, on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: Silly Symphonies - The Historic Musical Animated Classics&quot;, and on May 18, 2004, on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: The Chronological Donald, Volume One: 1934-1941&quot;.

The film&#x27;s copyright was renewed in 1961, so it will enter the public domain on January 1, 2030.

<doc id="83499" wikidata="Q272855" url="?curid=83499" title="Kazuo Ishiguro">
<text>is a Japanese-born British novelist, screenwriter, musician, and short-story writer. He is one of the most critically acclaimed contemporary fiction authors writing in English, having been awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Literature. In its citation, the Swedish Academy described Ishiguro as a writer &quot;who, in novels of great emotional force, has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world&quot;.

Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki, Japan, and moved to Britain in 1960 with his parents when he was five. His first two novels, &quot;A Pale View of Hills&quot; and &quot;An Artist of the Floating World&quot;, were noted for their explorations of Japanese identity and their mournful tone. He thereafter explored other genres, including science fiction and historical fiction.

He has been nominated for the Booker Prize four times, winning in 1989 for &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;, which was adapted into a film of the same name in 1993. Salman Rushdie praised the novel as Ishiguro&#x27;s masterpiece, in which he &quot;turned away from the Japanese settings of his first two novels and revealed that his sensibility was not rooted in any one place, but capable of travel and metamorphosis&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; named Ishiguro&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; as the best novel of 2005 and one of the 100 best English-language novels published between 1923 and 2005. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for the 2022 film &quot;Living&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki, Japan, on 8 November 1954, the son of Shizuo Ishiguro, a physical oceanographer, and his wife, Shizuko. In 1960, Ishiguro moved with his family to Guildford, Surrey, as his father was invited for research at the National Institute of Oceanography (now the National Oceanography Centre). He did not return to visit Japan until 1989, nearly 30 years later, when he was a participant in the Japan Foundation Short-Term Visitors&#x27; Programme.

In an interview with Kenzaburō Ōe, Ishiguro stated that the Japanese settings of his first two novels were imaginary: &quot;I grew up with a very strong image in my head of this other country, a very important other country to which I had a strong emotional tie … In England I was all the time building up this picture in my head, an imaginary Japan.&quot;

Ishiguro, who has been described as a British Asian author, explained in a BBC interview how growing up in a Japanese family in the UK was crucial to his writing, enabling him to see things from a different perspective from that of many of his English peers.

He attended Stoughton Primary School and then Woking County Grammar School in Surrey. Ishiguro sang solos as a choirboy with his church and school choirs. He also enjoyed music as a teenager, listening to the likes of Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell, and particularly Bob Dylan. Ishiguro began learning guitar and writing songs, initially aiming to become a professional songwriter. He says that &quot;for me there&#x27;s always been big overlap between fiction and song. My style as a novelist comes substantially from what I learnt writing songs. The intimate, first-person quality of a singer performing to an audience, for instance, carried over for me into novels. As did the need to approach meaning subtly, sometimes by nudging it into the spaces between the lines.&quot; After finishing school in 1973, he took a gap year and traveled through the United States and Canada, writing a journal and sending demo tapes to record companies. He also worked as a grouse beater, a practice of driven grouse shooting, at Balmoral Castle. Ishiguro later reflected on his ephemeral songwriting career, saying, &quot;I used to see myself as some sort of musician type but there came a point when I thought: actually, this isn&#x27;t me at all. I&#x27;m much less glamorous. I&#x27;m one of these people with corduroy jackets with elbow patches. It was a real comedown.&quot;

In 1974, he began studies at the University of Kent at Canterbury, graduating in 1978 with a Bachelor of Arts (honours) in English and philosophy. After spending a year writing fiction, he resumed his studies at the University of East Anglia where he studied with Malcolm Bradbury and Angela Carter on the UEA Creative Writing Course, gaining the degree of Master of Arts in 1980. His thesis became his first novel, &quot;A Pale View of Hills&quot;, published in 1982.

He gained British citizenship in 1983.

== Career==
=== 1982–1994: Literary beginnings and breakthrough ===
Ishiguro set his first two novels in Japan; however, in several interviews, he said that he has little familiarity with Japanese writing and that his works bear little resemblance to Japanese fiction. &quot;An Artist of the Floating World&quot; (1986) is set in an unnamed Japanese city during the Occupation of Japan following the nation&#x27;s surrender in 1945. The narrator is forced to come to terms with his part in World War II. He is criticized by the younger generation, who hold him responsible for Japan&#x27;s misguided foreign policy. As a result, he is compelled to reevaluate his beliefs in light of the modern ideals represented by his grandson. Ishiguro said of his choice of time period, &quot;I tend to be attracted to pre-war and postwar settings because I&#x27;m interested in this business of values and ideals being tested, and people having to face up to the notion that their ideals weren&#x27;t quite what they thought they were before the test came.&quot;

In an interview in 1989, when discussing his Japanese heritage and its influence on his upbringing, he stated, &quot;I&#x27;m not entirely like English people because I&#x27;ve been brought up by Japanese parents in a Japanese-speaking home. My parents (...) felt responsible for keeping me in touch with Japanese values. I do have a distinct background. I think differently, my perspectives are slightly different.&quot; In a 1990 interview, Ishiguro said, &quot;If I wrote under a pseudonym and got somebody else to pose for my jacket photographs, I&#x27;m sure nobody would think of saying, &#x27;This guy reminds me of that Japanese writer.&#x27;&quot; Although some Japanese writers have had a distant influence on his writing—Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki is the one he most frequently cites—Ishiguro has said that Japanese films, especially those of Yasujirō Ozu and Mikio Naruse, have been a more significant influence.

In 1989 he released his book &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;, set in the large country house of an English lord in the period surrounding World War II. The book received widespread acclaim as well as the Booker Prize for Fiction. The novel was adapted by Merchant Ivory and made into a 1993 film of the same name starring Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.

=== 1995–2018: Established career and acclaim ===

His fourth novel, &quot;The Unconsoled&quot; (1995), takes place in an unnamed Central European city. It received the Cheltenham Prize for Literature. A 2006 poll of various literary critics voted the novel as the third &quot;best British, Irish, or Commonwealth novel from 1980 to 2005&quot;, tied with Anthony Burgess&#x27;s &quot;Earthly Powers&quot;, Salman Rushdie&#x27;s &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot;, Ian McEwan&#x27;s &quot;Atonement&quot;, and Penelope Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Flower&quot;.

Some of Ishiguro&#x27;s novels are set in the past. &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; (2005) has science fiction qualities and a futuristic tone; however, it is set in the 1980s and 1990s, and takes place in a parallel world very similar to ours. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named it the best novel of 2005 and included the novel in its &quot;100 Best English-language novels published since 1923&quot;. The novel was adapted into the 2010 film of the same name starring Keira Knightley, Andrew Garfield, and Carey Mulligan. With the exception of &quot;The Buried Giant&quot; (2015), Ishiguro&#x27;s novels are written in the first-person narrative style.

In 2017, Ishiguro was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, with the motivation &quot;in novels of great emotional force, [he] has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world&quot;. In response to receiving the award, Ishiguro stated:It&#x27;s a magnificent honour, mainly because it means that I&#x27;m in the footsteps of the greatest authors that have lived, so that&#x27;s a terrific commendation. The world is in a very uncertain moment and I would hope all the Nobel Prizes would be a force for something positive in the world as it is at the moment. I&#x27;ll be deeply moved if I could in some way be part of some sort of climate this year in contributing to some sort of positive atmosphere at a very uncertain time. Ishiguro was appointed Knight Bachelor for services to literature in the 2018 Birthday Honours and was later appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 2024 New Year Honours.

=== 2021–present: &quot;Klara and the Sun&quot; and &quot;Living&quot; ===
Ishiguro&#x27;s eighth novel, &quot;Klara and the Sun&quot;, was published by Faber and Faber on 2 March 2021. Rumaan Alam of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote it is &quot;more simple than it seems, less novel than parable.&quot; It was longlisted for the 2021 Booker Prize. In this novel, narrated from the perspective of an &quot;Artificial Friend&quot; named Klara, he discusses subjects such as the dangers of technological advancement, the future of our world, and the meaning of being human that he also broached in his earlier books.

Ishiguro adapted the screenplay for the 2022 British film &quot;Living&quot;, directed by Oliver Hermanus and starring Bill Nighy, from the 1952 Japanese film &quot;Ikiru&quot; directed by Akira Kurosawa. In 2023, &quot;Living&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Adapted Screenplay category.

==Musical work==
Ishiguro has co-written several songs for the jazz singer Stacey Kent with Kent&#x27;s husband, saxophonist Jim Tomlinson. Ishiguro contributed lyrics to Kent&#x27;s 2007 Grammy-nominated album &quot;Breakfast on the Morning Tram&quot;, including its title track, her 2011 album, &quot;Dreamer in Concert&quot;, her 2013 album &quot;The Changing Lights&quot;, and her 2017 album, &quot;I Know I Dream&quot;. Ishiguro also wrote the liner notes to Kent&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;In Love Again&quot;. Ishiguro first met Kent after he chose her recording of &quot;They Can&#x27;t Take That Away from Me&quot; as one of his &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 2002 and Kent subsequently asked him to write for her.

Ishiguro has said of his lyric writing that &quot;with an intimate, confiding, first-person song, the meaning must not be self-sufficient on the page. It has to be oblique, sometimes you have to read between the lines&quot; and that this realisation has had an &quot;enormous influence&quot; on his fiction writing.

In March 2024, Faber &amp; Faber published Ishiguro&#x27;s book, &quot;The Summer We Crossed Europe in the Rain: Lyrics for Stacey Kent&quot;, a collection of 16 of his lyrics for Kent, with illustrations by Italian-French artist, Bianca Bagnarelli.

== Influences ==
Ishiguro counts Dostoyevsky and Proust among his influences. His works have also been compared to Salman Rushdie, Jane Austen, and Henry James, though Ishiguro himself rejects these comparisons. When asked who is his favorite novelist is, he says &quot;Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s recently edged out Dostoevsky...I owe my career, and a lot else besides, to &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and &quot;Villette&quot;.&quot;

==Personal life==
Ishiguro has been married to Lorna MacDougall, a social worker, since 1986. They met at the West London Cyrenians homelessness charity in Notting Hill, where Ishiguro was working as a residential resettlement worker. The couple live in London. Their daughter, Naomi Ishiguro, is also an author, and published the book &quot;Escape Routes&quot;.

He describes himself as a &quot;serious cinephile&quot; and &quot;great admirer of Bob Dylan&quot;. On &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, he chose Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Tryin&#x27; to Get to Heaven&quot; as his favorite song. His book choice was the &quot;Collected Short Stories of Anton Chekhov.&quot;

<text>John D. Rockerduck is a cartoon character created in 1961 by The Walt Disney Company for the Duck universe. He is one of Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s main rivals in Disney comics. His name is a play on that of John D. Rockefeller, the American capitalist and philanthropist. Though a relatively obscure character in the United States, Rockerduck is an example of a character who has become notable in the foreign market, particularly in stories produced for the Italian market. He made his first animated appearance in 2019, in the second season of the &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot.

==Publication history==
Rockerduck was created by Carl Barks, who used him in one story: &quot;Boat Buster&quot;, first published in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #255 (December 1961). In that story, he was portrayed as an oil tycoon who argued with Scrooge McDuck, portrayed in that story as another oil tycoon, over which one of them made the best gasoline. To settle this, Scrooge and John agreed each one to enter a boat at an upcoming race. Scrooge was so confident of his victory he said he could win regardless of who was driving his boat. Trying to prove his point, Scrooge randomly picked somebody from the crowd watching their argument. However, he loses confidence when that somebody happened to be Donald Duck. To increase his chances of victory, Scrooge saw to it that all other boats in the race (there were a hundred boats counting Donald&#x27;s and John&#x27;s) were powered by his gasoline. Near the end, several boats (Donald&#x27;s included) crashed and a loose motor pushed a freely-floating Donald into the finish line in the first place. Scrooge claimed victory, but Rockerduck pointed out they first must find out whose gasoline was powering that motor. Despite the odds being for Scrooge, the motor happened to be the one powered by John Rockerduck&#x27;s gasoline. Rockerduck was jumping in celebration while an enraged Scrooge chased Donald.

The character has rarely appeared in American stories but appears regularly in Latin American and European stories, and especially in Italian ones. He also appeared in stories produced by the now defunct Disney Studio Program. His first appearance in an Italian story was &quot;Zio Paperone e il kiwi volante&quot; (&quot;Uncle Scrooge and the Flying Kiwi&quot;) by Giampaolo Barosso and Giorgio Bordini, first published on March 1, 1963. After this, the Disney Studio Program developed the character, and since then the Italian creators have further developed Rockerduck and explored various aspects of his relationship with Scrooge.

One distinctive character trait is a habit of eating his bowler hat whenever he is defeated by Scrooge. This has led in some stories to Rockerduck eating an entire truckload of hats, because of an especially abject defeat.

Like his rival, he is a shrewd businessman and has managed to organize a worldwide financial empire that can easily rival those of Scrooge or Flintheart Glomgold. Unlike them, he is not a tightwad but much more a liberal spender (but by no means a squanderer), as Rockerduck seems to maintain that &quot;you have to spend money to make money&quot;. This trait makes him a natural antagonist to Scrooge, who is capable of going towards absurd lengths to spare even trivial sums of money. Their rivalry is further contrasted by the fact that Rockerduck was born into luxury, rather than earning his fortune by his own hard work, which is another reason for Scrooge&#x27;s, and sometimes even Glomgold&#x27;s disrespect toward him. Rockerduck has a taste for luxury, and likes to show off his wealth. Besides his secretary, advisor, and right-hand man Jeeves, he does not seem to have any close confidants.

Like Scrooge and Flintheart, Rockerduck is extremely competitive. He is rivaling them in the wealth department and has occasionally claimed the titles of &quot;The Richest Duck in the World&quot; and &quot;The Second Richest Duck in the World&quot;. Since those titles belong to Scrooge and Flintheart respectively, it can be inferred that he owns the title of &quot;The Third Richest Duck in the World&quot;, or that Glomgold and Rockerduck are constantly competing for the second and third places. Stories that have Rockerduck or Glomgold actually measuring their fortunes against that of Scrooge invariably end with Scrooge being ahead by an entirely trivial amount. In one story, Scrooge&#x27;s and Rockerduck&#x27;s fortunes turned out to be exactly the same, but Scrooge could triumphantly point out that his Number One Dime had not been included in the count, putting him ahead by exactly one dime. For all practical purposes, the three ducks would seem to be equally rich. 

Rockerduck is an influential member of the Billionaires&#x27; Club of Duckburg, of which Scrooge and Flintheart are also members. Only five stories feature him and Flintheart both, though: &quot;Zio Paperone e il bisbilione&quot; (&quot;Uncle Scrooge and the bil-billion&quot;, 1967), written by Osvaldo Pavese and drawn by Giuseppe Perego; &quot;Whatever Happened to Scrooge McDuck?&quot; (1996), written by Lars Jensen and drawn by Maximino Tortajada Aguilar, where Rockerduck and Glomgold both make a cameo in a future vision that shows both of them having been made bankrupt by Donald&#x27;s Duck charity company; &quot;Scrooge&#x27;s Last Adventure&quot; (2003), written by Francesco Artibani and drawn by Alessandro Perina, where they team up with the Beagle Boys and Magica De Spell against Scrooge; &quot;The Three Billionaires&quot; (2005), written and drawn by Kari Korhonen; and &quot;The Great Egg Robbery&quot; (2019) written by Carol McGreal and Pat McGreal and drawn by Giorgio Cavazzano.

Another possible distinction between the characters is their country of residence and where their investments lie. In contrast to the Scottish birth of Scrooge, Rockerduck claims to be hailing from England like his father Howard, where he is sometimes depicted to be living, and shown to be the more active in Europe than in America, with some stories having Scrooge having to buy land from him or compete with him to be able to expand his businesses on the European markets. This is often ignored in other stories to be able to have the rivals meet on a daily basis as in the case of Scrooge&#x27;s other rival, Flintheart Glomgold (who in the Barks stories lives in South Africa) with John primarily managing his activities from a large business building he owns in Duckburg, and the three characters sitting at the same table in the Billionaires&#x27; Club of the city.

Rockerduck also has a passion for collecting. Besides his valuable coins and stamp collection, he is also the owner of an extensive art collection, including artifacts created from antiquity through to the 20th century. Since Scrooge also has collections of the same theme and similar value, many of their confrontations center on them trying to obtain a new addition to their collections.

Many of the stories presenting him, especially during the 1970s and the 1980s, compare and contrast his and Scrooge&#x27;s methods of organizing their business in order to gain profit. Some of those methods include researching new products for their industries, ways of refining and improving the existing ones, and the study of new producing methods. Also ways of improving their marketing techniques and public relations, in order to increase sales. Or even trying to improve the ratings of their TV stations and the sales of their newspapers, in order to have more clients paying for advertisements in them. Both he and Scrooge try to predict each other&#x27;s moves in order to act accordingly. In his efforts, Rockerduck often resorts to industrial espionage or sabotage. Although less often, Scrooge occasionally uses the same methods. Sometimes Rockerduck&#x27;s plans against Scrooge involve more severe actions like abduction, hijacking his planes, or blackmailing him. On these occasions, he usually lets his right-hand man Jeeves do the dirty work, but he also hires the Beagle Boys to do his dirty work for him from time to time.

On a more personal level, Scrooge and Rockerduck seem to bicker constantly, criticizing each other&#x27;s ways of life and personal faults. Although his confrontations with Scrooge have often found him defeated or even humiliated, he has commented on at least enjoying the challenge that Scrooge presents to him. At times the two find each other co-operating to achieve common goals. If they are worthy rivals to each other, they also seem to make effective partners—but only on a temporary basis. Some stories portray Rockerduck in a more positive light and portray him as friendly towards Scrooge&#x27;s associates like Brigitta McBridge and Donald Duck, as he has no personal grudges against them. When relaxed, he can even be a pleasant companion for them or Scrooge. In all these traits, he differs from Flintheart Glomgold.

In other stories, Donald Duck may be pitted against &quot;both&quot; Scrooge and Rockerduck during one of their temporary alliances. Such stories emphasize Scrooge&#x27;s morally ambiguous role in Italian Disney comics, where he frequently exploits Donald, or makes his life miserable in other ways. When cooperating with Rockerduck, Scrooge may be particularly insufferable, and the reader is invited to sympathize with Donald as the underdog in his conflict with the ruthless and powerful billionaires.

In the story &quot;Brother From Another Earth!&quot; (1995), written by Rudy Salvagnini and drawn by Giorgio Cavazzano, Scrooge is convinced to take a holiday on &quot;Earth-D&quot; by his counterpart &quot;Scrooge-B&quot;. In this alternate reality, a discouraged Scrooge is heavily in debt to several creditors; one being Rockerduck. The alternate Rockerduck has no visible businesses save for a greengrocery which he manages, and says that he made a mistake investing in the failing McDuck stock. When &quot;Scrooge-A&quot; works to get his counterpart&#x27;s business back on track, he retires the debt to Rockerduck, and also buys the produce store, keeping John D. Rockerduck on board as proprietor. Rockerduck admits that although odd to be part of McDuck&#x27;s recovering business empire, he also say &quot;it makes me feel almost like the free-spending tycoon I used to be!&quot;

==Character biography==
Barks never gave Rockerduck an origin. Don Rosa later provided him with one, in his series &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;. According to Don Rosa, Rockerduck has several differences from both his fictional rival and his historical namesake. Rockefeller and Scrooge were born in poverty and worked to earn their fortunes. John D. Rockerduck was born c. 1878 (this is arguably in contrast to many stories where he seem to be at least 20 years younger than Scrooge) to Howard Rockerduck, an American millionaire who had earned his fortune in the California gold rush of 1849. While John&#x27;s father was a shrewd businessman but a mild-mannered man, his mother was a rather snobbish woman who spoiled her son. Much to his father&#x27;s disappointment, John learned at an early age to look down on everyone less affluent than his family as a &quot;peasant&quot;. While his father tried to remind him that he was once poor too, John became as snobbish as his mother.

John&#x27;s first meeting with Scrooge occurred in 1885, in Butte, Montana. At the time, John was around 7 years old and Scrooge was 18 years old. Howard Rockerduck was heading to a meeting with Marcus Daly, an Irish businessman known as the &quot;Copper King&quot;, to discuss his investments in the Anaconda Copper Mining Company. Unsure of the way, Howard stopped to ask for directions. The person he asked was young Scrooge, at the time an unsuccessful copper prospector. Despite John&#x27;s protestations, Howard started having a friendly discussion with the inexperienced prospector and ended up teaching Scrooge the secrets of the job, and helping him earn ten thousand dollars. While Scrooge had to leave for Scotland to attend to family business, John again protested against his father&#x27;s relationship with the &quot;filthy peasant&quot;. Howard, to whom Scrooge resembled his younger-self, introduced his son to corporal punishment in an effort to teach him some manners. (Judging from his later behaviour, this did not work.) John Rockerduck would later inherit his father&#x27;s fortune and grow to become a rival of Scrooge.

The appearance in &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot; was the only use of the character by Don Rosa.

The story &quot;Il Matrimonio di Zio Paperone&quot; (&quot;Uncle Scrooge&#x27;s Wedding&quot;), created by , tells another tale about the origins of Rockerduck&#x27;s wealth and his rivalry with Scrooge. The story is told by Scrooge&#x27;s secretary, Ms. Quackfaster, to Scrooge&#x27;s nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Many years ago, when Rockerduck was not as rich as he is nowadays (he was a starting millionaire), he ran into Scrooge in the Millionaires Club. They started arguing and decided to settle their argument with a game of golf. If Rockerduck was to defeat Scrooge, he would win half of Scrooge&#x27;s entire fortune. It looked like Scrooge was going to win. However, a bee stung him while golfing, so he missed the last hole, leading Rockerduck to win. He then won half of Scrooge&#x27;s fortune.

Other stories have further traced the Rockerduck family history. Although some depict John as a distant cousin of Scrooge, through an unspecified genealogical connection, others have traced their rivalry to their ancestors. Arguably, the most notable among the later stories is an eight-part saga named &quot;Storia e gloria della dinastia dei paperi&quot; (&quot;History and glory of the Duck dynasty&quot;) by Guido Martina, Romano Scarpa, Giorgio Cavazzano and Giovan Battista Carpi, first published April 5-May 24, 1970. It depicts their family history, as a family feud that begun in Rome during the 1st century BC and continues to the 20th century.

In one story where Rockerduck was trying to ruin Scrooge&#x27;s deal about cleaning the statue of Cornelius Coot, Jeeves sheepishly tells him &quot;You have no conscience, sir&quot;, to which Rockerduck replies: &quot;That&#x27;s not true. I had a conscience a long time ago, but I&#x27;d rather not talk about that.&quot;

According to the story &quot;Whatever Happened to Scrooge McDuck?&quot; by Lars Jensen and Maximino Tortajada Aguilar, Rockerduck (as well as Flintheart Glomgold) was made bankrupt by Donald Duck, after the latter had inherited Scrooge&#x27;s fortune and turned it into a charity company. However, the end of the story reveals that it actually takes place in an alternate future, caused by Scrooge travelling 100 years into the past to retrieve his #1 dime.

==Roller Dollar==
Roller Dollar is Rockerduck&#x27;s super-villain alter ego. He was created for the Italian saga &quot;Ultraheroes&quot;.

==Howard Rockerduck==
Howard Rockerduck is the father of John D. Rockerduck. Howard was created by Don Rosa and used in three stories – &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck: Raider of the Copper Hill&quot; (&quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #288), &quot;Of Ducks and Dimes and Destinies&quot; (&quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #297) and &quot;La Ballata di Jhon D. Rockerduck&quot; (Topolino 3439). In &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;, Howard acts as one of Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s many early mentors – others include Sir Quackly McDuck&#x27;s ghost and a young Theodore Roosevelt.

Howard Rockerduck was born poor, but worked his way to the top and became a very wealthy man, and was helped by a &quot;lucky strike&quot; when he prospected for gold. As shown in &quot;Of Ducks…&quot;, he was in Glasgow in 1877, looking for a woman, and threw some American coins to some poor children. One of these coins was the Number One Dime. Shortly after, Rockerduck got so scared by the behaviour of a Scottish woman (actually Magica De Spell in disguise) that he went home to the USA. Magica&#x27;s interference would also indirectly result in the conception of John D. Rockerduck, as Howard gave up on Scottish girls and instead focused his attention towards England in the hopes of finding a bride, to which he would ultimately be successful.

He was next seen in Anaconda, Montana, in 1884, where he met the young Scrooge McDuck, who tried to establish himself as a prospector. Rockerduck, now a family man, saw his younger self in Scrooge, and taught him how to be a prospector. Later, he helped Scrooge make a juridical claim to the Anaconda Copper Mine, which were owned by Marcus Daly and some rich investors. Scrooge later learned that Rockerduck himself was among these investors.

==In other media==
Rockerduck, voiced by John Hodgman, made his animated debut in 2019, in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot, being a recurring antagonist in the series. Prior to his appearance, Rockerduck was described by series co-creator Francisco Angones as a robber baron and billionaire competitor of Scrooge McDuck during the 1930s. Rockerduck was introduced in season two&#x27;s ninth episode &quot;The Outlaw Scrooge McDuck!&quot;, where he is portrayed as a wealthy and corrupt businessman in the Old West while Scrooge was still a young prospector who had not yet made his fortune. Rockerduck&#x27;s M.O. at the time was buying whole towns with the promise of improving them, when in reality, he actually steals their resources and leave them behind as ghost towns. He encounters Scrooge while attempting to claim a gigantic gold nugget found in his latest acquisition, the town of Gumption, despite the fact that Scrooge and Goldie O&#x27;Gilt found it first. Scrooge and Goldie later steal the nugget back, and return it to Gumption. In season two&#x27;s one-hour finale &quot;Moonvasion!&quot;, it is revealed that Rockerduck had used experimental cryogenics to stay alive and became an agent of F.O.W.L. In season three’s eleventh episode &quot;The Forbidden Fountain of the Foreverglades!&quot; he seeks out the titular fountain to rejuvenate his youth, which he succeeds in. In the series finale&quot; The Last Adventure!&quot;, he joins F.O.W.L. in a plot to rid the world of adventuring, but is driven off by Mrs. Beakley. and his exact fate is left unknown.

While in the United States the character has long been obscure, in many countries Rockerduck is almost as well known as Scrooge himself, to the point that his name has been used as a metaphor example. In Italy, he is so familiar in popular culture that his name has been occasionally used as a metaphor for &quot;unlikable and/or dishonest wealthy person&quot;, &quot;go-getter&quot;, or &quot;rival millionaire&quot; (i.e., a millionaire who is the rival of another millionaire, in this instance, Bill Koch, rival of Raul &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; Gardini). The figure of Rockerduck was also used in a study about pathological greed, as the archrival of Scrooge, who is himself the example of said greed.

<doc id="83502" wikidata="Q58583" url="?curid=83502" title="Ernst Röhm">
<text>Ernst Julius Günther Röhm (; 28 November 1887 – 1 July 1934) was a German military officer and a leading member of the Nazi Party. A close friend and early ally of Adolf Hitler, Röhm was the co-founder and leader of the (SA), the Nazi Party&#x27;s original paramilitary wing, which played a significant role in Hitler&#x27;s rise to power. He served as chief of the SA from 1931 until his murder in 1934 during the Night of the Long Knives.

Born in Munich, Röhm joined the Imperial German Army in 1906 and fought in the First World War. He was wounded in action three times and received the Iron Cross First Class. After the war, he continued his military career as a captain in the and provided assistance to Franz Ritter von Epp&#x27;s . In 1919, Röhm joined the German Workers&#x27; Party, the precursor of the Nazi Party, and became a close associate of Adolf Hitler. Using his military connections, he helped build up several paramilitary groups in service of Hitler, one of which became the SA. In 1923, he took part in Hitler&#x27;s failed Beer Hall Putsch to seize governmental power in Munich and was given a suspended prison sentence. After a stint as a deputy, Röhm broke with Hitler in 1925 over the future direction of the Nazi Party. He resigned from all positions and emigrated to Bolivia, where he served as an advisor to the Bolivian Army.

In 1930, at Hitler&#x27;s request, Röhm returned to Germany and was officially appointed chief of staff of the SA in 1931. He reorganised the SA, which numbered over a million members, and continued its campaign of political violence against communists, rival political parties, Jews and other groups deemed hostile to the Nazi agenda. At the same time, opposition to Röhm intensified as his homosexuality gradually became public knowledge. Nevertheless, he retained the trust of Hitler for a time. After Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Röhm was named a , the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party, and appointed to the Reich cabinet as a without portfolio.

As the Nazi government began to consolidate its rule, the tension between Röhm and Hitler escalated. Throughout 1933 and 1934, Röhm&#x27;s rhetoric became increasingly radical as he called for a &quot;second revolution&quot; that would transform German society, alarming Hitler&#x27;s powerful industrial allies. He also demanded more power for the SA, which the saw as a growing threat to its position. Hitler came to see his long-time ally as a rival and liability, and made the decision to eliminate him with the assistance of SS leaders Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich. On 30 June 1934, the entire SA leadership were purged by the SS during an event known as the Night of the Long Knives. Röhm was taken to Stadelheim Prison and shot on 1 July.

== Family background ==
Ernst Röhm was born in 1887 in Munich, Bavaria, German Empire as the youngest of three children—he had an elder sister and brother—of Emilie and Julius Röhm. Ernst Röhm described his father Julius, a railway official, as strict, but once Julius realized that his son responded better without exhortation, he allowed him significant freedom to pursue his interests.

In 1906, Röhm entered the 10th Bavarian Infantry Division &quot;King Ludwig&quot; at Ingolstadt as a cadet, even though his family had no military tradition. He was commissioned as a lieutenant on 12 March 1908.

==Career==
At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, he was adjutant of the 1st Battalion, 10th Infantry Regiment König. The following month, he was seriously wounded in the face at Chanot Wood in Lorraine and carried the scars for the rest of his life. He was promoted to first lieutenant () in April 1915. During an attack on the fortification at Thiaumont, Verdun, on 23 June 1916, he sustained a serious chest wound and spent the remainder of the war in France and Romania as a staff officer. He was awarded the Iron Cross First Class before being wounded at Verdun, and was promoted to captain () in April 1917. Among his comrades, Röhm was considered a &quot;fanatical, simple-minded swashbuckler&quot; who frequently displayed contempt for danger. In his memoirs, Röhm reported that during the autumn of 1918, he contracted the deadly Spanish influenza and was not expected to live, but recovered after a lengthy convalescence.

Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the war, Röhm continued his military career as a captain in the . He was one of the senior members in Franz Ritter von Epp&#x27;s (&quot;Bavarian Free Corps for Border Patrol East&quot;), formed in Ohrdruf in April 1919, which finally overturned the Munich Soviet Republic by force of arms on 3 May 1919. In 1919 he joined the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP), which the following year became the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP). His membership number was 623. Not long afterward he met Adolf Hitler, and they became political allies and close friends. Throughout the early 1920s, Röhm remained an important intermediary between Germany&#x27;s right-wing paramilitary organizations and the . Additionally, it was Röhm who persuaded his former army commander, Franz Ritter von Epp, to join the Nazis, an important development, since Epp helped raise the sixty-thousand marks needed to purchase the Nazi periodical, the &quot;&quot;. In early 1923, he took part in the establishment of a federation of paramilitary organizations that was titled &quot;Arbeitsgemeinschaft&quot; and aimed at strengthening the army and combating Marxist influences.

During early September 1923, when the Nazi Party held its &quot;German Day&quot; celebration at Nuremberg, it was Röhm who helped bring together some 100,000 participants drawn from right-wing militant groups, veterans&#x27; associations, and other paramilitary formations—which included the , , the SA, and the —all of them subordinate to Hitler as &quot;political leader&quot; of the collective alliance. Röhm resigned or retired from the on 26 September 1923.

In November 1923, Röhm led the militia at the time of the Munich Beer Hall Putsch. He rented the cavernous main hall of the Löwenbräukeller, supposedly for a reunion and festive comradeship. Meanwhile, Hitler and his entourage were at the Bürgerbräukeller. Röhm planned to start the revolution and use the units at his disposal to obtain weapons from secret caches with which to occupy crucial points in the centre of the city. When the call came, he announced to those assembled in the Löwenbräukeller that the Kahr government had been deposed and Hitler had declared a &quot;national revolution&quot; which elicited wild cheering. Röhm then led his force of nearly 2,000 men to the War Ministry, which they occupied for sixteen hours. Once in control of the headquarters, Röhm awaited news, barricaded inside. The subsequent march into the city center led by Hitler, Hermann Göring, and General Erich Ludendorff with banners flying high, was ostensibly undertaken to &quot;free&quot; Röhm and his forces.

While crowds cheered, egged on by Gregor Strasser shouting , Hitler&#x27;s armed assembly, wearing red swastika armbands, encountered Bavarian State Policemen, who were prepared to counter the Putsch. Around the time the marchers reached the &quot;Feldherrnhalle&quot; near the city center, shots were fired, scattering the participants. By the end of the gunfire, fourteen Nazis and four policemen had been killed; the putsch had failed and the Nazis&#x27; first bid for power had lasted less than twenty-four hours.

In February 1924, following the failed putsch, Röhm, Hitler, Ludendorff, Lieutenant Colonel Hermann Kriebel and six others were tried for high treason. Röhm was found guilty and sentenced to fifteen months in prison, but the sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation. Hitler was found guilty and sentenced to five years&#x27; imprisonment, but served only nine months at Landsberg Prison (under permissively lenient conditions).

In April 1924, Röhm became a &quot;Reichstag&quot; deputy for the &quot;völkisch&quot; (racial-national) National Socialist Freedom Party. He made only one speech, urging the release of Kriebel. In the December 1924 election the seats won by his party were much reduced, and his name was too far down the list to return him to the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. While Hitler was in prison, Röhm helped to create the &quot;Frontbann&quot; as a legal alternative to the then-outlawed &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA). Hitler did not fully support Röhm&#x27;s ambitious plans for this organization, which proved problematic. Hitler was distrustful of these paramilitary organizations because competing groups like the &quot;Bund Wiking&quot;, the &quot;Bund Bayern und Reich&quot;, and the &quot;Blücherbund&quot; were all vying for membership and he realized from the failed putsch that these groups could not be legitimated so long as the police and &quot;Reichswehr&quot; stayed loyal to the government.

When in April 1925 Hitler and Ludendorff disapproved of the proposals under which Röhm was prepared to integrate the 30,000-strong &quot;Frontbann&quot; into the SA, Röhm resigned from all political groups and military brigades on 1 May 1925. He felt great contempt for the &quot;legalistic&quot; path the party leaders wanted to follow and sought seclusion from public life.

=== Bolivia ===
In 1928, Röhm was recruited by Wilhelm Kaiser, nominally the Bolivian military attaché in the Netherlands, to serve as an advisor to the Bolivian Army. The Bolivians were looking for a capable German officer with war experience who, as a military instructor, would play a leading role in the reorganization of the Bolivian army. In addition to army reform, ongoing tensions between Bolivia and Paraguay, which later erupted in the Chaco War, were probably also a reason why the Bolivian government was interested in recruiting German experts. 

Röhm signed a contract with a term of service from January 1, 1929 to December 31, 1930, and the German-born Bolivian Chief of General Staff Hans Kundt assured Röhm the rank of lieutenant colonel and a monthly salary of 1,000 Bolivianos, which would give him a high standard of living given the low cost of living in Bolivia.

Röhm arrived in La Paz in January 1929 and began work as a professor at the Bolivian military college so that he could first &quot;learn Spanish.&quot; From June to September 1929, Röhm served as a troop inspector, then until August 1930 he was chief of staff of the division command of the Bolivian Army headquartered in Oruro. While some historians claim Röhm played a prominent role in Bolivia in this period, more recent research suggests his role during this period of Bolivian history was relatively minor.

In the autumn of 1930, Röhm received a telephone call from Hitler requesting his return to Germany.

==&quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; leader==
In September 1930, as a consequence of the Stennes Revolt in Berlin, Hitler assumed supreme command of the SA as its new &quot;Oberster SA-Führer&quot;. He sent a personal request to Röhm, asking him to return to serve as the SA&#x27;s Chief of Staff. Röhm accepted this offer and began his new assignment on 5 January 1931. He brought radical new ideas to the SA and appointed several close friends to its senior leadership. Previously, the SA formations were subordinate to the Nazi Party leadership of each &quot;Gau&quot;. Röhm established new &quot;Gruppe&quot;, which had no regional Nazi Party oversight. Each &quot;Gruppe&quot; extended over several regions and was commanded by an SA-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; who answered only to Röhm or Hitler.

The SA by this time numbered over a million members. Their initial assignment of protecting Nazi leaders at rallies and assemblies was taken over by the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) in relation to the top leaders. The SA did continue its street battles against the communists, forces of rival political parties and violent actions against Jews and others deemed hostile to the Nazi agenda.

Under Röhm, the SA often took the side of workers in strikes and other labor disputes, attacking strikebreakers and supporting picket lines. SA intimidation contributed to the rise of the Nazis and the violent suppression of rival parties during electoral campaigns, but its reputation for street violence and heavy drinking was a hindrance, as was the rumored homosexuality of Röhm and other SA leaders such as his deputy Edmund Heines. In June 1931, the &quot;Münchener Post&quot;, a Social Democratic newspaper, began attacking Röhm and the SA regarding homosexuality in its ranks and then in March 1932, the paper obtained and published some private letters of his in which Röhm described himself as &quot;same-sex oriented&quot; (). These letters had been confiscated by the Berlin police back in 1931 and subsequently passed along to the journalist Helmuth Klotz.

Hitler was aware of Röhm&#x27;s homosexuality. Their friendship shows in that Röhm remained one of the few intimates allowed to use the familiar German &quot;du&quot; (the German familiar form of &quot;you&quot;) when conversing with Hitler. Röhm was the only Nazi leader who dared to address Hitler by his first name &quot;Adolf&quot; or his nickname &quot;Adi&quot; rather than &quot;&quot;. Their close association led to rumors that Hitler himself was homosexual. Unlike many in the Nazi hierarchy, Röhm never fell victim to Hitler&#x27;s &quot;arresting personality&quot; nor did he come fully under his spell, which made him unique.

As Hitler rose to national power with his appointment as chancellor in January 1933, SA members were appointed auxiliary police and ordered by Göring to sweep aside &quot;all enemies of the state&quot;.

===Second revolution===
Röhm and the SA regarded themselves as the vanguard of the &quot;National Socialist revolution&quot;. After Hitler&#x27;s national takeover they expected radical changes in Germany, including power and rewards for themselves, unaware that, as Chancellor, Hitler no longer needed their street-fighting capabilities.

Nevertheless, Hitler did name Röhm to numerous important Party and State positions. On 2 June 1933, Hitler named him a &quot;Reichsleiter&quot;, the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party. He was made a member of the Prussian State Council on 14 September and a member of the Academy for German Law on 3 October, advancing to its Leadership Council (&quot;Führerrat&quot;) in November. On 12 November, Röhm was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. Finally, on 2 December 1933, he was named to the Reich cabinet as a &quot;Reichsminister&quot; without portfolio by a provision in the Law to Secure the Unity of Party and State aimed at interlocking the leadership of the Party and the government. At the same time, he also was made a member of the Reich Defense Council.

Along with other members of the more radical faction within the Nazi Party, Röhm advocated a &quot;second revolution&quot; that was overtly anti-capitalist in its general disposition. These radicals rejected capitalism and they intended to take steps to curb monopolies and promoted the nationalization of land and industry. Such plans were threatening to the business community in general, and to Hitler&#x27;s corporate financial backers in particular—including many German industrial leaders he would rely upon for arms production. In order to keep from alienating them, Hitler swiftly reassured his powerful industrial allies that there would be no such revolution as espoused by these Party radicals.
Many SA &quot;storm troopers&quot; had working-class origins and longed for a radical transformation of German society. They were disappointed by the new regime&#x27;s lack of socialistic direction and its failure to provide the lavish patronage they had expected. Furthermore, Röhm and his SA colleagues thought of their force as the core of the future German Army, and saw themselves as replacing the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; and its established professional officer corps. By then, the SA had swollen to over three million men, dwarfing the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, which was limited to 100,000 men by the Treaty of Versailles. Although Röhm had been a member of the officer corps, he viewed them as &quot;old fogies&quot; who lacked &quot;revolutionary spirit&quot;. He believed that the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; should be merged into the SA to form a true &quot;people&#x27;s army&quot; under his command, a pronouncement that caused significant consternation within the army&#x27;s hierarchy and convinced them that the SA was a serious threat. At a February 1934 cabinet meeting, Röhm then demanded that the merger be made, under his leadership as Minister of Defence.

This horrified the army, with its traditions going back to Frederick the Great. The army officer corps viewed the SA as an &quot;undisciplined mob&quot; of &quot;brawling&quot; street thugs, and was also concerned by the pervasiveness of &quot;corrupt morals&quot; within the ranks of the SA. Reports of a huge cache of weapons in the hands of SA members caused additional concern to the army leadership. Unsurprisingly, the officer corps opposed Röhm&#x27;s proposal. They insisted that discipline and honor would vanish if the SA gained control, but Röhm and the SA would settle for nothing less. In addition the army leadership was eager to co-operate with Hitler given his plan of re-armament and expansion of the established professional military forces.

In February 1934, Hitler told British diplomat Anthony Eden of his plan to reduce the SA by two-thirds. That same month, Hitler announced that the SA would be left with only a few minor military functions. Röhm responded with complaints, and began expanding the armed elements of the SA. Speculation that the SA was planning a coup against Hitler became widespread in Berlin. In March, Röhm offered a compromise in which &quot;only&quot; a few thousand SA leaders would be taken into the army, but the army promptly rejected that idea.

On 11 April 1934, Hitler met with German military leaders on the ship &quot;Deutschland&quot;. By that time, he knew President Paul von Hindenburg would likely die before the end of the year. Hitler informed the army hierarchy of Hindenburg&#x27;s declining health and proposed that the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; support him as Hindenburg&#x27;s successor. In exchange, he offered to reduce the SA, suppress Röhm&#x27;s ambitions, and guarantee the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; would be Germany&#x27;s only military force. According to war correspondent William L. Shirer, Hitler also promised to expand the army and navy.

Although determined to curb the power of the SA, Hitler put off doing away with his long-time ally. A political struggle within the party grew, with those closest to Hitler, including Prussian premier Hermann Göring, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, and &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler, positioning themselves against Röhm. To isolate Röhm, on 20 April 1934, Göring transferred control of the Prussian political police (Gestapo) to Himmler, who he believed could be counted on to move against Röhm.

Both the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; and the conservative business community continued to complain to Hindenburg about the SA. In early June, defence minister Werner von Blomberg issued an ultimatum to Hitler from Hindenburg: unless Hitler took immediate steps to end the growing tension in Germany, Hindenburg would declare martial law and turn over control of the country to the army. The threat of a declaration of martial law from Hindenburg, the only person in Germany with the authority to potentially depose the Nazi regime, put Hitler under pressure to act. Hitler decided the time had come both to destroy Röhm and to settle scores with old enemies. Both Himmler and Göring welcomed Hitler&#x27;s decision, since both had much to gain by Röhm&#x27;s downfall—the independence of the SS for Himmler, and the removal of a rival for Göring.

==Personal life and death==
Röhm was known to be homosexual, which Hitler tolerated. Röhm was also known for being a good organizer, a strong leader and having a brutal, unscrupulous manner; all of which served Hitler well politically, before the Nazis obtained national power in 1933.

In June 1934, in preparation for the purge known as the Night of the Long Knives, both Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the SS Security Service, assembled a dossier of fabricated evidence to suggest that Röhm had been paid (equivalent to € million ) by the government of France to overthrow Hitler. Leading officers in the SS were shown falsified evidence on 24 June that Röhm planned to use the SA to launch a plot against the government (&quot;Röhm-Putsch&quot;). At Hitler&#x27;s direction, Göring, Himmler, Heydrich, and Victor Lutze drew up lists of people in and outside the SA to be killed. One of the men Göring recruited to assist him was Willi Lehmann, a Gestapo official and NKVD spy. On 25 June, General Werner von Fritsch placed the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; on the highest level of alert. On 27 June, Hitler moved to secure the army&#x27;s cooperation. Blomberg and General Walter von Reichenau, the army&#x27;s liaison to the party, gave it to him by expelling Röhm from the German Officers&#x27; League. On 28 June, Hitler went to Essen to attend Josef Terboven&#x27;s wedding celebration and reception; from there he called Röhm&#x27;s adjutant at Bad Wiessee and ordered SA leaders to meet with him on 30 June at 11:00 a.m. On 29 June, a signed article in &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; by Blomberg appeared in which Blomberg stated with great fervour that the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; stood behind Hitler.

On 30 June 1934, Hitler and a large group of SS and regular police flew to Munich and arrived between 06:00 and 07:00 at Hanselbauer Hotel in Bad Wiessee, where Röhm and his followers were staying. With Hitler&#x27;s early arrival, the SA leadership, still in bed, were taken by surprise. SS men stormed the hotel and Hitler personally placed Röhm and other high-ranking SA leaders under arrest. According to Erich Kempka, Hitler turned Röhm over to &quot;two detectives holding pistols with the safety catch off&quot;. The SS found Breslau SA leader Edmund Heines in bed with an unidentified eighteen-year-old male SA senior troop leader. Goebbels emphasised this aspect in subsequent Nazi propaganda, justifying the purge as a crackdown on moral turpitude. Kempka said in a 1946 interview that Hitler ordered both Heines and his partner taken outside of the hotel and shot. Meanwhile, the SS arrested the other SA leaders as they left their train for the planned meeting with Röhm and Hitler.

Although Hitler presented no evidence of a plot by Röhm to overthrow the regime, he nevertheless denounced the leadership of the SA. Arriving back at party headquarters in Munich, Hitler addressed the assembled crowd. Consumed with rage, Hitler denounced &quot;the worst treachery in world history&quot;. Hitler told the crowd that &quot;undisciplined and disobedient characters and asocial or diseased elements&quot; would be annihilated. The crowd, which included party members and many SA members fortunate enough to escape arrest, shouted its approval.

Joseph Goebbels, who had been with Hitler at Bad Wiessee, set the final phase of the plan in motion. Upon returning to Berlin, Goebbels telephoned Göring at 10:00 with the codeword (&quot;hummingbird&quot;) to let loose the execution squads on the rest of their unsuspecting victims. &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; commander Sepp Dietrich received orders from Hitler to form an &quot;execution squad&quot; and go to Stadelheim Prison in Munich where Röhm and other SA leaders were being held under arrest. There in the prison courtyard, the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; firing squad shot five SA generals and an SA colonel. Several of those not immediately executed were taken back to the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; barracks at Lichterfelde, given one-minute &quot;trials&quot;, and shot by a firing squad. Röhm himself, however, was kept prisoner.

Hitler was hesitant in authorising Röhm&#x27;s execution, perhaps because of loyalty or embarrassment about the execution of an important lieutenant; he eventually did so, and agreed that Röhm should have the option of suicide. On 1 July 1934, SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Theodor Eicke (later commandant of the Dachau concentration camp) and SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Michael Lippert visited Röhm. Once inside Röhm&#x27;s cell, they handed him a Browning pistol loaded with a single cartridge and told him he had ten minutes to kill himself or they would do it for him. Röhm demurred, telling them, &quot;If I am to be killed, let Adolf do it himself.&quot; Having heard nothing in the allotted time, Eicke and Lippert returned to Röhm&#x27;s cell at 14:50 to find him standing, with his bare chest puffed out in a gesture of defiance. Eicke and Lippert then shot and killed Röhm. SA-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Viktor Lutze, who had been spying on Röhm, was named as the new &quot;Stabschef&quot; (SA).

==Reactions to the purge==
While some Germans were shocked by the killings of 30 June to 2 July 1934, many others saw Hitler as the one who restored &quot;order&quot; to the country. Goebbels&#x27;s propaganda highlighted the &quot;Röhm-Putsch&quot; in the days that followed. The homosexuality of Röhm and other SA leaders was made public to add &quot;shock value&quot;, even though it had been known to Hitler and other Nazi leaders for years.

On 3 July 1934 the purge of the SA was legalised with a one-paragraph decree: the &quot;Law Regarding Measures of State Self-Defence&quot;, a step that historian Robin Cross contended in 2009 was done by Hitler to cover his own tracks. The Law declared, &quot;The measures taken on 30 June, 1 and 2 July to suppress treasonous assaults are legal as acts of self-defence by the State.&quot; At the time no public reference was made to the alleged SA rebellion, but only generalised references to misconduct, perversion and some sort of plot.

In a nationally broadcast speech to the Reichstag on 13 July, Hitler justified the purge as a defence against treason. Before the events of the Night of the Long Knives concluded, not only was Röhm dead, but more than 200 additional people had been killed, including Nazi official Gregor Strasser, former chancellor General Kurt von Schleicher, and Franz von Papen&#x27;s secretary, Edgar Jung. Most of those murdered had little to no affiliation with Röhm but were killed for political reasons.

In an attempt to erase Röhm from German history, almost all known copies of the 1933 propaganda film &quot;The Victory of Faith&quot; (&quot;Der Sieg des Glaubens&quot;)—in which Röhm appeared—were destroyed in 1934, probably on Hitler&#x27;s order; however, at least one copy has survived destruction. A new film called &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; (&quot;Triumph des Willens&quot;) was shot in its place in 1935, with Victor Lutze replacing Röhm and the SA playing a much lesser role.

<text>The Château de Saumur, originally built as a castle and later developed as a &quot;château&quot;, is located in the French town of Saumur, in the Maine-et-Loire &quot;département&quot;. It was originally constructed in the 10th century by Theobald I, Count of Blois, as a fortified stronghold against Norman attacks. It overlooks the confluence of the rivers Loire and Thouet. In 1026 it came into the hands of Fulk Nerra, count of Anjou, who bequeathed it to his Plantagenet heirs. Following its destruction in 1067, the castle was rebuilt by Henry II of England in the later 12th century.

==History==

In 1203, Philip II of France made Saumur part of his royal domain, and seized the castle. He buttressed the castle for further security. The castle became an official royal residence shortly thereafter, and Louis IX, the resident in 1227, built upon the fortress. In the 1360s, Louis I of Anjou would later replace the round towers of the castle with octangonal towers, which still exist in the château&#x27;s current form.

The page for September in the Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry depicts the Château as it looked in 1410. It states that René of Anjou lived there until his death in 1480. The castle changed hands several times until 1589 when the Protestant King Henry IV (of France and Navarre) gave the castle to Duplessis-Mornay.

In 1621 the castle was converted into an army barracks. Nearly two centuries later it was converted into a state prison under Napoleon Bonaparte.

In the first part of the 20th century, the city of Saumur acquired the castle and began a restoration program to house the museum of the decorative arts. In line with the Saumur area&#x27;s equestrian tradition and its famous &quot;Cadre Noir&quot;, the castle also serves as a Museum of the Horse. The castle has a dungeon and watchtower, and houses the &quot;Musée de la Figurine-Jouet&quot;, a collection of very old toys and figurines of soldiers, kings of France, and clowns.

The Château de Saumur has been listed as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture since 1862.

In 1906, the town purchased the castle from the state government, and turned it into a museum. The castle suffered damages during WWII shelling, and was restored by 1997.

On 22 April 2001, part of the northern rampart collapsed and damaged the area below. The basement below the castle was stabilized during rebuilding, and the rampart&#x27;s reconstruction was completed in 2007.

<text>Orphans of the Sky is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein (1907–1988), consisting of two parts: &quot;Universe&quot; (&quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, May 1941) and its sequel, &quot;Common Sense&quot; (&quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, October 1941). The two novellas were first published together in book form in 1963. &quot;Universe&quot; was also published separately in 1951 as a 10¢ Dell paperback. The work presents one of the earliest fictional depictions of a generation ship.

==Plot summary==
The gigantic, cylindrical generation ship &quot;Vanguard&quot;, originally destined for &quot;Far Centaurus&quot;, has been cruising without guidance through interstellar space ever since a mutiny long ago killed most of the officers. Over time, the descendants of the surviving loyal crew have lapsed into a pre-technological culture that is marked by superstition, and have forgotten the purpose and nature of their ship. Since they come to believe the &quot;Ship&quot; is the entire universe, &quot;To move the ship&quot; is considered an oxymoron, and references to the Ship&#x27;s &quot;voyage&quot; are interpreted as religious metaphor. They are ruled by an oligarchy of &quot;officers&quot; and &quot;scientists.&quot; Most crew members are simple illiterate farmers who seldom if ever venture to the &quot;upper decks,&quot; where the &quot;muties&quot; (&quot;mutants&quot; or &quot;mutineers&quot;) dwell. Among the crew, all identifiable mutants are killed at birth.
The story centers on a young man of insatiable curiosity, Hugh Hoyland, who is selected as an apprentice by a scientist. The scientists ritualistically perform the tasks required to maintain the Ship, such as putting trash into its energy converter to generate power, and remain ignorant of their true functions.

On a hunt for muties, Hugh is captured by them. He barely avoids getting eaten by the microcephalic dwarf Bobo and instead becomes the slave of Joe-Jim Gregory, the two-headed leader of a powerful mutie gang. Joe and Jim have separate identities, but both are highly intelligent and have come to a crude understanding of the Ship&#x27;s true nature.

Having become convinced of the Ship&#x27;s true purpose, Hugh persuades Joe-Jim to complete the mission of colonization since he notices that there is a nearby star that Joe-Jim has observed growing larger over the years. Intent on the mission, he returns to the lower levels of the Ship to convince others to help him, but is arrested by his former boss, Bill Ertz, and sentenced to death. He is viewed as either insane or a previously unrecognized mutant; he was a borderline case at birth, with a head viewed as too large.

Hugh persuades an old friend, Alan Mahoney, to enlist Joe-Jim&#x27;s gang in rescuing him. He shows the captured Bill and Alan the long-abandoned command center and a view of the stars. Convinced, Bill then enlists the captain&#x27;s aide, Phineas Narby, to Hugh&#x27;s crusade.

Inspired by one of Joe-Jim&#x27;s favorite books, &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, they manufacture swords superior to the daggers that everyone else has. They overthrow the captain, install Narby in his place, and embark on a campaign to bring the entire Ship under their control.

However, Narby never believed Hugh and played along only to gain power. Once in control, he sets out to eliminate the muties. Joe is killed in the fighting, but Jim sacrifices himself to hold off their pursuers long enough for Hugh, Bill, Alan, and their wives to get to a highly automated lifeboat. Hugh manages to land on the habitable moon of a gas giant. The colonists disembark and uneasily explore their alien surroundings.

==Reception==
Avram Davidson described &quot;Orphans of the Sky&quot; as &quot;a modern classic&quot; and praised &quot;the magnitude and magnificence of &quot;Orphans&quot;″ concepts&quot; but expressed disappointment in &quot;the limitations of its conclusion.&quot; Damon Knight said, &quot;Nobody has ever improved on &quot;Universe&quot;, although a good many reckless people have tried, because Heinlein said it all.&quot; Algis Budrys said, &quot;Many hands have worked at improving Heinlein&#x27;s impeccable statement of this theme&quot;, with none succeeding until James White&#x27;s &quot;The Watch Below&quot;.

==Links to other Heinlein stories==

A paragraph at the start of the novel shows an excerpt from &quot;The Romance of Modern Astrography,&quot; explaining that the ship was part of the &quot;Proxima Centauri Expedition, sponsored by the Jordan Foundation in 2119&quot; (A timeline produced by Heinlein to link different stories in his &quot;Future History&quot; places the launch of the &quot;Vanguard&quot; in the early 22nd century.) A discovered ship&#x27;s log begins in June 2172, a few days before the mutiny breaks out.

In Heinlein&#x27;s later novel &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, the &quot;Vanguard&quot; is briefly mentioned as the sister ship of &quot;New Frontiers&quot;, which was commandeered by the Howard Families in the novel &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot;. It is revealed that the vessel had been bound for Proxima Centauri but never landed colonists there. The &quot;Vanguard&quot; has been discovered, with its crew long dead because of an unexplained failure in its mechanisms, and its records destroyed or illegible. Its path is traced back, and the descendants of Hugh&#x27;s people are found, flourishing as highly intelligent savages on a planet which scientists dub &quot;Pitcairn Island&quot;. Another reference to Heinlein&#x27;s Future History is a passage describing Joe-Jim&#x27;s enthusiasm for the works of &quot;Rhysling, the blind singer of the spaceways,&quot; a poet and the central character of the Heinlein story &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot;.

==Radio adaptation==

&quot;Universe&quot; was also performed as a radio play on the NBC Radio Network programs &quot;Dimension X&quot; (on November 26, 1951) and &quot;X Minus One&quot; (on May 15, 1955). Those versions have several drastic changes to the story, especially in their conclusions in which Hugh is killed, showing the crew of the &quot;Vanguard&quot; the true nature of the Ship.

==Scientific details==
Two-headed humans exist, one variation of conjoined twins.

The physics of the Ship&#x27;s artificial gravity is also correct: It spins to simulate gravity, which is absent at the centre. The ship&#x27;s &quot;Converter&quot; reflects an early 1940s viewpoint of atomic power, with atoms of any element &quot;ripped apart&quot; in an unspecified manner.

The notion of a giant planet with a habitable moon went against theories of planetary formation as they stood before the discovery of &quot;hot Jupiter&quot; planets. It was thought that planets large enough to have an Earth-sized moon would form only above the &quot;snowline,&quot; too far from the star for life. It is now believed that such worlds can migrate inwards, and habitable moons seem possible. The existence of exomoons has not been confirmed, but there are candidates.
