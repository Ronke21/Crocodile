<text>LZ77 and LZ78 are the two lossless data compression algorithms published in papers by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv in 1977 and 1978.
They are also known as Lempel-Ziv 1 (LZ1) and Lempel-Ziv 2 (LZ2) respectively. These two algorithms form the basis for many variations including LZW, LZSS, LZMA and others. Besides their academic influence, these algorithms formed the basis of several ubiquitous compression schemes, including GIF and the DEFLATE algorithm used in PNG and ZIP.

They are both theoretically dictionary coders. LZ77 maintains a sliding window during compression. This was later shown to be equivalent to the &quot;explicit dictionary&quot; constructed by LZ78—however, they are only equivalent when the entire data is intended to be decompressed.

Since LZ77 encodes and decodes from a sliding window over previously seen characters, decompression must always start at the beginning of the input. Conceptually, LZ78 decompression could allow random access to the input if the entire dictionary were known in advance. However, in practice the dictionary is created during encoding and decoding by creating a new phrase whenever a token is output.

The algorithms were named an IEEE Milestone in 2004. In 2021 Jacob Ziv was awarded the IEEE Medal of Honor for his involvement in their development.

==Theoretical efficiency==
In the second of the two papers that introduced these algorithms they are analyzed as encoders defined by finite-state machines. A measure analogous to information entropy is developed for individual sequences (as opposed to probabilistic ensembles). This measure gives a bound on the data compression ratio that can be achieved. It is then shown that there exists finite lossless encoders for every sequence that achieve this bound as the length of the sequence grows to infinity. In this sense an algorithm based on this scheme produces asymptotically optimal encodings. This result can be proven more directly, as for example in notes by Peter Shor.

Formally, (Theorem 13.5.2 ).

Similar theorems apply to other versions of LZ algorithm.

==LZ77==
LZ77 algorithms achieve compression by replacing repeated occurrences of data with references to a single copy of that data existing earlier in the uncompressed data stream. A match is encoded by a pair of numbers called a &quot;length-distance pair&quot;, which is equivalent to the statement &quot;each of the next &quot;length&quot; characters is equal to the characters exactly &quot;distance&quot; characters behind it in the uncompressed stream&quot;. (The &quot;distance&quot; is sometimes called the &quot;offset&quot; instead.)

To spot matches, the encoder must keep track of some amount of the most recent data, such as the last 2 KB, 4 KB, or 32 KB. The structure in which this data is held is called a &quot;sliding window&quot;, which is why LZ77 is sometimes called &quot;sliding-window compression&quot;. The encoder needs to keep this data to look for matches, and the decoder needs to keep this data to interpret the matches the encoder refers to. The larger the sliding window is, the longer back the encoder may search for creating references.

It is not only acceptable but frequently useful to allow length-distance pairs to specify a length that actually exceeds the distance. As a copy command, this is puzzling: &quot;Go back &quot;four&quot; characters and copy &quot;ten&quot; characters from that position into the current position&quot;. How can ten characters be copied over when only four of them are actually in the buffer? Tackling one byte at a time, there is no problem serving this request, because as a byte is copied over, it may be fed again as input to the copy command. When the copy-from position makes it to the initial destination position, it is consequently fed data that was pasted from the &quot;beginning&quot; of the copy-from position. The operation is thus equivalent to the statement &quot;copy the data you were given and repetitively paste it until it fits&quot;. As this type of pair repeats a single copy of data multiple times, it can be used to incorporate a flexible and easy form of run-length encoding.

Another way to see things is as follows: While encoding, for the search pointer to continue finding matched pairs past the end of the search window, all characters from the first match at offset &quot;D&quot; and forward to the end of the search window must have matched input, and these are the (previously seen) characters that compose a single run unit of length &quot;L&quot;R, which must equal &quot;D&quot;. Then as the search pointer proceeds past the search window and forward, as far as the run pattern repeats in the input, the search and input pointers will be in sync and match characters until the run pattern is interrupted. Then &quot;L&quot; characters have been matched in total, &quot;L&quot; &gt; &quot;D&quot;, and the code is [&quot;D&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;c&quot;].

Upon decoding [&quot;D&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;c&quot;], again, &quot;D&quot; = &quot;L&quot;R. When the first &quot;L&quot;R characters are read to the output, this corresponds to a single run unit appended to the output buffer. At this point, the read pointer could be thought of as only needing to return int(&quot;L&quot;/&quot;L&quot;R) + (1 if &quot;L&quot; mod &quot;L&quot;R ≠ 0) times to the start of that single buffered run unit, read &quot;L&quot;R characters (or maybe fewer on the last return), and repeat until a total of &quot;L&quot; characters are read. But mirroring the encoding process, since the pattern is repetitive, the read pointer need only trail in sync with the write pointer by a fixed distance equal to the run length &quot;L&quot;R until &quot;L&quot; characters have been copied to output in total.

Considering the above, especially if the compression of data runs is expected to predominate, the window search should begin at the end of the window and proceed backwards, since run patterns, if they exist, will be found first and allow the search to terminate, absolutely if the current maximal matching sequence length is met, or judiciously, if a sufficient length is met, and finally for the simple possibility that the data is more recent and may correlate better with the next input.

===Pseudocode===
The following pseudocode is a reproduction of the LZ77 compression algorithm sliding window.

 while input is not empty do
 match := longest repeated occurrence of input that begins in window
 if match exists then
 d := distance to start of match
 l := length of match
 c := char following match in input
 else
 d := 0
 l := 0
 c := first char of input
 end if
 output (d, l, c)
 discard &quot;l&quot; + 1 chars from front of window
 s := pop &quot;l&quot; + 1 chars from front of input
 append s to back of window
 repeat

===Implementations===
Even though all LZ77 algorithms work by definition on the same basic principle, they can vary widely in how they encode their compressed data to vary the numerical ranges of a length–distance pair, alter the number of bits consumed for a length–distance pair, and distinguish their length–distance pairs from &quot;literals&quot; (raw data encoded as itself, rather than as part of a length–distance pair). A few examples:
* The algorithm illustrated in Lempel and Ziv&#x27;s original 1977 article outputs all its data three values at a time: the length and distance of the longest match found in the buffer, and the literal that followed that match. If two successive characters in the input stream could be encoded only as literals, the length of the length–distance pair would be 0.
* LZSS improves on LZ77 by using a 1-bit flag to indicate whether the next chunk of data is a literal or a length–distance pair, and using literals if a length–distance pair would be longer.
* In the PalmDoc format, a length–distance pair is always encoded by a two-byte sequence. Of the 16 bits that make up these two bytes, 11 bits go to encoding the distance, 3 go to encoding the length, and the remaining two are used to make sure the decoder can identify the first byte as the beginning of such a two-byte sequence.
* In the implementation used for many games by Electronic Arts, the size in bytes of a length–distance pair can be specified inside the first byte of the length–distance pair itself; depending on whether the first byte begins with a 0, 10, 110, or 111 (when read in big-endian bit orientation), the length of the entire length–distance pair can be 1 to 4 bytes.
* , the most popular LZ77-based compression method is DEFLATE; it combines LZSS with Huffman coding. Literals, lengths, and a symbol to indicate the end of the current block of data are all placed together into one alphabet. Distances can be safely placed into a separate alphabet; because a distance only occurs just after a length, it cannot be mistaken for another kind of symbol or vice versa.

==LZ78==
The LZ78 algorithms compress sequential data by building a dictionary of token sequences from the input, and then replacing the second and subsequent occurrence of the sequence in the data stream with a reference to the dictionary entry. The observation is that the number of repeated sequences is a good measure of the non random nature of a sequence. The algorithms represent the dictionary as an n-ary tree where n is the number of tokens used to form token sequences. Each dictionary entry is of the form , where index is the index to a dictionary entry representing a previously seen sequence, and token is the next token from the input that makes this entry unique in the dictionary. Note how the algorithm is greedy, and so nothing is added to the table until a unique making token is found. The algorithm is to initialize last matching index = 0 and next available index = 1 and then, for each token of the input stream, the dictionary searched for a match: . If a match is found, then last matching index is set to the index of the matching entry, nothing is output, and last matching index is left representing the input so far. Input is processed until a match is &quot;not&quot; found. Then a new dictionary entry is created, , and the algorithm outputs last matching index, followed by token, then resets last matching index = 0 and increments next available index. As an example consider the sequence of tokens which would assemble the dictionary;

and the output sequence of the compressed data would be . Note that the last A is not represented yet as the algorithm cannot know what comes next. In practice an EOF marker is added to the input – for example. Note also that in this case the output is longer than the original input but compression ratio improves considerably as the dictionary grows, and in binary the indexes need not be represented by any more than the minimum number of bits.

Decompression consists of rebuilding the dictionary from the compressed sequence. From the sequence the first entry is always the terminator , and the first from the sequence would be . The is added to the output. The second pair from the input is and results in entry number 2 in the dictionary, . The token &quot;B&quot; is output, preceded by the sequence represented by dictionary entry 1. Entry 1 is an &#x27;A&#x27; (followed by &quot;entry 0&quot; – nothing) so is added to the output. Next is added to the dictionary as the next entry, , and B (preceded by nothing) is added to the output. Finally a dictionary entry for is created and is output resulting in or removing the spaces and EOF marker.

==LZW==
LZW is an LZ78-based algorithm that uses a dictionary pre-initialized with all possible characters (symbols) or emulation of a pre-initialized dictionary. The main improvement of LZW is that when a match is not found, the current input stream character is assumed to be the first character of an existing string in the dictionary (since the dictionary is initialized with all possible characters), so only the &quot;last matching index&quot; is output (which may be the pre-initialized dictionary index corresponding to the previous (or the initial) input character). Refer to the LZW article for implementation details.

BTLZ is an LZ78-based algorithm that was developed for use in real-time communications systems (originally modems) and standardized by CCITT/ITU as V.42bis. When the trie-structured dictionary is full, a simple re-use/recovery algorithm is used to ensure that the dictionary can keep adapting to changing data. A counter cycles through the dictionary. When a new entry is needed, the counter steps through the dictionary until a leaf node is found (a node with no dependents). This is deleted and the space re-used for the new entry. This is simpler to implement than LRU or LFU and achieves equivalent performance.

<text>The Meierij van &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch (; Dutch for &quot;Bailiwick of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch&quot;) was one of the four parts of the Duchy of Brabant, the others being the Margraviate of Antwerp, the County of Brussels and the County of Leuven/Louvain. Located in the current-day Netherlands, it acquired its name from the bailiff of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, who administered the area in the name of the Dukes of Brabant. The &quot;Meierij&quot; roughly corresponds to the larger province of North Brabant.

The capital city of North Brabant and the most important city of the bailiwick is &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch (Dutch for &#x27;the Duke&#x27;s Forest&#x27;), also known as Den Bosch (&#x27;The Forest&#x27;) or Bois-le-Duc (French name). Other parts of the bailiwick are the so-called &quot;Vier Kwartieren&quot; (four quarters):
* Oisterwijk kwartier (with main city Oisterwijk)
* Kempenland kwartier (with main city Oirschot and later Eindhoven)
* Peelland kwartier (with main city Sint Oedenrode)
* Maasland kwartier (with main city Oss)

In the northeast of the bailiwick there were some free lands which were also connected to the &quot;Meierij&quot;:
* Land of Cuijk
* County of Megen
* Land of Ravenstein
* Barony of Boxmeer
* Territory Gemert (belonging to the Teutonic order)
* Land of Bokhoven

In the south, the nowadays Belgian town of Lommel belonged to the bailiwick, while the village of Luyksgestel belonged to the Prince-bishopric of Liège. In 1807 these areas were exchanged.

== Landscape ==
The Bailiwick of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch consists mainly of the poor sandy grounds of the Peel and Kempen. Those areas, which in old times were not densely populated, consisted of enormous heaths and marshlands, interrupted by woods and fenlands. In the north and east the area is surrounded by the river Maas. Numerous little rivers rise in the high sand areas and find their way to the rivers Aa and Dommel. Both rivers come together in the marshlands around &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch where they form the river Dieze that ends up in the Maas.

Since the Middle Ages the waste lands of Peel and Kempen have been cultivated. Only small parts of the once enormous heaths and marshlands have survived until modern times. In the first part of the 19th century the rivers Aa and Dommel were cultivated but nowadays they have gone back to their old run for the purpose of nature development. Legal re-division of land forms a major threat for the cultural and historical aspects of landscape at the moment.

== History ==

Historically the Meierij is the descendant of Taxandria, when that area comes under the rule of the dukes of Brabant in the 12th century. To protect the area from the counts of Gelre, the dukes founded a new ring of cities. Hendrik I of Brabant granted city rights to &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch (), Oisterwijk (1213 or 1230), Sint-Oedenrode (1232) and Eindhoven (1232). However, despite these foundings, the Meierij often suffered from conflicts and wars between Brabant and Gelre.

The bailiwick was prosperous in the 15th and first part of the 16th century. In these times many new monumental buildings were built (like the famous gothic style St. Jan&#x27;s Cathedral of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch), the activities of well-known painter Hieronymus Bosch (also called Jeroen Bosch) and the Latin school of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.
In the Eighty Years&#x27; War, times turned bad for the Meierij. The area was literally a battlefield and was heavily plagued by continuous raids. Around 1590 the area was solidly in Spanish hands. Like the southern Dutch states of Flanders and Hainaut, the Duchy Brabant-Limburg had chosen the side of the Catholic Habsburg monarchs of Spain. The strong catholic Counter-Reformation had had much influence on the population&#x27;s mentality and culture; the Bailiwick remained Catholic.

Though it was thought impossible, the mighty city of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch was captured by the Dutch Protestants in 1629. As &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch was the main capital of the Meierij, the Protestants considered the bailiwick as their possession. However the Spanish kings refused to give it up, and thus one of the most difficult times for the city&#x27;s people started, the so-called &quot;retorsie tijd&quot; in which the population suffered from both Spanish and Dutch oppression. Finally in 1648 the whole bailiwick was given to the Dutch republic at the Peace of Westphalia.

The former Brabant and Limburg areas were then placed under the reign of the generality as well as Zeelandic Flanders which had been taken from Flanders. Reign of the generality in fact meant nothing else than oppression and colonisation by the Protestants. There was no self-government and Catholicism was forbidden, which resulted in a flight of the Catholic clergy and occupation of the Catholic churches. Due to high taxes and oppression the bailiwick could not restore its old glory and became an intensely poor area without any importance. After the French war of 1795 and the proclamation of the Batavian Republic, the Meierij disappeared as a political unity and went up into Brabant. The people regained their old rights; self-government and Catholicism were not forbidden any longer.

Since 1810 the area has been part of the province of North Brabant and the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Nowadays the area is still known as Meierij and is still mostly cultural Catholic. The population is considered to have a “Burgundian character” by the other Dutch, meaning that they are supposed to be companiable people who like to party exuberantly. (The term recalls the time of Burgundian rule over the Netherlands.)

Around 1900 the area got an enormous growth of population when a combination of reviving Catholicism and economic recovery caused high birthrates. Eindhoven, Tilburg and Helmond developed into major industrial centres.

At the moment the area is again highly developing its industries (especially in Eindhoven and the surrounding region), and is one of the most prosperous areas of the Netherlands and Northwest Europe.

<text>In computing, Deflate (stylized as DEFLATE, and also called Flate) is a lossless data compression file format that uses a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding. It was designed by Phil Katz, for version 2 of his PKZIP archiving tool. Deflate was later specified in RFC 1951 (1996).

Katz also designed the original algorithm used to construct Deflate streams. This algorithm was patented as , and assigned to PKWARE, Inc. As stated in the RFC document, an algorithm producing Deflate files was widely thought to be implementable in a manner not covered by patents. This led to its widespread use – for example, in gzip compressed files and PNG image files, in addition to the ZIP file format for which Katz originally designed it. The patent has since expired.

== Stream format ==
A Deflate stream consists of a series of blocks. Each block is preceded by a 3-bit header:

* First bit: Last-block-in-stream marker:
** codice_1: This is the last block in the stream.
** codice_2: There are more blocks to process after this one.
* Second and third bits: Encoding method used for this block type:
** codice_3: A stored (a.k.a. raw or literal) section, between 0 and 65,535 bytes in length
** codice_4: A &quot;static Huffman&quot; compressed block, using a pre-agreed Huffman tree defined in the RFC
** codice_5: A &quot;dynamic Huffman&quot; compressed block, complete with the Huffman table supplied
** codice_6: Reserved—don&#x27;t use.

The &quot;stored&quot; block option adds minimal overhead and is used for data that is incompressible.

Most compressible data will end up being encoded using method codice_5, the &quot;dynamic Huffman&quot; encoding, which produces an optimized Huffman tree customized for each block of data individually. Instructions to generate the necessary Huffman tree immediately follow the block header. The static Huffman option is used for short messages, where the fixed saving gained by omitting the tree outweighs the percentage compression loss due to using a non-optimal (thus, not technically Huffman) code.

Compression is achieved through two steps:

* The matching and replacement of duplicate strings with pointers.
* Replacing symbols with new, weighted symbols based on the frequency of use.

=== Duplicate string elimination ===
Within compressed blocks, if a duplicate series of bytes is spotted (a repeated string), then a back-reference is inserted, linking to the previous location of that identical string instead. An encoded match to an earlier string consists of an 8-bit length (3–258 bytes) and a 15-bit distance (1–32,768 bytes) to the beginning of the duplicate. Relative back-references can be made across any number of blocks, as long as the distance appears within the last 32 KiB of uncompressed data decoded (termed the &quot;sliding window&quot;).

If the distance is less than the length, the duplicate overlaps itself, indicating repetition. For example, a run of 10 identical bytes can be encoded as one byte, followed by a duplicate of length 9, beginning with the previous byte.

Searching the preceding text for duplicate substrings is the most computationally expensive part of the DEFLATE algorithm, and the operation which compression level settings affect.

=== Bit reduction ===
The second compression stage consists of replacing commonly used symbols with shorter representations and less commonly used symbols with longer representations. The method used is Huffman coding which creates an unprefixed tree of non-overlapping intervals, where the length of each sequence is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the probability of that symbol needing to be encoded. The more likely it is that a symbol has to be encoded, the shorter its bit-sequence will be.

A tree is created, containing space for 288 symbols:

* 0–255: represent the literal bytes/symbols 0–255.
* 256: end of block – stop processing if last block, otherwise start processing next block.
* 257–285: combined with extra-bits, a match length of 3–258 bytes.
* 286, 287: not used, reserved and illegal but still part of the tree.

A match length code will always be followed by a distance code. Based on the distance code read, further &quot;extra&quot; bits may be read in order to produce the final distance. The distance tree contains space for 32 symbols:

* 0–3: distances 1–4
* 4–5: distances 5–8, 1 extra bit
* 6–7: distances 9–16, 2 extra bits
* 8–9: distances 17–32, 3 extra bits
* 26–27: distances 8,193–16,384, 12 extra bits
* 28–29: distances 16,385–32,768, 13 extra bits
* 30–31: not used, reserved and illegal but still part of the tree.

Note that for the match distance symbols 2–29, the number of extra bits can be calculated as formula_1.

The two codes (the 288-symbol length/literal tree and the 32-symbol distance tree) are themselves encoded as canonical Huffman codes by giving the bit length of the code for each symbol. The bit lengths are themselves run-length encoded to produce as compact a representation as possible. As an alternative to including the tree representation, the &quot;static tree&quot; option provides standard fixed Huffman trees. The compressed size using the static trees can be computed using the same statistics (the number of times each symbol appears) as are used to generate the dynamic trees, so it is easy for a compressor to choose whichever is smaller.

== Encoder/compressor ==
During the compression stage, it is the &quot;encoder&quot; that chooses the amount of time spent looking for matching strings. The zlib/gzip reference implementation allows the user to select from a sliding scale of likely resulting compression-level vs. speed of encoding. Options range from codice_2 (do not attempt compression, just store uncompressed) to codice_9 representing the maximum capability of the reference implementation in zlib/gzip.

Other Deflate encoders have been produced, all of which will also produce a compatible bitstream capable of being decompressed by any existing Deflate decoder. Differing implementations will likely produce variations on the final encoded bit-stream produced. The focus with non-zlib versions of an encoder has normally been to produce a more efficiently compressed and smaller encoded stream.

=== Deflate64/Enhanced Deflate ===
Deflate64, specified by PKWARE, is a proprietary variant of Deflate. It&#x27;s fundamentally the same algorithm. What has changed is the increase in dictionary size from 32 KB to 64 KB, an extension of the distance codes to 16 bits so that they may address a range of 64 KB, and the length code, which is extended to 16 bits so that it may define lengths of three to 65,538 bytes. This leads to Deflate64 having a longer compression time, and potentially a slightly higher compression ratio, than Deflate. Several free and/or open source projects support Deflate64, such as 7-Zip, while others, such as zlib, do not, as a result of the proprietary nature of the procedure and the very modest performance increase over Deflate.

== Using Deflate in new software ==
Implementations of Deflate are freely available in many languages. Apps written in C typically use the zlib library (under the permissive zlib License). Apps in Borland Pascal (and compatible languages) can use paszlib. Apps in C++ can take advantage of the improved Deflate library in 7-Zip. Both Java and .NET Framework offer out-of-the-box support for Deflate in their libraries (respectively, codice_10 and System.IO.Compression). Apps in Ada can use Zip-Ada (pure) or ZLib-Ada.

=== Encoder implementations ===
* PKZIP: the first implementation, originally done by Phil Katz as part of PKZip
* zlib: standard reference implementation adopted in many apps because of its open-source, permissive license. See for higher-performance forks.
* Crypto++: contains a public-domain implementation in C++ aimed at reducing potential security vulnerabilities. The author, Wei Dai states &quot;This code is less clever, but hopefully more understandable and maintainable [than zlib]&quot;.
* 7-Zip: written by Igor Pavlov in C++, this version is freely licensed and achieves higher compression than zlib at the expense of CPU usage. Has an option to use the DEFLATE64 storage format.
* PuTTY &#x27;sshzlib.c&#x27;: a standalone implementation under the MIT License by Simon Tatham, it has full decoding capability, but only supports static tree only creation
* libflate: part of Plan 9 from Bell Labs, implements deflate compression
* Hyperbac: uses its own proprietary compression library (in C++ and Assembly) with an option to implement the DEFLATE64 storage format
* Zopfli: C implementation under the Apache License by Google; achieves higher compression at the expense of CPU usage. ZopfliPNG is a variation of Zopfli for use with PNG files.
* igzip: an encoder written in the x86 assembly language, released by Intel under the MIT License. 3x faster than zlib -1. Useful for compressing genomic data.
* libdeflate: a library for fast, whole-buffer DEFLATE-based compression and decompression. Libdeflate is heavily optimized, especially on x86 processors.

AdvanceCOMP uses the higher compression ratio versions of Deflate in 7-Zip, libdeflate, and Zopfli to enable recompression of gzip, PNG, MNG and ZIP files with the possibility of smaller file sizes than zlib is able to achieve at maximum settings.

=== Hardware encoders ===
* AHA361-PCIX/AHA362-PCIX from Comtech AHA . Comtech produced a PCI-X card (PCI-ID: codice_11) capable of compressing streams using Deflate at a rate of up to 3.0 Gbit/s (375 MB/s) for incoming uncompressed data. Accompanying the Linux kernel driver for the AHA361-PCIX is an &quot;codice_12&quot; utility and customised &quot;codice_13&quot; capable of using the hardware compression from Apache. The hardware is based on a Xilinx Virtex FPGA and four custom AHA3601 ASICs. The AHA361/AHA362 boards are limited to only handling static Huffman blocks and require software to be modified to add support — the cards were not able to support the full Deflate specification, meaning they could only reliably decode their own output (a stream that did not contain any dynamic Huffman type 2 blocks).
* StorCompress 300/MX3 from Indra Networks. This is a range of PCI (PCI-ID: codice_14) or PCI-X cards featuring between one and six compression engines with claimed processing speeds of up to 3.6 Gbit/s (450 MB/s). A version of the cards are available with the separate brand &quot;WebEnhance&quot; specifically designed for web-serving use rather than SAN or backup use; a PCIe revision, the MX4E is also produced.
* AHA363-PCIe/AHA364-PCIe/AHA367-PCIe. In 2008, Comtech started producing two PCIe cards (codice_15/codice_16) with a new hardware AHA3610 encoder chip. The new chip was designed to be capable of a sustained 2.5 Gbit/s. Using two of these chips, the AHA363-PCIe board can process Deflate at a rate of up to 5.0 Gbit/s (625 MB/s) using the two channels (two compression and two decompression). The AHA364-PCIe variant is an encode-only version of the card designed for out-going load balancers and instead has multiple register sets to allow 32 independent &quot;virtual&quot; compression channels feeding two physical compression engines. Linux, Microsoft Windows, and OpenSolaris kernel device drivers are available for both of the new cards, along with a modified zlib system library so that dynamically linked applications can automatically use the hardware support without internal modification. The AHA367-PCIe board (codice_17) is similar to the AHA363-PCIe but uses four AHA3610 chips for a sustained compression rate of 10 Gbit/s (1250 MB/s). Unlike the AHA362-PCIX, the decompression engines on the AHA363-PCIe and AHA367-PCIe boards are fully deflate compliant.

== Decoder/decompressor ==
Inflate is the decoding process that takes a Deflate bitstream for decompression and correctly produces the original full-size data or file.

=== Inflate-only implementations ===
The normal intent with an alternative Inflate implementation is highly optimized decoding speed, or extremely predictable RAM usage for micro-controller embedded systems.

<doc id="75861" wikidata="Q180081" url="?curid=75861" title="Cato the Elder">
<text>Marcus Porcius Cato (, ; 234–149 BC), also known as Cato the Censor (), the Elder and the Wise, was a Roman soldier, senator, and historian known for his conservatism and opposition to Hellenization. He was the first to write history in Latin with his &quot;Origines&quot;, a now fragmentary work on the history of Rome. His work &quot;De agri cultura&quot;, a treatise on agriculture, rituals, and recipes, is the oldest extant prose written in the Latin language. His epithet &quot;Elder&quot; distinguishes him from his great-grandson Senator Cato the Younger, who opposed Julius Caesar.

He came from an ancient plebeian family who were noted for their military service. Like his forefathers, Cato was devoted to agriculture when not serving in the army. Having attracted the attention of Lucius Valerius Flaccus, he was brought to Rome. He was successively military tribune (214 BC), quaestor (204), aedile (199), praetor (198), consul (195) together with Flaccus, and censor (184). As praetor, he expelled usurers from Sardinia. As censor, he tried to save Rome&#x27;s ancestral customs and combat Hellenistic influences.

==Biography==

Cato the Elder was born in the municipal town of Tusculum, like some generations of his ancestors. His father had earned a reputation as a brave soldier, and his great-grandfather had received a reward from the state for having had five horses killed under him in battle. However, the Tusculan Porcii had never obtained the privileges of the Roman magistracy. Cato the Elder, their famous descendant, at the beginning of his career in Rome, was regarded as a &quot;novus homo&quot; (new man), and the feeling of his unsatisfactory position, working along with the belief of his inherent superiority, aggravated and drove his ambition. Early in life, he so far exceeded the previous deeds of his predecessors that he is frequently spoken of not only as the leader, but as the founder of the Porcia gens.

===Cognomen Cato===
His ancestors for three generations had been named Marcus Porcius, and it was said by Plutarch that at first he was known by the additional cognomen &quot;Priscus&quot;, but was afterwards called Cato—a word (from Latin &quot;catus&quot;) indicating &#x27;common sense that is the result of natural wisdom combined with experience&#x27;. Priscus, like &quot;Major&quot;, may have been merely an epithet used to distinguish him from the later Cato the Younger. 

There is no precise information as to when he first received the title of Cato, which may have been given in childhood as a symbol of distinction. The qualities implied in the word Cato were acknowledged by the plainer and less outdated title of &quot;Sapiens&quot;, by which he was so well known in his old age that Cicero says it became his virtual &quot;cognomen&quot;. From the number and eloquence of his speeches, he was a gifted orator, but Cato the Censor (&quot;Cato Censorius&quot;), and Cato the Elder are now his most common, as well as his most characteristic names, since he carried out the office of Censor with extraordinary standing and was the only Cato who ever held it.

===Deducing Cato&#x27;s date of birth===
The date of Cato&#x27;s birth has to be deduced from conflicting reports of his age at the time of his death, which is known to have happened in 149 BC. According to the chronology of Cicero, Cato was born in 234 BC, in the year before the first Consulship of Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, and died at the age of 85, in the consulship of Lucius Marcius Censorinus and Manius Manilius. Pliny agrees with Cicero. Other authors exaggerate the age of Cato. According to Valerius Maximus he survived his 86th year, according to Livy and Plutarch he was 90 years old when he died. These exaggerated ages, however, are inconsistent with a statement of Cato himself that is recorded by Plutarch.

===Youth===

====In the Punic Wars====

When Cato was very young, after his father&#x27;s death, he inherited a small property in Sabine territory, at a distance from his native town. There, he spent most of his childhood overseeing the operations of the farm, learning business and the rural economy. Near this land was a small hut owned by Manius Curius Dentatus, whose military feats and rigidly simple character were remembered and admired in the neighborhood. Cato was inspired to imitate that character, hoping to match the glory of Dentatus.

Soon an opportunity came for a military campaign. In 218 BC Hannibal Barca attacked one of Rome&#x27;s allies, starting the Second Punic War. Experts express some disagreement about Cato&#x27;s early military life. In 214, he served at Capua, and the historian Wilhelm Drumann imagines that already, at the age of 20, he was a military tribune. Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus had the command in this area, Campania, during the year of his fourth consulship. 

At the siege of Tarentum, in 209, Cato was again at the side of Fabius. Two years later, Cato was one of the men who went with the consul Claudius Nero on his northern march from Lucania to check the progress of Hasdrubal Barca. It is recorded that the services of Cato contributed to the decisive and important victory of Sena at the Battle of the Metaurus, where Hasdrubal was slain.

Cato later gave several vehement speeches, which he often ended by saying &quot;Carthago delenda est&quot;, or &quot;Carthage must be destroyed.&quot; He encouraged the Romans to attack Carthage.

====Between the wars====
In the pauses between campaigns Cato returned to his Sabine farm, where he dressed simply, working and behaving like his laborers. Young as he was, the neighboring farmers liked his tough mode of living, enjoyed his old-fashioned and concise proverbs, and had a high regard for his abilities. His own active personality made him willing and eager to make himself available in the service of his neighbors. He was selected to act, sometimes as an arbitrator of disputes, and sometimes as a supporter in local causes, which were probably tried in front of &quot;recuperatores&quot;, the judges for causes of great public interest. Consequently, he was enabled to strengthen by practice his oratorical abilities, to gain self-confidence, to observe the manners of men, to analyze the diversity of human nature, to apply the rules of law, and to practically investigate the principles of justice.

====Follower of the old Roman strictness====
In the area surrounding Cato&#x27;s Sabine farm were the lands of Lucius Valerius Flaccus, a young nobleman of significant influence and high patrician family. Flaccus could not help remarking on Cato&#x27;s energy, his military talent, his eloquence, his frugal and simple life, and his traditional principles. Flaccus himself was a member of that purist patrician faction which displayed its adherence to the stricter virtues of the Roman character. 

Within Roman society a transition was in progress—from Samnite rusticity to Grecian civilization and oriental luxuriance. The chief magistracies of the state had become almost hereditary for a few wealthy and upper-class families. They were popular by acts of generosity and charming manners, and they collected material wealth from their clients and followers, as well as intellectual prowess provided by their education, taste in the fine arts, and knowledge of literature. 

Nonetheless, the less fortunate nobles, envious of this exclusive oligarchy and critical of the decadence and luxury, formed a party with a more conservative and ascetic ideology. In their eyes, rusticity and austerity were the marks of Sabine character, and of the old Roman inflexible integrity and love of order. Marcus Claudius Marcellus, Scipio Africanus and his family, and Titus Quinctius Flamininus may be taken as representative of the new culture; Cato&#x27;s friends, Fabius and Flaccus, were the leading men in the faction defending the old plainness.

====Path to magistracies====
Flaccus was a perceptive politician, who looked for young and emergent men to support him. He had observed Cato&#x27;s martial spirit and heard his eloquent tongue. He knew how much courage and persuasiveness were valued at Rome. He also knew that distinction achieved on the battlefield opened the way to achievements in the higher civil offices. Flaccus knew too that for a stranger like Cato, the only way to the magisterial honours was success in the Roman Forum. 

For that reason, he suggested to Cato that he shift his ambition to the field of Roman politics. The advice was followed. Invited to the townhouse of Flaccus, and ratified by his support, Cato began to distinguish himself in the forum, and became a candidate for assuming a post in the magistracy.

===Early military career===

====Quaestor====
In 205 BC, Cato was appointed quaestor, and in the next year (204) he entered upon the duties of his place of work, following Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major to Sicily. When Scipio, after much opposition, obtained from the Senate permission to transport armed forces from Sicily to Africa, Cato and Gaius Laelius were appointed to escort the baggage ships. Yet there proved not to be the friendliness of cooperation between Cato and Scipio which ought to have existed between a quaestor and his proconsul.

Fabius had opposed the permission given to Scipio to carry the attack to the enemy&#x27;s home, and Cato, whose appointment was intended to monitor Scipio&#x27;s behavior, adopted the views of his friend. Plutarch reports that the lenient discipline of the troops under Scipio&#x27;s command and the exaggerated expenses incurred by the general provoked Cato&#x27;s protests, such that Scipio, immediately afterward, replied angrily, saying he would give an account of victories, not of money. 

Cato left his place of duty after the dispute with Scipio about the latter&#x27;s alleged extravagance, and returning to Rome, condemned the uneconomical activities of his general to the senate. Plutarch went on to say that at the joint request of Cato and Fabius, a commission of tribunes was sent to Sicily to examine Scipio&#x27;s activity. Upon their review of his extensive and careful arrangements for the transport of the troops, they determined he was not guilty of Cato&#x27;s charges. 

Plutarch&#x27;s version, which seemed to attribute to Cato the wrongdoing of quitting his post before his time, is barely consistent with Livy&#x27;s narrative. If Livy is correct, the commission was sent because of the complaints of the inhabitants of Locri, who had been harshly oppressed by Quintus Pleminius, Scipio&#x27;s legate. Livy says nothing of Cato&#x27;s interference in this matter, but mentions the bitterness with which Fabius blamed Scipio for corrupting military discipline and for having illegally left his province to take the town of Locri.

The author of the abridged life of Cato, commonly considered the work of Cornelius Nepos, asserts that Cato, after his return from Africa, put in at Sardinia, and brought the poet Quintus Ennius in his own ship from the island to Italy. But because Sardinia is rather out of the line of the trip to Rome, it is more likely that the first contact between Ennius and Cato happened at a later date, when the latter was praetor in Sardinia.

====Aedile and praetor====
In 199 BC Cato was elected aedile, and with his colleague Helvius, restored the Plebeian Games, and gave upon that occasion a banquet in honour of Jupiter. In 198 BC he was elected praetor, and obtained Sardinia as his province, with the command of 3,000 infantry and 200 cavalry. Here he took the earliest opportunity to demonstrate his main beliefs by practicing his strict public morality. He reduced official operating costs, walked his trips with a single assistant, and placed his own frugality in contrast with the opulence of provincial magistrates. The rites of religion were celebrated with thrift, justice was administered with strict impartiality, and usury was severely punished. According to Aurelius Victor, a revolt in Sardinia was subdued by Cato during his praetorship.

===Consul===

====Enactment of the Porcian Laws====

In 195, when he was only 39 years old, Cato was elected junior consul to his old friend and patron Flaccus. During his consulship, he enacted the first two of the Porcian Laws, which expanded the protections of Roman citizens against degrading or capricious punishment under the Republic&#x27;s Valerian Law.

====Repeal of the Oppian Law====

In 215, at the height of the Second Punic War and at the request of the tribune of the plebs Gaius Oppius, the Oppian Law (&quot;Lex Oppia&quot;), intended to restrict the luxury and extravagance of women in order to save money for the public treasury, was passed. The law specified that no woman could own more than half an ounce of gold, nor wear a garment of several colours, nor drive a carriage with horses closer than a mile to the city, except to attend public celebrations of religious rites.

After Hannibal was defeated and Rome was resplendent with Carthaginian wealth, tribunes Marcus Fundanius and Lucius Valerius proposed to abolish the Oppian law, but tribunes Marcus Junius Brutus and Titus Junius Brutus opposed doing so. This conflict spawned far more interest than the most important state affairs. Middle-aged married Roman women crowded the streets, blocked access to the forum, and intercepted their approaching husbands, demanding to restore the traditional ornaments of Roman matrons.

They even begged the praetors, consuls and other magistrates. Even Flaccus hesitated, but his colleague Cato was inflexible, and made a characteristically impolite speech, which was later retold by Livy. The dissenting tribunes withdrew their opposition and the Oppian law was repealed by vote of all tribes. Women went in procession through the streets and the forum, dressed up with their now legitimate finery.

During the controversy Cato maintained a firm opposition to the repeal, so he suffered politically and personally when it was finally repealed. Not only had the former consul been rejected by the senate by unanimous decision, but Flaccus failed to stand with him. However, perhaps because of Flaccus&#x27; connection to Lucius Valerius he was deliberately staying out of the controversy. He soon set sail for his appointed province, Hispania Citerior.

====Post in Hispania Citerior====
In his campaign in Hispania, Cato behaved in keeping with his reputation of untiring hard work and alertness. He lived soberly, sharing the food and the labours of the common soldier. Wherever it was possible, he personally superintended the execution of his orders. His movements were reported as bold and rapid, and he always pushed for victory. 
His operations appear to have been carefully designed, and were coordinated with the plans of other generals in other parts of Hispania. His manoeuvres were considered original and successful. He managed to benefit by setting tribe against tribe, and took native mercenaries into his pay.

The details of the campaign, as related by Livy, and illustrated by incidental anecdotes by Plutarch, are full of horror and they make clear that Cato reduced Hispania Citerior to subjection with great speed and little mercy. We read of multitudes who put themselves to death because of the dishonour after they had been stripped of all their arms, of extensive massacres of surrendered troops, and the frequent harsh plunders. The phrase bellum se ipsum alet —the war feeds itself— was coined by Cato during this period. His conduct in Hispania were not contradictory with the traditional ideals of a Roman soldier, or with his own firm and over-assertive temper. He claimed to have destroyed more towns in Hispania than he had spent days in that country.

====Roman triumph====
After he reduced the area between the River Iberus and the Pyrenees to a resentful and, as it turned out, temporary obedience, Cato turned his attention to administrative reforms, and increased the revenues of the province by improvements in the working of the iron and silver mines.

For his achievements in Hispania, the senate decreed a thanksgiving ceremony of three days. In the course of the year 194 BC, he returned to Rome and was rewarded with the honour of a Roman triumph, at which he exhibited an extraordinary quantity of captured brass, silver, and gold, both coin and lingots. Cato distributed the monetary prize to his soldiery, and was more liberal than might have been expected from his vigorous parsimony.

====End of consulship====
The return of Cato seems to have accelerated the enmity of Scipio Africanus, who was Consul in 194 BC and is said to have desired the command of the province in which Cato was harvesting notoriety. There is some disagreement between Nepos (or the pseudo-Nepos), and Plutarch, in their accounts of this topic. Nepos claims that Scipio failed to obtain the province, and, offended by the rejection, remained after his consulship in a private capacity at Rome. Plutarch claims that Scipio, who was disgusted by Cato&#x27;s severity, was appointed to succeed him but could not convince the senate to censure Cato&#x27;s administration, and passed his consulship in inactivity. Plutarch was probably mistaken, judging by the statement in Livy, that in 194 BC, Sextus Digitius was appointed to the province of Hispania Citerior. The notion that Scipio was appointed successor to Cato in Hispania may have arisen from a double confusion of name and place, since Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica was chosen in 194 BC to the province of Hispania Ulterior.

However true this account, Cato used his eloquence and produced detailed financial accounts to successfully defend against criticism of his consulship. The known fragments of the speeches (or one speech under different names) made after his return attest to the strength of his arguments.

Plutarch states that, after his Consulship, Cato accompanied Tiberius Sempronius Longus as legatus to Thrace, but this seems incorrect because, although Scipio Africanus believed that one Consul should have Macedonia, Sempronius was soon in Cisalpine Gaul, and in 193 BC Cato was in Rome dedicating a small temple to Victoria Virgo.

===Late military career===

====Battle of Thermopylae====
The military career of Cato had not yet ended. In 191, he, along with his old associate Lucius Valerius Flaccus, were appointed as lieutenant-generals (legatus) under the consul Manius Acilius Glabrio, who had been dispatched to Greece to oppose the invasion of Antiochus III the Great, King of the Seleucid Empire. In the decisive Battle of Thermopylae (191 BC), which led to the downfall of Antiochus, Cato behaved with his usual valor, and enjoyed good fortune. By a daring and difficult advance, he surprised and defeated a body of the enemy&#x27;s Aetolian auxiliaries, who were posted upon the Callidromus, the highest peak of the range of Mount Oeta.

Then, coming to the aid of forces under Flaccus&#x27;s command, he began a sudden descent from the hills above the royal camp, and the panic caused by this unexpected movement promptly turned the day in favor of the Romans, and signaled the end of the Seleucid invasion of Greece. After the action, the consul hugged Cato with the greatest warmth and attributed to him the whole credit of the victory. This fact rests on the authority of Cato himself, who, like Cicero, often indulged in the habit, offensive to modern taste, of sounding his own praises.

After an interval spent in the pursuit of Antiochus and the pacification of Greece, Cato was sent to Rome by Glabrio to announce the successful outcome of the campaign, and he performed his journey with such celerity that he had started his report in the senate before the return of Lucius Cornelius Scipio, the later conqueror of Antiochus, who had been sent off from Greece a few days before him.

====Doubtful visit to Athens====
During the campaign in Greece under Glabrio, Plutarch&#x27;s account (albeit rejected by historian Wilhelm Drumann) suggests that before the Battle of Thermopylae, Cato was chosen to prevent Corinth, Patrae, and Aegium from siding with Antiochus. During this period, Cato visited Athens where, in trying to prevent the Athenians from listening to the propositions of the Seleucid king, Cato addressed them in a Latin speech, which required an interpreter to be understood by the audience.

Whether this was out of necessity or merely a choice by Cato remains unclear, since the assertion that he might very well have already known Greek at the time can be made from anecdotal evidence. For example, Plutarch said that while at Tarentum in his youth he had developed a close friendship with Nearchus, who was himself a Greek philosopher. Similarly, Aurelius Victor stated he had received instruction in Greek from Ennius while praetor in Sardinia. Nevertheless, because his speech was an affair of state, it is probable that he complied with the Roman norms of the day in using the Latin language while practicing diplomacy, which was considered as a mark of Roman dignity.

===Influence in Rome===
His reputation as a soldier was now established; henceforth he preferred to serve the state at home, scrutinizing the conduct of the candidates for public honours and of generals in the field. If he was not personally engaged in the prosecution of the Scipiones (Africanus and Asiaticus) for corruption, it was his spirit that animated the attack upon them. Even Scipio Africanus—who refused to reply to the charge, saying only, &quot;Romans, this is the day on which I conquered Hannibal&quot; and was absolved by acclamation—found it necessary to retire, self-banished, to his villa at Liternum. Cato&#x27;s enmity dated from the African campaign when he quarreled with Scipio for his lavish distribution of the spoil among the troops, and his general luxury and extravagance.

Cato was also opposed to the spread of Hellenic culture, which he believed threatened to destroy the rugged simplicity of the conventional Roman type. It was during this censorship that his determination to oppose Hellenism was most strongly exhibited, and hence, the behavior from which was derived the title (censor) by which he is most generally distinguished. He revised with unsparing severity the lists of senators and knights, ejecting from either order the men whom he judged unworthy of membership, either on moral grounds or on the basis of their lack of the prescribed means.

Senators were supposed to be independently wealthy, their income to be based on land ownership rather than commerce, and there was also a financial &quot;means test.&quot; A Senator was expected to have what we would call a &quot;net worth&quot; of over a million sestertii, the standard Roman silver coin. Equivalencies in modern currencies are both misleading and impossible, but nevertheless, it would be fair to characterize the Roman Senate as a literal &quot;Millionaires club.&quot; The expulsion of L. Quinctius Flamininus for wanton cruelty was an example of his rigid justice.

His regulations against luxury were very stringent. He imposed a heavy tax upon dress and personal adornment, especially of women, and upon young slaves purchased as favourites. In 181 BC he supported the &quot;lex Orchia&quot; (according to others, he first opposed its introduction, and subsequently its repeal), which prescribed a limit to the number of guests at an entertainment, and in 169 BC the &quot;lex Voconia&quot;, one of the provisions of which was intended to limit the accumulation of what Cato considered an undue amount of wealth in the hands of women.

===Public works===
Among other things he repaired the aqueducts, mended as well as extended the sewage system, and prevented private persons from drawing off public water for their own use. The Aqua Appia was the first aqueduct of Rome. It was constructed in 312 BC by Appius Claudius Caecus, the same Roman censor who also built the important Via Appia. Unauthorised plumbing into Rome&#x27;s aqueducts had always been a problem, as Frontinus records much later. Cato also ordered the demolition of shops and private houses which encroached on the public way, and built the first known basilica in 184 BC, named Basilica Porcia, in the Forum near the Curia (Livy, &quot;History&quot;, 39.44; Plutarch, &quot;Marcus Cato&quot;, 19). It served as a political and commercial activity center where courts were held and merchants accumulated. Some accounts state that the basilica was burned by the conflagration of Publius Clodius Pulcher&#x27;s funeral pyre after his death in 52 BC, and was probably never rebuilt. 

Today, there are no remains of Basilica Porcia. Cato had also raised the amount paid by the publicani for the right to collect taxes and, at the same time, reduced the contract prices for the construction of public works. Which was seen as most beneficial for the State and least for contractors, creating controversies around him. According to Plutarch, the Senate &quot;strongly opposed the erection of the basilica&quot;. Cato&#x27;s expenditure on public works were objected by the party of Titus Flamininus and also deemed trivial by the Senate. After gaining influence, Flamininus repealed the public rentals and contracts of Cato while encouraging tribunes to ferment opprobrium against him and fine him.

===Later years===
From the date of his censorship (184) to his death in 149, Cato held no public office, but continued to distinguish himself in the Senate as the persistent opponent of the new ideas. He was struck with horror, along with many other Romans, at the licence of the Bacchanalian mysteries, which he attributed to the influence of Greek manners, and he vehemently urged the dismissal of the philosophers Carneades, Diogenes, and Critolaus, who had come as ambassadors from Athens, on account of what he believed was the dangerous nature of their ideas. He also uttered warnings against the influence of Chaldean astrologers who had entered Italy along with Greek culture.

He had a horror of physicians, who were chiefly Greeks. He obtained the release of Polybius, the historian, and his fellow prisoners, contemptuously asking whether the Senate had nothing more important to do than discuss whether a few Greeks should die at Rome or in their own land. It was not until his eightieth year that he made his first acquaintance with Greek literature, though some think after examining his writings that he may have had a knowledge of Greek works for much of his life.

In his last years, he was known for strenuously urging his countrymen to prosecute the Third Punic War and to destroy Carthage. In 157, he was one of the deputies sent to Carthage to arbitrate between the Carthaginians and Massinissa, king of Numidia. The mission was unsuccessful and the commissioners returned home, but Cato was so struck by Carthage&#x27;s growing prosperity that he was convinced that the security of Rome depended on its annihilation. From then on, he began concluding his speeches in the Senate —on any topic whatsoever— with the cry, &quot;Carthage must be destroyed&quot; (&#x27;). Other times, his phrase is fully quoted as &quot;Moreover, I advise that Carthage must be destroyed&quot; (&#x27;). Cicero&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Cato the Elder on Old Age&quot; also depicted Cato&#x27;s antipathy to Carthage. According to Ben Kiernan, Cato may have made the first recorded incitement to genocide.

To Cato the individual life was a continual discipline, and public life was the discipline of the many. He regarded the individual householder as the germ of the family, the family as the germ of the state. By strict economy of time he accomplished an immense amount of work; he demanded his dependents practice a similar dedication, and proved himself a hard husband, a strict father, and a severe and cruel master. There was little difference, apparently, in the esteem in which he held his wife and his slaves, although perhaps his pride caused him to take a warmer interest in his sons, Marcus Porcius Cato Licinianus and Marcus Porcius Cato Salonianus.

To the Romans themselves little in this behavior seemed worthy of censure, it was respected rather as a traditional example of the old Roman manners. In the remarkable passage in which Livy describes the character of Cato, there is no word of blame for the rigid discipline of his household.
==Writings==

Cato was and remains famous as an author as well. He was a historian, the first Latin prose writer of any importance, and the first author of a history of Italy in Latin. Some have argued that if it were not for the impact of Cato&#x27;s writing, Latin might have been supplanted by Greek as the literary language of Rome. He was also one of the very few early Latin authors who could claim Latin as a native language.
* His manual on running a farm (&quot;De agri cultura&quot; or &quot;On Agriculture&quot;) (c. 160) is his only work that survives complete. It is a miscellaneous collection of rules of husbandry and management, including sidelights on country life in the 2nd century BC. Cato undoubtedly used the earlier Carthaginian 28 volume work of one known only as Mago titled &quot;De Re&quot; &quot;Rustica&quot;. At Cato&#x27;s insistence, the original volumes were the only literary works retrieved from the Great Library of Carthage before it was destroyed with all of Carthage to end the 3rd Punic War. &quot;De agri cultura&quot; was adopted by many as a textbook, at a time when Romans were expanding their agricultural activities into larger-scale and more specialized business ventures geared towards profitability. It assumes a farm run and staffed by slaves: Cato advises hiring gangs for the olive harvest, and was noted for his chilling advice on keeping slaves continually at work, on reducing rations for slaves when sick, and on selling slaves that are old or sickly. Intended for reading aloud and discussing with farm workers, &quot;De agri cultura&quot; was widely read and much quoted (sometimes inaccurately) by later Latin authors. Cato the Elder ranked the vineyard as the most important aspect when judging a farm. This was because of the profitability of the wine trade during that time. Grain pastures were ranked sixth due to the grain crisis.
* The &quot;Origines&quot; in seven books (BC) -- of which several fragments still survive—related the history of the Italian towns with special attention to Rome, from their legendary or historical foundation to his own day. Written to teach Romans what it means to be Roman and used to teach his own son how to read, Cato the Elder wrote &quot;ab urbe condita&quot; (from the founding of the city), and the early history is filled with legends illustrating Roman virtues. The &quot;Origines&quot; also spoke of how not only Rome, but the other Italian towns were venerable, and claimed the Romans were indeed superior to the Greeks. As it avoided using consular dating, it was not cited much by other historians. It was a source for Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; and is referenced by other writers including Cicero.
* Under the Roman Empire a collection of about 150 political speeches by Cato existed. In these he pursued his political policies, fought verbal vendettas, and opposed what he saw as Rome&#x27;s moral decline. Not even the titles of all of these speeches are now known, but fragments of some of them are preserved. Cato included parts of at least two of his speeches, &quot;On Behalf of the Rhodians&quot; and &quot;Against Galba&quot;, in his historical work the &quot;Origines&quot;. The first to which we can give a date was &quot;On the Improper Election of the Aediles&quot;, delivered in 202 BC. The collection included several speeches from the year of his consulship, followed by a self-justifying retrospect &quot;On His Consulship&quot; and by numerous speeches delivered when he was Censor. It is not clear whether Cato allowed others to read and copy his written texts (in other words, whether he &quot;published&quot; the speeches) or whether their circulation in written form began after his death.
* &quot;On Soldiery&quot; was perhaps a practical manual comparable to &quot;On Farming&quot;. This work is considered lost
* &quot;On the Law Relating to Priests and Augurs&quot; was a topic that would follow naturally from some of the sections of &quot;On Farming&quot;. Only one brief extract from this work is known.
* &quot;Praecepta ad Filium&quot;, &quot;Maxims addressed to his son,&quot; from which the following extract survives:

* &quot;Carmen de moribus&quot; (&quot;Poem on morality&quot;), apparently in prose in spite of the title.
* A collection of &quot;Sayings&quot;, some of them translated from Greek.

The two surviving collections of proverbs known as the &quot;Distichs of Cato&quot; and the &quot;Monosticha Catonis&quot; probably belong to the 4th century AD and are not works of Cato the Elder.

==Legacy==
The wrinkle ridge system Dorsa Cato on the Moon is named after Cato.

The comune of Monte Porzio Catone, one of the Castelli Romani and close to the ruins of Tusculum, is named in honour of the Porcius Cato family.

Cato is portrayed by Vittorio Gassman in &quot;Scipione detto anche l&#x27;Africano&quot;, a 1971 Italian film starring Marcello Mastroianni as Scipio Africanus.

<text>Cyrus Hall McCormick (February 15, 1809 – May 13, 1884) was an American inventor and businessman who founded the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, which became part of the International Harvester Company in 1902. Originally from the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, he and many members of the McCormick family became prominent residents of Chicago.

McCormick always claimed credit as the single inventor of the mechanical reaper. He was, however, one of several designing engineers who produced working models in the 1830s. His efforts built on more than two decades of work by his father Robert McCormick Jr., with the aid of Jo Anderson, an enslaved African-American man held by the family. He also successfully developed a modern company, with manufacturing, marketing, and a sales force to market his products.

==Early life and career==

Cyrus Hall McCormick was born on February 15, 1809, in Raphine, Virginia. He was the eldest of eight children born to inventor Robert McCormick Jr. and Mary Ann &quot;Polly&quot; Hall. As Cyrus&#x27;s father saw the potential of the design for a mechanical reaper, he applied for a patent to claim it as his own invention. He worked for 28 years on a horse-drawn mechanical reaper to harvest grain, but was never able to produce a reliable version.

Building on his father&#x27;s years of development, Cyrus took up the project aided by Jo Anderson, an enslaved African-American man held on the McCormick plantation. A few machines based on a design of Patrick Bell of Scotland (which had not been patented) were available in the United States in these years. The Bell machine was pushed by horses. The McCormick design was pulled by horses and cut the grain to one side of the team.

Cyrus McCormick held one of his first demonstrations of mechanical reaping at the nearby village of Steeles Tavern, Virginia in 1831. He claimed to have developed a final version of the reaper in 18 months. The young McCormick was granted a patent on the reaper on June 21, 1834, two years after having been granted a patent for a self-sharpening plow. None was sold, however, because the machine could not handle varying conditions.

The McCormick family also worked together in a blacksmith/metal smelting business. The panic of 1837 almost caused the family to go into bankruptcy when a partner pulled out. In 1839 McCormick started doing more public demonstrations of the reaper, but local farmers still thought the machine was unreliable. He did sell one in 1840, but none for 1841.

Using the endorsement of his father&#x27;s first customer, Khane Hale, for a machine built by McPhetrich, Cyrus continually attempted to improve the design. He finally sold seven reapers in 1842, 29 in 1843, and 50 in 1844. They were all built manually in the family farm shop. He received a second patent for reaper improvements on January 31, 1845.

As word spread about the reaper, McCormick noticed orders arriving from farther west, where farms tended to be larger and the land flatter. While he was in Washington, D.C. to get his 1845 patent, he heard about a factory in Brockport, New York, where he contracted to have the machines mass-produced. He also licensed several others across the country to build the reaper, but their quality often proved poor, which hurt the product&#x27;s reputation.

==Move to Chicago==
In 1847, after their father&#x27;s death, Cyrus and his brother Leander J. McCormick (1819–1900) moved to Chicago, where they established a factory to build their machines. At the time, other cities in the midwestern United States, such as Cleveland, Ohio; St. Louis, Missouri; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin were more established. Chicago had the best water transportation from the east over the Great Lakes for his raw materials, as well as railroad connections to the west where most of his customers would be.

When McCormick tried to renew his patent in 1848, the U.S. Patent Office noted that a similar machine had already been patented by Obed Hussey a few months earlier. McCormick claimed he had invented his machine in 1831, but the renewal was denied. William Manning of Plainfield, New Jersey had also received a patent for his reaper in May 1831, but at the time, Manning was evidently not defending his patent.

McCormick&#x27;s brother William Sanderson McCormick (1815–1865) moved to Chicago in 1849, and joined the company to take care of financial affairs. The McCormick reaper sold well, partially as a result of savvy and innovative business practices. Their products came onto the market just as the explosive expansion of railroads offered inexpensive wide distribution. McCormick developed marketing and sales techniques, forming a wide network of salesmen trained to demonstrate the operation of his machines in the field, as well as to get parts quickly and repair machines in the field if necessary during crucial seasons in the farm year.

A company advertisement was a take-off of the &quot;Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way&quot; mural by Emanuel Leutze; it added to the title: &quot;with McCormick Reapers in the Van.&quot;

In 1851, McCormick traveled to London to display a reaper at the Crystal Palace Exhibition. After his machine successfully harvested a field of green wheat while the Hussey machine failed, he won a gold medal and was admitted to the Legion of Honor. His celebration was short-lived after he learned that he had lost a court challenge to Hussey&#x27;s patent.

==Legal controversies and success==

Another McCormick Company competitor was John Henry Manny of Rockford, Illinois. After the Manny Reaper beat the McCormick version at the Paris Exposition of 1855, McCormick filed a lawsuit against Manny for patent infringement. McCormick demanded that Manny stop producing reapers, and pay McCormick $400,000. The trial, originally scheduled for Chicago in September 1855, featured prominent lawyers on both sides. McCormick hired the former U.S. Attorney General Reverdy Johnson and New York patent attorney Edward Nicholl Dickerson. Manny hired George Harding and Edwin Stanton. Because the trial was set to take place in Illinois, Harding hired the local Illinois lawyer Abraham Lincoln. Manny finally won the case on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
In 1856, McCormick&#x27;s factory was producing more than 4,000 reapers each year, mostly sold in the Midwest and West. In 1861, however, Hussey&#x27;s patent was extended but McCormick&#x27;s was not. McCormick&#x27;s outspoken opposition to Lincoln and the anti-slavery Republican party may not have helped his cause. McCormick decided to seek help from the U.S. Congress to protect his patent.

In 1871, the factory burned down in the Great Chicago Fire, but McCormick rebuilt and it reopened in 1873. In 1879, brother Leander changed the company&#x27;s name from &quot;Cyrus H. McCormick and Brothers&quot; to &quot;McCormick Harvesting Machine Company&quot;. To the annoyance of Cyrus, Leander tried to emphasize the contributions of others in the family to the reaper invention, especially their father.

==Family relationships==

On January 26, 1858, 49-year-old Cyrus McCormick married Nancy &quot;Nettie&quot; Fowler. She was an orphan from New York who had graduated from the Troy Female Seminary and moved to Chicago. They had met six months earlier and shared views about business, religion and Democratic party politics. They had seven children:
# Cyrus Hall McCormick Jr. was born May 16, 1859.
# Mary Virginia McCormick was born May 5, 1861.
# Robert McCormick III was born October 5, 1863, and died January 6, 1865.
# Anita McCormick was born July 4, 1866, married Emmons Blaine on September 26, 1889, and died February 12, 1954. Emmons was a son of the US. Secretary of State James G. Blaine.
# Alice McCormick was born March 15, 1870, and died less than a year later on January 25, 1871.
# Harold Fowler McCormick was born May 2, 1872, married Edith Rockefeller, and died in 1941. Edith was the youngest daughter of Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller and schoolteacher Laura Celestia &quot;Cettie&quot; Spelman.
# Stanley Robert McCormick was born November 2, 1874, married Katharine Dexter (1875–1967), and died January 19, 1947.

Mary and Stanley both had schizophrenia. Stanley McCormick&#x27;s life inspired the 1998 novel &quot;Riven Rock&quot; by T. Coraghessan Boyle.

Cyrus McCormick was an uncle of Robert Sanderson McCormick (son-in-law of Joseph Medill); granduncle of Joseph Medill McCormick and Robert Rutherford McCormick; and great-granduncle of William McCormick Blair Jr.

==Activism==
McCormick had always been a devout Presbyterian, as well as advocate of Christian unity. He also valued and demonstrated in his life the Calvinist traits of self-denial, sobriety, thriftiness, efficiency, and morality. He believed feeding the world, made easier by the reaper, was part of his religious mission in life.

A lifelong Democrat, before the American Civil War, McCormick had published editorials in his newspapers, &quot;The Chicago Times&quot; and &quot;Herald&quot;, calling for reconciliation between the national sections. His views, however, were unpopular in his adopted home town. Although his invention helped feed Union troops, McCormick believed the Confederacy would not be defeated and he and his wife traveled extensively in Europe during the war. McCormick unsuccessfully ran for Congress as a Democrat for Illinois&#x27;s 2nd congressional district with a peace-now platform in 1864, and was soundly defeated by Republican John Wentworth. He also proposed a peace plan to include a Board of Arbitration. After the war, McCormick helped found the Mississippi Valley Society, with a mission to promote New Orleans and Mississippi ports for European trade. He also supported efforts to annex the Dominican Republic as a territory of the United States. Beginning in 1872, McCormick served a four-year term on the Illinois Democratic Party&#x27;s Central Committee. McCormick later proposed an international mechanism to control food production and distribution.

McCormick also became the principal benefactor and a trustee of what had been the Theological Seminary of the Northwest, which moved to Chicago&#x27;s Lincoln Park neighborhood in 1859, a year in which he endowed four professorships. The institution was renamed McCormick Theological Seminary in 1886, after his death, although it moved to Chicago&#x27;s Hyde Park neighborhood in 1975 and began sharing facilities with the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago.

In 1869, McCormick donated $10,000 to help Dwight L. Moody start YMCA, and his son Cyrus Jr. would become the first chairman of the Moody Bible Institute.

McCormick and later his widow, Nettie Day McCormick, also donated significant sums to Tusculum College, a Presbyterian institution in Tennessee, as well as to establish churches and Sunday Schools in the South after the war, even though that region was slow to adopt his farm machinery and improved practices. Also, in 1872, McCormick purchased a religious newspaper, the &quot;Interior&quot;, which he renamed the &quot;Continent&quot; and became a leading Presbyterian periodical.

For the last 20 years of his life, McCormick was a benefactor and member of the board of trustees at Washington and Lee University in his native Virginia. His brother Leander also donated funds to build an observatory on Mount Jefferson, operated by the University of Virginia and named the McCormick Observatory.

==Later life and death==
During the last four years of his life, McCormick became an invalid, after a stroke paralyzed his legs; he was unable to walk during his final two years. He died at home in Chicago on May 13, 1884. He was buried in Graceland Cemetery. He was survived by his widow, Nettie, who continued his Christian and charitable activities, within the United States and abroad, between 1890 and her death in 1923, donating $8 million (over $160 million in modern equivalents) to hospitals, disaster and relief agencies, churches, youth activities and educational institutions, and becoming the leading benefactress of Presbyterian Church activities in that era.

Official leadership of the company passed to his eldest son Cyrus Hall McCormick Jr., but his grandson Cyrus McCormick III ran the company. Four years later, the company&#x27;s labor practices (paying workers $9 per week) led to the Haymarket riots. Ultimately Cyrus Jr. teamed with J.P. Morgan to create the International Harvester Corporation in 1902. After Cyrus Hall McCormick Jr., Harold Fowler McCormick ran International Harvester. Various members of the McCormick family continued involvement with the corporation until Brooks McCormick, who died in 2006.

==Legacy and honors==

Numerous prizes and medals were awarded McCormick for his reaper, which reduced human labor on farms while increasing productivity. Thus, it contributed to the industrialization of agriculture as well as migration of labor to cities in numerous wheat-growing countries (36 by McCormick&#x27;s death). The French government named McCormick an Officier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1851, and he was elected a corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1878 &quot;as having done more for the cause of agriculture than any other living man.&quot;

The Wisconsin Historical Society holds Cyrus McCormick&#x27;s papers.

* The Cyrus McCormick Farm, operated by other family members after Cyrus and Leander moved to Chicago, was ultimately donated to Virginia Tech, which operates the core of the property as a free museum, and other sections as an experimental farm. A marker memorializing Cyrus McCormick&#x27;s contribution to agriculture had been erected near the main house in 1928.
* In 1999, the City of Chicago placed a historical marker in honor of McCormick near the site of his home at 675 N. Rush St., between Erie and Huron. His original home at the site was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871; the replacement home was torn down in the 1950s.
* A statue of McCormick was erected on the front campus of Washington and Lee University, at Lexington, Virginia, by Serbian-American artist John David Brcin.
* The town of McCormick, South Carolina and McCormick County in the state were named for him after he bought a gold mine in the town, formerly known as Dornsville.
* 1975, McCormick was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame.
* 3 cent U.S. postage stamps were issued in 1940 to commemorate Cyrus Hall McCormick. See Famous Americans Series of 1940.

<text>In Greek mythology, Sisyphus or Sisyphos (; Ancient Greek: Σίσυφος &quot;Sísyphos&quot;) was the founder and king of Ephyra (now known as Corinth). He reveals Zeus&#x27;s abduction of Aegina to the river god Asopus, thereby incurring Zeus&#x27;s wrath. His subsequent cheating of death earns him eternal punishment in the underworld, once he dies of old age. The gods forced him to roll an immense boulder up a hill only for it to roll back down every time it neared the top, repeating this action for eternity. Through the classical influence on contemporary culture, tasks that are both and are therefore described as Sisyphean ().

== Etymology ==
R. S. P. Beekes has suggested a pre-Greek origin and a connection with the root of the word &#x27; (σοφός, &quot;wise&quot;). German mythographer Otto Gruppe thought that the name derived from &#x27; (σίσυς, &quot;a goat&#x27;s skin&quot;), in reference to a rain-charm in which goats&#x27; skins were used.

== Family ==
Sisyphus was formerly a Thessalian prince as the son of King Aeolus of Aeolia and Enarete, daughter of Deimachus. He was the brother of Athamas, Salmoneus, Cretheus, Perieres, Deioneus, Magnes, Calyce, Canace, Alcyone, Pisidice and Perimede.

Sisyphus married the Pleiad Merope by whom he became the father of Ornytion (Porphyrion), Glaucus, Thersander and Almus. He was the grandfather of Bellerophon through Glaucus; and of Minyas, founder of Orchomenus, through Almus. Another account related that Minyas was Sisyphus&#x27;s son instead.

In other versions of the myth, Sisyphus was the true father of Odysseus by Anticleia instead of Laërtes.

== Mythology ==
=== Reign ===
Sisyphus was the founder and first king of Ephyra (supposedly the original name of Corinth). According to Pausanias, Sisyphus, as king, founded the Isthmian games in honour of Melicertes, whose dead body was found washed up along the Isthmus of Corinth, having been carried to shore by a dolphin. In a fragment of Pindar, he instead founds the games (in honour of Melicertes) upon the instructions of a group of nymphs.

=== Conflict with Salmoneus ===
Sisyphus and his brother Salmoneus were known to hate each other, and Sisyphus consulted the Oracle of Delphi on just how to kill Salmoneus without incurring any severe consequences for himself. From Homer onward, Sisyphus was famed as the craftiest of men. He seduced Salmoneus&#x27;s daughter Tyro in one of his plots to kill Salmoneus, only for Tyro to slay their children when she discovered that Sisyphus was planning on using them to eventually dethrone her father.

=== Cheating death ===
Sisyphus betrayed one of Zeus&#x27;s secrets by revealing the whereabouts of the Asopid Aegina to her father, the river god Asopus, in return for causing a spring to flow on the Corinthian acropolis.

Zeus ordered Thanatos to chain Sisyphus in Tartarus. Sisyphus was curious as to why Charon, whose job it was to guide souls to the underworld, had not appeared on this occasion. Sisyphus slyly asked Thanatos to demonstrate how the chains worked. As Thanatos was granting him his wish, Sisyphus seized the opportunity and trapped Thanatos in the chains instead. Once Thanatos was bound by the strong chains, no one died on Earth, causing an uproar. Ares, the god of war, became annoyed that his battles had lost their fun because his opponents would not die. The exasperated Ares intervened, freeing Thanatos, enabling deaths to happen again and turned Sisyphus over to him.

In some versions, Hades was sent to chain Sisyphus and was chained himself. As long as Hades was trapped, nobody could die. Consequently, sacrifices could not be made to the gods, and those that were old and sick were suffering. The gods finally threatened to make life so miserable for Sisyphus that he would wish he were dead. He then had no choice but to release Hades.

Before Sisyphus died, he had told his wife to throw his naked corpse into the middle of the public square (purportedly as a test of his wife&#x27;s love for him). This caused Sisyphus to end up on the shores of the river Styx when he was brought to the underworld. Complaining to Persephone that this was a sign of his wife&#x27;s disrespect for him, Sisyphus persuaded her to allow him to return to the upper world. Once back in Ephyra, the spirit of Sisyphus scolded his wife for not burying his body and giving it a proper funeral as a loving wife should. When Sisyphus refused to return to the underworld, he was forcibly dragged back there by Hermes.

In another version of the myth, Persephone was tricked by Sisyphus that he had been conducted to Tartarus by mistake, and so she ordered that he be released.

In &quot;Philoctetes&quot; by Sophocles, there is a reference to the father of Odysseus (rumoured to have been Sisyphus, and not Laërtes, whom we know as the father in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;) upon having returned from the dead. Euripides, in &quot;Cyclops&quot;, also identified Sisyphus as Odysseus&#x27;s father.

=== Punishment in the underworld ===
As a punishment for his crimes, Hades made Sisyphus roll a huge boulder endlessly up a steep hill in Tartarus. The maddening nature of the punishment was reserved for Sisyphus due to his hubristic belief that his cleverness surpassed that of Zeus himself. Hades accordingly displayed his own cleverness by enchanting the boulder into rolling away from Sisyphus before he reached the top which ended up consigning Sisyphus to an eternity of useless efforts and unending frustration. Thus, pointless or interminable activities are sometimes described as &quot;Sisyphean&quot;. Sisyphus was a common subject for ancient writers and was depicted by the painter Polygnotus on the walls of the Lesche at Delphi.

==Interpretations==

According to the solar theory, King Sisyphus is the disk of the sun that rises every day in the east and then sinks into the west. Other scholars regard him as a personification of waves rising and falling, or of the treacherous sea. The 1st-century BC Epicurean philosopher Lucretius interprets the myth of Sisyphus as personifying politicians aspiring for political office who are constantly defeated, with the quest for power, in itself an &quot;empty thing&quot;, being likened to rolling the boulder up the hill. Friedrich Welcker suggested that he symbolises the vain struggle of man in the pursuit of knowledge, and Salomon Reinach that his punishment is based on a picture in which Sisyphus was represented rolling a huge stone Acrocorinthus, symbolic of the labour and skill involved in the building of the Sisypheum. Albert Camus, in his 1942 essay &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;, saw Sisyphus as personifying the absurdity of human life, but Camus concludes &quot;one must imagine Sisyphus happy&quot; as &quot;The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man&#x27;s heart.&quot; More recently, J. Nigro Sansonese, building on the work of Georges Dumézil, speculates that the origin of the name &quot;Sisyphus&quot; is onomatopoetic of the continual back-and-forth, susurrant sound (&quot;siss phuss&quot;) made by the breath in the nasal passages, situating the mythology of Sisyphus in a far larger context of archaic (see Proto-Indo-European religion) trance-inducing techniques related to breath control. The repetitive inhalation–exhalation cycle is described esoterically in the myth as an up–down motion of Sisyphus and his boulder on a hill.

In experiments that test how workers respond when the meaning of their task is diminished, the test condition is referred to as the Sisyphusian condition. The two main conclusions of the experiment are that people work harder when their work seems more meaningful, and that people underestimate the relationship between meaning and motivation.

===Literary interpretations===

* Homer describes Sisyphus in both Book VI of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and Book XI of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.
* Ovid, the Roman poet, makes reference to Sisyphus in the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. When Orpheus descends and confronts Hades and Persephone, he sings a song so that they will grant his wish to bring Eurydice back from the dead. After this song is sung, Ovid shows how moving it was by noting that Sisyphus, emotionally affected for just a moment, stops his eternal task and sits on his rock, the Latin wording being &quot;inque tuo sedisti, Sisyphe, saxo&quot; (&quot;and you sat, Sisyphus, on your rock&quot;).
* In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Apology&quot;, Socrates looks forward to the after-life where he can meet figures such as Sisyphus, who think themselves wise, so that he can question them and find who is wise and who &quot;thinks he is when he is not.&quot;
* Albert Camus, the French absurdist, wrote an essay entitled &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;, in which he elevates Sisyphus to the status of absurd hero.
* Franz Kafka repeatedly referred to Sisyphus as a bachelor; Kafkaesque for him were those qualities that brought out the Sisyphus-like qualities in himself. According to Frederick Karl: &quot;The man who struggled to reach the heights only to be thrown down to the depths embodied all of Kafka&#x27;s aspirations; and he remained himself, alone, solitary.&quot;
* The philosopher Richard Taylor uses the myth of Sisyphus as a representation of a life made meaningless because it consists of bare repetition.
* Wolfgang Mieder has collected cartoons that build on the image of Sisyphus, many of them editorial cartoons.

<doc id="75870" wikidata="Q199499" url="?curid=75870" title="Moesia">
<text>Moesia (; Latin: &quot;Moesia&quot;; ) was an ancient region and later Roman province situated in the Balkans south of the Danube River. As a Roman domain Moesia was administered at first by the governor of Noricum as &#x27;Civitates of Moesia and Triballia&#x27;. It included most of the territory of modern eastern Serbia, Kosovo, north-eastern Albania, northern parts of North Macedonia (Moesia Superior), Northern Bulgaria, Romanian Dobruja and small parts of Southern Ukraine (Moesia Inferior).

==Geography==
In ancient geographical sources, Moesia was bounded to the south by the Haemus (Balkan Mountains) and Scardus (Šar) mountains, to the west by the Drinus (Drina) river, on the north by the Donaris (Danube) and on the east by the Euxine (Black Sea).

==History==
The region of Moesia was inhabited chiefly by Thracian, Illyrian, and Thraco-Illyrian peoples. The name of the region comes from Moesi, the Latin name of a Thracian tribe who lived there before the Roman conquest.

Parts of Moesia belonged to the polity of Burebista, a Getae (Dacian) king who established his rule over a large part of the northern Balkans between 82 BC and 44 BC. He led raids for plunder and conquest across Central and Southeastern Europe, subjugating most of the neighbouring tribes. After his assassination in a palace intrigue, the empire was divided into several smaller states.

In 74 BC, C. Scribonius Curio, proconsul of Macedonia, took an army as far as the Danube and chased the Geto-Dacians to the border of their remote country.

The expansion of the Dacians on the middle and lower reaches of the Danube worried the Romans and destruction of Dacian power became one of Julius Caesar&#x27;s key political objectives, who made plans to launch an offensive from Macedonia in about 44 BC.

Once Augustus had established himself as sole ruler of the Roman state in 30 BC after the battle of Actium, he took up Caesar&#x27;s project and aimed to advance the empire&#x27;s south-eastern European border from Macedonia to the line of the Danube. The main objective was to increase strategic depth between the border and Italy and also to provide a major river supply route between the Roman armies in the region. The lower Danube was given priority over the upper Danube and required the annexation of Moesia. It was therefore necessary to conquer the tribes who dwelt south of the Danube namely (from west to east) the Triballi, Moesi, Getae and the Bastarnae who had recently subjugated the Triballi, and with their capital at Oescus. Augustus also wanted to avenge the defeat of Gaius Antonius Hybrida at Histria 32 years before and to recover the lost military standards held in the powerful fortress of Genucla.

Marcus Licinius Crassus, grandson of Crassus the triumvir was appointed for the task. He was an experienced general at 33 years of age, and proconsul of Macedonia from 29 BC. After a successful campaign against the Moesi, he drove the Bastarnae back toward the Danube and finally defeated them in pitched battle, killing their King Deldo in single combat. Augustus formally proclaimed this victory in 27 BC in Rome but blocked Cassius&#x27; entitlement to the Spolia opima and use of the term &quot;imperator&quot; apparently in favour of his own prestige.

Moesia was split off as a separate military command some time before 10 BC.

As a result of the Dacians constant looting that occurred whenever the Danube froze, Augustus decided to send against them some of his proven generals such as Sextus Aelius Catus and Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Augur (sometime between 1-11 AD). Lentulus pushed them back across the Danube and placed numerous garrisons on the right bank of the river to defend against possible and future incursions. These became the Moesian Limes frontier defensive system that was developed further later.

===Roman Province===

The region, however, was not organised as a province until the last years of Augustus&#x27; reign; in 6 AD, mention is made of its governor, Caecina Severus. As a province, Moesia was under an imperial consular legate (who probably also had control of Achaea and Macedonia). In 15 AD complaints about the corruption of the governors of Macedonia and Achaia led Tiberius to put these provinces under the control of the governor of Moesia.

In 86 AD the Dacian king Duras attacked Moesia after which the Roman emperor Domitian personally arrived in Moesia and reorganised it in 87 into two provinces, divided by the river Cebrus (Ciabrus): to the west &quot;Moesia Superior&quot; (meaning upriver) and to the east &quot;Moesia Inferior&quot; or &quot;Ripa Thracia&quot; (from the Danube river&#x27;s mouth and then upstream). Each was governed by an imperial consular legate and a procurator.

From Moesia Domitian began planning future campaigns into Dacia and Domitian&#x27;s Dacian War started by ordering General Cornelius Fuscus to attack who, in the summer of 87, led five or six legions across the Danube. The war ended without a decisive outcome and Decebalus, the Dacian King, later brazenly flouted the terms of the peace (89 AD) which had been agreed on.

===Dacian Wars===

Trajan&#x27;s Dacian Wars (101–102 AD, 105–106 AD) were two military campaigns fought between the Roman Empire and Dacia during Emperor Trajan&#x27;s rule. The conflicts were triggered by the constant Dacian threat on Moesia and also by the increasing need for resources of the economy of the Empire. 

Starting with AD 85, Dacia was unified under King Decebalus. Following an incursion into Moesia, which resulted in the death of its governor, Gaius Oppius Sabinus, a series of conflicts between the Romans and Dacians ensued. Although the Romans gained a major strategic victory at Tapae in AD 88, Emperor Domitian offered the Dacians favourable terms, in exchange for which Roman suzerainty was recognised. However, Emperor Trajan restarted the conflicts in 101-102 and then again in 105–106, which ended with the annexation of most of Dacia and its reorganisation as a Roman Province.

===Gothic raids===
The first incursion in Moesia that can be attributed to Goths is by the Costoboci in 170 in the Marcomannic Wars when they destroyed Tropaeum Traiani.

In 238 the Carpi sacked Histria and Tropaeum Traiani. Afterwards Moesia was frequently invaded or raided by the Dacian Carpi, and the East Germanic tribes of the Goths.

In the Gothic War (248–253), the Gothic king Cniva captured the city of Philippopolis and then inflicted a devastating defeat upon the Romans at the Battle of Abrittus, in which the Roman Emperor Decius was killed, one of the most disastrous defeats in the history of the Roman army.

===Retreat from Dacia===
After the abandonment of Roman Dacia to the Goths by Aurelian (270–275) and the transfer of the Roman citizens from the former province to the south of the Danube, the central portion of Moesia took the name of &quot;Dacia Aureliana&quot; (later divided into &quot;Dacia Ripensis&quot; and &quot;Dacia Mediterranea&quot;).

During administrative reforms of Emperor Diocletian (284–305), both of the Moesian provinces were reorganised. Moesia Superior was divided in two, northern part forming the province of Moesia Prima including cities Viminacium and Singidunum, while the southern part was organised as the new province of Dardania with cities Scupi and Ulpiana. At the same time, Moesia Inferior was divided into Moesia Secunda and Scythia Minor.

As a frontier province, Moesia was strengthened by stations and forts erected along the southern bank of the Danube, and a wall was built from Axiopolis to Tomis as a protection against the Scythians and Sarmatians. The garrison of Moesia Secunda included Legio I Italica and Legio XI Claudia, as well as auxiliary infantry units, cavalry units, and river flotillas.

Hard-pressed by the Huns, the Goths again crossed the Danube during the reign of Valens (376) and with his permission settled in Moesia. After they settled, quarrels soon took place, and the Goths under Fritigern defeated Valens in a great battle near Adrianople. These Goths are known as Moeso-Goths, for whom Ulfilas made the Gothic translation of the Bible.

===Late Empire===

The Slavs allied with the Avars invaded and destroyed much of Moesia in 583–587 in the Avar–Byzantine wars. Moesia was settled by Slavs during the 7th century. Bulgars, arriving from Old Great Bulgaria, conquered Lower Moesia by the end of the 7th century. During the 8th century the Byzantine Empire lost also Upper Moesian territory to the First Bulgarian Empire.. The region would return to Byzantine control under Basil II in 1018 and would last until the formation of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1185.

<text>In electrochemistry, the Nernst equation is a chemical thermodynamical relationship that permits the calculation of the reduction potential of a reaction (half-cell or full cell reaction) from the standard electrode potential, absolute temperature, the number of electrons involved in the redox reaction, and activities (often approximated by concentrations) of the chemical species undergoing reduction and oxidation respectively. It was named after Walther Nernst, a German physical chemist who formulated the equation.

==Expression==
===General form with chemical activities===

When an oxidizer () accepts a number &quot;z&quot; of electrons () to be converted in its reduced form (), the half-reaction is expressed as: 

: &lt;chem&gt;Ox + ze- -&gt; Red&lt;/chem&gt;

The reaction quotient (&quot;&quot;), also often called the ion activity product (&quot;IAP&quot;), is the ratio between the chemical activities (&quot;a&quot;) of the reduced form (the reductant, ) and the oxidized form (the oxidant, ). The chemical activity of a dissolved species corresponds to its true thermodynamic concentration taking into account the electrical interactions between all ions present in solution at elevated concentrations. For a given dissolved species, its chemical activity (a) is the product of its activity coefficient (γ) by its molar (mol/L solution), or molal (mol/kg water), concentration (C): a = γ C. So, if the concentration (&quot;C&quot;, also denoted here below with square brackets [ ]) of all the dissolved species of interest are sufficiently low and that their activity coefficients are close to unity, their chemical activities can be approximated by their concentrations as commonly done when simplifying, or idealizing, a reaction for didactic purposes: 

: formula_1

At chemical equilibrium, the ratio &#x27; of the activity of the reaction product (&quot;a&quot;Red) by the reagent activity (&quot;a&quot;Ox) is equal to the equilibrium constant &#x27; of the half-reaction: 

: formula_2

The standard thermodynamics also says that the actual Gibbs free energy is related to the free energy change under standard state by the relationship:
formula_3
where is the reaction quotient and R is the universal ideal gas constant.
The cell potential associated with the electrochemical reaction is defined as the decrease in Gibbs free energy per coulomb of charge transferred, which leads to the relationship formula_4 The constant (the Faraday constant) is a unit conversion factor , where is the Avogadro constant and is the fundamental electron charge. This immediately leads to the Nernst equation, which for an electrochemical half-cell is
formula_5
For a complete electrochemical reaction (full cell), the equation can be written as
formula_6

where:
* is the half-cell reduction potential at the temperature of interest,
* is the &quot;standard&quot; half-cell reduction potential,
* is the cell potential (electromotive force) at the temperature of interest,
* is the standard cell potential in volts,
* is the universal ideal gas constant: ,
* is the temperature in kelvins,
* is the number of electrons transferred in the cell reaction or half-reaction,
* is Faraday&#x27;s constant, the magnitude of charge (in coulombs) per mole of electrons: ,
* is the reaction quotient of the cell reaction, and,
* is the chemical activity for the relevant species, where is the activity of the reduced form and is the activity of the oxidized form.

===Thermal voltage===

At room temperature (25 °C), the thermal voltage formula_7 is approximately 25.693 mV. The Nernst equation is frequently expressed in terms of base-10 logarithms (&quot;i.e.&quot;, common logarithms) rather than natural logarithms, in which case it is written:

formula_8

where &quot;λ&quot; = ln(10) ≈ 2.3026 and &quot;λVT&quot; ≈ 0.05916 Volt.

===Form with activity coefficients and concentrations===

Similarly to equilibrium constants, activities are always measured with respect to the standard state (1 mol/L for solutes, 1 atm for gases, and T = 298.15 K, &quot;i.e.&quot;, 25 °C or 77 °F). The chemical activity of a species , , is related to the measured concentration via the relationship , where is the activity coefficient of the species . Because activity coefficients tend to unity at low concentrations, or are unknown or difficult to determine at medium and high concentrations, activities in the Nernst equation are frequently replaced by simple concentrations and then, formal standard reduction potentials formula_9 used. 

Taking into account the activity coefficients (formula_10) the Nernst equation becomes: 

formula_11

formula_12

formula_13

Where the first term including the activity coefficients (formula_10) is denoted formula_15 and called the formal standard reduction potential, so that formula_16 can be directly expressed as a function of formula_15 and the concentrations in the simplest form of the Nernst equation:
formula_18

===Formal standard reduction potential===
When wishing to use simple concentrations in place of activities, but that the activity coefficients are far from unity and can no longer be neglected and are unknown or too difficult to determine, it can be convenient to introduce the notion of the &quot;so-called&quot; standard formal reduction potential (formula_15) which is related to the standard reduction potential as follows:
formula_20
So that the Nernst equation for the half-cell reaction can be correctly formally written in terms of concentrations as:
formula_18
and likewise for the full cell expression.

According to Wenzel (2020), a formal reduction potential formula_15 is the reduction potential that applies to a half reaction under a set of specified conditions such as, e.g., pH, ionic strength, or the concentration of complexing agents.

The formal reduction potential formula_15 is often a more convenient, but conditional, form of the standard reduction potential, taking into account activity coefficients and specific conditions characteristics of the reaction medium. Therefore, its value is a conditional value, &quot;i.e.&quot;, that it depends on the experimental conditions and because the ionic strength affects the activity coefficients, formula_15 will vary from medium to medium. Several definitions of the formal reduction potential can be found in the literature, depending on the pursued objective and the experimental constraints imposed by the studied system. The general definition of formula_15 refers to its value determined when formula_26. A more particular case is when formula_15 is also determined at pH 7, as e.g. for redox reactions important in biochemistry or biological systems. 

====Determination of the formal standard reduction potential when 1====

The formal standard reduction potential formula_15 can be defined as the measured reduction potential formula_16 of the half-reaction at unity concentration ratio of the oxidized and reduced species (&quot;i.e.&quot;, when 1) under given conditions. 

Indeed: 

as, formula_30, when formula_31, 

: formula_32, when formula_26, 

because formula_34, and that the term formula_35 is included in formula_15. 

The formal reduction potential makes possible to more simply work with molar (mol/L, M) or molal (mol/kg , m) concentrations in place of activities. Because molar and molal concentrations were once referred as formal concentrations, it could explain the origin of the adjective &quot;formal&quot; in the expression &quot;formal&quot; potential. 

The formal potential is thus the reversible potential of an electrode at equilibrium immersed in a solution where reactants and products are at unit concentration. If any small incremental change of potential causes a change in the direction of the reaction, &quot;i.e.&quot; from reduction to oxidation or &quot;vice versa&quot;, the system is close to equilibrium, reversible and is at its formal potential. When the formal potential is measured under standard conditions (&quot;i.e.&quot; the activity of each dissolved species is 1 mol/L, T = 298.15 K = 25 °C = 77 °F, = 1 bar) it becomes &quot;de facto&quot; a standard potential. According to Brown and Swift (1949): 

&quot;A formal potential is defined as the potential of a half-cell, measured against the standard hydrogen electrode, when the total concentration of each oxidation state is one formal&quot;.

In this case, as for the standard reduction potentials, the concentrations of dissolved species remain equal to one molar (M) or one molal (m), and so are said to be one formal (F). So, expressing the concentration in molarity (1 mol/L): 

: formula_37

The term formal concentration (F) is now largely ignored in the current literature and can be commonly assimilated to molar concentration (M), or molality (m) in case of thermodynamic calculations. 

The formal potential is also found halfway between the two peaks in a cyclic voltammogram, where at this point the concentration of Ox (the oxidized species) and Red (the reduced species) at the electrode surface are equal. 

The activity coefficients formula_38 and formula_39 are included in the formal potential formula_15, and because they depend on experimental conditions such as temperature, ionic strength, and pH, formula_15 cannot be referred as an immutable standard potential but needs to be systematically determined for each specific set of experimental conditions.

Formal reduction potentials are applied to simplify calculations of a considered system under given conditions and measurements interpretation. The experimental conditions in which they are determined and their relationship to the standard reduction potentials must be clearly described to avoid to confuse them with standard reduction potentials.

====Formal standard reduction potential at pH 7====

Formal standard reduction potentials (formula_15) are also commonly used in biochemistry and cell biology for referring to standard reduction potentials measured at pH 7, a value closer to the pH of most physiological and intracellular fluids than the standard state pH of 0. The advantage is to defining a more appropriate redox scale better corresponding to real conditions than the standard state. Formal standard reduction potentials (formula_15) allow to more easily estimate if a redox reaction supposed to occur in a metabolic process or to fuel microbial activity under some conditions is feasible or not. 

While, standard reduction potentials always refer to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), with [] = 1 M corresponding to a pH 0, and formula_44 fixed arbitrarily to zero by convention, it is no longer the case at a pH of 7. Then, the reduction potential formula_16 of a hydrogen electrode operating at pH 7 is -0.413 V with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).

===Expression of the Nernst equation as a function of pH===
The formula_46 and pH of a solution are related by the Nernst equation as commonly represented by a Pourbaix diagram . formula_46 explicitly denotes formula_16 expressed versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). For a half cell equation, conventionally written as a reduction reaction (&quot;i.e.&quot;, electrons accepted by an oxidant on the left side):

: formula_49

The half-cell standard reduction potential formula_50 is given by

: formula_51

where formula_52 is the standard Gibbs free energy change, is the number of electrons involved, and is the Faraday&#x27;s constant. The Nernst equation relates pH and formula_46 as follows:

: formula_54  

where curly brackets indicate activities, and exponents are shown in the conventional manner. This equation is the equation of a straight line for formula_16 as a function of pH with a slope of formula_56 volt (pH has no units). 

This equation predicts lower formula_16 at higher pH values. This is observed for the reduction of O2 into H2O, or OH−, and for the reduction of H+ into H2. formula_16 is then often noted as formula_46 to indicate that it refers to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) whose formula_16 = 0 by convention under standard conditions (T = 298.15 K = 25 °C = 77 F, Pgas = 1 atm (1.013 bar), concentrations = 1 M and thus pH = 0). 

====Main factors affecting the formal standard reduction potentials====

The main factor affecting the formal reduction potentials in biochemical or biological processes is most often the pH. To determine approximate values of formal reduction potentials, neglecting in a first approach changes in activity coefficients due to ionic strength, the Nernst equation has to be applied taking care to first express the relationship as a function of pH. The second factor to be considered are the values of the concentrations taken into account in the Nernst equation. To define a formal reduction potential for a biochemical reaction, the pH value, the concentrations values and the hypotheses made on the activity coefficients must always be explicitly indicated. When using, or comparing, several formal reduction potentials they must also be internally consistent. 

Problems may occur when mixing different sources of data using different conventions or approximations (&quot;i.e.&quot;, with different underlying hypotheses). When working at the frontier between inorganic and biological processes (e.g., when comparing abiotic and biotic processes in geochemistry when microbial activity could also be at work in the system), care must be taken not to inadvertently directly mix standard reduction potentials versus SHE (pH = 0) with formal reduction potentials (pH = 7). Definitions must be clearly expressed and carefully controlled, especially if the sources of data are different and arise from different fields (e.g., picking and mixing data from classical electrochemistry and microbiology textbooks without paying attention to the different conventions on which they are based).

====Examples with a Pourbaix diagram====


To illustrate the dependency of the reduction potential on pH, one can simply consider the two oxido-reduction equilibria determining the water stability domain in a Pourbaix diagram . When water is submitted to electrolysis by applying a sufficient difference of electrical potential between two electrodes immersed in water, hydrogen is produced at the cathode (reduction of water protons) while oxygen is formed at the anode (oxidation of water oxygen atoms). The same may occur if a reductant stronger than hydrogen (e.g., metallic Na) or an oxidant stronger than oxygen (e.g., F2) enters in contact with water and reacts with it. In the here beside (the simplest possible version of a Pourbaix diagram), the water stability domain (grey surface) is delimited in term of redox potential by two inclined red dashed lines: 

* Lower stability line with hydrogen gas evolution due to the proton reduction at very low Eh: 
: (cathode: reduction)

* Higher stability line with oxygen gas evolution due to water oxygen oxidation at very high Eh: 
: (anode: oxidation)

When solving the Nernst equation for each corresponding reduction reaction (need to revert the water oxidation reaction producing oxygen), both equations have a similar form because the number of protons and the number of electrons involved within a reaction are the same and their ratio is one (2/2 for H2 and 4/4 with respectively), so it simplifies when solving the Nernst equation expressed as a function of pH. 

The result can be numerically expressed as follows: 

: formula_61

Note that the slopes of the two water stability domain upper and lower lines are the same (-59.16 mV/pH unit), so they are parallel on a Pourbaix diagram. As the slopes are negative, at high pH, both hydrogen and oxygen evolution requires a much lower reduction potential than at low pH.

For the reduction of H+ into H2 the here above mentioned relationship becomes: 

: formula_62 because by convention formula_50 = 0 V for the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE: pH = 0). So, at pH = 7, formula_16 = -0.414 V for the reduction of protons. 

For the reduction of O2 into 2 H2O the here above mentioned relationship becomes: 

: formula_65 because formula_50 = +1.229 V with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE: pH = 0). So, at pH = 7, formula_16 = +0.815 V for the reduction of oxygen.

The offset of -414 mV in formula_16 is the same for both reduction reactions because they share the same linear relationship as a function of pH and the slopes of their lines are the same. This can be directly verified on a Pourbaix diagram. For other reduction reactions, the value of the formal reduction potential at a pH of 7, commonly referred for biochemical reactions, also depends on the slope of the corresponding line in a Pourbaix diagram &quot;i.e.&quot; on the ratio &#x27; of the number of to the number of involved in the reduction reaction, and thus on the stoichiometry of the half-reaction. The determination of the formal reduction potential at pH = 7 for a given biochemical half-reaction requires thus to calculate it with the corresponding Nernst equation as a function of pH. One cannot simply apply an offset of -414 mV to the Eh value (SHE) when the ratio &#x27; differs from 1.

==Applications in biology==

Beside important redox reactions in biochemistry and microbiology, the Nernst equation is also used in physiology for calculating the electric potential of a cell membrane with respect to one type of ion. It can be linked to the acid dissociation constant.

===Nernst potential===

The Nernst equation has a physiological application when used to calculate the potential of an ion of charge across a membrane. This potential is determined using the concentration of the ion both inside and outside the cell:

formula_69

When the membrane is in thermodynamic equilibrium (i.e., no net flux of ions), and if the cell is permeable to only one ion, then the membrane potential must be equal to the Nernst potential for that ion.

===Goldman equation===

When the membrane is permeable to more than one ion, as is inevitably the case, the resting potential can be determined from the Goldman equation, which is a solution of G-H-K influx equation under the constraints that total current density driven by electrochemical force is zero:

formula_70

where

* is the membrane potential (in volts, equivalent to joules per coulomb),
* is the permeability for that ion (in meters per second),
* is the extracellular concentration of that ion (in moles per cubic meter, to match the other SI units, though the units strictly don&#x27;t matter, as the ion concentration terms become a dimensionless ratio),
* is the intracellular concentration of that ion (in moles per cubic meter),
* is the ideal gas constant (joules per kelvin per mole),
* is the temperature in kelvins,
* is the Faraday&#x27;s constant (coulombs per mole).

The potential across the cell membrane that exactly opposes net diffusion of a particular ion through the membrane is called the Nernst potential for that ion. As seen above, the magnitude of the Nernst potential is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of that specific ion on the two sides of the membrane. The greater this ratio the greater the tendency for the ion to diffuse in one direction, and therefore the greater the Nernst potential required to prevent the diffusion. A similar expression exists that includes (the absolute value of the transport ratio). This takes transporters with unequal exchanges into account. See: sodium-potassium pump where the transport ratio would be 2/3, so r equals 1.5 in the formula below. The reason why we insert a factor r = 1.5 here is that current density &quot;by electrochemical force&quot; Je.c.(Na+) + Je.c.(K+) is no longer zero, but rather Je.c.(Na+) + 1.5Je.c.(K+) = 0 (as for both ions flux by electrochemical force is compensated by that by the pump, i.e. Je.c. = −Jpump), altering the constraints for applying GHK equation. The other variables are the same as above. The following example includes two ions: potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+). Chloride is assumed to be in equilibrium.
formula_71

When chloride (Cl−) is taken into account, 

formula_72

==Derivation==

===Using Boltzmann factor===
For simplicity, we will consider a solution of redox-active molecules that undergo a one-electron reversible reaction

and that have a standard potential of zero, and in which the activities are well represented by the concentrations (i.e. unit activity coefficient). The chemical potential of this solution is the difference between the energy barriers for taking electrons from and for giving electrons to the working electrode that is setting the solution&#x27;s electrochemical potential. The ratio of oxidized to reduced molecules, , is equivalent to the probability of being oxidized (giving electrons) over the probability of being reduced (taking electrons), which we can write in terms of the Boltzmann factor for these processes:
formula_73

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives
formula_74

If at  = 1, we need to add in this additional constant:
formula_75

Dividing the equation by to convert from chemical potentials to electrode potentials, and remembering that , we obtain the Nernst equation for the one-electron process :

formula_76

===Using thermodynamics (chemical potential)===
Quantities here are given per molecule, not per mole, and so Boltzmann constant and the electron charge are used instead of the gas constant and Faraday&#x27;s constant . To convert to the molar quantities given in most chemistry textbooks, it is simply necessary to multiply by the Avogadro constant: and . The entropy of a molecule is defined as

formula_77

where is the number of states available to the molecule. The number of states must vary linearly with the volume of the system (here an idealized system is considered for better understanding, so that activities are posited very close to the true concentrations). Fundamental statistical proof of the mentioned linearity goes beyond the scope of this section, but to see this is true it is simpler to consider usual isothermal process for an ideal gas where the change of entropy takes place. It follows from the definition of entropy and from the condition of constant temperature and quantity of gas that the change in the number of states must be proportional to the relative change in volume . In this sense there is no difference in statistical properties of ideal gas atoms compared with the dissolved species of a solution with activity coefficients equaling one: particles freely &quot;hang around&quot; filling the provided volume), which is inversely proportional to the concentration , so we can also write the entropy as
formula_78

The change in entropy from some state 1 to another state 2 is therefore
formula_79
so that the entropy of state 2 is
formula_80

If state 1 is at standard conditions, in which is unity (e.g., 1 atm or 1 M), it will merely cancel the units of . We can, therefore, write the entropy of an arbitrary molecule A as
formula_81
where formula_82 is the entropy at standard conditions and [A] denotes the concentration of A. The change in entropy for a reaction
is then given by
formula_83

We define the ratio in the last term as the reaction quotient:
formula_84
where the numerator is a product of reaction product activities, , each raised to the power of a stoichiometric coefficient, , and the denominator is a similar product of reactant activities. All activities refer to a time . Under certain circumstances (see chemical equilibrium) each activity term such as may be replaced by a concentration term, [A].In an electrochemical cell, the cell potential is the chemical potential available from redox reactions (). is related to the Gibbs free energy change only by a constant: 
, where is the number of electrons transferred and is the Faraday constant. There is a negative sign because a spontaneous reaction has a negative Gibbs free energy and a positive potential . The Gibbs free energy is related to the entropy by , where is the enthalpy and is the temperature of the system. Using these relations, we can now write the change in Gibbs free energy,
formula_85
and the cell potential,
formula_86

This is the more general form of the Nernst equation. 

For the redox reaction , 
formula_87
and we have:
formula_88

The cell potential at standard temperature and pressure (STP) formula_89 is often replaced by the formal potential formula_90, which includes the activity coefficients of the dissolved species under given experimental conditions (T, P, ionic strength, pH, and complexing agents) and is the potential that is actually measured in an electrochemical cell.

==Relation to the chemical equilibrium==
The standard Gibbs free energy formula_52 is related to the equilibrium constant as follows: 

: formula_92

At the same time, formula_52 is also equal to the product of the total charge () transferred during the reaction and the cell potential (formula_94):

: formula_95

The sign is negative, because the considered system performs the work and thus releases energy. 

So, 

: formula_96

And therefore: 

: formula_97

Starting from the Nernst equation, one can also demonstrate the same relationship in the reverse way. 

At chemical equilibrium, or thermodynamic equilibrium, the electrochemical potential and therefore the reaction quotient () attains the special value known as the equilibrium constant (): 

Therefore,

formula_98

Or at standard state,

formula_99

We have thus related the standard electrode potential and the equilibrium constant of a redox reaction.

==Limitations==
In dilute solutions, the Nernst equation can be expressed directly in the terms of concentrations (since activity coefficients are close to unity). But at higher concentrations, the true activities of the ions must be used. This complicates the use of the Nernst equation, since estimation of non-ideal activities of ions generally requires experimental measurements. The Nernst equation also only applies when there is no net current flow through the electrode. The activity of ions at the electrode surface changes when there is current flow, and there are additional overpotential and resistive loss terms which contribute to the measured potential. 

At very low concentrations of the potential-determining ions, the potential predicted by Nernst equation approaches toward . This is physically meaningless because, under such conditions, the exchange current density becomes very low, and there may be no thermodynamic equilibrium necessary for Nernst equation to hold. The electrode is called unpoised in such case. Other effects tend to take control of the electrochemical behavior of the system, like the involvement of the solvated electron in electricity transfer and electrode equilibria, as analyzed by Alexander Frumkin and B. Damaskin, Sergio Trasatti, etc.

===Time dependence of the potential===
The expression of time dependence has been established by Karaoglanoff.

==Significance in other scientific fields==
The Nernst equation has been involved in the scientific controversy about cold fusion. Fleischmann and Pons, claiming that cold fusion could exist, calculated that a palladium cathode immersed in a heavy water electrolysis cell could achieve up to 1027 atmospheres of pressure inside the crystal lattice of the metal of the cathode, enough pressure to cause spontaneous nuclear fusion. In reality, only 10,000–20,000 atmospheres were achieved. The American physicist John R. Huizenga claimed their original calculation was affected by a misinterpretation of the Nernst equation. He cited a paper about Pd–Zr alloys.

The Nernst equation allows the calculation of the extent of reaction between two redox systems and can be used, for example, to assess whether a particular reaction will go to completion or not. At chemical equilibrium, the electromotive forces (emf) of the two half cells are equal. This allows the equilibrium constant of the reaction to be calculated and hence the extent of the reaction.

<doc id="75874" wikidata="Q136605" url="?curid=75874" title="Z (1969 film)">
<text>Z is a 1969 political thriller film directed by Costa-Gavras, from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jorge Semprún, adapted from the 1967 novel by Vassilis Vassilikos. The film presents a thinly fictionalized account of the events surrounding the assassination of democratic Greek politician Grigoris Lambrakis in 1963. With its dark view of Greek politics and its downbeat ending, the film captures the director&#x27;s outrage about the junta that then ruled Greece. The title refers to a popular Greek protest slogan (, ) meaning &quot;he lives,&quot; in reference to Lambrakis.

A French and Algerian co-production, the film stars Jean-Louis Trintignant as the investigating magistrate, an analogue of Christos Sartzetakis, who would become the President of Greece from 1985 to 1990. International stars Yves Montand and Irene Papas also appear, but despite their star billing, they have very little screen time. Jacques Perrin, who also produced the film, plays a key role as a photojournalist. Other actors in the film include Pierre Dux, Charles Denner, François Périer, Georges Géret and Bernard Fresson. The musical score was composed by Mikis Theodorakis.

&quot;Z&quot; was the first film and one of only a handful to be nominated by the Academy Awards for both Best Picture and Best Foreign Language Film. It won the latter as well as the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film. At the 27th Golden Globe Awards, its producers refused the award to protest the film&#x27;s exclusion from the Best Motion Picture – Drama category.

==Plot==
The film centers on the right-wing, military-dominated government of an unnamed Mediterranean state (based on Greece). The story begins with the closing moments of a rather dull government lecture on agricultural policy until the leader of the security police takes over the podium for an impassioned speech describing the government&#x27;s program to combat leftism by using the metaphors &quot;a mildew of the mind&quot;, an infiltration of &quot;isms&quot; and &quot;sunspots&quot;.

The scene shifts to preparations for a political rally of the opposition faction in which the left-leaning, pacifist deputy is to give a speech advocating nuclear disarmament. There have been attempts by the government to prevent the speech from being delivered. The venue has been changed to a much smaller hall, logistical problems have appeared out of nowhere and the people handing out leaflets about the change of venue are attacked by thugs under the command of the police. On his way to the venue, the deputy is hit on the head by one of the right-wing anticommunist protestors, some of whom are sponsored by the government, but carries on with his sharp speech. As the deputy crosses the street from the hall after giving his speech, a delivery truck speeds past him, and a man on the open truck bed strikes him down with a club. The injury eventually proves fatal, and the police manipulate witnesses to force the conclusion that the deputy was simply run over by a drunk driver.

However, the police do not control the hospital, where the autopsy disproves their interpretation. The examining magistrate, with the assistance of a photojournalist, now uncovers sufficient evidence to indict not only the two right-wing militants who committed the murder but also four high-ranking military police officers. The action of the film concludes with one of the deputy&#x27;s associates rushing to see his widow to give her the surprising news of the officers&#x27; indictments. The widow looks distressed and appears not to believe things will change for the better.

An epilogue provides a synopsis of the subsequent turns of events. Instead of justice being served, the prosecutor is mysteriously removed from the case, several key witnesses die under suspicious circumstances, the assassins receive relatively short sentences, the officers receive only administrative reprimands, the deputy&#x27;s close associates die or are deported and the photojournalist is sent to prison for disclosing official documents. The heads of the government resign after public disapproval, but before elections are carried out, a coup d&#x27;état occurs, and the military seize power. They ban modern art, popular music, avant-garde novelists, modern mathematics, classic and modern philosophers and the use of the term &quot;Ζ&quot; (, or , which is used by protesters against the former government), which refers to the deputy and means &quot;He lives.&quot;

==Cast==
==Background==
The 1963 murder of Greek politician and physician Grigoris Lambrakis and subsequent military junta in power from 1967–1973 served as the basis for the story. Among Costa-Gavras&#x27; references to the actual events was the frequency with which the military compared ideologies to diseases, seen when the General compares -isms to mildew. The Magistrate was based on real-life Greek jurist Christos Sartzetakis. Costa-Gavras opted to show the Deputy had adulteries and conflicts with his wife to demonstrate he was simply a man.

Costa-Gavras was also motivated by the suspicious disappearance of Mehdi Ben Barka in 1965. Some American viewers infer parallels between the film and the assassination of John F. Kennedy, particularly given how some stylistic elements seem to mimic the Zapruder film. That said, Costa-Gavras has stated that the Zapruder film had not been widely circulated in Europe at the time and that Kennedy&#x27;s assassination did not influence the production.

==Production==
Principal photography took place in Algiers at actor Jacques Perrin&#x27;s suggestion, which the filmmakers approved for its Mediterranean environment and because the Ministry of Culture was accommodating. In Algiers, the Hotel St. Georges and the central square were filming locations, while Paris&#x27; Théâtre des Champs-Élysées was used for the ballet scenes. Marcel Bozzuffi performed his own stunts wrestling on the &quot;Kamikaze&quot; vehicle due to the production&#x27;s lack of budget for professional stunt performers.

Costa-Gavras chose &quot;Z&quot; as the title of the film based on its common occurrence in Greek graffiti for &quot;He lives&quot; (or even &quot;Lambrakis you live; it’s you who guides us!&quot; [Λαμπράκη ζεις, εσύ μας οδηγείς!; &quot;Lambráki zis, esý mas odigís!&quot;]); Costa-Gavras acknowledged a one-letter film title was unconventional and said Yves Montand expressed concern it would be confused with &quot;Zorro&quot;, but Costa-Gavras said the novelty of the idea won him over.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack by Mikis Theodorakis was a hit record. The Greek junta had placed the composer under house arrest but he was able to give his approval to Costa-Gavras for the use of existing musical pieces.

The film features, but does not credit, Pierre Henry&#x27;s contemporary hit song &quot;Psyché Rock&quot;. The soundtrack as released on LP and CD replaces Henry&#x27;s song with a similar track written by Theodorakis titled &quot;Café Rock.&quot;

# Main Title (Antonis) from the &quot;Mauthausen Trilogy&quot; of Mikis Theodorakis
# The Smiling Youth 
# The Chase-The Smiling Youth
# Murmur of the Heart
# Cafe Rock
# Arrival of Helen-The Smiling Youth
# Batucada
# The Smiling Youth (Bouzouki Version)
# The Smiling Youth
# Who&#x27;s Not Talking About Easter
# Finale-The Smiling Youth
# Murmur of the Heart
# In This Town

&quot;The Smiling Youth&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Not Talking About Easter&quot; were among the poems adapted from Brendan Behan&#x27;s play &quot;The Hostage&quot; by Theodorakis in 1962. By referring to the Irish struggle against British rule rather than Greek realities, the poems offered a way to circumvent censorship in Greece and condemn Greece&#x27;s post-war right-wing establishment. &quot;The Smiling Youth&quot; (το γελαστό παιδί) was also one of the nicknames of Lambrakis.

==Release==
&quot;Z&quot; was picked up for U.S. distribution by the specialty company/New York City theatre chain Cinema 5.

==Reception==
Prints of the film were acquired by the Black Panther Party and shown at underground screenings. An advance copy of the film was shown at the United Front Against Fascism conference in 1969.

It first aired on American television on ABC on 18 March 1974.

===Critical response===
At the time of release, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert, who named &quot;Z&quot; the best film of 1969, liked the screenplay and its message, and wrote, &quot;[&quot;Z&quot;] is a film of our time. It is about how even moral victories are corrupted. It will make you weep and will make you angry. It will tear your guts out...When the Army junta staged its coup in 1967, the right-wing generals and the police chief were cleared of all charges and &#x27;rehabilitated.&#x27; Those responsible for unmasking the assassination now became political criminals. These would seem to be completely political events, but the young director Costa-Gavras has told them in a style that is almost unbearably exciting. &quot;Z&quot; is at the same time a political cry of rage and a brilliant suspense thriller. It even ends in a chase: Not through the streets but through a maze of facts, alibis and official corruption.&quot;

In 2006, critic James Berardinelli wrote, &quot;&quot;Z&quot; was the third feature film from Greek-born Costa-Gavras, but it is the movie that captured him to the world&#x27;s attention, winning a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. It introduced the director&#x27;s signature approach of combining overt political messages with edge-of-the-seat tension.&quot; Jonathan Richards wrote in 2009, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to overstate the impact that this Oscar-winning procedural thriller had in 1969, on a world roiling in political activism, repression, and discord. In the U.S., the Vietnam War was on the front burner, the populace was passionately engaged, and the police riots outside the &#x27;68 Chicago Democratic Convention and the murder of Black Panther Fred Hampton were raw wounds. With this stylish, intense indictment of the assassination of a leftist political leader by a right-wing government cabal in his native Greece, director Costa-Gavras struck a nerve that resonated here and around the globe.&quot;

In 2009, Armond White praised the film and wrote: &quot;Ending with a provocative, unorthodox tally of fascist clampdowns on freedom of expression and the arts, Costa-Gavras angles his exposé with a frightening coda that encapsulates the on-going political struggle. He avoids hippie optimism and foresees contemporary cynicism with a basic thriller device: a warning. Z carries the reverberations of that cultural shift from enlightenment to paranoia in each of its shrewdly devised tropes from common genres. Costa-Gavras expresses the tension and terror of political conspiracy that haunted the democratic and anti-war movements of the sixties—and still does.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 94% &quot;fresh&quot; score based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Powerfully effective, this anti-fascist political thriller stands out as both high-conscience melodrama and high-tempo action movie.&quot;

The film was voted in &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;The 15 Best Political Films of All Time.&quot;

The film was selected to be screened in the Cannes Classics section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.

===Box office===
The film had a total of 3,952,913 admissions in France and was the 4th highest-grossing film of the year. It was also very popular in the United States grossing $17.3 million, being one of the top five highest-grossing non-English language films.

== Awards and nominations ==
&quot;Z&quot; was the second foreign-language film in Academy history to receive a nomination for Best Picture, after &quot;Grand Illusion&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Filmmakers Paul Greengrass and Aki Kaurismäki listed the film in their top 10 films of all time for the 2012 Sight and Sound poll and other films directors such as Michael Haneke, Paul Schrader and John Woo have listed it as one of their favorite films.

The French filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz listed the film as influential to his work.

The French filmmaker Rachid Bouchareb listed &quot;Z&quot; as an influence on his film &quot;Outside the Law&quot;.

It is regarded as one of American filmmaker Oliver Stone&#x27;s favorite films that inspired his filmmaking. John Milius also cited the film as an influence.

The American filmmaker Steven Soderbergh listed &quot;Z&quot; as an inspiration on his film &quot;Traffic&quot; and stated that he &quot;wanted to make it like [Costa-Gavras]&#x27;s Z&quot;.

The American filmmaker William Friedkin listed &quot;Z&quot; as one of his favorite films and mentioned the film&#x27;s influence on him when directing his film &quot;The French Connection&quot;: &quot;After I saw &quot;Z&quot;, I realized how I could shoot &quot;The French Connection&quot;. Because he [Costa-Gavras] shot &quot;Z&quot; like a documentary. It was a fiction film but it was made like it was actually happening. Like the camera didn&#x27;t know what was gonna happen next. And that is an induced technique. It looks like he happened upon the scene and captured what was going on as you do in a documentary. My first films were documentaries too. So I understood what he was doing but I never thought you could do that in a feature at that time until I saw &quot;Z&quot;.&quot; As an homage, Friedkin cast actor Marcel Bozzuffi in a similar role.

The American actor and filmmaker Ben Affleck listed the film as an influence for his film &quot;Argo&quot;.

<text>Walther Hermann Nernst (; 25 June 1864 – 18 November 1941) was a German physical chemist known for his work in thermodynamics, physical chemistry, electrochemistry, and solid-state physics. His formulation of the Nernst heat theorem helped pave the way for the third law of thermodynamics, for which he won the 1920 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He is also known for developing the Nernst equation in 1887.

He studied physics and mathematics at the universities of Zürich, Berlin, Graz and Würzburg, where he received his doctorate 1887. In 1889, he finished his habilitation at University of Leipzig.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Nernst was born in Briesen, Germany (now Wąbrzeźno, Poland) to Gustav Nernst (1827–1888) and Ottilie Nerger (1833–1876). His father was a country judge. Nernst had three older sisters and one younger brother. His third sister died of cholera. Nernst went to elementary school at Graudenz, Germany (now Grudziądz, Poland).

===Studies===
Nernst started undergraduate studies at the University of Zürich in 1883, then after an interlude in Berlin, he returned to Zürich. He wrote his thesis at University of Graz, where Ludwig Boltzmann was professor, though he worked under the direction of Albert von Ettinghausen. They discovered the Ettingshausen and Nernst effects: that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to a metallic conductor in a temperature gradient gives rise to an electrical potential difference, reciprocally, an electric potential difference produces a thermal gradient. Next, he moved to the University of Würzburg under Friedrich Kohlrausch where he submitted and defended his thesis.

=== Professional career ===
Wilhelm Ostwald recruited him to the first department of physical chemistry at Leipzig University. Nernst moved there as an assistant, working on the thermodynamics of electrical currents in solutions. Promoted to lecturer, he taught briefly at the Heidelberg University and then moved to the University of Göttingen. Three years later, he was offered a professorship in Munich. To keep him in Prussia the government created a chair for him at Göttingen. There, he wrote a celebrated textbook &quot;Theoretical Chemistry&quot;, which was translated into English, French, and Russian. He also derived the Nernst equation for the electrical potential generated by unequal concentrations of an ion separated by a membrane that is permeable to the ion. His equation is widely used in cell physiology and neurobiology.

The carbon electric filament lamp then in use was dim and expensive because it required a vacuum in its bulb. Nernst invented a solid-body radiator with a filament of rare-earth oxides, known as the Nernst glower, it is still important in the field of infrared spectroscopy. Continuous ohmic heating of the filament results in conduction. The glower operates best in wavelengths from 2 to 14 micrometers. It gives a bright light but only after a warm-up period. Nernst sold the patent for one million marks, wisely not opting for royalties because soon the tungsten filament lamp filled with inert gas was introduced. With his riches, Nernst in 1898 bought the first of the eighteen automobiles he owned during his lifetime and a country estate of more than five hundred hectares for hunting. He increased the power of his early automobiles by carrying a cylinder of nitrous oxide that he could inject into the carburetor. After eighteen productive years at Göttingen, investigating osmotic pressure and electrochemistry and presenting a theory of how nerves conduct, he moved to Berlin, and was awarded the title of &quot;Geheimrat&quot;.

In 1905, he proposed his &quot;New Heat Theorem&quot;, later known as the Third law of thermodynamics. He showed that as the temperature approached absolute zero, the entropy approaches zero while the free energy remains above zero. This is the work for which he is best remembered, as it enabled chemists to determine free energies (and therefore equilibrium points) of chemical reactions from heat measurements. Theodore Richards claimed that Nernst had stolen his idea, but Nernst is almost universally credited with the discovery. Nernst became friendly with Kaiser Wilhelm, whom he persuaded to found the &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft&quot; for the Advancement of the Sciences with an initial capital of eleven million marks. Nernst&#x27;s laboratory discovered that at low temperatures specific heats fell markedly and would probably disappear at absolute zero. This fall was predicted for liquids and solids in a 1909 paper of Albert Einstein&#x27;s on the quantum mechanics of specific heats at cryogenic temperatures. Nernst was so impressed that he traveled all the way to Zürich to visit Einstein, who was relatively unknown in Zürich in 1909, so people said: &quot;Einstein must be a clever fellow if the great Nernst comes all the way from Berlin to Zürich to talk to him.&quot; Nernst and Planck lobbied to establish a special professorship in Berlin and Nernst donated to its endowment. In 1913 they traveled to Switzerland to persuade Einstein to accept it; a dream job: a named professorship at the top university in Germany, without teaching duties, leaving him free for research.

In 1911, Nernst and Max Planck organized the first Solvay Conference in Brussels. In the following year, the impressionist painter Max Liebermann painted his portrait.

=== World War I ===
In 1914, the Nernsts were entertaining co-workers and students they had brought to their country estate in a private railway car when they learned that war had been declared. Their two older sons entered the army, while thé father enlisted in the voluntary driver&#x27;s corps. He supported the German army against their opponent&#x27;s charges of barbarism by signing the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three, On 21 August 1914, he drove documents from Berlin to the commander of the German right wing in France, advancing with them for two weeks until he could see the glow of the Paris lights at night. The tide turned at the battle of the Marne. When the stalemate in the trenches began, he returned home. He contacted Colonel Max Bauer, the staff officer responsible for munitions, with the idea of driving the defenders out of their trenches with shells releasing tear gas. When his idea was tried one of the observers was Fritz Haber, who argued that too many shells would be needed, it would be better to release a cloud of heavier-than-air poisonous gas; the first chlorine cloud attack on 22 April 1915 was not supported by a strong infantry thrust, so the chance that gas would break the stalemate was irrevocably gone. Nernst was awarded the Iron Cross second class. As a Staff Scientific Advisor in the Imperial German Army, he directed research on explosives, much of which was done in his laboratory where they developed guanidine perchlorate. Then he worked on the development of trench mortars. He was awarded the Iron Cross first class and later the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;. When the high command was considering unleashing unrestricted submarine warfare, he asked the Kaiser for an opportunity to warn about the enormous potential of the United States as an adversary. They would not listen, General Erich Ludendorff shouted him down for &quot;incompetent nonsense.&quot; 

=== Return to research ===
Nernst published his book &quot;The Foundations of the New Heat Theorem&quot;. In 1918, after studying photochemistry, he proposed the atomic chain reaction theory. It stated that when a reaction in which free atoms are formed that can decompose target molecules into more free atoms would result in a chain reaction. His theory is closely related to the natural process of nuclear fission.

In 1920, he and his family briefly fled abroad because he was one of the scientists on the Allied list of war criminals. Later that year he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in recognition of his work on thermochemistry. He was elected Rector of Berlin University for 1921–1922. He set up an agency to channel government and private funds to young scientists and declined becoming Ambassador to the United States. For two unhappy years, he was the president of the &quot;Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt&quot; (National Physical Laboratory), where he could not cope with the &quot;mixture of mediocrity and red tape&quot;. In 1924, he became director of the &quot;Institute of Physical Chemistry&quot; at Berlin.

In 1927, the decrease in specific heat at low temperatures was extended to gases. He studied the theories of cosmic rays and cosmology.

Although a press release described him as &quot;completely unmusical&quot;, Nernst developed an electric piano, the Neo-Bechstein-Flügel in 1930 in association with the Bechstein and Siemens companies, replacing the sounding board with vacuum tube amplifiers. The piano used electromagnetic pickups to produce electronically modified and amplified sound in the same way as an electric guitar. In fact, he was a pianist, sometimes accompanying Einstein&#x27;s violin.

=== Rejection of antisemitism ===
In 1933, Nernst learned that a colleague, with whom he had hoped to collaborate, had been dismissed from the department because he was a Jew. Nernst immediately taxied to see Haber to request a position in his Institute, which was not controlled by the government, only to learn that Haber was moving to England. Soon, Nernst was in trouble for declining to fill out a government form on his racial origins. He retired from his professorship but was sacked from the board of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. He lived quietly in the country; in 1937 he traveled to the University of Oxford to receive an honorary degree, also visiting his eldest daughter, her husband, and his three grandchildren.

=== Death ===
Nernst had a severe heart attack in 1939. He died in 1941 at Zibelle, Germany (now Niwica, Poland). He was buried three times. He was buried the first time near the place of his death. However, his remains were moved to Berlin, where he was buried a second time. Finally they were moved again and buried near the graves of Max Planck, Otto Hahn and Max von Laue in Göttingen, Germany.

== Personal life and family ==
Nernst married Emma Lohmeyer in 1892 with whom he had two sons and three daughters. Both of Nernst&#x27;s sons died fighting in World War I. 

With his colleagues at the University of Leipzig, Jacobus Henricus van’t Hoff and Svante Arrhenius, hé was establishing the foundations of a new theoretical and experimental field of inquiry within chemistry and suggested setting fire to unused coal seams to increase the global temperature. He was a vocal critic of Adolf Hitler and of Nazism, and two of his three daughters married Jewish men. After Hitler came to power they emigrated, one to England and the other to Brazil.

=== Personality ===
Nernst was mechanically minded in that he was always thinking of ways to apply new discoveries to industry. His hobbies included hunting and fishing. His friend Albert Einstein was amused by &quot;his childlike vanity and self-complacency&quot; &quot;His own study and laboratory always presented aspects of extreme chaos which his coworkers termed appropriately &#x27;the state of maximum entropy&#x27;&quot;.

==Honours==
In 1923, botanist Ignatz Urban published &quot;Nernstia&quot;, which is a genus of flowering plants from Mexico, in the family Rubiaceae and named in his honour.

<text>The Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS, CMS, or Chicago) is a style guide for American English published since 1906 by the University of Chicago Press. Its 18 editions (the most recent in 2024) have prescribed writing and citation styles widely used in publishing.

The guide specifically focuses on American English and deals with aspects of editorial practice, including grammar and usage, as well as document preparation and formatting. It is available in print as a hardcover book, and by subscription as a searchable website as &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style Online.&quot; The online version provides some free resources, primarily aimed at teachers, students, and libraries.

==Availability and uses==
&quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; is published in hardcover and online. The online edition includes the searchable text of the 16th through 18th—its most recent—editions with features such as tools for editors, a citation guide summary, and searchable access to a Q&amp;A, where University of Chicago Press editors answer readers&#x27; style questions. &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; also discusses the parts of a book and the editing process. An annual subscription is required for access to the online content of the manual (access to the Q&amp;A, however, is free, as are various editing tools).

Many publishers throughout the world adopt &quot;Chicago&quot; as their style. It is used in some social science publications, most North American historical journals, and remains the basis for the &quot;Style Guide of the American Anthropological Association&quot;, the &quot;Style Sheet&quot; for the Organization of American Historians, and corporate style guides, including the &quot;Apple Style Guide&quot;.

&quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; includes chapters relevant to publishers of books and journals. It is used widely by academic and some trade publishers, as well as editors and authors who are required by those publishers to follow it. Kate L. Turabian&#x27;s &quot;A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations&quot; also reflects Chicago style.

&quot;Chicago&quot; style offers writers a choice of several different formats. It allows the mixing of formats, provided that the result is clear and consistent. For instance, the 15th edition of &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; permits the use of both in-text citation systems and/or footnotes or endnotes, including use of &quot;content notes&quot;; it gives information about in-text citation by page number (such as MLA style) or by year of publication (like APA style); it even provides for variations in styles of footnotes and endnotes, depending on whether the paper includes a full bibliography at the end.

==Citation styles==
Two types of citation styles are provided. In both cases, two parts are needed: first, notation in the text, which indicates that the information immediately preceding was from another source; and second, the full citation, which is placed at another location.

===Author-date style===
Using author-date style, the sourced text is indicated parenthetically with the last name(s) of the author(s) and the year of publication with no intervening punctuation.

When page numbers are used, they are placed along with the author&#x27;s last name and date of publication an interposed comma. 


If the author&#x27;s name is used in the text, only the date of publication need be cited parenthetically (with or without the page number).

In-text citations are usually placed just inside a mark of punctuation. An exception to this rule is for block quotations, where the citation is placed outside the punctuation.

The full citation for the source is then included in a references section at the end of the material. As publication dates are prominent in this style, the reference entry places the publication date &quot;following&quot; the author(s) name.

===Notes and bibliography style===
Using notes and bibliography style, the sourced text is indicated by a superscripted note number that corresponds to a full citation either at the bottom of the page (as a footnote) or at the end of a main body of text (as an endnote). In both instances, the citation is also placed in a bibliography entry at the end of the material, listed in alphabetical order of the author&#x27;s last name. The two formats differ: notes use commas where bibliography entries use periods.

The following is an example of a journal article citation provided as a note and its bibliography entry.

In order of appearance, the elements of a bibliography entry are:
* The author(s), with the first author&#x27;s name inverted in the bibliography entry (in this case &quot;Heilman, James M., and Andrew G. West&quot;);
* The article title inside quotation marks (in this case &quot;&quot;Wikipedia and Medicine: Quantifying Readership, Editors, and the Significance of Natural Language.&quot;&quot;);
* The journal title in italics (in this case &quot;&quot;Journal of Medical Internet Research&quot;);
* The volume (in this case &quot;17&quot;);
* The issue preceded by &quot;no.&quot; (in this case &quot;no. 3&quot;);
* The year and, if specified, month, inside parentheses (in this case &quot;(2015)&quot;);
* The page numbers, with notes listing the current reference&#x27;s specific page number and bibliography entries listing the overall page range (in this case &quot;e62&quot; since the example was published electronically without page numbers); and
* The digital object identifier (in this case &quot;doi:10.2196/jmir.4069&quot;).

==History==

What now is known as &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; was first published in 1906 under the title &quot;Manual of Style: Being a compilation of the typographical rules in force at the University of Chicago Press, to which are appended specimens of type in use&quot;. From its first 203-page edition, the &quot;CMOS&quot; evolved into a comprehensive reference style guide of 1,146 pages in its 17th edition. It was one of the first editorial style guides published in the United States, and it is largely responsible for research methodology standardization, notably citation style.

The most significant revision to the manual was made for the 12th edition, published in 1969. Its first printing of 20,000 copies sold out before it was printed. In 1982, with the publication of the 13th edition, it was officially retitled &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, adopting the informal name already in widespread use.

More recently, the publishers have released a new edition about every seven to ten years. The 15th edition (2003) was revised to reflect the emergence of computer technology and the internet in publishing, offering guidance for citing electronic works. Other changes include a chapter on American English grammar and use, and a revised treatment of mathematical copy.

In August 2010, the 16th edition was published simultaneously in the hardcover and online editions for the first time in the manual&#x27;s history. In a departure from the earlier red-orange cover, the 16th edition features a robin&#x27;s-egg blue dust jacket (a nod to older editions with blue jackets, such as the 11th and 12th). The 16th edition featured &quot;music, foreign languages, and computer topics (such as Unicode characters and URLs)&quot;. It also expands recommendations for producing electronic publications, including web-based content and e-books. An updated appendix on production and digital technology demystified the process of electronic workflow and offered a primer on the use of XML markup. It also includes a revised glossary, including a host of terms associated with electronic and print publishing. The &quot;Chicago&quot; system of documentation is streamlined to achieve greater consistency between the author-date and notes-bibliography systems of citation, making both systems easier to use. In addition, updated and expanded examples address the many questions that arise when documenting online and digital sources, from the use of DOIs to citing social networking sites. Figures and tables are updated throughout the book, including a return to manual&#x27;s popular hyphenation table and new, selective listings of Unicode numbers for special characters.

In 2013, an adapted Spanish version was published by the University of Deusto in Bilbao, Spain.

In April 2016, the publisher released &quot;The Chicago Guide to Grammar, Usage, and Punctuation&quot;, Bryan A. Garner&#x27;s expansion of his &quot;Chicago Manual of Style&quot; chapter on the topic, and coinciding with the release of the new edition of &quot;Garner&#x27;s Modern American Usage&quot;.

The 17th edition was published in September 2017. It offers new and expanded style guidelines in response to advancing technology and social change. It also includes new and revised content reflecting the latest publishing practices and electronic workflows and self-publishing. Citation recommendations, the glossary of problematic words and phrases, and the bibliography have all been updated and expanded. In the 17th edition, email lost its hyphen, internet became lowercase, the singular &quot;they&quot; and &quot;their&quot; are now acceptable in certain circumstances, a major new section on syntax has been added, and the long-standing recommendation to use &quot;ibid&quot; has changed due to electronic publishing.

The 18th edition was the first to recommend omitting publication locations from citations. It added citation styles for A.I. generated text and images, increased the scope of usage of singular and non-binary &quot;they,&quot; and abandoned its efforts (since 1969) of writing &quot;Roman&quot; in &quot;Roman numerals&quot; in lowercase. It removed the chapter on mathematics in type (citing low usage) but increased its coverage of citations of Indigenous languages (now with capital &quot;I&quot;) and of Korean.

<text>Year 430 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Crassus and Iullus (or, less frequently, year 324 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 430 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* The army of Sparta loots Attica for a second time, but Pericles is not daunted and refuses to revise his initial strategy. Unwilling to engage the Spartan army in battle, he again leads a naval expedition to plunder the coasts of the Peloponnesus, this time taking 100 Athenian ships with him.
* Potidaea finally capitulates to the siege by Athenian forces in the winter.
* An outbreak of a plague hits Athens and the disease ravages the densely packed city (modern DNA analyses of material from ancient cemeteries suggest the mortal disease may have been typhus). The plague wipes out over 30,000 citizens, sailors, and soldiers as well as Pericles&#x27; two sons. Roughly one-quarter of the Athenian population dies. The fear of plague is so widespread that the Spartan invasion of Attica is abandoned, their troops being unwilling to risk contact with the diseased enemy.
* Pericles becomes ill from the plague but he recovers, temporarily. He is deposed from his position as General (or Strategos) but is later reappointed.

=== By topic ===
==== Art ====
* Polyclitus completes one of his greatest statues, the &quot;Diadumenos&quot; (&quot;Diadem-bearer&quot;).
* Approximate date – Sophocles&#x27; drama &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; is first performed in Athens.

==== Religion ====
* Traditional date where scholars believe the Hebrew prophet known as Malachi writes the 39th and last book, and last of the prophetic books, of the Old Testament of the Biblical canon, the Book of Malachi. Biblical books written between now and the millennium will not be included in the Hebrew Bible and in some Christian traditions considered Biblical apocrypha.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==

== Deaths ==
* Empedocles, Greek philosopher (approximate date) (b. c. 490 BC)
* Phidias, Greek sculptor (approximate date) (b. c. 480 BC)
* Zeno of Elea, Greek philosopher (approximate date) (b. c. 490 BC)

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* Pericles concludes a defensive alliance with Corcyra (Corfu), the strong naval power in the Ionian Sea, which is the bitter enemy of Corinth. As a result, Athens intervenes in the dispute between Corinth and Corcyra, and, at the Battle of Sybota, a small contingent of Athenian ships play a critical role in preventing a Corinthian fleet from capturing Corcyra. Following this, Athens places Potidaea, a tributary ally of Athens but a colony of Corinth, under siege.
* The Corinthians, upset by Athens&#x27; actions, lobby Sparta to take action against Athens. This appeal is backed by Megara (which is being severely affected by Pericles&#x27; economic sanctions) and by Aegina (which is being heavily taxed by Pericles and which has been refused home rule).
* Pericles renews alliances with the Rhegium on the southwest corner of Italy and Leontini in southeast Sicily, threatening Sparta&#x27;s food supply route from Sicily.

=== By topic ===
==== Art ====
* A set of sixty-five bells, from the Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng (Zhou dynasty) in Suixian, Hubei, is made. It is now preserved at the Hubei Provincial Museum in Wuhan.

<text>Year 434 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Second year of the Consulship of Gaius Julius Iullus and Lucius (or Proculus) VerginiusTricostus or the Year of the Consulship of Capitolinus and Praetextatus and the Year of the Tribunate of Cossus, Praetextatus and Capitolinus (or, less frequently, year 320 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 434 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* Under the leadership of Pericles, Athens introduces a series of measures (the &quot;Megarian decree&quot;) imposing an economic embargo on Megara for violations of land sacred to Demeter. According to the provisions of the decree, Megarian merchants are to be excluded from the market of Athens and the ports in its empire. This ban strangles the Megarian economy and strains the fragile peace between Athens and Sparta, which is allied with Megara.
* Philip, brother of Perdiccas II of Macedon challenges Perdiccas for the throne, and enlists the support of Athens and King Derdas of Elimea. Perdiccas responds by stirring up rebellion in a number of Athenian tribute cities, including Potidaea.
* Anaxagoras is arrested by Pericles&#x27; political opponents on a charge of contravening the established dogmas of Athenian religion. It takes Pericles&#x27; power of oratory and persuasion to secure his release, and even then, he is fined and forced to retire from Athens to Lampsacus in Ionia.

<text>A content management system (CMS) is computer software used to manage the creation and modification of digital content (content management).
A CMS is typically used for enterprise content management (ECM) and web content management (WCM). ECM typically supports multiple users in a collaborative environment, by integrating document management, digital asset management, and record retention. Alternatively, WCM is the collaborative authoring for websites and may include text and embed graphics, photos, video, audio, maps, and program code that display content and interact with the user. ECM typically includes a WCM function.

== Structure ==

A CMS typically has two major components: a content management application (CMA), as the front-end user interface that allows a user, even with limited expertise, to add, modify, and remove content from a website without the intervention of a webmaster; and a content delivery application (CDA), that compiles the content and updates the website.

== Installation type ==
There are two types of CMS installation: on-premises and cloud-based. On-premises installation means that the CMS software can be installed on the server. Notable CMSs which can be installed on-premises are Drupal, Grav, Joomla, ModX, Wordpress.org and others. The cloud-based CMS is hosted on the vendor environment. Examples of notable cloud-based CMSs are Adobe Experience Manager, Contentful, Ghost, SquareSpace, Webflow, WIX, and Wordpress.com.

== Common features ==
The core CMS features are: indexing, search and retrieval, format management, revision control, and management. Features may vary depending on the system application but will typically include:

* Intuitive indexing, search, and retrieval features index all data for easy access through search functions and allow users to search by attributes such as publication dates, keywords or author.
* Format management facilitates turning scanned paper documents and legacy electronic documents into HTML or PDF documents.
* Revision features allow content to be updated and edited after initial publication. Revision control also tracks any changes made to files by individuals.
* Publishing functionality allows individuals to use a template or a set of templates approved by the organization, as well as wizards and other tools to create or modify content.

Popular additional features may include:

* SEO-friendly URLs
* Integrated and online help, including discussion boards
* Group-based permission systems
* Full template support and customizable templates
* Easy wizard-based install and versioning procedures
* Admin panel with multiple language support
* Content hierarchy with unlimited depth and size
* Minimal server requirements
* Integrated file managers
* Integrated audit logs
* Support AMP page for Google
* Support schema markup
* Designed as per Google quality guidelines for website architecture
* Availability of plug-ins for additional functionalities.
* Security precautions such as 2 Factor Authentication

== Other types of content management systems ==

Digital asset management systems are another type of CMS. They manage content with clearly defined author or ownership, such as documents, movies, pictures, phone numbers, and scientific data. Companies also use CMSs to store, control, revise, and publish documentation. There are also component content management systems (CCMS), which are CMSs that manage content at a modular level rather than as pages or articles. CCMSs are often used in technical communication, where many publications reuse the same content. Headless CMS, which separates content from its delivery layer, offers greater flexibility in content distribution across various platforms.

== Widely used CMSs ==

Based on a survey, the most widely used content management system is WordPress, used by 43.6% of the top 10 million websites as of October 2021. Other commonly used content management systems include Squarespace, Joomla, Shopify, and Wix.

<text>Webmail (or web-based email) is an email service that can be accessed using a standard web browser. It contrasts with email service accessible through a specialised email client software. Additionally, many internet service providers (ISP) provide webmail as part of their internet service package. Similarly, some web hosting providers also provide webmail as a part of their hosting package.

As with any web application, webmail&#x27;s main advantage over the use of a desktop email client is the ability to send and receive email anywhere from a web browser.

== History ==

=== Early implementations ===

The first Web Mail implementation was developed at CERN in 1993 by Phillip Hallam-Baker as a test of the HTTP protocol stack, but was not developed further. In the next two years, however, several people produced working webmail applications.

In Europe, there were three implementations, Søren Vejrum&#x27;s &quot;WWW Mail&quot;, Luca Manunza&#x27;s &quot;WebMail&quot;, and Remy Wetzels&#x27; &quot;WebMail&quot;. Søren Vejrum&#x27;s &quot;WWW Mail&quot; was written when he was studying and working at the Copenhagen Business School in Denmark, and was released on February 28, 1995. Luca Manunza&#x27;s &quot;WebMail&quot; was written while he was working at CRS4 in Sardinia, from an idea of Gianluigi Zanetti, with the first source release on March 30, 1995. Remy Wetzels&#x27; &quot;WebMail&quot; was written while he was studying at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands for the DSE and was released early January 1995.

In the United States, Matt Mankins wrote &quot;Webex&quot;, and Bill Fitler, while at , began working on an implementation which he demonstrated publicly at Lotusphere on January 24, 1995. Matt Mankins, under the supervision of Dr. Burt Rosenberg at the University of Miami, released his &quot;Webex&quot; application source code in a post to comp.mail.misc on August 8, 1995, although it had been in use as the primary email application at the School of Architecture where Mankins worked for some months prior.

Bill Fitler&#x27;s webmail implementation was further developed as a commercial product, which Lotus announced and released in the fall of 1995 as &quot;cc:Mail for the World Wide Web 1.0&quot;; thereby providing an alternative means of accessing a cc:Mail message store (the usual means being a cc:Mail desktop application that operated either via dialup or within the confines of a local area network).

Early commercialization of webmail was also achieved when &quot;Webex&quot; began to be sold by Mankins&#x27; company, DotShop, Inc., at the end of 1995. Within DotShop, &quot;Webex&quot; changed its name to &quot;EMUmail&quot;; which would be sold to companies like UPS and Rackspace until its sale to Accurev in 2001. EMUmail was one of the first applications to feature a free version that included embedded advertising, as well as a licensed version that did not.

Hotmail and Four11&#x27;s RocketMail both launched in 1996 as free services and immediately became very popular.

=== Widespread deployment ===
As the 1990s progressed, and into the 2000s, it became more common for the general public to have access to webmail because:

* many Internet service providers (such as EarthLink) and web hosting providers (such as Verio) began bundling webmail into their service offerings (often in parallel with POP/SMTP services);
* many other enterprises (such as universities and large corporations) also started offering webmail as a way for their user communities to access their email (either locally managed or outsourced);
* webmail service providers (such as Hotmail and RocketMail) emerged in 1996 as a free service to the general public, and rapidly gained in popularity.

In some cases, webmail application software is developed in-house by the organizations running and managing the application, and in some cases it is obtained from software companies that develop and sell such applications, usually as part of an integrated mail server package (an early example being Netscape Messaging Server). The market for webmail application software has continued into the 2010s.

== Rendering and compatibility ==
Email users may find the use of both a webmail client and a desktop client using the POP3 protocol presents some difficulties. For example, email messages that are downloaded by the desktop client and are removed from the server will no longer be available on the webmail client. The user is limited to previewing messages using the web client before they are downloaded by the desktop email client. However, one may choose to leave the emails on the server, in which case this problem does not occur. The use of both a webmail client and a desktop client using the IMAP4 protocol allows the contents of the mailbox to be consistently displayed in both the webmail and desktop clients and any action the user performs on messages in one interface will be reflected when the email is accessed via the other interface. There are significant differences in rendering capabilities for many popular webmail services such as Gmail, Outlook.com and Yahoo! Mail. Due to the varying treatment of HTML tags, such as &lt;style&gt; and &lt;head&gt;, as well as CSS rendering inconsistencies, email marketing companies rely on older web development techniques to send cross-platform mail. This usually means a greater reliance on tables and inline stylesheets.

Microsoft Windows applications by default create email messages via MAPI. Several vendors produce tools to provide a MAPI interface to webmail.

== Privacy concerns ==

Although emails stored unencrypted on any service provider&#x27;s servers can be read by that service provider, specific concerns have been raised regarding webmail services that automatically analyze the contents of users&#x27; emails for the purpose of targeted advertising. At least two such services, Gmail and Yahoo! Mail, give users the option to opt out of targeted advertising.

Webmail that is accessed over unsecured HTTP may be readable by a third party who has access to the data transmission, such as over an unsecured Wi-Fi connection. This may be avoided by connecting to the webmail service via HTTPS, which encrypts the connection. Gmail has supported HTTPS since launch and in 2014 began requiring it for all webmail connections. Yahoo! Mail added the option to connect over HTTPS in 2013 and made HTTPS required in 2014.

<text>The Motion Picture Association film rating system is used in the United States and its territories to rate a motion picture&#x27;s suitability for certain audiences based on its content. The system and the ratings applied to individual motion pictures are the responsibility of the Motion Picture Association (MPA), previously known as the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) from 1945 to 2019. The MPA rating system is a voluntary scheme that is not enforced by law; films can be exhibited without a rating, although most theaters refuse to exhibit non-rated or NC-17 rated films. Non-members of the MPA may also submit films for rating. Other media, such as television programs, music and video games, are rated by other entities such as the TV Parental Guidelines, the RIAA and the ESRB, respectively.

In effect as of November 1968, following the Hays Code of the classical Hollywood cinema era, the MPA rating system is one of various motion picture rating systems that are used to help parents decide what films are appropriate for their children. It is administered by the Classification &amp; Ratings Administration (CARA), an independent division of the MPA.

== Ratings ==

=== MPA film ratings ===
The MPA film ratings are as follows:

In 2013, the MPA ratings were visually redesigned, with the rating displayed on a left panel and the name of the rating shown above it. A larger panel on the right provides a more detailed description of the film&#x27;s content and an explanation of the rating level is placed on a horizontal bar at the bottom of the rating.

=== Content descriptors ===
Film ratings often have accompanying brief descriptions of the specifics behind the film&#x27;s content and why it received a certain rating. They are displayed in trailers, posters, and on the backside of home video releases. Film rating content descriptors are exclusively used for films rated from PG to NC-17; they are not used for G-rated films because the content in them is suitable for all audiences even if containing mild objectionable content.

=== Other labels ===
If a film has not been submitted for a rating or is an uncut version of a film that was submitted, the labels Not Rated (NR) or Unrated (UR) are often used. Uncut/extended versions of films that are labeled &quot;Unrated&quot; also contain warnings saying that the uncut version of the film contains content that differs from the theatrical release and might not be suitable for minors.

If a film has not yet been assigned a final rating, the label This Film Is Not Yet Rated is used in trailers and television commercials.

== Regulation of promotional materials and releases ==

The MPA also rates film trailers, print advertising, posters, and other media used to promote a film.

===Theatrical trailers===

Rating cards appear at the head of trailers in the United States which indicate how closely the trailer adheres to the MPA&#x27;s (and prior to November 2019, the MPAA&#x27;s) standards.

* Green band: When the trailer accompanies another rated feature, the wording on the green title card states, as of May 2013, &quot;The following preview has been approved to accompany this feature.&quot; For trailers hosted on the Internet, the wording is tweaked to &quot;The following preview has been approved for appropriate audiences.&quot; Until April 2009, these cards indicated that they had been approved for &quot;all audiences&quot; and often included the film&#x27;s MPAA rating. This signified that the trailer adhered to the standards for motion picture advertising outlined by the MPAA, which included limitations on foul language and violent, sexual, or otherwise objectionable imagery. In April 2009, the MPAA began to permit the green band language to say that a trailer had been approved for &quot;appropriate&quot; audiences, meaning that the material would be appropriate for audiences in theaters, based on the content of the film they had come to see. In May 2013, the MPAA changed the trailer approval band from &quot;for appropriate audiences&quot; to &quot;to accompany this feature&quot;, but only when accompanying a feature film; for bands not accompanying a feature film, the text of the band remained the same. The font and style of the text on the graphic bands (green and red) was also changed at the time the green band was revised in 2013.
* Yellow band: A yellow title card was introduced in 2007 for trailers with restricted content hosted on the Internet, with the message &quot;The following preview has been approved only for age-appropriate Internet users.&quot; The MPAA stipulated that yellow-band trailers hosted on studio websites should only be available between 9:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. (i.e., 21:00 through 04:00 local time), and that for other websites hosting the trailers, at least 80% of its typical user base should be adults. The yellow card was reserved for trailers previewing films rated PG-13 or stronger. An early example was a yellow-band trailer for Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; (2007). Yellow-band trailers were not widely adopted and were apparently abandoned within a few years: in 2013, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that age-restricted trailers online were released with red bands. The 2019 edition of CARA&#x27;s advertising guidelines reference only green and red bands for internet trailers.
* Red band: A red title card is issued to trailers which do not adhere to the MPA/CARA guidelines. It indicates that the trailer is approved for only &quot;restricted&quot; or &quot;mature&quot; audiences, and when it accompanies another feature, the wording states &quot;The following restricted preview has been approved to accompany this feature only.&quot; For trailers hosted on the Internet, the wording is tweaked to &quot;The following restricted preview has been approved for appropriate audiences.&quot; The red title card is reserved for trailers previewing R and NC-17 rated films: these trailers may include nudity, profanity, or other material deemed inappropriate for children. Such trailers are officially meant to be locked behind age verification systems. However, these &quot;age gates&quot; have been described as &quot;ineffective&quot; and an &quot;honor system&quot;; furthermore, many YouTube channels which exist to syndicate film and television trailers do not feature any check, which has led to criticism from watchdog groups like Common Sense Media. In 2007, red-band trailers were said to be virtually absent from theaters, due to worries that they would accidentally be shown before films released at a less-restrictive rating. However, by the following year, they were noted as increasingly prevalent as the adoption of digital projection had largely alleviated these concerns. These trailers may only be shown theatrically before R-rated, NC-17-rated, or unrated movies.

=== Releases ===

The MPA also creates blue feature tags for theatrical and home media use. Theatrical releases show the blue tag after the film, with home media releases showing it prior to the film. They feature the rating block and any content descriptors as assigned by the Classification and Rating Administration, the MPA logo, and links to MPA websites along the bottom.

== History ==
=== Replacement of the Hays Code ===
Jack Valenti, who had become president of the Motion Picture Association of America in May 1966, deemed the Motion Picture Production Code, which had been in place since 1930 and rigorously enforced since July 1, 1934, out of date and bearing &quot;the odious smell of censorship&quot;. Filmmakers were pushing at the boundaries of the code with some even going as far as filing lawsuits against the &quot;Hays Code&quot; by invoking the First Amendment. Valenti cited examples such as &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, which used prohibited language including &quot;hump the hostess&quot;, and &quot;Blowup&quot;, which was denied Code approval due to nudity, resulting in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, then a member studio of the MPAA, releasing it through a subsidiary. Valenti revised the Code to include the &quot;SMA&quot; (Suggested for Mature Audiences) advisory as a stopgap measure. To accommodate &quot;the irresistible force of creators determined to make &#x27;their films&#x27;, and to avoid &quot;the possible intrusion of government into the movie arena&quot;, he developed a set of advisory ratings which could be applied after a film was completed.

On November 1, 1968, the voluntary MPAA film rating system took effect, with three organizations serving as its monitoring and guiding groups: the MPAA, the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO), and the International Film Importers &amp; Distributors of America (IFIDA). Only films that premiered in the United States after that date were affected by this. Walter Reade was the only one of 75 top U.S. exhibitors who refused to use the ratings. Warner Bros.-Seven Arts&#x27; &quot;The Girl on a Motorcycle&quot; was the first film to receive the X rating, and was distributed by their Claridge Pictures subsidiary. Two other films were rated X by the time the MPAA published their first weekly bulletin listing ratings: Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Sin With a Stranger&quot; and Universal&#x27;s &quot;Birds in Peru&quot;. Both films were subsequently released by subsidiaries.

The ratings used from 1968 to 1970 were:
* Rated G: Suggested for general audiences.
* Rated M: Suggested for mature audiences - Parental discretion advised.
* Rated R: Restricted – Persons under 16 not admitted, unless accompanied by parent or adult guardian.
* Rated X: Persons under 16 not admitted.

This content classification system originally was to have three ratings, with the intention of allowing parents to take their children to any film they chose. However, the National Association of Theatre Owners urged the creation of an adults-only category, fearful of possible legal problems in local jurisdictions. The &quot;X&quot; rating was not an MPAA trademark and would not receive the MPAA seal; any producer not submitting a film for MPAA rating could self-apply the &quot;X&quot; rating (or any other symbol or description that was not an MPAA trademark).

=== From M to GP to PG ===
In 1970, the ages for &quot;R&quot; and &quot;X&quot; were raised from 16 to 17. Also, due to confusion over whether &quot;M&quot;-rated films were suitable for children, &quot;M&quot; was renamed to &quot;GP&quot; (for General audiences, Parental guidance suggested), and in 1971, the MPAA added the content advisory &quot;Some material not generally suitable for pre-teenagers&quot;. On February 11, 1972, &quot;GP&quot; was revised to &quot;PG&quot;.

The ratings used from 1970 to 1972 were:
* Rated G: All ages admitted – General audiences.
* Rated GP: All ages admitted – Parental guidance suggested. [Sometimes a disclaimer would say &quot;This film contains material which may not be suitable for pre-teenagers.&quot;]
* Rated R: Restricted – Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.
* Rated X: No one under 17 admitted.

The ratings used from 1972 to 1984 were:
* Rated G: General audiences – All ages admitted.
* Rated PG: Parental guidance suggested – Some material may not be suitable for [pre-teenagers (1972–1977)] / [children (1977–1984)].
* Rated R: Restricted – Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.
* Rated X: No one under 17 admitted.

=== Addition of the PG-13 rating ===
In the 1980s, complaints about violence and gore in films such as &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; and &quot;Gremlins&quot;, both of which received PG ratings, refocused attention on films seen by younger children. According to author Filipa Antunes, this revealed the conundrum of a film that &quot;could not be recommended for all children but could also not be repudiated for all children uniformly,&quot; leading to speculation that the rating system&#x27;s PG classification &quot;no longer matched a notion of childhood most parents in America could agree on.&quot; Steven Spielberg, director of &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; and executive producer of &quot;Gremlins&quot;, suggested a new intermediate rating between &quot;PG&quot; and &quot;R&quot;. The &quot;PG-13&quot; rating was introduced on July 1, 1984, with the advisory &quot;Parents Are Strongly Cautioned to Give Special Guidance for Attendance of Children Under 13 – Some Material May Be Inappropriate for Young Children&quot;. The first film to be released with this rating was the John Milius war film &quot;Red Dawn&quot;. In 1985, the wording was simplified to &quot;Parents Strongly Cautioned – Some Material May Be Inappropriate for Children Under 13&quot;. Around the same time, the MPAA won a trademark infringement lawsuit against the producers and distributors of &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; over a fraudulent application of its R rating to the uncut version of the film, and forced its member studios and several other home video distributors to put MPAA ratings on the packaging of MPAA-rated films via a settlement that would come into effect by fall that year.

The ratings used from 1984 to 1990 were:
* Rated G: General audiences – All ages admitted.
* Rated PG: Parental guidance suggested – Some material may not be suitable for children.
* Rated PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned – Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.
* Rated R: Restricted – Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.
* Rated X: No one under 17 admitted.

=== Tennessee law ===
In 1989, Tennessee state law set the minimum age to view a theatrically exhibited R-rated film without adult accompaniment at 18, instead of 17, and categorized the admission of minors to X-rated films as a misdemeanor. The statute remained in force until 2013, when it was ruled to be in violation of the First Amendment. The law was amended in 2013 as to prohibit persons under the age of 18 only if the film was considered &quot;harmful to minors&quot;.

=== X replaced by NC-17 ===

In the rating system&#x27;s early years, &quot;X&quot;-rated films such as &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969) and &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971) were understood to be unsuitable for children, but non-pornographic and intended for the general public. However, pornographic films often self-applied the non-trademarked &quot;X&quot; rating, and it soon became synonymous with pornography in American culture. In late 1989 and early 1990, respectively, &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover&quot;, two critically acclaimed art films featuring strong adult content, were released. Neither film was approved for an MPAA rating, limiting their commercial distribution and prompting criticism of the rating system&#x27;s lack of a designation for such films.

In September 1990, the MPAA introduced the rating NC-17 (&quot;No Children Under 17 Admitted&quot;). &quot;Henry &amp; June&quot;, previously to be assigned an X rating, was the first film to receive the NC-17 rating instead. Although films with an NC-17 rating had more mainstream distribution opportunities than X-rated films, many theaters refused to screen them, most entertainment media did not accept advertising for them, and many large video outlets refused to stock them.

The ratings used from 1990 to 1996 were:
* Rated G: General audiences – All ages admitted.
* Rated PG: Parental guidance suggested – Some material may not be suitable for children.
* Rated PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned – Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.
* Rated R: Restricted – Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.
* Rated NC-17: No children under 17 admitted.

In 1996, the minimum age for NC-17-rated films was raised to 18, by rewording it to &quot;No One 17 and Under Admitted&quot;. The ratings used since 1996 are:
* Rated G: General audiences – All ages admitted.
* Rated PG: Parental guidance suggested – Some material may not be suitable for children.
* Rated PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned – Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.
* Rated R: Restricted – Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.
* Rated NC-17: Adults only – No one 17 and under admitted.

Since September 1990, the MPAA has included explanations, or &quot;descriptors&quot;, of why each film received an &quot;R&quot; rating, allowing parents to know what type of content the film contained. For example, the descriptor for &quot;The Girl Who Played with Fire&quot; read &quot;Rated [R] for brutal violence including a rape, some strong sexual content, nudity and language.&quot;

By the early 2000s, the MPAA began applying rating explanations for PG, PG-13, and NC-17-rated films as well.

== Rating components ==
=== Violence ===
Depictions of violence are permitted under all ratings but must be moderated for the lower ones. Violence must be kept to a minimum in G-rated films and must not be intense in PG-rated films. Depictions of intense violence are permitted under the PG-13 rating, but violence that is both realistic and extreme or persistent will generally require at least an R rating.

=== Language ===
Snippets of language that go &quot;beyond polite conversation&quot; are permitted in G-rated films, but no stronger words are present. Profanity may be present in PG rated films, and use of one of the harsher &quot;sexually-derived words&quot; as an expletive will initially incur at least a PG-13 rating. More than one occurrence will usually incur an R rating as will the usage of such an expletive in a sexual context. Known as the &quot;automatic language rule&quot;, the rule has been applied differently depending on the subject matter of the film. For example, &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976) received a PG rating after appealing it from an R, despite multiple instances of strong language, likely because of its historic subject matter. The automatic language rule is arguably the rule that can most often be successfully appealed. The ratings board may award a PG-13 rating passed by a two-thirds majority if they believe the language is justified by the context or by the manner in which the words are used.

It is sometimes claimed that films rated PG-13 are only able to use the expletive &quot;fuck&quot; once to avoid an R rating for language. There are several exceptional cases in which PG-13-rated films contain multiple occurrences of the word &quot;fuck&quot;: &quot;Adventures in Babysitting,&quot; where the word is used twice in the same scene; &quot;Antwone Fisher&quot; which has three uses; &quot;Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour&quot;, which has four uses (six in the &quot;Taylor&#x27;s Version&quot; cut); &quot;The Hip Hop Project&quot;, which has seventeen uses; and &quot;Gunner Palace&quot;, a documentary of soldiers in the Iraq War, which has 42 uses of the word with two used sexually. Both &quot;Bully&quot;, a 2011 documentary about bullying, and &quot;Philomena&quot;—which has two instances of the word—released in 2013, were originally given R ratings on grounds of the language but the ratings were dropped to PG-13 after successful appeals (albeit &quot;Bully&quot; needed some cuts). &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;, however, was given an R rating for one scene using the word &quot;fuck&quot; several times in a speech therapy context; the MPAA refused to recertify the film on appeal, despite the British Board of Film Classification reducing the British rating from a 15 rating to a 12A on the grounds that the uses of the expletive were not directed at anyone.

This was satirized in the 2005 film &quot;Be Cool&quot;, in which the film producer Chili Palmer (John Travolta) says: &quot;Do you know that unless you&#x27;re willing to use the R rating, you can only say the &#x27;F&#x27; word once? You know what I say? Fuck that. I&#x27;m done.&quot; Often film producers will use the word for a scene of gravitas or humor and then bleep out any further instances with sound effects.

Some forms of media are cut post-release so as to obtain a PG-13 rating for home media release or to feature on an Internet streaming service that will not carry films rated higher than PG-13. In 2020, a recording of &quot;Hamilton&quot; was released on Disney+ after cuts by Lin-Manuel Miranda to remove two of the three instances of &quot;fuck&quot; in the musical to qualify it as PG-13 under MPAA guidelines.

A study of popular American teen-oriented films rated PG and PG-13 from 1980 to 2006 found that in those films, teenaged characters use more and stronger profanity than adult ones in the same movies. However, the study found that the overall amount of such language had declined somewhat since the 1980s.

=== Substances ===

Drug use content is restricted to PG-13 and above. An example of an otherwise PG film being assigned a PG-13 rating for a drug reference (momentary, along with brief language) is &quot;Whale Rider&quot;. The film contained only mild profanity, but was rated PG-13 because of a scene where drug paraphernalia were briefly visible. Critic Roger Ebert criticized the MPAA for the rating and called it &quot;a wild overreaction&quot;.

In May 2007, the MPAA announced that depictions of cigarette smoking would be considered in a film&#x27;s rating. Anti-smoking advocates stated that the child-friendly PG rating was inappropriate for the 2011 Nickelodeon-animated film &quot;Rango&quot;, which included over 60 depictions of characters smoking.

=== Nudity ===
Nudity is restricted to PG and above, and anything that constitutes more than brief nudity will require at least a PG-13 rating. Nudity that is sexually oriented will generally require an R rating. Since 2006, films have been flagged by the MPAA for carrying nudity. In 2010, the MPAA flagged three films specifically for &quot;male nudity&quot;, precipitated by parental pressure in response to &quot;Brüno&quot;. In 2018, MPAA Ratings Chair Joan Graves clarified the MPA&#x27;s position by stating that &quot;we don&#x27;t usually define [nudity] as male or female ... usually, we just mention partial nudity, [or] graphic nudity.&quot;

=== Sex ===
The MPAA does not have any explicit criteria for sexual content other than excluding sex scenes from G-rated films.

== Effects of ratings ==
=== &quot;The Exorcist&quot; ===

Prior to the release of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; at the end of 1973, CARA president Aaron Stern took the unusual step of calling director William Friedkin to tell him that since it was an &quot;important film&quot;, it would be rated R and could be released without any cuts. The film drew huge crowds upon its release, many of whom were so horrified by the film they vomited and/or fainted; a psychiatric journal would later document four cases of &quot;cinematic neurosis&quot; induced by the film.

Among those patrons were many children, not always accompanied by adults. This left many commentators incredulous that the ratings board would have found that a film with disturbing scenes such as a possessed 12-year-old girl masturbating with a crucifix was acceptable for children to see. Roy Meacham, a Washington, D.C., critic who had praised the film while admonishing parents not to take their children to it, recalled those children he did see leaving showings &quot;drained and drawn afterward; their eyes had a look I had never seen before.&quot; Authorities in Washington invoked a municipal ordinance that would have prevented &quot;any&quot; minors from seeing the film, threatening theater owners with arrest if they did.

Meacham insinuated that the board had succumbed to pressure from Warner Brothers, which had spent $10 million, more than twice its original budget, making the film; an X rating would have seriously limited &quot;The Exorcist&quot;″s commercial prospects. &quot;New Yorker&quot; critic Pauline Kael echoed his criticism. &quot;If &quot;The Exorcist&quot; had cost under a million or been made abroad,&quot; she wrote, &quot;it would almost certainly be an X film. But when a movie is as expensive as this one, the [board] doesn&#x27;t dare give it an X.&quot;

In 1974, Richard Heffner took over as president of the board. During his interview process, he had asked to screen recent films that had sparked ratings controversies, including &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. &quot;How could anything be worse than this?&quot; he recalled thinking later. &quot;And it got an R?&quot; After he took over as head, he would spearhead efforts to be more aggressive with the X rating, especially over violence in films. In 1976, he got the board to give the Japanese martial arts film &quot;The Street Fighter&quot; an X rating for its graphic violence, the first time a film had earned that rating purely for violence.

=== Commercial viability of the NC-17 rating ===
The NC-17 rating has been described as a &quot;kiss of death&quot; for any film that receives it. Like the X rating it replaced, NC-17 limits a film&#x27;s prospects of being marketed, screened in theaters and sold in major video outlets. In 1995, MGM/UA released the big-budget film &quot;Showgirls&quot;; it became the most widely distributed film with an NC-17 rating (showing in 1,388 cinemas simultaneously), but it was a box office failure that grossed only 45% of its $45 million budget. Some modest successes can be found among NC-17 theatrical releases, however; Fox Searchlight Pictures released the original NC-17-rated American edition of the European film &quot;The Dreamers&quot; (2003) in theaters in the United States, and later released both the original NC-17 and the cut R-rated version on DVD. A Fox Searchlight spokesman said the NC-17 rating did not give them much trouble in releasing this film (they had no problem booking it, and only the Salt Lake City newspaper &quot;Deseret News&quot; refused to take the film&#x27;s ad), and Fox Searchlight was satisfied with this film&#x27;s United States box office result. Another notable exception is &quot;Bad Education&quot; (2004), an NC-17 foreign-language film that grossed $5.2 million in the United States theatrically (a moderate success for a foreign-language film).

In 2000, the Directors Guild of America called the NC-17 rating an &quot;abject failure&quot;, for causing filmmakers to re-edit films to receive an R rating, rather than accept an NC-17 rating. They argued that this was &quot;not only compromising filmmakers&#x27; visions, but also greatly increasing the likelihood that adult-oriented movies are seen by the very groups for which they are not intended.&quot; As of March 2007, according to &quot;Variety&quot;, MPAA chairman Dan Glickman had been made aware of the attempts to introduce a new rating, or find ways to reduce the stigma of the NC-17 rating. Film studios have pressured the MPAA to retire the NC-17 rating, because of its likely impact on their film&#x27;s box office revenue.

In 2010, the MPAA controversially decided to give the film &quot;Blue Valentine&quot; an NC-17 rating. The Weinstein Company challenged this decision, and the MPAA ended up awarding the same cut an R rating on appeal. Actor Ryan Gosling, who stars in the film, noted that NC-17 films are not allowed wide advertisement and that, given the refusal of major cinema chains like AMC and Regal to show NC-17 rated movies, many such films will never be accessible to people who live in markets that do not have art house theatres.

Legal scholar Julie Hilden wrote that the MPAA has a &quot;masterpiece exception&quot; that it has made for films that would ordinarily earn an NC-17 rating, if not for the broader artistic masterpiece that requires the violence depicted as a part of its message. She cites &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, with its bloody depiction of the D-Day landings, as an example. This exception is troubling, Hilden argues, because it ignores context and perspective in evaluating other films and favors conventional films over edgier films that contribute newer and more interesting points to public discourse about violence.

=== Issuance of &quot;R Cards&quot; ===
Starting in 2004, GKC Theatres (since absorbed into AMC Theatres) introduced &quot;R Cards&quot;, which parents could obtain for their children under 17 to see R-rated films without adult accompaniment. The cards generated much controversy; MPAA president Jack Valenti said in a news article: &quot;I think it distorts and ruptures the intent of this voluntary film ratings system. All R-rated films are not alike.&quot; John Fithian, the president of the National Association of Theatre Owners, also said that the cards can be harmful. He noted in a news article for the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; that the R rating is &quot;broad enough to include relatively family-friendly fare such as &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; and &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; (which were both rated R for language) along with films that push the extremes of violence, including &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill&quot;&quot;.

== Criticisms ==
=== Emphasis on sex and language versus violence ===
The film rating system has had a number of high-profile critics. Film critic Roger Ebert called for replacing the NC-17 rating with separate ratings for pornographic and non-pornographic adult film. Ebert argued that the system places too much emphasis on sex, while allowing the portrayal of massive amounts of gruesome violence. The uneven emphasis on sex versus violence is echoed by other critics, including David Ansen, as well as many filmmakers. Moreover, Ebert argued that the rating system is geared toward looking at trivial aspects of the film (such as the number of times a profane word is used) rather than at the general theme of the film (for example, if the film realistically depicts the consequences of sex and violence). He called for an A (adults only) rating, to indicate films high in violence or mature content that should not be marketed to teenagers, but do not have NC-17 levels of sex. He also called for the NC-17 rating to be removed and to have the X rating revived. He felt that everyone understood what X-rated means, while fewer people understood what NC-17 meant.

MPAA chairman Dan Glickman has disputed these claims, stating that far more films are initially rated NC-17 for violence than for sex, but that these are later edited by studios to receive an R rating.

Despite this, an internal critic of the early workings of the ratings system is film critic and writer Stephen Farber, who was a CARA intern for six months during 1969 and 1970. In &quot;The Movie Ratings Game&quot;, he documents a prejudice against sex in relation to violence. The 2006 documentary &quot;This Film Is Not Yet Rated&quot; also points out that four times as many films received an NC-17 rating for sex as they did for violence according to the MPAA&#x27;s own website, further mentioning a bias against homosexual content compared to heterosexual content, particularly with regards to sex scenes. Filmmaker Darren Stein further insists that his tame teen comedy &quot;G.B.F.&quot;, which features multiple same-sex kisses but no intercourse, strong language, violence, or nudity, was &quot;rated R for being gay.&quot;

The 2011 documentary &quot;Bully&quot; received an R rating for the profanity contained within the film, which prevented most of the intended audience, middle and high schoolers, from seeing the film. The film&#x27;s director, Lee Hirsch, has refused to recut the film, stating, &quot;I feel a responsibility as a filmmaker, as the person entrusted to tell (these kids&#x27;) stories, to not water them down.&quot; A petition collected more than 200,000 signatures to change the film&#x27;s rating and a version with less profanity was finally given a PG-13 rating. The same, however, could not be said about the 1995 teen drama &quot;Kids&quot;, which director Larry Clark wanted rated R so parents could take their kids to it for educational purposes, but the MPAA rated it NC-17 due to its content of teen sex and turned down Clark&#x27;s appeal. The film was then released unrated by Miramax (under Shining Excalibur Films because Miramax, formerly owned by Disney, hesitated to release it as an NC-17 film).

=== Inconsistent standards for independent studios ===
Many critics of the MPA rating system, especially independent distributors, have charged that major studios&#x27; releases often receive more lenient treatment than independent films.

The independent film &quot;Saints and Soldiers&quot;, which contains no nudity, almost no sex (although there is a scene in which a German soldier is about to rape a French woman), very little profanity, and a minimum of violence, was said to have been rated R for a single clip where a main character is shot and killed, and required modification of just that one scene to receive a PG-13 rating. Eric Watson, producer of the independently distributed &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; (initially rated NC-17 before having its rating surrendered and released unrated) complained that the studios are paying the budget of the MPAA, which gives the studios leverage over the MPAA&#x27;s decisions.

The comedy &quot;Scary Movie&quot;, released by Dimension Films, at the time a division of The Walt Disney Company, contained &quot;strong crude sexual humor, language, drug use and violence,&quot; including images of ejaculation, fellatio and an erect penis, but was rated R, to the surprise of many reviewers and audiences; by comparison, the comparatively tame porn spoof &quot;Orgazmo&quot;, an independent release by &quot;South Park&quot; creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker and distributed by October Films (since absorbed into Focus Features), contained &quot;explicit sexual content and dialogue&quot; and received an NC-17 (the only on-screen penis seen in the film is a dildo). Parker and Stone did not have the time and money to edit the film, so it retained its NC-17 rating, the duo later stated that the MPAA refused to note specific scenes to remove and theorized that the organization cared less because it was an independent release which would bring it significantly less money. In contrast, Parker and Stone&#x27;s following feature film, &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;, was distributed by a major studio (Paramount Pictures) and, after multiple submissions and notes from the MPAA, received an R rating.

=== Inconsistent standards between G and PG ===
Disney&#x27;s 1996 adaptation of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; has been criticized for its depiction of lust, antiziganism, and genocide, despite being rated G. Twenty-five years after its release, one of the screenwriters for the film, Tab Murphy, talked about its rating in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, saying, &quot;That&#x27;s the most R-rated G you will ever see in your life.&quot; Pixar&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;Cars 2&quot; has been criticized similarly for featuring on-screen gun violence and a torture scene despite being rated G. In contrast, critics of the system accuse the ratings board of giving PG ratings to family-friendly films such as &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;Finding Dory&quot; for no reason.

=== Call for publicizing the standards ===
Many critics of the system, both conservative and liberal, would like to see the MPAA ratings unveiled and the standards made public. The MPAA has consistently cited nationwide scientific polls (conducted each year by the Opinion Research Corporation of Princeton, New Jersey), which show that parents find the ratings useful. Critics such as Matt Stone in Kirby Dick&#x27;s documentary &quot;This Film Is Not Yet Rated&quot; respond this proves only that parents find the ratings more useful than nothing at all. In the film, it is also discussed how the MPAA will not reveal any information about how or why certain decisions are made, and that the association will not even reveal to the filmmaker the specific scenes that need to be cut in order to get an alternative rating.

=== Accusation of &quot;ratings creep&quot; ===
Although there has always been concern about the content of films, the MPAA has been accused of a &quot;ratings creep&quot;, whereby the films that fell into specific ratings categories in 2010 contained more objectionable material than those that appeared in the same categories two decades earlier. A study put forward by the Harvard School of Public Health in 2004 concluded that there had been a significant increase in the level of profanity, sex and violence in films released between 1992 and 2003. Kimberly Thompson, director of the study, stated: &quot;The findings demonstrate that ratings creep has occurred over the last decade and that today&#x27;s movies contain significantly more violence, sex, and profanity on average than movies of the same rating a decade ago.&quot;

=== Questions of relevance ===
In 2010 &quot;Slashfilm&quot; managing editor David Chen wrote on the website: &quot;It&#x27;s time for more people to condemn the MPAA and their outrageous antics. We&#x27;re heading towards an age when we don&#x27;t need a mommy-like organization to dictate what our delicate sensibilities can and can&#x27;t be exposed to. I deeply hope that the MPAA&#x27;s irrelevance is imminent.&quot;

&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; film critic Michael Phillips wrote in 2010 that the MPAA ratings board &quot;has become foolish and irrelevant, and its members do not have my interests at heart, or yours. They&#x27;re too easy on violence yet bizarrely reactionary when it comes to nudity and language.&quot;

<text>The Huguenots ( , ; ) are a religious group of French Protestants who held to the Reformed (Calvinist) tradition of Protestantism. The term, which may be derived from the name of a Swiss political leader, the Genevan burgomaster Besançon Hugues (1491–1532), was in common use by the mid-16th century. &quot;Huguenot&quot; was frequently used in reference to those of the Reformed Church of France from the time of the Protestant Reformation. By contrast, the Protestant populations of eastern France, in Alsace, Moselle, and Montbéliard, were mainly Lutherans.

In his &quot;Encyclopedia of Protestantism&quot;, Hans Hillerbrand wrote that on the eve of the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre in 1572, the Huguenot community made up as much as 10% of the French population. By 1600, it had declined to 7–8%, and was reduced further late in the century after the return of persecution under Louis XIV, who instituted the &quot;dragonnades&quot; to forcibly convert Protestants, and then finally revoked all Protestant rights in his Edict of Fontainebleau of 1685. In 1686, the Protestant population sat at 1% of the population.

The Huguenots were concentrated in the southern and western parts of the Kingdom of France. As Huguenots gained influence and more openly displayed their faith, Catholic hostility grew. A series of religious conflicts followed, known as the French Wars of Religion, fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598. The Huguenots were led by Jeanne d&#x27;Albret; her son, the future Henry IV (who would later convert to Catholicism in order to become king); and the princes of Condé. The wars ended with the Edict of Nantes of 1598, which granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy.

Huguenot rebellions in the 1620s resulted in the abolition of their political and military privileges. They retained the religious provisions of the Edict of Nantes until the rule of Louis XIV, who gradually increased persecution of Protestantism until he issued the Edict of Fontainebleau (1685). This ended legal recognition of Protestantism in France and the Huguenots were forced to either convert to Catholicism (possibly as Nicodemites) or flee as refugees; they were subject to violent dragonnades. Louis XIV claimed that the French Huguenot population was reduced from about 900,000 or 800,000 adherents to just 1,000 or 1,500. He exaggerated the decline, but the dragonnades were devastating for the French Protestant community. The exodus of Huguenots from France created a brain drain, as many of them had occupied important places in society.

The remaining Huguenots faced continued persecution under Louis XV. By the time of his death in 1774, Calvinism had been all but eliminated from France. Persecution of Protestants officially ended with the Edict of Versailles, signed by Louis XVI in 1787. Two years later, with the Revolutionary Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789, Protestants gained equal rights as citizens.

==Etymology==

A term used originally in derision, &quot;Huguenot&quot; has unclear origins. Various hypotheses have been promoted. The term may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time. It used a derogatory pun on the name by way of the Dutch word (literally &#x27;housemates&#x27;), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German (&#x27;Confederate&#x27; in the sense of &#x27;a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy&#x27;).

Geneva was John Calvin&#x27;s adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the &quot;Confederate Party&quot;, so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy. It sought an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label &quot;Huguenot&quot; was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) who were involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential and zealously Catholic House of Guise. This action would have fostered relations with the Swiss.

O. I. A. Roche promoted this idea among historians. He wrote in his book, &quot;The Days of the Upright, A History of the Huguenots&quot; (1965), that &quot;Huguenot&quot; is:

a combination of a Dutch and a German word. In the Dutch-speaking North of France, Bible students who gathered in each other&#x27;s houses to study secretly were called (&quot;housemates&quot;) while on the Swiss and German borders they were termed , or &quot;oath fellows&quot;, that is, persons bound to each other by an oath. Gallicised into , often used deprecatingly, the word became, during two and a half centuries of terror and triumph, a badge of enduring honour and courage.

Some disagree with such non-French linguistic origins. Janet Gray argues that for the word to have spread into common use in France, it must have originated there in French. The &quot;Hugues hypothesis&quot; argues that the name was derived by association with Hugues Capet, king of France, who reigned long before the Reformation. He was regarded by the Gallicians as a noble man who respected people&#x27;s dignity and lives. Janet Gray and other supporters of the hypothesis suggest that the name would be roughly equivalent to &#x27;little Hugos&#x27;, or &#x27;those who want Hugo&#x27;.

Paul Ristelhuber, in his 1879 introduction to a new edition of the controversial and censored, but popular 1566 work &quot;Apologie pour Hérodote&quot;, by Henri Estienne, mentions these theories and opinions, but tends to support a completely Catholic origin. As one legend holds, a gateway area in the streets of Tours was haunted by the ghosts of (a generic term for these spirits), &quot;because they were wont to assemble near the gate named after Hugon, a Count of Tours in ancient times, who had left a record of evil deeds and had become in popular fancy a sort of sinister and maleficent genius. This count may have been Hugh of Tours, who was disliked for his cowardice. Additionally, it is related, that, it was believed, (that of these spirits) instead of spending their time in Purgatory, came back to rattle doors and haunt and harm people at night. Protestants went out at nights to their lascivious conventicles, and so the priests and the people began to call them Huguenots in Tours and then elsewhere.&quot; The name, Huguenot, &quot;the people applied in hatred and derision to those who were elsewhere called Lutherans, and from Touraine it spread throughout France.&quot; The (&#x27;supposedly reformed&#x27;) were said to gather at night at Tours, both for political purposes, and for prayer and singing psalms. Reguier de la Plancha (d. 1560) in his offered the following account as to the origin of the name, as cited by &quot;The Cape Monthly&quot;:

Reguier de la Plancha accounts for it [the name] as follows: &quot;The name was given to those of the religion during the affair of Amboyse, and they were to retain it ever since. I&#x27;ll say a word about it to settle the doubts of those who have strayed in seeking its origin. The superstition of our ancestors, to within twenty or thirty years thereabouts, was such that in almost all the towns in the kingdom they had a notion that certain spirits underwent their Purgatory in this world after death, and that they went about the town at night, striking and outraging many people whom they found in the streets. But the light of the Gospel has made them vanish, and teaches us that these spirits were street-strollers and ruffians. In Paris the spirit was called ; at Orléans, ; at Blois ; at Tours, ; and so on in other places. Now, it happens that those whom they called Lutherans were at that time so narrowly watched during the day that they were forced to wait till night to assemble, for the purpose of praying God, for preaching and receiving the Holy Sacrament; so that although they did not frighten nor hurt anybody, the priests, through mockery, made them the successors of those spirits which roam the night; and thus that name being quite common in the mouth of the populace, to designate the evangelical in the country of Tourraine and Amboyse, it became in vogue after that enterprise.&quot;

Some have suggested the name was derived, with intended scorn, from (the &#x27;monkeys&#x27; or &#x27;apes of Jan Hus&#x27;). By 1911, there was still no consensus in the United States on this interpretation.

==Symbol==

The Huguenot cross is the distinctive emblem of the Huguenots (). It is now an official symbol of the (French Protestant church). Huguenot descendants sometimes display this symbol as a sign of (recognition) between them.

==Demographics==

The issue of demographic strength and geographical spread of the Reformed tradition in France has been covered in a variety of sources. Most of them agree that the Huguenot population reached as many as 10% of the total population, or roughly 2 million people, on the eve of the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre in 1572.

===Links to nobility===
The new teaching of John Calvin attracted sizeable portions of the nobility and urban bourgeoisie. After John Calvin introduced the Reformation in France, the number of French Protestants steadily swelled to ten percent of the population, or roughly 1.8 million people, in the decade between 1560 and 1570. During the same period there were some 1,400 Reformed churches operating in France. Hans J. Hillerbrand, an expert on the subject, in his &quot;Encyclopedia of Protestantism: 4-volume Set&quot; claims the Huguenot community reached as much as 10% of the French population on the eve of the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre, declining to 7 to 8% by the end of the 16th century, and further after heavy persecution began once again with the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV in 1685. Among the nobles, Calvinism peaked on the eve of the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre. Since then, it sharply decreased as the Huguenots were no longer tolerated by both the French royalty and the Catholic masses. By the end of the sixteenth century, Huguenots constituted 7–8% of the whole population, or 1.2 million people. By the time Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Huguenots accounted for 800,000 to 1 million people.

Huguenots controlled sizeable areas in southern and western France. In addition, many areas, especially in the central part of the country, were also contested between the French Reformed and Catholic nobles. Demographically, there were some areas in which the whole populations had been Reformed. These included villages in and around the Massif Central, as well as the area around Dordogne, which used to be almost entirely Reformed too. John Calvin was a Frenchman and himself largely responsible for the introduction and spread of the Reformed tradition in France. He wrote in French, but unlike the Protestant development in Germany, where Lutheran writings were widely distributed and could be read by the common man, it was not the case in France, where only nobles adopted the new faith and the folk remained Catholic. This is true for many areas in the west and south controlled by the Huguenot nobility. Although relatively large portions of the peasant population became Reformed there, the people, altogether, still remained majority Catholic.

Overall, Huguenot presence was heavily concentrated in the western and southern portions of the French kingdom, as nobles there secured practise of the new faith. These included Languedoc-Roussillon, Gascony and even a strip of land that stretched into the Dauphiné. Huguenots lived on the Atlantic coast in La Rochelle, and also spread across provinces of Normandy and Poitou. In the south, towns like Castres, Montauban, Montpellier and Nîmes were Huguenot strongholds. In addition, a dense network of Protestant villages permeated the rural mountainous region of the Cevennes. Inhabited by Camisards, it continues to be the backbone of French Protestantism. Historians estimate that roughly 80% of all Huguenots lived in the western and southern areas of France.

Today, there are some Reformed communities around the world that still retain their Huguenot identity. In France, Calvinists in the United Protestant Church of France and also some in the Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine consider themselves Huguenots. A rural Huguenot community in the Cevennes that rebelled in 1702 is still called &quot;Camisards&quot;, especially in historical contexts. Huguenot exiles in the United Kingdom, the United States, South Africa, Australia, and a number of other countries still retain their identity.

==Emigration and diaspora==
As a final destination, most of the Huguenot émigrés moved to Protestant states such as the Dutch Republic, England and Wales (prominently in Kent and London), Protestant-controlled Ireland, the Channel Islands, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, the electorates of Brandenburg and the Palatinate in the Holy Roman Empire, and the Duchy of Prussia. Some fled as refugees to the Dutch Cape Colony, the Dutch East Indies, various Caribbean colonies, and several of the Dutch and English colonies in North America. A few families went to Orthodox Russia and Catholic Quebec.

After centuries, most Huguenots assimilated into the various societies and cultures where they have settled. Remnant communities of Camisards in the Cévennes, most Reformed members of the United Protestant Church of France, French members of the largely German Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine, and the Huguenot diaspora in England and Australia, all still retain their beliefs and Huguenot designation.


==History==
===Origins===

The availability of the Bible in vernacular languages was important to the spread of the Protestant movement and development of the Reformed Church in France. The country had a long history of struggles with the papacy (see the Avignon Papacy, for example) by the time the Protestant Reformation finally arrived. Around 1294, a French version of the scriptures was prepared by the Roman Catholic priest, Guyard des Moulins. A two-volume illustrated folio paraphrase version based on his manuscript, by Jean de Rély, was printed in Paris in 1487.

The first known translation of the Bible into one of France&#x27;s regional languages, Arpitan or Franco-Provençal, had been prepared by the 12th-century pre-Protestant reformer Peter Waldo (Pierre de Vaux). The Waldensians created fortified areas, as in Cabrières, perhaps attacking an abbey. They were suppressed by Francis I in 1545 in the Massacre of Mérindol.

Other predecessors of the Reformed church included the pro-reform and Gallican Roman Catholics, such as Jacques Lefevre (c. 1455–1536). The Gallicans briefly achieved independence for the French church, on the principle that the religion of France could not be controlled by the Bishop of Rome, a foreign power. During the Protestant Reformation, Lefevre, a professor at the University of Paris, published his French translation of the New Testament in 1523, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530. William Farel was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the Swiss Reformation, establishing a Protestant republican government in Geneva. Jean Cauvin (John Calvin), another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism. Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I, the remaining French Waldensians, then mostly in the Luberon region, sought to join Farel, Calvin and the Reformation, and Olivétan published a French Bible for them. The French Confession of 1559 shows a decidedly Calvinistic influence.

Although usually Huguenots are lumped into one group, there were actually two types of Huguenots that emerged. Since the Huguenots had political and religious goals, it was commonplace to refer to the Calvinists as &quot;Huguenots of religion&quot; and those who opposed the monarchy as &quot;Huguenots of the state&quot;, who were mostly nobles.
* The Huguenots of religion were influenced by John Calvin&#x27;s works and established Calvinist synods. They were determined to end religious oppression.
* The Huguenots of the state opposed the monopoly of power the Guise family had and wanted to attack the authority of the crown. This group of Huguenots from southern France had frequent issues with the strict Calvinist tenets that are outlined in many of John Calvin&#x27;s letters to the synods of the Languedoc.

===Reformation and growth===
Early in his reign, Francis I () persecuted the old, pre-Protestant movement of Waldensians in southeastern France. Francis initially protected the Huguenot dissidents from Parlementary measures seeking to exterminate them. After the 1534 Affair of the Placards, however, he distanced himself from Huguenots and their protection.

Huguenot numbers grew rapidly between 1555 and 1561, chiefly amongst nobles and city dwellers. During this time, their opponents first dubbed the Protestants &quot;Huguenots&quot;; but they called themselves , or &quot;Reformed&quot;. They organised their first national synod in 1558 in Paris.

By 1562, the estimated number of Huguenots peaked at approximately two million, concentrated mainly in the western, southern, and some central parts of France, compared to approximately sixteen million Catholics during the same period. Persecution diminished the number of Huguenots who remained in France.

===Wars of religion===

As the Huguenots gained influence and displayed their faith more openly, Roman Catholic hostility towards them grew, even though the French crown offered increasingly liberal political concessions and edicts of toleration.

Following the accidental death of Henry II in 1559, his son succeeded as King Francis II along with his wife, the Queen Consort, also known as Mary, Queen of Scots. During the eighteen months of the reign of Francis II, Mary encouraged a policy of rounding up French Huguenots on charges of heresy and putting them in front of Catholic judges, and employing torture and burning as punishments for dissenters. Mary returned to Scotland a widow, in the summer of 1561.

In 1561, the Edict of Orléans declared an end to the persecution, and the Edict of Saint-Germain of January 1562 formally recognised the Huguenots for the first time. However, these measures disguised the growing tensions between Protestants and Catholics.

===Civil wars===

These tensions spurred eight civil wars, interrupted by periods of relative calm, between 1562 and 1598. With each break in peace, the Huguenots&#x27; trust in the Catholic throne diminished, and the violence became more severe, and Protestant demands became grander, until a lasting cessation of open hostility finally occurred in 1598. The wars gradually took on a dynastic character, developing into an extended feud between the Houses of Bourbon and Guise, both of which—in addition to holding rival religious views—staked a claim to the French throne. The crown, occupied by the House of Valois, generally supported the Catholic side, but on occasion switched over to the Protestant cause when politically expedient.
The French Wars of Religion began with the Massacre of Vassy on 1 March 1562, when dozens (some sources say hundreds) of Huguenots were killed, and about 200 were wounded. It was in this year that some Huguenots destroyed the tomb and remains of Saint Irenaeus (d. 202), an early Church father and bishop who was a disciple of Polycarp. The Michelade by Huguenotes against Catholics was later on 29 September 1567.

===St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre===
In what became known as the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre of 24 August – 3 October 1572, Catholics killed thousands of Huguenots in Paris and similar massacres took place in other towns in the following weeks. The main provincial towns and cities experiencing massacres were Aix, Bordeaux, Bourges, Lyons, Meaux, Orléans, Rouen, Toulouse, and Troyes.

Although the exact number of fatalities throughout the country is not known, on 23–24 August, between 2,000 and 3,000 Protestants were killed in Paris and a further 3,000 to 7,000 more in the French provinces. By 17 September, almost 25,000 Protestants had been massacred in Paris alone. Beyond Paris, the killings continued until 3 October. An amnesty granted in 1573 pardoned the perpetrators. Following the killings many Protestants fled to the Kentish coast among other places.

===Edict of Nantes===
The pattern of warfare, followed by brief periods of peace, continued for nearly another quarter-century. The warfare was definitively quelled in 1598, when Henry of Navarre, having succeeded to the French throne as Henry IV, and having recanted Protestantism in favour of Roman Catholicism in order to obtain the French crown, issued the Edict of Nantes. The Edict reaffirmed Roman Catholicism as the state religion of France, but granted the Protestants equality with Catholics under the throne and a degree of religious and political freedom within their domains. The Edict simultaneously protected Catholic interests by discouraging the founding of new Protestant churches in Catholic-controlled regions.

With the proclamation of the Edict of Nantes, and the subsequent protection of Huguenot rights, pressures to leave France abated. However, enforcement of the Edict grew increasingly irregular over time, making life so intolerable that many fled the country. The Huguenot population of France dropped to 856,000 by the mid-1660s, of which a plurality lived in rural areas. The greatest concentrations of Huguenots at this time resided in the regions of Guienne, Saintonge-Aunis-Angoumois and Poitou.

Montpellier was among the most important of the 66 (&#x27;cities of protection&#x27; or &#x27;protected cities&#x27;) that the Edict of 1598 granted to the Huguenots. The city&#x27;s political institutions and the university were all handed over to the Huguenots. Tension with Paris led to a siege by the royal army in 1622. Peace terms called for the dismantling of the city&#x27;s fortifications. A royal citadel was built and the university and consulate were taken over by the Catholic party. Even before the Edict of Alès (1629), Protestant rule was dead and the was no more.
By 1620, the Huguenots were on the defensive, and the government increasingly applied pressure. A series of three small civil wars known as the Huguenot rebellions broke out, mainly in southwestern France, between 1621 and 1629 in which the Reformed areas revolted against royal authority. The uprising occurred a decade following the death of Henry IV, who was assassinated by a Catholic fanatic in 1610. His successor Louis XIII, under the regency of his Italian Catholic mother Marie de&#x27; Medici, was more intolerant of Protestantism. The Huguenots responded by establishing independent political and military structures, establishing diplomatic contacts with foreign powers, and openly revolting against central power. The rebellions were implacably suppressed by the French crown.

===Edict of Fontainebleau===
Louis XIV inherited the throne in 1643 and acted increasingly aggressively to force the Huguenots to convert. At first he sent missionaries, backed by a fund to financially reward converts to Roman Catholicism. Then he imposed penalties, closed Huguenot schools and excluded them from favoured professions. Escalating, he instituted dragonnades, which included the occupation and looting of Huguenot homes by military troops, in an effort to forcibly convert them. In 1685, he issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, revoking the Edict of Nantes and declaring Protestantism illegal.

The revocation forbade Protestant services, required education of children as Catholics, and prohibited emigration. It proved disastrous to the Huguenots and costly for France. It precipitated civil bloodshed, ruined commerce, and resulted in the illegal flight from the country of hundreds of thousands of Protestants, many of whom were intellectuals, doctors and business leaders whose skills were transferred to Britain as well as Holland, Switzerland, Prussia, South Africa and other places they fled to. 4,000 emigrated to the Thirteen Colonies, where they settled, especially in New York, the Delaware River Valley in Eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Virginia. The English authorities welcomed the French refugees, providing money from both government and private agencies to aid their relocation. Those Huguenots who stayed in France were subsequently forcibly converted to Roman Catholicism and were called &quot;new converts&quot;.

After this, the Huguenots (with estimates ranging from 200,000 to 1,000,000) fled to Protestant countries: England, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, and Prussia—whose Calvinist Great Elector Frederick William welcomed them to help rebuild his war-ravaged and underpopulated country. Following this exodus, Huguenots remained in large numbers in only one region of France: the rugged Cévennes region in the south. There were also some Calvinists in the Alsace region, which then belonged to the Holy Roman Empire. In the early 18th century, a regional group known as the Camisards (who were Huguenots of the mountainous Massif Central region) rioted against the Catholic Church, burning churches and killing the clergy. It took French troops years to hunt down and destroy all the bands of Camisards, between 1702 and 1709.

===End of persecution===
By the 1760s Protestantism was no longer a favourite religion of the elite. By then, most Protestants were Cévennes peasants. It was still illegal, and, although the law was seldom enforced, it could be a threat or a nuisance to Protestants. Calvinists lived primarily in the Midi; about 200,000 Lutherans accompanied by some Calvinists lived in the newly acquired Alsace, where the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia effectively protected them.

Persecution of Protestants diminished in France after 1724, finally ending with the Edict of Versailles, commonly called the Edict of Tolerance, signed by Louis XVI in 1787. Two years later, with the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789, Protestants gained equal rights as citizens.

=== Right of return to France in the 19th and 20th centuries ===
The government encouraged descendants of exiles to return, offering them French citizenship in a 15 December 1790 law:

All persons born in a foreign country and descending in any degree of a French man or woman expatriated for religious reason are declared French nationals () and will benefit from rights attached to that quality if they come back to France, establish their domicile there and take the civic oath.

Article 4 of 26 June 1889 Nationality Law stated: &quot;Descendants of families proscribed by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes will continue to benefit from the benefit of 15 December 1790 Law, but on the condition that a nominal decree should be issued for every petitioner. That decree will only produce its effects for the future.&quot;

Foreign descendants of Huguenots lost the automatic right to French citizenship in 1945 (by force of the , which revoked the 1889 Nationality Law). It states in article 3: &quot;This application does not, however, affect the validity of past acts by the person or rights acquired by third parties on the basis of previous laws.&quot;

===Modern times===
In the 1920s and 1930s, members of the extreme-right movement expressed strong animus against Huguenots and other Protestants in general, as well as against Jews and Freemasons. They were regarded as groups supporting the French Republic, which sought to overthrow.

In World War II, Huguenots led by in the village of in helped save many Jews. They hid them in secret places or helped them get out of Vichy France. André Trocmé preached against discrimination as the Nazis were gaining power in neighbouring Germany and urged his Protestant Huguenot congregation to hide Jewish refugees from the Holocaust.

In the early 21st century, there were approximately one million Protestants in France, representing some 2% of its population. Most are concentrated in Alsace in northeast France and the mountain region in the south, who still regard themselves as Huguenots to this day. Surveys suggest that Protestantism has grown in recent years, though this is due primarily to the expansion of evangelical Protestant churches which particularly have adherents among immigrant groups that are generally considered distinct from the French Huguenot population.

A diaspora of French Australians still considers itself Huguenot, even after centuries of exile. Long integrated into Australian society, it is encouraged by the Huguenot Society of Australia to embrace and conserve its cultural heritage, aided by the Society&#x27;s genealogical research services.

In the United States there are several Huguenot worship groups and societies. The Huguenot Society of America has headquarters in New York City and has a broad national membership. One of the most active Huguenot groups is in Charleston, South Carolina. While many American Huguenot groups worship in borrowed churches, the congregation in Charleston has its own church. Although services are conducted largely in English, every year the church holds an Annual French Service, which is conducted entirely in French using an adaptation of the Liturgies of Neufchatel (1737) and Vallangin (1772). Typically the Annual French Service takes place on the first or second Sunday after Easter in commemoration of the signing of the Edict of Nantes.

==Exodus==
===The trip===
French protestants reacted differently to persecution and the ban of Protestantism. Some converted to the Catholic faith, while others decided to leave. Some leave their elderly parents or children that are too young to travel. Those who left were from every social class and every profession including lawyers, merchants and officers. They came from all over France. The only common denominator was that they were Protestants, would not convert to Catholicism and were willing to risk it all to practice their religion freely. Those who leave, leave everything including land to be confiscated unless a family who converted to Catholicism inherits and pays the refugees. This last scenario happens very rarely.

40% of the protestants from the Northern part of France leave while 25% of the south do the same. Those closer to the border (both land and sea) as well as where they are a minority in the population of the area leave more: it is the case in the Paris area, Normandie and the Atlantic coast. Farmers often stay attached to the land while craftsman and merchants represent a large group of those who leave. Some temporarily convert to Catholicism to sell their property before leaving. Others leave over-night.

Those who leave must rely on guides who know the routes out of France. Most were honest but some sold out their customers to the authorities. Paying for those guides was expensive as they risked being sent to the galley until 1687 and later hanging. They traveled by night and often disguised. Often, the Huguenots purchased paper guides at a very high price. These guides told the reader which cities to go to, where to avoid, who to contact, etc.

For many, the trip out of the country happens by sea leaving from Bordeaux, La Rochelle, the Île de Ré, Nantes and other ports along the coast on board English and Dutch ships after they had made their way to the coast using what was available and what could be afforded. Others went by land to the Dutch Republic or Switzerland. Many walk hundreds of miles. The borders with other countries are well guarded, as well as the border between provencies within France and the risk of arrest is a constant fear until they arrive safely. On the way they encounter honest people who help them as well as some who will sell them out or steal their money. Help comes from Protestants and Catholics. The fugitives sometimes must lie about their identity. Entire networks exist to escort them across France and to a safe country. Some fugitives are arrested on the way. For those who make it, they often arrive tired, starving, with nothing to wear and no money to their name.

The details of these trips have been recently discovered through the memoires written by Huguenots for their families. These were written often years later once safely outside of France and published only recently. These include:
* &quot;Mémoires d’une famille huguenote victime de la révocation de l’édit de Nantes&quot; by Jacques Fontaine
* &quot;Mémoires&quot; by Isaac Dumont de Bostaquet
* &quot;Mémoires d’un protestant du Vigan des dragonnades au Refuge (1683-1686)&quot; by Jean Valat
* &quot;Journal de Jean Migault ou malheurs d’une famille protestante du Poitou victime de la révocation de l’édit de Nantes (1682-1689)&quot; by Jean Migault

===Early emigration to colonies===

The first Huguenots to leave France sought freedom from persecution in Switzerland and the Netherlands. A group of Huguenots was part of the French colonisers who arrived in Brazil in 1555 to found . A couple of ships with around 500 people arrived at the Guanabara Bay, present-day Rio de Janeiro, and settled on a small island. A fort, named Fort Coligny, was built to protect them from attack from the Portuguese troops and Brazilian natives. It was an attempt to establish a French colony in South America. The fort was destroyed in 1560 by the Portuguese, who captured some of the Huguenots. The Portuguese threatened their Protestant prisoners with death if they did not convert to Roman Catholicism. The Huguenots of Guanabara, as they are now known, produced what is known as the Guanabara Confession of Faith to explain their beliefs. The Portuguese executed them.

===South Africa===

Huguenots first settled at the Cape of Good Hope in 1671; the first documented was the wagonmaker François Vilion (Viljoen). The first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope was Maria de la Quellerie, wife of commander Jan van Riebeeck (and daughter of a Walloon church minister), who arrived on 6 April 1652 to establish a settlement at what is today Cape Town. The couple left for Batavia ten years later.

But it was not until 31 December 1687 that the first organised group of Huguenots set sail from the Netherlands to the Dutch East India Company post at the Cape of Good Hope. The largest portion of the Huguenots to settle in the Cape arrived between 1688 and 1689 in seven ships as part of the organised migration, but quite a few arrived as late as 1700; thereafter, the numbers declined and only small groups arrived at a time. Many of these settlers were given land in an area that was later called (Dutch for &#x27;French Corner&#x27;), in the present-day Western Cape province of South Africa. A large monument to commemorate the arrival of the Huguenots in South Africa was inaugurated on 7 April 1948 at Franschhoek. The Huguenot Memorial Museum was also erected there and opened in 1957.

The official policy of the Dutch East India governors was to integrate the Huguenot and the Dutch communities. When Paul Roux, a pastor who arrived with the main group of Huguenots, died in 1724, the Dutch administration, as a special concession, permitted another French cleric to take his place &quot;for the benefit of the elderly who spoke only French&quot;. But with assimilation, within three generations the Huguenots had generally adopted Dutch as their first and home language.

Many of the farms in the Western Cape province in South Africa still bear French names. Many families, today, mostly Afrikaans-speaking, have surnames indicating their French Huguenot ancestry. Examples include: Blignaut, Cilliers, Cronje (Cronier), de Klerk (Le Clercq), de Villiers, du Plessis, Du Preez (Des Pres), du Randt (Durand), du Toit, Duvenhage (Du Vinage), Franck, Fouché, Fourie (Fleurit), Gervais, Giliomee (Guilliaume), Gous/Gouws (Gauch), Hugo, Jordaan (Jourdan), Joubert, Kriek, Labuschagne (la Buscagne), le Roux, Lombard, Malan, Malherbe, Marais, Maree, Minnaar (Mesnard), Nel (Nell), Naudé, Nortjé (Nortier), Pienaar (Pinard), Retief (Retif), Roux, Rossouw (Rousseau), Taljaard (Taillard), TerBlanche, Theron, Viljoen (Vilion) and Visagie (Visage). The wine industry in South Africa owes a significant debt to the Huguenots, some of whom had vineyards in France, or were brandy distillers, and used their skills in their new home.

===North America===

French Huguenots made two attempts to establish a haven in North America. In 1562, naval officer Jean Ribault led an expedition that explored Florida and the present-day Southeastern US, and founded the outpost of Charlesfort on Parris Island, South Carolina. The French Wars of Religion precluded a return voyage, and the outpost was abandoned. In 1564, Ribault&#x27;s former lieutenant René Goulaine de Laudonnière launched a second voyage to build a colony; he established Fort Caroline in what is now Jacksonville, Florida. War at home again precluded a resupply mission, and the colony struggled. In 1565 the Spanish decided to enforce their claim to , and sent Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, who established the settlement of St. Augustine near Fort Caroline. Menéndez&#x27; forces routed the French and executed most of the Protestant captives.
Barred by the government from settling in New France, Huguenots led by Jessé de Forest, sailed to North America in 1624 and settled instead in the Dutch colony of New Netherland (later incorporated into New York and New Jersey); as well as Great Britain&#x27;s colonies, including Nova Scotia. A number of New Amsterdam&#x27;s families were of Huguenot origin, often having emigrated as refugees to the Netherlands in the previous century. In 1628 the Huguenots established a congregation as (the French church in New Amsterdam). This parish continues today as , now a part of the Episcopal Church (Anglican) communion, and welcomes Francophone New Yorkers from all over the world. Upon their arrival in New Amsterdam, Huguenots were offered land directly across from Manhattan on Long Island for a permanent settlement and chose the harbour at the end of Newtown Creek, becoming the first Europeans to live in Brooklyn, then known as Boschwick, in the neighbourhood now known as Bushwick.

Huguenot immigrants settled throughout pre-colonial America, including in New Amsterdam (New York City), some 21 miles north of New York in a town which they named New Rochelle, and some further upstate in New Paltz. The &quot;Huguenot Street Historic District&quot; in New Paltz has been designated a National Historic Landmark site and contains one of the oldest streets in the United States of America. A small group of Huguenots also settled on the south shore of Staten Island along the New York Harbor, for which the current neighbourhood of Huguenot was named. Huguenot refugees also settled in the Delaware River Valley of Eastern Pennsylvania and Hunterdon County, New Jersey in 1725. Frenchtown in New Jersey bears the mark of early settlers.

New Rochelle, located in the county of Westchester on the north shore of Long Island Sound, seemed to be the great location of the Huguenots in New York. It is said that they landed on the coastline peninsula of Davenports Neck called &quot;Bauffet&#x27;s Point&quot; after travelling from England where they had previously taken refuge on account of religious persecution, four years before the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. They purchased from John Pell, Lord of Pelham Manor, a tract of land consisting of six thousand one hundred acres with the help of Jacob Leisler. It was named New Rochelle after La Rochelle, their former strong-hold in France. A small wooden church was first erected in the community, followed by a second church that was built of stone. Previous to the erection of it, the strong men would often walk twenty-three miles on Saturday evening, the distance by the road from New Rochelle to New York, to attend the Sunday service. The church was eventually replaced by a third, Trinity-St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church, which contains heirlooms including the original bell from the French Huguenot Church on Pine Street in New York City, which is preserved as a relic in the tower room. The Huguenot cemetery, or the &quot;Huguenot Burial Ground&quot;, has since been recognised as a historic cemetery that is the final resting place for a wide range of the Huguenot founders, early settlers and prominent citizens dating back more than three centuries.

Some Huguenot immigrants settled in central and eastern Pennsylvania. They assimilated with the predominantly Pennsylvania German settlers of the area.

In 1700 several hundred French Huguenots migrated from England to the colony of Virginia, where the King William III of England had promised them land grants in Lower Norfolk County. When they arrived, colonial authorities offered them instead land 20 miles above the falls of the James River, at the abandoned Monacan village known as Manakin Town, now in Goochland County. Some settlers landed in present-day Chesterfield County. On 12 May 1705, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act to naturalise the 148 Huguenots still resident at Manakintown. Of the original 390 settlers in the isolated settlement, many had died; others lived outside town on farms in the English style; and others moved to different areas. Gradually they intermarried with their English neighbours. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, descendants of the French migrated west into the Piedmont, and across the Appalachian Mountains into the West of what became Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and other states. In the Manakintown area, the Huguenot Memorial Bridge across the James River and Huguenot Road were named in their honour, as were many local features, including several schools, including Huguenot High School.

In the early years, many Huguenots also settled in the area of present-day Charleston, South Carolina. In 1685, Rev. Elie Prioleau from the town of Pons in France, was among the first to settle there. He became pastor of the first Huguenot church in North America in that city. After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, several Huguenots including Edmund Bohun of Suffolk, England, Pierre Bacot of Touraine France, Jean Postell of Dieppe France, Alexander Pepin, Antoine Poitevin of Orsement France, and Jacques de Bordeaux of Grenoble, immigrated to the Charleston Orange district. They were very successful at marriage and property speculation. After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies, they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper, Ashepoo, Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger. Some of their descendants moved into the Deep South and Texas, where they developed new plantations.

The French Huguenot Church of Charleston, which remains independent, is the oldest continuously active Huguenot congregation in the United States. in New York, founded in 1628, is older, but it left the French Reformed movement in 1804 to become part of the Episcopal Church.

Most of the Huguenot congregations (or individuals) in North America eventually affiliated with other Protestant denominations with more numerous members. The Huguenots adapted quickly and often married outside their immediate French communities. Their descendants in many families continued to use French first names and surnames for their children well into the nineteenth century. Assimilated, the French made numerous contributions to United States economic life, especially as merchants and artisans in the late Colonial and early Federal periods. For example, E.I. du Pont, a former student of Lavoisier, established the Eleutherian gunpowder mills. Howard Hughes, famed investor, pilot, film director, and philanthropist, was also of Huguenot descent and descendant from Rev. John Gano.

Paul Revere was descended from Huguenot refugees, as was Henry Laurens, who signed the Articles of Confederation for South Carolina. Other descendants of Huguenots included Jack Jouett, who made the ride from Cuckoo Tavern to warn Thomas Jefferson and others that Tarleton and his men were on their way to arrest him for crimes against the king; Reverend John Gano, a Revolutionary War chaplain and spiritual advisor to George Washington; Francis Marion; and a number of other leaders of the American Revolution and later statesmen. The last active Huguenot congregation in North America worships in Charleston, South Carolina, at a church that dates to 1844. The Huguenot Society of America maintains the Manakin Episcopal Church in Virginia as a historic shrine with occasional services. The Society has chapters in numerous states, with the one in Texas being the largest.

After the British Conquest of New France, British authorities in Lower Canada tried to encourage Huguenot immigration in an attempt to promote a Francophone Protestant Church in the region, hoping that French-speaking Protestants would be more loyal clergy than those of Roman Catholicism. While a small number of Huguenots did come, the majority switched from speaking French to English. As a result, Protestants are still a religious minority in Quebec today.

====Spoken language====
The Huguenots originally spoke French on their arrival in the American colonies, but after two or three generations, they had switched to English. They did not promote French-language schools or publications and &quot;lost&quot; their historic identity. In upstate New York they merged with the Dutch Reformed community and switched first to Dutch and then in the early 19th century to English. In colonial New York City they switched from French to English or Dutch by 1730.

===Netherlands===
Some Huguenots fought in the Low Countries alongside the Dutch against Spain during the first years of the Dutch Revolt (1568–1609). The Dutch Republic rapidly became a destination for Huguenot exiles. Early ties were already visible in the of William the Silent, condemning the Spanish Inquisition, which was written by his court minister, the Huguenot Pierre L&#x27;Oyseleur, lord of Villiers. Louise de Coligny, daughter of the murdered Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny, married William the Silent, leader of the Dutch (Calvinist) revolt against Spanish (Catholic) rule. As both spoke French in daily life, their court church in the Prinsenhof in Delft held services in French. The practice has continued to the present day. The Prinsenhof is one of the 14 active Walloon churches of the Dutch Reformed Church (now of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands). The ties between Huguenots and the Dutch Republic&#x27;s military and political leadership, the House of Orange-Nassau, which existed since the early days of the Dutch Revolt, helped support the many early settlements of Huguenots in the Dutch Republic&#x27;s colonies. They settled at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa and New Netherland in North America.

Stadtholder William III of Orange, who later became King of England, emerged as the strongest opponent of King Louis XIV after the French attacked the Dutch Republic in 1672. William formed the League of Augsburg as a coalition to oppose Louis and the French state. Consequently, many Huguenots considered the wealthy and Calvinist-controlled Dutch Republic, which also happened to lead the opposition to Louis XIV, as the most attractive country for exile after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. They also found many French-speaking Calvinist churches there (which were called the &quot;Walloon churches&quot;).

After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, the Dutch Republic received the largest group of Huguenot refugees, an estimated total of 75,000 to 100,000 people. Amongst them were 200 pastors. Most came from northern France (Brittany, Normandy, and Picardy), as well as West Flanders (subsequently French Flanders), which had been annexed from the Southern Netherlands by Louis XIV in 1668–78. Many came from the region of the Cévennes, for instance, the village of Fraissinet-de-Lozère. This was a huge influx as the entire population of the Dutch Republic amounted to at that time. Around 1700, it is estimated that nearly 25% of the Amsterdam population was Huguenot. In 1705, Amsterdam and the area of West Frisia were the first areas to provide full citizens rights to Huguenot immigrants, followed by the whole Dutch Republic in 1715. Huguenots intermarried with Dutch from the outset.

One of the most prominent Huguenot refugees in the Netherlands was Pierre Bayle. He started teaching in Rotterdam, where he finished writing and publishing his multi-volume masterpiece, &quot;Historical and Critical Dictionary&quot;. It became one of the 100 foundational texts of the US Library of Congress. Some Huguenot descendants in the Netherlands may be noted by French family names, although they typically use Dutch given names. Due to the Huguenots&#x27; early ties with the leadership of the Dutch Revolt and their own participation, some of the Dutch patriciate are of part-Huguenot descent. Some Huguenot families have kept alive various traditions, such as the celebration and feast of their patron , similar to the Dutch (Sinterklaas) feast.

===Great Britain and Ireland===
====England====

As a major Protestant nation, England patronized and helped protect Huguenots since at least the mid-1500s. Kent hosted the first congregation of Huguenots in England in around 1548. During the reign of Mary I (1553–1558) they were expelled but, with the accession of Elizabeth I, returned to London in 1559 and Kent in 1561. An early group of Huguenots settled in Colchester in 1565. There was a small naval Anglo-French War (1627–1629), in which the English supported the French Huguenots against King Louis XIII. London financed the emigration of many to England and its colonies around 1700. Some 40,000–50,000 settled in England, mostly in towns near the sea in the southern districts, with the largest concentration in London where they constituted about 5% of the total population in 1700. Many others went to the American colonies, especially South Carolina. The immigrants included many skilled craftsmen and entrepreneurs who facilitated the economic modernization of their new home, in an era when economic innovations were transferred by people rather than through printed works. The British government ignored the complaints made by local craftsmen about the favoritism shown to foreigners. The immigrants assimilated well in terms of using English, joining the Church of England, intermarriage and business success. They founded the silk industry in England. Many became private tutors, schoolmasters, travelling tutors and owners of riding schools, where they were hired by the upper class.

Both before and after the 1708 passage of the Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act, an estimated 50,000 Protestant Walloons and French Huguenots fled to England, with many moving on to Ireland and elsewhere. In relative terms, this was one of the largest waves of immigration ever of a single ethnic community to Britain. Andrew Lortie (born André Lortie), a leading Huguenot theologian and writer who led the exiled community in London, became known for articulating their criticism of the Pope and the doctrine of transubstantiation during Mass.

Of the refugees who arrived on the Kent coast, many gravitated towards Canterbury, then the county&#x27;s Calvinist hub. Many Walloon and Huguenot families were granted asylum there. Edward VI granted them the whole of the western crypt of Canterbury Cathedral for worship. In 1825, this privilege was reduced to the south aisle and in 1895 to the former chantry chapel of the Black Prince. Services are still held there in French according to the Reformed tradition every Sunday at 3 pm.

Other evidence of the Walloons and Huguenots in Canterbury includes a block of houses in Turnagain Lane, where weavers&#x27; windows survive on the top floor, as many Huguenots worked as weavers. The Weavers, a half-timbered house by the river, was the site of a weaving school from the late 16th century to about 1830. (It has been adapted as a restaurant—see illustration above. The house derives its name from a weaving school which was moved there in the last years of the 19th century, reviving an earlier use.) Other refugees practiced the variety of occupations necessary to sustain the community as distinct from the indigenous population. Such economic separation was the condition of the refugees&#x27; initial acceptance in the city. They also settled elsewhere in Kent, particularly Sandwich, Faversham and Maidstone—towns in which there used to be refugee churches.

The French Protestant Church of London was established by Royal Charter in 1550. It is now located at Soho Square. Huguenot refugees flocked to Shoreditch, London. They established a major weaving industry in and around Spitalfields (see Petticoat Lane and the Tenterground) in East London. In Wandsworth, their gardening skills benefited the Battersea market gardens. The flight of Huguenot refugees from Tours, France drew off most of the workers of its great silk mills which they had built. Some of these immigrants moved to Norwich, which had accommodated an earlier settlement of Walloon weavers. The French added to the existing immigrant population, then comprising about a third of the population of the city.

Some Huguenots settled in Bedfordshire, one of the main centres of the British lace industry at the time. Although 19th-century sources have asserted that some of these refugees were lacemakers and contributed to the East Midlands lace industry, this is contentious. The only reference to immigrant lace makers in this period is of twenty-five widows who settled in Dover, and there is no contemporary documentation to support there being Huguenot lace makers in Bedfordshire. The implication that the style of lace known as &#x27;Bucks Point&#x27; demonstrates a Huguenot influence, being a &quot;combination of Mechlin patterns on Lille ground&quot;, is fallacious: what is now known as Mechlin lace did not develop until the first half of the eighteenth century and lace with Mechlin patterns and Lille ground did not appear until the end of the 18th century, when it was widely copied throughout Europe.

Many Huguenots from the Lorraine region also eventually settled in the area around Stourbridge in the modern-day West Midlands, where they found the raw materials and fuel to continue their glassmaking tradition. Anglicized names such as Tyzack, Henzey and Tittery are regularly found amongst the early glassmakers, and the region went on to become one of the most important glass regions in the country.

Winston Churchill was the most prominent Briton of Huguenot descent, deriving from the Huguenots who went to the colonies; his American grandfather was Leonard Jerome.

====Ireland====
Following the French crown&#x27;s revocation of the Edict of Nantes, many Huguenots settled in Ireland in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, encouraged by an act of parliament for Protestants&#x27; settling in Ireland. Huguenot regiments fought for William of Orange in the Williamite War in Ireland, for which they were rewarded with land grants and titles, many settling in Dublin. Significant Huguenot settlements were in Dublin, Cork, Portarlington, Lisburn, Waterford and Youghal. Smaller settlements, which included Killeshandra in County Cavan, contributed to the expansion of flax cultivation and the growth of the Irish linen industry.

For over 150 years, Huguenots were allowed to hold their services in Lady Chapel in St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. A Huguenot cemetery is located in the centre of Dublin, off St. Stephen&#x27;s Green. Prior to its establishment, Huguenots used the Cabbage Garden near the cathedral. Another Huguenot cemetery is located off French Church Street in Cork.

A number of Huguenots served as mayors in Dublin, Cork, Youghal and Waterford in the 17th and 18th centuries. Numerous signs of Huguenot presence can still be seen with names still in use, and with areas of the main towns and cities named after the people who settled there. Examples include the Huguenot District and French Church Street in Cork City; and D&#x27;Olier Street in Dublin, named after a High Sheriff and one of the founders of the Bank of Ireland. A French church in Portarlington dates back to 1696, and was built to serve the significant new Huguenot community in the town. At the time, they constituted the majority of the townspeople.

One of the more notable Huguenot descendants in Ireland was Seán Lemass (1899–1971), who was appointed as &quot;Taoiseach&quot;, serving from 1959 until 1966.

====Scotland====
With the precedent of a historical alliance — the Auld Alliance — between Scotland and France, Huguenots were mostly welcomed to, and found refuge in the nation from around the year 1700. Although they did not settle in Scotland in such significant numbers as in other regions of Britain and Ireland, Huguenots have been romanticised, and are generally considered to have contributed greatly to Scottish culture. John Arnold Fleming wrote extensively of the French Protestant group&#x27;s impact on the nation in his 1953 &quot;Huguenot Influence in Scotland&quot;, while sociologist Abraham Lavender, who has explored how the ethnic group transformed over generations &quot;from Mediterranean Catholics to White Anglo-Saxon Protestants&quot;, has analyzed how Huguenot adherence to Calvinist customs helped facilitate compatibility with the Scottish people.

====Wales====
A number of French Huguenots settled in Wales, in the upper Rhymney valley of the current Caerphilly County Borough. The community they created there is still known as &quot;Fleur de Lys&quot; (the symbol of France), an unusual French village name in the heart of the valleys of Wales. Nearby villages are Hengoed, and Ystrad Mynach. Apart from the French village name and that of the local rugby team, Fleur De Lys RFC, little remains of the French heritage.

===Germany, Poland and Scandinavia===

After the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre of 1572, some persecuted Huguenots fled to Poland, taking advantage of its religious tolerance confirmed by the Warsaw Confederation, marking the first significant historical wave of French migration to Poland.

Around 1685, Huguenot refugees found a safe haven in the Lutheran and Reformed states in Germany and Scandinavia. Nearly 50,000 Huguenots established themselves in Germany, 20,000 of whom were welcomed in Brandenburg-Prussia, where Frederick William (), granted them special privileges (Edict of Potsdam of 1685) and churches in which to worship (such as the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Angermünde and the French Cathedral, Berlin). The Huguenots furnished two new regiments of his army: the Altpreußische Infantry Regiments No. 13 (Regiment on foot Varenne) and 15 (Regiment on foot Wylich). Another 4,000 Huguenots settled in the German territories of Baden, Franconia (Principality of Bayreuth, Principality of Ansbach), Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, Duchy of Württemberg, in the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts, in the Palatinate and Palatine Zweibrücken, in the Rhine-Main-Area (Frankfurt), in modern-day Saarland; and 1,500 found refuge in Hamburg, Bremen and Lower Saxony. Three hundred refugees were granted asylum at the court of George William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg in Celle.

In Berlin the Huguenots created two new neighborhoods: Dorotheenstadt and Friedrichstadt. By 1700 one fifth of the city&#x27;s population was French-speaking. The Berlin Huguenots preserved the French language in their church services for nearly a century. They ultimately decided to switch to German in protest against the occupation of Prussia by Napoleon in 1806–07. Many of their descendants rose to positions of prominence. Several congregations were founded throughout Germany and Scandinavia, such as those of Fredericia (Denmark), Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Helsinki, and Emden.
Prince Louis de Condé, along with his sons Daniel and Osias, arranged with Count Ludwig von Nassau-Saarbrücken to establish a Huguenot community in present-day Saarland in 1604. The Count supported mercantilism and welcomed technically skilled immigrants into his lands, regardless of their religion. The Condés established a thriving glass-making works, which provided wealth to the principality for many years. Other founding families created enterprises based on textiles and such traditional Huguenot occupations in France. The community and its congregation remain active to this day, with descendants of many of the founding families still living in the region. Some members of this community emigrated to the United States in the 1890s.

In Bad Karlshafen, Hessen, Germany is the Huguenot Museum and Huguenot archive. The collection includes family histories, a library, and a picture archive.

===Effects===
The exodus of Huguenots from France created a brain drain, as many of them had occupied important places in society. The kingdom did not fully recover for years. The French crown&#x27;s refusal to allow non-Catholics to settle in New France may help to explain that colony&#x27;s low population compared to that of the neighboring British colonies, which opened settlement to religious dissenters. By the start of the French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War, a sizeable population of Huguenot descent lived in the British colonies, and many participated in the British defeat of New France in 1759–1760.

Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, invited Huguenots to settle in his realms, and a number of their descendants rose to positions of prominence in Prussia. Several prominent German military, cultural and political figures were ethnic Huguenot, including the poet Theodor Fontane, General Hermann von François, the hero of the First World War&#x27;s Battle of Tannenberg, Luftwaffe general and fighter ace Adolf Galland, the Luftwaffe flying ace Hans-Joachim Marseille, WWII Wehrmacht Lieutenant Colonel/Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Ulrich de Maizière and the famed U-boat Captains Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière and Wilhelm Souchon. Related to Ulrich de Maizière were also the last prime minister of East Germany, Lothar de Maizière and the former German Federal Minister of the Interior, Thomas de Maizière. A 2014 study in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot; linked Huguenot migration to Prussia with a boost in industrial productivity.

The persecution and the flight of the Huguenots greatly damaged the reputation of Louis XIV abroad, particularly in England. Both kingdoms, which had enjoyed peaceful relations until 1685, became bitter enemies and fought each other in a series of wars, called the &quot;Second Hundred Years&#x27; War&quot; by some historians, from 1689 onward.

==1985 apology==

In October 1985, to commemorate the tricentenary of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, President François Mitterrand of France announced a formal apology to the descendants of Huguenots around the world. At the same time, the government released a special postage stamp in their honour reading &quot;France &quot;is&quot; the home of the Huguenots&quot; ().

==Legacy==
Huguenot legacy persists both in France and abroad.

===France===
Several French Protestant churches are descended from or tied to the Huguenots, including:
* Reformed Church of France (), founded in 1559, the historical and principal Reformed church in France since the Protestant Reformation until its 2013 merger into the United Protestant Church of France
* Evangelical Reformed Church of France (), founded in 1938
* Some French members of the largely German Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine

===United States===
* Bayonne, New Jersey
* Four-term Republican United States Representative Howard Homan Buffett was of Huguenot descent.
* Charleston, South Carolina, is home to the only active Huguenot congregation in the United States
* John Sevier, the first governor of the state of Tennessee, and the only governor of the State of Franklin was of Huguenot descent.
* In 1924, the US issued a commemorative half dollar, known as the &quot;Huguenot-Walloon half dollar&quot;, to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Huguenots&#x27; settlement in what is now the United States.
* Frenchtown, New Jersey, part of the larger Delaware River Valley, was a settling area in the early 1700s.
* The neighborhood of Huguenot in New York City&#x27;s borough of Staten Island, straddling Huguenot Avenue
* Huguenot Memorial Park in Jacksonville, Florida.
* The early leaders John Jay and Paul Revere were of Huguenot descent.
* Francis Marion, an American Revolutionary War guerrilla fighter in South Carolina, was of predominantly Huguenot ancestry.
* New Paltz, New York
* New Rochelle, New York, named for the city of La Rochelle, a known former Huguenot stronghold in France. The Huguenot and Historical Association of New Rochelle was organized in 1885 for the purpose of perpetuating the history of its original Huguenot settlers. The mascot of New Rochelle High School is the Huguenot; and one of the main streets in the city is called Huguenot Street.
* John Pintard (1759–1854), a descendant of Huguenots and prosperous New York City merchant who was involved in various New York City organizations. Pintard was credited with establishing the modern conception of Santa Claus.
* Arthur C. Mellette (23 June 1842 – 25 May 1896), the last governor of the Dakota territory and the first governor of South Dakota was of Huguenot descent.
* Charles Shumway (1806–1898), an early member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, member of the Council of Fifty and part of the Utah Legislature for one term in 1851, was a descendent of Huguenot settlers.
* In Richmond, Virginia, and the neighboring Chesterfield County, there is a Huguenot Road. A Huguenot High School in Richmond and Huguenot Park in Chesterfield County, along with several other uses of the name throughout the region, commemorate the early refugee settlers.
* The Manakintown Episcopal Church in Midlothian, Virginia serves as a National Huguenot Memorial.
* Walloon Settlers Memorial (located in Battery Park) is a monument given to the City of New York by the Belgian Province of Hainaut in honor of the inspiration of Jessé de Forest in founding New York City. Baron de Cartier de Marchienne, representing the government and Albert I, King of Belgium, presented the monument to Mayor John F. Hylan, for the City of New York 18 May 1924.
* Oxford, Massachusetts

===England===
* There is a Huguenot society in London, as well as a French Protestant Church of London, founded in 1550 in Soho Square, which is still active, and has also been a registered charity since 1926.
* Huguenots of Spitalfields is a registered charity promoting public understanding of the Huguenot heritage and culture in Spitalfields, the City of London and beyond. They arrange tours, talks, events and schools programmes to raise the Huguenot profile in Spitalfields and raise funds for a permanent memorial to the Huguenots.
* Huguenot Place in Wandsworth is named after the Huguenot Burial Site or Mount Nod Cemetery, which was used by the Huguenots living in the area. The site was in use from 1687 to 1854 and graves can still be observed today.
* Canterbury Cathedral retains a Huguenot Chapel in the &#x27;Black Prince&#x27;s Chantry&#x27;, part of the Crypt which is accessible from the exterior of the cathedral. The chapel was granted to Huguenot refugees on the orders of Queen Elizabeth I in 1575. To this day, the chapel still holds services in French every Sunday at 3 pm.
* Strangers&#x27; Hall in Norwich got its name from the Protestant refugees from the Spanish Netherlands who settled in the city from the 16th century onwards and were referred to by the locals as the &#x27;Strangers&#x27;. The Strangers brought with them their pet canaries, and over the centuries the birds became synonymous with the city. In the early 20th century, Norwich City F.C. adopted the canary as their emblem and nickname.

===Prussia===
* Huguenot refugees in Prussia are thought to have contributed significantly to the development of the textile industry in that country. One notable example was Marthe de Roucoulle, governess of Prussian kings Frederick William I and Frederick the Great.

===Ireland===
* Sean Francis Lemass, Taoiseach of Ireland from 1959 to 1966, was of Huguenot descent.
* The poet Samuel Beckett was also of Huguenot descent.

=== South Africa ===

* Most South African Huguenots settled in the Cape Colony, where they became assimilated into the Afrikaner and Afrikaans population. Many modern Afrikaners have French surnames, which are given Afrikaans pronunciation and orthography. The early immigrants settled in (&quot;French Corner&quot;) near Cape Town. The Huguenots contributed greatly to the wine industry in South Africa.

===Australia===

* The majority of Australians with French ancestry are descended from Huguenots. Some of the earliest to arrive in Australia held prominent positions in English society, notably Jane Franklin and Charles La Trobe.
* Others who came later were from poorer families, migrating from England in the 19th and early 20th centuries to escape the poverty of London&#x27;s East End Huguenot enclaves of Spitalfields and Bethnal Green. Their impoverishment had been brought on by the Industrial Revolution, which caused the collapse of the Huguenot-dominated silk-weaving industry. Many French Australian descendants of Huguenots still consider themselves very much Huguenots or French, even in the 21st century.

<text>The Synod of Ancyra was an ecclesiastical council, or synod, convened in Ancyra, the seat of the Roman administration for the province of Galatia, in 314. The season was soon after Easter; the year may be safely deduced from the fact that the first nine canons are intended to repair havoc wreaked in the church by persecution, which ceased after the overthrow of Maximinus II in 313. Only about a dozen bishops were present, nonetheless representing nearly every part of Syria and Asia Minor. Either Vitalis, Bishop of Antioch, or Marcellus of Ancyra presided, and possibly both were present, although the Libellus Synodicus, also known as the Synodicon Vetus, assigns to the latter.

The tenth canon tolerates the marriages of deacons who previous to ordination had reserved the right to take a wife.

The thirteenth forbids chorepiscopi to ordain presbyters or deacons.

The sixteenth canon brackets the Christians who have committed bestiality, or may still have been doing so, into several different groups based on the offender&#x27;s age, and assigns different penances to each group; married men over 20 were sanctioned more harshly than unmarried youths, and married men over 50 received the harshest sanctions.

The seventeenth canon condemns the Christians who have either committed bestiality or had sexual intercourse with a leprous woman, while themselves being leprous, to having to pray with the &quot;wintering people&quot; - i.e. outside church buildings.
The equation of leprous women with beasts is generally considered difficult to interpret.

The eighteenth safeguards the right of the people in objecting to the appointment of a bishop whom they do not wish. 

Canon XXII: Concerning wilful murderers let them remain prostrators; but at the end of life let them be indulged with full communion.

Canon XXIV imposes five years of penance upon those who consult magicians.

<text>ISO/IEC 8859-3:1999, &quot;Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 3: Latin alphabet No. 3&quot;, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings, first edition published in 1988. It is informally referred to as Latin-3 or &quot;South European&quot;. It was designed to cover Turkish, Maltese and Esperanto, though the introduction of ISO/IEC 8859-9 superseded it for Turkish. The encoding was popular for users of Esperanto, but fell out of use as application support for Unicode became more common.

ISO-8859-3 is the IANA preferred charset name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429. Microsoft has assigned code page 28593 a.k.a. Windows-28593 to ISO-8859-3 in Windows. IBM has assigned code page 913 (CCSID 913) to ISO 8859-3.

<text>Amilcare Ponchielli (, ; 31 August 1834 – 16 January 1886) was an Italian opera composer, best known for his opera &quot;La Gioconda&quot;. He was married to the soprano Teresina Brambilla.

==Life and work==
Born in Paderno Fasolaro (now Paderno Ponchielli) near Cremona, then Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, Ponchielli won a scholarship at the age of nine to study music at the Milan Conservatory, writing his first symphony by the time he was ten years old.

In 1856, he wrote his first opera—based on Alessandro Manzoni&#x27;s novel &quot;The Betrothed&quot; (&quot;I promessi sposi&quot;)—and it was as an opera composer that he eventually found fame.

His early career was disappointing. Manoeuvred out of a professorship at the Milan Conservatory that he had won in a competition, he took small-time jobs in small cities and composed several operas, none successful at first. In spite of his disappointment, he gained much experience as the bandmaster (&quot;capobanda&quot;) in Piacenza and Cremona, arranging and composing over 200 works for wind band. Notable among his &quot;original&quot; compositions for band are the first-ever concerto for euphonium (Concerto per Flicornobasso, 1872), fifteen variations on the popular Parisian song &quot;Carnevale di Venezia&quot;, and a series of festive and funeral marches that resound with the pride of the newly unified Italy and the private grief of his fellow Cremonese. The turning point was the big success of the revised version of &quot;I promessi sposi&quot; in 1872, which brought him a contract with the music publisher G. Ricordi &amp; Co. and the musical establishment at the Conservatory and at La Scala. The role of Lina in the revised version was sung by Teresina Brambilla, whom he married in 1874. Their son Annibale became a music critic and minor composer. The ballet &quot;Le due gemelle&quot; (1873) confirmed his success.

The following opera, &quot;I Lituani&quot; (&quot;The Lithuanians&quot;) of 1874, had a three-night run in 1903 at La Scala, where the casting was particularly poorly reviewed; it was scheduled for performances in 1939 that did not take place because the Second World War broke out, and it was not performed again until 1979, when RAI recovered the score. It has been revived several times since then. His best-known opera is &quot;La Gioconda&quot; (1876), which his librettist Arrigo Boito adapted from the same play by Victor Hugo that had been previously set by Saverio Mercadante as &quot;Il giuramento&quot; in 1837 and Carlos Gomes as &quot;Fosca&quot; in 1873. The opera contains the famous ballet Dance of the Hours as the third act finale. It was first produced in 1876 and revised several times. The version that has become popular today was first given in 1880.

In 1876, he started working on &quot;I Mori di Valenza&quot;, although the project dates back to 1873. It was an opera that he never finished, although it was completed later by Arturo Cadore and performed posthumously in 1914.
After &quot;La Gioconda&quot;, Ponchielli wrote the monumental biblical melodrama in four acts, &quot;Il figliuol prodigo&quot;, given in Milan at La Scala on 26 December 1880, and &quot;Marion Delorme&quot;, from another play by Victor Hugo, which was presented at La Scala on 17 March 1885. In spite of their rich musical invention, neither of these operas met with the same success, but both exerted great influence on the composers of the rising generation, such as Giacomo Puccini, Pietro Mascagni, and Umberto Giordano.

In 1881, Ponchielli was appointed &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; of the Bergamo Cathedral, and from the same year, he was a professor of composition at the Milan Conservatory, where among his students were Puccini, Mascagni, Emilio Pizzi, and Giovanni Tebaldini.

He died of pneumonia in Milan in 1886 and was interred in the city&#x27;s Monumental Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Although in his lifetime Ponchielli was very popular and influential (and introduced an enlarged orchestra and more complex orchestration), only one of his operas, &quot;La Gioconda&quot;, is regularly performed today. It contains a strong and memorable aria for contralto, &#x27;Voce de donna o d&#x27;angelo&#x27; (the Rosary song); the great tenor romanza &quot;Cielo e mar&quot;; a well-known duet for tenor and baritone titled &quot;Enzo Grimaldo, Principe Di Santafior&quot;; the soprano aria &quot;Suicidio!&quot;; and the ballet &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot;, which is widely known thanks in part to its having been featured in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot; in 1940, in Allan Sherman&#x27;s novelty song &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh&quot;, and in numerous other popular works.

<doc id="75908" wikidata="Q134309" url="?curid=75908" title="Charles IX of France">
<text>Charles IX (Charles Maximilien; 27 June 1550 – 30 May 1574) was King of France from 1560 until his death in 1574. He ascended the French throne upon the death of his brother Francis II in 1560, and as such was the penultimate monarch of the House of Valois.

Charles&#x27; reign saw the culmination of decades of tension between Protestants and Catholics. Civil and religious war broke out between the two parties after the massacre of Vassy in 1562. In 1572, following several unsuccessful attempts at brokering peace, Charles arranged the marriage of his sister Margaret to Henry of Navarre, a major Protestant nobleman in the line of succession to the French throne, in a last desperate bid to reconcile his people. Facing popular hostility against this policy of appeasement and at the instigation of his mother Catherine de&#x27; Medici, Charles oversaw the massacre of numerous Huguenot leaders who gathered in Paris for the royal wedding, though his direct involvement is still debated. This event, known as the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre, was a significant blow to the Huguenot movement, and religious civil warfare soon began anew. Charles sought to take advantage of the disarray of the Huguenots by ordering the siege of La Rochelle, but was unable to take the Protestant stronghold.

Many of Charles&#x27; decisions were influenced by his mother, a fervent Roman Catholic who initially supported a policy of relative religious tolerance. After the events of the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre, he began to support the persecution of Huguenots. However, the incident haunted Charles for the rest of his life, and historians suspect that it caused his physical and mental health to deteriorate over the next two years. Charles died of tuberculosis in 1574 without legitimate male issue, and was succeeded by his brother Henry III, whose own death in 1589 without issue allowed for the ascension of Henry of Navarre to the French throne as Henry IV, establishing the House of Bourbon as the new French royal dynasty.

==Biography==

===Birth and childhood===

Charles Maximilien of France, third son of King Henry II of France and Catherine de&#x27; Medici, was born on 27 June 1550 at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. He was the fifth of ten children born to the royal couple. Styled since birth as Duke of Angoulême, he was created Duke of Orléans after the death of his elder brother Louis, his parents&#x27; second son, who had died in infancy on 24 October 1550. The royal children were raised under the supervision of the governor and governess of the royal children, Claude d&#x27;Urfé and Françoise d&#x27;Humières, under the orders of Diane de Poitiers.

On 14 May 1564, Charles was presented the Order of the Garter by Henry Carey.

===Accession===
Charles&#x27; father died in 1559, and was succeeded by Charles&#x27; elder brother, King Francis II. Francis II died in 1560. The ten-year-old Charles was immediately proclaimed king on 5 December 1560, and the Privy Council appointed his mother, Catherine de&#x27; Medici, as governor of France (&quot;gouvernante de France&quot;), with sweeping powers, at first acting as regent for her young son. On 15 May 1561, Charles was consecrated in the cathedral at Reims. Antoine of Bourbon, himself in line to the French throne and husband to Queen Jeanne III of Navarre, was appointed Lieutenant-General of France.

In 1560, a group of Huguenot nobles at Amboise had planned to try to abduct King Francis II and arrest the Catholic leaders Francis, Duke of Guise, and his brother Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine. The plot was discovered ahead of time, and the Guises were prepared, executing hundreds of Huguenots. This was followed by cases of Protestant iconoclasm and Catholic reprisals.

The regent Catherine tried to foster reconciliation at the Colloquy at Poissy and, after that failed, made several concessions to the Huguenots in the Edict of Saint-Germain in January 1562. Nonetheless, the Massacre of Vassy, perpetrated on 1 March 1562, when the Duke of Guise and his troops attacked and killed or wounded over 100 Huguenot worshipers and citizens, brought France spiralling towards civil war. 

The massacre lit the fuse that sparked the French Wars of Religion. Louis of Bourbon, Prince of Condé, brother of the Lieutenant-General and the suspected architect of the Amboise conspiracy, had already prepared for war and, taking Wassy as the pretext, assumed the role of a protector of Protestantism and began to seize and garrison strategic towns along the Loire Valley. In response, the monarchy revoked the concessions given to the Huguenots. After the military leaders of both sides were either killed or captured in battles at Rouen, Dreux, and Orléans, the regent mediated a truce and issued the Edict of Amboise (1563).

====Armed peace====

The war was followed by four years of an uneasy &quot;armed peace&quot;, during which time Catherine united the factions in the successful effort to recapture Le Havre from the English. After this victory, Charles declared his legal majority in August 1563, formally ending the regency. However, Catherine continued to play a principal role in politics, and often dominated her son. In March 1564, the King and his mother set out from Fontainebleau on a grand tour of France. Their tour spanned two years and brought them through Bar, Lyon, Salon-de-Provence (where they visited Nostradamus), Carcassonne, Toulouse (where the King and his younger brother Henry were confirmed), Bayonne, La Rochelle, and Moulins. During this trip, Charles IX issued the Edict of Roussillon, which standardised 1 January as the first day of the year throughout France.

===Second and third war of religion===
War again broke out in 1567 after Charles added 6,000 Swiss mercenaries to his personal guards. Huguenots, fearing a Catholic attack was imminent, tried to abduct the king at Meaux, seized various cities, and massacred Catholics at Nîmes in an action known as the Michelade. The Battle of Saint-Denis resulted in a Huguenot defeat and the death of Anne de Montmorency, the royal commander-in-chief, and the short war ended in 1568 with the Peace of Longjumeau. The privileges granted to Protestants were widely opposed, however, leading to their cancellation and the resumption of war. The Dutch Republic, England and Navarre intervened on the Protestant side, while Spain, Tuscany and Pope Pius V supported the Catholics. Finally, the royal debt and the King&#x27;s desire to seek a peaceful solution led to yet another truce, the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye in August 1570, which again granted concessions to the Huguenots.

===Marriage and children===
On 26 November 1570, Charles married Elisabeth of Austria, with whom he fathered one daughter, Marie Elisabeth. In 1573, Charles fathered an illegitimate son, Charles, Duke of Angoulême, with his mistress, Marie Touchet.

===Coligny&#x27;s ascendancy and the massacre===

After the conclusion of the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1570, the king increasingly came under the influence of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, who had succeeded the slain Prince of Condé as leader of Huguenots after the Battle of Jarnac in 1569. Catherine, however, became increasingly fearful of Coligny&#x27;s unchecked power, especially since he was pursuing an alliance with England and the Dutch. Coligny was also hated by Henry, Duke of Guise, who accused the Admiral of having ordered the assassination of his father Francis of Guise during the siege of Orléans in 1563.

During the peace settlement, a marriage was arranged between Charles&#x27; sister Margaret of Valois and Henry of Navarre, the future King Henry IV, who was at that time heir to the throne of Navarre and one of the leading Huguenots. Many Huguenot nobles, including Admiral de Coligny, thronged into Paris for the wedding, which was set for 18 August 1572. On 22 August, a failed attempt on Coligny&#x27;s life put the city in a state of apprehension, as both visiting Huguenots and Parisian Catholics feared an attack by the other side.

In this situation, in the early morning of 24 August 1572, the Duke of Guise moved to avenge his father and murdered Coligny in his lodgings. As Coligny&#x27;s body was thrown into the street, Parisians mutilated the body. The mob action then erupted into the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre, a systematic slaughter of Huguenots that was to last five days. Henry of Navarre managed to avoid death by pledging to convert to Catholicism. Over the next few weeks, the disorder spread to more cities across France. In all, up to 10,000 Huguenots were killed in Paris and the provinces.

Though the massacres weakened Huguenot power, they also reignited war, which only ceased after the Edict of Boulogne in 1573 granted Huguenots amnesty and limited religious freedom. However, the year 1574 saw a failed Huguenot coup at Saint-Germain and successful Huguenot uprisings in Normandy, Poitou and the Rhône valley, setting the stage for another round of war.

===Decline and death===

In the aftermath of the massacre, the king&#x27;s fragile mental and physical constitution weakened drastically. His moods swung from boasting about the extremity of the massacre to exclamations that the screams of the murdered Huguenots kept ringing in his ears. Frantically, he blamed alternately himself – &quot;What blood shed! What murders!&quot;, he cried to his nurse. &quot;What evil counsel I have followed! O my God, forgive me... I am lost! I am lost!&quot; – or his mother – &quot;Who but you is the cause of all of this? God&#x27;s blood, you are the cause of it all!&quot; Catherine responded by declaring she had a lunatic for a son.

Charles&#x27; physical condition, tending towards tuberculosis, deteriorated to the point where, by spring of 1574, his hoarse coughing turned bloody and his hemorrhages grew more violent.

Charles IX died at the Château de Vincennes on 30 May 1574, aged 23. Given that his younger brother Henry, Duke of Anjou, had recently been elected King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and was away from France, their mother Catherine resumed the regency until Henry&#x27;s return from Poland.

In 1625, long after his death, a book Charles wrote on hunting, &quot;La Chasse Royale&quot;, was published. It is a valuable source for those interested in the history of hounds and hunting.

<text>Henry II (; 31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559) was King of France from 1547 until his death in 1559. The second son of Francis I and Duchess Claude of Brittany, he became Dauphin of France upon the death of his elder brother Francis in 1536.

As a child, Henry and his elder brother spent over four years in captivity in Spain as hostages in exchange for their father. Henry pursued his father&#x27;s policies in matters of art, war, and religion. He persevered in the Italian Wars against the Habsburgs and tried to suppress the Reformation, even as the Huguenot numbers were increasing drastically in France during his reign.

Under the April 1559 Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis which ended the Italian Wars, France renounced its claims in Italy, but gained certain other territories, including the Pale of Calais and the Three Bishoprics. These acquisitions strengthened French borders while the abdication of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in January 1556 and division of his empire between Spain and Austria provided them with greater flexibility in foreign policy. Nostradamus also served King Henry as physician and astrologer.

In June 1559, Henry was injured in a jousting tournament held to celebrate the treaty, and died ten days later after his surgeon, Ambroise Paré, was unable to cure the wound inflicted by Gabriel de Montgomery, the captain of his Scottish Guard. Though he died early, the succession appeared secure, for he left four young sons – as well as a widow (Catherine de&#x27; Medici) to lead a capable regency during their minority. Three of those sons lived long enough to become king; but their ineffectual reigns, and the unpopularity of Catherine&#x27;s regency, helped to spark the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Protestants, and an eventual end to the House of Valois as France&#x27;s ruling dynasty.

==Early years==

Henry was born in the royal Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris, the son of King Francis I and Claude, Duchess of Brittany, daughter of Louis XII of France and Anne, Duchess of Brittany. Francis and Claude were second cousins; both had Louis I, Duke of Orléans, as a patrilineal great-grandfather, and their marriage strengthened the family&#x27;s claim to the throne.

Henry&#x27;s father was captured at the Battle of Pavia in 1525 by the forces of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, and held prisoner in Spain. To obtain his release, it was agreed that Henry and his older brother Francis be sent to Spain in his place. They remained in captivity for over four years.

Henry married Catherine de&#x27; Medici, a member of the ruling family of Florence, on 28 October 1533, when they were both fourteen years old. The wedding was officiated by Pope Clement VII, himself a Medici. At this time, Henry&#x27;s brother Francis was alive and there was little prospect of Henry coming to the throne. The following year, he became romantically involved with a thirty-five-year-old widow, Diane de Poitiers. Henry and Diane had always been very close: the young lady had fondly embraced Henry on the day he, as a seven-year-old child, set off to captivity in Spain, and the bond had been renewed after his return to France. At the tournament to honour his father&#x27;s new bride, Eleanor, in 1531, Henry and Francis dressed as chevaliers, and Henry wore Diane&#x27;s colors.

Extremely confident, mature and intelligent, Diane left Catherine powerless to intervene. She did, however, insist that Henry sleep with Catherine in order to produce heirs to the throne.

When his elder brother Francis died in 1536 after a game of tennis, Henry became heir apparent to the throne.

His attachment to Diane caused a breach with his father in 1544; the royal mistress Anne de Pisseleu d&#x27;Heilly persuaded Francis that Henry and Diane were conspiring on behalf of the Constable Montmorency, who had been banished from court in 1540. Francis banished Diane from court. Henry also withdrew to the Château d&#x27;Anet; father and son were reconciled in 1545.

He succeeded his father on his 28th birthday and was crowned King of France on 25 July 1547 at Reims Cathedral.

==Reign==
=== Attitude towards Protestants ===
Henry&#x27;s reign was marked by the persecution of Protestants, mainly Calvinists known as Huguenots. Henry II severely punished them, particularly the ministers, for example by burning at the stake or cutting off their tongues for uttering heresies.

Henry II was made a Knight of the Garter by Edward VI, King of England, in April 1551. By 19 July, after some lengthy haggling concerning the dowry, a betrothal was made between his daughter, Elisabeth and Edward.

The Edict of Châteaubriant (27 June 1551) called upon the civil and ecclesiastical courts to detect and punish all heretics and placed severe restrictions on Huguenots, including the loss of one-third of their property to informers, and confiscations. The Edict also strictly regulated publications by prohibiting the sale, importation or printing of any unapproved book. It was during the reign of Henry II that Huguenot attempts at establishing a colony in Brazil were made, with the short-lived formation of . In June 1559, with war against the Habsburgs concluded, Henri established in letters patent his desire to task much of the Gendarmerie that had been involved in the foreign wars with the extirpation of domestic heresy.

===Italian War of 1551–1559===

The Italian War of 1551–1559 began when Henry declared war on Holy Roman Emperor Charles V with the intent of recapturing Italy and ensuring French, rather than Habsburg, domination of European affairs. Persecution of Protestants at home did not prevent him from becoming allied with German Protestant princes at the Treaty of Chambord in 1552. Simultaneously, the continuation of his father&#x27;s Franco-Ottoman alliance allowed him to invade the Rhineland while a Franco-Ottoman fleet defended southern France. Although an attempted 1553 invasion of Tuscany ended with defeat at Marciano, in return for his support in the Second Schmalkaldic War, Henry occupied the Three Bishoprics of Toul, Verdun and Metz, acquisitions secured with victory at Renty in 1554.

After the abdication of Charles V in 1556, the Habsburg empire was split between his son Philip II of Spain and brother Emperor Ferdinand I. The focus of Henry&#x27;s conflict with the Habsburgs shifted to Flanders, where Philip, in conjunction with Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, defeated the French at St Quentin. England&#x27;s entry into the war later that year led to the French capture of Calais, and French armies plundered the Spanish Netherlands. However, in April 1559 lack of money and increasing domestic religious tensions led Henry to agree the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis.

The Peace was signed between Henry and Elizabeth I of England on 2 April and between Henry and Philip of Spain on 3 April 1559 at Le Cateau-Cambrésis. Under its terms, France restored Piedmont and Savoy to Emmanuel Philibert, but retained Saluzzo, Calais and the Three Bishoprics. The agreement was reinforced by a marriage between Henry&#x27;s sister Margaret and Emmanuel Philibert, while his daughter Elisabeth of Valois became Philip&#x27;s third wife.

Henry raised the young Mary, Queen of Scots, at his court, hoping to establish a dynastic claim to the Kingdom of Scotland by her marriage to Dauphin Francis on 24 April 1558. Their son would have been King of France and King of Scotland, and also a claimant to the throne of England. Henry had Mary sign secret documents, illegal in Scottish law, that would ensure Valois rule in Scotland even if Mary died without leaving a child by Francis. As it happened, Francis died without issue a year and half after his father, ending the French claim to Scotland.

==Patent innovation==

Henry II introduced the concept of publishing the description of an invention in the form of a patent. The idea was to require an inventor to disclose his invention in exchange for monopoly rights to the patent. The description is called a patent &quot;specification&quot;. The first patent specification was submitted by the inventor Abel Foullon for (a type of rangefinder). Publication was delayed until after the patent expired in 1561.

==Death==
Henry II was an avid hunter and a participant in jousts and tournaments. On 30 June 1559, a tournament was held near Place des Vosges to celebrate the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis with his longtime enemies, the Habsburgs of Austria, and to celebrate the marriage of his daughter Elisabeth of Valois to King Philip II of Spain. During a jousting match, King Henry, wearing the colours of his mistress Diane de Poitiers, was wounded in the eye by a fragment of the splintered lance of Gabriel Montgomery, captain of the King&#x27;s Scottish Guard. Despite the efforts of royal surgeons Ambroise Paré and Andreas Vesalius, the court doctors ultimately &quot;advocated a wait-and-see strategy&quot;; as a result, the king&#x27;s untreated eye and brain damage led to his death by sepsis on 10 July 1559. His autopsy found that he had a cerebral abscess and the infection that he got through sepsis probably travelled to his brain. He was buried in a cadaver tomb in Saint Denis Basilica. Henry&#x27;s death played a significant role in the decline of jousting as a sport, particularly in France.

As Henry lay dying, Queen Catherine limited access to his bedside and denied Diane de Poitiers permission to see him, even though he repeatedly asked for her. Following his death, Catherine sent Diane into exile, where she lived in comfort on her own properties until her death.

It was the practice to enclose the heart of the king in an urn. The Monument to the Heart of Henry II is in the collection of the Louvre, but was originally in the Chapel of Orleans beneath a pyramid. The original bronze urn holding the king&#x27;s heart was destroyed during the French Revolution and a replica was made in the 19th century. The marble sculpture of the Three Graces holding the urn, executed from a single piece of marble by Germain Pilon, the sculptor to Catherine de&#x27; Medici, survives.

Henry was succeeded by his sickly fifteen-year-old son, Francis II. Francis was married to sixteen-year-old Mary, Queen of Scots, who had been his childhood friend and fiancée since her arrival at the French court when she was five. Francis II died in December 1560, and Mary returned to Scotland in August 1561. Francis II was succeeded by his ten-year-old brother Charles IX. His mother, Catherine de Medici, acted as regent.

==Children==

Catherine de&#x27; Medici bore ten of Henry&#x27;s children:
*Francis II, born 19 January 1544, who married Mary, Queen of Scots 
*Elizabeth of France, born 2 April 1546, who married Philip II, King of Spain
*Claude, born 12 November 1547, who married Charles III, Duke of Lorraine
*Louis, Duke of Orléans, born 3 February 1549, died 24 October 1550
*Charles IX, born 27 June 1550, died 30 May 1574
*Henry III, born 19 September 1551, also briefly King of Poland
*Margaret, born 14 May 1553, who married Henry III, King of Navarre (later Henry IV of France)
*Hercules, born 18 March 1555, later known as Francis, Duke of Alençon and Anjou
*Victoire, born 24 June 1556, died 17 August 1556
* Joan, born 24 June 1556, stillborn.

Henry II also had three illegitimate children:
* By Filippa Duci:
** Diane, duchesse d&#x27;Angoulême (1538–1619). At the age of fourteen, she married Orazio Farnese, Duke of Castro, who died in battle in 1553. Her second marriage was to François, Duke of Montmorency.
* By Lady Janet Stewart (1502–1562), the illegitimate daughter of James IV of Scotland:
** Henri d&#x27;Angoulême (1551 – June 1586). He was legitimized and became governor of Provence.
* By Nicole de Savigny:
** (1557–1621). He was given the title of Count of Saint-Rémy. One of his last known descendants was Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy, Countess de la Motte, famous for her role in the Affair of the Diamond Necklace at the court of Louis XVI.

==Portrayals==
Henri or Henry has had four notable portrayals onscreen:

He was played by a young Roger Moore in the 1956 film &quot;Diane&quot;, opposite Lana Turner in the title role and Marisa Pavan as Catherine de Medici.

In the 1998 film &quot;Ever After&quot;, the Prince Charming figure, portrayed by Dougray Scott, shares his name with the historical monarch.

In the 2013 CW series &quot;Reign&quot;, he is played by Alan van Sprang.

In the premiere of &quot;The Serpent Queen&quot; (2022), a young Henri (Alex Heath) is shown meeting and marrying Catherine De Medici, performing consummation of the marriage, jousting, and snuggling in the older Diane&#x27;s arms. Beginning with the fourth episode, older Henri is portrayed by Lee Ingleby.

<text>The Time Lords are a fictional ancient race of extraterrestrial people in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Time Lords are so named for their command of time travel technology and their non-linear perception of time.

Originally, they were described as a powerful and wise race from the planet Gallifrey, from which the Doctor was a renegade; details beyond this were very limited for the first decade of the series. They later became integral to many episodes and stories as their role in the universe developed. For the first eight years after the series resumed in 2005, the Time Lords were said to have been destroyed during the Last Great Time War at some point in the show&#x27;s continuity between the television movie in 1996 and the show&#x27;s revival. In 2013, the 50th anniversary special &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; concerned this supposed destruction and their eventual survival.

They developed a culture of custodianship and time-related technologies based on this perception which includes strictly controlled space/time travel machines (known as &quot;TARDISes&quot;) and monitoring devices to travel through time and to prevent time from being subverted or abused—although actual action was described as rare in practice due to their traditional policy of strict non-interference and neutrality. They can act to manipulate timelines of a wide range of events and individuals, so long as they do not cross back into their own timeline.

Over subsequent episodes their history, their development of time manipulation, and their internal politics were touched upon, with Time Lord society portrayed as a stagnated ceremony-bound oligarchy and their past having descended into myth and legend. The Doctor became at times an ally, being appointed their president during his fourth, fifth, and twelfth incarnations and assisting them on many other occasions.

In an audio commentary recorded for the 2009 DVD release of &quot;The War Games&quot; (1969), producer Derrick Sherwin mentioned how in a discussion with the serial&#x27;s co-writer Terrance Dicks the previous day, Dicks was &quot;absolutely certain&quot; that Sherwin created the Time Lords for the serial, although Sherwin could not remember himself. Later in the commentary, Dicks recalled Sherwin telling him in the discussions with Dicks and Dicks&#x27; fellow co-writer Malcolm Hulke that because the Doctor had always been established as being on the run from his own people, that if he has to appeal to them, the Doctor would be in trouble. In a 2016 interview with &quot;The Essential Doctor Who&quot; magazine, Dicks mentioned how when Sherwin and he were discussing &quot;The War Games&quot; one day, Sherwin said, &quot;He belongs to this mysterious race called the Time Lords, doesn&#x27;t he?&quot; with &quot;everything&quot; ultimately coming from that discussion. In &quot;The War Games&quot; DVD commentary, Sherwin mentioned that he recalled hearing about the Time Lords at the beginning of the series, but as no one else remembered this, it &quot;might have come out of [his] dreams&quot;.

Elaborating on this genesis in a 2014 interview in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, Sherwin said of &quot;The War Games&quot;, &quot;It was a case of what shall we do, how can we end this? Let&#x27;s go back to the beginning and say [the Doctor] was a Time Lord, a renegade Time Lord, a pain in the arse for the other Time Lords who stole his TARDIS and buggered off around the universe. So if he&#x27;s going to be called to book let&#x27;s bring in the Time Lords.&quot;

==Overview==
Early on in the series, the Doctor was identified as a human being; however, his home planet, which from the start of the series is explicitly established as not being Earth, was not named. In &quot;The War Games&quot; (1969), the Doctor&#x27;s people appeared, who from then on are known as a race called Time Lords, and in &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; (1970), the Doctor&#x27;s earlier description of himself as a human is retconned when the Third Doctor explicitly states that he is not human. In &quot;The Time Warrior&quot; (1973–1974), the name of the Doctor&#x27;s home planet, Gallifrey, was revealed on screen for the first time.

The Time Lords are considered one of the oldest and most technologically powerful races in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; universe. In &quot;The Time Warrior&quot;, the Time Lords are characterised by Sontaran military intelligence, quoted by Commander Linx, as &quot;a race of great technical achievement, but lacking the morale to withstand a determined assault&quot;. In &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Familiar&quot; (2015), Davros mentions a prophecy on the Doctor&#x27;s world that spoke of a hybrid made up of &quot;two great warrior races forced together to create a warrior greater than either&quot;, which is &quot;half-Dalek, half-Time Lord&quot;, while in &quot;Hell Bent&quot; (2015), the General, while describing the prophecy of the Hybrid, mentions the Time Lords as one of two warrior races along with the Daleks. In &quot;Before the Flood&quot; (2015), the Fisher King describes the Time Lords as &quot;cowardly, vain curators, who suddenly remembered they had teeth, and became the most warlike race in the galaxy&quot;. In the very distant past, the Time Lords fought a genocidal war against the Great Vampires, which led to such a catastrophic loss of life that the Time Lords renounced violence. In &quot;The War Games&quot;, the Second Doctor mentions that the Time Lords&#x27; &quot;great powers&quot; are hardly ever used due to their policy of non-intervention into the affairs of other planets, and that they instead observe and gather knowledge. Because of this, holding a trial is a &quot;very rare&quot; event for the Time Lords. Exceptions to this policy are made only in extreme circumstances when they feel they have to, such as where the Doctor calls them for help in the serial.

At the start of the 2005 television series, Gallifrey was thought to have been destroyed and the Time Lords functionally extinct as a result of a mutually destructive Time War with the Dalek race; the Ninth Doctor describes his planet as &quot;just rocks and dust&quot; in &quot;The End of the World&quot; (2005), and mentions in &quot;Dalek&quot; (2005) that the Time Lords &quot;burnt&quot; with the Daleks at the end of the &quot;Last Great Time War&quot;, and the Tenth Doctor tells the Master in &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot; (2007) that the Time Lords are &quot;dead&quot; and &quot;all [they&#x27;ve] got is each other&quot;. The Doctor describes himself as the last of his kind and says his planet burned on numerous other occasions, as do other individuals, such as the Krillitane Mr Finch in &quot;School Reunion&quot; (2006).

In &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot; (2005), the Ninth Doctor remarks that before Time Lords were &quot;all gone&quot;, they would have prevented or repaired paradoxes such as that which attracted the Reapers to 1987 Earth.

In &quot;Rise of the Cybermen&quot; (2006), the Tenth Doctor mentions, &quot;When the Time Lords kept their eye on everything, you could pop between realities, home in time for tea. Then they died, and took it all with them. Walls of reality closed, the worlds were sealed. Everything became that bit less kind.&quot; In &quot;The Satan Pit&quot; (2006), the Tenth Doctor states that his people &quot;practically invented black holes. Well, in fact, they did.&quot; Both the Beast (in &quot;The Satan Pit&quot;) and the Doctor (in &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot; and &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Wife&quot;, 2011) believe the Doctor ended the War by killing all of the Time Lords and many of the Daleks.

The Tenth Doctor&#x27;s artificially created &quot;daughter&quot; Jenny is speculated by Donna Noble in &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2008) to be a surviving Time Lord, though the Doctor initially rejects the suggestion.

Two other Time Lord-like beings appeared in &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; (2008): Donna, briefly empowered with the mind and knowledge of a Time Lord, and a half-human clone of the Tenth Doctor. Donna&#x27;s memories related to the Doctor, as well as her Time Lord knowledge, are buried in order to save her life, while the clone lives out his existence in a parallel universe with Rose Tyler.

&quot;The End of Time&quot; (2009–10) shows the High Council of Time Lords, led by Lord President Rassilon, attempting to escape the Time War by materialising Gallifrey in the place of Earth at Christmas. However, the Tenth Doctor destroys the device which allows their passage into the present, sending them back into the events of the Time War.

During the episode &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Wife&quot; it is revealed that several Time Lords and their TARDISes had been trapped and destroyed by an entity called House who lived in a separate bubble universe.

In &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot; (2011), it is revealed that the daughter of Amy Pond and Rory Williams, Melody Pond (who later goes by her transliterated name &quot;River Song&quot;), has been born with Time Lord-like genetic traits. An old acquaintance of the Doctor&#x27;s, Madame Vastra, reminds the Doctor that the Time Lord race developed due to their billions of years&#x27; exposure to the time vortex. The Doctor then recalls that Rory and Amy had spent their wedding night in the TARDIS; therefore it is theorised by Vastra that River&#x27;s conception mirrored that of the Time Lords&#x27; genesis and therefore she herself developed Time Lord genetic characteristics.

In &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot; (2013), it is shown that the Eighth Doctor regenerates into the War Doctor to fight in the Time War. Many years later, as shown during &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013) and also described by the Partisan in &quot;The End of Time&quot;, the War Doctor originally planned to use a Time Lord weapon known as the Moment to destroy the Time Lords and Daleks. However, after being shown the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors during &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, he works together with them to change the assumed outcome of the Time War: thirteen incarnations of the Doctor team up together to freeze Gallifrey in time and place it outside of their universe (protecting it and the remaining Time Lords), while the Daleks destroy themselves in their own crossfire once Gallifrey is gone. The War Doctor does not retain the memory of these events and the Doctor spends centuries believing he burnt Gallifrey until the Eleventh Doctor&#x27;s time; this is because the time streams are out of sync after the War Doctor meets his future selves and the altered events are only known to the Doctor once they occur in the Eleventh Doctor&#x27;s experience and become part of his memory. Indeed, earlier on in the episode, both the Tenth and the Eleventh Doctors mistakenly believe that the War Doctor killed all of the Time Lords on the last day of the Time War. After being informed that the plan to save Gallifrey was successful, the Eleventh Doctor sets out to find Gallifrey and restore the Time Lords.

In &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;, the Doctor visits the planet Trenzalore where he discovers a question being broadcast through all of time and space through a crack in the universe: &quot;Doctor Who?&quot; The Doctor realizes that the Time Lords are attempting to return to the universe and will come back if he speaks his true name. Due to &quot;half the universe&quot; surrounding Trenzalore, a siege begins that lasts centuries as the Doctor knows that if the Time Lords return, the Time War will begin anew. With the Doctor on the verge of death, Clara Oswald pleads with the Time Lords through the crack to intervene and save the Doctor. Through the crack, the Time Lords grant the Doctor a new regeneration cycle, saving his life before sealing the crack again.

In &quot;Hell Bent&quot; (2015), it is revealed that Gallifrey returned to the universe around the time of its end. After escaping his confession dial in &quot;Heaven Sent&quot; (2015), still furious over the death of Clara Oswald in &quot;Face the Raven&quot; (2015), the Doctor manages to depose Rassilon—who had put the Doctor there to begin with for questioning—and exile him in &quot;Hell Bent&quot; before running off again.

==Physical characteristics==
Time Lords and human beings look alike, however they differ in many respects. Physiological differences from humans include two hearts which normally beat at 170 beats per minute, and a &quot;respiratory bypass system&quot; that allows them to survive strangulation. The Twelfth Doctor was able to survive direct exposure to the vacuum of space in &quot;Oxygen&quot;. Time Lords also seem to have an increased resilience to higher frequencies of sound, as seen in &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot; and &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;. If severely injured, Time Lords can go into a healing coma which lowers their body temperature to below freezing which the Doctor did in &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot;. In the serial &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot;, Romana was able to voluntarily stop both of her hearts beating, to fool the Daleks into believing that she was dead. The Doctor also shows a greater tolerance to cold compared to humans in &quot;The Seeds of Doom&quot; and &quot;Planet of the Ood&quot; and even Romana in &quot;The Ribos Operation&quot;, and in &quot;42&quot;, the Tenth Doctor states he is able to survive at absolute zero for a short period of time. In &quot;World War Three&quot;, the Doctor is able to shake off an electrocution attempt which is fatal to a number of humans, and appears unaffected by the energy whip wielded by the Sycorax in &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;. In &quot;Smith and Jones&quot; the Tenth Doctor says that the radiation given off by X-rays pose no real threat to Time Lords, and proceeds to absorb an amount that would be lethal to a human, which he subsequently expels through his foot. &quot;The End of Time&quot; shows the Tenth Doctor as being capable of surviving (for a short period) a massive burst of radiation that would have killed anything else instantly. However, the radiation burst caused enough damage to start a regeneration.

Time Lords are extremely long-lived, routinely counting their ages in terms of centuries; the Second Doctor claimed in &quot;The War Games&quot; that Time Lords could live &quot;practically forever, barring accidents&quot;. The series has suggested that Time Lords have a different concept of ageing from humans. In &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot;, the Tenth Doctor refers to when who he thought was his original incarnation was a &quot;kid&quot; at 90 years old. However, within a specific incarnation, a Time Lord is able to age, albeit much more slowly than a human. The War Doctor and Eleventh Doctor, over the course of the Last Great Time War and the Battle of Trenzalore, respectively, are seen to age within their respective incarnations to what would appear to a human to be old age; both conflicts are suggested within the series to last hundreds if not thousands of Earth years.

In &quot;The Two Doctors&quot;, the Second Doctor states that the &quot;Rassilon Imprimatur&quot; allows Time Lords to safely travel through time, becoming symbionts with their TARDISes, and that the reason other species are incapable of developing time travel is that they lack the imprimatur. However, he implies later that he was lying about at least some of this information to mislead the Sontarans. At the beginning of &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;, the Sixth Doctor suggests that a number of elder Time Lords were able to use their combined mental energy to summon his TARDIS against his will.

In the episode &quot;Cold Blood&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor experiences excruciating pain when the Silurian attempts to decontaminate him of surface bacteria. The Doctor states this would kill him, most likely due to the scanners being programmed to &quot;detox&quot; humans and therefore being unaware of what elements the Doctor requires.

A Time Lord is able to conceal their Time Lord nature, and become a human, by using the Chameleon Arch – a device that stores their &quot;essence&quot; and memories in an innocuous device such as a fob watch, and replaces them with false counterparts until the object is later re-opened. The process allows them to disguise themselves as humans physiologically and psychologically, meaning they only have one heart and are stripped of non-human powers, and of any memory of having been a Time Lord. This story element was notably featured in Series 3; the Doctor uses it to hide himself from the Family of Blood and becomes a schoolteacher in Edwardian England. His nemesis the Master used it to disguise himself as a human to escape the Time War. The story element is later revisited in the Series 12 episode &quot;Fugitive of the Judoon&quot; when a mysterious, unknown incarnation of the Doctor (played by Jo Martin), is revealed to have been hiding on Earth as a tour guide named “Ruth Clayton” using a Chameleon Arch.

===Mental powers===
Time Lords can communicate by telepathy, and can link their minds to share information and enhance their powers. In &quot;Castrovalva&quot;, the Doctor activates the TARDIS&#x27; Zero Room mentally. Additionally, both the Doctor and the Master demonstrate significant hypnotic abilities which may be supplemented by their telepathic abilities.

These powers were elaborated upon from 2005. The Eleventh Doctor is seen using this method to query a cat about the goings-on of the flat in &quot;The Lodger&quot;. In &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot; and &quot;Closing Time&quot; he is apparently able to even understand babies, as well as horses in &quot;A Town Called Mercy&quot;. In &quot;The Girl in the Fireplace&quot;, the Tenth Doctor reads the mind of Madame de Pompadour—and in the process, to his surprise, she is able to read his mind as well. In &quot;The End of Time&quot;, the Master uses the same technique, allowing the Tenth Doctor to hear the drumming sound the Master constantly hears. The Doctor later displays his telepathic communion powers in &quot;Fear Her&quot; and in &quot;The Shakespeare Code&quot;, where by using his mind melding technique he is partially able to relieve a man of his mental illness as he traces back through his memories. In &quot;Planet of the Ood&quot;, the Tenth Doctor seems able to temporarily confer some degree of telepathy on his companion Donna Noble, so that she can hear the telepathic song of the Ood. When she is unable to bear the song, the Doctor removes the ability.

In &quot;The Lodger&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor (pressed for time and needing to convey a great deal of information to someone) smashed his forehead into another person&#x27;s forehead, causing a massive instantaneous transfer of information.

The Doctor also contacts the Time Lords by going into a trance and creating an assembling box in &quot;The War Games&quot;. In &quot;The Two Doctors&quot;, the Doctor engages in astral projection, but warns that if he is disturbed while doing so, his mind could become severed from his body and he could die. In &quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot;, the Doctor telepathically interfaces with a network tapped into the human population who collectively chant his name. The focus of psychic energy granted the Doctor the ability to de-age himself, float through the air, deflect shots from the Master&#x27;s laser screwdriver, and telekinetically disarm the Master.

In addition, Time Lords may be clairvoyant, or have additional time-related senses. In &quot;The Time Monster&quot;, and &quot;Invasion of the Dinosaurs&quot;, the Third Doctor is able to resist fields of slow time, being able to move through them even though others are paralysed. In &quot;City of Death&quot;, both the Fourth Doctor and Romana notice distortions and jumps in time that no one else does.

In the 2005 series, the Ninth Doctor claims that he can sense the movement of the Earth through space as well as being able to perceive the past and all possible futures. He is also able to concentrate and time his motions well enough to step safely through the blades of a rapidly spinning fan, and later claims that if any Time Lords still existed, he would be able to sense them. As the Tenth Doctor he repeats this assertion, adding also that he is somehow innately able to sense which events in time are &#x27;fixed&#x27; and which are in &#x27;flux&#x27;. The Eleventh Doctor slightly amends what was said earlier in &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Wife&quot;, saying that he could only sense if there were other Time Lords in this universe. In the original series episode &quot;Warriors&#x27; Gate&quot;, Romana is called a &#x27;time-sensitive&#x27; by a marauding slaver and, though she seems to deny this, is able to interface with his spaceship in ways that only a &#x27;time-sensitive&#x27; is supposed to be able to. In &quot;Utopia&quot;, the Tenth Doctor states that he finds it difficult to look at Captain Jack Harkness because Jack&#x27;s existence has become fixed in time and space.

In the Series 4 episode &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, the Tenth Doctor was shown to use his telepathic abilities to wipe Donna Noble&#x27;s mind of certain memories, specifically the memories of her travels in the TARDIS and to &#x27;implant&#x27; a defence mechanism which is activated in &quot;The End of Time&quot;. &quot;The War Games&quot; showed that other Time Lords are also able to erase people&#x27;s memories, as in that story, Jamie and Zoe&#x27;s travels with the Doctor were erased from their memory, and the council of Time Lords also put a memory block on the Doctor so he could not pilot the TARDIS. In the Series 5 episode &quot;The Big Bang&quot; the Doctor telepathically left a message in Amy Pond&#x27;s head before sealing her into the Pandorica so that she would know what was happening when she woke up.

===Regeneration===
Time Lords also have the ability to regenerate their bodies when their current body is mortally wounded. This process results in their body undergoing a transformation, gaining a new physical form and a new personality.

Regenerations can be traumatic. In &quot;Castrovalva&quot;, the Fifth Doctor requires the use of a Zero Room, a chamber shielded from the outside universe that provides an area of calm for him to recuperate. The Time Lord&#x27;s personality also sometimes goes through a period of instability following a regeneration, such as in &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;.

It was first stated in &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; that a Time Lord can regenerate twelve times (thirteen incarnations in all). There were exceptions to this rule, however: when the Master reached the end of his regenerative cycle, he took possession of the body of another person to continue living. In &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, the Master was offered a new cycle of regenerations by the High Council to save the Doctor from the Death Zone, which may indicate that there are methods to circumvent the twelve regeneration limit. The Master says in &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot; that the Time Lords &quot;resurrected&quot; him to fight in the Time War. It was revealed in &quot;The Brain of Morbius&quot; that the Time Lords also use the Elixir of Life in extreme cases, where regeneration is not possible. It is confirmed in &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot; that a Time Lord can normally regenerate only twelve times but that the Time Lords have the ability to grant more regenerations: at the behest of Clara Oswald they granted the Doctor himself a new cycle when he was at the point of death from old age, having used up his entire cycle.

Regeneration, regardless of how many regenerations the individual Time Lord has already undergone, is a conditional and non-inevitable phenomenon. This is stated in &quot;The End of Time&quot; when the Tenth Doctor explains to Wilfred Mott that a Time Lord can die before they have a chance to regenerate, in which case they die outright. In &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; at least one of the murders was carried out with a &#x27;staser&#x27;, possibly a weapon designed to both kill and prevent regeneration (stasers are also stated to have little effect on non-living tissue). In the Series 4 episode &quot;Turn Left&quot;, the Tenth Doctor&#x27;s body is shown on a stretcher following the parallel events of &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot;. A UNIT officer states that the Doctor&#x27;s death must have been too quick to allow for regeneration.

In &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot;, Romana showed the ability to rapidly change form several times in a row during her first regeneration, and apparently had the ability to change into whatever appearance she desired. When the Doctor remarks upon her ability, she comments that he should have stayed in university. However, despite showing several appearances, Romana regenerated only once on that occasion.

In &quot;Utopia&quot;, the Master, just before regeneration, claimed that he would become &quot;young and strong&quot;, implying that he could choose the form of his new body. The human-Time Lord hybrid River Song in &quot;Let&#x27;s Kill Hitler&quot; claimed she was &quot;focusing on a dress size&quot;, but subsequently weighed herself, seeming unsure of how her new body had truly developed. The Doctor said on several occasions he wished he was &quot;ginger&quot;, which he has seemed unable to control in previous regenerations. In &quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot;, when the Master is fatally wounded, he chooses not to regenerate, essentially committing suicide rather than regenerate and be kept prisoner by the Doctor forever. This again implies that regeneration is not inevitable and can indeed be refused.

Upon encountering the remains of fellow Time Lord the Corsair in &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Wife&quot;, the Doctor refers to the Corsair as both male and female, hinting that Time Lords can switch genders upon their regenerations; this is confirmed in &quot;Dark Water&quot;, in which the Master, previously seen in various male incarnations for over forty years, returned as a female. The Doctor also regenerated as a woman in &quot;Twice Upon A Time&quot;, as the Thirteenth Doctor.

Whether or not Time Lords can recognise each other across regenerations is not made entirely clear:
* In &quot;The War Games&quot;, the War Chief recognises the Second Doctor from a previous (offscreen) encounter prior to his regeneration. However, his comments make it unclear whether he has merely deduced the Doctor&#x27;s identity based on the circumstances of the TARDIS&#x27;s theft and the Doctor&#x27;s ability to pilot it.
* In &quot;The Three Doctors&quot;, the Second Doctor recognises the Third Doctor immediately, despite the fact that the Third Doctor is a future incarnation of himself. Omega is similarly able to recognise the two Doctors as the same man.
* In &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot;, the Third Doctor fails to recognise The Master&#x27;s voice, when the Master speaks to him on a telephone.
* In &quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot;, the Third Doctor has trouble recognising his former mentor.
* In &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;, Announcer Runcible, an old classmate, recognises the Fourth Doctor despite his changes in appearance and mentions that the Doctor appears to have had a &quot;face lift&quot; since they last met.
* In &quot;The Armageddon Factor&quot;, Drax, another alumnus immediately recognises the Fourth Doctor, though the Doctor does not recognise him.
* In &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, the First Doctor does not recognise the Fifth Doctor as himself and needs to be introduced. Likewise, the Third Doctor is unable to initially recognise the Master in his non-Gallifreyan body.
* In &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot;, the Doctor&#x27;s old friend Azmael fails to recognise him, as the Doctor has regenerated twice since their last encounter.
* In &quot;The Two Doctors&quot;, when the Sixth Doctor and Second Doctor first meet, they are initially quiet until they face each other and simultaneously yell at each other, each recognising immediately the other.
* In &quot;Survival&quot;, the Master recognises the Seventh Doctor on sight.
* In &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (1996), the Eighth Doctor is unable to recognise the Master while he possesses a human body, only recognising the Master when he corrects Grace&#x27;s grammar.
* In &quot;Utopia&quot;, the Tenth Doctor does not recognise the human form of the Master, although the Doctor did recognise him, and name him &quot;Master&quot;, as soon as he recovered his Time Lord physiology and mind.
* In &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot;, the Doctor states that Time Lords can &quot;always&quot; recognise each other, although, while on Earth, the Master used satellites with a telepathic network to mask his presence from the Doctor. The Doctor in this circumstance appears to only be referring to recognition of the individual as a Time Lord, not necessarily the specific identity. However, when he sees the Master on television, he recognises him.
* In &quot;Time Crash&quot;, the Fifth Doctor could not instinctively recognise that the Tenth Doctor was a Time Lord, much less one of his own later incarnations.
* In &quot;The Next Doctor&quot;, the Tenth Doctor initially seems unable to detect that the human Jackson Lake, who identifies himself as the Doctor, is not actually his regenerated future self.
* In &quot;The End of Time&quot;, the Doctor immediately recognises an unidentified elderly female Time Lord on sight, and also refers to the lead Time Lord by the name Rassilon (an earlier incarnation of Rassilon had appeared in &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;). In the context of the story, however, he may have encountered both during the Time War, though he himself has regenerated since they last saw him. Rassilon and the woman recognised the Doctor on sight as well, but the Doctor&#x27;s presence, regardless of incarnation, was expected.
* In &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, the Tenth Doctor appears to sceptically recognise his successor, yet he appears to be fully convinced only after both compare their sonic screwdrivers. The War Doctor, on the other hand, is initially oblivious to meet his future incarnations and mistaking them for future companions (but is later convinced otherwise after comparing their sonic screwdrivers).
* In &quot;Dark Water&quot;, the Twelfth Doctor is unable to recognise the Master until she reveals her identity.
* In &quot;Twice Upon A Time&quot;, the First Doctor sees the Twelfth Doctor as another Time Lord come to take back his TARDIS and requires convincing as to otherwise.
*In &quot;Spyfall&quot;, the Thirteenth Doctor is unable to recognize the Master until he reveals his identity.

In &quot;The Impossible Astronaut&quot;, a future version of the Eleventh Doctor is shot, causing him to begin his regeneration cycle. He is shot again before the regeneration completes, causing him to die instantly. However, in &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot;, it is revealed this was a shape shifting android the Doctor used to fake his death, making this questionable.
In cases of non-fatal injury, Time Lords who have recently regenerated can use left over cellular energy to heal and even regrow severed limbs, as seen in &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot; where the Tenth Doctor regrows a hand. Also seen in &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, is the apparent ability to siphon off regeneration energy in order to cancel the effect of changing appearance; which requires them to have a &quot;bio-matching receptacle&quot; (in this case the Doctor&#x27;s severed hand), which is usually impractical. However, this &quot;non-regeneration&quot; was revealed as &quot;counting&quot; towards the Doctor&#x27;s twelve possible regenerations during the events of &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;.

In &quot;The End of Time&quot;, the Tenth Doctor was able to postpone his regeneration long enough so that he could travel in time and space to see his past companions for one last time before he regenerated. The Fifth Doctor had also shown a similar ability in &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot;, fighting off the effects of an impending regeneration so he can return to Androzani Minor to save his companion Peri.

Time Lords appear to have the ability to stay conscious for moments after events that would outright kill other lifeforms instantly, giving them the opportunity to regenerate. This is seen in &quot;Logopolis&quot; (fall from a great height), and &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; (fatal disease). In both &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot; and &quot;The Big Bang&quot;, the Doctor is shot by a Dalek&#x27;s energy weapon, which has almost always been shown to instantly kill any other lifeform, yet is still conscious and able to return to return to the TARDIS and Pandorica respectively.

In &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor responds to a question from Clyde Langer by saying he can regenerate &quot;507&quot; times. Early news reports, before the episode was broadcast, suggested he would say there is no limit to the number of regenerations. Writer Russell T Davies stated in an interview with &quot;SFX&quot; that the line was not intended to be taken seriously and is instead a commentary. He said that the &quot;thirteen lives&quot; rule was too deeply entrenched in the viewer consciousness for his throwaway line to affect it.

It is revealed in &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot; that this was in fact false and that due to his various regenerations, the Eleventh Doctor was in fact his last incarnation. However, the Time Lords intervened through a crack in time to grant him a full new regeneration cycle. The revelation in 2020&#x27;s &quot;The Timeless Children&quot; that The Doctor is, in fact, not Gallifreyan and instead had their DNA used to give Gallifreyans the ability to regenerate, calls into doubt whether or not the Doctor does in fact have a limit to their regenerations, or if they merely believed they did due to all other Time Lords being limited.

==Planet==

The Time Lord homeworld, Gallifrey, is an Earth-like planet in the fictional constellation of Kasterborous. It is located in a binary star system 250 million light years from Earth. The points in time when Gallifrey appears are never definitively stated. As the planet is often reached by means of time travel, its relative present could conceivably exist almost anywhere in the Earth&#x27;s past or future.

From space, Gallifrey is seen as a yellow-orange planet and was close enough to central space lanes for spacecraft to require clearance from Gallifreyan Space Traffic Control as they pass through its system. The planet was protected from physical attack by an impenetrable barrier called the quantum force field, and from teleportation incursions by the transduction barrier—which could be reinforced to repel most levels of this type of technological attack.

The Doctor&#x27;s granddaughter Susan first describes her home world (not named as &quot;Gallifrey&quot; at the time) as having bright, silver-leafed trees and a burnt orange sky at night in the serial &quot;The Sensorites&quot; (1964). This casts an amber tint on anything outside the city, as seen in &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot;. However, Gallifrey&#x27;s sky appears blue and Earth-like in &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983) within the isolated Death Zone.

In &quot;Gridlock&quot;, the Tenth Doctor echoes Susan&#x27;s description of the world now named as Gallifrey and goes further by mentioning the vast mountain ranges &quot;with fields of deep red grass, capped with snow&quot;. He then elaborates how Gallifrey&#x27;s second sun would &quot;rise in the south and the mountains would shine&quot;, with the silver-leafed trees looking like &quot;a forest on fire&quot; in the mornings.

==Culture and society==
The capital city is referred to as the Citadel, and contains the Capitol, the seat of Time Lord government. At the centre of the Capitol is the Panopticon, beneath which is the Eye of Harmony. Outside the Capitol lie wastelands where the &quot;Outsiders&quot;, Time Lords who have dropped out of Time Lord society, live in less technologically advanced communities, shunning life in the cities as revealed in &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot;.

There are also Time Lords, such as The Doctor himself, The Master, The Rani, and others, who, having rejected the rules of the Time Lords&#x27; High Council (for whatever reason), cast off or stop using their name and take on a new name or title, and only use their original name under certain circumstances. Their new names are indicative of their characters and goals (for The Doctor, his title referring to a &#x27;doctor&#x27;, a &#x27;healer&#x27;, a &#x27;wise man&#x27;). The Doctor also testified, in &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, that his taking on the name of &#x27;Doctor&#x27; was also a promise to himself (&quot;Never cruel nor cowardly&quot;, &quot;Never give up. Never give in&quot;); and in &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot; and &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, it is highlighted that, when &#x27;The Doctor&#x27; became &#x27;The War Doctor&#x27; (&quot;A Warrior&quot;, &quot;Doctor No-more&quot;), he stopped thinking of himself as &#x27;The Doctor&#x27; until after the climax of &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (&quot;I am &#x27;The Doctor&#x27; again&quot;). 

The &quot;Doctor Who Roleplaying Game&quot; by FASA equates the Outsiders with the &quot;Shobogans&quot;, a group mentioned briefly in &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; as being responsible for acts of vandalism around the Panopticon, but there is actually nothing on screen that explicitly connects the two. 

In &quot;The Timeless Children&quot; (2020), it is revealed that the Shobogans were the first race of peoples who resided on Gallifrey, only becoming the Time Lords after gene-splicing the ability to regenerate from the Doctor.

Romana and the Doctor have also referred to &quot;Time Tots&quot;, or infant Time Lords, and (in &quot;Smith and Jones&quot;) the Doctor refers his compatriots and he playing &quot;with Röntgen bricks in the nursery&quot;. In &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot;, the Master is seen as a child, apparently at the age of 8.

In general, the Time Lords are an people, with a society full of pomp and ceremony. The Doctor has observed that his people &quot;enjoy making speeches&quot; and have an &quot;infinite capacity for pretension&quot;.

The Sixth Doctor has also characterised the Time Lords as a stagnant and corrupt society, a state caused by ten million years of absolute power. Their portrayal in the series is reminiscent of academics living in ivory towers, unconcerned with external affairs. The Doctor states that the Time Lords were sworn never to interfere, only to watch. It has been suggested that, since perfecting the science of time travel, they have withdrawn, bound by the moral complexity of interfering in the natural flow of history; in &quot;Earthshock&quot;, the Cyberleader, when notified of the arrival of a TARDIS, is surprised at the presence of a Time Lord, stating &quot;they are forbidden to interfere&quot;. In &quot;The Two Doctors&quot;, it is suggested that Time Lords are responsible for maintaining a general balance of power between the races of the Universe.

While interference is apparently against Time Lord policy, there are occasions when they do intervene, albeit indirectly through their CIA or Celestial Intervention Agency. The CIA has occasionally sent the Doctor on missions that required plausible deniability, as in &quot;The Two Doctors&quot;, and sometimes against his will, as in &quot;Colony in Space&quot; and &quot;The Monster of Peladon&quot;. He is also sent on a mission in &quot;The Mutants&quot; which was intended to help preserve the existence of a unique race, which was being destroyed by the excesses of the Earth empire. The Doctor&#x27;s mission in &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; even involves changing history to avert the creation of the Daleks, or at least temper their aggressiveness.

Children of Gallifrey are taken from their families at the age of 8 and admitted into the Academy. Novices are then taken to an initiation ceremony before the Untempered Schism, a gap in the fabric of reality that looks into the time vortex. Of those that stare into it, some are inspired, some run away and others go mad. The Doctor suggests that the Master went mad, while admitting that he ran away.

Each Time Lord belongs to one of a number of various colleges or chapters, such as the Patrexes, Arcalian, and the Prydonian chapters, which have ceremonial and possibly political significance. In &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;, it is explained that each chapter has its own colours; the Prydonians wear scarlet and orange, the Arcalians wear green, and the Patrexeans wear heliotrope. However, in that same serial, Cardinal Borusa, described as &quot;the leader of the Prydonian chapter&quot;, wears heliotrope. Other Prydonians wear orange headdresses with orange-brown (not scarlet) robes. The colleges of the Academy are led by the Cardinals. Ushers, who provide security and assistance at official Time Lord functions, may belong to any chapter, and wear all-gold uniforms. Also mentioned in &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; are &#x27;plebeian classes&#x27;.

The executive political leadership is split between the Lord President, who keeps the ceremonial relics of the Time Lords, and the Chancellor, who appears to be the administrative leader of the Cardinals and who acts as a check on the power of the Lord President. The President is an elected position; on Presidential Resignation Day, the outgoing President usually names his successor, who is then usually confirmed in a non-contested &quot;election&quot;, but it is still constitutionally possible for another candidate to put themselves forward for the post, as the Doctor did in &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;. In that story, the Presidency was described as a largely ceremonial role, but in &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot; the orders of the office were to be obeyed without question. In the event the current Lord President is unable to name a successor, the council can appoint a President to take his place. In &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, the council appoints the Doctor as president after Borusa is imprisoned by Rassilon, and later deposed him after he neglected his duties.

The President and Chancellor also sit on the Time Lord High Council, akin to a legislative body, composed variously of Councillors and more senior Cardinals. Also on the High Council is the Castellan of the Chancellery Guard, in charge of the security of the Citadel, whom the Doctor has referred to as the leader of a trumped-up palace guard. According to the constitution, if while in emergency session the other members of the High Council are in unanimous agreement, even the President&#x27;s orders can be overruled.

===Race or title===
The television series and people involved in its production repeatedly refer to the Time Lords, interchangeably, as a species or race, including the Doctor, his enemies, and other time lords.

The crew has also repeated this statement, including Malcolm Hulke and Terrance Dicks, Derrick Sherwin, and Russell T Davies, and 

&quot;The Stolen Tardis&quot; (1979), a spin-off comic printed in issue No. 9 of &quot;Doctor Who Weekly&quot; (the original name of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;) also claims that &quot;not everyone on Gallifrey is a Time Lord&quot;, while a feature in issue No. 21 instead states that the Doctor is &quot;a member of a race called the Time Lords&quot;.

==Technology==
The Moment was claimed by the Time Lords to be the most powerful weapon in the Universe and capable of destroying entire galaxies. The Moment was locked in Gallifrey&#x27;s Time Vaults, specifically in the Omega Arsenal. The Moment is so powerful that the weapon&#x27;s operating system became sentient, leading the Time Lords to wonder &quot;How do you use a weapon when it can stand in judgement of you?&quot; and that &quot;only one man would be mad enough to try it&quot;. In the 50th anniversary special &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, the War Doctor breaks into the Omega Arsenal, steals the Moment and is about to destroy both Time Lords and Daleks alike to stop the Time War before the Moment engineers a meeting with his succeeding regenerations to convince him otherwise.

Another impressive example of Time Lord technology is the Eye of Harmony, a repurposed black hole singularity contained within the instrumentality below the Panopticon. This is the source of their power and the anchor of the Web of Time itself, created by Rassilon and the co-founders of Time Lord society in the distant past. The Time Lords were accomplished stellar engineers and could control the development of stars with devices like the Hand of Omega, which was shown to be capable of forcing a star to go supernova. The Eye of Harmony exists within the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS as a collapsing star suspended in a permanent state of decay, hence harnessing the potential energy of a collapse that would never occur. Whether these are all aspects of the Eye of Harmony on Gallifrey or individual stars in their own right is not made clear on screen. 

Paradoxically, although the Time Lords are a scientifically and technologically advanced race, the civilisation is so old that key pieces of their technology have become shrouded in legend and myth. In the spin-off fiction, an edict and general aversion against exploring Gallifrey&#x27;s past also contributes to this. Accordingly, until the Master rediscovers it, the Time Lords forgot that the location of the Eye of Harmony is beneath their capital. They also treated such ceremonial symbols as the Key and Sash of Rassilon as mere historical curiosities, being unaware of their true function. 

In the revived series, there were instances in which evil alien species have stolen Time Lord technology for their own purposes but such is its complexity that they are unable to operate it, as illustrated in &quot;Doomsday&quot; when the Genesis Ark was stolen by the Daleks and even they could not open it. Furthermore, the Genesis Ark was just one Time Lord prison that held millions of Daleks, demonstrating &quot;bigger on the inside than it is on the outside&quot; Time Lord technology. The classic series also makes reference to the inability of other races to successfully use Time Lord technology, with &quot;The Two Doctors&quot; stating that even if a race managed to copy and build their own TARDISes, they would be ripped apart by the molecular stresses of time travel as all TARDISes have a fail-deadly approach to unauthorised use unless primed with a Rassilon Imprimatur, creating a symbiotic link to a specific Time Lord.

During the final hours of the Time War, the High Council of Gallifrey refer to defenses called &#x27;Sky Trenches&#x27; which appear to be at least somewhat effective against invading Daleks and/or their ships, as seen in &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;.

TARDISes are characterised not just by their ability to travel in time, but also their dimensionally transcendent nature. A TARDIS&#x27; interior spaces exist in a different dimension from its exterior, allowing it to appear to be bigger on the inside. The Doctor states that transdimensional engineering was a key Time Lord discovery in &quot;The Robots of Death&quot;. The Doctor states in &quot;The Impossible Planet&quot; that TARDISes are grown, not made. It is seen in &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot; that as a TARDIS dies, its &#x27;dimension dams&#x27; can break down causing a &#x27;size leak&#x27; wherein the exterior dimensions of a TARDIS begin to expand to match its inner dimensions.

Fitting their generally defensive nature, Time Lord weapons technology is rarely seen, other than the staser hand weapons used by the Guard within the Capitol.

Standard TARDISes do not generally seem to use any on-board weaponry, although War or Battle TARDISes (armed with &quot;time torpedoes&quot; that freeze their target in time) have appeared in the spin-off media. In the novels, the Eighth Doctor&#x27;s companion Compassion, a living TARDIS, has enough firepower to annihilate other TARDISes. In the serial &quot;Castrovalva&quot;, the Master&#x27;s TARDIS is equipped with an energy field that he uses to temporarily disable or stun several human security guards outside the vessel.

One exception to the Time Lords&#x27; defensive weaponry is the de-mat gun (or dematerialisation gun). The de-mat gun is a weapon of mass destruction that removes its target from space-time altogether, as seen in &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot;. The de-mat gun was created in Rassilon&#x27;s time and is a closely guarded secret; the knowledge to create one is kept in the Matrix and is available only to the President. To make sure this knowledge is not abused, the only way to arm a de-mat gun is by means of the Great Key of Rassilon, whose location is only known to the Chancellor. As a means of extreme sanction, the Time Lords have also been known to place whole planets into time-loops, isolating them from the universe in one repeating moment of time as well as hurling planets from one galaxy to another using a weapon referred only as a magnetron in &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;.

In the &quot;Doctor Who Annual 2006&quot;, a section by Russell T Davies says that during the Time War, the Time Lords used Bowships (used against the Great Vampires in an ancient war), Black Hole Carriers and N-Forms (war machines first mentioned in the Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Damaged Goods&quot;, written by Davies).

In &quot;The End of Time&quot;, Rassilon is shown wearing a gauntlet with several powers, primarily the ability to disintegrate a target and the ability to reverse changes made to the human race by the Master. When Rassilon throws the white point star into the hologram of the Earth, the diamond is able to arrive at the planet by following the Master&#x27;s signal, travelling through the time-locked war to the post-war universe.

Gallifreyan paintings were unique in that they were in 3D, as they acted as snapshots of a single moment in time by use of stasis cubes. This meant that they could be used as rudimentary time travel, by freezing a person inside a painting and then letting them out at the required point in time. An example of this is &quot;Gallifrey Falls No More&quot; as seen in &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;.

==History==

Details of the Time Lords&#x27; history within the show are sketchy and are fraught with supposition and contradiction. The series 12 finale &quot;The Timeless Children&quot; (2020) reveals the Time Lords were originally members of the Shobogan race who were genetically altered with the genetic code of &quot;The Timeless Child&quot;, a being that later came to be known as the Doctor. The Time Lords became the masters of time travel when one of their number, the scientist Omega, created an energy source to power their experiments in time. To this end, Omega used a stellar manipulation device, the Hand of Omega, to rework a nearby star into a new form to serve that source. Unfortunately, the star flared, first into a supernova, and then collapsed into a black hole. Omega was thought killed in that explosion but unknown to everyone, had somehow survived in an anti-matter universe beyond the black hole&#x27;s singularity. Rassilon, the ultimate founder of Time Lord society, then took a singularity (assumed by fans and the spin-off media to be the same one as Omega&#x27;s) and placed it beneath the Time Lords&#x27; citadel on Gallifrey. This perfectly balanced Eye of Harmony then served as the power source for their civilisation as well as their time machines.

At some point in their history the Time Lords interacted with the civilisation of the planet Minyos, giving them advanced technology (including the ability to &quot;regenerate&quot; to a limited degree, by rejuvenating their bodies when they grow too old). This met with disastrous results, (which is said to be the reason the Time Lords adopted a philosophy of &quot;non-interference&quot;). The Minyans destroyed themselves in a series of nuclear wars.

In &quot;Dalek&quot; (2005), the Ninth Doctor explains that his people perished along with the Dalek race in the &quot;Last Great Time War&quot;, leaving the Doctor the last of his race. In &quot;The Satan Pit&quot; (2006), the Beast identifies the Tenth Doctor as &quot;the killer of his own kind&quot;. In &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot; (2007), the Master reveals he escaped the war by turning himself into a human following the Dalek Emperor taking control of the Cruciform. In &quot;The End of Time&quot; (2009–10), the Time Lords, after attempting to break out the time lock of the Time War and become creatures of consciousness, are shown being sent back into the War on the last day through the Tenth Doctor&#x27;s intervention. The Master also disappears along with them. Rassilon describes Time Lord history in this story as having lasted &quot;a billion years&quot; up until the end of the Time War.

In &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013), thirteen incarnations of the Doctor are shown successfully attempting to freeze the Time Lords and their home world of Gallifrey in time, by transporting them to a &quot;parallel pocket universe&quot; using their TARDISes. Because the time streams are out of sync, the Doctor does not retain the memory of this until his eleventh incarnation. Indeed, earlier on in the episode, both the Tenth and the Eleventh Doctors mistakenly believe that the War Doctor killed all of the Time Lords on the last day of the Time War. While the plan is being outlined, the War Doctor notes that to the rest of the universe, it only appears as if the Time Lords and Daleks had mutually destroyed each other, when in fact, the Daleks had fired upon themselves in the crossfire after Gallifrey vanished, ending in the destruction of most of their own race, but not the Time Lords. In &quot;Death in Heaven&quot; (2014), the Master, now regenerated into a female form called &quot;Missy&quot;, explains that when the Doctor saved Gallifrey, this caused the Doctor to save her as well. She bluffs the Twelfth Doctor into thinking that Gallifrey has returned to its original co-ordinates, but when the Doctor goes looking, he finds nothing there.

In &quot;Face the Raven&quot; (2015), the immortal Ashildr makes a deal to have the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS keys and confession dial taken and to teleport the Twelfth Doctor away in exchange for her trap street&#x27;s safety. In &quot;Heaven Sent&quot; (2015), the Twelfth Doctor escapes his confession dial and finds himself near the Citadel on Gallifrey. He tells a young child to inform the Time Lords that he knows what they have done and that he has returned &quot;the long way around&quot;. He then tells the Time Lords through his confession dial the hybrid they fear &quot;is me&quot;. In &quot;Hell Bent&quot; (2015), Gallifrey is revealed to have come back from the pocket universe it was frozen in and exist at the end of the universe. Rassilon is revealed to have been the one who had the Doctor teleported into the confession dial.

In &quot;Spyfall&quot; (2020), the Master reveals that he returned to Gallifrey, slaughtered the population and devastated the planet in his rage over discovering the truth about the Time Lords’ origins and the identity of the Timeless Child. Later, in &quot;The Timeless Children&quot; (2020), the Master lures the Thirteenth Doctor back to Gallifrey, opening a path for the Cybermen to invade and convert the bodies of deceased Time Lords to create CyberMasters - a subrace of Cybermen capable of regeneration. The Doctor, after being shown the truth about their past, plants an explosive in the Citadel, seemingly destroying the CyberMasters and the Master while rendering Gallifrey devoid of any organic life.

<doc id="75917" wikidata="Q1128259" url="?curid=75917" title="Magnet therapy">
<text>Magnetic therapy is a pseudoscientific alternative medicine practice involving the weak static magnetic field produced by a permanent magnet which is placed on the body. It is similar to the alternative medicine practice of electromagnetic therapy, which uses a magnetic field generated by an electrically powered device. Magnet therapy products may include wristbands, jewelry, blankets, and wraps that have magnets incorporated into them.

Practitioners claim that subjecting certain parts of the body to weak electric or magnetic fields has beneficial health effects. These physical and biological claims are unproven and no effects on health or healing have been established. Although hemoglobin, the blood protein that carries oxygen, is weakly diamagnetic (when oxygenated) or paramagnetic (when deoxygenated), the magnets used in magnetic therapy are many orders of magnitude too weak to have any measurable effect on blood flow.
This is not to be confused with transcranial magnetic stimulation, a scientifically valid form of therapy, or with pulsed electromagnetic field therapy.

== Methods of application ==

Magnet therapy involves applying the weak magnetic field of permanent magnets to the body, for purported health benefits. Different effects are assigned to different orientations of the magnet.

Products include magnetic bracelets and jewelry; magnetic straps for wrists, ankles, knees, and back; shoe insoles; mattresses; magnetic blankets (blankets with magnets woven into the material); magnetic creams; magnetic supplements; plasters/patches and water that has been &quot;magnetized&quot;. These products generally use neodymium and ferrite magnets and the application is usually performed by the patient.

It is similar to the alternative medicine practice of electromagnetic therapy, which uses the weak electric or magnetic fields as well, but generated by electrically powered devices.

== Suggested mechanisms of action ==
Perhaps the most common suggested mechanism is that magnets might improve blood flow in underlying tissues. The field surrounding magnet therapy devices is far too weak and falls off with distance far too quickly to appreciably affect hemoglobin, other blood components, muscle tissue, bones, blood vessels, or organs. A 1991 study on humans of static field strengths up to 1 T found no effect on local blood flow. Tissue oxygenation is similarly unaffected. Some practitioners claim that the magnets can restore the body&#x27;s hypothetical &quot;electromagnetic energy balance&quot;, but no such balance is medically recognized. Even in the magnetic fields used in magnetic resonance imaging, which are many times stronger, none of the claimed effects are observed. If the body were meaningfully affected by the weak magnets used in magnet therapy, MRI would be impractical.

== Efficacy ==
Several studies have been conducted in recent years to investigate what role, if any, static magnetic fields may play in health and healing. Unbiased studies of magnetic therapy are problematic, since magnetisation can be easily detected, for instance, by the attraction forces on ferrous (iron-containing) objects; because of this, effective blinding of studies (where neither patients nor assessors know who is receiving treatment versus placebo) is difficult. Incomplete or insufficient blinding tends to exaggerate treatment effects, particularly where any such effects are small. Health claims regarding longevity and cancer treatment are implausible and unsupported by any research. More mundane health claims, most commonly about anecdotal pain relief, also lack any credible proposed mechanism and clinical research is not promising.

The American Cancer Society states that &quot;available scientific evidence does not support these claims&quot;. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, studies of magnetic jewelry have not shown demonstrable effects on pain, nerve function, cell growth or blood flow.

A 2008 systematic review of magnet therapy for all indications found insufficient evidence to determine whether magnet therapy is effective for pain relief, as did 2012 reviews focused on osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. These reviews found that the data was either inconclusive or did not support a significant effect of magnet therapy. They also raised concerns about allocation concealment, small sample sizes, inadequate blinding, and heterogeneity of results, some of which may have biased results.

== Safety ==
These devices are generally considered safe in themselves, though there can be significant financial and opportunity costs to magnet therapy, especially when treatment or diagnosis are avoided or delayed. Use is not recommended with pacemakers, insulin pumps, and other devices that may be negatively affected by magnetic fields.

== Reception ==
The worldwide magnet therapy industry totals sales of over a billion dollars per year, including $300 million per year in the United States alone.

A 2002 U.S. National Science Foundation report on public attitudes and understanding of science noted that magnet therapy is &quot;not at all scientific.&quot; A number of vendors make unsupported claims about magnet therapy by using pseudoscientific and new-age language. Such claims are unsupported by the results of scientific and clinical studies.

=== Legal regulations ===
Marketing of any therapy as effective treatment for any condition is heavily restricted by law in many jurisdictions unless all such claims are scientifically validated. In the United States, for example, U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations prohibit marketing any magnet therapy product using medical claims, as such claims are unfounded.

<text>John Lindley Byrne (; born July 6, 1950) is a British-born American comic book writer and artist of superhero comics. Since the mid-1970s, Byrne has worked on many major superheroes; with noted work on Marvel Comics&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. Byrne also facilitated the 1986 relaunch of DC Comics&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; franchise with the limited series &quot;The Man of Steel&quot;, the first issue of which featured the comics&#x27; first variant cover.

Coming into the comics profession as a penciller, inker, letterer, and writer on his earliest work, Byrne began co-plotting the &quot;X-Men&quot; comics during his tenure on them, for story arcs including &quot;Dark Phoenix Saga&quot; and &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;, and co-creating characters such as Kitty Pryde, Emma Frost, Sabretooth, Shadow King, and Rachel Summers. Byrne launched his writing career in earnest with &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, also serving as penciler and inker, and added She-Hulk onto the team while writing a solo series for The Thing. While working on &quot;X-Men&quot;, he created the Canadian superhero team Alpha Flight, and later wrote and drew their own series.

Moving to DC, Byrne established the modern origin for Superman in &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; before writing and drawing two monthly titles and various miniseries for the character. Byrne then returned to Marvel, introducing the Great Lakes Avengers, and wrote and drew the humorous fourth wall-breaking series &quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot;. Revisiting &quot;X-Men&quot; as a writer, Byrne co-created Bishop and Omega Red. Byrne was the writer and artist of the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; series for three years, during which he created the second Wonder Girl, Cassie Sandsmark.

During the 1990s he produced a number of creator-owned works, including &quot;Next Men&quot; and &quot;Danger Unlimited&quot;, and was one of the founders of the Legend imprint at Dark Horse Comics. He scripted the first issues of Mike Mignola&#x27;s &quot;Hellboy&quot; series and produced several &quot;Star Trek comics&quot; for IDW Publishing. In 2010, Byrne revived &quot;Next Men&quot; to conclude the series. Hailed as one of the most prolific and influential comic book artists ever, Byrne and his X-Men collaborator Chris Claremont were entered into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 2015.

==Early life and career==
Byrne was born on July 6, 1950 in Walsall, Staffordshire, and raised in West Bromwich, also in Staffordshire, where he lived with his parents, Frank and Nelsie, and his maternal grandmother. He was an only child. His father was a town planner and his mother was a homemaker. While living in England, prior to his family emigrating to Canada when Byrne was 8, he was first exposed to comics, saying in 2005,
His first encounter with Marvel Comics was in 1962 with Stan Lee and Jack Kirby&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #5. He later commented that &quot;the book had an &#x27;edge&#x27; like nothing DC was putting out at the time&quot;. Jack Kirby&#x27;s work, in particular, had a strong influence on Byrne and he has worked with many of the characters Kirby created or co-created. Besides Kirby, Byrne was influenced by the naturalistic style of Neal Adams. Byrne has named comic books, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; as his greatest influences.

Despite drawing comics as a youth, Byrne intended to have a career as a commercial artist. In 1970, Byrne enrolled at the Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary. He created the superhero parody &quot;Gay Guy&quot; for the college newspaper, which poked fun at the campus stereotype of homosexuality among art students. &quot;Gay Guy&quot; is notable for featuring the first gay superhero. While there, he published his first comic book, &quot;ACA Comix&quot; #1, featuring &quot;The Death&#x27;s Head Knight&quot;.

Byrne left the college in 1973 without graduating. Before finding success with comic books, Byrne spent three years designing billboards for an advertisement company. He broke into comics with a &quot;Fan Art Gallery&quot; piece in Marvel&#x27;s promotional publication &quot;FOOM&quot; in early 1974 and by illustrating a two-page story by writer Al Hewetson in Skywald Publications&#x27; black-and-white horror magazine &quot;Nightmare&quot; #20 (Aug. 1974). He then began freelancing for Charlton Comics, making his color-comics debut with the &quot;E-Man&quot; backup feature &quot;Rog-2000&quot;, starring a robot character he&#x27;d created in the mid-1970s that colleagues Roger Stern and Bob Layton named and began using for spot illustrations in their fanzine &quot;CPL&quot; (&quot;Contemporary Pictorial Literature&quot;). A Rog-2000 story written by Stern, with art by Byrne and Layton, had gotten the attention of Charlton Comics editor Nicola Cuti, who extended Byrne an invitation. Written by Cuti, &quot;Rog-2000&quot; became one of several alternating backup features in the Charlton Comics superhero series &quot;E-Man&quot;, starting with the eight-page &quot;That Was No Lady&quot; in issue #6 (Jan. 1975). While that was Byrne&#x27;s first published color-comics work, &quot;My first professional comic book sale was to Marvel, a short story called Dark Asylum&#x27; ... which languished in a flat file somewhere until it was used as filler in &quot;Giant-Size Dracula&quot; #5 [(June 1975)], long after the first Rog story.&quot; The story was plotted by Tony Isabella and written by David Anthony Kraft.

After the Rog-2000 story, Byrne went on to work on the Charlton books &quot;Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Emergency!&quot;, and co-created with writer Joe Gill the post-apocalyptic science-fiction series &quot;Doomsday + 1&quot;. Byrne additionally drew a cover for the supernatural anthology &quot;The Many Ghosts of Doctor Graves&quot; #54 (Dec. 1975).

==Marvel Comics==
Byrne said he broke into Marvel comics after writer Chris Claremont
 Byrne soon went on to draw series including &quot;The Champions&quot; (#12–15, 17 1977–78) and &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; (#53–55, 59–70, 75, 79, 100). Byrne first drew the X-Men in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #53. For many issues, he was paired with Claremont, with whom he teamed for issue #11 of the black-and-white Marvel magazine &quot;Marvel Preview&quot; featuring Star-Lord. The Star-Lord story was inked by Terry Austin and lettered by Tom Orzechowski, both of whom soon afterward teamed with Claremont and Byrne on &quot;Uncanny&quot; &quot;X-Men&quot;.

===&quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;===

Byrne joined Claremont beginning with &quot;X-Men&quot; #108 (Dec. 1977), which was later renamed &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; with issue #114. Their work together, along with inker Terry Austin, on such classic story arcs as &quot;Proteus&quot;, &quot;Dark Phoenix Saga&quot;, and &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; would make them both fan favorites. Byrne insisted that the title keep its Canadian character, Wolverine, and contributed a series of story elements to justify Wolverine&#x27;s presence which eventually made the character among the most popular in Marvel&#x27;s publishing history. With issue #114, Byrne began co-plotting the series as well as penciling. Claremont recounted that &quot;at that point in time John and I were, in a very real sense, true collaborators on the book. It was with very few exceptions, difficult, for me, anyway, to tell in the actual gestation of the book where one of us left off and the other began – because it involved one of us coming up with an idea and bouncing it off the other ...&quot; The &quot;Dark Phoenix Saga&quot; in 1980 is one of the most notable stories in the title&#x27;s history. Comics writers and historians Roy Thomas and Peter Sanderson observed that &quot;&#x27;The Dark Phoenix Saga&#x27; is to Claremont and Byrne what the &#x27;Galactus Trilogy&#x27; is to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It is a landmark in Marvel history, showcasing its creators&#x27; work at the height of their abilities.&quot; Byrne has repeatedly compared his working relationship with Claremont to Gilbert and Sullivan, and has said that they were &quot;almost constantly at war over who the characters were.&quot; Byrne created the characters Alpha Flight, Proteus, and Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat during his run on &quot;The X-Men&quot;. A new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, led by Mystique, was introduced in the &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; storyline (#141–142, Jan.-Feb. 1981) in which a time-travelling Kitty Pryde tried to avert a dystopian future caused by the Brotherhood assassinating Presidential candidate Senator Robert Kelly. Byrne plotted the story because he wanted to depict the Sentinels as a genuine threat to the existence of the mutant race. Byrne left &quot;The X-Men&quot; with #143 (March 1981). During his tenure on the series, &quot;The X-Men&quot; was promoted from a bimonthly to a monthly publication schedule as sales steadily increased—a trend that continued long after Byrne left.

In the late 1970s, while serving as the regular penciller of &quot;X-Men&quot;, Byrne began penciling another superhero team title, &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Working for the most part with writer David Michelinie, he drew issues #164–166 and 181–191. Byrne and Michelinie co-created Scott Lang in &quot;Avengers&quot; #181 (March 1979). Byrne&#x27;s nine-issue run of &quot;Captain America&quot;, issues #247–255 (July 1980 – March 1981), with writer Roger Stern, included issue #250, in which the character mulled running for the office of President of the United States.

===&quot;Fantastic Four&quot;===

Byrne&#x27;s post-&quot;X-Men&quot; body of work at Marvel includes his five-year run on &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (#232–295, July 1981 – October 1986), which is generally considered a &quot;second golden age&quot; for the title. Byrne said his goal was to &quot;turn the clock back ... get back and see fresh what it was that made the book great at its inception&quot;. He made a number of changes during his tenure: The Thing was temporarily replaced as a member of the quartet by the She-Hulk, while the Thing had adventures in his own comic (#1–22 also written by Byrne), and the Thing&#x27;s longtime girlfriend Alicia Masters left him for his teammate the Human Torch; the Invisible Girl was developed into the most powerful member with the heightened control of her refined powers and the self-confident assertiveness to use it epitomized by her name change to the Invisible Woman; and headquarters the Baxter Building was destroyed and replaced with Four Freedoms Plaza. Byrne has cited multiple reasons for leaving the series, including &quot;internal office politics&quot; and that &quot;it simply started to get old&quot;.

===&quot;Alpha Flight&quot;===
In 1983, while still at the helm of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, Byrne began to write and draw &quot;Alpha Flight&quot;, starring a Canadian superhero team that had been introduced &quot;merely to survive a fight with the X-Men.&quot; The series proved initially very popular, with its first issue selling over half a million copies, and the following issues selling between 400,000 and 500,000 issues each month. However, Byrne has said the title &quot;was never much fun&quot; and that he considered the characters two-dimensional. One of Alpha Flight&#x27;s characters, Northstar, eventually became Marvel&#x27;s first openly gay superhero. Though Byrne from the beginning intended the character to be gay, Northstar&#x27;s homosexuality was only hinted at during Byrne&#x27;s tenure on the series.

===&quot;Indiana Jones&quot;===
In 1983 Byrne co-wrote and penciled issues 1 and 2 of &quot;The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones,&quot; a two-part story arc titled &quot;The Ikons of Ikammanen&quot;. The story involves archaeologist Edith Dunne, a former student-turned-enemy of Jones. Byrne wrote the first issue and Dennis O&#x27;Neil wrote the second, while Byrne penciled both issues with Terry Austin as the inker.

===&quot;Incredible Hulk&quot;===
In 1985, after issue #28 of &quot;Alpha Flight&quot;, Byrne swapped the series with Bill Mantlo, writer of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;. According to Byrne, he discussed his ideas with editor-in-chief Jim Shooter ahead of time, but once Byrne was on the title, Shooter objected to them. Byrne wrote and drew issues #314–319. The final issue of Byrne&#x27;s run featured the wedding of Bruce Banner and Betty Ross.

==DC Comics==
=== &quot;The Untold Legend of the Batman&quot; ===
In early 1980, Byrne did his first work for DC Comics, penciling the first issue of &quot;The Untold Legend of the Batman&quot; miniseries. Byrne had always wanted to draw &quot;Batman&quot;, and had a three-month window of time during which he was not under contract to Marvel. Hearing about the &quot;Untold Legend&quot; series, Byrne contacted editor Paul Levitz to express interest. DC took him up on his offer, but it was not until the second month of his three-month window that Byrne received the plot for the first issue. Byrne told Levitz that he would not be able to finish the project due to time constraints despite DC then allegedly offering Byrne double his Marvel pay rate, after initially saying they could not match his Marvel rate. Byrne penciled the first issue, which was inked by Jim Aparo after being intended for Terry Austin. This experience soured Byrne on DC for quite some time.

=== &quot;Superman&quot; ===
Near the end of his time at Marvel, Byrne was hired by DC Comics to revamp its flagship character Superman. This was part of a company-wide restructuring of the history of the DC Universe and all of its characters following the limited series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. Byrne&#x27;s reworking of Superman in particular gained widespread media coverage outside the comic book industry, including articles in &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. At the time, Byrne said, &quot;I&#x27;m taking Superman back to the basics ... It&#x27;s basically Siegel and Shuster&#x27;s Superman meets the Fleischer Superman in 1986.&quot;
Byrne significantly reduced Superman&#x27;s powers (though he was still one of the most powerful beings on Earth), eliminated the Fortress of Solitude and super-dog Krypto, and kept Jonathan and Martha Kent alive into Clark&#x27;s adulthood to enjoy their adopted son&#x27;s triumphs, as well as to provide him with support, grounding, and advice whenever he needed it. Byrne also used Marv Wolfman&#x27;s idea of making Lex Luthor a wealthy business owner in addition to a scientific genius with a deadly vendetta against the superhero. Byrne did away with the childhood/teenage career as Superboy; in his revamped history, Clark Kent does not put on a costume and become a super-hero until adulthood. This approach to Kent&#x27;s path to becoming Superman was later used in the TV series 
&quot;Lois &amp; Clark&quot; and &quot;Smallville&quot;, and in the 2005 novel &quot;It&#x27;s Superman!&quot; by Tom De Haven.

In the Superman mythos, Byrne wrote Clark Kent as having a more aggressive and extroverted personality than previously depicted, comparing him to Jimmy Breslin, and even making him a top high-school football player. Byrne came up with explanations for how Superman&#x27;s disguise works, such as the public simply does not realize that he has a secret identity since he is unmasked, that Superman would vibrate his face via his super speed in order to blur his image to photographers, and having Kent keep a weight training set around to explain how the human and presumably weaker Kent could have a frame as massive as Superman&#x27;s. Byrne described Superman as becoming a &quot;Super Republican&quot;, seeking to incorporate renewed interest in American patriotism during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. Byrne&#x27;s Superman felt that his deepest roots were on Earth and that his home planet of &quot;Krypton is anathema to him&quot;.

The origin and early career of Byrne&#x27;s version of Superman debuted in the six-issue miniseries &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; (July–Sept. 1986), the first issue of which was marketed with two different covers illustrated by Byrne, the first use of variant covers by the American comics industry. DC Executive Editor Dick Giordano had been looking for a writer to restart the Superman continuity from scratch, and began talking with Byrne in May 1985 to discuss what Byrne would do with Superman if offered the job. With DC agreeing with 99% of the revision, Byrne was given the go-ahead for what became &quot;The Man of Steel&quot;.

Comics historian Timothy Callahan argued that Superman in modern media has more in common with Byrne&#x27;s portrayal of the character than those of Cary Bates, Elliot S. Maggin, Dennis O&#x27;Neil, Jerry Siegel, and Edmond Hamilton. Brian Cronin of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; suggested that, although Byrne made several changes, Byrne&#x27;s Superman was still more similar to previous depictions of the character than he was not.

Byrne penciled the six-issue DC Universe crossover miniseries &quot;Legends&quot; (Nov. 1986 – May 1987) during this time. He wrote and drew two monthly Superman titles with the hero&#x27;s present-day adventures: a new &quot;Superman&quot; title beginning with issue #1 (January 1987) and &quot;Action Comics&quot;, in which, beginning with issue #584, Superman teamed up with other DC characters. The original &quot;Superman&quot; book was renamed &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; starting with issue #424 and was initially written by Marv Wolfman and drawn by Jerry Ordway, but the writing chores were taken over by Byrne after a year from issues #436–442 and 444. As 1988 marked the 50th anniversary year of Superman&#x27;s creation, Byrne did more Superman-related projects while working on the core Superman monthly titles at the same time: he wrote the prestige format graphic novel, &quot;Superman: The Earth Stealers&quot; and three separate four-issue miniseries: &quot;The World of Krypton&quot;, &quot;The World of Metropolis&quot;, and &quot;The World of Smallville&quot;. He supplied the cover art for the March 14, 1988, issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine and an interior spread featuring Superman, where his pencils were inked by Ordway.

After his initial run on the Superman titles from 1986 to 1988, Byrne would make a return as a guest inker on &quot;Adventures of Superman Annual&quot; #2 (cover) and &quot;Superman&quot; #50 in 1990. He would return doing a Superman Elseworlds story as a writer and artist in &quot;Action Comics&quot; Annual #6 in 1994. In 2004 &quot;&quot;, an Elseworlds story, was a collaboration with former Monty Python member John Cleese and Kim Johnson, with art by Byrne and inker Mark Farmer. Byrne returned to draw Superman in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #827–835, working with writer Gail Simone, from 2005 to 2006.

Byrne spent about two years on the Superman titles before leaving. His dissatisfaction stemmed from his perception that there was a lack of &quot;conscious support&quot; for him at DC. Furthering the rift between the company and the artist was the fact that the version of Superman which DC licensed for merchandising was contrary to Byrne&#x27;s representation in the comic books.

==Return to Marvel==

===&quot;Star Brand&quot;===
In 1986, Marvel began publication of a new line of superhero titles created by then-Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter, which took place in a continuum removed from the Marvel Universe proper, called the New Universe. In 1987, the New Universe line saw a revamp under new Editor-in-Chief Tom DeFalco, and Byrne took over writing and art breakdowns on the line&#x27;s flagship title, &quot;Star Brand&quot; (renamed &quot;The Star Brand&quot; during Byrne&#x27;s term on the book). Byrne&#x27;s run started with issue #11 and continued until the series&#x27; cancellation eight issues later upon Marvel&#x27;s discontinuation of the New Universe line.

===&quot;Avengers West Coast&quot;===
In 1989, after leaving &quot;Superman&quot;, Byrne returned to work on a number of titles for Marvel Comics. His work on &quot;West Coast Avengers&quot; (issues #42–57, soon renamed &quot;Avengers West Coast&quot;) was contingent on his being allowed to do what he called &quot;my Vision story&quot;. The Vision was a long-standing Marvel superhero and member of The Avengers, an android originally created by the villain Ultron constructed with the body of the original Human Torch. The Vision went on to join the team, marry his teammate the Scarlet Witch, and father two children by her. Byrne radically changed this, revealing that Immortus – who previously had revealed to the Avengers the synthezoid&#x27;s origin – lied about the Vision&#x27;s creation. The android Human Torch was found and joined the WCA. The Vision was disassembled and stripped of his emotions. The couple&#x27;s twins were revealed to be pieces of the soul of the demon Mephisto. In addition to these changes, Byrne&#x27;s run is remembered for the introduction of the Great Lakes Avengers, an eclectic group of new superheroes.

===&quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot;===
During She-Hulk&#x27;s tenure with the Fantastic Four, she appeared in &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; #18 (Nov. 1985) in a story titled &quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot;, which Byrne wrote and illustrated.
On the request of editor Mark Gruenwald, Byrne wrote and drew a new series in 1989, &quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot; (maintaining the 1985 graphic novel&#x27;s title). Gruenwald directed that it be significantly different from the character&#x27;s previous series, &quot;The Savage She-Hulk&quot;. Byrne&#x27;s take was comedic and the She-Hulk, who was aware she was in a comic book, regularly broke the fourth wall, developing a love-hate relationship with her artist/writer by criticizing his storylines, drawing style, character development, etc. Byrne left the book after writing and drawing the first eight issues. Byrne was asked for input on writer Dwayne McDuffie&#x27;s &quot;She-Hulk: Ceremony&quot; limited series, and according to Byrne, most of his objections to the story and notations of errors were ignored, and his editor, Bobbie Chase, &quot;was rewriting my stuff to bring it into line with&quot; the story in &quot;Ceremony&quot;. Upon complaining to DeFalco, Byrne says he was fired from his series. He later returned to write and draw issues #31–50 under new editor Renée Witterstaetter.

===&quot;Namor, the Sub-Mariner&quot;===
Byrne started a new series, &quot;Namor, the Sub-Mariner&quot; in April 1990. Byrne&#x27;s take on the undersea antihero Namor cast him as the head of a surface company, Oracle, Inc., in order to help keep the ocean unpolluted, and had Namor involved in corporate intrigue. After writing and drawing the book for 25 issues, Byrne told editor Terry Kavanagh that he was starting to feel constrained on the book and thought having a different artist might inspire him to a fresh approach. Kavanagh suggested newcomer Jae Lee, and Byrne continued strictly as the writer of the book up through issue #32. Byrne later said he has great fondness for the title character and was unhappy that circumstances forced him to leave the series.

===&quot;Iron Man&quot;===
Byrne took over writing &quot;Iron Man&quot; for issues #258–277 (July 1990-Feb. 1992), drawn by John Romita Jr. and later by Paul Ryan. Byrne launched a second &quot;Armor Wars&quot; story arc, restored the Mandarin as a major Iron Man nemesis, and featured the 1950s &quot;pre-superhero Marvel&quot; monster Fin Fang Foom. During the course of his run, Byrne became the first writer to retcon Iron Man&#x27;s origin, removing explicit ties to the Vietnam War (while maintaining a Southeast Asia setting), and linking Wong-Chu, the man who captured Tony Stark, to the Mandarin.

==Creator-owned works==
In the early 1990s, Byrne began creating a series of original, creator-owned works for publisher Dark Horse Comics. This was during a general trend in the industry for established creators working for Marvel and DC to bring their original works to other publishers or create their own companies to publish the works themselves (one prominent example is Image Comics). A number of these creators, including Byrne, Frank Miller, Mike Mignola, and Art Adams, banded together to form the Legend imprint at Dark Horse.

Byrne&#x27;s first title for Dark Horse was &quot;Next Men&quot;, a work he considered darker and more realistic than his previous work. The Next Men were five young people who were the product of a secret government experiment. Byrne said, &quot;I thought I would see what I could do with superheroes in the &#x27;real world&#x27; &quot; and &quot;[e]xplore the impact their existence would have.&quot; Byrne&#x27;s other Dark Horse titles were &quot;Babe&quot;, and &quot;Danger Unlimited&quot;, an all-age readers book about a team of heroes in the future fighting an alien occupation of Earth.

The &quot;Next Men&quot; lasted until issue 30 in 1994, when Byrne ended the series, intending to return &quot;in no more than six months.&quot; Byrne says he &quot;did not count on...the virtual collapse of the whole comic book industry, which seemed to occur at just the time I put &quot;Next Men&quot; on the shelf...In the present, very depressed marketplace, I don&#x27;t feel &quot;Next Men&quot; would have much chance, so I leave the book hibernating until such time as the market improves.&quot;

IDW Publishing revived &quot;John Byrne&#x27;s Next Men&quot; in 2010 following a series of trade paperbacks that collected the first series. The original storyline that had a cliffhanger ending in 1995 was continued.

==Later career==
In later years, Byrne has worked on titles for Marvel, DC, and other publishers, including the 1992 prestige format graphic novel &quot;Green Lantern: Ganthet&#x27;s Tale&quot; with science fiction author Larry Niven at DC. In 1989, Byrne wrote &quot;Batman&quot; #433–435 (May–July 1989) and in the following year produced a 3-D graphic novel with 3-D effects by Ray Zone. He returned to the &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise at Marvel from 1991 to 1992, succeeding longtime writer Chris Claremont, who left after 17 years working on the various &quot;X-Men&quot; related titles. Byrne&#x27;s return as the new writer was brief, as he only scripted &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; issues #281–285 and 288 with artist Whilce Portacio, and &quot;X-Men&quot; issues #4–5 with artist Jim Lee. In 1995, Byrne wrote and drew the Marvel/DC intercompany crossover &quot;Darkseid vs. Galactus: The Hunger&quot;, which also featured the Jack Kirby creations the Silver Surfer and the New Gods. In 1996, another Marvel/DC intercompany crossover - &quot;Batman/Captain America&quot;, one shot homage to Golden Age versions of both heroes.

He wrote and drew another of DC&#x27;s signature series, the long-running &quot;Wonder Woman,&quot; from 1995 to 1998. During that time, he elevated the super-heroine to the status of a goddess who then ascended to Mount Olympus as the Goddess of Truth, and created Cassie Sandsmark, the new Wonder Girl. Byrne then spotlighted supporting characters such as Queen Hippolyta in their own adventures but restored the series&#x27; &quot;status quo&quot; in his last issue. He additionally took over &quot;New Gods&quot; vol. 4 at the end of 1996, as writer-artist of issues #12–15, continuing with it as the series was rebooted with a new #1 as &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World&quot;. That ran 20 issues from 1997 to 1998. During his tenure on the &quot;New Gods&quot;, Byrne was writer of the four-issue miniseries crossover &quot;Genesis&quot;, a storyline published weekly by DC Comics in August 1997. The series was drawn by Ron Wagner and Joe Rubinstein. Byrne wrote a Wonder Woman prose novel, &quot;Wonder Woman: Gods and Goddesses&quot; (1997).
In the series &quot;Spider-Man: Chapter One&quot;, Byrne retold some of Spider-Man&#x27;s earliest adventures, changing some key aspects. In late 1998, Byrne became writer of the flagship series &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; at the end of the series with issue #440, by which time Marvel had decided to relaunch the book. The &quot;last&quot; issue of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; was #441 (November 1998), with Marvel re-initiating the series with a new volume 2, issue #1 (Jan. 1999) with Howard Mackie as writer and Byrne on pencils. Byrne penciled issues #1–18 (from 1999 to 2000) and wrote #13–14. In 1999, Byrne, working with artist Ron Garney, wrote the first seven issues of a new Hulk series, as well as the summer annual.

From 1999 to 2001, Byrne returned to the X-Men to write and draw &quot;X-Men: The Hidden Years&quot; which ran for 22 issues. Byrne explained the title&#x27;s cancellation by saying, &quot;I was officially informed yesterday that, despite the fact that they are still profitable, several &#x27;redundant&#x27; X-Titles are being axed.&quot; This disagreement factored in his decision to no longer work for Marvel Comics.

Like &quot;X-Men: The Hidden Years&quot;, some other works of this period involved characters and events in time periods other than the present and, in some cases, considered &quot;skipped over&quot; (&quot;&quot;), or alternate timelines (DC&#x27;s &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot;); a feature some of these have in common is to have characters who actually age during the course of the series, which is uncommon for characters in ongoing comics.

In early 2003, Byrne spent ten weeks as a guest penciler on the syndicated newspaper strip &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot;. Byrne did this as a favor for &quot;Winkerbean&quot;&#x27;s creator, Tom Batiuk, who was recovering from foot surgery. He would later become the final person to draw &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot;, taking over illustration duties from artist Chuck Ayers for the strip&#x27;s concluding week, ending on December 31, 2022.

Most of his work in the first decade of the new millennium was for DC Comics: &quot;JLA&quot; (issues #94–99 in 2004, co-writing and illustrating the &quot;Tenth Circle&quot; story arc, reuniting with his &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; writer Chris Claremont and with Jerry Ordway as inker), &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;, &quot;Blood of the Demon&quot;, a five-issue arc of &quot;JLA Classified&quot;. He penciled an issue of &quot;Hawkman&quot; (vol. 4) #26 in May 2004. &quot;&quot; was a collaboration with former Monty Python member John Cleese and Kim Johnson, with art by Byrne and inker Mark Farmer. Byrne returned to draw Superman in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #827–835, working with writer Gail Simone, from 2005 to 2006. Afterward, Simone and Byrne reteamed to launch &quot;The All-New Atom&quot; series in 2006, with Byrne pencilling the first three issues.

For publisher IDW, Byrne worked on the superhero series &quot;FX&quot; #1–6, written by Wayne Osborne, starting with the March 2008 issue. His other projects for the publisher include stories for the Star Trek and &quot;Angel&quot; franchises. Byrne&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; work included the final issue of the miniseries &quot;Star Trek: Alien Spotlight&quot; (February 2008); &quot;Star Trek: Assignment: Earth&quot; #1–5; &quot;Star Trek: Romulans&quot; #1–2, &quot;Star Trek: Crew&quot; (a Christopher Pike-era comic book focusing on the character of &quot;Number One&quot;) started in March 2009; the final chapter of his Romulans story, a four-issue miniseries, &quot;Star Trek: Leonard McCoy, Frontier Doctor&quot;, set before &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, and the second &quot;Assignment: Earth&quot; series. His work on &quot;Angel&quot; included &quot;Angel: Blood and Trenches&quot; (set during World War I); an &quot;Angel vs Frankenstein&quot; one-shot; and an Andy Hallett tribute, &quot;Angel: Music of the Spheres&quot; and &quot;Angel vs Frankenstein II&quot; in 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively.

In 2011, he worked on &quot;Jurassic Park: The Devils in the Desert&quot;, and &quot;Cold War (The Michael Swann Dossier)&quot;. He revived his &quot;Next Men&quot; series in 2010–2011, with the sequel series &quot;Aftermath&quot;. Other work for IDW includes the 2012 miniseries &quot;Trio&quot; and the 2013 miniseries &quot;The High Ways&quot; and &quot;Doomsday.1&quot;.

In 2018, Byrne began &quot;X-Men Elsewhen&quot;, a fan-fiction comic book exploring how he would&#x27;ve continued the story of the &quot;X-Men&quot; after &quot;The Dark Phoenix Saga&quot;. The series, written and pencilled by Byrne and published on his website, has 32 issues as of December 2022.

==Controversies==
Over the years, Byrne has gained a reputation as a controversial figure within the community of comic book pros and fans. He has himself noted that &quot;as the people who have figured me out have said, I just don&#x27;t suffer fools gladly.&quot; Gail Simone, who worked with Byrne on &quot;The All New Atom&quot; in 2006, described Byrne as &quot;very opinionated; a lot of artists are opinionated, and I&#x27;m okay with that. Actually, I think John Byrne is brilliant and his forceful personality is part of that.&quot;

In 1981, Jack Kirby began speaking publicly about his belief that he had been deprived of fair credit and money while creating the majority of Marvel&#x27;s top characters. Byrne wrote an editorial declaring himself &quot;proud&quot; to be a &quot;company man&quot;, and arguing that all creators should &quot;live within the rules while they&#x27;re around.&quot; Steve Gerber and Kirby lampooned Byrne&#x27;s position in &quot;Destroyer Duck&quot;, drawing him as a character called Booster Cogburn, possessing no genitals, a removable spine, and existing only to serve as a cog in the mammoth corporation that owned him. Byrne later made a story in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #592–593 where Big Barda (who is based on Kirby&#x27;s wife Roz) is brainwashed and almost forced to make a pornographic video with Superman. Erik Larsen created a villain in the 1990s for his &quot;Savage Dragon&quot; and the &quot;Freak Force&quot; series, Johnny Redbeard / the Creator, who is a parody of Byrne; a massive cranium with atrophied appendages, he can bestow superpowers indiscriminately.

Regarding the ownership rights for Superman, Byrne has stated: &quot;And I&#x27;ve always been terribly pragmatic about that kind of stuff. This is where my low BS threshold touched on in the sense that I looked at the story of Siegel and Shuster, for example, and I said, well, that&#x27;s kind of sad that they created this huge, iconic character and didn&#x27;t make a hundred bajillion dollars for it. But that&#x27;s also what the situation was; that was the deal. And everybody understood that was the deal. They weren&#x27;t cheated. They knew what it was going in.&quot; In a 2006 interview, Byrne further elaborated on his creator&#x27;s rights views:

===Other comments===
In 1982, during a panel discussion at the Dallas Fantasy Fair, Byrne made disparaging comments about longtime comics writer and one-time Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Roy Thomas that were published in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; #75 (Sept. 1982). Thomas threatened a slander suit if Byrne did not apologize. In a letter printed in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; #82 (July 1983), Byrne retracted his statements, saying he was only repeating information from others, writing, &quot;I acted only in the office of a parrot.&quot;

In 2005, while criticizing portrayals of Superman emphasizing his connection to his home planet, Byrne described immigrants with excessive attachment to their nations of origin as &quot;ungrateful little shits.&quot; Similar views were earlier expressed in Byrne&#x27;s &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; (1986), in which Superman was not considered born until after his Kryptonian artificial matrix opened after landing in Kansas, thus making him an American citizen by birth. The miniseries ends with Superman declaring, &quot;Krypton bred me, but it was Earth that gave me all I am. All that matters.&quot;

In 2015, Byrne received criticism for stating that transgender people are mentally ill and comparing them to pedophiles while discussing Caitlyn Jenner. Byrne stated: &quot;How will we feel about all those people who, instead of actually helping them, we encouraged in a program of self-mutilation?&quot;

==Art style==
Byrne has himself called his style a &quot;collection of influences&quot;. He cites Neal Adams, Jack Kirby, John Buscema, and Steve Ditko as primary influences on his style, but continues to pick up on ideas that he sees and likes while constantly changing his tools and methods.

Byrne is color blind for a narrow range of green and brown tones. During the first year that Byrne illustrated &quot;Iron Fist&quot;, he believed that the protagonist&#x27;s costume was brown. While he experimented with his own hand-drawn lettering in the early 1980s, he developed computer fonts for his work in the 1990s, one in particular based on the handwriting of the letterer Jack Morelli.

==Personal life==
Byrne became a naturalized American citizen in 1988. He was previously a citizen of the UK and Canada, but no longer holds citizenship for those countries.

He was married to photographer and actress Andrea Braun Byrne until divorcing. They met at a convention in Chicago. Braun&#x27;s son from a previous marriage is fellow professional comic book artist Kieron Dwyer, and Byrne became Dwyer&#x27;s stepfather when the boy was 13 until Byrne divorced his mother. They only lived together for a short time as the young Dwyer soon moved to Los Angeles to live with his father. Byrne encouraged Dwyer&#x27;s aspirations to be a cartoonist and assisted in landing Dwyer&#x27;s first professional job drawing &quot;Batman&quot; #413 (Nov. 1987).

Byrne described his political views as centre-right, &quot;There&#x27;s a political party—or used to be—up in Canada called the Progressive Conservatives. And I always liked the sound of that name. I liked what that imparted, that sort of &#x27;let us go forward carefully&#x27; notion. So that&#x27;s sort of how I&#x27;ve always thought of myself, as a progressive conservative.&quot;

Byrne has never done drugs and only drinks alcohol very sparingly.

Since 2015, Byrne no longer attends any conventions regularly and makes rare public appearances. He made an appearance at the 2018 Fan Expo Boston, where he spoke at two events, both titled &quot;Spotlight on John Byrne&quot; on August 11 and 12, and an autograph signing with William Shatner.

==Awards==
Byrne received the Favourite Comic Book Artist Eagle Awards in 1978 and 1979, and a 1980 Inkpot Award. In 2008, Byrne was inducted into the Canadian Comic Book Creator Hall of Fame. In 2015, Byrne was inducted into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame, alongside judges&#x27; choices Marge (Marjorie Henderson Buell) and Bill Woggon and elected inductees Chris Claremont, Denis Kitchen, and Frank Miller.

<text>The Dolphin Hotel is a pub on the Barbican in Plymouth, England. The building, which is known as the Dolphin Hotel (never the Dolphin Inn) is a Grade II listed building. It notable as the setting of several of the artist Beryl Cook&#x27;s paintings.

The three storey building was constructed in the early 19th century, although it may contain fabric from an earlier structure. It has a slate mansard roof surrounded by a tall parapet with a moulded cornice. The front has white stucco with plaster reliefs of dolphins. The pub is associated with the Tolpuddle Martyrs, some of whom stayed at the hotel on their return from exile in Australia in 1838, when a Mr Morgan was the landlord.

It is a no-frills unmodernised pub famous for its cask ale, draught Bass served straight from the barrel. It is listed in the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA)&#x27;s &quot;Good Beer Guide&quot; and the 2008 Good Pub Guide. The sign on the front of the building has always called the pub the &#x27;Dolphin Hotel&#x27;. In 2010 the pub was refurbished, but vandalised in 2014.

The pub also provided the setting for the BBC&#x27;s poorly received animated Janner comedy series &quot;Bosom Pals&quot;, which was based on some of the characters in Cook&#x27;s paintings and featured the voices of Dawn French as the lead character Stella, Alison Steadman as her best friend Joan, and Timothy Spall as the Dolphin&#x27;s real-life landlord Billy Holmes. Billy Holmes has been the landlord of the pub since the 1990s when he took it over from his parents.

<text>John II (27 September 1275 – 27 October 1312), also called John the Peaceful, was Duke of Brabant, Lothier and Limburg (1294–1312). He was the son of John I of Brabant and Margaret of Flanders.

John II succeeded his father in 1294 During the reign of John II, Brabant continued supporting a coalition to stop French expansion. He tried to conquer South Holland (district of medieval Holland) from the pro-French Count John II of Holland, but was not successful.

In 1309, the Crusade of the Poor besieged the castle of Genappe in Brabant because it was sheltering Jews. John sent an army that defeated the crusaders, who incurred heavy losses. According to Chris Harman (2000), during different parts of the XIV century several attacks on jews merchants and christian priests took place, and also awhich, typically, masses of people would march from town to town, looting and being joined by others during their march. Harman quotes the following:

John, who suffered from kidney stones and wanted his duchy to be peacefully handed over to his son upon his death, in 1312 signed the famous Charter of Kortenberg. John died in Tervuren in 1312. He was buried in the St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral in Brussels.

==Family==
On 8 July 1290, John married Margaret of England in Westminster Abbey, London. She was a daughter of King Edward I of England and his first wife, Eleanor of Castile. Only one child was born out of this marriage:
* John III, Duke of Brabant.

John II had several illegitimate children:
* Jan van Corsselaer, was later named Lord of Witthem, Wailwilre, Machelen, la Rochette and Colonster.
* Jan van Wyvliet. Lord of Blaesveld and Kuyc. Married to Margaret Pipenpoy.
* Jan Cordeken: Founder of the House of Glymes. He was legitimized by the emperor Louis IV by charter dated of 27 August 1344, lists John II as the father and Elisabeth Gortygin as his mother.
* Jan Magermann. Married to Adelise d&#x27;Elsies.
* Jan II van Dongelberg (- 1383). His mother was Marguerite van Pamel.

<text>In Greek mythology, Melicertes (, sometimes Melecertes), later called Palaemon or Palaimon (), was a Boeotian prince as the son of King Athamas and Ino, daughter of King Cadmus of Thebes. He was the brother of Learchus.

==Mythology==

Ino, pursued by her husband, who had been driven mad by Hera because Ino had brought up the infant Dionysus, threw herself and Melicertes into the sea from a high rock between Megara and Corinth, Both were changed into marine deities: Ino as Leucothea, noted by Homer, Melicertes as Palaemon. The body of the latter was carried by a dolphin to the Isthmus of Corinth and deposited under a pine tree. Here it was found by his uncle Sisyphus, who had it removed to Corinth, and by command of the Nereids instituted the Isthmian Games and sacrifices in his honor.

==In literature and art==
Palaemon appears for the first time in Euripides&#x27; &quot;Iphigeneia in Tauris&quot;, where he is already the &quot;guardian of ships&quot;. The paramount identification in the Latin poets of the Augustan age is with Portunus, the Roman god of safe harbours, memorably in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;. Ovid twice told the story of Ino&#x27;s sea-plunge with Melicertes in her arms.

Ovid&#x27;s treatment in his &quot;Fasti&quot; is the earliest to identify the Isthmus as the location, though without literally naming it:

In later Latin poets there are numerous identifications of Palaemon with the sanctuary at the Isthmus, where no archaeological evidence was found for a pre-Augustan cult.

Hyginus states both that Ino cast herself into the sea with her younger son by Athamas, Melicertes, and was made a goddess, and that Ino, daughter of Cadmus, killed her son Melicertes by Athamas, son of Aeolus, when she was fleeing from Athamas.

In Greco-Roman views, Palaemon is viewed as a dolphin-riding boy, or a child with a triton tail.

== Origins ==
No satisfactory origin of the name Palaemon has been given. The name means the &quot;wrestler&quot;, and is an epithet of Heracles, with whom Melqart is identified by &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot; and referred to as the &quot;Tyrian Herakles&quot;, but there does not appear to be any traditional connection between Heracles and Palaemon. Melicertes being Phoenician, Palaemon also has been explained as the &quot;burning lord&quot; (&quot;Baal-haman&quot;), but there seems little in common between a god of the sea and a god of fire. The Romans identified Palaemon with Portunus (the harbour god), and some took the name Palaemon to mean &quot;the honey eater&quot;.

==Cult==

In the late 2nd century CE, within the sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia, Pausanias saw a temple of Palaemon:

In company with Leucothea, Melicertes/Palaemon was widely invoked for protection from dangers at sea.

There seems considerable doubt whether or not the cult of Melicertes was of foreign, probably Phoenician, origin, and introduced by Phoenician navigators on the coasts and islands of the Aegean and Mediterranean. For the Hellenes he is a native of Boeotia.

In 1956, excavations at Isthmia under the direction of Broneer uncovered the small sanctuary of Palaemon, which eventually had a tiny Roman round temple in the Corinthian order, which appeared on coins of Corinth in the 2nd century CE; it was the successor to two previous more modest architectural phases of the sanctuary. The foundations of the temple were found to lie over the starting-line of a late-5th- or early-4th century BCE stadium. Worship was characterized by the dedication of hundreds of wheelmade oil lamps of a distinct type. A cult of Melicertes of great antiquity, possibly based on pre-Hellenic figures of Ino and Melicertes, was posited by Will, just previous to the site&#x27;s discovery and refuted by Hawthorne in 1958.

<doc id="75929" wikidata="Q2181368" url="?curid=75929" title="Charter of Kortenberg">
<text>The Charter of Kortenberg (Dutch: &quot;Keure van Kortenberg&quot;) is an agreement signed and sealed on September 27, 1312, in the abbey of Kortenberg by John II, Duke of Brabant and representatives of the cities of Brussels, Antwerp, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, Tienen and Zoutleeuw. Creation of the document is of historical and political importance because it retains agreements between inhabitants of a territory with a ruler who had absolute power. This reflected the start of a current that would later be labeled by historians as Brabant&#x27;s Constitutionalism because residents without control had claimed rights and powers, and had them recorded in writing, which are somewhat comparable to what have come to be called civil and political rights centuries later. In this process, the first simple rules were created for what would develop into a legal order that is now called democratic rule of law. 

The charter was valid for the entire duchy of Brabant, for the rich and the poor. From this charter originated an early kind of parliament, the &quot;Council of Kortenberg&quot; an assembly of lords. 

The control organ, a precursor of the later &quot;Estate assembly&quot; (namely, the first estate was the clergy, the second estate was the nobility, and the third estate was the municipalities) gathered in the Kortenberg Abbey and elsewhere with ups and downs until 1375.

From 1332 on the council was extended by two more members, so that there were 16 Lords; Antwerp got a second member and the Walloon Brabant town of Nivelles () also got a member. In 1340 documents were sealed with a special seal on which a tree was planted on a small hill. The seal bore the words &quot;SIGILUM COMMUNE : CONSILII DE CORTENBERGHE&quot; which was the common seal of the Council of Kortenberg.

== Charter of Kortenberg and &quot;Magna Carta&quot; ==

Although &quot;Magna Carta&quot; is commonly regarded as the very first charter giving rise to medieval European constitutionalism, the Charter of Kortenberg appears to have been more democratic in nature. This mainly because the beneficiaries of &quot;Magna Carta&quot; were only the barons while the beneficiaries of the Charter of Kortenberg included all citizens, expressly &#x27;the rich and the poor&#x27; (&quot;riken ende armen&quot;).

Reinforcing this view, the composition of the Council of Kortenberg marks a clear difference with the more &#x27;elitist&#x27; &quot;Magna Carta&quot;. Whilst &quot;Magna Carta&quot; was to be implemented by a council of 25 barons, the Council of Kortenberg counted four knights and ten townsmen. In the financial commission of August 1314 the nobility were only two with 12 civil representatives of eight towns.

== Follow up ==
A historical line of continuity can be drawn from the Charter of Kortenberg via the Joyous Entries of new Dukes into Flemish and Brabantian towns, the migration of educated citizens in the 16th &amp; 17th century from these towns to the Seven United Provinces as a result of the Eighty Years&#x27; War and the stay of some of the Mayflower Pilgrim Fathers in those Provinces, who had fled religious persecution in England for the tolerance of 17th-century Holland in the Netherlands. One group moved to the city of Leiden and was living there for two decades, prior to their departure for America. Some worked or studied at Leiden University.

Coupled with the enduring influence of New Netherlander society upon early American political life, the emphasis placed by American historians and the general public opinion upon the constitutive nature of &quot;Magna Carta&quot; for the American constitution and the American Dream seems too narrow if no mention is made from the Charter of Kortenberg all following Brabantian constitutional charters and the Act of Abjuration (1581), dubbed the Dutch Declaration of Independence.

==Modern translation of the charter of Kortenberg==
We, duke John II of Brabant, agree

# That no other demands or taxes be levied than those which are known as the three feudal cases: 
#* at the knighthood of my son
#* the wedding of my daughter
#* and if I should be taken captive 
#:The taxes will be reasonable (fiscal prerogative)
# An honourable jurisdiction for rich and poor (judicial prerogative),
# To recognise the freedom of our good towns (municipal prerogative),
# To establish a council which shall be comprised (sic) of:
#* 4 knights or nobles.
#* 10 representatives from the 5 cities as follows: 
#** 3 from Leuven
#** 3 from Brussels
#** 1 from Antwerp
#** 1 from &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch 
#** 1 from Tienen
#** 1 from Zoutleeuw
# This council be allowed to meet at Kortenberg in the Abbey. It will meet every 3 weeks to monitor whether the financial, judicial and municipal prerogatives are observed.

<text>Dangerous Liaisons is a 1988 American period romantic drama film directed by Stephen Frears from a screenplay by Christopher Hampton, based on his 1985 play &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot;, itself adapted from the 1782 French novel of the same name by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos. It stars Glenn Close, John Malkovich, Michelle Pfeiffer, Uma Thurman, Swoosie Kurtz, Mildred Natwick, Peter Capaldi and Keanu Reeves.

&quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; was theatrically released by Warner Bros. Pictures on December 21, 1988. The film received widespread critical acclaim, with high praise for the performances by Close and Pfeiffer and the screenplay, production values, costumes and soundtrack. Grossing $34.7 million against its $14 million budget, it was a modest box-office success. It received seven nominations at the 61st Academy Awards, including for the Best Picture, and won three: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Costume Design, and Best Production Design.

==Plot==
In pre-Revolution Paris, the Marquise de Merteuil plots revenge against her ex-lover, the Comte de Bastide, who recently ended their relationship. To soothe her wounded pride and embarrass Bastide, she seeks to arrange the seduction and disgrace of his young virgin fiancée, Cécile de Volanges, who has only recently been presented to society after spending her formative years in the shelter of a convent.

Merteuil calls on the similarly unprincipled Vicomte de Valmont, another ex-lover of hers, to do the deed. Valmont declines as he is plotting to seduce Madame de Tourvel, the devoutly religious wife of a member of Parliament and a current guest of Valmont&#x27;s aunt, Madame de Rosemonde. Amused and incredulous at Valmont&#x27;s hubris, Merteuil ups the ante: if Valmont somehow succeeds in seducing Tourvel and can furnish written proof, Merteuil will sleep with him as well. Never one to refuse a challenge, Valmont accepts.

Tourvel rebuffs all of Valmont&#x27;s advances. Searching for leverage, he instructs his page Azolan to seduce Tourvel&#x27;s maid, Julie and gain access to Tourvel&#x27;s private correspondence. One of the letters intercepted is from Cécile&#x27;s mother and Merteuil&#x27;s cousin, Madame de Volanges, warning Tourvel that Valmont is nefarious and untrustworthy. Valmont resolves to seduce Cécile as revenge for her mother&#x27;s accurate denunciation of him.

At the opera, Cécile meets the charming and handsome Chevalier Raphael Danceny, who becomes her music teacher. They fall in love with coaxing from Merteuil, who knows that Danceny, as a nobleman of lesser rank, naive, young, and not particularly wealthy, can never qualify as a bona fide suitor.

Valmont gains access to Cécile&#x27;s bedchamber on a pretext and sexually assaults her. As she pleads with him to leave, he blackmails her into giving up physical resistance, and the scene ends. On the pretext of illness, Cécile remains locked in her chambers, refusing all visitors. A concerned Madame de Volanges asks Merteuil to speak to Cécile; Cécile confides in Merteuil, naively assuming that she has Cécile&#x27;s best interests at heart. Merteuil advises Cécile to welcome Valmont&#x27;s advances; she says young women should take advantage of all the lovers they can acquire in a society so repressive and contemptuous of women. The result is a &quot;student-teacher&quot; relationship; by day, Cécile is courted by Danceny, and each night, she receives a sexual &quot;lesson&quot; from Valmont. Merteuil begins an affair with Danceny.

After a night in Valmont&#x27;s bed, Cécile miscarries her child. Meanwhile, Valmont has won Tourvel&#x27;s heart, but at a cost: the lifelong bachelor playboy falls in love. In a fit of jealousy, Merteuil mocks Valmont and refuses to honor her end of their agreement unless Valmont breaks up with Tourvel. Valmont abruptly dismisses Tourvel with a terse excuse: &quot;It&#x27;s beyond my control.&quot; Overwhelmed with grief and shame, Tourvel retreats to a monastery where her health deteriorates rapidly.

Despite the breakup, Merteuil still refuses to honor the agreement and even declares &quot;war.&quot; She informs Danceny that Valmont has been sleeping with Cécile. Danceny challenges Valmont to a duel, ending with the latter voluntarily running into Danceny&#x27;s sword. With his dying breath, Valmont asks Danceny to communicate to Tourvel his true feelings for her; he also warns Danceny about Meurteuil and gives him his collection of intimate letters from her as proof of the veracity of his warnings. Valmont tells Danceny to circulate them after he has read them.

After hearing Valmont&#x27;s message from Danceny, Tourvel dies. Meanwhile, following Valmont&#x27;s death, Merteuil sinks into madness and pain. Later, she attends a show at the opera but leaves after being booed by her former friends and sycophants, implying that all of Paris has learned the full range of her schemes and depredations due to Danceny&#x27;s circulation of the letters.

==Production==
&quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; was the first English-language film adaptation of Laclos&#x27;s novel. The screenplay was based on Christopher Hampton&#x27;s Olivier Award-winning and Tony Award-nominated theatrical adaptation for the Royal Shakespeare Company, directed by Howard Davies and featuring Lindsay Duncan, Alan Rickman and Juliet Stevenson.

The film was shot entirely on location in the Île-de-France region of northern France, and featured historical buildings such as the Château de Vincennes in Val-de-Marne, the Château de Champs-sur-Marne, the Château de Guermantes in Seine-et-Marne, the Château du Saussay in Essonne, and the Théâtre Montansier in Versailles.

&quot;Liaisons&quot; was the final film appearance of Academy Award and Tony Award-nominated actress Mildred Natwick. Drew Barrymore and Sarah Jessica Parker were considered for the role of Cécile before it went to Thurman. Annette Bening went through several auditions for the role of the courtesan Émilie, but in the end the role went to Laura Benson. Bening would go on to play the role of the Marquise de Merteuil in Miloš Forman&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&quot;, &quot;Valmont&quot;, a year later.

During production Malkovich had an affair with Pfeiffer. His six-year marriage to actress Glenne Headly ended shortly thereafter.

Thurman later revealed that she stripped for this film because she thought it was the right choice at the time despite her immense nervousness, but she hated how &quot;voyeuristic&quot; the final cut of the scene was and resolved not to go naked in a movie again.

==Soundtrack==
The score of &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; was written by the British film music composer George Fenton. The soundtrack also includes works by a number of baroque and classical composers, reflecting the story&#x27;s 18th-Century-French setting; pieces by Antonio Vivaldi, Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel and Christoph Willibald Gluck feature prominently, although no French composers are included.


==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; holds a score of 94% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 31 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Stylish, seductive, and clever, Stephen Frears&#x27; adaptation is a wickedly entertaining exploration of sexual politics.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 74 based on 17 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.

Pauline Kael in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described it as &quot;heaven – alive in a way that movies rarely are.&quot; Hal Hinson in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film&#x27;s &quot;wit and immediacy is extraordinarily rare in a period film. Instead of making the action seem far off, the filmmakers put the audience in the room with their characters.&quot; Roger Ebert called it &quot;an absorbing and seductive movie, but not compelling.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; considered it an &quot;incisive study of sex as an arena for manipulative power games.&quot; Vincent Canby in &quot;The New York Times&quot; hailed it as a &quot;kind of lethal drawing-room comedy.&quot;

The &quot;Time Out&quot; reviewer wrote of Christopher Hampton&#x27;s screenplay that &quot;one of the film&#x27;s enormous strengths is scriptwriter Christopher Hampton&#x27;s decision to go back to the novel, and save only the best from his play&quot;. James Acheson and Stuart Craig were also praised for their work, with Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stating that &quot;the film&#x27;s details of costuming (by &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;&#x27;s James Acheson) and production design (by Stuart Craig of &quot;Gandhi&quot; and &quot;The Mission&quot;) are ravishing&quot;. All three would go on to win Academy Awards for their work on this film.

Glenn Close received considerable praise for her performance; she was lauded by &quot;The New York Times&quot; for her &quot;richness and comic delicacy,&quot; while Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote that, once she &quot;finally lets loose and gives way to complete animal despair, Close is horrifying.&quot; Roger Ebert thought the two lead roles were &quot;played to perfection by Close and Malkovich... their arch dialogues together turn into exhausting conversational games, tennis matches of the soul.&quot;

Michelle Pfeiffer was widely acclaimed for her portrayal, despite playing, in the opinion of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;the least obvious and the most difficult&quot; role. &quot;Nothing is harder to play than virtue, and Pfeiffer is smart enough not to try. Instead, she embodies it.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; called her performance a &quot;happy surprise.&quot; Roger Ebert, considering the trajectory of her career, wrote that &quot;in a year that has seen her in varied assignments such as &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; and &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot;, the movie is more evidence of her versatility. She is good when she is innocent and superb when she is guilty.&quot; Pfeiffer would go on to win the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance.

The casting of John Malkovich proved to be a controversial decision that divided critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, while admitting there was the &quot;shock of seeing him in powdered wigs&quot;, concluded that he was &quot;unexpectedly fine. The intelligence and strength of the actor shape the audience&#x27;s response to him&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was similarly impressed with Malkovich&#x27;s performance: &quot;There&#x27;s a sublime perversity in Frears&#x27; casting, especially that of Malkovich... [he] brings a fascinating dimension to his character that would be missing with a more conventionally handsome leading man.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; was less impressed, stating that while the &quot;sly actor conveys the character&#x27;s snaky, premeditated Don Juanism... he lacks the devilish charm and seductiveness one senses Valmont would need to carry off all his conquests&quot;.

Uma Thurman gained recognition from critics and audiences; film critic Roger Ebert found her to be &quot;well cast&quot; in her &quot;tricky&quot; key role.

===Accolades===
==Related adaptations==
Almost 25 years after he played Valmont, John Malkovich directed a French-language version of Hampton&#x27;s play in Paris, which ran at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Atelier. In December 2012, the production was brought to Lansburgh Theatre by the Shakespeare Theatre Company for a limited run in Washington, D.C.

In 1989, the film &quot;Valmont&quot; was released starring Colin Firth, Annette Bening and Meg Tilly.

In 1999, the film &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; set the same story in present-day America, starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon.

In 2012, a Chinese version was released, starring Jang Dong-gun, Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung. It is loosely based on the novel itself and is set in 1930s Shanghai.

In 2018, the TV series &quot;The Great Seducer&quot; was released as a modern-day adaptation set in Korea starring Joy (singer), Moon Ga-young, Kim Min-jae (actor, born 1996) and Woo Do-hwan.

Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders parodied &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; on their sketch show French &amp; Saunders, which then inspired their 1999 comedy series &quot;Let Them Eat Cake&quot;.

In 2022, the series &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; premiered on premium television provider Starz. According to writer Harriet Warner, the series is loosely inspired by the novel and explores the marquise&#x27;s life before the events of the play.

<text>The Prospect of Whitby is a historic public house on the northern bank of the River Thames at Wapping, in the East End of London and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It lays claim to being on the site of the oldest riverside tavern, dating from around 1520.

==History==
The tavern was formerly known as &quot;The Pelican&quot; and later as the &quot;Devil’s Tavern&quot;, on account of its dubious reputation. All that remains from the building&#x27;s earliest period is the 400-year-old stone floor. The pub features 18th-century panelling and a 19th-century facade. The pub has a pewter-top bar and is decorated with many nautical objects. In former times it was a meeting place for sailors, smugglers, cutthroats and footpads. Sir Hugh Willoughby sailed from here in 1553 in a disastrous attempt to discover the North-East Passage to China.

According to John Stow, it was &quot;The usual place for hanging of pirates and sea-rovers, at the low-water mark, and there to remain till three tides had overflowed them&quot;. Execution Dock was actually by Wapping Old Stairs and was generally used for pirates. In the eighteenth century, the first fuchsia plant in the United Kingdom was sold at the pub.

Views from the pub were sketched by both Turner and Whistler. 

Following a fire in the early 19th century, the tavern was rebuilt and renamed &quot;The Prospect of Whitby&quot;, after a Tyne collier that used to berth next to the pub. The ship brought sea coal from Newcastle upon Tyne to London. The Prospect was listed as a Grade II listed building in December 1950. The pub underwent a renovation in 1951 to double the interior space. In January 1953, the pub was raided by armed robbers. The pub has been visited by Princess Margaret and Prince Rainier III of Monaco.

On the opposite side of the road (Wapping Wall) is the former Wapping Hydraulic Power Station, later an arts centre and restaurant.

==In popular culture==

There is a scene in the 1956 film &quot;D-Day the Sixth of June&quot;, starring Robert Taylor and Richard Todd, in which Taylor&#x27;s character is seen with Dana Wynter&#x27;s character having drinks in the pub during the Second World War.

The video for Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s 1970 hit &quot;Nothing Rhymed&quot; was shot here, as he was living close by in a bedsit when he wrote the song.

The pub features briefly in an episode of &quot;Only Fools And Horses&quot;. When Uncle Albert goes missing in one episode Del Boy and Rodney travel around London looking for him. Nicholas Lyndhurst is shown in one scene walking out of the pub. 

In the comicbook &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; Mina Harker pauses in front of the pub and says it brings back memories. She is referring to the beaching of the &quot;Demeter&quot; at Whitby in the novel &quot;Dracula&quot;.

The pub is also featured in &quot;Vercors&quot;&#x27;s novel &quot;Les Animaux dénaturés&quot;.

The pub also appears in &quot;Whitechapel&quot;, Series 4, Episode 4, in which the body of a victim is discovered on the Thames shoreline. DS Miles briefly explains its history to DI Chandler.

The pub features in several of Anna Harrington&#x27;s Regency-era romance novels, most notably in &quot;An Unexpected Earl&quot; and &quot;An Extraordinary Lord&quot;, both in the &quot;Lords of the Armory&quot; series. The recurring comic character Hugh Whitby in Harrington&#x27;s &quot;Capturing the Carlisles&quot; series was named after the pub. 

The pub also features in several of the Charles Holborne legal crime thrillers by former barrister, Simon Michael, particularly &quot;Corrupted&quot;, in which the protagonist and his family work as lightermen on the Thames during the Blitz. 

The pub also serves as the location for the final scenes in &quot;The Old Guard&quot; (2020).

<doc id="75944" wikidata="Q15051307" url="?curid=75944" title="Dragon Ball (manga)">
<text>&lt;/noinclude&gt;


 is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama. Originally serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from 1984 to 1995, the 519 individual chapters were collected in 42 volumes. &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; was inspired by the Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot; and Hong Kong martial arts films. It initially had a comedy focus but later became an action-packed fighting series. The story follows the adventures of Son Goku, from childhood to adulthood, as he trains in martial arts and explores the world in search of the Dragon Balls, seven magical orbs which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several friends and battles villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls.

The original manga was adapted into two anime series produced by Toei Animation: &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, which were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996; an anime sequel to &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, was broadcast from 1996 to 1997. A media franchise has built up around the series; among the merchandise, there have been both animated and live-action films, collectible trading card games, action figures, collections of soundtracks, and numerous video games. The series was licensed for an English-language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media, and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. The companies initially split the manga into two parts, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; to match the anime series but the most recent edition of the series was released under its original title.

&quot;Dragon Ball&quot; has become one of the most successful manga series of all time. Its initial serialization in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; was partly responsible for the magazine reaching its highest circulation of weekly sales. Its collected volumes have over 160 million copies sold in Japan and sold worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. Reviewers have praised the manga for its comedy, fight scenes, and pacing, while recognizing a coming-of-age theme and its use of cultural references from Chinese mythology and Japanese folktales. Complaints from parents in the United States resulted in English-language releases being edited to remove nudity, racial stereotypes, and other content.

Also regarded as one of the most influential manga series, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; has inspired numerous manga artists, including Eiichiro Oda (&quot;One Piece&quot;), Masashi Kishimoto (&quot;Naruto&quot;), and Tite Kubo (&quot;Bleach&quot;). A &quot;midquel&quot; series, titled &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, has been published in &quot;V Jump&quot; since 2015. It is written by Toriyama and illustrated by Toyotarou.

==Plot summary==
Son Goku, a monkey-tailed boy, and Bulma, a teenage girl, travel to find the seven Dragon Balls, which summon the dragon Shenlong to grant the user one wish. Their journey leads to the desert bandit Yamcha, who later becomes an ally; Chi-Chi, whom Goku unknowingly agrees to marry; and Pilaf, an impish man who seeks the Dragon Balls to fulfill his desire to rule the world. Goku undergoes rigorous training regimes under the martial arts master Kame-Sen&#x27;nin to fight in the . He becomes friends with a monk named Kuririn, his training partner and initial rival. After the tournament, Goku searches for the Dragon Ball his grandfather left him and almost single-handedly defeats the Red Ribbon Army and their hired assassin, Taopaipai. Goku then reunites with his friends to defeat the fortune teller Baba Uranai&#x27;s fighters and use her to find the last Dragon Ball in order to revive a friend killed by Taopaipai.

Three years later at the &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot;, Goku and his allies oppose Kame-Sen&#x27;nin&#x27;s rival and Taopaipai&#x27;s brother, Tsuru-Sen&#x27;nin, and his students Tenshinhan and Chaozu. Kuririn is killed after the tournament; Goku tracks down the murderer&#x27;s leader, Piccolo Daimao, but is defeated. The samurai Yajirobe takes Goku to the hermit Karin, who heals him and gives him a power boost. Meanwhile, Piccolo defeats and kills Kame-Sen&#x27;nin and Chaozu before using the Dragon Balls to regain his youth and destroy Shenlong. Goku then kills Piccolo Daimao, who, before dying, spawns his son/reincarnation Piccolo. Karin then directs Goku to Kami, the original creator of the Dragon Balls and Piccolo Daimao&#x27;s other half, to restore Shenlong and revive his slain friends. Goku trains under Kami for the next three years, once again reuniting with his friends at the &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot;. There, he defeats Piccolo, whose life he spares as it would also kill Kami. Goku leaves with Chi-Chi to keep his promise to marry her.

Five years later, Goku is a young adult and father to a son, Gohan. A man named Raditz arrives on Earth, identifies Goku as his younger brother Kakarrot, and reveals to him that they are members of a nearly extinct extraterrestrial race called the , who sent Goku to conquer Earth for them; however, Goku had suffered a severe head injury as an infant and lost all memories of his mission. Goku refuses to continue the mission, and sides with Piccolo to kill Raditz at the cost of his own life. In the afterlife, Goku trains under the North Kaiō until he is revived by the Dragon Balls to save the Earth from the invading Nappa and Vegeta. In the battle, Yamcha, Chaozu, Tenshinhan, and Piccolo are killed, and the Dragon Balls cease to exist. Kuririn and the galactic tyrant Freeza learn of another set of Dragon Balls on the planet , Piccolo&#x27;s homeworld. Bulma, Gohan, and Kuririn search for them to revive their friends and restore Earth&#x27;s Dragon Balls. Their goal leads to several battles with Freeza&#x27;s minions and Vegeta, the latter standing alongside the heroes to fight the Ginyu Force, a team of mercenaries. The long battle with Freeza ends when Goku transforms into a legendary and defeats him. Barely surviving, Freeza recovers and goes to Earth to take his revenge on Goku; however, he is killed by a Super Saiyan from the future named Trunks.

Three years later, a group of created by a member of the former Red Ribbon Army, Doctor Gero, appears, seeking revenge against Goku. During this time, an evil life form called Cell also emerges and, after absorbing two of the Androids to achieve his &quot;perfect form&quot;, holds his own fighting tournament to challenge the protagonists. After Goku sacrifices his own life to no avail, Gohan avenges his father by killing Cell. Seven years later Goku, briefly revived for one day, and his allies are drawn into a fight against Majin Boo. After many battles, including the destruction and re-creation of the Earth, a resurrected Goku destroys Boo with a &quot;Genki-Dama&quot; (a sphere of pure energy drawn from all intelligent beings on Earth) and wishes for him to be reincarnated as a &quot;good person&quot;. Ten years later, at the &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot;, Goku meets Boo&#x27;s human reincarnation, Oob. After testing his powers, Goku departs with Oob to train him to be the Earth&#x27;s new guardian.

===Writing===
Within roughly six months of creating the popular manga &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; in 1980, Akira Toriyama wanted to end the series but his publisher Shueisha would only allow him to do so if he agreed to start another serial for them shortly after. He worked with his editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, on several one-shots but none were successful. Torishima then suggested that, as Toriyama enjoyed kung fu films, he should create a kung fu manga. He was inspired by Hong Kong martial arts films such as Bruce Lee&#x27;s &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973) and Jackie Chan&#x27;s &quot;Drunken Master&quot; (1978). He was particularly influenced by the fight scenes in Jackie Chan movies, and said he would never have come up with &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; if he had not watched &quot;Drunken Master&quot;, which he enjoyed partly due to its light-hearted tone. This led to the two-part published in the August and October 1983 issues of &quot;Fresh Jump&quot;. It follows a boy, adept at martial arts, who escorts a princess on a journey back to her home country. &quot;Dragon Boy&quot; was very well-received and evolved to become the serial &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;.

The plot and characters of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; were loosely modeled on the classic Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, with Goku being Sun Wukong (&quot;Son Goku&quot; in Japanese), Bulma as Tang Sanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie, and Yamcha being Sha Wujing. Toriyama wanted to create a story with the basic theme of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, but with &quot;a little kung fu&quot; by combining the novel with elements from the kung fu films of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. Torishima said he chose the novel largely because it was a free intellectual property, but also because its Chinese setting was not common in manga at the time and would make it both unique and differentiate it from &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;″s US West Coast feel.

He changed the objective from &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, where the protagonists travel through the Western Regions (Central Asia) to collect sacred Buddhist texts from the Indian subcontinent, to something simpler, gathering seven orbs which grant a wish. Toriyama added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give the characters a game-like activity of gathering something in order to appeal to its manga magazine audience. His concept of the Dragon Balls was inspired by the epic Japanese novel &quot;Nansō Satomi Hakkenden&quot; (1814–1842), which involves the heroes collecting eight large Buddhist prayer beads of a necklace from eight different regions of Japan, which Toriyama adapted into finding seven Dragon Balls from seven different locations; he chose the number seven to avoid being the same as the number of beads in &quot;Hakkenden&quot;. The title &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; was inspired by &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; as well as later Bruceploitation knockoff kung fu movies which frequently had the word &quot;Dragon&quot; in the title. He originally thought the story would last about a year, or end once the Dragon Balls were collected. Toriyama said that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand, he specifically aimed &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; at an older audience than &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;.

The manga was not popular initially. Although he suspected the fighting genre would appeal more to its audience, Toriyama tried to stick to the &quot;Journey to the West&quot; adventure aspect which he himself enjoyed. Such as having the setting change each chapter, different enemies popping up, and different locations. It was only after he became tired of Torishima nagging about its popularity that Toriyama gave in and developed more battles with the first shown &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot;. Despite his reluctance, the author said it felt good when the series picked up in popularity at that point. However, he said he still tried to resist by returning to the adventure aspect with the Red Ribbon Army arc, and visiting Penguin Village from &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; to add comedy. When that did not work out, fighting became the main theme for the manga.

Toriyama said that by the second half of the series, he had become more interested in coming up with the story than drawing it, and that the battles became more intense by him simplifying the lines. He also said he would get letters from readers complaining that the art had become &quot;too square&quot;, so he intentionally made it more so. Years later he stated that because &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborately, suggesting that he was not interested in the art. As the manga progressed, Toriyama struggled with the Android and Cell arc, feeling that he could not outdo the Freeza arc. He added time travel, but said he had a hard time with the plot, only being able to think of what to do that week. After Cell&#x27;s death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series&#x27; protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for it and changed his mind. Even after the Cell arc, Toriyama felt it could not end there and so continued to the Majin Boo arc. Having resolved it would be the finale, he decided to draw what he wanted and inserted comedy with Gohan&#x27;s Great Saiyaman persona and the character Gotenks. However, he did not think of an ending until the final chapter. At the time, Toriyama said he gave &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; a low-key ending to make it seem as if the story might continue. But would later say he skipped 10 years ahead in the story to signal that it was truly the end. Wanting to make it even clearer that Goku&#x27;s battles were over, and a new generation was taking over, Toriyama slightly altered the ending for the re-release of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; which finished in 2004.

===Development===
Typically, when creating a manga chapter, an artist draws a rough draft or &quot;name&quot;, then a more detailed storyboard, and lastly the finalized version. However, Toriyama only draws a storyboard and then the final product simply because it is less work. He did not plan the details of his stories in advance. When he began the serialization of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, he had only prepared storyboards for three chapters. The author said that during its serialization he would wait about two days before his deadline to begin developing the storyboard. Starting around midnight, he would finish it around six in the morning and spend until that night inking, finishing everything in about a day-and-a-half. Unlike other artists, he had only one assistant helping him. Toriyama said that thinking only about the story for each chapter put him in some tight spots, particularly with Trunks&#x27; time travel. The only thing he has confidence in is his ability to connect a story back to an earlier aspect, making it seem to have been foreshadowing. The author used suggestions in fan mail he received, though generally doing the opposite of what was suggested. As an example, many fans told him not to kill Vegeta, which is exactly what he did.

Wanting to escape the Western themes that influenced &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;, Toriyama used Eastern/Oriental scenery in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. In addition to referencing Chinese buildings and scenery, the island where the &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot; is held is modeled on Bali (in Indonesia), which he visited in 1985. The area around Bobbidi&#x27;s spaceship was inspired by photos of Africa. When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid the difficulties of drawing residents and destroyed buildings. Toriyama wanted to set &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; in a fictional world largely based on Asia, taking inspiration from several Asian cultures including Japanese, Chinese, South Asian, Central Asian, Arabic, and Indonesian cultures. Toriyama was also inspired by the jinn (genies) from &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;. For the training scenes, Jackie Chan&#x27;s &quot;Drunken Master&quot; served as a reference. The author said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline was inspired by the beat &#x27;em up video game &quot;Spartan X&quot; (called &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; in the West), in which enemies appear very fast as the player ascends a tower (the game was in turn inspired by Jackie Chan&#x27;s &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; and Bruce Lee&#x27;s &quot;Game of Death&quot;), and that the fights were similar to the ones in the &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot;, just not in a tournament setting.

Toriyama personally dislikes the idea of naming fighting techniques, joking that in a real fight you would be killed before you could yell their names, but Torishima felt it would be best. Toriyama proceeded to create names for all the techniques, except for the series&#x27; signature which his wife came up with when he was indecisive about what it should be called. He even selected them specifically for each character, saying someone like Vegeta would use English names, and using kanji for the more sophisticated like Piccolo.

In order to advance the story quickly by having characters travel without inconvenience, he created the flying cloud , then gave most fighters the flying technique , and granted Goku the teleportation ability . While talking to his long-time friend and fellow manga artist Masakazu Katsura about how there was nothing stronger than a Super Saiyan, Katsura suggested having two characters &quot;fuse&quot; together, leading to the creation of the technique.

Toriyama enjoyed designing and drawing the distinctive machines of the series. He finds the most fun in designing original mecha, thinking about how a pilot enters and where the engine is. With real world items he would have to look at references, and being off even a little would be noticeable. He goes against whatever is popular at the time, explaining that when he was creating &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, most cars were very square, so he drew only round car designs.

In 1995, Toriyama detailed the equipment he used for &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. He used a G-pen nib by Zebra, usually getting three chapters out of one because he typically does not press down hard. Toriyama used black drawing ink made by Pilot, but his color ink was produced by Luma and applied with a ten-year-old fine point Tenshōdō brush. His whiteout was also made by Luma. He received free Kent paper, similar to Bristol board, from a seller connected to Shueisha, and used a 0.5mm 2B lead mechanical pencil and a wide ruler at least 30 cm long.

====Characters====
When creating a character, his process was to draw their face and body type first, and then the clothes, while thinking if the fighters can move around in them. He said that he does not draw &quot;bad guys&quot; so unscrupulous that it affects readers psychologically. This is not out of concern for others, but because he does not enjoy drawing such things. Few of his characters have screentone because he found it difficult to use. Toriyama was not concerned about consistency with the color of characters&#x27; clothes for the occasional color pages, having sometimes used different ones than he had before. He even specifically asked Torishima to produce as few color pages as possible. Character names are almost always puns sharing a theme with characters related to them, most commonly food. For example, all Saiyans are named after vegetables, being an anagram of the syllables for which means vegetable; such as taken from .

Going against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;″s most powerful characters, including Goku, with small statures. Toriyama explained that he had Goku grow up so that drawing fight scenes would be easier, even though Torishima was against it initially because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically. Torishima later referred to this as his own biggest crisis during the series, with Toriyama threatening to end it if Goku could not grow up. The editor said his concerns were unfounded, as readers accepted the change without complaint.

Having created Piccolo Daimao as the first truly evil villain, he said that his part of the series was the most interesting to draw. Freeza was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and inspired by real estate speculators, who Toriyama called the &quot;worst kind of people&quot;. Yū Kondō, Toriyama&#x27;s second editor, from the Saiyan arc until the appearance of Perfect Cell, and Fuyuto Takeda, his third editor from Perfect Cell until the end of the series, said that &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; hit its peak in popularity during the Freeza arc. In a one-thousand ballot popularity poll held in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; received 815 votes. Finding the escalating enemies difficult, Toriyama created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the manga.

When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan transformation during the Freeza arc, he gave Goku blond hair because it was easier to draw for Toriyama&#x27;s assistant, who spent a lot of time blacking in Goku&#x27;s hair. He also gave him piercing eyes, based on Bruce Lee&#x27;s paralyzing glare.

==Publication==
===Japanese publication===
&quot;Dragon Ball&quot; was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga anthology &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from November 20, 1984, to May 23, 1995. As the readership of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; grew up, the magazine changed to reflect their changing interests. The 519 individual chapters were collected in 42 volumes by Shueisha from September 10, 1985, through August 4, 1995. These saw any color or partly colored artwork grayscaled. With their predominantly white color and the singular picture that continues across their various spines, Torishima said the covers to these collected volumes were purposely designed to stick out on store bookshelves. For the series&#x27; 24th anniversary, the covers were revamped to a design that has been used on all reprints since 2009. Between December 4, 2002, and April 2, 2004, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; was released in a collection of 34 volumes that retain the color artwork from its &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; run. It received newly drawn cover illustrations by Toriyama, and each volume included a poster of their respective front cover image. These new illustrations were initially drawn in ink, scanned into a computer and colored using Corel Painter. Midway through, Toriyama changed to drawing them on a graphics tablet and coloring them with Adobe Photoshop. UV curing was used to add &quot;shine&quot; to the characters, and some characters are in monochrome up until volume 18. The edition was designed by Hideaki Shimada. Although Toriyama had already drafted the first four covers with a vibrant green, Shimada proposed bright red after seeing South Korea compete in the 2002 FIFA World Cup and he agreed. Wanting a &quot;neater&quot; look than the , Shimada decided to write &quot;Dragonball&quot; in lowercase and in a taller and thinner font. He also asked Toriyama to draw Shenlong with thick lines for use as the inside covers. It was an editor who suggested having a singular picture that continues across the various spines, but unlike the edition, the number of volumes was already determined, so they knew exactly how long it needed to be.

The December 2012 (cover date February 2013) issue of &quot;V Jump&quot; announced that parts of the manga would be fully colored digitally and re-released as &quot;Dragon Ball Full Color&quot;. 20 volumes, beginning from chapter 195 and grouped by story arcs, were released between February 4, 2013, and July 4, 2014. 12 volumes covering the first 194 chapters were published between January 4 and March 4, 2016. &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; was also released in a edition that aims to recreate the manga as it was originally serialized in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; in the same size, with the color pages, promotional text, and next chapter previews, in addition to foldout posters. Eighteen volumes of &quot;Dragon Ball Sōshūhen Chō Gōku Den&quot; were published between May 13, 2016, and January 13, 2017.

===English publication===
The English language version of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga is licensed for North America by Viz Media. Viz originally published the first 194 chapters as &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and chapters over 195 as &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; to mimic the names of the anime series, feeling it would reduce the potential for confusion by its readers. They initially released both series simultaneously, chapter by chapter in a monthly comic book format starting in 1998, before stopping in 2000 to switch to a graphic novel format similar to the Japanese . In 2000, while releasing &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; in the monthly format, Viz began to censor the manga in response to parental complaints about sexual innuendos. Viz changed their publishing format for the series again in 2003; the first 10 collected volumes of both series were re-released under their &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; imprint. They have slightly smaller dimensions. The manga was completed in English with &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; in 16 volumes between May 6, 2003, and August 3, 2004, and &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; in 26 volumes from May 6, 2003, to June 6, 2006. However, when publishing the last few volumes of &quot;Z&quot;, the company began to censor the series again by changing or removing gun scenes and changing the few sexual references. &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, from Trunks&#x27; appearance to chapter 226, was published in Viz&#x27;s monthly magazine &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; from its debut issue in January 2003 to April 2005.

Viz released both series in a wideban format called &quot;Viz Big Edition&quot;, which collects three volumes into a single large volume. &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; was published in five volumes between June 3, 2008, and August 18, 2009, while &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; was published in nine volumes between June 3, 2008, and November 9, 2010. Viz published new 3-in-1 volumes of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, similar to their Viz Big Edition, across 14 volumes between June 4, 2013, and September 6, 2016. This version uses some Japanese covers and marks the first time in English that the entire series was released under the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; name, though it is still censored. Viz serialized chapters 195 to 245 of the fully colored version of the manga in their digital anthology &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot; from February 2013 to February 2014. They published the Saiyan and Freeza arcs of &quot;Dragon Ball Full Color Edition&quot; in large format volumes between February 4, 2014, and January 3, 2017. Although it uses the same translation as their other versions, this release has some slight dialogue changes including censoring any profanity and abbreviating lengthy sentences. It also leaves the Japanese sound effects and word bubbles unaltered.

The manga has also been licensed in other English-speaking countries, distributed in the same Viz format separating it into &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;. From August 2005 to November 2007, Gollancz Manga, an imprint of the Orion Publishing Group released the 16 volumes of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and the first four of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; in the United Kingdom. Viz took over the UK license after Gollancz left the manga market. In Australia and New Zealand, Madman Entertainment has released all 16 volumes of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and the nine &quot;Viz Big&quot; volumes of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; between 2009 and 2010.

====Controversy in the United States====
The manga&#x27;s content has been controversial in the United States. In November 1999, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us removed Viz&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; from their stores nationwide when a Dallas parent complained that the series had &quot;borderline soft porn&quot; after he bought them for his four-year-old son. Commenting on the issue, manga critic Susan J. Napier determined the ban as a difference in culture due to Japan having tolerance for sexuality in manga while other countries do not. After the ban, Viz reluctantly began to censor the series in 2000 to maintain its wide distribution. Viz made some &quot;concessions&quot; as well, and assured readers that all changes were approved by Toriyama and Shueisha. Toriyama made suggestions himself such as obscuring Goku&#x27;s genitals with objects, rather than &quot;neuter him.&quot; A fan petition was created, garnering over 10,000 signatures, and a year later, Viz announced they would stop censoring &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and increased its &quot;age rating&quot; to 13 and up instead, reprinting the first three graphic novels. However, they continued to censor several characters&#x27; lips by shading them in completely. This avoided racist stereotypes, such as that of Mr. Popo&#x27;s image. In October 2009, Wicomico County Public Schools in Maryland banned the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga from their school district because it &quot;depicts nudity, sexual contact between children and sexual innuendo among adults and children.&quot; Esther Keller, Robin Brenner and Eva Volin of &quot;School Library Journal&quot; had no opinion on whether or not removing the manga from all schools in that district was right. However, Brenner and Volin criticized the parents who had a problem with the manga for going to a county council member who is involved with politics instead of to the librarian of the school that carried the manga.

===Other publications===
While &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; was licensed in the United States by Viz Media, it has been licensed in other countries as well for regional language releases in French by Glénat Editions, in Spanish by Planeta DeAgostini for European versions, and Panini Comics for Latin American versions, in Italian by Star Comics, in German by Carlsen Verlag, in Russian by Comix-ART, in Polish by Japonica Polonica Fantastica, and in Swedish by Bonnier Group.

==Spin-offs and crossovers==
A special side story, titled , was developed by Toriyama and published together with chapter 386 on August 31, 1992, in issue No. 36/37 of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;. Toriyama created a short series, &quot;Neko Majin&quot;, that became a self-parody of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. First appearing in August 1999, the eight-chapter series was released sporadically in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; and &quot;Monthly Shōnen Jump&quot; until it was completed in 2005. These chapters were compiled into one volume released on April 4, 2005.

In 2006, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo&quot; (or &quot;Kochikame&quot;), a special manga titled was released on September 15. It included characters from the series appearing in special crossover chapters of other well-known manga. The chapter was a &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; crossover by Toriyama and &quot;Kochikame&quot; author Osamu Akimoto. That same year, Toriyama teamed up with Eiichiro Oda to create a single crossover chapter of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;One Piece&quot;. Entitled &quot;Cross Epoch&quot;, the chapter was published in the Christmas 2006 issue of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; in Japanese and the April 2011 issue of &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; in English. The final chapter of Toriyama&#x27;s 2013 manga series &quot;Jaco the Galactic Patrolman&quot; revealed that it is set before &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, with several characters making appearances. &quot;Jaco&quot;″s collected volume contains a bonus &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; chapter revealing Goku&#x27;s mother. &quot;Jaco&quot; and the bonus chapter were both published by Viz in their digital English &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot;, and later in print.

&quot;Dragon Ball SD&quot; is a colored spin-off manga written and illustrated by Naho Ōishi was published in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Saikyō Jump&quot; magazine in December 2010. It is a condensed retelling of Goku&#x27;s various adventures, with many details changed, in a super deformed art style, hence the title. After four chapters, the quarterly &quot;Saikyō Jump&quot; switched to a monthly schedule. The chapters published after the monthly switch have been collected into five volumes as of February 2, 2018. &quot;Dragon Ball: Episode of Bardock&quot; is a three-chapter manga, once again penned by Naho Ōishi, that was published in the monthly magazine &quot;V Jump&quot; from August to October 2011. It is a sequel to the 1990 TV special &quot;Bardock – The Father of Goku&quot; with some key details changed. The manga&#x27;s story revolves around Bardock, Goku&#x27;s father, who is featured in a scenario where he did not die at the hands of Freeza and fights his enemy&#x27;s ancestor as a Super Saiyan.

On December 12, 2016, the first chapter of a spin-off manga titled was released in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Shōnen Jump+&quot; digital magazine. Written and illustrated by Dragongarow Lee, it is about a high school boy who wakes up after an accident in the body of Yamcha in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga. Knowing what comes later in the story, he trains as Yamcha to make him the strongest warrior. Utilizing the &quot;reincarnated in a parallel world&quot; theme popular in light novels, the series was conceived by &quot;Shōnen Jump+&quot; editor-in-chief Shuhei Hosono. A second chapter was released on May 8, 2017, and the final one on August 14, 2017. A collecting all three chapters was published on November 2, 2017, and has 240,000 copies in print. Viz licensed the series for English publication and released the collected volume on November 6, 2018.

==Reception==
===Sales===

&quot;Dragon Ball&quot; is one of the most popular manga series of all time. &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; is credited as one of the main reasons manga circulation was at its highest between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. During &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;″s initial run in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, the manga magazine reached an average circulation of 6.53million weekly sales, the highest in its history. During &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;″s serialization between 1984 and 1995, &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine had a total circulation of over 2.9billion copies.

The collected volumes of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; have sold in record numbers. By 2000, more than 126million copies had been sold in Japan. By 2008, it had over 150million copies in circulation and was the best-selling manga ever at the time. In 2012, Shueisha announced that its sales had grown to more than 156million, making it the second best-selling &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; manga of all time, behind &quot;One Piece&quot;. This number grew to 159.5million copies by 2014. By 2018, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; had a circulation (including the edition) of more than 160million in Japan. The total number of volumes sold have reached 260million copies worldwide by 2022.

===Popularity===
The manga is popular overseas, having been translated and released in over 40countries worldwide. For the 10th anniversary of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006, close to 79,000 Japanese fans voted &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; the third greatest manga of all time. In a 2007 survey of one-thousand people conducted by Oricon, Goku ranked in first place as the &quot;Strongest Manga Character of All Time&quot;. Coinciding with the 2012 Summer Olympics, Oricon conducted a survey at the international World Cosplay Summit on which manga and anime series attendees considered world class works. &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; was overwhelmingly in first place. In November 2014, readers of &quot;Da Vinci&quot; magazine voted &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; the greatest &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; manga series of all time. The Portuguese edition of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; won the 2001 Troféu HQ Mix for Best Serial. On TV Asahi&#x27;s Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; ranked fifth.

In 2011, manga critic and editor of Viz&#x27;s editions of the series Jason Thompson said that: &quot;&quot;Dragon Ball&quot; is by far the most influential shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot; artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways.&quot; Explaining its basic formula of &quot;lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, [and] a few jokes&quot; became the model for other series, such as &quot;Naruto&quot;. Thompson cited the artwork as influential, pointing out that popular manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had &quot;manly&quot; heroes, such as &quot;City Hunter&quot; and &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;, whereas &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; had the cartoonish and small Goku, thus starting a trend that he says still continues. Commenting on &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;″s global success nearly two decades after it ended, Toriyama said, &quot;Frankly, I don&#x27;t quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy. The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. I dare say I don&#x27;t care even if [my works] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers.&quot;

===Critical reception===
The manga has received a mostly positive reception from critics. Jason Thompson commented that &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; &quot;turns from a gag/adventure manga to a nearly-pure fighting manga&quot;. James S. Yadao, author of &quot;The Rough Guide to Manga&quot;, explains that the first several chapters &quot;play out much like &quot;Saiyuki&quot; (&quot;Journey to the West&quot;) with &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;-like humour built in&quot; and that &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;, Toriyama&#x27;s previous manga, has a clear early influence on the series. He feels the series &quot;established its unique identity&quot; after the first time Goku&#x27;s group disbands and he trains under Kame-Sen&#x27;nin. On the second half of the manga, he commented that it developed &quot;a far more action-packed, sinister tone&quot; with &quot;wilder&quot; battles and aerial and spiritual elements with an increased death count. David Brothers for ComicsAlliance wrote that: &quot;Like Osamu Tezuka and Jack Kirby before him, Toriyama created a story with his own two hands that seeped deep into the hearts of his readers, creating a love for both the cast and the medium at the same time.&quot; He said that while the author has &quot;a sublime combination of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;-style classic humor and dirty jokes,&quot; the best part of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; is the fight scenes. Brothers explained that while Western superhero comics &quot;would focus on a series of cool poses or impact shots&quot; with the reader having to fill in the blanks between panels, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; has a panel dedicated to one action and the next panel features the very next maneuver, making them incredibly easy to follow.

Fusanosuke Natsume says that the theme of disaster and growth in the manga is a reference to &quot;post-War Japanese manga&quot; that Osamu Tezuka began in the mid 1940s. He also comments that the violence in the manga has context that children can understand, and is not just there at random. While Toriyama has said that &quot;Journey to the West&quot; was an influence on the manga, Xavier Mínguez-López comments that it is a parody of the Chinese novel, since the stories are similar. He notes that Toriyama uses Chinese mythology and Japanese folktales, the dragon Shenlong who is summoned from the Dragon Balls, as well as characters who are able to come back to life as examples of similarities. Rachel Cantrell says that the manga parodies martial arts very well, and mentions how Toriyama uses panels to a full extent. She notes that the manga has a coming-of-age theme due to how the story captures Goku from a child to an adult. Dr. Frédéric Ducarme compared Goku&#x27;s backstory to that of Superman, with whom the character has often been compared, but wrote that Goku remains a sportsman throughout the manga, not an avenger or vigilante.

Carlo Santos of the Anime News Network described &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;″s setting as &quot;a melting pot of sci-fi, fantasy, and folklore&quot;. Santos praised its quick development of new characters and storylines, and claimed that the series&#x27; crowning achievement is in its dynamic fight scenes. However, he did not enjoy the cliché training and tournament segments, nor its crude humor. His colleague Allen Divers praised the manga&#x27;s story and humor as being very good at conveying all the characters&#x27; personalities. Divers also called Viz&#x27;s translation one of the best of all the English editions of the series due to its faithfulness to the original Japanese. &quot;Animerica&quot; felt the series had &quot;worldwide appeal,&quot; using dramatic pacing and over-the-top martial arts action to &quot;maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on the audience&#x27;s attention spans&quot;. Comic Book Bin&#x27;s Leroy Douresseaux described Toriyama as a &quot;super-cartoonist,&quot; a blend of Carl Barks, Jack Kirby, and Peyo. He gave &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; a perfect rating and called it one of the best manga and comic books he has ever read. Ridwan Khan of Animefringe.com commented that the manga had a &quot;chubby&quot; art style, but as the series continued the characters became more refined, leaner, and more muscular. He cited one slight problem in Viz&#x27;s release; the translation uses informal language to capture Goku&#x27;s country accent, but it ends up feeling &quot;forced and odd&quot;. Khan prefers the manga over the slow pacing of the anime adaptations. Including it on a list of &quot;10 Essential Manga That Should Belong in Every Comic Collection&quot;, Matthew Meylikhov of &quot;Paste&quot; also praised the manga over the anime as an entirely different and more &quot;involved experience.&quot; He wrote that &quot;You come to know and care for the characters more intimately, and the joy and wonder of watching them fight, learn and grow throughout the series improves tenfold.&quot; Manga author Nobuhiro Watsuki commented that there was a shift in the traditional portrayal of protagonists and their adversaries engaging in killings in manga after &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; started a trend of bringing characters back to life.

==Legacy and cultural impact==
&quot;Dragon Ball&quot; is considered one of the most influential manga of all time. Many manga artists have cited it and Toriyama as inspirations, including &quot;Fairy Tail&quot; and &quot;Rave&quot; author Hiro Mashima, &quot;Black Clover&quot; creator Yūki Tabata, and &quot;&quot; illustrator Mikio Ikemoto. Both &quot;One Piece&quot; creator Eiichiro Oda and &quot;Naruto&quot; creator Masashi Kishimoto have said that Goku inspired their series&#x27; main protagonists as well as their structures. For the re-release of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, every odd-numbered volume included a tribute illustration by a popular manga artist who was a child when it was serialized, accompanied with a few words about how the series influenced them. The artists who contributed include: &quot;Bleach&quot; creator Tite Kubo, &quot;Black Cat&quot; author Kentaro Yabuki, &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot; author Nakaba Suzuki, &quot;Eyeshield 21&quot; and &quot;One-Punch Man&quot; illustrator Yusuke Murata, &quot;Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo&quot; creator Yoshio Sawai, &quot;Pretty Face&quot; author Yasuhiro Kanō, &quot;Mr. Fullswing&quot; author Shinya Suzuki, &quot;Hellsing&quot; creator Kouta Hirano, &quot;Claymore&quot; author Norihiro Yagi, &quot;Phantom Thief Jeanne&quot; and &quot;Full Moon o Sagashite&quot; creator Arina Tanemura, &quot;Excel Saga&quot; author Rikdo Koshi, &quot;Dragon Drive&quot; creator Kenichi Sakura, and &quot;Happy World!&quot; author Kenjiro Takeshita. French comics artist Tony Valente cited &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; as an influence, especially the adventure aspect of its early portion. The producer of the &quot;Tekken&quot; video game series, Katsuhiro Harada, said that &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; was one of the first works to visually depict chi and thereby influenced &quot;Tekken&quot; and other Japanese games such as &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. Ian Jones-Quartey, a producer of the American animated series &quot;Steven Universe&quot;, is a fan of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;, and uses Toriyama&#x27;s vehicle designs as a reference for his own. He also stated that &quot;We&#x27;re all big Toriyama fans on [&quot;Steven Universe&quot;], which kind of shows a bit.&quot; French director Pierre Perifel cited Toriyama and &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; as influences on his DreamWorks Animation film &quot;The Bad Guys&quot;.
After searching for a real-life equivalent to the supernaturally nutritious &quot;Senzu&quot; seen in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, Mitsuru Izumo founded Euglena Company in 2005 and started making supplements and food products out of &quot;Euglena&quot;. In 2014, entomologist Enio B. Cano named a new species of beetle &quot;Ogyges toriyamai&quot; after Toriyama, and another &quot;Ogyges mutenroshii&quot;, after the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; character Muten Roshi.

On March 27, 2013, the &quot;Akira Toriyama: The World of Dragon Ball&quot; exhibit opened at the Takashimaya department store in Nihonbashi, attracting 72,000 visitors in its first nineteen days. The exhibit is separated into seven areas. The first provides a look at the series&#x27; history, the second shows the series&#x27; 400-plus characters, the third displays Toriyama&#x27;s manga manuscripts of memorable scenes, the fourth shows special color illustrations, the fifth displays rare &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;-related materials, the sixth includes design sketches and animation cels from the anime, and the seventh screens &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;-related videos. It remained until April 15 when it moved to Osaka from April 17 to 23, and ended in Toriyama&#x27;s native Nagoya from July 27 to September 1.

An interactive exhibit called was displayed in Nagoya in summer 2014. Installations included an EEG that measured visitors&#x27; alpha brain waves to move Goku&#x27;s flying cloud. The following year it went to Taiwan, then Tokyo from April 29 to May 10, and Osaka between July 18 and August 31. A retrospective exhibit called &quot;The Beginning of the Legend&quot; featured &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; along with other popular &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; manga for the 50th anniversary of the magazine in 2018.

In 2015, the Japan Anniversary Association officially declared May 9 as . In Japanese the numbers five and nine can be pronounced as &quot;Go&quot; and &quot;Ku&quot;. In October 2016, Shueisha announced they had created a new department on June 21 called the . Headed by &quot;V Jump&quot; editor-in-chief Akio Iyoku, it is dedicated solely to &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and optimizing and expanding the brand.

Nobuyuki Sakakibara, the founder of Pride Fighting Championships and Rizin Fighting Federation, noted how Toriyama conceived of a tournament featuring martial artists of various disciplines competing against each other with the &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot; in 1985, before mixed martial arts was coined or established. Canadian mixed martial artist Carlos Newton dubbed his fighting style &quot;Dragon Ball jiu-jitsu&quot; in tribute to the series. Japanese mixed martial artist Itsuki Hirata is nicknamed &quot;Android 18&quot; due to her resemblance to the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; character. Japanese kickboxer Panchan Rina took her nickname from the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; character Pan.

<doc id="75945" wikidata="Q545424" url="?curid=75945" title="John I, Duke of Brabant">
<text>John I, also called John the Victorious (1252/533 May 1294) was Duke of Brabant (1267–1294), Lothier and Limburg (1288–1294). During the 13th century, John I was venerated as a folk hero. He has been painted as the perfect model of a brave, adventurous and chivalrous feudal prince.

==Life==

Born in Leuven, he was the son of Henry III, Duke of Brabant and Aleidis of Burgundy, daughter of Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy. He was also an older brother of Maria of Brabant, Queen consort of Philip III of France. In 1267 his older brother Henry IV, Duke of Brabant, being mentally deficient, was deposed in his favour.

John&#x27;s greatest military victory was the Battle of Worringen 1288, by which John I came to reign over the Duchy of Limburg. He was completely outnumbered in forces but led the successful invasion into the Rhineland to defeat the confederacy. In 1288 Limburg was formally attached to Brabant.

John I was said to be a model of feudal prince: brave, adventurous; excelling in every form of active exercise, fond of display, and generous in temper. He was considered one of the most gifted princes of his time. This made him very popular in Middle Ages poetry and literature. Even today there exists an ode to him, so well known that it was a potential candidate to be the North Brabant anthem. John I delighted in tournaments and was always eager to take part in jousts. He was also famous for his many illegitimate children.

On 3 May 1294 at some marriage festivities at Bar-le-Duc, John I was mortally wounded in the arm in an encounter by Pierre de Bausner. He was buried in the church of the Order of Friars Minor (Minderbroederskerk) in Brussels, but since the Protestant iconoclasm (&quot;Beeldenstorm&quot;) in 1566, nothing remains of his tomb.

==Family and children==

John was married twice. On 5 September 1270, he married Margaret, daughter of Louis IX of France and Margaret of Provence. They had a son, but both mother and child died shortly after his birth.

In 1273, John married Margaret (d. 3 July 1285), daughter of Guy, Count of Flanders and had the following children:
# Godfrey (1273/74 – aft. 13 September 1283).
# John II of Brabant (1275–1312).
# Margaret (4 October 127614 December 1311, Genoa), married 9 July 1292 to Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor.
# Marie (d. after 2 December 1338), married to Count Amadeus V of Savoy.

John I had several illegitimate children:

# Gillis van der Balcht
# Jean Meuwe, Seigneur of Wavre and Dongelberg.
# Margareta of Tervuren, she was married on 2 March 1292 to Jean de Rode de Lantwyck
# Jan Pylyser (1272–1342)
# Jan van der Plasch

==Legacy==
The duke is remembered in the folkish song Harbalorifa that remains popular. The popular Dutch beer Hertog Jan was named after the duke. Also the beer Primus of the is named after John I (Jan Primus).

<doc id="75952" wikidata="Q60847808" url="?curid=75952" title="Saint-Germain-en-Laye">
<text>Saint-Germain-en-Laye () is a commune in the Yvelines department in the Île-de-France in north-central France. It is located in the western suburbs of Paris, from the centre of Paris.

Inhabitants are called &quot;Saint-Germanois&quot; or &quot;Saint-Germinois&quot;. With its elegant tree-lined streets it is one of the more affluent suburbs of Paris, combining both high-end leisure spots and exclusive residential neighborhoods (see the Golden Triangle of the Yvelines).

Saint-Germain-en-Laye is a sub-prefecture of the department. Because it includes the National Forest of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, it covers approximately , making it the largest commune in the Yvelines. It occupies a large loop of the Seine. Saint-Germain-en-Laye lies at one of the western termini of Line A of the RER.

==History==

Saint-Germain-en-Laye was founded in 1020 when King Robert the Pious (ruled 996–1031) founded a convent on the site of the present Church of Saint-Germain.

In 1688, James II of England exiled himself to the city after being deposed from the throne in what has become known as the Glorious Revolution. He spent the remainder of his days there, and died on 16 September 1701.

Prior to the French Revolution in 1789, it had been a royal town and the Château de Saint-Germain the residence of numerous French monarchs. The old château was constructed in 1348 by King Charles V on the foundations of an old castle (&quot;château-fort&quot;) dating from 1238 in the time of Saint Louis. Francis I was responsible for its subsequent restoration. In 1862, Napoleon III set up the &quot;Musée des Antiquités Nationales&quot; in the erstwhile royal château. This museum has exhibits ranging from Paleolithic to Celtic times. The &quot;Dame de Brassempouy&quot; sculpted on a mammoth&#x27;s ivory tusk around 23,000 years ago is the most famous exhibit in the museum.

Kings Henry IV and Louis XIII left their mark on the town. Louis XIV was born in the château (the city&#x27;s coat of arms consequently shows a cradle and the date of his birth), and established Saint-Germain-en-Laye as his principal residence from 1661 to 1681. Louis XIV turned over the château to James VII &amp; II of Scotland and England after his exile from Britain after the Glorious Revolution in 1688. James lived in the Château for 13 years, and his daughter Louisa Maria Stuart was born in exile here in 1692. James II is buried in the parish church.

Saint-Germain-en-Laye is famous for its long stone terrace built by André Le Nôtre from 1669 to 1673. The terrace provides a view over the valley of the Seine and, in the distance, Paris. During the French Revolution, the name was changed along with many other places whose names held connotations of religion or royalty. Temporarily, Saint-Germain-en-Laye became Montagne-du-Bon-Air. During his reign, Napoleon I established his cavalry officers training school in the Château-Vieux.

The Treaty of Saint-Germain was signed in 1919 and was applied on 16 July 1920. The treaty officially registered the breakup of the Habsburg empire, which recognized the independence of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, and the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (Yugoslavia).

During the occupation from 1940 to 1944, the town was the headquarters of the Oberbefehlshaber West, the commander of the German armed forces on the Western Front. It has been called &quot;the most occupied city in France.&quot;

On 1 January 2019, the former commune Fourqueux was merged into Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

===Saint-Germain parish church===

The parish church, which is dedicated to Germain of Paris, was originally constructed in the eleventh century, and the present building (the fourth on the site) was built in the 1820s in a Neoclassical style, with six Tuscan columns supporting a pediment on the main façade. The church houses the mausoleum of James II of England and was visited by Queen Victoria in 1855.

The organ, originally installed in 1698, was rebuilt by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll in the nineteenth century and refurbished in 1903. The church&#x27;s organists have included Albert Renaud (1891–1924), Albert Alain (1924–1971) and Marie-Claire Alain (1971–2010).
