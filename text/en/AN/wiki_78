==History==
===18th century===

Originally called Hickory Town, Lancaster was renamed after the English city of Lancaster by native John Wright. Its symbol, the red rose, is from the House of Lancaster. Lancaster was part of the 1681 Penn&#x27;s Woods Charter of William Penn, and was laid out by James Hamilton in 1734. It was incorporated as a borough in 1742 and incorporated as a city in 1818.

In the summer of 1744 the Lancaster courthouse was the venue for an important colonial treaty between the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and the Provinces of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. Conrad Weiser served as interpreter, and the text of the treaty was soon after published by Benjamin Franklin.

During the American Revolution, Lancaster served for one day as the temporary capital of the United States, seated at the Court House (built 1739, destroyed by fire in 1784 and rebuilt before relocating to current Lancaster County Courthouse in 1852; original site is now the Soldiers &amp; Sailors Monument at Penn Square c. 1874), on September 27, 1777, after the Continental Congress fled Philadelphia, which had been captured by the British. The revolutionary government then moved still farther away to York, Pennsylvania.

===19th century===

Lancaster was the capital of Pennsylvania from 1799 to 1812, with the state capital located at the Court House (built 1784 and demolished 1852 and now site of Soldiers &amp; Sailors Monument at Penn Square). In 1812, the capital was moved to Harrisburg, where it has remained since.

U.S. census reports show that, from 1800 to 1900, Lancaster ranked among the nation&#x27;s top 100 most populous urban areas.

In 1851, the current Lancaster County Prison, known locally as Lancaster Castle, was built in the city but shares no visual similarities with the Lancaster Castle in England. The prison remains in use, and was used for public hangings until 1912. It replaced a 1737 structure on a different site.

The first long-distance paved road in the United States was the former Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike, which connected the cities of Lancaster and Philadelphia. Opened in 1795, the turnpike was paved with stone the whole way, and overlaid with gravel. The sixty-two-mile turnpike cost more than $450,000, a staggering sum for the time. The route followed what is now Pennsylvania Route 340 (also called the &quot;Old Philadelphia Pike&quot;) from Lancaster to Thorndale and U.S. Route 30 Business and U.S. Route 30 from Thorndale to Philadelphia.

The city of Lancaster was home to several important figures in American history. Wheatland, the estate of James Buchanan, the fifteenth President of the United States, is one of Lancaster&#x27;s most popular attractions. Thaddeus Stevens, considered among the most powerful members of the United States House of Representatives, lived in Lancaster as an attorney. Stevens gained notoriety as a Radical Republican and for his abolitionism. The Fulton Opera House in the city was named for Lancaster native Robert Fulton, a renaissance man who created the first fully functional steamboat. All of these individuals have had local schools named after them.

After the American Revolutionary War, Lancaster became an iron-foundry center. Two of the most common products needed by pioneers to settle the Frontier were manufactured in Lancaster: the Conestoga wagon and the Pennsylvania long rifle. The Conestoga wagon was named after the Conestoga River, which runs through the city. The innovative gunsmith William Henry lived in Lancaster and was a U.S. Congressman and leader during and after the American Revolution.

In 1803, Meriwether Lewis visited Lancaster to be educated in survey methods by the well-known surveyor Andrew Ellicott. During his visit, Lewis learned to plot latitude and longitude as part of his overall training needed to lead the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

In 1879, Franklin Winfield Woolworth opened his first successful five and dime store in the city of Lancaster, the F. W. Woolworth Company.

Lancaster receives 20 times more refugees per capita than the rest of the United States, leading it to be dubbed &quot;America&#x27;s refugee capital&quot; in 2015. Between 2005 and 2019, nearly 5,000 refugees were resettled in Lancaster. Lancaster announced its designation as a Certified Welcoming City in 2019. Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai visited Lancaster in 2017 to honor its commitment to refugees, an experience she detailed in her book &quot;We Are Displaced&quot;.

==Name and origin==
The name is often shortened to &quot;Mt Joy&quot;, as in Mencken (1963). However, citizens of the town often point out that this abbreviation is not proper because the town is not named for a mountain but is named after the &quot;Good Ship&quot; &quot;Mountjoy&quot; which famously broke a Catholic siege during the Siege of Derry. Due to the early settlement of the Protestant Scots-Irish in this region of Pennsylvania, many of the municipalities in the area were given names common to the North of Ireland, such as Derry Township, Londonderry Township, South Londonderry Township, Mount Joy Township, East Donegal Township, West Donegal Township, and Rapho Township.

Mount Joy is often named in lists of &quot;delightfully-named towns&quot; in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, along with Intercourse, Blue Ball, Lititz, Bareville, Bird-in-Hand and Paradise.

<doc id="82390" wikidata="Q3029740" url="?curid=82390" title="Dirty Weekend (1993 film)">
<text>Dirty Weekend is a 1993 British film directed by Michael Winner, based on the 1991 novel by Helen Zahavi. It was banned from video release for two years by the BBFC for its violent and sexual content.

&quot;Dirty Weekend&quot; is a film set in Brighton, England, where Bella, a secretary, becomes a victim of Tim, a voyeur who harasses her. After the police provide no assistance, Bella consults an Iranian clairvoyant, Nimrod, who encourages her to take matters into her own hands. She kills Tim and goes on a murder spree, ultimately evading capture. Filming took place in London and Brighton, facing some equipment theft during production. Critical reception was largely negative, with reviewers criticizing the acting, direction, and screenplay, and comparing it unfavorably to other female revenge films. The cast includes Lia Williams as Bella, Rufus Sewell as Tim, and Ian Richardson as Nimrod.

==Synopsis==
Set in the coastal town of Brighton, England, &quot;Dirty Weekend&quot; follows the story of Bella, a mild-mannered secretary who works from home in a basement flat. Soon, she finds herself the victim of Tim, a voyeur who watches her through her windows and plagues her with obscene phone calls in which he threatens to assault and rape her. After the police refuse to offer any assistance, Bella visits Nimrod, an Iranian clairvoyant who suggests that she take matters into her own hands.

That night, Bella breaks into Tim&#x27;s flat while he is sleeping and batters him to death with a claw hammer. Empowered, Bella embarks on a spree in which she slaughters six more men by a variety of methods. Ultimately, she evades capture by the authorities and prepares to carry on her murderous rampage in the large, faceless city of London.

==Production==
Filming took place in the Notting Hill and Kensington areas of London and also in Brighton. The Internet Movie Database lists other locations. The gun shop scenes were filmed at Park Street Guns near St Albans; the country pub (now demolished) was the Grenville Lodge, East Burnham (Burnham Beeches), Buckinghamshire; and the dentist scenes were shot at a real dental practice in Twickenham, Greater London.

Theft of equipment was a problem during filming. While filming in Brighton, all the catering equipment was stolen and in Notting Hill Gate, a mobile kitchen with generator was stolen.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; described &quot;Dirty Weekend&quot; as &quot;a sleazy little tale of a female vigilante, directed and acted in a perfunctory, over-emphatic manner&quot;. Sheila Johnston&#x27;s assessment of &quot;Dirty Weekend&quot; was also negative: &quot;no window-dressing can hide the fact that an aura of indelible naffness hangs over the movie...the screenplay is hewn out from Helen Zahavi&#x27;s over-written novel with no concessions to the way people actually speak&quot;. Johnston argued &quot;Dirty Weekend&quot; was inferior to other female revenge films such as &quot;Ms. 45&quot; and &quot;Lipstick&quot;. Johnston also criticised the making up of the white actor Richardson with &quot;brownface&quot; to portray a Middle Easterner. &quot;The Observer&quot; review claimed &quot;Dirty Weekend&quot; has &quot;a certain factitious topicality&quot;, but went on to state &quot;a work so bad in every way, and mostly risibly so, cannot be the focus of serious controversy&quot;. Brian Case, reviewing the film for &quot;Time Out&quot;, dismissed &quot;Dirty Weekend&quot; as &quot;pretty rotten&quot;, and criticised Winner&#x27;s direction, stating it resembled &quot;out-takes from local cinema advertising, which distances the audience from the material and indeed from wakefulness itself&quot;.

<text>MetaComCo (MCC) was a computer systems software company started in 1981 and based in Bristol, England by Peter Mackeonis and Derek Budge. A division of Tenchstar, Ltd.

MetaComCo&#x27;s first product was an MBASIC compatible interpreter for IBM PCs, which was licensed by Peter Mackeonis to Digital Research in 1982, and issued as the Digital Research Personal Basic, running under CP/M. Other computer languages followed, also licensed by Digital Research and MetaComCo established an office in Pacific Grove, California, to service their United States customers.

In 1984 Dr. Tim King joined the company, bringing with him a version of the operating system TRIPOS for the Motorola 68000 processor which he had previously worked on whilst a researcher at the University of Cambridge.

This operating system was used as the basis of AmigaDOS (file-related functions of AmigaOS); MetaComCo won the contract from Commodore because the original planned Amiga disk operating system called Commodore Amiga Operating System (CAOS) was behind schedule; timescales were incredibly tight and TRIPOS provided a head start for a replacement system.

MetaComCo also developed ABasiC for the Amiga, the first BASIC interpreter provided with Amigas. MetaComCo also worked with Atari Corporation to produce the BASIC initially provided with the Atari ST in 1985: ST BASIC.

The company also sold the Lattice C compiler for the Sinclair QL and the Atari ST and range of other languages (e.g. Pascal, BCPL) for m68k-based computers. MetaComCo also represented LISP and REDUCE software from the RAND Corporation.

Several of the team at MetaComCo went on to found Perihelion Software. Mackeonis founded Triangle Publishing, the software publishing company responsible for creating the &quot;ST Organizer&quot; for the Atari ST and &quot;PC Organizer&quot; and &quot;Counterpoint&quot; (a GUI system) for Amstrad Computers and GoldStar computers.

MetaComCo BASIC was available on the Singapore Teleview videotext receiver.

MetaComCo was disestablished in 1988

<doc id="82394" wikidata="Q471461" url="?curid=82394" title="Julio César Chávez">
<text>Julio César Chávez González (; born July 12, 1962), also known as Julio César Chávez Sr., is a Mexican former professional boxer who competed from 1980 to 2005. A multiple-time world champion in three weight divisions, Chávez was listed by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine as the world&#x27;s best boxer, pound for pound, from 1990 to 1993. During his career he held the WBC super featherweight title from 1984 to 1987, the WBA and WBC lightweight titles between 1987 and 1989, the WBC light welterweight title twice between 1989 and 1996, and the IBF light welterweight title from 1990 to 1991. He also held the &quot;&quot;Ring&quot;&quot; magazine and lineal lightweight titles from 1988 to 1989, and the lineal light welterweight title twice between 1990 and 1996. Chávez was named Fighter of the Year for 1987 and 1990 by the Boxing Writers Association of America and &quot;The Ring&quot; respectively.

Chávez holds records for the most total successful defenses of world titles (27, shared with Omar Narváez), most title fight victories and fighters beaten for the title (both at 31), and most title fights (37); he has the second most title defenses won by knockout (21, after Joe Louis with 23). His fight record was 89 wins, 0 losses, and 1 draw before his first professional loss to Frankie Randall in 1994, before which he had an 87-fight win streak until his draw with Pernell Whitaker in 1993. Chávez&#x27;s 1993 win over Greg Haugen at the Estadio Azteca set the record for the largest attendance for an outdoor boxing match: 136,274.

He is ranked as the 17th best boxer of all time, pound for pound, by BoxRec, #24 on ESPN&#x27;s list of &quot;50 Greatest Boxers of All Time&quot;, and 18th on &quot;The Ring&quot;&#x27;s &quot;80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years&quot;. In 2010 he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame for the Class of 2011. He is the father of current boxers Omar Chávez and former WBC middleweight champion Julio César Chávez Jr.

==Early life==
Julio César Chávez was born on July 12, 1962, in Ciudad Obregón, Sonora, Mexico. His father, Rodolfo Chavez, worked for the railroad, and Julio grew up in an abandoned railroad car with his five sisters and four brothers. Chávez came from a poor family and became a boxer for money, he stated: &quot;I saw my mom working, ironing, and washing people&#x27;s clothes, and I promised her I would give her a house someday, and she would never have that job again.&quot; He began boxing as an amateur at the age of 16 and he then moved to Tijuana to pursue a professional career.

==Professional career==
Chávez made his professional debut at age 17. In his 12th fight, on March 4, 1980, Chávez faced Miguel Ruiz in Culiacán, Sinaloa. At the end of the first round, Chavez landed a blow that knocked Ruiz out. Delivered as the bell sounded, the blow was ruled a disqualification in the ring and Ruiz was declared the winner. The next day, however, his manager, Ramón Felix, consulted with the Mexican Boxing Commission, and after further review, the result was overturned and Chávez was declared the winner.

===Super featherweight===
Chávez won his first championship, the vacant WBC Super Featherweight title, on September 13, 1984, by knocking out fellow Mexican Mario &quot;Azabache&quot; Martínez at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles. Martínez had been the betting favorite in the bout, due partly to his previous victory over former WBC world champion Rolando Navarette in a non-title bout. On April 19, 1985, Chávez defended his title against number one ranked contender Ruben Castillo (63–4–2) by knocking him out in the sixth round. On July 7, 1985, Chavez defeated former and future champion Roger Mayweather via a second-round knockout. On August 3, 1986, Chavez won a twelve-round majority decision over former WBA and future IBF Super Featherweight champion Rocky Lockridge in Monte Carlo. In his next bout, he defeated former champion Juan Laporte by a twelve-round unanimous decision. On March 18, 1987, he defeated number one ranked challenger Francisco Tomas Da Cruz (27–1) by third-round knockout. He successfully defended his WBC Super Featherweight title a total of nine times.

===Lightweight===

On November 21, 1987, Chávez moved up to the lightweight division and faced WBA Lightweight Champion Edwin Rosario. Prior to the bout, there were concerns about how Chávez would handle the move up in weight. Chávez commented, &quot;Everything I&#x27;ve accomplished as champion, and the nine title defenses, would be thrown away with a loss to Rosario.&quot; The two fighters nearly exchanged blows during a press conference after Rosario threatened to send Chávez back to Mexico in a coffin. Chávez would ultimately give a career-defining performance as he defeated Rosario by an eleventh-round TKO to win the title. HBO Punchstat showed Rosario landing 263 of 731 punches thrown in the fight (36%) and Chavez 450 of 743 (61%). After the bout, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ran the headline, &quot;Time To Hail César: WBA Lightweight Champion César Chávez of Mexico may be the world&#x27;s best fighter.&quot;

On April 16, 1988, Chávez defeated number one ranked contender Rodolfo Aguilar (20–0–1) by sixth-round technical knockout. On June 4, 1988, he won against former two-time champion Rafael Limón by scoring a seventh-round TKO. Later that year, he unified the WBA and WBC belts by a technical decision win over champion José Luis Ramírez. An accidental head-butt opened a cut on Ramírez&#x27;s forehead and the doctor halted the fight, sending the decision to the judges&#x27; scorecards at that point in the fight. Chávez, ahead on all scorecards, was declared the winner. He was also awarded &quot;The Ring&quot; Lightweight title after the victory. Chavez vacated his WBA and WBC Lightweight titles in order to move up to the super lightweight division.

===Light welterweight===
In his next bout, he won the WBC Light Welterweight title by defeating Roger Mayweather for a second time. Mayweather did not come out of his corner after the tenth round, giving Chavez the TKO win. In 1989, Chávez defeated future champion Sammy Fuentes by tenth-round TKO. In his next bout, he handed Alberto de las Mercedes Cortes (44–0) his first career loss by scoring a third-round knockout.

==== Chávez vs. Taylor ====
On March 17, 1990, he faced Meldrick Taylor, the undefeated IBF Light Welterweight Champion, in a title unification fight. While Taylor carried the fight to Chavez through round 8, Julio rallied in the last four rounds. With about 30 seconds left in the 12th round, he landed a hard straight right hand on the chin of Taylor, which hurt him badly. Shortly thereafter, he knocked down the former Olympic gold medalist. Although Taylor rose at the referee&#x27;s count of six, he failed to respond coherently to referee Richard Steele&#x27;s questions after being issued a mandatory 8 count, and continued to hold onto the ropes in the corner, resulting in Steele stopping the fight with only two seconds remaining. Many boxing fans and members of the media were outraged that Steele would stop a match that Taylor was winning with only two seconds left, while others felt that Steele was justified in stopping the fight given Taylor&#x27;s condition and the fact that he was unable to respond to Steele before the conclusion of the match. Steele defended his decision by saying that his concern is protecting a fighter, regardless of how much time is left in the round or the fight. As Steele put it, &quot;I stopped it because Meldrick had took a lot of good shots, a lot of hard shots, and it was time for it to stop. You know, I&#x27;m not the timekeeper, and I don&#x27;t care about the time. When I see a man that has had enough, I&#x27;m stopping the fight.&quot; &quot;The Ring&quot; named it the &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; for 1990 and later the &quot;Fight of the Decade&quot; for the 1990s. While many hoped for an immediate rematch, Taylor opted to move up in weight in his next bout and the fighters did not meet again until 1994, when Chávez dominated and knocked out a faded Taylor in eight rounds.

After unifying the titles, Chávez engaged in a busy series of title defenses and non-title fights. On December 8, 1990, he defeated the WBC mandatory challenger Kyung-Duk Ahn (29–1) by third-round knockout. On March 18, 1991, he defeated WBC number five ranked fighter John Duplessis (34–1) by fourth-round TKO. On September 14, 1991, Chávez won a twelve-round unanimous decision over former champion Lonnie Smith. On April 10, 1992, he scored a TKO victory over number-one ranked contender Angel Hernandez (37–0–2, 22 KOs) in the fifth round. Later that year, he defeated Frankie Mitchell (29–1) by fourth-round TKO.

====Chávez vs. Camacho====

On September 12, 1992, Chávez faced WBO light welterweight champion Héctor Camacho (41–1, 18 KOs) in a highly anticipated bout. Chávez dominated Camacho en route to a unanimous decision win. The final scores were 117–111, 119–110 and 120–107 for Chávez. After the fight, on his arrival to Mexico, the President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sent the special car reserved for the Pope to take him from the airport to the President&#x27;s house.

====Chávez vs. Haugen====

His 1993 fight with Greg Haugen featured trash talk from Haugen, who derided Chavez&#x27;s 82-fight unbeaten streak as consisting mostly of &quot;Tijuana taxi drivers that my mother could have knocked out&quot; and insisting that &quot;There aren&#x27;t 130,000 Mexicans who can afford tickets&quot; to see the fight in Estadio Azteca. Chávez responded by saying, &quot;I really hate him bad. When he looks at me, I want to vomit. I am going to give him the worst beating of his life; I am going to make him swallow the words that came out of his dirty mouth.&quot; Ultimately, 136,274 showed up to set a world record for outdoor fight attendance as they watched Chávez drop Haugen quickly and then back off with the apparent intention of punishing him for his prefight remarks. However, the referee had seen enough by the fifth round and stopped it for a TKO victory for Chávez. After the fight, Chávez commented to Haugen, &quot;Now you know I don&#x27;t fight with taxi drivers,&quot; and a bloodied Haugen responded, &quot;They must have been tough taxi drivers.&quot; Later that year, Chávez scored a sixth-round TKO victory over number one ranked contender Terrence Alli.

===Draw with Whitaker and first career loss===

After a division-record 18 consecutive defenses of his light welterweight title, Chávez (87–0) moved up one more weight division to challenge Pernell Whitaker (32–1) for his WBC Welterweight title in September 1993. Since the late 1980s, Chávez stated several times that he wanted a fight against Whitaker. The Whitaker team, among them Lou Duva, told &quot;The Ring&quot; that they did not want a fight against Chavez in those days. The result of the fight was a controversial majority draw, allowing Chávez to remain undefeated with Whitaker retaining his title. Various members of the American media, including &quot;The Ring&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, were critical of the decision. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; put Pernell Whitaker on the cover of its next magazine with a one word title, &quot;Robbed!&quot; Chávez stated after the fight: &quot;I felt I was forcing the fight ... he just kept holding me too much, he was throwing too many low blows too.&quot; There was no rematch.

Chavez continued defending his Light Welterweight title and on December 18, 1993, he defeated British Commonwealth Light Welterweight Champion Andy Holligan (21–0) by fifth-round TKO. Chávez faced Frankie Randall on January 29, 1994, in a fight that most expected him to win easily. Instead, Randall knocked him down for the first time in his career and went on to win a split decision and Chávez lost the title to Randall. Chávez blamed his loss on referee Richard Steele, who deducted two points from Chávez for low blows, which affected the difference on the scorecards. The WBC ordered an immediate rematch and Chávez regained the title on a split technical decision in May 1994. The fight was fiercely contested when they collided heads, opening a large cut over Chávez&#x27;s eyebrow in the seventh round. After the head cut, during round eight, the referee called for the doctor, who then stopped the fight. Under WBC rules, Randall lost one point, giving Chávez the technical victory. The two faced one another in a rubber match 10 years later, which Chávez won.

Chavez then faced Meldrick Taylor in a rematch, four years after their historic first fight. Chavez defeated him in the eighth round by a knockout that sent Taylor from one side of the ring to the other. In his next bout, Chavez defeated three-time champion Tony Lopez. In 1995, he defeated former and future Light Welterweight Champion Giovanni Parisi. Later that year, he defended his title against number one ranked challenger David Kamau, despite suffering a cut in the opening round. Prior to the bout, Chavez indicated that he was considering retirement: &quot;I&#x27;ve had a lot of problems with my arms, with my knees. I really don&#x27;t want to extend myself much longer&quot;, Chávez said. &quot;After so many years of working out, it all builds up. I am not giving what I used to be able to give. I will fight De La Hoya for a lot of money, and then retire.&quot;

====Chávez vs. De La Hoya====

On June 7, 1996, Chávez faced Oscar De La Hoya. A large gash appeared over the left eye of Chávez within the first minute of the first round, leading many to assume what Chávez later confirmed—that the cut occurred earlier in training and was re-opened in the bout. Heavy blood flow prompted the doctor to stop the fight in the fourth round. Until their eventual rematch in 1998, Chávez would always state that De La Hoya had not defeated him, but that a gash that he had suffered in training was the real cause of the stoppage of the fight. In his next bout, Chávez defeated former champion Joey Gamache in his 100th career bout.

====Chávez vs. González====
An elbow injury to Chávez forced postponement of his fight with González. The fight was scheduled for Oct 25th 1997.

A year after De La Hoya moved up to welterweight in 1997, Chávez fought Miguel Ángel González for the vacant WBC Light Welterweight title. That fight ended in a draw. In a rematch with De La Hoya for the WBC Welterweight belt in September 1998, De La Hoya won by 8th-round TKO. About De La Hoya, Chávez stated years after, &quot;I have nothing against him, even though he beat me twice. I have no resentment towards him... De La Hoya was younger than me during our fight, and I was on my way out of boxing. If Oscar didn&#x27;t fight me, he would not have been anything in boxing.&quot; Chavez spoke about his sparring session with De La Hoya six years before their first fight and stated: &quot;I sparred with him and dropped him in the second round with a right hand. De la Hoya was a kid... that day after training he stayed and we went out to dinner, I gave him some $300-$400 from my pocket to help him out.&quot;

===Retirement and farewell fights===
Chavez won his first two bouts in 1999 before losing to then 32-year-old Willy Wise via 10-round unanimous decision. In 2000, at the age of 38, Chávez challenged Light Welterweight Champion Kostya Tszyu. Chavez lost the bout via 6th-round TKO. After a 2001 victory over Terry Thomas in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, Chávez retired. However, on November 24, 2003, he came out of retirement to avenge his earlier loss to Willy Wise, knocking Wise out in two rounds in Tijuana, Mexico. In April 2004, Chávez went back into the ring, for what he again claimed would be his last appearance. In that fight, nicknamed &quot;Adiós, México, Gracias&quot; (&quot;Good-bye, Mexico, Thank you&quot;), he beat his former conqueror, Frankie Randall, by a ten-round decision. On May 28, 2005, Chávez once again stepped into a boxing ring, outpointing Ivan Robinson in ten rounds at the Staples Center (this fight was televised by Showtime Championship Boxing). On September 17, 2005, at the U.S. Airways Center in Phoenix, Arizona, Chávez suffered a TKO loss to until then little-known Grover Wiley in the 115th bout of his career, retiring in his corner before the start of the 5th round, after injuring his right hand. After the bout, Chávez told his promoter, Bob Arum, that this time he was definitely retiring from boxing. His defeat was avenged two years later by his son, Julio César Chávez, Jr., who knocked Wiley out in the third round of their fight.

==Exhibition bouts==
Chávez has fought multiple exhibition bouts for charitable causes.

On January 1, 1985, Chavez scored a third-round technical knockout over Manny Hernandez in an exhibition bout staged in Mexico City, Mexico to garner money for the victims of a 1984 gas explosion in Mexico. 
Late in 2014, Julio César Chávez returned to the ring for an exhibition with Vicente Sagrestano in a bout aimed at collecting toys for poor children.

He and former rival Mario Martinez, against whom he earned his first world championship in 1984, faced each other again on July 3, 2015, in an event to benefit Chavez&#x27;s two drug rehabilitation clinics.

==Personal life==
During the late part of his career, Chávez struggled with drug addiction and alcohol abuse. He stated that he started drinking the night after his fight against Edwin Rosario. He later developed a cocaine habit. Chávez got into rehab several times until he recovered.

Chávez is the father of Omar Chávez and former WBC Middleweight Champion Julio César Chávez, Jr. He works as an analyst for ESPN and TV Azteca, and spends his time between Mexico and the United States, where he owns businesses and properties. He also has a daughter, Nicole Chavez, who is a participant on the Telemundo television reality show, La Casa de los Famosos.

Chávez&#x27;s brother, Rafael Chávez González, was murdered on Sunday, June 25, 2017, during a robbery at one of Rafael&#x27;s businesses.

==Career in review==
Chávez won six world titles in three weight divisions: WBC Super Featherweight (1984), WBA Lightweight (1987), WBC Lightweight (1988), WBC Light Welterweight (1989), IBF Light Welterweight (1990) and WBC Light Welterweight (1994) for the second time. He was also awarded &quot;The Ring&quot; Lightweight Championship in 1988. World champions whom Chávez defeated include Jose Luis Ramírez, Rafael Limón, Rocky Lockridge, Meldrick Taylor, Roger Mayweather, Lonnie Smith, Sammy Fuentes, Héctor &quot;Macho&quot; Camacho, Juan Laporte, Edwin Rosario, Greg Haugen, Tony López, Giovanni Parisi, Joey Gamache and Frankie Randall, who had taken the WBC Light Welterweight belt from Chávez just four months earlier. He also lost to three champions: Frankie Randall, Oscar De La Hoya and Kostya Tszyu. He was held to a draw by two others: Pernell Whitaker and Miguel Ángel González.

Chávez retired in his 25th year as a professional boxer with a record of 107 wins, 6 losses and 2 draws, with 86 knockouts and is considered one of the greatest fighters of all time. He holds records for most successful consecutive defenses of world titles (27), most title fights (37), most title-fight victories (31) and he is after Joe Louis (with 23) for most title defenses won by knockout (21). His record was 89-0-1 going into his first loss to Frankie Randall and had an 87 fight win streak until his draw with Whitaker. He was ranked No. 50 on &quot;Ring&quot; Magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;100 greatest punchers of all time&quot;. As an in-fighter or &quot;swarmer,&quot; Julio César Chávez was renowned specially for his devastating left hook and his extremely strong chin. Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, stated that Chávez was one of the greatest fighters of his generation and top five of all time from his point of view. Trainer Angelo Dundee said that Chávez had one of the strongest chins in boxing history. In 2002, &quot;The Ring&quot; ranked Chávez as the 18th greatest fighter of the last 80 years. On December 7, 2010, his induction to the International Boxing Hall of Fame was announced.

<text>Ranger 3 was a space exploration mission conducted by NASA to study the Moon. The Ranger 3 robotic spacecraft was launched January 26, 1962 as part of the Ranger program. Due to a series of malfunctions, the spacecraft missed the Moon by and entered a heliocentric orbit.

The Ranger 3 space probe was designed to transmit pictures of the lunar surface during a period of 10 minutes of flight prior to impacting on the Moon, to rough-land a seismometer capsule on the Moon, to collect gamma-ray data in flight, to study radar reflectivity of the lunar surface, and to continue testing of the Ranger program for development of lunar and interplanetary spacecraft.

== Spacecraft design ==

Ranger 3 was the first of the Block II Ranger designs. The basic vehicle was 3.1 m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact-limiter, 635 mm in diameter (25 inches), a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a retrorocket with a thrust of 5080 pounds force (22.6 kN), and a gold- and chrome-plated hexagonal base 1.5 m in diameter. A large high-gain dish antenna was attached to the base. Two wing-like solar panels (5.2 m across) were attached to the base and deployed early in the flight. Power was generated by 8680 solar cells contained in the solar panels which charged an 11.5 kg 1 kW·h capacity AgZn launching and backup battery. Spacecraft control was provided by a solid-state computer and sequencer and an earth-controlled command system. Attitude control was provided by Sun and Earth sensors, gyroscopes, and pitch and roll jets. The telemetry system aboard the spacecraft consisted of two 960 MHz transmitters, one at 3 W power output and the other at 50 mW power output, the high-gain antenna, and an omnidirectional antenna. White paint, gold and chrome plating, and a silvered plastic sheet encasing the retrorocket furnished thermal control.

During prelaunch preparations for Ranger 1, the spacecraft&#x27;s timer had accidentally been started which led to the deployment of the solar panels inside the payload shroud. It was decided that ground testing of the onboard instruments would not be done on the Block II spacecraft because they had a functional midcourse correction engine and if a similar incident happened with them, the squibs and pyrotechnics used to deploy the solar panels could inadvertently ignite the propellants in the onboard engine, which could result in the explosion of the spacecraft on the pad and possibly take the entire launch vehicle with it. JPL officials announced that factory testing of the Ranger&#x27;s systems was sufficient to root out any problems and any hardware which failed to pass the tests was not fit to fly.

The experimental apparatus included: (1) a vidicon television camera, which employed a scan mechanism that yielded one complete frame in 10 s; (2) a gamma-ray spectrometer mounted on a 1.8 m boom; (3) a radar altimeter; and (4) a seismometer to be rough-landed on the lunar surface. The seismometer (code-named &quot;Tonto&quot;) was encased in the lunar capsule along with an amplifier, a 50 mW transmitter, voltage control, a turnstile antenna, and six silver-cadmium batteries capable of operating the lunar capsule transmitter for 30 days, all designed to land on the Moon at 130 to 160 km/h (80 to 100 mph). The radar altimeter would be used for reflectivity studies, but was also designed to initiate capsule separation and ignite the retrorocket.

== Mission ==

This was the first American attempt to achieve impact on the lunar surface. The Block II Ranger spacecraft carried a TV camera that used an optical telescope that would allow imaging down to about 24 kilometers above the lunar surface during the descent. The main bus also carried a 42.6 kilogram instrument capsule that would separate from the bus at 21.4 kilometers altitude and then independently impact on the Moon. Protected by a balsa-wood outer casing, the capsule was designed to bounce several times on the lunar surface before coming to rest. The primary onboard instrument was a seismometer.

The mission was designed to boost towards the Moon by an Atlas/Agena, undergo one mid-course correction, and impact the lunar surface. At the appropriate altitude, the capsule was to separate and the retrorockets ignite to cushion the landing. A malfunction in the booster guidance system resulted in excessive spacecraft speed.

Reversed command signals caused the spacecraft to pitch in the wrong direction and the TM antenna to lose earth acquisition, and mid-course correction was not possible. Finally, a spurious signal during the terminal maneuver prevented transmission of useful images. Ranger 3 missed the Moon by approximately 36,800 km on January 28 and was now in a heliocentric orbit. Some useful engineering data were obtained from the flight.

===Preparation for launch===
Preparation for Ranger 3 was complicated by developmental issues with the Agena B stage, which had failed to operate correctly on Rangers 1-2. Agena was primarily the domain of the U.S. Air Force, who intended to use it for military payloads, and NASA had originally assumed it would begin flying in late 1960 or early 1961 by which time any developmental issues with the stage could be weeded out. However, Agena B ended up taking longer to put into service than originally anticipated and its performance also turned out to be somewhat less than expected, which forced some of the planned experiments on the Block II Rangers to be cancelled.

While the Thor-Agena B had begun flying in October 1960, the Atlas-Agena B did not make its maiden voyage until July 1961, meaning that Ranger 1 was only the second time this launch vehicle combination had been flown. This delay was explained by the fact that Air Force programs such as MIDAS were taking much longer to develop than Ranger. In addition, as 1961 ended, Agena Bs had malfunctioned no less than seven times (the two Ranger launches and five Thor-Agena launches).

Major General Osmond J. Ritland, Commander of the Air Force Space Systems Division in Inglewood, California, promised NASA that all problems with Agena would be corrected and, because they also affected DoD programs, the issue was being taken &quot;quite seriously&quot;. Among other changes made would be a thorough review of all Lockheed field operating equipment and procedures. In addition, an effort would be made to ensure that checkout procedures on U.S. Air Force and NASA Agenas were identical and any differences in them eliminated.

In mid-December 1961, Atlas 121D and Agena 6003 arrived at Cape Canaveral and were erected on LC-12. On January 18, 1962, Ranger 3 was stacked atop the booster, but the following day attempted fueling of the Atlas went awry when a tear was found in the intermediate bulkhead separating the LOX and RP-1 tanks. This would mean that the launch vehicle would have to be taken down from the pad for repairs, delaying the launch an entire month. However, Air Force and Convair officials instead suggested the novel solution of doing the repairs right there on LC-12. The Atlas&#x27;s sustainer engine was removed and lowered into the flame deflector pit and wooden scaffolding installed so that technicians could go up into the RP-1 tank, remove the damaged intermediate bulkhead, and replace it. By January 26, repairs were completed.

===Equipment malfunctions and trajectory errors===

Liftoff took place at 3:30 PM EST on January 26, an hour and 15 minutes before the launch window closed, after which Ranger 3 could not have been launched for another month.

At T+49 seconds into launch, the pulse beacon on the Atlas guidance system ceased operating, which prevented the transmission of any steering or cutoff directions for the remainder of the launch. Backup commands from the missile programmer were used to perform booster jettison and Agena separation, but without the guidance program, it was impossible to perform the necessary fine-tuning maneuvers to put the Atlas on the correct flight path. Second engine cut-off occurred due to fuel running out, rather than a programmed cut-off command, causing the Agena and probe to be accelerated higher and faster than planned.

Even worse, equipment at a Florida tracking station malfunctioned and picked up Ranger 3&#x27;s orbital parameters 5 minutes late. Meanwhile, the Agena restarted and sent the probe out of Earth orbit, but another error in its guidance program resulted in yet another trajectory error. As a consequence, the spacecraft reached the Moon 14 hours early and on January 28 missed striking the Moon by 36,793 kilometers (22,862 miles).

The trajectory errors made impact with the Moon impossible, but Ranger 3 could still have been used for deep-space studies. So the flight controllers issued commands to unfurl the camera boom, and on January 28 an amended computer program was uploaded. However, midway through the upload, the probe&#x27;s signal strength began to weaken and the onboard computer system failed completely. Without a functioning computer, the spacecraft was not able keep its high-gain antenna aimed at the Earth, which impeded communication with controllers on the ground.

===Mission failure, propellant exhaustion, and cancellation===
The TV camera did transmit images, but since the antenna was now pointed away from Earth, the received images were extremely weak and noisy. It was possible to see the reference crosses on the camera lens, illuminated by reflected sunlight from the probe&#x27;s chassis, but the Moon was not visible.

With the computer dead, Ranger 3 became completely unresponsive to any ground commands and the Earth and Sun sensors were rendered useless. The gyroscopes continued to maneuver the probe and ground controllers momentarily reacquired a lock on the antenna, but without stable attitude control, they could not hold it steady. As they were unaware of the computer failure, they continued sending commands to Ranger 3 in vain. Sporadic tracking of the probe continued until January 31 when the attitude control thrusters exhausted their propellant supply, at which point the mission was officially terminated.

<text>Ranger 4 was a spacecraft of the Ranger program, launched in 1962. It was designed to transmit pictures of the lunar surface to Earth stations during a period of 10 minutes of flight prior to crashing upon the Moon, to rough-land a seismometer capsule on the Moon, to collect gamma-ray data in flight, to study radar reflectivity of the lunar surface, and to continue testing of the Ranger program for development of lunar and interplanetary spacecraft.

An onboard computer failure caused failure of the deployment of the solar panels and navigation systems; as a result the spacecraft crashed on the far side of the Moon without returning any scientific data. It was the first spacecraft of the United States to reach another celestial body and the first of any nation to reach the surface of the far side of the Moon.

==Spacecraft design==
Ranger 4 was a Block II Ranger spacecraft virtually identical to Ranger 3. The basic vehicle was , high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsawood impact-limiter, in diameter, a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a thrust retrorocket, and a gold- and chrome-plated hexagonal base in diameter. A large high-gain dish antenna was attached to the base. Two wing-like solar panels ( across) were attached to the base and deployed early in the flight.

Power was generated by 8,680 solar cells contained in the solar panels which charged an 1 kWh capacity AgZn launching and backup battery. Spacecraft control was provided by a solid-state computer and sequencer and an Earth-controlled command system. Attitude control was provided by Sun and Earth sensors, gyroscopes, and pitch and roll jets. The telemetry system aboard the spacecraft, consisting of two 960 MHz transmitters, one at 3 W power output and the other at 50 mW power output, the high-gain antenna, and an omnidirectional antenna. White paint, gold and chrome plating, and a silvered plastic sheet encasing the retrorocket furnished thermal control.

Because heat sterilization was suspected to have caused the malfunction of Ranger 3&#x27;s computer, this procedure was dropped on Ranger 4. The seismometer capsule was also painted with a sawtooth pattern for better thermal protection.

The experimental apparatus included: (1) a vidicon television camera, which employed a scan mechanism that yielded one complete frame in ten seconds; 2) a gamma-ray spectrometer mounted on a boom; (3) a radar altimeter; and (4) a seismometer to be rough-landed on the lunar surface. The seismometer was encased in the lunar capsule along with an amplifier, a 50-milliwatt transmitter, voltage control, a turnstile antenna, and six silver-cadmium batteries capable of operating the lunar capsule transmitter for 30 days, all designed to land on the Moon at . The radar altimeter would be used for reflectivity studies, but was also designed to initiate capsule separation and ignite the retro-rocket.

==Mission==
Atlas 133D and Agena 6004 arrived at Cape Canaveral in March and began preflight checkouts. Unlike with previous Ranger launches, no serious difficulties were encountered in readying the launch vehicle for flight and the probe also passed all systems tests with ease. On April 20, Ranger 4 was stacked atop the booster and liftoff took place at 3:50 pm EST on April 23. Launch proceeded perfectly this time and there were no anomalies with either the Atlas or the Agena, which performed its second burn to send Ranger 4 on a translunar trajectory.

After separation from the Agena, it was apparent that something was seriously amiss when tracking stations picked up Ranger 4&#x27;s radio transmitter, but there was no telemetry data being returned or any response when commands were sent to the computer. Without telemetry, it could not be confirmed that the probe&#x27;s solar panels had unfolded, but the fluctuating radio transponder indicated that Ranger 4 was tumbling and that the solar panels and high-gain antenna were not deployed either.

The Atlas and Agena had both performed perfectly, in fact so well that Ranger 4 would not even need a midcourse correction burn to impact the Moon. However, this was all futile if the spacecraft was inoperative. Ground controllers sent commands to the probe to unfurl the solar panels and high-gain antenna and manually use the attitude control system to stop the rolling motion it was in, but the probe was unresponsive. The Spacecraft Data Analysis Team at JPL concluded that the main timer in Ranger 4&#x27;s computer had stopped, which disabled the telemetry system, preprogrammed events such as solar panel deployment, and also made the probe completely unresponsive to manual commands. Even though lunar impact would occur as planned, the mission was for all intents and purposes a failure. Making it a more bitter pill to swallow was the nearly-flawless launch vehicle performance. The booster problems that affected Rangers 1-3 had been resolved, only for the probe itself to completely fail, as unlike the previous missions, Ranger 4 did not return any useful data. Finding the cause of the timer malfunction could also be difficult since it had occurred during the coasting phase prior to trans-lunar injection when Ranger 4 was passing between tracking stations in the Caribbean and South Africa.

Without solar power, Ranger 4&#x27;s batteries ran down on the morning of April 26 and the radio transponder ceased operating. The tiny transmitter in the seismometer capsule continued sending out a 50-milliwatt signal. According to the NASA, Ranger 4 impacted the far side of the Moon (229.3 degrees E, 15.5 degrees S) at at 12:49:53 UT on April 26, 1962, after 64 hours of flight. However, the coordinates were ″guesstimated&quot; and the crater of the impact could not be identified by high-resolution images of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

NASA officials tried to put a positive spin on the mission, noting that it was the first time an American spacecraft had reached the surface of the Moon and that the probe was &quot;far more sophisticated&quot; than the Soviet Luna 2 space probe in 1959, which had been little more than a pressurized sphere designed to deposit pennants on the surface at impact. The excellent performance of the Atlas-Agena booster had also raised morale.

This spacecraft, similar in design to Ranger 3, was the first American spacecraft to reach another celestial body. It was also the first spacecraft to impact the far side of the Moon. Although the spacecraft did not achieve its primary objective, the Atlas-Agena-Ranger combination performed without fault for the first time.

<text>Venera 2MV-1 No.1, also known as Sputnik 19 in the West, was a Soviet spacecraft, which was launched in 1962 as part of the Venera programme.

Due to a problem with its upper stage it failed to leave low Earth orbit, and reentered the atmosphere a few days later. It was the first of two Venera 2MV-1 spacecraft, both of which failed to leave Earth orbit.

== Launch ==

Venera 2MV-1 No.1 was launched at 02:18:45 UTC on 25 August 1962, atop a Molniya 8K78 carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The first three stages of the rocket operated nominally, injecting the fourth stage and payload into a low Earth orbit. The fourth stage then coasted until one hour and fifty seconds after launch, when it fired its ullage motors in preparation for ignition. One of the ullage motors failed to fire, and when the main engine ignited for a four-minute burn to place the spacecraft into heliocentric orbit, the stage began to tumble out of control. Forty-five seconds later, its engine cut off, leaving the spacecraft stranded in Earth orbit. It reentered the atmosphere on 28 August 1962, three days after it had been launched.

== Spacecraft designation ==

The designations Sputnik 23, and later Sputnik 19 was used by the United States Naval Space Command to identify the spacecraft in its Satellite Situation Summary documents, since the Soviet Union did not release the internal designations of its spacecraft at that time, and had not assigned it an official name due to its failure to depart geocentric orbit.

Due to a problem with its upper stage it failed to leave low Earth orbit, and reentered the atmosphere a few days later. It was the second of two Venera 2MV-1 spacecraft, both of which failed to leave Earth orbit. The previous mission, Venera 2MV-1 No.1, was launched several days earlier.

== Launch ==

Venera 2MV-1 No.2 was launched at 02:12:30 UTC on 1 September 1962, atop a Molniya 8K78 carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The lower stages of the rocket operated nominally, injecting the fourth stage and payload into a low Earth orbit. Following a coast phase, the upper stage was to have ignited around sixty-one minutes and thirty seconds after launch, in order to place the spacecraft into heliocentric orbit. The ignition command did not reach the engine, however, and the fuel valves did not open, so the upper stage failed to ignite leaving the payload in geocentric orbit. It reentered the atmosphere on 6 September 1962, five days after it had been launched.

== Satellite designation ==

The designations Sputnik 24, and later Sputnik 20, were used by the United States Naval Space Command to identify the spacecraft in its Satellite Situation Summary documents, since the Soviet Union did not release the internal designations of its spacecraft at that time, and had not assigned it an official name due to its failure to depart Earth orbit.

<text>Mars 2MV-4 No.1 also known as Sputnik 22 in the West, was a Soviet spacecraft, which was launched in 1962 as part of the Mars programme, and was intended to make a flyby of Mars, and transmit images of the planet back to Earth. Due to a problem with the rocket which launched it, it was destroyed in low Earth orbit. It was the first of two Mars 2MV-4 spacecraft to be launched, the other being the Mars 1 spacecraft which was launched eight days later.

== Launch ==
With the Cuban Missile Crisis unfolding, the USSR spacecraft &quot;Mars 2MV-4 No.1&quot; was launched at 17:55:04 UTC on 24 October 1962, atop a Molniya 8K78 carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The lower stages of the rocket performed nominally, placing the payload and the Blok L upper stage into low Earth orbit. When the Blok L ignited following a coast phase, lubricant leaked out of the turbopump, which consequently seized up and disintegrated. This caused the main engine to explode, destroying the upper stage and spacecraft. Twenty two pieces of debris from the spacecraft and upper stage were catalogued, which decayed between 29 October 1962 and 26 February 1963.

== Designations ==
The designations Sputnik 29, and later Sputnik 22, were used by the United States Naval Space Command to identify the spacecraft in its Satellite Situation Summary documents, since the Soviet Union did not release the internal designations of its spacecraft at that time, and had not assigned it an official name due to its failure to depart geocentric orbit. A United States Ballistic Missile Early Warning System station in Alaska detected the debris from the launch, and initially identified it as incoming nuclear warheads, since the launch had occurred during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

<doc id="82413" wikidata="Q7833" url="?curid=82413" title="Boris Vian">
<text>Boris Vian (; 10 March 1920 – 23 June 1959) was a French polymath who is primarily remembered for his novels. Those published under the pseudonym Vernon Sullivan were bizarre parodies of criminal fiction, highly controversial at the time of their release owing to their unconventional outlook.

Vian&#x27;s other fiction, published under his real name, featured a highly individual writing style with numerous made-up words, subtle wordplay and surrealistic plots. His novel &quot;Froth on the Daydream&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Écume des jours&quot;) is the best known of these works and one of the few translated into English.

Vian was an important influence on the French jazz scene. He served as liaison for Hoagy Carmichael, Duke Ellington and Miles Davis in Paris, wrote for several French jazz-reviews (&quot;Le Jazz Hot&quot;, &quot;Paris Jazz&quot;) and published numerous articles dealing with jazz both in the United States and in France. His own music and songs enjoyed popularity during his lifetime, particularly the anti-war song &quot;Le Déserteur&quot; (The Deserter).

==Biography==

===Early life===
Vian was born in 1920 into an upper middle-class family in the wealthy Parisian suburb of Ville d&#x27;Avray. His parents were Paul Vian, a young , and Yvonne Ravenez, amateur pianist and harpist. From his father, Vian inherited a distrust of the church and the military, as well as a love of the bohemian life. Vian was the second of four children: the others were Lélio (1918–1984), Alain (1921–1995) and Ninon (1924–2003). The family occupied the &quot;Les Fauvettes&quot; villa. The name &quot;Boris&quot; was chosen by Yvonne, an avid classical music lover, after seeing a performance of Mussorgsky&#x27;s opera &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;.

Boris&#x27; later childhood was also marked with sickness as he suffered from Rheumatic fever when he was 12. From then on Boris&#x27; parents became overprotective toward him, and he would later judge them harshly for this in &quot;L&#x27;Herbe rouge&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Arrache-coeur&quot;.

===Formal education and teenage years===
From 1932 to 1937, Vian studied at Lycée Hoche in Versailles. In 1936, Vian and his two brothers began to organize what they called &quot;surprise-parties&quot; (surprise parties). They partook of mescaline in the form of a Mexican cactus called peyote. These gatherings became the basis of his early novels: &quot;Trouble dans les andains&quot; (Turmoil in the Swaths) (1943) and particularly &quot;Vercoquin et le plancton&quot; (Vercoquin and the Plankton) (1943–44). It was also in 1936 that Vian became interested in jazz; the next year he started playing the trumpet and joined the Hot Club de France.

In 1937, Vian graduated from Lycée Hoche, passing baccalauréats in mathematics, philosophy, Latin, Greek and German. He subsequently enrolled at Lycée Condorcet, Paris, where he studied special mathematics until 1939. Vian became fully immersed in the French jazz scene: for example, in 1939 he helped organize Duke Ellington&#x27;s second concert in France. When WWII started, Vian was not accepted into the army due to poor health. He entered École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures in Paris and subsequently moved to Angoulême when the school moved there because of the war.

In 1940, Vian met Michelle Léglise, who became his wife in 1941. She taught Vian English and introduced him to translations of American literature. Also in 1940, Vian met Jacques Loustalot, who became a recurring character in several early novels and short stories as &quot;The Colonel&quot;. Loustalot died accidentally in 1949 falling from a building he was trying to climb on in order to enter into a flat by the window, after a bet. In 1942, Vian and his brothers joined a jazz orchestra under the direction of Claude Abbadie, who became a minor character in Vian&#x27;s &quot;Vercoquin et le plancton&quot;. The same year, Vian graduated from École Centrale with a diploma in metallurgy, and his son Patrick was born.

===Career===
After Vian&#x27;s graduation, he and Michelle moved to the 10th arrondissement of Paris and, on 24 August 1942 he became an engineer at the French Association for Standardisation (AFNOR). By this time he was an accomplished jazz trumpeter, and in 1943 he wrote his first novel, &quot;Trouble dans les andains&quot; (Turmoil in the Swaths). His literary career started in 1943 with his first publication, a poem, in the Hot Club de France bulletin. The poem was signed Bison Ravi (&quot;Delighted Bison&quot;), an anagram of Vian&#x27;s real name. The same year Vian&#x27;s father died, murdered at home by burglars.

In 1944, Vian completed &quot;Vercoquin et le plancton&quot; (Vercoquin and the Plankton), a novel inspired partly by surprise-parties of his youth and partly by his job at the AFNOR (which is heavily satirized in the novel). Raymond Queneau and Jean Rostand helped Vian to publish this work at Éditions Gallimard in 1947, along with several works Vian completed in 1946. These included his first major novels, &quot;L&#x27;Écume des jours&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;automne à Pékin&quot; (Autumn in Peking). The former, a tragic love story in which real world objects respond to the characters&#x27; emotions, is now regarded as Vian&#x27;s masterpiece, but at the time of its publication it failed to attract any considerable attention. &quot;L&#x27;automne à Pékin&quot;, which also had a love story at its heart but was somewhat more complex, also failed to sell well.

Frustrated by the commercial failure of his works, Vian vowed he could write a best-seller and wrote the hard-boiled novel &quot;I Spit on Your Graves&quot; (&quot;J&#x27;irai cracher sur vos tombes&quot;) in only 15 days. The book was ascribed to a fictitious American writer, Vernon Sullivan, with Vian credited as translator. Vian persuaded his publisher friend Jean d&#x27;Halluin to publish the novel in 1947. Eventually the hoax became known and the book became one of the best-selling titles of that year. Vian wrote three more Vernon Sullivan novels from 1947 to 1949.

The year 1946 marked a turning point in Vian&#x27;s life: At one of the popular parties that he and Michelle hosted he made the acquaintance of Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Albert Camus, became a regular in their literary circles and started regularly publishing various materials in &quot;Les Temps modernes&quot;. Vian admired Sartre in particular and gave him a prominent role—as &quot;Jean-Sol Partre&quot;—in &quot;L&#x27;Écume des jours&quot; (litt. &quot;The foam of the days&quot;) published in English under the title: &quot;Froth on the Daydream&quot;. Ironically, Sartre and Michelle Vian commenced a relationship that would eventually destroy Vian&#x27;s marriage.

Despite his literary work becoming more important, Vian never left the jazz scene. He became a regular contributor to jazz-related magazines, and played trumpet at Le Tabou. As a result, his financial situation improved, and he abandoned the job at the AFNOR. Vian also formed his own choir, &quot;La petite chorale de Saint-Germain-des-Pieds&quot; .

===Later years===
The year 1948 saw the birth of Vian&#x27;s daughter, Carole. He continued his literary career by writing Vernon Sullivan novels, and also published poetry collections: &quot;Barnum&#x27;s Digest&quot; (1948) and &quot;Cantilènes en gelée&quot; (Cantelinas in Jelly, 1949). Vian also started writing plays, the first of which, &quot;L&#x27;Équarrissage pour tous&quot; (Slaughter for Everyone), was staged the year it was written, 1950. The same year saw the publication of Vian&#x27;s third major novel, &quot;L&#x27;Herbe rouge&quot; (The Red Grass). This was a much darker story than its predecessors, centering on a man who built a giant machine that could help him psychoanalyze his soul. Like the previous two books, it did not sell well; Vian&#x27;s financial situation had been steadily worsening since late 1948, and he was forced to take up translation of English-language literature and articles in order to get by. Vian separated from his wife, and in 1950 he met Ursula Kübler (1928–2010), a Swiss dancer; the two started an affair, and in 1951 Vian divorced Michelle. Ursula and Boris married in 1954.

Vian&#x27;s last novel, &quot;L&#x27;Arrache-cœur&quot; (The Heartsnatcher), was published in 1953, yet again to poor sales and Vian effectively stopped writing fiction. The only work that appeared after 1953 was a revised version of &quot;L&#x27;automne à Pékin&quot;, published 1956. He concentrated on a new field, song-writing and performing, and continued writing poetry. Vian&#x27;s songs were successful; in 1954 he embarked on his first tour as singer-songwriter. By 1955, when he was working as art director for Philips, Vian was active in a wide variety of fields: song-writing, opera, screenplays and several more plays. His first album, &quot;Chansons possibles et impossibles&quot; (Possible and Impossible Songs), was also recorded in 1955. He wrote the first French rock and roll songs with his friend Henri Salvador, who sang them under the nickname Henry Cording. He also wrote &quot;Java Pour Petula&quot; (a song about an English girl arriving in France, written in Parisian argot) for Petula Clark&#x27;s first concert performances in France.

Still in 1955, Vian decided to perform some of his songs on stage himself. He had been unhappy about the fact that French singer Marcel Mouloudji (1922–1994), who had interpreted &quot;Le Deserteur&quot; (The Deserter) on stage the year before, had not accepted the original lyrics because he thought that they would lead to the song being banned. Although Vian accepted a change to one verse, the song was banned from TV and radio channels until 1967. The record of Vian&#x27;s songs performed by himself was not successful in France until ten years after his death.

Vian&#x27;s life was endangered in 1956 by a pulmonary edema, but he survived and continued working with the same intensity as before. In 1957, Vian completed another play: &quot;Les Bâtisseurs d&#x27;empire&quot; (The Empire Builders), which was only published and staged in 1959. In 1958, Vian worked on the opera &quot;Fiesta&quot; with Darius Milhaud, and a collection of his essays, &quot;En avant la zizique... Et par ici les gros sous&quot; (On with the Muzak... And Bring in the Big Bucks), was published the same year.

===Death===
On the morning of 23 June 1959, Vian was at the Cinéma Marbeuf for the screening of the film version of &quot;I will Spit on Your Graves&quot;. He had already fought with the producers over their interpretation of his work, and he publicly denounced the film, stating that he wished to have his name removed from the credits. A few minutes after the film began, he reportedly blurted out: &quot;These guys are supposed to be American? My ass!&quot; He then collapsed onto his seat and died of a sudden cardiac arrest on his way to the hospital.

===Legacy===
During his lifetime, only the novels published under the name of Vernon Sullivan were successful. Those published under his real name, which had real literary value in his eyes, remained a commercial failure, despite the support of prominent writers of the time.

Almost immediately after his death, &quot;L&#x27;Écume des jours&quot;, and then &quot;L&#x27;automne à Pékin&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Arrache-cœur&quot;, and &quot;L&#x27;Herbe rouge&quot;, began to gain recognition in France and were taken up by the young in the 1960s and 1970s.

As a songwriter, Vian had mixed success. When he decided that he himself should sing the songs that were rejected by the stars, he succeeded only in reaching a limited audience (including Léo Ferré and Georges Brassens), the public remaining unconvinced of his talent for singing. Nevertheless the May 1968 in France generation, even more than the previous ones, loved his songs, especially because of their impertinence.

As a songwriter, Vian inspired Serge Gainsbourg, who used to attend his show at the cabaret &quot;Les Trois Baudets&quot; and who wrote, thirty years later: &quot;I took it on the chin [...], he sang terrific things [...], it is because I heard him that I decided to try something interesting&quot;.
As a critic, Boris Vian was the first to support Gainsbourg in &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot;, in 1957.

Over the years, Vian&#x27;s works have become modern classics, often celebrated and selected as subjects for study in schools. Vian is still viewed by many as the emblematic figure of Saint Germain des Prés as it existed during the postwar decade, when this district was the centre of artistic and intellectual life in Paris.

<doc id="82416" wikidata="Q767342" url="?curid=82416" title="Ranger 5">
<text>Ranger 5 was a spacecraft of the Ranger program designed to transmit pictures of the lunar surface to Earth stations during a period of 10 minutes of flight prior to impacting on the Moon, to rough-land a seismometer capsule on the Moon, to collect gamma-ray data in flight, to study radar reflectivity of the lunar surface, and to continue testing of the Ranger program for development of lunar and interplanetary spacecraft. Due to an unknown malfunction, the spacecraft ran out of power and ceased operation. It passed within 725 km of the Moon.

==Spacecraft design==

Ranger 5 was a Block II Ranger spacecraft similar to Ranger 3 and Ranger 4. The basic vehicle was 3.1 m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsawood impact-limiter, 65 cm in diameter, a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a retrorocket with a thrust of , and a gold and chrome plated hexagonal base 1.5 m in diameter. A large high-gain dish antenna was attached to the base. Two wing-like solar panels (5.2 m across) were attached to the base and deployed early in the flight. Power was generated by 8680 solar cells contained in the solar panels which charged an 11.5 kg 1 kWh capacity AgZn launching and backup battery. Spacecraft control was provided by a solid-state digital computer and sequencer and an Earth-controlled command system. Attitude control was provided by six Sun and one Earth sensor, gyroscopes, and pitch and roll cold nitrogen gas jets. The telemetry system aboard the spacecraft consisted of two 960 MHz transmitters, one at 3 W power output and the other at 50 mW power output, the high-gain antenna, and an omnidirectional antenna. White paint, gold and chrome plating, and a silvered plastic sheet encasing the retrorocket furnished thermal control.

The experimental apparatus included: (1) a vidicon television camera, which employed a scan mechanism that yielded one complete frame in 10 s; (2) a gamma-ray spectrometer in a 300 mm sphere mounted on a 1.8 m boom; (3) a radar altimeter; and (4) a seismometer to be rough-landed on the lunar surface. The seismometer was encased in the lunar capsule along with an amplifier, a 50 mW transmitter, voltage control, a turnstile antenna, and six silver-cadmium batteries capable of operating the lunar capsule transmitter for 30 days, all designed to land on the Moon at . The instrument package floated in a layer of freon within the balsawood sphere. The radar altimeter would be used for reflectivity studies, but was also designed to initiate capsule separation and ignite the retro-rocket.

== Mission ==

Ranger 5 was scheduled for launch in June 1962, but NASA instead decided to fly the Mariner Venus probes (derived from Block I Ranger) first which gave more time to work out problems with the spacecraft. After Mariner 1 ended its mission in the Atlantic Ocean instead of interplanetary space, the agency started coming under increased scrutiny from Congress due to its apparent inability to have any kind of success with planetary probes. Republican Congressman James Fulton confronted NASA Director of the Office of Programs J.J. Wyatt, noting that Mariner 1 had cost U.S. taxpayers $14 million and that there was no excuse at this point for failures every launch. As July 1962 ended, there had been 12 planetary probe attempts going back to 1958 and only two (Pioneer 4 and Pioneer 5) accomplished all of their mission goals. It might have been small consolation that Soviet planetary probe efforts during this time were little more successful, but all of their failures were kept secret, so the Soviets did not have to answer to their public about the waste of tax money on failed space missions.

The successful launch of Mariner 2 on August 27 momentarily blunted criticism of NASA and Jet Propulsion Laboratory and also seemed to verify the soundness of the Ranger design. Meanwhile, JPL engineers were still trying to figure out what had caused the computer failure on Ranger 4, which had occurred during a period when the probe was out of range of ground tracking. The malfunction was especially puzzling because the probe had been given very thorough ground testing without any anomalies occurring. Examination of telemetry records seemed to suggest that the failure had occurred during separation of Ranger 4 from the Agena, at the point where the electrical interface between the two was disconnected and Ranger 4 would have switched to internal power. The behavior of the probe indicated a transformer or inverter malfunction, probably a short circuit caused by loose metal coatings contacting the pins on the power umbilical attaching the probe to the Agena. Modifications to Ranger 5 included a backup timer to ensure continued operation of the telemetry system if the main computer failed, an additional nitrogen bottle to the attitude control system to reduce gas pressure, and an additional pyrotechnic igniter for the midcourse correction engine. Most importantly, extra diodes and fuses were added to the electrical lines to prevent another short from occurring.

Ranger 5 was heat-sterilized like Rangers 3-4 had been, so as to prevent unintended contamination of the Moon with Earth microbes. Rolf Halstrup, who was in charge of the sterilization program, had vocally objected to this procedure as he was convinced that subjecting the probes to a heat dosage was damaging the sensitive electronics in them. He convinced JPL in Pasadena management that sterilization of Ranger 4 had &quot;very likely&quot; damaged the main computer sequencer and timer and that the procedure needed to be stopped to ensure reliability of the spacecraft. Management agreed to stop sterilizing Ranger probes, but only on Ranger 8 and up, as Rangers 6-7 had already been sterilized.

On August 20, Ranger 5 began the long cross-country trip from state of California to Florida and arrived there the day of Mariner 2&#x27;s launch. Atlas 215D and Agena 6005 arrived later that week and prelaunch checkouts were started. Initial preparations focused on the launch vehicle itself, which was causing almost as many problems as the Ranger probes themselves. The Atlas-Agena combination malfunctioned four out of the six times that NASA had launched it and every booster that was delivered to Cape Canaveral required modifications or repair work before it could fly. Moreover, in the year between Ranger 1 and Mariner 2, there had been no improvement whatsoever in the quality control of the Atlas-Agenas. Since Ranger launches had been delayed before by booster problems, technicians rushed to make sure nothing of the sort would delay Ranger 5&#x27;s mission.

Tracking of Mariner 2 was an ongoing job during this time and since NASA&#x27;s deep space tracking networks could not handle both probes at once, it was decided to switch attention to Ranger 5 for its short mission.

After two launch attempts were aborted, one due to an electrical short in the probe and the other due to weather concerns, the go to fly was given for October 18. Liftoff took place at 12:59 PM EST and the Atlas soon vanished into an overcast gray sky. A malfunction of the guidance system rate beacon at T+93 seconds resulted in noisy track rate data, but, unlike Ranger 3, discrete commands were received and issued by the guidance system properly. The Agena reached orbit successfully and began the burn to place Ranger 5 on a translunar trajectory.

Soon, however, high temperatures were detected in the computer system, and shortly afterwards, power generation from the solar panels ceased. The gamma ray detector was turned on, but the computer did not issue the command to align the spacecraft with Earth. Then the telemetry receivers at the tracking stations in Australia and South Africa malfunctioned, returning garbled data. It was obvious that an electrical short had disabled the solar panels, which meant that Ranger 5 now had only a few hours before it would run out of battery power. JPL technicians thought that they could still partially salvage the mission by firing the midcourse correction engine to ensure impact with the Moon, but they had to do it quickly before power ran out. Ground controllers sent commands to unfurl the high-gain antenna and align the probe for the midcourse burn, but during this time more electrical shorts apparently occurred because there was a momentary dropout from the telemetry transmitter. The midcourse engine was fired, but Ranger 5 exhausted its batteries halfway through the burn. The radio transponder and telemetry signals ceased, followed by uncontrolled tumbling of the probe. Ranger 5 passed 450 miles from the lunar surface en route to a permanent orbit around the Sun. Signals were still received from the tiny seismometer capsule until fading as the probe&#x27;s distance from Earth became too great.
Mission controllers tracked it to a distance of .

This was the third attempt to impact the lunar surface with a Block II Ranger spacecraft. On this mission, just 15 minutes after normal operation, a malfunction led to the transfer of power from solar to battery power. Normal operation never resumed; battery power was depleted after 8 hours, and all spacecraft systems died. The first midcourse correction was never implemented, and Ranger 5 passed the Moon at a range of 724 kilometers on October 21 and entered heliocentric orbit. It was tracked to a distance of 1,271,381 kilometers. Before loss of signal, the spacecraft sent back about 4 hours of data from the gamma-ray experiment.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau (born Friedrich Wilhelm Plumpe; December 28, 1888March 11, 1931) was a German film director, producer, and screenwriter. He is regarded as one of cinema&#x27;s most influential filmmakers for his work in the silent era.

An erudite child with an early interest in film, Murnau eventually studied philology and art before director Max Reinhardt recruited him to his acting school. During World War I, he served in the Imperial German Army, initially as an infantry company commander and communications officer and later with the German Army&#x27;s Flying Corps as an observer/gunner. He survived several crashes without any severe injuries.

Murnau&#x27;s first directorial work premiered in 1919, but he did not attain international recognition until the 1922 film &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, an adaptation of Bram Stoker&#x27;s 1897 novel &quot;Dracula&quot;. Although not a commercial success owing to copyright issues with author Stoker&#x27;s estate, the film is considered a masterpiece of German Expressionist cinema and an early cult film. Murnau later directed the film &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; (1924), as well as a 1926 interpretation of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;. He immigrated to Hollywood in 1926, where he joined the Fox Studio and made three films: &quot;&quot; (1927), &quot;4 Devils&quot; (1928) and &quot;City Girl&quot; (1930). &quot;Sunrise&quot; has been regarded by critics and film directors as among the best films ever made.

Murnau travelled to Bora Bora to make the film &quot;&quot; (1931) with documentary film pioneer Robert J. Flaherty, although disputes with Flaherty led Murnau to finish the film on his own. A week before the successful opening of &quot;Tabu&quot;, Murnau died in a California hospital from injuries sustained in an automobile accident. Of the 21 films Murnau directed, eight are now considered to be completely lost. One reel of his feature &quot;Marizza, genannt die Schmuggler-Madonna&quot; survives. This leaves only 12 films surviving in their entirety.

==Early years==
Friedrich Wilhelm Plumpe was born in Bielefeld. By the age of seven, he was living in Kassel. He had two brothers, Bernhard and Robert, and two stepsisters, Ida and Anna. His mother, Otilie Volbracht, was the second wife of his father, Heinrich Plumpe (1847–1914), an owner of a cloth factory in the northwest part of Germany. Their villa was often turned into a stage for little plays, directed by the young Friedrich, who had already read books by Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, as well as plays by Shakespeare and Ibsen, by the age of 12. Plumpe would take the pseudonym of &quot;Murnau&quot; from the town of that name near Lake Staffel, south of Munich, where he lived for a time. The young Murnau was said to have an icy, imperious disposition and an obsession with film. Some reference sources list him as being almost tall, others however list him with a more modest 193 cm (6 ft 4).

Murnau studied philology at the University in Berlin and later art history and literature in Heidelberg, where director Max Reinhardt saw him at a students&#x27; performance and decided to invite him to his actor-school. He soon became a friend of Franz Marc (the Blue Rider artist based in Murnau), Else Lasker-Schüler and Hans Ehrenbaum-Degele. During World War I, Murnau served as a company commander on the Eastern Front. He then joined the Imperial German Flying Corps and flew missions in northern France as a combat pilot for two years, surviving eight crashes without severe injuries. After landing in Switzerland, he was arrested and interned for the remainder of the war. In his POW camp, he was involved with a prisoner theater group and wrote a film script.

==Career==

After World War I ended, Murnau returned to Germany, where he soon established his own film studio with actor Conrad Veidt. His first feature-length film, &quot;The Boy in Blue&quot; (1919), was a drama inspired by the Thomas Gainsborough painting. He explored the theme of dual personalities, much like Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, in &quot;Der Janus-Kopf&quot; (1920) starring Veidt and featuring Bela Lugosi.

Murnau&#x27;s best known film is &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922), an adaptation of Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; (1897), starring German stage actor Max Schreck as the vampire Count Orlok. The release would be the only one by Prana Film because the company declared itself bankrupt in order to avoid paying damages to Stoker&#x27;s estate (acting for the author&#x27;s widow, Florence Stoker) after the estate won a copyright infringement lawsuit. Apart from awarding damages, the court ordered also all existing prints of the film to be destroyed. However, one copy had already been distributed globally. This print, which has been duplicated time and again by a cult following over the years, has made &quot;Nosferatu&quot; an early example of a cult film.

Murnau also directed &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; (German: &quot;Der letzte Mann&quot;, (The Last Man), 1924), written by Carl Mayer (a very prominent figure of the &quot;Kammerspielfilm&quot; movement) and starring Emil Jannings. The film introduced the subjective point of view camera, where the camera &quot;sees&quot; from the eyes of a character and uses visual style to convey a character&#x27;s psychological state. It also anticipated the cinéma vérité movement in its subject matter. The film also used the &quot;unchained camera technique&quot;, a mix of tracking shots, pans, tilts, and dolly moves. Also, unlike the majority of Murnau&#x27;s other works, &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; is considered a &quot;Kammerspielfilm&quot; with Expressionist elements. Unlike expressionist films, &quot;Kammerspielfilme&quot; are categorized by their chamber play influence, involving a lack of intricate set designs and story lines / themes regarding social injustice towards the working classes.

Murnau&#x27;s last German film was the big budget &quot;Faust&quot; (1926) with Gösta Ekman as the title character, Emil Jannings as Mephisto and Camilla Horn as Gretchen. Murnau&#x27;s film draws on older traditions of the legendary tale of Faust as well as on Goethe&#x27;s classic version. The film is well known for a sequence in which the giant, winged figure of Mephisto hovers over a town sowing the seeds of plague.

&quot;Nosferatu&quot; (music by Hans Erdmann) and &quot;Faust&quot; (music by Werner R. Heymann) are two early films that feature original film scores.

===Hollywood===

Murnau immigrated to Hollywood in 1926, where he joined the Fox Studio and made &quot;&quot; (1927), a movie often cited by scholars as one of the greatest of all time. Released in the Fox Movietone sound-on-film system (music and sound effects only), &quot;Sunrise&quot; was not a financial success, but received several Oscars at the very first Academy Awards ceremony in 1929. In winning the Academy Award for Unique and Artistic Production it shared what is now the Best Picture award with the movie &quot;Wings&quot;. The first Academy Award for Best Actress went to Janet Gaynor for this and two other films that year; afterward, each award was limited to work in a single film. In spite of this, Murnau was financially well off, and purchased a farm in Oregon.

Murnau&#x27;s next two films, the (now lost) &quot;4 Devils&quot; (1928) and &quot;City Girl&quot; (1930), were modified to adapt to the new era of sound film and were not well received. Their poor receptions disillusioned Murnau, and he quit Fox to journey for a while in the South Pacific.

Together with documentary film pioneer Robert J. Flaherty, Murnau traveled to Bora Bora to make the film &quot;&quot; in 1931. Flaherty left after artistic disputes with Murnau, who had to finish the movie himself. The movie was censored in the United States for its images of bare-breasted Polynesian women. The film was originally shot by cinematographer Floyd Crosby as half-talkie, half-silent, before being fully restored as a silent film — Murnau&#x27;s preferred medium.

==Personal life==
Murnau joined the German air force as a radio operator in 1916. In December 1917 he had to make an emergency landing in Switzerland and was interned until the end of the war.

Murnau was gay. His friend and lover, the poet Hans Ehrenbaum-Degele, also served in the war but was killed on the eastern front in 1915. This had a profound effect on Murnau, who drew from the horrors of loss, sacrifice and the violence of war in his film work. It was Ehrenbaum who introduced Murnau to the work of expressionists such as Franz Marc and Else Lasker-Schüler.
In Hollywood, Murnau reportedly became enamored with the young actor David Rollins, whom he invited to his home. In late 1927, Murnau convinced Rollins to pose nude, with the pool and garden of the Wolf&#x27;s Lair castle in Hollywood serving as the backdrop. In a later interview Rollins claimed to have been puzzled and surprised by the request, but felt comfortable enough with his body to oblige.

==Death==

On March 10, 1931, a week prior to the opening of the film &quot;Tabu&quot;, Murnau drove up the Pacific Coast Highway from Los Angeles, California, in a rented Packard touring car. Murnau&#x27;s valet, Eliazar Garcia Stevenson (September 2, 1900 – October 4, 1985), swerved to avoid a truck that unexpectedly veered into the northbound lane. The car overturned after striking an embankment, throwing all occupants out of the vehicle. Murnau suffered a head injury and died the next day at the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.

A service was held for Murnau at the Hollywood Lutheran Church on March 19, 1931. His body was transported to Germany, where he was entombed in Stahnsdorf South-Western Cemetery, near Berlin, on April 13. Among the attendees of his second funeral were Robert J. Flaherty, Emil Jannings, and Fritz Lang, who delivered the eulogy. Greta Garbo had a death mask of Murnau commissioned, which she kept on her desk during her years in Hollywood.

In July 2015, Murnau&#x27;s grave was broken into, the remains disturbed and the skull removed by persons unknown. Wax residue was reportedly found at the site, leading some to speculate that candles had been lit, perhaps with an occult or ceremonial significance. As this disturbance was not an isolated incident, the cemetery managers were considering sealing the grave. The skull has not been recovered since.

==Legacy==
American author Jim Shepard based his 1998 novel &quot;Nosferatu&quot; on Murnau&#x27;s life and films. The book began as a short story from Shepard&#x27;s 1996 collection &quot;Batting Against Castro.&quot;

In 2000, director E. Elias Merhige released &quot;Shadow of the Vampire,&quot; a fictionalization of the making of &quot;Nosferatu.&quot; Murnau is portrayed by John Malkovich. In the film, Murnau is so dedicated to making the film genuine that he actually hires a real vampire (Willem Dafoe) to play Count Orlok.

In the film &quot;Vampires vs. the Bronx,&quot; released in 2020, homage is paid to Murnau by making reference to him in the film via a company named &quot;Murnau Properties,&quot; whose logo was the woodcutting view of Vlad the Impaler. Murnau Properties was the shell company owned by vampires, whose plan was to take over the Bronx via property acquisitions and blood acquisitions.

The short movie &quot;F.W.M. Symphony&quot; (AT 2022) is based on the theft of Murnau&#x27;s head: the skull stolen from the film director&#x27;s Berlin tomb in 2015 becomes the anchor of a narrative which splices fictional and historical identities.

<doc id="82418" wikidata="Q2140719" url="?curid=82418" title="TRIPOS">
<text>TRIPOS (&quot;TRIvial Portable Operating System&quot;) is a computer operating system. Development started in 1976 at the Computer Laboratory of Cambridge University and it was headed by Dr. Martin Richards. The first version appeared in January 1978 and it originally ran on a PDP-11. Later it was ported to the Computer Automation LSI4 and the Data General Nova. Work on a Motorola 68000 version started in 1981 at the University of Bath. MetaComCo acquired the rights to the 68000 version and continued development until TRIPOS was chosen by Commodore in March 1985 to form part of an operating system for their new Amiga computer; it was also used at Cambridge as part of the Cambridge Distributed Computing System.

Students in the Computer Science department at Cambridge affectionately refer to TRIPOS as the &quot;Terribly Reliable, Incredibly Portable Operating System&quot;. The name TRIPOS also refers to the Tripos system of undergraduate courses and examinations, which is unique to Cambridge University.

== Influences on the Amiga computer ==
In July 1985, the Amiga was introduced, incorporating TRIPOS in the AmigaDOS module of AmigaOS. AmigaDOS included a command-line interface and the Amiga File System. The entire AmigaDOS module was originally written in BCPL (an ancestor of the C programming language), the same language used to write TRIPOS. AmigaDOS would later be rewritten in C from AmigaOS 2.x onwards, retaining backwards compatibility with 1.x up until AmigaOS 4 (completely rewritten in C) when AmigaDOS abandoned its BCPL legacy.

== Features ==
TRIPOS provided features such as pre-emptive multi-tasking (using strict-priority scheduling), a hierarchical file system and multiple command line interpreters.

The most important TRIPOS concepts have been the non-memory-management approach (meaning no checks are performed to stop programs from using unallocated memory) and message passing by means of passing pointers instead of copying message contents. Those two concepts together allowed for sending and receiving over 1250 packets per second on a 10 MHz Motorola 68010 CPU.

Most of TRIPOS was implemented in BCPL. The kernel and device drivers were implemented in assembly language.

One notable feature of TRIPOS/BCPL was its cultural use of shared libraries, untypical at the time, resulting in small and therefore fast loading utilities. For example, many of the standard system utilities were well below 0.5 Kbytes in size, compared to a typical minimum of about 20 Kbytes for functionally equivalent code on a modern Unix or Linux.

TRIPOS was ported to a number of machines, including the Data General Nova 2, the Computer Automation LSI4, Motorola 68000 and Intel 8086- based hardware. It was offered as the standard operating system on the Microbox III, a computer based on the Motorola 68010 produced by Micro Concepts, alongside alternatives such as CP/M and OS-9. It included support for the Cambridge Ring local area network. More recently, Martin Richards produced a port of TRIPOS to run under Linux, using Cintcode BCPL virtual machine.

, TRIPOS is still actively maintained by Open G I Ltd. (formerly Misys Financial Systems) in Worcestershire, UK. Many British insurance brokers have a Linux/Intel based TRIPOS system serving networked workstations over a TCP/IP connection—the systems are used to run Open G I&#x27;s BROOMS Application suite. Open G I have added a number of features to support the modern office such as the ability to integrate into many mainstream applications and services such as SQL server, Citrix XENAPP, terminal servers, etc.

<doc id="82420" wikidata="Q2763698" url="?curid=82420" title="Sesame">
<text>Sesame (; &quot;Sesamum indicum&quot;) is a plant in the genus &quot;Sesamum&quot;, also called benne. Numerous wild relatives occur in Africa and a smaller number in India. It is widely naturalized in tropical regions around the world and is cultivated for its edible seeds, which grow in pods. World production in 2018 was , with Sudan, Myanmar, and India as the largest producers.

Sesame seed is one of the oldest oilseed crops known, domesticated well over 3,000 years ago. &quot;Sesamum&quot; has many other species, most being wild and native to sub-Saharan Africa. &quot;S. indicum,&quot; the cultivated type, originated in India. It tolerates drought conditions well, growing where other crops fail. Sesame has one of the highest oil contents of any seed. With a rich, nutty flavor, it is a common ingredient in cuisines around the world. Like other foods, it can trigger allergic reactions in some people and is one of the nine most common allergens outlined by the Food and Drug Administration.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;sesame&quot; is from Latin &quot;sesamum&quot; and Greek σήσαμον: &quot;sēsamon&quot;; which in turn are derived from ancient Semitic languages such as Akkadian &quot;šamaššamu&quot;. From these roots, words with the generalized meaning &quot;oil, liquid fat&quot; were derived.

The word &quot;benne&quot; was first recorded in English in 1769; it comes from the African American creole Gullah &quot;benne&quot;, which in turn derives from Malinke &quot;bĕne&quot;.

== Origins and history ==

Sesame seed is considered to be the oldest oilseed crop known to humanity. The genus has many species, and most are wild and native to sub-Saharan Africa. &quot;Sesamum indicum&quot;, the cultivated type, originated in India.

Archaeological remnants of charred sesame dating to about 3500-3050 BC shows that sesame was domesticated in the Indian subcontinent at least 5500 years ago. The archaeobotanist Dorian Q. Fuller states that trading of sesame between Mesopotamia and the Indian subcontinent occurred by 2000 BC. It is possible that the Indus Valley civilization exported sesame oil to Mesopotamia, where it was known as &quot;ilu&quot; in Sumerian and &quot;ellu&quot; in Akkadian, similar to the Dravidian languages Kannada and Malayalam &quot;eḷḷu&quot;, Tamil &quot;eḷ&quot;.

Sesame was cultivated in ancient Egypt. Egyptians called it &quot;sesemt&quot;, and it is included in the list of medicinal drugs in the scrolls of the 1550 BC &quot;Ebers Papyrus&quot;. Excavations of King Tutankhamen uncovered baskets of sesame among other grave goods, suggesting that sesame was present in Egypt by 1350 BC. Sesame was grown and pressed to extract oil at least 750 BC in the empire of Urartu. Others believe it may have originated in Ethiopia.

Historically, sesame was favored for its ability to grow in areas that do not support the growth of other crops. It is a robust crop that needs little farming support—it grows in drought conditions, in high heat, with residual moisture in soil after monsoons are gone or even when rains fail or when rains are excessive. It can be grown by subsistence farmers at the edge of deserts, earning it the name of survivor crop from the sesame breeder Derald Ray Langham.

== Botany ==

Sesame is a perennial plant growing tall, with opposite leaves long with an entire margin; they are broad lanceolate, to broad, at the base of the plant, narrowing to just broad on the flowering stem. The flowers are tubular, long. The flowers vary in colour, from white to pink or purple.

The fruit is a capsule, normally pubescent. The length of the fruit capsule varies from , its width varies between ; there are four locules. The seeds are either white or black.

Sesame seeds are small. Their sizes vary widely by cultivar. Typically, the seeds are 3 to 4×2×1 mm (0.12 to 0.16×0.08×0.04 in). The seeds are ovate, slightly flattened, and somewhat thinner at the eye of the seed (hilum) than at the opposite end. The mass of 100 seeds sampled from a market in Ibadan, Nigeria is 0.203 g, meaning that one gram of sesame consists of around 493 seeds. 

Sesame was described as the species &quot;Sesamum indicum&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in 1753.

== Agriculture ==

=== Cultivation ===

Sesame varieties have adapted to many soil types. The high-yielding crops do best on fertile, well-drained, soils with a neutral pH. However, these have a low tolerance for soils with high salt and water-logged conditions. Commercial sesame crops require 90 to 120 frost-free days. Warm conditions above favor growth and yields. While sesame crops can grow in poor soils, the best yields come from properly fertilized farms.

Flowering depends on photoperiod and cultivar. The photoperiod also affects the seed&#x27;s oil content: increased photoperiod increases oil content. The oil content of the seed is inversely proportional to its protein content. Sesame is drought-tolerant, in part due to its extensive root system. However, it requires adequate moisture for germination and early growth. While the crop survives drought and the presence of excess water, the yields are significantly lower in either condition. Moisture levels before planting and flowering affect yield the most. Most commercial cultivars of sesame are intolerant of waterlogging. Rainfall late in the season prolongs growth and increases loss to dehiscence, when the seedpod shatters, scattering the seed. Wind can also cause shattering at harvest.

=== Processing ===

Sesame seeds are protected by a capsule that bursts when the seeds are ripe. The time of this bursting, or &quot;dehiscence&quot;, tends to vary, so farmers cut plants by hand and place them together in an upright position to continue ripening until all the capsules have opened. The 1943 discovery of an indehiscent mutant (analogous to nonshattering in cereals) led breeders to try to create a high-yield variety that does not drop its seeds. Despite some progress, dehiscence continues to limit production. Agronomists in Israel are working on modern cultivars of sesame that can be harvested by mechanical means.

Since sesame seed is small and flat, it is hard to dry after harvest because the seeds pack closely together, impeding the flow of air in a drying bin. Therefore, the harvested seeds need to be as dry as possible, and then stored at 6% moisture or less. Moist seed stores can rapidly heat up and become rancid.

=== Production ===

In 2022, world production of sesame seeds was 6.7 million tonnes, led by Sudan, India, and Myanmar, which together accounted for 41% of the total (table).

The white and other lighter-colored sesame seeds are common in Europe, the Americas, West Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. The black and darker-colored sesame seeds are mostly produced in China and Southeast Asia.

In the United States most sesame is raised by farmers under contract to Sesaco, which also supplies proprietary seed.

=== Trade ===

Japan is the world&#x27;s largest sesame importer. Sesame oil, particularly from roasted seed, is an important component of Japanese cooking and traditionally the principal use of the seed. China is the second-largest importer of sesame, mostly oil-grade. China exports lower-priced food-grade sesame seeds, particularly to Southeast Asia. Other major importers are the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Turkey, and France.

Sesame seed is a high-value cash crop. Prices ranged between US$ between 2008 and 2010. Prices depend on perceived quality, based on factors such as the seed&#x27;s appearance, freedom from impurities, oil content of at least 40%, and sorting by size and colour.

== Nutrition ==

=== Composition ===

Dried whole sesame seeds are 5% water, 23% carbohydrates, 50% fat, and 18% protein (table). In a reference amount of , dried sesame seeds supply 570 calories of food energy, and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of several B vitamins and dietary minerals, such as calcium, iron, and magnesium (all 75% or more of the DV, table).

The byproduct that remains after oil extraction from sesame seeds, also called sesame oil meal, is rich in protein (35–50%) and is used as feed for poultry and livestock.

As many seeds do, whole sesame seeds contain a significant amount of phytic acid, which is considered an antinutrient in that it binds to certain nutritional elements consumed at the same time, especially minerals, and prevents their absorption by carrying them along as they pass through the small intestine. Heating and cooking reduce the amount of the acid in the seeds. The seeds contain the lignans sesamolin, sesamin, pinoresinol, and lariciresinol.

=== Health effects ===

A meta-analysis showed that sesame consumption produced small reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure; another demonstrated improvement in fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c. Sesame oil studies reported a reduction of oxidative stress markers and lipid peroxidation.

== Possible harms ==

=== Allergy ===

Sesame can trigger the same allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, as seen with other food allergens. A cross-reactivity exists between sesame and peanuts, hazelnuts and almonds. In addition to food products derived from sesame seeds, such as &quot;tahini&quot; and sesame oil, persons with sesame allergies are encouraged to be aware of foods that may contain sesame, such as baked goods. In addition to food sources, individuals allergic to sesame have been warned that a variety of non-food sources may also trigger a reaction to sesame, including cosmetics and skin-care products.

Prevalence of sesame allergy is on the order of 0.1–0.2%, but higher in countries in the Middle East and Asia where consumption is more common as part of traditional diets. In the United States, sesame allergy possibly affects 1.5 million individuals.

Canada requires sesame to be labelled as an allergen. In the European Union, identifying the presence of sesame, along with 13 other foods, either as an ingredient or an unintended contaminant in packaged food is compulsory. In the United States, the FASTER Act mandated labeling from 2023.

=== Contamination ===

Contamination by &quot;Salmonella&quot;, &quot;E.coli&quot;, pesticides, or other pathogens may occur in large batches of sesame seeds, such as in September 2020 when high levels of a common industrial compound, ethylene oxide, was found in a 250-tonne shipment of sesame seeds from India. After detection in Belgium, recalls for dozens of products and stores were issued across the European Union, totaling some 50 countries. Products with an organic certification were also affected by the contamination. Regular governmental food inspection for sesame contamination, as for &quot;Salmonella&quot; and &quot;E. coli&quot; in tahini, hummus or seeds, has found that poor hygiene practices during processing are common sources and routes of contamination.

== Culinary use ==

Sesame seed is a common ingredient in many cuisines. Sesame seed cookies called Benne wafers, both sweet and savory, are popular in places such as Charleston, South Carolina. Sesame seeds, also called &quot;benne&quot;, were brought into 17th-century colonial America by enslaved West Africans. The whole plant was used in West African cuisine. The seeds thickened soups and puddings, or were roasted and infused to produce a coffee-like drink. Oil from the seeds substituted for butter, and served as a shortening for cakes. The leaves on mature plants, which are rich in mucilage, can be used as a laxative as well as a treatment for dysentery and cholera. After arriving in North America, the plant was grown by slaves as a subsistence staple to supplement their weekly rations. In Caribbean cuisine, sugar and white sesame seeds are combined into a bar resembling peanut brittle and sold in stores and street corners, like Bahamian Benny cakes.

In Asia, sesame seeds are sprinkled onto sushi-style foods. In Japan, whole seeds are found in many salads and baked snacks, and tan and black sesame seed varieties are roasted and used to make the flavouring &quot;gomashio&quot;. Ground black sesame and rice form zhimahu, a Chinese dessert and breakfast dish. The seeds and oil are used extensively in India, where sesame seeds mixed with heated jaggery, sugar, or palm sugar are made into balls and bars similar to peanut brittle or nut clusters and eaten as snacks, such as &quot;chikki&quot;.

Sesame is a common ingredient in Middle Eastern cuisine. The seeds are made into &quot;tahini&quot; paste and sweet &quot;halva&quot;. It is a common component of the Levantine spice mixture &quot;za&#x27;atar&quot;, popular throughout the Middle East.

Sesame oil is sometimes used for cooking, though not all varieties are suitable for high-temperature frying. The &quot;toasted&quot; form of the oil (as distinguished from the &quot;cold-pressed&quot; form) has a distinctive pleasant aroma and taste, and is sometimes used as a table condiment.

== In literature ==

In myths, the opening of the capsule releases the treasure of sesame seeds, as applied in the story of &quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&quot; when the phrase &quot;Open sesame&quot; magically opens a sealed cave. Upon ripening, sesame pods split, releasing a pop and possibly indicating the origin of this phrase.

<text>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror () is a 1922 silent German Expressionist vampire film directed by F. W. Murnau from a screenplay by Henrik Galeen. It stars Max Schreck as Count Orlok, a vampire who preys on the wife (Greta Schröder) of his estate agent (Gustav von Wangenheim) and brings the plague to their town.

&quot;Nosferatu&quot; was produced by Prana Film and is an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker&#x27;s 1897 novel &quot;Dracula&quot;. Various names and other details were changed from the novel, including Count Dracula being renamed Count Orlok. Although those changes are often represented as a defense against copyright infringement accusations, the original German intertitles acknowledged &quot;Dracula&quot; as the source. Film historian David Kalat states in his commentary track that since the film was &quot;a low-budget film made by Germans for German audiences... setting it in Germany with German-named characters makes the story more tangible and immediate for German-speaking viewers&quot;.

Even with several details altered, Stoker&#x27;s widow sued over the adaptation&#x27;s copyright violation, and a court ruling ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed. However, several prints of &quot;Nosferatu&quot; survived, and the film came to be regarded as an influential masterpiece of cinema and the horror genre. Critic and historian Kim Newman declared it as a film that set the template for the genre of horror film.

==Plot==
In 1838, in the fictional German town of Wisborg, Thomas Hutter is sent to Transylvania by his employer, the eccentric estate agent Herr Knock, to visit a new client, Count Orlok, who is planning on buying a house across from Hutter&#x27;s own residence. As Hutter studies the route on a map, Knock secretly studies a mysterious correspondence in cabalistic symbols. While embarking on his journey, Hutter stops at an inn in which the locals are terrified by the mere mention of Orlok&#x27;s name. In his room, he finds a book about vampires, which he initially scoffs at but puts in his baggage.

After his carriage refuses to take him further than the entrance to the mountain pass, Hutter travels on foot until after sunset, when he is met on the road by a coach and rides to Orlok&#x27;s castle in the Carpathian Mountains, where he is welcomed by Orlok himself. While Hutter is eating supper, he accidentally cuts his thumb; Orlok tries to suck the blood out, but his repulsed guest pulls his hand away. Hutter wakes up the next morning to find fresh punctures on his neck, which he attributes to mosquitoes. That night, Orlok signs the documents to purchase the house and notices on the table a miniature portrait of Hutter&#x27;s wife, Ellen, an image that the young man carries with him in a small circular frame. Admiring the portrait, the count remarks that she has a &quot;lovely neck.&quot; 

Reading the book that he took from the inn, Hutter begins to suspect that Orlok is indeed a vampire. With no way to bar the door to his bedroom, Hutter desperately tries to hide as midnight approaches. Suddenly, the door begins to slowly open by itself and, as Orlok enters, a terrified Hutter hides under the bedcovers and falls unconscious. Meanwhile, back in Wisborg, Ellen arises from her own bed and sleepwalks to the railing of her bedroom&#x27;s balcony. She starts walking on top of the railing, which gets the attention of Thomas&#x27; friend Harding in the adjacent room. When the doctor arrives, Ellen envisions Orlok in his castle threatening her unconscious husband and shouts Hutter&#x27;s name, which somehow Orlok is able to hear, causing him to withdraw.

On the next day, Hutter explores the castle. In a vault, he finds the coffin in which Orlok is resting dormant in the crypt and flees back to his room. Hours later, as Hutter watches, Orlok piles up coffins on a coach and climbs into the last one before the coach departs; Hutter manages to escape from the castle and rushes home. The coffins are taken aboard a schooner, where the sailors discover rats in the coffins. All of the crewmen later die, and Orlok takes control of the vessel. When the ship arrives in Wisborg, Orlok leaves unobserved, carrying one of his coffins, and moves into the house that he purchased.

Many deaths in the town follow Orlok&#x27;s arrival, which the local doctors attribute to an unspecified plague caused by the rats from the ship. Knock, who has gone completely insane, is confined to the mental asylum, but escapes. Ellen reads the book that Hutter found; it claims that a vampire can be destroyed if a pure-hearted woman distracts the vampire from the approaching dawn with her beauty and by offering him her blood of her own free will; she decides to sacrifice herself. Knock is eventually re-captured and returned to the asylum. Ellen opens her window to invite Orlok in and pretends to fall ill so that she can send Hutter to fetch Professor Bulwer, a physician. After he leaves, Orlok enters and drinks her blood, but the sun rises, the rays of which causes Orlok to vanish in a puff of smoke, which Knock in his asylum cell senses and is shattered by. Ellen lives just long enough to be embraced by her grief-stricken husband.

The film&#x27;s final image is that of Orlok&#x27;s castle, destroyed.

==Themes==
===The Other===
&quot;Nosferatu&quot; has been noted for its themes regarding fear of the Other, as well as for possible antisemitic undertones, both of which may have been partially derived from the Bram Stoker novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, upon which the film was based. The physical appearance of Count Orlok, with his hooked nose, long claw-like fingernails, and large bald head, has been compared to stereotypical caricatures of Jewish people from the time in which &quot;Nosferatu&quot; was produced. His features have also been compared to those of a rat or a mouse, the former of which Jews were often equated with. Orlok&#x27;s interest in acquiring property in the German town of Wisborg, a shift in locale from the Stoker novel&#x27;s London, has also been analyzed as preying on the fears and anxieties of the German public at the time. Professor Tony Magistrale wrote that the film&#x27;s depiction of an &quot;invasion of the German homeland by an outside force [...] poses disquieting parallels to the anti-Semitic atmosphere festering in Northern Europe in 1922.&quot;

When the foreign Orlok arrives in Wisborg by ship, he brings with him a swarm of rats which, in a deviation from the source novel, spread the plague throughout the town. This plot element further associates Orlok with rodents and the idea of the &quot;Jew as disease-causing agent&quot;. It is also notable that Orlok&#x27;s accomplice in conspiracy Knock is a Jewish realtor, who acts as the vampire&#x27;s fifth column in the Biedermeier town of Wisborg. There were other views – writer Kevin Jackson has noted that director F. W. Murnau &quot;was friendly with and protective of a number of Jewish men and women&quot; throughout his life, including Jewish actor Alexander Granach, who plays Knock in &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. Additionally, Magistrale wrote that Murnau, being a homosexual, would have been &quot;presumably more sensitive to the persecution of a subgroup inside the larger German society&quot;. As such, it has been said that perceived associations between Orlok and antisemitic stereotypes are unlikely to have been conscious decisions on the part of Murnau.

===Occultism===

Murnau and Grau gave Orlok in the film a demonic lineage and an occult origin: Orlok is the creation of Belial, one of the Satanic archdemons. Belial in Psalm 41:8–10 is also associated with pestilence, with Orlok in film being a manifestation of contagion, rats pouring out of his coffins onto the streets of Wisborg, spreading Black Death. Orlok&#x27;s link to Belial is also significant because Belial is &quot;one of the demons traditionally summoned by Goetic magicians&quot; – making Orlok someone who practiced dark sorcery before becoming a vampire.

Orlok and his servant Knock are communicating in occult language – the documents between Orlok and Knock are written in Enochian, a constructed language said to be that of the angels, which was recorded in the private journals of English occultist John Dee and his colleague English alchemist Edward Kelley in late 16th-century Elizabethan England.

The character of Professor Bulwer in the film is named in reference to English occult novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton. The idea of astral entities, arising from the dark thoughts of human beings, responsible for epidemics that call for blood sacrifices in order to prevent them, is also closely linked to that of the alchemist Paracelsus, whose figure is partly embodied in the film in the character of Professor Bulwer (who is mentioned in the film to be Paracelsian himself). This is made concrete in the film in the plague epidemic that spreads through the city of Wisborg, which cannot be remedied by scientific methods, but by the blood sacrifice of a woman, thus destroying forever the dark being responsible for this catastrophic situation.

===World War I===

The idea for making this vampire film saw its genesis in the war-time experience of producer Albin Grau. Grau served in the German army during World War I on the Serbian front. While in Serbia, Grau encountered a local farmer who told him of his father, who the farmer believed had become an undead vampire. F. W. Murnau, director of the film, also saw considerable action in World War I – not only as a company commander in the trenches of the Eastern Front, but also later in the air after he transferred to the German air service. He survived at least eight crashes. Max Schreck who portrayed Count Orlok also served in the trenches with the German army. Little is known of his war-time experience, but there are some signs he may have dealt with some form of post-traumatic stress disorder. Colleagues commented that he preferred to keep to himself. He was known to take long walks in the forest alone, oftentimes disappearing for hours at a time. He once stated that he lived in &quot;a remote and incorporeal world&quot;. Thus it is considered that the turmoil of 1920s Germany and the war-time experiences of those who produced the film left their marks on the production of the film.

As Lotte Eisner, a dedicated occultist, wrote: &quot;Mysticism and magic, the dark forces to which Germans have always been more than willing to commit themselves, had flourished in the face of death on the battlefields&quot; – these forces were intrinsic to the shaping of cinema&#x27;s first vampires. Albin Grau himself also linked the war and vampires: &quot;this monstrous event that is unleashed across the earth like a cosmic vampire to drink the blood of millions and millions of men&quot;. Belial as well is the link between war and contagion, as Orlok is linked directly to the Black Death and many critics have linked &quot;Nosferatu&quot;″s disease-bearing rodents to the transmissible sickness associated with trench warfare in which rats flourished. As noted by Ernest Jones in his psychoanalytic study of nightmares, vampire legends proliferate in periods of mass contagion.

==Production==
The studio behind &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, Prana Film, was a short-lived silent-era German film studio founded in 1921 by Enrico Dieckmann and occultist artist Albin Grau, named after a Theosophical journal which was itself named for the Hindu concept of . Although the studio&#x27;s intent was to produce occult- and supernatural-themed films, &quot;Nosferatu&quot; was its only production, as it declared bankruptcy shortly after the film&#x27;s release.
Grau claimed he was inspired to shoot a vampire film by a war experience: in Grau&#x27;s apocryphal tale, during the winter of 1916, a Serbian farmer told him that his father was a vampire and one of the undead. As a lifelong student of the occult and member of , under the magical name of Master Pacitius, Grau was able to imbue Nosferatu with hermetic and mystical undertones. One example in particular was the cryptic contract that Count Orlok and Knock exchanged, which was filled in Enochian, hermetic and alchemical symbols. Grau was also a strong influence on Orlok&#x27;s verminous and emaciated look and he also designed the film&#x27;s sets, costumes, make-up and the letter with the Enochian symbols. He also was responsible for film&#x27;s advertising campaign, creating movie posters and advertisements. Grau&#x27;s visual style was also deeply influenced by work of the artist Hugo Steiner-Prag who had illustrated other texts with esoteric subjects, such as Gustav Meyrink’s &quot;Golem&quot; and E. T. A. Hoffmann’s (1907).

Diekmann and Grau gave Henrik Galeen, a disciple of Hanns Heinz Ewers, the task to write a screenplay inspired by the &quot;Dracula&quot; novel, although Prana Film had not obtained the film rights. Galeen was an experienced specialist in dark romanticism; he had already worked on &quot;The Student of Prague&quot; (1913), and the screenplay for &quot;The Golem: How He Came into the World&quot; (1920). Galeen set the story in the fictional north German harbour town of Wisborg. He changed the characters&#x27; names and added the idea of the vampire bringing the plague to Wisborg via rats on the ship. Galeen&#x27;s Expressionist style screenplay was poetically rhythmic, without being so dismembered as other books influenced by literary Expressionism, such as those by Carl Mayer. Lotte Eisner described Galeen&#x27;s screenplay as &quot;&quot; (&quot;full of poetry, full of rhythm&quot;).

Actor Conrad Veidt was offered the role of Count Orlok, having previously worked with Murnau, but had to decline for scheduling reasons. In the search for an alternative the choice finally fell on the then-still-unknown actor Max Schreck.

Filming began in July 1921, with exterior shots in Wismar. A take from &#x27;s tower over Wismar marketplace with the served as the establishing shot for the Wisborg scene. Other locations were the , the yard and the harbour. In Lübeck, the abandoned served as Nosferatu&#x27;s new Wisborg house, the one of the churchyard of the served as Hutter&#x27;s, and down the a procession of coffin bearers bore coffins of supposed plague victims. Many scenes of Lübeck appear in the hunt for Knock, who ordered Hutter in the &quot;Yard of &quot; to meet Count Orlok. Further exterior shots followed in Lauenburg, Rostock and on Sylt. The exteriors of the film set in Transylvania were actually shot on location in northern Slovakia, including the High Tatras, Vrátna dolina, Orava Castle, the Váh River, and . The team filmed interior shots at the JOFA studio in Berlin&#x27;s Johannisthal locality and further exteriors in the Tegel Forest.

For cost reasons, cameraman Fritz Arno Wagner only had one camera available, and therefore there was only one original negative. The director followed Galeen&#x27;s screenplay carefully, following handwritten instructions on camera positioning, lighting, and related matters. Nevertheless, Murnau completely rewrote 12 pages of the script, as Galeen&#x27;s text was missing from the director&#x27;s working script. This concerned the last scene of the film, in which Ellen sacrifices herself and the vampire dies in the first rays of the sun. Murnau prepared carefully; there were sketches that were to correspond exactly to each filmed scene, and he used a metronome to control the pace of the acting.

==Music==
The original score was composed by Hans Erdmann and performed by an orchestra at the film&#x27;s Berlin premiere. However, most of the score has been lost, and what remains is only a partial adapted suite. Thus, throughout the history of &quot;Nosferatu&quot; screenings, many composers and musicians have written or improvised their own soundtrack to accompany the film. For example, James Bernard, composer of the soundtracks of many Hammer horror films in the late 1950s and 1960s, wrote a score for a reissue. Bernard&#x27;s score was released in 1997 by Silva Screen Records. A version of Erdmann&#x27;s original score reconstructed by musicologists and composers Gillian Anderson and James Kessler was released in 1995 by BMG Classics, with multiple missing sequences composed anew, in an attempt to match Erdmann&#x27;s style. An earlier reconstruction by German composer Berndt Heller has many additions of unrelated classical works. In 1998, Arrow Films released a version on VHS of the film scored by songs from doom metal band Type O Negative, which also featured an introduction with actor David Carradine. In 2022, the New York Times wrote about Dutch composer Jozef van Wissem&#x27;s new score and record release for &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. Beginning with a solo played on the lute, his performance incorporates electric guitar and distorted recordings of extinct birds, graduating from subtlety to gothic horror. &quot;My soundtrack goes from silence to noise over the course of 90 minutes,&quot; he said, culminating in &quot;dense, slow death metal.&quot; A new score for full orchestra and piano was commissioned by the Louisville Orchestra from its former composer-in-residence Sebastian Chang. It premiered, playing live with the film, in October 2023.

==Release==
Shortly before the premiere, an advertisement campaign was placed in issue #21 of the magazine &#x27;, with a summary, scene and work photographs, production reports, and essays, including a treatment on vampirism by Albin Grau. &quot;Nosferatu&quot; opened in the Netherlands on 16 February 1922 at the Hague Flora and Olympia cinemas. &quot;Nosferatu&quot; premiered in Germany on 4 March 1922 in the &quot;Marmorsaal&quot; of the Berlin Zoological Garden. This was planned as a large society evening entitled &#x27; (Festival of Nosferatu), and guests were asked to arrive dressed in Biedermeier costume. The German cinema premiere itself took place on 15 March 1922 at Berlin&#x27;s .

The 1930s sound version &quot;Die zwölfte Stunde – Eine Nacht des Grauens&quot; (&quot;The Twelfth Hour: A Night of Horror&quot;), which is less commonly known, was a completely unauthorized and re-edited version of the film. It was released in Vienna, Austria on 16 May 1930 with sound-on-disc accompaniment and a recomposition of Hans Erdmann&#x27;s original score by Georg Fiebiger, a German production manager and composer of film music. It had an alternative ending lighter than the original and the characters were renamed again; Count Orlok&#x27;s name was changed to Prince Wolkoff, Knock became Karsten, Hutter and Ellen became Kundberg and Margitta, and Annie was changed to Maria. This version, of which Murnau was unaware, contained many scenes filmed by Murnau but not previously released. It also contained additional footage not filmed by Murnau but by a cameraman, Günther Krampf, under the direction of (also known as Waldemar Ronger), supposedly also a film editor and lab chemist. The name of director F. W. Murnau is no longer mentioned in the credits. This version, lasting approximately 80 minutes, was presented on 5 June 1981 at the Cinémathèque Française.

==Reception==
&quot;Nosferatu&quot; brought Murnau into the public eye, especially when his film &quot;Der brennende Acker&quot; (&quot;The Burning Soil&quot;) was released a few days later. The press reported extensively on &quot;Nosferatu&quot; and its premiere. With the laudatory votes, there was also occasional criticism that the technical perfection and clarity of the images did not fit the horror theme. The &quot;Filmkurier&quot; of 6 March 1922 said that the vampire appeared too corporeal and brightly lit to appear genuinely scary. Hans Wollenberg described the film in &quot;photo-Stage&quot; No. 11 of 11 March 1922 as a &quot;sensation&quot; and praised Murnau&#x27;s nature shots as &quot;mood-creating elements.&quot; In the &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot; of 7 March 1922, &quot;Nosferatu&quot; was praised for its visual style.

&quot;Nosferatu&quot; was also the first film to show a vampire dying from exposure to sunlight. Previous vampire novels such as &quot;Dracula&quot; had shown them being uncomfortable with sunlight, but not mortally susceptible.
The film has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 72 reviews, with an average rating of 9.05/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;One of the silent era&#x27;s most influential masterpieces, &quot;Nosferatu&quot;″s eerie, gothic feel – and a chilling performance from Max Schreck as the vampire – set the template for the horror films that followed.&quot; In 1995, the Vatican included &quot;Nosferatu&quot; on a list of 45 important films that people should watch. It was ranked twenty-first in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

In 1997, critic Roger Ebert added &quot;Nosferatu&quot; to his list of &quot;The Great Movies&quot;, writing:

==Home media and copyright status==
&quot;Nosferatu&quot; only entered the public domain worldwide by the end of 2019. Despite this, the film had already been subject to widespread circulation via a sped-up, unrestored black and white bootleg copy. Beginning in 1981, the film has had various different official restorations, several of which have been issued on home video in the U.S., Europe and Australia. These versions, which are all tinted, speed-corrected and have specially recorded scores, are separately copyrighted with respect to new copyrightable elements. The most recent restoration, completed in 2005/2006, has been released on DVD and Blu-ray throughout the world, and features a reconstruction of Hans Erdmann&#x27;s original score by Berndt Heller.

==Remakes==
In 1977, Spanish amateur filmmaker José Ernesto Díaz Noriega added humorous and iconoclastic dialogues to the film. His adaptation or détournement, titled &quot;Manuscrito encontrato en Zarazwela or Nos fera tu la pugnete&quot;, was based on a S8 mm print of the English version. &quot;Observing the curious coincidence of the fiction that is related in the film with history&quot;, Díaz Noriega adapted &quot;Nosferatu&quot;&#x27;s plot to the years of the Spanish transition to democracy: Prime Minister Arias Navarro becomes Draculas Navarro and Juan Carlos de Borbón becomes Jonathan Carolus (prince of Franconia). The original Transylvania becomes Galitzia and the Pazo de Meirás becomes the vampire&#x27;s castle. All Murnau&#x27;s characters find equivalence in the political actors of the Spanish transition to democracy.

&quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot;, a 1979 remake of the film was directed and written by Werner Herzog and starred Klaus Kinski. Although based on the 1922 film, the characters&#x27; names are faithful to Bram Stoker novel.

A remake by director David Lee Fisher, starring Doug Jones as Count Orlok, premiered in November 2023 at the Emagine Theater in Novi, Michigan. The film uses green screen to insert colorized backgrounds from the original film atop live-action, a process Fisher previously used for his remake &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (2005). It was later released on video on demand via Amazon Prime Video in September 2024 and on streaming though Apple TV+ on 18 October 2024.

In July 2015, a remake was announced with Robert Eggers writing and directing. It was reported in September 2022 that Eggers&#x27; remake would be distributed by Focus Features, with Bill Skarsgård set to star as Orlok and Lily-Rose Depp as Ellen Hutter. Willem Dafoe, Nicholas Hoult, and Emma Corrin also appear. The film wrapped principal photography on 19 May 2023. The film&#x27;s first teaser trailer was released on 24 June 2024, and the film itself later released on 25 December 2024.

<text>A gnomon (; ) is the part of a sundial that casts a shadow. The term is used for a variety of purposes in mathematics and other fields, typically to measure directions, position, or time.

==History==

A painted stick dating from 2300 BC that was excavated at the archeological site of Taosi is the oldest gnomon known in China. The gnomon was widely used in ancient China from the second millennium BC onward in order to determine the changes in seasons, orientation, and geographical latitude. The ancient Chinese used shadow measurements for creating calendars that are mentioned in several ancient texts. 

According to the collection of Zhou Chinese poetic anthologies &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, one of the distant ancestors of King Wen of the Zhou dynasty used to measure gnomon shadow lengths to determine the orientation around the 14th century BC.
The ancient Greek philosopher Anaximander (610–546 BC) is credited with introducing this Babylonian instrument to the Ancient Greeks. 

The ancient Greek mathematician and astronomer Oenopides used the phrase &quot;drawn gnomon-wise&quot; to describe a line drawn perpendicular to another. Later, the term was used for an L-shaped instrument like a steel square used to draw right angles. This shape may explain its use to describe a shape formed by cutting a smaller square from a larger one. Euclid extended the term to the plane figure formed by removing a similar parallelogram from a corner of a larger parallelogram. Indeed, the gnomon is the increment between two successive figurate numbers, including square and triangular numbers. 

=== Definition of Hero of Alexandria ===
The ancient Greek mathematician and engineer Hero of Alexandria defined a gnomon as that which, when added or subtracted to an entity (number or shape), makes a new entity similar to the starting entity. In this sense Theon of Smyrna used it to describe a number which added to a polygonal number produces the next one of the same type. The most common use in this sense is an odd integer especially when seen as a figurate number between square numbers. 

===Vitruvius===
Vitruvius mentions the gnomon as &quot;&quot; in the first sentence of chapter 3 in volume 1 of his book &quot;De Architectura&quot;. That Latin term &quot; leaves room for interpretation. Despite its similarity to &quot; (or its feminine form &quot;&quot;), it appears unlikely that Vitruvius refers to judgement on the one hand or to the design of sundials on the other. It appears to be more appropriate to assume that he refers to geometry, a science upon which gnomons rely heavily. In those days, calculations were carried out geometrically, in contrast to the algebraic methods in use today. Thus, it seems that he indirectly refers to mathematics and geodesy.

==Pinhole gnomons==

Perforated gnomons projecting a pinhole image of the Sun whose location can be measured to tell the time of day and year were described in the Chinese &quot;Zhoubi Suanjing&quot;, possibly dating as early as the early Zhou (11th century BC) but surviving only in forms dating to the Eastern Han (3rd century). 

In the Middle East and Europe, it was separately credited to the Egyptian astronomer and mathematician Ibn Yunus around AD 1000. The Italian astronomer, mathematician and cosmographer Paolo Toscanelli is associated with the 1475 placement of a bronze plate with a round hole in the dome of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence to project an image of the Sun on the cathedral&#x27;s floor. With markings on the floor it tells the exact time of each midday (reportedly to within half a second) as well as the date of the summer solstice. Italian mathematician, engineer, astronomer and geographer Leonardo Ximenes reconstructed the gnomon according to his new measurements in 1756.

==Orientation==

In the Northern Hemisphere, the shadow-casting edge of a sundial gnomon is normally oriented so that it points due northward and is parallel to the rotational axis of Earth. That is, it is inclined to the northern horizon at an angle that equals the latitude of the sundial&#x27;s location. At present, such a gnomon should thus point almost precisely at Polaris, as this is within 1° of the north celestial pole.

On some sundials, the gnomon is vertical. These were usually used in former times for observing the altitude of the Sun, especially when on the meridian.

=== Style ===
The &quot;style&quot; is the part of the gnomon that casts the shadow. This can change as the Sun moves. For example, the upper west edge of the gnomon might be the style in the morning and the upper east edge might be the style in the afternoon.

==Modern uses==
Gnomons have been used in space missions to the Moon and Mars. The gnomon used by the Apollo astronauts was a gimballed stadia rod mounted on a tripod. While the rod&#x27;s shadow indicated the direction of the Sun, the grayscale paints of varying reflectivity and the red, green and blue patches facilitated proper photography on the surface on the Moon. MarsDials have been used on Mars Exploration Rovers.

==In computer graphics==

A three-dimensional gnomon is commonly used in CAD and computer graphics as an aid to positioning objects in the virtual world. By convention, the &quot;x&quot;-axis direction is colored red, the &quot;y&quot;-axis green and the &quot;z&quot;-axis blue. 

==In popular culture==
The Gnomon of Saint-Sulpice inside the Parisian church, Église Saint-Sulpice, built to assist in determining the date of Easter, was fictionalized as a &quot;Rose Line&quot; in the novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;.

<doc id="82425" wikidata="Q28803" url="?curid=82425" title="Sandwich">
<text>A sandwich is a dish typically consisting variously of meat, cheese, sauces, and vegetables used as a filling between slices of bread, or placed atop a slice of bread; or, more generally, any dish in which bread serves as a &quot;container&quot; or &quot;wrapper&quot; for another food type, and allows it to be a finger food. The sandwich began as a portable, convenient food in the Western world, though over time it has become prevalent worldwide.

There has been social media debate over the precise definition of &quot;sandwich&quot;, specifically whether a hot dog or open sandwich can be categorized as such. Other items, like hamburgers and burritos, were also considered. In the United States, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are the responsible agencies for protecting the definition of &quot;sandwich&quot;. The USDA uses the definition, &quot;at least 35% cooked meat and no more than 50% bread&quot; for closed sandwiches, and &quot;at least 50% cooked meat&quot; for open sandwiches. However, the same USDA manual determines that burritos and fajitas are &quot;sandwich-like&quot; and frankfurters are &quot;sandwich type&quot;, while stromboli is explicitly excluded. In Britain, the British Sandwich Association defines a sandwich as &quot;any form of bread with a filling, generally assembled cold&quot;; a definition which includes wraps and bagels, but potentially excludes dishes assembled and served hot, such as burgers.

Sandwiches are a popular type of lunch food, taken to work, school, or picnics to be eaten as part of a packed lunch. The bread is frequently coated with condiments such as mayonnaise or mustard to enhance its flavour and texture, but may be served plain (&quot;dry&quot;). As well as being homemade, sandwiches are also widely sold in various retail outlets and can be served hot or cold. Although savoury sandwiches—such as deli meat sandwiches—are in the majority, sweet sandwiches—such as jam sandwiches and fluffernutters—form their own category.

The sandwich is named after the inventor of a certain roast beef sandwich in 18th century England, John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; has described it as Britain&#x27;s &quot;biggest contribution to gastronomy&quot;.

==History and etymology==
===Early sandwiches and sandwich-like foods===
The use of some kind of bread or bread-like substance to lie under some other food, or to scoop it up and enclose or wrap it, is found in many cultures historically. Before being known as a &quot;sandwich&quot;, this food combination seems to have been known as &quot;bread and meat&quot; or &quot;bread and cheese&quot;. These two phrases are found throughout English drama from the 16th and 17th centuries.

In the first century BCE, the ancient Jewish sage Hillel the Elder is said to have wrapped meat from the Paschal lamb and bitter herbs in a soft matzah—flat, unleavened bread—during Passover in the manner of a modern wrap made with flatbread. Flat breads of only slightly varying kinds have long been used to scoop or wrap small amounts of food en route from platter to mouth throughout Western Asia and northern Africa. From Morocco to Ethiopia to India, bread is usually baked in flat rounds, contrasting with the European loaf tradition.

During the Middle Ages in Europe, thick slabs of coarse and usually stale bread, called &quot;trenchers,&quot; were used as plates. After a meal, the food-soaked trencher was fed to a dog or to beggars at the tables of the wealthy, and eaten by diners in more modest circumstances. The immediate culinary precursor with a direct connection to the English sandwich was to be found in the Netherlands of the seventeenth century, where the naturalist John Ray observed that in the taverns beef hung from the rafters &quot;which they cut into thin slices and eat with bread and butter laying the slices upon the butter&quot;—explanatory specifications that reveal the Dutch &quot;belegde broodje&quot;, open-faced sandwich, was as yet unfamiliar in England. The word &quot;sandwich&quot; appears, referring to a certain roast beef sandwich in England. 
Initially perceived as food that men shared while gaming and drinking at night, the sandwich slowly began appearing in polite society as a late-night meal among the aristocracy. The sandwich is named after John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, an eighteenth-century English aristocrat. It is commonly said that Lord Sandwich, during long sessions of cribbage and other card games at public gambling houses, would order his valet to bring him roast beef between two pieces of toasted bread. He was fond of this form of food because it allowed him to continue gambling while eating, without the need for a fork, and without getting his cards greasy from eating meat with his bare hands. The dish then grew in popularity in London, and Sandwich&#x27;s name became associated with it. The rumour in its familiar form appeared in Pierre-Jean Grosley&#x27;s &quot;Londres&quot; (Neuchâtel, 1770), translated as &quot;A Tour to London&quot; in 1772; Grosley&#x27;s impressions had been formed during a year in London in 1765. An alternative is provided by Sandwich&#x27;s biographer, N. A. M. Rodger, who suggests Sandwich&#x27;s commitments to the Navy, and to politics and the arts, mean the first sandwich was more likely to have been consumed at his desk.

The sandwich&#x27;s popularity in Spain and England increased dramatically during the nineteenth century, when the rise of industrial society and the working classes made fast, portable, and inexpensive meals essential. In London, for example, at least seventy street vendors were selling ham sandwiches by 1850; during that decade sandwich bars also became an important form of eating establishment in western Holland, typically serving liver and salt beef sandwiches.

In the United States, the sandwich was first promoted as an elaborate meal at supper. By the early 20th century, as bread became a staple of the American diet, the sandwich became the same kind of popular, quick meal as was already widespread in the Mediterranean.

==Language==
In the US, a court in Boston, Massachusetts, ruled in 2006 that a sandwich includes at least two slices of bread and &quot;under this definition, this court finds that the term &#x27;sandwich&#x27; is not commonly understood to include burritos, tacos, and quesadillas, which are typically made with a single tortilla and stuffed with a choice filling of meat, rice, and beans.&quot; The issue stemmed from the question of whether a restaurant that sold burritos could move into a shopping centre where another restaurant had a no-compete clause in its lease prohibiting other &quot;sandwich&quot; shops. Also in the US, a court in Indiana ruled in 2024 that tacos and burritos are sandwiches, specifically that &quot;The Court agrees with Quintana that tacos and burritos are Mexican-style sandwiches&quot;. The court further ruled that such a definition of sandwich would also apply to a &quot;restaurant that serves made-to-order Greek gyros, Indian naan wraps, or Vietnamese banh mi&quot;. The state of New York has a definition of &quot;sandwich&quot; that explicitly includes burritos, gyros, hot dogs, and wraps and pita sandwiches.

In Spain, where the word &quot;sandwich&quot; is borrowed from the English language, it refers to a food item made with English sandwich bread. It is otherwise known as a &quot;bocadillo&quot;. Similar usage applies in other Spanish-speaking cultures, such as Mexico, where the word &quot;torta&quot; is also used for a popular variety of roll-type sandwiches.

In the UK and Australia, the term &quot;sandwich&quot; is more narrowly defined than in the US: it usually refers to an item that uses sliced bread from a loaf. An item with similar fillings but using an entire bread roll cut horizontally in half, is generally referred to as a &quot;roll&quot;, or with certain hot fillings, a &quot;burger&quot;. However, in Australia hot sliced (not ground) beef between two slices of toasted bread is referred to as a &quot;steak sandwich&quot;: the sliced loaf bread distinguishes the steak sandwich from a burger.

The verb &quot;to sandwich&quot; has the meaning &quot;to position anything between two other things of a different character, or to place different elements alternately,&quot; and the noun &quot;sandwich&quot; has related meanings derived from this more general definition. For example, an ice cream sandwich consists of a layer of ice cream between two layers of cake or biscuit. Similarly, Oreos and Custard creams are described as sandwich biscuits (UK/Commonwealth) or sandwich cookies (US) because they consist of a soft filling between the baked layers. In corporate finance, Dutch Sandwich and Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich refer to schemes for tax evasion.

The word &quot;butty&quot;, originally referring to a buttered slice of bread, is common in some northern and southern parts of England and Wales as a slang synonym for &quot;sandwich,&quot; particularly to refer to certain kinds of sandwiches including the chip butty, bacon butty, or sausage butty. &quot;Sarnie&quot; is a similar colloquialism. Likewise, the word &quot;sanger&quot; is used for sandwich in Australian slang. The colloquial Scottish word &quot;piece&quot; may refer either to a sandwich or to a light meal, especially one that includes a sandwich. For example, the phrase &quot;jeely piece&quot; refers to a jam sandwich.

The colloquial form &quot;sammich&quot; (alternatively, &quot;sammidge&quot;) is used in the Southeastern United States. In Japanese, &quot;sando&quot; or &quot;sandoichi&quot; is used.

==Pre-made sandwiches==

Sandwiches have been widely sold in cafes, railway stations, pubs and diners since the invention of sliced bread in the 1920s. Sandwiches kept unwrapped, drying up and edges curling, until they were sold, were widely found in Britain until the 1970s. Cafes and buffets in railway stations and on trains were notorious, and the term &quot;British Rail sandwich&quot; was often used satirically.

In 1979, the British store chain Marks &amp; Spencer introduced a small range of chilled, pre-made sandwiches sold in wedge-shaped boxes, sealed to keep them fresh. As they proved popular, a small experiment involving five stores rapidly grew to cover more than one hundred stores. Within a year, the store was looking for ways to manufacture sandwiches at an industrial scale. By the end of the decade, the British sandwich industry had become worth £1bn. In 2017, the British sandwich industry made and sold £8 billion worth of sandwiches.

It was that introduced comics in Italy in 1908 through a supplement for children, namely &quot;Corriere dei Piccoli&quot; (&quot;Courier of the Little Ones&quot;).

The newspaper&#x27;s headquarters has been in the same buildings since the beginning of the 20th century, and therefore it is popularly known as &quot;the Via Solferino newspaper&quot;, after the street where it is still located. As the name indicates, it was originally an evening paper. During the Fascist regime in Italy, funded the Mussolini Prize, which was awarded to the writers Ada Negri and Emilio Cecchi, among the others. Mario Borsa, a militant anti-fascist, was appointed the editor-in-chief of in May 1945; the next year, the paper was relaunched as &quot;Il Nuovo Corriere della Sera&quot;, a name that it kept until 1959, to distance itself from its support of Fascism. Borsa was fired because of his political leanings in August 1946 and was replaced by Guglielmo Emanuel, a right-wing journalist. Emanuel served in the post until 1952.

In the 1950s, was the organ of the conservative establishment in Italy and was strongly anti-communist and pro-NATO.

<doc id="82429" wikidata="Q242095" url="?curid=82429" title="Dino Buzzati">
<text>Dino Buzzati-Traverso (; 14 October 1906 – 28 January 1972) was an Italian novelist, short story writer, painter and poet, as well as a journalist for &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;. His worldwide fame is mostly due to his novel &quot;The Tartar Steppe&quot;, although he is also known for his well-received collections of short stories.

==Life==
Buzzati was born in San Pellegrino, Belluno, in his family&#x27;s ancestral villa. Buzzati&#x27;s mother, a veterinarian by profession, was Venetian and his father, a professor of international law, was from an old Bellunese family. Buzzati was the second of his parents&#x27; four children. One of his brothers was the well-known Italian geneticist Adriano Buzzati-Traverso. In 1924, he enrolled in the law faculty of the University of Milan, where his father once taught. As he was completing his studies in law, he was hired, at the age of 22, by the Milanese newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, where he would remain employed until his death. He began in the editorial department. Later he worked as a reporter, special correspondent, essayist, editor, and art critic. It is often said that his journalistic background informs his writing, lending even the most fantastic tales an aura of realism.

Buzzati himself commented on the connection (as cited by Lawrence Venuti):
During World War II, Buzzati served in Africa as a journalist attached to the Regia Marina. After the end of the war, &quot;Il deserto dei Tartari&quot; was published nationwide in Italy and quickly brought critical recognition and fame to the author. He married Almerina Antoniazzi in 1966. He published his last novel, &quot;Un amore,&quot; concerning love, in that year. In 1972, Buzzati died of cancer after a protracted illness.

==Works summary==
Buzzati began writing fiction in 1933. His works of fiction include five novels, theatre and radio plays, librettos, numerous books of short stories, and poetry. His libretti include four for operas by Luciano Chailly, as well as one for &quot;La giacca dannata&quot; by Giulio Viozzi.

He wrote a children&#x27;s book, &quot;La famosa invasione degli orsi in Sicilia&quot; (translated by Frances Lobb into English as &quot;The Bears&#x27; Famous Invasion of Sicily&quot;). Lemony Snicket wrote an introduction and reader&#x27;s companion to a 2005 English edition.

Also an artist, Buzzati combined his artistic and writing exploits into making a comic book based on the myth of Orpheus, &quot;Poem Strip&quot;. Commenting on the graphic element, he once explained that &quot;for me, painting and writing are the same thing.&quot;

&quot;The Tartar Steppe&quot;, his most famous novel, tells the story of a military outpost that awaits a Tartar invasion. In its sentiment and its conclusions, it has been compared to existentialist works, notably Albert Camus&#x27;s &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;.

His writing is sometimes cited as magical realism or social alienation. The fate of the environment and fantasy in the face of unbridled technological progress are recurring themes. He wrote a variety of short stories featuring fantastic animals such as the bogeyman and, his own invention, the colomber (&quot;il colombre&quot;). His &quot;Sessanta racconti&quot; collection of sixty stories, which won the Strega Prize in 1958, features elements of science fiction, fantasy, and horror.

<text>The Algerian War (also known as the Algerian Revolution or the Algerian War of Independence) was a major armed conflict between France and the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) from 1954 to 1962, which led to Algeria winning its independence from France. An important decolonization war, it was a complex conflict characterized by guerrilla warfare and war crimes. The conflict also became a civil war between the different communities and within the communities. The war took place mainly on the territory of Algeria, with repercussions in metropolitan France.

Effectively started by members of the FLN on 1 November 1954, during the (&quot;Red All Saints&#x27; Day&quot;), the conflict led to serious political crises in France, causing the fall of the Fourth Republic (1946–58), to be replaced by the Fifth Republic with a strengthened presidency. The brutality of the methods employed by the French forces failed to win hearts and minds in Algeria, alienated support in metropolitan France, and discredited French prestige abroad. As the war dragged on, the French public slowly turned against it and many of France&#x27;s key allies, including the United States, switched from supporting France to abstaining in the UN debate on Algeria. After major demonstrations in Algiers and several other cities in favor of independence (1960) and a United Nations resolution recognizing the right to independence, Charles de Gaulle, the first president of the Fifth Republic, decided to open a series of negotiations with the FLN. These concluded with the signing of the Évian Accords in March 1962. A referendum took place on 8 April 1962 and the French electorate approved the Évian Accords. The final result was 91% in favor of the ratification of this agreement and on 1 July, the Accords were subject to a second referendum in Algeria, where 99.72% voted for independence and just 0.28% against.

The planned French withdrawal led to a state crisis. This included various assassination attempts on de Gaulle as well as some attempts at military coups. Most of the former were carried out by the (OAS), an underground organization formed mainly from French military personnel supporting a French Algeria, which committed a large number of bombings and murders both in Algeria and in the homeland to stop the planned independence.

The war caused the deaths of between 400,000 and 1.5 million Algerians, 25,600 French soldiers, and 6,000 Europeans. War crimes committed during the war included massacres of civilians, rape, and torture; the French destroyed over 8,000 villages and relocated over 2 million Algerians to concentration camps. Upon independence in 1962, 900,000 European-Algerians (&quot;&quot;) fled to France within a few months for fear of the FLN&#x27;s revenge. The French government was unprepared to receive such a vast number of refugees, which caused turmoil in France. The majority of Algerian Muslims who had worked for the French were disarmed and left behind, as the agreement between French and Algerian authorities declared that no actions could be taken against them. However, the Harkis in particular, having served as auxiliaries with the French army, were regarded as traitors and by the FLN or by lynch mobs, often after being abducted and tortured. About 20,000 Harki families (around 90,000 people) managed to flee to France, some with help from their French officers acting against orders, and today they and their descendants form a significant part of the population of Algerians in France.

== Background ==
=== Conquest of Algeria ===

The decision to capture Algiers was made by Charles X and his ministers in January 1830. An invasion had already been discussed in 1827 in part in reaction to Barbary pirates activities and their ransoming of Christian captives and slaves, and the refusal of Marseilles merchants to pay their debts to the Dey of Algiers. By early 1830 however, the real motive was to distract and assuage with a foreign conquest French opinion hostile to the increasingly authoritarian king.

On the pretext of a slight to their consul, the French attacked and captured Algiers in June 1830. In following years the conquest spread to the interior. Directed by Marshall Bugeaud, who became the first Governor-General of Algeria, the conquest was violent and marked by a &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy designed to reduce the power of the native rulers, the Dey, including massacres, mass rapes and other atrocities. Between 500,000 and 1,000,000, from approximately 3 million Algerians, were killed in the first three decades of the conquest. French losses from 1830 to 1851 were 3,336 killed in action and 92,329 dying in hospital.

In 1834, Algeria became a French military colony. It was declared by the Constitution of 1848 to be an integral part of France and was divided into three departments: Alger, Oran and Constantine. Many French and other Europeans (Spanish, Italians, Maltese and others) later settled in Algeria.

Under the Second Empire (1852–1871), the &quot;Code de l&#x27;indigénat&quot; (Indigenous Code) was implemented by the &quot;sénatus-consulte&quot; of 14 July 1865. It allowed Muslims to apply for full French citizenship, a measure that few took since it involved renouncing the right to be governed by &quot;sharia&quot; law in personal matters and was widely considered to be apostasy. Its first article stipulated:

 The indigenous Muslim is French; however, he will continue to be subjected to Muslim law. He may be admitted to serve in the army (armée de terre) and the navy (armée de mer). He may be called to functions and civil employment in Algeria. He may, on his demand, be admitted to enjoy the rights of a French citizen; in this case, he is subjected to the political and civil laws of France.

Prior to 1870, fewer than 200 demands were registered by Muslims and 152 by Jewish Algerians. The 1865 decree was then modified by the 1870 Crémieux Decree, which granted French nationality to Jews living in one of the three Algerian departments. In 1881, the &quot;Code de l&#x27;Indigénat&quot; made the discrimination official by creating specific penalties for &quot;indigènes&quot; and organising the seizure or appropriation of their lands.

After World War II, equality of rights was proclaimed by the &quot;ordonnance&quot; of 7 March 1944 and later confirmed by the &quot;loi Lamine Guèye&quot; of 7 May 1946, which granted French citizenship to all subjects of France&#x27;s territories and overseas departments, and by the 1946 Constitution. The Law of 20 September 1947 granted French citizenship to all Algerian subjects, who were not required to renounce their Muslim personal status.

Algeria was unique to France because unlike all other overseas possessions acquired by France during the 19th century, Algeria was considered and legally classified to be an integral part of France.

=== Algerian Nationalism ===

Both Muslim and European Algerians took part in World War II and fought for France. Algerian Muslims served as &quot;tirailleurs&quot; (such regiments were created as early as 1842) and spahis; and French settlers as Zouaves or Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique. US President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s 1918 Fourteen Points had the fifth read: &quot;A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the government whose title is to be determined.&quot; Some Algerian intellectuals, dubbed &quot;oulémas&quot;, began to nurture the desire for independence or, at the very least, autonomy and self-rule.

Within that context, Khalid ibn Hashim, a grandson of Abd el-Kadir, spearheaded the resistance against the French in the first half of the 20th century and was a member of the directing committee of the French Communist Party. In 1926, he founded the &quot;Étoile Nord-Africaine&quot; (&quot;North African Star&quot;), to which Messali Hadj, also a member of the Communist Party and of its affiliated trade union, the Confédération générale du travail unitaire (CGTU), joined the following year.

The North African Star broke from the Communist Party in 1928, before being dissolved in 1929 at Paris&#x27;s demand. Amid growing discontent from the Algerian population, the Third Republic (1871–1940) acknowledged some demands, and the Popular Front initiated the Blum-Viollette proposal in 1936, which was supposed to enlighten the Indigenous Code by giving French citizenship to a small number of Muslims. The &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; (Algerians of European origin) violently demonstrated against it and the North African Party also opposed it, leading to its abandonment. The pro-independence party was dissolved in 1937, and its leaders were charged with the illegal reconstitution of a dissolved league, leading to Messali Hadj&#x27;s 1937 founding of the &quot;Parti du peuple algérien&quot; (Algerian People&#x27;s Party, PPA), which no longer espoused full independence but only extensive autonomy. This new party was dissolved in 1939. Under Vichy France, the French State attempted to abrogate the Crémieux Decree to suppress the Jews&#x27; French citizenship, but the measure was never implemented.

On the other hand, the nationalist leader Ferhat Abbas founded the Algerian Popular Union (&quot;Union populaire algérienne&quot;) in 1938. In 1943, Abbas wrote the Algerian People&#x27;s Manifesto (&quot;Manifeste du peuple algérien&quot;). Arrested after the Sétif and Guelma massacre of May 8, 1945, when the French Army and pieds-noirs mobs killed between 6,000 and 30,000 Algerians, Abbas founded the Democratic Union of the Algerian Manifesto (UDMA) in 1946 and was elected as a deputy. Founded in 1954, the National Liberation Front (FLN) created an armed wing, the &quot;Armée de Libération Nationale&quot; (National Liberation Army) to engage in an armed struggle against French authority. Many Algerian soldiers who served for the French Army in the First Indochina War had strong sympathy for the Vietnamese fighting against France and took up their experience to support the ALN.

France, which had just lost French Indochina, was determined not to lose the next colonial war, particularly in its oldest and nearest major colony, which was regarded as a part of Metropolitan France (rather than a colony), by French law.

== War chronology ==

=== Beginning of hostilities ===
In the early morning hours of 1 November 1954, FLN &quot;maquisards&quot; (guerrillas) attacked military and civilian targets throughout Algeria in what became known as the &quot;Toussaint Rouge&quot; (Red All-Saints&#x27; Day). From Cairo, the FLN broadcast the declaration of 1 November 1954 written by the journalist Mohamed Aïchaoui calling on Muslims in Algeria to join in a national struggle for the &quot;restoration of the Algerian state – sovereign, democratic and social – within the framework of the principles of Islam.&quot; It was the reaction of Premier Pierre Mendès France (Radical-Socialist Party), who only a few months before had completed the liquidation of France&#x27;s tete empire in Indochina, which set the tone of French policy for five years. He declared in the National Assembly, &quot;One does not compromise when it comes to defending the internal peace of the nation, the unity and integrity of the Republic. The Algerian departments are part of the French Republic. They have been French for a long time, and they are irrevocably French. ... Between them and metropolitan France there can be no conceivable secession.&quot; At first, and despite the Sétif massacre of 8 May 1945, and the pro-Independence struggle before World War II, most Algerians were in favor of a relative status-quo. While Messali Hadj had radicalized by forming the FLN, Ferhat Abbas maintained a more moderate, electoral strategy. Fewer than 500 &quot;fellaghas&quot; (pro-Independence fighters) could be counted at the beginning of the conflict. The Algerian population radicalized itself in particular because of the terrorist acts of French-sponsored &quot;Main Rouge&quot; (Red Hand) group, which targeted anti-colonialists in all of the Maghreb region (Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria), killing, for example, Tunisian activist Farhat Hached in 1952.

=== FLN ===


The FLN uprising presented nationalist groups with the question of whether to adopt armed revolt as the main course of action. During the first year of the war, Ferhat Abbas&#x27;s Democratic Union of the Algerian Manifesto (UDMA), the ulema, and the Algerian Communist Party (PCA) maintained a friendly neutrality toward the FLN. The communists, who had made no move to cooperate in the uprising at the start, later tried to infiltrate the FLN, but FLN leaders publicly repudiated the support of the party. In April 1956, Abbas flew to Cairo, where he formally joined the FLN. This action brought in many &quot;évolués&quot; who had supported the UDMA in the past. The AUMA also threw the full weight of its prestige behind the FLN. Bendjelloul and the pro-integrationist moderates had already abandoned their efforts to mediate between the French and the rebels.

After the collapse of the MTLD, the veteran nationalist Messali Hadj formed the leftist Mouvement National Algérien (MNA), which advocated a policy of violent revolution and total independence similar to that of the FLN, but aimed to compete with that organisation. The &quot;Armée de Libération Nationale&quot; (ALN), the military wing of the FLN, subsequently wiped out the MNA guerrilla operation in Algeria, and Messali Hadj&#x27;s movement lost what weak influence it had had there. However, the MNA retained the support of many Algerian workers in France through the &quot;Union Syndicale des Travailleurs Algériens&quot; (the Union of Algerian Workers). The FLN also established a strong organization in France to oppose the MNA. The &quot;Café wars&quot;, resulting in nearly 5,000 deaths, were waged in France between the two rebel groups throughout the years of the War of Independence.

On the political front, the FLN worked to persuade—and to coerce—the Algerian masses to support the aims of the independence movement through contributions. FLN-influenced labor unions, professional associations, and students&#x27; and women&#x27;s organizations were created to lead opinion in diverse segments of the population, but here too, violent coercion was widely used. Frantz Fanon, a psychiatrist from Martinique who became the FLN&#x27;s leading political theorist, provided a sophisticated intellectual justification for the use of violence in achieving national liberation. From Cairo, Ahmed Ben Bella ordered the liquidation of potential &quot;interlocuteurs valables&quot;, those independent representatives of the Muslim community acceptable to the French through whom a compromise or reforms within the system might be achieved.

As the FLN campaign of influence spread through the countryside, many European farmers in the interior (called &quot;Pieds-Noirs&quot;), many of whom lived on lands taken from Muslim communities during the nineteenth century, sold their holdings and sought refuge in Algiers and other Algerian cities. After a series of bloody, random massacres and bombings by Muslim Algerians in several towns and cities, the French &quot;Pieds-Noirs&quot; and urban French population began to demand that the French government engage in sterner countermeasures, including the proclamation of a state of emergency, capital punishment for political crimes, denunciation of all separatists, and most ominously, a call for &#x27;tit-for-tat&#x27; reprisal operations by police, military, and para-military forces. &quot;Colon&quot; vigilante units, whose unauthorized activities were conducted with the passive cooperation of police authorities, carried out &quot;ratonnades&quot; (literally, &quot;rat-hunts&quot;, &quot;raton&quot; being a racist term for denigrating Muslim Algerians) against suspected FLN members of the Muslim community.

By 1955, effective political action groups within the Algerian colonial community succeeded in convincing many of the Governors General sent by Paris that the military was not the way to resolve the conflict. A major success was the conversion of Jacques Soustelle, who went to Algeria as governor general in January 1955 determined to restore peace. Soustelle, a one-time leftist and by 1955 an ardent Gaullist, began an ambitious reform program (the Soustelle Plan) aimed at improving economic conditions among the Muslim population.

=== After the Philippeville massacre ===

The FLN adopted tactics similar to those of nationalist groups in Asia, and the French did not realize the seriousness of the challenge they faced until 1955, when the FLN moved into urbanized areas. An important watershed in the War of Independence was the massacre of Pieds-Noirs civilians by the FLN near the town of Philippeville (now known as Skikda) in August 1955. Before this operation, FLN policy was to attack only military and government-related targets. The commander of the Constantine &quot;wilaya&quot;/region, however, decided a drastic escalation was needed. The killing by the FLN and its supporters of 123 people, including 71 French, including old women and babies, shocked Jacques Soustelle into calling for more repressive measures against the rebels. The French authorities stated that 1,273 guerrillas died in what Soustelle admitted were &quot;severe&quot; reprisals. The FLN subsequently claimed that 12,000 Muslims were killed. Soustelle&#x27;s repression was an early cause of the Algerian population&#x27;s rallying to the FLN. After Philippeville, Soustelle declared sterner measures and an all-out war began. In 1956, demonstrations by French Algerians caused the French government to not make reforms.

Soustelle&#x27;s successor, Governor General Robert Lacoste, a socialist, abolished the Algerian Assembly. Lacoste saw the assembly, which was dominated by &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;, as hindering the work of his administration, and he undertook the rule of Algeria by decree. He favored stepping up French military operations and granted the army exceptional police powers—a concession of dubious legality under French law—to deal with the mounting political violence. At the same time, Lacoste proposed a new administrative structure to give Algeria some autonomy and a decentralized government. Whilst remaining an integral part of France, Algeria was to be divided into five districts, each of which would have a territorial assembly elected from a single slate of candidates. Until 1958, deputies representing Algerian districts were able to delay the passage of the measure by the National Assembly of France.

In August and September 1956, the leadership of the FLN guerrillas operating within Algeria (popularly known as &quot;internals&quot;) met to organize a formal policy-making body to synchronize the movement&#x27;s political and military activities. The highest authority of the FLN was vested in the thirty-four member National Council of the Algerian Revolution (Conseil National de la Révolution Algérienne, CNRA), within which the five-man Committee of Coordination and Enforcement (&quot;Comité de Coordination et d&#x27;Exécution&quot;, CCE) formed the executive. The leadership of the regular FLN forces based in Tunisia and Morocco (&quot;externals&quot;), including Ben Bella, knew the conference was taking place but by chance or design on the part of the &quot;internals&quot; were unable to attend.

In October 1956, the French Air Force intercepted a Moroccan DC-3 plane bound for Tunis, carrying Ahmed Ben Bella, Mohammed Boudiaf, Mohamed Khider and Hocine Aït Ahmed, and forced it to land in Algiers. Lacoste had the FLN external political leaders arrested and imprisoned for the duration of the war. This action caused the remaining rebel leaders to harden their stance.

France opposed Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s material and political assistance to the FLN, which some French analysts believed was the revolution&#x27;s main sustenance. This attitude was a factor in persuading France to participate in the November 1956 attempt to seize the Suez Canal during the Suez Crisis.

During 1957, support for the FLN weakened as the breach between the internals and externals widened. To halt the drift, the FLN expanded its executive committee to include Abbas, as well as imprisoned political leaders such as Ben Bella. It also convinced communist and Arab members of the United Nations (UN) to put diplomatic pressure on the French government to negotiate a cease-fire. In 1957, it became common knowledge in France that the French Army was routinely using torture to extract information from suspected FLN members. Hubert Beuve-Méry, the editor of &quot;Le Monde&quot;, declared in an edition on 13 March 1957: &quot;From now on, Frenchman must know that they don&#x27;t have the right to condemn in the same terms as ten years ago the destruction of Oradour and the torture by the Gestapo.&quot; Another case that attracted much media attention was the murder of Maurice Audin, a member of the outlawed Algerian Communist party, mathematics professor at the University of Algiers and a suspected FLN member whom the French Army arrested in June 1957. Audin was tortured and killed and his body was never found. As Audin was French rather than Algerian, his &quot;disappearance&quot; while in the custody of the French Army led to the case becoming a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; as his widow aided by the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet determinedly sought to have the men responsible for her husband&#x27;s death prosecuted.

Existentialist writer, philosopher and playwright Albert Camus, native of Algiers, tried unsuccessfully to persuade both sides to at least leave civilians alone, writing editorials against the use of torture in &quot;Combat&quot; newspaper. The FLN considered him a fool, and some &quot;Pieds-Noirs&quot; considered him a traitor. Nevertheless, in his speech when he received the Nobel Prize in Literature, Camus said that when faced with a radical choice he would eventually support his community. This statement made him lose his status among left-wing intellectuals; when he died in 1960 in a car crash, the official thesis of an ordinary accident (a quick open-and-shut case) left more than a few observers doubtful. His widow claimed that Camus, though discreet, was in fact an ardent supporter of French Algeria in the last years of his life.

=== Battle of Algiers ===

To increase international and domestic French attention to their struggle, the FLN decided to bring the conflict to the cities and to call a nationwide general strike and also to plant bombs in public places. The most notable instance was the Battle of Algiers, which began on September 30, 1956, when three women, including Djamila Bouhired and Zohra Drif, simultaneously placed bombs at three sites including the downtown office of Air France. The FLN carried out shootings and bombings in the spring of 1957, resulting in civilian casualties and a crushing response from the authorities.

General Jacques Massu was instructed to use whatever methods deemed necessary to restore order in the city and to find and eliminate terrorists. Using paratroopers, he broke the strike and, in the succeeding months, destroyed the FLN infrastructure in Algiers. But the FLN had succeeded in showing its ability to strike at the heart of French Algeria and to assemble a mass response to its demands among urban Muslims. The publicity given to the brutal methods used by the army to win the Battle of Algiers, including the use of torture, strong movement control and curfew called &quot;quadrillage&quot; and where all authority was under the military, created doubt in France about its role in Algeria. What was originally &quot;pacification&quot; or a &quot;public order operation&quot; had turned into a colonial war accompanied by torture.

=== Guerrilla war ===
During 1956 and 1957, the FLN successfully applied hit-and-run tactics in accordance with guerrilla warfare theory. Whilst some of this was aimed at military targets, a significant amount was invested in a terror campaign against those in any way deemed to support or encourage French authority. This resulted in acts of sadistic torture and brutal violence against all, including women and children. Specializing in ambushes and night raids and avoiding direct contact with superior French firepower, the internal forces targeted army patrols, military encampments, police posts, and colonial farms, mines, and factories, as well as transportation and communications facilities. Once an engagement was broken off, the guerrillas merged with the population in the countryside, in accordance with Mao&#x27;s theories.

Although successfully provoking fear and uncertainty within both communities in Algeria, the revolutionaries&#x27; coercive tactics suggested that they had not yet inspired the bulk of the Muslim people to revolt against French colonial rule. Gradually, however, the FLN gained control in certain sectors of the Aurès, the Kabylie, and other mountainous areas around Constantine and south of Algiers and Oran. In these places, the FLN established a simple but effective—although frequently temporary—military administration that was able to collect taxes and food and to recruit manpower. But it was never able to hold large, fixed positions.

The loss of competent field commanders both on the battlefield and through defections and political purges created difficulties for the FLN. Moreover, power struggles in the early years of the war split leadership in the wilayat, particularly in the Aurès. Some officers created their own fiefdoms, using units under their command to settle old scores and engage in private wars against military rivals within the FLN.

=== French counter-insurgency operations ===
Despite complaints from the military command in Algiers, the French government was reluctant for many months to admit that the Algerian situation was out of control and that what was viewed officially as a pacification operation had developed into a war. By 1956, there were more than 400,000 French troops in Algeria. Although the elite airborne infantry units of the Troupes coloniales and the Foreign Legion bore the brunt of offensive counterinsurgency combat operations, approximately 170,000 Muslim Algerians also served in the regular French army, most of them volunteers. France also sent air force and naval units to the Algerian theater, including helicopters. In addition to service as a flying ambulance and cargo carrier, French forces utilized the helicopter for the first time in a ground attack role in order to pursue and destroy fleeing FLN guerrilla units. The American military later used the same helicopter combat methods in the Vietnam War. The French also used napalm.

The French army resumed an important role in local Algerian administration through the Special Administration Section (&quot;Section Administrative Spécialisée&quot;, SAS), created in 1955. The SAS&#x27;s mission was to establish contact with the Muslim population and weaken nationalist influence in the rural areas by asserting the &quot;French presence&quot; there. SAS officers—called &quot;képis bleus&quot; (blue caps)—also recruited and trained bands of loyal Muslim irregulars, known as &quot;harkis&quot;. Armed with shotguns and using guerrilla tactics similar to those of the FLN, the &quot;harkis&quot;, who eventually numbered about 180,000 volunteers, more than the FLN activists, were an ideal instrument of counterinsurgency warfare.

&quot;Harkis&quot; were mostly used in conventional formations, either in all-Algerian units commanded by French officers or in mixed units. Other uses included platoon or smaller size units, attached to French battalions, in a similar way as the Kit Carson Scouts by the U.S. in Vietnam. A third use was an intelligence gathering role, with some reported minor pseudo-operations in support of their intelligence collection. U.S. military expert Lawrence E. Cline stated, &quot;The extent of these pseudo-operations appears to have been very limited both in time and scope. ... The most widespread use of pseudo type operations was during the &#x27;Battle of Algiers&#x27; in 1957. The principal French employer of covert agents in Algiers was the Fifth Bureau, the psychological warfare branch. &quot;The Fifth Bureau&quot; made extensive use of &#x27;turned&#x27; FLN members, one such network being run by Captain Paul-Alain Leger of the 10th Paras. &quot;Persuaded&quot; to work for the French forces included by the use of torture and threats against their family; these agents &quot;mingled with FLN cadres. They planted incriminating forged documents, spread false rumors of treachery and fomented distrust. ... As a frenzy of throat-cutting and disemboweling broke out among confused and suspicious FLN cadres, nationalist slaughtered nationalist from April to September 1957 and did France&#x27;s work for her.&quot; But this type of operation involved individual operatives rather than organized covert units.

One organized pseudo-guerrilla unit, however, was created in December 1956 by the French DST domestic intelligence agency. The &quot;Organization of the French Algerian Resistance&quot; (ORAF), a group of counter-terrorists had as its mission to carry out false flag terrorist attacks with the aim of quashing any hopes of political compromise. But it seemed that, as in Indochina, &quot;the French focused on developing native guerrilla groups that would fight against the FLN&quot;, one of whom fought in the Southern Atlas Mountains, equipped by the French Army.

The FLN also used pseudo-guerrilla strategies against the French Army on one occasion, with Force K, a group of 1,000 Algerians who volunteered to serve in Force K as guerrillas for the French. But most of these members were either already FLN members or were turned by the FLN once enlisted. Corpses of purported FLN members displayed by the unit were in fact those of dissidents and members of other Algerian groups killed by the FLN. The French Army finally discovered the war ruse and tried to hunt down Force K members. However, some 600 managed to escape and join the FLN with weapons and equipment.

Late in 1957, General Raoul Salan, commanding the French Army in Algeria, instituted a system of &quot;quadrillage&quot; (surveillance using a grid pattern), dividing the country into sectors, each permanently garrisoned by troops responsible for suppressing rebel operations in their assigned territory. Salan&#x27;s methods sharply reduced the instances of FLN terrorism but tied down a large number of troops in static defense. Salan also constructed a heavily patrolled system of barriers to limit infiltration from Tunisia and Morocco. The best known of these was the Morice Line (named for the French defense minister, André Morice), which consisted of an electrified fence, barbed wire, and mines over a 320-kilometer stretch of the Tunisian border. Despite ruthless clashes during the Battle of the borders, the ALN failed to penetrate these defence lines.
The French military command ruthlessly applied the principle of collective responsibility to villages suspected of sheltering, supplying, or in any way cooperating with the guerrillas. Villages that could not be reached by mobile units were subject to aerial bombardment. FLN guerrillas that fled to caves or other remote hiding places were tracked and hunted down. In one episode, FLN guerrillas who refused to surrender and withdraw from a cave complex were dealt with by French Foreign Legion Pioneer troops, who, lacking flamethrowers or explosives, simply bricked up each cave, leaving the residents to die of suffocation.

Finding it impossible to control all of Algeria&#x27;s remote farms and villages, the French government also initiated a program of concentrating large segments of the rural population, including whole villages, in camps under military supervision to prevent them from aiding the rebels. In the three years (1957–60) during which the &quot;regroupement&quot; program was followed, more than 2 million Algerians were removed from their villages, mostly in the mountainous areas, and resettled in the plains, where it was difficult to reestablish their previous economic and social systems. Living conditions in the fortified villages were poor. In hundreds of villages, orchards and croplands not already burned by French troops went to seed for lack of care. These population transfers effectively denied the use of remote villages to FLN guerrillas, who had used them as a source of rations and manpower, but also caused significant resentment on the part of the displaced villagers. Relocation&#x27;s social and economic disruption continued to be felt a generation later. At the same time, the French tried to gain support from the civilian population by providing money, jobs and housing to farmers

The French Army shifted its tactics at the end of 1958 from dependence on &quot;quadrillage&quot; to the use of mobile forces deployed on massive search-and-destroy missions against FLN strongholds. In 1959, Salan&#x27;s successor, General Maurice Challe, appeared to have suppressed major rebel resistance, but political developments had already overtaken the French Army&#x27;s successes.

=== Fall of the Fourth Republic ===
Recurrent cabinet crises focused attention on the inherent instability of the Fourth Republic and increased the misgivings of the army and of the pieds-noirs that the security of Algeria was being undermined by party politics. Army commanders chafed at what they took to be inadequate and incompetent political initiatives by the government in support of military efforts to end the rebellion. The feeling was widespread that another debacle like that of Indochina in 1954 was in the offing and that the government would order another precipitate pullout and sacrifice French honor to political expediency. Many saw in de Gaulle, who had not held office since 1946, the only public figure capable of rallying the nation and giving direction to the French government.

After his time as governor general, Soustelle returned to France to organize support for de Gaulle&#x27;s return to power, while retaining close ties to the army and the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;. By early 1958, he had organized a coup d&#x27;état, bringing together dissident army officers and &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; with sympathetic Gaullists. An army junta under General Massu seized power in Algiers on the night of May 13, thereafter known as the May 1958 crisis. General Salan assumed leadership of a Committee of Public Safety formed to replace the civil authority and pressed the junta&#x27;s demands that de Gaulle be named by French president René Coty to head a government of national unity invested with extraordinary powers to prevent the &quot;abandonment of Algeria&quot;.

On May 24, French paratroopers from the Algerian corps landed on Corsica, taking the French island in a bloodless action. Subsequently, preparations were made in Algeria for Operation Resurrection, which had as its objectives the seizure of Paris and the removal of the French government. Resurrection was to be implemented in the event of one of three following scenarios: Were de Gaulle not approved as leader of France by the parliament; were de Gaulle to ask for military assistance to take power; or if it seemed that communist forces were making any move to take power in France. De Gaulle was approved by the French parliament on May 29, by 329 votes against 224, 15 hours before the projected launch of Operation Resurrection. This indicated that the Fourth Republic by 1958 no longer had any support from the French Army in Algeria and was at its mercy even in civilian political matters. This decisive shift in the balance of power in civil-military relations in France in 1958, and the threat of force, was the primary factor in the return of de Gaulle to power in France.

=== De Gaulle ===

Many people, regardless of citizenship, greeted de Gaulle&#x27;s return to power as the breakthrough needed to end the hostilities. On his trip to Algeria on 4 June 1958, de Gaulle calculatedly made an ambiguous and broad emotional appeal to all the inhabitants, declaring, &quot;Je vous ai compris&quot; (&quot;I have understood you&quot;). De Gaulle raised the hopes of the &quot;pied-noir&quot; and the professional military, disaffected by the indecisiveness of previous governments, with his exclamation of &quot;&quot; (&quot;Long live French Algeria&quot;) to cheering crowds in Mostaganem. At the same time, he proposed economic, social, and political reforms to improve the situation of the Muslims. Nonetheless, de Gaulle later admitted to having harbored deep pessimism about the outcome of the Algerian situation even then. Meanwhile, he looked for a &quot;third force&quot; among the population of Algeria, uncontaminated by the FLN or the &quot;ultras&quot; (&quot;colon&quot; extremists), through whom a solution might be found.

De Gaulle immediately appointed a committee to draft a new constitution for France&#x27;s Fifth Republic, which would be declared early the next year, with which Algeria would be associated but of which it would not form an integral part. All Muslims, including women, were registered for the first time on electoral rolls to participate in a referendum to be held on the new constitution in September 1958.

De Gaulle&#x27;s initiative threatened the FLN with decreased support among Muslims. In reaction, the FLN set up the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic (Gouvernement Provisoire de la République Algérienne, GPRA), a government-in-exile headed by Abbas and based in Tunis. Before the referendum, Abbas lobbied for international support for the GPRA, which was quickly recognized by Morocco, Tunisia, China, and several other African, Arab, and Asian countries, but not by the Soviet Union.

In February 1959, de Gaulle was elected president of the new Fifth Republic. He visited Constantine in October to announce a program to end the war and create an Algeria closely linked to France. De Gaulle&#x27;s call on the rebel leaders to end hostilities and to participate in elections was met with adamant refusal. &quot;The problem of a cease-fire in Algeria is not simply a military problem&quot;, said the GPRA&#x27;s Abbas. &quot;It is essentially political, and negotiation must cover the whole question of Algeria.&quot; Secret discussions that had been underway were broken off.

From 1958 to 1959, the French army won military control in Algeria and was the closest it would be to victory. In late July 1959, during Operation Jumelles, Colonel Bigeard, whose elite paratrooper unit fought at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, told journalist Jean Lartéguy, (source)

During this period in France, however, popular opposition to the conflict was growing, notably in the French Communist Party, then one of the country&#x27;s strongest political forces, which supported the Algerian Revolution. Thousands of relatives of conscripts and reserve soldiers suffered loss and pain; revelations of torture and the indiscriminate brutality of the army against the Muslim population prompted widespread revulsion, and a significant constituency supported the principle of national liberation. By 1959, it was clear that the status quo was untenable and France could either grant Algeria independence or allow real equality with the Muslims. De Gaulle told an advisor: &quot;If we integrate them, if all the Arabs and the Berbers of Algeria were considered French, how could they be prevented from settling in France, where the living standard is so much higher? My village would no longer be called Colombey-les-Deux-Églises but Colombey-les-Deux-Mosquées&quot;.

International pressure was also building on France to grant Algeria independence. Since 1955, the UN General Assembly annually considered the Algerian question, and the FLN position was gaining support. France&#x27;s seeming intransigence in settling a colonial war that tied down half the manpower of its armed forces was also a source of concern to its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. In a 16 September 1959 statement, de Gaulle dramatically reversed his stand and uttered the words &quot;self-determination&quot; as the third and preferred solution, which he envisioned as leading to majority rule in an Algeria formally associated with France. In Tunis, Abbas acknowledged that de Gaulle&#x27;s statement might be accepted as a basis for settlement, but the French government refused to recognize the GPRA as the representative of Algeria&#x27;s Muslim community.

=== Week of barricades ===

Convinced that de Gaulle had betrayed them, some units of European volunteers (&quot;Unités Territoriales&quot;) in Algiers led by student leaders Pierre Lagaillarde and Jean-Jacques Susini, café owner Joseph Ortiz, and lawyer Jean-Baptiste Biaggi staged an insurrection in the Algerian capital starting on 24 January 1960, and known in France as (&quot;the week of barricades&quot;). The &quot;ultras&quot; incorrectly believed that they would be supported by General Massu. The insurrection order was given by Colonel Jean Garde of the Fifth Bureau. As the army, police, and supporters stood by, civilian &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; threw up barricades in the streets and seized government buildings. General Maurice Challe, responsible for the army in Algeria, declared Algiers under siege, but forbade the troops to fire on the insurgents. Nevertheless, six rioters were killed during shooting on Boulevard Laferrière.

In Paris on 29 January 1960, de Gaulle called on his ineffective army to remain loyal and rallied popular support for his Algerian policy in a televised address:

I took, in the name of France, the following decision—the Algerians will have the free choice of their destiny. When, in one way or another – by ceasefire or by complete crushing of the rebels – we will have put an end to the fighting, when, after a prolonged period of appeasement, the population will have become conscious of the stakes and, thanks to us, realised the necessary progress in political, economic, social, educational, and other domains. Then it will be the Algerians who will tell us what they want to be... Your French of Algeria, how can you listen to the liars and the conspirators who tell you that, if you grant free choice to the Algerians, France and de Gaulle want to abandon you, retreat from Algeria, and deliver you to the rebellion?... I say to all of our soldiers: your mission comprises neither equivocation nor interpretation. You have to liquidate the rebellious forces, which want to oust France from Algeria and impose on this country its dictatorship of misery and sterility... Finally, I address myself to France. Well, well, my dear and old country, here we face together, once again, a serious ordeal. In virtue of the mandate that the people have given me and of the national legitimacy, which I have embodied for 20 years, I ask everyone to support me whatever happens.

Most of the Army heeded his call, and the siege of Algiers ended on 1 February with Lagaillarde surrendering to General Challe&#x27;s command of the French Army in Algeria. The loss of many &quot;ultra&quot; leaders who were imprisoned or transferred to other areas did not deter the French Algeria militants. Sent to prison in Paris and then paroled, Lagaillarde fled to Spain. There, with another French army officer, Raoul Salan, who had entered clandestinely, and with Jean-Jacques Susini, he created the &quot;Organisation armée secrète&quot; (Secret Army Organization, OAS) on December 3, 1960, with the purpose of continuing the fight for French Algeria. Highly organized and well-armed, the OAS stepped up its terrorist activities, which were directed against both Algerians and pro-government French citizens, as the move toward negotiated settlement of the war and self-determination gained momentum. To the FLN rebellion against France were added civil wars between extremists in the two communities and between the &quot;ultras&quot; and the French government in Algeria.

Beside Pierre Lagaillarde, Jean-Baptiste Biaggi was also imprisoned, while Alain de Sérigny was arrested, and Joseph Ortiz&#x27;s FNF dissolved, as well as General Lionel Chassin&#x27;s MP-13. De Gaulle also modified the government, excluding Jacques Soustelle, believed to be too pro-French Algeria, and granting the Minister of Information to Louis Terrenoire, who quit RTF (French broadcasting TV). Pierre Messmer, who had been a member of the Foreign Legion, was named Minister of Defense, and dissolved the Fifth Bureau, the psychological warfare branch, which had ordered the rebellion. These units had theorized the principles of a counter-revolutionary war, including the use of torture. During the Indochina War (1947–54), officers such as Roger Trinquier and Lionel-Max Chassin were inspired by Mao Zedong&#x27;s strategic doctrine and acquired knowledge of convince the population to support the fight. The officers were initially trained in the &quot;Centre d&#x27;instruction et de préparation à la contre-guérilla&quot; (Arzew). Jacques Chaban-Delmas added to that the &quot;Centre d&#x27;entraînement à la guerre subversive Jeanne-d&#x27;Arc&quot; (Center of Training to Subversive War Joan of Arc) in Philippeville, Algeria, directed by Colonel Marcel Bigeard.
The French army officers&#x27; uprising was due to a perceived second betrayal by the government, the first having been Indochina (1947–1954). In some aspects the Dien Bien Phu garrison was sacrificed with no metropolitan support, order was given to commanding officer General de Castries to &quot;let the affair die of its own, in serenity&quot; (&quot;laissez mourir l&#x27;affaire d&#x27;elle même en sérénité&quot;).

The opposition of the UNEF student trade-union to the participation of conscripts in the war led to a secession in May 1960, with the creation of the &quot;Fédération des étudiants nationalistes&quot; (FEN, Federation of Nationalist Students) around Dominique Venner, a former member of Jeune Nation and of MP13, François d&#x27;Orcival and Alain de Benoist, who would theorize in the 1980s the &quot;New Right&quot; movement. The FEN then published the &quot;Manifeste de la classe 60&quot;.

A Front national pour l&#x27;Algérie française (FNAF, National Front for French Algeria) was created in June 1960 in Paris, gathering around de Gaulle&#x27;s former Secretary Jacques Soustelle, Claude Dumont, Georges Sauge, Yvon Chautard, Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour (who later competed in the 1965 presidential election), Jacques Isorni, Victor Barthélemy, François Brigneau and Jean-Marie Le Pen. Another &quot;ultra&quot; rebellion occurred in December 1960, which led de Gaulle to dissolve the FNAF.

After the publication of the &quot;Manifeste des 121&quot; against the use of torture and the war, the opponents to the war created the Rassemblement de la gauche démocratique (Assembly of the Democratic Left), which included the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) socialist party, the Radical-Socialist Party, Force ouvrière (FO) trade union, Confédération Française des Travailleurs Chrétiens trade-union, UNEF trade-union, etc., which supported de Gaulle against the &quot;ultras&quot;.

=== End of the war ===
De Gaulle convoked the first referendum on the self-determination of Algeria on 8 January 1961, which 75% of the voters (both in France and Algeria) approved and de Gaulle&#x27;s government began secret peace negotiations with the FLN. In the Algerian &quot;départements&quot; 69.51% voted in favor of self-determination. The talks that began in March 1961 broke down when de Gaulle insisted on including the much smaller &quot;Mouvement national algérien&quot; (MNA), which the FLN objected to. Since the FLN was the by far stronger movement with the MNA almost wiped out by this time, the French were finally forced to exclude the MNA from the talks after the FLN walked out for a time.

The generals&#x27; putsch in April 1961, aimed at canceling the government&#x27;s negotiations with the FLN, marked the turning point in the official attitude toward the Algerian war. Leading the coup attempt to depose de Gaulle were General Raoul Salan, General André Zeller, General Maurice Challe, and General Edmond Jouhaud. Only the paratroop divisions and the Foreign Legion joined the coup, while the Air Force, Navy and most of the Army stayed loyal to General de Gaulle, but at one moment de Gaulle went on French television to ask for public support with the normally lofty de Gaulle saying &quot;Frenchmen, Frenchwomen, help me!&quot; De Gaulle was now prepared to abandon the &quot;Pied-Noirs&quot;, which no previous French government was willing to do. The army had been discredited by the putsch and kept a low profile politically throughout the rest of France&#x27;s involvement with Algeria. The OAS was to be the main standard bearer for the &quot;Pied-Noirs&quot; for the rest of the war.

Talks with the FLN reopened at Évian in May 1961; after several false starts, the French government decreed that a ceasefire would take effect on March 18, 1962. A major difficulty at the talks was de Gaulle&#x27;s decision to grant independence only to the coastal regions of Algeria, where the bulk of the population lived, while hanging onto the Sahara, which happened to be rich in oil and gas, while the FLN claimed all of Algeria. During the talks, the &quot;Pied-Noirs&quot; and Muslim communities engaged in a low level civil war with bombings, shootings, throat-cutting and assassinations being the preferred methods. The Canadian historian John Cairns wrote at times it seemed like both communities were &quot;going berserk&quot; as everyday &quot;murder was indiscriminate&quot;.

On 29 June 1961, de Gaulle announced on TV that fighting was &quot;virtually finished&quot; and afterwards there were no major battles between the French Army and the FLN. During the summer of 1961 the OAS and the FLN engaged in a civil war, in which the greater numbers of the Muslims predominated. To pressure de Gaulle to give up claims to the Sahara, the FLN organized demonstrations by Algerians living in France during the fall of 1961, which the French police crushed. At a demonstration on 17 October 1961, Maurice Papon ordered an attack that became a massacre of Algerians. On 10 January 1962, the FLN started a &quot;general offensive&quot; to pressure the OAS in Algeria, staging a series of attacks on the &quot;Pied-Noirs&quot; communities. On 7 February 1962, the OAS attempted to assassinate Culture Minister André Malraux with a bomb in his apartment building; it failed to kill him, but left a four-year girl in the adjoining apartment blinded by shrapnel. The incident did much to turn French opinion against the OAS.

On 20 February 1962, a peace accord was reached granting independence to all of Algeria. In their final form, the Évian Accords allowed the &quot;Pied-Noirs&quot; equal legal protection with Algerians over a three-year period. These rights included respect for property, participation in public affairs, and a full range of civil and cultural rights. At the end of that period, however, all Algerian residents would be obliged to become Algerian citizens or be classified as aliens with the attendant loss of rights. The agreement also allowed France to establish military bases in Algeria even after independence (including the nuclear test site of Regghane, the naval base of Mers-el-Kebir and the air base of Bou Sfer) and to have privileges vis-à-vis Algerian oil.

The OAS started a campaign of spectacular terrorist attacks to sabotage the Évian Accords, hoping that if enough Muslims were killed, a general pogrom against the &quot;Pied-Noirs&quot; would break out, leading the French Army to turn its guns against the government. Despite ample provocation with OAS lobbing mortar shells into the &quot;casbah&quot; of Algiers, the FLN gave orders for no retaliatory attacks. In the spring of 1962, the OAS turned to bank robbery to finance its war against both the FLN and the French state, and bombed special units sent by Paris to hunt them down. Only eighty deputies voted against the Évian Accords in the National Assembly. Cairns wrote that the fulminations of Jean-Marie Le Pen against de Gaulle were only &quot;...the traditional verbal excesses of third-rate firebrands without a substantial following and without a constructive idea&quot;.

Following the cease fire, tensions developed between the &quot;Pied-Noirs&quot; community and their former protectors in the French Army. An OAS ambush of French troops on 20 March was followed by 20,000 gendarmes and soldiers being ordered to occupy the predominantly-&quot;Pied-Noir&quot; district of Bab El Oued in Algiers. A week later, French soldiers from the 4th Tirailleur Regiment (an 80% Muslim unit with French officers) opened fire on a crowd of &quot;Pied-Noir&quot; demonstrators in Algiers, killing between 50 and 80 civilians. Total casualties in these three incidents were 326 killed and wounded amongst the &quot;Pied-Noirs&quot; and 110 French military personnel dead or injured. A journalist who saw the massacre on 26 March 1962, Henry Tanner, described the scene: &quot;When the shooting stopped, the street was littered with bodies, of women, as well as men, dead, wounded or dying. The black pavement looked grey, as if bleached by fire. Crumpled French flags were lying in pools of blood. Shattered glass and spent cartridges were everywhere&quot;. A number of shocked &quot;Pied-Noir&quot; screamed that they were not French anymore. One woman screamed &quot;Stop firing! My God, we&#x27;re French...&quot; before she was shot down. The massacre served to greatly embitter the &quot;Pied-Noir&quot; community and led to a massive surge of support for the OAS.

In the second referendum on the independence of Algeria, held in April 1962, 91 percent of the French electorate approved the Evian Accords. On 1 July 1962, some 6 million of a total Algerian electorate of 6.5 million cast their ballots. The vote was nearly unanimous, with 5,992,115 votes for independence, 16,534 against, with most &quot;Pied-Noirs&quot; and Harkis either having fled or abstaining. De Gaulle pronounced Algeria an independent country on 3 July. The Provisional Executive, however, proclaimed 5 July, the 132nd anniversary of the French entry into Algeria, as the day of national independence.

During the three months between the cease-fire and the French referendum on Algeria, the OAS unleashed a new campaign. The OAS sought to provoke a major breach in the ceasefire by the FLN, but the attacks now were aimed also against the French army and police enforcing the accords as well as against Muslims. It was the most wanton carnage that Algeria had witnessed in eight years of savage warfare. OAS operatives set off an average of 120 bombs per day in March, with targets including hospitals and schools. On June 7, 1962 the University of Algiers Library was burned by the OAS. This cultural devastation was commemorated by Muslim countries issuing postage stamps commemorating the tragic event. These included Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Yemen.

During the summer of 1962, a rush of &quot;Pied-Noirs&quot; fled to France. Within a year, 1.4 million refugees, including almost the entire Jewish community, had joined the exodus. Despite the declaration of independence on 5 July 1962, the last French forces did not leave the naval base of Mers El Kébir until 1967. (The Evian Accords had permitted France to maintain its military presence for fifteen years, so the withdrawal in 1967 was significantly ahead of schedule.) Cairns writing from Paris in 1962 declared: &quot;In some ways the last year has been the worse. Tension has never been higher. Disenchantment in France at least has never been greater. The mindless cruelty of it all has never been more absurd and savage. This last year, stretching from the hopeful spring of 1961 to the ceasefire of 18 March 1962 spanned a season of shadow boxing, false threats, capitulation and murderous hysteria. French Algeria died badly. Its agony was marked by panic and brutality as ugly as the record of European imperialism could show. In the spring of 1962 the unhappy corpse of empire still shuddered and lashed out and stained itself in fratricide. The whole episode of its death, measured at least seven and half years, constituted perhaps the most pathetic and sordid event in the entire history of colonialism. It is hard to see how anybody of importance in the tangled web of the conflict came out looking well. Nobody won the conflict, nobody dominated it.&quot;

== Strategy of internationalisation of the Algerian War led by the FLN ==
At the beginning of the war, on the Algerian side, it was necessary to compensate for military weakness with political and diplomatic struggle. In the asymmetric conflict between France and the FLN at this time, victory seemed extremely difficult.

The Algerian revolution began with the insurrection of November 1, when the FLN organized a series of attacks against the French army and military infrastructure, and published a statement calling on Algerians to get involved in the revolution. This initial campaign had limited impact: the events remained largely unreported, especially by the French press (only two newspaper columns in &quot;Le Monde&quot; and one in &quot;l&#x27;Express&quot;), and the insurrection all but subsided. Nevertheless, François Mitterrand, the French Minister of the Interior, sent 600 soldiers to Algeria.

Furthermore, the FLN was weak militarily at the beginning of the war. It was created in 1954 and had few members, and its ally the ALN was also underdeveloped, having only 3,000 men badly equipped and trained, unable to compete with the French army. The nationalist forces also suffered from internal divisions.

As proclaimed in the statement of 1954, the FLN developed a strategy to avoid large-scale warfare and internationalize the conflict, appealing politically and diplomatically to influence French and world opinion. This political aspect would reinforce the legitimacy of the FLN in Algeria, which was all the more necessary since Algeria, unlike other colonies, had been formally incorporated as a part of metropolitan France. The French counter-strategy aimed to keep the conflict internal and strictly French to maintain its image abroad. The FLN succeeded, and the conflict rapidly became international, embroiled with the tensions of the Cold War and the emergence of the Third World.

Firstly, the FLN exploited the tensions between the American-led Western Bloc and the Soviet-led Communist bloc. FLN sought material support from the Communists, goading the Americans to support Algerian independence to keep the country on the western side. Furthermore, the FLN used the tensions within each bloc, including between France and the US and between the USSR and Mao&#x27;s China. The US, which generally opposed colonisation, had every interest in pushing France to give Algeria its independence.

Secondly, the FLN could count on Third World support. After World War II, many new states were created in the wave of decolonization: in 1945 there were 51 states in the UN, but by 1965 there were 117. This upturned the balance of power in the UN, with the recently decolonized countries now a majority with great influence. Most of the new states were part of the Third-World movement, proclaiming a third, non-aligned path in a bipolar world, and opposing colonialism in favor of national renewal and modernization. They felt concerned in the Algerian conflict and supported the FLN on the international stage. For example, a few days after the first insurrection in 1954, Radio Yugoslavia (Third-Worldist) begun to vocally support the struggle of Algeria; the 1955 Bandung conference internationally recognized the FLN as representing Algeria; and Third-World countries brought up the Algerian conflict at the UN general assembly. The French government grew more and more isolated.

After the Battle of Algiers greatly weakened the FLN, it was forced to accept more direct support from abroad. Financial and military support from China helped to rebuild the ALN to 20 000 men. The USSR competed with China, and Khrushchev intensified moral support for the Algerian rebellion, which in turn pushed the USA to react. In 1958, the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic (PGAR) was created, naming official representatives to negotiate with France. Tense negotiations lasted three years, eventually turning to Algeria&#x27;s advantage. The PGAR was supported by the Third World and the communist bloc, while France had few allies. Under pressure from the UN, the USA, and a war-weary public, France eventually conceded in the Evian agreements. According to Matthew Connelly, this strategy of internationalization became a model for other revolutionary groups such as the Palestine Liberation Organization of Yasser Arafat, and the African National Congress of Nelson Mandela.

== Role of women ==
Women participated in a variety of roles during the Algerian War. The majority of Muslim women who became active participants did so on the side of the National Liberation Front (FLN). The French included some women, both Muslim and French, in their war effort, but they were not as fully integrated, nor were they charged with the same breadth of tasks as the women on the Algerian side. The total number of women involved in the conflict, as determined by post-war veteran registration, is numbered at 11,000, but it is possible that this number was significantly higher due to underreporting.

Urban and rural women&#x27;s experiences in the revolution differed greatly. Urban women, who constituted about twenty percent of the overall force, had received some kind of education and usually chose to enter on the side of the FLN of their own accord. Largely illiterate rural women, on the other hand, the remaining eighty percent, due to their geographic location in respect to the operations of FLN often became involved in the conflict as a result of proximity paired with force.

Women operated in a number of different areas during the course of the rebellion. &quot;Women participated actively as combatants, spies, fundraisers, as well as nurses, launderers, and cooks&quot;, &quot;women assisted the male fighting forces in areas like transportation, communication and administration&quot; the range of involvement by a woman could include both combatant and non-combatant roles. Eveline Safir Lavalette was a notable contributor to the Revolution as a distributor of pamphlets for the FLN&#x27;s underground newspaper. While most women&#x27;s tasks were non-combatant, their less frequent, violent acts were more noticed. The reality was that &quot;rural women in maquis rural areas support networks&quot; contained the overwhelming majority of those who participated; female combatants were in the minority.

Perhaps the most famous incident involving Algerian women revolutionaries was the Milk Bar Café bombing of 1956, when Zohra Drif and Yacef Saâdi planted three bombs: one in the Air France office in the Mauritania building in Algiers, which did not explode, one in a cafeteria on the Rue Michelet, and another at the Milk Bar Café, which killed 3 young women and injured multiple adults and children. Algerian Communist Party-member Raymonde Peschard was initially accused of being an accomplice to the bombing and was forced to flee from the colonial authorities. In September 1957, though, Drif and Saâdi were arrested and sentenced to twenty years hard labor in the Barbarossa prison. Drif was pardoned by Charles de Gaulle on the anniversary of Algerian independence in 1962.

== Exodus of the Pieds-Noirs and Harkis ==
&quot;Pieds-Noirs&quot; (including indigenous Mizrachi and Sephardi Jews) and &quot;Harkis&quot; accounted for 13% of the total population of Algeria in 1962. For the sake of clarity, each group&#x27;s exodus is described separately here, although their fate shared many common elements.

=== Pieds-noirs ===

&quot;Pied-noir&quot; (literally &quot;black foot&quot;) is a term used to name the European-descended population (mostly Catholic), who had resided in Algeria for generations; it is sometimes used to include the indigenous Maghrebi Jewish population as well, which likewise emigrated after 1962. Europeans arrived in Algeria as immigrants from all over the western Mediterranean (particularly France, Spain, Italy and Malta), starting in 1830. The Jews arrived in several waves, some coming as early as 600 BC and during the Roman period, known as the Maghrebi Jews or Berber Jews. The Maghrebi Jewish population was outnumbered by the Sephardic Jews, who were driven out of Spain in 1492, and was further strengthened by Marrano refugees from the Spanish Inquisition through the 16th century. Algerian Jews largely embraced French citizenship after the décret Crémieux in 1871.

In 1959, the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; numbered 1,025,000 (85% of European Christian descent, and 15% were made up of the indigenous Algerian population of Maghrebi and Sephardi Jewish descent), and accounted for 10.4% of the total population of Algeria. In just a few months in 1962, 900,000 of them fled, the first third prior to the referendum, in the largest relocation of population to Europe since the Second World War. A motto used in the FLN message to the pieds-noirs was &quot;a suitcase or a coffin&quot; (&quot;La valise ou le cercueil&quot;), repurposing a slogan first coined years earlier by &quot;pied-noir&quot; &quot;ultras&quot; when rallying the European community to their hardcore line.

The French government claimed not to have anticipated such a massive exodus; it estimated that a maximum of 250–300,000 might enter metropolitan France temporarily. Nothing was planned for their move to France, and many had to sleep in the streets or abandoned farms on their arrival. A minority of departing &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;, including soldiers, destroyed their property before departure, to protest and as a desperate symbolic attempt to leave no trace of over a century of European presence, but the vast majority of their goods and houses were left intact and abandoned. A large number of panicked people camped for weeks on the docks of Algerian harbors, waiting for a space on a boat to France. About 100,000 &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; chose to remain, but most of those gradually left in the 1960s and 1970s, primarily due to residual hostility against them, including machine-gunning of public places in Oran.

=== Harkis ===

The so-called &quot;Harkis&quot;, from the Algerian-Arabic dialect word &quot;harki&quot; (soldier), were indigenous Muslim Algerians (as opposed to European-descended Catholics or indigenous Algerian Maghrebi Jews) who fought as auxiliaries on the French side. Some of these were veterans of the Free French Forces who participated in the liberation of France during World War II or in the Indochina War. The term also came to include civilian indigenous Algerians who supported a French Algeria. According to French government figures, there were 236,000 Algerian Muslims serving in the French Army in 1962 (four times more than in the FLN), either in regular units (Spahis and Tirailleurs) or as irregulars (harkis and moghaznis). Some estimates suggest that, with their families, the indigenous Muslim loyalists may have numbered as many as 1 million.

In 1962, around 90,000 &quot;Harkis&quot; took refuge in France, despite French government policy against this. Pierre Messmer, Minister of the Armies, and Louis Joxe, Minister for Algerian Affairs, gave orders to this effect. The &quot;Harkis&quot; were seen as traitors by many Algerians, and many of those who stayed behind suffered severe reprisals after independence. French historians estimate that somewhere between 50,000 and 150,000 &quot;Harkis&quot; and members of their families were killed by the FLN or by lynch mobs in Algeria, often in atrocious circumstances or after torture. The abandonment of the &quot;Harkis&quot; both the lack of recognition of those who died defending French Algeria and the neglect of those who escaped to France, remains an issue that France has not fully resolved—although the government of Jacques Chirac made efforts to recognize the suffering of these former allies.

== Death toll ==

Death toll estimates vary. Algerian historians and the FLN estimated that nearly eight years of revolution caused 1.5 million Algerian deaths. Some other French and Algerian sources later put the figure at approximately 960,000 dead, while French officials and historians estimated it at around 350,000, but this was regarded by many as an underestimate. French military authorities listed their losses at nearly 17,456 dead (5,966 from accidents) and 65,000 wounded. European-descended civilian casualties exceeded 10,000 (including 3,000 dead) in 42,000 recorded violent incidents. According to French official figures during the war, the army, security forces and militias killed 141,000 presumed rebel combatants. But it is still unclear whether this includes some civilians.

More than 12,000 Algerians died in internal FLN purges during the war. In France, an additional 5,000 died in the &quot;café wars&quot; between the FLN and rival Algerian groups. French sources also estimated that 70,000 Muslim civilians were killed, or abducted and presumed killed, by the FLN.

Martin Evans citing Gilert Meyinier implies at least 55,000 to up to 60,000 non-Harki Algerian civilians were killed during the conflict without specifying which side killed them. Rudolph Rummel attributes at least 100,000 deaths in what he calls democide to French repression; and estimates an additional to 50,000 to 150,000 democides committed by Algerian independence fighters. 6,000 to 20,000 Algerians were killed in the 1945 Sétif and Guelma massacre which is considered by some historians to have been a cause of the war.

Horne estimated Algerian casualties during the span of eight years to be around 1 million. Uncounted thousands of Muslim civilians died in French Army ratissages, bombing raids, or vigilante reprisals. The war uprooted more than 2 million Algerians, who were forced to relocate in French camps or to flee into the Algerian hinterland, where many thousands died of starvation, disease, and exposure. One source estimates 300,000 Algerians civilians perished of starvation, depredation, and disease inside and outside the camps.

In addition, large numbers of Harkis were murdered when the FLN settled accounts after independence, with 30,000 to 150,000 killed in Algeria in .

== Lasting effects in Algerian politics ==
After Algeria&#x27;s independence was recognised, Ahmed Ben Bella quickly became more popular and thereby more powerful. In June 1962, he challenged the leadership of Premier Benyoucef Ben Khedda; this led to several disputes among his rivals in the FLN, which were quickly suppressed by Ben Bella&#x27;s rapidly growing support, most notably within the armed forces. By September, Bella was in &quot;de facto&quot; control of Algeria and was elected premier in a one-sided election on September 20, and was recognised by the U.S. on September 29. Algeria was admitted as the 109th member of the United Nations on October 8, 1962. Afterward, Ben Bella declared that Algeria would follow a neutral course in world politics; within a week he met with U.S. President John F. Kennedy, requesting more aid for Algeria with Fidel Castro and expressed approval of Castro&#x27;s demands for the abandonment of Guantanamo Bay. Bella returned to Algeria and requested that France withdraw from its bases there. In November, his government banned political parties, providing that the FLN would be the only party allowed to function overtly. Shortly thereafter, in 1965, Bella was deposed and placed under house arrest (and later exiled) by Houari Boumédiènne, who served as president until his death in 1978. Algeria remained stable, though in a one-party state, until a violent civil war broke out in the 1990s.

For Algerians of many political factions, the legacy of their War of Independence was a legitimization or even sanctification of the unrestricted use of force in achieving a goal deemed to be justified. Once invoked against foreign colonialists, the same principle could also be turned with relative ease against fellow Algerians. The FLN&#x27;s struggle to overthrow colonial rule and the ruthlessness exhibited by both sides in that struggle were mirrored 30 years later by the passion, determination, and brutality of the conflict between the FLN government and the Islamist opposition. The American journalist Adam Shatz wrote that much of the same methods employed by the FLN against the French such as &quot;the militarization of politics, the use of Islam as a rallying cry, the exaltation of jihad&quot; to create an essentially secular state in 1962, were used by Islamic fundamentalists in their efforts to overthrow the FLN regime in the 1990s.

== Atrocities and war crimes ==
=== French atrocities and use of torture ===
Massacres and torture were frequent from the beginning of the colonization of Algeria, which started in 1830. Atrocities committed against Algerians by the French army during the war included indiscriminate shootings into civilian crowds (such as during the Paris massacre of 1961), execution of civilians when rebel attacks occurred, bombings of villages suspected of helping the FLN, rape, disembowelment of pregnant women, imprisonment without food in small cells (some of which were small enough to impede lying down), throwing detainees from helicopters and into the sea with concrete on their feet, and burying people alive. Torture methods included beatings, mutilations, burning, hanging by the feet or hands, torture by electroshock, waterboarding, sleep deprivation and sexual assaults.

During the war, the French military relocated entire villages to (regrouping centres), which were built for forcibly displaced civilian populations, in order to separate them from FLN guerrilla combatants. Over 8,000 villages were destroyed. Over 2 million Algerians were resettled in regrouping internment camps, with some being forced into labour.

A notable instance of rape was that of Djamila Boupacha, a 23-years old Algerian woman who was arrested in 1960, accused of attempting to bomb a cafe in Algiers. Her confession was obtained through torture and rape. Her subsequent trial affected French public opinion about the French army&#x27;s methods in Algeria after publicity of the case by Simone de Beauvoir and Gisèle Halimi.

Torture was also used by both sides during the First Indochina War (1946–54). Claude Bourdet denounced acts of torture in Algeria on 6 December 1951, in the magazine &quot;L&#x27;Observateur&quot;, rhetorically asking, &quot;Is there a Gestapo in Algeria?&quot;. D. Huf, in his seminal work on the subject, argued that the use of torture was one of the major factors in developing French opposition to the war. Huf argued, &quot;Such tactics sat uncomfortably with France&#x27;s revolutionary history, and brought unbearable comparisons with Nazi Germany. The French national psyche would not tolerate any parallels between their experiences of occupation and their colonial mastery of Algeria.&quot; General Paul Aussaresses admitted in 2000 that systematic torture techniques were used during the war and justified them. He also recognized the assassination of lawyer Ali Boumendjel and the head of the FLN in Algiers, Larbi Ben M&#x27;Hidi, which had been disguised as suicides. Marcel Bigeard, who called FLN activists &quot;savages&quot;, claimed torture was a &quot;necessary evil&quot;. To the contrary, General Jacques Massu denounced it, following Aussaresses&#x27;s revelations and, before his death, pronounced himself in favor of an official condemnation of the use of torture during the war.

Bigeard&#x27;s justification of torture has been criticized by Joseph Doré, archbishop of Strasbourg, Marc Lienhard, president of the Lutheran Church of Augsbourg Confession in Alsace-Lorraine, and others. In June 2000, Bigeard declared that he was based in Sidi Ferruch, a torture center where Algerians were murdered. Bigeard qualified Louisette Ighilahriz&#x27;s revelations, published in the &quot;Le Monde&quot; newspaper on June 20, 2000, as &quot;lies&quot;. An ALN activist, Louisette Ighilahriz had been tortured by General Massu. However, since General Massu&#x27;s revelations, Bigeard has admitted the use of torture, although he denies having personally used it, and has declared, &quot;You are striking the heart of an 84-year-old man.&quot; Bigeard also recognized that Larbi Ben M&#x27;Hidi was assassinated and that his death was disguised as a suicide.

In 2018 France officially admitted that torture was systematic and routine.

=== Algerian use of terror ===
Specializing in ambushes and night raids to avoid direct contact with superior French firepower, the internal forces targeted army patrols, military encampments, police posts, and colonial farms, mines, and factories, as well as transportation and communications facilities. At first, the FLN targeted only Muslim officials of the colonial regime; later, they coerced, maimed, or killed village elders, government employees, and even simple peasants who refused to support them. Throat slitting and decapitation were commonly used by the FLN as mechanisms of terror. Some other atrocities were committed by the more militant sections of the FLN as collective reprisals against the pieds-noirs population in response to French repression. The more extreme cases occurred in places like the town of Al-Halia, where some European residents were raped and disemboweled, while children had been murdered by slitting their throats or banging their heads against walls.

During the first two and a half years of the conflict, the guerrillas killed an estimated 6,352 Muslim and 1,035 non-Muslim civilians.

== Historiography ==

Although the opening of the archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after a 30-year lock-up enabled some new historical research on the war, including Jean-Charles Jauffret&#x27;s book, &quot;La Guerre d&#x27;Algérie par les documents&quot; (The Algerian War According to the Documents), many remain inaccessible. The recognition in 1999 by the National Assembly permitted the Algerian War to enter the syllabi of French schools. In France, the war was known as &quot;la guerre sans nom&quot; (&quot;the war without a name&quot;) while it was being fought. The government variously described the war as the &quot;Algerian events&quot;, the &quot;Algerian problem&quot; and the &quot;Algerian dispute&quot;; the mission of the French Army was &quot;ensuring security&quot;, &quot;maintaining order&quot; and &quot;pacification&quot; but was never described as fighting a war. The FLN were referred to as &quot;criminals&quot;, &quot;bandits&quot;, &quot;outlaws&quot;, &quot;terrorists&quot; and &quot;fellagha&quot; (a derogatory Arabic word meaning &quot;road-cutters&quot; but often mistranslated as &quot;throat-cutters&quot; in reference to the FLN&#x27;s frequent method of execution, which made people wear the &quot;Kabylian smile&quot; by cutting their throats, pulling their tongues out, and leaving them to bleed to death). After reports of the widespread use of torture by French forces started to reach France in 1956–57, the war become commonly known as &quot;la sale guerre&quot; (&quot;the dirty war&quot;), a term that is still used today and reflects the very negative memory of the war in France.

=== Lack of commemoration ===
As the war was officially a &quot;police action&quot;, no monuments were built for decades to honour the about 25,000 French soldiers killed in the war, and the Defense Ministry refused to classify veterans as veterans until the 1970s. When a monument to the Unknown Soldier of the Algerian War was erected in 1977, French President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, in his dedication speech, refused to use the words war or Algeria but instead used the phrase &quot;the unknown soldier of North Africa&quot;. A national monument to the French war dead was not built until 1996 and, even then spoke only of those killed fighting in &quot;Afrique du nord&quot; and was located in a decrepit area of Paris rarely visited by tourists, as if to hide the monument. Further adding to the silence were the vested interests of French politicians. François Mitterrand, the French president 1981 to 1995, had been the Interior Minister from 1954 to 1955 and the Justice Minister from 1955 to 1957, when he had been deeply involved in the repression of the FLN, and it was only after Mitterrand&#x27;s death in 1996, that his French Socialist Party started to become willing to talk about the war and, even then, remained very guarded about his role. Likewise, de Gaulle had promised in the Évian Agreements that the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; could remain in Algeria, but after independence, the FLN freely violated the accords and led to the entire &quot;pied-noir&quot; population fleeing to France, usually with only the clothes they were wearing, as they had lost everything they had in Algeria, a circumstance further embarrassing the defeated nation.

=== English-language historiography ===

One of the first books about the war in English, &quot;A Scattering of Dust&quot; by the American journalist Herb Greer in 1962, depicted very favorably the Algerian struggle for independence. Most work in English in the 1960s and 1970s were the work of left-wing scholars, who were focused on explaining the FLN as a part of a generational change in Algerian nationalism and depicted the war as a reaction to intolerable oppression and/or an attempt by the peasants, impoverished by French policies, to improve their lot. One of the few military histories of the war was &quot;The Algerian Insurrection&quot;, by the retired British Army officer Edgar O&#x27;Ballance, who wrote with unabashed admiration for French high command during the war and saw the FLN as a terrorist group. O&#x27;Ballance concluded that the tactics which won the war militarily for the French lost the war for them politically.

In 1977, the British journalist Alistair Horne published &quot;A Savage War of Peace&quot;, regarded by some authors as the leading book written on the subject in English, though written from a French, rather than Algerian perspective. Fifteen years after the end of the war, Horne was accused of not being concerned about &quot;right or wrong&quot; but rather about &quot;cause and effect&quot;. Living in Paris at the time of the war, Horne had condemned French intervention during the Suez Crisis and the French bombing of the Tunisian village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef in 1958. He&#x27;d argued that the &quot;inflexibility&quot; of the FLN had won Algeria independence, creating a sense of Algerian national identity, and leading the Front to rule over authoritarian but &quot;progressive&quot; FLN regime.

In a 1977 column published in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; reviewing the book &quot;A Savage War of Peace&quot;, Iraqi-born British historian Elie Kedourie attacked Horne as an &quot;apologist for terrorism&quot; and accused him of engaging in the &quot;cosy pieties&quot; of &quot;bien-pensants&quot;. Kedorie condemned the Western intellectuals who excuse terrorism when committed by Third World revolutionaries. Kedourie claimed that far from a mass movement, the FLN were a &quot;small gang&quot; of &quot;murderous intellectuals&quot; who used brutal, terrorist tactics against the French citizens and military, and against any Muslim loyal to the French. He further claimed that the Front had been beaten by 1959. Kedourie charged that de Gaulle had cynically sacrificed the &quot;colons&quot; and the &quot;harkis&quot;, as he had chosen to disregard his constitutional oath as president to protect all Frenchmen and ensure that &quot;the French withdrew and handed over power to the only organized body of armed men who were on the scene – a civilized government, thus, acting for all the world like the votary of some Mao or Ho, in the barbarous belief that legitimacy comes from the power of the gun&quot;.

In 1992, American historian John Ruedy, the focus of whose research was the history of the Maghreb and French colonialism in Algeria, published &quot;Modern Algeria: Origins and Development of a Nation&quot;. Ruedy wrote that under French rule the traditional social structure had been so completely destroyed that when the FLN launched its independence struggle in 1954, the only way of asserting one&#x27;s interests was through &quot;the law of the gun&quot;, which explains why the FLN was so violent not only in regards to its enemies but also within the movement. The FLN, thus, according to Ruedy, formed the basis of an &quot;alternative political culture&quot;, based on &quot;brute force&quot; that has persisted ever since.

===In film===

Before the war, Algeria was a popular setting for French films; the British professor Leslie Hill having written: &quot;In the late 1920s and 1930s, for instance, North Africa provided film-makers in France with a ready fund of familiar images of the exotics, mingling, for instance, the languid eroticism of Arabian nights with the infinite and hazy vistas of the Sahara to create a powerful confection of tragic heroism and passionate love.&quot; During the war itself, French censors banned the entire subject of the war. Since 1962, when film censorship relating to the war eased, French films dealing with the conflict have consistently portrayed the war as a set of conflicting memories and rival narratives (which ones being correct are left unclear), with most films dealing with the war taking a disjointed chronological structure in which scenes before, during and after the war are juxtaposed out of sequence with one film critic referring to the cinematic Algeria as &quot;an ambiguous world marked by the displacements and repetitions of dreams&quot;. The consistent message of French films dealing with the war is that something horrible happened, but what happened, who was involved and why are left unexplained. Atrocities, especially torture by French forces are acknowledged, the French soldiers who fought in Algeria were and are always portrayed in French cinema as the &quot;lost soldiers&quot; and tragic victims of the war who are more deserving of sympathy than the FLN people they tortured, which are almost invariably portrayed as vicious, psychopathic terrorists, an approach to the war that has raised anger in Algeria.

=== Reminders ===

From time to time, the memory of the Algerian War surfaced in France. In 1987, when SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; Klaus Barbie, the &quot;Butcher of Lyon&quot;, was brought to trial for crimes against humanity, graffiti appeared on the walls of the &quot;banlieues&quot;, the slum districts in which most Algerian immigrants in France live, reading: &quot;Barbie in France! When will Massu be in Algeria!&quot;. Barbie&#x27;s lawyer, Jacques Vergès, adopted a &quot;tu quoque&quot; defence that asked the judges &quot;is a crime against humanity is to be defined as only one of Nazis against the Jews or if it applies to more seriously crimes... the crimes of imperialists against people struggling for their independence?&quot;. He went on to say that nothing that his client had done against the French Resistance that was not done by &quot;certain French officers in Algeria&quot; who, Vergès noted, could not be prosecuted because of de Gaulle&#x27;s amnesty of 1962. In 1997, when Maurice Papon, a career French civil servant was brought to trial for crimes against humanity for sending 1600 Jews from Bordeaux to be killed at Auschwitz in 1942, it emerged over the course of the trial that on 17 October 1961, Papon had organized a massacre of between 100 and 200 Algerians in central Paris, which was the first time that most French had ever heard of the massacre. The revelation that hundreds of people had been killed by the Paris &quot;Sûreté&quot; was a great shock in France and led to uncomfortable questions being raised about what had happened during the Algerian War. The American historian William Cohen wrote that the Papon trial &quot;sharpened the focus&quot; on the Algerian War but not provide &quot;clarity&quot;, as Papon&#x27;s role as a civil servant under Vichy led to misleading conclusions in France that it was former collaborators who were responsible for the terror in Algeria, but most of the men responsible, like Guy Mollet, General Marcel Bigeard, Robert Lacoste, General Jacques Massu and Jacques Soustelle, had actually all been &quot;résistants&quot; in World War II, which many French historians found to be very unpalatable.

On 15 June 2000, &quot;Le Monde&quot; published an interview with Louisette Ighilahriz, a former FLN member who described in graphic detail her torture at the hands of the French Army and made the sensational claim that the war heroes General Jacques Massu and General Marcel Bigeard had personally been present when she was being tortured for information. What made the interview very touching for many French people was that Ighilahriz was not demanding vengeance but wished to express thanks to Dr. François Richaud, the army doctor who extended her much kindness and who, she believed, saved her life by treating her every time she was tortured. She asked if it were possible for her to see Dr. Richaud one last time to thank him personally, but it later turned out that Dr. Richaud had died in 1997. As Ighilahriz had been an attractive woman in her youth, university-educated, secular, fluent in French and fond of quoting Victor Hugo, and her duties in the FLN had been as an information courier, she made for a most sympathetic victim since she was a woman who did not come across as Algerian. William Cohen commented that had she been an uneducated man who had been involved in killings and was not coming forward to express thanks for a Frenchman, her story might not have resonated the same way. The Ighiahriz case led to a public letter signed by 12 people who been involved in the war to President Jacques Chirac to ask October 31 be made a public day of remembrance for victims of torture in Algeria.

In response to the Ighilahriz case, General Paul Aussaresses gave an interview on 23 November 2000 in which he candidly admitted to ordering torture and extrajudicial executions and stated he had personally executed 24 &quot;fellagha&quot;. He argued that they were justified, as torture and extrajudicial executions were the only way to defeat the FLN. In May 2001, Aussaresses published his memoirs, &quot;Services spéciaux Algérie 1955–1957&quot;, in which he presented a detailed account of torture and extrajudicial killings in the name of the republic, which he wrote were all done under orders from Paris; that confirmed what had been long suspected. As a result of the interviews and Aussaresses&#x27;s book, the Algerian War was finally extensively discussed by the French media, which had ignored the subject as much as possible for decades, but no consensus emerged about how to best remember the war. Adding to the interest was the decision by one war veteran, Georges Fogel, to come forward to confirm that he had seen Ighiahriz and many others tortured in 1957, and the politician and war veteran Jean Marie Faure decided in February 2001 to release extracts from the diary that he had kept and showed &quot;acts of sadism and horror&quot; that he had witnessed. The French historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet called that a moment of &quot;catharsis&quot; that was &quot;explainable only in near-French terms: it is the return of the repressed&quot;.

In 2002, &quot;Une Vie Debout: Mémoires Politiques&quot; by Mohammed Harbi, a former advisor to Ben Bella, was published in which Harbi wrote: &quot;Because they [the FLN leaders] weren&#x27;t supported at the moment of their arrival on the scene by a real and dynamic popular movement, they took power of the movement by force and they maintained it by force. Convinced that they had to act with resolution in order to protect themselves against their enemies, they deliberately chose an authoritarian path.&quot;

=== Continued controversy in France ===

The Algerian War remains a contentious event. According to the historian Benjamin Stora, one of the leading historians on the war, memories concerning the war remain fragmented, with no common ground to speak of:

There is no such thing as a history of the Algerian War; there is just a multitude of histories and personal paths through it. Everyone involved considers that they lived through it in their own way, and any attempt to understand the Algerian War globally is immediately rejected by protagonists.

Even though Stora has counted 3,000 publications in French on the war, there still is no work produced by French and Algerian authors co-operating with each other. Although according to Stora, there can &quot;no longer be talk about a &#x27;war without a name&#x27;, a number of problems remain, especially the absence of sites in France to commemorate&quot; the war. Furthermore, conflicts have arisen on an exact commemoration date to end the war. Although many sources as well as the French state place it on 19 March 1962, the Évian Agreements, others point out that massacres of harkis and the kidnapping of &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; took place later. Stora further points out, &quot;The phase of memorial reconciliation between the two sides of the sea is still a long way off.&quot; That was evidenced by the National Assembly&#x27;s creation of the law on colonialism on 23 February 2005 that asserted that colonialism had overall been &quot;positive&quot;.

Alongside a heated debate in France, the February 23, 2005, law had the effect of jeopardising the treaty of friendship that President Chirac was supposed to sign with President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, which was no longer on the agenda. Following that controversial law, Bouteflika has talked about a cultural genocide, particularly referring to the 1945 Sétif massacre. Chirac finally had the law repealed by a complex institutional mechanism.

Another matter concerns the teaching of the war as well as of colonialism and decolonization, particularly in French secondary schools. Hence, there is only one reference to racism in a French textbook, one published by Bréal publishers for &quot;terminales&quot; students, those passing their baccalauréat. Thus, many are not surprised that the first to speak about the Paris massacre of 1961 were music bands, including hip-hop bands such as the famous Suprême NTM (&quot;les Arabes dans la Seine&quot;) or politically-engaged La Rumeur. Indeed, the Algerian War is not even the subject of a specific chapter in the textbook for &quot;terminales&quot;. Henceforth, Benjamin Stora stated:

As Algerians do not appear in an &quot;indigenous&quot; condition, and their sub-citizens status, as the history of nationalist movement, is never evoked as their being one of great figures of the resistance, such as Messali Hadj and Ferhat Abbas. They neither emerge nor are being given attention. No one is explaining to students what colonization has been. We have prevented students from understanding why the decolonization took place.

=== Socioeconomic situation of French Algerians ===

In Metropolitan France in 1963, 43% of French Algerians lived in &quot;bidonvilles&quot; (shanty towns). Thus, Azouz Begag, the delegate Minister for Equal Opportunities, wrote an autobiographic novel, &quot;Le Gone du Chaâba&quot;, about his experiences while living in a &quot;bidonville&quot; in the outskirts of Lyon. It is impossible to understand the third-generation of Algerian immigrants to France without recalling the bicultural experience. An official parliamentary report on the &quot;prevention of criminality&quot;, commanded by Interior Minister Philippe de Villepin and made by the deputy Jacques-Alain Bénisti, claimed, &quot;Bilingualism (&quot;bilinguisme&quot;) was a factor of criminality&quot; (sic). Following outcries, the definitive version of the report finally made bilingualism an asset, rather than a fault.

=== French recognition of historical use of torture ===

After having denied or downplayed its use for 40 years, France has finally recognized its history of torture, but there was never an official proclamation about it. General Paul Aussaresses was sentenced following his justification of the use of torture for &quot;apology of war crimes&quot;. As they occurred during wartime, France claimed torture to be isolated acts, instead of admitting its responsibility for the frequent use of torture to break the insurgents&#x27; morale, not, as Aussaresses had claimed, to &quot;save lives&quot; by gaining short-term information which would stop &quot;terrorists&quot;. The state now claims that torture was a regrettable aberration because of the context of the exceptionally-savage war. However, academic research has proved both theses to be false. &quot;Torture in Algeria was engraved in the colonial act; it is a &#x27;normal&#x27; illustration of an abnormal system&quot;, wrote Nicolas Bancel, Pascal Blanchard and Sandrine Lemaire, who discussed the phenomena of &quot;human zoos&quot;. From the &quot;enfumades&quot; (slaughter by smoke inhalation) of the Darha caves in 1844 by Aimable Pélissier to the 1945 riots in Sétif, Guelma and Kherrata, the repression in Algeria used the same methods. Following the Sétif massacres, other riots against the European presence occurred in Guelma, Batna, Biskra, and Kherrata that resulted in 103 deaths among the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;. The suppression of the riots officially saw 1,500 other deaths, but N. Bancel, P. Blanchard and S. Lemaire estimate the number to be between 6,000 and 8,000.

<text>A diplomat (from ; romanized &quot;diploma&quot;) is a person appointed by a state, intergovernmental, or nongovernmental institution to conduct diplomacy with one or more other states or international organizations.

The main functions of diplomats are representation and protection of the interests and nationals of the sending state; initiation and facilitation of strategic agreements, treaties and conventions; and promotion of information, trade and commerce, technology, and friendly relations. Seasoned diplomats of international repute are used in international organizations (for example, the United Nations, the world&#x27;s largest diplomatic forum) as well as multinational companies for their experience in management and negotiating skills. Diplomats are members of foreign services and diplomatic corps of various nations of the world.

The sending state is required to get the consent of the receiving state for a person proposed to serve in key diplomatic positions such as an ambassador, also referred to as the head of the mission. The receiving state of the proposed diplomat may accept the diplomat or refuse to accept the diplomat without having to provide reasons for its refusal or acceptance of the person. While the head of the mission or any member of the diplomatic staff is already on duty in the receiving state, the receiving state may still decide at anytime that the person is no longer wanted in the state and is considered persona non grata. When this happens, the sending state may discharge the person.

Diplomats are the oldest form of any of the foreign policy institutions of a state, predating by centuries foreign ministers and ministerial offices. They usually have diplomatic immunity, and in their official travels they usually use a diplomatic passport or, for UN officials, a United Nations laissez-passer.

==Terminology==

The regular use of permanent diplomatic representation began in the states of 15th-century Italy. However the terms &quot;diplomacy&quot; and &quot;diplomat&quot; appeared during the French Revolution. &quot;Diplomat&quot; is derived from the Greek διπλωμάτης (&quot;diplōmátēs&quot;), the holder of a diploma, referring to diplomats&#x27; documents of accreditation from their sovereign.

Diplomats themselves and historians often refer to the foreign ministry by its address: the Ballhausplatz (Vienna), the Quai d’Orsay (Paris), the Wilhelmstraße (Berlin); Itamaraty (from the former Itamaraty Palace in Rio de Janeiro, now transferred to Brasília since 1970) and Foggy Bottom (Washington). For imperial Russia to 1917 it was the Choristers&#x27; Bridge (St Petersburg). The Italian ministry was called &quot;the Consulta&quot;.

== Career diplomats and political appointees ==
Though any person can be appointed by the State&#x27;s national government to conduct said state&#x27;s relations with other States or international organizations, a number of States maintain an institutionalized group of career diplomats—that is, public servants with a steady professional connection to the country&#x27;s foreign ministry. The term &quot;career diplomat&quot; is used worldwide in opposition to &quot;political appointees&quot; (that is, people from any other professional backgrounds who may equally be designated by an official government to act as diplomats abroad). While officially posted to an embassy or delegation in a foreign country or accredited to an international organization, both career diplomats and political appointees enjoy the same diplomatic immunities, as well as United Nations officials. Ceremonial heads of state commonly act as diplomats on behalf of their nation, usually following instructions from their head of Government. Sasson Sofer argues that, &quot;The ideal diplomat, by the nature of his mission, is destined to clash with the expedient needs of his country&#x27;s politics.&quot; On the other hand, professional politicians often ridicule diplomats. President John F. Kennedy often denigrated career diplomats as &quot;weak and effeminate&quot; and moved foreign policy decisions out of their hands.

==Diplomatic ranks==
Every diplomat, while posted abroad, will be classified in one of the ranks of diplomats (secretary, counselor, minister, ambassador, envoy, or &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot;) as regulated by international law (namely, by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961).

Diplomats can be contrasted with consuls who help businesspeople, and military attachés. They represent not the foreign ministry but other branches of their government, but lack the diplomat&#x27;s role in dealing with foreign policy at the highest level.

== Function ==
Diplomats in posts collect and report information that could affect national interests, often with advice about how the home-country government should respond. Then, once any policy response has been decided in the home country&#x27;s capital, posts bear major responsibility for implementing it. Diplomats have the job of conveying, in the most persuasive way possible, the views of the home government to the governments to which they are accredited and, in doing so, of trying to convince those governments to act in ways that suit home-country interests. In this way, diplomats are part of the beginning and the end of each loop in the continuous process through which foreign policy develops.

In general, it has become harder for diplomats to act autonomously. Diplomats use secure communication systems, such as emails, and mobile telephones that allow reaching even the most reclusive head of mission. This technology also gives diplomats the capacity for more immediate input about the policy-making processes in the home capital.

Secure email has transformed the contact between diplomats and the ministry. It is less likely to leak, and enables more personal contact than the formal cablegram, with its wide distribution and impersonal style.

=== Advocacy ===

The home country will usually send instructions to a diplomatic post on what foreign policy goals to pursue, but decisions on tactics – who needs to be influenced, what will best persuade them, who are potential allies and adversaries, and how it can be done – are for the diplomats overseas to make.

In this operation, the intelligence, integrity, cultural understanding, and energy of individual diplomats become critical. If competent, they will have developed relationships grounded in trust and mutual understanding with influential members of the country in which they are accredited. They will have worked hard to understand the motives, thought patterns and culture of the other side.

== Training ==
Most career diplomats have university degrees in international relations, political science, history, economics, or law. &quot;Emotional intelligence&quot; has recently become a component of many foreign service training programs.

== Status and public image ==
Diplomats have generally been considered members of an exclusive and prestigious profession. The public image of diplomats has been described as &quot;a caricature of pinstriped men gliding their way around a never-ending global cocktail party&quot;. J. W. Burton has noted that &quot;despite the absence of any specific professional training, diplomacy has a high professional status, due perhaps to a degree of secrecy and mystery that its practitioners self-consciously promote.&quot; The state supports the high status, privileges, and self-esteem of its diplomats in order to support its own international status and position.

The high regard for diplomats is also due to most countries&#x27; conspicuous selection of diplomats, with regard to their professionalism and ability to behave according to a certain etiquette, in order to effectively promote their interests. Also, international law grants diplomats extensive privileges and immunities, which further distinguishes the diplomat from the status of an ordinary citizen.

== Psychology and loyalty ==
While posted overseas, there is a danger that diplomats may become disconnected from their own country and culture. Sir Harold Nicolson acknowledged that diplomats can become &quot;denationalised, internationalised and therefore dehydrated, an elegant empty husk&quot;. Nicolson also claimed that personal motives often influenced the diplomatic pursuit of the national interest. For example, he wrote: &quot;Nobody who has not actually watched statesmen dealing with each other can have any real idea of the immense part played in human affairs by such unavowable and often unrecognisable causes as lassitude, affability, personal affection or dislike, misunderstanding, deafness or incomplete command of a foreign language, vanity, social engagements, interruptions and momentary health.&quot;

To prevent disconnection and apathy from their own state, many foreign services mandate their employees to return to their home countries in between period serving abroad.

==International Day of Diplomats==
Diplomats have started celebrating International Day of Diplomats on October 24 since 2017. The idea of celebrating International Day of Diplomats on the day the United Nations was founded was proposed by Indian diplomat Abhay Kumar to mark the occasion as diplomacy becoming the principal means of resolving disputes.

<text>Sandwich is a town and civil parish in the Dover District of Kent, south-east England. It lies on the River Stour and has a population of 4,985. Sandwich was one of the Cinque Ports and still has many original medieval buildings, including several listed public houses and gates in the old town walls, churches, almshouses and the White Mill. While it was once a major port, Sandwich is now from the sea due to the disappearance of the Wantsum Channel. Its historic centre has been preserved. Sandwich Bay is home to nature reserves and two world-class golf courses, Royal St George&#x27;s and Prince&#x27;s. The town is also a home to many educational and cultural events. Sandwich also gave its name to the food by way of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, and the word &quot;sandwich&quot; is now found in several languages.

==Etymology==
The place-name &#x27;Sandwich&#x27; is first attested in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, where it appears as &#x27; in 851 and &#x27; in 993. In the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 it appears as &#x27;. The suffix &quot;-wich&quot; comes from the Anglo Saxon &#x27;, meaning a dwelling or fortified place where trade takes place. The name means &quot;market town on sandy soil&quot;.

==History==

Before Sandwich became a Cinque Port, the ancient Saxon town of Stonar on the bank of the Wantsum estuary (on the opposite side of the mouth of the River Stour), was already well established. It remained a place of considerable importance but it disappeared almost without trace in the 14th century. The ruins of the major Roman fort of Richborough are close by. It was the landing place of the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43. In 2008, an archaeological dig proved that this was a defensive site of a Roman beachhead, protecting 700 metres of the coast.

In 1028 King Canute (–1035) granted a charter to the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury, to operate a ferry across the river and collect tolls. In 1192, returning from the Third Crusade, Richard the Lionheart was jailed by the Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI. Henry released Richard in February 1194. On 13 March 1194, Richard landed at the port of Sandwich and came back to England. In 1216, Prince Louis of France landed at Sandwich in support of the First Barons&#x27; War against King John. The Battle of Sandwich occurred just off the coast in 1217. By 1295, Sandwich was a borough within the Lathe of St. Augustine.
The Fisher Gate on the quay dates from 1384, and has been scheduled as an Ancient Monument. It is the only one of the original mediaeval town gates to survive. It is a Grade I listed building. The nearby Barbican dates from the 14th century and stands at the end of the bridge over the River Stour where it was used as a toll house.

On 28 August 1457, the French took advantage of political instability in England by sending a raiding party to Kent, burning much of Sandwich to the ground. A force of around 4,000 men from Honfleur, under the command of Pierre de Brézé, Marshal of France, came ashore to pillage the town, in the process murdering the mayor, John Drury. It thereafter became an established tradition, which survives to this day, that the Mayor of Sandwich wears a black robe in mourning.

Sandwich was a key town in the early history of the Huguenots in Kent. The town gained significantly from the skills brought to the town by many Flemish settlers, who were granted the right to settle by letters patent from Elizabeth I, dated 6 July 1561. Sandwich was the only town in England that housed more so-called &quot;strangers&quot; than native Englishmen in the 16th century. Historian Marcel Backhouse estimated there were at least 2,400 Flemish and 500 Walloon exiles living in Sandwich at the time. These settlers brought with them techniques of market gardening, and were responsible for growing the first English celery, which was already - and still is - very popular in Flanders. Elizabeth I granted 25 Flemish families permission to live in Sandwich, and St Peter became the &quot;Stranger&#x27;s Church&quot; in 1564 when the plague came to the town, in an effort to halt the spread of the disease. The 1661 tower collapse was repaired by the Flemish community, and the distinctive tower reflects their work. The Huguenot refugees also brought over Flemish architectural techniques, that are now as much a part of Kent as the thatched cottage. One can still see the difference between the English (lower section) and Flemish (upper section) of the tower. In addition techniques of silk manufacture were imported, enhancing the Kent cloth industry.

The coat of arms of Sandwich is blazoned &quot;Per pale Gules and Azure three demi-Lions passant guardant in pale Or conjoined with as many sterns of demi-Ships Argent&quot;; see photo. It is one of the earliest heraldic examples of dimidiation, an early method of combining two different coats of arms: in this case the Royal Arms of England (1198–1340), &quot;Gules three lions passant guardant Or langued and armed Azure&quot;, and the Arms of the Cinque Ports, &quot;Azure three ships Or&quot;. The title Earl of Sandwich was created in 1660 for the prominent naval commander Admiral Sir Edward Montagu (1625–72).
In 1759, Thomas Paine (1737–1809) had his home and shop in a house at 20 New Street. The house is now marked with a plaque and is a listed building.

In 1912 Sir Edwin Lutyens (1869–1944) built The Salutation in Queen Anne style. The gardens were laid out by Gertrude Jekyll. In World War I, Sandwich was important as a transit location for troops heading to Ypres.

In 1980 Jean Barker became, in the full recitation of her life peerage, Baroness Trumpington, of Sandwich in the County of Kent. In 2014 an original copy of Magna Carta, issued in 1300, was found together with a copy of the Charter of the Forest. It was only the second time in history that the two documents have been found together. They are now displayed alongside other historical artefacts in the Sandwich Guildhall Museum.

==Governance==
The town and parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. It comprises sixteen town councillors. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The town falls within the non-metropolitan district of Dover. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

Kent County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

It is also part of a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and at the general election in 2024 became part of the Herne Bay and Sandwich constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

===Twin towns===

Sandwich is twinned with:
*Sandwich, Massachusetts in the United States
*Honfleur in France
*Ronse in Belgium
*Sonsbeck in Germany

==Geography==

There is Monk&#x27;s Wall nature reserve and a bird observatory at Sandwich Bay, which provides a home for wild duck and other wildlife in a wetland habitat. The reserve was opened by celebrity bird-watcher Bill Oddie in May 2000. Sandwich Bay Bird Observatory Trust proposed the design and a management plan, including modifications to ditches and control of water levels to create ecological conditions that attract wetland species of plants, animals and birds. Historically the land was reclaimed from the river and sea by the monks of Sandwich, and the northern boundary is still the old Monks&#x27; wall of the 13th century. In the 1953 floods the sea covered the whole area around Sandwich and after these fields were drained a new river bank was created and the land ploughed for arable farming, with heavy use of fertiliser.

There is also a Local Nature Reserve known as Gazen Salts.

Sandwich lies at the southern end of Pegwell Bay, which includes a large nature reserve, known for its migrating waders and wildfowl, with a complete series of seashore habitats including extensive mudflats and salt marsh.

==Economy==

The local economy has benefited from significant investment by Pfizer UK, the British subsidiary of the multinational pharmaceuticals company Pfizer, which built a research and development centre near Sandwich, employing over 3,000 people. Laboratory experiments at the site aroused negative comment by animal rights activists. On 18 June 2007 Pfizer announced it would move the Sandwich Animal Health Research (VMRD) division to Kalamazoo, Michigan. Several important drugs including Viagra, Pfizer&#x27;s treatment for erectile dysfunction, Maraviroc, a drug used for treatment of HIV and the horse wormer Strongid P were developed here. On 1 February 2011 Pfizer announced that the entire research and development facility at Sandwich would be closed within 18–24 months, with a loss of 2,400 jobs, though it later announced up to 650 jobs would stay. The University of Kent was considering use of the campus style site. The UK Government intervened to establish an &#x27;Enterprise Zone&#x27; on the site, which is now run as a business park called Discovery Park Enterprise Zone.

==Landmarks==

Sandwich Guildhall, in the town square, was built in 1579. It is a Grade II* listed building. The courtroom is still used regularly for civic functions, such as &#x27;Mayor-making&#x27;, and available to hire as a wedding venue.

The Admiral Owen is a pub in a two-storey, 15th century timber-framed building. It was refronted in the 18th century, but this work preserved the overhang of its first floor on a bressummer and massive corner post with three brackets. The nearby Crispin Inn was originally called the Crispin and Crispianus. It has similar timber framing and was built in the 16th century. Across the road on the quay is the Bell Hotel, which underwent major rebuilding in the 18th and 19th centuries. There has been a Bell Inn on the quay since the 14th century.

The three pubs cluster around The Barbican which was built in the late 14th century. It consists of 2 round towers, with chequered work of stone and flints. A narrow road passes between the towers with a semi-circular timber barrel roof over it. A small 2-storeyed 20th-century house built on to north side of the north west tower was occupied by the toll collector for the bridge. The Sandwich Toll Bridge was built in 1773 of Portland stone with a Dutch type timber raised platform which was replaced in 1892 with an iron swing bridge.

===Windmills===

Sandwich has had at least eight windmills over the centuries, the earliest reference to a mill being dated 1608. Two windmills were marked by Hasted at the New Cut on the Stour estuary. They were most likely pumping mills associated with the saltworks there in the late eighteenth century.

The White Mill is the only survivor. It was built in 1760 and worked by wind until 1929, then by engine until 1957. Today it has been restored and is a heritage and folk museum. The Black Mill was a smock mill which burnt down . There was also a post mill which stood near the Black Mill, and was worked in conjunction with it. A smock mill on the Millwall was also known as the Town Mill. It was burnt down. Another mill of unknown type is known to have stood on the Millwall. A sixth windmill stood to the north west of Sandwich, and west of the railway. It formed a group of three with the Black Mill and its neighbour.

=== Museum ===
Sandwich Guildhall Museum houses original copies of the Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest from 1300. Other exhibits explore the history of Sandwich and include Roman relics, famous figures and a wide variety of medieval and modern artefacts. Admission is free and visitors can view the Guildhall Tudor courtroom.

The museum was fully refurbished in 2017.

Sandwich Guildhall Archives adjoins the museum and holds material related to the history of Sandwich. This includes maps and plans, photographs, burial information, postcards, newspapers, books, personal collections as well as research relating to Sandwich up to the present day. Access is open to the public by appointment.

===Fingerpost===

There is a nearby village to the south called Ham. A fingerpost three miles from Sandwich in the hamlet of West Street points towards both Ham and Sandwich, thus reading &quot;Ham Sandwich&quot;.

==Transport==

The town is served by Sandwich railway station. It was formerly also served by Sandwich Road railway station on the East Kent Light Railway.

Sandwich has been bypassed by the A256 road, which connects Thanet to Dover. It is reached from Canterbury by the A257, which joins the A256 at Sandwich.

Stagecoach in East Kent operate local buses to other major towns in East Kent. The main routes from Sandwich are 43 to Canterbury, 45 to Ramsgate, 80 &amp; 81 to Deal/Dover and 43 to Discovery Park

==Religious sites==

St Bartholomew&#x27;s Chapel was restored and enlarged by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 19th century. Nearby were two religious almshouses: St Bart&#x27;s Hospital dates back to around 1190, and St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital was built in the 14th century and named in honour of St Thomas Becket.

The Church of St Peter includes some evidence of early Norman work, but was rebuilt in the early 13th century. In 1661 the top of the central tower collapsed, destroying the south aisle. The Anglican parish church is St. Clement, which has a tower dating from the latter half of the 12th century; the rest of the church is from the 12th and 14th centuries. St Mary&#x27;s Church also has Norman features and was built on the site of a convent founded by Domne Eafe, cousin to King Ecgberht of Kent.

==Sport==

Sandwich has two world-class golf courses, Royal St George&#x27;s which hosts The Open Championship approximately every 10 years, and Prince&#x27;s which hosted The Open Championship in 1932, and is currently an Open Championship Final Qualifying course. The Open Championship returned to Sandwich in 2011 and in 2021.

==Education==

Within the immediate area of Sandwich there are four schools: Sandwich Infants (for children aged 4 to 8), Sandwich Juniors (8 to 11), Sir Roger Manwood&#x27;s School (11 to 18) and Sandwich Technology School (11 to 18).

==Culture==

The town&#x27;s connection with the food item of the same name is that John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, who lived in the 18th century, allegedly invented it. As the story goes, he was an avid gambler, and since he often did not have time to sit for a meal due to his gambling habits, he would order his valet to bring him meat tucked between two pieces of bread. Because Montagu was the Earl of Sandwich, others began to order &quot;the same as Sandwich!&quot; However, the exact circumstances of the invention are still the subject of debate. A rumour in a contemporary travel book called &quot;Tour to London&quot; by Pierre Jean Grosley (although not confirmed) formed the popular myth that bread and meat sustained Lord Sandwich at the gambling table. An alternative suggestion by Sandwich&#x27;s biographer, N. A. M. Rodger, is that due to Sandwich&#x27;s commitments to the navy, to politics and the arts, the first sandwich is more likely to have been consumed at his desk, a practice perpetuated in offices ever since.

===Sandwich Festival===
The town of Sandwich has an annual festival period towards the end of August when a number of events are staged. During Sandwich festivals of the past there have been European markets, motorcycle meets, an illuminated boat parade or dressed ship parade on The Quay, a street Barn Dance, various concerts (both classical and modern pop/rock), Simultaneous Chess Tournament with Grand Master John Emms and a vintage Car Show. The festival usually lasts for eight days.

===Newspapers===
Sandwich has two paid-for newspapers, the &quot;Deal and Sandwich Express&quot; (published by Kent Regional News and Media) and the &quot;East Kent Mercury&quot; (published by the KM Group). Free newspapers for the town include the &quot;Dover Extra&quot;, part of the KM Group; and &quot;yoursandwich&quot;, part of KOS Media.

===Radio===
The local radio station for Sandwich is KMFM Shepway and White Cliffs Country, although the town has good coverage of KMFM Thanet.

Sandwich is also covered by community radio service DCR 104.9FM Dover Community Radio who cover Dover District broadcasting on 104.9FM since May 2022 and online since 30 July 2011, after being founded as a podcasting service in 2010. In May 2020 it was announced by OFCOM that Dover Community Radio have been awarded a community radio licence and they started broadcasting on 104.9FM FM in May 2022 to Dover, Deal and Sandwich and White Cliffs Country.
Thanet’s Academy FM, the community radio station for Thanet can also be received in Sandwich on 107.8FM.

==In popular culture==

Author Russell Hoban repurposes Sandwich as &quot;Sams Itch&quot; in his 1980, post apocalyptic novel &quot;Riddley Walker&quot;.

<text>The Lockheed F-104 Starfighter is an American single-engine, supersonic interceptor which was extensively deployed as a fighter-bomber during the Cold War. Created as a day fighter by Lockheed as one of the &quot;Century Series&quot; of fighter aircraft for the United States Air Force (USAF), it was developed into an all-weather multirole aircraft in the early 1960s and produced by several other nations, seeing widespread service outside the United States.

After a series of interviews with Korean War fighter pilots in 1951, Kelly Johnson, then lead designer at Lockheed, opted to reverse the trend of ever-larger and more complex fighters to produce a simple, lightweight aircraft with maximum altitude and climb performance. On 4 March 1954, the Lockheed XF-104 took to the skies for the first time, and on 26 February 1958, the production fighter was activated by the USAF. Just a few months later, it was pressed into action during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, when it was deployed as a deterrent to Chinese MiG-15 and MiG-17 fighters. Problems with the General Electric J79 engine and a preference for fighters with longer ranges and heavier payloads meant its service with the USAF was short-lived, though it was reactivated for service during the Berlin Crisis of 1961 and the Vietnam War, when it flew more than 5,000 combat sorties.

While its time with the USAF was brief, the Starfighter found much more lasting success with other NATO and allied nations. In October 1958, West Germany selected the F-104 as its primary fighter aircraft. Canada soon followed, along with the Netherlands, Belgium, Japan, and Italy. The European nations formed a construction consortium that was the largest international manufacturing program in history to that point, though the Starfighter&#x27;s export success was marred in 1975 by the discovery of bribe payments made by Lockheed to many foreign military and political figures for securing purchase contracts.

The Starfighter eventually flew with fifteen air forces, but its poor safety record, especially in &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; service, brought it substantial criticism. The Germans lost 292 of 916 aircraft and 116 pilots from 1961 to 1989, its high accident rate earning it the nickname &quot;Witwenmacher&quot; (&quot;widowmaker&quot;) from the German public. The final production version, the F-104S, was an all-weather interceptor built by Aeritalia for the Italian Air Force. It was retired from active service in 2004, though several F-104s remain in civilian operation with Florida-based Starfighter Inc.

The Starfighter featured a radical design, with thin, stubby wings attached farther back on the fuselage than most contemporary aircraft. The wing provided excellent supersonic and high-speed, low-altitude performance, but also poor turning capability and high landing speeds. It was the first production aircraft to achieve Mach 2, and the first aircraft to reach an altitude of after taking off under its own power. The Starfighter established world records for airspeed, altitude, and time-to-climb in 1958, becoming the first aircraft to hold all three simultaneously. It was also the first aircraft to be equipped with the M61 Vulcan autocannon.

==Development==

===Background and early development===
 Clarence L. &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson, vice president of engineering and research at Lockheed&#x27;s Skunk Works, visited USAF air bases across South Korea in November 1951 to speak with fighter pilots about what they wanted and needed in a fighter aircraft. At the time, the American pilots were confronting the MiG-15 with North American F-86 Sabres, and many felt that the MiGs were superior to the larger and more complex American fighters. The pilots requested a small and simple aircraft with excellent performance, especially high-speed and high-altitude capabilities. Johnson started the design of such an aircraft upon his return to the United States. In March 1952, his team was assembled; they studied over 100 aircraft configurations, ranging from small designs at just , to large ones up to . To achieve the desired performance, Lockheed chose a small and simple aircraft, weighing in at with a single powerful engine. The engine chosen was the new General Electric J79 turbojet, an engine of dramatically improved performance in comparison with contemporary designs. The small design powered by a single J79, issued Temporary Design Number L-246, remained essentially identical to the prototype Starfighter as eventually delivered. Lockheed designated the prototype Model 083.

Johnson presented his new fighter concept to the United States Air Force on 5 November 1952, and they were interested enough to create a general operational requirement for a lightweight fighter to supplement and ultimately replace the yet-to-fly North American F-100. Three additional companies were named finalists for the requirement: Republic Aviation with the AP-55, an improved version of its prototype XF-91 Thunderceptor; North American Aviation with the NA-212, which eventually evolved into the F-107; and Northrop Corporation with the N-102 Fang, another J79-powered entry. Although all three finalists&#x27; proposals were strong, Lockheed had what proved to be an insurmountable head start, and was granted a development contract on 1953 for two prototypes; these were given the designation &quot;XF-104&quot;.

Work progressed quickly, with a mock-up ready for inspection at the end of April, and work starting on two prototypes soon after. Meanwhile, the J79 engine was not ready. Both prototypes were instead built to use the Wright J65 engine, a license-constructed version of the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire. The first prototype was completed at Lockheed&#x27;s Burbank facility by early 1954 and first flew on 4 March at Edwards AFB. The total time from contract to first flight was less than one year.

Though development of the F-104 was never a secret, only a vague description of the aircraft was given when the USAF first revealed its existence. No photographs of the aircraft were released to the public until 1956, even though the XF-104 first flew in 1954. At the April 1956 public unveiling of the , the engine inlets were obscured with metal covers. Visible weapons, including the M61 Vulcan cannon, were also hidden. Despite the secrecy, an artist&#x27;s rendering of the yet-unseen F-104 appeared in the September 1954 edition of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; that was very close to the actual design.

The prototype made a hop into the air during taxi trials on 28 February 1954 and flew about off the ground for a short distance, but this was not counted as a first flight. On 4 March, Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier flew the XF-104 for its first official flight. He was airborne for only , much shorter than planned, due to landing gear retraction problems. The second prototype was destroyed several weeks later during gun-firing trials when the hatch to the ejector seat blew out, depressurizing the cockpit and causing the pilot to eject in the mistaken belief that a cannon mishap had crippled the aircraft. Nevertheless, on 1 November 1955 the remaining XF-104 was accepted by the USAF.

===Further development===
Based on the testing and evaluation of the XF-104, the next variant, the YF-104A, was lengthened and fitted with a General Electric J79 engine, modified landing gear, and modified air intakes. The YF-104A and subsequent models were longer than the XF-104 to accommodate the larger GE J79 engine. The YF-104 initially flew with the GE XJ79-GE-3 turbojet which generated 9,300 pounds of dry thrust (14,800 with afterburner), which was later replaced by the J79-GE-3A with an improved afterburner.

Seventeen YF-104As were ordered by the USAF on 30 March 1955 for further flight testing. The first of them flew on 17 February 1956 and, with the other 16 trial aircraft, was soon carrying out aircraft and equipment evaluation and tests. On 1 May 1957 one of the prototypes was destroyed when the ailerons malfunctioned, resulting in the aircraft tumbling wildly. The pilot ejected safely. Lockheed made several improvements to the YF-104A throughout this testing period, including strengthening the airframe, adding a ventral fin to improve directional stability at supersonic speed, and installing a boundary layer control system (BLCS) to reduce landing speed.

Problems were encountered with the J79 afterburner; further delays were caused by the need to add AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. On 28 January 1958, the first production F-104A to enter service was delivered to the 83rd Fighter Interceptor Wing.

===Redesign for NATO===

In response to a 1957 German Air Staff Paper asking for a single aircraft to fulfill its fighter, fighter-bomber, and reconnaissance mission requirements, Lockheed redesigned the entire airframe, including 96 new forgings, additional skin panels, and reinforced landing gear with larger tires and improved brakes. The proposed F-104G (for Germany) &quot;Super Starfighter&quot; featured a more powerful J79-11A engine, a larger tail with powered rudder (the same used on the two-seat F-104B and D), improved blown flaps with a mode for improved maneuverability, electric de-icing equipment for the air intake inlets, and a larger drag chute. Avionics were improved as well, primarily with the Autonetics F15A NASARR (North American Search and Range Radar) multi-mode radar and the LN-3 inertial navigation system by Litton Industries, the first such system to be placed into operational service. Altogether, these changes increased the amount of external weapons that could be carried to , and also allowed the aircraft to fulfill the NATO requirement of carrying a &quot;special store&quot; (nuclear weapon) under the fuselage.

Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy selected the F-104 soon after as well, and the four European nations set up four production groups to jointly manufacture the F-104G under license. &quot;Arbeitsgemeinschaft&quot; (ARGE) South consisted of Messerschmitt, Heinkel, Dornier, and Siebel; ARGE North comprised Hamburger Flugzeugbau, Focke-Wulf, and Weserflug in Germany, as well as Fokker and Aviolanda in the Netherlands; the West Group was made of SABCA and Avions Fairey in Belgium; and the Italian Group was formed of Fiat, Macchi, Piaggio, SACA, and SIAI-Marchetti. The four groups were contracted to manufacture 210, 350, 189, and 200 F-104G aircraft, respectively. In addition, 1,225 J79 turbojets were also produced under license by BMW in Germany, Fabrique Nationale in Belgium, and Alfa Romeo in Italy. Canada, who had also chosen the Starfighter to fulfill its NATO obligations, delivered 121 sets of wings, aft fuselages, and tail assemblies built by Canadair to Europe while it constructed 200 CF-104s with Orenda-built engines for the Royal Canadian Air Force. Later the two would also build an additional 110 MAP-funded F-104Gs destined for Europe. Lockheed for its part built 191 two-seat trainers for both Europe and Canada, as well as supplying spares and technical support.

The multinational consortium formed a central coordination office named NASMO (NATO Starfighter Management Office) in Koblenz, Germany, which succeeded in achieving a high level of standardization and cooperation. This was evidenced by an F-104G being assembled in April 1963 at Erding Air Base in Germany consisting of components constructed in all four European partner countries. However, this central coordination resulted in long delays in implementing needed modifications and upgrades. Some of the modifications that were proposed during this time, mainly from the Joint Test Force at Edwards AFB in California, were the installation of an arrester hook, a standby attitude indicator, and the emergency engine nozzle closure system.

In all, 2,578 F-104s were produced by Lockheed and under license by various foreign manufacturers.

==Design==

===Airframe===
The Starfighter&#x27;s airframe was all-metal, primarily duralumin with some stainless steel and titanium. The fuselage was approximately two and a half times as long as the airplane&#x27;s wingspan. The wings were centered on the horizontal reference plane, or along the longitudinal centerline of the fuselage, and were located substantially farther aft on the fuselage than most contemporary designs. The aft fuselage was elevated from the horizontal reference plane, resulting a &quot;lifted&quot; tail, and the nose was &quot;drooped&quot;. This caused the aircraft to fly nose up, helping to minimize drag. As a result, the pitot tube, air inlet scoops, and engine thrust line were all canted slightly from centerline of the fuselage.

The F-104 featured a radical wing design. Most jet fighters of the period used a swept-wing or delta-wing, which balanced aerodynamic performance, lift, and internal space for fuel and equipment. The Lockheed tests determined that the most efficient shape for high-speed supersonic flight was a very small and thin, straight, mid-mounted, trapezoidal wing. Much of the data on the wing shape was derived from testing done with the experimental unmanned Lockheed X-7, which used a wing of a similar shape. The leading edge of the wing was swept back at 26 degrees, with the trailing edge swept forward by a slightly smaller amount.

The new wing design was extremely thin, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.36% and an aspect ratio of 2.45. The wing&#x27;s leading edges were so thin () that they were a hazard to ground crews. Hence, protective guards were installed on them during maintenance. The thinness of the wings required fuel tanks and landing gear to be placed in the fuselage, and the hydraulic cylinders driving the ailerons were limited to thickness to fit.

The small, highly loaded wing caused an unacceptably high landing speed, even after adding both leading- and trailing-edge flaps. Thus, designers developed a boundary layer control system, or BLCS, of high-pressure bleed air, which was blown over the trailing-edge flaps to lower landing speeds by more than , and help make landing safer. Flapless landings would be without the BLCS engaged, as flaps in the &quot;land&quot; position were required for its operation. Landing without the BLCS engaged was only done in emergencies and could be a harrowing experience, especially at night.

The stabilator (fully moving horizontal stabilizer) was mounted atop the fin to reduce inertia coupling. Because the vertical fin was only slightly shorter than the length of each wing and nearly as aerodynamically effective, it could act as a wing-on-rudder application, rolling the aircraft in the opposite direction of rudder input. To offset this effect, the wings were canted downward at a 10° negative-dihedral (anhedral) angle. This downward canting also improved roll control during high-G maneuvers, common in air-to-air combat.

The fuselage had a high fineness ratio. It was slender, tapered towards the sharp nose, and had a small frontal area. The tightly packed fuselage contained the radar, cockpit, cannon, fuel, landing gear, and engine. The fuselage and wing combination provided low drag except at high angle of attack (alpha), at which point induced drag became very high. The F-104 had good acceleration, rate of climb, and top speed, but its sustained turn performance was poor. A &quot;clean&quot; (no external weapons or fuel tanks) F-104 could sustain a 7-g turn below 5,000 feet with full afterburner. Given the aircraft&#x27;s prodigious fuel consumption at that altitude and relatively small fuel capacity, such a maneuver would dramatically reduce its time on station.

===Engine===
The F-104 was designed to use the General Electric J79 turbojet engine, fed by side-mounted intakes with fixed inlet cones optimized for performance at Mach 1.7 (increased to Mach 2 for later F-104s equipped with more powerful J79-GE-19 engines). Unlike some supersonic aircraft, the F-104 did not have variable-geometry inlets; instead at high Mach numbers excess air was bypassed around the engine. This bypass air also helped cool the engine. Its thrust-to-drag ratio was excellent, allowing a maximum speed well in excess of Mach 2. Available thrust was actually limited by the geometry of the inlet scoop and duct; the aircraft was capable of even higher Mach numbers if the aluminum skin of the aircraft were able to withstand the heating due to air friction. Furthermore, speeds above Mach 2 quickly overheated the J79 engine beyond its thermal capabilities, which resulted in the F-104 being given a design airspeed limitation of Mach 2.

The engine consisted of a 17-stage compressor, an accessory drive section, an annular combustion chamber, a three-stage turbine, and an afterburner. The most powerful version of the J79, the J79-GE-19, was rated at dry thrust and with afterburner. Bleed air from the compressor&#x27;s 17th stage was used for a number of purposes: the BLCS, cabin pressurization and air conditioning, hot-air jet rain removal, fuel transfer, canopy and windshield defogging and defrosting, pressure for the pilot&#x27;s anti-G suit, pressurization and cooling of the nose-mounted radar equipment, and purging of gas from the M61 autocannon. The accessory drive ran two hydraulic pumps, two variable-frequency generators, the generator for the tachometer, and pumps for engine fuel and oil.

===Armament===
The basic armament of the F-104 was the M61 Vulcan autocannon. As the first aircraft to carry the weapon, testing of the Starfighter revealed issues with the initial version of the M61: the Gatling-mechanism cannon suffered problems with its linked ammunition, being prone to misfeed and presenting a foreign object damage (FOD) hazard as discarded links were occasionally sucked into the engine. A linkless ammunition feed system was developed for the upgraded M61A1 installed in the F-104C; the M61A1 has subsequently been used by a wide variety of American combat aircraft.
The cannon, mounted in the lower part of the port fuselage, was fed by a 725-round drum behind the pilot&#x27;s seat. With its firing rate of 6,000 rounds per minute, the cannon would empty the drum after just over seven seconds of continuous fire. The cannon was omitted in all the two-seat models and some single-seat versions including reconnaissance aircraft, with the gun bay and ammunition drum typically replaced by additional fuel tanks.

Two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles could be carried on the wingtip stations, which could also be used for fuel tanks. The F-104C and later models added a centerline pylon and two underwing pylons for bombs, rocket pods, or fuel tanks; the centerline pylon could carry a nuclear weapon. A &quot;catamaran&quot; launcher for two additional Sidewinders could be fitted under the forward fuselage, although the installation had minimal ground clearance and so rendered the seeker heads of the missiles vulnerable to ground debris. The two F-104S variants added a pair of fuselage pylons beneath the intakes for conventional bomb carriage and an additional pylon under each wing, for a total of nine.

Early Starfighters were also capable of carrying and launching a single MB-1 (AIR-2A Genie) rocket-powered nuclear missile using an extending trapeze launcher. This configuration was tested on a single aircraft but was not adopted for service use; however, NASA later used it for launching test rockets.

===Avionics===
The initial USAF Starfighters had a basic RCA AN/ASG-14T1 ranging radar, tactical air navigation system (TACAN), and an AN/ARC-34 UHF radio. The AN/ASG-14 fire control system used a pencil-beam radar antenna with two independent sights: one optical and one infrared. Early versions of the radar had a range of approximately in search mode, with later models reaching up to ; the scan pattern was spiral, covering a 90-degree cone. Search mode was usable only above due to ground return effects below that altitude. Track mode was usable within of the target, which narrowed the scan to 20 degrees and initiated a strobe sweep between in auto-acquisition mode. The radar also had a third, receive-only mode useful for locking onto sources of interference from electronic countermeasures (ECM).

In the late 1960s, Lockheed developed a more advanced version of the Starfighter, the F-104S, for use by the Italian Air Force. Similarly to the F-104G, Lockheed produced two main variants of the F-104S: an all-weather interceptor (&quot;caccia intercettore&quot;, CI) and a strike aircraft (&quot;caccia bombardiere&quot;, CB). The CI variant received a FIAR/NASARR F15G radar with AIM-7 Sparrow guidance capability; however, the new missile-guidance avionics came at the expense of the M61A1 Vulcan cannon, which was removed to make room. The CB variant was equipped with a FIAR/NASARR R21G-H radar and a radar altimeter for low-level strike missions, retaining the cannon as its only air-to-air weapon.

As part of the &quot;Aggiornamento Sistema d&#x27;Arma&quot; (ASA), or &quot;Weapons System Upgrade&quot; in the mid-1980s, both variants were given an ALQ-70/72 ECM and a FIAR/NASARR R-21G/M1 radar with frequency hopping and look-down/shoot-down capability. The new radar and guidance systems enabled the aircraft to carry the new AIM-9L Sidewinder infrared-guided missile (replacing the older AIM-9B) as well as the AIM-7 Sparrow and the Selenia Aspide radar-guided missiles.

===Ejection seat===

Early Starfighters used a downward-firing ejection seat (the Stanley C-1), out of concern over the ability of an upward-firing seat to clear the &quot;T-tail&quot; empennage. This presented obvious problems in low-altitude escapes, and 21 USAF pilots, including test pilot Captain Iven Carl Kincheloe Jr., failed to escape from their stricken aircraft in low-level emergencies because of it. The downward-firing seat was replaced by the Lockheed C-2 upward-firing seat, which was capable of clearing the tail, but still had a minimum speed limitation of . Many export Starfighters were later retrofitted with Martin-Baker Mk.7 &quot;zero-zero&quot; (zero altitude and zero airspeed) ejection seats.

===Production assembly===
The Starfighter was designed for production rates of up to 20 airplanes per day from a single assembly line. The entire aircraft was designed for modular assembly and disassembly. The two principal fuselage sections were split along the vertical centerline and completely assembled in two separate halves. All equipment, including wiring and plumbing, was installed inside the two halves before being joined. The wings were then attached with ten bolts plus a fairing.

==Operational history==

===U.S. Air Force===

Although the F-104 was designed as an air-superiority fighter, the United States Air Force&#x27;s immediate need at the time was for a supersonic interceptor. In the late 1950s, the United States government believed it was significantly behind the USSR in terms of the size of its jet-powered bomber fleet. In response, the USAF had ordered two interceptors from Convair, the F-102 Delta Dagger and the F-106 Delta Dart, but both aircraft were experiencing long development delays. The Starfighter&#x27;s speed and rate-of-climb performance intrigued the Air Force, who pressed the F-104A into service as an interim interceptor with the Air Defense Command (ADC), even though its range and armament were not well-suited for the role. On 26 February 1958, the first unit to become operational with the F-104A was the 83rd Fighter Interceptor Squadron (FIS) at Hamilton AFB, California.

The newly operational aircraft experienced problems with both the J79 engine and M61 cannon, and after three months of service, the unit was grounded following a series of engine-related accidents. The aircraft were then fitted with the J79-GE-3B engine and another three ADC units were equipped with the F-104A. During this time, the Air Force&#x27;s interest in the Starfighter was waning due to a shift in strategy toward fighters with longer ranges and heavier ordnance loads. As a result, the USAF reduced their orders of the F-104A from 722 to 170, and the F-104A and F-104B aircraft of the 83rd, 56th and 337th FIS were handed over to the 151st, 157th and 197th FIS of the Air National Guard (ANG) after less than a year of service with the ADC.

====Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1958====

In August 1958, only a few months after establishing operational readiness with the F-104, the 83rd FIS was assigned to an air defense and deterrence mission in Taiwan after the People&#x27;s Republic of China began an intense artillery campaign against the Republic of China (ROC) on the disputed islands of Quemoy and Matsu. Tension between the two forces was high; artillery duels were ongoing since the first crisis in 1954 and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) had recently relocated 200 MiG-15s and MiG-17s to airfields on the mainland to fight against the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF). According to Colonel Howard &quot;Scrappy&quot; Johnson, one of the F-104 pilots deployed to Taiwan, the Starfighters&#x27; presence was so the PLAAF would &quot;track them on their radar screens ... and sit back and scratch their head in awe.&quot;
On 10 September, the first F-104s arrived in Taiwan, delivered disassembled by C-124 Globemaster II transport aircraft. This was the first time that air transport was used to move fighter aircraft long distances. Within 30 hours of arriving, First Lieutenant Crosley J. Fitton had the first of the 83rd&#x27;s airplanes in the air, and by 19 September the entire unit was ready for day or night alert status. The F-104 flew a number of supersonic runs between Taiwan and mainland China at speeds up to Mach 2 as an air-superiority demonstration, and though there were no direct enemy engagements prior to withdrawal after a ceasefire was agreed on 6 October, the Starfighter provided a significant deterrent effect. USAF Gen Laurence Kuter, commander-in-chief of the Pacific Air Forces, reported that the F-104A had &quot;made a tremendous impression on both sides of the Taiwan Strait&quot;.

====Berlin Crisis of 1961====
During the Berlin Crisis of 1961, President John F. Kennedy ordered 148,000 United States National Guard and reserve personnel to active duty on 30 August, in response to Soviet moves to cut off Allied access to Berlin. 21,067 individuals were from the ANG, forming 18 fighter squadrons, four reconnaissance squadrons, six transport squadrons, and a tactical control group. On 1 November 1961, the USAF mobilized three more ANG fighter interceptor squadrons. In late October and early November, eight of the tactical fighter units flew to Europe with their 216 aircraft in Operation Stair Step. Because of their short range, 60 F-104As were airlifted to Europe in late November, among them the 151st FIS and 157th FIS. As with the Taiwan crisis three years earlier, the Starfighter did not directly engage any enemy fighters, but its presence provided a powerful air-superiority deterrent; it demonstrated very quick reaction times and exemplary acceleration during practice intercepts, and proved superior to all other fighters in the theater. The crisis ended in the summer of 1962 and the ANG personnel returned to the United States, but the F-104&#x27;s solid performance helped convince the ADC to recall some F-104s back into active USAF service the following year.

====Vietnam War====

The F-104C entered service with USAF Tactical Air Command (TAC) as a multi-role fighter and fighter-bomber. The 479th Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW) at George AFB, California, was the first unit to be equipped with the type, in September 1958. Commencing with Operation Rolling Thunder, the Starfighter was used both in the air-superiority and air-support roles. On 19 April 1965 the 476th Tactical Fighter Squadron (TFS) of the 479th TFW arrived at Da Nang AB to help protect US F-105 Thunderchief fighter-bombers against MiG-17s and especially MiG-21s that were beginning to be flown by the Vietnamese People&#x27;s Air Force (VPAF). The F-104 was also deployed extensively as a barrier combat air patrol (BARCAP) protector for the EC-121D Warning Star airborne early warning aircraft patrolling off the North Vietnamese coast. The F-104s were successful in deterring MiG interceptors and performed well as close support aircraft, though they were largely uninvolved in aerial combat and recorded no air-to-air kills during the conflict. The North Vietnamese were well aware of the F-104&#x27;s performance, and the 479th TFW&#x27;s pilots felt that the MiGs deliberately avoided engaging them. Twenty-five MiG kills were scored by fighters controlled by EC-121 Big Eye missions, and their Starfighter escorts played a vital role in ensuring their safety.

From the first F-104 deployment in April 1965 to December, Starfighters flew a total of 2,937 combat sorties. These sorties resulted in the loss of five aircraft, one from the 476th TFS, which deployed from April to July 1965, and four from the 436th Tactical Fighter Squadron, which deployed from July to October 1965. One incident on 20 September claimed three F-104s when Captain Philip E. Smith strayed into Chinese airspace and was shot down by a Chinese Shenyang J-6; two more collided in mid-air while searching for Smith&#x27;s missing jet. No losses were reported from the 435th Tactical Fighter Squadron&#x27;s first deployment from October to December 1965.

Starfighters returned to Vietnam when the 435th Tactical Fighter Squadron re-deployed from June 1966 until August 1967. During this time F-104s flew a further 2,269 combat sorties, for a total of 5,206. F-104s operating in Vietnam were upgraded in service with AN/APR-25/26 radar warning receiver equipment. One such example is on display in the Air Zoo in Kalamazoo, Michigan. During the second deployment, an additional nine aircraft were lost for a total of 14 F-104s lost to all causes in Vietnam. In July 1967, the Starfighter units transitioned to the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II.

In 1967, these TAC aircraft were transferred to the Air National Guard.


====North American service====

By the late 1950s, USAF fighter doctrine had shifted away from air superiority (fighter against fighter combat) and placed more importance on the interceptor (fighter against bomber combat) and tactical fighter-bomber roles. The F-104 was deemed inadequate for either, lacking both payload capability and endurance in comparison with other USAF aircraft. As a result, the USAF procured only 296 Starfighters, including both single-seat and two-seat versions. During Operation Power Pack, USAF F-104s were deployed to Ramey Air Force Base to protect the American supply line against potential Soviet-supplied Cuban MiGs. Twelve F-104s were sent to Puerto Rico, where they remained until 3 June 1965. The F-104&#x27;s service with the USAF was quickly wound down after the aircraft&#x27;s second deployment to southeast Asia in 1967. Although the remaining F-104As in regular USAF service had been recently fitted with more powerful and reliable J79-GE-19 engines, the last USAF Starfighters left regular Air Force service in 1969. The aircraft continued in use with the Puerto Rico Air National Guard until 1975 when it was replaced by the A-7 Corsair II.

The last use of the F-104 Starfighter in US markings was training pilots for the West German Air Force, with a wing of TF-104Gs and F-104Gs based at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. Although operated in USAF markings, these aircraft (which included German-built aircraft) were owned by West Germany. They continued in use until 1983.

=== Pakistan Air Force ===
In 1961, Pakistan, as a major non-NATO ally, received under the Mutual Assistance Program 14 Starfighters (twelve model F-104A and two dual-seat model F-104B). These were fitted with C-2 upward firing ejection seats, AN/ASG-14T1 fire control systems, more powerful General Electric J79-11A engines and the M-61 Vulcans were also re-fitted on PAF&#x27;s request. Moreover, an F-104B was modified by the PAF to carry Swedish TA-7M reconnaissance cameras in the back seat, other than that a single F-104A was modified to carry Radar homing devices like the Radar Locator (RALOR) and Short-range Low Altitude Radar Detection (SLARD). The No. 9 Squadron &quot;Griffins&quot; was the only PAF squadron to be equipped with these Starfighters.

The PAF also provided F-104 instructors to Jordan in order to train their pilots on the aircraft after the Royal Jordanian Air Force started receiving its Starfighters in 1968. One of the Jordanian pilots, Major Ihsan Shurdom, later rose to command the RJAF.

The Starfighter served with the PAF from 1961 until 1972 when lack of spare parts due to post-war US sanctions led to an early retirement.

==== Rann of Kutch Conflict ====

During the Rann of Kutch crisis in April 1965, a detachment of two Griffin F-104s was deployed at Mauripur Base under the command of Squadron Leader Middlecoat.

An F-104 flown by Farooq Umar also assisted the Army&#x27;s 24th Cavalry, 15th Frontier Force and 15th Punjab regiments in capturing &quot;Biar Bet&quot; from Indian forces.

Later in June, PAF F-104s forced an Indian Dassault Ouragan which had intruded into Pakistani airspace to make a forced landing at Jangshahi Village near Badin.

==== Indo-Pakistani war of 1965 ====

PAF F-104s were deployed in a variety of roles during the 1965 war. These included Air defence, high altitude interceptions, night fighter, reconnaissance etc.

In the opening rounds of the war on 1 September, Flight Lt. Farooq Umar on the orders of PAF&#x27;s C-in-C &quot;Air Marshal Nur Khan&quot;, executed two sonic booms in his F-104 over the enemy airbase at Amritsar. This was done in order to harass the Indian Air Force (IAF) as a sign of dominance.

On 3 September 1965, two Griffin F-104As flown by Flying Officer Abbas Mirza and Flight Lieutenant Hakimullah intercepted 6 IAF Folland Gnats over Akhnur which had attacked a lone F-86 Sabre. While the Sabre managed to return to base despite sustaining heavy damage, the Starfighters made supersonic passes near the Indian Gnats which resultantly spread panic amongst the IAF pilots. In the ensuing chaos, Squadron Ldr. Brij Pal Singh Sikand landed his Gnat F.1 at an abandoned Pakistani airstrip at Pasrur.

The F-104s first air to air combat victory was achieved by the PAF on the morning of 6 September 1965, when a pair of Griffin F-104As flown by Flight Lieutenant Aftab Alam Khan and Flight Lieutenant Amjad Hussain Khan were vectored towards 4 Indian Dassault Mystere IVs that were attacking a passenger train at Ghakhar Station. While Flight Lt. Amjad aborted due to radio failure, Flight Lt. Aftab went ahead with the interception and shot down a Mystere IV with an AIM-9B while damaging another with his M-61 Vulcan. The kill with an AIM-9B Sidewinder is claimed by the PAF as the first combat kill by any Mach 2 aircraft and the PAF&#x27;s first missile kill, though the IAF denies the loss.

On 7 September 1965, a Griffin F-104A flown by Flight Lt. Amjad Hussein Khan intercepted six Indian Dassault Mysteres which were attacking the Sargodha Airbase. While 5 of the Indian Mysteres managed to escape, a fierce dogfight ensued between Flight Lt. Amjad&#x27;s F-104 &amp; Squadron Ldr. Devaiah&#x27;s Mystere. Amjad fired an AIM-9B but it missed and hit the ground so he switched to his M-61 cannon and after some attempts, managed to score several hits on Devaiah&#x27;s Mystere. However, due to high-G maneuvering, Amjad&#x27;s F-104 was forced into a low speed dogfight by a determined Devaiah (something which the F-104 performs badly in due to its poor low speed maneuverability and agility.) This forced Amjad to ram his F-104 into the Mystere. The mid-air collision resulted in both pilots losing control of their warplanes. While Flight Lt. Amjad managed to eject safely over Kot Nakka, the Indian pilot perished with his Mystere.

On 13 September 1965, Middlecoat fired an AIM-9 at an IAF Canberra bomber during a night interception. An explosion was reported at around 4000 ft but confirmation was not possible.

On 21 September 1965, Squadron Leader Jamal while flying a Griffin F-104A intercepted a high flying IAF English Electric Canberra at night and shot it down with an AIM-9 near Fazilka over Pakistani airspace.

In total, Griffin F-104s flew 246 hours and 45 minutes during the 1965 war, 204 day sorties and 42 night missions.

==== Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 ====
The commencement of hostilities in 1971 led to PAF deploying its small fleet of F-104s heavily in Air to Air and Ground Attack roles. Surplus F-104As and F-104Bs were also received from Jordan. 
; Ground Attack
In early December 1971, PAF launched Operation Chengiz Khan (inspired from Israel&#x27;s Operation Focus) after a series of invasions by Indian forces in East Pakistan. As part of these preemptive strikes, the Starfighters were employed particularly in attacks on various Indian radar stations.

On 3 December 1971, a formation of two Starfighters attacked the IAF Radar station at Amritsar.

On 4 December 1971, Squadron leaders Amanullah and Rashid Bhatti flying F-104As again struck the IAF&#x27;s Amritsar radar without any significant results due to heavy Anti-Aircraft fire.

On 11 December, two F-104As piloted by Wing Commander Arif Iqbal Squadron Leader M. Amanullah struck the Indian airbase of Uttarlai during which Squadron Ldr. Amanullah destroyed an HF-24 parked on the tarmac with his M-61 cannon while Flight Lt. Arif Iqbal strafed another HF-24 which was trying to take off from the airbase.

;Air to Air Combat

On 4 December 1971, a Folland Gnat and Sukhoi Su-7 were shot down after they confronted a formation of two PAF Starfighters attacking the Amritsar radar.

On 8 December, an F-104 piloted by Flight Lieutenant Manzoor Bokhari intercepted a Canberra bomber and shot it down.

On 10 December, an F-104 flown by Wing Commander Arif Iqbal shot down an Indian Navy Bréguet 1050 Alizé while attacking the Okha Port.

On the morning of 12 December, the first direct air-to-air combat engagement between an F-104 and a MiG-21 took place when OC No. 9 Squadron, Middlecoat along with his wingman Tariq Habib while performing airstrikes on the IAF&#x27;s Jamnagar Airbase were bounced by two Indian Mig-21FLs of the No. 47 Squadron. While the F-104 formation was returning to Pakistani territory, one of the Mig-21s fired a K-13 missile at Mervyn&#x27;s F-104. Though he managed to dodge it with evasive maneuvers, a second missile was fired at a range of 300 meters this time hitting his Starfighter. Middlecoat was seen ejecting over the Gulf of Kutch however the Indian vessels dispatched to capture him claimed he was never found. The PAF initially declared him MIA but was later declared KIA and posthumously awarded a Bar to Sitara-e-Jurat.

The second F-104 loss occurred several days later on 17 December when a pair of Jordanian loaned Starfighters on combat air patrol near Hyderabad intercepted two Mig-21s which had intruded Pakistani airspace. The wingman, Flight Lieutenant Samad Ali Changezi engaged one of the Mig-21s and managed to get behind its tail. Unknown to him the second Mig-21 had sneaked up behind him and had fired a K-13 missile which had missed. His leader tried warning him but to no avail. As Changezi was about to shoot the Mig-21 down, a second K-13 was fired by the pursuing IAF Mig-21 which slammed into his F-104. The Starfighter went down over Mirpur Khas along with its pilot. Changezi was posthumously awarded the Sitara-e-Jurat in honor of his wartime service.
The IAF also claims two additional PAF Starfighter kills that same day including Squadron Leader Rashid Bhatti&#x27;s Starfighter. However, the PAF said he returned without damage to Masroor AFB.

===1967 Taiwan Strait Conflict===

On 13 January 1967, four ROCAF F-104G aircraft engaged a formation of J-6/MiG-19s of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force over the disputed island of Kinmen (Quemoy). Major Hu Shih-lin and Captain Shih Bei-puo each shot down one MiG-19. One F-104 did not return to base and its pilot was listed as missing in action.

F-104 designer Kelly Johnson stated that this particular battle illustrated the relative strengths and weaknesses of the Starfighter in aerial combat. &quot;We had them on acceleration and we had them on steady-state altitude, but we could not turn with them,&quot; said Johnson, who at the time was working on the larger-winged, more-maneuverable CL-1200 Lancer derivative of the F-104.

===Other international service===

At the same time that the F-104 was falling out of U.S. favor, the West German Air Force was looking for a multi-role combat aircraft to operate in support of a missile defense system. In response, Lockheed reworked the Starfighter from a fair-weather fighter into an all-weather ground-attack, reconnaissance, and interceptor aircraft, and presented it as the F-104G. The redesigned aircraft was chosen over the English Electric P.1 (later the Lightning), Grumman F11F-1F Super Tiger, Vought F-8 Crusader and Republic F-105 Thunderchief. Ten other aircraft types, including the F-102, F-106, Saunders-Roe SR.177, and the Saab 35 Draken, were also considered but discarded earlier in the process. The F-104G was ultimately chosen because the other two finalists were still in the development phase while the F-104 was about to be introduced into USAF service; although the American version lacked all-weather capability, Lockheed promised they could deliver this, and favorable reports by the German Ministry of Defence delegation sent in December 1957 to flight-test the F-104 tipped the scales in the Starfighter&#x27;s favor.

The Starfighter found a new market with other NATO countries as well, and eventually more than 2,000 of all variants of the F-104 were built for international air forces. Several countries received their aircraft under the U.S. government-funded Military Aid Program (MAP). The American engine was retained but built under license in Europe, Canada, and Japan. The Lockheed ejector seats were retained initially but were replaced in some countries by the safer Martin-Baker seat.

The so-called &quot;Deal of the Century&quot; produced substantial income for Lockheed, but the resulting bribery scandals caused considerable political controversy in Europe and Japan. In 1976, a United States Senate investigating committee led by Senator Frank Church determined that Lockheed had paid US$22 million in bribes to foreign officials during the negotiation processes for the sale of its aircraft, including the F-104 Starfighter. In Germany, Minister of Defence Franz Josef Strauss was accused of having received at least US$10 million for West Germany&#x27;s purchase of the F-104 in 1961. On 26 August 1976, Prince-consort Bernhard of the Netherlands was forced to resign as Inspector-General of the Dutch Armed Forces after being accused of accepting approximately US$1.1 million in bribes.

In the Netherlands, the F-104 was used to aid in the ending of the 1977 Dutch train hijacking. On 11 June 1977, almost three weeks after the start of a hijacking of a train by Moluccan separatists, six F-104 jet fighters of the Royal Netherlands Air Force overflew the train three times at low altitude, using their afterburners to disorient the hijackers as a precursor to an armed attack by Dutch marines. None of the Starfighters used its weapons.

The international service of the F-104 began to wind down in the late 1970s, being replaced in many cases by the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, but it remained in service with some air forces for another two decades. The last operational Starfighters served with the Italian Air Force, which retired them on 31 October 2004.

===NASA===
The Starfighter served with NASA from 1956 until 1994. A total of 12 F-104A, F-104B, F-104N, and TF-104G aircraft performed high-speed and altitude flight research at Dryden Flight Research Center. The F-104 also performed many safety chase missions in support of advanced research aircraft and provided a launch platform for sounding rockets.

In August 1956, the USAF transferred YF-104A serial number 55–2961 to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, the predecessor of NASA), designating it NF-104A. In preparation for the X-15 test program of the late 1950s, it was fitted with the reaction control system (RCS) consisting of hydrogen peroxide-powered thrusters mounted in the aircraft&#x27;s nose and wingtips. This system provided valuable experience for future X-15 pilots and astronauts in spacecraft control and maneuverability. The trials began in 1959 and concluded in 1961, after which the aircraft was used for other NASA purposes until it was retired in November 1975.

An F-104B, originally USAF 57-1303 later received civil registry as N819NA, NASA 819. It became the longest-serving NASA F-104 in both calendar time (1958–1978) and flight hours. Its credits include being the first aircraft in history to perform manned testing of a ballute at supersonic speed. It was also the first to test piloted landings of vehicles such as the X-15 and lifting bodies with the pilot using only stereo periscopic vision. It was used extensively for biomedical research, evaluation of new full pressure suits, and general utility duties for NASA research. One notable case was its service as the final chase plane for the official FAI world altitude record flight of the #3 X-15.

Between August and October 1963, Lockheed delivered three single-seat F-104G Starfighters to NASA, designated F-104N, for use as high-speed chase aircraft. These were the only Starfighters built by Lockheed specifically for NASA; all other NASA aircraft were transferred from the USAF. The third of these F-104Ns, number 013, was destroyed on 8 June 1966 in a mid-air collision with a North American XB-70 during a publicity photo flight for General Electric.

One NASA F-104G, registration N826NA, was equipped with a flight test fixture (FTF) consisting of a pylon mounted on the fuselage centerline. The FTF contained instruments to record and transmit research data in real-time to engineers in mission control at Dryden. One application of the FTF was testing heat-resistant tiles for use on the Space Shuttle, ensuring their bonding was sufficient at high speeds and evaluating their performance when exposed to moisture. The last of these missions flew on 31 January 1994, bringing the F-104&#x27;s service with NASA to a close after more than 18,000 flights.

=== Use as space launch platform ===
In 2011, 4Frontiers Corporation and Starfighters Inc (a private F-104 operator) began working together on a project to launch suborbital sounding rockets from F-104s flying out of Kennedy Space Center. First launches were expected to occur in 2012.
In early 2016, another venture, CubeCab, was working on a rocket system that would launch CubeSats from F-104s. The company said it planned to begin providing launch services &quot;in early 2020&quot;.

===World records===
The F-104 was the first aircraft to simultaneously hold the world speed and altitude records. On 7 May 1958, USAF Major Howard C. Johnson, flying YF-104A 55–2957, broke the world flight altitude record for jet aircraft by flying to over Edwards AFB. On 16 May 1958, USAF Captain Walter W. Irwin, flying YF-104A 55–2969, set a world flight airspeed record of over a course long at Edwards AFB. Flying F-104A 56–0762 over NAS Point Mugu, California, USAF Lieutenants William T. Smith and Einar Enevoldson set several time-to-climb records on 13 and 14 December 1958:

On 14 December 1959, USAF Captain &quot;Joe&quot; B. Jordan, flying F-104C 56–0885 at Edwards AFB, set a new world altitude record of , in the process becoming the first aircraft to take off under its own power and cross both the 30,000-meter and 100,000-foot thresholds. He also set a time-to-climb record of 904.92 seconds. USAF Major Robert W. Smith, flying NF-104A 56–0756, set an unofficial world altitude record of on 15 November 1963, and on 6 December 1963 he flew the same aircraft to another unofficial altitude record of .

Jacqueline Cochran, a lieutenant colonel in the United States Air Force Reserve, flew TF-104G N104L to set three women&#x27;s world&#x27;s speed records: On 11 May 1964, she averaged over a course, on 1 June she flew at an average speed of over a closed-circuit course, and on 3 June she recorded an average speed of over a closed-circuit course.

Lockheed test pilot Darryl Greenamyer built an F-104 out of parts he had collected. The aircraft, N104RB, first flew in 1976. On 2 October of that year, trying to set a new low-altitude speed record, Greenamyer averaged at Mud Lake near Tonopah, Nevada. A tracking camera malfunction eliminated the necessary proof for the official record. On 24 October 1977, Greenamyer flew a official FAI record flight of .

On 26 February 1978, Greenamyer made a practice run for a world altitude record attempt. At the conclusion of the practice run, he was unable to get an indication that the right landing gear was down and locked even after a number of attempts to cycle the gear. Low on fuel and faced with a landing situation that was not considered survivable, Greenamyer successfully ejected, and the N104RB crashed in the desert.

===Nicknames===
The Starfighter was marketed by Lockheed as the &quot;missile with a man in it&quot;, and the press dubbed the F-104 the &quot;Widowmaker&quot; due to its high accident rate, but neither were used in service. The term &quot;Super Starfighter&quot; was used by Lockheed to describe the F-104G in its marketing campaigns, but quickly fell into disuse.

In service, it earned a number of nicknames among its users:
*American pilots initially called it the &quot;Oh-Four&quot;, but when the F-100 Super Sabre began to be referred to as the &quot;Zip-Zilch&quot; (for &quot;zero-zero&quot;), the Starfighter acquired the similar nickname &quot;Zip-Four&quot;; this was eventually shortened to &quot;Zipper&quot; or &quot;Zip&quot;. Over time this nickname came to be associated with the aircraft&#x27;s impressive speed and acceleration.
*The Japan Air Self-Defense Force called it (Kanji: , &quot;glory&quot;).
*Although German pilots often referred to the F-104 as the &quot;Zipper&quot; or (specifically the G models) &quot;Gustav&quot;, it earned several less-charitable names from the German public due to its high accident rate, common ones being (&quot;widowmaker&quot;) or (&quot;flying coffin&quot;). It was also called (&quot;ground nail&quot;), the official military term for a tent peg. 
*Prior to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the reputation of the Pakistani F-104 was such that the Indian Air Force referred to it as &quot;Badmash&quot; (&quot;hooligan&quot;), &quot;Scoundrel&quot;, and &quot;Wicked One&quot;.
*Among Italian pilots its spiky design earned it the nickname (&quot;hatpin&quot;).
*Among the Norwegian public and Royal Norwegian Air Force it was affectionately known as (&quot;the Vestfjord bull&quot;), due to the immense roar of the aircraft based in Bodø, at the southern end of Vestfjorden.
*In the Canadian Forces, the aircraft was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Lawn Dart&quot; and the &quot;Aluminium Death Tube&quot; due to its high operational losses, and &quot;Flying Phallus&quot; due to its shape. It was affectionately called the &quot;Silver Sliver&quot;, &quot;Zipper&quot;, or &quot;Zip&quot;, but most often the &quot;Starfighter&quot; or simply the &quot;104&quot; (one-oh-four).
*NASA&#x27;s F-104B Starfighter N819NA acquired the nickname &quot;Howling Howland&quot; due to the unique howling sound of its engine at certain throttle settings.

== Flying characteristics ==
The Starfighter was the first combat aircraft capable of sustained Mach 2 flight, and its speed and climb performance remained impressive more than thirty years after its first flight. Equipped with razor-edge thin-blade supersonic wings (visible from the cockpit only in the mirrors), it was designed for optimum performance above Mach 1.2. If used appropriately, with high-speed surprise attacks and good use of its exceptional thrust-to-weight ratio, it could be a formidable opponent. It was exceptionally stable at high speed, i.e., over , at very low level, making it a potent tactical nuclear strike-fighter. However, in a low-speed turning contest with conventional subsonic opponents (as Pakistani pilots were with Indian Mystères in 1965), the fighter was vulnerable. The F-104&#x27;s large turn radius was due to the high speeds required for maneuvering, and its high-alpha stalling and pitch-up behavior required attentiveness from its pilot. In reference to the F-104&#x27;s low-speed turn performance, a humorous colloquialism was coined by a pilot in the skies over Edwards Air Force Base: &quot;Banking with intent to turn.&quot;

Takeoff speeds were between , with the pilot needing to swiftly raise the landing gear to avoid exceeding the maximum landing gear operating speed of . Climb and cruise performance were outstanding; occasionally a &quot;slow&quot; light would illuminate on the instrument panel at around Mach 2 to indicate that the engine compressor was nearing its limiting temperature and the pilot needed to throttle back. Landings were also performed at high speed: the downwind leg of the circuit was typically flown at approximately with flaps in landing configuration, with the long, flat final approach flown at around and touchdown at . Extra fuel, crosswinds or gusts, external stores, and other considerations could add up to to these speeds. Unlike most aircraft, the F-104 was landed with the engine at high power, as the boundary-layer control system lost effectiveness below approximately 82% engine speed. Pilots were instructed not to cut the throttle while the plane was still airborne, as doing so would cause an abrupt (and generally uneven) loss of lift. To limit the Starfighter&#x27;s landing roll, or distance traveled while decelerating from touchdown to taxi speed, powerful brakes were combined with a drag chute.

===Early problems===

The F-104 series all had a very high wing loading (made even higher when carrying external stores). During the early stall tests, the aircraft demonstrated the tendency to suddenly &quot;pitch up&quot; once it reached an angle of attack of approximately 15 degrees. This &quot;pitch up&quot; would result in a rapid increase in angle of attack to approximately 60 degrees, accompanied by lateral and directional oscillation, and followed by sudden uncontrolled yaw and roll. At this point the aircraft would be essentially tumbling, descending at a rate of . To combat this, an automatic pitch control (APC) was added, which initiated corrective action at the proper time to prevent reaching an angle of attack high enough to cause pitch-up under any operating condition. The high angle of attack area of flight was protected by a stick shaker system to warn the pilot of an approaching stall, and if this was ignored, a stick pusher system would pitch the aircraft&#x27;s nose down to a safer angle of attack; this was often overridden by the pilot despite flight manual warnings against this practice.

Another serious design issue that the aircraft encountered was T-tail flutter. Dick Heppe, who served as the initial project aerodynamics engineer for the F-104 program, recalled that &quot;without question, the single most difficult technical challenge encountered in the XF-104 and F-104A development programs was the catastrophic flutter problem of the unique T-tailed empennage configuration&quot;. Because the horizontal tail&#x27;s center of gravity was well aft of both the bending and torsional axes of the vertical tail to which it was attached, it was highly vulnerable to flutter at transonic speeds. During a test flight of the F-104A, the surviving XF-104 was flying chase to observe, and encountered violent T-tail flutter that caused the tail to separate from the aircraft. The test pilot of the XF-104 successfully ejected. This behavior was remedied by increasing the thickness of the stainless-steel box covers used in the tail assembly.

The J79 was a brand-new engine, with development continuing throughout the YF-104A test phase and during service with the F-104A. The engine featured variable-incidence compressor stator blades, a design feature that altered the angle of the stator blades automatically with altitude and temperature. A condition known as &quot;T-2 reset&quot;, a normal function that made large stator blade angle changes, caused several engine failures on takeoff. It was discovered that large and sudden temperature changes (e.g., from being parked in the sun prior to becoming airborne) were falsely causing the engine stator blades to close and choke the compressor. The dangers presented by these engine failures were compounded by the downward ejection seat, which gave the pilot little chance of a safe exit at low level. The engine systems were subsequently modified and the ejection seat changed to the more conventional upward type.

Uncontrolled oscillations of its wingtip-mounted fuel tank sheared one wing off of an F-104B; this problem was apparent during testing of the XF-104 prototype and was eventually resolved by filling the tank compartments in a specific order.

Early F-104s also lacked modulated afterburning, and as a result combat operations could only be performed at one of only two settings either maximum military power or full afterburner. Effectively this gave the pilot the choice of two level-flight speeds: Mach 1 or Mach 2.2.

===Later problems===
A further engine problem was that of uncommanded opening of the variable-thrust nozzle (usually through loss of engine oil pressure, as the nozzles were actuated using engine oil as hydraulic fluid); although the engine would be running normally at high power, the opening of the nozzle resulted in a drastic loss of thrust to below that required to maintain level flight. At low altitudes this was unrecoverable, and it caused the loss of at least seven F-104s during testing. A modification program installed a manual nozzle closure control that reduced the problem, but according to designer Kelly Johnson, this took nine years to resolve satisfactorily.

The engine also suffered from afterburner blowout on takeoff, or even non-ignition, resulting in a major loss of thrust that could be detected by the pilot—the recommended action was to abandon the takeoff. The first fatal accident in German service was caused by this phenomenon. Some pilots experienced uncommanded &quot;stick kicker&quot; activation at low altitudes while flying straight and level, so F-104 crews were often directed to deactivate it for flight operations. Asymmetric or &quot;split&quot; flap deployment was another frequent cause of accidents. Many pilots also experienced severe nose wheel &quot;shimmy&quot; on landing, which usually resulted in the aircraft leaving the runway and in some cases even flipping over onto its back.

===West German service===

The introduction of a highly technical aircraft type to a newly reformed air force was fraught with problems. Many pilots and ground crew had settled into civilian jobs after World War II and had not kept pace with developments, with pilots being sent on short &quot;refresher&quot; courses in slow and benign-handling first-generation jet aircraft. Ground crew were similarly employed with minimal training and experience, which was one consequence of a conscripted military with high turnover of service personnel. Operating in the poor weather conditions of northwest Europe (unlike the fair weather training conditions at Luke AFB in Arizona) and flying low at high speed over hilly terrain, many accidents were attributed to controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). A total of 116 pilots were lost in West German F-104 accidents, including 1 ground-crew passenger and 8 USAF instructors.

One contributing factor to this was the operational assignment of the F-104 in West German service: it was mainly used as a low-level fighter-bomber, as opposed to the original design of a high-speed, high-altitude fighter/interceptor. Furthermore, the installation of additional avionic equipment in the F-104G version, such as the inertial navigation system, added distraction for the pilot, as well as extra weight that further hampered the flying capabilities of the plane. In contemporary West German magazine articles highlighting the Starfighter safety problems, the aircraft was portrayed as &quot;overburdened&quot; with technology, which was considered a latent overstrain on the aircrews.

In 1966 Johannes Steinhoff took over command of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and grounded the entire &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and &quot;Bundesmarine&quot; F-104 fleet until he was satisfied that problems had been resolved or at least reduced. In later years, the safety record improved, although a new problem of structural failure of the wings emerged. Original fatigue calculations had not taken into account the high number of g-force loading cycles that the F-104 fleet was experiencing, and many airframes were returned to the depot for wing replacement or outright retirement. Towards the end of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; service, some aircraft were modified to carry a flight data recorder or &quot;black box&quot;, which could give an indication of the probable cause of an accident.

Erich Hartmann, the world&#x27;s top-scoring fighter ace, commanded one of West Germany&#x27;s first post-war jet-fighter-equipped wings and deemed the F-104 to be an unsafe aircraft with poor handling characteristics for aerial combat. In Navy service it lacked the safety margin of a twin-engine design such as the Blackburn Buccaneer. To the dismay of his superiors, Hartmann judged the fighter unfit for &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; use even before its introduction.

Eric Brown described the Starfighter as a hot ship, that &quot;has to be flown every inch of the way&quot;. The USAF required Starfighter pilots to have at least 1,500 flight hours of experience prior to flying the F-104. West German pilots had around 400 hours. Brown recommended the Blackburn Buccaneer instead.

===Normal operating hazards===
The causes of a large number of aircraft losses were the same as for any other similar type. They included: bird strikes and other foreign object damage (particularly to the engine), lightning strikes, pilot spatial disorientation, and mid-air collisions with other aircraft. One such accident occurred on 19 June 1962 when a formation of four F-104F aircraft, practicing for the type&#x27;s introduction-into-service ceremony the following day, crashed together after descending through a cloud bank. The pilot of the lead aircraft lost spatial orientation and was at too steep a nose-down angle to recover. Three German pilots and one American pilot were killed, and the four aircraft destroyed. As a result, formation aerobatic teams were immediately banned by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;.

=== Safety record ===
The safety record of the F-104 Starfighter became high-profile news in the mid-1960s, especially in West Germany. West Germany initially ordered 309 F-104s, and over time another 607. Deliveries of Lockheed-built aircraft started in August 1961, and domestically produced airframes began to roll off the assembly lines in December. That same month, the first of an eventual total of 292 West German F-104s had crashed. In October 1975, Lockheed agreed to pay a total of 3 million Deutsche Marks (US$1.2 million) to approximately 60 widows and dependents of 32 &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; pilots killed during flight operations, though the company declined to admit liability. While announcing the settlement, the plaintiffs&#x27; attorney acknowledged he had been seeking US$10 million and noted that there were more instances of pilot error than he had expected.
Some operators lost a large proportion of their aircraft through accidents, although the accident rate varied widely depending on the user and operating conditions. The German Air Force and Federal German Navy, the largest combined user of the F-104 and operator of over 35% of all airframes built, lost approximately 32% of its Starfighters in accidents over the aircraft&#x27;s 31-year career. The Belgian Air Force, on the other hand, lost 41 of its 100 airframes between February 1963 and September 1983, and Italy, the final Starfighter operator, lost 138 of 368 (37%) by 1992. Canada&#x27;s accident rate with the F-104 ultimately exceeded 46% (110 of 238) over its 25-year service history, though the Canadian jets tended to be flown for a greater number of hours than those of other air forces (three times that of the German F-104s, for example). However, some operators had substantially lower accident rates: Denmark&#x27;s attrition rate for the F-104 was 24%, with Japan losing just 15% and Norway 14% (6 of 43) of their respective Starfighter fleets. The best accident rate was achieved by the Spanish Air Force, which ended its Starfighter era with a perfect safety record: the Ejército del Aire lost none of its 18 F-104Gs and 3 TF-104Gs over a total of seven years and 17,500 flight hours.

The cumulative destroyed rate of the F-104 Starfighter in USAF service as of 31 December 1983 was 25.2 aircraft destroyed per 100,000 flight hours. This is the highest accident rate of any of the USAF Century Series fighters. By comparison, the cumulative destroyed rates for the other Century Series aircraft in USAF service over the same time period were 16.2 for the North American F-100 Super Sabre, 9.7 for the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, 15.6 for the Republic F-105 Thunderchief, and 7.3 for the Convair F-106 Delta Dart. By comparison, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) experienced an overall loss rate of 11.96 per 100,000 flying hours with the Dassault Mirage III, losing 40 of 116 aircraft to accidents over its 25-year career from 1965 to 1989. The Royal Air Force lost over 50 of 280 English Electric Lightnings, at one point experiencing 12 losses in the 17 months between January 1970 and May 1971; the loss rate per 100,000 hours from the introduction of the Lightning in 1961 to May 1971 was 17.3, higher than the lifetime West German Starfighter loss rate of 15.08.

Notable USAF pilots who died in F-104 accidents include Major Robert H. Lawrence Jr. and Captain Iven Kincheloe. Civilian (former USAAF) pilot Joe Walker died in a midair collision with an XB-70 Valkyrie while flying an F-104. Chuck Yeager was nearly killed in December 1963 when he lost control of an NF-104A during a high-altitude record-breaking attempt; he lost the tips of two fingers and was hospitalized for a long period with severe burns after ejecting from the aircraft.

==Variants==


;XF-104: This was the prototype aircraft; two examples were built and powered by Wright J65 engines (the J79 was not yet ready). The second prototype was equipped with the M61 cannon as an armament test bed. Both aircraft were destroyed in crashes.
;YF-104A: The YF-104A was a pre-production aircraft used for engine, equipment, and flight testing; 17 were built, with the first flight taking place on 17 February 1956 and reaching Mach 2 for the first time on 27 April.
;F-104A: This aircraft was the initial production single-seat interceptor version, very similar to the YF-104A. A total of 153 were built. The F-104A was in USAF service from 1958 through 1960, then transferred to the Air National Guard until 1963. At that time they were recalled by the USAF Air Defense Command for the 319th and 331st Fighter Interceptor Squadrons. Some were released for export to Jordan, Pakistan, and Taiwan, each of which used it in combat. The 319th F-104As and Bs had their engines replaced in 1967 with the J79-GE-19, which provided of thrust in afterburner; the service ceiling with this engine was in excess of . In 1969, all the F-104A/Bs in ADC service were retired. On 16 May 1958, an F-104A flown by USAF Captain Walter W. Irwin set a world flight airspeed record of .
;NF-104A: The NF-104A was used for three demilitarized versions with an additional Rocketdyne LR121/AR-2-NA-1 rocket engine, used for astronaut training at altitudes up to .
;QF-104A: A total of 24 F-104As (4 YF-104As, 20 early F-104As) were converted into radio-controlled drones and test aircraft. These target drones were able to be flown by onboard pilots as well as remotely controlled by pilots using radio-control equipment either on the ground or flying in other aircraft.
;F-104B: The F-104B was a tandem two-seat, dual-control trainer version of the F-104A. A total of 26 built, the F-104B had an enlarged rudder and ventral fin, no cannon, and reduced internal fuel, but was otherwise combat-capable. A few were supplied to Jordan, Pakistan, and Taiwan.
;F-104C: A fighter-bomber for USAF Tactical Air Command, the F-104C had improved fire-control radar (AN/ASG-14T-2), one centerline and two pylons under each wing (for a total of five), and the ability to carry one Mk 28 or Mk 43 nuclear weapon on the centerline pylon. The F-104C also had in-flight refueling capability. Seventy-seven F-104Cs were built. On 14 December 1959, an F-104C set a world altitude record of .
;F-104D: The F-104D designation was a dual-control trainer version of the F-104C. Twenty-one examples were built.
;F-104DJ: This aircraft was a dual-control trainer version of the F-104J for the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). Lockheed built 20 F-104DJs, assembling the first at their Burbank facility, and shipping the remaining 19 to Japan for assembly by Mitsubishi and Kawasaki. After their retirement in Japan, the United States delivered some these F-104J/DJs to the Taiwanese Air Force.
;F-104F: The F-104F designation was given to a dual-control trainer based on the F-104D, but using the upgraded engine of the F-104G. It had no radar, and was not combat-capable. The F-104F was produced as an interim trainer for the German Air Force. All 30 F-104F aircraft were retired by 1972.

;F-104G: The F-104G was the most-produced version of the F-104 family, a multi-role fighter-bomber with a total of 1,127 aircraft built. They were manufactured by Lockheed, as well as under license by Canadair and a consortium of European companies that included Messerschmitt/MBB, Fiat, Fokker, and SABCA. The type featured a strengthened fuselage, wing, and empennage structures; the larger vertical fin with fully powered rudder as used on the two-seat versions; fully powered brakes, a new anti-skid system, and larger tires; revised flaps for improved combat maneuvering; and a larger braking chute. Upgraded avionics included the Autonetics NASARR F15A-41B radar with air-to-air, ground-mapping, contour-mapping, and terrain-avoidance modes, as well as the Litton LN-3 inertial navigation system (the first on a production fighter).

;RF-104G: The RF-104G was a tactical reconnaissance model based on the F-104G, usually with three KS-67A cameras mounted in the forward fuselage in place of the internal cannon. Many of the 189 built were subsequently reconfigured to the F-104G standard.
;TF-104G: A combat-capable trainer version of the F-104G, the TF-104G had no cannon or centerline pylon, and reduced internal fuel. One of the 220 aircraft produced was used by Lockheed as a demonstrator with the civil registration number N104L, and was flown by Jackie Cochran to set three women&#x27;s world speed records in 1964. This aircraft later served in the Netherlands. A pair of two-seat TF-104Gs joined the NASA Dryden inventory in July 1975 along with a Fokker-built former RF-104G.
;F-104H: The F-104H was a projected export version based on the F-104G with an optical gunsight and simplified equipment. It was canceled prior to construction.
;F-104J: The F-104J was a specialized interceptor version of the F-104G for the Japanese ASDF, built under license by Mitsubishi for the air-superiority role; it was armed with cannon and four Sidewinders, but had no strike capability. Some were converted to UF-104J radio-controlled target drones and destroyed. A total of 210 were built, three by Lockheed, 29 by Mitsubishi from Lockheed-sourced components, and 178 by Mitsubishi. After being retired in Japan, the U.S. delivered some of these 104J/DJs to the air force of Taiwan.
;F-104N: Three unarmed and lighter F-104Gs were delivered to NASA in 1963 for use as high-speed chase aircraft and given the designation F-104N. One, piloted by Joe Walker, collided with an XB-70 on 8 June 1966.

;F-104S: FIAT built 246 of the final production version, the F-104S (one of these aircraft crashed prior to delivery and is often not included in the total number produced). Forty of these aircraft were delivered to the Turkish Air Force and the rest to the Italian Air Force (&quot;Aeronautica Militare Italiana&quot;). The F-104S was upgraded for the interception role, adding the NASARR R-21G/H radar with moving-target indicator and continuous-wave illuminator for semi-active radar homing missiles (initially the AIM-7 Sparrow), two additional wing and two underbelly hardpoints (increasing the total to nine), the more powerful J79-GE-19 engine, and two additional ventral fins to increase stability. The M61 cannon was sacrificed to make room for the missile avionics in the interceptor version, but was retained for the fighter-bomber variant. Typically two Sparrow and two (and sometimes four or six) Sidewinder missiles were carried on all the hardpoints except the central (underbelly), or up to seven bombs (normally two to four bombs). The F-104S was cleared for a higher maximum takeoff weight, allowing it to carry up to of stores; other Starfighters had a maximum external load of . Its combat radius was up to with four external fuel tanks.
;F-104S-ASA (&quot;Aggiornamento Sistemi d&#x27;Arma&quot; – &quot;Weapon Systems Update&quot;): This was an upgraded F-104S equipped with the Fiat R21G/M1 radar with frequency hopping and a look-down/shoot-down capability, new IFF system and weapon delivery computer, and provision for the AIM-9L all-aspect Sidewinder and Selenia Aspide missiles. A total of 150 were built, with the first flight in 1985.
;F-104S-ASA/M (&quot;Aggiornamento Sistemi d&#x27;Arma/Modificato&quot; – &quot;Weapon Systems Update/Modified&quot;): Forty-nine airframes were upgraded from 1995 to 1997 to ASA/M standard with GPS, new TACAN, and Litton LN-30A2 INS, a refurbished airframe, and improved cockpit displays. All strike-related equipment was removed. The last Starfighters in combat service, the F-104S-ASA/M was withdrawn in October 2004 and temporarily replaced by the F-16 Fighting Falcon, while awaiting Eurofighter Typhoon deliveries.
;CF-104: CF-104 was the designation applied to 200 Canadian-built versions, built under license by Canadair. Optimized for nuclear strike, the CF-104 NASARR R-24A radar with air-to-air modes was removed and the cannon deleted (both were restored after 1972). It had an additional internal fuel cell, and a license-built Orenda Engines J79-OEL-7 turbojet with / thrust.
;CF-104D: The CF-104D was a dual-control trainer version of the CF-104, built by Lockheed, but with Canadian J79-OEL-7 engines. Thirty-eight were built, with some later being transferred to Denmark, Norway, and Turkey.

<text>Almogavars (; ; ; ; originally ) is the name of a class of light infantry soldier originated in the Crown of Aragon used in the later phases of the Reconquista, during the 13th and 14th centuries.

Almogavars were lightly clad, quick-moving frontiersmen and foot-soldiers. They hailed from the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia, the Kingdom of Valencia, the Crown of Castile and the Kingdom of Portugal. In the Crown of Castile, the inner organization was managed by King Alfonso X of Castile in the Siete Partidas. At first, these troops were formed by farmers and shepherds originating from the countryside, woods and frontier mountain areas. Later, they were employed as mercenaries in Italy, the Frankokratia and the Levant.

==Etymology==
There are several theories as to where this name comes from: (; ), (, &#x27;the carrier of news&#x27;) or (, &#x27;the pilgrim&#x27;, as in &#x27;adjunct [to a holy place]&#x27;). Another theory holds that it comes from the adjective , which translates as &#x27;prideful&#x27; or &#x27;haughty&#x27;. Similarly the names of their military ranks derive from Arabic.

== Saracen origin of the term ==
The term was first used in the 10th century in the territory of Al-Andalus, to refer to small armed groups of Saracens engaged in looting and surprise attacks. The first documented historical reference appeared in the chronicle &quot;Akhbar muluk Al-Andalus&quot; or &quot;Chronicle of the Moor Rasis&quot;, the history of the kings of Al-Andalus, written between 887 and 955 by Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Razi, known among Arabs by the name &quot;Al-Tarikhi&quot; (&quot;The Chronicler&quot;) and among Christians as the &quot;Moor Rasis&quot;. In his chronicle, the historian of Qurtuba describes the territories of Al-Andalus, and upon arrival at the Ebro Valley, cites the existence of some troops called Almogavars present in the city of Saraqusta for the first time in history:

The word &quot;Almogavar&quot; was also used during the last centuries of the Reconquista (reconquest of Spain), at the Granadan border, for designating the groups of Moorish bandits that launched attacks from the kingdom of Granada on the border towns of the kingdoms of Murcia and Valencia.

== Christian adaptation ==
The Aragonese were the first Christians to adopt those strategies and fight like the groups of Saracens known as Almogavars, which eventually led to them being known by the same name.

Even though there were no contemporary chronicles of the events of the 11th and 12th centuries, the first time that any Christian Almogavars are mentioned is in a testimony by Jerónimo Zurita in his &quot;Annals of Aragón&quot;, which places the Almogavars in the time of Alfonso I of Aragon reinforcing the fortress of El Castellar around 1105–1110 with visions of the conquest of Zaragoza:

Alfonso the Chaste, loyal to his friendship with the kingdom of Castile, went to besiege al-madinat Kunka in 1177, with a group of foot soldiers identified as Almogavars, to help the Castilian monarch.

== Socioeconomic origin ==
Because of the Muslim invasion of the Iberian peninsula, the wars of the Reconquista (&quot;Reconquest&quot;) and the military campaigns of Al Andalus, the Christian shepherds had to organize themselves into bands of outlaws and penetrate the enemy domain in search of what their people needed to survive. During these raids, which usually lasted a few days, the Almogavars would live off the land and sleep out in the open, skills acquired from their former life as shepherds, the majority of them having grown up in the mountains, where the harshness of the climate limited the resources of the land.

But after many generations of leading this new kind of life that they had been pushed into by the invaders, it seems that a genuine warrior spirit formed in these shepherd communities, so that they ended up not knowing how to live by any other means than making war. In addition, it was much easier to make a living through attacks lasting a few days than by working hard for the whole year. This way of life went on being adopted by the inhabitants of the areas that bordered the Muslim territories as the Christian kingdoms advanced toward the south. The presence of Islamic Almogavars fighting alongside Catholic Almogavars is also documented.

== Description ==
They were characterized as being infantry shock troops that fought on foot, with light arms and baggage, generally with a pair of javelins, one short spear (&quot;ascona muntera&quot; in Catalan, meaning &quot;a hunting spear&quot;) and a falchion. They had full beards and dressed poorly, only in a short gown (both in summer and winter); they wore a thick leather belt and leather sandals. In addition, they always carried a good piece of flint with them that they struck their weapons with before going into battle, which gave off enormous sparks, which, together with their terrible cries, terrorized their enemies. Endowed with great valor and ferocity, those from the Crown of Aragon entered into combat to the cry of &quot;Awake iron! Let&#x27;s kill, let&#x27;s kill&quot;, &quot;for Saint George!&quot; and &quot;Aragon! Aragon!&quot;.

The following excerpt from the chronicle &quot;Llibre del rei en Pere d&#x27;Aragó e dels seus antecessors passats&quot; (&quot;Book of King Peter of Aragon and of his past ancestors&quot;) by Bernat Desclot, describes the Almogavars:

However, such descriptions are not complete and the description of the Almogavars, as much in clothing as in arms or way of life, differs more or less depending on place and time. Thus, the previous description, which describes them as people living not in villages but in remote areas such as forests and mountains, as well as the description of their weapons, only refers to Almogavars of the time indicated, and probably earlier centuries. The last Almogavars, those who from the second half of the 15th century to the 16th had the border of Granada as their sphere of influence, were residents of the towns there, very knowledgeable about the terrain, and rampaged against the Granadan territory.

Their basic characteristics were lifelong dedication to war, not just as a profession but as a way of life, perfectly adapted to the conditions of the border with the Saracens, based on looting and the sale or ransom of prisoners, frugality and resistance to fatigue, light weapons and hierarchical organization.

==Requirements and military rank==
The requirements the Almogavars had to meet were compiled by King Alfonso X in the &quot;Siete Partidas&quot;, included fitness and endurance, as well as agility. The codification of their ranks is also set out in this legal code.

===&quot;Adalid&quot; (leader)===
From the Arab word &quot;dalid&quot; (guide, conductor), was the highest rank in the Almogavar force. The &quot;adalid&quot; required wisdom, courage, intelligence and loyalty in order to guide the army on appropriate routes and to avoid danger, as well as knowledge of the land to secure places for shelter, with adequate water, firewood and grazing, and to know how to track the steps of the enemy. Among these functions were to prepare and organise expeditions and sole authority to make all decisions about raids, and he had a status similar to that of a knight (lower nobility). To appoint an &quot;adalid&quot;, twelve &quot;adalids&quot; or, in their absence, other authorised officials met and swore in the name of the king that the candidate had the necessary talents to perform this duty. After this oath, the king or other official presented him with a sword and baldric. Then he stood on a shield and the king or his representative unsheathed the sword and placed it in his hand. The &quot;adalids&quot; lifted their new colleague high, facing eastwards, and he made a pattern in the air with his sword, in the form of the cross and said:

&quot;I, N, challenge all the enemies of the faith in the name of God and of my Lord and King and of his land&quot;.

He then did the same facing the other cardinal points of the earth. The ceremony concluded, the &quot;adalid&quot; sheathed his sword and the king said to him:

&quot;Henceforth you are an &quot;adalid&quot;&quot;.

Initially this was a lifelong responsibility, but from the end of the 14th century it became hereditary, which brought the &quot;adalid&quot; still closer to the lower ranks of the nobility.

===&quot;Almogavar a llom cavall&quot; (mounted Almogavar)===
An intermediate rank between the &quot;adalid&quot; and the &quot;almocaden&quot; is documented in Castile.

===&quot;Almocaden&quot;===
From Arabic &quot;al-muqaddem&quot;, &#x27;the captain&#x27;, &#x27;he who leads&#x27;. He was of a lower rank and a captain of autonomous Almogavar groups; for this he was required to be knowledgeable about war and about leading his group, to have motivation, to know how to motivate his peers and to be light, to be faster and to be able to hide easily in addition to being fair, as set forth in Title XII, Act V of the entries (the &quot;Partidas&quot;):

The &quot;almocaden&quot; was an Almogavar of demonstrated experience who was accepted as a leader by the Almogavars of his group. Just like the two previous ranks, it also seems to have entailed being mounted on a horse, although there is only the reference of two &quot;almocadenes&quot; on horseback, so this requirement remains unclear.

=== Almogavar ===
Also called &quot;hombres de campo&quot; (countrymen) or &quot;peones&quot; (pawns) in Castile, these were of the lowest rank and formed the bulk of the army. As the Law VI, Title VII established, of the codes (the &quot;Partidas&quot;), to be elected an &quot;adalid&quot; it was necessary to have earlier been an Almogavar on horseback, and to be this, previously to be an &quot;almocaden&quot;, and to be an &quot;almocaden&quot;, previously an Almogavar.

==Historic military significance==
The Almogavars were considered one of the best infantries of their era. In an age in which cavalry was the favored weapon of armies and the model of the chivalric ideal was a continuing myth, the Almogavars used the terrain to their advantage, fought at night and always went on foot without wearing armour, which gave them great mobility. Ramon Llull gave them as much importance as the crossbowmen and heavy armoured knights. According to his view, the only way to effectively combat Islam and recover the Holy Land was to start the war from the Spanish border, defeat the Moors of Al-Andalus, go to North Africa, and gradually moving up to the Levant; considering this and their military effectiveness, the Almogavars were a key part of his plan. In the year he wrote his chronicle (1315), the Almogavars were at the height of their fame, and had achieved renown throughout the Mediterranean for their exploits in Tunisia, Sicily, and in the Catalan Company.

When they were carrying out border incursions, the Almogavars usually fought in small, autonomous groups of five to fifteen men, counting on surprise. In times of open warfare, the groups were more numerous and there is mention of twenty or thirty comrades per group. Also, very rarely, some Almogavars participated in corsair operations against Granada.

It also must be emphasized that they were not exactly an army, but formed a very hard way of life, and they did not usually have any jobs: They took everything from their raids; so in times of peace, they were a great nuisance for any leader. The primary activity of these groups was to carry out small raids in enemy territory with the objective of taking livestock and captives and then selling them. In times of war, the kings and local nobles encouraged these activities, which yielded the King&#x27;s fifth of the booty obtained.

They were born during the violence of the frontier between the Islamic and the Christian world, and actually were often the cause of the frontier tensions. The frontier with the Saracen, not very attractive for people who wished for a life of quiet work, was a refuge for adventurers, of people who enjoyed living with risks and who lived by the fist and by looting enemy territory. During the wars they joined the army, most of the time without a salary, but in exchange for rights on the loot, and being fed.

=== Tactics ===
Their mission consisted of exploring the land where the army was advancing, standing at forefront and flanks, harassing the enemy, attacking their garrisons by surprise and intercepting their convoys. They preferred to fight in open order, but if they were in trouble they could form a compact mass to fight off repeated cavalry charges, as happened against the Moors at Alcoll.

Almogavars acted as light infantry and could act in collaboration with heavy cavalry, but unlike other medieval infantry troops they did not require their support. In the mercenary companies, besides Almogavars, there were units of &quot;knights, infantry, archers, scudars, and men guarding the weapons of galleys&quot;, each one with a specific mission that could be coordinated on the battlefield. They always retained their autonomy and were a permanent militia, because their modus vivendi consisted of making raids in enemy border territory. For this reason, they always carried light arms in order to move swiftly during the raids, which could last two or three days before getting to villages with decent booty. For this reason, their long marches proved their endurance, speed, and frugality.

In the Europe of those times armoured heavy cavalry was the dominant shock force, so their tactics proved to be an innovation. The Almogavars were uncomfortable riding, and always fought on foot. Acting as light infantry, the first thing they did was throw their spears at the knights, piercing their armour and shields from a distance, but especially fatally wounding the horses. They also got into the enemy formation to cut the hocks of the animals with their heavy knives, or impaled them with spears. In the melee they did not hesitate to use their heavy knives or maces to disembowel horses, and when the agonized mounts collapsed they rushed at the horsemen with their knives to kill them.

==Presence in the Crown of Aragon==

The Almogavars of the Crown of Aragon (originally from Aragonese, Catalan and Valencian origins) are the best known because of their deeds and international protection, both in the Mediterranean expansion, as well as the Catalan Company, an Almogavar unit of great fame.

They formed a numerous host, as Peter III of Aragon (1276–1285) led 15,000 of them in his expedition to Tunisia and Sicily, and they also fought in the Principality of Catalonia during the crusade against the Crown of Aragon, under the leadership of Roger of Lauria, participating in the battle of the pass of the Panizas (Coll de Panissars, in Catalan).

===Conquest===
The Catalan, Aragonese, and later, Valencian Almogavars played an important role in the advance of the Crown of Aragon against the Islamic States, participating moreover in countless raids, in the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212), in the crusade against Majorca (1229–1232) and in the conquest of Valencia (1233–1245). In 1232, Almogovar armies took the strategic enclaves of Ares and Morella, opening the doors to the conquest of Valencia. After several failed attempts, in 1240, a coalition of calatravian knights and an important almogavar contingent managed to seize the fortified place of Villena, a town located in territory reserved for Castile according to the Treaty of Cazola which would unleash a series of tensions that ended with the signing of the new Treaty of Almizra. When the Moorish rebellion in Murcia took place in 1264, and James I went to this kingdom to the aid of his son-in-law, he says in his Chronicle (&quot;Llibre dels Fets&quot;) that while he was in Orihuela, studying how to take the capital to end the rebellion, &quot;two Almogavars from Lorca came at midnight and knocked on the door&quot; to alert him that, from Lorca, they had spotted a large contingent of Moors who headed towards Murcia.

=== War in Sicily and crusade against the Crown of Aragon ===
On 30 March 1282, Peter III of Aragon waged war on Charles of Anjou after the Sicilian Vespers for the possession of Naples and Sicily. The Almogavars formed the most effective element of his army. Their discipline, ferocity and the force with which they hurled their javelins made them formidable against heavy cavalry of the Angevin armies. They fought against cavalry by attacking the enemies&#x27; horses instead of the knights themselves. Once a knight was on the ground he was an easy victim of an Almogavar.

Between 1284 and 1285, the Crusade against the Crown of Aragon was declared by Pope Martin IV against King Peter the Great of Aragon. This crusade was declared based on King Peter&#x27;s intervention in Sicilian affairs against the papal will. Most of the conflict took place in Catalonia, although the first episode took place in the frontier of Navarre and Aragon. The Almogavars were at the service of King commanded by King Peter or Roger of Lauria.

Roger of Lauria had much more control over his captains than the enemies did. His crews were made up of specialized troops, instead of the more generic types used by his enemies. His archers were used initially, while his oarsmen Almogavars stayed under cover. These Almogavars were much more agile than the heavily armoured knights with swords, as his enemies often used, especially on the moving deck of a galley at sea. Roger used trickery to disguise the size of his force. In addition, he sometimes kept some of his galleys hidden, to attack the rear of the enemy after the battle had started.

Roger was also infamous for the ruthless sackings and the devastation of his actions, often driven only by greed and personal advantage. On the other side, his reputation alone possibly caused some enemies to lose heart during a battle.

In 1302, the Peace of Caltabellotta ended the war in southern Italy. 4,000 Almogavars, under the leadership of Roger de Flor (&quot;Roger Blum&quot;, a former Knight Templar), formed the Catalan Company in the service of the Emperor of the East, Andronicus II Palaeologus. This company was organized to fight against the Turks, defending the Byzantine Empire. Both kings of Aragon and Sicily agreed with this strategy as a viable alternative to having the Almogavar army standing unemployed in their realms.

The Almogavar campaign in Asia Minor to drive back Turks took place in 1303 and 1304, and began with a series of great military victories that drove them back from Philadelphia to Cyzicus and in doing so brought great destruction to the Anatolian landscape. When the Almogavars insisted in receiving the agreed payment, the Byzantine Emperor refused. In 1305, Roger de Flor and his lieutenants were assassinated by orders of the Emperor while meeting to discuss terms on their compensation. This assassination may have been instigated by Genoese merchants, who were conspiring to keep their own position of influence and power.

This betrayal resulted in the surviving Almogavars, who resisted for two years a siege in Gallipoli and concentrated on the region of Thrace, leading off the Catalan Revenge, a war of extermination and systematic looting against the civilian population of the Byzantine Empire between 1305 and 1307 in revenge and retaliation for the murder of Roger de Flor and the attempted annihilation of the company while it was stationed at Gallipoli.

=== Duchy of Athens ===
After a period of internal conflict, the Great Company left the line and moved to Greece where it was hired by the Duke of Athens, who didn&#x27;t pay what they agreed to; so the Almogavars marched against the Duchy of Athens, under the rule of the French House of Brienne. In March 1310, Duke Walter V of Brienne and all his knights were defeated and slain by the Almogavars at the Battle of the Cephissus, or Orchomenus in Boeotia. They then divided the wives and possessions of the Frenchmen by lot, and summoned a prince of the house of Aragon to rule over them.

The culminating achievement of the Almogavars was the foundation of Aragonese rule over the duchy of Athens. Although the duchy eventually fell, even today the King of Spain still holds the title of Duke of Athens and Neopatria.

=== Late period ===
The Aragonese Almogavars also distinguished themselves in the war against Castile (1296–1304), where they participated in considerable numbers, but in the 14th century their numbers dropped drastically because of the end of major wars of expansion and because a large number of them went to take part in the expedition of Peter the Great to Sicily, from which many never returned but instead continued fighting in Italy, having enrolled in Guelph armies or in the Catalan Company.

The vacuum left never refilled, but yet were so remarkable in the crusade against Almeria (1309), in the campaigns of Granada (1330–1334), against the king of Mallorca (1343–1344), in expeditions to Sardinia (1353, 1354 and 1367), and yet again against Castile (1356–1369), but in the latter they no longer made up the bulk of the infantry but rather were special units for dangerous and explorers&#x27; raids. In 1384–1385 some small groups of 30 to 100 Almogavars participated in the war against the Earl of Ampurias. Shortly after, they defended the Principality of Catalonia against the invasion attempt of the Armagnac count in 1390, and the next attempt of the Foix count from 1396 up to 1397. In the 15th century, there were still groups of Almogavars in the Italian wars of Alfonso the Magnanimous.

==Presence in the Crown of Castile==
The presence of Almogavars in Castile, despite being somewhat unknown, is well documented. They had as important a role in the conquest of Andalucia as at the border of Granada. In addition to the aforementioned role in the groups of Alfonso X, they are also mentioned in ballad 374 of said author. There, it is told how a group of Almogavars achieved nothing in their brawls until they decided to hold a vigil in the chapel of Alcazar, after which they came out on horseback and won victory with good booty, offering the Virgin a cloth of purple and gold.

===Kingdom of Jaen===
This place was for many years a place of raids by Almogavars of Aragonese, Navarrese and Basque ancestry, especially in places like Pegalajar, Cambil, Huelma and Arenas. To the north of the castle of this locality exists a zone that was known as &quot;Campo de Almogavares&quot; (&quot;Land of Almogavars&quot;). 

===Conquest of Cordoba===
The beginning of the conquest of the city of Cordoba by the Almogavars is told by Argote de Molina:

=== Border of Granada ===

Almogavars had a relevant presence at the border of Granada, where their ranks were made up of neighbors of the border localities and adventurers looking for booty in the kingdom of Granada. Other times, the reason leading them to become Almogavars was revenge. The brutal raids of Benimerines and Zenetes coming from North Africa, which especially affected the western area of the border, caused the destruction of entire towns and the enslaving of its inhabitants, which led the survivors, without hope and with their lives broken, to join Almogavar groups commanded by Almocadenes, turning their new life into a continuous feeling of revenge. This was the case of many of the neighbors of Vejer, Alcala de los Gazules, Medina-Sidonia and Lebrija, who after an attack in 1293 where the North Africans kidnapped over 200 captives to sell them as slaves, enlisted in the Almogavar ranks. 

Besides the looting, they were engaged in other activities. When groups of bandits from Granada were detected going into in Christian territory, Almogavars hid by the roads they used or by their water sources, in order to surprise them as they passed by these places. Grateful municipalities across the border, such as Murcia or Orihuela, rewarded this activity.

When Almogavars deployed throughout the border, it was very difficult for any potential enemy to pass, unless it was a large contingent of troops or someone who knew the area very well and passed through fields at night. In April 1309, when the war between Castile and Granada had already begun and before the Crown of Aragon also declared war on Granada, the roads of the kingdom of Murcia were so full of Almogavars that Pedro López de Ayala, who ruled the kingdom, advised against the move of the ambassadors of the king of Granada returning from the court of James II, saying that they would surely be captured, even if they had a guide.

Almogavars also used to work for intelligence services and surveillance, which depended on the municipalities or the royal officers, and were vital to the defense of the border with the Saracens. The surveillance of the border was based on two fixed networks of lookouts in the mountains with good visibility, in the administration of Orihuela and another in Valencia procurement &quot;beyond the Júcar&quot; on the former border of kingdom of Valencia, i.e., in the area close to the line Busot – Biar. The mission of the Almogavar scouts was to observe possible entries of enemies and warn of this fact by smoke signals during the day and fire by night. These signals were transmitted from one scout to another, so that, after a little while the whole country could be warned. Other monitoring points were located on the main roads, where the mission was to stand guard against the numerous robberies of foot traffic. They also guarded mountain passes and river fords, especially the Cañaveral del Segura ford, near Cieza, where the guerrillas or armies used to cross the river.

Sometimes municipalities required services of Almogavars to track Granadian robbers, that they knew well how to spot because they knew how to be quiet when they entered a Christian land; they used to replace iron horseshoes with esparto horseshoes, which left some footprints and often unique pieces of this clothing material.

Free activities of Almogavars originated numerous diplomatic conflicts with Granada, because they didn&#x27;t respect the signed peace. Valencian Almogavars were also a source of friction with the Crown of Castile, because of frequent Granadian reprisals after a raid of Valencian Almogavars, exercised against Murcian border populations, because Almogavars from Valencia or Murcia had caused damage to the neighboring territory.

=== Granada war ===

Adalids played an important role in this conflict, as were those who knew the territory better and how to combat Granadians because they were familiar with them. They commanded hosts of Hidalgos (noblemen) from Oviedo. They are also described by Diego Hurtado de Mendoza in &quot;War of Granada&quot;:

===North Africa===

The first Almogavars acting here were those of the Crown of Aragon, especially those under the reign of Peter III the Great and led by Roger de Lauria made several raids on the coast of Tunisia. Ramon Muntaner recounted some of these battles, such as the occupation of the island of Djerba.

Once they conquered Granada, veteran Almogavars embarked to conquer African coastal places, shelter of pirates and corsairs.

===Other conflicts===

John I, coming to the battle of Aljubarrota against Portugal, requested the rapid advent of &quot;those Almogavares&quot;. Also hosts of Murcian Almogavars intervened in the early reign of the Catholic Monarchs against aristocratic opposition led by the Marquis of Villena in his advocacy of the rights of the daughter of Henry IV.

== Almogavars in Portugal ==

There are abundant references to the existence of Almogavars in the Kingdom of Portugal, who played an important role in the African campaigns in which they were immersed in the 15th and 16th centuries, where Almogavars and Almocadenes guarded the borders of the Portuguese possessions in North Africa. Their military rank, exactly the same as their Castilian and Aragonese counterparts, is collected in Alfonsine Ordinances, and the Chronicle of King Manuel states &quot;They sent Almogavars to run (...) to attack the Moors&quot;.

==Decline==

The end of the great wars of expansion in the Iberian Peninsula, with only the Kingdom of Granada resisting, meant the gradual decrease in the number of Almogavars. While the Granadian border offered good opportunities of profit, penetrating it was not as profitable as before, since most of the captured Moors ended up being slaves and their price did not justify the risk of crossing the border to catch them. Moreover, in peacetime royal officials closely watched these activities, so it was very difficult to sell those captives as slaves.

This had several implications. On the one hand, the figure of Almogavars was transmuted to the Ballestero de monte (mountain crossbowmen) and head hunters, who held mainly defensive functions against frequent attacks from Granada. On the other, it meant drift of some Almogavars to banditry.

When these activities were illegal in peacetime, some Almogavars from Orihuela soon discovered that it was much safer to make raids in their own territory, where there were also Moors; the Islamic communities at the time of the conquest had accepted Christian domain. Almogavars took members of these communities as prisoners, hid them in caves and demanded ransom or sold them far away as captives. Often these Almogavars were acting not in their own territory, but in the neighboring one, to better ensure their impunity and further complicate the chase. To do so, they found moral justifications based on the suspicions against the Moors of the Murcian kingdom, accused of helping fellow Granadians in raids on Christian territory. At a popular level, in addition, the distinction between enemy Moors and Moors who were not was not very clear. Almogavars practicing this crime of kidnapping or &quot;collera&quot;, consisting of taking a free person to sell as slave, were called &quot;Collerats&quot;. Almogavars were so often dedicated to this activity that the word &quot;Almogavar&quot; eventually ended up becoming synonymous with &quot;Collerat&quot;.

Some Almogavar groups also committed abuses against the Christian population of the neighboring kingdoms, as in May 1296 when a Christian boy of five along with some Saracens had been captured by Almogavars in Murcia and sold as a Moorish captive. Also in May, James II ordered the return of some prisoners robbed and sold by Almogavars which belonged to three Catalan knights. In June, the king commanded that some Saracens be released, and returned their cows, mares and all other livestock that belonged to them, which were stolen by Almogavars. These criminal practices made Almogavars to fall into great disrepute.

==Cultural and linguistic legacy==

===Negative connotation of Almogavars===

Almogavars were also known as &quot;Catalans&quot; in Byzantine Empire territories. The presence of the company left its mark on the folklore and the popular legend of the different regions where they went, including as far as the Balkans and Greece. Devastation caused by Almogavars troops has created a negative connotation in some places.

In the Greek regions of Attica and Boeotia, a popular saying included: may &quot;the revenge of the Catalans fall on you&quot;, while in the region of Parnassus, the following saying was popularized: &quot;I will flee from the Turks to fall into the hands of the Catalans&quot;.

In Bulgaria, the expressions &quot;Catalan&quot; or &quot;Aragonese&quot; and &quot;son of Catalan&quot; mean &quot;evil man, soulless, torturer&quot;. Ivan M. Vazov in the poem &quot;Pirates,&quot; first published in 1915, includes the Catalans with the Turks as the greatest oppressors of the Bulgarian nation, while in Albania the word &quot;Catalan&quot; means &quot;ugly and wicked man.&quot; Likewise, &quot;Catalan&quot; or &quot;Katallani&quot; is designated in Albanian folklore as a monster with one eye, reminiscent in many ways the Cyclops Polyphemus. This cyclops is represented by a wild blacksmith who feeds on human flesh. He also has no knees, so he can not bend, and long legs like masts of a ship. He faces a young hero named Dedaliya. This tradition, in various versions, is usually called by the title of &quot;Daedalus dhe Katallani&quot;, Daedalus and Catalan.

=== Almogavar legacy in contemporary culture ===
* In Spain, Paratrooper Brigade VI is called &quot;Almogávares&quot;. The first Spanish paratrooper unit was founded on 17 October 1953 and named after Almogavar commander Roger de Flor.

In addition, Almogavars have appeared in some works of fiction:
* In the 1942 Spanish film &quot;Raza&quot;, based on a semi-autobiographical script by the then head of state Francisco Franco, a Navy officer describes to his children the Almogavars as model soldiers.
* In &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Revelations&quot;, a video game produced by Ubisoft, there is a unit called &quot;Byzantine Almogavar&quot; based on Almogavars.

<doc id="82454" wikidata="Q1414913" url="?curid=82454" title="List of United States over-the-air television networks">
<text>In the United States, for most of the history of broadcasting, there were only three or four major commercial national terrestrial networks. From 1946 to 1956, these were ABC, CBS, NBC and DuMont. From 1956 to 1986, the &quot;Big Three&quot; national commercial networks were ABC, CBS, and NBC (with a few limited attempts to challenge them, such as National Telefilm Associates&#x27;s NTA Film Network, the Overmyer Network, &amp; even DuMont shareholder Paramount Pictures&#x27;s Paramount Television Network). From 1954 to 1970, National Educational Television was the national clearinghouse for public TV programming; the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) succeeded it in 1970.

Today, more than fifty national free-to-air networks exist. Other than the non-commercial educational (NCE) PBS, which is composed of member stations, the largest terrestrial television networks are the traditional Big Three television networks (ABC, CBS and NBC). Many other large networks exist, however, notably Fox and The CW which air original programming for two hours each night instead of three like the original &quot;Big Three&quot; do, as well as MyNetworkTV, which feature reruns of recent popular shows with little to no original programming, and Ion Television, which has had the same format since around 2007 but has started to pursue sports properties. Fox has just about the same household reach percentage as the Big Three, and is therefore often considered a peer to ABC, CBS, and NBC since it has also achieved equal or better ratings since the late 1990s; as of 2019, it also programs the equivalent amount of sports programming as the Big Three. Most media outlets now include Fox in what they refer to as the &quot;Big Four&quot; TV networks.

The transition to digital broadcasting in 2009 has allowed for television stations to offer additional programming options through digital subchannels, one or more supplementary programming streams to the station&#x27;s primary channel that are achieved through multiplexing of a station&#x27;s signal. A number of new commercial networks airing specialty programming such as movies, reruns of classic series and lifestyle programs have been created from companies like Weigel Broadcasting, Sinclair Broadcast Group and even owners of the major networks such as Fox Corporation (through the Fox Entertainment subsidiary), Paramount Global (through the CBS Media Ventures subsidiary), The Walt Disney Company (through the Walt Disney Television subsidiary) and Comcast (through the NBCUniversal subsidiary). Through the use of multicasting, there have also been a number of new Spanish-language and non-commercial public TV networks that have launched.

Free-to-air networks in the U.S. can be divided into five categories:
* Commercial networks – which air English-language programming to a general audience (for example, ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox);
* Spanish-language networks – fully programmed networks which air Spanish-language programming to a primarily Latin American audience (for example, Telemundo and Univision);
* Educational and other non-commercial broadcast networks – which air English- and some foreign-language television programming, intended to be educational in nature or otherwise of a sort not found on commercial television (for example, PBS);
* Religious broadcast networks – which air religious study and other faith-based programs, and in some cases, family-oriented secular programs (for example, Daystar, Hope Channel, 3ABN and TBN).
* Shopping networks – which air live presentations of various products intended to be sold directly to the viewer (for example, HSN and QVC).

Each network sends its signal to many local affiliate television stations across the country. These local stations then air the &quot;network feed&quot;, with programs broadcast by each network being viewed by up to tens of millions of households across the country. In the case of the largest networks, the signal is sent to over 200 stations. In the case of the smallest networks, the signal may be sent to just a dozen or fewer stations.

As of the 2016–17 television season, there are an estimated 118.4 million households in the U.S. with at least one TV set.

* CBS (owned by Paramount)

===Spanish language/international services===

==Current networks==
===Conventional commercial networks===
* American Broadcasting Company (ABC) – The nation&#x27;s third-largest commercial network, ABC was originally formed from the NBC Blue Network (1927–1945), a radio network which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) forced NBC (National Broadcasting Company) to sell in 1943 for anti-monopoly reasons, the ABC-TV network began broadcasting in 1948. Owned by The Walt Disney Company, ABC airs original programming, sports, and news seven days a week. It has over 200 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations, almost all of which air local newscasts.
* CBS (originally the Columbia Broadcasting System) – The nation&#x27;s second-largest commercial network, it originated as the CBS Radio Network in 1927; the CBS-TV network commenced broadcasts in 1941. Owned now by Paramount Global, CBS airs original programming, sports and news seven days a week. The network has over 200 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations, almost all of which air local newscasts. For most of its existence, CBS has been the nation&#x27;s most watched network.
* National Broadcasting Company (NBC) – The nation&#x27;s largest and oldest commercial network, the NBC-TV network was formed out of the NBC Red Network radio service, which launched in 1926; the network commenced television broadcasts in 1939. Owned by NBCUniversal, NBC airs original programming, sports and news seven days a week. It has over 200 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations, almost all of which air local newscasts.
* Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox) – The nation&#x27;s fourth-largest commercial network owned by Fox Corporation, Fox was launched in October 1986 through former parent News Corporation&#x27;s purchase of Metromedia earlier that year (two of the network&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations once owned by that group at its founding had formed the hub of the old DuMont Television Network, which existed from 1944 to 1956) and the purchase of the 20th Century Fox film studio, originally established in 1915 as Fox Film Corporation by William Fox and merging with 20th Century Pictures (founded 1933) in 1935, five years after founder Fox lost control. After a half-century of up and down success, the studio was bought in 1985 by News Corporation, a company founded by Australian and later British and American newspaper chain mogul Rupert Murdoch. Fox airs first-run programming and sports seven days a week, programming two hours each night in primetime (three hours on Sundays), along with political talk program &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; on Sunday mornings and the optional infomercial block &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot; on Saturday mornings. (Fox also allows affiliates the option to air the Xploration Station block on Saturday mornings in place of &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot;.) It has nearly 200 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations, almost all of which air local newscasts, with some producing newscasts in-house and others airing newscasts produced by a local affiliate of another major network.
* The CW – The CW was originally formed by CBS Corporation (which later merged with Viacom to create ViacomCBS, now Paramount Global) and Time Warner (later WarnerMedia, which eventually merged with Discovery Inc. to form Warner Bros. Discovery) as a replacement for The WB and UPN, both of which folded in September 2006 after 11 years of existence and whose programs formed most of its initial schedule. Nexstar Media Group, the largest owner of television stations in the country, bought a 75% stake and controlling interest in the network in 2022; Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery each retain a 12.5% stake. The CW maintains approximately 100 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations in the top 100 television markets; it also has approximately 90 additional cable-only and digital subchannel affiliations in smaller TV markets through a programming service feed known as The CW Plus. The network airs two hours of first-run programming in primetime on Monday through Sunday, as well as a three-hour children&#x27;s programming block on Saturday mornings called One Magnificent Morning and some sports coverage on weekends. Unlike the larger networks, The CW does not directly own its flagship station in New York City; WPIX is instead owned by Mission Broadcasting and operated under a LMA by Nexstar. Some CW affiliates air local newscasts, most of which are produced by another station in the market though four of its affiliates (most owned by Nexstar) produce local newscasts in-house, and some Nexstar-owned stations carry additional content from sister cable news channel News Nation.
* MyNetworkTV – MyNetworkTV is a programming service owned by Fox Corporation, which is also parent of the Fox network. It was hastily formed in February 2006 to provide programming for stations left out of affiliation with The CW, after CBS Corporation and Time Warner chose to shut down UPN and The WB to form that network. The network launched in September 2006 with a format of English-language telenovelas, but gradually switched to mainly low-budget programming by the end of its first year. Since it converted from a TV network into a programming service in 2009, MyNetworkTV fills its two-hour primetime schedule on Monday through Fridays with reruns of drama series that originated on other broadcast and cable networks. Some MyNetworkTV affiliates air local newscasts, most of which are produced by another station in the market though three of its affiliates (most owned by Nexstar) produce local newscasts in-house. Some affiliates also carry the nightly scheduled out of primetime to accommodate those newscasts and alternate programming (or in the case of several affiliates are primary Fox affiliates), and offer MyNetworkTV as a late night offering instead. For the Fox Television Stations group, most of its stations now brand as a &quot;Plus&quot; station of the larger Fox O&amp;O station if part of a duopoly.
* Ion Television – Ion Television (originally known as Pax TV from 1998 to 2005, i: Independent Television from 2005 to 2007) is a mid-sized network owned by the Scripps Networks subsidiary of the E. W. Scripps Company; it airs off-network repeats of recent television series (usually a daily block of one series) for eighteen hours per day, along with sports, most notably women&#x27;s sports, including the WNBA basketball on Friday nights and NWSL soccer on Saturdays. Ion is the largest English-language network that is responsible for handling nearly all programming on behalf of its affiliates, some of which run some limited local programming and overflow programming from Scripps sister stations in the same market. It has around 48 owned-and-operated and 23 affiliated stations, the majority of which were owned by former parent Ion Media; Ion is available in markets without an over-the-air (OTA) affiliate via a national feed that is distributed to pay-television providers and AVOD streaming services, along with a group of stations spun out to a separately-owned Ion-only broadcast group, Inyo Broadcast Holdings. As Pax TV and i, it aired several hours a week of original programming in primetime (often produced in conjunction with NBC).

===Minor and digital multicast commercial networks===
* MeTV (a backronym for &quot;Memorable Entertainment Television&quot;) – MeTV is a network owned by Weigel Broadcasting that airs reruns of classic series from the 1950s to the 1990s sourced primarily from the CBS Media Ventures, NBCUniversal Syndication Studios and Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution program libraries, as well as some limited content from Weigel.

** MeTV+ - MeTV&#x27;s sister network also owned by Weigel Broadcasting that airs more reruns of classic series from the 1950s to the 1990s from the CBS Media Ventures, NBCUniversal Syndication Studios, Sony Pictures Television, and Disney Platform Distribution program libraries, also with some limited content from Weigel. MeTV+ was launched in 2021.
** MeTV Toons - A third sister network launched in June 2024 carrying older animated content, mainly from Warner Bros. Animation and its other acquired studios, serving as a &quot;de facto&quot; replacement for Warner&#x27;s own classic animation network, Boomerang.
* Story Television – Story Television, a digital multicast network also owned by Weigel Broadcasting launched on March 28, 2022. The network&#x27;s focus is on historical and factual programming and utilizes the library of the cable network History, expanding its non-fiction offerings beyond Through the Decades.
* Antenna TV – Antenna TV is a digital multicast network owned by Nexstar Media Group; launched on January 1, 2011, the network carries classic series from the 1950s to the 1970s sourced from the programming libraries of Sony Pictures Television, NBCUniversal Syndication Studios and Disney Platform Distribution, as well as other distributors.
* Rewind TV – Rewind TV is a companion network to Antenna TV also owned by Nexstar which specifically carries sitcoms from the 1980s and 1990s. The network launched on September 1, 2021.
* Movies! – Movies! is a digital multicast network owned as a joint venture between Weigel Broadcasting and Fox Television Stations; launched on May 23, 2013 and natively transmitted in the 16:9 format, the network features theatrically released feature films from the 1920s to the 1980s primarily sourced from the 20th Century Studios library, as well as select titles from Sony Pictures Entertainment and Paramount Pictures, most of which are broadcast in the aspect ratio to which they were originally produced. Movies! maintains subchannel-only affiliations with approximately 45 stations. 
* Bounce TV – Bounce TV is a digital multicast network owned by Katz Broadcasting; co-founded by Martin Luther King III and Andrew Young, and launched on September 26, 2011. Its programming is aimed at African Americans between the ages of 25 and 54, featuring a mix of acquired sitcoms, game shows, talk shows, original programs, and feature films. Bounce TV maintains affiliations with approximately 45 stations (the vast majority of which are subchannel-only affiliations), primarily in markets with sizeable African-American populations.
* Cozi TV – Cozi TV is a digital multicast network owned by the NBCUniversal Owned Television Stations subsidiary of NBCUniversal; launched on January 1, 2013, the network carries classic series from the 1950s to the 1990s sourced from the NBCUniversal Television Distribution programming library, as well as lifestyle programming and feature films. Cozi TV traces its history to the 2010 launch of NBC Nonstop, a local news and lifestyle programming subchannel format that spread to most of NBC&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations. The network maintains approximately 65 affiliates, including all of NBC&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations (nearly all of which carry the network on digital subchannels).
* Get – Get (a backronym for &quot;Great Entertainment Television&quot;; originally GetTV from 2014 to 2023) is a digital multicast network owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment; launched on February 13, 2014, the network originally focused on classic theatrically released films from the 1920s to the 1960s sourced mainly from Sony Pictures library. Most were broadcast in the aspect ratio to which they were originally produced.

===Spanish-language commercial networks===

* Estrella TV – Estrella TV is a general entertainment network owned by Estrella Media (formerly Liberman Broadcasting); it airs mainly original variety programming, as well as general and entertainment news programming, limited scripted programming and imported Mexican feature films, along with content from Mexico&#x27;s TV Azteca. The network was launched in 2009, featuring programming originally produced for the Liberman-owned Spanish language independent stations that formed the nucleus of the network.

Additionally, Televisa, which distributes programming to Univision in the United States, operates in Mexico, but the company&#x27;s networks (Canal de las Estrellas, Canal 5 and Nueve) have certain stations which can be received in parts of the U.S. located along and near the Mexican border, and likewise with the American networks have affiliates located or receivable in Mexican border cities. Some Mexican border stations (such as the former English-language ABC/Fox/CW affiliate XETV-TDT in Tijuana) who formerly maintained affiliations with U.S.-based English or Spanish networks, but mainly targeted their programming at their American border city (more than the Mexican metropolitan area that they are based in or merely licensed to).

Although the English-language programming model in the U.S. traditionally relies on the network and its stations handling programming responsibilities, Spanish language networks handle most of the responsibility for programming, while affiliates are limited to breakaways from the network feed to provide local news, public affairs and/or entertainment programming as well as local advertising. As such, all Spanish language networks primarily available on broadcast TV operate national feeds that are distributed to cable and satellite providers in markets without a local affiliate. Spanish-language independent stations also exist, although (particularly with the launch of Estrella TV), these are very limited and they mainly exist in markets with a large Hispanic and Latino American population.

<doc id="82465" wikidata="Q359552" url="?curid=82465" title="Gordon Lightfoot">
<text>Gordon Meredith Lightfoot Jr. (November 17, 1938 – May 1, 2023) was a Canadian singer-songwriter and guitarist who achieved international success in folk, folk-rock, and country music. Credited with helping to define the folk-pop sound of the 1960s and 1970s, he has been referred to as Canada&#x27;s greatest songwriter, having several gold and multi-platinum albums and songs covered by some of the world&#x27;s most renowned musical artists. Lightfoot&#x27;s biographer Nicholas Jennings said, &quot;His name is synonymous with timeless songs about trains and shipwrecks, rivers and highways, lovers and loneliness.&quot;

Lightfoot&#x27;s songs, including &quot;For Lovin&#x27; Me&quot;, &quot;Early Morning Rain&quot;, &quot;Steel Rail Blues&quot;, &quot;Ribbon of Darkness&quot;—a number one hit on the U.S. country chart with Marty Robbins&#x27;s cover in 1965—and &quot;Black Day in July&quot;, about the 1967 Detroit riot, brought him wide recognition in the 1960s. Canadian chart success with his own recordings began in 1962 with the No. 3 hit Me) I&#x27;m the One&quot;, followed by recognition and charting abroad in the 1970s. He topped the US Hot 100 or Adult Contemporary (AC) chart with the hits &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot; (1970), &quot;Sundown&quot; (1974); &quot;Carefree Highway&quot; (1974), &quot;Rainy Day People&quot; (1975), and &quot;The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; (1976), and had many other hits that appeared in the top 40.

Robbie Robertson of the Band described Lightfoot as &quot;a national treasure&quot;. Bob Dylan, who would sometimes perform Lightfoot&#x27;s songs, said, &quot;I can&#x27;t think of any Gordon Lightfoot song I don&#x27;t like. Every time I hear a song of his, it&#x27;s like I wish it would last forever.&quot; Lightfoot was a featured musical performer at the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Winter Olympic Games in Calgary, Alberta, and received numerous honours and awards.

==Early life, family and education==
Lightfoot was born in Orillia, Ontario, on November 17, 1938, to Jessie Vick Trill Lightfoot and Gordon Lightfoot Sr., who owned a local dry cleaning business. He was of Scottish descent. He had an older sister, Beverley (1935–2017). His mother recognized Lightfoot&#x27;s musical talent early on and schooled him to become a successful child performer. He first performed publicly in grade four, singing the Irish-American lullaby &quot;Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral&quot;, which was broadcast over his school&#x27;s public address system during a parents&#x27; day event.

As a youth, he sang in the choir of Orillia&#x27;s St. Paul&#x27;s United Church under the direction of choirmaster Ray Williams. According to Lightfoot, Williams taught him how to sing with emotion and how to have confidence in his voice. Lightfoot was a boy soprano; he appeared periodically on local Orillia radio, performed in local operettas and oratorios, and gained exposure through various Kiwanis music festivals. At the age of twelve, after winning a competition for boys whose voices had not yet changed, he made his first appearance at Massey Hall in Toronto, a venue he would ultimately play over 170 more times throughout his career.

As a teenager, Lightfoot learned piano and taught himself to play drums and percussion. He held concerts in Muskoka, a resort area north of Orillia, singing &quot;for a couple of beers&quot;. Lightfoot performed extensively throughout high school, Orillia District Collegiate &amp; Vocational Institute (ODCVI), and taught himself to play folk guitar. A formative influence on his music at this time was 19th-century master American songwriter Stephen Foster. He was also an accomplished high school track-and-field competitor, setting school records for shot-put and pole vault.

Lightfoot moved to Los Angeles in 1958 to study jazz composition and orchestration for two years at Westlake College of Music.

==Career==
===Beginnings===
To support himself while in California, Lightfoot sang on demonstration records and wrote, arranged, and produced commercial jingles. Among his influences was the folk music of Pete Seeger, Bob Gibson, Ian &amp; Sylvia Tyson, and The Weavers. He lived in Los Angeles for a time, but he missed Toronto and returned there in 1960, living in Canada thereafter, though he did much work in the United States, under an H-1B visa.

After his return to Canada, Lightfoot performed with the Singin&#x27; Swingin&#x27; Eight, a group featured on CBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Country Hoedown&quot;, and with the Gino Silvi Singers. He soon became known at Toronto folk music-oriented coffee houses. In 1961, Lightfoot released two singles, both recorded at RCA in Nashville and produced by Louis Innis and Art Snider, that were local hits in Toronto and received some airplay elsewhere in Canada and the northeastern United States. Me) I&#x27;m the One&quot; reached No. 3 on CHUM radio in Toronto in July 1962 and was a top 20 hit on Montreal&#x27;s CKGM, then a very influential Canadian Top 40 radio station. The follow-up single was &quot;Negotiations&quot;/&quot;It&#x27;s Too Late, He Wins&quot;; it reached No. 27 on CHUM in December. He sang with Terry Whelan in a duo called the Two-Tones/Two-Timers. They recorded a live album that was released in 1962 called &quot;Two-Tones at the Village Corner&quot; (1962, Chateau CLP-1012).

In 1963, Lightfoot travelled in Europe and for one year in the UK he hosted BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Country and Western Show&quot;, returning to Canada in 1964. He appeared at the Mariposa Folk Festival and began to develop a reputation as a songwriter. Ian and Sylvia Tyson recorded &quot;Early Mornin&#x27; Rain&quot; and &quot;For Lovin&#x27; Me&quot;; a year later both songs were recorded by Peter, Paul and Mary; other performers who recorded one or both of these songs included Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Chad &amp; Jeremy, George Hamilton IV, the Clancy Brothers, and the Johnny Mann Singers. Established recording artists such as Marty Robbins (&quot;Ribbon of Darkness&quot;), Judy Collins (&quot;Early Morning Rain&quot;), Richie Havens and Spyder Turner (&quot;I Can&#x27;t Make It Anymore&quot;), and the Kingston Trio (&quot;Early Morning Rain&quot;) all achieved some chart success with Lightfoot&#x27;s material.

===1960s===

In 1965, Lightfoot signed a management contract with Albert Grossman, who also represented many prominent American folk performers, and signed a recording contract with United Artists who released his version of &quot;I&#x27;m Not Sayin&#x27;&quot; as a single. Appearances at the Newport Folk Festival, &quot;The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson&quot;, and New York&#x27;s Town Hall increased his following and bolstered his reputation. 1966 marked the release of his debut album &quot;Lightfoot!&quot;, which brought him greater exposure as both a singer and a songwriter. The album featured many now-famous songs, including &quot;For Lovin&#x27; Me&quot;, &quot;Early Mornin&#x27; Rain&quot;, &quot;Steel Rail Blues&quot;, and &quot;Ribbon of Darkness&quot;. On the strength of the &quot;Lightfoot!&quot; album, which blended Canadian and universal themes, Lightfoot became one of the first Canadian singers to achieve definitive home-grown stardom without having moved permanently to the United States to develop it. Lightfoot also recorded in the Nashville, Tennessee area at Forest Hills Music Studio (&quot;Bradley&#x27;s Barn&quot;) run by Owen Bradley and his son Jerry during the 1960s.

To kick off Canada&#x27;s Centennial year, the CBC commissioned Lightfoot to write the &quot;Canadian Railroad Trilogy&quot; for a special broadcast on January 1, 1967. Between 1966 and 1969, Lightfoot recorded four additional albums for United Artists: &quot;The Way I Feel&quot; (1967), &quot;Did She Mention My Name?&quot; (1968), &quot;Back Here on Earth&quot; (1968), and the live recording &quot;Sunday Concert&quot; (1969), and consistently placed singles in the Canadian top 40, including &quot;Go-Go Round&quot;, &quot;Spin, Spin&quot;, and &quot;The Way I Feel&quot;. His biggest hit of the era was a rendition of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Just Like Tom Thumb&#x27;s Blues&quot;, which peaked at No. 3 on the Canadian charts in December 1965. &quot;Did She Mention My Name?&quot;, released in January 1968, featured &quot;Black Day in July&quot;, about the 1967 Detroit riot. Weeks later, upon the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, radio stations in 30 states pulled the song for &quot;fanning the flames&quot;, even though the song was a plea for racial harmony. Lightfoot stated at the time radio station owners cared more about playing songs &quot;that make people happy&quot; and not those &quot;that make people think.&quot; Unhappy at a lack of support from United Artists, he defected to Warner Bros. Records, scoring his first major international hit in early 1971 with &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot;.

Lightfoot&#x27;s albums from this time were well received abroad but did not produce any hit singles. Outside of Canada, he remained better known as a songwriter than as a performer, yet he was to find commercial success there before he was fully appreciated in his own country.

His success as a live performer continued to grow throughout the late 1960s. He embarked on his first Canadian national tour in 1967, and also performed in New York City. Between 1967 and 1974, Lightfoot toured Europe and was well-received on two tours of Australia.

UA continued to release &quot;Best of&quot; album compilations in the 1970s even after Lightfoot became a success at Warner Bros./Reprise.

===1970s===
Lightfoot signed to Warner Bros./Reprise in 1970 and scored a major hit in the United States with &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot;, which sold over one million copies by early 1971 and was awarded a gold disc. The song had originally appeared on the poorly-selling 1970 album &quot;Sit Down Young Stranger.&quot; After the song&#x27;s success, the album was reissued under the new title &quot;If You Could Read My Mind;&quot; it reached No. 5 nationally and represented a major turning point in Lightfoot&#x27;s career. The album also featured a second recorded version of &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot;, as well as &quot;The Pony Man&quot;, &quot;Your Love&#x27;s Return (Song for Stephen Foster)&quot;, and &quot;Minstrel of the Dawn&quot;.

Over the next seven years, he recorded a series of successful albums that established him as a singer-songwriter:
* &quot;Summer Side of Life&quot; (1971), with songs &quot;Ten Degrees and Getting Colder&quot;, &quot;Miguel&quot;, &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Nous Vivons Ensemble&quot;, and the title track
* &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1972), with &quot;Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Looking at the Rain&quot;, &quot;Christian Island (Georgian Bay)&quot;, and the title track
* &quot;Old Dan&#x27;s Records&quot; (1972), with the title track, the two-sided single &quot;That Same Old Obsession&quot;/&quot;You Are What I Am&quot;, and the songs &quot;It&#x27;s Worth Believin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Depend on Love&quot;
* &quot;Sundown&quot; (1974). Besides the title track, it includes &quot;Carefree Highway&quot;, &quot;Seven Island Suite&quot;, &quot;The Watchman&#x27;s Gone&quot;, &quot;High and Dry&quot;, &quot;Circle of Steel&quot;, and &quot;Too Late for Prayin&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;Cold on the Shoulder&quot; (1975). Along with title track are songs &quot;Bend in the Water&quot;, &quot;The Soul Is the Rock&quot;, &quot;Rainbow Trout&quot;, &quot;All the Lovely Ladies&quot; and the hit &quot;Rainy Day People&quot;
* A double compilation LP &quot;Gord&#x27;s Gold&quot; (in 1975) containing twelve new versions of his most popular songs from the United Artists era
* &quot;Summertime Dream&quot; (1976), along with &quot;The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; are the songs &quot;I&#x27;m Not Supposed to Care&quot;, &quot;Race Among the Ruins&quot;, &quot;Spanish Moss&quot;, &quot;Never Too Close&quot;, and the title track
* &quot;Endless Wire&quot; (1978) with &quot;Daylight Katy&quot;, &quot;If Children Had Wings&quot;, &quot;Sweet Guinevere&quot;, a new version of &quot;The Circle Is Small&quot; from &quot;Back Here on Earth&quot;, and the title track

During the 1970s, Lightfoot&#x27;s songs covered a wide range of subjects, including &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, about Cervantes&#x27; famous literary character, &quot;Ode to Big Blue&quot;, about the widespread killing of whales, &quot;Beautiful&quot;, about the simple joys of love, &quot;Carefree Highway&quot;, about the freedom of the open road, &quot;Protocol&quot;, about the futility of war, and &quot;Alberta Bound&quot;, which was inspired by a lonely teenaged girl named Grace he met on a bus while travelling to Calgary in 1971.

In 1972, Lightfoot contracted Bell&#x27;s palsy, a condition that left his face partially paralyzed for a time. The affliction curtailed his touring schedule but Lightfoot nevertheless continued to deliver major hits: in June 1974 his classic single &quot;Sundown&quot; from the album &quot;Sundown&quot; went to No.1 on the American and Canadian charts. It would be his only number one hit in the United States. He performed it twice on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; series. &quot;Carefree Highway&quot; (about Arizona State Route 74 in Phoenix, Arizona) was the follow-up single from the same album. It charted in the Top 10 in both countries. Lightfoot wrote it after travelling from Flagstaff, Arizona on Interstate 17 to Phoenix.

In late November 1975, Lightfoot read a &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine article about the loss of the , which sank on November 10, 1975, on Lake Superior during a severe storm with the loss of all 29 crew members. The lyrics in his song, &quot;The Wreck of the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;&quot;, released the following year, were substantially based on facts in the article. It reached number two on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and was a number one hit in Canada. Lightfoot appeared at several 25th anniversary memorial services of the sinking, and stayed in personal contact with the family members of the men who perished in the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald.&quot;

In 1978, Lightfoot had another top 40 hit on the United States Hot 100, a re-recorded version of &quot;The Circle Is Small (I Can See It in Your Eyes),&quot; which reached number 33.

===1980s and 1990s===
During the 1980s and the 1990s, Lightfoot recorded six more original albums and a compilation for Warner Bros./Reprise: &quot;Dream Street Rose&quot; (1980), &quot;Shadows&quot; (1982), &quot;Salute&quot; (1983), &quot;East of Midnight&quot; (1986), another compilation &quot;Gord&#x27;s Gold Volume II&quot; (1988), &quot;Waiting for You&quot; (1993), and &quot;A Painter Passing Through&quot; (1998).

&quot;Dream Street Rose&quot; continues the folk-pop sound Lightfoot established during the previous decade. In addition to the title cut, it includes &quot;Ghosts of Cape Horn&quot; and &quot;On the High Seas&quot; and the Leroy Van Dyke standard &quot;The Auctioneer&quot;, that was a concert staple for Lightfoot from the mid-1960s to the 1980s. &quot;Shadows&quot; represents a departure from the acoustic sound of his guitar playing in the 1970s and emphasizes an adult-contemporary sound. Songs like &quot;Shadows&quot; and &quot;Thank You for the Promises&quot; contain an underlying sadness and resignation. The 1982 single &quot;Baby Step Back&quot; marked his last time in the top 50 in the US.

He released &quot;Salute&quot; in 1983. It produced no hit songs. The 1986 follow-up &quot;East of Midnight&quot; had several adult contemporary songs like &quot;A Passing Ship&quot;, &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Tag Along&quot;. The lead single, &quot;Anything for Love&quot;, was a hit on Billboard&#x27;s Adult Contemporary chart and also made the Pop and Country charts.

In April 1987, Lightfoot filed a lawsuit against composer Michael Masser, claiming that Masser&#x27;s melody for the song &quot;The Greatest Love of All&quot;, versions of which were recorded and released by George Benson in 1977 and Whitney Houston in 1985, had stolen 24 bars from Lightfoot&#x27;s 1971 hit song &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot;. The transitional section that begins &quot;I decided long ago never to walk in anyone&#x27;s shadow&quot; of the Masser song has the same melody as &quot;I never thought I could feel this way and I got to say that I just don&#x27;t get it; I don&#x27;t know where we went wrong but the feeling&#x27;s gone and I just can&#x27;t get it back&quot; of Lightfoot&#x27;s song. Lightfoot later stated that he did not want people thinking that he had stolen his melody from Masser. The case was settled out of court and Masser issued a public apology. 

He rounded out the decade with the &quot;Gord&#x27;s Gold Volume II,&quot; made up mostly of new versions of songs that were not part of the first Gord&#x27;s Gold project. Though commercially successful, the contrast between his vocals on the re-recorded tracks and the originals dramatically underscored just how much thinner his voice had become in the years since his radio peak. Lightfoot performed with Ian Tyson at the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Winter Olympics at McMahon Stadium in Calgary that same year.

During the 1990s, Lightfoot returned to his acoustic roots and recorded two albums. &quot;Waiting for You&quot; (1993) includes songs such as &quot;Restless&quot;, &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot;, and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Ring Them Bells&quot;. 1998&#x27;s &quot;A Painter Passing Through&quot; reintroduced a sound more reminiscent of his early recordings, with songs like &quot;Much to My Surprise&quot;, &quot;Red Velvet&quot;, &quot;Drifters&quot;, and &quot;I Used to Be a Country Singer&quot;. Throughout the decade, Lightfoot played about 50 concerts a year. In 1999 Rhino Records released &quot;Songbook&quot;, a four-CD boxed set of Lightfoot recordings with rare and unreleased tracks from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s plus a small hardback booklet for his fans that described how he created his songs and gave facts about his career.

===2000s===
In April 2000, Lightfoot taped a live concert in Reno, Nevada; this one-hour show was broadcast by CBC in October, and as a PBS special across the United States. PBS stations offered a videotape of the concert as a pledge gift, and a tape and DVD were released in 2001 in Europe and North America. This was the first Lightfoot concert video released. In April 2001, Lightfoot performed at the Tin Pan South Legends concert at Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, closing the show. In May, he performed &quot;Ring Them Bells&quot; at Massey Hall in honour of Bob Dylan&#x27;s 60th birthday.

By January 2002, Lightfoot had written 30 new songs for his next studio album. He recorded guitar and vocal demos of some of these new songs. In September, before the second concert of a two-night stand in Orillia, Lightfoot suffered severe stomach pain and was airlifted to McMaster University Medical Centre in Hamilton, Ontario. He underwent emergency vascular surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, and he remained in serious condition in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Lightfoot endured a six-week coma and a tracheotomy, and he underwent four surgical operations. All of his remaining 2002 concert dates were cancelled. More than three months after being taken to the McMaster Medical Centre, Lightfoot was released in December to continue his recovery at home.

In 2003, Lightfoot underwent follow-up surgery to continue the treatment of his abdominal condition. In November he signed a new recording contract with Linus Entertainment and began rehearsing with his band for the first time since his illness. Also in 2003, Borealis Records, a label related to Linus Entertainment, released &quot;Beautiful: A Tribute to Gordon Lightfoot&quot;. On this album, various artists, including The Cowboy Junkies, Bruce Cockburn, Jesse Winchester, Maria Muldaur, and The Tragically Hip interpreted Lightfoot&#x27;s songs. The final track on the album, &quot;Lightfoot&quot;, was the only song not previously released by Lightfoot. It was composed and performed by Aengus Finnan.

In January 2004, Lightfoot completed work on &quot;Harmony&quot;, which he had mostly recorded prior to his illness. The album was released on Linus Records on May 11 of that year. It was his 19th original album and included a single and new video for &quot;Inspiration Lady&quot;. Other notable entries are &quot;Clouds of Loneliness&quot;, &quot;Sometimes I Wish&quot;, &quot;Flyin&#x27; Blind&quot;, and &quot;No Mistake About It&quot;. The album also contains the upbeat, yet reflective track, &quot;End of All Time&quot;. In July 2004, he made a surprise comeback performance, his first since falling ill, at Mariposa in Orillia, performing &quot;I&#x27;ll Tag Along&quot; solo. In August he performed a five-song solo set in Peterborough, Ontario, at a flood relief benefit. In November he made his long-awaited return to the concert stage with two sold-out benefit shows in Hamilton. Lightfoot returned to the music business with his new album selling well and an appearance on &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;, where the six top contestants each performed a song of his, culminating in a group performance – on their own instruments – of his &quot;Canadian Railroad Trilogy&quot;. He returned to the road in 2005 on his &quot;Better Late Than Never Tour&quot;.

On September 14, 2006, while in the middle of a performance in Harris, Michigan, Lightfoot suffered a minor stroke that temporarily left him without the use of the middle and ring fingers on his right hand. He returned to performing nine days later and for a brief time used a substitute guitarist for more difficult guitar work. Full recovery took longer, &quot;I fought my way back in seven or eight months&quot;. In 2007, Lightfoot had full use of his right hand and played all of the guitar parts in concert as he originally wrote them. While a tour was being planned for 2008, Lightfoot&#x27;s manager, Barry Harvey, died at age 56 on December 4, 2007. In late 2009, Lightfoot undertook a 26-city tour.

===2010s and final work===
In February 2010, Lightfoot was the victim of a death hoax originating from Twitter, when then-CTV journalist David Akin posted on Twitter and Facebook that Lightfoot had died. Lightfoot was at a dental appointment at the time the rumours spread and found out when listening to the radio on his drive home. Lightfoot dispelled those rumours by phoning Charles Adler of CJOB, the DJ and radio station he heard reporting his demise, and did an interview expressing that he was alive and well. In 2012, Lightfoot continued to tour, telling a sold-out crowd June 15 at Ottawa&#x27;s National Arts Centre that he still performs sixty times a year. Lightfoot played two shows at the NAC after his induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Lightfoot performed at the 100th Grey Cup at Rogers Centre in November 2012, performing &quot;Canadian Railroad Trilogy&quot;, and was extremely well received. Lightfoot made his first tour of the United Kingdom in more than 35 years in 2016, with 11 dates across England, Ireland and Scotland. In a 2016 interview with &quot;The Canadian Press&quot; Lightfoot said: &quot;At this age, my challenge is doing the best show I can ... I&#x27;m very much improved from where I was and the seriousness with which I take it.&quot;

Lightfoot played at Canada&#x27;s 150th birthday celebration on Parliament Hill, July 1, 2017, introduced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The Prime Minister mentioned that Lightfoot had played the same stage exactly 50 years earlier, during Canada&#x27;s 100th birthday. His 2017 and 2018 tours included dozens of dates in Canada and the United States. Lightfoot&#x27;s 2019 tour was interrupted when he was injured while working out in a gym. In March 2020 his concert schedule was interrupted by governmental restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic.

Lightfoot had said in 2016 that he was not planning to return to songwriting late in life as he had concluded it was &quot;such an isolating thing&quot; for him earlier in his career, affecting his family life. However, in 2020 Lightfoot released his 20th studio album, &quot;Solo&quot;, unaccompanied by other musicians, 54 years after his debut album. It was put out by Warner Music Canada, marking Lightfoot&#x27;s return to Warner. 

Two weeks after his death in 2023, it was announced that his 2016 concert performance at Royal Albert Hall would be released in July 2023 as the live album &quot;At Royal Albert Hall&quot;.

==Sound and legacy==
Lightfoot&#x27;s sound, both in the studio and on tour, was centred on Lightfoot&#x27;s baritone voice and folk-based twelve-string acoustic guitar. From 1965 to 1970, lead guitarist Red Shea was an important supporting player, with bassists Paul Wideman and John Stockfish filling out the arrangements.

In 1968 bassist Rick Haynes joined the band, and lead guitarist Terry Clements joined the following year. Shea left the touring band in 1970 but continued to record with Lightfoot until 1975. He hosted his own Canadian variety show, played with Ian Tyson, and became band leader for Tommy Hunter&#x27;s TV show in the 1980s on CBC. Shea played on most of Lightfoot&#x27;s early hits. Haynes and Clements remained with Lightfoot and composed the core of his band.

In 1975, Pee Wee Charles added pedal steel guitar to Lightfoot&#x27;s songs. Drummer Barry Keane joined the following year and in 1981, keyboardist Mike Heffernan completed the ensemble. This five-piece backup band remained intact until 1987, when Charles left the band to operate a radio station in Southern Ontario.

Three members of Lightfoot&#x27;s band died over the years: Red Shea in 2008, Clements at 63 in 2011, and John Stockfish in 2012.

Haynes, Keane, and Heffernan continued touring and recording with Lightfoot, with Carter Lancaster, commended by Lightfoot as a &quot;great player&quot;, replacing Clements in 2011.

Alexander Carpenter, professor of musicology at the University of Alberta, noted the number of tributes to Lightfoot in the media that held him as &quot;quintessentially Canadian&quot; and questioned whether this nationalist, nostalgic view [blurred] &quot;the reality that Lightfoot was a musician who had a much wider influence on the popular music scene of the 1970s, well beyond Canada’s borders&quot;. Carpenter contended that Lightfoot both romanticized Canadian history and looked more deeply into the country&#x27;s past – an aspect of his music that has been &quot;largely lost in the effusive eulogies in the media&quot;. Lightfoot&#x27;s gentle, sentimental delivery style was noted by Carpenter as evoking a nostalgia, but this was not necessarily a &quot;compelling or accurate portrait of Canada&quot;, with the article concluding: &quot;Simply casting Lightfoot as an exemplar of Canadian-ness overshadows Lightfoot&#x27;s legacy. He was a songsmith and a musician who toiled for his entire career – spanning nearly six decades – to bring words and music together in meaningful and enduring ways.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Lightfoot was married three times. His first marriage in April 1963 was to Brita Ingegerd Olaisson, a Swede, with whom he had two children. They divorced in 1973, the marriage ending in part because of his infidelity. Lightfoot acknowledged that he found fidelity difficult in a long-distance relationship brought on by touring, which contributed to the failure of at least two relationships.

&quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot; was written in reflection upon his disintegrating marriage. At the request of his daughter he performed the lyrics with a slight change: the line &quot;I&#x27;m just trying to understand the feelings that you lack&quot; is altered to &quot;I&#x27;m just trying to understand the feelings that &quot;we&quot; lack.&quot; He said in an interview that the difficulty with writing songs inspired by personal stories is that there is not always the emotional distance and clarity to make lyrical improvements such as the one his daughter suggested.

Lightfoot was single for 16 years and had two other children from relationships between his first and second marriages.

In the early 1970s, Lightfoot was involved with Cathy Smith; their volatile relationship inspired his songs &quot;Sundown&quot; and &quot;Rainy Day People&quot; among others. &quot;Cathy was a great lady,&quot; Lightfoot told &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; after her death. &quot;Men were drawn to her, and she used to make me jealous. But I don&#x27;t have a bad thing to say about her.&quot; Smith later became notorious as the person who injected John Belushi with a fatal speedball.

In 1989, he married Elizabeth Moon. They had two children. They divorced in 2011 after a separation that Lightfoot said had lasted nine years.

Lightfoot married for a third time on December 19, 2014, at Rosedale United Church to Kim Hasse.

To stay in shape to meet the demands of touring and public performing, Lightfoot worked out in a gym six days per week, but declared in 2012 that he was &quot;fully prepared to go whenever I&#x27;m taken.&quot; He calmly stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve been almost dead a couple times, once almost for real ... I have more incentive to continue now because I feel I&#x27;m on borrowed time, in terms of age.&quot;

Lightfoot&#x27;s band members displayed loyalty to him, as both musicians and friends, recording and performing with him for as long as 55 years.

Lightfoot was a long-time resident of Toronto having settled in the Rosedale neighbourhood in the 1970s, which once hosted an infamous after-party following a Maple Leaf Gardens date on Bob Dylan&#x27;s Rolling Thunder Revue tour. In 1999, he purchased his final home in the Bridle Path neighbourhood, where he would eventually live across the street from fellow musician Drake who purchased property in the mid-2010s, and at various times down the street from both Mick Jagger and Prince.

Lightfoot was a lifelong fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs and was made an honorary captain of the team for the 1991–92 season.

In his last two years of touring, he had shortened the show to an hour, and was seated for the last few dates he performed. Lightfoot played what turned out to be his final concert on October 30, 2022, in Winnipeg. Remaining dates were postponed to 2023, but as his health declined, there were further postponements. In hospital in April, he fully cancelled his 2023 tour. Lightfoot died of natural causes two weeks later at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto on May 1, 2023, at the age of 84.

The Mariners&#x27; Church in Detroit (the &quot;Maritime Sailors&#x27; Cathedral&quot; mentioned in &quot;The Wreck of the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;&quot;) honored Lightfoot the day after his death by ringing its bell a total of 30 times, 29 for each of the crewmen lost on the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;, and the final time for Lightfoot himself. Additionally, the Split Rock Lighthouse, which overlooks Lake Superior in Minnesota, shone its light in honor of Lightfoot on May 3.

In the days after his death, a series of tributes took place in his hometown of Orillia, one of them previously planned. On May 6, the local opera house hosted Leisa Way &amp; the Wayward Wind Band, a previously planned show that paid tribute to Lightfoot that became a memorial show of sorts. It sold out in the event of his death. A day later, a public visitation was held at St. Paul&#x27;s United Church that drew more than 2,400 people. On May 8, 2023, a private funeral was held for Lightfoot at St. Paul&#x27;s United Church. His body was later cremated, and his ashes were buried next to his parents at St. Andrew&#x27;s and St. James&#x27; Cemetery in Orillia.

A tribute concert took place at Massey Hall on May 23, 2024, featuring performances of Lightfoot songs performed by his band, who continue to tour as The Lightfoot Band, and Blue Rodeo, City and Colour, Julian Taylor, Kathleen Edwards, Murray McLauchlan, Serena Ryder, Tom Wilson, Allison Russell, Burton Cummings, Tom Cochrane, Aysanabee, William Prince, Sylvia Tyson, and The Good Brothers.

==Honours and awards==

As an individual, apart from various awards associated with his albums and singles, Gordon Lightfoot received sixteen Juno Awards—for top folk singer in 1965, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1977, for top male vocalist in 1967, 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1973, and as composer of the year in 1972 and 1976. He received ASCAP awards for songwriting in 1971, 1974, 1976, and 1977, and was nominated for five Grammy Awards. In 1974 Lightfoot&#x27;s song &quot;Sundown&quot; was named pop record of the year by the Music Operators of America. In 1980 he was named Canadian male recording artist of the decade, for his work during the 1970s.

Lightfoot was celebrated in song by fellow Canadians The Guess Who on their 1968 album &quot;Wheatfield Soul&quot; with the track &quot;Lightfoot.&quot; The opening verse mentions John Stockfish and Red Shea leaving no doubt about the identity of this Lightfoot who &quot;is an artist painting Sistine masterpieces.&quot; The track also cleverly interjects titles of some of Gordon&#x27;s songs in a line of its lyrics, as shown in single quotes. &quot;And as the &#x27;Go-Go (girl went) Round&#x27;, and our heads were in a spin, I thought about the &#x27;Crossroads&#x27;, in the &#x27;Early Morning Rain&#x27;, and &#x27;Rosanna&#x27;&quot;.

Lightfoot was chosen as the celebrity captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs for the NHL&#x27;s 75th anniversary season in 1991–1992.

Lightfoot was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1986 and the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001. He was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 1998. In May 2003 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. Lightfoot was a member of the Order of Ontario, the highest honour in the province of Ontario. In 1977, he received the Vanier Award from the Canadian Jaycees. In 2007 Canada Post honoured Lightfoot and three other Canadian music artists (, Paul Anka, Joni Mitchell, and Anne Murray) with postage stamps highlighting their names and images. On June 24, 2012, Lightfoot was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in a New York City ceremony, along with Bob Seger.

He received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Trent University in spring 1979 and on June 6, 2015, Lightfoot received an honorary doctorate of music in his hometown of Orillia from Lakehead University.

In November 1997, the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award, Canada&#x27;s highest honour in the performing arts, was bestowed on Lightfoot. Lightfoot was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in May 2003. On February 6, 2012, Lightfoot was presented with the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario.

Between 1986 and 1988, Lightfoot&#x27;s friend Ken Danby (1940–2007), the realist painter, worked on a large (60 × 48 inches) portrait of Lightfoot dressed in the white suit he wore on the cover of the album &quot;East of Midnight&quot;. The picture is backlit by the sun, creating a visually iconic image of the singer.

On June 16, 2014, Lightfoot was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by SOCAN at the 2014 SOCAN Awards in Toronto.

On October 23, 2015, Lightfoot was honoured with a 4-metre tall bronze sculpture created by Timothy Schmalz in his hometown of Orillia, Ontario. The sculpture, called &quot;Golden Leaves—A Tribute to Gordon Lightfoot&quot;, features Lightfoot sitting cross-legged, playing an acoustic guitar underneath an arch of golden maple leaves. Many of the leaves depict scenes from Lightfoot&#x27;s 1975 greatest hits album, &quot;Gord&#x27;s Gold&quot;.

In 2017, Lightfoot rated fifth in the CBC&#x27;s list of the 25 best Canadian songwriters ever, and musician Ronnie Hawkins called Lightfoot the greatest songwriter in the world. That same year, Penguin Random House Canada published the Gordon Lightfoot biography, &quot;Lightfoot&quot;, written by journalist Nicholas Jennings and it topped the national bestseller lists. Lightfoot was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society.

He was the subject of the 2019 documentary &quot;Gordon Lightfoot: If You Could Read My Mind&quot;.

In 2022, Lightfoot received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

<text>Cyzicus ( ; ; ) was an ancient Greek town in Mysia in Anatolia in the current Balıkesir Province of Turkey. It was located on the shoreward side of the present Kapıdağ Peninsula (the classical Arctonnesus), a tombolo which is said to have originally been an island in the Sea of Marmara only to be connected to the mainland in historic times either by artificial means or an earthquake.

The site of Cyzicus, located on the Erdek and Bandırma roads, is protected by Turkey&#x27;s Ministry of Culture.

==History==


===Ancient===
The city was said to have been founded by Pelasgians from Thessaly, according to tradition at the coming of the Argonauts; later it received many colonies from Miletus, allegedly in 756 BC, but its importance began near the end of the Peloponnesian War when the conflict centered on the sea routes connecting Greece to the Black Sea. At this time, the cities of Athens and Miletus diminished in importance while Cyzicus began to prosper. Commander of the Athenian fleet Alcibiades defeated the Spartan fleet in a major naval engagement near Cyzicus known as the Battle of Cyzicus in 410 BC. Famed ancient philosopher Eudoxus of Cnidus established a school at Cyzicus and went with his pupils to Athens, visiting Plato. Later he returned to Anatolia to his hometown of Cnidus, and died circa 350 BC. The era of Olympiads in Cyzicus was reckoned from 135 or 139.

Owing to its advantageous position it speedily acquired commercial importance, and the gold staters of Cyzicus were a staple currency in the ancient world till they were superseded by those of Philip of Macedon. Its unique and characteristic coin, the &quot;cyzicenus&quot;, was worth 28 drachmae.
During the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) Cyzicus was subject to the Athenians and Lacedaemonians alternately. In the naval Battle of Cyzicus in 410 during the Peloponnesian War, an Athenian fleet routed and completely destroyed a Spartan fleet. At the peace of Antalcidas (387 BC), like the other Greek cities in Asia, it was made over to Persia. Alexander the Great later captured it from the Persians in 334 BC and was later claimed to be responsible for connecting the island to the mainland.

The history of the town in Hellenistic times is closely connected with that of the Attalids of Pergamon, with whose extinction it came into direct relations with Rome. Cyzicus was held for the Romans against King Mithridates VI of Pontus who besieged it with 300,000 men in 74 BC, the Siege of Cyzicus, but it withstood him stoutly, and the siege was raised by Lucullus: the loyalty of the city was rewarded by an extension of territory and other privileges. The Romans favored it and recognized its municipal independence. Cyzicus was the leading city of Northern Mysia as far as Troas.
Under Tiberius, it was incorporated into the Roman Empire but remained the capital of Mysia (afterwards, Hellespontus) and became one of the great cities of the ancient world.

There was a women&#x27;s cult at Cyzicus worshiping the goddess Artemis, which was called Dolon (Δόλων).

===Medieval===
Cyzicus was captured temporarily by the Arabs led by Muawiyah I in AD 675. It appears to have been ruined by a series of earthquakes beginning in 443, with the last in 1063. Although its population was transferred to Artake before the 13th century when the peninsula was occupied by the Crusaders, in 1324 the metropolitan of Cyzicus was one of three sees in Anatolia which was able to contribute a temporary annual subsidy to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Following its conquest by the Ottomans it underwent hard times. From a point between 1370 and 1372 until 1387, the metropolitan was empty; Speros Vryonis speculates this was due to financial difficulties. Later in the 14th century, the sees of Chalcedon and certain patriarchal possessions in Bithynia and Hellespont were bestowed on the metropolitan of Cyzicus.

In the Ottoman era, it was part of the kaza of Erdek in the province of Brusa.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Cyzicus, as capital of the Roman province of Hellespontus, was its ecclesiastical metropolitan see. In the &quot;Notitiae Episcopatuum&quot; of Pseudo-Epiphanius, composed in about 640, Cyzicus had 12 suffragan sees; Abydus, Baris in Hellesponto (between Sariköy and Biga), Dardanus, Germa in Hellesponto (ruins of Germaslu, Kirmasti, Girmas), Hadrianotherae (Uzuncia yayla), Ilium, Lampsacus, Miletopolis, Oca, Pionia (Avcılar), Poemanenum (Eskimanias), Troas. The province also included two autocephalous archiepiscopal sees: Parium and Proconnesus.

=== Residential bishops ===
Cyzicus had a catalogue of bishops beginning with the 1st century; Michel Le Quien mentions fifty-nine. A more complete list is found in Nicodemos, in the Greek &quot;Office of St. Emilian&quot; (Constantinople, 1876), 34–36, which has eighty-five names. Of particular importance are the famous Arian theologian Eunomius of Cyzicus; Saint Dalmatius; bishops Proclus and Germanus, who became Patriarchs of Constantinople; and Saint Emilian, a martyr in the 8th century. Another saint who came from Cyzicus, Saint Tryphaena of Cyzicus, is the patron saint of the city. Gelasius, a historian of Arianism, who wrote about 475, was born at Cyzicus.

* George Kleidas, Metropolitan of Cyzicus in ca. 1253–61
* Theodore Skoutariotes, Metropolitan of Cyzicus in ca. 1277
* Daniel Glykys, Metropolitan of Cyzicus in 1285–89
* Methodius, Metropolitan of Cyzicus from 1289
* Niphon I, Patriarch of Constantinople in 1310–14, was Metropolitan of Cyzicus in 1303–10
* Athanasios, Metropolitan of Cyzicus in 1324–47
* Theodoretos, &quot;proedros&quot; of Cyzicus in 1370–72
* Sebasteianos, Metropolitan of Cyzicus in 1381–86

* Theognostos, Metropolitan of Cyzicus in 1399–1405
* Makarios, Metropolitan of Cyzicus in 1409
* Metrophanes II, Patriarch of Constantinople in 1440–43, was Metropolitan of Cyzicus in 1436–40
* Cyril IV, Patriarch of Constantinople in 1711–13, was Metropolitan of Cyzicus before that

Cyzicus remained a metropolitan see of the Greek Orthodox Church until the 1923 Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations emptied it of Greek Orthodox faithful, whether they spoke Greek or Turkish. The last bishop of the see died in 1932. Today it is a titular metropolis of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.

=== Catholic titular see ===
Since 1885, the Catholic Church lists Cyzicus as a titular see of the highest (Metropolitan) rank, but vacant since 1974. Titular metropolitans were:

* John Baptist Lamy (1885.08.18 – 1888.02.13)
* William Benedict Scarisbrick, O.S.B. (1888.09.08 – 1908.05.07)
* José María Cázares y Martínez (1908.04.29 – 1909.03.31)
* Johannes Fidelis Battaglia (1909.07.03 – 1913.09.10)
* Simeón Pereira y Castellón (1913.12.02 – 1921.01.29)
* Giacomo Sereggi (1921.10.14 – 1922.04.11)
* Giuseppe Moràbito (1922.07.04 – 1923.12.03)
* Antal Papp (1924.07.14 – 1945.12.24)
* Manuel Marilla Ferreira da Silva (1949.05.29 – 1974.11.23)

==Monuments==
The site amid the marshes of Balkiz Serai is known as Bal-Kiz and entirely uninhabited, though under cultivation. The principal extant ruins are the walls, dating from the fourth century, which are traceable for nearly their whole extent, and the substructures of the temple of Hadrian, the ruins of a Roman aqueduct and a theatre.

The picturesque amphitheatre, intersected by a stream, was one of the largest in the world. Construction for the amphitheatre began in the middle of the first century until the end of the third. Its diameter was nearly and it is located at these coordinates , north of the main part of Cyzicus. Of this magnificent building, sometimes ranked among the seven wonders of the ancient world, thirty-one immense columns still stood erect in 1444. These have since been carried away piecemeal for building purposes.

The colossal foundations of the temple dedicated to the Emperor Hadrian are still visible: the columns were 21.35 metres high (about 70 feet), while the highest known elsewhere, those at Baalbek in Lebanon are only 19.35 metres (about 63 feet). The structure was the largest Greco-Roman temple ever built.

The monuments of Cyzicus were used by the Byzantine emperor Justinian as a quarry for the building of his Saint Sophia cathedral, and were still exploited by the Ottomans.

<text>Wei (), known in historiography as the Northern Wei (), Tuoba Wei (), Yuan Wei () and Later Wei (), was an imperial dynasty of China ruled by the Tuoba (Tabgach) clan of the Xianbei. The first of the Northern dynasties, it ruled northern China from 386 to 535 during the period of the Northern and Southern dynasties. Described as &quot;part of an era of political turbulence and intense social and cultural change&quot;, the Northern Wei dynasty is particularly noted for unifying northern China in 439, bringing an end to the chaotic Sixteen Kingdoms period, and strengthening imperial control over the rural landscape via reforms in 485. This was also a period of introduced foreign ideas, such as Buddhism, which became firmly established. The Northern Wei was referred to as &quot;Plaited Barbarians&quot; (索虜; &quot;suǒlǔ&quot;) by writers of the Southern dynasties, who considered themselves the true upholders of Chinese culture.

During the Taihe period (477–499), Empress Dowager Feng and Emperor Xiaowen instituted sweeping reforms that deepened the dynasty&#x27;s control over the local population in the Han hinterland. Emperor Xiaowen also introduced changes that eventually led to the dynasty moving its capital from Datong to Luoyang, in 494. The Tuoba adopted the surname Yuan (元) as a part of systematic sinicization.

Many antiques and art works, both Taoist art and Buddhist art, from this period have survived. It was the time of the construction of the Yungang Grottoes near Datong during the mid-to-late fifth century, and towards the latter part of the dynasty, the Longmen Grottoes outside the later capital city of Luoyang, in which more than 30,000 Buddhist images from the time of this dynasty have been found.

Towards the end of the Northern Wei dynasty there was significant internal dissension, resulting in a split into the Eastern Wei and the Western Wei dynasties under the rule of the same imperial house in 534–535, which were soon replaced by the Northern Qi and the Northern Zhou dynasties respectively. While the rule of Tuoba clan ended in the mid-6th century CE, its important policies, in particular the political recentralization reforms under Empress Dowager Feng and ethnic integration under Emperor Xiaowen, had a long-lasting impact on later periods of Chinese history.

==Rise of the Tuoba Xianbei==

=== Background ===
The Jin dynasty had developed an alliance with the Tuoba against the Xiongnu state Han-Zhao. In 315, the Tuoba chief, Tuoba Yilu was granted the title of Prince of Dai. After his death, however, the Dai state stagnated, and with the Jin ejected from northern China, the Dai largely remained a partial ally and a partial tributary state to Later Zhao and Former Yan, finally falling to Former Qin in 376.

After Former Qin&#x27;s emperor Fu Jiān was defeated by Jin forces at the Battle of Fei River in his failed bid to unify China, the Former Qin state began to break apart. By 386, Tuoba Gui (Emperor Daowu of Northern Wei), the son (or grandson) of Tuoba Shiyiqian (the last Prince of Dai), reasserted Tuoba independence initially as the Prince of Dai. Later he changed his title to the Prince of Wei, and his state was therefore known as Northern Wei.

=== War with Later Yan ===
At first, the Northern Wei was internally unstable and allied with the stronger Xianbei-led Later Yan dynasty that ruled most of present-day Hebei and Liaoning. As Wei grew in power by subjugating neighbouring tribes such as the Tiefu and Rouran, their alliance came to an end in 391 when Tuoba Gui refused to send more tribute after Yan detained his brother at their capital, and the Wei re-aligned themselves with the Western Yan in Shanxi. Wei continued hostilities even after Western Yan fell in 394, and in 395, the Later Yan emperor, Murong Chui, sent his Crown Prince, Murong Bao, with a massive army to lead a punitive expedition against Wei. However, at the Battle of Canhe Slope, Tuoba Gui inflicted the Later Yan army a heavy defeat.

In 396, Murong Chui personally led another campaign against Wei, but though he was initially successful, the Yan troops withdrew after he became deathly ill, and he soon died on his way back. Shortly after Murong Bao ascended the throne, Tuoba Gui began an invasion on Later Yan. During the invasion, Murong Bao decided to concentrate his forces in his capital and major cities, allowing the Wei forces to quickly overrun the Central Plains. A disastrous defeat at the Battle of Baisi and infighting among the imperial family finally forced the Later Yan to evacuate to Liaoning, while a branch in the south founded the Southern Yan in 398 before escaping to Shandong.

With a strong foothold on the Central Plains and the Yan state split into two, Northern Wei became a regional power in northeastern China, competing with the Qiang-led Later Qin dynasty to the west and the Eastern Jin dynasty to the south for a time. In 398, Tuoba Gui relocated the capital to Pingcheng, and in 399, he elevated his title to Emperor of Wei. After Tuoba Gui was assassinated in 409, his son, Tuoba Si (Emperor Mingyuan of Northern Wei) took the throne and continued his father&#x27;s efforts to consolidate their state.

==== Conflict with the Rouran ====
Earlier, among the tribes that the Wei had subjugated were the Rouran. In 394, a branch of them, led by Yujiulü Shelun rebelled and fled westward. By 402, Shelun had conquered many of the Tiele tribes and held a large territory in the northern steppe. That same year, he declared himself Qiudoufa Khagan (丘豆伐可汗), and for the rest of Northern Wei&#x27;s existence, the Rouran Khaganate was a recurring problem to the Wei on their northern borders.

=== Unification of Northern China ===

In 423, Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei ascended the throne with ambitions to reunify northern China. In 426, he began a war with the Xiongnu-led Hu Xia dynasty, which controlled the Ordos and Guanzhong regions in the west. By the following year, the Wei had taken the Xia capital, Tongwancheng and a substantial portion of their territory. The Xia could no longer pose a threat to Wei, though they still managed to annex Wei&#x27;s ally, the Western Qin dynasty in the Longxi. In 431, the last Xia emperor, Helian Ding was captured and handed over to Wei by the Tuyuhun.

The Northern Liang dynasty in the Hexi Corridor, led by the Juqu clan of Lushuihu ethnicity, submitted to Wei as a vassal after the Xia&#x27;s demise. With the west pacified, Emperor Taiwu shifted his focus to the east by launching incessant attacks on the Chinese Northern Yan dynasty in Liaoning. After a large-scale invasion in 436, the Yan ruler, Feng Hong abandoned his territory to Wei as he fled to the neighbouring Goguryeo. Finally, in 439, Emperor Taiwu launched a campaign and conquered the Northern Liang, hence unifying the north and bringing an end to the Sixteen Kingdoms period.

== Wars with the Southern dynasties ==
=== War with Liu Song ===

War between Northern Wei and Han-ruled Liu Song dynasty broke out while the former had not yet unified northern China. Emperor Wu of Song while still a Jin dynasty general, had conquered both Southern Yan in 410 and Later Qin in 417, pushing Jin frontiers further north into Wei territories. He then usurped the Jin throne and created the Song dynasty. After hearing the death of the Song emperor Wu in 422, Wei&#x27;s emperor Mingyuan broke off relations with Song and sent troops to invade its southern neighbor. His plan is to seize three major cities south of the Yellow River: Luoyang, Hulao, and Huatai. Sizhou (司州, central Henan) and Yanzhou (兗州, modern western Shandong) and most cities in Song&#x27;s Qing Province (青州, modern central and eastern Shandong) fell to the Wei army. The Liu Song general Tan Daoji commanded an army to try to save those cities and were able to hold Dongyang (東陽, in modern Qingzhou, Shandong), the capital of Qingzhou province. Northern Wei troops were eventually forced to withdraw after food supplies ran out. Wei forces also stalled in their siege of Hulao, defended by the capable Liu Song general Mao Dezu (毛德祖), but were meanwhile able to capture Luoyang and Xuchang (許昌, in modern Xuchang, Henan) in spring 423, cutting off the path of any Liu Song relief force for Hulao. In summer 423, Hulao fell. The campaign then ceased, with Northern Wei now in control of much of modern Henan and western Shandong.
Emperor Wen of Song continued the northern campaigns of his father. In 430, under the able general Dao Yanzhi, Liu Song recovered the four cities of Luoyang, Hulao, Huatai and Qiao&#x27;ao south of the Yellow River. However, the emperor&#x27;s unwillingness to advance past this line caused the destruction of the empire&#x27;s ally, Xia, by the Wei. The emperor was to repeat this mistake as several northern states such as Northern Yan who had offered to ally with Liu Song against Wei were declined, eventually leading to Wei&#x27;s unification of the North in 439.

In 450, Emperor Wen attempted to destroy the Northern Wei by himself and launched a massive invasion. Although initially successful, the campaign turned into a disaster. The Wei lured the Liu Song to cross the Yellow River, and then flanked them, destroying the Eastern army.

As the Liu Song armies retreated, Emperor Taiwu ordered his troop to move south. The provinces south of the Yellow River were devastated by the Wei army. Only Huatai, a fortified city, held out against the Wei. Wei troops retreated in January 451, however, the economic damage to the Song was immense. Emperor Wen made another attempt to conquer Northern Wei in 452, but failed again. On returning to the capital, he was assassinated by the heir apparent, Liu Shao.

In 466, Liu Zixun waged an unsuccessful civil war against the Emperor Ming of Liu Song. The governors of Xu Province (徐州) and Yan Province (兗州, modern western Shandong), who earlier pleaded allegiance to Liu Zixun, in fear of reprisal from the Liu Song emperor Emperor Ming, surrendered these territories to rival Northern Wei. Northern Wei forces quickly took up defense position against the attacking forces sent by Emperor Ming. With Liu Song forces unable to siege Pengcheng effectively, they were forced to withdraw in spring 467, making these populous provinces lost to the Northern Wei.

=== War with Southern Qi ===
In 479, Xiao Daocheng usurped the throne of Liu Song and became emperor of the new Southern Qi dynasty. Upon hearing the news, the Northern Wei emperor prepared to invade under the pretext of installing Liu Chang, son of Emperor Wen of Song who had been in exile in Wei since 465 AD.

Wei troops began to attack Shouyang but could not take the city. The Southern Qi began to fortify their capital, Jiankang in order to prevent further Wei raids.

Multiple sieges and skirmishes were fought until 481 but the war was without any major campaign. A peace treaty was signed in 490 with the Emperor Wu.

=== War with Liang ===

In 502, the Southern Qi general Xiao Yan toppled the emperor Xiao Baojuan after waging a three-year civil war against him. Xiao Yan enthroned in Jiankang to become Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty.

As early as 503 AD, the Northern Wei was hoping to restore the Southern Qi throne. Their plan was to install Xiao Baoyin, a Southern Qi prince, to become emperor of the puppet state. A southern expedition was led by Prince Yuan Cheng of Wei and Chen Bozhi, a former Qi general. Until spring 505, Xinyang and Hanzhong were fallen to the Northern Wei.

In 505, Emperor Wu began the Liang offensive. A strong army was quickly amassed under the general Wei Rui and caught the Wei by surprise, calling it the strongest army they have seen from the Southern dynasties in a hundred years. In spring 506, Wei Rui was able to capture Hefei. In fall 506, Wei Rui attacked the Northern Wei army stationed at Luokou for nearly a year without advancing. However, when Wei army gathered, Xiao Hong Prince of Linchuan, the Liang commander and younger brother of Emperor Wu, escaped in fear, causing his army to collapse without a battle. Northern Wei forces next attacked the fortress of Zhongli (鍾離, in modern Bengbu), However, they were defeated by a Liang army commanded by Wei Rui and Cao Jingzong, effectively ending the war. After the Battle of Zhongli, there would continue to be border battles from time to time, but no large-scale war for years.

In 524, while Northern Wei is plagued by agrarian rebellions to the north and west, Emperor Wu launched a number of attacks on Wei&#x27;s southern territory. Liang forces largely met little resistance. In spring 525, the Northern Wei general Yuan Faseng (元法僧) surrendered the key city of Pengcheng (彭城, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) to Liang. However, in summer 525, Emperor Wu&#x27;s son Prince Xiao Zong (蕭綜), grew suspicions that he was actually the son of Southern Qi&#x27;s emperor Xiao Baojuan (because his mother Consort Wu was formerly Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s concubine and had given birth to him only seven months after she became Emperor Wu&#x27;s concubine), surrendered Pengcheng to Northern Wei, ending Liang&#x27;s advances in the northeast, although in summer 526, Shouyang fell to Liang troops after Emperor Wu successfully reemployed the damming strategy. For the next several years, Liang continued to make minor gains on the borders with Northern Wei.
In 528, after a coup in Northern Wei, with the warlord Erzhu Rong overthrowing Empress Dowager Hu, a number of Northern Wei officials, including Yuan Yue, Yuan Yu, and Yuan Hao fled and surrendered territories they controlled to Liang. In winter 528, Emperor Wu created Yuan Hao the Prince of Wei—intending to have him lay claim to the Northern Wei throne and, if successful, become a Liang vassal. He commissioned his general Chen Qingzhi (陳慶之) with an army to escort Yuan Hao back to Northern Wei. Despite the small size of Chen&#x27;s army, he won battle after battle, and in spring 529, after Chen captured Suiyang (modern Shangqiu). Yuan Hao, with Emperor Wu&#x27;s approve, proclaimed himself the emperor of Northern Wei. In summer 529, troops under Erzhu unable to stand up to Chen Qingzhi, forcing Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei to flee the capital Luoyang. After capturing Luoyang, Yuan Hao secretly wanted to rebel against Liang: when Chen Qingzhi requested Emperor Wu to send reinforcements, Yuan Hao sent Emperor Wu a submission advising against it, and Emperor Wu, believing Yuan Hao, did not send additional troops. Soon, Erzhu and Emperor Xiaozhuang counterattacked, and Luoyang fell. Yuan Hao fled and was killed in flight, and Chen&#x27;s own army was destroyed, although Chen himself was able to flee back to Liang.

In 530, Emperor Wu made another attempt to establish a vassal regime in Northern Wei by creating Yuan Yue the Prince of Wei, and commissioning Yuan Yue&#x27;s uncle Fan Zun (范遵) with an army to escort Yuan Yue back to Northern Wei. Yuan Yue made some advances, particularly in light of the disturbance precipitated soon thereafter when Emperor Xiaozhuang ambushed and killed Erzhu Rong and was in turn overthrown by Erzhu Rong&#x27;s nephew Erzhu Zhao and cousin Erzhu Shilong. However, Yuan Yue realized that the Erzhus then became firmly in control of Luoyang and that he would be unable to defeat them, and so returned to Liang in winter 530.

In 532, with Northern Wei again in civil war after the general Gao Huan rose against the Erzhus, Emperor Wu against sent an army to escort Yuan Yue back to Northern Wei, and subsequently, Gao Huan welcomed Yuan Yue, but then decided against making Yuan Yue emperor. Subsequently, Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei, whom Gao made emperor, had Yuan Yue executed.

With Northern Wei divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in light of Emperor Xiaowu&#x27;s flight, Emperor Wu initially continued to send his forces to make minor territorial gains on the borders, against both Eastern Wei and Western Wei, for several years.

== Policies ==

Early in Northern Wei history, the state inherited a number of traditions from its initial history as a Xianbei tribe, and some of the more unusual ones, from a traditional Chinese standpoint, were:
* The officials did not receive salaries until Empress Dowager Feng took power, but were expected to requisition the necessities of their lives directly from the people they governed. As Northern Wei Empire&#x27;s history progressed, this appeared to be a major contributing factor leading to corruption among officials. Not until the second century of the empire&#x27;s existence did the state begin to distribute salaries to its officials.
* Empresses were not named according to imperial favors or nobility of birth, but required that the candidates submit themselves to a ceremony where they had to personally forge golden statues, as a way of discerning divine favor. Only an imperial consort who was successful in forging a golden statue could become the empress.
* All men, regardless of ethnicity, were ordered to tie their hair into a single braid that would then be rolled and placed on top of the head, and then have a cap worn over the head.
* When a crown prince is named, his mother, if still alive, must be forced to commit suicide. According to some historians, this may not have been a Tuoba traditional custom, but believed it to be a tradition instituted by the founding emperor Emperor Daowu based on Emperor Wu of Han&#x27;s execution of his favorite concubine Consort Zhao, the mother of his youngest son Liu Fuling (the eventual Emperor Zhao), before naming Prince Fuling crown prince.
* As a result, because emperors would not have mothers, they often honored their wet nurses with the honorific title, &quot;Nurse Empress Dowager&quot; (保太后, &quot;bǎo tài hòu&quot;).

As Sinicization of the Northern Wei state progressed, these customs and traditions were gradually abandoned.

After building a Chinese-style capital at Ye, Tuoba Gui sought to break the autonomy of the tribes. He reorganised the people into eight artificial tribes forcibly settled around the capital, which served as military units. He also removed the traditional tribal leaders. These reforms helped to change tribal loyalties and strengthen their loyalty to the dynasty. These tribes served as the Emperor&#x27;s personal professional military caste which helped to sustain the dynasty against any threats.

===The Reform under Empress Dowager Feng===

After securing Xianbei hegemony in the hinterland of China, the North Wei regime, under the rule of Empress Dowager Feng (438–490; also known as Empress Dowager Wenming) implemented a package of reforms in 485-486 AD, greatly solidifying its fiscal foundations and strengthening state penetration to the local society.

This reform introduced two far-reaching policies, namely, the &quot;equal-field landholding system&quot;, and the &quot;three-elder system&quot;. In the new &quot;equal-filed system&quot; (&quot;juntian zhi&quot;) unveiled in 485, the state redistributed abandoned or uncultivated land to commoner subjects attached with obligations of tax duty in the forms of grain, cloth, and labor service. In principle, each household was entitled to lands proportional to its labor power. Specifically, two types of land with tenure were assigned to a household: the first was open land for crop cultivation (40 mu ) for each adult male in the household, and half those amounts for adult females which was returnable after the recipient reached a specific advanced age or died. The second was the land to support textile production (10 or 20 mu, with the same gender distribution principle as open land) in one of two forms, namely, &quot;mulberry lands&quot; in silk-producing areas, and &quot;hemp lands&quot; in regions where sericulture was infeasible. Importantly, mulberry land was inheritable because of the long-term investment and care mulberry orchards required. Households possessing slaves and plow oxen were entitled to substantially larger allocations. The open land allocations would be doubled or tripled in areas where the land was less fertile or the population sparse. Sale of these land grants was forbidden, although subleasing was permitted under some circumstances. Land allocations would be adjusted annually to account for changes in the composition of the household and its number of oxen.

Another policy was the establishment of the three-elders system (sanzhang-zhi) in 486, which was designed to compile accurate population registers and to integrate village society into the state administration. In this system, five households were to make up one neighborhood (li), headed by one neighborhood elder (linzhang) while five neighborhoods were grouped into a village and headed by one village elder (lizhang). Finally, over five villages, there was one ward elder (dangzhang). The three elders, appointed by the government, were responsible for detecting and re-registering population outside of state accounts, requisitioning corvee labor and taxes, and taking care of the poor and orphaned under their jurisdiction. This policy significantly bolstered the state&#x27;s control over the common people.

The reforms of Empress Dowager Feng boosted agricultural production and tax receipts on a long-term basis, and broke the economic power of local aristocrats who sheltered residents under their control living in fortified villages that dotted the rural landscape of the North from taxation. The Northern Wei dynasty had doubled the registered population to more than 5 million households since the reforms.

These institutional infrastructures erected by the Northern Wei state survived the fall of the dynasty and paved the way for China&#x27;s eventual unification in 589 AD under the Sui dynasty.

===Later reforms===

The Northern Wei used the previous dynasties&#x27; Nine-rank system as a way of assigning official positions to wealthy and prestigious Han Chinese families, according to hereditary rank. Officials were also given considerable autonomy, such as appointing subordinate officials.

===Deportations===
During the reign of Emperor Daowu (386–409), the total number of deported people from the regions east of Taihangshan (the former Later Yan territory) to Datong was estimated to be around 460,000. Deportations typically took place once a new piece of territory had been conquered.

===Sinicization===

As the Northern Wei state grew, the emperors&#x27; desire for Han Chinese institutions and advisors grew. Cui Hao (381–450), an advisor at the courts in Datong played a great part in this process. He introduced Han Chinese administrative methods and penal codes in the Northern Wei state, as well as creating a Taoist theocracy that lasted until 450. The attraction of Han Chinese products, the royal court&#x27;s taste for luxury, the prestige of Chinese culture at the time, and Taoism were all factors in the growing Chinese influence in the Northern Wei state. Chinese influence accelerated during the capital&#x27;s move to Luoyang in 494 and Emperor Xiaowen continued this by establishing a policy of systematic sinicization that was continued by his successors. Xianbei traditions were largely abandoned. The royal family took the sinicization a step further by changing their family name to Yuan. Marriages to Chinese families were encouraged. With this, Buddhist temples started appearing everywhere, displacing Taoism as the state religion. The temples were often created to appear extremely lavish and extravagant on the outside of the temples. Also from 460 onwards the emperors started erecting huge statues of the Buddha carved near their capital Pingcheng which declared the emperors as the representatives of the Buddha and the legitimate rulers of China.

The Northern Wei started to arrange for Han Chinese elites to marry daughters of the Xianbei Tuoba royal family in the 480s. More than fifty percent of Tuoba Xianbei princesses of the Northern Wei were married to southern Han Chinese men from the imperial families and aristocrats from southern China of the Southern dynasties who defected and moved north to join the Northern Wei. Some Han Chinese exiled royalty fled from southern China and defected to the Xianbei. Several daughters of the Xianbei Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei were married to Han Chinese elites, the Liu Song royal Liu Hui 劉輝), married Princess Lanling (蘭陵公主) of the Northern Wei, Princess Huayang (華陽公主) to Sima Fei (司馬朏), a descendant of Jin dynasty (266–420) royalty, Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei&#x27;s sisters, the Shouyang Princess, was wedded to the Liang dynasty ruler Emperor Wu of Liang&#x27;s son Xiao Zong . One of Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei&#x27;s sisters was married to Zhang Huan, a Han Chinese, according to the Book of Zhou (Zhoushu). His name is given as Zhang Xin in the &quot;Book of Northern Qi&quot; (Bei Qishu) and &quot;History of the Northern Dynasties&quot; (Beishi) which mention his marriage to a Xianbei princess of Wei. His personal name was changed due to a naming taboo on the emperor&#x27;s name. He was the son of Zhang Qiong.
When the Eastern Jin dynasty ended Northern Wei received the Han Chinese Jin prince Sima Chuzhi () as a refugee. A Northern Wei Princess married Sima Chuzhi, giving birth to Sima Jinlong (). Northern Liang Xiongnu King Juqu Mujian&#x27;s daughter married Sima Jinlong.

The Northern Wei&#x27;s Eight Noble Xianbei surnames () were the Buliugu (步六孤), Helai (賀賴), Dugu (), Helou (賀樓), Huniu (忽忸), Qiumu (丘穆), Gexi (紇奚), and Yuchi (). They adopted Chinese last names.

Kongzi was honoured in sacrifices as was Earth and Heaven by the northern dynasties of non-Han origin. Kongzi was honored by the Murong Wei Former Yan Xianbei leader. Kongzi was honored by the Di ruler Fu Jian (337–385). Kongzi was honored in sacrifices by the Northern Wei Xianbei dynasty. Kongzi was honored by Yuoba Si, the Mingyuan emperor. Han dynasty emperors, Shang dynasty ruler Bigan, Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun were honored by Yuoba Si, the Mingyuan Emperor. Kongzi was honored extensively by Tuoba Hong, the Xiaowen Emperor.

A fief of 100 households and the rank of (崇聖侯) &quot;Marquis who worships the sage&quot; was bestowed upon a Confucius descendant, Yan Hui&#x27;s lineage had 2 of its scions and Confucius&#x27;s lineage had 4 of its scions who had ranks bestowed on them in Shandong in 495 and a fief of ten households and rank of (崇聖大夫) &quot;Grandee who venerates the sage&quot; was bestowed on Kong Sheng (孔乘) who was Confucius&#x27;s scion in the 28th generation in 472 by Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei.

An anti-Buddhist plan was concocted by the Celestial Masters under Kou Qianzhi along with Cui Hao under the Taiwu Emperor. The Celestial Masters of the north urged the persecution of Buddhists under the Taiwu Emperor in the Northern Wei, attacking Buddhism and the Buddha as wicked and as anti-stability and anti-family. Anti Buddhism was the position of Kou Qianzhi. There was no ban on the Celestial Masters despite the nonfullfilment of Cui Hao and Kou Qianzhi&#x27;s agenda in their anti-Buddhist campaign.

Cui Zhen&#x27;s wife Han Farong was buried in a Datong located grave.

=== Building the Great Wall ===
To resist the threats posed by the Rourans, Northern Wei emperors started to embark on building its own Great Wall, the first since the Han dynasty. In 423, a defence line over 2,000 &quot;li&quot; () long was built; its path roughly followed the old Zhao wall from Chicheng County in Hebei Province to Wuyuan County, Inner Mongolia. In 446, 100,000 men were put to work building an inner wall from Yanqing, passing south of the Wei capital Pingcheng, and ending up near Pingguan on the eastern bank of the Yellow River. The two walls of Northern Wei formed the basis of the double-layered Xuanfu–Datong wall system that protected Beijing a thousand years later during the Ming dynasty.

===Governance===

Local society in northern China was not governed by civil bureaucrats but by military clientage during the reign of the Northern Wei Xianbei emperors, with the local Han Chinese aristocratic families jointly ruling and controlling power with them. The Han Chinese aristocrat families ruled over their private fiefs (home jurisdictions) with large military authority and civil authority as entrusted to them by the Xianbei emperor. The Xianbei emperor also turned their own Xianbei nomad warriors into a hereditary military caste and extinguish their tribal loyalties. To the consternation of the Xianbei nobles, Han Chinese aristocrats started to be appointed to government positions by the Northern Wei emperors when the Central Plains population regrew in the middle of the 5th century.

Han Chinese commoners started pledging their allegiance as buqu (部曲) (armed retainers) to elite Han Chinese aristocratic magnates in their wubao (塢堡) (fortified settlements) when the local communities relied on the magnates to direct their defense after the 311 sack of Luoyang. Oaths were pledged in alliances between paramount commanders who joined their fortress villages together in leagues. The magnates retained the services and fealty of their thrall retainers after the fighting was over. Subject to the emperor was overtaken by the concept of village membership. Magnates had both unrelated bondsmen, private clients and fellow clan kinsmen in their armies. 50 to 60 square leagues of farmland in Hebei&#x27;s southwest Taihang mountain foothills were taken as a fief by thousands of members of the Han Chinese aristocratic Zhaojun Li clan under the leader of a cadet leader of the clan, Li Xianfu. Clan loyalties were extensively utilized by local magnates. Li Xianfu was appointed as zongzhu (宗主) (clan chief) by the clan collectively in spite of him not inheriting the officer and rank of his father which went to his elder brother. Local level order was controlled by Li Xiangu and other magnates and the Northern Wei Xianbei monarchs had to rely on them. The Northern Wei gave them title of governors officially in their fiefs.

In Shanxi and Hebei the magnate clans became even more powerful and local society was dominated by them and they experienced increased solidarity due to Northern Wei patronage. These arrangement with local Han Chinese aristocratic magnate clans led to a lack of soldiers and revenue directly under the control of the Northern Wei state itself. Particularly after the 460s when Liu Song held Huaibei and Shandong were taken by the Northern Wei they needed soldiers and tax revenue. Nobles, officials and meritorious generals received large amounts of lihu (隸戶) or tongli (僮隸) (bondservants) from war captives in according with Xianbei nomad tradition during wars. These bondservants, compared to the past, made up a large part of the farming population under Northern Wei. The zahu (雜戶) (service households) made out of artisans, weavers, salt makers, entertainers, clerks were also turned into hereditary occupations among war captives captured by Northern Wei, while privately entertainers and craftsmen were also attached to magnate families. The few independent farmers under Northern Wei were subjected to the demands of corvée labor from the states due to the fact that Xianbei noble and Han Chinese aristocratic households controlled the majority of the population as retainers.

The Northern Wei attempted to back up its thinly stretched Xianbei warriors by conscription Han Chinese free subjects into their military in 473 but this only let to the magnates gaining more private client retainers as the Han Chinese farmers chose to became retainers to evade the conscription and corvée. These were the regions for the reforms under Empress Dowager Wenming (438–90) when she tried to turn the state into a Han Chinese style bureaucratic centralized empire. She reigned as regent for her grandson Emperor Xiaowen and brought into the Northern Wei government Han Chinese aristocrats. The capital was moved to the Central Plain&#x27;s Luoyang away from Pingcheng in 493 by Emperor Xiaowen.
The system of having retainers (buqu) existed in the Xin dynasty to the Tang dynasty and was part of the Northern Wei.

== Disunity and breakup ==

The fall of Northern Wei began with rebellions staged by Six Garrison populations. This rebellion was rooted in the internal struggle within the Six Garrisons between upper-class military elites and lower-class soldiers and ethnic settlers. Six Garrisons were established to protect the Northern Wei regime from the invasion of Rouran and consisted of numerous ethnic groups, such as Xianbei, Gaoche, and Xiongnu as well as Han Chinese. Tribes were the basic social units, although grouped into militarized garrisons. The upper-class military elites who occupied governing offices mainly included the middle-to-low aristocrats of the Xianbei, other tribe chiefs, and Han strongmen. The internal conflict between upper-class military elites and lower-class soldiers and ethnic settlers was on the basis of the vulnerable economic base (heavily relied on livestock production and the support from the central government) and harsh environmental conditions in Six Garrison areas. The struggle for survival drove military officers of Six Garrisons to implement unfair policies biased to their own ethnic groups at the cost of others. The cause of these wars was the growing rift between the governing aristocracy which was increasingly adopting Han-style sedentary policies and lifestyles and their nomadic tribal armies who continued to preserve the old steppe way of life.

=== Six Frontier Towns rebellions ===

Rebellions broke out on six major garrison-towns on the northern border and spread like wildfire throughout the north. These rebellions lasted for a decade.

In 523, nomadic Rouran tribes suffered a major famine due to successive years of drought. In April, the Rouran Khan sent troops to raid the Wei territory. People of the town rose up and killed the town&#x27;s commander. Rebellion soon broke out against across the region. In Woye, Poliuhan Baling (破六韓拔陵) became a rebel leader. His army quickly took Woye and laid siege to Wuchuan and Huaishuo.

Elsewhere in Qinzhou (Gansu), Qiang ethnic leaders such as Mozhe Dati (莫折大提) also rose up against the government. In Gaoping (present-day Guyuan), Hu Chen (胡琛) and the Xiongnu rebelled and titled himself the King of Gaoping. In Hebei, Ge Rong rebelled, proclaiming himself the Emperor of Qi.

The Poliuhan Baling rebellion was defeated in 525. Similar rebellions had spread to other regions such as Hebei and Guanzhong and were pacified by 530.

=== Rise of Erzhu Rong and Heyin Massacre ===
Exacerbating the situation, Empress Dowager Hu poisoned her own son Emperor Xiaoming in 528 after Emperor Xiaoming showed disapproval of her handling of the affairs as he started coming of age and got ready to reclaim the power that had been held by the empress in his name when he inherited the throne as an infant, giving the Empress Dowager rule of the country for more than a decade. Upon hearing the news of the 18-year-old emperor&#x27;s death, the general Erzhu Rong, who had already mobilised on secret orders of the emperor to support him in his struggle with the Empress Dowager Hu, turned toward Luoyang. Announcing that he was installing a new emperor chosen by an ancient Xianbei method of casting bronze figures, Erzhu Rong summoned the officials of the city to meet their new emperor. However, on their arrival, he told them they were to be punished for their misgovernment and butchered them, throwing the Empress Hu and her candidate (another puppet child emperor Yuan Zhao) into the Yellow River. Reports estimate 2,000 courtiers were killed in this Heyin massacre on the 13th day of the second month of 528. Erzhu Rong claimed Yuan Ziyou grandson of Emperor Xianwen the new emperor as Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei.

In 529, Liang general Chen Qingzhi sacked Luoyang, forced Emperor Xiaozhuang to flee and claimed Yuan Hao another grandson of Emperor Xianwen emperor, before his final defeat by Erzhu Rong.

=== Civil war and the two generals ===
The Erzhu clan dominated the imperial court thereafter, the emperor held power in name only and most decisions actually went through the Erzhus. The emperor did stop most of the rebellions, largely reunifying the Northern Wei state. However, Emperor Xiaozhuang, not wishing to remain a puppet emperor and highly wary of the Erzhu clan&#x27;s widespread power and questionable loyalty and intentions towards the throne (after all, this man had ordered a massacre of the court and put to death a previous emperor and empress before), killed Erzhu Rong in 530 in an ambush at the palace, which led to a resumption of civil war, initially between Erzhu&#x27;s clan and Emperor Xiaozhuang, and then, after their victory over Emperor Xiaozhuang in 531, between the Erzhu clan and those who resisted their rule. In the aftermath of these wars, two generals set in motion the actions that would result in the splitting of the Northern Wei into the Eastern and Western Wei.

General Gao Huan was originally from the northern frontier, one of many soldiers who had surrendered to Erzhu, who eventually became one of the Erzhu clan&#x27;s top lieutenants. But later, Gao Huan gathered his own men from both Han and non-Han troops, to turn against the Erzhu clan, entering and taking the capital Luoyang in 532. Confident in his success, he deposed Emperor Jiemin of Northern Wei, the emperor supported by the Erzhu clan, as well as Yuan Lang the emperor previously supported by Gao himself, and set up a new emperor Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei on the Luoyang throne and continued his campaigns abroad. The emperor, however, together with the military head of Luoyang, Husi Chun, began to plot against Gao Huan. Gao Huan succeeded, however, in keeping control of Luoyang, and the emperor and a handful of followers fled west, to the region ruled by the powerful warlord Yuwen Tai. Gao Huan then announced his decision to move the Luoyang court to his capital city of Ye. &quot;Within three days of the decree, 400,000 families—perhaps 2,000,000 people—had to leave their homes in and around the capital to move to Yeh as autumn turned to winter.&quot; There now existed two rival claimants to the Northern Wei throne, leading to the state&#x27;s division in 534–535 into the Eastern Wei and Western Wei. The Eastern Wei were initially significantly stronger and looked likely to end Western Wei quickly, but were defeated at the Battle of Shayuan in 537, confirming the split of the Northern Wei

=== Fall ===
Neither Eastern Wei nor Western Wei was long-lived. In 550, Gao Huan&#x27;s son Gao Yang forced Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing the Northern Qi. Similarly, in 557, Yuwen Tai&#x27;s nephew Yuwen Hu forced Emperor Gong of Western Wei to yield the throne to Yuwen Tai&#x27;s son Yuwen Jue, ending the Western Wei and establishing the Northern Zhou. In 581, the Northern Zhou official Yang Jian had the emperor to yield the throne to him, establishing the Sui dynasty.

== Legacy and culture ==
The Northern Wei dynasty was the most long-lived and most powerful of the northern dynasties prior to the reunification of China by the Sui dynasty. Its most important legacy was the sweeping reforms introduced under Empress Dowager Feng and continued under her successors. While the dynasty officially ended in 557, these reforms, especially the equal-field landholding system, lasted until the mid-eight century CE. The reforms completely reshaped China&#x27;s political development as they reverted the trends associated with feudalism in earlier times () such as the devolution of power to local strongmen and political fragmentation. Historians generally credit the Northern Wei dynasty for laying the foundation for China&#x27;s eventual reunification under the Sui dynasty. Ray Huang, for example, pointed out that these reforms brought about the &quot;infrastructure of a regenerated empire&quot; and new rulers after Northern Wei, such as Yang Jian of the Sui dynasty, would inherit &quot;the bulk of the agricultural resources and the peasant manpower&quot; made available via the reforms to reunify the whole of China.

Many of the most important heritages of China, such as the Yungang Grottoes, the Longmen Caves, the Shaolin Monastery, the Songyue Pagoda, were built by the Northern Wei. Important books such as Qimin Yaoshu and Commentary on the Water Classic, a monumental work on China&#x27;s geography, was written during the era.

The legend of Hua Mulan is originated from the Northern Wei era, in which Mulan, disguised as a man, takes her aged father&#x27;s place in the Wei army to defend China from Rouran invaders.

===Central Asian influences===

Northern Wei art came under influence of Indian and Central Asian traditions through the mean of trade routes. A Central Asian (胡) named An Tong (安同), a descendant of the Parthian missionary An Shigao, was political counsellor to the first Northern Wei emperor Tuoba Gui (370–409). Most importantly for Chinese art history, the Wei rulers converted to Buddhism and became great patrons of Buddhist arts. Numerous Central Asian objects have been found in Northern Wei tombs, such as the tomb of Feng Hetu. It is believed that the main influx of Western objects among the Northern Wei followed the defeat of the Rouran circa 450 CE, which allowed for the visit of diplomatic and, mainly, merchant caravans from Khotan, Kashmir and Sasanian Persia.
Also, when the Northern Wei defeated the Northern Liang in 439 CE, they captured a great number of Sogdian merchants from their capital Wuwei, and resettled them in their own capital at Datong, thereby fostering trade.

<text>In Greek mythology, Parthenopaeus or Parthenopaios (; ) was one of the Seven against Thebes, a native of Arcadia, described as young and outstandingly good-looking, but at the same time arrogant, ruthless and over-confident, although an unproblematic ally for the Argives.

== Mythology ==

===Early life===
Parthenopaeus was the son of Atalanta by either her husband Hippomenes (Melanion), or by Meleager, or Ares. A less common version makes him a son of Talaus and Lysimache (which would make him a close relative of the other members of the Seven and thereby a motive for his involvement in the war). Hyginus writes that he was left exposed by Atalanta on Mount Parthenius (&quot;virginal&quot;) in Arcadia, so that she could conceal the fact that she was not a virgin anymore; the name Parthenopaeus is accordingly interpreted by Hyginus as &quot;seemingly-virginal&quot; or the like, as if referring to the fact that his mother was pretending to still be a virgin. He was subsequently rescued by a shepherd, along with Telephus, the son of Auge and Heracles, who had been abandoned on the same mountain, and the two boys became good friends. Parthenopaeus went with Telephus to Teuthrania, where he helped him repulse Idas&#x27;s invasion of the kingdom of Teuthras.

Euripides noted that Parthenopaeus moved from Arcadia to Argos at a young age, and seemed to have enjoyed a friendly reception from the Argives.

===War on Thebes===
Parthenopaeus was persuaded by Adrastus to join in the war against Thebes. During the attack on Thebes, Parthenopaeus was the assailant on the Electran Gates, or, alternatively, the Neitian Gates. In Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;, he is portrayed carrying a shield with the image of the Sphinx devouring Thebans, and swearing by his spear (which, it was said, was for him more sacred than the gods, and more precious than his own sight) to destroy the city even despite the will of Zeus. Yet according to Euripides, on the shield was depicted his mother shooting a wild boar. He was confronted by Actor at the gate. 
Parthenopaeus was killed by either Periclymenus or Amphidicus (Asphodicus), a son of Astacus. According to Euripides, Periclymenus killed him by heaving a load of stones on his head.

Parthenopaeus is given a detailed treatment in Book 9 of Statius&#x27; &quot;Thebaid&quot;, which concludes with his &quot;aristeia&quot; and death, which differs considerably from those cited above. In the poem, Parthenopaeus fights fiercely and vigorously, killing a number of opponents, and dismisses the advice of his tutor Dorceus, who calls on him to be more careful. In the meantime, Atalanta, tormented by nightmares of his non-return, prays to Artemis that he may survive, or at least die a glorious death. Eventually Ares, instigated by his mistress Aphrodite, makes Artemis retreat from the battlefield and causes Dryas, a son of Orion, to attack and dissolve the Arcadian contingent. Parthenopaeus, intimidated, still attempts to shoot Dryas but the latter mortally wounds him with a thrown spear, and is himself instantly killed by someone whose identity remains unrevealed. Parthenopaeus dies in the arms of his companions, giving last instructions to Dorceus, and admitting that he must have been too young to go to war.

In the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, the ghost of Parthenopaeus, along with those of other members of the Seven, is glimpsed by Aeneas in the Underworld.

The son of Parthenopaeus by the nymph Clymene, variously named Promachus, Tlesimenes or Stratolaus, was one of the Epigoni.
