<text>In ancient Greek mythology and religion, Selene (; , meaning &quot;Moon&quot;) is the goddess and personification of the Moon. Also known as Mene (), she is traditionally the daughter of the Titans Hyperion and Theia, and sister of the sun god Helios and the dawn goddess Eos. She drives her moon chariot across the heavens. Several lovers are attributed to her in various myths, including Zeus, Pan, and the mortal Endymion. In post-classical times, Selene was often identified with Artemis, much as her brother, Helios, was identified with Apollo. Selene and Artemis were also associated with Hecate and all three were regarded as moon and lunar goddesses, but only Selene was regarded as the personification of the Moon itself.

Her equivalent in Roman religion and mythology is the goddess Luna.

== Etymology and origins ==
=== Names ===
The name &quot;Selene&quot; is derived from the Greek noun &quot;selas&quot; (&quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;light, brightness, gleam&quot;. In the Doric and Aeolic dialects, her name was also spelled (&quot;Selána&quot;) and (&quot;Selánna&quot;) respectively.

Selene was also called Mene. The Greek word &quot;mene&quot;, meant the moon, and the lunar month. The masculine form of &quot;mene&quot; (&quot;men&quot;) was also the name of the Phrygian moon-god Men. Mene and Men both derive from Proto-Hellenic &quot;*méns&quot; (&quot;month&quot;), itself from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*mḗh₁n̥s&quot; (meaning moon, the lunar month), which probably comes from the root &quot;*meh₁-&quot; (&quot;to measure&quot;), and is cognate with the English words &quot;Moon&quot; and &quot;month&quot;. The Greek Stoic philosopher Chrysippus interpreted Selene and Men as, respectively, the female and male aspects of the same god.

Although no clear attestation for Selene herself (or any predecessor of hers) has been discovered, in Mycenaean Greek the word for month &#x27;men&#x27; has been found in Linear B spelled as (me-no, from genitive form , &quot;mēnós&quot;).

Just as Helios, from his identification with Apollo, is called Phoebus (&quot;bright&quot;), Selene, from her identification with Artemis, is also called Phoebe (feminine form). Also from Artemis, Selene was sometimes called &quot;Cynthia&quot;, meaning &quot;she of Mount Cynthus&quot; (the birthplace of Artemis).

=== Origin ===
Selene, along with her brother, her sister and the sky-god Zeus, is one of the few Greek deities of a clear Proto-Indo-European origin, although they were sidelined by later non-PIE newcomers to the pantheon, as remaining on the sidelines became their primary function, to be the minor deities the major ones were juxtaposed to, thus helping keep the Greek religion Greek.

The original PIE moon deity has been reconstructed as &quot;*Meh₁not&quot; (from which &#x27;Mene&#x27;, Selene&#x27;s byname, is derived), and it appears that it was a male god. The Greek offshoot of this deity however is female. The ancient Greek language had three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine and neuter), so when a god or a goddess personified an object or a concept, they inherited the gender of the corresponding noun; selene, the Greek noun for &#x27;Moon&#x27;, is a feminine one (whereas men is a masculine one), so the deity embodying it is also by necessity female. In PIE mythology, the Moon, which is a male figure, was seen as forming a pair–usually wedlock–with the Sun, which is a female figure, and which in Greek mythology is recognized in the male deity and Selene&#x27;s brother Helios. It seems however that unlike the Dawn (Eos) and the Sun (Helios), the Moon had very little importance in PIE mythology.

Although attempts have been made to connect Selene to Helen of Troy due to the similarity of their names, in two early dedications to Helen from Laconia her name is spelled with a digamma (), ruling out any possible connection between them. &#x27;Helen&#x27; is more likely related to &#x27;Helios&#x27; instead, and it seems that the two figures stem from a common Proto-Indo-European ancestor, the Sun Maiden.

== Descriptions ==
Surviving descriptions of Selene&#x27;s physical appearance and character, apart from those which would apply to the moon itself, are scant. There is no mention of Selene as a goddess in either the &quot;Iliad&quot; or the &quot;Odyssey&quot; of Homer, while her only mention in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; is as the daughter of Hyperion and Theia, and sister of Helios and Eos. She was, however, the subject of one of the thirty-three &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;, which gives the following description:

Two other sources also mention her hair. The &quot;Homeric Hymn to Helios&quot; uses the same epithet &quot;εὐπλόκαμος&quot; (&quot;bright-tressed&quot;), used in the above &quot;Hymn to Selene&quot; (elsewhere translated as &quot;rich-&quot;, &quot;lovely-&quot;, or &quot;well-tressed&quot;), while Epimenides uses the epithet &quot;ἠυκόμοιο&quot; (&quot;lovely-haired&quot;).

In late accounts, Selene (like the moon itself) is often described as having horns. The &quot;Orphic Hymn to Selene&quot; addresses her as &quot;O bull-horned Moon&quot;, and further describes her as &quot;torch-bearing, ... feminine and masculine, ... lover of horses,&quot; and grantor of &quot;fulfillment and favor&quot;. Empedocles, Euripides and Nonnus all describe her as γλαυκῶπις (&quot;glaukṓpis&quot;, &quot;bright-eyed&quot;, a common epithet of the goddess Athena) while in a fragment from a poem, possibly written by Pamprepius, she is called κυανῶπις (&quot;kyanṓpis&quot;, &quot;dark-eyed&quot;). Mesomedes of Crete calls her γλαυκὰ (&quot;glaukà&quot;, &quot;silvery grey&quot;).

== Family ==
=== Parents ===
The usual account of Selene&#x27;s origin is given by Hesiod in his &quot;Theogony&quot;, where the sun-god Hyperion espoused his sister Theia, who gave birth to &quot;great Helios and clear Selene and Eos who shines upon all that are on earth and upon the deathless Gods who live in the wide heaven&quot;. The &quot;Homeric Hymn to Helios&quot; follows this tradition: &quot;Hyperion wedded glorious Euryphaëssa, his own sister, who bare him lovely children, rosy-armed Eos and rich-tressed Selene and tireless Helios&quot;, with &quot;Euryphaëssa&quot; (&quot;widely shining&quot;) probably being an epithet of Theia. However, the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Hermes&quot; has Selene as the daughter of Pallas, the son of an otherwise unknown Megamedes. This Pallas is possibly identified with the Pallas, who, according to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, was the son of the Titan Crius, and thus Selene&#x27;s cousin. Other accounts give still other parents for Selene: Euripides has Selene as the daughter of Helios (rather than sister), while an Aeschylus fragment possibly has Selene as the daughter of Leto, as does a scholium on Euripides&#x27;s play &quot;The Phoenician Women&quot; which adds Zeus as the father. Furthermore, in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, when Nisus calls upon Selene/the Moon, he addresses her as &quot;daughter of Latona.&quot;

=== Offspring ===
According to the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Selene&quot;, the goddess bore Zeus a daughter, Pandia (&quot;All-brightness&quot;), &quot;exceeding lovely amongst the deathless gods&quot;. The 7th century BC Greek poet Alcman makes Ersa (&quot;Dew&quot;) the daughter of Selene and Zeus. Selene and Zeus were also said to be the parents of Nemea, the eponymous nymph of Nemea, where Heracles slew the Nemean Lion, and where the Nemean Games were held.

From Pausanias we hear that Selene was supposed to have had fifty daughters, by her lover Endymion, often assumed to represent the fifty lunar months of the Olympiad. Nonnus has Selene and Endymion as the parents of the beautiful Narcissus, although in other accounts, including Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Narcissus was the son of Cephissus and Liriope.

Quintus Smyrnaeus makes Selene, by her brother Helios, the mother of the Horae, goddesses and personifications of the four seasons; Winter, Spring, Summer, and Autumn. Quintus describes them as the four handmaidens of Hera, but in most other accounts their number is three; Eirene (&quot;peace&quot;), Eunomia (&quot;order&quot;), and Dike (&quot;justice&quot;), and their parents are Zeus and Themis instead.

Lastly, Selene was said to be the mother of the legendary Greek poet Musaeus, with, according to Philochorus, the father being the legendary seer Eumolpus.

== Mythology ==
=== Goddess of the Moon ===
Like her brother Helios, the Sun god, who drives his sun chariot across the sky each day, Selene is also said to drive a chariot across the heavens. There are no mentions of Selene&#x27;s chariot in either Homer or Hesiod, but the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Selene&quot;, gives the following description:

The earliest known depiction of Selene driving a chariot adorns the inside of an early 5th century BC red-figure cup attributed to the Brygos Painter, showing Selene plunging her chariot, drawn by two winged horses, into the sea (Berlin Antikensammlung F 2293). The geographer Pausanias, reports seeing a relief of Selene driving a single horse, as it seemed to him, or as some said, a mule, on the pedestal of the Statue of Zeus at Olympia (c. 435 BC). While the sun chariot has four horses, Selene&#x27;s usually has two, described as &quot;snow-white&quot; by Ovid. In some later accounts the chariot was drawn by oxen or bulls. Though the moon chariot is often described as being silver, for Pindar it was golden.

In antiquity, the lunar eclipse phenomena were thought to be caused by witches, particularly the ones from Thessaly, who brought the Moon/Selene down with spells and invocations of magic. References to this magical trick, variously referred to as (&quot;kathaireĩn&quot;), are scattered throughout ancient literature, whereas eclipses of both the Sun and the Moon were called &quot;kathaireseis&quot; (&quot;casting-downs&quot;) by the Greek populace. A famous example of that is Aglaonice of Thessaly, an ancient Greek astronomer, who was regarded as a sorceress for her (self-proclaimed) ability to make the Moon disappear from the sky (: &quot;kathaireĩn tén selénen&quot;). This claim has been taken–by Plutarch at first, and subsequently by modern astronomers–to mean that she could predict the time and general area where an eclipse of the Moon would occur. Those who brought down the Moon were thought to bring ill fortune upon themselves, as evidenced by the proverb &quot;&quot; (&quot;you are bringing down the Moon on yourself&quot;) said for those who caused self-inflicted evils; some witches supposedly avoided this fate by sacrificing their children or their eyeballs.

In popular and common belief, Selene as the Moon came to be associated with physical growth, menstruation and sickness, the latter particularly in the context of demonic possession or even epilepsy. Owing to her role as the moon goddess, she was sometimes called &quot;Nyctimedusa&quot; (), meaning &quot;queen of the night&quot;.

=== Endymion ===

Selene is best known for her affair with the beautiful mortal Endymion. The late 7th-century – early 6th-century BC poet Sappho apparently mentioned Selene and Endymion. However, the first account of the story comes from the third-century BC &quot;Argonautica&quot; of Apollonius of Rhodes, which tells of Selene&#x27;s &quot;mad passion&quot; and her visiting the &quot;fair Endymion&quot; in a cave on Mount Latmus:

The eternally sleeping Endymion was proverbial, but exactly how this eternal sleep came about and what role, if any, Selene may have had in it is unclear. According to the &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, Endymion was the son of Aethlius (a son of Zeus), and Zeus granted him the right to choose when he would die. A scholiast on Apollonius says that, according to Epimenides, Endymion fell in love with Hera, and Zeus punished him with eternal sleep. However, Apollodorus says that because of Endymion&#x27;s &quot;surpassing beauty, the Moon fell in love with him, and Zeus allowed him to choose what he would, and he chose to sleep for ever, remaining deathless and ageless&quot;. Theocritus portrays Endymion&#x27;s sleep as enviable because (presumably) of Selene&#x27;s love for him. Cicero seems to make Selene responsible for Endymion&#x27;s sleep, so that &quot;she might kiss him while sleeping&quot;. The Roman playwright Seneca, has Selene abandoned the night sky for Endymion&#x27;s sake having entrusted her &quot;shining&quot; moon chariot to her brother Helios to drive. The Greek satirist Lucian&#x27;s dialogue between Selene and the love goddess Aphrodite has the two goddesses commiserate about their love affairs with Endymion and Adonis, and suggests that Selene has fallen in love with Endymion while watching him sleep each night. In his dialogue between Aphrodite and Eros, Lucian also has Aphrodite admonish her son Eros for bringing Selene &quot;down from the sky&quot;. While Quintus Smyrnaeus wrote that, while Endymion slept in his cave beside his cattle:

Lucian also records an otherwise unattested myth where a pretty young girl called Muia becomes Selene&#x27;s rival for Endymion&#x27;s affections; the chatty maiden would endlessly talk to him while he slept, causing him to wake up. This irritated Endymion, and enraged Selene, who transforms the girl into a fly (). In memory of the beautiful Endymion, the fly still grudges all sleepers their rest and annoys them.

Philologist Max Müller&#x27;s interpretation of solar mythology as it related to Selene and Endymion concluded that the myth was a narrativized version of linguistic terminology. Because the Greek &quot;endyein&quot; meant &quot;to dive,&quot; the name Endymion (&quot;Diver&quot;) at first simply described the process of the setting sun &quot;diving&quot; into the sea. In this case, the story of Selene embracing Endymion, or Moon embraces Diver, refers to the sun setting and the moon rising.

=== Gigantomachy ===
Gaia, angered about her children the Titans being thrown into Tartarus following their defeat, brought forth the Giants, to attack the gods, in a war that was called the Gigantomachy. When Gaia heard of a prophecy that a mortal would help the gods to defeat the giants, she sought to find a herb that would make them undefeatable. Zeus heard of that, and ordered Selene as well as her siblings Helios (Sun) and Eos (Dawn) not to shine, and harvested all of that plant for himself. Selene&#x27;s participation in the battle is evidenced by her inclusion in the Gigantomachy frieze of the Pergamon Altar, fighting against Giants next to her siblings Helios and Eos and her mother Theia in the southern frieze. Selene gallops sidesaddle in advance, and wears a woolen undergarment and a mantle. Additionally, on a rein guide for a chariot a goddess thought to be Selene with a crescent and veil over her head is depicted, who stands with Helios on a gate tower and tries to repel the attacks of snake-legged Giants.

=== Fight with Typhon ===
According to the late account of Nonnus, when the gigantic monster Typhon laid siege against the heavens, he attacked Selene as well by hurling bulls at her, though she managed to stay in her course, and rushed at her hissing like a viper. Selene fought back the giant, locking horns with Typhon; afterwards, she carried many scars on her orb, reminiscent of their battle.

=== Ampelus ===
Ampelus was a very beautiful satyr youth, loved by the god Dionysus. One day, in Nonnus&#x27; account, Ampelus rode on a bull, and proceeded to compare himself to Selene, saying that he was her equal, having horns and riding bulls just like her. The goddess took offense, and sent a gadfly to sting Ampelus&#x27; bull. The bull panicked, threw Ampelus and gored him to death.

=== Heracles ===
When Zeus desired to sleep with the mortal queen Alcmene and sire Heracles, he made the night last three days, and ordered Selene via Hermes to dawdle in the sky during that time.

Selene also played a small role in the first of Heracles&#x27; twelve labours; whereas for Hesiod, the Nemean Lion was born to Orthrus and the Chimera (or perhaps Echidna) and raised by Hera, other accounts have Selene involved in some way in its birth or rearing. Aelian states: &quot;They say that the Lion of Nemea fell from the moon&quot;, and quotes Epimenides as saying:

Anaxagoras also reports that the Nemean lion was said to have fallen from the moon. Pseudo-Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;On Rivers&quot; has Hera collaborating with Selene, &quot;employing magical incantations&quot; to create the Nemean Lion from a chest filled with foam. Hyginus says that Selene had &quot;nourished&quot; the lion in a &quot;two-mouthed cave&quot;.

=== Pan ===
According to Virgil, Selene also had a tryst with the god Pan, who seduced her with a &quot;snowy bribe of wool&quot;. Scholia on Virgil add the story, ascribed to Nicander, that as part of the seduction, Pan wrapped himself in a sheepskin.

=== Other accounts ===
Diodorus Siculus recorded an unorthodox version of the myth, in which Basileia, who had succeeded her father Uranus to his royal throne, married her brother Hyperion, and had two children, a son Helios and a daughter Selene, &quot;admired for both their beauty and their chastity&quot;. Because Basileia&#x27;s other brothers envied these offspring, and feared that Hyperion would try to seize power for himself, they conspired against him. They put Hyperion to the sword, and drowned Helios in the river Eridanus. Selene herself, upon discovering this, took her own life. After these deaths, her brother appeared in a dream to their grieving mother and assured her that he and his sister would now transform into divine natures; and:

Plutarch recorded a fable-like story in which Selene asked her mother to weave her a garment to fit her measure, and her mother replied that she was unable to do so, as she kept changing shape and size, sometimes full, then crescent-shaped and others yet half her size.

In Lucian&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Selene complains to the titular Menippus of all the outrageous claims philosophers are making about her, such as wondering why she is ever waxing or gibbous, whether she is populated or not, and stating that she is getting her stolen light from the Sun, causing strife and ill feelings between her and her brother. She asks Menippus to report her grievances to Zeus, with the request that Zeus wipes all these natural philosophers from the face of the earth. Zeus agrees, urged by Selene&#x27;s complaints and having long intended to deal with the philosophers himself.

Claudian wrote that in her infancy, when her horns had not yet grown, Selene (along with Helios – their sister Eos is not mentioned with them) was nursed by her aunt, the water goddess Tethys.

According to pseudo-Plutarch, Lilaeus was an Indian shepherd who only worshipped Selene among the gods and performed her rituals and mysteries at night. The other gods, angered, sent him two lions to tear him apart. Selene then turned Lilaeus into a mountain, Mt. Lilaeon.

Ovid mentions how in the myth of Phaethon, Helios&#x27; son who drove his father&#x27;s chariot for a day, when Phaethon lost control of the chariot and burned the earth, Selene in the sky looked down to see in amazement her brother&#x27;s horses running wild lower than normal.

== Iconography ==
In antiquity, artistic representations of Selene/Luna included sculptural reliefs, vase paintings, coins, and gems. In red-figure pottery before the early 5th century BC, she is depicted only as a bust, or in profile against a lunar disk. In later art, like other celestial divinities such as Helios, Eos, and Nyx (Night), Selene rides across the heavens. She is usually portrayed either driving a chariot (see above) or riding sideways on horseback (sometimes riding an ox, a mule or a ram).

Selene was often paired with her brother Helios. Selene (probably) and Helios adorned the east pediment of the Parthenon, where the two, each driving a four-horsed chariot, framed a scene depicting the birth of Athena, with Helios and his chariot rising from the ocean on the left, and Selene and her chariot descending into the sea on the right. Selene and Helios also appear on the North Metopes of the Parthenon, with Selene this time entering the sea on horseback. From Pausanias, we learn that Selene and Helios also framed the birth of Aphrodite on the base of the Statue of Zeus at Olympia. There are indications of a similar framing by Selene and Helios of the birth of Pandora on the base of the Athena Parthenos. Pausanias also reports seeing stone images of Helios, and Selene, in the market-place at Elea, with rays projecting from the head of Helios, and horns from the head of Selene. Selene also appears on horseback as part of the Gigantomachy frieze of the Pergamon Altar.

Selene is commonly depicted with a crescent moon, often accompanied by stars; sometimes, instead of a crescent, a lunar disc is used. Often a crescent moon rests on her brow, or the cusps of a crescent moon protrude, horn-like, from her head, or from behind her head or shoulders. Selene&#x27;s head is sometimes surrounded by a nimbus, and from the Hellenistic period onwards, she is sometimes pictured with a torch.

In later second and third century AD Roman funerary art, the love of Selene for Endymion and his eternal sleep was a popular subject for artists. As frequently depicted on Roman sarcophagi, Selene, holding a billowing veil forming a crescent over her head, descends from her chariot to join her lover, who slumbers at her feet.

==Cult==
Selene&#x27;s presence in ancient Greek worship is very limited, even in comparison to her brother. Her presence in cult was linked to her connection to more major, important divinities such as Artemis and Hecate, and she is hardly divorced from her identifications when it comes to worship; in later times, she was adopted into pre-existing cults that had not originally included her, along with several other figures.

Moon figures are found on Cretan rings and gems (perhaps indicating a Minoan moon cult), but apart from the role played by the moon itself in magic, folklore, and poetry, and despite the later worship of the Phrygian moon-god Men, there was relatively little worship of Selene. An oracular sanctuary existed near Thalamai in Laconia. Described by Pausanias, it contained statues of Pasiphaë and Helios. Here &quot;Pasiphaë&quot; is used as an epithet of Selene, instead of referring to the daughter of Helios and wife of Minos. Pausanias also described seeing two stone images in the market-place of Elis, one of the sun and the other of the moon, from the heads of which projected the rays of the sun and the horns of the crescent moon. Selene (along with Helios, Nyx and others) received an altar at the sanctuary of Demeter at Pergamon, possibly in connection with the Orphic mysteries.

Originally, Pandia may have been an epithet of Selene, but by at least the time of the late &quot;Hymn to Selene&quot;, Pandia had become a daughter of Zeus and Selene. Pandia (or Pandia Selene) may have personified the full moon, and an Athenian festival, called the Pandia, usually considered to be a festival for Zeus, was perhaps celebrated on the full moon and may have been associated with Selene. At Athens, wineless offerings (&quot;nephalia&quot;) were made to Selene, along with other celestial gods, Selene&#x27;s siblings Helios and Eos, and Aphrodite Ourania; in Attica, it seems that Selene was identified with Aphrodite.

Selene was sometimes associated with childbirth, for it was believed that during the full moon women had the easiest labours; this helped in her identification with the goddess Artemis, as well as other goddesses connected to women&#x27;s labours. The idea that Selene would also give easy labours to women paved way for identification with Hera and the Roman Juno and Lucina, three other childbirth goddesses; Plutarch calls Selene &quot;Hera in material form.&quot; Roman philosopher Cicero connected Selene&#x27;s Roman counterpart Luna&#x27;s name to childbirth goddess Lucina&#x27;s, both deriving from &quot;light&quot; (thus bringing the unborn child into the light). Nonnus also identified Selene with Eileithyia.

Selene played an important role in love magic. In Theocritus&#x27; second &quot;Idyll&quot;, a young girl invokes Selene in a love-spell. The idyll opens with the girl ordering her maid to bring potions and magical utensils, followed by an invocation to Selene and Hecate, and finally the rather lengthy spell itself; once she finishes her spell, the girl recounts to Selene of how she met and was betrayed by her lover, and calls upon the goddess to witness and help her, hence the love tail is woven into the love spell. And, according to a scholium on Theocritus, Pindar wrote that lovesick women would pray to Selene for help, as Euripides apparently had Phaedra, Selene&#x27;s great-niece, do in his lost play &quot;Hippolytus Veiled&quot;. Plutarch wrote that Selene was called upon in love affairs because she, the Moon, constantly yearns for the Sun, and compared her in that regard to Isis.

Her and her brother&#x27;s worship is also attested in Gytheum, a town in Laconia near Sparta, via an inscription (&quot;C.I.G. 1392&quot;). In the city of Epidaurus, in Argolis, Selene had an altar dedicated to her. Records show that a type of cake called (&quot;boûs&quot;, &quot;ox&quot;) decorated with horns to represent the full moon or an ox was offered to her and other divinities like Hecate, Artemis and Apollo. In addition, a type of flat, round moon-shaped cake was called &#x27;selene&#x27; (&quot;moon&quot;) and was offered &quot;to the goddess.&quot; The ancient Greeks also called Monday &quot;day of the Moon&quot; (&quot;ἡμέρα Σελήνης&quot;) after her.

== Orphic literature ==
According to a certain Epigenes, the three Moirai, or Fates, were regarded in the Orphic tradition as representing the three divisions of Selene, &quot;the thirtieth and the fifteenth and the first&quot; (i.e. the crescent moon, full moon, and dark moon, as delinted by the divisions of the calendar month).

== Namesakes ==
Selene is the Greek proper name for the Moon, and 580 Selene, a minor planet in the asteroid belt, is also named after this goddess. Scientific study of the Moon, particularly lunar geology, is sometimes referred to as selenology, and its practitioners selenologists, to distinguish from Earth-based study.

The chemical element Selenium was named after Selene by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, because of the element&#x27;s similarity to the element tellurium, named for the Earth (Tellus).

The second Japanese lunar orbiter spacecraft following was named SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) after Selene, and was also known as Kaguya in Japan. HMS Selene (P254), a 1944 British submarine and Ghia Selene, a concept car from the Ghia design studio from 1959, also bore her name.

<text>In Greek mythology, Epaphus (; ), also called [[Epaphus|Apis]] or Munantius, was a son of the Greek God Zeus and king of Egypt.

== Family ==
Epaphus was the son of Zeus and Io and thus, Ceroessa&#x27;s brother. With his wife, Memphis (or according to others, Cassiopeia), he had one daughter, Libya while some accounts added another one who bore the name Lysianassa. These daughters later became mothers of Poseidon&#x27;s sons, Belus, Agenor and possibly, Lelex with the former while Busiris was born to the latter. Through these daughters, Epaphus was the ancestor of the &quot;dark Libyans, and high-souled Aethiopians, and the Underground-folk and feeble Pygmies&quot;.

In one account, Epaphus had a son, Dorus, who fathered Pygmaeus, ancestor of the Pygmies. Otherwise, this tribe of diminutive men was instead born from Epaphus and Gaea (Earth).

== Mythology ==

=== Birth ===
The name/word Epaphus means &quot;Touch&quot;. This refers to the manner in which he was conceived, by the touch of Zeus&#x27; hand. He was born in Euboea, in the cave Boösaule according to Strabo or according to others, in Egypt, on the river Nile, after the long wanderings of his mother. He was then concealed by the Curetes, by the request of Hera, but Io sought and afterward found him in Syria where he was nursed by the wife of the king of Byblus.

=== Phaethon ===
Epaphus was also a contemporary and the rival of Phaethon, son of Helios and Clymene. He criticized his heraldry saying, &quot;Poor, demented fellow, what will you not credit if your mother speaks, you are so puffed up with the fond conceit of your imagined sire, the Lord of Day.&quot; This prompted Phaethon to undertake his fateful journey in his father&#x27;s chariot of the sun.

=== Reign and death ===
Epaphus is regarded in the myths as the founder of Memphis, Egypt. Hera being envious that her husband&#x27;s bastard ruled such a great kingdom, saw to it that Epaphus should be killed while hunting.

David Rohl identifies Epaphus with the Hyksos pharaoh Apophis.

<text>Enipeus, in ancient Greece, was a river god. Enipeus was loved by a mortal woman named Tyro, who was married to a mortal man named Cretheus. Poseidon, filled with lust for Tyro, disguised himself as Enipeus and from their union was born Pelias and Neleus, twin boys. The River Enipeus (now Enipeas) is located in Thessaly, and was the site of the Battle of Cynoscephalae and the Battle of Pharsalus.

<doc id="80967" wikidata="Q483794" url="?curid=80967" title="Copa del Rey">
<text>The &#x27;, commonly known as &#x27;,  or (in English) the Spanish Cup or King&#x27;s Cup, and formerly known as Copa del Presidente de la República (1932–1936) and Copa del Generalísimo (1939–1976), is an annual knockout football competition in Spanish football, organized by the Royal Spanish Football Federation.

The competition was founded in 1903, making it the oldest Spanish football competition played at a national level. Copa del Rey winners qualify for the following season&#x27;s UEFA Europa League. If they have already qualified for Europe through their league position, the Europa League spot is given to the highest-placed team in the league who has not yet qualified (until 2014 this place was awarded to the Copa runners-up, unless they too had already qualified via the league).

Barcelona is the most successful club in the competition, having won 31 titles. Athletic Bilbao has the second-most wins with 24, while Real Madrid is third with 20. Athletic Bilbao is also the most recent winner, having defeated Mallorca in the 2024 final held at the Estadio de La Cartuja.

==History==

In 1902, a competition under the name Copa de la Coronación was played after Juan de Astorquia, President of Bilbao Football Club, and Carlos Padrós, later president of Real Madrid, suggested a football tournament to celebrate the coronation of Spanish King Alfonso XIII. Four other teams joined Madrid FC for the competition: FC Barcelona, Club Español de Foot-Ball, New Foot-Ball de Madrid and Club Bizcaya (a team made up of players from Athletic Club and Bilbao FC), which eventually defeated Barcelona in the final. That cup is on display in the Athletic Bilbao museum and the club includes the victory as the first of its Copa del Rey wins, but the Royal Spanish Football Federation officially does not recognise it as such, only considering it to be the forerunner of the Copa del Rey.

The Copa del Rey was effectively Spain&#x27;s national football championship from 1903 (the first edition won by Athletic Bilbao with Juan de Astorquia as captain and president) until the foundation of the &quot;Campeonato de Liga&quot;—League Championship (La Liga)—in 1928. It was initially known as the &quot;Copa del Ayuntamiento de Madrid&quot; (Madrid City Council&#x27;s Cup). Between 1905 and 1932, it was known as the &quot;Copa de Su Majestad El Rey Alfonso XIII&quot; (His Majesty King Alfonso XIII&#x27;s Cup). During the Second Spanish Republic, it was known as the &quot;Copa del Presidente de la República&quot; (President of the Republic Cup) or &quot;Copa de España&quot; (Spanish Cup) and during the years of Francisco Franco&#x27;s Spanish State, it was known as the &quot;Copa de Su Excelencia El Generalísimo&quot; or &quot;Copa del Generalísimo&quot; (His Excellency, The Supreme General&#x27;s Cup).

Athletic Bilbao were declared winners in 1904 after their opponents Español de Madrid failed to show up. Between 1903 and 1909 the competition was organized by Madrid FC or by the Madrid Federation. Afterwards, it was taken over by the FECF (&quot;Federación Española de Clubs de Football&quot;), a forerunner of the RFEF. However, in both 1910 and 1913 there was a split among the clubs and two parallel competitions were held, one organized by the FECF and the other by the UECF (&quot;Unión Española de Club de Football&quot;). All these editions are officially recognized by the RFEF. In 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, clubs in the Republican area of Spain entered the Copa de la España Libre, with Levante FC (forerunner of the present Levante UD) beating their city rivals Valencia 1–0 in the final. Although in 2007 the Congress of Deputies urged the Royal Spanish Football Federation to recognise it as a Copa del Rey win for Levante, for several years the governing body of Spanish football made no decision on the matter. On 25 March 2023, the tournament was officially recognized by the RFEF, but not as a Copa del Rey.

Because of the dispute regarding the 1902 competition, the statistics regarding the leading winners are also disputed. Barcelona have won the Copa 31 times; Athletic Bilbao are in second place, with either 24 or 25 titles, depending on the source.

Before the formation of La Liga in 1929, the competition was in essence a national championship. Teams qualified to enter via their regional leagues. Over the years, various formats, including group stages have been used. Reserve teams of the professional clubs, who compete in lower divisions of the league pyramid, were permitted to take part until 1990. For a number of years, only teams from the &quot;Primera División&quot;, &quot;Segunda A&quot;, about 23 teams from the &quot;Segunda B&quot; and the 17 &quot;Tercera División&quot; champions (or runners-up if the champion was a reserve team) were invited to enter, giving a total of 83. Amended rules for the 2019–20 edition led to the number of entrants increasing to 125, including winners of the regional divisions at the fifth level.

Since the format overhaul, all rounds are single-leg ties with lower division teams hosting the match and the majority of the top-level clubs entering at the first Round (four teams taking part in the Supercopa de España entering in the third round – last 32), other than the semi-final stage which is played over two legs. This is another change introduced in 2019–20, with prior editions involving two legs from the point at which the top-tier clubs entered in the fourth round (last 32). Athletic Bilbao particularly embraced the new format, winning a total of 22 single-leg ties to reach the two-legged semi-finals in each of its first five seasons before losing to Osasuna in the 2024–25 Round of 16. The final is a one-off game played at a neutral venue, with Seville becoming the regular home.

The winners qualify for both the following season&#x27;s Supercopa de España and UEFA Europa League; in the past, the runners-up often played in the Supercopa if the winners had also finished as league champions (although on some earlier occasions in these circumstances, no Supercopa match was played and the double winners were awarded the title by default). From the 2019–20 Supercopa de España edition onwards, the previous Copa del Rey runners-up automatically qualify in addition to the winners with four teams taking part in the event.

Throughout the history of the competition, there have been 12 actual trophies, which were permanently awarded to clubs for winning the competition either three times in a row or on five separate occasions, and for other special reasons. Thus, five trophies have been permanently awarded to Barcelona, three to Athletic Bilbao and one to Real Madrid (the last &quot;Copa de la República&quot; in 1936). Athletic kept the first trophy as inaugural winners, Sevilla were awarded the &quot;Trofeo del Generalísimo&quot; after its first edition in 1939 and Atlético Madrid, winners the previous year, were awarded the 11th trophy following the death of Francisco Franco in 1976.

On 22 December 2010, at an extraordinary general meeting of the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Sevilla requested permission from the Federation to keep the trophy they had won in the 2010 final to commemorate the victory of the Spain national team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. A new trophy was made by Madrid jeweler Federico Alegre. The trophy, made of silver, weighs and is tall. On 21 April 2011, Real Madrid became the first recipients. During the post-game celebrations, the trophy was accidentally dropped by Real Madrid player Sergio Ramos from the top of a double-decker bus, which then ran over it. Ten pieces were found by civil servicemen when they recovered it from the ground at Plaza de Cibeles. The club received a copy which is displayed at Santiago Bernabéu.

The new presidency of Luis Rubiales initiated profound restructuring within the Federation. These changes impacted competitions organized by the organization, specifically the Copa del Rey and the Supercopa de España. Both were reformed with new formats designed to increase competitiveness and attractiveness. In the case of the Supercopa, the changes had a reciprocal effect; the Copa champion and runner-up were included alongside the league championship&#x27;s top two finishers, creating a four-team competition. Beginning with the 2019–20 edition, the cup championship introduced a significant change: the designation of a fixed venue for the final; the Estadio de La Cartuja in Seville was chosen to host the final for a four-year period.

‡ Real Madrid&#x27;s reserve team. Reserve teams have been banned from this competition from 1990–91 onward.
‡‡ The number of wins Athletic Bilbao have been credited with is disputed. The 1902 version was won by Bizcaya, a team made up of players from Athletic Bilbao and Bilbao FC. In 1903 these two clubs merged as the current Athletic Bilbao. The 1902 cup is on display in the Athletic museum and the club includes it in its own honors list. However, that edition is not recognized as official by the RFEF.

==Broadcasters==
From the 2019–20 season, the final match is already included in La Copa broadcasting rights package. Previously, the final match is excluded in selected countries (other broadcasters (including Spain) will receive the Supercopa rights after covering a Copa final match) due to laws and regulations of the tournament broadcasting rights by CNMC in Spain.

==Notes==
A.  En route to the final, Español de Madrid had tied one game and had not completed the other game, which led Athletic Bilbao to file a complaint. Faced with this problem and unable to quickly resolve the case, the Madrid Association decided to award the cup to Athletic as defending champions.

B.  Playing as &quot;Club Ciclista de San Sebastián&quot;.

C.  Playing as &quot;Vasconia de San Sebastián&quot;.

D.  A mini-group of three teams was played, with Athletic Bilbao defeating Madrid FC 2–0 a day before their win over Vasconia, thus the match between the Basque teams was decisive in deciding the winner, although not a typical final (Vasconia then played Madrid the following day to complete the group, also winning 2–0).

E.  The first final, played the day earlier, ended 2–2 after extra time.

F.  Originally played as a two-legged final. The first match, played seven days earlier, ended 2–2, and the second match, played six days earlier, ended 0–0.

G.  The first final, played two days earlier, ended 0–0 after extra time.

H.  The first and second final ended 1–1 after extra time. Both matches were played a month before the second replay.

I.  Real Madrid won the penalty shoot-out 4–3.

J.  Betis won the penalty shoot-out 8–7.

K.  Real Sociedad won the penalty shoot-out 4–2.

L.  Zaragoza won the penalty shoot-out 5–4.

M.  The match was suspended by heavy rain and hail in the 79th minute, and was resumed three days later.

<text>In Greek mythology, Tyro () was an Elean princess who later became Queen of Iolcus.

Tyro was the daughter of King Salmoneus of Elis and Alcidice. She married her uncle, King Cretheus of Iolcus, and had three sons with him, and also bore twin sons with Poseidon. Aeson, one of Tyro&#x27;s son with Cretheus, was the father of Jason, a central figure in the Argonauts&#x27; quest for the Golden Fleece. Tyro later married her paternal uncle, Sisyphus, and had two more children. Fearing a prophecy that her children would kill her father, Tyro killed them.

In popular culture, Ezra Pound references Tyro in his work, The Cantos.

== Family ==
Tyro was the daughter of King Salmoneus of Elis and Alcidice, daughter of King Aleus of Arcadia. She married her uncle King Cretheus of Iolcus but loved the river-god Enipeus. Tyro gave birth to Pelias and Neleus, the twin sons of Poseidon. With Cretheus, she had three sons, Aeson, Pheres and Amythaon. In some accounts, Tyro had a daughter named Phalanna who gave her name to city of Phalanna in Thessaly.



== Mythology ==
Tyro&#x27;s father Salmoneus was the brother of Athamas and Sisyphus. She was married to her uncle Cretheus, King of Iolcus but Tyro loved the river god Enipeus who refused her advances. One day, Poseidon filled with lust for Tyro, disguised himself as Enipeus and from their union were born Pelias and Neleus, twin boys. Tyro exposed her sons on a mountain to die, but they were found by a herdsman who raised them as his own. When the twins reached adulthood, they found Tyro and killed her stepmother, Sidero, for having mistreated their mother (Salmoneus married Sidero when Alcidice died). Sidero hid at the temple of Hera but Pelias killed her anyway, causing Hera&#x27;s undying hatred of Pelias – and her glorious patronage of Jason and the Argonauts in their long quest for the Golden Fleece. Pelias&#x27; half brother Aeson, the son of Tyro and Cretheus, was the father of Jason. Soon after, Tyro married Sisyphus, her paternal uncle and had two children. It was said that their children would kill Salmoneus, so Tyro killed them in order to save her father.

== In popular culture==
Ezra Pound refers to Tyro in &quot;The Cantos&quot;. In Canto 2 he takes up her rape by Poseidon:&quot;And by the beach-run, Tyro,&lt;br&gt;Twisted arms of the sea-god,&lt;br&gt;Lithe sinews of water, gripping her, cross-hold,&lt;br&gt;And the blue-gray glass of the wave tents them,&lt;br&gt;Glare azure of water, cold-welter, close cover.&quot;In a later Canto (74) Pound connects her to Alcmene, imprisoned in the world of the dead, but in a later paradisal vision he sees her &quot;ascending&quot;:thick smoke, purple, rising&lt;br&gt;bright flame now on the altar&lt;br&gt;the crystal funnel of air&lt;br&gt;out of Erebus, the delivered,&lt;br&gt;Tyro, Alcmene, free now, ascending&lt;br&gt;[...] no shades more (Canto 90)

<text>In Greek mythology, Salmoneus (; Ancient Greek: Σαλμωνεύς) was &#x27;the wicked&#x27; eponymous king and founder of Salmone in Pisatis.

==Family==
Salmoneus was formerly a Thessalian prince as son of King Aeolus of Aeolia. His mother was identified as (1) Enarete, daughter of Deimachus, or (2) Iphis, daughter of Peneus, or (3) Laodice, daughter of Aloeus. Salmoneus was the brother of Athamas, Sisyphus, Cretheus, Perieres, Deioneus, Magnes, Calyce, Canace, Alcyone, Pisidice and Perimede.

Salmoneus&#x27;s first wife was Alcidice by whom he became the father of Tyro, while his second wife was Sidero.

==Mythology==
Emigrating from Aeolis with a number of Aeolians, Salmoneus founded a city in Eleia (Elis) on the banks of the river Alpheius and called it Salmonia after his own name. He then married Alcidice, the daughter of Aleus but when she died, the king took for a second wife Sidero who treated his beautiful daughter Tyro unkindly.

Salmoneus and his brother Sisyphus hated each other. Sisyphus found out from an oracle that if he married Tyro, she would bear him children who would kill Salmoneus. At first, Tyro submitted to Sisyphus, married him, and bore him a son. When Tyro found out what the child would do to Salmoneus, she killed the boy. It was soon after this that Tyro lay with Poseidon and bore him Pelias and Neleus.

Salmoneus, being an overbearing man and impious, came to be hated by his subjects for he ordered them to worship him under the name of Zeus. He built a bridge of brass, over which he drove at full speed in his chariot to imitate thunder, the effect being heightened by dried skins and cauldrons trailing behind while torches were thrown into the air to represent lightning. For this sin of hubris, Zeus eventually struck him down with his thunderbolt and destroyed the town.And he [i.e. Salmoneus] acted profanely, by casting torches (in the air) as if they were lightnings,And dragging dried hides with kettles at his chariot,Pretending to make thunder, so he was thunderstruck by Zeus.Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; has Salmoneus placed in Tartarus after Zeus smites him where he is subjected to eternal torment.

==Inspiration==
According to Frazer, the early Greek kings, who were expected to produce rain for the benefit of the crops, were in the habit of imitating thunder and lightning in the character of Zeus. At Crannon in Thessaly, there was a bronze chariot which in time of drought was shaken and prayers offered for rain. S. Reinach suggests that the story that Salmoneus was struck by lightning was due to the misinterpretation of a picture, in which a Thessalian magician appeared bringing down lightning and rain from heaven. Hence arose the idea that he was the victim of the anger or jealousy of Zeus and that the picture represented his punishment.

<text>In Greek mythology, Cretheus (; Ancient Greek: Κρηθεύς &quot;Krētheus&quot;) may refer to the following characters:

* Cretheus, king and founder of Iolcus, the son of King Aeolus of Aeolia (son of Hellen) by either Enarete or Laodice. He was the brother of Sisyphus, Athamas, Salmoneus, Deion, Magnes, Perieres, Canace, Alcyone, Peisidice, Calyce and Perimede. Cretheus&#x27;s wives were Tyro, his niece, and Demodice or Biadice. With Tyro, he fathered Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon. When Cretheus found out that Tyro had an affair with Poseidon, he left her and married Demodice. He also had several daughters, namely Hippolyte, future wife of Acastus (otherwise known as Astydamia), Myrina who married Thoas, and possibly Phalanna, eponym of Phalanna.
* Cretheus, also known as Cres, the Cretan father of an unnamed daughter who became the mother of Asterius by Teutamus.

<text>The Neches River () begins in Van Zandt County west of Rhine Lake and flows for through the piney woods of east Texas, defining the boundaries of 14 counties on its way to its mouth on Sabine Lake near the Rainbow Bridge. Two major reservoirs, Lake Palestine and B. A. Steinhagen Reservoir are located on the Neches. The Angelina River (containing Sam Rayburn Reservoir) is a major tributary with its confluence at the north of Lake B. A. Steinhagen. Tributaries to the south include Village Creek and Pine Island Bayou, draining much of the Big Thicket region, both joining the Neches a few miles north of Beaumont. Towns and cities located along the river including Tyler, Lufkin, and Silsbee, although significant portions of the Neches River are undeveloped and flow through protected natural lands. In contrast, the lower 40 miles of the river are a major shipping channel, highly industrialized, with a number of cities and towns concentrated in the area including Beaumont, Vidor, Port Neches, Nederland, Groves, and Port Arthur.

==Etymology==
It is believed that the name of the river was derived from the Caddo word &quot;Nachawi&quot;, meaning &quot;wood of the bow&quot;, after Spanish settlers called it &quot;Río Neches&quot;.

==Untamed river==

With the exception of dams and manmade lakes, much of the river is in a natural state. Approximately 11 miles of the upper Neches flows through the Neches River National Wildlife Refuge, established to protect the biologically diverse bottomland hardwood forest and habitat for migratory birds, and opened to the public as recently as 2019. Downstream, the river delineates the eastern border of Davy Crockett National Forest including more than nine miles of the Big Slough Wilderness Area of the National Forest. Further downstream the Neches defines much of the southern border of Angelina National Forest including roughly four miles of the Upland Island and Longleaf Pine Wilderness Area of Angelina National Forest. The Angelina Neches/Dam B Wildlife Management Area is situated at the confluence of the Neches and Angelina Rivers protecting 12,636 acres of the river&#x27;s floodplain and bottomland, administered by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department along with the adjacent Martin Dies Jr. State Park on the eastern side of Lake B. A. Steinhagen. South of the Lake, beginning at Town Bluff Dam and running 56 miles south to Beaumont, is the Neches River Corridor Unit of the Big Thicket National Preserve, administered by the National Park Service. The Big Thicket National Preserve is recognized as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO, preserving an area where several ecosystems converge. The Big Thicket Visitor Center is off U.S. Highway 69 several miles north of Kountze, Texas.

Beginning in 2006, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service purchased land along the Neches River for the creation of the Neches River National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge includes land on which the city of Dallas had proposed to build a reservoir to meet the water needs of the city and its surrounding suburbs. Tentatively named Lake Fastrill, this reservoir was not scheduled to be built until 2050. The city of Dallas and the Texas Water Development Board filed a lawsuit in 2007 against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, claiming the wildlife refuge was established without considering the economic and environmental impacts. However, in February 2010 the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, paving the way for the acquisition of lands for the wildlife refuge.

The Lower Neches Valley Authority is the river authority which oversees the Neches River in Tyler, Hardin, Liberty, Chambers, and Jefferson counties of Texas.

==Industrialized river==
The lower forty miles of the river is industrialized, from the Beaumont Interstate 10 bridge to Sabine Lake. The river is maintained as a deep water ship channel running between the Port of Beaumont to Sabine Lake. Currently 40 feet deep and 400 ft wide, the river is being deepened to 48 feet. The total estimated cost of the Sabine-Neches Waterway project is $1.1 billion.

Several petro-chemical plants are located in the river&#x27;s southern section. The Sabine-Neches Navigation District, formed in 1909, has management responsibilities of the portion of the river which is part of the Sabine-Neches Waterway.

<text>Matra (an acronym for Mécanique Aviation Traction) was a major French industrial conglomerate. Its business activities covered a wide range of industries, notably aerospace, defence, automotive, motorsports, transport and telecommunications.

Following the acquisition of vehicle manufacturer Automobiles René Bonnet, the company founded Matra Automobiles during the 1960s, which produced a limited range of racing and sports cars. Its car division worked closely with other vehicle manufacturers, most significantly Renault, prior to the decline and sale of Matra Automobiles during the early 2000s. In addition to road cars, Matra entered into a wide range of businesses, eventually diversifying into media, weaponry, aeronautics, automobiles, and music distribution.

Matra was at one point owned by the Floirat family. Throughout much of the company&#x27;s existence, French businessman Jean-Luc Lagardère was the CEO of Matra. In 1988, Matra was privatised; Lagardère&#x27;s stake in the company grew considerably over the following years. 

In 1994, Matra became a subsidiary of the Lagardère Group and in February 1999, Matra Hautes Technologies (&quot;MHT&quot;), which represented the conglomerate&#x27;s aerospace, defence and telecommunications arm, was merged with the French aerospace corporation Aérospatiale to form Aérospatiale-Matra (now Airbus). Several former assets of Matra continue to operate under the Lagardère name.

Privatization, bleeding through the Lagardère Group, sell-off of its profitable enterprises, and failure of its automotive division caught up and Matra went bankrupt in 2003.

==Overview==
During 1945, Matra (Mécanique Aviation Traction) was established, immediately beginning development of an ambitious twin-engine aircraft intended to be the fastest propeller-driven plane in the world. In 1951, the sound barrier was broken in horizontal flight for the first time in Europe by an aircraft using a Matra-built engine. During 1961, Matra became involved in the early European space programme, having been appointed as the first prime contractor for satellites.

During 1963, French businessman Jean-Luc Lagardère was appointed CEO of Matra; he would be a key figure at the company for the following three decades. At the time of Lagardère&#x27;s appointment, the firm had a workforce of 1,450. During 1964, Matra became the owner of car manufacturer Automobiles René Bonnet. For a time, Matra was largely centred around its vehicle division, &quot;Matra Automobiles&quot;. However, within a decade, Matra had sold its road car division to American-owned car manufacturer Chrysler Europe, having shifted focus onto its other growing business activities.

During the 1970s, Lagardère pursued an overall strategy of merging Matra with various other companies, or acquiring them outright, to build up a conglomerate under the Matra brand. Throughout the 1970s, the company strengthened and grew its position within the aerospace sector, which had been viewed as a core business of Matra. One such company was the electrical equipment manufacturer Électronique Moderne de l’Oise, which became Matra Électronique following its acquisition during 1975. That same year, the National Centre for Space Studies (CNES) and the European Space Agency (ESA) awarded a contract to Matra for the loading bay of the new Ariane expendable launch system.

Over several decades, Matra diversified into media, weaponry, aeronautics, automobiles, music distribution, and various other state of the art technologies. During 1981, Matra ventured into media activities via the purchase of the Hachette publishing company. Matra invested in several fields of transportation during the 1980s and 1990s. It produced a fiberglass 14 ft sailing dinghy with an innovative double-bottom, self-bailing hull, called &quot;Capricorne&quot;. Though several hundred were sold and a class association briefly existed, it was unable to gain much market share against the better established International 420. During 1983, Matra launched an automatic (driverless) light rubber-tyred metro, the Véhicule Automatique Léger. It later attempted to produce a personal rapid transit system, which it named &quot;Aramis&quot;. Matra also manufactured a range of electric bicycles and electric scooters. Matra i-step Runner, Tourer and Force as well as Matra i-flow in Romorantin. Matra developed and released a personal computer, the Alice.

During 1988, Matra was privatised, at which point Lagardère acquired six per cent of the company&#x27;s stock; by 1992, his stake in Matra had risen to 25 per cent. That same year, the Lagardère Group was radically restructured; acquiring more shares in Matra from Floirat, Daimler Benz and GEC, and Hachette from Floirat, Crédit Lyonnais and Aberly. Lagardère merged Matra and Hachette to form Matra Hachette, of which the Lagardère Group held 37.6 per cent. Following a share swap in 1994, Lagardère held 93.3 per cent of Matra Hachette&#x27;s stock. During 1996, Matra Hachette was formally merged into the Lagardère Group.

In February 1999, the firm&#x27;s defence wing, Matra Hautes Technologies, was merged with French aerospace conglomerate Aérospatiale to form Aérospatiale-Matra. During 2003, following poor financial performances within the sector, Matra Automobiles became bankrupt and its assets were sold off once more. Instead, Matra decided to concentrate its resources on its remaining interests within the media and aerospace sectors.

==Matra Automobiles==


Matra had been involved in car manufacturing since the acquisition of Automobiles René Bonnet in 1963. The first road car to be sold under the Matra marque was the Renault-powered Matra Djet (pronounced &quot;jet&quot;), which was an update of the Bonnet Jet; the Djet was subsequently replaced with the Matra 530, Bagheera, the Murena and the Rancho, an early type of sport utility vehicle (SUV). At its peak, Matra Automobiles was manufacturing 60,000 vehicles per year at its plant in Romorantin-Lanthenay.

Lagardere, recognising the promotion value of the motorsport sector for garnering sales, decided that the company ought to be involved, leading to the creation of Equipe Matra Sports, which entered the French Formula 3 during 1965. Throughout the mid-1960s, Matra enjoyed considerable success in Formula 3 and Formula 2 racing with its MS5 monocoque-based car, winning both the French and European championships. Matra competed as a constructor in Formula One from to and as an engine supplier between and , winning the drivers&#x27; and constructors&#x27; championships in . Matra also competed in sports car racing from 1966 to 1974 winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans outright in 1972, 1973 and 1974 and the World Championship for Makes in 1973 and 1974. However, at the end of the 1974 season, Matra announced that it had decided to withdraw from all motorsport involvement.

During the early 1970s, Matra sold its car division to American-owned car manufacturer Chrysler Europe. Matra Automobiles was subsequently sold by Chrysler Europe to French car company Peugeot; during 1983, Lagardere arranged to buy the division back. Shortly thereafter, a strategic partnership was formed between Matra and French vehicle company Renault, leading to the development of the Espace minivan.

During 1984, the Matra-built Espace was launched onto the market; this car proved to be a commercial success over multiple decades. Due to this success, this single vehicle type became extremely impactful to the fortunes of Matra Automobiles. Following on from the first generation of the Espace, Matra Automobiles went on to manufacture the next two generations as well; however, the fourth iteration was manufactured inhouse by Renault instead. The loss of the Espace business quickly proved detrimental to the firm&#x27;s finances.

During 2001, production of the Renault Avantime, which was co-designed and built by Matra Automobiles, commenced; this vehicle did not sell well and was widely regarded as a failure. By the early 2000s, Matra was reportedly keen to end its involvement with the automotive industry. Following the discontinuation of the Avantime, on 27 February 2003, Matra Automobiles announced its intention to close its Romorantin vehicle factory just one month later. The dismantling of the division was necessitated by Matra Automobiles having been declared bankrupt.

During September 2003, Pininfarina SpA acquired Matra Automobile&#x27;s engineering, testing and prototype businesses; the company was subsequently named Matra Automobile Engineering. On 13 January 2009, Pininfarina sold its share in Matra Automobile Engineering to Segula Technologies.

==Matra Hautes Technologies==
&quot;Matra Hautes Technologies&quot; (&quot;MHT&quot;) was the defence arm of the firm. The division was involved in aerospace, defence and telecommunications.

During 1990, Matra Espace and the aerospace division of British electronics specialist GEC Marconi merged, creating &quot;Matra Marconi Space&quot;; the company had claimed this entity to have been the leading aerospace company in the European market at the time. Six years later, Matra Défense and British missile manufacturer BAe Dynamics merged to form Matra BAe Dynamics, a leading weapons manufacturer in Europe as well as the third largest in the world at the time. During February 1999, MHT merged with French aerospace conglomerate Aérospatiale to form Aérospatiale-Matra. On 10 July 2000, Aérospatiale-Matra merged with Spanish aircraft company CASA and German aerospace firm DASA to become part of EADS, which subsequently became the Airbus Group.

<text>The Secret of Monkey Island is a 1990 point-and-click graphic adventure game developed and published by Lucasfilm Games. It takes place in a fictional version of the Caribbean during the age of piracy. The player assumes the role of Guybrush Threepwood, a young man who dreams of becoming a pirate, and explores fictional islands while solving puzzles.

The game was conceived in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert, who designed it with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. Gilbert&#x27;s frustrations with contemporary adventure titles led him to make the player character&#x27;s death almost impossible, which meant that gameplay focused on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride. &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface.

Critics praised &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; for its humor, audiovisuals, and gameplay. Several publications list it among the greatest video games of all time. The game spawned a number of sequels, collectively known as the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series. Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman also led the development of the sequel &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. LucasArts released a remake of the original in 2009, which was also well received by the gaming press.

==Gameplay==
&quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; is a 2D adventure game played from a third-person perspective. Via a point-and-click interface, the player guides protagonist Guybrush Threepwood through the game&#x27;s world and interacts with the environment by selecting from twelve verb commands (nine in newer versions) such as &quot;talk to&quot; for communicating with characters and &quot;pick up&quot; for collecting items between commands and the world&#x27;s objects in order to successfully solve puzzles and thus progress in the game. While conversing with other characters, the player may choose between topics for discussion that are listed in a dialog tree; the game is one of the first to incorporate such a system. The in-game action is frequently interrupted by cutscenes. Like other LucasArts adventure games, &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; features a design philosophy that makes the player character&#x27;s death nearly impossible (Guybrush does drown if he stays underwater for more than ten minutes).

==Plot==

A youth named Guybrush Threepwood arrives on Mêlée Island, hoping to become a pirate. He seeks out the island&#x27;s pirate leaders, who set him three trials: winning a sword duel against Carla, the island&#x27;s resident swordmaster; finding a buried treasure; and stealing a valuable idol from the governor&#x27;s mansion. These quests take Guybrush throughout the island, where he hears of stories of the ghost pirate LeChuck, who apparently died in an expedition to the mysterious Monkey Island, an act that was meant to win the love of the governor, Elaine Marley. Guybrush meets several characters of interest, including a local voodoo priestess, Stan the Used Boat Salesman, Carla the Sword Master, a prisoner named Otis, and Meathook, whose hands have been replaced by hooks.

Guybrush encounters Elaine and is smitten, and she soon reciprocates. However, as he completes the tasks set for him, the island is raided by LeChuck and his undead crew, who abduct Elaine and retreat to their secret hideout on Monkey Island. Guybrush buys a ship and hires Carla, Otis, and Meathook as crew before setting sail. On Monkey Island, Guybrush discovers a village of cannibals in a dispute with Herman Toothrot, a castaway marooned there. He settles their quarrel, then recovers a magical &quot;voodoo root&quot; from LeChuck&#x27;s ship for the cannibals, who provide him with a seltzer bottle of &quot;voodoo root elixir&quot; that can destroy ghosts.

When Guybrush returns to LeChuck&#x27;s ship with the elixir, he learns that LeChuck has returned to Mêlée Island to marry Elaine at the church. He promptly returns to Mêlée Island and gatecrashes the wedding, only to ruin Elaine&#x27;s own plan for escape; in the process he loses the elixir. Now confronted with a furious LeChuck, Guybrush is savagely beaten by the ghost pirate in a fight ranging across the island. At the ship emporium, Guybrush finds a bottle of root beer. Substituting it for the lost elixir, he sprays LeChuck, destroying him. Guybrush and Elaine enjoy a romantic moment, watching fireworks caused by LeChuck exploding.

==Development==
===Origin and writing===
Ron Gilbert conceived the idea of a pirate adventure game in 1988, after completing &quot;Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders&quot;. He first wrote story ideas about pirates while spending the weekend at a friend&#x27;s house. Gilbert experimented with introductory paragraphs to find a satisfactory idea. His initial story featured unnamed villains that would eventually become LeChuck and Elaine; Guybrush was absent at this point. He pitched it to Lucasfilm Games&#x27;s staff as a series of short stories. Gilbert&#x27;s idea was warmly received, but production was postponed because Lucasfilm Games assigned its designers, including Gilbert, to &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure&quot;. Development of &quot;The Last Crusade&quot; was finished in 1989, which allowed Gilbert to begin production of &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;, then known internally under the working title &quot;Mutiny on Monkey Island&quot;.

Gilbert soon realised that it would be difficult to design the game by himself; he decided to join forces with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman, both of whom he hired for Lucasfilm. The game&#x27;s insult sword fighting mechanics were influenced by swashbuckling movies starring Errol Flynn, which Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman often watched for inspiration. They noticed that pirates in those films often taunted their opponents instead of attacking them, which gave the designers the idea to base the game&#x27;s duels on insults rather than combat. Writer Orson Scott Card helped them write the insults during a visit to Lucasfilm&#x27;s headquarters at Skywalker Ranch. Many of Gilbert&#x27;s original gameplay ideas were abandoned during the production process, although he stated that &quot;most of that stuff was left out for a reason&quot;.

The game&#x27;s plot, as described by Dave Grossman: &quot;It&#x27;s a story about this young man who comes to an island in search of his life&#x27;s dream. He&#x27;s pursuing his career goals and he discovers love in the process and winds up thinking that was actually more important than what he was doing to begin with. You&#x27;re laughing, but there&#x27;s actually something deeper going on as well&quot;. When work on the plot began, Gilbert discovered that Schafer&#x27;s and Grossman&#x27;s writing styles were too different to form a cohesive whole: Grossman&#x27;s was &quot;very kind of a dry, sarcastic humor&quot; and Schafer&#x27;s was &quot;just a little more in your face&quot;. In reaction, Gilbert assigned them to different characters and story moments depending on what type of comedy was required. Grossman believed that this benefited the game&#x27;s writing, as he and Schafer &quot;were all funny in slightly different ways, and it worked well together&quot;. Schafer and Grossman wrote most of the dialogue while they were programming the game; as a result, much of it was improvised. Some of the dialogue was based on the designers&#x27; personal experiences, such as Guybrush&#x27;s line &quot;I had a feeling in hell there would be mushrooms&quot;, which came from Schafer&#x27;s own hatred of fungi.

The game&#x27;s world and characters were designed primarily by Gilbert. After having read Tim Powers&#x27; historical fantasy novel &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot;, he decided to add paranormal themes to the game&#x27;s plot. He also cited Powers&#x27; book as an influence on the characters, particularly those of Guybrush and LeChuck. Inspiration for the game&#x27;s ambiance came from Gilbert&#x27;s favorite childhood amusement park ride, Pirates of the Caribbean. Grossman said that Gilbert always wanted &quot;to step off the ride&quot; and &quot;talk to the people who lived in that world&quot;. Near the final stages of the design work, Gilbert introduced several characters who were not directly related to the game&#x27;s story. He considered this to be an important decision, as the player would need those seemingly minor characters in later parts of the game and would receive a chance to &quot;really interact with them&quot;.

===Creative and technical design===
Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman&#x27;s primary goal was to create a simpler and more accessible gameplay model than those presented in previous Lucasfilm titles. Gilbert had conceived the main designs and puzzles before production began, which resulted in the bulk of the designers&#x27; work to flesh out his ideas. He was frustrated by the adventure games that Sierra On-Line was releasing at the time, and later said that &quot;you died any time you did anything wrong&quot;. Gilbert considered such gameplay as &quot;a cheap way out for the designer&quot;. He had previously applied his design ideas to the 1987 graphic adventure title &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;, but considered he committed a number of mistakes during development, such as dead-end situations that prevented the player from completing the game and poorly implemented triggers for cutscenes. Gilbert aimed to avoid such errors in &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;. The team decided to make it impossible for the player character to die, with one notable exception, which focused gameplay primarily on world exploration. The Sierra game-over screen was parodied, when Guybrush falls off a cliff only to be bounced back up by a &quot;rubber tree&quot;. Guybrush can also be killed by drowning, though it is an Easter Egg unlikely to be found without conscientious effort.

&quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; was the fifth Lucasfilm Games project powered by the SCUMM engine, originally developed for &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;. The company had gradually modified the engine since its creation. For &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;, the developers hard coded verb commands in the SCUMM scripting language. These commands become more abstract in subsequent versions of the engine. The developers carried over the practice of referring to individual segments of the gameworld as &quot;rooms&quot;, even though the areas in &quot;Monkey Island&quot; were outdoors. The game uses the same version of the engine used in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure&quot;, with minor changes. A dialogue tree was added, which facilitated conversation options and the sword-fighting puzzles. The developers removed the &quot;What is&quot; option (an input command that describes an on-screen object to the player) in favor of allowing the player to simply highlight the object with the mouse cursor. The game&#x27;s improved interface became the standard for the company&#x27;s later titles. The game also introduced logical verb shortcuts, which could be performed with the mouse; for example, clicking on a character defaults to the &quot;talk&quot; action, the most obvious action in the situation. SCUMM&#x27;s visuals were updated for the game—the original EGA version had a 320x200 pixel resolution rendered in 16 colors. According to artist Steve Purcell, that became a major limitation for the art team; due to a low number of &quot;ghastly&quot; colors, they often chose bizarre tones for backgrounds. They chose black and white for Guybrush&#x27;s outfit for the same reason. The VGA version of the game later corrected these issues by implementing 256-color support, which allowed for more advanced background and character art. Other platform releases removed the infamous &quot;stump joke&quot; from the game, which was a joke in the EGA version in which the player would examine a tree stump in the forest. Guybrush would exclaim that there is an opening to a system of catacombs and attempt to enter, but this would result in a message stating the player needed to insert disc 22, then 36, then 114 in order to continue. The joke resulted in numerous calls to the LucasArts hotline asking about missing discs. As a result, the joke was removed from later editions and is mentioned as a conversation option for the LucasArts Hint Hotline in the sequel.

The game&#x27;s &quot;pirate reggae&quot; music was composed by Lucasfilm Games&#x27; in-house musician Michael Land in MIDI format. It was his first project at the company. The game was originally released for floppy disk in 1990, but a CD-ROM version with a high-quality CD soundtrack followed in 1992. The music has remained popular, and has been remixed by the musicians of OverClocked ReMix and by the game&#x27;s fans.

&quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; ultimately cost $200,000 to produce, and was developed over nine months.

===Special edition===
LucasArts released a remake with updated audiovisuals titled &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition&quot; in July 2009 for iPhone, Microsoft Windows, and Xbox 360 exclusively via digital distribution. LucasArts confirmed the game&#x27;s development one month earlier on June 1; rumors appeared several days earlier when the Xbox 360 version of the game received an USK rating. The game was developed by A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. Games. The game was first displayed to the public at the E3 expo in June. The remake features hand-drawn visuals with more detail, a remastered musical score, voice work for characters, and a hint system. The developers included the function to switch between new and original audiovisuals at will. The voice actors included Dominic Armato as Guybrush Threepwood and Earl Boen as LeChuck; most had provided voice work in sequels to &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;.

LucasArts&#x27;s game producer Craig Derrick and his team conceived the idea of the remake in 2008. After researching the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series&#x27; history, they decided to make &quot;something fresh and new while staying true to the original&quot;, which resulted in the idea of &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; remake. The developers tried to leave much of the original design unchanged. Any changes were intended to achieve the level of immersion desired for the original. To that end, they added details like a pirate ship or pirates talking in the background of scenes. While the team considered the SCUMM interface revolutionary at the time, LucasArts community manager Brooks Brown noted that it is incompatible with an analog stick, which most consoles use. The designers made the cursor contextual to the game objects as the primary interface. Brown had considered updating the reference to advertise &quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed&quot; because &quot;Loom&quot; was not on the market at the time, but concluded that the game would not be the same if such changes were implemented. Prior to the &quot;Special Edition&quot; release, however, LucasArts announced that &quot;Loom&quot;, along with other games from its back catalog, would be made available on Steam. Brown stated that the decision to distribute the game online was because &quot;digital downloads have finally gotten going&quot;.

The Special Editions of &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; and its sequel were later released physically for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC (exclusively in Europe) as &quot;Monkey Island Special Edition Collection&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; received positive reviews from critics. According to Gilbert, it &quot;sold well&quot; but was &quot;never a big hit&quot;. Grossman later summarized that the game&#x27;s sales were &quot;north of 100,000, far south of 1 million. Back in those days, a few hundred thousand was a giant smash hit&quot;. According to &quot;Next Generation&quot;, &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; was a &quot;relatively minor hit&quot; in the United States, but the game and its sequel became &quot;blockbusters on the PC and the Amiga throughout Europe&quot;.

Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser of &quot;Dragon&quot; praised the designers&#x27; attention to detail, and cited the game&#x27;s humor as a high point. Although they believed that the game was too expensive, they summarized it as &quot;a highly enjoyable graphic adventure replete with interesting puzzles, a fantastic Roland soundtrack, superb VGA graphics, smooth-scrolling animation, and some of the funniest lines ever seen on your computer screen&quot;. Duncan MacDonald of &quot;Zero&quot; praised the graphics and found the game &quot;quite amusing&quot;. His favorite aspect was the fine-tuned difficulty level, which he believed was &quot;just right&quot;, ending his review with &quot;at last an adventure game that&#x27;s enjoyable rather than frustrating&quot;. Paul Glancey of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; consider the game superior to Lucasfilm&#x27;s earlier adventure titles, and wrote that &quot;usually the entertainment you get from an adventure is derived solely from solving puzzles, but the hilarious characters and situations, and the movie-like presentation ... make playing this more like taking part in a comedy film, so it&#x27;s much more enjoyable&quot;. He considered the puzzles to be &quot;brilliantly conceived&quot; and found the game&#x27;s controls accessible. He summarized it as &quot;utterly enthralling&quot;.

&quot;ACE&quot;″s Steve Cooke also found the controls convenient, and he praised the game&#x27;s atmosphere. He wrote that, &quot;in graphics and sound terms ... &quot;Monkey Island&quot;, along with &quot;King&#x27;s Quest V&quot;, is currently at the head of the pack&quot;. However, he disliked the designers&#x27; running joke of placing &quot;TM&quot; after character and place names, which he thought detracted from the atmosphere. He singled out the game&#x27;s writing, characters and plot structure as its best elements. &quot;Amiga Power&quot;″s Mark Ramshaw wrote &quot;with &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;, the mouse-controlled, graphic-adventure comes of age&quot;. He lauded its comedic elements, which he believed were the highlight of the game. The reviewer also praised the control scheme, noting that it allows the player to &quot;more or less forget about the specifics of what [they are] physically doing ... and lose [themselves] in the adventure instead&quot;. He noted that the game&#x27;s plot and visual and aural presentation fit together to create a thick atmosphere, and finished: &quot;Forget all those other milestone adventures (&quot;Zork&quot;, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; &quot;et al&quot;) — for sheer enjoyment and general all-round perfection, &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; creams &#x27;em all in style&quot;. The game, along with its sequel, was ranked the 19th best game of all time by &quot;Amiga Power&quot;.

Writing for &quot;The One&quot;, Paul Presley stated that &quot;Lucasfilm appears to have taken all of the elements that worked in its previous releases and, not only incorporated them into this tale of scurvy swashbuckling, but even improved on them in the process!&quot; Like the other reviewers, he praised its controls. He also lauded its &quot;hilarious storyline, strong characters and ... intriguing setting&quot;, but complained about graphical slowdowns. Nick Clarkson of &quot;Amiga Computing&quot; cited the game&#x27;s graphics as &quot;flawless&quot;, noting that &quot;the characters are superbly animated and the backdrops simply ooze atmosphere&quot;. He highly praised its sound effects and music, and believed that its controls &quot;couldn&#x27;t be simpler&quot;. The staff of &quot;Amiga Action&quot; wrote that the &quot;attention to detail and the finely tuned gameplay cannot be faulted&quot;. They called the graphics &quot;stunning throughout&quot;, and believed that, when they were combined with the &quot;excellent Caribbean tunes&quot;, the result is a game filled with character and atmosphere. They ended by stating that &quot;there is absolutely no excuse for not owning this game&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; said that &quot;&quot;Monkey Island&quot; offers up LucasArt&#x27;s famous humor at its best ... For an adventure you&#x27;ll long remember, raise your cup of grog&quot;.

&quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; has featured regularly in lists of &quot;top&quot; games, such as &quot;Computer Gaming World&#x27;s&quot; Hall of Fame and IGN&#x27;s Video Game Hall of Fame. In 1991, &quot;PC Format&quot; placed &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; on its list of the 50 best computer games of all time, calling it &quot;genuinely funny&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; ranked it as the 19th best game of all time, writing: &quot;Who could ever forget the insult-driven duel system or the identity of the mysterious Swordmaster?&quot;. In 2004, readers of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; voted it as the 33rd top retro game. IGN named &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; one of the ten best LucasArts adventure games in 2009, and ranked the Xbox Live Arcade version as the 20th best title of all time for that platform in 2010. In 2017, &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; ranked 78th in the &quot;Scientifically Proven Best Video Games of All Time&quot;, a statistical meta-analysis compiled by Warp Zoned of 44 &quot;top games&quot; lists published between 1995 and 2016.

===Special edition===
Like the original release, &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition&quot; received positive reviews from critics. Sean Ely of &quot;GamePro&quot; praised its updated audio, and said that the new graphics &quot;blow the old clunker visuals ... out of the water&quot;. He cited its script, humor, plot, puzzles and balanced difficulty level as high points, and finished, &quot;&quot;The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition&quot; is impressive, hilarious and downright worth your money&quot;. Daemon Hatfield of IGN wrote: &quot;Almost 20 years after its release, [&quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;] remains a blast to play&quot;. He called the new graphics &quot;slick, if a little generic&quot;, and noted that the &quot;original graphics have a certain charm to them that the fancy pants new visuals just don&#x27;t&quot;, but he enjoyed the redone music, the new hint function, and the added sound effects and voice acting. He summarized it as &quot;one of the best times you&#x27;ll ever have pointing and clicking&quot;, and noted that &quot;few games are this funny&quot;. Justin Calvert of GameSpot noted that &quot;the Special Edition looks much better and is the only way to play if you want to hear ... what characters are saying, whereas the original game&#x27;s interface is less clunky&quot;. However, he wrote that &quot;the voice work is such a great addition to the game that it&#x27;s difficult to go back to the original edition&quot;. He praised its humor, writing, puzzles and characters, and he believed that it had aged well. Eurogamer&#x27;s Dan Whitehead wrote: &quot;Purists like me will almost certainly find something to grumble about over the span of the game, but the overall impact of the redesign is undeniably for the better&quot;. He preferred the original game&#x27;s Guybrush design, and believed that the new control system was &quot;rather less intuitive&quot; than the old one. He finished by stating that &quot;few games can stand the test of time with such confidence&quot;.

==Legacy==

&quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; spawned five sequels. The first, &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, was released in 1991 and focuses on LeChuck&#x27;s return. Six years later, LucasArts released &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;, which features a new visual design. In 2000, the company released &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot;, which uses the GrimE engine of &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; to produce 3D graphics. The next title, &quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot; released in 2009, is a series of five episodic chapters. The most recent title, &quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot;, was released in 2022 and revisits several locations and characters from the first game.

Elements of the game have appeared elsewhere in popular culture. The original version was selected as one of five for the exhibition &quot;The Art of Video Games&quot; in the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2011. A fictive drink recipe in the game for grog was mistakenly reported as real in 2009 by Argentine news channel C5N, which urged teenagers against consuming the dangerous &quot;Grog XD&quot; drink. In &quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot;, Guybrush refers to this news story while pushing the Grog XD button on a Grog machine.

In a celebration of the game&#x27;s 30th anniversary, Ron Gilbert shared secrets from its original source code during a video conversation with the Video Games History Foundation. These included early character prototypes, unused animations and alternative game environments.

On July 20, 2023 game studio Rare LTD released an update for their game &quot;Sea of Thieves&quot; where players could visit Mêlée Island and interact with characters of the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; game series in a new adventure bridging the stories of both worlds.

<text>The Curse of Monkey Island is an adventure PC game developed and published by LucasArts in 1997. A sequel to 1991&#x27;s &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge,&quot; it is the third game in the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series.

It follows protagonist Guybrush Threepwood as he seeks to lift a curse from his love Elaine Marley, while once again being menaced by undead pirate LeChuck. It was made by a different creative team than the prior games, and took new directions in graphics and gameplay: The art has a cartoon-like cel animation style, and the previous games&#x27; verb command and inventory menus are replaced by a pop-up action menu and inventory chest. &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; was the twelfth and final LucasArts game to use the SCUMM engine, which was extensively upgraded for the game. It was the first game in the series to be released on CD-ROM, allowing for a full musical score, fully animated cutscenes, and the introduction of voice acting for the characters. Dominic Armato, Alexandra Boyd, and Earl Boen respectively voiced Guybrush, Elaine, and LeChuck, and would reprise these roles in later installments.

The game sold well, particularly in Germany; lead background artist Bill Tiller estimated that it sold half a million units worldwide over the next several years. It was nominated for several gaming awards, and was named the best adventure game of the year by several gaming publications. It was followed in 2000 by &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot;, which again took the series&#x27; graphics and gameplay in new directions.

==Gameplay==

&quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; is a point-and-click adventure game. The SCUMM engine used to create the interface in the previous &quot;Monkey Island&quot; games was also used for this installment, but the verb command and inventory menus which previously took up the lower portion of the screen are replaced by a pop-up action menu and inventory chest, allowing the game&#x27;s scenes to occupy the entire screen. This was modeled on a similar system used for 1995&#x27;s &quot;Full Throttle&quot;.

The player controls Guybrush&#x27;s actions using a computer mouse and optional keyboard shortcuts. An on-screen cursor changes color to indicate objects or people with which Guybrush may interact. The player can then bring up the action menu, which resembles a gold coin and has three icons: a hand, a skull, and a parrot, respectively corresponding to actions related to the hands, eyes and mouth. The hand typically corresponds to physical actions such as picking something up, using an item, or operating a mechanism; the skull is usually used to look at something; and the parrot to talk to someone or eat something. Alternatively, clicking the right mouse button acts as shortcut to perform the most obvious action; right clicking on a person, for example, will cause Guybrush to talk to them.

The player can also bring up their inventory, which appears as an open chest taking up most of the screen and containing all of the items which Guybrush has collected. By clicking and dragging items around the screen, the player can attempt to use them with other objects in the inventory (for example, combining a diamond with an engagement band to make a diamond ring), or with objects or people in the current scene.

At the start of the game, the player may choose between two difficulty levels: a normal mode, or a &quot;Mega-Monkey&quot; mode with more puzzles to solve. Similarly, during the game&#x27;s third chapter, a choice is offered to either have Guybrush&#x27;s crew assist with ship-to-ship sea combat, or for the player to have full control during these battles.

==Plot==
Following the events of &quot;Monkey Island 2&quot;, Guybrush Threepwood has regained his adult form and escaped from the zombie pirate LeChuck&#x27;s &quot;Carnival of the Damned&quot;. Drifting to Plunder Island, he finds his love interest Elaine Marley under siege by LeChuck. Guybrush is captured and encounters Wally, the diminutive cartographer from the previous game. His actions in escaping cause LeChuck to drop a &quot;voodoo cannonball&quot; which explodes, seemingly obliterating the villain. Guybrush proposes to Elaine using a diamond ring he found in LeChuck&#x27;s treasure hold, but Wally reveals that it carries a curse. Elaine is transformed into a gold statue and soon stolen by pirates. Guybrush receives guidance from the Voodoo Lady, who assisted him in his prior adventures. She tells him that to save Elaine, he must replace the ring with a non-cursed one of greater value which can be found on Blood Island.

Through actions involving a chicken restaurant, a barber shop, a theater performance, caber tossing, a banjo duel, ventriloquism and an exclusive beach club, Guybrush recovers Elaine, obtains a map to Blood Island, commandeers a ship and assembles a crew of three pirate barbers. However, the map is soon stolen by the vain Captain Rottingham. By engaging in sea battles with other pirates, Guybrush acquires treasure to upgrade his ship&#x27;s cannons, and learns enough barbs and retorts to defeat Rottingham in rhyming insult sword fighting. Guybrush&#x27;s ship is caught in a storm and crashes on Blood Island. Meanwhile, LeChuck returns as a fiery demon still bent on eliminating Guybrush and forcing Elaine to become his bride.

On Blood Island, Guybrush encounters the cannibals from Monkey Island, now volcano-worshipping vegetarians. He also finds Stan, a salesman from the previous games, who sets up an insurance business. Guybrush&#x27;s quests on the island involve a hotel, nacho cheese, a hangover cure, tofu, crypts, a talking skull named Murray, a broken lighthouse, and a makeshift compass. He meets the ghost of a debutante who was seduced by LeChuck, who stole the diamond from her heirloom engagement ring and sold it to smugglers on nearby Skull Island. Guybrush acquires her engagement band by reuniting her with another lost love, and cheats at poker to win the diamond from the smugglers. Putting the two together, he places the ring on Elaine&#x27;s finger and breaks the curse, restoring her to normal. However, Guybrush and Elaine are swiftly captured by LeChuck&#x27;s minions and taken to his Carnival of the Damned on Monkey Island.

LeChuck reveals that Big Whoop, the treasure Guybrush sought in the prior game, is actually a portal to hell which turns those who pass through it into immortal undead. When Elaine first spurned him, LeChuck set out to impress her by finding the secret of Monkey Island. His ship was caught in a typhoon, and he was marooned on Blood Island until a ship captained by Elaine&#x27;s grandfather arrived. Learning that Captain Marley and his crew had a map to Big Whoop, Lechuck stole the debutante&#x27;s diamond, sold it to the smugglers, bought a ship, and beat them to its location on Monkey Island, where he passed through the portal and gained supernatural powers. Marley and his crew divided up the map to keep anyone else from finding Big Whoop. LeChuck arranged the crew members&#x27; deaths, and sent Marley and his ship into a whirlpool. Dinky Island, where the map pieces led Guybrush, is an atoll off the coast of Monkey Island, connected to it by underground tunnels. LeChuck built the Big Whoop Carnival to lure sailors onto a roller coaster which carries them into a river of lava, turning them into his skeletal army.

LeChuck transforms Guybrush into a child, but he manages to break the spell and board the roller coaster. Jumping off at dioramas depicting scenes from the previous games, Guybrush improvises an explosive and sets off an avalanche, burying LeChuck under the theme park. Guybrush and Elaine marry and set sail for their honeymoon.

==Development==
&quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; was announced during the European Computer Trade Show in September 1996. According to &quot;Next Generation&quot;, the game&#x27;s predecessors had been &quot;relatively minor hit[s]&quot; in the United States, but became blockbusters on the PC and the Amiga throughout Europe. &quot;Monkey Island&quot; creator Ron Gilbert had parted ways with the series after &quot;Monkey Island 2&quot;, and the new project leaders were Jonathan Ackley and Larry Ahern, both of whom had previously worked on &quot;Full Throttle&quot; (the interface of the game was adopted almost entirely). The lead background artist was Bill Tiller.

During production, examples of major changes include enhancing the role of Murray, the talking skull. Originally intended only to be featured in the first chapter, he proved so popular with test players that he was written to reappear at several points later in the game.

The game was later rereleased on a CD-ROM compilation of &quot;Monkey Island&quot; games, bundled with &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot; called the &quot;Monkey Island Bounty Pack&quot;.

After the game shipped, a &quot;Monkey Island&quot; film was in the works. This was only brought to light when Tony Stacchi, a concept artist for the project, sent his work to The Scumm Bar, a &quot;Monkey Island&quot; fansite. The film was cancelled in the early stages of development but Tony Stacchi published the artwork on his portfolio.

===Audio===
Michael Land, who provided much of the music for the first two games, composed the score. &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; was the first game in the series to feature voice acting. The primary voice cast consisted of Dominic Armato as Guybrush Threepwood; Alexandra Boyd as Elaine Marley and Son Pirate; Earl Boen as LeChuck; Denny Delk as Murray, Skully, and Father Pirate; Neil Ross as Wally B. Feed; Alan Young as Haggis McMutton; Michael Sorich as Edward Van Helgen and Charles DeGoulash (Ghost Groom); Gregg Berger as Cutthroat Bill; and Leilani Jones Wilmore as the Voodoo Lady. Other voice actors included Kay E. Kuter as Griswold Goodsoup, Tom Kane as Captain René Rottingham and the Flying Welshman, Patrick Pinney as Stan, and Victor Raider-Wexler as Slappy Cromwell and the Snowcone Guy. Notables among the remaining voices include Mary Kay Bergman as Minnie &quot;Stronie&quot; Goodsoup (Ghost Bride), Gary Coleman as Kenny Falmouth, and future &quot;Angel&quot; star Glenn Quinn as Pirate #5.

===Differences in localized versions===
Non-English versions of the game omit the section at the beginning of the second CD, where Guybrush&#x27;s crew sings the song &quot;A Pirate I Was Meant To Be&quot;. In this section, the player as Guybrush has to stop the crew&#x27;s singing - however, at each attempt, they just start a new stanza rhyming to the player&#x27;s line, until he says a line ending with the word &quot;orange&quot; making the song unable to continue. As the whole section relies on Anglophonic rhyming, it was removed from non-English versions of the game.

==Reception==
===Sales===
&quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; sold 52,049 copies in the United States by the end of 1997, according to market research firm PC Data. Another 40,538 copies were purchased in the country between January 1998 and July 1998, which drew revenues of $1.57 million for the period. The game was a success in the German market: Heinrich Lenhardt of &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; wrote, &quot;[I]f it wasn&#x27;t for the sales figures in Germany, LucasArts probably wouldn&#x27;t have bothered&quot; to continue the franchise. In the second half of November 1997, &quot;Curse&quot; debuted at #4 on Media Control&#x27;s computer game sales charts for the German market. It held in the top 10 through January 1998, peaking in third place for the first half of December, and its streak in the top 20 continued through March. The game had spent 24 weeks in Media Control&#x27;s top rankings by the end of May, when it secured 27th place. In August 1998, &quot;Curse&quot; received a &quot;Gold&quot; award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (V.U.D.), indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

The game remained on shelves by 2001: that year, PC Data reported sales of another 19,552 units in North America. Louis Castle of Westwood Studios estimated &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;″s lifetime sales at 300,000 copies by 2002, while LucasArts&#x27; Bill Tiller stated in 2003 that &quot;CMI&quot; sold over half a million units worldwide. Tiller recalled total sales between 700,000 and 800,000 copies in 2009.

===Critical reviews===
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; said that &quot;The Curse of the Monkey Island&quot; is a worthy addition in LucasArts&#x27;s pantheon of the adventure games. GameSpot praised the cartoonish graphical style, the music, the pop culture witticisms, the characters, and the challenging but not frustrating puzzles. &quot;Next Generation&quot; remarked that the game is superficially attractive, with LucasArts&#x27;s usual superlative production values showing in the music, artwork, voice acting, and animation, but suffers from uninspired puzzle design, a lack of a strong narrative pull, an absence of genuine innovation over the first two &quot;Monkey Island&quot; games, and a number of pop culture references that serve only to jerk the player out of the atmosphere. They concluded that the game is just barely fun enough to satisfy fans of the series. Just Adventure praised the game&#x27;s music as enjoyable. Adventure Classic Gaming addressed plot criticism, saying &quot;Some gamers may criticize the numerous farfetched plot twists in this game&quot;, while &quot;some may just call it creative writing!&quot;, and Adrenaline Vault likened &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; to the adventure genre as a whole: &quot;The twin vitals of an adventure game are a good plot coupled with strong dialogue. This game has both, in spades&quot;.

Although Adventure Gamers cited the graphic style&#x27;s &quot;refusal to take itself seriously&quot; was adding &quot;immensely to the game&#x27;s charm&quot;, they found the secondary characters &quot;criminally underdeveloped&quot; and the ending as anticlimactic. The abrupt ending of the game received criticism from GameSpot, Just Adventure and &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, the last of which called it &quot;the game&#x27;s only real disappointment&quot;. &quot;PC Zone&quot; described that due to the introduction of cartoonish graphics &quot;for &quot;Monkey&quot; devotees of the first two titles something tiny and almost intangible has been lost&quot;, while still scoring the game a 92/100, praising the voice over work and humor of the game.

In a retrospective review, RPGFan commented that the additions of detailed graphics and the spoken dialogue managed to take the story to a whole new level.

===Awards===
The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; for &quot;Computer Entertainment Title of the Year&quot;, &quot;PC Adventure Game of the Year&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics&quot; at the inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards, which were ultimately awarded to &quot;StarCraft&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, respectively. Similarly, the Computer Game Developers Conference nominated &quot;Curse&quot; for four Spotlight Awards, including &quot;Best Adventure/RPG&quot;, but these ultimately went to other titles. However, it was named the best adventure game of 1997 by &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot;, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, GameSpot and &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;. It also won GameSpot&#x27;s &quot;Best Cinematics&quot; prize. The editors of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; wrote: &quot;Simply everything is done right in this game: lush graphics, outstanding voice acting, strong storyline, clever puzzles, and, best of all, a script with more big laughs in it than just about anything at the movies these days. It is, easily, the most entertaining adventure in years&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1998, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; declared it the 33rd-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it &quot;a grand, timeless adventure, sharply written and flawlessly voice-acted&quot;.

In 2008, Ron Gilbert praised &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;, calling it &quot;great&quot; and remarking that &quot;they did an excellent job of capturing the humor and feel of the game&quot;.

In 2011, Adventure Gamers named &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; the 45th-best adventure game ever released.

<doc id="80984" wikidata="Q956588" url="?curid=80984" title="Earl of Pembroke">
<text>Earl of Pembroke is a title in the Peerage of England that was first created in the 12th century by King Stephen of England. The title, which is associated with Pembroke, Pembrokeshire in West Wales, has been recreated ten times from its original inception. Due to the number of creations of the Earldom, the original seat of Pembroke Castle is no longer attached to the title.

, the current holder of the earldom is William Herbert, 18th Earl of Pembroke, which is the 10th creation of the title. For the past 400 years, his family&#x27;s seat has been Wilton House, Wiltshire. The Earls of Pembroke also hold the title [[Earl of Montgomery]], created for the younger son of Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke before he succeeded as the 4th Earl in 1630. The current Earls of Pembroke also carry the subsidiary titles: Baron Herbert of Cardiff, of Cardiff in the County of Glamorgan (1551), Baron Herbert of Shurland, of Shurland in the Isle of Sheppey in the County of Kent (1605), and [[Baron Herbert of Lea]], of Lea in the County of Wilts (1861). All are in the Peerage of England except the Barony of Herbert of Lea, which is in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The Earl of Pembroke is the hereditary visitor of Jesus College, Oxford.

On 1 September 1532, King Henry VIII created the original Marquessate of Pembroke for his future queen Anne Boleyn. This honour was in recognition of the king&#x27;s great-uncle Jasper Tudor, who had been the Earl of Pembroke in the 15th century, and his own father, Henry VII who was born at Pembroke Castle in January 1457.

==History==
The title of Earl of Pembroke has been held successively by several English families, the jurisdiction and dignity being originally attached to the county palatine of Pembrokeshire. The first creation dates from 1138, when the Earldom of Pembroke was conferred by King Stephen on Gilbert de Clare (died 1148), son of Gilbert Fitz-Richard, who possessed the Lordship of Strigul (Estrighoiel, in Domesday Book), the modern Chepstow. In the Battle of Lincoln (1141), the Earl fought on the side of King Stephen. After the king&#x27;s defeat, however, he joined the party of the Empress Matilda. Later he became reconciled to Stephen when he recovered his throne. The earl married Henry I&#x27;s mistress, Isabel, daughter of Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester.

That being said, Arnulf de Montgomery was likely created Earl of Pembroke by William Rufus, decades before Gilbert de Clare. Arnulf himself was rewarded by the king with the lordship of Pembroke upon his family&#x27;s construction of Pembroke Castle in the late 11th century.

===The first creation: de Clare (1138)===
* Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1100–1147)
* Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (1130–1176)
* Gilbert de Clare, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (1173–1185)
* Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke (1172–1220)

Like his father Richard Fitz Gilbert, de Clare (commonly known as Strongbow) was a supporter of Stephen, King of England - the last Norman king of England. His opposition to the claims of the French House of Anjou alienated him from the affections of Henry II of England. As a result, on his father&#x27;s death in 1148, it seems likely that the king refused to recognise Richard&#x27;s claims to the earldom of Pembroke. His claim to the lesser lordship of Striguil does not seem to have been challenged. Being effectively disinherited by the king (for the first but not the last time in his life) and with mounting debts, Richard welcomed the opportunity to restore his fortunes that presented itself in 1168. In that year, he was chosen to lead a Norman expedition to Ireland in support of Diarmait Mac Murchada, the deposed King of Leinster. The Lord of Striguil crossed over in person in 1170, took both Waterford and Dublin, and was married to Diarmuid&#x27;s daughter, Aoife MacMurrough, claiming the Kingship of Leinster after Diarmuid&#x27;s death in 1171. Henry II, wary of his power, stripped Strongbow of his new holdings the same year and invaded Ireland himself in 1171, putting his people in power. Strongbow returned to favour and power in Ireland, in 1173 when he aided the King in his campaign against his rebelling sons. He died in 1176 after years of bitter struggle with Irish magnates.

Strongbow died with male issue - Gilbert. However, Gilbert, being a minor, was not formally invested with either the earldom of Pembroke or of Striguil. It is unlikely that his father could have passed on the title to Pembroke as he himself did not possess it. When Gilbert died in 1185, his sister Isabel de Clare became Countess of Pembroke in her own right (&quot;suo jure&quot;) until her death in 1220. In this way, she could be said to be the first successor to the earldom of Pembroke since her grandfather Gilbert, the first earl. By this reckoning, Isabel ought to be called the second countess, not the fourth countess of Pembroke.

In any event, the title Earl was re-created for her husband as her consort, the famous Sir William Marshal, son of John the Marshal, by Sibylle, the sister of Patrick, Earl of Salisbury.

===The second creation: Marshal (1199)===

* William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1146–1219)
* William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (1190–1231)
* Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (c. 11911234)
* Gilbert Marshal, 4th Earl of Pembroke (died 1241)
* Walter Marshal, 5th Earl of Pembroke (c. 11991245)
* Anselm Marshal, 6th Earl of Pembroke (died 1245)

In August 1189, at the age of 43, William Marshal, held by many to be the greatest knight in Christendom, was given the hand of Isabel de Clare, and, in 1199, was created the 1st Earl of Pembroke by King John. Although he had previously served Richard&#x27;s father, Henry II, against Richard&#x27;s rebellions, Richard confirmed the old King&#x27;s licence for his marriage with the heiress of Strigul and Pembroke. He served Richard and John loyally, defending the latter against the French and English rebel barons in the First Barons&#x27; War. He was present at the signing of Magna Carta in 1215. Upon John&#x27;s death in 1216, the seventy-year-old Marshal was named Regent of the kingdom and protector of the young King, Henry III. He defeated the rebels and their French allies, and reissued Magna Carta in order to secure the peace. He fell ill early in 1219, and died on 14 May at his manor of Caversham near Reading. He was succeeded in the regency by Hubert de Burgh, and in his Earldom by his five sons in succession.

Marshal&#x27;s eldest son, William Marshal (died 1231), 2nd Earl of Pembroke of this line, passed some years in warfare in Wales and Ireland, where he was justiciar from 1224 to 1226; he also served Henry III in France. His second wife was the King&#x27;s sister, Eleanor, who later married Simon de Montfort, but he left no children.

His brother Richard Marshal (died 1234), 3rd Earl, came to the fore as the leader of the baronial party, and chief antagonist of the foreign friends of Henry III. Fearing treachery, he refused to visit the King at Gloucester in August 1233, and Henry declared him a traitor. He crossed to Ireland, where Peter des Roches had instigated his enemies to attack him, and in April 1234, he was overpowered and wounded, and died a prisoner.

His brother Gilbert (d. 1241), who became the 4th Earl, was a friend and ally of Richard, Earl of Cornwall. When another brother, Anselm, the 6th Earl, died in December 1245, the male descendants of the great Earl Marshal became extinct. The extensive family possessions were now divided among Anselm&#x27;s five sisters and their descendants, the Earldom of Pembroke reverting to the Crown.

===The third creation: de Valence (1247)===
* William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke (c. 12251296)
* Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (c. 12751324) (extinct)

The next holder of the lands of the Earldom of Pembroke was William de Valence, a younger son of Hugh de Lusignan, count of La Marche, by his marriage with Isabella of Angoulême, widow of the English King John. In 1247, William, along with two of his brothers, moved from France to England, where their half-brother, Henry III was King. The King married William to Joan de Munchensi (d. 1307), a granddaughter and heiress to the great William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke. Valence was granted custody of the lands, and the title of Earl of Pembroke, giving him great wealth and power in his new land. As a result, he was unpopular, and was heavily involved in the Second Barons&#x27; War, supporting the King and Prince Edward against the rebels led by Simon de Montfort. After the final defeat of the rebels at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, William continued to serve Henry III, and then Edward I, until his death in 1296.

William&#x27;s eldest surviving son, Aymer (c. 12751324), succeeded to his father&#x27;s estates, but was not formally recognized as Earl of Pembroke until after the death of his mother Joan in 1307. He was appointed guardian of Scotland in 1306, but with the accession of Edward II to the throne and the consequent rise of Piers Gaveston to power, his influence declined. He became prominent among the discontented nobles, but in 1312, after the Earl of Warwick betrayed him by executing the captured Gaveston, he left the allied lords and joined the King. Valence was present at Bannockburn in 1314, and later helped King Edward defeat Thomas of Lancaster. However, by his death in 1324, he was again marginalized at court, and in financial trouble as well. His wife, Marie de St Pol, a descendant of King Henry III, was the founder of Pembroke College, Cambridge.

===The fourth creation (1339): Hastings===
* Laurence Hastings, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1319–1348)
* John Hastings, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (1347–1375)
* John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (1372–1389) (extinct)

Lawrence, a great-grandson of William de Valence was created, or recognized as, Earl of Pembroke, having inherited (through the female line) a portion of the estates of the Valence Earls of Pembroke. His son John (died 1376) married Margaret, daughter of King Edward III, and on the death without issue of his grandson in 1389, the Earldom of Pembroke reverted again to the Crown.

===The fifth creation (1414): Plantagenet===
* Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester (1390–1447) (extinct)
Humphrey, the fourth son of King Henry IV, was created Duke of Gloucester and Earl of Pembroke for life, these titles being subsequently made hereditary, with a reversion as regards the Earldom of Pembroke, in default of heirs to Humphrey, to William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk.

===The sixth creation (1447): de la Pole===
* William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk (1396–1450) (extinct)
On the death of Humphrey without legitimate issue in 1447, William de la Pole became Earl of Pembroke. He was beheaded in 1450 and his titles were forfeited.

===The seventh creation (1452): Tudor===
* Jasper Tudor, 1st Duke of Bedford (c. 1431–1495) (forfeit 1461; restored 1485) (extinct)
Sir Jasper Tudor was the half-brother of King Henry VI. Being a Lancastrian, his title was forfeited for 24 years during the predominance of the House of York.

===The eighth creation (1468): Herbert===
* William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1423–1469)
* William Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (died 1491) (surrendered 1479)
Following Jasper Tudor&#x27;s attainder, Sir William Herbert, a zealous Yorkist, was raised to the peerage as Baron Herbert by Edward IV. Herbert took the Lancastrian Jasper Tudor prisoner during the civil war. For this service, he was created Earl of Pembroke in 1468. Perhaps mindful of its earlier Tudor holder, the second earl surrendered his title to Edward IV ten years after acceding and received, in lieu, the Earldom of Huntingdon. 

The grandson of William Herbert,1st Earl of Pembroke was newly created Earl of Pembroke in 1551 and the current Earl is a descendant of this house.

===The ninth creation (1479): House of York===
* Edward Plantagenet (1470–1483) (merged into crown 1483)
In 1479, Edward IV conferred the title on his son, Edward, Prince of Wales. When this prince succeeded to the throne as Edward V of England, the Earldom of Pembroke merged with the crown.
Following the defeat of the House of York, the earldom (and kingdom) were restored to the Tudors with the accession of Henry VII.

===Marquess of Pembroke (1532): Anne Boleyn===
* Anne Boleyn, (1501/7–1536)
On 1 September 1532, a few months prior to her marriage to Henry VIII, Anne was granted the Marquessate of Pembroke; she was found guilty of treason and executed in May 1536, at which point the title became either forfeit or extinct at her death without male children.

===The tenth creation (1551): Herbert===
The title was next revived in favour of Sir William Herbert, whose father, Richard, was an illegitimate son of the 1st Earl of Pembroke of the house of Herbert. He had married Anne Parr, sister of Henry VIII&#x27;s sixth wife, Catherine Parr, and was created Earl in 1551. The title has since been held by their descendants.

* William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1501–1570)
* Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (1534–1601)
* William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (1580–1630)
* Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke, 1st Earl of Montgomery (1584–1649)
* Philip Herbert, 5th Earl of Pembroke, 2nd Earl of Montgomery (1621–1669)

The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s son Reginald Henry Michael Herbert, Lord Herbert (b. 2012).

An executor of Henry VIII&#x27;s will and the recipient of valuable grants of land, Herbert was a prominent and powerful personage during the reign of Edward VI, with both the protector Somerset and his rival, John Dudley, afterwards Duke of Northumberland, angling for his support. He threw in his lot with Dudley, and after Somerset&#x27;s fall obtained some of his lands in Wiltshire and a peerage. It has been asserted that he devised the scheme for settling the English crown on Lady Jane Grey; at all events, he was one of her advisers during her short reign, but he declared for Mary when he saw that Lady Jane&#x27;s cause was lost. Pembroke&#x27;s loyalty was at times suspected by Mary and her friends, but he was employed as governor of Calais, as president of Wales and in other ways. He was also to some extent in the confidence of Philip II of Spain. The Earl retained his place at court under Elizabeth until 1569, when he was suspected of favouring the projected marriage between Mary, Queen of Scots, and the Duke of Norfolk. Among the monastic lands granted to Herbert was the estate of Wilton, near Salisbury, still the residence of the Earls of Pembroke.

His elder son Henry (c. 15341601), who succeeded as 2nd Earl, was president of Wales from 1586 until his death. He married in 1577 Mary Sidney, the famous Countess of Pembroke (c. 1561–1621), third daughter of Sir Henry Sidney and his wife Mary Dudley. Sir Philip Sidney, to whom she was deeply attached through life, was her eldest brother. Sir Philip spent the summer of 1580 with her at Wilton, or at Ivychurch, a favourite retreat of hers close by. Here at her request, he began the &quot;Countess of Pembroke&#x27;s Arcadia&quot;, which was intended for her pleasure alone, not for publication. The two also worked on a metrical edition of the Psalms. When the great sorrow of her brother&#x27;s death came upon her she made herself his literary executor, correcting the unauthorized editions of the Arcadia and of his poems, which appeared in 1590 and 1591. She also took under her patronage the poets who had looked to her brother for protection. Spenser dedicated his &quot;Ruines of Time&quot; to her, and refers to her as &quot;Urania&quot; in &quot;Colin Clout&#x27;s come home againe&quot;; in Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Astrophel&quot; she is &quot;Clorinda&quot;. In 1599 Queen Elizabeth was her guest at Wilton, and the Countess composed for the occasion a pastoral dialogue in praise of Astraea. After her husband&#x27;s death, she lived chiefly in London at Crosby Hall, where she died.

The Countess&#x27;s other works include &quot;A Discourse of Life and Death&quot;, translated from the French of Plessis du Mornay (1593), and &quot;Antoine&quot; (1592), a version of a tragedy of Robert Garnier. She is one of the handful of people whom certain scholars conjecture may have been the true author of the plays attributed to William Shakespeare. Robin Williams&#x27; book &quot;Sweet Swan of Avon&quot; published by Wilton Circle Press, USA, documents the Countess&#x27;s fascinating life as well as those of her two sons (see below).

William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (1580–1630), eldest son of the 2nd Earl and his famous countess, was a conspicuous figure in the society of his time and at the court of James I. Several times he found himself opposed to the schemes of the Duke of Buckingham, and he was keenly interested in the colonization of America. He was Lord Chamberlain of the royal household from 1615 to 1625 and Lord Steward from 1626 to 1630. He was Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 1624 when Thomas Tesdale and Richard Wightwick refounded Broadgates Hall and named it Pembroke College in his honour. By some Shakespearian commentators, Pembroke has been identified with the &quot;Mr W. H.&quot; referred to as &quot;the onlie begetter&quot; of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets in the dedication by Thomas Thorpe, the owner of the published manuscript, while his mistress, Mary Fitton, has been identified with the &quot;dark lady&quot; of the sonnets. In both cases, the identification rests on very questionable evidence. He and his brother Philip (the second Herbert son who, for some profitable time, was the adored object of &quot;bisexual&quot; King James I&#x27;s affections) are the &quot;incomparable pair of brethren&quot; to whom the First Folio of Shakespeare is inscribed.

The Earl left no sons when he died in London on 10 April 1630. Clarendon gives a eulogistic account of Pembroke, who appears, however, to have been a man of weak character and dissolute life. Gardiner describes him as the Hamlet of the English court. He had literary tastes and wrote poems; one of his closest friends was the poet Donne, and he was generous to Ben Jonson, Massinger and others.

His brother, Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke (1584–1650), was for some years the chief favourite of James I, owing this position to his comely person and his passion for hunting and for field sports generally. In 1605 King James I of England created him Earl of Montgomery and Baron Herbert of Shurland, and since 1630, when he succeeded to the Earldom of Pembroke, the head of the Herbert family has carried the double title of Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery.

Although Philip&#x27;s quarrelsome disposition often led him into trouble he did not forfeit the esteem of James I, who heaped lands and offices upon him, and he was also trusted by Charles I, who made him Lord Chamberlain in 1626 and frequently visited him at Wilton. He worked to bring about peace between the King and the Scots in 1639 and 1640, but when in the latter year the quarrel between Charles and the English parliament was renewed, he deserted the King who soon deprived him of his office of chamberlain. Trusted by the popular party, Pembroke was made governor of the Isle of Wight, and he was one of the representatives of the parliament on several occasions, notably during the negotiations at Uxbridge in 1645 and at Newport in 1648, and when the Scots surrendered Charles in 1647. From 1641 to 1643, and again from 1647 to 1650, he was Chancellor of the University of Oxford; in 1648 he removed some of the heads of houses from their positions because they would not take the Solemn League and Covenant, and his foul language led to the remark that he was more fitted &quot;&quot;by his eloquence in swearing to preside over Bedlam than a learned academy&quot;.&quot; In 1649, although a peer, he was elected and took his seat in the House of Commons as member for Berkshire, this &quot;ascent downwards&quot; calling forth many satirical writings from the royalist wits. The Earl was a great collector of pictures and had some taste for architecture.

His eldest surviving son, Philip (1621–1669), became 5th Earl of Pembroke, and 2nd Earl of Montgomery; he was twice married, and was succeeded in turn by three of his sons, of whom Phillip, the 7th Earl, was notorious for bouts of homicidal mania, while Thomas, the 8th Earl (c. 1656–1733), was a person of note during the reigns of William III and Anne. From 1690 to 1692 he was first Lord of the Admiralty; then he served as Lord Privy Seal until 1699, being in 1697 the first plenipotentiary of Great Britain at the congress of Ryswick. On two occasions he was Lord High Admiral for a short period; he was also Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, while he acted as one of the Lords Justices seven times; and he was President of the Royal Society in 1689–1690.

His son Henry, the 9th Earl (c. 1693–1750), was a soldier, but was better known as the &quot;architect Earl.&quot; He was largely responsible for the erection of Westminster Bridge. The title descended directly to Henry, 10th Earl (1734–1794), a soldier, who wrote &quot;The Method of Breaking Horses&quot; (1762); then to George Augustus, 11th Earl (1759–1827), an ambassador extraordinary to Vienna in 1807.

Robert Henry, 12th Earl (1791–1862), died in France without issue and was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. George Robert Charles, the 13th Earl (1850–1895), was a grandson of the 10th Earl and a son of Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea, whose second son Sidney (born 1853), after a career as a Member of Parliament, inherited all the family titles at his brother&#x27;s death. His eldest son Reginald became 15th earl in March 1913. He was succeeded by his eldest son Sidney, 16th earl, who spent time in the service of the Duke of Kent and served as a trustee of the National Gallery. His son Henry Herbert, 17th Earl of Pembroke, who was often known simply as Henry Herbert, succeeded to the titles in 1969; he had a significant career as a documentarian and film director.

, the current earl is William Herbert, 18th Earl of Pembroke, who became earl of Pembroke and 15th of Montgomery on the death of his father in 2003.

<text>In Greek mythology, Sidero (Ancient Greek: Σιδηρώ means &quot;the Iron One&quot;) was the second wife of King Salmoneus of Elis and stepmother of Tyro, whom she mistreated. Pelias and Neleus, Tyro&#x27;s twin sons, sought revenge when they reached adulthood. Although Sidero fled from them into Hera&#x27;s district, Pelias nevertheless murdered her atop the altar to Hera, earning the goddess&#x27; undying hatred in the process.

<text>In Greek mythology, Aeson (; Ancient Greek: Αἴσων &quot;Aísōn&quot;) was a king of Iolcus in Thessaly. He was the father of the hero Jason. According to one version of the story, he was imprisoned by his half-brother Pelias, and when Pelias intended to kill him he committed suicide. In another story, he was killed by Jason&#x27;s wife Medea, who brought him back to life as a young man.

== Family ==
Aeson was the son of Cretheus and Tyro. He had two brothers Pheres and Amythaon. Through his mother Tyro who consorted with the sea god Poseidon, he had two half-brothers, Neleus and Pelias.

Aeson was the father of Jason and Promachus with Alcimede, daughter of Phylacus and Clymene. Other sources say the mother of his children was (1) Polymede or Polymele, or Polypheme a daughter of Autolycus, (2) Amphinome, (3) Theognete, daughter of Laodicus, (4) Rhoeo or (5) Arne or (6) Scarphe. 
== Mythology ==
Pelias was power-hungry and he wished to gain dominion over all of Thessaly. To this end, he banished Neleus and Pheres and locked Aeson in the dungeons in Iolcus. Aeson sent Jason to Chiron to be educated while Pelias, afraid that he would be overthrown, was warned by an oracle to beware of a man wearing one sandal.

Many years later, Pelias was holding the Olympics in honor of Poseidon when Jason, rushing to Iolcus, lost one of his sandals in a river while helping Hera, in the form of an old woman, cross. When Jason entered Iolcus, he was announced as a man wearing one sandal. Suspicious, Pelias asked him what he (Jason) would do if confronted with the man who would be his downfall. Jason responded that he would send that man after the Golden Fleece. Pelias took that advice and sent Jason to retrieve the Golden Fleece.

During Jason&#x27;s absence, Pelias intended to kill Aeson. However, Aeson committed suicide by drinking bull&#x27;s blood. His wife killed herself as well, and Pelias murdered their infant son Promachus.

Alternatively, he survived until Jason and his new wife, Medea, came back to Iolcus. She slit Aeson&#x27;s throat, then put his corpse in a pot and Aeson came to life as a young man. She then told Pelias&#x27; daughters she would do the same for their father. They slit his throat and Medea refused to raise him, so Pelias stayed dead.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Argo ( ; ) was the ship of Jason and the Argonauts. The ship was built with divine aid, and some ancient sources describe her as the first ship to sail the seas. The &quot;Argo&quot; carried the Argonauts on their quest for the Golden Fleece from Iolcos to Colchis. After the journey, the ship was retired and dedicated to Poseidon, the divine ruler of the seas.

The ship has gone on to be used as a motif in a variety of sources beyond the original myth from books, films and more.

==Name==
Most accounts name the ship after her builder, Argus. The adjectival form is &quot;Argoan&quot; , from Greek &quot;Ἀργῶος&quot; through Latin &quot;Argōus&quot;.
Diodorus Siculus records that some thought the name was derived from an ancient Greek word for &quot;swift&quot; to indicate that the ship was designed to move quickly. Cicero, the Roman senator and orator, proposed that it was named after the Argives, a name for the Greek people of Argos in the Peloponnese that was commonly used by Homer.

== Construction ==

The &quot;Argo&quot; was constructed by the shipwright Argus, and its crew were specially protected by the goddess Hera. The best source for the myth is the &quot;Argonautica&quot; by Apollonius Rhodius. Argus was said to have planned or constructed the vessel with the help of Athena. The ship was built for travel in the open sea and designed to move quickly with the assistance of a sail. Apollodorus stated the ship had fifty oars, all of which were manned by the Argonauts. His description of the boat would place it as a forerunner or early version of a boat type that became known as a penteconter.

The boat was built with a variety of wood from around the region of Greece. In &quot;Medea&quot;, Euripides mentions the oars were made from pine trees around Mount Pelion. Catullus later mentioned the boat was made out of fir-wood. The prow of the ship was also made with a special piece of oak from Dodona, an area sacred to Zeus. The oak was said to be able to speak with a human voice and could tell oracles.

According to Apollodorus and Catullus, the &quot;Argo&quot; was the first ship to sail the seas and was favored by the gods. Dionysius Scytobrachion called the &quot;Argo&quot; a well crafted vessel but did not consider her the first ship. Some sources state that since people had not seen a ship before they described the &quot;Argo&quot; as a monster.

The &quot;Argo&quot; was built in Thessaly around the area of Mount Pelion. The Roman poet Sextus Propertius, writing during the reign of Augustus, said it departed from the port of Pagasae.

== Voyage ==

It was Athena who taught Tiphys to attach the sails to the mast, since he was the steersman and would need to know the workings of the ship. Other sources say he had previously been a sailor along with two other members, which is why he was chosen to steer the boat. Lynceus was also said to have helped guide the ship because he had great sight during night and day.

The ship carried enough supplies, such as vases holding water, for the collective crew and lasted four days before having to refuel. Other items, such as a bronze tripod, were carried aboard. Herodotus claimed the bronze tripod was given to Triton after the Argonauts got lost in Lake Tritonis and needed assistance. It was said the boat had to be carried over land for 12 days to get back on course.

The &quot;Argo&quot; was said to be loved by the Nereids, who alongside Triton helped guide the ship at dangerous times in the Argonauts&#x27; journey.

== After the journey ==
After her successful journey, &quot;Argo&quot; was consecrated to Poseidon in the Isthmus of Corinth.
Because the ship was a sacred item, having been made with the help of the gods, she was made into a monument as well as being dedicated to the gods. Years later, a beam fell from the top of the ship and killed Jason while he was asleep on the ground. He was then translated into the sky and turned into the constellation Argo Navis.

== In other sources ==
The Argo was a well recognized motif in ancient Greece and has been used in plays, movies, books, philosophical writings and more. Several authors of antiquity (Apollonius Rhodius, Pliny, Philostephanus) discussed the hypothetical shape of the ship. Generally she was imagined like a Greek warship, a galley, and authors hypothesized that she was the first ship of this type that had gone out on a voyage on the high seas. Aristotle used the ship as an example to talk about ostracism in Athens, specifically remarking that the ship left Heracles behind because he was too heavy.

=== 1963 film ===

The version of the &quot;Argo&quot; that appears in the 1963 film &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; was modeled after a Greek warship, with shields lining the side of the boat. On either side of the boat are rowers, who are directed how to row through the drumbeat of a leader. A red sail with the head of the golden ram marks the goal of their journey. Besides its practical purposes, the ship is also decorated with ancient motifs, such as eyes on the front of the ship at the water level.
The sacred oak of the ship is here represented as the head of a woman with partial extending wings making up the stern of the ship. The painted head is modeled on the goddess Hera in the movie (played by Honor Blackman) and has the ability to speak to Jason throughout the movie. Argus, the ship builder, said he was inspired to add that feature to the boat when creating it. Filmmakers gave this head the practical effect of being able to open and close its eyes when speaking to Jason.

<doc id="80989" wikidata="Q3139" url="?curid=80989" title="Alpes-Maritimes">
<text>Alpes-Maritimes (; ; ; ) is a department of France located in the country&#x27;s southeast corner, on the Italian border and Mediterranean coast. Part of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region, it encompasses the French Riviera alongside neighbouring Var. Alpes-Maritimes had a population of 1,094,283 in 2019. Its prefecture (and largest city) is Nice, with Grasse as the sole subprefecture.

Alpes-Maritimes has become one of the world&#x27;s most attractive tourist destinations in recent decades, featuring renowned cities and towns such as Nice, Grasse, Cannes, Antibes, Menton, Èze, Roquebrune-Cap-Martin and Sainte-Agnès, as well as numerous alpine ski resorts. It also entirely surrounds the Principality of Monaco. The department&#x27;s inhabitants are called &quot;Maralpins&quot; (masculine) or &quot;Maralpines&quot; (feminine) but are more commonly referred to as &quot;Azuréens&quot;; its flag and arms are those of the City of Nice. In terms of politics, Alpes-Maritimes is one of France&#x27;s most right-wing departments, as the majority led by The Republicans in the departmental council holds all but two of the 54 seats following the 2021 election.

== Geography ==
=== Overview ===
The Alpes-Maritimes department is surrounded by the departments of Var in the southwest, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence in the northwest; Italy to the north and east; and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. It surrounds the Principality of Monaco on the west, north and east.
Its topography is very mixed. As its name suggests, most of the department is a constituent part of the overall topographic Alps – including the Maritime Alps – but it also has the distinction of being a coastal district with its Mediterranean coast. The coastal area, urbanized and densely populated (shaded in red on the map), includes all the cities in an almost continuous conurbation from Cannes to Menton, while the larger but sparsely populated mountainous area (light green) is fully rural with the exception of the three large resorts of Valberg (created in 1936), Auron (created in 1937) and Isola 2000 (created in 1971).

==== Summits and passes ====
The highest point of the department is the Cime du Gélas () on the Franco-Italian border which dominates the Vallée des Merveilles further east. The summit of Monte Argentera is higher at above sea level, but it is located in Italy. There is also Mount Mounier (), which dominates the south of the vast Dôme de Barrot, formed of a mass more than thick of red mudstones deeply indented by the gorges of Daluis and Cians. Except in winter, four passes allow passage to the north of the Mercantour-Argentera massif whose imposing barrier is covered in winter snow which is visible from the coast. From the west, the Route des Grandes Alpes enters the Cayolle Pass () first on the way to the Alps and the sources of the Var in the commune of Entraunes. Then the route follows the Col de la Bonette – the highest pass in Europe at – to connect to the valley of the Tinée then the Ubaye. Further east, the Col de la Lombarde () above Isola 2000 allows access to the shrine of Saint-Anne de Vinadio in Italy. Finally, at its eastern end, the Col de Tende () links with Cuneo in Italy.

==== Landscape and forest vegetation ====
The only region of the Alps close to Nice has an afforestation rate of 60.9%, slightly higher than the average of the department and well above the average of 39.4% for the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region.

=== Climate ===

It is the climate that made the Côte d&#x27;Azur famous. The current department of Alpes-Maritimes, however, does not have only one climate, the complex terrain and high mountains divide the department between those who are well exposed (the south-facing side) and those which are less (the north-facing side) and even with the mild Mediterranean climate there can be violent storms and prolonged droughts.

The coastal area has a Mediterranean climate (rainfall in autumn November and spring February especially, summer drought, mild winter and dry summer). The interior, especially in the north, has a mountain climate (winter quite bright, summer storms). Around Cannes is a particularly warm micro-climate due to the high hills warming the air which descends on the city.

One of the attractions of the department is its level of sunshine: over 300 days per year. Despite this the department is also the most stormy of France with an average of 70 to 90 thunderstorm days per year, arising from the differences in temperature due to a warm sea in autumn.

As soon as one moves away from the coast, towards the west of the department, the interior plains (in particular near Grasse) the climate is a little less temperate but just as sunny. In summer, the temperature very easily exceeds , while the average is only along the Nice coast during July and August. Occasional frost is possible in the interior during winter, unlike in Nice and rest of the coast, where frost is very rare.

In the east of the department, unlike the west, there are no plains. In the Menton region, the altitude increases very rapidly inland, so the sea tempers the atmosphere much more: the maximum in summer is on average and the winters are milder than in the interior and frost is very rare.

Snow is also rare along the coast, however, it happens that rare snowfall surprises the Côte d&#x27;Azur residents (on average every 5–7 years), as was the case in the winter of 2004–2005 when the city of Nice woke up with a few centimetres of snow, often creating traffic problems. More recently, in February 2010, more than of snow was measured in Cannes and nearly in the Grasse region.

In the north of the department the climate in the Alps is mountainous, and there is decent snow cover from end of November until late April.

=== Subdivisions ===

=== Principal communes ===

The most populous commune is the prefecture Nice. As of 2019, there are 10 communes with more than 20,000 inhabitants:

== History ==
The Roman military district of Alpes Maritimae was created by Augustus in 14 BC. It became a full Roman province in the middle of the 1st century AD, with its capital first at Cemenelum (today Cimiez, a suburb north of Nice) and subsequently at Embrun. At its greatest extent in AD 297, the province reached north to Digne and Briançon.

Conquered by the French First Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars, a department of Alpes-Maritimes was first set up in 1793 with different boundaries from those of the modern department. In 1793, Alpes-Maritimes included Monaco (Port Hercules), but not Grasse, which was then part of the department of Var as an historical part of France. In 1805, San Remo (San Rème) was included after the disbandment of the Ligurian Republic. In 1812, the department had three arrondissements with the following cantons:
* Nice, cantons: Nice (2 cantons), Aspremont, La Brigue, Menton, Monaco, Roquebillière, Saint-Sauveur-sur-Tinée, Saorge, L&#x27;Escarène, Sospel, Utelle and Villefranche-sur-Mer.
* Sanremo, cantons: Sanremo, Bordighera, Dolceacqua, Pigna, Taggia, Triora and Ventimiglia.
* Puget-Théniers, cantons: Puget-Théniers, Beuil, Gilette, Guillaumes, Roquestéron, Saint-Étienne-de-Tinée and Villars-sur-Var.
The population of the department in 1812 was 131,266, and its area was , covering both present-day Arrondissement of Nice, Principality of Monaco and Province of Imperia.

In 1814, at the close of the Napoleonic Wars, the territory was restored to the Crown of Savoy by the Congress of Vienna.

In 1860 Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, one of the architects of Italian unity with the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, negotiated support for Napoleon III in exchange for Savoy and the County of Nice as set forth in the Treaty of Turin. The annexation was confirmed on 15 and 16 April 1860 by 30,712 male electors enrolled in the 89 communes of the County of Nice who, for the first time, had universal male suffrage by plebiscite. The &quot;Yes&quot; vote for reunification with France was 83.8% of registered voters and 99.2% of votes.

The new department of Alpes-Maritimes consisted of the former County of Nice, divided into an Arrondissement of Nice and an Arrondissement of Puget-Théniers (both arrondissements existed in the former Department (1793–1814)), and a portion of the Var department, which formed the Arrondissement of Grasse. However, the County of Nice did not include Tende and La Brigue, which were still part of Piedmont-Sardinia.

For economic reasons, the Arrondissement of Puget-Théniers was merged into the Arrondissement of Nice in 1926. Since that time, the department has had two arrondissements.

In 1947, in accordance with the Treaty of Paris and as a referendum result favourable to their attachment to France, the communes of Tende and La Brigue (also parts of communes in the high valleys of Vésubie and Tinée: part the commune of Isola) which had not been ceded to France in 1860, were attached to the department.

== Administration ==
=== Politics ===

Since the end of World War II, Alpes-Maritimes has generally voted to the right. It has nine constituencies for the National Assembly. Following the 2017 legislative election, six constituencies are represented by members of The Republicans (LR) right-wing party and three by members of the La République En Marche! (REM) centrist party. Of the five members of the Senate who represent the department in the upper house of Parliament, four are right-wing (LR) and one is left-wing (Socialist Party, PS). Of the 54 departmental councillors, 52 are aligned with the right-wing coalition and two are in the left-wing opposition.

In the 2022 French presidential election, Marine Le Pen of the National Rally won a plurality in Alpes-Maritimes in the first round; incumbent Emmanuel Macron of La République En Marche! won a majority in the second round.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Alpes-Maritimes experienced corruption problems with its politicians, which led to several criminal convictions, including those of Nice Mayor Jacques Médecin and Cannes Mayor Michel Mouillot, as well as that of Antibes Mayor Pierre Merli, criminally indicted in 1995 for a real estate scam and convicted four years later.

==== Departmental Council of Alpes-Maritimes ====

The President of the Departmental Council has been Charles-Ange Ginésy since 2017, who took office upon succeeding Éric Ciotti. Ciotti remained a councillor and became majority leader. Ginésy, who has been a councillor for the canton of Vence since 2015, has held a seat in the council since 2003. He also was Mayor of Péone (2001–2017) and the MP for Alpes-Maritimes&#x27;s 2nd constituency (2005–2007; 2007–2008; 2009–2010; 2012–2017). Both are members of The Republicans (LR).

The coalition majority in the departmental council is one of the largest majorities in any such institution in France. Out of the 54 seats, only two are held by left-wing councillors, both elected in the canton of Grasse-2. In neighbouring Var, the right-wing coalition also holds all but two seats in the departmental council, although it is made up of less many seats and the two councillors in opposition are members of the far-right National Rally (RN). Following the 2021 departmental election, the seats were allocated as follows in Alpes-Maritimes:

This debt amounted to 2,460 euros per fiscal tax unit (household) and 859 euros per person. The trend of change in debt over the last decade has been a sharp increase: + 440% between 2001 and 2009 and 26% between 2009 and 2010. There was only €43 million in debt in 2003.

== Demographics ==

When Nice became part of France in 1860, it was still a small town; the department had fewer than 200,000 inhabitants. However, the population grew quickly from 300,000 at the beginning of the 20th century to over a million. The population is aging because of the number of retirees who move to the coast.

The population is now concentrated in the urban region that includes Antibes, Cannes, Grasse, Nice, and Menton, and which constitutes 90% of the total population.

The department had 1,083,310 inhabitants in 2017, making it the 20th most populated department in France. There are 163 communes including 107 under 2000 inhabitants (representing a total of 60,065 inhabitants), 38 from 2000 to 9999 inhabitants (total 171,935 inhabitants), 13 between 10,000 and 49,999 inhabitants (total 263,102 inhabitants), 4 between 50,000 and 199,999 inhabitants (Antibes, Cannes, Cagnes-sur-Mer and Grasse, total 248,191 inhabitants), and one with over 200,000 inhabitants (Nice, with 340,017 inhabitants). The population density was 252 inhabitants per square kilometre in 2017.

According to INSEE 39.5% of children born in 2011 in the department of Alpes-Maritimes have at least one parent born abroad (regardless of nationality), 15.4% have a father born in North Africa.

The area is also known for its extremely large population of people of Italian descent. About 40% of the population of the Alpes-Maritimes claim their ancestry as being solely Italian, and as many as 80% of the population can trace some degree of ancestry back to Italy before it was annexed by France in the 1860s.

== Economy ==
The economy of the Alpes-Maritimes is characterized by the importance of the tertiary sector. The department has, in addition to tourism and traditional services, a relatively high level of corporate research and higher level of services. Agriculture is of little importance and industry plays a relatively small role although it has diversified into activities with high technological value. The construction and public works sector is quite important. The economy is very sensitive to changes in the national and international situation. The rate of unemployment is 9.1%.

According to the INSEE, in 2005 the GDP per capita of the Alpes-Maritimes was 27,723 euros which ranked it as the thirteenth highest department in France. GDP was 29.6 billion euros. According to Eurostat, &quot;GDP per capita at market prices in 2008&quot;, the department had a GDP per capita of 30,700 euros, which is also ranked it thirteenth in France.

=== Distribution of employment ===
Tourism is an essential industry for the entire coastal region (Côte d&#x27;Azur) and is highly developed. On the coast, thanks to the mild climate, towns are resort destinations all year round. In the mountains, there are winter sports stations that have received abundant snow in recent years, particularly Isola 2000.

There are also well-developed industries such as the perfume industry in Grasse, new technologies from Sophia-Antipolis, and the aerospace industry in Cannes-Mandelieu, where there is the first European satellite builders and the first industrial plant dedicated to spacecraft manufacturing.

== Tourism ==
=== Seaside ===
The presence of the Mediterranean Sea and the French Alps under a mild sky has favoured one dominant activity: tourism, which accounts for 64,000 jobs directly in the Alpes-Maritimes. For only the city of Nice the tourism turnover represents a 12 to 13% share of the whole tourism market in France. The capital of the Côte d&#x27;Azur is the fifth most populous city in France. The city of Nice also has the second largest airport in France (Nice Côte d&#x27;Azur Airport), after Paris and its three airports at Roissy, Orly and Le Bourget. There are nearly 13.5 million passengers per year passing through Nice Airport.

The seaside where the majority of the population resides is one of the most popular parts of the world with many attractions:

* Convention cities that spread their business throughout the year are Cannes, with its Palais des Festivals, and Nice, with its Acropolis.

The area inland from the busy French Riviera is an excellent base for many outdoor sports: cycling, mountain biking, skiing, walking, rock climbing, canyoning, canoeing, rafting, fishing, horse riding, Adventure parks, caving and the area has the first ever underground &quot;via ferrata&quot;. The area has internationally renowned paragliding and hang gliding flying sites at Col-de-Bleyne, Gourdon, Gréolières and Lachens.

<text>The Gorgons ( ; ), in Greek mythology, are three monstrous sisters, Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa, said to be the daughters of Phorcys and Ceto. They lived near their sisters the Graeae, and were able to turn anyone who looked at them to stone. Euryale and Stheno were immortal, but Medusa was not and was slain by the hero Perseus.

Gorgons were dread monsters with terrifying eyes. A Gorgon head was displayed on Athena&#x27;s aegis, giving it the power both to protect her from any weapon, and instill great fear in any enemy. Gorgon blood was said to have both the power to heal and harm.

Representations of full-bodied Gorgons and the Gorgon face, called a gorgoneion (pl. gorgoneia), were popular subjects in Ancient Greek, Etruscan and Roman iconography. While Archaic Gorgons and gorgoneia are universally depicted as hideously ugly, over time they came to be portrayed as beautiful young women.

==Etymology==
The name &#x27;Gorgon&#x27; is associated with the Ancient Greek adjective (), which, of an eye or look, means &#x27;grim, fierce, awesome, dazzling&#x27;, and is thought to derive from the Sanskrit stem &quot;garğ&quot;. The stem has connotations of noise, and Germanic and Romance languages have many derivatives from this stem referring to the throat (e.g. &#x27;gorge&#x27;) or the guttural sounds produced in the throat (e.g. &#x27;gargle&#x27;, &#x27;gurgle&#x27;). It has been understood as meaning to growl, roar or howl, while Thalia Feldman suggests that the closest meaning for the stem might be the onomatopoeic &quot;grrr&quot; of a growling beast.

== Family ==
According to Hesiod and Apollodorus, the Gorgons were daughters of the primordial sea-god Phorcys and the sea-monster Ceto, and the sisters of three other daughters of Phorcys and Ceto, the Graeae. However, according to Hyginus, they were daughters of &quot;the Gorgon&quot;, an offspring of Typhon and Echidna, and Ceto, while Euripides, in his tragedy &quot;Ion&quot;, has &quot;the Gorgon&quot; being the offspring of Gaia, spawned by Gaia to be an ally for her children the Giants in their war against the Olympian gods. Medusa had two offspring by Poseidon, the winged-horse Pegasus and the warrior Chrysaor.

== Mythology ==
===Dwelling place===
Where the Gorgons were supposed to live varies in the ancient sources. According to Hesiod, the Gorgons lived far to the west beyond Oceanus (the Titan, and world-circling river) near its springs, at the edge of night where the Hesperides (and the Graeae?) live. The &quot;Cypria&quot; apparently had the Gorgons living in Oceanus on a rocky island named Sarpedon. Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; places them in the far east &quot;across the surging sea&quot; on the &quot;Gorgonean plains of Cisthene&quot;, where the Graeae live, while his lost play &quot;Phorkides&quot; (another name for the Graeae) apparently placed them at &quot;Lake Tritonis&quot;, a mythological lake set somewhere in westernmost North Africa. And the fifth-century BC poet Pindar has Perseus, apparently on his quest for the Gorgon head, visit the Hyperboreans (usually considered to dwell in the far north). However, whether Pindar means to imply that the Gorgons lived near the Hyperboreans is unclear.

===Petrification===
Pherecydes notes that Medusa&#x27;s face turned men to stone, and Pindar describes Medusa&#x27;s severed head as &quot;stony death&quot;. In &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, it says that no mortal can look at them and live. According to Apollodorus, all three of the Gorgons could turn to stone anyone who saw them.

===Perseus===

Stheno and Euryale were immortal, whereas Medusa was mortal. According to Apollodorus&#x27; version of their story, Perseus was ordered by Polydectes (his enemy) to bring back the head of Medusa. So guided by Hermes and Athena, he sought out the sisters of the Gorgons, the Graeae who had only one eye and one tooth which they shared. Perseus managed to steal their eye and tooth, and refused to return them, unless they would show him the way to the nymphs, which they did. Perseus got from the nymphs, winged sandals, which allowed him to fly, and the cap of Hades, which made him invisible. He also received an adamantine sickle (&quot;harpē&quot;) from Hermes. Perseus then flew to Oceanus, found the Gorgons asleep. And when Perseus managed to behead Medusa by looking at her reflection in his bronze shield, Pegasus and Chrysaor sprang from Medusa&#x27;s neck, and Stheno and Euryale chased after him, but were unable to see him because he was wearing Hades&#x27; cap of invisibility. When Perseus brought back the Gorgon head, as ordered, with averted eyes he showed the head to Polydectes who was turned to stone. Perseus returned the things he had acquired from the nymphs and Hermes, but gave the Gorgon head to Athena.

===Athena&#x27;s Gorgon aegis===
According to Apollodorus, after Perseus gave the Gorgon head to Athena, she &quot;inserted the Gorgon&#x27;s head in the middle of her shield&quot;, apparently a reference to Athena&#x27;s aegis. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the aegis is a device, usually associated with Athena, which was decorated with a Gorgon head. Athena wore it in battle as a shield which neither Apollo&#x27;s spear, or even Zeus&#x27; thunderbolt could pierce. According to the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Hephaestus made the aegis for Zeus, while according to a Hesiod fragment, Metis made it for Athena, before Athena was born.

However, Euripides, in his tragedy &quot;Ion&quot;, has a character say that Athena&#x27;s aegis was made from the skin of the Gorgon, the offspring of Gaia, who Gaia had brought forth as an ally for her children the Giants and who Athena had killed during the Gigantomachy. In the same play, Euripides has Creusa describe a weaving she made &quot;like an aegis, bordered with serpents&quot; with a &quot;Gorgon in the middle&quot;. He also mentions Athena&#x27;s &quot;Gorgon-faced shield&quot; in his tragedy &quot;Electra&quot;.

In vase-painting, Athena is often shown wearing her aegis, fringed with snake-heads.

===Gorgon blood===
In some accounts, the blood of &quot;the Gorgon&quot; (any Gorgon?) was said to have both the power to heal and harm. According to Euripides&#x27; &quot;Ion&quot;, Athena gave two drops of blood from the Gorgon she slew for her aegis to Erichthonius, one of which &quot;wards off diseases and nourishes life&quot;, while the other &quot;kills, as it is poison from the Gorgon serpents&quot;. While according to Apollodorus, Athena gave Asclepius some of the blood the Gorgon, &quot;and while he used the blood that flowed from the veins on the left side for the bane of mankind, he used the blood that flowed from the right side for salvation, and by that means he raised the dead.&quot;

===Gorgon cry===
The loud cry that came from the Gorgons—perhaps related to &#x27;Gorgon&#x27; being derived from the Sanskrit &quot;garğ&quot;, with its connotations of a growling beast—was also part of their mythology.

The Hesiodic &quot;Shield of Heracles&quot; (c. late seventh–mid-sixth century BC), which describes Heracles&#x27; shield, has the Gorgons depicted on it chasing Perseus, with their shrill cry seemingly being heard emanating from the shield itself:
Pindar tells us that the cry of the Gorgons, lamenting the death of Medusa during their pursuit of Perseus, was the reason Athena invented the flute. According to Pindar, the goddess:
Nonnus, in his &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, also has the fleeing Perseus &quot;listening for no trumpet but Euryale&#x27;s bellowing&quot;. The desire to evoke this Gorgon cry may account for the typical distended mouth seen in Archaic Gorgon iconography.

==Literary descriptions==
The earliest literary accounts of Gorgons occur in works by Hesiod and Homer (c. 700–650 BC). Hesiod provides no physical description of the Gorgons, other than to say that the two Gorgons, Sthenno, and Euryale did not grow old. Homer mentions only &quot;the Gorgon&quot; (otherwise unnamed) giving brief descriptions of her, and her head. In the &quot;Iliad&quot; she is called a &quot;dread monster&quot; and the image of her head, which appears—along with several other terrifying images—on Athena&#x27;s aegis, and Agamemnon&#x27;s shield, is described as &quot;dread and awful&quot;, and &quot;grim of aspect, glaring terribly&quot;. Already in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the Gorgon&#x27;s &quot;glaring&quot; eyes were a notably fearsome feature. As Hector pursues the fleeing Achaeans, &quot;exulting in his might&quot; ... ever slaying the hindmost&quot;, Homer describes the Trojan hero as having eyes like &quot;the eyes of the Gorgon&quot;. And in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Odysseus, although determined &quot;steadfastly&quot; to stay in the underworld, so as to meet other great men among the dead, is seized by such fear at the mere thought that he might encounter there the &quot;head of the Gorgon, that awful monster&quot;, leaves &quot;straightway&quot;.

The Hesiodic &quot;Shield&quot; describes the Gorgons chasing Perseus as being &quot;dreadful and unspeakable&quot; with two snakes wrapped around their waists, and that &quot;upon the terrible heads of the Gorgons rioted great Fear&quot;, perhaps a reference to snakes writhing about their heads. Pindar makes snakes for hair explicit, saying that Perseus&#x27; Gorgon head &quot;shimmered with hair made of serpents&quot;, and that the Gorgons chasing Perseus also had &quot;horrible snaky hair&quot;, so too in &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; where all three Gorgons are described as &quot;winged&quot; as well as &quot;snake-haired&quot;. The Gorgon&#x27;s reputation for ugliness was such that the Athenian comic playwright Aristophones could, in 405 BC, ridicule the women of the Athenian deme Teithras by referring to them as Gorgons.

The mythographer Apollodorus gives the most detailed description:
While such descriptions emphasize the hideous physical features of the Gorgon, by the fifth century BC, Pindar can also describe his snake-haired Medusa as &quot;beautiful&quot;. And the Roman poet Ovid tells us that Medusa was originally a beautiful maiden, but because of a sexual encounter with Neptune (the Roman equivalent of the Greek Poseidon) in Minerva&#x27;s temple (Minerva being the Roman equivalent of the Greek Athena), Minerva punished Medusa by transforming her beautiful hair into horrible snakes.

==Iconography==

Gorgons were a popular subject in ancient Greek, Etruscan and Roman art, with over six hundred representations cataloged in the &quot;Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae&quot; (&quot;LIMC&quot;). In addition to the many examples found on vase paintings, Gorgons occur in a wide variety of other contexts, including architectural ornamentation, shield devices, and coins. Some representations show full-bodied Gorgons, while others, called gorgoneia, show only the face (or head) of a Gorgon, such as those described in the &quot;Iliad&quot; as appearing on Athena&#x27;s aegis, and Agamemnon&#x27;s shield. The earliest representations of both types are found from roughly the same time period, the mid-seventh century BC.

Archaic Gorgons typically have snaky hair either with snake-like curls (Figs. 8, 9), or actual snakes protruding from their heads (Figs. 2, 5, 6, 10). The faces of Archaic Gorgons are particularly distinctive, typically with large menacing eyes, tripartite scroll-like (volute) noses, wide mouths with rictus-like grins or grimaces, lolling tongues, fangs and/or tusks (Figs. 4, 5, 6), and sometimes beards (Figs. 3, 4, 13, 15). Aside from its particular monstrousness, the most distinctive feature of archaic representations of Gorgons is that the head is always facing frontally (en face) with its large fierce eyes glaring directly at the viewer.

Consistent with the change in literary descriptions seen in the works of Pindar and Ovid mentioned above, beginning in the fifth century BC, representations of Gorgons and gorgoneia transition from hideous monsters to beautiful young women, with such representations becoming typical in the fourth century BC. One of the earliest such &quot;beautiful&quot; Gorgons (mid-fifth century BC) is a red-figure pelike (Fig. 11), which shows Perseus, with head turned away, about to behead a sleeping Medusa. While gorgoneia continue to be ubiquitous through the end of antiquity, after the fourth century BC full-bodied Gorgons ceased to be represented.

===Full-bodied Gorgons===
Full-bodied Gorgons are usually shown in connection with the Perseus-Medusa story. The earliest representations (mid-seventh century BC) of such Gorgons are a Boeotian relief pithos (Fig. 1), which depicts Perseus, with head turned away, decapitating a Gorgon, and the Eleusis Amphora (Fig. 2), which shows two Gorgons chasing Perseus fleeing with a severed Gorgon head. That the Perseus on the pithos averts his gaze shows that already in these earliest images it was understood that looking directly at the Gorgon&#x27;s face was deadly. Of particular interest is the famous Medusa pediment (early sixth century BC) from the temple of Artemis in Corfu (Fig. 6), which shows a winged-Medusa in the characteristic &quot;Knielauf&quot; (kneeling-running) position, with two snakes wrapped around her waist, like the Gorgons described in the Hesiodic &quot;Shield of Heracles&quot;.

Although the Gorgon being beheaded on the Boeotian pithos is depicted as a female centaur, with neither wings nor snakes present, and the Gorgons on the Eleusis Amphora, have wingless, wasp-shaped bodies with cauldron-like heads, by the end of the seventh century BC, humanoid bodies, with wings, and snakes around their head, necks, or waist, such as depicted on the Medusa pediment, become typical. Unlike the depictions of gods and heroes, which are usually shown in profile, Archaic Gorgons, even when their bodies are presented in profile (usually running), their heads are (as noted above) always turned frontally displaying their full face, directly gazing at the viewer.

===Gorgoneia===
Of the depictions of ancient Greek demons, the gorgoneion is, by far, the most frequently occurring. Thought to have had an apotropaic (protective) function, gorgoneia are often found on architectural elements such as temple pediments, and ornamental antefixes and acroteria, or decorating various round objects, such as shields, coins, and the bottoms of bowls and cups. As with full-bodied Gorgons the earliest representations are found from the mid-sixth century BC. The earliest example of a &quot;beautiful&quot; gorgoneion is the Medusa Rondanini (Fig. 19), which is thought to be a Roman copy of a Greek original dated to either the fifth-century BC or the Hellenistic period.

Athena&#x27;s victory over the Giant Enceladus—with a gorgoneion on her shield—was apparently depicted on the Temple of Apollo at Delphi (latter part of the sixth century BC). In Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Ion&quot; (c. 412–412 BC), the Chorus describes seeing, on the temple&#x27;s stone walls, Athena &quot;brandishing her gorgon shield&quot; against Enceladus. Pausanias describes seeing a votive golden shield dedicated by the Spartans and their allies after the Battle of Tanagra (457 BC), with a gorgoneion (or possibly a full-bodied Gorgon) depicted in relief being displayed at the Temple of Zeus at Olympia.

==Possible origins==
There has been considerable and wide-ranging speculation concerning the possible origins of the story of Perseus and the Gorgons, as well as gorgoneia, the representations of Gorgon faces. The origins of the Perseus-Gorgon story, and gorgoneia, even with respect to each other, are uncertain. The Perseus-Gorgon story might have come first inspiring the development of gorgoneia, or gorgoneia might have come first, in which case the Perseus story might have served an etiological function, as an origin myth, developed as a way to explain where gorgoneia had come from. It is also possible that the Perseus story and gorgoneia developed independently, but later converged. Since the earliest literary and iconographic evidence of both the Perseus story and gorgoneia are roughly contemporaneous, such evidence seems unable to definitively distinguish between any of these three scenarios.

It is possible that the mythology and/or the iconography of Gorgons were subject to Near-Eastern influence. In particular elements of full-bodied Gorgon iconography seem to have been borrowed from that of the Mesopotamian Lamashtu. Mesopotamian depictions of Gilgamesh slaying Humbaba, may have influenced the Perseus-Gorgon story, while gorgoneia may be connected to images of Humbaba.

===Perseus and the Gorgons===
The Gorgon as Mistress of Animals, in the Medusa pediment from the temple of Artemis in Corfu (Fig. 6) shows affinities with images of Lamashtu. As Walter Burkert has noted, Lamashtu has several characteristic iconographic elements which include an animalistic head atop a humanoid body, often in the &quot;Knielauf&quot; (kneeling-running) position, with the presence of snakes, a horse or ass, animal offspring, and sometimes in the Mistress of Animals configuration. All of these elements are present, for example, in the Medusa pediment.

Images which show Perseus, with head turned away, decapitating Medusa (Figs. 1, 7), resemble Mesopotamian depictions of Gilgamesh slaying the wild man Humbaba. Such depictions can show Gilgamesh with head turned away looking behind him for a goddess to pass him a weapon. In particular, a bronze shield strap from Olympia (mid-sixth century BC), which shows Perseus with his head turned away about to decapitate Medusa, assisted by Athena, bears a striking resemblance to a seal impression from Nuzi c. 1450 BC. This suggests the possibility that Greeks misinterpreted or reinterpreted these Mesopotamian images, giving rise, through a process that Burkert has described as a &quot;creative misunderstanding&quot;, to the myth of the Gorgon&#x27;s petrifying gaze.

===The gorgoneion===

The consensus among classical scholars seems to be that the function of a gorgoneion was apotropaic, as a device (an &quot;apotropaion&quot;) to ward away unwanted things, and which was in origin a dancer-worn mask. The classic formulation of this view is that of Jane Ellen Harrison, the gorgoneion as a &quot;ritual mask misunderstood&quot;:

That gorgoneia were used as apotropaic shield devices, at least, seems evident from Agamemnon&#x27;s gorgoneion-shield, which Homer describes in the &quot;Iliad&quot; as displaying &quot;the Gorgon, grim of aspect, glaring terribly, and about her were Terror and Rout&quot;. Supporting the view that gorgoneia originated as masks, are two groups of seventh-century BC terracotta gorgonion-like masks: a group of wearable helmet masks from Tiryns, and another group of non-wearable votive masks from the Sanctuary of Orthia at Sparta, which share some features with the typical earliest representations of Gorgon faces. If such masks were in fact intended to represent the face of a Gorgon, then they would show that Gorgons or gorgoneia played a role in some kind of ritualistic or dramatic practice or performance.

The gorgonesque votive masks from Sparta have deep S-shaped furrows on either side of wide-mouthed grimaces. Such features resemble those on the much earlier terracotta plaques depicting Humbaba.

<doc id="80991" wikidata="Q132239" url="?curid=80991" title="Citrullus">
<text>Citrullus is a genus of seven species of desert vines, among which &quot;Citrullus lanatus&quot; (the watermelon) is an important crop.

==Taxonomy==
Molecular data, including sequences from the original collection of &quot;Momordica lanata&quot; made near Cape Town by C. P. Thunberg in 1773, show that what Thunberg collected is not what has been called &quot;Citrullus lanatus&quot;, the domesticated watermelon, since the 1930s. Although this error only occurred in 1930 (Bailey, Gentes Herbarum 2: 180–186), it has been perpetuated in hundreds of papers on the watermelon. In addition, there is an older name for the watermelon, &quot;Citrullus battich&quot; , which would normally have the precedence over &quot;Momordica lanata&quot; . To solve this problem, it has been proposed to conserve the name &quot;Citrullus lanatus&quot; with a new type to preserve the current sense of the name 

===Species===
&quot;Citrullus&quot; consists of the following species and subspecies:

*&quot;Citrullus amarus&quot; – citron melon
*&quot;Citrullus colocynthis&quot; – colocynth
*&quot;Citrullus ecirrhosus&quot; – tendril-less melon
*&quot;Citrullus lanatus&quot; – desert watermelon
**&quot;Citrullus lanatus&quot; subsp. &quot;vulgaris&quot; var. &quot;cordophanus&quot; 
**&quot;Citrullus lanatus&quot; var. &quot;lanatus&quot;
*&quot;Citrullus mucosospermus&quot; – egusi melon
*&quot;Citrullus naudinianus&quot; 
*&quot;Citrullus rehmii&quot;

<doc id="80993" wikidata="Q232909" url="?curid=80993" title="Luffa">
<text>Luffa is a genus of tropical and subtropical vines in the pumpkin, squash and gourd family (Cucurbitaceae).

In everyday non-technical usage, the luffa, also spelled loofah or less frequently loofa, usually refers to the fruits of the species &quot;Luffa aegyptiaca&quot; and &quot;Luffa acutangula&quot;. It is cultivated and eaten as a vegetable, but must be harvested at a young stage of development to be edible. The vegetable is popular in India, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Vietnam. When the fruit fully ripens, it becomes too fibrous for eating. The fully developed fruit is the source of the loofah scrubbing sponge.

==Names==
The name &quot;luffa&quot; was taken by European botanists in the 17th century from the Arabic name &quot;lūf&quot;.

In North America it is sometimes known as &quot;Chinese okra&quot;, and in Spanish as &quot;estropajo&quot;.

==Uses==
===Fibers===

The fruit section of &quot;L. aegyptiaca&quot; may be allowed to mature and used as a bath or kitchen sponge after being processed to remove everything except the network of xylem fibers. If the loofah is allowed to fully ripen and then dried on the vine, the flesh disappears, leaving only the fibrous skeleton and seeds, which can be easily shaken out. Marketed as &quot;luffa&quot; or &quot;loofah&quot;, the sponge is used as a body scrub in the shower.

In Paraguay, panels are made out of luffa combined with other vegetable matter and recycled plastic. These can be used to create furniture and construct houses.

===Food===
Luffa is a popular food item. There are various ways to prepare it including in soups or stir frys.

The luffa sponge is a biological cellular material. These materials often exhibit exceptional mechanical properties at low densities. While their mechanical performance tends to fall behind manmade materials, such as alloys, ceramics, plastics, and composites, as a structural material, they have long term sustainability for the natural environment. When compressed longitudinally, a luffa sponge is able to absorb comparable energy per unit mass as aluminum foam. Luffa sponges are composed of a complex network of fiber bundles connected to form a 3-dimensional, highly-porous network.

The hierarchical structure of luffa sponges results in mechanical properties that vary with the component of sponge tested. Specifically, the mechanical properties of fiber bundles differ from those of blocks from the bulk of the sponge, which differ from those of the cross sections of the entire sponge.

===Fiber-bundles===
Uniaxial tensile tests of fiber bundles isolated from the inner surface provide insight this basic strut element of the luffa sponges. These fiber bundles vary in diameter from 0.3 to 0.5 mm. Each fiber bundle has a low density core region not occupied by fibers. The stress-strain response of the fiber bundles is nearly linear elastic all the way until fracture, suggesting the absence of work hardening. The slope of the linear region of the stress-strain curve, or Young’s modulus, is 236* MPa. The highest stress achieved before fracture, or ultimate tensile strength, is 103 MPa. The strain at which failure occurs, or failure strain, is small at only 5%. The mechanical properties of fiber bundles decrease dramatically when the size of the hollow region inside the bundle increases. Despite their low tensile strength, the fiber bundles have a high specific modulus of 2.07– 4.05 MPa⋅m3/kg, and their overall properties are improved when a high ratio of their cross sectional area is occupied by fibers, they are evenly distributed, and there is strong adhesion between fibers.

===Bulk-sponge===

Block samples (height: 12.69 ± 2.35mm, width: 11.30 ± 2.88mm, length: 13.10 ± 2.64mm) cut from the core region and hoop region of the luffa sponge exhibit different mechanical behaviors under compression depending on both the orientation they are loaded in as well as the location in the sponge they are sampled from. The hoop region consists of the section of sponge located around the outside between the inner and outer surfaces, while the core region is from the sponge center. Samples from both the hoop and core regions exhibited yielding when compressed in the longitudinal direction due to the buckling of fibers. With the highly aligned fibers from the inner surface removed from the hoop region block samples, this yield behavior disappears. In general, the inner surface fibers most significantly impact the longitudinal properties of the luffa sponge column followed by the circumferential properties. There is no noticeable contribution to the radial properties. Additionally, the core region exhibits lower yield stress and energy absorption (as determined by the area under the stress-strain curve) compared to the hoop region due to its greater porosity.

Overall, the stress-strain curves of block samples exhibit three stages of mechanical behavior common to porous materials. Namely, the samples follow linear elasticity for strains less than 10%, followed by a plateau for strains from 10% to 60%, and finally a stress increase associated with densification at strains greater than 60%. Segment samples created from cross sections of the entire luffa sponge (diameter: 92.51 ± 6.15mm, height: 19.76 ± 4.95mm) when tested in compression exhibit this same characteristic behavior. The three stages can be described by the equations:

# Linear elasticity region: formula_1 for formula_2
# Plateau region: formula_3 for formula_4
# Densification region: formula_5 for formula_6 

In the above equations, formula_7 is the Young&#x27;s modulus and formula_8 the yield strength of the sponge material. These are chosen to best fit experimental data. The strain at the elastic limit, where the plateau region begins, is denoted as formula_9, while the strain at the onset of the densification region is formula_10.

formula_11

Here formula_12 is the density of the bulk sponge formula_13 is the density of its constituent, the fiber bundle. The constant D defines the strain at the onset of densification as well as the stress relationship in the densification region. It is determined by fitting experimental data.

===Dynamic loading===
The mechanical properties of Luffa sponges change under different strain rates. Specifically, energy adsorption, compressive stress, and plateau stress (which is in the case of foam materials corresponds to the yield stress) are enhanced by increasing the strain rate. One explanation for this is that the luffa fibers undergo more axial deformation when dynamically loaded (high strain rates) than when quasi-statically loaded (low strain rates).

<text>In Greek mythology, Iolaus (; Ancient Greek: Ἰόλαος &quot;Iólāos&quot;) was a Theban divine hero. He was famed for being Heracles&#x27; charioteer and squire, and for helping with some of his Labors, as well as for being one of the Argonauts.

== Family ==
Iolaus was the son of Iphicles and Automedusa, daughter of King Alcathous of Megara. He married Megara, and through her became the father of Leipephilene. Through this daughter, Iolaus was considered to have fathered the mythic and historic line of the kings of Corinth, ending with Telestes.

== Mythology ==

=== Relationship with Heracles ===
Iolaus often acted as Heracles&#x27; charioteer and companion. Plutarch, describing the Theban Sacred Band in his life of Pelopidas, said &quot;It is a tradition likewise that Iolaus, who assisted Hercules in his labours and fought at his side, was beloved of him; and Aristotle observes that, even in his time, lovers plighted their faith at Iolaus&#x27;s tomb.&quot;

=== Adventures ===
Iolaus provided essential help to Heracles in his battle against the Hydra, his second labor. Seeing that Heracles was being overwhelmed by the multi-headed monster (the Lernaean Hydra), who grew two heads in place of each one cut off, Iolaus helped by cauterizing each neck as Heracles beheaded it.

Heracles gave his wife, Megara, age thirty three, to Iolaus, then only sixteen years old – ostensibly because the sight of her reminded him of his murder of their three children. They had a daughter, Leipephilene. He was one of the Heraclidae.

In Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Philoctetes&quot;, Philoctetes was given Heracles&#x27; bow and arrow as reward for lighting the funeral pyre.

According to Diodorus Siculus, Iolaus was sent by Heracles to Sardinia, together with nine of the sons that he had with the fifty daughters of Thespius (the Thespiades), to colonize the island, giving rise to the Iolei people.

Iolaus and the Thespians were buried in Sardinia.

Aristotle said that Sardinia had practiced the rite of incubation, which is the liberation ritual of the people who were affected by nightmares and obsessions. These rituals included that the persons suffering from nightmares should sleep next to the tombs of heroes.

Simplicius of Cilicia adds, in the eight books of the Commentaries Aristotle, that &quot;the places where they were deposited and preserved corpses of the nine heroes that Heracles got from the Thespians and who came to Sardinia with the colony of Iolaus, became the famous oracles.&quot;

Solinus says: &quot;The Iolians, so named by him (Iolaus), added a temple to his tomb, because he had freed Sardinia from many ills&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The Theban gymnasium was named after Iolaus because it was next to his tomb and the Heracleia, an annual festival in honor of Heracles, was held there, hence also known as &quot;Iolaeia&quot;, &quot;Iolaia&quot; or &quot;Iolaea&quot; (), an athletic festival consisting of gymnastic and equestrian events. The victors at the &quot;Iolaea&quot; were crowned with garlands of myrtle.

A genus of Lycaenid butterfly has been named after him.

An exoplanet around star HAT-P-42 (now named Lerna) is named after him as part of the IAU&#x27;s NameExoWorlds project.

<text>The Symplegades (; , &quot;Symplēgádes&quot;), also known as Clashing Rocks or Cyanean Rocks (Κυανέαι), were, according to Greek mythology, a pair of rocks at the Bosphorus that clashed together whenever a vessel went through. They were defeated by Jason and the Argonauts, who would have been lost and killed by the rocks except for Phineus&#x27;s advice. Jason let a dove fly between the rocks to see exactly how fast they&#x27;d have to row to beat the rocks; the dove lost only its tail feathers. The Argonauts rowed mightily to get through and lost only part of the stern ornament. After that, the Symplegades stopped moving permanently.
The European rock is usually identified with an islet, about wide and long, which stands about off the shore of a village called Rumelifeneri (&#x27;Lighthouse of Rumeli&#x27;), and is connected to it by a modern concrete jetty. At its highest point, there is an ancient altar known as the Pillar of Pompey, though it has nothing to do with Pompey. Dionysius of Byzantium mentions a Roman shrine to Apollo on one of the Cyanean Rocks, and the 16th-century French traveller Petrus Gyllius thought the altar was a remnant of that shrine.

The Asian rock is probably a reef off the Yum Burnu (north of Anadolu Feneri &#x27;Lighthouse of Anatolia&#x27;), described by Gyllius:

The reef is divided into four rocks above water which, however, are joined below; it is separated from the continent by a narrow channel filled with many stones, by which as by a staircase one can cross the channel with dry feet when the sea is calm; but when the sea is rough, waves surround the four rocks into which I said the reef is divided. Three of these are low and more or less submerged, but the middle one is higher than the European rock, sloping up to an acute point and roundish right up to its summit; it is splashed by the waves but not submerged and is everywhere precipitous and straight.
==Names==
The Romans called them &quot;Cyaneae Insulae&quot; (&quot;Blue Islands&quot;), and in Turkish they are called &quot;Öreke Taşı&quot; (&quot;Distaff Rock&quot; or &quot;Midwife&#x27;s Stool&quot;).

==In literature==
Lord Byron refers to the Symplegades in the concluding stanzas of &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;:
The New Critic I. A. Richards refers to &#x27;Symplegades&#x27; in his work Practical Criticism. In Chapter 2, &#x27;Figurative Language&#x27;, he refers to dangers of misinterpretation in reading poems:
&quot;These twin dangers - careless, &#x27;intuitive&#x27; reading and prosaic, &#x27;over-literal&#x27; reading - are the Symplegades, the &#x27;justling rocks&#x27;, between which too many ventures into poetry are wrecked.&quot;

In his 1961 novel &quot;Jason&quot;, Henry Treece depicts the Symplegades as icebergs that drifted downriver into the Black Sea.

==The Wandering Rocks==

The Symplegades are sometimes identified with (or confused with) the Planctae () or Wandering Rocks, which are mentioned in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; and Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27; &quot;Argonautica&quot;. In Apollonius&#x27;s telling, the Symplegades were encountered on the way to the Golden Fleece and the Planctae were encountered on the return voyage.

The similarities and differences between the Wandering Rocks and the Symplegades have been much debated by scholars, as have potential locations for them. (See also Geography of the Odyssey.)

<text>In Greek mythology, Iphicles ( or ; &quot;Iphiklēs&quot;), also called Iphiclus, was the maternal half-brother of Heracles and one of the Calydonian boar hunters.

== Family ==
Iphicles was the son of Alcmene and her human husband Amphitryon, whereas Heracles was her son by Zeus. He also had a sister, Laonome, who married Euphemus or Polyphemus. Iphicles was the father of Heracles&#x27; charioteer Iolaus by his first wife, Automedusa, daughter of Alcathous. Afterwards, he fathered two children by Pyrrha, the younger daughter of Creon.

== Mythology ==
Iphicles was one night younger than his half-brother Heracles, who strangled the snakes which had been sent by Hera or by Amphitryon, and at which Iphicles was frightened. Iphicles grew into a strong man but could not match his famous brother. When Heracles was made insane once again by Hera, the hero threw into the fire his brother&#x27;s two offspring by Pyrrha, who perished as a result.

Nevertheless, Iphicles went with Heracles on a punitive expedition against Troy, because King Laomedon refused to give Heracles the mares he had promised him before. Arriving in Troy, Iphicles and Telamon were sent by Heracles to the city to claim the mares, but they were thrown into prison by Laomedon. But Priam, the son of the king, disagreed with the decision of his father, sent two swords to the two heroes, and revealed the plans that Laomedon had for Heracles. As soon as Iphicles and Telamon heard this they killed their guards with the swords and returned to Heracles for the plans of Laomedon to be revealed. Then Heracles and his men went to the king and eventually slew him.

When Heracles ended his twelve labours, King Eurystheus accused him of killing him from the throne, and ordered that he, together with Alcmene and Iphicles, leave Tiryns. This is how Iphicles ended up in Arcadia where he joined Heracles on a punitive expedition against Hippocoon of Sparta. In the ensuing battle, Iphicles was killed and Heracles was inconsolable over the death of his half-brother, and voluntarily went into exile to another city.

In some accounts, Iphicles fought in the first battle of Heracles against the Eleans and Augeas, and was wounded by the Molionides of Elis. In a fainting condition, Iphicles was carried by his relatives to Pheneus, home of his grandmother Laonome, where he was carefully nursed by Buphagus, a citizen of Pheneus, and by his wife Promne. They buried him when he died of his wound and was honoured with a heroum.

<doc id="81003" wikidata="Q1345963" url="?curid=81003" title="Enyalius">
<text>Enyalius or Enyalios (Greek: ) in Greek mythology is generally a son of Ares by Enyo and also a byname of Ares the god of war. Though Enyalius as a by-name of Ares is the most accepted version, in Mycenaean times Ares and Enyalius were considered separate deities. Enyalius is often seen as the God of soldiers and warriors from Ares cult. On the Mycenaean Greek Linear B KN V 52 tablet, the name , &quot;e-nu-wa-ri-jo&quot;, has been interpreted to refer to this same Enyalios. It has been suggested that the name of Enyalius ultimately represents an Anatolian loanword, although alternative hypotheses treat it as an inherited Indo-European compound or a borrowing from an indigenous language of Crete. 

Enyalios is mentioned nine times in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and in four of them it is in the same formula describing Meriones who is one of the leaders of warriors from Crete. Homer calls Ares by the epithet &quot;Enyalios&quot; in &quot;Iliad&quot;, book xx.

A scholiast on Homer declares that the poet Alcman sometimes identified Ares with Enyalius and sometimes differentiated him, and that Enyalius was sometimes made the son of Ares by Enyo and sometimes the son of Cronus and Rhea.

Aristophanes (in &quot;Peace&quot;) envisages Ares and Enyalios as separate gods of war.

In the Anabasis, Xenophon mentions that the Greek mercenaries raise a war cry to Enyalios as they charge at the Persian Army. 

In &quot;Argonautica&quot; book III, lines 363–367, Jason sets the chthonic earthborn warriors fighting among themselves by hurling a boulder in their midst:

But Jason called to mind the counsels of Medea full of craft, and seized from the plain a huge round boulder, a terrible quoit of Ares Enyalius; four stalwart youths could not have raised it from the ground even a little.

The urbane Alexandrian author gives his old tale a touch of appropriate Homeric antiquity by using such an ancient epithet.

Plutarch, in &quot;Moralia&quot; (2nd century), tells of the bravery of the women of Argos, in the 5th century BC, who repulsed the attacks of kings of Sparta. The survivors erected a temple to Ares Enyalius by the road where they fell:

After the city was saved, they buried the women who had fallen in battle by the Argive road, and as a memorial to the achievements of the women who were spared they dedicated a temple to Ares Enyalius... Up to the present day they celebrate the Festival of Impudence (&quot;Hybristika&quot;) on the anniversary [of the battle], putting the women into men&#x27;s tunics and cloaks and the men in women&#x27;s dresses and head-coverings.

According to Pausanias (3.15.7), the Lacedaemonians believed that by chaining up Enyalius, they would prevent the god from deserting Sparta. Pausanias also mentions at 3.14.9 and 3.20.2 that puppies were sacrificed to Enyalius in Sparta.

Polybius&#x27; history renders the Roman god Mars by Greek Ares but the Roman god Quirinus by Enyalius, and the same identifications are made by later writers such as Dionysius of Halicarnassus, perhaps only because it made sense that a Roman god who was sometimes confounded with Mars and sometimes differentiated should be represented in Greek by a name that was similarly sometimes equated with Ares (who definitely corresponded with Mars) and was sometimes differentiated.

Josephus in his &quot;Antiquities&quot; 4, (3)[115] states after telling the story of the Tower of Babel:

But as to the plan of Shinar, in the country of Babylonia, Hestiaeus mentions it, when he says thus: &quot;Such of the priests as were saved, took the sacred vessels of Zeus Enyalius, and came to Shinar of Babylonia.&quot;

<text>In Greek mythology, Tithonus ( or ; ) was the lover of Eos, Goddess of the Dawn. He was a prince of Troy, the son of King Laomedon by the Naiad Strymo (). The mythology reflected by the fifth-century vase-painters of Athens envisaged Tithonus as a &quot;rhapsode&quot;, as attested by the lyre in his hand, on an oinochoe (wine jug) of the Achilles Painter, &quot;circa&quot; 470–460 BC.

An asteroid (6998) has been named after Tithonus.

==Etymology==
Tithonus has been taken by the allegorist to mean ‘a grant of a stretching-out’ (from &quot;teinō&quot; and &quot;ōnė&quot;), a reference to the stretching-out of his life, at Eos’s plea; but it is likely, rather, to have been a masculine form of Eos’s own name, Titonë – from &quot;titō&quot;, ‘day and onë, ‘queen’ – and to have meant ‘partner of the Queen of Day’.

==Mythology==

Eos is said to have taken Tithonus, from the royal house of Troy, to be her lover. The myth of Eos and Tithonus&#x27; love was known to Homer, who wrote that in the morning Eos rose from the bed she shared with Tithonus in order to give her light to mankind.

The mytheme of the goddess&#x27; mortal lover is an archaic one; when a role for Zeus was inserted, a bitter twist appeared: according to the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, when Eos asked Zeus to make Tithonus immortal, she forgot to ask that he be granted eternal youth. Tithonus indeed lived forever,
but when loathsome old age pressed full upon him, and he could not move nor lift his limbs, this seemed to her in her heart the best counsel: she laid him in a room and put to the shining doors. There he babbles endlessly, and no more has strength at all, such as once he had in his supple limbs.

In later tellings, he eventually became a cicada (&quot;tettix&quot;), eternally living, but begging for death to overcome him. In the Olympian system, the &quot;queenly&quot; and &quot;golden-throned&quot; Eos can no longer grant immortality to her lover as Selene had done, but must ask it of Zeus, as a boon. In the account of Hieronymus of Rhodes from the third century BC, the blame is shifted from Eos onto Tithonus, who asked for immortality but not agelessness from his lover, who was then unable to help him otherwise and turned him into a cicada. Propertius wrote that Eos did not forsake Tithonus, old and aged as he was, and would still embrace him and hold him in her arms rather than leaving him deserted in his cold chamber, while cursing the gods for his cruel fate.

This myth might have been used to explain why cicadas were particularly noisy during the early hours of the morning, when the dawn appears in the sky. Sir James George Frazer notes that among ancient Greeks and several other peoples there was a widespread belief that creatures that can shed their skin renew their youth and live forever. It might also be a reference to the fact that the high-pitched talk of old men was compared to the cicadas&#x27; singing, as seen in a passage from the &quot;Iliad&quot;. In fact the ancient Greeks would use a cicada sitting on a harp as an emblem of music.

Eos bore Tithonus two sons, Memnon and Emathion. According to Quintus Smyrnaeus, Memnon was raised by the Hesperides on the coast of Oceanus. According to the historian Diodorus Siculus, Tithonus, who had travelled east from Troy into Assyria and founded Susa, was bribed with a golden grapevine to send his son Memnon to fight at Troy against the Greeks.

The Tithonus poem is one of the few nearly complete works of the Greek lyric poet Sappho, having been pieced together from fragments discovered over a period of more than a hundred years.
Eos (as Thesan) and Tithonus (as Tinthu or Tinthun) provided a pictorial motif inscribed or cast in low relief on the backs of Etruscan bronze hand-mirrors.

==In modern culture==
* Tithonus as an aged immortal is mentioned in Book I, Canto II, Stanza VII of Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;.
* &quot;Tithonus&quot; by Alfred Tennyson was originally written as &quot;Tithon&quot; in 1833 and completed in 1859. The poem is a dramatic monologue in blank verse from the point of view of Tithonus. Unlike the original myth, it is Tithonus who asks for immortality, and it is Aurora, not Zeus, who grants this imperfect gift. As narrator, Tithonus laments his unnatural longevity, which separates him from the mortal world as well as from the immortal but beautiful Aurora.
* German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder&#x27;s book &quot;Tithonus und Aurora&quot; was published in 1792.
* &quot;Tithon&quot; is mentioned in the poem &quot;On Imagination&quot; by Phillis Wheatley.
* Sappho&#x27;s &quot;Old Age Poem&quot;, sometimes known as the &quot;Tithonus poem&quot;, discusses beauty and ageing.

<text>Epimenides of [[Knossos]] (or Epimenides of [[Crete]]) (; ) was a semi-mythical 7th- or 6th-century BC Greek seer and philosopher-poet, from Knossos or Phaistos.

==Life==
While tending his father&#x27;s sheep, Epimenides is said to have fallen asleep for fifty-seven years in a Cretan cave sacred to Zeus, after which he reportedly awoke with the gift of prophecy (Diogenes Laërtius i. 109–115). Plutarch writes that Epimenides purified Athens after the pollution brought by the Alcmeonidae, and that the seer&#x27;s expertise in sacrifices and reform of funeral practices were of great help to Solon in his reform of the Athenian state. The only reward he would accept was a branch of the sacred olive, and a promise of perpetual friendship between Athens and Knossos (Plutarch, &quot;Life of Solon&quot;, 12; Aristotle, &quot;Ath. Pol&quot;. 1).

Athenaeus also mentions him, in connection with the self-sacrifice of the &quot;erastes&quot; and &quot;eromenos&quot; pair of Aristodemus and Cratinus, who were believed to have given their lives in order to purify Athens. Even in antiquity there were those who held the story to be mere fiction (&quot;The Deipnosophists,&quot; XIII. 78–79). Diogenes Laërtius preserves a number of spurious letters between Epimenides and Solon in his &quot;Lives of the Philosophers&quot;. Epimenides was also said to have prophesied at Sparta on military matters.

He died in Crete at an advanced age; according to his countrymen, who afterwards honoured him as a god, he lived nearly three hundred years. According to another story, he was taken prisoner in a war between the Spartans and Knossians, and put to death by his captors, because he refused to prophesy favourably for them. Pausanias reports that when Epimenides died, his skin was found to be covered with tattooed writing. This was considered odd, because the Greeks reserved tattooing for slaves. Some modern scholars have seen this as evidence that Epimenides was heir to the shamanic religions of Central Asia, because tattooing is often associated with shamanic initiation. The skin of Epimenides was preserved at the courts of the ephores in Sparta, conceivably as a good-luck charm. Epimenides is also reckoned with Melampus and Onomacritus as one of the founders of Orphism.

According to Diogenes Laërtius, Epimenides met Pythagoras in Crete, and they went to the Cave of Ida.

==Works==

Several prose and poetic works, now lost, were attributed to Epimenides, including a theogony, an epic poem on the Argonautic expedition, prose works on purifications and sacrifices, a cosmogony, oracles, a work on the laws of Crete, and a treatise on Minos and Rhadymanthus.

===&quot;Cretica&quot;===
Epimenides&#x27; &quot;Cretica&quot; (Κρητικά) is quoted twice in the New Testament. Its only source is a 9th-century Syriac commentary by Isho&#x27;dad of Merv on the Acts of the Apostles, discovered, edited and translated (into Greek) by Prof. J. Rendel Harris in a series of articles.

In the poem, Minos addresses Zeus thus:

The &quot;lie&quot; of the Cretans is that Zeus was mortal; Epimenides considered Zeus immortal. &quot;Cretans, always liars,&quot; with the same theological intent as Epimenides, also appears in the &quot;Hymn to Zeus&quot; of Callimachus. The fourth line is quoted (with a reference to one of &quot;your own poets&quot;) in Acts of the Apostles, chapter 17, verse 28.

The second line is quoted, with a veiled attribution (&quot;a prophet of their own&quot;), in the Epistle to Titus, , to warn Titus about the Cretans. The &quot;prophet&quot; in Titus 1:12 is identified by Clement of Alexandria as &quot;Epimenides&quot; (&quot;Stromata&quot;, i. 14). In this passage, Clement mentions that &quot;some say&quot; Epimenides should be counted among the seven wisest philosophers.

Chrysostom (Homily 3 on Titus) gives an alternative fragment:
:For even a tomb, King, of you
:They made, who never died, but ever shall be.

==Epimenides paradox==
It is not clear when Epimenides became associated with the Epimenides paradox, a variation of the liar paradox. Epimenides himself does not appear to have intended any irony or paradox in his statement &quot;Cretans, always liars.&quot; In the epistle to Titus, there is a warning that &quot;One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, the Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.&quot; In the Middle Ages, many forms of the liar paradox were studied under the heading of insolubilia, but these were not associated with Epimenides.

<text>In Greek mythology, Erebus (; ), or Erebos, is the personification of darkness. In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, he is the offspring of Chaos, and the father of Aether and Hemera (Day) by Nyx (Night); in other Greek cosmogonies, he is the father of Aether, Eros, and Metis, or the first ruler of the gods. In genealogies given by Roman authors, he begets a large progeny of personifications upon Nox (the Roman equivalent of Nyx), while in an Orphic theogony, he is the offspring of Chronos (Time).

The name &quot;Erebus&quot; is also used to refer either to the darkness of the Underworld, the Underworld itself, or the region through which souls pass to reach Hades, and can sometimes be used as a synonym for Tartarus or Hades.

== Etymology ==
The meaning of the word &quot;Érebos&quot; () is &quot;darkness&quot; or &quot;gloom&quot;, referring to that of the Underworld. It derives from the Proto-Indo-European &quot;&quot; (&quot;darkness&quot;), and is cognate with the Sanskrit &quot;&quot; (&quot;dark (lower) air, dust&quot;), the Armenian &quot;&quot; (&quot;evening&quot;), the Gothic &quot;&quot;, and the Old Norse &quot;&quot; (&quot;dark, dust&quot;).

== Personification of darkness ==

In a number of Greek cosmogonies, Erebus is described as one of the first beings to exist. In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; (late 8th century BC), which the Greeks considered the &quot;standard&quot; account of the origin of the gods, he is the offspring of Chaos, alongside Nyx (Night). In the first instance of sexual intercourse, he mates with Nyx, producing Aether and Hemera (Day), the pair of which represent the personified opposites of their parents. The Neoplatonist Damascius attributes to Acusilaus (6th century BC) a cosmogony in which Chaos is the first principle, after which comes Erebus and Night, and from this pair are then born Aether, Eros, and Metis. The philosopher Philodemus records that in the work &quot;On the Gods&quot; by one &quot;Satyros&quot;, Erebus is the first of five rulers of the gods, and is succeeded as sovereign by Chaos (though others have suggested this figure may be Eros). According to a hymn by the poet Antagoras (3rd century BC), one of the possible parentages of Eros is Erebus and Night.

Erebus also features in genealogies given by Roman authors. According to Cicero (1st century BC), Erebus and Nox (the Roman equivalent of Nyx) are the parents of Aether and Dies (Day), as well as Amor (Love), Dolus (Guile), Metus (Fear), Labor (Toil), Invidentia (Envy), Fatum (Fate), Senectus (Old Age), Mors (Death), Tenebrae (Darkness), Miseria (Misery), Querella (Lamentation), Gratia (Favour), Fraus (Fraud), Pertinacia (Obstinacy), the Parcae, the Hesperides, and the Somnia (Dreams). In the &quot;Fabulae&quot; by the Roman mythographer Hyginus (1st century BC/AD), Erebus is the offspring of Chaos and Caligo (Mist), alongside Dies (Day), Erebus (Darkness), and Aether. By Nox, he becomes the father of Fatum (Fate), Senectus (Old Age), Mors (Death), Letum (Destruction), Continentia (Strife), Somnus (Sleep), the Somnia (Dreams), Lysimeles (Thoughtfulness), Epiphron (Hedymeles), Porphyrion, Epaphus, Discordia (Discord), Miseria (Misery), Petulantia (Petulance), Nemesis, Euphrosyne (Cheerfulness), Amicitia (Friendship), Misericordia (Pity), Styx, the Parcae - Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos (Fate), and the Hesperides - Aegle, Hesperia, and Erythea (Twilight).

In a cosmogony given by Aristophanes in his play &quot;The Birds&quot; (414 BC), which is often believed to be a parody of an Orphic theogony, Erebus is one of the first deities to exist, alongside Chaos, Night, and Tartarus. At the beginning of creation, Night lays a &quot;wind-egg&quot; in the &quot;boundless bosom of Erebus&quot;, from which springs golden-winged Eros. In an Orphic theogony recorded by Damascius in his work &quot;De principiis&quot; (&quot;On First Principles&quot;), known as the Hieronyman Theogony (2nd century BC?), Erebus, alongside Aether and Chaos, is the offspring of Chronos (Time), who has the form of a serpent.

== Name or region of the Underworld ==
The name &quot;Erebus&quot; is often used by ancient authors to refer either to the darkness of the Underworld, to the Underworld itself, or to the subterranean region through which souls of the dead travel to reach Hades, and it is sometimes used synonymously with Tartarus or Hades. Homer uses the term to refer to the Underworld: in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, souls of the dead are described as &quot;gather[ing] from out of Erebus&quot;, on the shore of Oceanus at the edge of the Earth, while in the &quot;Iliad&quot; Erebus is the location in which the Erinyes live, and from which Heracles must fetch Cerberus. In the &quot;Theogony&quot;, it is the subterraneous place to which Zeus casts the Titan Menoetius (here meaning either Tartarus or Hades), and from which he later brings up the Hecatoncheires. In the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter&quot;, Erebus is used to refer to Hades, the location in which the god Hades and his wife Persephone reside, while in Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Orestes&quot;, it is where the goddess Nyx lives. Later, in Roman literature, Ovid calls Proserpina the &quot;queen of Erebus&quot;, and other authors use Erebus as a name for Hades.

<text>The Direction de la surveillance du territoire (, , abbr. DST) was a directorate of the French National Police operating as a domestic intelligence agency. It was responsible for counterespionage, counterterrorism and more generally the security of France against foreign threats and interference. It was created in 1944 with its headquarters situated at 7 rue Nélaton in Paris. On 1 July 2008, it was merged with the &quot;Direction centrale des renseignements généraux&quot; into the new &quot;Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur&quot;.

The DST Economic Security and Protection of National Assets department had units in the 22 regions of France to protect French technology. It operated for 20 years, not only on behalf of defense industry leaders, but also for pharmaceuticals, telecoms, the automobile industry, and all manufacturing and service sectors.

== History ==
The Surveillance du Territoire (ST) was a counterintelligence and counter terrorism police service which was created in 1934 by the government of Gaston Doumergue and reinforced in 1937 by the government of the Popular Front. It enabled the arrest of many German spies during World War II. Several of its members went on to join the Resistance during the war. The DST succeeded the ST by an order of November 16, 1944, signed by General de Gaulle and relating to the organization of the Ministry of the Interior, supplemented by a decree of November 22, 1944. DST was entrusted to Roger Wybot, who was at the time head of General de Gaulle&#x27;s counter-espionage section
According to a 2003 book, the DST has never been infiltrated by any foreign agency in all of its history.

During the Algerian War (1954–62), the agency created the (ORAF), a group of counter-terrorists whose mission was to carry out false flag terrorist attacks with the aim of quashing any hopes of political compromise. Reporter Marie-Monique Robin, author of a book investigating relationship between the Algerian War and Operation Condor, said to &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; newspaper that &quot;[the] French have systematized a military technique in urban environments which would be copied and pasted to Latin American dictatorships.&quot; Roger Trinquier&#x27;s famous book on counter-insurgency had a very strong influence in South America. Robin was &quot;shocked&quot; to learn that the DST communicated to the Chilean DINA the name of the refugees who returned to Chile (Operation Retorno), all of whom were later killed.

On 3 December 1973, agents of the DST, disguised as plumbers, were caught trying to install a spy microphone in the offices of the &quot;Canard Enchaîné&quot; newspaper. The resulting scandal forced Interior Minister Raymond Marcellin to leave the government.

On 26 June 1975 Ilich Ramírez Sánchez, also known as Carlos the Jackal shot and killed Raymond Dous and Jean Donatini, two DST inspectors, and Michel Moukharbal, a Lebanese informant, on Rue Toullier in Paris. A third police officer, Jean Herranz, Commissioner of the DST, is seriously injured.

One of the greatest success of the DST was the recruitment of the Soviet KGB officer Vladimir Vetrov. Between the spring of 1981 and early 1982 he handed almost 4,000 secret documents over to the French, including the complete official list of 250 Line X KGB officers stationed under legal cover in embassies around the world, before being arrested in February 1982 and executed in 1985.

<text>An intelligence agency is a government agency responsible for the collection, analysis, and exploitation of information in support of law enforcement, national security, military, public safety, and foreign policy objectives.

Means of information gathering are both overt and covert and may include espionage, communication interception, cryptanalysis, cooperation with other institutions, and evaluation of public sources. The assembly and propagation of this information is known as intelligence analysis or intelligence assessment.

== Objectives ==
Intelligence agencies can provide the following services for their national governments.

* Give early warning of impending crisis;
* Serve national and international crisis management by helping to discern the intentions of current or potential opponents;
* Inform national defense planning and military operations, known as military intelligence;
* Protect sensitive information secrets, both of their own sources and activities, and those of other state agencies;
* Covertly influence the outcome of events in favor of national interests, or influence international security; and
* Defense against the efforts of other national intelligence agencies, known as counterintelligence.

There is a distinction between &quot;security intelligence&quot; and &quot;foreign intelligence&quot;. Security intelligence pertains to domestic threats, including terrorism and espionage. Foreign intelligence involves information collection relating to the political, or economic activities of foreign states.

Some agencies have been involved in assassination, arms trafficking, coups d&#x27;état, and the placement of misinformation propaganda and other covert and clandestine operations to support their own or their governments&#x27; interests.

<doc id="81024" wikidata="Q8681" url="?curid=81024" title="Pan Am">
<text>Pan American World Airways, originally founded as Pan American Airways and more commonly known as Pan Am, was an airline that was the principal and largest international air carrier and unofficial overseas flag carrier of the United States for much of the 20th century. It was the first airline to fly worldwide and pioneered innovations in the modern airline industry, such as jumbo jets and computerized reservation systems. Until its dissolution on December 4, 1991, Pan Am &quot;epitomized the luxury and glamour of intercontinental travel&quot;, and it remains a cultural icon of the 20th century, identified by its blue globe logo (&quot;The Blue Meatball&quot;), the use of the word &quot;Clipper&quot; in its aircraft names and call signs, and the white uniform caps of its pilots.

Founded in 1927 by two U.S. Army Air Corps majors, Pan Am began as a scheduled airmail and passenger service flying between Key West, Florida, and Havana, Cuba. In the 1930s, under the leadership of American entrepreneur Juan Trippe, the airline purchased a fleet of flying boats and focused its route network on Central and South America, gradually adding transatlantic and transpacific destinations. By the mid-20th century, Pan Am enjoyed a near monopoly on international routes. It led the aircraft industry into the Jet Age by acquiring new jetliners such as the Boeing 707 and Boeing 747. Pan Am&#x27;s modern fleet allowed it to fly larger numbers of passengers, at a longer range, and with fewer stops than rivals. Its primary hub and flagship terminal was the Worldport at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.

During its peak between the late 1950s and early 1970s, Pan Am had an advanced fleet, highly trained staff, and amenities. In 1970, it flew 11 million passengers to 86 countries, with destinations in every continent except Antarctica. In an era dominated by flag carriers that were wholly or majority-owned by governments, Pan Am became the unofficial national carrier of the United States. It was a founding member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global airline industry association.

Beginning in the mid-1970s, Pan Am began facing a series of challenges both internal and external, along with rising competition from the deregulation of the airline industry in 1978. After several attempts at financial restructuring and rebranding throughout the 1980s, Pan Am gradually sold off its assets before declaring bankruptcy in 1991. By the time it ceased operations, the airline&#x27;s trademark was the second most recognized worldwide, and its loss was felt among travelers and many Americans as signifying the end of the golden age of air travel. Its brand, iconography, and contributions to the industry remain well known in the 21st century. The airline&#x27;s name and imagery were purchased in 1998 by railroad holding company Guilford Transportation Industries, which changed its name to Pan Am Systems and adopted Pan Am&#x27;s logo.

==History==

===Formation===


Pan American Airways, Incorporated (PAA) was founded as a shell company on March 14, 1927, by United States Army Air Corps officers Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold, Carl Spaatz and John Jouett out of concern for the growing influence of the German-owned Colombian air carrier SCADTA, in Central America. Operating in Colombia since 1920, SCADTA lobbied hard for landing rights in the Panama Canal Zone, ostensibly to survey air routes for a connection to the United States, which the Air Corps viewed as a precursor to a possible German aerial threat to the canal. In the spring of 1927, the United States Post Office requested bids on a contract to deliver mail from Key West, Florida to Havana, Cuba before 19 October 1927. Arnold and Spaatz drew up the prospectus for Pan American after they learned that SCADTA hired a company in Delaware to obtain air mail contracts from the US government.

Also competing for the contract, Juan Trippe formed the Aviation Corporation of the Americas (ACA) on June 2, 1927, with in startup capital and the backing of powerful and politically connected financiers including Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney and W. Averell Harriman. Their operation had the all-important landing rights for Havana, having acquired American International Airways, a small airline established in 1926 by John K. Montgomery and Richard B. Bevier as a seaplane service from Key West to Havana. A third company, Atlantic, Gulf, and Caribbean Airways, was established on October 11, 1927, by New York City investment banker Richard Hoyt to bid for the contract.

The Postal Service awarded Pan American Airways the US mail delivery contract to Cuba, at the end of the bidding process, but Pan American lacked any aircraft to perform the job and did not have landing rights in Cuba. Just days before the 19 October deadline, the three companies decided to form a partnership. ACA chartered a Fairchild FC-2 floatplane from a small Dominican Republic carrier, West Indian Aerial Express, allowing Pan Am to operate the first flight to Havana on 19 October 1927. The three companies formally merged on June 23, 1928. Richard Hoyt was named as president of the new Aviation Corporation of the Americas, but Trippe and his partners held 40% of the equity and Whitney was made president. Trippe became operational head of Pan American Airways, the new company&#x27;s principal operating subsidiary.

The US government approved the original Pan Am&#x27;s mail delivery contract with little objection, out of fears that SCADTA would have no competition in bidding for routes between Latin America and the United States. The government further helped Pan Am by insulating it from its US competitors, seeing the airline as the &quot;chosen instrument&quot; for US-based international air routes. The airline expanded internationally, benefiting from a virtual monopoly on foreign routes.

Trippe and his associates planned to extend Pan Am&#x27;s network through all of Central and South America. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Pan Am purchased a number of ailing or defunct airlines in Central and South America and negotiated with postal officials to win most of the government&#x27;s airmail contracts to the region. In September 1929 Trippe toured Latin America with Charles Lindbergh to negotiate landing rights in a number of countries, including Barranquilla on SCADTA&#x27;s home turf of Colombia, as well as Maracaibo and Caracas in Venezuela. By the end of the year, Pan Am offered flights along the west coast of South America to Peru. Following government favors for the denial of mail contracts to their competition, a forced merger was created with New York, Rio, and Buenos Aires Line, giving a seaplane route along the east coast of South America to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and westbound to Santiago, Chile. Its Brazilian subsidiary NYRBA do Brasil was later renamed as Panair do Brasil. Pan Am also partnered with the Grace Shipping Company in 1929 to form Pan American-Grace Airways, better known as Panagra, to gain a foothold to destinations in South America. In the same year, Pan Am acquired a controlling stake in Mexicana de Aviación and took over Mexicana&#x27;s Ford Trimotor route between Brownsville, Texas and Mexico City, extending this service to the Yucatan Peninsula to connect with Pan Am&#x27;s Caribbean route network.

Pan Am&#x27;s holding company, the Aviation Corporation of the Americas, was one of the most sought after stocks on the New York Curb Exchange in 1929, and flurries of speculation surrounded each of its new route awards. In April 1929 Trippe and his associates reached an agreement with United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (UATC) to segregate Pan Am operations to the south of the Mexico – United States border, in exchange for UATC taking a large shareholder stake (UATC was the parent company of what are now Boeing, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and United Airlines). The Aviation Corporation of the Americas changed its name to &quot;Pan American Airways Corporation&quot; in 1931.

===Clipper era===


Pan Am started its South American routes with Consolidated Commodore and Sikorsky S-38 flying boats. The S-40, larger than the eight-passenger S-38, began flying for Pan Am in 1931. Carrying the nicknames &quot;American Clipper&quot;, &quot;Southern Clipper&quot;, and &quot;Caribbean Clipper&quot;, they were the first of the series of 28 &quot;Clipper&quot;s that symbolized Pan Am between 1931 and 1946. During this time, Pan Am operated Clipper services to Latin America from the International Pan American Airport at Dinner Key in Miami, Florida.

In 1937 Pan Am turned to Britain and France to begin seaplane service between the United States and Europe. Pan Am reached an agreement with both countries to offer service from Norfolk, Virginia, to Europe via Bermuda and the Azores using the S-42s. A joint service from Port Washington, New York, to Bermuda began in June 1937, with Pan Am using Sikorskys and Imperial Airways using the C class flying boat RMA &quot;Cavalier&quot;.

On July 5, 1937, survey flights across the North Atlantic began. Pan Am &quot;Clipper III&quot;, a Sikorsky S-42, landed at Botwood in the Bay of Exploits in Newfoundland from Port Washington, via Shediac, New Brunswick. The next day Pan Am &quot;Clipper III&quot; left Botwood for Foynes in County Limerick, Ireland. The same day, a Short Empire C-Class flying boat, the &quot;Caledonia&quot;, left Foynes for Botwood, and landed July 6, 1937, reaching Montreal on July 8 and New York on July 9.

Trippe decided to start a service from San Francisco to Honolulu and on to Hong Kong and Auckland following steamship routes. After negotiating traffic rights in 1934 to land at Pearl Harbor, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, and Manila, Pan Am shipped $500,000 worth of aeronautical equipment and construction crews westward in March 1935 using the S.S. &quot;North Haven&quot;, a 15,000-ton merchant ship chartered to provision each island that the clippers would stop at on their 4- to 5-day flight. Pan Am ran its first survey flight to Honolulu in April 1935 with a Sikorsky S-42 flying boat. Construction crews, including Bill Mullahey who would later oversee Pan Am&#x27;s Pacific operations, cleared coral from lagoons, constructed hotels, and installed the radio navigation equipment necessary for the clippers to island hop from Pearl City Seaplane Base, Hawaii, to Asia. The airline won the contract for a San Francisco–Canton mail route later that year and operated its first commercial flight carrying mail and express (no passengers) in a Martin M-130 from Alameda to Manila amid media fanfare on November 22, 1935. The five-leg, flight arrived in Manila on November 29 and returned to San Francisco on December 6, cutting the time between the two cities by the fastest scheduled steamship by over two weeks. (Both the United States and the Philippine Islands issued special stamps for the two flights.) The first passenger flight left Alameda on October 21, 1936. The fare from San Francisco to Manila or Hong Kong in 1937 was one way () and US$1,710 () round trip. This later became known as the Pan Am China Clipper route, from San Francisco, leading to Manila, Hong Kong, Shanghai.

On August 6, 1937, Juan Trippe accepted United States aviation&#x27;s highest annual prize, the Collier Trophy, on behalf of PAA from President Franklin D. Roosevelt for the company&#x27;s &quot;establishment of the transpacific airline and the successful execution of extended overwater navigation and the regular operations thereof.&quot;


 Pan Am also used Boeing 314 flying boats for the Pacific route: in China, passengers could connect to domestic flights on the Pan Am-operated China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) network, co-owned with the Chinese government. Pan Am flew to Singapore for the first time in 1941, starting a semi-monthly service that reduced San Francisco–Singapore travel times from 25 days to six days.

Six large, long-range Boeing 314 flying boats were delivered to Pan Am in early 1939. On March 30, 1939, the &quot;Yankee Clipper&quot;, piloted by Harold E. Gray, made the first-ever trans-Atlantic passenger flight. The first leg of the flight, Baltimore to Horta, took 17 hours and 32 minutes and covered . The second leg from Horta to Pan Am&#x27;s newly built airport in Lisbon took 7 hours and 7 minutes and covered . The Boeing 314 also enabled the start of scheduled weekly contract Foreign Air Mail (F.A.M. 18) service and later passenger flights from New York (Port Washington, L.I.) to both France and Britain. The Southern route to France was inaugurated for airmail on May 20, 1939, by the &quot;Yankee Clipper&quot; piloted by Arthur E. LaPorte flying via Horta, Azores, and Lisbon, Portugal to Marseilles. Passenger service over the route was added on June 28, 1939, by the &quot;Dixie Clipper&quot; piloted by R.O.D. Sullivan. The Eastbound trip departed every Wednesday at Noon and arrived at Marseilles on Friday at 3 pm GCT with return service leaving Marseilles on Sunday at 8 am and arriving at Port Washington on Tuesday at 7 am. The Northern transatlantic route to Britain was inaugurated for Air Mail service on June 24, 1939, by the &quot;Yankee Clipper&quot; piloted by Harold Gray flying via Shediac (New Brunswick), Botwood (Newfoundland), and Foynes (Ireland) to Southampton. Passenger service was added on the Northern route on July 8, 1939, by the &quot;Yankee Clipper&quot;. Eastbound flights left on Saturday at 7:30 am and arrived at Southampton on Sunday at 1 pm GCT. Westbound service departed Southampton on Wednesday at Noon and arrived at Port Washington on Thursday at 3 pm. After the outbreak of World War II in Europe on September 1, 1939, the terminus became Foynes until the service ceased for the winter on October 5 while transatlantic service to Lisbon via the Azores continued into 1941. During World War II, Pan Am flew over worldwide in support of military operations.

The &quot;Clippers&quot; – the name hearkened back to the 19th-century fast-sailing clippers – were the only American passenger aircraft of the time capable of intercontinental travel. To compete with ocean liners, the airline offered first-class seats on such flights, and the style of flight crews became more formal. Instead of being leather-jacketed, silk-scarved airmail pilots, the crews of the &quot;Clippers&quot; wore naval-style uniforms and adopted a set procession when boarding the aircraft. In 1940 Pan Am and TWA both received and began using the Boeing 307 Stratoliner, the first pressurized airliner to enter service. The Boeing 307&#x27;s airline service was short-lived, as all were commandeered for military service when the United States entered World War II.

During World War II most Clippers were pressed into military service. A new Pan Am subsidiary pioneered an air military-supply route across the Atlantic from Brazil to West Africa. The onward flight to Sudan and Egypt tracked an existing British civil air route. In January 1942, the &quot;Pacific Clipper&quot; completed the first circumnavigation of the globe by a commercial airliner. Another first occurred in January 1943, when Franklin D. Roosevelt became the first US president to fly abroad, in the &quot;Dixie Clipper&quot;. During this period &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry was a Clipper pilot; he was aboard the &quot;Clipper Eclipse&quot; when it crashed in Syria on June 19, 1947.

While waiting at Foynes, Ireland, for a Pan Am Clipper flight to New York in 1942, passengers were served a drink today known as Irish coffee by Chef Joe Sheridan.

===Post-war expansion and modernization===
The growing importance of air transport in the post-war era meant that Pan Am would no longer enjoy the official patronage it had been afforded in pre-war days to prevent the emergence of any meaningful competition, both at home and abroad.

Although Pan Am continued to use its political influence to lobby for protection of its position as America&#x27;s primary international airline, it encountered increasing competition – first from American Export Airlines across the Atlantic to Europe, and subsequently from others including TWA to Europe, Braniff to South America, United to Hawaii and Northwest Orient to East Asia, as well as five potential rivals to Mexico. This changed situation resulted from the new post-war approach the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) took toward the promotion of competition between major US carriers on key domestic and international scheduled routes compared with pre-war US aviation policy.
American Overseas Airlines (AOA) was the first airline to begin regular landplane flights across the Atlantic on October 24, 1945. In January 1946, Pan Am scheduled seven DC-4s a week east from LaGuardia Airport, five to London (Hurn Airport) and two to Lisbon. The time to Hurn was 17 hours and 40 minutes, including stops, or 20 hours and 45 minutes to Lisbon. A Boeing 314 flying boat flew LaGuardia to Lisbon once every two weeks in 29 hours and 30 minutes; flying boat flights ended shortly thereafter.

TWA&#x27;s transatlantic challenge—the impending introduction of its faster, pressurized Lockheed Constellations—resulted in Pan Am ordering its own Constellation fleet at apiece. Pan Am began transatlantic Constellation flights on January 14, 1946, beating TWA by three weeks.

In January 1946, a flight from Miami to Buenos Aires took 71 hours and 15 minutes in a Pan Am DC-3, but the following summer, DC-4s flew Idlewild to Buenos Aires in 38 hours and 30 minutes. In January 1958, Pan Am&#x27;s DC-7Bs flew New York to Buenos Aires in 25 hours and 20 minutes, while the National–Pan Am–Panagra DC-7B via Panama and Lima took 22 hours and 45 minutes. Convair 240s replaced DC-3s and other pre-war types on Pan Am&#x27;s shorter flights in the Caribbean and South America. Pan Am also acquired a few Curtiss C-46s for a freight network that eventually extended to Buenos Aires.

In January 1946, Pan Am had no transpacific flights beyond Hawaii, but they soon resumed with DC-4s. In January 1958, the California to Tokyo flight was a daily Stratocruiser that took 31 hours 45 minutes from San Francisco or 32 hours 15 minutes from Los Angeles. (A flight to Seattle and a connection to Northwest&#x27;s DC-7C totaled 24 hours and 13 minutes from San Francisco, but Pan Am was not allowed to fly that route.) The Stratocruisers&#x27; double-deck fuselage with sleeping berths and a lower-deck lounge helped it compete with its rival. &quot;Super Stratocruisers&quot; with more fuel appeared on Pan Am&#x27;s transatlantic routes in November 1954, making nonstop eastward and one-stop westward schedules more reliable.

In June 1947, Pan Am started the first scheduled round-the-world airline flight. In September, the weekly DC-4 was scheduled to leave San Francisco at 22:00 Thursday as Flight 1, stopping at Honolulu, Midway, Wake, Guam, Manila, Bangkok, and arriving in Calcutta on Monday at 12:45, where it met Flight 2, a Constellation that had left New York at 23:30 Friday. The DC-4 returned to San Francisco as Flight 2; the Constellation left Calcutta at 13:30 Tuesday, stopped at Karachi, Istanbul, London, Shannon, Gander, and arrived LaGuardia Thursday at 14:55. A few months later, PA 3 took over the Manila route, while PA 1 shifted to Tokyo and Shanghai. All Pan Am round-the-world flights included at least one change of plane until Boeing 707s took over in 1960. PA 1 became daily in 1962–63, making different en-route stops on different days of the week; in January 1963, it left San Francisco at 09:00 daily and was scheduled into New York 56 hours and 10 minutes later. Los Angeles replaced San Francisco in 1968; when Boeing 747s finished replacing 707s in 1971, all stops except Tehran and Karachi were served daily in each direction. For a year or so in 1975–76, Pan Am finally completed the round-the-world trip, New York to New York.

In January 1950, Pan American Airways Corporation officially became Pan American World Airways, Inc. (The airline had begun calling itself &quot;Pan American World Airways&quot; in 1943.) In September 1950 Pan Am completed the purchase of American Overseas Airlines from American Airlines. That month Pan Am ordered 45 Douglas DC-6Bs. The first, &quot;Clipper Liberty Bell&quot; (N6518C), inaugurated Pan Am&#x27;s all-tourist class &quot;Rainbow&quot; service between New York and London on May 1, 1952, to complement the all-first &quot;President&quot; Stratocruiser service. From June 1954, DC-6Bs began replacing DC-4s on Pan Am&#x27;s internal German routes.

Pan Am introduced the Douglas DC-7C &quot;Seven Seas&quot; on transatlantic routes in summer 1956. In January 1958 the DC-7C nonstop took 10 hours and 45 minutes from Idlewild to London, enabling Pan Am to hold its own against TWA&#x27;s Super Constellations and Starliners. In 1957, Pan Am started DC-7C flights direct from the West Coast of the United States to London and Paris, with a fuel stop in Canada or Greenland. The introduction of the faster Bristol Britannia turboprop by British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) between New York and London on December 19, 1957, ended Pan Am&#x27;s competitive leadership there.

In January 1958 Pan Am scheduled 47 flights a week east from Idlewild to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and beyond; the following August there were 65.

===Jet age===
Pan Am considered purchasing the world&#x27;s first jetliner, the British De Havilland Comet, but instead waited to become Boeing 707 launch customer in 1955 with an order for 20. The 707 was originally to be 144 inches (3.66 m) wide with five-abreast seating but Boeing widened their design to match the DC-8. 

Pan Am&#x27;s first scheduled jet flight was from New York Idlewild to Paris Le Bourget, stopping at Gander to refuel, on October 26, 1958. The Boeing 707-121 &quot;Clipper America&quot; N711PA carried 111 passengers.

It also purchased 25 Douglas DC-8, which could also seat six across; the combined order value for these first 707s and DC-8s was $269 million. 

Meanwhile Boeing improved their aircraft with the introduction of the Boeing 707-320 &quot;Intercontinental&quot; offering greater payload and range. Pan Am started taking deliveries of the Intercontinental in 1959–60, which together with the Douglas DC-8s arriving in March 1960, enabled non-stop transatlantic crossings with a viable payload in both directions.

Pan Am eventually operated 19 Douglas DC-8s, disposing of them in 1970 after just ten years of service. Meanwhile Pan Am went on to operate a much larger total of 120 Boeing 707-320 &quot;Intercontinental&quot; aircraft, for just over 20 years, with this type becoming the mainstay of Pan Am operations until the arrival of the Boeing 747.

====Widebody era====
Pan Am was a Boeing 747 launch customer, placing a order for 25 in April 1966.

On January 15, 1970 First Lady Pat Nixon christened Pan Am Boeing 747 &quot;Clipper Young America&quot; at Washington Dulles.

Pan Am&#x27;s inaugural 747 service on the evening of January 21, 1970, was delayed for several hours by engine failure affecting the scheduled &quot;Clipper Young America&quot;. &quot;Clipper Victor&quot; was substituted for the flight from New York John F. Kennedy to London Heathrow (&quot;Clipper Victor&quot; was destroyed seven years later in the Tenerife air disaster, in a collision with a KLM 747-200). While on the tarmac at Heathrow, two students from Aston University boarded the aircraft undetected and distributed rag mags in the passenger accommodation as a publicity stunt.

Pan Am carried 11 million passengers over in 1970, the year it introduced widebodied airline travel.

====Supersonic plans====
Pan Am was one of the first three airlines to sign options for the Aérospatiale-BAC Concorde, but like other airlines that took out options – with the exception of BOAC and Air France – it did not purchase the supersonic jet. Pan Am was the first US airline to sign for the Boeing 2707, the American supersonic transport (SST) project, with 15 delivery positions reserved; these aircraft never saw service after Congress voted against additional funding in 1971.

===Computerized reservations, Pan Am Building and Worldport===

Pan Am commissioned IBM to build PANAMAC, a large computer that booked airline and hotel reservations, which was installed in 1964. It also held large amounts of information about cities, countries, airports, aircraft, hotels, and restaurants.

The computer occupied the fourth floor of the Pan Am Building, which was the largest commercial office building in the world for some time.

The airline also built Worldport, a terminal building at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. It was distinguished by its elliptical, four-acre (16,000 m2) roof, suspended far from the outside columns of the terminal below by 32 sets of steel posts and cables. The terminal was designed to allow passengers to board and disembark via stairs without getting wet by parking the nose of the aircraft under the overhang. The introduction of the jetbridge made this feature obsolete. The Worldport building was transferred to Delta Air Lines in 1991, and demolished by Delta and the Port Authority in 2013.

Pan Am built a gilded training building in the style of Edward Durell Stone designed by Steward-Skinner Architects in Miami.
===Peak===
At its peak in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Pan Am advertised under the slogan, the &quot;World&#x27;s Most Experienced Airline&quot;. It carried 6.7 million passengers in 1966, and by 1968, its 150 jets flew to 86 countries on every continent except for Antarctica over a scheduled route network of 81,410 unduplicated miles (131,000 km). During that period, the airline was profitable, and its cash reserves totaled . Most routes were between New York, Europe, and South America, and between Miami and the Caribbean. In 1964, Pan Am began a helicopter shuttle between New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia, and Newark airports and Lower Manhattan, operated by New York Airways. Aside from the DC-8, the Boeing 707 and 747, the Pan Am jet fleet included Boeing 720Bs and 727s (the first aircraft to sport &quot;Pan Am&quot; rather than &quot;Pan American&quot; – titles). The airline later had Boeing 737s and 747SPs (which could fly nonstop from New York to Tokyo), Lockheed L-1011 Tristars, McDonnell-Douglas DC-10s, and Airbus A300s and A310s. Pan Am owned the InterContinental Hotel chain and had a financial interest in the Falcon Jet Corporation, which held marketing rights to the Dassault Falcon 20 business jet in North America. The airline was involved in creating a missile-tracking range in the South Atlantic and operating a nuclear-engine testing laboratory in Nevada. In addition, Pan Am participated in several notable humanitarian flights.

At its height Pan Am was well regarded for its modern fleet, innovative cabin design and experienced crews: cabin staff were multilingual and usually college graduates, hired from around the world, frequently with nursing training. Pan Am&#x27;s onboard service and cuisine, inspired by Maxim&#x27;s de Paris, were delivered &quot;with a personal flair that has rarely been equaled.&quot;

===Internal German Services (IGS) and other operations===
From 1950 until 1990 Pan Am operated a comprehensive network of high-frequency, short-haul scheduled services between West Germany and West Berlin, first with Douglas DC-4s, then with DC-6Bs (from 1954) and Boeing 727s (from 1966). This had come about as a result of an agreement among the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union at the end of World War II which prohibited Germany from having its own airlines and restricted the provision of commercial air services from and to Berlin to air transport providers headquartered in these four countries. Rising Cold War tensions between the Soviet Union and the three Western powers resulted in unilateral Soviet withdrawal from the quadripartite Allied Control Commission in 1948, culminating in the division of Germany the following year. These events, together with Soviet insistence on a very narrow interpretation of the post-war agreement on the Western powers&#x27; access rights to Berlin, meant that until the end of the Cold War air transport in West Berlin continued to be confined to the carriers of the remaining Allied Control Commission powers, with aircraft required to fly across hostile East German territory through three wide air corridors at a maximum altitude of . The airline&#x27;s West Berlin operation consistently accounted for more than half of the city&#x27;s entire commercial air traffic during that period.

For years, more passengers boarded Pan Am flights at Berlin Tempelhof than at any other airport. Pan Am operated a Berlin crew base of mainly German flight attendants and American pilots to staff its IGS flights. The German National flight attendants were later taken over by Lufthansa when it acquired Pan Am&#x27;s Berlin route authorities. Over the years other local flight attendant bases outside the US included London for intra-Europe and transatlantic flying, Warsaw, Istanbul and Belgrade for intra-Europe flights, a Tel Aviv base solely staffing the daily Tel Aviv-Paris-Tel Aviv service, a Nairobi base solely staffing the Nairobi-Frankfurt-Nairobi service as well as Delhi and Bombay bases for India-Frankfurt flights.

Pan Am also operated Rest and Recreation (R&amp;R) flights during the Vietnam War. These flights carried American service personnel for R&amp;R leaves in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and other Asian cities.

===Passenger traffic (1951–1989)===
In August 1953 PAA scheduled passenger flights to 106 airports; in May 1968 to 122 airports; in November 1978 to 65 airports (plus a few freight-only airports); in November 1985 to 98 airports; in November 1991 to 46 airports (plus 14 more with only &quot;Pan Am Express&quot; prop flights).

===Downturn===
====Fallout from 1973 oil crisis====
Pan Am had invested in a large fleet of Boeing 747s, expecting that air travel would continue to increase. It did not, as the introduction of many wide-bodies by Pan Am and its competitors coincided with an economic slowdown. Reduced air travel after the 1973 oil crisis made the overcapacity problem worse. Pan Am was vulnerable, with its high overheads as a result of a large decentralized infrastructure. High fuel prices and its many older, less fuel-efficient narrow-bodied airplanes increased the airline&#x27;s operating costs. Federal route awards to other airlines, such as the Transpacific Route Case, further reduced the number of passengers Pan Am carried and its profit margins.

On September 23, 1974, a group of Pan Am employees published an advertisement in &quot;The New York Times&quot; to register their disagreement over federal policies that they felt were harming the financial viability of their employer. The ad cited discrepancies in airport landing fees, such as Pan Am paying $4,200 () to land a plane in Sydney, while the Australian carrier, Qantas, paid only $178 to land a jet in Los Angeles. The ad also contended that the United States Postal Service was paying foreign airlines five times as much to carry US mail in comparison to Pan Am. Finally, the ad questioned why the Export-Import Bank of the United States loaned money to Japan, France, and Saudi Arabia at 6% interest while Pan Am paid 12%.

By 1976, Pan Am had racked up of accumulated losses over a 10-year period, and its debts approached . This threatened the airline with bankruptcy. Former American Airlines vice president of operations, William T. Seawell, who had replaced Najeeb Halaby as Pan Am president in 1972, began implementing a turnaround strategy: trimming the network by 25%, slashing the 40,000-strong workforce by 30%, cutting wages, introducing stringent economies and rescheduling debt, and reducing the size of the fleet. These measures, aided by the use of tax-loss credits, enabled Pan Am to avert financial collapse and return to profitability in 1977.

====Attempts to build a US domestic network====
Since the 1930s, Juan Trippe had coveted domestic routes for Pan Am. Through the late 1950s and early 1960s, and in the mid-1970s, there were talks of merging the airline with a domestic operator such as American Airlines, Eastern Air Lines, Trans World Airlines or United Airlines. As rival airlines convinced Congress that Pan Am would use its political clout to monopolize US air routes, the CAB repeatedly denied the airline permission to operate in the US, by growth or by a merger with another airline. Pan Am remained an American carrier operating international routes only (aside from Hawaii and Alaska). The last time Pan Am was permitted to merge with another airline prior to the deregulation of the US airline industry was in 1950, when it took over American Overseas Airlines from American Airlines. After deregulation in 1978, more US domestic airlines began competing with Pan Am internationally.

====National Airlines takeover====
To acquire domestic routes, Pan Am, under president Seawell, set its eyes on National Airlines. Pan Am wound up in a bidding war with Frank Lorenzo&#x27;s Texas International Airlines which boosted National&#x27;s stock price, but Pan Am was granted permission to buy National in 1979 in what was described as the &quot;Coup of the Decade&quot;. The acquisition of National Airlines for , completed on January 7, 1980, further burdened Pan Am&#x27;s balance sheet, already under strain after financing the Boeing 747s ordered in the mid-1960s. This acquisition did little to improve Pan Am&#x27;s competitive position in relation to nimbler, lower-cost competitors in a deregulated industry, as National&#x27;s north–south route structure provided insufficient feed at Pan Am&#x27;s transatlantic and transpacific gateways in New York and Los Angeles. Apart from the Boeing 727, the airlines had incompatible fleets and corporate cultures. Pan Am management handled the integration poorly and presided over an increase in labor costs as a result of harmonizing National&#x27;s pay scales with Pan Am&#x27;s. Although revenues increased by 62% from 1979 to 1980, fuel costs from the merger increased by 157% during a weak economic climate. Further &quot;miscellaneous expenses&quot; increased by 74%.

====Disposal of non-core assets and operational cutbacks====
As 1980 progressed and the airline&#x27;s financial situation worsened, Seawell began selling Pan Am&#x27;s non-core assets. The first asset to be sold off was the airline&#x27;s 50% interest in Falcon Jet Corporation in August. Later in November, Pan Am sold the Pan Am Building to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company for . In September 1981, Pan Am sold off its InterContinental hotel chain. Before this transaction closed, Seawell was replaced by C. Edward Acker, Air Florida&#x27;s founder and ex-president, as well as a former Braniff International executive. The combined sale value of the InterContinental chain and the Falcon Jet Corp. stake was .

Acker followed up the asset disposal program he had inherited from his predecessor with operational cutbacks. Most prominent among these was the discontinuation of the round-the world service from October 31, 1982, when Pan Am ceased flying between Delhi, Bangkok and Hong Kong due to the sector&#x27;s unprofitability. To provide additional seating capacity for its 1983 spring/summer season, the airline also acquired three passenger Boeing 747-200Bs from Flying Tigers, who took four of Pan Am&#x27;s 747-100 freighters in return.

====Fleet restructuring====
Despite Pan Am&#x27;s precarious financial situation, in the summer of 1984, Acker went ahead with an order for new Airbus models in wide-body and narrow-bodied aircraft, becoming the second American company to order Airbus aircraft, after Eastern Air Lines. These advanced aircraft, economically and operationally superior to the 747s and 727s Pan Am operated at the time, were intended to make the airline more competitive. In 1985, new A310-221s began replacing 727s on the Internal German Services (IGS) and A300s flew in the Caribbean networks later that year. From early 1986, additional new longer range A310-222s replaced some of the 747s on the slimmed-down transatlantic network following ETOPS certification (approval by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of transoceanic flying with twin-engined aircraft). The first A310 ETOPS transatlantic route was New York-JFK to Hamburg, Detroit to London followed shortly after that. Pan Am&#x27;s decision not to take delivery of the A320s and to sell its delivery positions to Braniff meant that the majority of its short-haul US domestic and European feeder routes, and most of its IGS services, continued to be flown with obsolete 727s until the airline&#x27;s demise. This disadvantaged it against rivals operating state-of-the-art aircraft with greater passenger appeal. In September 1984, Pan American World Airways created a holding company called &quot;Pan Am Corporation&quot; to assume ownership and control of the airline and the services division.


==== Sale of Pacific division ====
Given the airline&#x27;s dire state, in April 1985, Acker sold Pan Am&#x27;s entire Pacific Division, which consisted of 25% of its entire route system and their major hub at Tokyo-Narita to United Airlines for . This sale also enabled Pan Am to address fleet incompatibility issues related to the earlier acquisition of National Airlines as it included Pan Am&#x27;s Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-powered 747SPs, its Rolls-Royce RB211-powered L-1011-500s and the General Electric CF6-powered DC-10s inherited from National, which were transferred to United along with the Pacific routes. The sale came the same year as a month-long strike held by the Transport Workers Union of America.

====Establishment of local feeder networks====
In the early 1980s, Pan Am contracted several regional airlines (Air Atlanta, Colgan Air, Emerald Air, Empire Airlines, Presidential Airways and Republic Airlines) to operate feeder flights under the &quot;Pan Am Express&quot; branding.

The acquisition of Pennsylvania-based commuter airline Ransome Airlines for (which was finalized in 1987) was meant to address the issue of providing additional feed for Pan Am&#x27;s mainline services at its hubs in New York, Los Angeles and Miami in the United States, and Berlin in Germany. The renamed Pan Am Express operated routes mostly from New York, as well as Berlin, Germany. Miami services were added in 1990. However, the regional Pan Am Express operation provided only an incremental feed to Pan Am&#x27;s international route system, which was now focused on the Atlantic Division.

====US East coast shuttle====
In an attempt to gain a presence on the busy Washington–New York–Boston commuter air corridor, the Ransome acquisition was accompanied by the $100 million purchase of New York Air&#x27;s shuttle service between Boston, New York, and Washington, D.C. This parallel move was intended to enable Pan Am to provide a high-frequency service for high-yield business travelers in direct competition with the long-established, successful Eastern Air Lines Shuttle operation. The renamed Pan Am Shuttle began operating out of LaGuardia Airport&#x27;s refurbished historic Marine Air Terminal in October 1986. However, it did not address the pressing issue of Pan Am&#x27;s continuing lack of a strong domestic feeder network.

====Financial, operational and reputational setbacks====
In 1987, Towers Financial Corporation, led by its CEO Steven Hoffenberg and his consultant Jeffrey Epstein, unsuccessfully tried to take over Pan Am in a corporate raid with Towers Financial as their raiding vessel. Their bid failed.

Thomas G. Plaskett, a former American Airlines and Continental executive, replaced Acker as president in January 1988 (joining Pan Am from the latter). While a program to refurbish Pan Am aircraft and improve the company&#x27;s on-time performance began showing positive results (in fact, Pan Am&#x27;s most profitable quarter ever was the third quarter of 1988), on December 21, 1988, the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 above Lockerbie, Scotland, resulted in 270 fatalities. Faced with a $300 million lawsuit filed by more than 100 families of the victims, the airline subpoenaed records of six US government agencies, including the CIA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the State Department. Though the records suggested that the US government was aware of warnings of a bombing and failed to pass the information to the airline, the families claimed Pan Am was attempting to shift the blame.

Also, in December 1988 the FAA fined Pan Am for 19 security failures, out of the 236 that were detected amongst 29 airlines.

====Failed bid for Northwest Airlines====
In June 1989, Plaskett presented Northwest Airlines with a $2.7 billion takeover bid that was backed by Bankers Trust, Morgan Guaranty Trust, Citicorp and Prudential-Bache. The proposed merger was Pan Am&#x27;s final attempt to create a strong domestic network to provide sufficient feed for the two remaining mainline hubs at New York JFK and Miami. It was also intended to help the airline regain its status as a global airline by re-establishing a sizable transpacific presence. The merger was expected to result in annual savings of $240 million. However, billionaire financier Al Checchi outbid Pan Am by presenting Northwest&#x27;s directors with a superior proposal.

====Fallout from 1990–91 Persian Gulf War====
The first Gulf War triggered by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990, caused fuel prices to rise, which severely depressed global economic activity. This in turn caused a sharp contraction of worldwide air travel demand, plunging once profitable operations, including Pan Am&#x27;s prime transatlantic routes, into steep losses. These unforeseen events constituted a further major blow to Pan Am, which was still reeling from the 1988 Lockerbie disaster. To shore up its finances, Pan Am sold most of its routes serving London Heathrow – arguably Pan Am&#x27;s most important international destination – to United Airlines with two Boeing 747s. This left Pan Am with only two daily London flights, serving Detroit and Miami, which both used Gatwick as their London terminal from the start of the 1990/91 winter timetable. Further asset disposals included Pan Am&#x27;s sale of its IGS routes to Berlin to Lufthansa for , which became effective at the same time and brought the total value of asset disposals to . These measures were accompanied by the elimination of 2,500 jobs (8.6% of its workforce). These cutbacks were announced by the airline in September 1990.

===Bankruptcy===
Pan Am was forced to file for bankruptcy protection on January 8, 1991. Delta Air Lines purchased the remaining profitable assets of Pan Am, including its remaining European routes (except one from Miami to Paris), and Frankfurt mini hub, the Shuttle operation, 45 jets, and the Pan Am Worldport at John F. Kennedy Airport, for $416 million. Delta also injected $100 million becoming a 45 percent owner of a reorganized but smaller Pan Am serving the Caribbean, Central and South America from a main hub in Miami. The airline&#x27;s creditors would hold the other 55 percent.

The Boston–New York LaGuardia–Washington National &quot;Pan Am Shuttle&quot; service was taken over by Delta in September 1991. Two months later Delta assumed all of Pan Am&#x27;s remaining transatlantic traffic rights, except Miami to Paris and London. In November 1991, all members of Pan Am&#x27;s frequent flyer program, WorldPass, were transferred, with their accumulated miles, to Delta&#x27;s frequent flyer program, SkyMiles.

In October 1991, former Douglas Aircraft executive Russell Ray Jr., was hired as Pan Am&#x27;s new president and CEO. As part of this restructuring, Pan Am relocated its headquarters from the Pan Am Building in New York City to new offices in the Miami area in preparation for the airline&#x27;s relaunch from both Miami and New York on November 1. The new airline would have operated approximately 60 aircraft and generated about $1.2 billion in annual revenues with 7,500 employees. Following the relaunch, Pan Am continued to sustain heavy losses. Revenue throughout October and November 1991 fell short of what had been anticipated in the reorganization plan, with Delta claiming that Pan Am was losing $3 million a day. This undermined Delta&#x27;s, Wall Street&#x27;s and the traveling public&#x27;s confidence in the viability of the reorganized Pan Am.

Pan Am&#x27;s senior executives outlined a projected shortfall of between $100 million and possibly $200 million, with the airline requiring a $25 million installment just to fly through the following week. On the evening of December 3, Pan Am&#x27;s Creditors Committee advised US Bankruptcy Judge Cornelius Blackshear that it was close to convincing an airline (TWA) to invest $15 million to keep Pan Am operating. A deal with TWA owner Carl Icahn could not be struck. Pan Am opened for business at 9:00 am and within the hour, Ray was forced to withdraw Pan Am&#x27;s plan of reorganization and execute an immediate shutdown plan for Pan Am.

Pan Am ceased operations on December 4, 1991, following a decision by Delta CEO Ron Allen and other senior executives not to go ahead with the final $25 million payment Pan Am was scheduled to receive the weekend after Thanksgiving. As a result, some 7,500 Pan Am employees lost their jobs, thousands of whom had worked in the New York City area and were preparing to move to the Miami area to work at Pan Am&#x27;s new headquarters near Miami International Airport. Economists predicted that 9,000 jobs in the Miami area, including jobs at companies not connected to Pan Am that were dependent on the airline&#x27;s presence, would be lost after it folded. The carrier&#x27;s last flown scheduled operation was Pan Am flight 436 which departed that day from Bridgetown, Barbados, at 2 pm (EST) for Miami under the command of Captain Mark Pyle flying &quot;Clipper Goodwill&quot;, a Boeing 727-200 (N368PA).

Delta was sued for more than $2.5 billion on December 9, 1991, by the Pan Am Creditors Committee. Shortly thereafter, a large group of former Pan Am employees sued Delta. In December 1994, a federal judge ruled in favor of Delta, concluding that it was not liable for Pan Am&#x27;s demise.

Pan Am was the third American major airline to shut down in 1991, after Eastern Air Lines and Midway Airlines.

After serving only two months as Pan Am&#x27;s CEO, Ray was replaced by Peter McHugh to supervise the sale of Pan Am&#x27;s remaining assets by Pan Am&#x27;s Creditor&#x27;s Committee. Pan Am&#x27;s last remaining hub (at Miami International Airport) was split during the following years between United Airlines and American Airlines. TWA&#x27;s Carl Icahn purchased Pan Am Express at a court ordered bankruptcy auction for $13 million, renaming it Trans World Express. The Pan Am brand was sold to Charles Cobb, CEO of Cobb Partners and former United States Ambassador to the Republic of Iceland under President George H.W. Bush and Under Secretary of the US Department of Commerce under President Reagan. Cobb, along with Hanna-Frost partners invested in a new Pan American World Airways headed by veteran airline executive Martin R. Shugrue Jr, a former Pan Am executive with 20 years of experience at the original carrier.

In his book, &quot;Pan Am: An Aviation Legend&quot;, Barnaby Conrad III contends that the collapse of the original Pan Am was a combination of corporate mismanagement, government indifference to protecting its prime international carrier, and flawed regulatory policy. He cites an observation made by former Pan Am Vice President for External Affairs, Stanley Gewirtz:

Under the terms of bankruptcy, the airline&#x27;s International Flight Academy in Miami was permitted to remain open. It was established as an independent training organization beginning in 1992 under its current name, Pan Am International Flight Academy. The company began operating by using the flight simulation and type rating training center of the defunct Pan Am. In 2006, American Capital Strategies invested $58 million into the academy. Owned by the parent of Japanese airline All Nippon Airways as of October 2014, Pan Am International Flight Academy is the only surviving division of Pan American World Airways.

==Reuse of name==
Aside from the aforementioned flight academy, the Pan Am brand has been resurrected four times since 1991, but the reincarnations were related to the original Pan Am in name only.

===Airlines===
Pan American World Airways trademarks and some assets were purchased by Eclipse Holdings, Inc., at an auction by the US Bankruptcy Court on December 2–3, 1993. The scheduled airline rights were sold to Pan American Airways on December 20–29, 1993, by Eclipse Holdings, which was to retain the Pan Am charter rights and operate through its subsidiary, Pan Am Charters, Inc., now Airways Corporation.

The first reincarnation of the original Pan Am operated from 1996 to 1998, with a focus on low-cost, long-distance flights between the United States and the Caribbean with the IATA airline designator &quot;PN&quot;. Eclipse Holdings (Pan Am II) later rescinded the Asset Purchase Agreement for cause and issued a cease and desist in January 1996, affecting all downstream transactions thereafter (as noted in US DOT proceeding OST-99-5945, and SEC 10-Q dated August 24, 1997, Plan of Reorganization (S.D. FL), and others).

The second was unrelated to the first and was a small regional carrier based in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, which operated between 1998 and 2004. It found its niche in operating usually at smaller airports near major ones, such as Pease International (Portsmouth), and Gary Municipal Airport in Indiana. It used the IATA code &quot;PA&quot;, and the ICAO code &quot;PAA&quot;.

Boston-Maine Airways, a sister company of the second reincarnation, operated the &quot;Pan Am Clipper Connection&quot; brand from 2004 to February 2008. A domestic airline in the Dominican Republic, descended from the company&#x27;s first reincarnation, traded until March 23, 2012, as Pan Am Dominicana.

In November 2010, Pan American Airways, Incorporated, was resurrected for the fifth time by World-Wide Consolidated Logistics, Inc. The reincarnated operator is based at Brownsville/South Padre Island International Airport in Brownsville, Texas. The airline&#x27;s inaugural flight was to Monterrey, Mexico, on November 12, 2010. The airline had said it would carry cargo only at first but intended to announce passenger service by 2011. Due to serious legal charges that were laid against the company&#x27;s CEO Robert L. Hedrick in 2012, including child pornography charges for which he was eventually convicted, the company lost its bid with the FAA to pursue passenger or cargo flights of any kind.

In 2025, Pan Am will return with a short lived charter service, with the help of the Pan Am museum. These transatlantic routes will start on June 27, and will end on July 8, with a charter Boeing 757-200 with a Business class 50 seat configuration.

===Railways===
In 1998, Guilford Transportation Industries purchased Pan American World Airways and all related naming rights and intellectual properties. The railway was later operated as Pan Am Railways. In 2022, the company was acquired by CSX Corporation.

=== Apparel ===
Korean fashion company SJ Group opened a Pan Am flagship store in Seoul in 2022 after acquiring a license to produce Pan Am-branded apparel and accessories.

=== Other ===
In 2020, Funko Games released a &quot;Pan Am&quot; board game, in which players play as airlines in competition with Pan Am.

In 2022, Timex released an exclusive watch with Pan Am branding. Due to the popularity, it was re-released in 2023.

== Record-setting flights ==
At the outbreak of the war in the Pacific in December 1941, the &quot;Pacific Clipper&quot; was en route to New Zealand from San Francisco. Rather than risk flying back to Honolulu and being shot down by Japanese fighters, it was directed to fly west to New York. Starting on December 8, 1941, at Auckland, New Zealand, the &quot;Pacific Clipper&quot; covered over 31,500 miles (50,694 km), with stops including Surabaya, Karachi, Bahrain, Khartoum and Leopoldville. The &quot;Pacific Clipper&quot; landed at Pan American&#x27;s LaGuardia Field seaplane base at 7:12 on the morning of January 6, 1942, completing the first commercial plane flight to circumnavigate the world.

During the mid-1970s, Pan Am set two round-the-world records. Liberty Bell Express, a Boeing 747SP-21 named &quot;Clipper Liberty Bell&quot;, broke the commercial round-the-world record set by a Flying Tiger Line Boeing 707 with a new record of 46 hours, 50 seconds. The flight left New York-JFK on May 1, 1976, and returned on May 3. The flight stopped only in New Delhi and Tokyo, where a strike among the airport workers delayed it two hours. The flight beat the Flying Tiger Line&#x27;s record by 16 hours 24 minutes.

In 1977, to commemorate its 50th birthday, Pan Am organized Flight 50, a round-the-world flight from San Francisco to San Francisco, this time over the North Pole and the South Pole with stops in London Heathrow, Cape Town Airport and Auckland Airport. 747SP-21 &quot;Clipper New Horizons&quot; was the former &quot;Liberty Bell&quot;, making the plane the only one to go around the globe over the Equator and the poles. The flight made it in 54 hours, 7 minutes, and 12 seconds, creating seven new world records certified by the FAI. Captain Walter H. Mullikin, who commanded this flight, also commanded the Liberty Bell Express flight.

==Corporate affairs==
For much of its history the corporate headquarters were the Pan Am Building in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.

When Juan Trippe had the company offices relocated to New York City, he rented space in a building on 42nd Street. This facility was across from the Grand Central Terminal. From a period in the 1930s until 1963, the airline headquarters were in the Chrysler Building on 135 East 42nd Street, also in Midtown Manhattan.

In September 1960 Trippe and developer Erwin Wolfson signed a lease agreement for the airline to occupy worth of space for the headquarters, totaling about 15 floors, and a new main ticket office at the intersection of 45th Street and Vanderbilt Avenue. At the time, the 30-year lease in the Chrysler Building was nearing the end of its life. The new lease was scheduled for 25 years.

==In popular culture==

Pan Am held a lofty position in the popular culture of the Cold War era. One of the most famous images in which a Pan Am plane formed a backdrop was the Beatles&#x27; February 7, 1964, arrival at John F. Kennedy Airport aboard a Pan Am Boeing 707-321, &quot;Clipper Defiance&quot;.

From 1964 to 1968, con artist Frank Abagnale Jr., claims to have masqueraded as a Pan Am pilot while still a minor, dead-heading to many destinations in the cockpit jump seat. He also claims to have used Pan Am&#x27;s preferred hotels, paid the bills with bogus checks, and later cashed fake payroll checks in Pan Am&#x27;s name. Abagnale and his co-author Stan Redding documented this era in the memoir &quot;Catch Me if You Can&quot;, which became a film in 2002. Abagnale called Pan Am the &quot;Ritz-Carlton of airlines&quot;, and noted that the days of luxury in airline travel were over. However, in 2021, journalist Alan C. Logan asserted that Frank Abagnale&#x27;s claims were for the most part fabrications. Logan claims that Abagnale spent most of his late teenage years in prison, and had only written a handful of false Pan Am checks that were rapidly detected as false, and landed him back in prison.

In August 1964, Pan Am accepted the reservation of Gerhard Pistor, a journalist from Vienna, Austria, as the first passenger for future flights to the Moon. He paid a deposit of 500 Austrian Schillings (roughly US$20 at the time). About 93,000 people followed on the Pan Am waiting list, called &quot;First Moon Flights Club&quot;. Pan Am expected the flight to depart about 2000.

A fictional Pan Am &quot;Space Clipper&quot;, a commercial spaceplane called the &quot;Orion III&quot;, had a prominent role in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and was featured prominently in one of the movie&#x27;s posters. Plastic models of the 2001 Pan Am Space Clipper were sold by both the Aurora Company and Airfix at the time of the film&#x27;s release in 1968. A satire of the movie by &quot;Mad&quot; magazine in 1968 showed Pan Am female flight attendants in &quot;Actionwear by Monsanto&quot; outfits as they joked about the problems their passengers faced while vomiting in zero gravity. The film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;2010&quot;, also featured Pan Am in a background television commercial in the home of David Bowman&#x27;s widow with the slogan, &quot;At Pan Am, the sky is no longer the limit.&quot;

The airline appeared in other movies, notably in several James Bond films. The company&#x27;s Boeing 707s were featured in &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962) and &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963), while a Pan Am 747 and the Worldport appeared in the 1973 film &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;.

A term used in popular psychology is &quot;Pan American (or Pan Am) Smile&quot;. Named after the smile stewardesses gave to passengers in the airline&#x27;s television commercials. It consists of a mouth movement without the activity of facial muscles around the eyes that characterizes a genuine smile.

The 1982 film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; contains several prominent shots of advertisements for Pan Am. The 2017 sequel &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; also shows a Pan Am sign in an establishing shot.

In 2011, ABC announced a new television series based on the lives of a 1960s Pan Am flight crew. The series, titled &quot;Pan Am&quot;, began airing in September 2011. It was canceled in May 2012.

==Flight crews==
Critical to Pan Am&#x27;s success as an airline was the proficiency of its flight crews, who were rigorously trained in long-distance flight, seaplane anchorage and berthing operations, over-water navigation, radio procedure, aircraft repair, and marine tides. During the day, use of the compass while judging drift from sea currents was normal procedure; at night, all flight crews were trained to use celestial navigation. In bad weather, pilots used dead reckoning and timed turns, making successful landings at fogged-in harbors by landing out to sea, then taxiing the plane into port. Many pilots had merchant marine certifications and radio licenses as well as pilot certificates.

A Pan Am flight captain would normally begin his career years earlier as a radio operator or even mechanic, steadily gaining his licenses and working his way up the flight crew roster to navigator, second officer, and first officer. Before World War II, it was not unusual for a captain to make engine repairs at remote locations.

Pan Am&#x27;s mechanics and support staff were similarly trained. Newly hired applicants were frequently paired with experienced flight mechanics in several areas of the company until they had achieved proficiency in all aircraft types. Emphasis was placed on learning to maintain and overhaul aircraft in harsh seaborne environments when faced with logistical difficulties, as might be expected in a small foreign port without an aviation infrastructure or even an adequate road network. Many crews supported repair operations by flying in spare parts to planes stranded overseas, in some cases performing repairs themselves.

She is best known for her roles as Captain Kathryn Janeway in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; and Red in &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;. She first came to attention in the role of Mary Ryan in the daytime soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;. 

Mulgrew is the recipient of a Critics&#x27; Choice Award, a Saturn Award, and an Obie Award, and has also received Golden Globe Award and Primetime Emmy Award nominations.

Beginning in 2021, Mulgrew reprised her role as Janeway in the animated series &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot;.

==Early life==

At the age of 17, Mulgrew was accepted at the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting in New York, conjoined with New York University in New York City. She supported herself by working as a waitress. She left NYU after one year.

==Career==
=== Earlier career (1975–1994) ===
Mulgrew&#x27;s early career included portraying Mary Ryan for two years in the ABC soap &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; (1975). She became a fan favorite and remained associated with the show long after its cancellation. She remained friends with former co-star Ilene Kristen and presented a special &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Award to &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; creator Claire Labine in 1995. While in &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, she also played Emily Webb in the American Shakespeare Theatre production of &quot;Our Town&quot; in Stratford, Connecticut. She played ambitious country singer Garnet McGee in a November 1978 episode of &quot;Dallas&quot;. In 1979–1980, she played Kate Columbo in &quot;Mrs. Columbo&quot;, a spin-off of the detective series &quot;Columbo&quot; created specifically for her, which lasted 13 episodes.

In 1981, Mulgrew co-starred with Richard Burton and Nicholas Clay in the Arthurian love triangle &quot;Lovespell&quot; as Irish princess Isolt, who casts a spell on Mark, King of Cornwall, and his surrogate son, Tristan. In the same year she also co-starred with Pierce Brosnan in the six-hour miniseries &quot;Manions of America&quot;, about Irish immigrants in 19th-century America. In 1985, she appeared in &quot;Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins&quot; as Major Fleming. In 1986, she appeared in a run of &quot;Cheers&quot; episodes as Janet Eldridge. In 1987, she appeared in &quot;Throw Momma from the Train&quot; as Margaret, Billy Crystal&#x27;s character&#x27;s ex-wife.

In 1992, Mulgrew appeared on &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; as Hillary Wheaton, a Toronto-based anchorwoman brought in to replace Murphy during her maternity leave, but who turned out to have the same problem with alcoholism as Brown dealt with at the beginning of the series. Also in 1992, Mulgrew had a guest-starring role as a soap opera star in &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, episode number 170, &quot;Ever After&quot;. At around the same time she guest-starred in three episodes of &quot;&quot; as the terrorist Red Claw.

===&quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; (1994–2001)===

In 1994, Mulgrew received a call to take the part of Captain Kathryn Janeway in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. She had auditioned for the role (originally named Elizabeth Janeway) when producers announced casting. She submitted a videotaped audition which she made in New York City in August 1994. Unhappy with the tape, she auditioned in person a few weeks later. That day, film actress Geneviève Bujold was selected to play Janeway (suggesting Nicole as the character&#x27;s new first name), but left the role after two days of filming, realizing that the amount of work required for an episodic television show was too demanding. Mulgrew was then offered the role, which she accepted, and later suggested Kathryn as the character&#x27;s final first name.

Mulgrew made history in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise when she became the first female captain as a series regular in a leading role. &quot;Voyager&quot; was the first show broadcast on the new UPN channel, the only series renewed after the channel&#x27;s first programming season, and its only show to run for seven seasons. Mulgrew won the Saturn Award for &quot;Best TV Actress&quot; in 1998 for her performances as Janeway.

Mulgrew voiced the character of Janeway for various &quot;Star Trek&quot; video games: &quot;Star Trek: Captain&#x27;s Chair&quot;, a virtual-reality tour of various Starfleet vessels for home computers; the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager – Elite Force&quot; series; &quot;Star Trek: Legacy&quot;, which featured all of the captains up to that point (2006); and &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;.

About her years on &quot;Voyager&quot;, Mulgrew said:
I&#x27;m proud of it. It was difficult; it was hard work. I&#x27;m proud of the work because I think I made some minor difference in women in science. I grew to really love &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, and out of a cast of nine, I&#x27;ve made three great friends, I managed to raise two children. I think, &quot;It&#x27;s good. I used myself well.&quot;

Speaking about the best and worst part about playing a Star Trek captain, she said:
The best thing was simply the privilege and the challenge of being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one&#x27;s long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had &quot;Star Trek&quot; not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.
During &quot;Voyager&quot;, Mulgrew also played Titania in the animated series &quot;Gargoyles&quot; (with fellow &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors Marina Sirtis and Jonathan Frakes) and Victoria Riddler in the television film &quot;Riddler&#x27;s Moon&quot;.

Since &quot;Voyager&quot; and her subsequent &quot;Star Trek&quot; appearances, Mulgrew has appeared at &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions and events around the world.

She returned to voice the role of Janeway as a training hologram and the real Vice-Admiral Janeway (commanding the &quot;USS Dauntless&quot; and &quot;USS Voyager-A&quot;) in the animated series &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot;.

===After &quot;Voyager&quot; (2001–2012)===

When &quot;Voyager&quot; came to an end after seven full seasons, Mulgrew returned to theater, and in 2003 starred in a one-woman play called &quot;Tea at Five&quot;, a monologue reminiscence based on Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s memoir &quot;Me: Stories of My Life&quot;. &quot;Tea at Five&quot; was a critical success and Mulgrew received two awards, one from Carbonell (Best Actress) and the other from Broadway.com (Audience Award for Favorite Solo Performance). Mulgrew kept active in doing voice-over work for video games, most notably voicing the mysterious Flemeth in the &quot;Dragon Age&quot; video game series, a role she described as &quot;delicious&quot;.

Mulgrew returned to television in 2006, guest-starring in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. Mulgrew performed in &quot;The Exonerated&quot; at the Riverside Studios in London, England.

In early 2007, she appeared in the NBC television series &quot;The Black Donnellys&quot; as Helen Donnelly, which lasted for one season. She also performed the lead role in an off-Broadway production called &quot;Our Leading Lady&quot; written by Charles Busch in which she earned a nomination from the Drama League for her performance. Also in that year, Mulgrew played Clytemnestra in New York for Charles L. Mee&#x27;s &quot;Iphigenia 2.0&quot;. She won the Obie Award for outstanding performance.

In June 2008, Mulgrew appeared in &quot;Equus&quot; on Broadway, playing Hesther Saloman, a public official who is empathetic toward the play&#x27;s central character. The play opened on September 5, 2008, for a limited 22-week engagement through February 8, 2009. Also in 2008, Mulgrew filmed the 30-minute courtroom drama &quot;The Response&quot;, which is based on actual transcripts of the Guantanamo Bay tribunals. It was researched and fully vetted in conjunction with the University of Maryland School of Law and was shot in three days. Mulgrew portrays Colonel Sims and the other cast members, the crew, and she agreed to defer their salaries to cover the production costs. The film has been screened at a number of sites and is available on DVD.

In 2009, Mulgrew appeared in the NBC medical series &quot;Mercy&quot;, playing the recurring role of Jeannie Flanagan (the mother of the show&#x27;s lead, Veronica). Released in 2010, the film &quot;The Best and Brightest&quot;, a comedy based in the world of New York City&#x27;s elite private kindergartens, featured Mulgrew as the Player&#x27;s wife. 

Also in 2010, she starred as Cleopatra in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; at Hartford Stage.

In 2011, Mulgrew appeared in the feature-length documentary &quot;The Captains&quot;. The film, written and directed by William Shatner, follows Shatner as he interviews each of the actors who succeeded him playing a lead-role Starfleet captain within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. During that same year, on another science-fiction series, she began a recurring guest-starring role on the third season of the series &quot;Warehouse 13&quot;, as the mother of one of the main characters.

From July 2011 to December 2013, Mulgrew appeared as the main cast member on Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;&quot; as Kove, the leader of the titular terrorism-fighting unit and ex-wife of series lead Paul Scheer&#x27;s character.

===&quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; and other work (2013–present)===
Mulgrew starred as inmate Galina &quot;Red&quot; Reznikov in the Netflix original series &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;, the role for which she was nominated for her first Primetime Emmy Award in 2014. The popular character was re-signed for seasons two through seven. On working in the series, she was reunited with her &quot;Mercy&quot; co-star Taylor Schilling.

In 2014, Mulgrew narrated a documentary film, &quot;The Principle&quot;, that aims to promote the discredited idea of the geocentric model. Mulgrew said that she was misinformed as to the purpose of the documentary, going on to say &quot;I am not a geocentrist, nor am I in any way a proponent of geocentrism... I do not subscribe to anything Robert Sungenis has written regarding science and history, and had I known of his involvement, would most certainly have avoided this documentary.&quot;

Mulgrew starred in the fall 2024 Off-Broadway production by the Irish Repertory Theatre of &quot;The Beacon&quot; by playwright Nancy Harris.

==Personal life==
Mulgrew became pregnant while acting in the lead role of Mary Ryan in &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;. &quot;I was single, alone, and flooded with terror. But I knew I would have that baby&quot;, Mulgrew said. She placed her daughter for adoption three days after giving birth in 1977, then in later years, searched for her. &quot;The first man who wanted to explore this with me&quot;, said Mulgrew, &quot;was Tim Hagan, who later became my husband.&quot; 

In 1998, Mulgrew received a call from the daughter she had placed for adoption. Her name is Danielle, and she had started searching for Mulgrew a year earlier. In her 2015 memoir &quot;Born with Teeth&quot; (which refers to Mulgrew having been born with a full set of neonatal teeth), Mulgrew tells of her reunion with her daughter in 2001. In 2019, Mulgrew released a second memoir titled &quot;How to Forget&quot;.

Mulgrew married Robert Egan in 1982. They have two children. The couple separated in 1993. Their divorce became final in 1995.

Mulgrew married Tim Hagan, a former Ohio gubernatorial candidate and a former commissioner of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, in April 1999. In an interview on April 15, 2015, Mulgrew stated that she and Hagan were divorced in 2014.

Mulgrew is Catholic and an opponent of capital punishment. She has previously stated that she is an opponent of abortion and received an award from Feminists for Life, an anti-abortion feminist group and is quoted as saying, &quot;Execution as punishment is barbaric and unnecessary&quot;, &quot;Life is sacred to me on all levels&quot;, and &quot;Abortion does not compute with my philosophy.&quot; However, following the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision on &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, Mulgrew came out with the following statement about women&#x27;s choice:&quot;Choice is what lifts us above other animals. If that fundamental right is restricted or removed we are then reduced as a species. 

For myself, abortion was not an alternative, but neither was the possibility of living in a society and under the jurisdiction of a coterie of aging Republican men who somehow think they can understand what it is to have a womb. They can&#x27;t. We must fight for nationwide access to contraception, especially in communities where poverty and race dictate privation. Choice is the fundamental right of every human being, especially women and people who are able to give birth.

We also need more women on the Supreme Court, and we need the conversation between men and women to be better curated than it has ever been before.&quot;Mulgrew is a rape survivor.

Mulgrew is a member of the National Advisory Committee of the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association. Her mother, Joan Mulgrew, died on July 27, 2006, after a long battle with the disease.

<doc id="81036" wikidata="Q186263" url="?curid=81036" title="Dishwasher">
<text>A dishwasher is a machine that is used to clean dishware, cookware, and cutlery automatically. Unlike manual dishwashing, which relies on physical scrubbing to remove soiling, the mechanical dishwasher cleans by spraying hot water, typically between , at the dishes, with lower temperatures of water used for delicate items.

A mix of water and dishwasher detergent is pumped to one or more rotating sprayers, cleaning the dishes with the cleaning mixture. The mixture is recirculated to save water and energy. Often there is a pre-rinse, which may or may not include detergent, and the water is then drained. This is followed by the main wash with fresh water and detergent. Once the wash is finished, the water is drained; more hot water enters the tub by means of an electromechanical solenoid valve, and the rinse cycle(s) begin. After the rinse process finishes, the water is drained again and the dishes are dried using one of several drying methods. Typically a rinse-aid, a chemical to reduce the surface tension of the water, is used to reduce water spots from hard water or other reasons.

In addition to domestic units, industrial dishwashers are available for use in commercial establishments such as hotels and restaurants, where many dishes must be cleaned. Washing is conducted with temperatures of and sanitation is achieved by either the use of a booster heater that will provide an &quot;final rinse&quot; temperature or through the use of a chemical sanitizer.

==History==
The first mechanical dishwashing device was registered for a patent in 1850 in the United States by Joel Houghton. This device was made of wood and was cranked by hand while water sprayed onto the dishes. The device was both slow and unreliable. Another patent was granted to L.A. Alexander in 1865 that was similar to the first but featured a hand-cranked rack system. Neither device was practical or widely accepted. Some historians cite as an obstacle to adoption the historical attitude that valued women for the effort put into housework rather than the results—making household chores easier was perceived by some to reduce their value.

The most successful of the hand-powered dishwashers was invented in 1886 by Josephine Cochrane together with mechanic George Butters in Cochrane&#x27;s tool shed in Shelbyville, Illinois when Cochrane (a wealthy socialite) wanted to protect her china while it was being washed. Their invention was unveiled at the 1893 World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago under the name of Lavadora but was changed to Lavaplatos as another machine invented in 1858 already held that name. Cochrane&#x27;s inspiration was her frustration at the damage to her good china that occurred when her servants handled it during cleaning.

Europe&#x27;s first domestic dishwasher with an electric motor was invented and manufactured by Miele in 1929.

In the United Kingdom, William Howard Livens invented a small, non-electric dishwasher suitable for domestic use in 1924. It was the first dishwasher that incorporated most of the design elements that are featured in the models of today; it included a door for loading, a wire rack to hold the dirty crockery and a rotating sprayer. Drying elements were added to his design in 1940. It was the first machine suitable for domestic use, and it came at a time when permanent plumbing and running water in the home were becoming increasingly common.

Despite this, Liven&#x27;s design did not become a commercial success, and dishwashers were only successfully sold as domestic utilities in the postwar boom of the 1950s, albeit only to the wealthy. Initially, dishwashers were sold as standalone or portable devices, but with the development of the wall-to-wall countertop and standardized height cabinets, dishwashers began to be marketed with standardized sizes and shapes, integrated underneath the kitchen countertop as a modular unit with other kitchen appliances.

By the 1970s, dishwashers had become commonplace in domestic residences in North America and Western Europe. By 2012, over 75 percent of homes in the United States and Germany had dishwashers.

In the late 1990s, manufacturers began offering various new energy conservation features in dishwashers. One feature was use of &quot;soil sensors&quot;, which was a computerized tool in the dishwasher which measured food particles coming from dishes. When the dishwasher had cleaned the dishes to the point of not releasing more food particles, the soil sensor would report the dishes as being clean. The sensor operated with another innovation of using variable washing time. If dishes were especially dirty, then the dishwasher would run for a longer time than if the sensor detected them to be clean. In this way, the dishwasher would save energy and water by only being in operation for as long as needed.

==Design==

===Size and capacity===

Dishwashers that are installed into standard kitchen cabinets have a standard width and depth of 60 cm (Europe) or (US), and most dishwashers must be installed into a hole a minimum of 86 cm (Europe) or (US) tall. Portable dishwashers exist in 45 and 60 cm (Europe) or (US) widths, with casters and attached countertops. There are also dishwashers available in sizes according to the European gastronorm standard. Dishwashers may come in standard or tall tub designs; standard tub dishwashers have a service kickplate beneath the dishwasher door that allows for simpler maintenance and installation, but tall tub dishwashers have approximately 20% more capacity and better sound dampening from having a continuous front door.

The international standard for the capacity of a dishwasher is expressed as standard place settings. Commercial dishwashers are rated as plates per hour. The rating is based on standard-sized plates of the same size. The same can be said for commercial glass washers, as they are based on standard glasses, normally pint glasses.

===Layout===

Present-day machines feature a drop-down front panel door, allowing access to the interior, which usually contains two or sometimes three pull-out racks; racks can also be referred to as &quot;baskets&quot;. In older U.S. models from the 1950s, the entire tub rolled out when the machine latch was opened, and loading as well as removing washable items was from the top, with the user reaching deep into the compartment for some items. Youngstown Kitchens, which manufactured entire kitchen cabinets and sinks, offered a tub-style dishwasher, which was coupled to a conventional kitchen sink as one unit. Most present-day machines allow for placement of dishes, silverware, tall items and cooking utensils in the lower rack, while glassware, cups and saucers are placed in the upper rack. One notable exception were dishwashers produced by the Maytag Corporation from the late sixties until the early nineties. These machines were designed for loading glassware, cups and saucers in the lower rack, while plates, silverware, and tall items were placed into the upper rack. This unique design allowed for a larger capacity and more flexibility in loading of dishes and pots and pans. Today, &quot;dish drawer&quot; models eliminate the inconvenience of the long reach that was necessary with older full-depth models. &quot;Cutlery baskets&quot; are also common. A drawer dishwasher, first introduced by Fisher &amp; Paykel in 1997, is a variant of the dishwasher in which the baskets slide out with the door in the same manner as a drawer filing cabinet, with each drawer in a double-drawer model being able to operate independently of the other.

The inside of a dishwasher in the North American market is either stainless steel or plastic. Most of them are stainless steel body and plastic made racks. Stainless steel tubs resist hard water, and preserve heat to dry dishes more quickly. They also come at a premium price. Dishwashers can be bought for as expensive as $1,500+, but countertop dishwashers are also available for under $300. Older models used baked enamel tubs, while some used a vinyl coating bonded to a steel tub, which provided protection of the tub from acidic foods and provided some sound attenuation. European-made dishwashers feature a stainless steel interior as standard, even on low-end models. The same is true for a built-in water softener.

===Washing elements===
European dishwashers almost universally use two or three sprayers which are fed from the bottom and back wall of the dishwasher, leaving both racks unimpeded. Such models also tend to use inline water heaters, removing the need for exposed elements in the base of the machine that can melt plastic items near to them. Many North American dishwashers tend to use exposed elements in the base of the dishwasher. Some North American machines, primarily those designed by General Electric, use a wash tube, often called a wash-tower, to direct water from the bottom of the dishwasher to the top dish rack. Some dishwashers, including many models from Whirlpool and KitchenAid, use a tube attached to the top rack that connects to a water source at the back of the dishwasher and directs water to a second wash spray beneath the upper rack, which allows full use of the bottom rack. Late-model Frigidaire dishwashers shoot a jet of water from the top of the washer down into the upper wash sprayer, again allowing full use of the bottom rack (but requiring that a small funnel on the top rack be kept clear).

===Features===
Mid-range to higher-end North American dishwashers often come with hard food disposal units, which behave like miniature garbage (waste) disposal units that eliminate large pieces of food waste from the wash water. One manufacturer that is known for omitting hard food disposals is Bosch, a German brand; however, Bosch does so in order to reduce noise. If the larger items of food waste are removed before placing in the dishwasher, pre-rinsing is not necessary even without integrated waste disposal units.

Many new dishwashers feature microprocessor-controlled, sensor-assisted wash cycles that adjust the wash duration to the number of dirty dishes (sensed by changes in water temperature) or the amount of dirt in the rinse water (sensed chemically or optically). This can save water and energy if the user runs a partial load. In such dishwashers the electromechanical rotary switch often used to control the washing cycle is replaced by a microprocessor, but most sensors and valves are still required. However, pressure switches (some dishwashers use a pressure switch and flow meter) are not required in most microprocessor controlled dishwashers as they use the motor and sometimes a rotational position sensor to sense the resistance of water; when it senses there is no cavitation it knows it has the optimal amount of water. A bimetal switch or wax motor opens the detergent door during the wash cycle.

Some dishwashers include a child-lockout feature to prevent accidental starting or stopping of the wash cycle by children. A child lock can sometimes be included to prevent young children from opening the door during a wash cycle. This prevents accidents with hot water and strong detergents used during the wash cycle.

==Process==

===Energy use and water temperatures===
In the European Union, the energy consumption of a dishwasher for a standard usage is shown on a European Union energy label. In the United States, the energy consumption of a dishwasher is defined using the energy factor.

The current energy usage criteria for dishwashers, to achieve Energy Star certification, are ≤ 270 kWh/year for standard dishwashers, and ≤ 203 kWh/year for compact dishwashers.

Most consumer dishwashers use a thermostat in the sanitizing process. During the final rinse cycle, the heating element and wash pump are turned on, and the cycle timer (electronic or electromechanical) is stopped until the thermostat is tripped. At this point, the cycle timer resumes and will generally trigger a drain cycle within a few timer increments.

Most consumer dishwashers use rather than for reasons of burn risk, energy and water consumption, total cycle time, and possible damage to plastic items placed inside the dishwasher. With new advances in detergents, lower water temperatures () are needed to prevent premature decay of the enzymes used to eat the grease and other build-ups on the dishes.

In the US, residential dishwashers can be certified to a NSF International testing protocol which confirms the cleaning and sanitation performance of the unit.

Superheated steam dishwashers can kill 99% of bacteria on a plate in just 25 seconds.

===Drying===
The heat inside the dishwasher dries the contents after the final hot rinse. North American dishwashers tend to use heat-assisted drying via an exposed element which tends to be less efficient than other methods. European machines and some high-end North American machines use passive methods for drying – a stainless steel interior helps this process and some models use heat exchange technology between the inner and outer skin of the machine to cool the walls of the interior and speed up drying. Some dishwashers employ desiccants such as zeolite which at the beginning of the wash are heated, dry out and creating steam which warms plates, and then are cooled during the dry cycle which absorbs moisture again, saving significant energy.

Plastic and non-stick items form drops with smaller surface area and may not dry properly compared to china and glass. Some dishwashers incorporate a fan to improve drying. Older dishwashers with a visible heating element (at the bottom of the wash cabinet, below the bottom basket) may use the heating element to improve drying; however, this uses more energy.

Most importantly however, the final rinse adds a small amount of rinse-aid to the hot water, this is a mild detergent that improves drying significantly by reducing the inherent surface tension of the water so that water mostly drips off, greatly improving how well all items, including plastic items, dry.

Most dishwashers feature a drying sensor and as such, a dish-washing cycle is always considered complete when a drying indicator, usually in the form of an illuminated &quot;end&quot; light, or in more modern models on a digital display or audible sound, exhibits to the operator that the washing and drying cycle is now over.

US governmental agencies often recommend air-drying dishes by either disabling or stopping the drying cycle to save energy.

==Differences between dishwashers and hand washing==

===Dishwasher detergent===

Dishwashers are designed to work using specially formulated dishwasher detergent. Over time, many regions have banned the use of phosphates in detergent and phosphorus-based compounds. They were previously used because they have properties that aid in effective cleaning. The concern was the increase in algal blooms in waterways caused by increasing phosphate levels (see eutrophication). Seventeen US states have partial or full bans on the use of phosphates in dish detergent, and two US states (Maryland and New York) ban phosphates in commercial dishwashing. Detergent companies claimed it is not cost effective to make separate batches of detergent for the states with phosphate bans, and so most have voluntarily removed phosphates from all dishwasher detergents.

In addition, rinse aids have contained nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates. These have been banned in the European Union by EU Directive 76/769/EEC.

In some regions, depending on water hardness, a dishwasher might function better with the use of a dishwasher salt.

===Glassware===
Glassware washed by dishwashing machines can develop a white haze on the surface over time. This may be caused by any or all of the below processes, of which only the first is reversible:
; Deposition of minerals: Calcium carbonate (limescale) in hard water can deposit and build up on surfaces when water dries. The deposits can be dissolved by vinegar or another acid. Dishwashers often include ion exchange device to remove calcium and magnesium ions and replace them with sodium. The resultant sodium salts are water-soluble and don&#x27;t tend to build up.
; Silicate filming, etching, and accelerated crack corrosion: This film starts as an iridescence or &quot;oil-film&quot; effect on glassware, and progresses into a &quot;milky&quot; or &quot;cloudy&quot; appearance (which is not a deposit) that cannot be polished off or removed like limescale. It is formed because the detergent is strongly alkaline (basic) and glass dissolves slowly in alkaline aqueous solution. It becomes less soluble in the presence of silicates in the water (added as anti-metal-corrosion agents in the dishwasher detergent). Since the cloudy appearance is due to nonuniform glass dissolution, it is (somewhat paradoxically) &quot;less&quot; marked if dissolution is higher, i.e. if a silicate-free detergent is used; also, in certain cases, the etching will primarily be seen in areas that have microscopic surface cracks as a result of the items&#x27; manufacturing. Limitation of this undesirable reaction is possible by controlling water hardness, detergent load and temperature. The type of glass is an important factor in determining if this effect is a problem. Some dishwashers can reduce this etching effect by automatically dispensing the correct amount of detergent throughout the wash cycle based on the level of water hardness programmed.
; Dissolution of lead: Lead in lead crystal can be converted into a soluble form by the high temperatures and strong alkali detergents of dishwashers, which could endanger the health of subsequent users.

===Other materials===
Other materials besides glass are also harmed by the strong detergents, strong agitation, and high temperatures of dishwashers, especially on a hot wash cycle when temperatures can reach . Aluminium, brass, and copper items will discolor, and light aluminum containers will mark other items they knock into. Nonstick pan coatings will deteriorate. Glossy, gold-colored, and hand-painted items will be dulled or fade. Fragile items and sharp edges will be dulled or damaged from colliding with other items or thermal stress. Sterling silver and pewter will oxidize and discolour from the heat and from contact with metals lower on the galvanic series such as stainless steel. Pewter has a low melting point and may warp in some dishwashers. Glued items, such as hollow-handle knives or wooden cutting boards, will melt or soften in a dishwasher; high temperatures and moisture damage wood. High temperatures damage many plastics, especially in the bottom rack close to an exposed heating element (many newer dishwashers have a concealed heating element away from the bottom rack entirely). Squeezing plastic items into small spaces may cause the plastic to distort in shape. Cast iron cookware is normally seasoned with oil or grease and heat, which causes the oil or grease to be absorbed into the pores of the cookware, thereby giving a smooth relatively non-stick cooking surface which is stripped off by the combination of alkali based detergent and hot water in a dishwasher.
Knives and other cooking tools that are made of carbon steel, semi-stainless steels like D2, or specialized, highly hardened cutlery steels like ZDP189 corrode in the extended moisture bath of dishwashers, compared to briefer baths of hand washing. Cookware is made of austenitic stainless steels, which are more stable.
Items contaminated by chemicals such as wax, cigarette ash, poisons, mineral oils, wet paints, oiled tools, furnace filters, etc. can contaminate a dishwasher, since the surfaces inside small water passages cannot be wiped clean as surfaces are in hand-washing, so contaminants remain to affect future loads. Objects contaminated by solvents may explode in a dishwasher.

===Environmental comparison===
Dishwashers use less water, and therefore less fuel to heat the water, than hand washing, except for small quantities washed in wash bowls without running water.

Hand-washing techniques vary by individual. According to a peer-reviewed study in 2003, hand washing and drying of an amount of dishes equivalent to a fully loaded automatic dishwasher (no cookware or bakeware) could use between of water and between 0.1 and 8 kWh of energy, while the numbers for energy-efficient automatic dishwashers were and 1 to 2 kWh, respectively. The study concluded that fully loaded dishwashers use less energy, water, and detergent than the average European hand-washer. For the automatic dishwasher results, the dishes were not rinsed before being loaded. The study does not address costs associated with the manufacture and disposal of dishwashers, the cost of possible accelerated wear of dishes from the chemical harshness of dishwasher detergent, the comparison for cleaning cookware, or the value of labour saved; hand washers needed between 65 and 106 minutes. Several points of criticism on this study have been raised. For example, kilowatt hours of electricity were compared against energy used for heating hot water without taking into account possible inefficiencies. Also, inefficient handwashings were compared against optimal usage of a fully loaded dishwasher without manual pre-rinsing that can take up to of water.

A 2009 study showed that the microwave and the dishwasher were both more effective ways to clean domestic sponges than handwashing.

==Adoption==

===Commercial use===

Large heavy-duty dishwashers are available for use in commercial establishments (e.g. hotels, restaurants) where many dishes must be cleaned.

Unlike a residential dishwasher, a commercial dishwasher does not utilize a drying cycle (commercial drying is achieved by heated ware meeting open air once the wash/rinse/sanitation cycles have been completed) and thus are significantly faster than their residential counterparts. Washing is conducted with temperatures and sanitation is achieved by either the use of a booster heater that will provide the machine &quot;final rinse&quot; temperature or through the use of a chemical sanitizer. This distinction labels the machines as either &quot;high-temp&quot; or &quot;low-temp&quot;.

Some commercial dishwashers work similarly to a commercial car wash, with a pulley system that pulls the rack through a small chamber (known widely as a &quot;rack conveyor&quot; systems). Single-rack washers require an operator to push the rack into the washer, close the doors, start the cycle, and then open the doors to pull out the cleaned rack, possibly through a second opening into an unloading area.

In the UK, the British Standards Institution set standards for dishwashers. In the US, NSF International (an independent not-for-profit organization) sets the standards for wash and rinse time along with minimum water temperature for chemical or hot-water sanitizing methods. There are many types of commercial dishwashers including under-counter, single tank, conveyor, flight type, and carousel machines.

Commercial dishwashers often have significantly different plumbing and operations than a home unit, in that there are often separate sprayers for washing and rinsing/sanitizing. The wash water is heated with an in-tank electric heat element and mixed with a cleaning solution, and is used repeatedly from one load to the next. The wash tank usually has a large strainer basket to collect food debris, and the strainer may not be emptied until the end of the day&#x27;s kitchen operations.

Water used for rinsing and sanitizing is generally delivered directly through building water supply and is not reusable. However, commercial dishwashers excel in water efficiency, with some models using less than 0.4 gallons of water per rack. Used rinse water empties into the wash tank reservoir, which dilutes some of the used wash water and causes a small amount to drain out through an overflow tube. The system may first rinse with pure water only and then sanitize with an additive solution that is left on the dishes as they leave the washer to dry.

Additional soap is periodically added to the main wash water tank, from either large soap concentrate tanks or dissolved from a large solid soap block, to maintain wash water cleaning effectiveness.

==Alternative uses==

Dishwashers can be used to cook foods at low temperatures (e.g. dishwasher salmon).
The foods are generally sealed in canning jars or oven bags since even a dishwasher cycle without soap can deposit residual soap and rinse aid from previous cycles on unsealed foods.

Dishwashers also have been documented to be used to clean potatoes, other root vegetables, garden tools, sneakers or trainers, silk flowers, some sporting goods, plastic hairbrushes, baseball caps, plastic toys, toothbrushes, flip-flops, contact lens cases, a mesh filter from a range hood, refrigerator shelves and bins, toothbrush holders, pet bowls and pet toys.
Cleaning vegetables and plastics is controversial since vegetables can be contaminated by soap and rinse aid from previous cycles and the heat of most standard dishwashers can cause BPA or phthalates to leach out of plastic products. The use of a dishwasher to clean greasy tools and parts is not recommended as the grease can clog the dishwasher.

<text>Grim Fandango is a 1998 adventure game directed by Tim Schafer and developed and published by LucasArts for Microsoft Windows. It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use 3D computer graphics overlaid on pre-rendered static backgrounds. As with other LucasArts adventure games, the player must converse with characters and examine, collect, and use objects to solve puzzles.

&quot;Grim Fandango&quot; is set in the Land of the Dead and the retro-futuristic version of the 1950s, through which recently departed souls, represented as &quot;calaca&quot;-like figures, travel before they reach their final destination. The story follows travel agent Manuel &quot;Manny&quot; Calavera as he attempts to save new arrival Mercedes &quot;Meche&quot; Colomar, a virtuous soul, on her journey. The game combines elements of the Aztec afterlife with &quot;film noir&quot; style, with influences including &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; and &quot;Casablanca&quot;.

&quot;Grim Fandango&quot; received praise for its art design and direction. It was selected for several awards and is often listed as one of the greatest video games of all time. However, it was a commercial failure and contributed towards LucasArts&#x27; decision to end adventure game development and the decline of the adventure game genre.

In 2014, with help from Sony, Schafer&#x27;s studio Double Fine Productions acquired the &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; license following Disney&#x27;s acquisition and closure of LucasArts as a video game developer the previous year. Double Fine produced a remastered version of the game, featuring improved character graphics, controls (including point and click), an orchestrated score, and directors&#x27; commentary. It was released for Linux, OS X, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Windows in January 2015, for Android and iOS in May 2015, for Nintendo Switch in November 2018, and for Xbox One in October 2020.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Grim Fandango&quot; is an adventure game, in which the player controls Manuel &quot;Manny&quot; Calavera (&quot;calavera&quot; being Spanish for &#x27;skull&#x27;) as he follows Mercedes &quot;Meche&quot; Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the GrimE engine, pre-rendering static backgrounds from 3D models, while the main objects and characters are animated in 3D. Additionally, cutscenes in the game have also been pre-rendered in 3D. The player controls Manny&#x27;s movements and actions with a keyboard, a joystick, or a gamepad. The remastered edition allows control via a mouse as well. Manny must collect objects that can be used with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. The game lacks any type of HUD. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games, the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them, but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head toward that object or person as he walks by. The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item in and out of his coat jacket. Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in most LucasArts adventure games, the player can never die or otherwise get into a no-win situation (that prevents completion of the game).

== Synopsis ==
=== Setting ===
&quot;Grim Fandango&quot; takes place in the Land of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where recently departed souls aim to make their way to the Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld) on the Four Year Journey of the Soul. Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages, provided by the Department of Death, to assist in making the journey (such as sports cars and luxury ocean cruises), the best of which is the Number Nine, an express train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. However, souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs and stay in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the Land of the Living to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.

The souls in the Land of the Dead appear as skeletal &quot;calaca&quot; figures. Alongside them are demons that have been summoned to help with the more mundane tasks of day-to-day life, such as vehicle maintenance and even drink service. The souls themselves can suffer death-within-death by being &quot;sprouted&quot;, the result of being shot with &quot;sproutella&quot;-filled darts that cause flowers to grow out through bones, rapidly feeding off the calcium of the soul&#x27;s skeleton. The ones who are sprouted are reincarnated. Many of the characters are Mexican and occasional Spanish words are interspersed into the English dialogue, resulting in Spanglish. Many of the characters smoke, following a film noir tradition; the manual asks players to consider that every smoker in the game is dead.

=== Plot ===
The game is divided into four acts, each taking place on November 2 (the Day of the Dead) in four consecutive years. 

Manuel &quot;Manny&quot; Calavera is a travel agent at the Department of Death in the city of El Marrow, forced into his job to work off a debt &quot;to the powers that be&quot;. Manny is frustrated with being assigned clients that must take the four-year journey due to their poor living choices and is threatened to be fired by his boss, Don Copal, if he does not come up with better clients. Manny steals a client, Mercedes &quot;Meche&quot; Colomar, from his successful co-worker Domino Hurley. The Department computers assign Meche to the four-year journey even though Manny believes she should have a guaranteed spot on the &quot;Number Nine&quot; luxury express train due to her pureness of heart in her life. When Manny goes to his boss while asking Meche to wait for him fixing the issue, Meche starts her journey on foot herself. Don Copal uses it as a reason to arrest Manny. Manny is freed from arrest and sprouting by Salvador &quot;Sal&quot; Limones, the leader of the small underground organization the Lost Souls Alliance (LSA), who warns him of Domino and Don rigging the system to deny many clients Double N tickets, hoarding them for the boss of the criminal underworld, Hector LeMans. LeMans then sells the tickets at an exorbitant price to those that can afford it. Sal recruits Manny to help LSA by setting up a system of pigeon mail and providing the group with biometrics of Manny in order to access the computer systems of the Department. Manny recognizes that he cannot stop Hector at present and instead, with the help of his driver and speed demon Glottis, he tries to find Meche on her journey in the nearby Petrified Forest. Manny arrives at the small port city of Rubacava and finds that he has beaten Meche there, and waits for her to arrive.

A year passes, and the city of Rubacava has grown. Manny now runs his own nightclub off a converted automat near the edge of the Forest. Manny sees Meche leaving the port with Domino, but when he tries to stop them, he is stopped by Meche. Manny learns from Olivia Ofrenda, the owner of the beatnik Blue Casket nightclub, that Don has been sprouted for letting the scandal be known.

Manny gives chase, manages to get on board of a leaving ship as a janitor, and a year later (after being promoted to a captain) tracks them to a coral mining plant on the Edge of the World. Domino has been holding Meche there as a trap to lure Manny. All of Domino&#x27;s clients who had their tickets stolen are also being held there and used as slave labor, both to make a profit with the coral mining and as a way to keep Hector&#x27;s scandal quiet. Domino tries to convince Manny to take over his position in the plant seeing as he has no alternative and can spend the rest of eternity with Meche but he refuses. After rescuing Meche, Manny defeats Domino by causing him to fall into a rock crusher. Manny, along with Meche, Glottis and a few of the souls being held at the plant then escape from the Edge of the World.

The three travel for another year until they reach the terminus for the Number Nine train before the Ninth Underworld. The Gate Keeper to the Ninth Underworld won&#x27;t let the souls progress without their tickets, mistakenly believing they have sold them, and it&#x27;s further revealed that a wicked soul that has either not paid off their debt or tried to cheat the Gate Keeper with a fake or stolen Double N Ticket to gain entrance to the Ninth Underworld will cause the express train to transform into the hell train (which sends all souls on board to hell). Meanwhile, Glottis has fallen deathly ill. Manny learns from demons stationed at the terminus that the only way to revive Glottis is to travel at high speeds to restore Glottis&#x27; purpose for being summoned. Manny and the others devise a makeshift fuel source to create a &quot;rocket&quot; train cart, quickly taking Manny and Meche back to Rubacava and saving Glottis&#x27; life. The three return to El Marrow, now found to be fully in Hector&#x27;s control and renamed as Nuevo Marrow. Manny regroups with Sal and his expanded LSA and with the help of Olivia, who volunteered to join the gang earlier in Rubacava, and is able to learn about Hector&#x27;s current activities. Further investigation reveals that Hector not only has been hoarding the Number Nine tickets, but has created counterfeit versions that he has sold to others while keeping the real tickets for himself in a desperate attempt to balance out his sinful life and get out of the Land of the Dead. Manny tries to confront Hector but is lured into another trap by Olivia, who is revealed to be Hector&#x27;s girlfriend, who has also captured Sal, and is taken to Hector&#x27;s greenhouse to be sprouted. Manny is able to defeat Hector after Sal sacrifices himself to prevent Olivia from interfering. 

Manny and Meche are able to find the real Double N tickets, including the one that Meche should have received. Manny makes sure the rest of the tickets are given to their rightful owners; in turn, he is granted his own ticket for his good deeds. Together, Manny and Meche board the Number Nine for their happy journey to the Ninth Underworld while Glottis waves tearfully goodbye.

== Development ==
===Background and project inception===
&quot;Grim Fandango&quot; development was led by project leader Tim Schafer, co-designer of &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot; and creator of &quot;Full Throttle&quot; and the more recent &quot;Psychonauts&quot; and &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;. Schafer had conceived a Day of the Dead-themed adventure before production of &quot;Full Throttle&quot; began, and he submitted both concepts to LucasArts for approval at the same time. &quot;Full Throttle&quot; was accepted instead because of its greater mainstream appeal; it became a hit and opened the way for Schafer to create &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;. &quot;Rogue Leaders: The Story of LucasArts&quot; noted that the pitching process for &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; was &quot;a breeze&quot; because of Schafer&#x27;s earlier success, despite the new project&#x27;s unusual theme.

Development began soon after the completion of &quot;Full Throttle&quot; in June 1995. &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; was an attempt by LucasArts to rejuvenate the graphic adventure genre, in decline by 1998. In response to complaints that &quot;Full Throttle&quot; was too short, Schafer set the goal of having twice as many puzzles as &quot;Full Throttle&quot;, which demanded a more lengthy and ambitious story to accommodate them. According to Schafer, the game was developed on a $3 million budget. It was the first LucasArts adventure since &quot;&quot; not to use the SCUMM engine, instead using the Sith engine, pioneered by &quot;Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II&quot;, as the basis of the new GrimE engine. The GrimE engine was built using the scripting language Lua. This design decision was due to LucasArts programmer Bret Mogilefsky&#x27;s interest in the language, and is considered one of the first uses of Lua in gaming applications. The game&#x27;s success led to the language&#x27;s use in many other games and applications, including &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;.

===3D design===
&quot;Grim Fandango&quot; mixed static pre-rendered background images with 3D characters and objects. Part of this decision was based on how the &quot;calaca&quot; figures would appear in three dimensions. There were more than 90 sets and 50 characters in the game to be created and rendered; Manny&#x27;s character alone comprised 250 polygons. The development team found that by utilizing three-dimensional models to pre-render the backgrounds, they could alter the camera shot to achieve more effective or dramatic angles for certain scenes simply by re-rendering the background, instead of having to have an artist redraw the background for a traditional 2D adventure game. The team adapted the engine to allow Manny&#x27;s head to move separately from his body to make the player aware of important objects nearby. The 3D engine also aided in the choreography between the spoken dialog and body and arm movements of the characters. Additionally, full motion video cutscenes were incorporated to advance the plot, using the same in-game style for the characters and backgrounds to make them nearly indistinguishable from the actual game.

===Themes and influences===
The game combines several Aztec beliefs of the afterlife and underworld with 1930s Art Deco design motifs and a dark plot reminiscent of the film noir genre. The Aztec motifs of the game were influenced by Schafer&#x27;s decade-long fascination with folklore, stemming from an anthropology class he took at University of California Berkeley, and talks with folklorist Alan Dundes, with Schafer recognizing that the four-year journey of the soul in the afterlife would set the stage for an adventure game. Schafer stated that once he had set on the Afterlife setting: &quot;Then I thought, what role would a person want to play in a Day of the Dead scenario? You&#x27;d want to be the grim reaper himself. That&#x27;s how Manny got his job. Then I imagined him picking up people in the land of the living and bringing them to the land of the dead, like he&#x27;s really just a glorified limo or taxi driver. So the idea came of Manny having this really mundane job that looks glamorous because he has the robe and the scythe, but really, he&#x27;s just punching the clock&quot;. Schafer recounted a Mexican folklore about how the dead were buried with two bags of gold to be used in the afterlife, one on their chest and one hidden in their coffin, such that if the spirits in the afterlife stole the one on the chest, they would still have the hidden bag of gold; this idea of a criminal element in the afterlife led to the idea of a crime-ridden, film noir style to the world. The division of the game into four years was a way of breaking the game&#x27;s overall puzzle into four discrete sections. Each year was divided into several non-linear branches of puzzles that all had to be solved before the player could progress to the next year.

Schafer opted to give the conversation-heavy game the flavor of film noir set in the 1930s and 1940s, stating that &quot;there&#x27;s something that I feel is really honest about the way people talked that&#x27;s different than modern movies&quot;. He was partially inspired by novels written by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. Several film noir movies were also inspiration for much of the game&#x27;s plot and characters. Tim Schafer stated that the true inspiration was drawn from films like &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, in which a weak and undistinguished insurance salesman finds himself entangled in a murder plot. The design and early plot are fashioned after films such as &quot;Chinatown&quot; and &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;. Several scenes in &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; are directly inspired by the genre&#x27;s films such as &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, &quot;The Third Man&quot;, &quot;Key Largo&quot;, and most notably &quot;Casablanca&quot;: two characters in the game&#x27;s second act are directly modeled after the roles played by Peter Lorre and Claude Rains in the film. The main villain, Hector LeMans, was designed to resemble Sydney Greenstreet&#x27;s character of Signor Ferrari from &quot;Casablanca&quot;. His voice was also modeled after Greenstreet, complete with his trademark chuckle.

Visually, the game drew inspiration from various sources: the skeletal character designs were based largely on the &quot;calaca&quot; figures used in Mexican Day of the Dead festivities, while the architecture ranged from Art Deco skyscrapers to an Aztec temple. The team turned to LucasArts artist Peter Chan to create the &quot;calaca&quot; figures. The art of Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth was used as inspiration for the designs of the hot rods and the demon characters like Glottis.

Originally, Schafer had come up with the name &quot;Deeds of the Dead&quot; for the game&#x27;s title, as he had originally planned Manny to be a real estate agent in the Land of the Dead. Other potential titles included &quot;The Long Siesta&quot; and &quot;Dirt Nap&quot;, before he came up with the title &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;.

===Voice cast===

The game featured a large cast for voice acting in the game&#x27;s dialog and cutscenes, employing many Latino actors to help with the Spanish slang. Voice actors included Tony Plana as Manny, Maria Canals-Barrera as Meche, Alan Blumenfeld as Glottis, and Jim Ward as Hector. Schafer credits Plana for helping to deepen the character of Manny, as the voice actor was a native Spanish speaker and suggested alternate dialog for the game that was more natural for casual Spanish conversations. Schafer planned from the beginning for the voice cast to consist entirely of Latino performers.

===Original release===
Originally, the game was to be shipped in the first half of 1998 but was delayed; as a result, the game was shipped on October 28, 1998, for release on October 30, the Friday before November 2, the actual date of the Day of the Dead celebration. Even with the delay, the team had to drop several of the puzzles and characters from the game, including a climactic five-step puzzle against Hector LeMans at the conclusion of the game; Schafer later noted that they would have needed one to two more years to implement their original designs.

===Remastered version===
====Acquisition of rights and announcement====
A remastered version of &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; was released for Linux, OS X, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Windows platforms on January 27, 2015. The PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita versions feature cross-buy and cross-save. It was later released for Android and iOS on May 5. The remastered version was released as a PlayStation Plus title for the month of January 2016.

The remastered version was predicated on the transition of LucasArts from a developer and publisher into a licensor and publisher in 2013 shortly after its acquisition by Disney. Under new management, LucasArts licensed several of its intellectual properties (IP), including &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;, to outside developers. Schafer was able to acquire the rights to the game with financial assistance from Sony, and started the process of building out the remaster within Double Fine Productions. Schafer said that the sale of LucasArts to Disney had reminded them of the past efforts of former LucasArts president Darrell Rodriguez to release the older LucasArts titles as Legacy Properties, such as the 2009 rerelease of &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;. Schafer also noted that they had tried to acquire the property from LucasArts in the years prior, but the frequent change in management stalled progress. When they began to inquire about the rights with Disney and LucasArts following its acquisition, they found that Sony, through their vice president of publisher and developer relations Adam Boyes, was also looking to acquire the rights. Boyes stated that Sony had been interested in working with a wide array of developers for the PlayStation 4, and was also inspired to seek &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; after seeing developers like Capcom and Midway Games revive older properties. Boyes&#x27; determination was supported by John Vignocchi, VP of Production for Disney Interactive, who also shared memories of the game, and was able to bring in contacts to track down the game&#x27;s assets. After discovering they were vying for the same property, Schafer and Boyes agreed to work together to acquire the IP and subsequent funding, planning to make the re-release a remastered version. Sony did not ask for any of IP rights for the game, instead only asking Double Fine to give the PlayStation platforms console exclusivity in exchange for funding support, similar to their Pub Fund scheme they use to support independent developers.

====Challenges====
A major complication in remastering the original work was having many of the critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup files were made on Digital Linear Tape (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts had been able to recover for Double Fine, but the company had no drives to read the tapes. Former LucasArts sound engineer Jory Prum had managed to save a DLT drive and was able to extract all of the game&#x27;s audio development data from the tapes.

Schafer noted at the time of &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; original development, retention of code was not as rigorous as present-day standards, and in some cases, Schafer believes the only copies of some files were unintentionally taken by employees when they had left LucasArts. As such, Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have saved. In other cases, they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character&#x27;s hat, and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design.

Once original assets were identified, as to be used to present the &quot;classic&quot; look of the game in the Remastered edition, Double Fine worked to improve the overall look for modern computers. The textures and lighting models for the characters were improved, in particular for Manny. Schafer has likened the remastering approach to The Criterion Collection film releases in providing a high-fidelity version of the game without changing the story or the characters.

In addition to his own developers, Schafer reached out to players who had created unofficial patches and graphical improvements on the original game, and modifications needed to keep it running in ResidualVM, and gained their help to improve the game&#x27;s assets for the remastered version. One such feature was a modified control scheme that converted the game&#x27;s movement controls from the tank controls to a point and click-style interface. Schafer said the team used tank controls as it was popular with other games like &quot;Resident Evil&quot; at the time, but recognized it did not work well within the adventure game genre. Schafer contacted Tobias Pfaff who created the point-and-click modification to obtain access to his code to incorporate into the remastered version.

====Later development and new features====
Double Fine demonstrated an in-progress version of the remastered game at IndieCade event in October 2014; new features included higher-resolution textures and improved resolution for the character models as well as having real-time lighting models, and the ability to switch back and forth between this presentation and the original graphics at the touch of a control. The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 4:3 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff&#x27;s patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank like controls, including analogue controls for console versions and point-and-click controls for computer versions. The game&#x27;s soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine&#x27;s &quot;Broken Age&quot;). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game. The PlayStation version also features cloud saving between the PS4 and Vita versions. A Nintendo Switch port was released on November 1, 2018. Double Fine was acquired by Xbox Game Studios in 2019, and &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; for the Xbox One arrived in 2020.

== Soundtrack ==
===Original soundtrack===
&quot;Grim Fandango&quot; has an original soundtrack that combines orchestral score, South American folk music, jazz, bebop, swing, and big band music, inspired by the likes of Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman as well as film composers Max Steiner and Adolph Deutsch. It also has various influences from traditional Russian, Celtic, Mexican, Spanish, and Indian strings culture. It was composed and produced by Peter McConnell at LucasArts. Others credited are Jeff Kliment (Engineer, Mixed By, Mastered), and Hans Christian Reumschüssel (Additional Music Production). The score featured live musicians that McConnell knew or made contact with in San Francisco&#x27;s Mission District, including a mariachi band. The soundtrack was released as a CD in 1998.

The soundtrack was very well received. IGN called it a &quot;beautiful soundtrack that you&#x27;ll find yourself listening to even after you&#x27;re done with the game&quot;. SEMO said &quot;the compositions and performances are so good that listening to this album on a stand-alone basis can make people feel like they&#x27;re in a bar back then&quot;. RPGFan said &quot;the pieces are beautifully composed, wonderfully played ... has a stellar soundtrack with music that easily stands alone outside the context of the game. This CD was an absolute pleasure to listen to and comes highly recommended&quot;. &quot;Game Revolution&quot; in its game review praised as one of the &quot;most memorable soundtracks ever to grace the inside of a cranial cavity where an eardrum used to be&quot;. PC Gamer in its 2014 list of Top 100 Games, acclaimed Grim Fandango for including &quot;one of the best soundtracks in PC gaming history&quot;. In 2017 &quot;Fact&quot; magazine also listed it as one of the &quot;100 best video game soundtracks of all time&quot;.

In 1999&#x27;s Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; Interactive Achievement Awards, the soundtrack was nominated in the category of &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Sound and Music&quot;. It was also lauded by GameSpot, which awarded it the &quot;Best PC Music awards&quot;, and included it in the &quot;Ten Best PC Game Soundtracks&quot; list in 1999.

===Remastered soundtrack===
After the original Pro Tools sound files were recovered, Peter McConnell found that some of the samples he had used originally did not sound good, and the team opted to re-orchestrate the score. The game&#x27;s soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra for the remastered version of the game.

The re-made soundtrack was produced under Nile Rodgers&#x27; label Sumthing Else. It had a standard release of 37 tracks, as well as a Director&#x27;s Cut with 14 extra tracks (the latter sold exclusively through Sumthing Else). It included the original score from the LucasArts archives, new compositions by Peter McConnell and new orchestral arrangements, as well as new extended versions of jazz pieces re-mixed at Sony Computer Entertainment America.

In 2018, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the original release of the game, the soundtrack was released for the first time in vinyl format.

== Reception ==
===Reviews===
&quot;Grim Fandango&quot; gained critical acclaim upon its release. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the game a score of 94/100. Critics lauded the art direction in particular, with GameSpot rating the visual design as &quot;consistently great&quot;. &quot;PC Zone&quot; emphasized the production as a whole calling the direction, costumes, characters, music, and atmosphere expertly done. They also commented the game would make a &quot;superb film&quot;. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; stated &quot;&quot;Grim Fandango&quot; feels like a wild dance through a cartoonish film-noir adventure. Its wacky characters, seductive puzzle-filled plot and a nearly invisible interface allow players to lose themselves in the game just as cinemagoers might get lost in a movie.&quot; The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, in naming &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; the best game of 1998 along with &quot;Half-Life&quot;, complimented the graphics calling them &quot;jaw-dropping&quot; and commented that the game &quot;is full of both dark and light humor&quot;. IGN summed its review up by saying the game was the &quot;best adventure game&quot; it had ever seen.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that &quot;&quot;Grim Fandango&quot; is a smart, beautiful, and enjoyable adventure game that will leave you holding your breath waiting for &quot;Grim Fandango 2&quot;.&quot;

The game also received criticisms from the media. Several reviewers noted that there were difficulties experienced with the interface, requiring a certain learning curve to get used to, and selected camera angles for some puzzles were poorly chosen. The use of elevators in the game was particularly noted as troublesome. The review from Adventure Gamers expressed dislike of the soundtrack, and, at times, &quot;found it too heavy and not well suited to the game&#x27;s theme&quot;. A &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; review also noted that the game had continuous and long data loading from the CD-ROM that interrupted the game and &quot;spoils the fluidity of some sequences and causes niggling delays&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; as number 26 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that, &quot;&quot;Grim&quot; offered adventure fans funny, touching, and infuriating moments in following its characters, and it did so through a magnificently beautiful game.&quot;

=== Awards ===
&quot;Grim Fandango&quot; won several awards after its release in 1998. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; selected the game as the 1998 &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot;. The game won IGN&#x27;s &quot;Best Adventure Game of the Year&quot; in 1998, while GameSpot awarded it their &quot;Best of E3 1998&quot;, &quot;PC Adventure Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;PC Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Best PC Graphics for Artistic Design&quot;, and &quot;Best PC Music awards&quot;. GameSpot named &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; its Game of the Year for 1998, and in the following year included the game in their &quot;Ten Best PC Game Soundtracks&quot; and was selected as the 10th &quot;Best PC Ending&quot; by their readership. In 1999, &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; won &quot;PC Adventure Game of the Year&quot; during the AIAS&#x27; 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as the D.I.C.E. Awards); it was also nominated for &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Computer Entertainment Title of the Year&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Character or Story Development&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Sound and Music&quot;.

&quot;Grim Fandango&quot; has been included in several publishers&#x27; &quot;Top Games&quot; lists well after its release. GameSpot inducted the game into their &quot;Greatest Games of All Time&quot; in 2003 citing, &quot;Ask just about anyone who has played Grim Fandango, and he or she will agree that it&#x27;s one of the greatest games of all time.&quot; GameSpy also added the game to their Hall of Fame in 2004, further describing it as the seventh &quot;Most Underrated Game of All Time&quot; in 2003. Adventure Gamers listed &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; as the seventh &quot;Top Adventure Game of All Time&quot; in 2004; in their 2011 list of &quot;Top 100 All-Time Adventures&quot; it was listed as #1. In 2007, IGN included the game in the &quot;Top 25 PC Games&quot; (as 15th) and &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; (at 36th), citing that &quot;LucasArts&#x27; second-to-last stab at the classic adventure genre may very well be the most original and brilliant one ever made.&quot; &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; remained as the 20th in the Top 25 PC Games in IGN&#x27;s 2009 list.

====Lists of awards and rankings====


=== Sales and aftermath ===
Initial estimates suggested that &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; sold well during the 1998 holiday season. It debuted at #6 for the first week of November on PC Data&#x27;s computer game sales charts, at an average retail price of $35. It was absent by its second week. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; claimed first place on Chart-Track&#x27;s weekly sales chart in December, before falling to ninth place. It secured 12th after four weeks, and 24th at the 13-week mark. The game sold 58,617 copies and earned $2.33 million in the United States by the end of 1998, and rose to 95,000 sales there by March 2000, according to PC Data. &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; sold another 16,157 units in the region during 2001, and 8,032 in the first six months of 2002; its jewel case SKU reached 5,621 sales during 2003. According to Tim Schafer, the game achieved sales of approximately 500,000 units by 2012, around 50% fewer than &quot;Full Throttle&quot; had achieved. It is commonly considered a commercial failure, even though LucasArts stated that &quot;Grim Fandango met domestic expectations and exceeded them worldwide&quot;. The game had become profitable by 2000, although Dave Grossman has said, &quot;It was pretty ambitious and expensive, and I don&#x27;t think it made very much money back.&quot; A writer for &quot;Edge&quot; summarized in 2009, &quot;While its reputation as a flop isn&#x27;t entirely accurate, &quot;Grim&quot;″s sales were either an indication that people preferred motorbikes to Gitanes-smoking corpses, or a sign of the times: adventure games were simply on their way out.&quot;

While LucasArts proceeded to produce &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot; in 2000, they canceled development of sequels to &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; and &quot;Full Throttle&quot; stating that &quot;After careful evaluation of current market place realities and underlying economic considerations, we&#x27;ve decided that this was not the appropriate time to launch a graphic adventure on the PC.&quot; Subsequently, the studio dismissed many of the people involved with their adventure games, some of whom went on to set up Telltale Games, creating an episodic series of &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; games. These events, along with other changes in the video game market towards action-based games, are seen as primary causes in the decline of the adventure game genre. &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; underperformance was seen as a sign that the genre was commercially &quot;dead&quot; to rival Sierra, as well. LucasArts stated in 2006 that they do not plan on returning to adventure games until the &quot;next decade&quot;. Ultimately the studio stopped developing video games in 2013 after The Walt Disney Company acquisition of Lucasfilm, and was dissolved shortly thereafter.

Tim Schafer left LucasArts shortly after &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; release, and created his own company, Double Fine Productions, in 2000 along with many of those involved in the development of &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;. The company has found similar critical success with their first title, &quot;Psychonauts&quot;. Schafer stated that while there is strong interest from fans and that he &quot;would love to go back and spend time with the characters from any game [he] worked on&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; or his other previous games is unlikely as &quot;I always want to make something new.&quot; With the help of developers such as Double Fine and Telltale Games, adventure games saw a resurgence in the 2010s, with financially successful titles such as &quot;Broken Age&quot;, &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, and &quot;The Wolf Among Us&quot;.

===Remastered version===
&quot;Grim Fandango Remastered&quot; has received similar positive reception as the original release, with many critics continuing to praise the game&#x27;s story, characters, and soundtrack. They also found the developer&#x27;s commentary to be very insightful to the history of the game. Reviewers were disappointed at the lack of an auto-save system, as well as the game not receiving a full high-definition upgrade, leaving the higher-resolution characters somewhat out of place with the original 3D backgrounds. Many reviewers also noted that the puzzles, though a staple of the day when &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; was first released, remain somewhat obtuse with solutions that are not clear even after the player solves them, and that a hint system, as was added to the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; remake, would have been very helpful. The game&#x27;s pacing, also unchanged from the original version, was also found harder to grasp, in both the pacing within the game&#x27;s four acts, and the time taken to move around and between rooms. In his review for Eurogamer, Richard Cobbett warned players to &quot;be careful of rose-tinted memories&quot;, that while the remastered version is faithful to the original, it does show aspects of the original game that have become outdated in video game development. &quot;Wired&quot; Laura Hudson considered the remastered version highlighted how the original game was &quot;an artifact of its time, an exceptional piece of interactive art wrapped inextricably around the technology and conventions of its time in a way that reveals both their limitations and the brilliance they were capable of producing&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 2005, &quot;The Guardian&quot; characterized the game as &quot;the last genuine classic to come from LucasArts, the company that helped define adventure games, Tim Schafer&#x27;s noir-pastiche follows skull-faced Manny Calavera through a bureaucratic parody of the Land of the Dead. With a look that takes from both Mexican mythology and art deco, &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; is as unique an artistic statement as mainstream gaming has managed to offer. While loved by devotees, its limited sales prompted LucasArts to back away from original adventures to simply exploit franchises&quot;.

&quot;Eurogamer&quot; Jeffrey Matulef, in a 2012 retrospective look, believed that &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; combination of film noir and the adventure game genre was the first of its kind and a natural fit due to the script-heavy nature of both, and would later help influence games with similar themes like the &quot;Ace Attorney&quot; series and &quot;L.A. Noire&quot;.

&quot;Grim Fandango&quot; has been considered a representative title demonstrating video games as an art form; the game was selected in 2012 as a candidate for public voting for inclusion within the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Video Games&quot; exhibit, while the Museum of Modern Art seeks to install the game as an exhibit as part of its permanent collection within the Department of Architecture and Design.

The game was included in the &quot;Game Masters&quot; exhibition, organized in 2012 by the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI); an event devoted to explore the faces and the history behind computer games. Tim Schafer was featured as the creative force behind &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;, within the exhibition section called &quot;Game Changers&quot;, crediting him along a few other visionary game designers for having &quot;pushed the boundaries of game design and storytelling, introducing new genres, creating our best-loved characters and revolutionising the way we understand and play games&quot;.

&quot;Grim Fandango&quot; has been the centerpiece of a large fan community for the game that has continued to be active more than 10 years after the game&#x27;s release. Such fan communities include the Grim Fandango Network and the Department of Death, both of which include fan art and fiction in addition to other original content.

In an interview with &quot;Kotaku&quot; after the announcement of the remaster, Schafer stated that he has long considered the idea of a &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; sequel to further expand on the setting of the game. He felt the story would be a difficult component, as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward, or otherwise build the story around a new character. One option he has considered to alleviate the issue is by creating an adventure game using an open-world mechanic similar to the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series.

<text>The General Electric Company (GEC) was a major British industrial conglomerate involved in consumer and defence electronics, communications, and engineering.

It was originally founded in 1886 as G. Binswanger and Company as an electrical goods wholesaler based in London. It quickly adopted a then-unorthodox business model of supplying electrical components over the counter. In 1889, the business was incorporated as the General Electric Company Ltd, and became a public limited company 11 years later. During the 1890s and 1900s, the company heavily invested into electric lighting, a sector that proved to be immensely profitable in the long term. The GEC was heavily impacted by the outbreak of the First World War, supplying various goods to the military, and thus becoming a major player in the electrical industry. In 1921, a new purpose-built company headquarters (Magnet House) was opened in Kingsway, London; two years later, GEC&#x27;s industrial research laboratories at Wembley (later named the Hirst Research Centre) also opened. In the 1920s, the company was heavily involved in the creation and roll-out of Britain&#x27;s National Grid.

During the Second World War, GEC made several significant contributions to the Allied war effort, such as the development of the cavity magnetron for radar, various advances in communications technology, and the mass production of valves, lamps, and lighting equipment. In 1961, GEC merged with Radio &amp; Allied Industries. Throughout the mid-to-late 1960s, GEC&#x27;s new managing director, Arnold Weinstock, sought to rationalise the British electrical industry and boost efficiency via a series of cut-backs and mergers that returned the company to profit. GEC acquired Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) in 1967, and merged with English Electric one year later. The company continued to expand via acquisitions; between 1979 and 1981, GEC acquired W &amp; T Avery, &quot;Cincinnati Electronics&quot;, and &quot;Picker Corporation&quot;.

During the 1980s, the company was Britain&#x27;s largest private employer with over 250,000 employees; becoming one of the first companies in the new FTSE 100 Index in 1984. It made profits in excess of £1 billion per year at its peak in the 1990s. In June 1998, GEC sold its share of the joint venture GEC-Alsthom on the Paris stock exchange. In December 1999, GEC&#x27;s defence arm, Marconi Electronic Systems (MES), was sold to British Aerospace, forming BAE Systems. The rest of GEC, mainly telecommunications equipment manufacturing, continued as Marconi Communications. After buying several US telecoms manufacturers at the top of the market, losses following the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2001 led to the restructuring in 2003 of Marconi plc into Marconi Corporation plc. In 2005, the company failed to secure any part of BT&#x27;s 21st Century Network (21CN) programme; that same year, Ericsson acquired the bulk of the company; what was left of the business was renamed Telent.

==History==
===Early years (1886–88)===
GEC had its origins in the &quot;G. Binswanger and Company&quot;, an electrical goods wholesaler established in London in the 1880s by a German-Jewish immigrant, Gustav Binswanger (later Gustav Byng). Regarded as the year GEC was founded, 1886 saw a fellow immigrant, Hugo Hirst, join Byng, and the company changed its name to &quot;The General Electric Apparatus Company (G. Binswanger)&quot;.

Their small business found early success with its unorthodox method of supplying electrical components over the counter. Hugo Hirst was an entrepreneurial salesman who saw the potential of electricity and was able to direct the standardisation of an industry in its infancy. He travelled across Europe with an eye for the latest products, and in 1887 the company published the first electrical catalogue of its kind. The following year, the company acquired its first factory in Salford, where electric bells, telephones, ceiling roses and switches were manufactured.

===Incorporation and expansion (1889–1913)===
In 1889, the business was incorporated as a private company known as the &quot;General Electric Company Ltd&quot;. The company was expanding rapidly, opening new branches and factories and trading in &#x27;everything electrical&#x27;, a phrase that was to become synonymous with GEC. 

In 1893, it decided to invest in the manufacture of lamps. The resulting company, (to become Osram in 1909), was to lead the way in lamp design, and the burgeoning demand for electric lighting was to make GEC&#x27;s fortune.

In 1900, GEC was incorporated as a public limited company, The General Electric Company (1900) Ltd (the &#x27;1900&#x27; was dropped three years later). In 1902, its first purpose-built factory, the Witton Engineering Works, was opened near Birmingham.

In 1907, GEC set up the &quot;Peel-Conner Telephone Works&quot; to manufacture telephone exchanges and telephones for the GPO; GEC supplied a large CB manual exchange for Glasgow in 1910. The British telephone system had been taken over and was operated by the General Post Office (GPO or BPO, a government department). The telephone manufacturing section moved from Manchester to Coventry in 1919, and GEC was one of the &quot;ring&quot; of four (later five) companies supplying the GPO with Strowger automatic telephone exchanges (called &quot;Step-by-Step&quot; or SXS) in use from the 1920s to the 1960s. In 1910, the meter department, also based at Peel Works, was incorporated separately as Salford Electrical Instruments.

With the death of Gustav Byng in 1910, Hugo Hirst became the chairman as well as managing director, a position he had assumed in 1906. Hirst&#x27;s shrewd investment in lamp manufacture was proving extremely profitable. In 1909, Osram began production of the most successful tungsten filament lamps in the industry. Rapidly growing private and commercial use of electricity created huge demand. The company expanded both at home and overseas, with the establishment of agencies in Europe, Japan, Australia, South Africa, and India. It also did substantial trade with South America.

===World Wars and post-WWII (1914–60)===
The outbreak of the First World War transformed GEC into a major player in the electrical industry. The company was heavily involved in the war effort, supplying products such as radios, signal lamps, and the arc-lamp carbons used in searchlights.

In 1917, GEC created the Express Lift Company in Northampton, England.

During the interwar period, GEC expanded to become a global corporation and national institution. The takeover of Fraser and Chalmers in 1918 took GEC into heavy engineering and bolstered their claim to supply &#x27;everything electrical&#x27;. In the same year, the maker of electricity meters, Chamberlain and Hookham, was also acquired by GEC.

In 1919, GEC merged its radio valve manufacturing interests with those of the Marconi Company to form the Marconi-Osram Valve Company.

In the 1920s, the company was heavily involved in the creation of the UK-wide National Grid. The opening of a new purpose-built company headquarters (Magnet House) in Kingsway, London in 1921, and the pioneering industrial research laboratories at Wembley in 1923 (later named the Hirst Research Centre), were symbolic of the continuing expansion of both GEC and the electrical industry.

During the Second World War, GEC was a major manufacturer of electrical and engineering products for the British armed forces. Significant contributions to the war effort included the development in 1940 of the cavity magnetron for radar, by the scientists John Randall and Harry Boot at the University of Birmingham, as well as advances in communications technology and the ongoing mass production of valves, lamps and lighting equipment.

The post-war years saw a decline in GEC&#x27;s expansion. After the death of Hugo Hirst in 1943, his son-in-law Leslie Gamage (elder son of the founder of Gamages), along with Harry Railing, took over as joint managing directors. Despite the huge demand for electrical consumer goods, and large investments in heavy engineering and nuclear power, profits began to fall in the face of competition and internal disorganisation.

===Further expansion (1961–83)===
In 1961, GEC merged with Sir Michael Sobell&#x27;s Radio &amp; Allied Industries, and with it emerged the new power behind GEC, Sobell&#x27;s son-in-law Arnold Weinstock, who became the managing director of GEC in 1963, and moved its headquarters from Kingsway to a new building at 1 Stanhope Gate in Mayfair.

Weinstock embarked on a programme to rationalise the entire British electrical industry, beginning with the internal rejuvenation of GEC. In a drive for efficiency, Weinstock made cut-backs and instigated mergers, resulting in new growth for the company. GEC returned to profit and the financial markets&#x27; confidence was restored.

During the late 1960s, the electrical industry was revolutionised as GEC acquired Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) in 1967, which encompassed Metropolitan-Vickers, British Thomson-Houston, Edison Swan, Siemens Brothers &amp; Co, Hotpoint, William Thomas Henley and Birlec.

In 1968, GEC merged with English Electric, incorporating Elliott Brothers, the Marconi Company, Ruston &amp; Hornsby, Robert Stephenson &amp; Hawthorns, the Vulcan Foundry, Willans &amp; Robinson and Dick, Kerr &amp; Co. The Elliot computer company became GEC Computers, whose products were successful in academic computing and real-time process control in the 1970s and 1980s.

The Birmingham Witton works remained one of the company&#x27;s biggest sites, producing high-voltage switchgear and transformers, large generators, small motors, mercury arc rectifiers and traction components, until the plant was gradually sold off by Weinstock in 1969.

In 1969, a new subsidiary company was born, English Electric-AEI Traction Ltd. This new organisation slowly integrated together the traction divisions of both AEI and EE, culminating in 1972 when the company was renamed GEC Traction Ltd. Also added to the company was the industrial locomotive division of the former English Electric which was based at Vulcan Works, Newton-le-Willows (this later became a separate company, GEC Industrial Locomotives Ltd). The company had manufacturing sites at Manchester, Preston and Sheffield.

The company continued to expand with the acquisition in 1979 of weighing machine maker W &amp; T Avery, renamed GEC Avery.

In April 1981, GEC acquired Cincinnati Electronics (CE), in Cincinnati, Ohio, at the time owned by George J Mealey. CE was a leader in military radios and infrared technology, space electronics, and other high-security products, doing business throughout the world. (Now owned by L-3 Cincinnati Electronics.)

In 1981, GEC acquired Picker Corporation, an American manufacturer of medical imaging equipment. GEC merged Picker with Cambridge Instruments, GEC Medical, and American Optical to form Picker International (PI). GEC Medical was itself an amalgamation of Watson &amp; Sons Ltd, formed in the early 20th century in London and long a part of GEC, and A E Dean &amp; Co of Croydon. In 1982, PI introduced the first 1.0T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) unit. In 1998, it acquired the CT division of Elscint In 1999, the company changed its name to Marconi Medical Systems. In 2001, Philips bought Marconi Medical Systems for $1.1 billion.

===Acquisitions and mergers (1984–97)===
GEC had become the UK&#x27;s largest and most successful company and private employer, with about 250,000 employees. In 1984, it became one of the first companies in the new FTSE 100 Index, ranking third in value behind British Petroleum and Shell Transport and Trading.

In 1985, GEC acquired Yarrow Shipbuilders from British Shipbuilders. In 1988, GEC Plessey Telecommunications (GPT) was created when GEC bought Plessey. The following year, GEC and Siemens formed a joint company, GEC Siemens plc, to take over Plessey. As part of the deal, GEC took control of Plessey&#x27;s avionics and naval systems businesses.
In early 1989, GEC and French company Alsthom merged their power generation and transport businesses in a new joint venture, GEC-Alsthom. In May 1989, GEC-Alsthom bought British rail vehicle manufacturer Metro-Cammell.

In early 1996, the Otis Elevator Company acquired The Express Lift Company from GEC. By the mid-1990s, GEC was making profits of £1 billion, had cash reserves of £3 billion, and was valued at £10 billion. 

The move towards electronics and modern technology, particularly in the defence sector, was a departure from the domestic electrical goods market. GEC acquired the Edinburgh based Ferranti Defence Systems Group in 1990 as well as part of Ferranti International&#x27;s assets in Italy. It also bought Vickers Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering (VSE) in 1995. VSE was willing to participate in a merger with a larger company to reduce its exposure to cycles in warship production, particularly in light of the post-Cold War &quot;Options for Change&quot; defence review. Following GEC&#x27;s purchase, VSE became Marconi Marine.

During 1996, Lord Weinstock retired as GEC&#x27;s managing director and was replaced by George Simpson. In July 1997, the company announced the outcomes of a major review: it would move away from its joint ventures and focus on moving toward &quot;global leadership&quot; in defence and aerospace (Marconi Electronic Systems), industrial electronics (GEC Industrial Electronics), and communications (GEC Communications). Simpson, along with finance director John Mayo, decided to pursue a risky strategy of pursuing fast growth via rapid acquisition of numerous other companies, particularly within the United States.

In February 1998, Marconi Instruments, the test equipment arm of GEC, was sold to IFR Systems.

In March 1998, GEC announced the merger of its radar and avionics business with Alenia Difesa to form Alenia Marconi Systems.

In June 1998, it completed the $1.4bn acquisition of major American defence contractor Tracor, which became part of MES. The same month, GEC sold its share of the joint venture GEC-Alsthom on the Paris stock exchange.

After most of its US acquisitions failed, GEC began to make a loss. The cash reserves that Lord Weinstock had built up during the 1980s and early 1990s had been all but depleted, and the company was heavily in debt.

===Marconi Electronic Systems sale (1998–99)===
In July 1998, reports began linking British Aerospace (BAe) with the German aerospace group DASA to create a new European Aerospace and Defence Company. GEC was also seen as a potential partner in a three-way merger with BAe and DASA.

In December 1998, reports emerged that GEC was seeking a partner for MES, the value of which was greatly increased by the Tracor acquisition. Prospective partners included Thomson-CSF (by 1998 on the path to privatisation) and various American defence contractors (e.g. Lockheed Martin and TRW). GEC had already been active in pursuing consolidation in the defence business. In 1997, it made an ultimately unsuccessful bid to the French government to privatise Thomson-CSF and merge it with MES.

A merger of UK companies soon became the most likely development. In mid-January 1999, GEC and British Aerospace confirmed they were holding talks. On 19 January, it was announced British Aerospace was to acquire Marconi Electronic Systems for £7.7bn ($12.75bn).

===Marconi plc (1999–2002)===
While the deal was yet to be completed, GEC used much of the anticipated proceeds of the MES sale to buy companies in 1999. This move was part of a major realignment of the firm to focus on the burgeoning telecoms sector, and it became a radio, telecommunications and internet equipment manufacturer. At the time, financial markets approved of the strategy; GEC&#x27;s share value set new all-time highs during early 1999.

In 1999, Marconi plc purchased two American equipment-makers: RELTEC Corporation in March for £1.3bn, and FORE Systems in April for £2.8bn, to complement the telecommunication business of its subsidiary Marconi Communications. Later that year, GEC acquired Kvaerner&#x27;s Govan shipyard. In April 2000, it acquired Mobile Systems International in exchange for £391m. Consolidating and monitoring the finances of these acquisitions soon added to the future difficulties encountered by Marconi.

These acquisitions were made at the height of the dot-com bubble, and the bursting of the bubble in 2001 took a heavy toll on Marconi. While the company initially chose to deny any impact to sales, the delayed issue of a profit warning spooked investors. In July 2001, Marconi plc suffered a 54% drop in its share price following the suspension of trading of its shares, profit warning, and redundancies. Having accumulated a sizable debt pile that was continuing to mount due to heavy losses, Marconi was facing bankruptcy.

In September 2011, Simpson was forced to resign from Marconi and a new management team was brought in under Mike Parton, the new chief executive. Shares that had been worth £12.50 at GEC&#x27;s peak had fallen to £0.04. Lord Weinstock&#x27;s own stake, once worth £480 million, was reduced to £2 million.

===Marconi Corporation plc and break-up (2002–05)===
On 19 May 2003, Marconi plc underwent a restructuring and became Marconi Corporation plc, advised by Lazard and Morgan Stanley. Marconi shareholders received one Marconi Corporation share for every 559 Marconi shares. In a debt-for-equity swap, the firm&#x27;s creditors received 99.5% of the new company&#x27;s shares. In October 2003, the company announced that it intended to pursue listing on the Nasdaq.

In 2005, the company failed to secure any part of BT&#x27;s 21st Century Network (21CN) programme, surprising commentators and sending the company&#x27;s shares tumbling. Before the announcement, the investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort had said, &quot;[Marconi is] so advanced with its products and so entrenched with BT Group plc that its selection looks certain.&quot; Various bids were received for the business, including one from Huawei Technologies, with whom Marconi already had a joint venture.

Prior to the collapse of the Marconi group in 2005 and 2006, the company was a major supplier of Asynchronous Transfer Mode, Gigabit Ethernet, and Internet Protocol products. The majority of Marconi Corporation&#x27;s businesses (including Marconi Communications and the rights to the Marconi name) were sold to Ericsson in 2005, and the remainder was renamed Telent plc.

On 27 October 2006, the company folded voluntarily.

<text>Calotype or talbotype is an early photographic process introduced in 1841 by William Henry Fox Talbot, using paper coated with silver iodide. Paper texture effects in calotype photography limit the ability of this early process to record low contrast details and textures.

The term &quot;calotype&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek (), &quot;beautiful&quot;, and (), &quot;impression&quot;.

==The process==
Talbot made his first successful camera photographs in 1835 using paper sensitised with silver chloride, which darkened in proportion to its exposure to light. This early &quot;photogenic drawing&quot; process was a &quot;printing-out&quot; process, i.e., the paper had to be exposed in the camera until the image was fully visible. A very long exposure—typically an hour or more—was required to produce an acceptable negative.

In late 1840, Talbot worked out a very different &quot;developing-out&quot; process (a concept pioneered by the daguerreotype process introduced in 1839), in which only an extremely faint or completely invisible latent image had to be produced in the camera, which could be done in a minute or two if the subject was in bright sunlight. The paper, shielded from further exposure to daylight, was then removed from the camera and the latent image was chemically developed into a fully visible image. This major improvement was introduced to the public as the &quot;calotype&quot; or &quot;talbotype&quot; process in 1841.

The light-sensitive silver halide in calotype paper was silver iodide, created by the reaction of silver nitrate with potassium iodide. First, &quot;iodised paper&quot; was made by brushing one side of a sheet of high-quality writing paper with a solution of silver nitrate, drying it, dipping it in a solution of potassium iodide, then drying it again. At this stage, the balance of the chemicals was such that the paper was practically insensitive to light and could be stored indefinitely. When wanted for use, the side initially brushed with silver nitrate was now brushed with a &quot;gallo-nitrate of silver&quot; solution consisting of silver nitrate, acetic acid and gallic acid, then lightly blotted and exposed in the camera. Development was effected by brushing on more of the &quot;gallo-nitrate of silver&quot; solution while gently warming the paper. When development was complete, the calotype was rinsed, blotted, then either stabilized by washing it in a solution of potassium bromide, which converted the remaining silver iodide into silver bromide in a condition such that it would only slightly discolour when exposed to light, or &quot;fixed&quot; in a hot solution of sodium thiosulphate, then known as &quot;hyposulphite of soda&quot; and commonly called &quot;hypo&quot;, which dissolved the silver iodide and allowed it to be entirely washed out, leaving only the silver particles of the developed image and making the calotype completely insensitive to light.

The calotype process produced a translucent original negative image from which multiple positives could be made by simple contact printing. This gave it an important advantage over the daguerreotype process, which produced an opaque original positive that could be duplicated only by copying it with a camera.

Although calotype paper could be used to make positive prints from calotype negatives, Talbot&#x27;s earlier silver chloride paper, commonly called &quot;salted paper&quot;, was normally used for that purpose. It was simpler and less expensive, and Talbot himself considered the appearance of salted paper prints to be more attractive. The longer exposure required to make a salted print was at worst a minor inconvenience when making a contact print by sunlight. Calotype negatives were often impregnated with wax to improve their transparency and make the grain of the paper less conspicuous in the prints.

Talbot is sometimes erroneously credited with introducing the principle of latent image development. The bitumen process used in private experiments by Nicéphore Niépce during the 1820s involved the chemical development of a latent image, as did the widely used daguerreotype process introduced to the public by Niépce&#x27;s partner and successor Louis Daguerre in 1839. Talbot was, however, the first to apply it to a paper-based process and to a negative-positive process, thereby pioneering the various developed-out negative-positive processes which have dominated non-electronic photography up to the present.

==Popularity==

Despite their flexibility and the ease with which they could be made, calotypes did not displace the daguerreotype.

In part, this was the result of Talbot having patented his processes in England and beyond. Unlike Talbot, Daguerre who had been granted a stipend by the French state in exchange for making his process publicly available, did not patent his invention. In Scotland, where the English patent law was not applicable at the time, members of the Edinburgh Calotype Club and other Scottish early photographers successfully adopted the paper-negative photo technology. In England, the Calotype Society was organized in London around 1847 attracting a dozen enthusiasts. In 1853, twelve years after the introduction of paper-negative photography to the public, Talbot&#x27;s patent restriction was lifted.

In addition, the calotype produced a less clear image than the daguerreotype. The use of paper as a negative meant that the texture and fibers of the paper were visible in prints made from it, leading to an image that was slightly grainy or fuzzy compared to daguerreotypes, which were usually sharp and clear. Nevertheless, calotypes—and the salted paper prints that were made from them—remained popular in the United Kingdom and on the European continent outside France in the 1850s, especially among the amateur calotypists, who prized the aesthetics of calotypes and also wanted to differentiate from commercial photographers, until the collodion process enabled both to make glass negatives combining the sharpness of a daguerreotype with the replicability of a calotype later in the nineteenth century. British photographers also brought the calotype to India, where, for example, in 1848, John McCosh, a surgeon in the East India Company, took the first image of the Maharajah Duleep Singh.

<doc id="81080" wikidata="Q5065863" url="?curid=81080" title="Cfront">
<text>Cfront was the original compiler for C++ (then known as &quot;C with Classes&quot;) from around 1983, which converted C++ to C; developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at AT&amp;T Bell Labs. The preprocessor did not understand all of the language and much of the code was written via translations. Cfront had a complete parser, built symbol tables, and built a tree for each class, function, etc. Cfront was based on CPre, a C compiler started in 1979.

As Cfront was written in C++, it was a challenge to bootstrap on a machine without a C++ compiler/translator. Along with the Cfront C++ sources, a special &quot;half-preprocessed&quot; version of the C code resulting from compiling Cfront with itself was also provided. This C code was to be compiled with the native C compiler, and the resulting executable could then be used to compile the Cfront C++ sources.

Most of the porting effort in getting Cfront running on a new machine was related to standard I/O. Cfront&#x27;s C++ streams were closely tied in with the C library&#x27;s buffered I/O streams, but there was little interaction with the rest of the C environment. The compiler could be ported to most System V derivatives without many changes, but BSD-based systems usually had many more variations in their C libraries and associated stdio structures.

Cfront defined the language until circa 1990, and many of the more obscure corner cases in C++ were related to its C++-to-C translation approach. A few remnants of Cfront&#x27;s translation method are still found in today&#x27;s C++ compilers; name mangling was originated by Cfront, as the relatively primitive linkers at the time did not support type information in symbols, and some template instantiation models are derived from Cfront&#x27;s early efforts. C++ (and Cfront) was directly responsible for many improvements in Unix linkers and object file formats, as it was the first widely used language which required link-time type checking, weak symbols, and other similar features.

Cfront 4.0 was abandoned in 1993 after a failed attempt to add exception support. The C++ language had grown beyond its capabilities; however a compiler with similar approach became available later, namely Comeau C/C++.

Analogous to the way cfront can process C++ source code into something that can be compiled by previously-available C compilers, cppfront processes source code written in new and experimental C++ &#x27;syntax 2&#x27; into something that can be compiled by previously-available &#x27;syntax 1&#x27; C++ compilers. cppfront is different in scope in that it doesn&#x27;t perform many validity checks on the code, instead relying on the C++ compiler for any checks that would require non-local understanding of the code such as establishing correct use of symbols. Cfront on the other hand was a complete compiler that just happened to target the C language instead of an assembler.

The company was founded in 1935. Originally a flying school operator, the company took on maintenance work in 1938.
During the Second World War, Scottish Aviation was involved in aircraft fitting for the war effort. This included maintenance and conversion of the Consolidated Liberator bomber.

The factory building of Scottish Aviation, which still exists today, was formerly the Palace of Engineering at the 1938 Empire Exhibition in Bellahouston Park, Glasgow. The building was dismantled from its Glasgow site and reconstructed.

Post-war it built robust military STOL utility aircraft such as the Pioneer and larger Twin Pioneer. Much later the company built some Jetstream turboprop transport and navigational training aircraft following the collapse of Handley Page (which designed the type). It built Bulldog trainers after the demise of their original manufacturer, Beagle Aircraft Limited.

In November 1958, redundancies affecting almost 800 of their 2,500 staff were announced. Scottish Aviation merged with the British Aircraft Corporation, Hawker Siddeley Aviation, and Hawker Siddeley Dynamics to form British Aerospace in 1977. Much of the former Scottish Aviation assets now belong to Spirit AeroSystems.

<text>Colonel David Crockett (August 17, 1786 – March 6, 1836) was an American politician, militia officer and frontiersman. Often referred to in popular culture as the &quot;King of the Wild Frontier&quot;, he represented Tennessee in the United States House of Representatives and fought in the Texas Revolution.

Crockett grew up in East Tennessee, where he gained a reputation for hunting and storytelling. He was made a colonel in the militia of Lawrence County, Tennessee and was elected to the Tennessee state legislature in 1821. In 1827, he was elected to the U.S. Congress where he vehemently opposed many of the policies of President Andrew Jackson, especially the Indian Removal Act. Crockett&#x27;s opposition to Jackson&#x27;s policies led to his defeat in the 1831 elections. He was re-elected in 1833, then narrowly lost in 1835, prompting his angry departure to Texas (then the Mexican state of Tejas) shortly thereafter. In early 1836, he took part in the Texas Revolution and died at the Battle of the Alamo. It is unclear whether he died in battle or was executed after being captured by the Mexican Army.

Crockett became famous during his lifetime for larger-than-life exploits popularized by stage plays and almanacs. After his death, he continued to be credited with acts of mythical proportion. These led in the 20th century to television and film portrayals, and he became one of the best-known American folk heroes.

==Family and early life==
Davy Crockett was paternally of French and Scotch-Irish descent, while maternally of English descent. The Crocketts were mostly of French-Huguenot ancestry, although the family had settled in Ulster in the north of Ireland before migrating to the Americas. The earliest known paternal ancestor was Gabriel Gustave de Crocketagne, whose son Antoine de Saussure Peronette de Crocketagne was given a commission in the Household Troops under King Louis XIV of France. Antoine married Louise de Saix and emigrated to the Kingdom of Ireland with her, changing the family name to Crockett. Their son Joseph Louis was born and raised in Ireland, possibly being born, according to local tradition, near either Castlederg or Donemana, both villages in the northwest of County Tyrone in the west of Ulster; Joseph Louis Crockett later married Sarah Stewart, who was also from west Ulster, she being an Ulster-Scot from just outside the village of Manorcunningham in the Laggan district in the east of County Donegal. Joseph and Sarah emigrated to New York, where their son William David was born in 1709. He married Elizabeth Boulay. William and Elizabeth&#x27;s son David (paternal grandfather of Davy Crockett) was born in Pennsylvania and married Elizabeth Hedge. Historical records indicate that David and Elizabeth were the parents of William, David Jr., Robert, Alexander, James, Joseph, and John (the father of Davy Crockett); they may have had additional children whose records have not yet been found.

John was born c. 1753 in Frederick County, Virginia. The family moved to Tryon County, North Carolina c. 1768. In 1776, the family moved to northeast Tennessee, in the area of modern Hawkins County. John was one of the Overmountain Men who fought in the Battle of Kings Mountain during the American Revolutionary War. He was away as a militia volunteer in 1777 when his parents David and Elizabeth were killed at their home near modern Rogersville by Creeks and Chickamauga Cherokees led by war chief Dragging Canoe. John&#x27;s brother Joseph was wounded in the skirmish. His brother James was taken prisoner and held for seventeen years.

John married Rebecca Hawkins in 1780. Nine children of John and Rebecca have been verified by historians and Crockett descendants: Nathan, William, Aaron, James, David, John, Elizabeth, Rebecca, and Margaret Catharine. Their son David (nicknamed Davy) was born August 17, 1786 and was named after John&#x27;s father. Crockett&#x27;s English ancestry comes from his mother Rebecca Hawkins, as the earliest ancestor arrived in Gloucester County, Virginia in 1658.

John Crockett was active in local politics and an advocate of the independent State of Franklin. Davy Crockett was born in that area, which is now in Greene County, Tennessee, close to the Nolichucky River and near the community of Limestone. A replica of Davy Crockett&#x27;s birthplace cabin stands near the site, situated in the David Crockett Birthplace State Park.

John continually struggled to make ends meet, and the Crocketts moved to a tract of land on Lick Creek in 1792. John sold that tract of land in 1794 and moved the family to Cove Creek, where he built a gristmill with partner Thomas Galbraith. A flood destroyed the gristmill and the Crockett homestead. The Crocketts then moved to Mossy Creek in Jefferson County, Tennessee, but John forfeited his property in bankruptcy in 1795. The family next moved on to property owned by a Quaker named John Canady — an Irish surname with variant spellings; for example, Crockett&#x27;s autobiography referred to the property owner as &quot;John Kennedy&quot;. At Morristown in the Southwest Territory, John built a tavern on a stage coach route; the Crockett Tavern Museum now stands on that site.

When David was 12 years old, his father indentured him to Jacob Siler to help with the Crockett family indebtedness. He helped tend Siler&#x27;s cattle as a cowboy on a trip to near Natural Bridge in Virginia. He was well treated and paid for his services but, after several weeks in Virginia, he decided to return home to Tennessee. The next year, John enrolled his sons in school, but David played hooky after an altercation with a fellow student. Upon learning of this, John attempted to whip him but was outrun by his son. David then joined a cattle drive to Front Royal, Virginia, for Jesse Cheek. Upon completion of that trip, he joined teamster Adam Myers on a trip to Gerrardstown, West Virginia. In between trips with Myers, he worked for farmer John Gray. After leaving Myers, he journeyed to Christiansburg, Virginia, where he apprenticed for the next four years with hatter Elijah Griffith.
In 1802, David journeyed by foot back to his father&#x27;s tavern in Tennessee. His father was in debt to Abraham Wilson for $36 (), so David was hired out to Wilson to pay off the debt. Later, he worked off a $40 debt to John Canady. Once the debts were paid, John Crockett told his son that he was free to leave. David returned to Canady&#x27;s employment, where he stayed for four years.

===Marriages and children===
Crockett fell in love with John Canady&#x27;s niece Amy Summer, who was engaged to Canady&#x27;s son Robert. While serving as part of the wedding party, Crockett met Margaret Elder. He persuaded her to marry him, and a marriage contract was drawn up on October 21, 1805. However, Margaret had also become engaged to another young man at the same time, whom she married instead of Crockett.

He met Polly Finley and her mother Jean at a harvest festival. Although friendly towards him in the beginning, Jean Finley eventually felt Crockett was not the man for her daughter. Crockett declared his intentions to marry Polly, regardless of whether the ceremony was allowed to take place in her parents&#x27; home or had to be performed elsewhere. He arranged for a justice of the peace and took out a marriage license on August 12, 1806. On August 16, he rode to Polly&#x27;s house with family and friends, determined to ride off with Polly to be married elsewhere. Polly&#x27;s father pleaded with Crockett to have the wedding in the Finley home. Crockett agreed only after Jean apologized for her past treatment of him. 

The newlyweds settled on land near Polly&#x27;s parents, and their first child, John Wesley Crockett, who became a United States Congressman, was born July 10, 1807. Their second child, William Finley Crockett, was born November 25, 1808. In October 1811, the family relocated to Lincoln County. Their third child Margaret Finley (Polly) Crockett was born on November 25, 1812. The Crocketts then moved to Franklin County in 1813. He named the new home on Beans Creek &quot;Kentuck&quot;. His wife died in March 1815, and Crockett asked his brother John and his sister-in-law to move in with him to help care for the children. That same year, he married the widow Elizabeth Patton, who had a daughter, Margaret Ann, and a son, George. David and Elizabeth&#x27;s son, Robert Patton, was born September 16, 1816. Daughter Rebecca Elvira was born December 25, 1818. Daughter Matilda was born August 2, 1821.

===David Crockett family tree===
==Tennessee militia service==

Andrew Jackson was appointed major general of the Tennessee militia in 1802. The Fort Mims massacre occurred near Mobile, Mississippi Territory, on August 30, 1813, and became a rallying cry for the Creek War. On September 20, Crockett left his family and enlisted as a scout for a term of 90 days with Francis Jones&#x27;s Company of Mounted Rifleman, part of the Second Regiment of Volunteer Mounted Riflemen. They served under Colonel John Coffee in the war, marching south into present-day Alabama and taking an active part in the fighting. Crockett often hunted wild game for the soldiers, and felt better suited to that role than killing Creek warriors. He served until December 24, 1813.

The War of 1812 was being waged concurrently with the Creek War. After the Treaty of Fort Jackson in August 1814, Andrew Jackson, then with the U.S. Army, wanted the British forces ousted from Spanish Florida and asked for support from the Tennessee militia. Crockett re-enlisted as third sergeant for a six-month term with the Tennessee Mounted Gunmen under Captain John Cowan on September 28, 1814. Crockett&#x27;s unit saw little of the main action because they were days behind the rest of the troops and were focused mostly on foraging for food. Crockett returned home in December. He was still on a military reserve status until March 1815, so he hired a young man to fulfill the remainder of his service.

==Public career==

In 1817, Crockett moved the family to new acreage in Lawrence County, where he first entered public office as a commissioner helping to configure the new county&#x27;s boundaries. On November 25, the state legislature appointed him county justice of the peace. On March 27, 1818, he was elected lieutenant colonel of the Fifty-seventh Regiment of Tennessee Militia, defeating candidate Daniel Matthews for the position. By 1819, Crockett was operating multiple businesses in the area and felt his public responsibilities were beginning to consume so much of his time and energy that he had little left for either family or business. He resigned from the office of justice of the peace and from his position with the regiment.

===Tennessee General Assembly===
In 1821, he resigned as commissioner and successfully ran for a seat in the Tennessee General Assembly, representing Lawrence and Hickman counties. It was this election where Crockett honed his anecdotal oratory skills. He was appointed to the Committee of Propositions and Grievances on September 17, 1821, and served through the first session that ended November 17, as well as the special session called by the governor in the summer of 1822, ending on August 24. He favored legislation to ease the tax burden on the poor. Crockett spent his entire legislative career fighting for the rights of impoverished settlers who he felt dangled on the precipice of losing title to their land due to the state&#x27;s complicated system of grants. He supported 1821 gubernatorial candidate William Carroll, over Andrew Jackson&#x27;s endorsed candidate Edward Ward.

Less than two weeks after Crockett&#x27;s 1821 election to the General Assembly, a flood of the Tennessee River destroyed Crockett&#x27;s businesses. In November, Elizabeth&#x27;s father Robert Patton deeded of his Carroll County property to Crockett. Crockett sold off most of the acreage to help settle his debts, and moved his family to the remaining acreage on the Obion River, which remained in Carroll County until 1825 when the boundaries were reconfigured and put it in Gibson County. In 1823, he ran against Andrew Jackson&#x27;s nephew-in-law William Edward Butler and won a seat in the General Assembly representing the counties of Carroll, Humphreys, Perry, Henderson and Madison. He served in the first session, which ran from September through the end of November 1823, and in the second session that ran September through the end of November 1824, championing the rights of the impoverished farmers. During Andrew Jackson&#x27;s election to the United States Senate in 1823, Crockett backed his opponent John Williams.

===United States House of Representatives===
On October 25, 1824, Crockett notified his constituents of his intention to run in the 1825 election for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lost that election to incumbent Adam Rankin Alexander. A chance meeting in 1826 gained him the encouragement of Memphis mayor Marcus Brutus Winchester to try again to win a seat in Congress. The &quot;Jackson Gazette&quot; published a letter from Crockett on September 15, 1826, announcing his intention of again challenging Rankin, and stating his opposition to the policies of President John Quincy Adams and Secretary of State Henry Clay and to Rankin&#x27;s position on the cotton tariff. Militia veteran William Arnold also entered the race, and Crockett easily defeated both political opponents for the 1827–29 term. He arrived in Washington, D.C. and took up residence at Mrs. Ball&#x27;s Boarding House, where a number of other legislators lived when Congress was in session. Jackson was elected as president in 1828. Crockett continued his legislative focus on settlers getting a fair deal for land titles, offering H.R. 27 amendment to a bill sponsored by James K. Polk.

Crockett was re-elected for the 1829–31 session, once again defeating Adam Rankin Alexander. He introduced H.R. 185 amendment to the land bill on January 29, 1830, but it was defeated on May 3. On February 25, 1830, he introduced a resolution to abolish the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York because he felt that it was public money going to benefit the sons of wealthy men. He spoke out against Congress giving $100,000 to the widow of Stephen Decatur, citing that Congress was not empowered to do that. He opposed Jackson&#x27;s 1830 Indian Removal Act and was the only member of the Tennessee delegation to vote against it. Cherokee chief John Ross sent him a letter on January 13, 1831, expressing his thanks for Crockett&#x27;s vote. His vote was not popular with his own district, and he was defeated in the 1831 election by William Fitzgerald.

Crockett ran against Fitzgerald again in the 1833 election and was returned to Congress, serving until 1835. On January 2, 1834, he introduced the land title resolution H.R. 126, but it never made it as far as being debated on the House floor. He was defeated for re-election in the August 1835 election by Adam Huntsman. During his last term in Congress, he collaborated with Kentucky Congressman Thomas Chilton to write his autobiography, which was published by E. L. Carey and A. Hart in 1834 as &quot;A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett, Written by Himself&quot;, and he went east to promote the book. In 1836, newspapers published the now-famous quotation attributed to Crockett upon his return to his home state: 
I told the people of my district that I would serve them as faithfully as I had done; but if not, they might go to hell, and I would go to Texas.

Despite Crockett&#x27;s opposition to the institution of slavery in the United States, he did enslave people.

==Texas Revolution==

By December 1834, Crockett was writing to friends about moving to Texas if Jackson&#x27;s chosen successor Martin Van Buren was elected president. The next year, he discussed with his friend Benjamin McCulloch raising a company of volunteers to take to Texas in the expectation that a revolution was imminent. His departure to Texas was delayed by a court appearance in the last week of October as co-executor of his deceased father-in-law&#x27;s estate; he finally left his home near Rutherford in West Tennessee with three other men on November 1, 1835, to explore Texas. His youngest child Matilda later wrote that she distinctly remembered the last time that she saw her father:

Crockett traveled with 30 well-armed men to Jackson, Tennessee, where he gave a speech from the steps of the Madison County courthouse, and they arrived in Little Rock, Arkansas, on November 12, 1835. The local newspapers reported that hundreds of people swarmed into town to get a look at Crockett, and a group of leading citizens put on a dinner in his honor that night at the Jeffries Hotel. Crockett spoke &quot;mainly to the subject of Texan independence&quot;, as well as Washington politics.

Crockett arrived in Nacogdoches, Texas, in early January 1836. On January 14, he and 65 other men signed an oath before Judge John Forbes to the Provisional Government of Texas for six months: &quot;I have taken the oath of government and have enrolled my name as a volunteer and will set out for the Rio Grande in a few days with the volunteers from the United States.&quot; Each man was promised about of land as payment. On February 6, he and five other men rode into San Antonio de Bexar and camped just outside the town.

Crockett arrived at the Alamo Mission in San Antonio on February 8. A Mexican army arrived on February 23 led by General Antonio López de Santa Anna, surprising the men garrisoned in the Alamo, and the Mexican soldiers immediately initiated a siege. Santa Anna ordered his artillery to keep up a near-constant bombardment. The guns were moved closer to the Alamo each day, increasing their effectiveness. On February 25, 200–300 Mexican soldiers crossed the San Antonio River and took cover in abandoned shacks approximately from the Alamo walls. The soldiers intended to use the huts as cover to establish another artillery position, although many Texians assumed that they actually were launching an assault on the fort. Several men volunteered to burn the huts. To provide cover, the Alamo cannons fired grapeshot at the Mexican soldiers, and Crockett and his men fired rifles, while other defenders reloaded extra weapons for them to use in maintaining a steady fire. The battle was over within 90 minutes, and the Mexican soldiers retreated. There were limited stores of powder and shot inside the Alamo, and Alamo commander William Barret Travis ordered the artillery to stop returning fire on February 26 so as to conserve precious ammunition. Crockett and his men were encouraged to keep shooting, as they were unusually effective.
As the siege progressed, Travis sent many messages asking for reinforcements. Several messengers were sent to James Fannin who commanded the group of Texian soldiers at Presidio La Bahia in Goliad, Texas. Fannin decided that it was too risky to reinforce the Alamo, although historian Thomas Ricks Lindley concludes that up to 50 of Fannin&#x27;s men left his command to go to Bexar. These men would have reached Cibolo Creek on the afternoon of March 3, from the Alamo, where they joined another group of men who also planned to join the garrison.

There was a skirmish between Mexican and Texian troops that same night outside the Alamo. Historian Walter Lord speculates that the Texians were creating a diversion to allow their courier John Smith to evade Mexican pickets. However, Alamo survivor Susannah Dickinson said in 1876 that Travis sent out three men shortly after dark on March 3, probably a response to the arrival of Mexican reinforcements. The three men—including Crockett—were sent to find Fannin. Lindley states that Crockett and one of the other men found the force of Texians waiting along Cibolo Creek just before midnight; they had advanced to within of the Alamo. Just before daylight on March 4, part of the Texian force managed to break through the Mexican lines and enter the Alamo. A second group was driven across the prairie by Mexican cavalry.

The siege ended on March 6 when the Mexican army attacked just before dawn while the defenders were sleeping. The daily artillery bombardment had been suspended, perhaps a ploy to encourage the natural human reaction to a cessation of constant strain. But the garrison awakened and the final fight began. Most of the noncombatants gathered in the church sacristy for safety. According to Dickinson, Crockett paused briefly in the chapel to say a prayer before running to his post. The Mexican soldiers climbed up the north outer walls of the Alamo complex, and most of the Texians fell back to the barracks and the chapel, as previously planned. Crockett and his men, however, were too far from the barracks to take shelter and were the last remaining group to be in the open. They defended the low wall in front of the church, using their rifles as clubs and relying on knives, as the action was too furious to allow reloading. After a volley and a charge with bayonets, Mexican soldiers pushed the few remaining defenders back toward the church. 
The Battle of the Alamo lasted almost 90 minutes, and all of the defenders were killed. Santa Anna ordered his men to take their bodies to a nearby stand of trees, where they were stacked together and wood piled on top. That evening, they lit a fire and burned their bodies to ashes. The ashes were left undisturbed until February 1837, when Juan Seguin and his cavalry returned to Bexar to examine the remains. A local carpenter created a simple coffin, and ashes from the funeral pyres were placed inside. The names of Travis, Crockett, and Bowie were inscribed on the lid. The coffin is thought to have been buried in a peach tree grove, but the spot was not marked and can no longer be identified.

==Death==

David Crockett died at the Alamo on the morning of March 6, 1836, at the age of 49. Accounts from survivors of the battle differ on the manner of Crockett&#x27;s death, with stories ranging from Crockett putting up a heroic last stand to the account that he surrendered along with several other men and was executed. To further confusion, historians have been able to back up opposing theories with &quot;voluminous evidence&quot;.

===Controversy===
The popular mythology of Crockett&#x27;s death in American culture is one of a heroic last stand, a tale that is backed up by some historical evidence. For example, a former African-American slave named Ben, who had acted as cook for one of Santa Anna&#x27;s officers, maintained that Crockett&#x27;s body was found in the barracks surrounded by &quot;no less than sixteen Mexican corpses&quot;, with Crockett&#x27;s knife buried in one of them. There is, however, historical evidence countering the popular myth, with stories of a Crockett surrender and execution circulating as far back as just a few weeks after the battle.

The counter myth picked up historical steam when, in 1955, Jesús Sánchez Garza discovered the memoirs of José Enrique de la Peña, a Mexican officer present at the Battle of the Alamo, and self-published it as &quot;La Rebelión de TexasManuscrito Inédito de 1836 por un Oficial de Santa Anna&quot;. Texas A&amp;M University Press published the English translation in 1975 &quot;With Santa Anna in Texas: A Personal Narrative of the Revolution&quot;. The English publication caused a scandal within the United States, as it asserted that Crockett did not die in battle, but was executed soon thereafter. The translator of the English publication, Carmen Perry, the former librarian of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, was harassed with anonymous letters and intimidating phone calls by Crockett loyalists who considered the mere suggestion that Crockett had not died fighting blasphemous.

Some have questioned the validity of the text. Author and retired firefighter William Groneman III posited that the journals were made up of several different types of paper from several different paper manufacturers, all cut down to fit. Longtime John Wayne enthusiast Joseph Musso also questioned the validity of de la Peña&#x27;s diary, basing his suspicions on the timing of the diary&#x27;s release, and the fact that historical interest in the topic rose around the same time as the Walt Disney mini-series &quot;Davy Crockett&quot; was released in 1955. Some questions were answered when, in 2001, archivist David Gracy published a detailed analysis of the manuscript, including lab results. He found, among other things, that the paper and ink were of a type used by the Mexican army in the 1830s, and the handwriting matched that on other documents in the Mexican military archives that were written or signed by de la Peña.
As for those who have questioned de la Peña&#x27;s ability to identify any of the Alamo defenders by name, historians believe that de la Peña likely witnessed or was told about executions of the Alamo survivors. And while some claim neither he nor his comrades would have known who those men were, others conclude that the &quot;enormous weight of evidence&quot; is in favor of the surrender-execution hypothesis. However, several survivors and first-hand witnesses to the battle claimed Crockett fought to the death. Furthermore, no other officer under Santa Anna&#x27;s command mentions Crockett&#x27;s surrender, not even his personal secretary Ramon Caro. Later in life, Santa Anna wrote a memoir only stating that Davy Crockett&#x27;s body was &quot;among the corpses&quot; without giving context to how he died. Santa Anna further wrote &quot;Not one soldier showed signs of desiring to surrender.&quot;

==Legacy==

One of Crockett&#x27;s sayings, many of which were published in almanacs between 1835 and 1856 (along with those of Daniel Boone and Kit Carson), was: &quot;Always be sure you are right, then go ahead&quot;.&quot;&quot;

While serving in the United States House of Representatives, Crockett became a Freemason. He entrusted his masonic apron to a friend in Tennessee before leaving for Texas, and it was inherited by the friend&#x27;s descendant in Kentucky.

In 1967, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 5-cent stamp commemorating Davy Crockett.

==In popular culture==
===Television===
Walt Disney adapted Crockett&#x27;s stories into a television miniseries titled &quot;Davy Crockett&quot;, which aired in 1954 and 1955 on &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Disneyland&quot;. The series popularized the image of Crockett, portrayed by Fess Parker, wearing a coonskin cap, and originated the song &quot;The Ballad of Davy Crockett&quot;. The first three parts of the series were edited into a feature-length movie for theaters.

Crockett&#x27;s stories were used by the French animation Studios Animage for a 1994 animated series titled &quot;Davy Crockett&quot;.

A 2009 episode of &quot;MythBusters&quot; tested whether Crockett could split a bullet in half on the blade of an ax away, and concluded that it would indeed be possible to do so.

===Prose fiction===
Crockett appears in at least two short alternate history works: &quot;Chickasaw Slave&quot; by Judith Moffett in Mike Resnick&#x27;s anthology &quot;Alternate Presidents&quot; (1992), where Crockett is the seventh President of the United States, and &quot;Empire&quot; by William Sanders in Harry Turtledove&#x27;s anthology &quot;Alternate Generals II&quot; (2002) where Crockett fights for Emperor Napoleon I of Louisiana in a conflict analogous to the War of 1812. Crockett is also a character in Gore Vidal&#x27;s novel &quot;Burr&quot; as a congressman from Tennessee.

===Comics===
Columbia Features syndicated a comic strip, &quot;Davy Crockett, Frontiersman&quot;, from June 20, 1955, until 1959. Stories were by France Herron and the artwork was ghosted in early 1956 by Jack Kirby.

<text>The British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) was a British aircraft manufacturer formed from the government-pressured merger of English Electric Aviation Ltd., Vickers-Armstrongs (Aircraft), the Bristol Aeroplane Company and Hunting Aircraft in 1960. Bristol, English Electric and Vickers became &quot;parents&quot; of BAC with shareholdings of 20%, 40% and 40% respectively. BAC in turn acquired the share capital of their aviation interests and 70% of Hunting Aircraft several months later.

==History==
===Formation===

BAC&#x27;s origins can be traced to a statement issued by the British government that it expected the various companies involved in the aircraft, guided weapons and engine industries to consolidate and merge with one another. Furthermore, the government also promised incentives to motivate such restructuring; the maintenance of government research and development spending and the guarantee of aid in launching &quot;promising new types of civil aircraft&quot;. One particularly high-profile incentive was the contract for a new large supersonic strike aircraft, which would become the BAC TSR-2.

Accordingly, during 1960, BAC was created as a jointly-owned corporation by Vickers, English Electric and Bristol. Internally, the business had two divisions – the Aircraft Division under Sir George Edwards and the Guided Weapons Division under Viscount Caldecote. The aircraft operations of the three parents were now subsidiaries of BAC; &quot;Bristol Aircraft Ltd&quot;, &quot;English Electric Aviation Ltd&quot; (with Viscount Caldecote as general manager) and &quot;Vickers-Armstrongs (Aircraft) Ltd&quot; (under Sir George Edwards). BAC also had a controlling interest in Hunting Aircraft. The parents still had significant aviation interests outside BAC. English Electric had Napier &amp; Son aero-engines, Bristol had 50% of Bristol Aerojet and Bristol Siddeley engines and smaller investments in Westland and Short Brothers &amp; Harland.

Upon the formation of BAC, the Bristol Aeroplane Company (Car Division) was not included in the consolidation. Instead, it was carved off by Sir George White, whose family had founded the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company in 1910 (later the Bristol Aeroplane Company).

BAC&#x27;s head office was on the top floors of the 100 Pall Mall building in the City of Westminster, London.

===Early endeavours===

The majority of BAC&#x27;s aircraft designs had been inherited from the individual companies that formed it. BAC did not apply its new identity retrospectively, hence the VC10 remained the Vickers VC10. Instead the company applied its name to marketing initiatives, the VC10 advertising carried the name &quot;Vickers-Armstrongs (Aircraft) Limited, a member company of the British Aircraft Corporation&quot;. The first model to bear the BAC name was the BAC One-Eleven (BAC 1–11), a Hunting Aircraft study, in 1961. Given the numerous government contract cancellations during the 1960s, the BAC 1–11, which had been launched as a private venture, probably saved the company.

Prior to the merger, Bristol had eschewed the subsonic airliner market in favour of working on the Bristol 223 supersonic transport, The effort continued under BAC and was eventually merged with similar efforts underway at the French aircraft company Sud Aviation, resulting in the Anglo-French Concorde. Described by &quot;Flight International&quot; as an &quot;aviation icon&quot; and &quot;one of aerospace&#x27;s most ambitious but commercially flawed projects&quot;, sales of the type were lackluster against conventional subsonic airliners, primarily due to the emergence of wide-body aircraft, such as the Boeing 747, which made subsonic airliners significantly more efficient. While by March 1969, the consortium had arrangements totalling 74 options from 16 airlines, only two airlines, Air France and the British Overseas Airways Corporation, would proceed with their orders. Scheduled services commenced on 21 January 1976 on both the London–Bahrain and Paris–Rio de Janeiro routes.
In 1963, BAC acquired the previously autonomous guided weapons divisions of English Electric and Bristol to form a new subsidiary, British Aircraft Corporation (Guided Weapons). The company enjoyed some success, including development of the Rapier, Sea Skua and Sea Wolf missiles. BAC eventually expanded this division to include electronics and space systems and, in 1966, started what was to become a fruitful relationship with Hughes Aircraft. Hughes awarded major contracts to BAC, including sub-systems for Intelsat satellites.

BAC had inherited the aerospace activities of several companies via its formation, and research into various space-related ventures continued at the new entity. One of BAC&#x27;s research teams, headed by engineer Tom Smith, Chief of the Aerospace Department at BAC, that was initially investigating supersonic and hypersonic flight problems, became interested in the application of such a vehicle for space-related activities, leading to the BAC Mustard, a reusable launch system that comprised several near-identical winged vehicles. In the most detailed design, Mustard was to have weighed roughly 420 tonnes prior to launch, and been capable of delivering a three tonne payload to a geostationary earth orbit (GEO). According to author Nigel Henbest, Britain was likely unable to pursue Mustard&#x27;s development alone, but suggested organising a multinational European venture, similar to the conventional Europa and Ariane launchers. The knowledge and expertise developed on this project was subsequently harnessed on later efforts, most prominently the re-usable HOTOL spaceplane project of the 1980s.

Development of the TSR-2 was one of the company&#x27;s most high-profile projects. However, as the programme proceeded, continuous cost rises were incurred, while inter-service rivalry led to frequent challenges of its necessity. During April 1965, the British government announced that it had decided to withdraw its order for the TSR-2, leaving it without an established customer. By this point, the programme was already in the prototype phase and the aircraft had already flown, but political pressure forced development work to cease, leading to the remaining airframes and most supporting equipment and documentation to be destroyed. The TSR-2&#x27;s last minute termination has been widely viewed as a major blow not only to BAC but the wider British aircraft industry.

===New ventures===
On 17 May 1965, the British and French governments announced the signing of a pair of agreements to cover the two joint projects; one based on the French aircraft company Breguet Aviation Br.121 ECAT (&quot;Tactical Combat Support Trainer&quot;) proposal; this would evolve into the SEPECAT Jaguar. The other was the BAC/Dassault AFVG (Anglo-French Variable Geometry), a larger, variable geometry carrier-capable fighter aircraft for the French Navy (&quot;Aéronavale&quot;) as well as fulfilling interceptor, tactical strike and reconnaissance roles for the RAF. The AFVG was to be jointly developed by BAC and Dassault Aviation, while the proposed M45G turbofan engine to power the aircraft was to also be jointly developed by SNECMA and Bristol Siddeley. However, during June 1967, the French government announced its withdrawal from the AFVG effort ostensibly on the grounds of cost.
During May 1966, BAC and Breguet formally created SEPECAT, a joint venture company, to develop, market, and produce the Anglo-French Jaguar strike fighter. The Jaguar programme ultimately took the place of several earlier efforts, including the AFVG. The first of the Jaguar&#x27;s eight prototypes flew on 8 September 1968. During 1973, service entry was achieved with the French Air Force, by which time Breguet had become part of Dassault Aviation. SEPECAT received various export orders for the Jaguar, overseas nations that flew the type included India, Ecuador, Nigeria and Oman. Dassault were less supportive of SEPECAT, preferring to promote its own aircraft; several potential customers for the Jaguar were convinced to order Dassault&#x27;s Mirage series instead.

During 1964, both BAC and its principal domestic rival, Hawker Siddeley, conducted detailed studies on the prospects of producing stretched versions of their existing airliners, the VC10 and the Hawker Siddeley Trident. In the first half of the following year, BAC submitted its proposals for the production of two separate double-decker versions of the VC10, which was commonly referred to as the &quot;Super VC10&quot;; however, it was quickly recognised that the British government would be required substantial support for the initiative to succeed, involving &quot;several tens of millions of pounds&quot;. According to aviation author Derek Wood, the enlarged double-decker, which was to be equipped with the proposed Rolls-Royce RB178 turbofan engine, would have had good commercial prospects, yet financing for the programme was not forthcoming and the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) has ultimately opted to procure the rival Boeing 747 instead.

In 1967, the British, French and German governments agreed to start development of the 300-seat Airbus A300. BAC argued against the proposal in favour of their BAC Three-Eleven project, intended as a large wide-bodied airliner like the Airbus A300, Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed TriStar. Like the One-Eleven, it would have carried two Rolls-Royce turbofan engines, mounted near the tail, but have been able to accommodate up to 245 passengers seated in an eight abreast configuration at a 34-inch pitch (or up to 300 passengers at a 30-inch pitch). The British national airline British European Airways (BEA) was publicly interested in the type; during August 1970, BEA&#x27;s chairman, Sir Anthony Milward, declared his personal optimism for the Three-Eleven. However, Britain&#x27;s potential Common Market partners warned that, since the Three-Eleven would directly compete against the European Airbus, around which they had largely coalesced, the project effectively undermined British loyalty to the EEC which, at this point, the British government was interested in joining. On 2 December 1970, Frederick Corfield, the Minister for Aviation Supply, announced in the House of Commons that there would be no official backing from the government for the Three-Eleven programme.

===Saudi Arabia===
During the early 1960s, the Saudi Arabian government announced its intention to launch a massive defence acquisition programme involving the replacement of the country&#x27;s fighter aircraft and the establishment of an advanced air defence and communications network. American companies seemed guaranteed to win much of this work, however, the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) would ultimately be supplied with large amounts of British-made aircraft and equipment to fulfill their needs.

By 1964, BAC conducted demonstration flights of their Lightning in Riyadh and, in 1965, Saudi Arabia signed a letter of intent to purchase Lightning and Strikemaster aircraft as well as Thunderbird surface-to-air missiles. The main contract was signed in 1966 for forty Lightnings and twenty-five (ultimately forty) Strikemasters. In 1973, the Saudi government signed an agreement with the British government which specified BAC as the contractor for all parts of the defence system (AEI was previously contracted to supply the radar equipment and Airwork Services provided servicing and training). Overall spending by the RSAF was over £1 billion GBP.

BAC, with the Lightning/Strikemaster contract; British Aerospace, with the Al Yamamah contracts; and most recently BAE Systems, with the order for Typhoon multi-role fighters, have all benefited from large arms contracts with Saudi Arabia.

===Tornado===
In June 1967, the AFVG was cancelled due to the withdrawal of French participation. Britain then turned to a national project, the UK Variable Geometry (UKVG), for which BAC Warton was given a design contract by the Ministry of Technology. These studies eventually became known as the BAC Advanced Combat Aircraft programme. In 1968, Britain was invited to join Canada and the F-104 Consortium (a grouping of Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands), all of whom wished to replace their current aircraft with a common design, subsequently described as the Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA).

On 26 March 1969, Panavia Aircraft GmbH was formed by BAC, MBB, Fiat and Fokker. In May, a &quot;project definition phase&quot; was commenced, concluding in early 1970. Two aircraft designs resulted: the single-seat Panavia 100 and the twin-seat Panavia 200. The RAF favoured the 200, as did Germany after its initial enthusiasm for the 100.

In September 1971, the governments of Britain, Italy and Germany signed an Intention to Proceed (ITP) with the Panavia Tornado. On 30 October 1974, the first British prototype (the second to fly) took off from the BAC airfield at Warton. The three governments signed the contract for Batch 1 of the aircraft on 29 July 1976. BAC and subsequently British Aerospace would deliver 228 Tornado GR1s and 152 Tornado F3s to the RAF.

===Merger speculation and nationalisation===
For most of its history, BAC was the subject of rumour and speculation that it was to merge with Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA). On 21 November 1966, Fred Mulley, the Minister of Aviation, announced in the House of Commons that:
The government envisaged acquiring BAC&#x27;s capital and merging it with Hawker Siddeley. The ownership of BAC would thus give the government a minority stake in the new company. Although BAC&#x27;s parent companies were prepared to sell their shares for a reasonable price, the government proposal, in their view, undervalued the group. By August 1967, the success of the BAC 1–11 and defence sales to Saudi Arabia made the prospect of the parent companies selling their shares less likely. In December 1967, Tony Benn, the Minister of Technology, while reiterating his desire to see a merged BAC and HSA, admitted it would not be possible.

Akin to BAC, the Hawker Siddeley Group was expanded by merger, while engine design and manufacturing was concentrated at Rolls-Royce and the newly formed Bristol-Siddeley Engines. Helicopter development was given to Westland Helicopters.

During 1966, Rolls-Royce acquired Bristol Aeroplane from BAC, integrating the firm into its Bristol Siddeley aero-engine business, but declared it had no interest in the BAC shareholding. Despite this, Rolls-Royce still had not disposed of its BAC shareholding when the business was declared to be bankrupt during 1971. The 20% share was eventually acquired from receivership by Vickers and GEC, which had acquired English Electric during 1968.

On 29 April 1977, BAC, the Hawker Siddeley Group and Scottish Aviation were nationalised and merged under the provisions of Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977. This new group was established as a statutory corporation, British Aerospace (BAe).

<doc id="81088" wikidata="Q919529" url="?curid=81088" title="List of cities and counties in Virginia">
<text>The Commonwealth of Virginia is divided into 95 counties, along with 38 independent cities that are considered county-equivalents for census purposes, totaling 133 second-level subdivisions. In Virginia, cities are co-equal levels of government to counties, but towns are part of counties. For some counties, for statistical purposes, the Bureau of Economic Analysis combines any independent cities with the county that it was once part of (before the legislation creating independent cities took place in 1871).

Many county seats are politically not a part of the counties they serve; under Virginia law, all municipalities incorporated as cities are independent cities and are not part of any county. Some of the cities in the Hampton Roads area, including Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Newport News, Hampton, and Suffolk were formed from an entire county. These cities are no longer county seats, since the counties ceased to exist once the cities were completely formed but are functionally equivalent to counties. Also in Virginia, a county seat may be an independent city surrounded by, but not part of, the county of which it is the administrative center; for example, Fairfax City is both the county seat of Fairfax County and is completely surrounded by Fairfax County, but the city is politically independent of the county.
Many towns are as large as cities but are not incorporated as cities and are situated within a parent county or counties. Seven independent cities had 2020 populations of less than 10,000 with the smallest, Norton having a population of only 3,687. In 2020, the largest towns were Leesburg (with 48,250 people) and Blacksburg (44,826). Six other towns also had populations of over 10,000 people. For a complete list of these towns, see List of towns in Virginia. For major unincorporated population centers, see List of unincorporated communities in Virginia.

Virginia&#x27;s independent cities were classified by the Virginia General Assembly in 1871 as cities of the first class and cities of the second class. The Virginia Constitution of 1902 defined first class cities as those having a population of 10,000 or more based upon the last census enumeration while second class cities were those that had a population of less than 10,000. Cities that previously been granted a city charter, but did not have the requisite population, had their status grandfathered in. 

Second class did not have a court of record and were required to share the cost of that court with their adjacent county and also shared the cost for three constitutional officers of that court—generally, the clerk, commonwealth attorney and sheriff—and those shared officers stood for election in both the city and the county. At least two constitutional officers—treasurer and commissioner of the revenue—were required to be elected solely by the residents of the city. The distinction between first and second class cities was ended with the Virginia Constitution of 1971. However, cities that were classified as second class cities at the time of the adoption of the 1971 Virginia Constitution were authorized to continue sharing their court system and three constitutional officers with the adjacent county. , 14 of Virginia&#x27;s independent cities retain these features.

There are several counties and cities that have the same name but are separate politically. These currently include Fairfax, Franklin, Richmond, and Roanoke. In the past they also included Norfolk and Alexandria, whose counties changed their names, ostensibly to end some of the confusion; as well as Bedford, where a city was surrounded by a county of the same name from 1968 until 2013, when the city reverted to town status. A city and county that share a name may be completely unrelated in geography. For example, Richmond County is nowhere near the City of Richmond, and Franklin County is even farther from the City of Franklin.

More Virginia counties are named for women than in any other state.

Virginia&#x27;s postal abbreviation is VA and its FIPS state code is 51.

<text>The Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, also known as the Defence of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, was an engagement in the Anglo-Zulu War. The successful British defence of the mission station of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, under the command of Lieutenants John Chard of the Royal Engineers and Gonville Bromhead, of the 24th Regiment of Foot, began once a large contingent of Zulu warriors broke off from the main force during the final hour of the British defeat at the day-long Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January 1879. They travelled to attack Rorke&#x27;s Drift later that day and continuing into the following day.

Just over 150 British and colonial troops defended the station against attacks by 3,000 to 4,000 Zulu warriors. The massive but attacks by the Zulu on Rorke&#x27;s Drift came very close to overwhelming the much smaller garrison, but were consistently repelled. Eleven Victoria Crosses were awarded to individual defenders, along with a number of other decorations and honours.

==Prelude==
Rorke&#x27;s Drift, known as (&quot;Jim&#x27;s Land&quot;) in the Zulu language, was a mission station of the Church of Sweden, and the former trading post of James Rorke, a merchant from the eastern Cape of Irish descent. It was located near a drift, or ford, on the Buffalo (Mzinyathi) River, which at the time formed the border between the British colony of Natal and the Zulu Kingdom. On 9 January 1879, the British No. 3 (Centre) Column, under Lord Chelmsford, arrived and encamped at the drift.

On 11 January, the day after the British ultimatum to the Zulus expired, the column crossed the river and encamped on the Zulu bank. A small force consisting of B Company, 2nd Battalion, 24th (2nd Warwickshire) Regiment of Foot (2nd/24th) under Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead was detailed to garrison the post, which had been turned into a supply depot and hospital under the overall command of Brevet Major Henry Spalding, 104th Foot, a member of Chelmsford&#x27;s staff.

On 20 January, after reconnaissance patrolling and building of a track for its wagons, Chelmsford&#x27;s column marched to Isandlwana, approximately to the east, leaving behind the small garrison. A large company of the 2nd/3rd Natal Native Contingent (NNC) under Captain William Stevenson was ordered to remain at the post to strengthen the garrison. This company numbered between 100 and 350 men.

Captain Thomas Rainforth&#x27;s G Company of the 1st/24th Foot was ordered to move up from its station at Helpmekaar, to the southeast, after its own relief arrived, to further reinforce the position. Later that evening a portion of the No. 2 Column under Brevet Colonel Anthony Durnford, late of the Royal Engineers, arrived at the drift and camped on the Zulu bank, where it remained through the next day.
Late on the evening of 21 January, Durnford was ordered to Isandlwana, as was a small detachment of No. 5 Field Company, Royal Engineers, commanded by Lieutenant John Chard, which had arrived on the 19th to repair the pontoons that bridged the Buffalo. Chard rode ahead of his detachment to Isandlwana on the morning of 22 January to clarify his orders, but was sent back to Rorke&#x27;s Drift with only his wagon and its driver to construct defensive positions for the expected reinforcement company, passing Durnford&#x27;s column &quot;en route&quot; in the opposite direction.

Some time around noon on 22 January, Major Spalding left the station for Helpmekaar to ascertain the whereabouts of Rainforth&#x27;s G Company, which was now overdue. He left Chard in temporary command. Chard rode down to the drift itself where the engineers&#x27; camp was located. Soon thereafter, two survivors from Isandlwana – Lieutenant Gert Adendorff of the 1st/3rd NNC and a trooper from the Natal Carbineers – arrived bearing the news of the defeat and that a part of the Zulu impi was approaching the station.

Upon hearing this news, Chard, Bromhead, and another of the station&#x27;s officers, Acting Assistant Commissary James Dalton (of the Commissariat and Transport Department), held a quick meeting to decide the best course of action – whether to attempt a retreat to Helpmekaar or to defend their current position. Dalton pointed out that a small column, travelling in open country and burdened with carts full of hospital patients, would be easily overtaken and defeated by a numerically superior Zulu force, and so it was soon agreed that the only acceptable course was to remain and fight.

=== Defensive preparations ===
Once the British officers decided to stay, Chard and Bromhead directed their men to make preparations to defend the station. With the garrison&#x27;s 400-odd men working diligently a defensive perimeter was quickly constructed out of mealie bags, biscuit boxes and crates of tinned meat. This perimeter incorporated the storehouse, the hospital, and a stout stone kraal. The buildings were fortified, with loopholes (firing holes) knocked through the external walls and the external doors barricaded with furniture.

At about 3:30 p.m., a mixed troop of about 100 Natal Native Horse (NNH) under Lieutenant Alfred Henderson arrived at the station after having retreated in good order from Isandlwana. They volunteered to picket the far side of the Oscarberg (&quot;Shiyane&quot;), the large hill that overlooked the station and from behind which the Zulus were expected to approach.
With the defences nearing completion and battle approaching, Chard had several hundred men available to him: Bromhead&#x27;s B Company, Stevenson&#x27;s large NNC company, Henderson&#x27;s NNH troop, and various others (most of them hospital patients, but &#x27;walking wounded&#x27;) drawn from various British and colonial units. Adendorff also stayed, while the trooper who had ridden in with him galloped on to warn the garrison at Helpmekaar.

The force was sufficient, in Chard&#x27;s estimation, to fend off the Zulus. Chard posted the British soldiers around the perimeter, adding some of the more able patients, the &#x27;casuals&#x27; and civilians, and those of the NNC who possessed firearms along the barricade. The rest of the NNC, armed only with spears, were posted outside the mealie bag and biscuit box barricade within the stone-walled cattle kraal.

The approaching Zulu force was vastly larger; the uDloko, uThulwana, and inDlondo (regiments) of married men aged in their 30s and 40s and the inDlu-yengwe of young unmarried men mustered 3,000 to 4,000 warriors, none of them engaged during the battle at Isandlwana. This Zulu force was the &#x27;loins&#x27; or reserve of the army at Isandlwana and is often referred to as the Undi Corps. It was directed to swing wide of the British left flank and pass west and south of Isandlwana hill itself, in order to position itself across the line of communication and retreat of the British and their colonial allies in order to prevent their escape back into Natal by way of the Buffalo River ford leading to Rorke&#x27;s Drift.

By the time the Undi Corps reached Rorke&#x27;s Drift at 4:30 p.m., they had fast-marched some from the morning encampment they had left at around 8 a.m., then to spend some 11.5 hours continuously storming the British fortifications at Rorke&#x27;s Drift.

Most Zulu warriors were armed with an (short spear) and a &quot;nguni shield&quot; made of cowhide. The Zulu army drilled in the personal and tactical use and coordination of this weapon. Some Zulus also had old muskets, antiquated rifles, and some captured Martini-Henrys as used by the defenders, though their marksmanship training was poor, and the supply of powder and shot was low, and of poor quality. 

The Zulu attitude towards firearms was that: &quot;The generality of Zulu warriors, however, would not have firearms – the arms of a coward, as they said, for they enable the to kill the brave without awaiting his attack.&quot; Even though their fire was not accurate, it was responsible for five of the 17 British deaths at Rorke&#x27;s Drift.

While the Undi Corps had been led by kaMapitha at the Isandlwana battle, the command of the Undi Corps passed to Prince Dabulamanzi kaMpande (half-brother of Cetshwayo kaMpande, the Zulu king) when kaMapitha was wounded during the pursuit of British survivors from Isandlwana. Prince Dabulamanzi was considered rash and aggressive, and this characterisation was borne out by his violation of King Cetshwayo&#x27;s order to act only in defence of Zululand against the invading British soldiers and not carry the war over the border into enemy territory. The Rorke&#x27;s Drift attack was an unplanned raid rather than any organised counter-invasion, with many of the Undi Corps Zulus breaking off to raid other African kraals and homesteads while the main body advanced on Rorke&#x27;s Drift.

At about 4:00 p.m., Surgeon James Reynolds, Otto Witt – the Swedish missionary who ran the mission at Rorke&#x27;s Drift – and army chaplain Reverend George Smith came down from the Oscarberg hillside with the news that a body of Zulus was fording the river to the southeast and was &quot;no more than five minutes away&quot;. At this point, Witt decided to depart the station, as his family lived in an isolated farmhouse about away, and he wanted to be with them. Witt&#x27;s native servant, Umkwelnantaba, left with him; so too did one of the hospital patients, Lieutenant Thomas Purvis of the 1st/3rd NNC.

==Battle==
At about 4:20 p.m., the battle began with Lieutenant Henderson&#x27;s NNH troopers, stationed behind the Oscarberg, briefly engaging the vanguard of the main Zulu force. However, tired from the battle at Isandlwana and retreat to Rorke&#x27;s Drift as well as being short of carbine ammunition, Henderson&#x27;s men departed for Helpmekaar. Henderson himself reported to Lieutenant Chard the enemy were close and that &quot;his men would not obey his orders but were going off to Helpmekaar&quot;.

Henderson then followed his departing men. Upon witnessing the withdrawal of Henderson&#x27;s NNH troop, Captain Stevenson&#x27;s NNC company abandoned the cattle kraal and fled, greatly reducing the strength of the defending garrison. Outraged that Stevenson and some of his colonial NCOs had also fled from the barricades, a few British soldiers fired after them, killing Corporal William Anderson.

With the Zulus nearly at the station, the garrison now numbered between 154 and 156 men. Of these, only Bromhead&#x27;s company could be considered a cohesive unit. Additionally, up to 39 of his company were at the station as hospital patients, although only a handful of these were unable to take up arms. With fewer men, Chard realised the need to modify the defences, and gave orders that biscuit boxes be used to construct a wall through the middle of the post in order to make possible the abandonment of the hospital side of the station if the need arose.

At 4:30 p.m., the Zulus rounded the Oscarberg and approached the south wall. Private Frederick Hitch, posted as lookout atop the storehouse, reported a large column of Zulus approaching. The Zulu vanguard, 600 men of the iNdluyengwe, attacked the south wall, which joined the hospital and the storehouse. The British opened fire when the Zulus were away.
The majority of the attacking Zulu force moved around to attack the north wall, while a few took cover and were either pinned down by continuing British fire or retreated to the terraces of Oscarberg. There they began a harassing fire of their own. As this occurred, another Zulu force continued to the hospital and northwestern wall.

Those British on the barricades – including Dalton and Bromhead – were soon engaged in fierce hand-to-hand fighting. The British wall was too high for the Zulus to scale, so they resorted to crouching under the wall, trying to get hold of the defenders&#x27; Martini–Henry rifles, slashing at British soldiers with assegais or firing their weapons through the wall. At places, they clambered over each other&#x27;s bodies to drive the British off the walls but were driven back.

Zulu fire, both from those under the wall and around the Oscarberg, inflicted a few casualties, and five of the 17 defenders who were killed or mortally wounded in the action were struck while at the north wall.

=== Defence of the hospital ===
Chard realised that the north wall, under near constant attack from the Zulus, could not be held. At 6:00 p.m., he pulled his men back into the yard, abandoning the front two rooms of the hospital in the process. The hospital was becoming untenable; the loopholes had become a liability, as rifles poking out were grabbed at by the Zulus (who were still shot) yet if the holes were left empty, the Zulu warriors stuck their own weapons through in order to fire into the rooms. Among the soldiers assigned to the hospital were Corporal William Wilson Allen and Privates Cole, Dunbar, Hitch, Horrigan, John Williams, Joseph Williams, Alfred Henry Hook, Robert Jones, and William Jones.

Now low on rifle ammunition they decided to switch to revolvers. Privates Horrigan, John Williams, Joseph Williams and other patients tried to hold the hospital entrance with bayonets and revolvers. Joseph Williams defended a small window, and 14 dead Zulus were later found beneath said window. As it became clear the front of the building was being taken over by Zulus, John Williams began to hack a way of escape through the wall dividing the central room and a corner room in the back of the hospital. As he made a passable breach, the door into the central room came under furious attack from the Zulus, and he had time only to drag two bedridden patients out before the door gave way.

The corner room into which John Williams had pulled the two patients was occupied by Private Hook and another nine patients. John Williams hacked at the wall to the next room with his bayonet, as Hook held off the Zulus a firefight erupted as the Zulus fired through the door and Hook returned fire – an assegai striking his helmet and stunning him.

Williams made the hole big enough to get into the next room, occupied only by patient Private Waters, and dragged the patients through. The last man out was Hook, who killed some Zulus who had knocked down the door before he dived through the hole. John Williams once again went to work, spurred on by the fact that the roof was now ablaze. 

After 50 minutes, the hole was large enough to drag the patients through, and most of the men were now in the last room, defended by Privates Robert Jones and William Jones. From here, the patients clambered out through a window and then made their way across the yard to the barricade. Privates Waters and Beckett hid in the wardrobe, Waters was wounded and Beckett died of assegai wounds.

Of the 11 patients, nine survived the trip to the barricade, as did all the able-bodied men. According to James Henry Reynolds, four defenders were killed in the hospital: one was a member of the Natal Native Contingent with a broken leg; Sergeant Maxfield and Private Jenkins, who were ill with fever and refused to be moved were also killed. Reportedly, Jenkins was killed after being seized and stabbed, together with Private Adams who also refused to move. Private Cole, assigned to the hospital, was killed when he ran outside. Another hospital patient killed was Trooper Hunter of the Natal Mounted Police. Among the hospital patients who escaped were a Corporal Mayer of the NNC; Bombardier Lewis of the Royal Artillery, and Trooper Green of the Natal Mounted Police, who was wounded in the thigh by a bullet. Private Conley, with a broken leg, was pulled to safety by Hook, although Conley&#x27;s leg was broken again in the process.

===Cattle kraal and bastion===
The evacuation of the burning hospital completed the shortening of the perimeter. As night fell, the Zulu attacks grew stronger. The cattle kraal came under renewed assault and was evacuated by 10:00 p.m., leaving the remaining men in a small bastion around the storehouse: the British troops had withdrawn to the centre of the station, where a final defence had been hastily built. Throughout the night, the Zulus kept up a constant assault against the British positions; Zulu attacks began to slacken only after midnight, ending by 2:00 a.m., and replaced by harassing fire from Zulu firearms until 4:00 a.m.

By that time, the garrison had sustained 14 dead. Two more were mortally wounded and eight more – including Dalton – were seriously wounded. Almost every man had some kind of wound. They were all exhausted, having fought for the better part of 10 hours and were running low on ammunition. Of 20,000 rounds in reserve at the mission, only 900 remained.

==Aftermath==
As dawn broke, the British could see that the Zulus were gone; all that remained were the dead and severely wounded. Patrols were dispatched to scout the battlefield, recover rifles, and look for survivors, many of whom were killed
when found. At roughly 7:00 a.m., an impi of Zulus suddenly appeared, and the British manned their positions again.

No attack materialised, however, as the Zulus had been on the move for six days prior to the battle and had not eaten properly for two. In their ranks were hundreds of wounded, and they were several days&#x27; march from any supplies. Soon after their appearance, the Zulus left the way they had come.

Around 8:00 a.m., another force appeared, and the defenders left their breakfast to man their positions again. However, the force turned out to be the vanguard of Lord Chelmsford&#x27;s relief column.

At the end of the fighting, 351 Zulus lay dead on the battlefield. Only 17 British were killed, but almost every man in the garrison had sustained some kind of wound.

Breakdown of British and colonial casualties:
* 1st/24th Foot: 4 killed or mortally wounded in action; 2 wounded
* 2nd/24th Foot: 9 killed or mortally wounded in action; 9 wounded
* Commissariat and Transport Department: 1 killed in action; 1 wounded
* Natal Mounted Police: 1 killed in action; 1 wounded
* 1st/3rd NNC: 1 killed in action
* 2nd/3rd NNC: 1 killed; 2 wounded

The number of Zulu casualties is subject to widely varying estimates. It has been estimated that, including wounded Zulus who were killed after capture, at least 500 were killed. Having witnessed their own dead at Isandlwana, the members of Chelmsford&#x27;s relief force had killed the captured, wounded Zulus they came across, as did the station&#x27;s defenders. Trooper William James Clarke of the Natal Mounted Police described in his diary that &quot;altogether we buried 375 Zulus and some wounded were thrown into the grave. Seeing the manner in which our wounded had been mutilated after being dragged from the hospital ... we were very bitter and did not spare wounded Zulus&quot;. Laband, in his book &quot;The Zulu Response to the British Invasion of 1879&quot;, accepts the estimate of 600 that Shepstone had from the Zulus.

Samuel Pitt, who served as a private in B Company during the battle, told &quot;The Western Mail&quot; in 1914 that the official enemy death toll was too low: &quot;We reckon we had accounted for 875, but the books will tell you 400 or 500&quot;. Lieutenant Horace Smith-Dorrien, a member of Chelmsford&#x27;s staff, wrote that the day after the battle an improvised gallows was used &quot;for hanging Zulus who were supposed to have behaved treacherously.&quot;

==Awards==
Eleven Victoria Crosses were awarded to the defenders of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, seven of them to soldiers of the 2nd/24th Foot – the most ever received for a single action by one regiment. (The most awarded in a day is 16 for actions at the Battle of Inkerman, on 5 November 1854; in a single action, 28 were awarded as a result of the Second Relief of Lucknow, 14–22 November 1857). Four Distinguished Conduct Medals were also awarded.

This high number of awards for bravery has been interpreted as a reaction to the earlier defeat at the Battle of Isandlwana – the extolling of the victory at Rorke&#x27;s Drift drawing the public&#x27;s attention away from the great defeat at Isandlwana and the fact that Lord Chelmsford and Henry Bartle Frere had instigated the war without the approval of Her Majesty&#x27;s Government.

Sir Garnet Wolseley, taking over as commander-in-chief from Lord Chelmsford later that year, was unimpressed with the awards made to the defenders of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, saying &quot;it is monstrous making heroes of those who, shut up in buildings at Rorke&#x27;s Drift, could not bolt and fought like rats for their lives, which they could not otherwise save&quot;.

Several historians have challenged this assertion and pointed out that the victory stands on its own merits, regardless of other concerns. Victor Davis Hanson responded to it directly in &quot;Carnage and Culture&quot; (also published as &quot;Why the West Has Won&quot;), saying, &quot;Modern critics suggest such lavishness in commendation was designed to assuage the disaster at Isandhlwana and to reassure a skeptical Victorian public that the fighting ability of the British soldier remained unquestioned. Maybe, maybe not, but in the long annals of military history, it is difficult to find anything quite like Rorke&#x27;s Drift, where a beleaguered force, outnumbered 40 to one, survived and killed 20 men for every defender lost&quot;.

In 1879, there was no provision for the posthumous granting of the Victoria Cross, and so it could not be awarded to anyone who had died in performing an act of bravery. Private Joseph Williams, B Coy, 2nd/24th Foot, was killed during the fight in the hospital and was mentioned in despatches that &quot;had he lived he would have been recommended for the Victoria Cross.&quot;

On 15 January 1880, a submission for a DCM was also made for Private Michael McMahon (Army Hospital Corps). The submission was cancelled on 29 January 1880 for absence without leave and theft.

== Memorial ==
A memorial was erected on the site shortly after relief. A cemetery was also established where the bodies of the dead were buried.

The battlefield, Rorke&#x27;s Drift Battlefield, Dundee Area, KwaZulu Natal, is a tourist attraction with set hours and guides. It is located off gravel-surfaced R68 from Dundee to Nqutu and the gravel-surfaced R33 from Dundee to Pomeroy. The site is located northeast of Ladysmith and south of Nqutu, Umzinyathi District Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal.

== Depictions and dramatisations ==
The events surrounding the assault on Rorke&#x27;s Drift were first dramatised by military painters, notably Elizabeth Butler (in &quot;The Defence of Rorke&#x27;s Drift&quot; (1880)) and Alphonse de Neuville (also titled &quot;The Defence of Rorke&#x27;s Drift&quot; (1880)). Their work was vastly popular in their day among the citizens of the British empire.

H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s true account, &quot;The Tale of Isandhlwana and Rorke&#x27;s Drift&quot;, published in Andrew Lang&#x27;s &quot;True Story Book&quot; (1894), names many important figures but omits Surgeon Reynolds, who played a crucial role in the defence.

In 1914, a touring English Northern Union rugby league team defeated Australia 14–6 to win the Ashes in the final test match. Depleted by injuries and fielding only ten men for much of the second half, the English outclassed and outfought the Australians in what quickly became known as the &quot;Rorke&#x27;s Drift Test&quot;.

The Edison Company made a two-reel silent film titled &quot;Rorke&#x27;s Drift&quot; (1914) starring Richard Tucker.

The film &quot;Zulu&quot; (1964), produced by Stanley Baker, portrays the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift. The film received generally positive reviews from the critics. Some details of the film&#x27;s account are, however, historically inaccurate (for example, in the movie the regiment is called the South Wales Borderers, but the unit was not in fact called that until two years after the battle, although the regiment had been based at Brecon in South Wales since 1873). While most of the men of the 1st Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot (1/24) were recruited from the industrial towns and agricultural classes of England, principally from Birmingham and adjacent southwest counties, only 10 soldiers of the 1/24 that fought in the battle were Welsh. Many of the soldiers of the junior battalion, the 2/24, were Welshmen. Of the 122 soldiers of the 24th Regiment present at the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, 49 are known to have been of English nationality, 32 were Welsh, 16 were Irish, one was a Scot, and three were born overseas. The nationalities of the remaining 21 are unknown.

Swedish power metal band Sabaton wrote the song &quot;Rorke&#x27;s Drift&quot; about the battle for their 2016 album &quot;The Last Stand&quot;.

Northern Rhodesian singer and songwriter John Edmond wrote a song about the battle for his album &quot;Songs of the African Battlefields&quot;.

The solitaire tabletop war-game &quot;Zulus on the Ramparts!: The Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, 22–23 January 1879&quot; is based on the event.

<text>In Greek mythology, Pheres (, &quot;Phéres&quot;, &quot;Féris&quot;; ) was the founder of Pherae in Thessaly.

== Family ==
Pheres was the son of Cretheus, King of Iolcus and Tyro. He was the brother of Aeson and Amythaon. He fled from Iolcus after his half-brother, Pelias, seized the throne. Pheres married Periclymene, daughter of Minyas, and became the father of Admetus, Lycurgus, Eidomene (wife of Amythaon), Periopis (possible mother of Patroclus) and Antigona (mother of Asterius). Of them, Admetus was the husband of the famous Alcestis, who died in his stead and was rescued by Heracles, while Pheres, despite his old age, would not do the same for his son.

== Mythology ==
In Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Eumenides&quot; Pheres is mentioned by the Chorus of Erinyes of Clytemnestra. The Erinyes were the avengers for the mother-blood Orestes spilled by ordering of Apollo. The Chorus leader argues with Apollo over the just sentence Athena and her panel of judges are about to speak.
