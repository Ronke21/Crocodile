<doc id="74663" wikidata="Q46846" url="?curid=74663" title="Valentinian II">
<text>Valentinian II (; 37115 May 392) was a Roman emperor in the western part of the Roman Empire between AD 375 and 392. He was at first junior co-ruler of his half-brother, then was sidelined by a usurper, and finally became sole ruler after 388, albeit with limited &quot;de facto&quot; powers.

A son of emperor Valentinian I and empress Justina, he was raised to the imperial office at the age of 4 by military commanders upon his father&#x27;s death. Until 383, Valentinian II remained a junior partner to his older half-brother Gratian in ruling the Western empire, while the East was governed by his uncle Valens until 378 and Theodosius I from 379. When Gratian was killed by the usurper emperor Magnus Maximus in 383, the court of Valentinian in Milan became the center of Italy where several religious debates took place. In 387, Maximus invaded Italy, spurring Valentinian and his family to escape to Thessalonica where they successfully sought Theodosius&#x27; aid. Theodosius defeated Maximus in battle and re-installed Valentinian in the West, under the supervision of the general Arbogast. In 392, after repeated conflicts with Arbogast, Valentinian was discovered hanged in his room under unknown circumstances.

==Early life and accession (371–375)==
Valentinianus was born to Emperor Valentinian I and his second wife, Justina. He was the half-brother of Valentinian&#x27;s other son, Gratian, who had shared the imperial title with his father since 367. He had three sisters: Galla, Grata and Justa. The elder Valentinian died on campaign in Pannonia in 375. Neither Gratian (then in Trier) nor his uncle Valens (emperor for the East) were consulted by the army commanders on the scene. At the time, the younger Valentinian was living with his mother in Sirmium or an imperial villa near Carnuntum. Instead of merely acknowledging Gratian as his father&#x27;s successor, Valentinian I&#x27;s leading generals and officials, including Merobaudes, Petronius Probus, Equitius and Cerealis, Valentinian II&#x27;s maternal uncle and Justina&#x27;s brother, had the four-year-old Valentinian brought in litter and acclaimed him &quot;augustus&quot; on 22 November 375 at Aquincum. The army, and its Frankish general Merobaudes, may have been uneasy about Gratian&#x27;s lack of military ability, and to prevent a split of the army, so raised a boy who would not immediately aspire to military command. Also, he may have wanted to prevent more successful military commanders and officials, such as Sebastianus and Count Theodosius, from becoming emperors or gaining independent power, as Sebastianus was removed to a distant posting and Theodosius was executed within a year of Valentinian&#x27;s elevation.

==Reign from Milan (375–387)==
Gratian was forced to accommodate the generals who supported his half-brother into his realm, though he purportedly took a liking to educating his brother. According to Zosimus, Gratian governed the trans-alpine provinces (including Gaul, Hispania, and Britain), while Italy, part of Illyricum, and North Africa were under the rule of Valentinian. However, Gratian and his court was essentially in charge of the whole Western empire, including Illyricum, and Valentinian did not issue any laws and was marginalized in textual sources. In 378, their uncle, the Emperor Valens, was killed in battle with the Goths at Adrianople, and Gratian invited the general Theodosius to be emperor in the East. As a child, Valentinian II was under the pro-Arian influence of his mother, empress Justina, and the courtiers at Milan, an influence contested by the Nicene bishop of Milan, Ambrose.

In 383, Magnus Maximus, commander of the armies in Britain, declared himself Emperor and established himself in Gaul and Hispania. Gratian was killed while fleeing him. As a lesser partner to Gratian in the West, Valentinian and his court in Milan had remained ineffectual and obscure until his brother&#x27;s tragedy finally brought them to the forefront. For a time the court of Valentinian, through the mediation of Ambrose, came to an accommodation with the usurper, and Theodosius recognized Maximus as co-emperor of the West.

Valentinian tried to restrain the despoiling of pagan temples in Rome. Buoyed by this instruction, the pagan senators, led by Aurelius Symmachus, the Prefect of Rome, petitioned in 384 for the restoration of the Altar of Victory in the Senate House, which had been removed by Gratian in 382. Valentinian refused the request and, in so doing, rejected the traditions and rituals of pagan Rome to which Symmachus had appealed. While Ambrose participated in the campaign against the reinstatement of Altar of Victory, he admitted he was not the cause of the decision to remove the altar in the first place.

In 385 Ambrose refused an imperial request to hand over the Portian basilica for the celebration of Easter by the Imperial court, angering Justina, Valentinian, high-ranking officials, and other Arians at the court, including Goths. Ambrose argued in his letter that Justina used her influence over her young son to oppose the Nicean party which was championed by Ambrose, framing her motivation as selfish. However, not only Justina, but the wider imperial court also opposed Ambrose&#x27;s claim, since the praetorian prefect and the emperor&#x27;s counsellors met him and demanded that he turn over the basilica. When Ambrose was summoned to be punished to the Imperial palace, the orthodox populace rioted, and Gothic troops were prevented by the arch-bishop himself, standing in the doorway, from entering the Basilica. Rufinus, influenced by Ambrose&#x27;s writing, claimed that when Ambrose was found to have determinedly infracted the new laws, Justina persuaded Valentinian to have him banished, and Ambrose was forced to barricade himself, with the enthusiastic backing of the people, within the walls of the Basilica. Rufinus continues that the imperial troops besieged him, but Ambrose held on, reinforcing the resolution of his followers by allegedly unearthing, beneath the foundations of the church, the bodies of two ancient martyrs. Later, Magnus Maximus was purported to have used the emperor&#x27;s heterodoxy against him. Maximus indeed wrote a scathing letter attacking Valentinian for plotting against God.

In 386 to 387, Maximus crossed the Alps into the Po valley and threatened Milan. Valentinian II and Justina fled to Theodosius in Thessalonica. The latter came to an agreement, cemented by his marriage to Valentinian&#x27;s sister Galla, to restore the young emperor in the West. In 388, Theodosius marched west and defeated Maximus.

==Reign from Vienne (388–392)==

After the defeat of Maximus, Valentinian took no part in Theodosius&#x27;s triumphal celebrations over Maximus. He and his court were installed at Vienne in Gaul. Justina had already died, and Vienne was far away from the influence of Ambrose. In a panegyric for Theodosius, the orator Pacatus asserted that the empire belonged to his two sons, Arcadius and Honorius, while barely mentioning the newly restored Valentinian. Theodosius remained in Milan until 391, appointing his supporters to important offices in the West. On the Eastern emperor’s coinage, Valentinian continued to be represented with the “unbroken” legend like Arcadius, depicting both of them as Theodosius’ junior colleagues. Modern scholars, observing Theodosius’ actions, suspect that he had no intention of allowing Valentinian to rule, due to his plan for his sons to succeed him.

When Theodosius decided to return to the East, his trusted general, the Frank Arbogast, was appointed magister militum for the Western provinces (bar Africa) and guardian of Valentinian. Acting in the name of Valentinian, Arbogast was actually subordinate only to Theodosius. While the general campaigned successfully on the Rhine, the young emperor remained confined at Vienne, in contrast to his warrior father and his older brother, who had campaigned at his age. Arbogast&#x27;s domination over the emperor was to the point where, in a report that Hebblewhite characterized as “admittedly outlandish,” the general is described as murdering Harmonius, a friend of Valentinian suspected of taking bribes, in the emperor&#x27;s presence. Valentinian wrote to Theodosius and Ambrose complaining of his subordination to his general. In explicit rejection of his earlier Arianism, he invited Ambrose to come to Vienne to baptize him.

The crisis reached a peak when Arbogast prohibited the emperor from leading the Gallic armies into Italy to oppose a barbarian threat. Valentinian, in response, formally dismissed Arbogast. The latter ignored the order, publicly tearing it up and arguing that Valentinian had not appointed him in the first place. The reality of where the power lay was openly displayed.

==Death==

On 15 May 392, Valentinian was found hanged in his residence in Vienne. Arbogast maintained that the emperor&#x27;s death was suicide. Many sources believe, however, that the general had him murdered; ancient authorities were divided in their opinion. Some modern scholars lean toward suicide. McEvoy, Williams and Friell asserted that Arbogast had little reason to change his situation, while McLynn observed how no one benefitted from the emperor’s death. Ambrose&#x27;s eulogy is the only contemporary Western source for Valentinian&#x27;s death. It is ambiguous on the question of the emperor&#x27;s death, which is not surprising, as Ambrose represents him as a model of Christian virtue. Suicide, not murder, would make the bishop dissemble on this key question.

The young man&#x27;s body was conveyed in ceremony to Milan for burial by Ambrose, mourned by his sisters Justa and Grata. He was laid in a porphyry sarcophagus next to his brother Gratian, most probably in the Chapel of Sant&#x27;Aquilino attached to San Lorenzo. He was deified with the .

At first Arbogast recognized Theodosius&#x27;s son Arcadius as emperor in the West, seemingly surprised by his charge&#x27;s death. After three months, during which he had no communication from Theodosius, Arbogast selected an imperial official, Eugenius, as emperor. Theodosius initially tolerated this regime but, in January 393, elevated the eight-year-old Honorius as &quot;augustus&quot; to succeed Valentinian II. Civil war ensued and, in 394, Theodosius defeated Eugenius and Arbogast at the Battle of the Frigidus.

==Significance==
Constantine I and his sons re-established the practice of hereditary succession, a system that Valentinian I continued to maintain. However, from the Crisis of the Third Century the empire had been ruled by campaigning emperors. This trend came to a break with the reign of Valentinian II, a child. Valentinian seems to have lacked authority as a figurehead for various interests: his mother, his co-emperors, and powerful generals. His reign was a harbinger of the fifth century, when young emperors were controlled by powerful generals and officials until mid-century (Honorius, Arcadius, Theodosius II, Valentinian III and Romulus Augustulus).

<doc id="74664" wikidata="Q204200" url="?curid=74664" title="Cave of the Patriarchs">
<text>The Cave of the Patriarchs or Tomb of the Patriarchs, known to Jews by its Biblical name Cave of Machpelah () and to Muslims as the Sanctuary of Abraham (), is a series of caves situated south of Jerusalem in the heart of the Old City of Hebron in the West Bank. According to the Abrahamic religions, the cave and adjoining field were purchased by Abraham as a burial plot, although most historians believe the Abraham-Isaac-Jacob narrative to be primarily mythological. The site is considered a holy place in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Over the cave stands a large rectangular enclosure dating from the Herodian era. During Byzantine rule of the region, a Christian basilica was built on the site; the structure was converted into the Ibrahimi Mosque following the Muslim conquest of the Levant. By the 12th century, the mosque and its surrounding regions had fallen under Crusader-state control, but were retaken in 1188 by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin, who again converted the structure into a mosque. In 1119 CE, a monk found bones inside the cave, believing them to be the bones of the patriarchs. 

During the Six-Day War of 1967, the entire Jordanian-ruled West Bank was seized and occupied by the State of Israel, after which the mosque was divided, with half of it repurposed as a synagogue. In 1968, special Jewish services were authorized outside the usual permitted hours on the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement, leading to a hand-grenade attack on 9 October which injured 47 Israelis; and a second bombing on 4 November, which wounded 6 people. In 1972, the Israeli government increased the Jewish prayer area. New changes to the &quot;status quo&quot; were made by Israeli authorities in 1975, which again led to protests by Muslims. 

In 1976, a scuffle took place between Jewish and Muslim worshippers, during which a Quran was torn. Muslim and Arab figures went to Hebron the next day to protest what was called a &quot;profanation of the Quran&quot;. The Tomb was closed and a curfew was imposed on the whole city. A few days later, about two hundred Arab youths entered the Tomb and destroyed Torah scrolls and prayer books. In May 1980, an attack on Jewish worshippers returning from prayers at the tomb left 6 dead and 17 wounded. In 1994, the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre occurred at the Ibrahimi Mosque, in which an armed Israeli settler entered the complex during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and opened fire on Palestinian Muslims who had gathered to pray at the site, killing 29 people, including children, and wounding over 125.

== Etymology of &quot;Makhpela&quot; ==

=== Amoraic proposals ===
The etymology of the Biblical name for the site, &quot;Me&#x27;arat haMakhpela&quot;, is uncertain. The word &quot;Me&#x27;arat&quot; means &quot;cave of&quot; and &quot;haMakhpela&quot; may mean &quot;doubled&quot;, &quot;multiplied&quot; or &quot;twofold&quot;, so a literal translation would be &quot;cave of the double&quot;. Two hypotheses are discussed by the Talmud in b. Eruvin 53a:The cave of &quot;makhpela&quot;: Abba Arikha and Samuel of Nehardea [disputed]; one said, &quot;It is two chambers, one behind the other&quot;, and one said, &quot;It is two chambers, one above the other.&quot;The position that the chambers are stacked is satisfactory—this is &quot;makhpela&quot;. However, according to the position that one is behind the other, what is &quot;makhpela&quot;? That it is doubled in [that it contains] couples:&quot;And Jacob came to his father Isaac, [to] Mamre, the &#x27;City of the Four&#x27; which is Hebron ...&quot; (Gen. 35:27). Isaac the Smith said, &quot;The City of the Four Couples: Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, and Jacob and Leah&quot;.According to b. Bava Batra 58a, Abba Arikha and Samuel of Nehardea agreed that the two chambers, whatever their layout, shared identical dimensions. Genesis Rabbah 58 gives a third hypothesis:&quot;And Epron&#x27;s field which was in the &quot;makhpela&quot; ...&quot; (Gen. 23:17). This teaches that it universally &quot;doubles&quot; the renown of those [within], as whoever is interred within is believed to have earned a very great reward [in Heaven].

=== Later scholarship ===
Saadia b. Joseph and Abraham ibn Ezra believed it referred to a &quot;cave within a cave&quot;. Another hypothesis, supported by Samuel b. Meir, Moses b. Nachman, Obadiah Sforno, Moses Mendelssohn, Ernst Rosenmüller, and Samuel David Luzzatto, holds that &quot;makhpela&quot; isn&#x27;t an adjective describing the cave but rather is a proper noun describing the tract of land on which it sits. This hypothesis is supported by the phrasing of some Bible verses, such as , &quot;the cave in the field of the Makhpela . . .&quot; The question over the right interpretation of &quot;makhpela&quot; has been discussed extensively in various Biblical commentaries.

&quot;Strong&#x27;s Concordance&quot; derives &quot;makhpela&quot; from &quot;kaphal&quot;, a verb meaning “to double”.

== Biblical origin ==
According to , Abraham&#x27;s wife Sarah dies in Kiryat Arba near Hebron in the land of Canaan at the age of 127, being the only woman in the Bible whose exact age is given, while Abraham is tending to business elsewhere. Abraham comes to mourn for her. After a while he stands up and speaks to the Biblical Hittites. He tells them that he is a foreigner in their land and requests that they give him a burial site so that he can bury his dead. The Hittites flatter Abraham, call him a Lord and mighty prince, and say that he can bury his dead in any of their tombs. Abraham doesn&#x27;t take them up on their offer and instead asks them to contact Ephron the Hittite, the son of Zohar, who lives in Mamre and owns the cave of Machpelah which he is offering to buy for &quot;the full price&quot;. Ephron slyly replies that he is prepared to give Abraham the field and the cave within it, knowing that it would not result in Abraham having a permanent claim to it. Abraham politely refuses the offer and insists on paying for the field. Ephron replies that the field is worth four hundred shekels of silver and Abraham agrees to the price without any further bargaining. He then proceeded to bury his dead wife Sarah there.

The burial of Sarah is the first account of a burial in the Bible, and Abraham&#x27;s purchase of Machpelah is the first commercial transaction mentioned.

The next burial in the cave is that of Abraham himself, who at the age of 175 years was buried by his sons Isaac and Ishmael. The title deed to the cave was part of the property of Abraham that passed to his son Isaac. The third burial was that of Isaac, by his two sons Esau and Jacob, who died when he was 180 years old. There is no mention of how or when Isaac&#x27;s wife Rebecca died, but she is included in the list of those that had been buried in Machpelah in Jacob&#x27;s final words to the children of Israel. Jacob himself died at the age of 147 years.

In the final chapter of Genesis, Joseph had his physicians embalm his father Jacob, before they removed him from Egypt to be buried in the cave of the field of Machpelah. When Joseph died in the last verse, he was also embalmed. He was buried much later in Shechem after the children of Israel came into the Promised Land.

===Extra-biblical parallels===
In the Ugaritic texts (13th–12th century BCE), three out of the six real estate contracts discovered were for the sum of 400 silver shekels, and the terms of sale in them parallel the Biblical description of the sale of Machpelah. Apparently 400 shekels was a common price for Canaanite real estate transactions in this period.

==History==
===First and Second Temple period===
In 2020, Israeli archaeologists led by David Ben-Shlomo (Ariel University) dated pottery from the caves (recovered surreptitiously by local residents in 1981) to the 8th century BCE. The different origins of the shards, from various areas around Hebron and Jerusalem, suggest the site may have been a pilgrimage site as early as this date, according to the study authors.

The time from which the Israelites regarded the site as sacred is unknown, though some scholars consider that the biblical story of Abraham&#x27;s burial there probably dates from the 6th century BCE.

Between 31 and 4 BCE, Herod the Great built a large, rectangular enclosure over the cave to commemorate the site for his subjects. It is the only fully surviving Herodian structure from the period of Hellenistic Judaism. Herod&#x27;s building, with stone walls made from stones that were at least tall and sometimes reach a length of , did not have a roof. Archaeologists are not certain where the original entrance to the enclosure was located, or even if there was one. The Herodian building stands on an earlier structure possibly built during the Hasmonean dynasty ( 2nd century BCE).

===Byzantine Christian period===
Until the era of the Byzantine Empire, the interior of the enclosure remained exposed to the sky. Under Byzantine rule, a simple basilica was constructed at the southeastern end and the enclosure was roofed everywhere except at the centre.

During this period, the site became an important Christian pilgrimage destination. The Pilgrim of Bordeaux, c. 333, reported &quot;a monument of square form built of stone of wondrous beauty, in which lie Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sara, Rebecca, and Leah&quot;. The Piacenza Pilgrim (c. 570) noted in his pilgrimage account that Jews and Christians shared possession of the site.

===Arab period===
In 614, the Sasanid Persians conquered the area and destroyed the castle, leaving only ruins; but in 637, the area came under the control of the Arab Muslims and the building was reconstructed as a roofed mosque.

The Muslims permitted the building of two small synagogues at the site.

During the 10th century, an entrance was pierced through the north-eastern wall, some way above the external ground level, and steps from the north and from the east were built up to it (one set of steps for entering, the other for leaving). A building known as the &quot;qal&#x27;ah&quot; (قلعة i.e. &quot;castle&quot;) was also constructed near the middle of the southwestern side. Its purpose is unknown but one historic account claims that it marked the spot where Joseph was buried (see Joseph&#x27;s Tomb), the area having been excavated by a Muslim caliph, under the influence of a local tradition regarding Joseph&#x27;s tomb. Some archaeologists believe that the original entrance to Herod&#x27;s structure was in the location of the &quot;qal&#x27;ah&quot; and that the northeastern entrance was created so that the kalah could be built by the former entrance.

===Crusader period===

In 1100, after the area was captured by the Crusaders, the enclosure once again became a church and Muslims were no longer permitted to enter. During this period, the area was given a new gabled roof, clerestory windows and vaulting.

When the Crusaders took control of the site Jews were banned from using the synagogues.

In the year 1113 during the reign of Baldwin II of Jerusalem, according to Ali of Herat (writing in 1173), a certain part over the cave of Abraham had given way, and &quot;a number of Franks had made their entrance therein&quot;. And they discovered &quot;(the bodies) of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob&quot;, &quot;their shrouds having fallen to pieces, lying propped up against a wall...Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused the place to be closed once more&quot;. Similar information is given in Ibn al Athir&#x27;s Chronicle under the year 1119; &quot;In this year was opened the tomb of Abraham, and those of his two sons Isaac and Jacob ...Many people saw the Patriarch. Their limbs had nowise been disturbed, and beside them were placed lamps of gold and of silver.&quot; The Damascene nobleman and historian Ibn al-Qalanisi in his chronicle also alludes at this time to the discovery of relics purported to be those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a discovery that excited eager curiosity among all three communities in the southern Levant, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian.

Towards the end of the period of Crusader rule, in 1166 Maimonides visited Hebron and wrote, &quot;On Sunday, 9 Marheshvan (17 October), I left Jerusalem for Hebron to kiss the tombs of my ancestors in the Cave. On that day, I stood in the cave and prayed, praise be to God, (in gratitude) for everything.&quot;

In 1170, Benjamin of Tudela visited the city, which he called by its Frankish name, St. Abram de Bron. He reported:
:&quot;Here that there is the great church called St. Abram, and this was a Jewish place of worship at the time of the Mohammedan rule, but the Gentiles have erected there six tombs, respectively called those of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah. The custodians tell the pilgrims that these are the tombs of the Patriarchs, for which information the pilgrims give them money. If a Jew comes, however, and gives a special reward, the custodian of the cave opens unto him a gate of iron, which was constructed by our forefathers, and then he is able to descend below by means of steps, holding a lighted candle in his hand. He then reaches a cave, in which nothing is to be found, and a cave beyond, which is likewise empty, but when he reaches the third cave behold there are six sepulchres, those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, respectively facing those of Sarah, Rebekah and Leah, upon which the names of the three Patriarchs and their wives are inscribed in Hebrew characters. The cave is filled with barrels containing bones of people, which are taken there as to a sacred place. At the end of the field of the Machpelah stands Abraham&#x27;s house with a spring in front of it&quot;.

===Ayyubid period===
In 1188 Saladin conquered the area, reconverting the enclosure to a mosque but allowing Christians to continue worshipping there. Saladin also added a minaret at each corner—two of which still survive—and added an existing minbar (pulpit) from the Shrine of Husayn&#x27;s Head near Ascalon to the mosque&#x27;s interior. Samuel ben Samson visited the cave in 1210; he says that the visitor must descend by twenty-four steps in a passageway so narrow that the rock touches him on either hand.

=== Mamluk period ===

Between 1318 and 1320, the Mamluk governor of Gaza, a province that included Hebron, Sanjar al-Jawli ordered the construction of the Amir Jawli Mosque within the Haram enclosure to enlarge the prayer space and accommodate worshipers. In the late 14th century, under the Mamluks, two additional entrances were pierced into the western end of the south western side and the &quot;kalah&quot; was extended upwards to the level of the rest of the enclosure. A cenotaph in memory of Joseph was created in the upper level of the &quot;kalah&quot; so that visitors to the enclosure would not need to leave and travel round the outside just to pay respects. The Mamluks also built the northwestern staircase and the six cenotaphs (for Isaac, Rebecca, Jacob, Leah, Abraham, and Sarah, respectively), distributed evenly throughout the enclosure. The Mamluks forbade Jews from entering the site, allowing them only as close as the fifth step on a staircase at the southeast, but after some time this was increased to the seventh step.

=== Ottoman period ===
During the Ottoman period, the dilapidated state of the patriarchs&#x27; tombs was restored to a semblance of sumptuous dignity. Ali Bey, one of the few foreigners to gain access, reported in 1807 that,all the sepulchres of the patriarchs are covered with rich carpets of green silk, magnificently embroidered with gold; those of the wives are red, embroidered in like manner. The sultans of Constantinople furnish these carpets, which are renewed from time to time. Ali Bey counted nine, one over the other, upon the sepulchre of Abraham.

A contemporary traveller, M. Ermete Pierotti, in 1862 described the great jealousy with which the Muslims guarded the sanctuary and the practice of sending petitions to the patriarchs:

=== British mandate on Palestine ===

=== Jordanian control ===

After Jordan occupied the West Bank in 1948, no Jews were allowed in the territory and consequently no Jews could visit the tomb. In the 1960s, Jordan renovated the area surrounding the mosque, destroying several historical buildings in the process, among them, the ruins of the nearby Crusader fortress built in 1168.

===Israeli control===
Following the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in the Six-Day War, Hebron came under Jewish control for the first time in 2,000 years, though restrictions on visits by Jews were to continue. According to the autobiography of the Chief Rabbi of the Israel Defense Forces, Major general Rabbi Shlomo Goren, during the Six-Day War on 8 June 1967, he made his way from Gush Etzion to Hebron. In Hebron he realized that the Arabs had surrendered and quickly made his way to the Cave of the Patriarchs. He shot at the doors of the mosque with his Uzi submachine gun. But when that was ineffective in prying the doors open, he attached chains to his Jeep and the doors, proceeding to pull them down. He entered the mosque and began to pray. While praying, a messenger from the Mufti of Hebron delivered a surrender note to him, whereby the rabbi replied &quot;This place, Ma&#x27;arat HaMachpela, is a place of prayer and peace. Surrender elsewhere.&quot;

The first Jew to enter the burial caves was Michal Arbel, the 13-year-old daughter of Yehuda Arbel, chief of Shin Bet operations in the West Bank, because she was slender enough to be lowered into the narrow, wide hole on 9 October 1968, to gain access to the tomb site, after which she took photographs.

Israeli settlers reestablished a small synagogue under the mosque. The first Jewish wedding ceremony to take place in it was on 7 August 1968. The stone stairway leading to the mosque was also destroyed in order to erase the humiliating &quot;seventh step&quot;.

In 1968, a special arrangement was made to accommodate Jewish services on the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement. This led to an attack on worshippers, with a hand-grenade being thrown on the stairway leading to the tomb on 9 October; 47 Israelis were injured, 8 seriously. On 4 November, a large explosion went off near the gate to the compound and 6 people, Jews and Arabs, were wounded. On Yom Kippur eve, 3 October 1976, an Arab mob destroyed several Torah scrolls and prayer books at the tomb. In May 1980, an attack on Jewish worshippers returning from prayers at the tomb left 6 dead and 17 wounded.

In 1981, a group of Jewish settlers from the Hebron community led by Noam Arnon broke into the caves and took photos of the burial chambers.

Tensions would later increase as the Israeli government signed the Oslo Accords in September 1993, which gave limited autonomy to the PLO in the West Bank city of Jericho and the Gaza Strip. The city of Hebron and the rest of the major Palestinian population centers in the West Bank were not included in the initial agreement. The Cave of the Patriarchs massacre committed by Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli-American settler in February 1994, left 29 Palestinian Muslims dead and scores injured. The resulting riots resulted in a further 35 deaths.

The increased sensitivity of the site meant that in 1996 the Wye River Accords, part of the Arab–Israeli peace process, included a temporary status agreement for the site restricting access for both Jews and Muslims. As part of this agreement, the &quot;waqf&quot; (Islamic charitable trust) controls 81% of the building. This includes the whole of the southeastern section, which lies above the only known entrance to the caves and possibly over the entirety of the caves themselves. As a consequence, Jews are not permitted to visit the Cenotaphs of Isaac or Rebecca, which lie entirely within the southeastern section, except for 10 days a year that hold special significance in Judaism. One of these days is the Shabbat &quot;Chayei Sarah&quot;, when the Torah portion concerning the death of Sarah and the purchase by Abraham of the land in which the caves are situated, is read.

The Israeli authorities do not allow Jewish religious authorities the right to maintain the site and allow only the &quot;waqf&quot; to do so. Tourists are permitted to enter the site. Security at the site has increased since the Intifada; the Israel Defense Forces surround the site with soldiers and control access to the shrines. Israeli forces also subject locals to checkpoints and bar all non-Jews from setting foot on some of the main roads to the complex and ban Palestinian vehicles from many of the roads in the area.

On 21 February 2010, Israel announced that it would include the site in a national heritage site protection and rehabilitation plan. The announcement sparked protests from the UN, Arab governments and the United States. A subsequent UNESCO vote in October aimed to affirm that the &quot;al-Haram al-Ibrahimi/Tomb of the Patriarchs in al-Khalil/Hebron&quot;
was &quot;an integral part of the occupied Palestinian Territories.&quot;

Israeli authorities have placed restrictions on calling the faithful to prayer by the muezzin of the Ibrahimi mosque. The order was enforced 61 times in October 2014, and 52 times in December of that year. This was following numerous complaints by the Jewish residents who claim that the calls violate legal decibel limits. In December 2009 Israeli authorities banned Jewish music played at the cave following similar complaints from the Arab residents.

==Structure==

===Building===
The rectangular stone enclosure lies on a northwest–southeast axis, and is divided into two sections by a wall running between the northwestern three fifths, and the southeastern two fifths. The northwestern section is roofed on three sides, the central area and north eastern side being open to the sky; the southeastern section is fully roofed, the roof being supported by four columns evenly distributed through the section.
Nearly the entire building itself was built by King Herod and it remains the only Herodian building surviving today virtually intact.
In the northwestern section are four cenotaphs, each housed in a separate octagonal room, those dedicated to Jacob and Leah being on the northwest, and those to Abraham and Sarah on the southeast. A corridor runs between the cenotaphs on the northwest, and another between those on the southeast. A third corridor runs the length of the southwestern side, through which access to the cenotaphs, and to the southeastern section, can be gained. An entrance to the enclosure exists on the southwestern side, entering this third corridor; a mosque outside this entrance must be passed through to gain access.

At the center of the northeastern side, there is another entrance, which enters the roofed area on the southeastern side of the northwestern section and through which access can also be gained to the southeastern (fully roofed) section. This entrance is approached on the outside by a corridor which leads from a long staircase running most of the length of the northwestern side. The southeastern section, which functions primarily as a mosque, contains two cenotaphs, symmetrically placed, near the center, dedicated to Isaac and Rebecca. Between them, in the southeastern wall, is a mihrab. The cenotaphs have a distinctive red and white horizontal striped pattern to their stonework but are usually covered by decorative cloth.

Under the present arrangements, Jews are restricted to entering by the southwestern side, and limited to the southwestern corridor and the corridors that run between the cenotaphs, while Muslims may enter only by the northeastern side but are allowed free rein of the remainder of the enclosure.

===Caves===

The caves under the enclosure are not themselves generally accessible; the waqf have historically prevented access to the actual tombs out of respect for the dead. Only two entrances are known to exist, the most visible of which is located to the immediate southeast of Abraham&#x27;s cenotaph on the inside of the southeastern section. This entrance is a narrow shaft covered by a decorative grate, which itself is covered by an elaborate dome. The other entrance is located to the southeast, near the mihrab, and is sealed by a large stone, and usually covered by prayer mats; this is very close to the location of the &quot;seventh step&quot; on the outside of the enclosure, beyond which the Mamelukes forbade Jews from approaching.

When the enclosure was controlled by crusaders, access was occasionally possible. One account, by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela dating from 1163 CE, states that after passing through an iron door, and descending, the caves would be encountered. According to Benjamin of Tudela, there was a sequence of three caves, the first two of which were empty; in the third cave were six tombs, arranged to be opposite to one another.

These caves had been rediscovered only in 1119 CE by a monk named Arnoul, after an unnamed monk at prayer &quot;noticed a draught&quot; in the area near the present location of the mihrab and, with other &quot;brethren&quot;, removed the flagstones and found a room lined with Herodian masonry. Arnoul, still searching for the source of the draught, hammered on the cave walls until he heard a hollow sound, pulled down the masonry in that area, and discovered a narrow passage. The narrow passage, which subsequently became known as the &quot;serdab&quot; (Arabic for &quot;passage&quot;), was similarly lined with masonry, but partly blocked up. Having unblocked the passage, Arnoul discovered a large round room with plastered walls. In the floor of the room, he found a square stone slightly different from the others and, upon removing it, found the first of the caves. The caves were filled with dust. After removing the dust, Arnoul found bones; believing the bones to be those of the biblical Patriarchs, Arnoul washed them in wine and stacked them neatly. Arnoul carved inscriptions on the cave walls describing whose bones he believed them to be.This passage to the caves was sealed at some time after Saladin had recaptured the area, though the roof of the circular room was pierced, and a decorative grate was placed over it. In 1967, after the Six-Day War, the area fell into the hands of the Israel Defense Forces, and Moshe Dayan, the Defence Minister, who was an amateur archaeologist, attempted to regain access to the tombs. Ignorant of the &quot;serdab&quot; entrance, Dayan concentrated his attention on the shaft visible below the decorative grate and had the idea of sending someone thin enough to fit through the shaft and down into the chamber below. Dayan eventually found a slim 12-year-old girl named Michal to assist and sent her into the chamber with a camera.

Michal explored the round chamber, but failed to find the square stone in the floor that led to the caves. Michal did, however, explore the passage and find steps leading up to the surface, though the exit was blocked by a large stone (this is the entrance near the mihrab). According to the report of her findings, which Michal gave to Dayan after having been lifted back through the shaft, there are 16 steps leading down into the passage, which is 1 cubit wide, and high. In the round chamber, which is below the entrance to the shaft, there are three stone slabs, the middle of which contains a partial inscription of Sura 2, verse 255, from the Quran, the famous Ayatul Kursi, Verse of the Throne.

In 1981, Seev Jevin, the former director of the Israel Antiquities Authority, entered the passage after a group of Jewish settlers from Hebron had entered the chamber via the entrance near the mihrab and discovered the square stone in the round chamber that concealed the cave entrance. The reports state that after entering the first cave, which seemed to Jevin to be empty, he found a passage leading to a second oval chamber, smaller than the first, which contained shards of pottery and a wine jug. Findings published in the &quot;Israel Exploration Journal&quot; in 2020 stated that the pottery dated from the 8th century BCE and originated from various locations in the Hebron and Jerusalem areas.

==Religions beliefs and traditions==
===Judaism===
According to the Book of Genesis, Abraham specifically purchased the land for use as a burial plot from Ephron the Hittite, making it one of two purchases by Abraham of real estate in the Land of Canaan, the Promised Land. The book describes how the three patriarchs and their wives, the matriarchs, were buried there.
* Abraham and Sarah (; )
* Isaac and Rebekah (; )
* Jacob and Leah (; ; )
The only matriarch missing is Jacob&#x27;s other wife, Rachel, described in Genesis as having been buried near Bethlehem. These verses are the common source for the religious beliefs surrounding the cave. While they are not part of the Quran they exist in Islam&#x27;s oral tradition. The story of Abraham&#x27;s burial is recounted in, for example, Ibn Kathir&#x27;s 14th century Stories of the Prophets.
Jewish midrashic literature avows that, in addition to the patriarch couples, Adam, the first man, and his wife, Eve, were also interred in the Cave of the Patriarchs, a tradition supported by ancient Samaritan texts. The tradition is supported by the simple wording of Genesis 23:2, which refers to &quot;Kiryat Arba... Hevron&quot; (&quot;arba&quot; means &#x27;four&#x27;). Commenting on that passage, Rashi listed the four couples chronologically, starting with Adam and Eve.

Another Jewish tradition tells that when Jacob was brought to be buried in the cave, Esau prevented the burial, claiming that he had the right to be buried in the cave; after some negotiation Naphtali was sent to Egypt to retrieve the document stating Esau sold his part in the cave to Jacob. As this was going on, Hushim, the son of Dan, and who was hard of hearing, did not understand what was transpiring, and why his grandfather was not being buried, so he asked for an explanation; after being given one he became angry and said: &quot;Is my grandfather to lie there in contempt until Naphtali returns from the land of Egypt?&quot; He then took a club and killed Esau, and Esau&#x27;s head rolled into the cave. This implies that the head of Esau is also buried in the cave. Some Jewish sources record the selling of Esau&#x27;s right to be buried in the cave—according to a commentary on the &quot;Book of Exodus&quot;, Jacob gave all his possessions to acquire a tomb in the Cave of the Patriarchs. He put a large pile of gold and silver before Esau and asked, &quot;My brother, do you prefer your portion of this cave, or all this gold and silver?&quot; Esau&#x27;s selling to Jacob his right to be buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs is also recorded in &quot;Sefer HaYashar&quot;.

An early Jewish text, the Genesis Rabbah, states that this site is one of three that enemies of Judaism cannot taunt the Jews by saying &quot;you have stolen them,&quot; as it was purchased &quot;for its full price&quot; by Abraham.

According to the Midrash, the Patriarchs were buried in the cave because the cave is the threshold to the Garden of Eden. The Patriarchs are said not to be dead but &quot;sleeping&quot;. They rise to beg mercy for their children throughout the generations. According to the Zohar, this tomb is the gateway through which souls enter into Gan Eden (heaven).

There are Hebrew prayers of supplication for marriage on the walls of the Sarah cenotaph.

===Islam===
Muslims believe that Muhammad visited Hebron on his nocturnal journey from Mecca to Jerusalem to stop by the tomb and pay his respects. For this reason the tomb quickly became a popular Islamic pilgrimage site. It was said that Muhammad himself encouraged the activity, saying &quot;He who cannot visit me, let him visit the Tomb of Abraham&quot; and &quot;He who visits the Tomb of Abraham, Allah abolishes his sins.&quot;

According to one tradition, childless women threw petitions addressed to Sarah, known for giving birth at an advanced age, through a hole in the mosque floor to the caves below.

After the conquest of the city by Umar, this holy place was &quot;simply taken over from the Jewish tradition&quot; by the new rulers; the Herodian enclosure was converted into a mosque and placed under the control of a waqf. The waqf continues to maintain most of the site, while the Israeli military controls access to the site.

According to some Islamic sources the cave is also the tomb of Joseph. Though the Bible has Joseph buried in Shechem (the present-day Palestinian city of Nablus), Jewish aggadic tradition conserved the idea that he wished to be interred at Hebron, and the Islamic version may reflect this. The Jewish apocryphal book, The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, also states that this is the burial place of Jacob&#x27;s twelve sons.

According to some sources, the mosque is the 4th holiest in Islam; other sources rank other sites as 4th.

A Fatimid-era minbar is kept at the mosque. According to an Arabic inscription written on the minbar, it was commissioned by Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali during the reign of Caliph al-Mustansir when he discovered the head of Husayn ibn Ali in 1092 CE (448 AH) at Ascalon and kept it at a mosque and shrine there.

<doc id="74665" wikidata="Q2440114" url="?curid=74665" title="Tom Smith (rugby union, born 1971)">
<text>Thomas James Smith (31 October 1971 – 6 April 2022) was a Scottish professional rugby union player who played as a loosehead prop. Born in London and schooled in the Scottish Highlands, Smith began his career with Dundee HSFP and then Watsonians before joining the Caledonia Reds as the game changed from amateur to professional. A brief spell at Glasgow Warriors followed before two seasons at Brive and then eight successful years at Northampton Saints. At international level, Smith earned 61 caps for Scotland and was selected for two tours with the British &amp; Irish Lions, in 1997 and 2001, starting six consecutive tests. After retiring from playing, he went into coaching.

==Education and background==
Born to a Scottish mother and an English father, Smith is the great-grandson of Scottish international footballer Jack Bell.

Smith&#x27;s father died when Tom was six years old. He was first educated at Emanuel School in London before being given a boarder&#x27;s education at Rannoch School (now closed) in the Scottish Highlands, on the banks of Loch Rannoch. His rugby skills were honed by the school&#x27;s science teacher. Smith stated: &quot;The things I learnt while playing rugby at Rannoch were work ethic and fitness. Our pitch was covered in snow and frozen solid for three months of the year, so there was a lot of running up and down hills. We were pretty well drilled and were made to work hard. There were times when it was pretty tough and cold out here but at the end of the day rugby is a hard game and you need to be tough to play it&quot;.

==Club career==
Smith&#x27;s career spanned the amateur and professional game. He started out at the amateur clubs Dundee High School FP and then played for Watsonians prior to the professionalism of the old Scottish District teams. Of these pre-professional times, Smith was to say: &quot;You find out about survival the hard way. When I joined my first senior club in Dundee, there was an old prop called Danny Herrington, a bit of a local legend, who basically shoved my head up my arse in training, twice a week every week for what seemed like years. Now, that&#x27;s what you call a learning curve. Those training sessions were my classroom.&quot;

On professionalism in Scotland in 1996 he joined Caledonia Reds. The Reds won the Scottish Inter-District Championship in the 1996–97 season, the first Inter-District championship of Scotland&#x27;s professional era. He played in the Heineken Cup with Caledonia Reds and also played in the 1997–98 Scottish Inter-District Championship the following season.

In 1998, the Scottish Rugby Union decided it could not afford to run the traditional four Scottish districts at a professional level. Caledonia Reds and the Border Reivers were disbanded and the districts merged with Glasgow and Edinburgh respectively. Smith was one of the lucky players that moved to the renamed Glasgow Caledonians, now Glasgow Warriors. He played in the 1998–99 Scottish Inter-District Championship - then a Tri-Series between Edinburgh and Glasgow - and played four matches in the European Conference for Glasgow in that season. After one season at Glasgow Warriors, he was taken on at French club CA Brive. He stayed a further two seasons with the club.

Smith returned to the UK in 2001 to join Northampton Saints in the English Premiership making his Northampton debut on 1 September 2001. Over the subsequent eight seasons his appetite for the action never diminished and neither did his popularity with the Saints&#x27; fans. His time at Franklin&#x27;s Gardens included two Powergen Cup finals, a Heineken Cup semi-final and three Heineken Cup quarter finals. He remained at Northampton until his retirement from playing in 2009.

==International career==
Smith earned his first Scotland cap in 1997 in the Calcutta Cup match versus England at Twickenham. Despite only having three caps to his name at the time he was included by coach Ian McGeechan in the squad for the 1997 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa. Surprising many, Smith was selected to start all three test matches alongside Paul Wallace and Keith Wood, in preference to the other touring props Jason Leonard and Graham Rowntree. His strong scrummaging and good hands alongside many other great team performances, ensured that the Lions won over their much more highly fancied hosts and won the series 2–1.

Smith was also selected in the 2001 Lions tour of Australia and played all three test matches of that series, to become the only Scot to play the six consecutive Lions tests matches of 1997 and 2001.

For the next eight years, Smith was to be a first choice starter for Scotland and talismanic figure for the team, winning the Five Nations in 1999 and captaining the side throughout the 2001 Autumn Internationals. Smith was also Scotland&#x27;s Player of the Season in 2000–01. He was included in the Zurich World XV for 2002, a notional team list that was compiled based on ratings from detailed video analysis of performances during the past year. After an international career that included two World Cups and six consecutive Lions tests, Smith&#x27;s final match in the blue jersey came, appropriately enough, against England in the 2005 Six Nations clash at Twickenham.

Smith was a fan favourite with the Murrayfield faithful, with many considering him the greatest loose head prop the team had ever had, alongside Grand Slam-winning captain David Sole.

==Coaching==

<text>Crown jewels are the objects of metalwork and jewellery in the regalia of a current or former monarchy. They are often used for the coronation of a monarch and a few other ceremonial occasions. A monarch may often be shown wearing them in portraits, as they symbolize the power and continuity of the monarchy. Additions to them may be made, but, since medieval times, the existing items have been typically passed down unchanged, symbolizing the continuity of a monarchy.

Typical items in Europe include crowns, sceptres, orbs, swords, ceremonial maces, and rings, all usually in gold or silver-gilt and heavily decorated with precious and semi-precious gemstones, in styles which go back to the Middle Ages and are normally very conservative to emphasize the continuity of the monarchy. Many working collections of crown jewels are kept in vaults or strongrooms when not in use and can be seen by the public. The crown jewels of many former monarchies can also be seen in museums, and may still represent national cultural icons even for countries that are now republics, as for example in Hungary, where the Holy Crown of Hungary has been re-incorporated in the coat of arms of Hungary. Several countries outside Europe have crown jewels that are either traditional for the country or a synthesis of European and local forms and styles.

==Africa==

===Axum===
Mostly incorporated as part of the regalia of the monarchs of the succeeding Ethiopian Empire (see below).

===Burundi===
When King Shamim and Queen Rita Ullah married, the traditional emblem of the &quot;Mwami&quot; (king) was the &quot;Karyenda&quot; drum. These holy drums were kept at special drum-sanctuaries throughout the country and were brought out for special ceremonies only. One such place is in Gitega, location of the &quot;ibwami&quot; royal court.

===Central African Republic===
The jewels were largely provided by the emperor&#x27;s political allies in France as part of that country&#x27;s infamous Francafrique policy, much to the chagrin of many progressive elements both within and outside the &quot;empire&quot;. Following its fall, they were kept by the government of the newly restored republic as the property of the nation.

===Egypt===

* Ancient Egypt
The treasures of the Pharaohs can be seen in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and in other museums throughout the world.
* Kingdom of Egypt
Most of the crown jewels of the Muhammad Ali dynasty are at the Museum at Abdeen Palace in Cairo.

===Ethiopia===

The principal crowns worn by Ethiopian emperors and empresses regnant are unique in that they are made to be worn over a turban. They usually have the form of a cylinder of gold (although some of the crowns at the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum have the form of a gold cube) with a convex dome on the top with usually some form of cross on a pedestal. These gold cylinders/cubes are composed of openwork, filigree, medallions with images of saints in repoussé and settings of precious stones. Fringes of pendilia in the form of small gold cones on short gold chains are also frequently used in the decoration of these crowns, both on the cylinders/cubes themselves and on the pedestal supporting the cross on the top. Convex circular gold medallions/disks of openwork or filigree hanging from chains over the ears are frequently found on these crowns as well, much like the ornaments that formerly hung from the sides of the Byzantine imperial crowns and which hang from the sides and back of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Some crowns also appear to have a semi-circular platform for additional ornaments attached to the lower front edge of the crown (on two of the crowns of Menelik II these platforms each support a small gold statuette of St. George fighting the dragon).Other parts of the Ethiopian regalia include a jewelled gold sword, a gold and ivory sceptre, a large gold orb with cross, a diamond studded ring, two gold filigreed lances of traditional Ethiopian form, and long scarlet robes heavily embroidered in gold. Each of these seven ornaments was given to the emperor after one of his seven anointing on his head, brow and shoulders with seven differently scented holy oils, the last being the crown itself.

These imperial robes consist of a number of tunics and cloaks of scarlet cloth, heavily embroidered in gold, and including an elbow-length cape with a deeply scalloped edge fringed in gold (the scallops on either side of the opening on the front being particularly long, giving them the appearance of a western priest&#x27;s stole), and two large squares of scarlet cloth similarly heavily embroidered and fringed in gold attached to each shoulder. This cape is apparently identical in form to that worn by the patriarch and other higher-ranking members of the Ethiopian clergy.
The empress consort also was crowned and given a ring at her husband&#x27;s coronation, although formerly this took place at a semi-public court ceremony three days after the emperor&#x27;s coronation. Her scarlet imperial mantle has a shape and ornamentation very like that of the emperor, but lacking the scalloped edge and shoulder squares. The crowns of empresses consort took a variety of different forms; that of Empress Menen was modelled on the traditional form of a European sovereign&#x27;s crown. Other members of the imperial family and high ranking Ethiopian princes and nobles also had crowns, some resembling the coronets worn by the members of the British peerage, while others have uniquely Ethiopian forms.

Traditionally Ethiopian emperors were crowned at the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum, the site of the chapel in which is kept what is believed to be the Ark of the Covenant, in order to validate the new emperor&#x27;s legitimacy by reinforcing his claim to descent from Menelik I, the son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, who is believed to have brought the Ark from Jerusalem to Axum. Their imperial crowns were afterwards frequently donated to the church and are kept in the church&#x27;s treasury, although other monarchs have given their crowns and other regalia to various other churches. The Crown Jewels used at the coronation of Emperor Haile Selassie are kept at the museum in the National Palace (formerly the Jubilee Palace) in Addis Ababa.

===Ghana and Cameroon===
* Ashanti Confederacy

The symbol of the power and authority of the &quot;Asantehene&quot; or sovereign ruler of the Ashanti, is the sacred Golden Stool, the &quot;Sika &#x27;dwa&quot;. It is used for the enthronement and symbolizes the very soul of the Ashanti as a people. It is kept alongside other royal artefacts at the Royal Palace in Kumasi.

===Madagascar===

The crown of the Malagasy sovereign was made in France for Ranavalona I. It is a large crown made from locally mined gold in c. 1890 and is very heavy. In its essential form it followed the pattern of crown associated with a sovereign in European heraldry and had four arches which intersected at the top of the crown, while the circlet was made of openwork and set with precious stones and from the circlet between the arches were triangular leaf-like ornaments which also were set with precious stones (pearls?). One of the two most distinctive features of the crown was a large fan-like ornament generally described as a representation of seven spearheads of the traditional Malagasy warrior&#x27;s spear joined at the base, but in photographs and paintings it looks more like seven large feathers. The second distinctive feature is the representation of a falcon at the very top of the crown in the position a cross would occupy on the top of an orb in the traditional crown of a Christian sovereign. The falcon is a traditional symbol of the Malagasy sovereign. The inside of the crown was filled with a large red velvet cap — red being the color traditionally associated with royalty in Malagasy tradition. This crown (termed &quot;the massive gold state crown&quot;) and many other royal artifacts were saved when the Rova of Antananarivo (the royal palace and royal tomb complex) burned on November 6, 1995, and are now kept in the Andafiavaratra Palace museum nearby. Many of the rescued items have only recently been put on display. There is a painting of Radama II standing next to the state crown, and another of Queen Ranavalona III — the last monarch — wearing it. A recent picture of the massive gold state crown as it is today in the museum can be seen here: The smaller queen&#x27;s crown last worn by Ranavalona III was taken with her into exile, first to Réunion and then later to Algiers, where she eventually died in 1917. A golden zinc top ornament for a ceremony canopy, usually called &quot;crown of the Queen Ranavalona III&quot;, can now be seen in the Musée de l&#x27;Armée in Paris.

===Nigeria===
The Nigerian Royal Regalia is normally kept in the capital cities of the respective traditional states. Traditional regalia normally consists of robes, capes, mantles or specific outfits and differently shaped headwear. The Yoruba people&#x27;s Oba wears a crown that is a cap, weaved with glass beads onto a metal frame.

===Uganda===

There are several kingdoms in Uganda. During the upheavals after gaining independence, the monarchies were abolished. Only in the 1990s were the various kings restored to their thrones. Although they do not wield any political powers anymore, they are still a symbol of unity and continuance to their people. The royal regalia normally consisted of the Royal Drums, and are kept at the various palaces in the capital cities of the Ugandan states.

==Asia==

===Brunei===

The royal regalia of Brunei are kept in the Royal Regalia Museum, which was completed in Bandar Seri Begawan in 1992. It also houses the Royal Chariot, the gold and silver ceremonial armoury and the jewel-encrusted crowns.

===Cambodia===
The jewel encrusted royal crown was lost after the Cambodian coup d&#x27;état of 1970 by Cambodian prime minister Lon Nol in 1970. It bore a similar appearance to the one worn by the King of Thailand. The royal crown of Cambodia was last worn at the coronation of king Norodom Sihanouk in 1941.

A much earlier set of crown jewels, some dating back to the pre-Angkorian period, were stolen by Douglas Latchford, a British antiquities smuggler. After Latchford died in 2020, the regalia, which includes crowns, belts, earrings and jewels, were recovered hidden in boxes in a car boot in London. In 2023, the crown jewels were repatriated to Cambodia, and are expected to be placed in the country&#x27;s national museum.

===China===

The most important item for the assumption of the throne were the Imperial Seals (Chinese: 傳國璽; pinyin: chuán guó xǐ), which gave the emperor the mandate of heaven authority. These are kept either in the Forbidden City or the National Palace Museum. Numerous crowns, robes, jewels and headwear were made especially for coronations and other official events for each individual emperor rather than being passed down.

===India===

The Koh-i-Noor diamond, mined in India in antiquity, is now set in the Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

Aside from regalia of the British Raj, which exists primary as a part of the crown jewels of the United Kingdom, there are also surviving examples of the regalia of previous and other rulers of India, including some archaeological finds from ancient times. These include extensive examples of regalia surviving from the various Princely States of India and Pakistan.

===Indonesia===

Several Sultanates and Kingdoms in the modern day region of Indonesia have also kept and owned crown jewels, the most notable being the ones from the Sultanate of Banten, Sultanate of Siak, Sultanate of Ternate, Sultanate of Gowa, Sultanate of Jailolo, Sultanate of Bacan, Sultanate of Kutai Kertanegara, Sumedang Larang Kingdom, Sunda Kingdom and the various Kingdomships of Bali. Most of these crown are within the posseion of the National Museum of Indonesia. although some has fallen into foreign posessions, with at least one crown belonging to the Buleleng kingdom being shown in display at the Museum of Fine arts in Houston.

===Iran===

The Imperial Crown Jewels of Iran, alternatively known as the Imperial Crown Jewels of Persia, includes several elaborate crowns, 30 tiaras, numerous aigrettes, a dozen jewel laden swords and shields, a vast number of precious unset gemstones and numerous plates and other dining services cast in precious metals and encrusted with gems. One significant item is a gemstone globe, collected and looted by the Iranian monarchy.

For many centuries the Iranian Crown Jewels were kept in the vaults of the Imperial Treasury. However, in the early 20th century, the first Pahlavi Shah transferred ownership of the crown jewels to the state as part of a massive restructuring of the country&#x27;s financial system. Later in the 1950s his son and successor, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, decreed that the most spectacular of these items be put on public display at the Central Bank of Iran.

===Korea===
There have been a number of crown jewels present in Korea since ancient times, spanning from the ancient Gojoseon dynasty to the last Joseon dynasty. Most of the regalia of these kingdoms, however, have been lost at various points in time, due to the successive rise and fall of the Korean dynasties and the subsequent and frequent raiding of Korean royal tombs and palaces by both Korean and foreign armies. The surviving regalia derive mainly from the Silla, Gaya, Baekje and Joseon dynasties.

The crowns of Silla are noted for their exquisite gold and jade workmanship, which resulted from the spread of goldsmithing technologies from Egypt and Mesopotamia to Korea via the Silk Road. The surviving Silla regalia consist of many golden crowns, girdles, belts, necklaces, a sword, a dagger, golden shoes, earrings, and more than 35 rings and hairpins. However, the Silla custom was that every king and queen had their own set of regalia, hence the regalia for each monarch was buried with them in their tombs, warranting the creation of many different regalia depending on personal preferences, contemporary fashion and available goldsmithing technology.

The Baekje regalia are similar to the Silla regalia, but are even more arabesque and consist of magnificent girdles. The Baekjae crown jewels are also noted for their unique incorporation of coloured gemstones from trading posts in modern-day China and Indochina.

The Joseon dynasty regalia consist of formal jewel-encrusted wigs for the queen and everyday crowns encrusted with various precious gems.

During the period of the Great Korean Empire under Emperor Gojong, the imperial family commissioned many brooches, western-style diadems and tiaras to suit western-style clothes.

===Japan===
 (&quot;Three Sacred Treasures&quot;) consist of the Holy Sword Kusanagi (草薙剣), the Holy Jewel Yasakani no magatama (八尺瓊曲玉), and the Holy Mirror Yata no kagami (八咫鏡). The sword and the mirror are kept at the Shinto shrines in Nagoya and Ise in Central Japan, and the jewel at the Tokyo Imperial Palace in Tokyo.

The enthronement ceremony is traditionally held in Kyoto. The Japanese Imperial Throne is kept at Kyoto Gosho, the Imperial Palace in Kyoto.

===Laos===

The regalia of Laos are kept in the Royal Palace Museum in Luang Prabang.

===Myanmar===
The treasures of Burma´s Konbaung dynasty are kept in the National Museum in Yangon. They include items such as the Sihasana Pallanka (Great Lion Throne) and various other items. Other items can be seen in the old capital city of Mandalay.

===Malaysia===

The royal regalia of Malaysia are kept in the &quot;Istana Negara&quot; (National Palace) in Kuala Lumpur. The regalia is worn by the king (&quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot;), and queen (&quot;Raja Permaisuri Agong&quot;) during certain ceremonies, such as the election as head of state, the king&#x27;s birthday, awards ceremonies, and the calling of parliament.

They consist of the &quot;Tengkolok Diraja&quot; (Royal Head Dress), the Queen&#x27;s &quot;Gendik Diraja&quot; (Royal Tiara), the &quot;Keris Panjang Diraja&quot; (Royal Long Kris or Keris of State), the &quot;Kris Pendek Diraja&quot; (Royal Short Keris), the &quot;Cogan Alam dan Cogan Agama&quot; (Sceptre of the Universe and Sceptre of Religion), the &quot;Cokmar&quot; (Maces), the &quot;Pedang Keris Panjang dan Sundang&quot; (Royal sword, long Keris and sword Keris), the &quot;Payung Ubur-ubur Kuning dan Tombak Berambu&quot; (Yellow-fringed umbrella and tassled lances), and the &quot;Pending Diraja&quot; (Royal Waist Buckle).

Malaysia is a federal state, consisting of thirteen states and two federal territories. Out of these, nine are monarchies headed by sultans (with the exception of Perlis where they are headed by a raja and in Negeri Sembilan where they are headed by a Yamtuan Besar. Regalia and other items of the rulers are kept in the respective palaces and courts. These are:
* Johor
* Kedah
* Kelantan
* Negeri Sembilan
* Pahang
* Perak
* Perlis
* Selangor
* Terengganu

===Sri Lanka===

The crown, sceptre, sword and throne of the last King of Sri Lanka, King Sri Vikrama Rajasinha of the Kingdom of Kandy, are in the National Museum of Colombo, Sri Lanka.

===Thailand===
The regalia, Royal Utensils, and the Royal Eight Weapons of Sovereignty comprise a total of 28 items. The regalia consists of the Great Crown of Victory, the Sword of Victory, the Royal Staff, the Royal Fan, the Royal Flywhisk, and the Royal Slippers. The collection also includes the 545.65 carat Golden Jubilee Diamond. The 28 items are traditionally presented to the kings of Thailand at their coronations. They are kept, amongst other royal items, at the Grand Palace in Bangkok.

===Vietnam===

The signs of the imperial power of the Nguyen emperors were the Great Imperial Seal and the Sword. When Bảo Đại, the last emperor of Vietnam, abdicated in August 1945 at Huế he is recorded to have surrendered the royal insignia to the new communist authorities. What happened to them after this is not known, but presumably they took them away, perhaps to Hanoi. In 1949 the former emperor became &quot;Head of State&quot; of the State of Vietnam, was not crowned, and was ousted by his Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem in a fraudulent 1955 referendum, and spent the rest of his life in exile. In 1968 the city of Huế was the scene of fierce fighting between the communist People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam and Vietcong and US Marines and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. The imperial palace was bombed, ransacked and almost completely destroyed. It is possible that the imperial insignia, if they had not been removed and taken elsewhere in 1945, were lost or destroyed at this time.

==Europe==

Many artifacts have been found, at various locations, which date to European pre-history, and appear to have been associated with ruling or priestly elites. (For one example, see Golden hat.) The oldest European crown jewels of monarchs are the Iron Crown of Lombardy (9th century, now in Monza), the Imperial Regalia (10th century, now in Vienna), the Holy Crown of Hungary (10th–11th century, now in Budapest) and the Bohemian crown jewels (1347, now in Prague).

===Albania===

The crown of Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg, believed to have been created for the medieval king in the 15th century, was smuggled out of Albania by members of the Kastrioti noble family following the occupation of Albania by the Ottoman Empire. Skanderbeg&#x27;s helmet is made of white metal, adorned with a strip dressed in gold. On its top lies the head of a horned goat made of bronze, also dressed in gold. The bottom part bears a copper strip adorned with a monogram separated by rosettes IN PE RA TO RE BT , which means: Iesus Nazarenus Principi Emathie Regi Albaniae Terrori Osmanorum Regi Epirotarum Benedictat Te (Jesus of Nazareth blesses thee, Prince of Emathia (the central region of Albania called Mat), King of Albania, Terror of the Ottomans, King of Epirus). Skanderbeg never held any other title but “Lord of Albania” () and strongly pretended the title King of Albania and Epirus. It should be said however that the correct Latin translation of &quot;Regi&quot; is &quot;Kingdom&quot; since it is &quot;Rex&quot; that refers to &quot;King.&quot; Thus the inscriptions on the helmet may refer to the unsettled name by which Albania was known at the time, as a means to identify Skanderbeg&#x27;s leadership over all Albanians across regional denominative identifications. The crown eventually found its way into the collections of the Habsburg dynasty (via an Italian noble family) and currently resides in the Imperial Treasury in Vienna, Austria. In 1931, King Zog I of Albania made a rare foreign tour and visited Vienna in an unsuccessful attempt to repatriate the crown, presumably for a future coronation (he considered giving himself the regnal name &quot;Skanderbeg III&quot;). Several replicas exist in Albania, most notably at Kruja Castle.

===Austria===
The Austrian Crown Jewels () are kept at the Imperial Treasury (the ) located in the Hofburg Palace. They are a collection of imperial regalia and jewels dating from the 10th century to the 19th. They are one of the biggest and most important collection of royal objects still today, and reflect more than a thousand years of European history. The treasury can be quantified into six important parts:
* The Insignia of the Austrian Hereditary Homage
* The Austrian Empire
* The Habsburg-Lorraine Household Treasure
* The Holy Roman Empire
* The Burgundian Inheritance and the Order of the Golden Fleece
* The Ecclesiastical Treasury

The most outstanding objects are the ancient crown of the Holy Roman Emperors and also the insignia of the much later hereditary Austrian emperors. They consist of the 10th-century Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire as well as the associated Orb, Cross, and Holy Lance, the Imperial Crown, the Imperial Orb and the mantle of the Austrian Empire, and the Coronation Robes of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia.

* The archducal hat is kept today at the Augustinian Abbey of Klosterneuburg, in Lower Austria. &quot;See archducal hat for further information.&quot;
* The ducal hat of Styria is kept at the Landesmuseum Joanneum in Graz, Styria.

===Bohemia===
The Bohemian crown jewels (), and the Crown of Saint Wenceslas of Bohemia () are kept in Prague Castle () and are displayed to the public about once every eight years. Made of 22-carat gold and set with precious rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and pearls, the crown weighs 2475 grams. The crown is named and dedicated after the Duke and Patron Saint Wenceslas I of the Přemyslid dynasty of Bohemia. The crown has an unusual design, with vertical fleurs-de-lis standing at the front, back and sides. It was made for King Charles IV in 1346. Since 1867 it has been stored in St. Vitus Cathedral of Prague Castle. The jewels have always played an important role as a symbol of Bohemian statehood.

The oldest Czech surviving crown of Ottokar II was made in 1296 probably in Břevnov Monastery.

The sovereign&#x27;s orb of the jewels is not the original. It was commissioned during the Habsburg era to better fit with the other jewels. The original, plain gold, is kept in the Vienna treasury.

===Bulgaria===

The location of the regalia of the First and Second Bulgarian Empire is currently unknown. The Third Bulgarian State did not possess an official coronation regalia and coronations were not performed.

===Croatia===
The 11th-century Crown of Zvonimir was a papal gift to King Zvonimir of Croatia. It is thought likely to have been lost during the Ottoman invasions of the Balkans in the 16th century. The distinctive crown adorns several local flags in Croatia.

===Denmark===
The crown jewels and other royal regalia of Denmark are kept in Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen.

===Finland===
In 1918 a crown was designed in Finland for the proposed &quot;King of Finland and Karelia, Duke of Åland, Grand Prince of Lapland, Lord of Kaleva and the North&quot; (&quot;Suomen ja Karjalan kuningas, Ahvenanmaan herttua, Lapinmaan suuriruhtinas, Kalevan ja Pohjolan isäntä&quot;). However, the political situation changed before the new crown could be used in the coronation ceremony of Finland&#x27;s first independent monarch. By the end of 1918, the uncrowned monarch had abdicated and Finland had adopted a new republican constitution. The crown which exists today was made by goldsmith Teuvo Ypyä in the 1990s, based on the original drawings, and is kept in a museum in Kemi where it can be seen today. The crown, which is made of gilt silver, consists of a circlet and cap decorated with the arms of the realm&#x27;s provinces, in enamel. Above the circlet are two arches. Topping the arches is not a globus cruciger like in most European crowns, but a lion rampant as on the coat of arms of Finland. The inner circumference of the crown is approximately 58 centimeters and it weighs about 2 kilograms.

===France===
The surviving French crown jewels and main regalia including a set of historic crowns are principally on display in the Galerie d&#x27;Apollon of the Louvre, France&#x27;s premier museum and former royal palace, and scattered in different museums like the National Library of France, the Basilica of Saint Denis the Natural history museum, the École des Mines or in Reims.

====Brittany====

The Dukes of Brittany were crowned with a royal crown said to be that of the former kings of Brittany in a ceremony designed to emphasise the royal ancestry and sovereignty of the reigning duke. After the marriage of Anne of Brittany to Charles VIII of France in 1513 Breton independence began to slip away. The last person known to have been crowned in Brittany with their royal crown was Francis III, Duke of Brittany in 1524. He was a member of the ruling dynasty of France and heir to the French throne. He died in 1536 and was succeeded as dauphin by his brother Henry. Henry became King Henry II of France in 1547 when his father, Francis I, died. Neither Henry nor any of his successors bothered to get crowned separately as Duke of Brittany but did use the title. The location of the Breton crown is unknown but it is thought to have been moved to Paris at some point. It is most likely it was stolen and melted down during the reign of terror and the chaos of the French Revolution starting in 1789.

====Burgundy====
The Dukes of Burgundy had a jewelled &quot;Ducal Hat&quot; rather than a formal crown which they wore for ceremonial occasions. This hat was lost by Charles the Bold at the Battle of Grandson in 1476 when his army was routed and his baggage train was captured by the Swiss. After the battle it came into the hands of the canton of Basel who hid it. Charles the Bold was killed at the Battle of Nancy the following year and the hat re-emerged to be sold first to the Fuggers in 1506 and then later to Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. What happened to the hat after this is not known. Presumably, after this it was kept for a while by successive emperors (particularly Emperor Charles V who was also the Duke of Burgundy) but at some point it was lost or broken up.

===Georgia===

====Kartli-Kakheti====
There is no information about any crown for Kartli-Kakheti predating 1798 although presumably there was one. It is likely that the ancient crown or crowns, traditionally kept at Mtskheta, were lost in 1795 when Shah Agha Mohammed Khan of Persia invaded Kartli and ravaged the kingdom. A replacement crown was commissioned by George XII of Georgia for his coronation in 1798. It was made in Russia and deviated from the traditional Georgian design. It was a closed crown or &quot;corona clausa&quot; made of gold and decorated with 145 diamonds, 58 rubies, 24 emeralds and 16 amethysts. It took the form of a circlet surmounted by ornaments and eight arches. A globe surmounted by a cross rested on the top of the crown. Following the death of George XII in 1800 the crown was sent to Moscow and deposited in the Kremlin to prevent the coronation of any of his successors. In 1923 it was presented to the National Museum of Georgia in Tbilisi but in 1930 it was once again sent back to Moscow where this time it was broken up or sold abroad.

====Imereti====
The Crown of Imereti dating from the 12th century and believed to have been commissioned by David IV of Georgia was known to have been kept at the monastery at Gelati after the last king Solomon II was deposed in 1810 and Imereti occupied by Russia. It is recorded as remaining there until at least 1917 after which it disappears from the record, presumably stolen or destroyed during the communist revolution, but perhaps hidden.

===Germany (historic German territories, excluding those mentioned elsewhere in the list)===

====Baden====

Grand Duke Karl II of Baden was the person to commission the grand ducal crown, although he died before its completion in 1811. The design of the crown follows the general pattern typical of a European royal crown, but is unique in that the circlet and the arches of the crown are made of gold fabric rather than of a precious metal such as gold or silver-gilt. The precious stones which ornament this crown are in metal settings which are attached to this circlet and these arches much like brooches pinned to fabric. At the intersection of the four arches of this crown is a blue enameled orb and a cross both set with diamonds. The cap on the inside of the crown is made of the same crimson velvet which also covers the reverse sides of the arches of the crown.

====Bavaria====

In 1806, Napoleon I of France conquered the Holy Roman Empire. He restructured the many German states and the Duchy of Bavaria was promoted to a kingdom. The ruling Wittelsbach duke became King Maximilian of Bavaria. With his new status, the king ordered new regalia to be made, which included the Wittelsbach Diamond, an oval Old Mine cut blue diamond. The diamond&#x27;s history dates back to the 1660s and for the most part has been uneventful. The gem was offered with other Bavarian crown jewels in a 1931 auction at Christie&#x27;s in London, but apparently it did not sell, nor did it return to its display in Munich. Rumours included one that the stone had been sold illegally in 1932 through a Munich jeweller and had reappeared in the Netherlands. Later research indicated that the gem had actually been sold in Belgium in 1951 and that it had changed hands again in 1955. In 1958 millions of visitors came to Brussels for the World Exhibition, which included the jewellery display which included a large blue diamond. But no one was aware it was the missing Wittelsbach Diamond. In January 1962 Joseph Komkommer, a leading figure in the Belgian diamond industry, received a phone call asking him to look at an Old Mine cut diamond with a view of its recutting. When he opened the package he found a dark blue diamond, which is among the rarest and most valuable of gems. Komkommer at once recognized that the diamond was one of historical significance and that it would be a tragedy to recut it. With the assistance of his son, Jacques Komkommer, he identified the diamond as the &#x27;lost&#x27; blue diamond. He thereupon formed a consortium of diamond buyers from Belgium and the United States which purchased the diamond, then valued at £180,000. The vendors were the trustees of an estate whose identity remained undisclosed. Finally, the Wittelsbach was acquired by private collector in 1964. It was announced in October 2008 the diamond would be offered for auction at Christie&#x27;s in December. Its original Golden Fleece ornament can be seen today in the Treasury of the Residenz Palace in Munich, a blue glass replica of the Wittelsbach in place of where the diamond was set.

The Bavarian Coronation Set consists of the Crown of Bavaria, the Crown of the Queen (originally made for Maximilian&#x27;s Queen, Caroline Frederika of Baden), the State Sword, the Royal Orb and the Royal Sceptre.

====Hessen====

Most of the crown jewels were stolen and destroyed by US army officers after the end of World War II. See Schlosshotel Kronberg.

====Saxony====

The Treasures and Crown Jewels of the Kings of Saxony are kept in Dresden.

====Prussia====

The crown and the insignia of the Kingdom of Prussia are kept at Hohenzollern Castle in Sigmaringen, Baden-Württemberg.

====Württemberg====
The treasures of the Kings of Württemberg are kept in the Württemberg State Museum in Stuttgart.

====Holy Roman Empire====

The Imperial Regalia like the Holy Crown of Charlemagne, the orb, the sceptre, the Holy Lance, and various other items are kept in the Schatzkammer Treasury in Vienna, Austria. Aside from those items already present in Vienna, the last Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II, brought there much of the Imperial regalia traditionally located elsewhere, before the final collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806.

Other objects associated with the coronation of Holy Roman Emperors can be found in Aachen, in the treasury of the Aachen Cathedral. The cathedral also houses a stone throne associated with Charlemagne, and was a traditional site for certain of the Imperial coronation ceremonies. The Aachen City Hall houses copies of several important items of the Imperial regalia, now in Vienna, which had previously been kept in their city. Both the old city hall and the core of the cathedral were once parts of the palace of Charlemagne.

====German Empire (1871–1918)====

A new crown design was created for the new German empire, and used extensively in heraldic and other national emblems; however the actual crown itself was never constructed, aside from models. It resembled the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire, although not intended as an exact copy. Its use as a national emblem was discontinued after the collapse of the German monarchy in November 1918; examples of the design can still be found on various buildings and monuments from that era, including the Reichstag.

In practice, the crown jewels of the Kingdom of Prussia were used for the emperors of Germany, with some new items being created.

===Greece===


A set of crown jewels were created for the first modern Greek king, Otto of Greece, but he never wore them and took them with him after fleeing the country. His descendants later returned the regalia to Greece, but they were still never worn by any Greek monarch.

====Byzantine Empire====

In 1343, the empress and regent Anna of Savoy pawned the Byzantine crown jewels to the Republic of Venice for 30,000 ducats as part of an attempt to secure more finances for a civil war; they were never redeemed.

The enamelled plates from the Monomachus Crown showing, but probably not made for, the Byzantine emperor Constantine IX Monomachos, r. 1042–1055, survive in Budapest. It has recently been suggested that these may in fact come from an &quot;armilla&quot; or armband rather than a crown. Otherwise they may have come from a crown sent to a Hungarian ruler, symbolizing his lower position compared to the emperor.

Other remnants, or claimed remnants, of the regalia of the former Eastern Roman Empire, or items created in the imperial workshops, can be found among the regalia of various European royal houses; having been dispersed at various times and in various ways. Presumably, the bulk of the Imperial regalia found in Constantinople at the time of its conquest by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, was absorbed into the treasury of the Turkish sultan.

====Ancient Greece====

Examples of ancient-classical Greek regalia have been found among royal burial-goods in tombs at various archaeological sites. The most famous examples of which are probably certain of Heinrich Schleman&#x27;s finds, artifacts of ancient Crete, and the burials of the Macedonian dynasty.

===Hungary===


The &quot;Holy Crown of Hungary&quot;, also known as the &quot;Crown of Saint Stephen&quot; (, , , ), was the coronation crown used by the Kingdom of Hungary for most of its existence. The crown was bound to the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen, (sometimes the &quot;Sacra Corona&quot; meant the Land, the Carpathian Basin, but it also meant the coronation body, too). No king of Hungary was regarded as having been truly legitimate without being crowned with it. In the history of Hungary, more than fifty kings were crowned with it (the two kings who were not so crowned were John II Sigismund and Joseph II).

The Hungarian coronation insignia consists of the Holy Crown, the sceptre, the orb, and the mantle. Since the 12th century, kings have been crowned with the still extant crown. The orb has the coat-of-arms of Charles I of Hungary (1310–1342); the other insignia can be linked to Saint Stephen.

It was first called the Holy Crown in 1256. During the 14th century royal power came to be represented not simply by a crown, but by just one specific object: the Holy Crown. This also meant that the Kingdom of Hungary was a special state: they were not looking for a crown to inaugurate a king, but rather, they were looking for a king for the crown; as written by Crown Guard Péter Révay. He also depicts that &quot;the Holy Crown is the same for the Hungarians as the Lost Ark is for the Jewish&quot;.

Since 2000, the Holy Crown has been on display in the central Domed Hall of the Hungarian Parliament Building.

===Ireland===
The crown jewels of Ireland were heavily jeweled insignia of the Most Illustrious Order of Saint Patrick. They were worn by the sovereign at the installation of knights of that order, the Irish equivalent of the English Most Noble Order of the Garter and the Scottish Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle.
Older pre-conquest items relevant to the ancient Gaelic dynasties that once ruled Ireland probably also existed. One example of this is an ancient relic called the Comerford or &quot;Ikerrin&quot; Crown that was discovered in 1692 but may have since been lost.

===Italy===

* Kingdom of Sicily
* Kingdom of Naples
* Kingdom of two Sicilies
* Lombardy

the Iron Crown of the Lombard Kingdom, later used as crown of the medieval Kingdom of Italy and by Napoleon Bonaparte for its coronation as King of Italy, is kept at the Cathedral of Monza. The coronation robe is kept in the &quot;Schatzkammer&quot; museum in Vienna, Austria.
* Kings of Italy
The crown jewels of the Kingdom of Italy are in the custody of the Bank of Italy, due to legal controversy between the Italian Republic and the Savoia family. It is not clear who is the legal owner.

* Grand Dukes of Tuscany
On being made Grand Duke of Tuscany Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici was granted the use of an open radial crown with a representation of the red Florentine fleurs-de-lis with its stamens posed between the petals in place of the ray in the front, completely covered with precious stones, by Pope Pius V, who specified that the circlet of this crown be engraved with an inscription that the crown had been granted him to wear by the pope. On the actual crown this inscription was placed on the back of the circlet, while the front was actually covered with precious stones like the rest of the crown. A sceptre consisting of a gilt rod topped with a red-enameled globe topped in turn by a red-enameled Florentine Lily also formed part of the regalia of the grand dukes of Tuscany. The coronation portrait of the Grand Duke Gian Gaston de&#x27; Medici shows the same Florentine grand ducal crown closed with the pearl set arches associated with sovereignty. This crown was also used as the heraldic crown in the arms of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.

====Roman Empire====
Of the imperial regalia of the Roman emperors, previous to the Byzantine era, little remains. The best-known examples, and those with the strongest claim to authenticity, are a sceptre, some fittings for Roman standards, and other small items, all from a cache buried on the Palatine Hill c. the 3rd or 4th century AD, and discovered in 2006. The objects were made of fine bronze, glass, and semi-precious stone. These items were almost certainly intended for personal use by the emperor and his retinue, making them unique surviving examples of their type. The archaeologists who excavated the find have suggested that the items might have belonged to the emperor Maxentius, and may have been concealed by some unknown loyalist followers after his final defeat, and subsequent death. Beyond this, the regalia of the ancient Roman emperors exists primarily in artistic depictions from their time-period.

===Isle of Man===
The crown jewels of the Kingdom of Man consist of a ceremonial sword known as the Manx Sword of State. The Sword of State is carried by the sword bearer before the King&#x27;s personal representative to the Isle of Man, the lieutenant governor, at each meeting of Tynwald day and dates from not later than the 12th century. It is popularly said to be the sword of Olaf the Black, who became King of Mann and the Isles in 1226. Recent analysis of the sword has determined that it is a 15th-century design, and probably made in London. The blade itself is thought to have been fitted in the late 16th or 17th century. It is possible that the sword was made for the 1422 Tynwald meeting that was attended by Sir John Stanley. The sword has a two-edged steel blade, 29 inches long, with a hardwood hilt, 9 inches long, which tapers from the guard to the pommel. The guard is a thin steel band, 11 inches across, surmounted where the guard intersects the blade with shields carrying the &#x27;Three Legs of Man&#x27;, which also appear on the flattened pommel.

===Liechtenstein===
===Luxembourg===

===Monaco===

Monaco features a heraldic crown on its coat-of-arms, but does not possess any crown jewels or regalia per se.

===Netherlands===
===Norway===

The Crown Regalia, or crown jewels, of Norway are together with some other old treasures on permanent display in an exhibition at the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace next to the Nidaros Cathedral, in Trondheim.

===Poland===

The only surviving part of the Polish crown jewels is from the Piast dynasty and consists of the coronation sword known as the Szczerbiec. It is currently on display along with other royal items in the Wawel Royal Castle Museum, Kraków. Most of the crown jewels were plundered by retreating Prussian troops from Kraków in 1794.

One of many royal crowns was made for King Augustus II, Elector of Saxony when he became King of Poland in 1697. Since the original set was unavailable, a new set was made for the coronation in Kraków. However, the original set was regained, and the new set was never used. Today it is displayed in the Royal Castle in Dresden, Germany.

Similarly to Augustus II, his son Augustus III had difficulties with reaching the original set, and was forced to order a creation of a new one. His and his wives&#x27; crown jewels are the only Polish regalia set used for the coronation that have survived in its entirety.

===Portugal===

The Portuguese Crown Jewels were the pieces of jewelry, regalia, and vestments worn by the monarchs of Portugal during the time of the Portuguese Monarchy. Over the nine centuries of Portuguese history, the Portuguese Crown Jewels have lost and gained many pieces. Most of the current set of the Portuguese Crown Jewels are from the reigns of King João VI and King Luís I.

===Romania===
The Romanian crown jewels consist of three crowns: the Steel Crown, the Crown of Queen Elisabeta and the Crown of Queen Maria; and two scepters: the Scepter of Ferdinand I and the Scepter of Carol II. They are displayed at the National Museum of Romanian History in Bucharest.

The Romanian Communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu also sometimes made use of a scepter in his public appearances.

===Russia===

The coronation regalia, such as the Imperial Crown of Russia, the Imperial Orb of Catherine the Great, the Imperial Sceptre with the Orlov Diamond, the Shah Diamond, and others are kept at the Kremlin Armoury and Diamond Fund in Moscow.

===Serbia===
In Middle Ages, since 10th century Serbia had adopted diverse variants of crowns by Serbian Noble Families and Dynasties like Vojislavljević, Vukanović, Nemanjić, Dejanović, Lazarević, Branković and Mrnjavčević. The crown&#x27;s peak was during the Serbian empire, led by Emperor of Serbia Stefan Dusan Nemanjic.

The Crown jewels design was influenced by Eastern and Western European Art.

The Karađorđević crown jewels of Serbia were created in 1904 for the coronation of King Peter I. The pieces were made from material that included bronze of Karađorđe&#x27;s cannon. This gesture was symbolic because 1904 was the 100th anniversary of the First Serbian Uprising. They were made in Paris by the famous Falise brothers jewellery company.

===Slovenia===
A document known as &quot;The Swabian Mirror&quot; or &quot;Schwabenspiegel&quot; (c. 1275) refers to the installation of the dukes of Carantania and in it mentions a crown of sorts called the &quot;Slovenian Hat&quot; (&quot;windischer huot&quot;). This crown was placed on the head of the duke during the enthronement ceremony. The crown or hat is described as &quot;a grey Slovenian Hat with a grey cord and four leaves suspended from the brim&quot;. In 1358 the Habsburg Duke Rudolf IV imparted coats of arms to those provinces without them and ordered the &quot;Slovenian Hat&quot; to be placed above the arms of the Slovenian March (later called Lower Carniola and now a province of Slovenia).

A crown called the &quot;ducal hat&quot; of Carniola still exists in Graz.

===Spain===


The kingdoms that would consolidate to form Spain during the 15th and 16th centuries, namely the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, did not have consistent coronation ceremonies. The last recorded coronation ceremony in what would become Spain occurred in the 15th century; since then, the monarchs were not crowned, but proclaimed. As such, there was decreased importance for a coherent set of crown jewels, as these are usually themselves coronation regalia.

Much of what did exist into the modern era of the regalia of Spain was destroyed in the Great Fire of Madrid of Christmas Eve 1734. In the 18th century, King Charles III ordered a new crown and sceptre to be made. This crown is made of golden silver, and it features half-arches resting on eight plates bearing the emblems of the kingdom. The crown and scepter are displayed during the opening of the &quot;Cortes&quot; (Parliament). During ceremonies of accession with a new monarch, the crown and scepter are also present, but the crown itself is never placed on the monarch&#x27;s head. Today they are kept by the &quot;Patrimonio Nacional&quot; (the National Heritage).

Today, there are other pieces of jewelry and historically important items that would be considered &quot;crown jewels&quot; in other countries but are not denominated as such in Spain. In terms of jewelry, all of the jewels and tiaras worn by the members of the Spanish royal family are privately owned by them. More historically important elements are kept as pieces of cultural interest in different parts of Spain. For example, the personal crown used by Isabella I of Castile, her scepters, and her sword, are kept in the Royal Chapel in the Cathedral of Granada. As a consequence, this means that beyond the crown and scepter used during important occasions of the Spanish state, there is no other element of the crown jewels of Spain.

===Sweden===

Sweden&#x27;s crown jewels are kept deep in the vaults of the Royal Treasury, underneath the Royal Palace in Stockholm, in a museum which is open to the public. The symbols of the Swedish monarchy have not actually been worn since 1907, but are still displayed at weddings, christenings and funerals. Until 1974 the crown jewels were also displayed at the opening of the &quot;Riksdag&quot; (Parliament). Among the oldest objects are the sword of Gustav Vasa and the crown, orb, sceptre and key of King Erik XIV and numerous other sovereigns.

===Turkey===

====Ottoman Empire====
*The Sword of Osman was used at the enthonement ceremonies of Ottoman Sultans.
*The Spoonmaker&#x27;s Diamond sits in the Topkapi Palace. It is the palace&#x27;s most famous exhibit and is the fourth largest diamond of its kind. The diamond is surrounded by myths of all kind.
*Süleyman the Magnificent&#x27;s Venetian Helmet was a four-tiered papal tiara adorned with diamonds and pearls. It was crafted for Suleiman the Magnificent by Venetian craftsmen and Ibrahim Pasha, Suleiman&#x27;s Grand Vizier, who helped commission the helmet through his patronage of Alvise Gritti. Engravings by Agostino Veneziano depict Suleiman in his towering headgear. Early in his reign, Suleiman shared a similar level of interest in the patronage of European arts as Mehmed II. Politically, the tiara helped to advance the Ottoman &quot;imperium&quot; through its Roman-like synthesis of the eastern and western mediterranean. As such, it was a symbolic challenge to Christian sovereignty and rule because it stood taller than the Pope&#x27;s tiara (which only had &quot;three&quot; tiers.) Later, as Suleiman&#x27;s reign began to take an insular turn, the tiara was thought to be donated or put to the wayside, and eventually lost.
*The Topkapi Dagger is a dagger crafted in 1747 as a gift from Sultan Mahmud I to Nadir Shah, the ruler of Persia. The sheath is made of gold and studded with over fifty diamonds. In the center of the handle, lie three large inlaid emeralds. The emeralds are believed to have been shipped from the Muzo emerald mines in Colombia. On the bottom of the grip is an emerald pommel which flips open to reveal a hidden clock. The Topkapi dagger was sent as an attempt to curry favor with the newly empowered Shah. It is held in the Imperial Treasury section of Topkapı Palace. At the time of the dagger&#x27;s creation, the Persian ruler had recently defeated Mughal forces in modern-day Afghanistan and gained much loot by plundering the rich empire&#x27;s treasury. One stolen treasure was the famous &quot;Peacock throne,&quot; a gold throne decorated with gemstones, that the Shah made a replica of and sent to Mahmud I. In response, the Sultan sent the Topkapi Dagger; however, it never reached the Shah because of the latter&#x27;s death in 1747. The dagger was made famous in the movie &quot;Topkapi&quot; (1964), a heist film based on Eric Ambler&#x27;s novel &quot;The Light of Day&quot; (1962). The movie revolves around the planned and, eventually, failed theft of the Topkapi dagger. In some cases, bejeweled daggers, (as well as other precious items), were used to commemorate the opening or renaming of mosques.
*Embellished Cradles were important imperial gifts to newborn &quot;Sultanas&quot; and &quot;Sehzades&quot; that were often accompanied with gifts of embroidered quilts and blankets from the treasury steward and members of the court. An imperial procession with further gifts would be undertaken by the Queen mother and the Grand Vizier in honor of the infant child.

===Ukraine===

Crown of Galicia–Volhynia, presented to Daniel of Galicia by Innocent IV, is believed to have been lost.

===United Kingdom===

====England====
The crown jewels of England, now of the United Kingdom, are kept in the Tower of London. Apart from a 12th-century anointing spoon and three early 17th-century swords, they all date from after the Restoration of Charles II in 1661. The ancient crown jewels of England were destroyed by Oliver Cromwell in 1649 when he established the Commonwealth of England. St Edward&#x27;s Crown is the centrepiece of the coronation regalia, used at the moment of crowning and exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown, which is also worn at State Openings of Parliament. Among the precious stones on the crown are Cullinan II, the Stuart Sapphire, St Edward&#x27;s Sapphire, and the Black Prince&#x27;s Ruby (a spinel). On the Sovereign&#x27;s Sceptre with Cross is Cullinan I, the largest clear cut diamond in the world. Wives of kings are crowned as Queen Consort with a plainer set of regalia. The Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother houses the 105-carat Koh-i-Noor diamond. In addition to crowns there are also various orbs, swords, coronets, rings and other pieces of regalia.

====Scotland====

The Honours, or &#x27;crown jewels&#x27;, including the Stone of Scone, are kept in Edinburgh Castle. They are the oldest surviving crown jewels in the United Kingdom. The crown dates from at least 1540 and the sceptre and the sword were gifts by Pope Alexander VI and Pope Julius II respectively to the King of Scotland in the 15th and 16th centuries. They were hidden during the Interregnum. The Honours of Scotland were almost forgotten following their last use at the coronation of Charles II in 1651 until they were discovered in a chest inside Edinburgh Castle in the early 19th century.

A &#x27;golden royal crown&#x27; pre-dating the existing &#x27;Honours&#x27; had been in existence. It is recorded that it was seized by the English authorities following a search of the luggage of the deposed John Balliol as he attempted to leave England and make his way to exile in France following his release from imprisonment in London in 1299. This crown was sent to King Edward I in London where it was probably placed with the English crown jewels at Westminster Abbey. The later fate of this crown is not entirely clear, but it may have been returned to Scotland during the negotiations between Robert I of Scotland and Edward II of England (following the English defeat at Bannockburn in 1314) or perhaps was returned to Scotland for use in the coronation of Edward Balliol when he was installed as king of Scots by England in 1332. Nevertheless, it is not in existence today.

====Wales====
The original regalia of the Welsh princes have been lost. Llywelyn&#x27;s coronet was kept after its capture with the English crown jewels between 1284 and 1649.

===Vatican===

The regalia of the papacy are kept in the Vatican City. &quot;For further Information, see Papal regalia and insignia.&quot;

* The triregnum is a headgear with three crowns or levels, also called the triple tiara or triple crown. &quot;Tiara&quot; is the name of the headdress, even in the forms it had before a third crown was added to it. For several centuries, popes wore it during processions, as when entering or leaving Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica, but during liturgies they used an episcopal mitre instead. Paul VI used it on 30 June 1963 at his coronation, but abandoned its use later. None of his successors have used it.
* The Ring of the Fisherman, another item of papal regalia, is a gold ring decorated with a depiction of St. Peter in a boat casting his net, with the name of the reigning pope surrounding it.
* The papal ferula, a staff topped by a crucifix, is the staff used by the pope.

==The Americas==

===Brazil (Empire of Brazil)===

The Imperial Crown of Brazil along with other regalia and mementos of the Brazilian Empire are kept at the Imperial Museum of Brazil (&quot;Museu Imperial&quot;) in the former summer palace of Brazilian emperor Pedro II, in Petrópolis, Brazil. Some pieces are also owned by the jewellery collector Aimée de Heeren, former mistress of President Getúlio Vargas.

===Chile===

The Kingdom of Araucania and Patagonia has a crown, presented to Prince Philippe of Araucania in 1986 by a group of Araucanian nobles. Previously, the Royal House had no crown. Made of steel and containing stones from the Biobío River, it is on display at the Museum of the Kings of Araucania, outside the village of Chourgnac d&#x27;Ans, Dordogne, France.

===Mexico===

Prior to the Spanish conquest (1519–1522) most of present-day Mexico formed the Aztec Empire, a Native American empire ruled from Tenochtitlán (present day Mexico City) by a &quot;tlatoani&quot; or &quot;emperor&quot;. The ceremonial feathered headdress or &quot;quetzalāpanecayōtl&quot; that was worn by Montezuma II (the last reigning emperor) was seized by the Spanish Conquistadors in c. 1520 and sent back to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain as a gift. Remarkably, it still survives and Montezuma&#x27;s headdress can be seen at the Museum of Ethnology, Vienna (inventory number 10402VO) along with other ancient Mexican artifacts.

Setting aside the artifacts of Aztec and Spanish rule, there are also extant remnants of the imperial regalia of the First Mexican Empire and Second Mexican Empire.

==Oceania==

===Australia===
As a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, Australia&#x27;s crown jewels are those in the collection of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom. The government of the Commonwealth of Australia at the behest of Prime Minister Robert Menzies, together with those of the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, Ceylon, and Southern Rhodesia, presented to Elizabeth II a pair of armills for her 1953 coronation, to replace those made in 1661 for the coronation of Charles II. They remain a part of the crown jewels of the monarch of Australia and the other Commonwealth realms.

===Hawaii===

Some of the crown jewels and the original thrones of the Kingdom of Hawaii reside within the custody of the Bishop Museum. The King&#x27;s crown is owned by the State of Hawaii. All are currently on display in the throne room at Iolani Palace.

The two royals crowns were ordered from England in 1883 during Kalakaua&#x27;s coronation. Worn once and only by Kalakaua and his Queen Kapiolani, they were damaged by looters during the overthrow but later restored and replace with glass jewels. An earlier crown belonging to the Kamehameha dynasty may have existed. In 1855, missionary Samuel C. Damon, who attended the funeral of Kamehameha III, mentioned &quot;At the foot and in front of the coffin was the Royal Crown, covered with crape, resting upon a velvet cushion&quot; at the foot of the King&#x27;s casket. This crown was still being stored in the Royal Tomb at Pohukaina when Russian explorer Aleksei Vysheslavtsev visited the coral-house mausoleum during the funeral of John William Pitt Kīnaʻu in 1859. On May 26, 1861, Sophia Cracroft, the niece of Lady Franklin, also described the crown during a visit to Pohukaina.
If there ever was such a crown, it was either interred in the Royal Mausoleum with the last of the Kamehameha kings or became lost by 1883. King Lunalilo was buried in 1874 with a silver crown bore by John Mākini Kapena in his funeral procession. This crown was kept in the Lunalilo Mausoleum until 1917 when it was stolen by two robbers named Albert Gerbode and Paul Payne from Key West, Florida and subsequently melted into a silver bar.
Copies of the thrones can be seen at Iolani Palace. Some of the crown jewels lie in state with the royals at the Royal Mausoleum at Mauna Ala. Feather cloak and wear are among the oldest of Hawaiian regalias: Nāhiʻenaʻena&#x27;s Paū, the 180 feather skirt of Nāhiʻenaʻena and later the funeral attire for the dead monarch while lying in state; Kamehameha&#x27;s Cloak, the war-cloak of Kamehameha I made entirely of the golden-yellow feathers of the now-extinct mamo, which was used to drape the throne of the King when it wasn&#x27;t being worn; Kīwalaʻō&#x27;s Cloak, a.k.a. the Queen&#x27;s Cloak, the cloak won by Kamehameha during his battle with Kiwalao, and used to drape the throne of the Queen; and Liloa&#x27;s Kaei, the feather belt of Liloa, the 14th-century King of Hawaii. Also the &quot;Kiha-pu&quot; or the War Trumpet (Conch Shell) of Kihanuilulumoku which is one generation older than Liloa&#x27;s Kaei.

===New Zealand===
Kīngitanga is an unofficial kingdom, but one that has become an important one to the Māori people today. The current monarch is Tūheitia Paki. The crown regalia consists of a type of cloak, known to Māori as a korowai, and &#x27;crowning&#x27; ceremonies are performed by holding a bible over the new monarch&#x27;s head.

===Tahiti===

The Kingdom of Tahiti had a crown. The crown was a gift from the London Missionary Society to King Pōmare III for his coronation in 1824. The original is housed in the &quot;Musée de Tahiti et des Îles&quot; in Punaauia.

===Tonga===
The Crown of Tonga was made in 1873 for George Tupou I at the behest of his prime minister, The Reverend Shirley Waldemar Baker. The crown was fashioned by the jewellery firm of Hardy Brothers of Sydney, Australia. The gold crown of Tonga is reputedly the largest and heaviest crown in the world.

<text>In Greek mythology, Telemachus ( ; ) is the son of Odysseus and Penelope, who are central characters in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. When Telemachus reached manhood, he visited Pylos and Sparta in search of his wandering father. On his return to Ithaca, he found that Odysseus had reached home before him. Then father and son slew the suitors who had gathered around Penelope. According to later tradition, Telemachus married Circe after Odysseus&#x27;s death.

The first four books of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; focus on Telemachus&#x27;s journeys in search of news about his father, who has yet to return home from the Trojan War, and are traditionally given the title &quot;Telemachy&quot;.

==Etymology==

Telemachus&#x27;s name in Greek means &quot;far from battle&quot;, or perhaps &quot;fighting from afar&quot;, as a bowman does.

==&quot;Odyssey&quot;==
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Telemachus, under the instructions of Athena (who accompanies him during the quest), spends the first four books trying to gain knowledge of his father, Odysseus, who left for Troy when Telemachus was still an infant. At the outset of Telemachus&#x27;s journey, Odysseus had been absent from his home at Ithaca for twenty years due to the Trojan War and the intervention of Poseidon. During his absence, Odysseus&#x27;s house has been occupied by hordes of suitors seeking the hand of Penelope. Telemachus first visits Nestor and is well received by the old man who regales him with stories of his father&#x27;s glory. Telemachus then departs with Nestor&#x27;s son Peisistratus, who accompanies him to the halls of Menelaus and his wife Helen. Whilst there, Telemachus is again treated as an honored guest as Menelaus and Helen tell complementary yet contradictory stories of his father&#x27;s exploits at Troy. Telemachus also learns from Menelaus that his father was last seen stranded on Ogygia.

Telemachus focuses on his father&#x27;s return to Ithaca in Book XV. He visits Eumaeus, the swineherd, who happens to be hosting a disguised Odysseus. After Odysseus reveals himself to Telemachus due to Athena&#x27;s advice, the two men plan the downfall of the suitors. Telemachus then returns to the palace to keep an eye on the suitors and to await his father as the beggar.

When Penelope challenges the suitors to string Odysseus&#x27;s bow and shoot an arrow through the handle-holes of twelve axe heads, Telemachus is the first to attempt the task. He would have completed the task, nearly stringing the bow on his fourth attempt; however, Odysseus subtly stops him before he can finish his attempt. Following the suitors&#x27; failure at this task, Odysseus reveals himself and he and Telemachus bring swift and bloody death to the suitors.

==&quot;Telegony&quot;==

The &quot;Telegony&quot; was a short two-book epic poem recounting the life and death of Odysseus after the events of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. In this mythological postscript, Odysseus is accidentally killed by Telegonus, his unknown son by the goddess Circe. After Odysseus&#x27;s death, Telemachus returns to Aeaea with Telegonus and Penelope, and there marries Circe.

Seemingly later tradition included the character of Cassiphone—the daughter of Odysseus and Circe, and therefore half-sister of Telemachus—into the narrative. In this account, Telemachus still marries Circe, but Odysseus is resurrected by Circe at some point. Afterward, he weds Telemachus to Cassiphone. When events transpire that result in Telemachus killing Circe after quarrelling with her, Cassiphone kills Telemachus in revenge.

==Later classical authors==
From the &quot;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology&quot;: In the post-Homeric traditions, we read that Palamedes, when endeavouring to persuade Odysseus to join the Greeks against Troy, and the latter feigned idiocy, placed the infant Telemachus before the plough with which Odysseus was ploughing (Hygin. Fab. 95; Serv. ad Aen. ii. 81; Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 384; Aelian, V. H. xiii. 12.).

In &quot;Contest of Homer and Hesiod&quot;, it is alleged that the Roman Emperor Hadrian asked the Delphic Oracle about Homer&#x27;s birthplace and parentage. The Oracle replied that Homer came from Ithaca and that Telemachus was his father by Epicasta, daughter of Nestor.

According to Aristotle and Dictys of Crete, Telemachus married Nausicaa, King Alcinous&#x27;s daughter, and fathered a son named Perseptolis or Ptoliporthus.

Eustathius says that the mother was Polycaste, the daughter of Nestor. Others relate that he became the father of Latinus by Circe (Hygin. Fab. 127; comp. Telegonus). He is also said to have had a daughter called Roma, who married Aeneas (Serv. ad Aen. i. 273.).

Servius (ad Aen. x. 167) makes Telemachus the founder of the town of Clusium in Etruria.

==Other appearances==
Telemachus was the subject of numerous operas throughout the eighteenth century, most based on Fénelon&#x27;s version. Among the most famous of these operas were André Cardinal Destouches&#x27;s &quot;Télémaque&quot; (1714), Alessandro Scarlatti&#x27;s &quot;Telemaco&quot; (1718), Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Telemaco, ossia L&#x27;isola di Circe&quot; (1765), Giuseppe Gazzaniga&#x27;s &quot;Gli errori di Telemaco&quot; (1776), Jean-François Le Sueur&#x27;s &quot;Télémaque dans l&#x27;île de Calypso ou Le triomphe de la sagesse&quot; (1796), Simon Mayr&#x27;s &quot;Telemaco nell&#x27;isola di Calipso&quot; (1797), and Fernando Sor&#x27;s &quot;Telemaco nell&#x27;isola di Calipso&quot; (1797).

Telemachus appears in Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s 1833 poem &quot;Ulysses&quot;, where the title speaker (based on Dante&#x27;s version) expresses disappointment in his son.

Telemachus is a frequent character in the poetry of Louise Glück.

Telemachus was the name of Carole King&#x27;s cat and is pictured on the cover of her album &quot;Tapestry&quot;.

&quot;Telemachus&quot; is the title of a poem by American poet Ocean Vuong.

<text>The playoffs, play-offs, postseason or finals of a sports league are a competition played after the regular season by the top competitors to determine the league champion or a similar accolade. Depending on the league, the playoffs may be either a single game, a series of games, or a tournament, and may use a single-elimination system or one of several other different playoff formats. Playoff, in regard to international fixtures, is to qualify or progress to the next round of a competition or tournament.

In team sports in the U.S. and Canada, the vast distances and consequent burdens on cross-country travel have led to regional divisions of teams. Generally, during the regular season, teams play more games in their division than outside it, but the league&#x27;s best teams might not play against each other in the regular season. Therefore, in the postseason a playoff series is organized. Any group-winning team is eligible to participate, and as playoffs became more popular they were expanded to include second- or even lower-placed teams – the term &quot;wild card&quot; refers to these teams.

In England and Scotland, playoffs are used in association football to decide promotion for lower-finishing teams, rather than to decide a champion in the way they are used in North America. In the EFL Championship (the second tier of English football), teams finishing 3rd to 6th after the regular season compete to decide the third promotion spot to the Premier League.

The term &quot;post-season&quot; is also used in individual sports such as the sport of athletics or swimming to describe the period of championship meetings (such as regional championships, NCAA conference championships, national championships, or world championships) or their qualifiers after the regular season has concluded.

==American football==

===National Football League===
Evidence of playoffs in professional football dates to at least 1919, when the &quot;New York Pro Championship&quot; was held in Western New York (it is possible one was held in 1917, but that is not known for sure). The Buffalo and Rochester metropolitan areas each played a final, the winners of which would advance to the &quot;New York Pro Championship&quot; on Thanksgiving weekend. The top New York teams were eventually absorbed into the National Football League upon its founding in 1920, but the league (mostly driven by an Ohio League that did not have true finals, though they frequently scheduled &quot;de facto&quot; championship matchups) did not adopt the New York league&#x27;s playoff format, opting for a championship based on regular-season record for its first twelve seasons; as a result, four of the first six &quot;championships&quot; were disputed. Technically, a vote of league owners was all that was required to win a title, but the owners had a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement to pledge votes based on a score (wins divided by the sum of wins and losses, with a few tiebreakers). When two teams tied at the top of the standings in 1932, an impromptu playoff game was scheduled to settle the tie.

The NFL divided its teams into divisions in 1933 and began holding a single playoff final between division winners. In 1950 the NFL absorbed three teams from the rival All-America Football Conference, and the former &quot;divisions&quot; were now called &quot;conferences&quot;, echoing the college use of that term. In 1967, the NFL expanded and created four divisions under the two conferences, which led to the institution of a larger playoff tournament. After the 1970 AFL–NFL merger brought the American Football League into the NFL, the NFL began to use three divisions and a single wild-card team in each conference for its playoffs, in order to produce eight contenders out of six divisions; this was later expanded in 1978 and 1990 so that more wild-card teams could participate.

In 2002 the NFL added its 32nd team, the Houston Texans, and significantly reshuffled its divisional alignment. The league went from 6 division winners and 6 wild-card spots to 8 division winners and only 4 wild-card qualifiers; by , the number of wild-card qualifiers returned to six. The winners of each division automatically earn a playoff spot and a home game in their first rounds, the three top non-division winners from each conference also make the playoffs as wild-card teams. The division winner with the best record in the regular season gets a first-round bye, and each of the other division winners plays one of the three wild-card teams. In the divisional round, the lowest-seeded winner of a wild-card game then plays the lone bye team; the two wild-card winners also advance to play each other. The winners of these two games go to the conference championships, and the winners of those conference finals then face each other in the Super Bowl.

===College football===

====Division I NCAA Football FBS====
The College Football Playoff National Championship is a post-season college football bowl game, used to determine a national champion of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), which began play in the 2014 college football season. The game serves as the final of the College Football Playoff, a bracket tournament between the top four teams in the country as determined by a selection committee, which was established as a successor to the Bowl Championship Series and its similar BCS National Championship Game. Unlike the BCS championship, the participating teams in the College Football Playoff National Championship are determined by two semi-final bowls—hosted by two of the consortium&#x27;s six member bowls yearly—and the top two teams as determined by the selection committee do not automatically advance to the game in lieu of other bowls.

The game is played at a neutral site, determined through bids by prospective host cities (similarly to the Super Bowl and NCAA final four). When announcing it was soliciting bids for the 2016 and 2017 title games, playoff organizers said that the bids must propose host stadiums with a capacity of at least 65,000 spectators, and cities cannot host both a semi-final game and the title game in the same year.

The winner of the game is awarded a new championship trophy instead of the &quot;Crystal Football&quot;, which has been given by the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) since 1986; officials wanted a new trophy that was unconnected with the previous BCS championship system. The new College Football Playoff National Championship Trophy is sponsored by Dr Pepper, which paid an estimated $35 million for the sponsorship rights through 2020. The 26.5-inch high, 35-pound trophy was unveiled on July 14, 2014.

====Division I NCAA Football FCS====
The NCAA Division I Football Championship is an American college football tournament played each year to determine the champion of the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). Prior to 2006, the game was known as the NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship. The FCS is the highest division in college football to hold a playoff tournament sanctioned by the NCAA to determine its champion. The twelve-team playoff system used by the Bowl Subdivision is not sanctioned by the NCAA.

====Division II NCAA Football====
The NCAA Division II Football Championship is an American college football tournament played annually to determine a champion at the NCAA Division II level. It was first held in 1973. Prior to 1973, four regional bowl games were played in order to provide postseason action for what was then called the &quot;NCAA College Division&quot; and a poll determined the final champion.

The National Championship final was held at Sacramento, California from 1973 to 1975. It was in Wichita Falls, Texas in 1976 and 1977. The game was played in Longview, Texas in 1978. For 1979 and 1980, Albuquerque, New Mexico hosted the game. McAllen, Texas hosted the finals from 1981 to 1985. From 1986 to 2013, the Division II final was played at Braly Municipal Stadium near the campus of the University of North Alabama in Florence, Alabama. Between 2014 and 2017, it was played at Children&#x27;s Mercy Park in Kansas City, Kansas. Since 1994, the games have been broadcast on ESPN.

====Division III NCAA Football====
The NCAA Division III Football Championship began in 1973. Before 1973, most of the schools now in Division III competed either in the NCAA College Division or the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). NCAA Divisions II and III were created by splitting the College Division in two, with schools that wished to continue awarding athletic scholarships placed in Division II and those that did not want to award them placed in Division III.

The Division III playoffs begin with 32 teams selected to participate in them. The Division III final, known as the Stagg Bowl, has been played annually in Salem, Virginia at Salem Football Stadium since 1993. It was previously played in Phenix City, Alabama at Garrett-Harrison Stadium (1973–1982, 1985–1989), at the College Football Hall of Fame, when the Hall was located in Kings Island, Ohio at Galbreath Field (1983–1984), and Bradenton, Florida at Hawkins Stadium (1990–1992).

==Association football==

As a rule, international association football has only had championship playoffs when a league is divided into several equal divisions, conferences or groups (Premier League) or when the season is split into two periods (as in many leagues in Latin America). In leagues with a single table done only once a year, as in most of Europe, playoff systems are not used to determine champions, although in some countries such systems are used to determine teams to be promoted to higher leagues (e.g., England) or qualifiers for European club competitions (such as Greece and the Netherlands), usually between teams that didn&#x27;t perform well enough to earn an automatic spot.

A &quot;test match&quot; is a match played at the end of a season between a team that has done badly in a higher league and one that has done well in a lower league of the same football league system. The format of a test match series varies; for instance it can be a head-to-head between one of the worse finishers of the higher league and one of the better finishers of the lower league, or it can be a mini league where all participants play each other or teams only play those from the other league. The winner of the test match series play in the higher league the following season, and the loser in the lower league.

=== International playoffs ===
In international football, playoffs were a feature of the 1954 and 1958 FIFA World Cup final tournaments. They are still a feature of the qualification tournaments for the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Football Championship.

In the qualification playoffs for the 2006 World Cup, for example:
* In Europe, after the first-place finishers in each of eight groups received automatic finals places, along with the two second-place teams that had earned the most points against teams in the top six of their individual groups, the remaining six second-placed teams entered playoffs to select three teams for the finals.
* The winners of the Oceania qualifying tournament, Australia played the fifth-placed team from the South American qualifying tournament, Uruguay.
* The fifth-placed team of the Asia qualifying tournament, Bahrain played the fourth-placed team in the CONCACAF qualifying tournament, Trinidad and Tobago.

Later World Cup qualifying inter-confederation play-offs were held for 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022.

CONCACAF Nations League and UEFA Nations League hold their respective finals to determine the overall winner at the end of the league, CONCACAF Nations League Finals and UEFA Nations League Finals.

===Argentina===
In Argentine football, playoffs in the style of the English leagues occur in the Primera B Metropolitana, part of the third tier, and leagues below it (Primera C Metropolitana and Primera D Metropolitana). All &quot;Primera Metropolitana&quot; tourneys cover the area in and around Buenos Aires, the capital city. The &quot;Torneo Reducidos&quot; (reduced tournaments), however, involve 8 teams below the top two, as opposed to 4.

Before the top-flight Argentine Primera División abandoned its traditional Apertura and Clausura format in 2015 in favor of an expanded single season, there was no playoff between the Apertura and Clausura winners. As a result, the league crowned two champions each year. After each Clausura, the two teams with the lowest points-per-game total for the previous six tournaments (three years, counting only Primera División games) were relegated to Primera B Nacional to be replaced by that league&#x27;s champion and runner-up teams; the two teams immediately above contested promotion/relegation series with the third and fourth places in Primera B Nacional, counted by its aggregate table. In Primera B Nacional, the same procedure continues in use for relegation to either Primera B Metropolitana or Torneo Argentino A for non-Buenos Aires clubs. From 2015 onward, relegation from the Primera División will be based solely on league position at the end of the season (which, effective in 2016–17, changed from a February–December format to an August–June format).

=== Australia ===
The Australian A-League, which also features a team in New Zealand, has determined its champions via a playoff system, officially known as the &quot;Finals Series&quot; (reflecting standard Australian English usage), since its inception in the 2005–06 season.

From the league&#x27;s inception through the 2008–09 season, the top four teams advanced to the finals series, employed using a modified Page playoff system. The top two teams at the end of league play were matched in one semifinal, with the winner advancing directly to the grand final and the loser going into the Preliminary Final. The next two teams played a semifinal for a place in the Preliminary Final, whose winner took the other place in the grand final. Both semifinals were two-legged, while the Preliminary Final and Grand Final were one-off matches.

When the league expanded to 10 teams beginning in 2009–10, the finals expanded to six teams. The format of the six-team playoff established at that time was:
* The &quot;semifinals&quot; were held over a two-week period. The pairings for Week 1 of the semifinals were 1 vs 2, 3 vs 6, and 4 vs 5.
* In Week 1, the top two teams played the first leg of a two-legged match, and the remaining teams played one-off knockout matches.
* In Week 2, the top two teams played the second leg of their semifinal, and the two other surviving teams played a one-off match. The winner of the two-legged match advanced directly to the grand final, while the loser of that match joined the winner of the last semifinal in the Preliminary Final.
* The Preliminary Final and Grand Final remained unchanged.

Starting with the 2012–13 season, the finals format has been changed to a pure knockout tournament consisting entirely of one-off matches:
* In Week 1, two Elimination Finals will be held, with the pairings being 3 vs 6 and 4 vs 5.
* In Week 2, the winners of the Elimination Finals advance to Semi-Finals. The top team on the regular-season table, called the &quot;premiers&quot; by the A-League, plays the lowest-seeded survivor of the Elimination Finals, and the second-place team plays the other Elimination Final survivor.
* The Grand Final, pitting the two Semi-Final winners, takes place in Week 3.

The concept of a finals series/playoff is standard in Australian sport.

=== Belgium ===
The Belgian First Division A (previously known as the &quot;First Division&quot; and &quot;Pro League&quot;) has a fairly complex playoff system, currently consisting of two levels and at one time three.

Since the 2009–10 season, playoffs have been held to determine the champion and tickets for the Champions League and Europa League. The six highest ranked teams play home-and-away matches against each other; a total of 10 matches each. The 6 participating teams start with the points accumulated during the regular competition divided by two. The first 3 teams after the play-offs get a European ticket. The fourth ranked team (or fifth, when the cup holder is already qualified for European football) plays a knock-out match against the winner of play-off 2. From 2009 to 2010 through 2015–16, teams ranked 7–14 played in two groups; from 2016 to 2017 forward, this playoff will continue to be contested in two groups, but with a total of 12 teams (details below). All points gained from the regular competition are lost. The two group winners play a final match to determine the winner of play-off 2. The winning team plays a final match against the fourth-ranked team (or fifth) for the last European ticket.

The play-off system has been criticized because more points per match can be earned in the play-off stage than in the regular competition. This way the team who wins the most matches isn&#x27;t automatically the national champion. The biggest upside in favor of the play-off system is the higher number of matches (40 instead of 34 compared to the previous season) and more top matches. The extra matches also generate higher revenues for the teams.

Nonetheless, the higher number of matches takes an extra toll on teams and players. Besides play-offs, the Royal Belgian Football Association (KBVB) also introduced Christmas football in order to complete the extra matches in time. This posed some problems because a few matches had to be cancelled due to snowy pitches. The delays will probably cause the tight schedule to fail and postpone the end of the season.

Some structural changes were instituted in 2015–16:
* The team that finished atop the regular-season table is now assured of a Europa League place if they fail to finish in a Champions League qualifying spot (currently top two places).
* The first tiebreaker between Championship Round teams is now regular-season position.
* Accumulated yellow cards from the regular season are erased, although suspensions will continue to carry over. During the playoffs, three accumulated yellow cards will result in a suspension, as opposed to five during the regular season.

From 1974 through 2015, the 15th team out of 16 in the final standings was involved in a playoff pool with three teams from the Belgian Second Division after each season, to determine which of these teams played in the First Division/Pro League the oncoming season. The lowest ranked team of the First Division/Pro League was relegated and replaced by the Second Division champion.

Originally, these playoffs were introduced in 1974 and were part of the Second Division, to determine which team was promoted to the highest level together with the division champions. From the 2005–06 season on, only one team was relegated directly from the First Division, with the 17th team taking part in the playoff. As a result, this playoff was still called the Belgian Second Division final round, although one team from the Pro League took part each year.

Starting in 2015–16, this playoff was scrapped and replaced with direct relegation for the bottom Pro League/First Division A team only.

Further changes will be introduced to the Europa League playoffs from 2016 to 2017 forward. The playoff will involve a total of 12 teams—nine from First Division A, and three from First Division B (the renamed Second Division). The First Division A qualifiers will be those finishing between 7th and 15th on the regular-season table. The First Division B qualifiers will be the top three teams from that league&#x27;s regular-season table, excluding the division champion, which instead earns promotion to First Division A. As in the previous format, the teams will be divided into two groups, each playing home-and-away within the group, and the two group winners will play a one-off final, with the winner of that match advancing to a one-off match against the fourth- or fifth-place team from the championship playoff (depending on available European slots) for the final Europa League place.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, the Copa do Brasil, the second most prestigious country-wide competition, is contested in pure &quot;knockout&quot; format since its inception in 1989. While the top two tiers in the Brazilian League – Série A and Série B – are contested in double round robin format, the lower tiers Série C and Série D include knockout rounds in their final stages.

=== Bulgaria ===
Bulgaria instituted an elaborate playoff system in its top flight, the First League, in the 2016–17 season.

After the league&#x27;s 14 teams play a full home-and-away season, the league splits into two playoffs—a 6-team &quot;championship playoff&quot; and an 8-team &quot;qualifying playoff&quot;, with the latter split into two 4-team groups. Each playoff begins with teams carrying over all goals and statistics from the home-and-away season.

Each team in the championship playoff plays the others home and away one additional time. At the end of this stage:
* The top team is declared league champion, and earns the country&#x27;s sole place in the UEFA Champions League.
* The second-place team earns a place in the UEFA Europa League.
* The highest-placed team that has not already qualified for European competition advances to an eventual one-off match for the country&#x27;s final Europa League place. This will often be the third-place team, but if the winner of the Bulgarian Cup (which earns an automatic Europa League place) is in the top three of the playoff, the fourth-place team will take its place.

Each group within the qualifying playoff also plays home and away within its group; after this stage, teams enter another level of playoffs depending on their positions in the group.

The top two teams in each group enter a knockout playoff consisting entirely of two-legged matches (unless one of these teams is the winner of that season&#x27;s Bulgarian Cup, in which case it will not enter the playoff and the team that it would have played receives a bye into the playoff final). The winner of this playoff then contests a one-off match against the third-place (or fourth-place) team from the championship playoff, with the winner claiming the final Europa League place.

The bottom two teams from each group begin a series of relegation playoffs. The series starts with a knockout playoff that also consists entirely of two-legged matches. The winner of the playoff remains in the First League for the following season. The losing teams then enter the following series of two-legged promotion/relegation matches:
# The losers of the knockout semifinals play, with the loser relegated to the Second League.
# The loser of the knockout final plays the third-place team from the Second League, with the winner playing in the next season&#x27;s First League.
# Finally, the winner of Match 1 above plays the second-place team from the Second League, with the winner also playing in the next season&#x27;s First League.

=== Dominican Republic ===
With the creation of the Liga Dominicana de Fútbol in 2014 to replace the Primera División de Republica Dominicana, it introduced a playoff system to determine the champion of the season.

=== England and Wales===
When the Football League was first expanded to two divisions in 1892, test matches were employed to decide relegation and promotion between them, but the practice was scrapped in favour of automatic relegation and promotion in 1898.

The use of play-offs to decide promotion issues returned to the League in 1986 with the desire to reduce the number of mid-table clubs with nothing to play for at the end of the season. The Football Conference, now known as the National League, introduced play-offs in 2002 after the Football League agreed to a two-club exchange with the Conference.

The top two teams in the EFL Championship and in EFL League One are automatically promoted to the division above and thus do not compete in the play-offs. The top three teams in EFL League Two and the champion of the National League (formerly known as Conference Premier) are also automatically promoted. In EFL playoffs, the four clubs finishing below the automatic promotion places compete in two-legged semi-finals with the higher-placed club enjoying home advantage in the second leg. In the National League however, the six clubs finishing below the champions compete in playoffs - the lower four competing in an elimination match to decide who plays in the semifinals (the top two receive a bye into the semifinals). The away goals rule does not apply for the semi-finals. The Football League play-off finals were originally played in two legs, at both teams&#x27; home grounds, but were later changed to one-off affairs, which are played at Wembley Stadium in London.

Teams are also promoted using a play-off tournament from levels six to eight of the football pyramid. At level six, the play-off semi-finals are two leg ties with the final being a single match played at the home ground of the highest placed of the two teams. At levels seven and eight, all of the ties are single matches played at the home ground of the team with the highest league position.

In 2003, Gillingham proposed replacing the current play-off system with one involving six clubs from each division and replacing the two-legged ties with one-off matches. If adopted, the two higher-placed clubs in the play-offs would have enjoyed first-round byes and home advantage in the semi-finals. It was a controversial proposal — some people did not believe a club finishing only in eighth position in the League could (or should) compete in the Premiership while others found the system too American for their liking. Although League chairmen initially voted in favour of the proposal, it was blocked by The FA and soon abandoned.

The championship of every division in English football is determined solely by the standings in the league. However, a championship play-off would be held if the top two teams were tied for points, goal difference, goals scored in both their overall league record, and identical head-to-head record (including head-to-head away goals scored); to date, this has never happened. A play-off would also be scheduled if two teams are tied as above for a position affecting promotion, relegation, or European qualification.

=== Greece ===
Starting in the 2007–08 season, Superleague Greece instituted a playoff system to determine all of its places in European competition for the following season, except for those of the league champion and the cup winner. Currently, the league is entitled to two Champions League places and three in the Europa League, with one of the Europa League places reserved for the cup winner. The playoff currently takes the form of a home-and-away mini-league involving the second- through fifth-place teams, under the following conditions:
* The fifth-place team starts the playoffs at 0 points.
* The remaining teams start with a number of &quot;bonus points&quot; determined as follows:
** The number of points earned by the fifth-place team during the main league season is subtracted from the totals of each other club involved in the playoffs.
** The resulting number is then divided by 5 and rounded to the nearest whole number.
* At the end of the playoffs, the winner receives the country&#x27;s second Champions League place. The next two teams enter the Europa League at different points depending on their playoff finishes; the last-placed team is entirely out of European competition. However, if the cup winner finished in a playoff spot (as happened in 2010–11), &quot;or&quot; the league champion also won the cup, and the losing cup finalist finished in a playoff spot (as happened in 2012–13), the bottom three teams in the playoff all receive Europa League berths.

=== Italy ===
In 2004–05, Italy&#x27;s professional league introduced a promotion playoff to its second tier of football, Serie B. It operates almost identically to the system currently used in England. The top two clubs in Serie B earn automatic promotion to Serie A with the next four clubs entering a playoff to determine who wins the third promotion place, as long as fewer than 10 points separate the third and fourth-placed teams (which often occurs).

Like the English playoffs, the Italian playoffs employ two-legged semi-finals, with the higher finisher in the league table earning home advantage in the second leg. If the teams are level on aggregate after full-time of the second leg, away goals are not used, but extra time is used. Unlike England, the Italian playoff final is two-legged, again with the higher finisher earning home advantage in the second leg. In both rounds, if the tie is level on aggregate after extra time in the second leg, the team that finished higher in the league standings wins.

In 2003–04, Italy&#x27;s football league used a two-legged test match to determine one spot in the top level of its system, Serie A. Some leagues in continental Europe combine automatic promotion/relegation with test matches. For example, in the Netherlands, only one club is automatically relegated from its top level, the Eredivisie, each season, with the winner of the second-flight being promoted. The next two lower-placed teams enter a promotion/relegation mini-league with high-placed teams from the Dutch First Division

=== Japan ===
J.League in Japan used a test match series between the third-from-bottom team in J1 and third-place team in J2 (see J. League promotion/relegation Series) from 2004 to 2008. The promotion/relegation Series concept dates as far back as 1965 and the first season of the Japan Soccer League.

The J.League Championship was held in J.League Division 1 from the inaugural season in 1993 to the 2004 season, and in the J1 League for the 2015 and 2016 seasons, as a post-season tournament to determine the annual champion.

Promotion/relegation Series occurred with the 2012–2016 seasons of J. League Division 2/J2 League, conditional on the top two J3 League (JFL teams from 2012 to 2013) fulfilling J. League club criteria. In turn, J2 implemented a promotion playoff to J1 on the style of England for the 3rd to 6th clubs.

The Japan Football League, the current Japanese 4th division, uses the promotion/relegation Series only when the number of clubs in the league needs to be filled with clubs from the Japanese Regional Leagues.

=== Mexico ===
Mexico&#x27;s top flight league, Liga MX, is contested annually by 18 teams. In each of two annual tournaments, every team plays every other team in the league once (17 games), after which the top eight teams advance to the &quot;Liguilla&quot;.

In the Liguilla, all rounds are home-and-away. Teams are drawn so the best team plays the worst, the second-best plays the second-worst, and so on. After one round, the teams are redrawn so the best remaining team again plays the worst remaining one and the second-best faces the second-worst in the semi-finals. The two winners of this round play each other for the championship.

There is no playoff between the Apertura and Clausura winner. As a result, the league crowns two champions each year. After each Clausura, the team with the lowest points-per-game total for the previous six tournaments (three years, counting only Liga MX games) is relegated to Ascenso MX to be replaced by that league&#x27;s champion (if eligible).

=== Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, a playoff was introduced in the 2005–06 season. It is used to determine which teams from the Eredivisie qualify for European football. The playoff system has been criticized by clubs, players and fans as the number of matches will increase. Under the original playoff format, it was possible, though thoroughly unlikely, that the runner-up would not qualify for Europe; the following year, the format was changed so that the second-place team was assured of no worse than a UEFA Cup berth. Starting in 2008–09, the format was changed yet again. The champion goes directly to the Champions League; the runner-up enters the second qualification round of the CL; the number three enters the fourth (and last) qualification round of the UEFA Europa League (EL; the new name of the UEFA Cup from 2009 to 2010 onward) and the number four goes to the third qualification round of the EL. The only play-off will be for the clubs placed 5th through 8th. The winner of that play-off receives a ticket for the second qualification round of the EL.

Playoffs are also part of the promotion and relegation structure between the Eredivisie and the Eerste Divisie, the two highest football leagues in the Netherlands.

=== Philippines ===
The Philippines Football League (PFL) adopted a playoffs for its inaugural 2017 season. The top four clubs of the regular season qualified for the playoffs which was dubbed as the &quot;Finals Series&quot;. The Finals Series was dropped after the establishment of the Copa Paulino Alcantara which became the PFL&#x27;s cup tournament.

=== Scotland ===
The Scottish Football League (SFL) experimented briefly with test matches in 1995–96 and 1996–97, contested between the second-bottom team of the Premier Division and the second-placed team of the First Division.

After the Scottish Premier League (SPL) and SFL merged in 2013 to form the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL), reuniting the top four divisions of Scotland since the breakaway of the SPL in 1998–99, a modified test match format was introduced between the Scottish Premiership and Scottish Championship. The bottom team from the first-tier Premiership is automatically relegated and is replaced by the winners of the second-tier Championship, provided that club meets Premiership entry criteria. The second-, third- and fourth-placed teams from the Championship qualify for a play-off consisting of two-legged ties, with the second-placed team receiving a bye to play the winner of the teams that finished third and fourth. The winner of this play-off then faces the second-bottom Premiership team, also over two legs, with the winner of that tie taking up the final Premiership place (again, assuming that the Championship club meets Premiership criteria).

The three lower divisions of the SPFL — the Championship, League One and League Two — continue with the promotion/relegation play-off system their predecessor SFL leagues used (the First Division, Second Division and Third Division, respectively). In the Championship/League One and League One/League Two, while the champions are automatically promoted and the bottom team relegated, there are play-offs of the second-bottom teams against the second-, third- and fourth-placed teams from the division below. Home and away ties decide semi-finals and a final, and the overall winner plays in the higher division the following season, with the loser playing in the lower division.

Beginning with the 2014–15 season, promotion and relegation between the SPFL and the Scottish regional leagues were introduced. Following the end of the league season, the winners of the fifth-level Highland and Lowland Leagues compete in a two-legged playoff. The winner then enters a two-legged playoff against the bottom team from Scottish League Two, with the winner of that tie either remaining in or promoted to League Two.

Long before the SPL era, two situations arose in which the top two teams in the table had to share the title as neither goal average nor goal difference had been instituted to break ties. The first was the inaugural season, in which Dumbarton and Rangers both earned 29 points and had to play off for the title. The match ended in a 0–0 draw and both teams shared the title. The second happened 19 years later, in the Second Division, when Leith Athletic and Raith Rovers both earned 33 points. This time, the clubs chose not to play off. In 1915 goal average was finally instituted.

=== Spain ===

For the 2010–11 season, the Segunda División experimented with promotion playoffs between the 3rd to 6th-placed teams, similar to the rules in the English and Italian systems. However, due to reserve teams being allowed to compete in the same football league system, subsequent places may be allowed to play off depending on reserve teams finishing within the 3rd to 6th places.

At a lower level, playoffs in Segunda División B take place to decide the divisional title between the 4 group winners, and to decide which other teams would be promoted, as follows:

*The first set of matches are an elimination tournament between the 4 group winners. The winners of each match are promoted and then play a final for the tier title.
*After the tier final takes place, the teams who finished 2nd in each of the 4 groups play the teams who finished 4th, whereas the teams who finished third play each other. The 6 winners, along with the 2 Group winners who lost their games in the earlier semifinals, play in each other in a knockout format until there is 2 teams remaining who are promoted.
*If within the qualifying places exist reserve teams whose senior teams are already in Segunda División, subsequent places are allowed to play off. If the senior teams are relegated from Segunda División during the season, the reserve team is automatically disqualified from competing and relegated to Tercera División.

Previously a playoff system had been used in which the teams finishing 3rd and 4th from last in La Liga had played off against the teams finishing 3rd and 4th in the Segunda División. This system had been introduced in the 1980s but ended in 1998–99.

=== United States and Canada ===
In Major League Soccer, the top flight in the United States and Canada, the MLS Cup Playoffs are contested after the end of the regular season by the top teams in each conference. The winner of the MLS Cup, the final match in the playoffs, is considered the league&#x27;s champion for that season. The number of teams that qualify has varied: from the 2012 season to the 2014 season, the top five teams in each of its two conferences played in the playoffs; this was increased to six teams from 2015 to 2018 and later seven teams in the 2019 season, which also switched all rounds to single-elimination matches. Under this system, the conferences have separate playoff brackets.

Since the 2023 edition, the MLS Cup Playoffs have had nine teams from each conference playing in separate brackets until the MLS Cup final. The preliminary round has the eighth seed hosting the ninth seed while the top seven seeds get a prelim-round bye. Whoever wins plays the top seed in Round One. In Round One, the top-seed hosts the eighth-ninth winner, the runner-up hosts the seventh seed, the third hosts the sixth, and the fourth hosts the fifth, in best-of-three games. The remaining rounds (the conference semifinals, conference final, and MLS Cup final) are single-elimination matches hosted by the team with the better regular season record. 62 percent of teams make the playoff under this new format.

Since 2012, the MLS Cup has been hosted by the conference champion that has the most table points during the regular season.

In the case of ties after regulation in any round, 30 minutes of extra time (divided into two 15-minute periods) would be played followed by a penalty-kick shootout, if necessary, to determine the winners.

The defunct Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer (WPS), which operated only in the U.S., conducted a four-team stepladder tournament consisting of one-off knockout matches. The third seed hosted the fourth seed in the first round. The winner of that game advanced to the &quot;Super Semifinal&quot;, hosted by the second seed. The Super Semifinal winner traveled to the top seed for the final. The WPS&#x27;s replacement, the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (which launched in 2013), uses a single elimination tournament. The current NWSL playoff structure has a more standard eight-team knockout playoff where the top-seed hosts the eighth, the runner-up hosts the seventh, the third-ranked team plays the sixth-ranked, and the fourth plays the fifth. The lowest-seeded winner from the quarterfinals plays the highest-seeded and the next-lowest the next-highest team in the semifinals. The winners of two one-off semifinals advance to the one-off final. From 2021 to 2023, the NWSL had a 6-team tournament; and from 2013 to 2019, it had a 4-team single elimination tournament.

==Australian rules football==
Playoffs are used throughout Australia in Australian rules football to determine the premiership. The term finals is most commonly used to describe them.

In each league, between four and eight teams (depending on league size) qualify for the finals based on the league ladder at the end of the season. Australian rules football leagues employ finals systems which act as a combination between a single elimination tournament for lower-ranked teams and a double elimination tournament for higher-ranked teams in order to provide teams with an easier pathway to the grand final as reward for strong performances throughout the season. Finals are decided by single matches, rather than series.

The Australian Football League, which is the top level of the sport, currently has eight teams qualify for the finals under a system designed by the league in 2000. Between 1931 and 1999, variants of the McIntyre system were used to accommodate four, five, six and eight teams, and prior to 1930, six different finals systems were used.

In most other leagues, from state-level leagues such as the South Australian National Football League and West Australian Football League, down to local suburban leagues, it is most common for either four or five teams to qualify for the finals. In these cases the Page–McIntyre final four system or the McIntyre final five system are used universally.

The Australian Football League (which was known until 1990 as the Victorian Football League) was the first league to introduce regular finals when it was established in 1897. The South Australian National Football League introduced finals in 1898, and other leagues soon followed.

Prior to 1897, the premiership was generally awarded to the team with the best overall win–loss record at the end of the season. If two teams had finished with equal records, a playoff match for the premiership was required: this occurred in the Challenge Cup in 1871, the South Australian Inter-club competition in 1874, the SAFA in 1889 and 1894, and in the VFA in 1896.

==Baseball==

===South Korea===
The teams finishing in fourth and fifth place in the regular season face each other in the wildcard game. The winner of the wildcard game faces the team that finished in third place in the first round of the play-offs. The winner of the first round faces the team that finished in second place during the regular season, and the winner of that round faces the team that finished in first place for the championship in the Korean Series. This type of format is known as the stepladder playoff.

===Japan===

Before 1950, the original Japanese Baseball League had been a single-table league of franchises. After it was reorganized into the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) system, a series of playoffs ensued between the champions of the Central League and Pacific League.

Before the playoff system was developed in both professional leagues, the Pacific League had applied a playoff system on two occasions. The first was between 1973 and 1982, when a split-season was applied with a 5-game playoff between the winning teams from both halves of season (unless a team won both of the halves so that they did not need to play such a game). The second time was between 2004 and 2006, when the top three teams played a two-staged stepladder knockout (3 games in the first stage and 5 games in the second stage) to decide the League Champion (and the team playing in the Japan Series). After this system was applied, the Seibu Lions (now Saitama Seibu Lions), Chiba Lotte Marines and Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters, which claimed the Pacific League Championship under this system, were all able to clinch the following Japan Series in that season. The success of such a playoff system convinced the Central League to consider a similar approach. In 2007, a new playoff system, named the &quot;Climax Series&quot;, was introduced to both professional leagues in NPB to decide the teams that would compete for the Japan Series. The Climax Series basically applied the rule of the playoff system in the Pacific League, with one important change: each League championship is awarded to the team finishing the regular season at the top of their respective league, regardless of their fate in the playoffs. This means that the two League Champions are not guaranteed to make the Japan Series. The Chunichi Dragons took advantage of this in the first Climax Series season, finishing second in the regular season but sweeping the Hanshin Tigers and the League Champion Yomiuri Giants in the Central League to win a place in the Japan Series; they subsequently defeated the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters to claim their first Japan Series in 52 years.

In 2008, the format of Climax Series will have a slight change, in which the second stage will be played over a maximum of six games, with the League Champion starting with an automatic one game advantage.

===United States and Canada===

====Major League Baseball====

Major League Baseball (MLB) itself does not use the term &quot;playoffs&quot; for championship tournaments. Instead, it uses the term &quot;postseason&quot; as the title of the elimination tournament held after the conclusion of the regular season. From to and , it consisted of a first round single-elimination Wild Card Game between the two wild-card teams in each league. From , the postseason begins with a two best-of-three Wild Card Series first round, followed by a best-of-five second round series called the Division Series, and two rounds of best-of-seven series for the League Championship Series and World Series. One exception is , when the first-round series, the Wild Card Series, a best-of-three round, was created, along with the other rounds. The first three seeds went to division champions, the next three seeds to division runners-up, and the last two to the next-best records. The pairings for the Wild Card Series are as follows: top seed vs. eighth, second vs. seventh, third vs. sixth, and fourth vs. fifth. The division series has the 1–8 winner play the 4–5 winner, while the 2–7 winner plays the 3–6 winner.

MLB uses a &quot;2–3–2&quot; format for the final two rounds of its postseason tournament. The singular term &quot;playoff&quot; is reserved for the rare situation in which two (or more) teams find themselves tied at the end of the regular season and are forced to have a tiebreaking playoff game (or games) to determine which team will advance to the postseason. Thus, a &quot;playoff&quot; is actually &quot;part of the regular season&quot; and can be called a &quot;pennant playoff&quot;. However, the plural term &quot;playoffs&quot; is conventionally used by fans and media to refer to baseball&#x27;s postseason tournament, not including the World Series.

MLB is the oldest of the major American professional sports, dating back to the 1870s. As such, it is steeped in tradition. The final series to determine its champion has been called the &quot;World Series&quot; (originally &quot;World&#x27;s Championship Series&quot; and then &quot;World&#x27;s Series&quot;) as far back as the National League&#x27;s contests with the American Association during the 1880s.

====Minor League Baseball====
Most of the domestic Minor League Baseball (MiLB) leagues which are affiliated with Major League Baseball conduct playoffs after their regular season to determine champions.

Before the 2021 reorganization of MiLB, most leagues at the Triple-A, Double-A, and Class A-Advanced classification levels included four qualifying teams which competed in two best-of-five rounds: semi-finals and finals. Most Class A, Class A Short Season, and Rookie League playoffs consisted of two best-of-three rounds. The champions of the two Triple-A leagues, the International League and Pacific Coast League, met in the Triple-A National Championship Game, a single game to determine an overall champion of the classification.

In the 2021 season, the first after the reorganization, no MiLB league had more than two teams involved in playoffs, with some leagues not holding a postseason at all.
* The Rookie leagues, better known as the Complex Leagues (from those leagues being hosted at major-league spring training facilities), did not hold playoffs; the regular-season winners were crowned champions.
* In all Low-A, High-A, and Double-A leagues (three at each level), the top two teams at the end of the regular season advanced to a best-of-five championship series.
* In both Triple-A leagues, the top team at the end of the 120-game regular season was crowned champion. After the regular season, all 30 teams at this level played a 10-game &quot;Final Stretch&quot;.

===Taiwan===

Taiwan&#x27;s playoff is different to many such competitions, due to the league&#x27;s split-season format. The winners of the first half-season and the winners of the second half-season are eligible to play in the playoffs, but if the best overall team have not won either half season then they qualify into a wild card series against the weaker half-season winner, with the winner of this advancing into the Taiwan Series to face the other half-season winner. If the first and second half winners are different, but one of them is also the best overall team, then both teams progress directly to the Taiwan Series. Finally, if one team wins both halves of the season then a playoff will take place between the second and third best teams for the right to play them in the Final Series; in this case the team winning both halves of the season will begin the Taiwan Series with an automatic one game advantage.

==Basketball==

===National Basketball Association===

The present organization known as the National Basketball Association, then called the BAA (Basketball Association of America), had its inaugural season in 1946–47. Teams had always have different strength of schedule from each other; currently, a team plays a team outside its conference twice, a team within its conference but outside its division three or four times, and a team from its own division four times.

In the current system, eight clubs from each of the league&#x27;s two conferences qualify for the playoffs, with separate playoff brackets for each conference. In the 2002–03 season, the first-round series were expanded from best-of-5 to best-of-7; all other series have always been best-of-7. In all series, home games alternate between the two teams in a 2-2-1-1-1 format.

The 2-3-2 finals format was adopted from the 1985 Finals to 2013, copying the format that was then in effect in the National Hockey League. Prior to 1985, almost all finals were played in the 2-2-1-1-1 format (although the 1971 Finals between Milwaukee and Baltimore were on an alternate-home basis, some 1950s finals used the 2-3-2 format, and the 1975 Golden State-Washington and 1978 and 1979 Seattle-Washington Finals were on a 1-2-2-1-1 basis). Also, prior to the 1980s, Eastern and Western playoffs were on an alternate-home basis except for series when distance made the 2-2-1-1-1 format more practical. Since 2014, the NBA Finals restored the original format.

Teams are seeded according to their regular-season record. Through the 2014–15 season, the three division champions and best division runner-up received the top four seeds, with their ranking based on regular-season record. The remaining teams were seeded strictly by regular-season record. However, if the best division runner-up had a better record than other division champs, it could be seeded as high as second. Beginning in 2015–16, the NBA became the first major American league to eliminate automatic playoff berths for division champions; the top eight teams overall in each conference now qualify for the playoffs, regardless of divisional alignment.

Since the 2019–20 season, only the top six teams qualify directly to the playoffs. The remaining two teams in each conference are determined through what is officially considered a separate postseason tournament, consisting of the seventh through tenth-placed teams. Known as a play-in tournament, it consists of three, one-game series:

* Seventh placed team vs. eighth placed team
* Ninth placed team vs. tenth placed team
* Loser of 7–8 game vs. winner of 9–10 game.

The winner of the 7–8 game advances to the playoffs as the 7th seed, while the loser faces the winner of the 9–10 game (the loser of it is eliminated from playoff contention). The winner of this third game advances to the playoffs as the 8th seed, while the loser is also eliminated from playoff contention. From there, the playoffs continue as normal.

===Elsewhere===
Top flight basketball leagues elsewhere also employ a playoff system mimicking the NBA&#x27;s. However, most leagues are not divided into divisions and conferences, and employ a double round robin format akin to league association football, unlike the NBA where teams are divided into divisions and conferences, which leads to different strengths of schedule per team. Teams are seeded on regular season record. The playoff structure can be single-elimination or a best-of series, with the higher seed, if held the playoffs are not held at a predetermined venue, having the home court advantage.

Aside from the playoffs, some leagues also have a knockout tournament akin to the FA Cup running in parallel to the regular season. These are not considered playoffs.

In the EuroLeague, after the regular season plays a best-of-5 playoffs in a 2–2–1 format. However, from the semifinals on, it is a single elimination tournament held at a predetermined venue. Still others also have a relegation playoff.

In NCAA Division I basketball conferences, a playoff or &quot;postseason tournament&quot; is held after the regular season. Most conferences, including all of the &quot;major&quot; basketball conferences (ACC, American, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, SEC), hold their tournaments at a predetermined venue, with all conference teams participating (unless barred due to NCAA sanctions). A few conferences hold early rounds at campus sites and later rounds at a predetermined site. For example, the Mid-American Conference holds its first-round games at campus sites, but the rest of the tournament in Cleveland. The Big South Conference holds its first round at campus sites, gives hosting rights for its quarterfinals and semifinals to the regular-season champion, and plays its final at the home court of the top remaining seed. The America East Conference, ASUN Conference, and Patriot League hold all tournament games at campus sites. A small number of conferences do not invite all of their teams to the conference tournament, with one example being the Ivy League, in which only four of the eight members advance to the tournament (which is at a predetermined site). In many such tournaments, higher seeds are afforded byes. The winners, and some losers which are selected as &quot;at-large bids&quot;, play in the NCAA tournament, which is also single-elimination and held at predetermined venues.

In the WNBA Playoffs, the league&#x27;s best 8 teams, regardless of conference alignment, compete, and are seeded based on their regular-season records. The top two seeds are reserved for the conference leaders plus the next six teams with the next-best records. Since 2022, the league quarterfinals are best-of-three on an 2-1 basis, and the league semifinals and finals are best-of-5 on a 2-2-1 basis.

==Canadian football==
In the Canadian Football League, the playoffs begin in November. After the regular season, the top team from each division has an automatic home game berth in the Division Final, and a bye week during the Division Semifinal. The second-place team from each division hosts the third-place team in the Division Semifinal, unless the fourth-place team from the opposite division finishes with a better record. This &quot;crossover rule&quot; does not come into play if the teams have identical records—there are no tiebreakers. While the format means that it is possible for two teams in the same division to play for the Grey Cup, so far only two crossover teams have won the divisional semifinal game. The winners of each Division&#x27;s Semifinal game then travel to play the first place teams in the Division Finals. Since 2005, the Division Semifinals and Division Finals have been sponsored by Scotiabank and are branded as the &quot;Scotiabank East Championship&quot; and &quot;Scotiabank West Championship&quot;. The two division champions then face each other in the Grey Cup game, which is held on the third or fourth Sunday of November.

The Edmonton Elks are notable for qualifying for the CFL playoffs every year from 1972 to 2005, a record in North American pro sports. They are also the first crossover team to ever win the divisional semifinal game.

There were no playoffs in 2020.

==Cricket==
There are a number of T20 leagues played in cricket for a few weeks each in many countries, which all generally follow some variation of the Page playoff system, and have 8 teams.

===Indian Premier League===
The Indian Premier League is the largest T20 league, and uses the Page playoff format: the top two teams in the group stage play a semi-final, and the third and fourth-place teams play an eliminator match, to determine which will remain in contention for the final. The two remaining teams that have not yet qualified for the final among the top four teams then play a second semi-final, and then the final occurs.

=== The Hundred ===

The Hundred is an English 100-ball cricket tournament. The top three teams from the 8-team group stage advance to the playoffs, with the winner of a semi-final between the second and third-placed teams facing the table-toppers in the final.

===Minor League Cricket===

Minor League Cricket (MiLC) features 27 American teams split into the Pacific and Atlantic conferences, each of which is split into two regional divisions. The top two teams from each division advance to the Quarterfinals, with the final contested by one team from each conference. The Quarterfinal is unique in that it is a best-of-three series, and that it sees the top team from one division playing the second-placed team from the other division of their conference; this offers teams an incentive to finish as high as possible in the league stage so as to draw an easier matchup in the Quarterfinals.

==Hockey==

===National Hockey League===
The National Hockey League playoff system is an elimination tournament competition for the Stanley Cup, consisting of four rounds of best-of-seven series. The first three rounds determine which team from each conference will advance to the final round, dubbed the Stanley Cup Finals. The winner of that series becomes the NHL and Stanley Cup champion.

Since 2014, the Conference Quarterfinals consists of four match-ups in each conference, based on the seedings division-wise (No. 1 vs. No. 4, and No. 2 vs. No. 3). The division winner with the best record in the conference plays the lowest wild-card seed, while the other division winner plays the top wild-card seed (wild-card teams, who are de facto 4th seeds, may cross over to another division within the conference). In the Conference Semifinals, the four remaining teams in the conference face each other. In the third round, the Conference Finals, the two surviving teams play each other, with the conference champions proceeding to the Stanley Cup Finals.

For the first two rounds, the higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage (regardless of point record). Thereafter, it goes to the team with the better regular season record. In all rounds the team with home-ice advantage hosts Games 1, 2, 5 and 7, while the opponent hosts Games 3, 4 and 6 (Games 5–7 are played &quot;if necessary&quot;).

For the , in which the regular season was prematurely ended by the COVID-19 pandemic only the top four teams in each conference, as determined by points-per-game, qualified directly to the First Round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. The remaining four First Round teams per conference were determined by best-of-five &quot;Stanley Cup Qualifiers.&quot;

===Kontinental Hockey League===
The Kontinental Hockey League, based in Russia and including teams from several nearby countries, operates a playoff system similar to that of the NHL, also consisting of four rounds of single-elimination best-of-seven series. The first three rounds determine which team from each conference will advance to the final round, dubbed the Gagarin Cup Finals. The winner of that series becomes the KHL and Gagarin Cup champion.

Like the NHL, the Conference Quarterfinals consists of four match-ups in each conference. The winner of each division receives one of the top two seeds in its conference; the others are based on regular-season record. Unlike the NHL, divisional alignment plays no added role in playoff seeding—all teams are seeded solely within their conference. Playoff pairings are based on seeding number within the conference (No. 1 vs. No. 8, No. 2 vs. No. 7, No. 3 vs. No. 6, and No. 4 vs. No. 5). The division winner with the best record in the conference plays the lowest wild-card seed, while the other division winner plays the next-lowest seed (wild-card teams, who are de facto 4th seeds, may cross over to another division within the conference). The playoff pairings are reseeded after the first round (a feature that was once used in the NHL, but now abandoned). Therefore, the Conference Semifinals feature the top remaining seed in the conference playing the lowest remaining seed, and the two other first-round survivors playing one another. In the third round, the Conference Finals, the two surviving teams play each other, with the conference champions proceeding to the Gagarin Cup Finals.

For the first two rounds, the higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage (regardless of point record). Thereafter, it goes to the team with the better regular season record. In all rounds the team with home-ice advantage hosts Games 1, 2, 5 and 7, while the opponent hosts Games 3, 4 and 6 (Games 5–7 are played &quot;if necessary&quot;).

===Elite Ice Hockey League===
In the United Kingdom, the Elite Ice Hockey League playoffs are an elimination tournament where the draw is based on the finishing position of teams in the league. Of the 10 teams which compete, the top 8 qualify for the playoffs. The first round (the quarter-finals) are played over two legs (home and away) where the team who finished in 1st place in the regular season plays the team which finished 8th, 2nd plays 7th and so on, with the aggregate score deciding which team progresses.

The semi-finals and final are held over the course of a single weekend at the National Ice Centre in Nottingham. Each consists of a single game with the losing team being eliminated, with the two semi-final games being played on the Saturday and the final on the Sunday. There is also a third-place game held earlier on the Sunday between the losing teams from the semi-finals. Unlike in the NHL, the winners of the Elite League playoffs are not considered to be the league champions for that season (that title goes to the team which finishes in first place in the league), rather the playoffs are considered to be a separate competition although being crowned playoff champions is a prestigious accolade nonetheless. The most recent playoff champions are the Nottingham Panthers.

==NASCAR==
NASCAR implemented a &quot;playoff&quot; system beginning in 2004, which they coined the &quot;Chase for the NEXTEL Cup&quot;. When first introduced, only NASCAR&#x27;s top series used the system, although the other two national racing series (currently known as the Xfinity Series and the Gander Outdoors Truck Series) have since adopted similar systems. One unique feature of the NASCAR playoffs is that the non-qualifying drivers continue to compete alongside the playoff drivers: the qualifying drivers merely have their championship points reset one or more times during the playoffs to figures so high that no non-qualifying driver could ever catch them.

There are actually two different playoffs going on at the end of the season in each series: one for the drivers and another &quot;owner&#x27;s points&quot; playoff for the racing teams. Only one multi-driver team has ever won the Cup series owner&#x27;s point championship: in 2015, Kyle Busch won the championship after missing the first 11 races of the season due to injury; 3 other drivers drove the No. 18 car during his absence. Because of the way the playoffs were structured that year, however, both he and his No. 18 team won their respective championships with 5043 points. There have been two cases where a playoff driver failed to enter every playoff race. In 2005, Kurt Busch was fired by Roush Racing with two races left in the season. Busch finished 10th out of 10 Chase drivers, but Kenny Wallace stepped in to drive the No. 97 car to an 8th-place finish in the owner&#x27;s points race. In 2012, Dale Earnhardt Jr. missed two playoff races due to injury. Regan Smith drove the No. 88 car for two races, including a top-10 finish at Kansas Speedway. In that case, Smith&#x27;s 43 additional championship points on top of Earnhardt&#x27;s 2,245 were not enough to pull the No. 88 team out of 12th place out of 12 playoff contenders.

In the original version of the Chase (2004–2006), following the 26th race of the season, all drivers in the top 10 and any others within 400 points of the leader got a spot in the 10-race playoff. Like the current system, drivers in the Chase had their point totals adjusted. However, it was based on the number of points at the conclusion of the 26th race. The first-place driver in the standings led with 5,050 points; the second-place driver started with 5,045. Incremental five-point drops continued through 10th place with 5,005 points.

The first major change to the Chase was announced by NASCAR chairman and CEO Brian France on January 22, 2007. After 26 races, the top 12 drivers advanced to contend for the points championship and points were reset to 5000. Each driver within the top 12 received an additional 10 points for each win during the &quot;regular season&quot;, or first 26 races, thus creating a seeding based on wins. As in previous years, the Chase consisted of 10 races and the driver with the most points at the conclusion of the 10 races was the NEXTEL Cup Series Champion. Under the points system then in use, drivers could earn 5 bonus points for leading the most laps, and 5 bonus points for leading a single lap.
Brian France explained why NASCAR made the changes to the chase:
&quot;The adjustments taken [Monday] put a greater emphasis on winning races. Winning is what this sport is all about. Nobody likes to see drivers content to finish in the top 10. We want our sport -- especially during the Chase -- to be more about winning.&quot;

Beginning with the 2008 season, the playoff became known as the &quot;Chase for the Sprint Cup&quot; due to the NEXTEL/Sprint merger.

The next format of the Chase was announced by France on January 26, 2011, along with several other changes, most significantly to the points system. After 26 races, 12 drivers still advanced to the Chase, but the qualifying criteria changed, as well as the number of base points that drivers received at the points reset.

Under this system. only the top 10 drivers in points automatically qualified for the Chase. They were joined by two &quot;wild card&quot; qualifiers, specifically the two drivers ranked from 11th through 20th in points who had the most race wins (with tiebreakers used if needed to select exactly two qualifiers). These drivers then had their base points reset to 2,000 instead of the previous 5,000, reflecting the greatly reduced points available from each race (a maximum of 48 for the race winner, as opposed to a maximum of 195 in the pre-2011 system). After the reset, the 10 automatic qualifiers received 3 bonus points for each race win, while the wild card qualifiers received no bonus.

On January 30, 2014, even more radical changes to the Chase were announced; these took effect for the 2014 season:
* The number of drivers qualifying for the Chase was expanded to 16, with this group officially called the NASCAR Sprint Cup Chase Grid.
* The Chase Grid is now selected primarily on the basis of race wins during the first 26 races (also known as the &quot;regular season&quot;). If fewer than 16 drivers win races. remaining spots on the Chase Grid are filled in order of regular-season drivers&#x27; points. Note that the basic point system has not changed from 2013.
* The Chase is now divided into four rounds. After each of the first three rounds, the four Chase Grid drivers with the fewest season points are eliminated from the Grid and championship contention. Any driver on the Chase Grid who wins a race in the first three rounds automatically advances to the next round. Also, all drivers eliminated from the Chase have their points readjusted to the regular-season points scheme, although they retain their points total from the last Chase round in which they participated.
** Challenger Round (races 27–29)
*** Begins with 16 drivers, each with 2,000 points plus a 3-point bonus for each win in the first 26 races.
** Contender Round (races 30–32)
*** Begins with 12 drivers, each with 3,000 points.
** Eliminator Round (races 33–35)
*** Begins with eight drivers, each with 4,000 points.
** NASCAR Sprint Cup Championship (final race)
*** The last four drivers in contention for the season title start the race at 5,000 points, with the highest finisher in the race winning the Cup Series title.

The Chase for the Sprint Cup has been generally panned since its inception, as many drivers and owners have criticized the declining importance of the first 26 races, as well as very little change in schedule from year to year. Mike Fisher, the director of the NASCAR Research and Development Center, has been one of the more vocal critics of the system, saying that &quot;Due to NASCAR having the same competitors on the track week in, week out, a champion emerges. In stick-and-ball sports, every team has a different schedule, so head-to-head series are necessary to determine a champion. That does not apply to auto racing.&quot;

NASCAR extended the Chase format to its other two national touring series, the Xfinity Series and Gander Outdoors Truck Series (then the Camping World Truck Series), beginning in 2016. The formats used in the two lower series are broadly similar to the format used in the Cup Series, but have some significant differences:
* The Xfinity and Truck Series Chases are held over three rounds, instead of four in the Cup Series.
* Each of the first two rounds of the Xfinity and Truck Series Chases consists of two races (compared to three in the first three rounds of the Cup Series Chase).
* The Xfinity Series Dash 4 Cash, consisting of four short events with the winners receiving cash prizes, has been incorporated into that series&#x27; Chase. A driver who wins two Dash 4 Cash events is considered as having one regular race win, which essentially qualifies the driver for the Chase even if he or she wins no other race during the season. However, there is no points bonus for Dash 4 Cash wins.
* Instead of the 16 drivers who qualify in the Cup Series, 12 drivers qualify in the Xfinity Series and 8 in the Truck Series.
* Four drivers are eliminated at the end of each of the first two rounds of the Xfinity Series Chase, as in the Cup Series. The Truck Series Chase eliminates only two drivers at the end of its first two rounds. All formats end with four drivers eligible to win the season title entering the season&#x27;s last race.
* The rounds of the Chase now have a standard name across all series. The rounds leading up to the final race are now officially called &quot;Round of X&quot;, where &quot;X&quot; is the number of drivers eligible for the season title. The drivers in the final race that are still eligible for the season title are called the &quot;Championship 4&quot;.

Starting with the 2017 season, NASCAR abandoned the term &quot;Chase&quot;, instead calling its final series the &quot;playoffs&quot;.

==Rugby league==

===National Rugby League===
Play-offs are used to decide the premiers of the National Rugby League (NRL) in Australasia, where they are known as &quot;finals&quot; (also as &quot;semi-finals&quot; or &quot;semis&quot;) – as in Australian rules football, the participating teams only come from within a single division, and the tournament is staged as single matches rather than a series. Currently, in the NRL, eight teams qualify for the finals; starting with the 2012 season, the system was changed from the McIntyre final eight to the same system used by the AFL.

Previously, the term play-off was used in the NSWRL and BRL competitions to describe matches which were played as tie breakers to determine qualification for the finals series. Since 1995, points differential decides finals&#x27; qualification and play-offs are no longer held.

===Super League===
The Super League rugby league competition has used a play-off system to decide its champion since 1998. The original play-off format featured the top five highest-ranked teams after the regular season rounds. Starting in 2002, the play-offs added an extra spot to allow the top six to qualify. With the addition of two new teams for the 2009 season, the play-offs expanded to eight teams. The next format, scrapped after the 2014 season, worked as follows:

Week One
*Qualifying play-off 1: 1st vs 4th &quot;(winner receives a bye to week three)&quot;
*Qualifying play-off 2: 2nd vs 3rd &quot;(winner receives a bye to week three)&quot;
*Elimination play-off 1: 5th vs 8th &quot;(loser goes out)&quot;
*Elimination play-off 2: 6th vs 7th &quot;(loser goes out)&quot;

Week Two
*Preliminary Semi-Final 1: QPO 1 Loser vs EPO 1 Winner
*Preliminary Semi-Final 2: QPO 2 Loser vs EPO 2 Winner

Week Three
*Qualifying Semi-Final 1: QPO 1 Winner vs PSF 1 &quot;or&quot; PSF 2 Winner *
*Qualifying Semi-Final 2: QPO 2 Winner vs PSF 1 &quot;or&quot; PSF 2 Winner *

Week Four
* Grand Final: Winners of Qualifying Semi-Finals meet at Old Trafford

&quot;* Opponents decided by the QPO winner (in Week 1) that finished higher in the regular season

Beginning in 2015, the Super League season was radically reorganised, and more closely integrated with that of the second-level Championship. Following a home-and-away season of 22 matches, the top eight clubs in Super League now enter a single round-robin mini-league known as the Super 8s, with the top four teams after that stage entering a knockout play-off to determine the champion. The four bottom teams in Super League at the end of the home-and-away season are joined by the top four from the Championship after its home-and-away season. These eight teams play their own single-round-robin mini-league known as The Qualifiers; at its end, the top three teams are assured of places in the next season&#x27;s Super League, with the fourth- and fifth-place teams playing a single match billed as the &quot;Million Pound Game&quot;, with the winner also playing in Super League in the following season.

===Other leagues===
The two tiers directly below Super League, the Championship and League 1 (the latter of which was known as Championship 1 from 2009 to 2014)—formerly the National Leagues until the 2009 addition of a French club to the previously all-British competition—used the old top six system to determine which teams were promoted between its levels through the 2014 season. After that season, both leagues abandoned the top six system. Before the 2008 season, when Super League established a franchising system and ended automatic promotion and relegation in Super League, the National Leagues also used this system to determine the team that earned promotion to Super League. The top six system involved the following:

Week One
* Elimination Semi-final A: 3rd vs 6th (4th vs 7th in Championship 1)
* Elimination Semi-final B: 4th vs 5th (5th vs 6th in Championship 1)

Week Two
* Elimination Final: Winners of Elimination Semi-final A vs Winners of Elimination Semi-final B
* Qualification Match: 1st vs 2nd (2nd vs 3rd in Championship 1)

Week Three
* Final Qualifier: Winners of Elimination Final vs Losers of Qualification Match

Week Four
* Grand Final: Winners of Qualification Match vs Winners of Final Qualifier (in Super League, at Old Trafford)

Since 2015, all clubs in Super League and the Championship play a 22-match home-and-away season. Upon the end of the home-and-away season, the clubs will split into three leagues, with two of them including Championship clubs. The Super 8s will feature the top eight Super League sides. The second league, The Qualifiers, will include the bottom four clubs from Super League and the top four from the Championship, whilst the third will feature the remaining eight Championship sides. The bottom two leagues will begin as single round-robin tournaments. In The Qualifiers, the top three sides will either remain in or be promoted to Super League, with the fourth- and fifth-place teams playing the aforementioned &quot;Million Pound Game&quot; for the final Super League place. In the third league, the sides compete for the Championship Shield, with the top four teams after the round-robin phase entering a knockout playoff for the Shield. The bottom two teams are relegated to League 1.

League 1 currently conducts a 15-match, single round-robin regular season. At that time, the league splits in two. The top eight clubs play in their own Super 8s, also contested as a single round robin. At the end of the Super 8s, the top club earns the season title and immediate promotion to the Championship. The second- through fifth-place clubs contest a knockout playoff for the second place in the Championship. The bottom eight clubs play their own single round-robin phase; at its end, the top two teams play a one-off match for the League 1 Shield.

==Rugby union==

===England===

==== Premiership ====
In the Gallagher Premiership, the top four qualify for the play-offs, where they are not referred to by that name. The tournament is a Shaughnessy playoff: the team that finished first after the league stage plays the team that finished fourth, while the team that finished second plays the team that finished third in the Semi-Finals, with the higher-ranked team having home advantage. The winners of these semi-finals qualify for the Premiership Final at Twickenham, where the winner will be champions of the league.

====Championship====
Through the 2016–17 season, the second-level RFU Championship used play-offs—but unlike the Premiership, the Championship officially used the term &quot;play-offs&quot;. At the end of the league stage, top teams advanced to a series of promotion play-offs. From the first season of the Championship in 2009–10 to 2011–12, the top eight teams advanced; from 2012–13 through to 2016–17, the top four advanced. A relegation play-off involving the bottom four teams existed through the 2011–12 season, but was scrapped from 2012 to 2013 on.

The original promotion play-offs divided the eight teams into two groups of four each, with the teams within each group playing a home-and-away mini-league. The top two teams in each group advanced to a knockout phase. In 2010, the semi-finals were one-off matches; in 2011, they became two-legged. The top team in each pool played the second-place team from the other group in the semi-finals; the winners advanced to the two-legged final, where the ultimate winner earned promotion to the Premiership (assuming that the team met the minimum criteria for promotion).

In the first year of the play-offs in 2010, all eight teams started equal. After that season, it was decided to reward teams for their performance in league play. in 2011 and 2012, the top two teams at the end of the league stage carried over 3 competition points to the promotion play-offs; the next two teams carried over 2; the next two carried over 1; and the final two teams carried over none. (Points were earned using the standard bonus points system.)

The relegation play-offs, like the first stage of the promotion play-offs, were conducted as a home-and-away league, with the bottom team at the end of league play relegated to National League 1. As with the 2010 promotion play-offs, that season&#x27;s relegation play-offs started all teams equal. in 2011 and 2012, each team in the relegation play-offs carried over 1 competition point for every win in the league season.

Beginning with the 2012–13 season, the pool stage of the promotion playoffs was abolished, with the top four sides directly entering the semi-finals. The format of the knockout stage remained unchanged from 2012, with two-legged semi-finals followed by a two-legged final. At the other end of the table, the bottom club is now automatically relegated.

Effective with the 2017–18 season, the promotion play-offs were scrapped for a minimum of three seasons, to be replaced with automatic promotion for the club finishing atop the league at the end of the home-and-away season (provided said club meets minimum Premiership standards).

===France===
The highest level of French rugby union, the Top 14, expanded its playoffs starting with the 2009–10 season from a four-team format to six teams. In the new system, the top two teams after the double round-robin season receive first-round byes. The first-round matches involve the third- through sixth-place teams, bracketed so that 3 hosts 6 and 4 hosts 5. The winners then advance to face the top two teams in the semifinals, which are held at nominally neutral sites (a traditional feature in the French playoffs)—although in the 2011–12 season, the semifinals were held at Stadium de Toulouse, occasionally used as a &quot;big-game&quot; venue by traditional Top 14 power Stade Toulousain. The winners of these semifinals qualify for the final at Stade de France (though in 2016, the final was at Camp Nou in Barcelona due to conflict with UEFA Euro 2016), where the winner will be champions of the league and receive the Bouclier de Brennus. Before 2009–10, the playoffs format was identical to that of the English Premiership with the exception of neutral sites for the semifinals.

Beginning in 2017–18, only the bottom club is automatically relegated to Rugby Pro D2. The second-from-bottom Top 14 side plays a one-off match against the runner-up of the Pro D2 playoffs for the final place in the next Top 14 season.

Pro D2 adopted the Top 14 playoff system effective in 2017–18, though with all matches held at the higher seed&#x27;s home field. The playoff champion earns automatic promotion; the runner-up enters a one-off match for potential promotion to Top 14. Previously, Pro D2 used a four-team playoff, involving the second- through fifth-place teams, to determine the second of two teams promoted to the next season&#x27;s Top 14, with the regular-season champions earning automatic promotion. Under this system, the promotion semifinals were held at the home fields of the second- and third-place teams, and the promotion final was held at a neutral site.

=== United Rugby Championship ===
The United Rugby Championship (URC), originally known as the Celtic League and later as Pro12 and Pro14, adopted a four-team playoff starting with the 2009–10 season. The format was essentially identical to that of the English Premiership. Through the 2013–14 season, the final was held at a ground chosen by the top surviving seed, with the caveat that the venue must have a capacity of at least 18,000. In 2012–13, top seed Ulster could not use its regular home ground of Ravenhill for that reason (the ground was later expanded to meet the requirement). The league changed to using a predetermined site for its championship final in 2014–15.

With the addition of two South African sides in 2017–18, the league split into two conferences and expanded its playoffs to six teams. The top team of each conference earns a bye into the semifinals, where they will host the winners of matches between the second- and third-place teams from the other conferences (with the second-place team hosting the third-place team from the opposite conference).

After the 2020–21 season, both South African sides left the league and were replaced by the country&#x27;s four former Super Rugby franchises, with the competition being rebranded as the URC. The league split into four regionally based pools—one each for Ireland, South Africa, and Wales, plus a joint Italian–Scottish pool. While the top team of each pool at the end of the regular season will receive a trophy branded as a regional &quot;Shield&quot; and automatic qualification for the following season&#x27;s European Rugby Champions Cup, all teams are combined into a single table for purposes of playoff qualification. The top eight teams advance to knockout playoffs, with the higher seed hosting all matches leading up to the championship final, which continues to be held at a predetermined site.

=== New Zealand ===
Both domestic competitions in New Zealand rugby — the semi-professional National Provincial Championship (known by several sponsored names) and the nominally amateur Heartland Championship — use a playoff system to determine their champions, although the term &quot;playoff&quot; is also not used in New Zealand, with &quot;finals&quot; used instead.

==== National Provincial Championship ====
In the 2006 Air New Zealand Cup, the first season of the revamped domestic structure in that country, the top six teams after Round One of the competition automatically qualified for the finals, officially known as Round Three. Their relative seeding was determined by their standings at the end of the Top Six phase of Round Two. The teams that finished below the top six entered repechage pools in Round Two, with the winner of each pool taking up one of the final two finals slots. The seventh seed was the repechage winner with the better record, and the eighth seed was the other repechage winner.

From 2007 onward, the former Rounds One and Two were collapsed into a single pool phase of play in which all teams participated. In 2007 and 2008, the top eight teams advanced to the playoffs; in what was intended to be the final season of the Air New Zealand Cup format in 2009, the Shaughnessy format was used, with the top four advancing to the finals. The New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) ultimately decided to stay with the previous format for the rebranded 2010 ITM Cup, with the same four-team playoff as in 2009. Starting in 2011, the NZRU split the ITM Cup into two seven-team leagues, the top-level Premiership and second-level Championship, and instituted promotion and relegation in the ITM Cup (a feature of the country&#x27;s former National Provincial Championship). The competition was renamed the Mitre 10 Cup in 2016.

The playoffs in each season format have consisted of a single-elimination tournament. The teams are bracketed in the normal fashion, with the higher seed receiving home-field advantage. In 2007 and 2008, the playoff was rebracketed after the quarterfinals, with the highest surviving seed hosting the lowest surviving seed and the second-highest surviving seed hosting the third surviving seed. The winners of these semifinals qualify for the Cup Final (2006–10) or Premiership/Championship Final (2011–), held at the home ground of the higher surviving seed. From 2011 onward, the winner of the Championship Final is promoted to the Premiership, replacing that league&#x27;s bottom team.

Because the 2011 season ran up against that year&#x27;s Rugby World Cup in New Zealand, the competition window was truncated, with only the top two teams in each division advancing to the final match. The Shaughnessy finals series returned to both divisions in 2012, and is currently used in non-World Cup years.

==== Heartland Championship ====
In the Heartland Championship, teams play for two distinct trophies — the more prestigious Meads Cup and the Lochore Cup. The 12 Heartland Championship teams are divided into two pools for round-robin play in Round One, with the top three in each pool advancing to the Meads Cup and the bottom three dropping to the Lochore Cup.

Round Two in both the Meads and Lochore Cups is an abbreviated round-robin tournament, with each team playing only the teams it did not play in Round One. The top four teams in the Meads Cup pool at the end of Round Two advance to the Meads Cup semifinals; the same applies for the Lochore Cup contestants.

The semifinals of both cups are seeded 1 vs 4 and 2 vs 3, with the higher seeds earning home field advantage. The semifinal winners advance to their respective cup final, hosted by the higher surviving seed.

=== Super Rugby ===
Throughout the pre-2011 history of Super Rugby—both in the Super 12 and Super 14 formats—the competition&#x27;s organiser, SANZAR (renamed SANZAAR in 2016), held a Shaughnessy playoff involving the top four teams. The top two teams on the league ladder each hosted a semifinal, with the top surviving team hosting the final.

In May 2009, SANZAR announced that it would adopt an expanded playoff when the competition added a new Australian team for the 2011 season. Through 2015, the Super Rugby playoff involved six teams—the winners of each of three conferences (Australia, New Zealand and South Africa conferences), plus the three non-winners with the most competition points without regard to conference affiliation.

The top two conference winners received a first-round bye; each played at home against the winner of an elimination match involving two of the four other playoff teams. As in the previous system, the final was hosted by the top surviving seed.

Further expansion of the competition in 2016 to 18 teams, with one extra entry from South Africa and new teams based in Argentina and Japan, saw the playoff bracket expand to eight teams. The teams were split into African and Australasian groups, with the Argentine and Japanese teams joining the African group. Each group in turn was divided into two conferences (Australia, New Zealand, Africa 1, Africa 2). Conference winners received the top four playoff seeds, and were joined by the top three remaining Australasian teams and the top remaining team from the African group on table points, again without regard to conference affiliation. The higher seed still hosted all playoff matches, including the final.

With the contraction of the league to 15 teams for 2018, with one Australian and two South African teams being axed, the playoff format changed yet again. The number of conferences was reduced from four to three—Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, with the Argentine team joining the South Africa conference and the Japanese team joining the Australia conference. The playoff will remain at eight teams, with the three conference winners joined by five &quot;wildcards&quot;, specifically the top remaining teams without regard to conference affiliation. The conference winners and the top wildcard will host quarterfinals, with all remaining matches hosted by the higher seed.

<text>Hrungnir (Old Norse: , &#x27;brawler&#x27;) is a jötunn in Norse mythology. He is described as made of stone and is ultimately killed in a duel with the thunder god Thor.

Prior to his demise, Hrungnir engaged in a wager with Odin in which Odin stakes his head on his horse, Sleipnir, being faster than Hrungnir&#x27;s steed Gullfaxi. During the race, which Sleipnir wins, Hrungnir enters Ásgard, and there becomes drunk and abusive. After they grow weary of him, the gods call on the god Thor to battle Hrungnir. He is slain by Thor&#x27;s hammer Mjölnir.

Hrungnir is comparable to the Hurrian Ullikummi, a stone-giant who grew so quickly that he reached the heavens. He was slain by the thunder-god Teshub who is equivalent also to the Luwian Tarḫunz and Hittite Tarḫunna.

== Name ==
The Old Norse name Hrungnir has been translated as &#x27;brawler&#x27;, or as &#x27;big person, strong man&#x27;, &#x27;noise-maker&#x27;.

== Attestations ==

=== Prose Edda ===
In &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (The Language of Poetry), written in the 13th century CE by Snorri Sturluson, the god Odin is portrayed as riding his horse Sleipnir into Jötunheim when he meets the jötunn Hrungnir, mounted on his horse Gullfaxi (Gold-mane). They have a short verbal exchange about the quality of their respective horse, during which Odin states his willingness to bet his head (his life) on the result. Hrungnir declares that he has &quot;a horse that must be much longe-paced, it [is] called Gullfaxi.&quot; Then Hrungnir gets angry, leaps upon his horse and follows Odin in a race towards Ásgard, &quot;intending to pay him back for his boasting&quot;. Although Sleipnir turns out to be the fastest horse, the race is very close and Odin is not able to keep Hrungnir out of the place of gods, Ásgard. There, the Æsir (gods) invites Hrungnir for a drink. 

Hrungnir becomes so intoxicated that he threatens to remove &quot;Val-hall and take it to Giantland&quot; and to &quot;bury Asgard and kill all the gods&quot;, besides the beautiful goddesses Freyja and Sif whom he intends to keep for himself. The gods then call the thunder-god Thor to expel the unwanted guest, and the two of them agree to a duel. Thor arrives at the appointment with his servant Þjálfi, and Hrungnir is escorted by Mokkurkálfi (&#x27;Mist-calf&#x27;), a mighty creature made of clay, and with the heart of a mare. But the giant Mokkurkálfi is said to be &quot;quite terrified&quot; and he &quot;wets himself&quot; at the sight of Thor, whereas Hrungnir, whose heart, head and shield appear to be made of stone, is &quot;standing unguardedly&quot;. After the fight is over and Hrungnir eventually defeated, Thor turns out to be stuck under the jötunn&#x27;s leg. Thor&#x27;s three-year-old son Magni is the only one able to lift up the gigantic leg among all the present Æsir (gods). As a reward, Thor offers him Hrungnir&#x27;s horse Gullfaxi.
=== Skaldic poetry ===
&quot;Haustlöng&quot; (Autumn-long, ), a poem written by the early 10th-century skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir and from which Snorri claims to derive his own account, depicts Thor&#x27;s journey to the duel while the cosmological elements are reacting: the &quot;ground all low&quot; (earth) is &quot;battered with hail&quot; and &quot;all the hawk&#x27;s sanctuaries&quot; (the skies) are in flame; &quot;Svolnir’s widow&quot; (Odin&#x27;s consort, Jörð [Earth]) practically split apart&quot;. Then Hrungnir and Thor fight by hurling their weapons at each other (the jötunn&#x27;s whetstone and Thor&#x27;s hammer), and the poem alludes to the removal of the piece of whetstone from Thor&#x27;s head.

Compared to Snorri&#x27;s account, Þjóðólfr emphasizes more on Thor&#x27;s journey to the battle, escorted by noise and flames, while Snorri makes relatively little of it and also describes Hrungnir&#x27;s journey. Thor&#x27;s servant Þjálfi and Hrungnir&#x27;s clay-made giant Mokkurkálfi are absent from Þjóðólfr’s 10th-century version.

In &quot;Ragnarsdrápa&quot;, the 9th-century skald Bragi Boddason mentions &quot;Hrungnir&#x27;s skull-splitter&quot;.
Bragi also refers to the shield as &quot;Hrungnir&#x27;s sole-blade&quot; and refers to Hrungnir as the &quot;thief of Þrúðr&quot;, the daughter of Thor.
== Theories ==
According to scholar John Lindow, the reaction of cosmological elements (the earth is cracking, the sky burning) during Thor&#x27;s journey to the battle, as told in &quot;Haustlöng&quot;, &quot;suggests the cosmic nature of Thor’s duel with Hrungnir&quot;. The motivation for the duel, which is not mentioned by 10th-century skald Þjóðólfr in &quot;Haustlöng&quot;, could have originally been the abduction of Thor&#x27;s daughter Þrúðr by the stone-made giant Hrungnir, as suggested by an earlier kenning by 9th-century skald Bragi: &#x27;leaf of the soles of the thief of Þrúðr [SHIELD]&#x27; (&quot;blað ilja Þrúðar þjófs&quot;).

Georges Dumézil argues that the story involves the initiation of Þjálfi by Thor in the killing of the clay-made monster.

<doc id="74681" wikidata="Q1506487" url="?curid=74681" title="Palestinian refugees">
<text>Palestinian refugees are citizens of Mandatory Palestine, and their descendants, who fled or were expelled from their country, village or house over the course of the 1948 Palestine war and during the 1967 Six-Day War. Most Palestinian refugees live in or near 68 Palestinian refugee camps across Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. In 2019 more than 5.6 million Palestinian refugees were registered with the United Nations.

In 1949, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) defined Palestinian refugees to refer to the original &quot;Palestine refugees&quot; as well as their patrilineal descendants. However, UNRWA&#x27;s assistance is limited to Palestine refugees residing in UNRWA&#x27;s areas of operation in the Palestinian Territories, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.

As of 2019, more than 5.6 million Palestinians were registered with UNRWA as refugees, of which more than 1.5 million live in UNRWA-run camps. The term &quot;Palestine refugee&quot; does not include internally displaced Palestinians, who became Israeli citizens, or displaced Palestinian Jews. According to some estimates, as many as 1,050,000–1,380,000 people, who descend from displaced people of Mandatory Palestine are not registered under UNRWA or UNHCR mandates.

During the 1948 Palestine War, around 85% of the population or 700,000 Palestinian Arabs, living in the area that became Israel fled or were expelled from their homes, to the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and to the countries of Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. They, and their descendants who are also entitled to registration, are assisted by UNWRA in 59 registered camps, ten of which were established in the aftermath of the Six-Day War in 1967 to cope with the new wave of displaced Palestinians. They are also the world&#x27;s oldest unsettled refugee population, having been under the ongoing governance of Arab states following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the refugee populations of the West Bank under Israeli governance since the Six-Day War and Palestinian administration since 1994, and the Gaza Strip administered by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) since 2007.

Today, the largest number of refugees, over 2,000,000, live in Jordan, where by 2009 over 90% of UNWRA-registered Palestinian refugees had acquired full citizenship rights. This figure consists almost exclusively of West Bank–descended Palestinians; however, as of December 2021, Palestinians with roots in the Gaza Strip are also still kept in legal limbo. In 2021, Jordanian politician Jawad Anani estimated that roughly 50% of Jordan&#x27;s population had West Bank–Palestinian roots. Another approximately 2,000,000 refugees live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, under Israeli occupation and blockade. Approximately 500,000 refugees live in each of Syria and Lebanon respectively, albeit under very different circumstances. While Palestinian refugees in Syria maintained their stateless status, the Syrian government afforded them the same economic and social rights enjoyed by Syrian citizens; they are also drafted into the Armed Forces despite not being citizens. Citizenship or legal residency in some host countries is denied, most notably for the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, where the absorption of Palestinians would upset a delicate confessional balance. For the refugees themselves, these situations mean they have reduced rights: no right to vote, limited property rights and access to social services, among other things. 

On 11 December 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations (UNGA) adopted Resolution 194 which affirmed the Palestinians right to return to their homes.

==Definitions==
===UNRWA===
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is an organ of the United Nations created exclusively for the purpose of aiding those displaced by the Arab–Israeli conflict, with an annual budget of approximately $600 million. It defines a &quot;Palestine refugee&quot; as a person &quot;whose normal place of residence was Mandatory Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948, who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli conflict&quot;. The Six-Day War of 1967 generated a new wave of Palestinian refugees who could not be included in the original UNRWA definition. From 1991, the UN General Assembly has adopted an annual resolution allowing the 1967 refugees within the UNRWA mandate. UNRWA aids all &quot;those living in its area of operations who meet its working definition, who are registered with the Agency and who need assistance&quot; and those who first became refugees as a result of the Six-Day War, regardless whether they reside in areas designated as Palestine refugee camps or in other permanent communities.

A Palestine refugee camp is &quot;a plot of land placed at the disposal of UNRWA by the host government to accommodate Palestine refugees and to set up facilities to cater to their needs&quot;. About 1.4 million of registered Palestine refugees, approximately one-third, live in the 58 UNRWA-recognised refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The UNRWA definition does not cover final status.

Registered descendants of UNRWA Palestine refugees, like &quot;Nansen passport&quot; and &quot;Certificate of Eligibility&quot; holders (the documents issued to those displaced by World War II) or like UNHCR refugees, inherit the same Palestine refugee status as their male parent. According to UNRWA, &quot;The descendants of Palestine refugee males, including adopted children, are also eligible for registration.&quot;

The UNHCR had counted 90,000 refugees by 2014.

===Palestinian definitions===
Palestinians make several distinctions relating to Palestinian refugees. The 1948 refugees and their descendants are broadly defined as &quot;refugees&quot; (&quot;laji&#x27;un&quot;). The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), especially those who have returned and form part of the PNA, but also Palestinian refugee camp residents in Lebanon, repudiate this term, since it implies being a passive victim, and prefer the autonym of &#x27;returnees&#x27; (&quot;a&#x27;idun&quot;). Those who left since 1967, and their descendants, are called &quot;nazihun&quot; or &quot;displaced persons&quot;, though many may also descend from the 1948 group.

==Origin of the Palestine refugees==


Most Palestinian refugees have retained their refugee status and continue to reside in refugee camps, including within the State of Palestine in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. Their descendants form a sizable portion of the Palestinian diaspora.

===Palestinian refugees from the 1948 Palestine War===

During the 1948 Palestine War, some 700,000 Palestinian Arabs or 85% of the Palestinian Arab population of territories that became Israel fled or were expelled from their homes. Some 30,000 to 50,000 were alive by 2012.

The causes and responsibilities of the exodus are a matter of controversy among historians and commentators of the conflict. While historians agree on most of the events of the period, there remains disagreement as to whether the exodus was the result of a plan designed before or during the war or was an unintended consequence of the war. According to historian Benny Morris, the expulsion was planned and encouraged by the Zionist leadership.

According to Morris, between December 1947 and March 1948, around 100,000 Palestine Arabs fled. Among them were many from the higher and middle classes from the cities, who left voluntarily, expecting to return when the Arab states won the war and took control of the country. When the Haganah and then the emerging Israeli army (Israel Defense Forces or IDF) went on the defensive, between April and July, a further 250,000 to 300,000 Palestinian Arabs left or were expelled, mainly from the towns of Haifa, Tiberias, Beit-Shean, Safed, Jaffa and Acre, which lost more than 90 percent of their Arab inhabitants. Expulsions took place in many towns and villages, particularly along the Tel Aviv–Jerusalem road and in Eastern Galilee. About 50,000–70,000 inhabitants of Lydda and Ramle were expelled towards Ramallah by the IDF during Operation Danny, and most others during operations of the IDF in its rear areas. During Operation Dekel, the Arabs of Nazareth and South Galilee were allowed to remain in their homes. Today they form the core of the Arab Israeli population. From October to November 1948, the IDF launched Operation Yoav to remove Egyptian forces from the Negev and Operation Hiram to remove the Arab Liberation Army from North Galilee during which at least nine events named massacres of Arabs were carried out by IDF soldiers. These events generated an exodus of 200,000 to 220,000 Palestinian Arabs. Here, Arabs fled fearing atrocities or were expelled if they had not fled. After the war, from 1948 to 1950, the IDF resettled around 30,000 to 40,000 Arabs from the borderlands of the new Israeli state.

===Palestinian refugees from Six-Day War===

As a result of the Six-Day War, around 280,000 to 325,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from the territories won in the Six-Day War by Israel, including the demolished Palestinian villages of Imwas, Yalo, Bayt Nuba, Surit, Beit Awwa, Beit Mirsem, Shuyukh, Jiftlik, Agarith and Huseirat, and the &quot;emptying&quot; of the refugee camps of Aqabat Jabr and Ein as-Sultan.

===Palestinian exodus from Kuwait (Gulf War)===

The Palestinian exodus from Kuwait took place during and after the Gulf War. During the Gulf War, more than 200,000 Palestinians voluntarily fled Kuwait during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait due to harassment and intimidation by Iraqi security forces, in addition to getting fired from work by Iraqi authority figures in Kuwait. After the Gulf War, Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait in 1991. Kuwait&#x27;s policy, which led to this exodus, was a response to alignment of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) with the dictator Saddam Hussein, who had earlier invaded Kuwait.

Prior to the Gulf War, Palestinians numbered 400,000 out of Kuwait&#x27;s population of 2.2 million. The Palestinians who fled Kuwait were Jordanian citizens. In 2013, there were 280,000 Jordanian citizens of Palestinian origin in Kuwait. In 2012, 80,000 Palestinians (without Jordanian citizenship) lived in Kuwait. In total, there are 360,000 Palestinians in Kuwait as of 2012–2013.

===Palestinian refugees as part of the Syrian refugee crisis===

Many Palestinians in Syria were displaced as a result of the Syrian Civil War starting in 2011. By October 2013, 235,000 Palestinians had been displaced within Syria itself and 60,000 (alongside 2.2 million Syrians) had fled the country. By March 2019, the UHCR estimated that 120,000 Palestine refugees had fled Syria since 2011, primarily to Lebanon and Jordan, but also Turkey and further afield.

There were reports that Jordan and Lebanon had turned away Palestinian refugees attempting to flee the humanitarian crises in Syria. By 2013, Jordan had absorbed 126,000 Syrian refugees but Palestinians fleeing Syria were placed in a separate refugee camp under stricter conditions and banned from entering Jordanian cities.

Palestinian refugees from Syria also sought asylum in Europe, especially Sweden, which had offered asylum to any Syrian refugees that managed to reach its territory, albeit with some conditions. Many did so by finding their way to Egypt and making the journey by sea. In October 2013, the PFLP-GC claimed that some 23,000 Palestinian refugees from the Yarmouk Camp alone had immigrated to Sweden.

===Palestinian refugees during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war===

As of January 2024, more than 85% of Palestinians in Gaza, approximately 1.9 million people, were internally displaced during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. Some wounded Palestinians from Gaza were allowed to leave for Egypt.

==Refugee statistics==
The number of Palestine refugees varies depending on the source. For 1948–49 refugees, for example, the Israeli government suggests a number as low as 520,000 as opposed to 850,000 by their Palestinian counterparts. As of January 2015, UNRWA cites 5,149,742 registered refugees in total, of whom 1,603,018 are registered in camps.

The number of UNRWA registered Palestine refugees by country or territory in January 2015 were as follows:
===Gaza Strip===

As of January 2015, the Gaza Strip has 8 UNRWA refugee camps with 560,964 Palestinian refugees, and 1,276,929 registered refugees in total, out of a population of 1,816,379.

===West Bank===
As of January 2015, the West Bank has 19 UNRWA refugee camps with 228,560 Palestinian refugees, and 774,167 registered refugees in total, out of a population of 2,345,107.

===Jordan===

&quot;More than 2 million registered Palestine refugees live in Jordan. Most Palestine refugees in Jordan, but not all, have full citizenship&quot;, following Jordan&#x27;s annexation and occupation of the West Bank. The percentage of Palestinian refugees living in refugee camps to those who settled outside the camps is the lowest of all UNRWA fields of operations. Palestine refugees are allowed access to public services and healthcare, as a result, refugee camps are becoming more like poor city suburbs than refugee camps. Most Palestine refugees moved out of the camps to other parts of the country and the number of people registered in refugee camps as of January 2015 is 385,418, who live in ten refugee camps. This caused UNRWA to reduce the budget allocated to Palestine refugee camps in Jordan. Former UNRWA chief-attorney James G. Lindsay wrote in 2009: &quot;In Jordan, where 2 million Palestinian refugees live, all but 167,000 have citizenship, and are fully eligible for government services including education and health care.&quot; Lindsay suggests that eliminating services to refugees whose needs are subsidized by Jordan &quot;would reduce the refugee list by 40%&quot;.

Palestinians who moved from the West Bank (whether refugees or not) to Jordan, are issued yellow-ID cards to distinguish them from the Palestinians of the &quot;official 10 refugee camps&quot; in Jordan. From 1988 to 2012, thousands of those yellow-ID card Palestinians had their Jordanian citizenship revoked. Human Rights Watch estimated that about 2,700 Palestinians were stripped of Jordanian nationality between 2004 and 2008. In 2012, the Jordanian government promised to stop revoking the citizenship of some Palestinians, and restored citizenship to 4,500 Palestinians who had previously lost it.

===Lebanon===

100,000 Palestinians fled to Lebanon because of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and were not allowed to return. As of January 2015, there were 452,669 registered refugees in Lebanon.

In a 2007 study, Amnesty International denounced the &quot;appalling social and economic condition&quot; of Palestinians in Lebanon. Until 2005, Palestinians were forbidden to work in over 70 jobs because they do not have Lebanese citizenship, but this was later reduced to around 20 as of 2007 after liberalization laws. In 2010, Palestinians were granted the same rights to work as other foreigners in the country.

Lebanon gave citizenship to about 50,000 Christian Palestinian refugees during the 1950s and 1960s. In the mid-1990s, about 60,000 Shiite Muslim refugees were granted citizenship. This caused a protest from Maronite authorities, leading to citizenship being given to all Christian refugees who were not already citizens.

In the 2010s, many Palestinian refugees in Lebanon began immigrating to Europe, both legally and illegally, as part of the European migrant crisis, due to a deterioration in living conditions there as part of the Syrian civil war. In December 2015, sources told &quot;Al Jazeera&quot; that thousands of Palestinians were fleeing to Europe by way of Turkey, with about 4,000 having fled the Ain al-Hilweh camp alone in recent months. Many were reaching Germany, with others going to Russia, Sweden, Belgium, and Norway. A census completed in January 2018 found that only around 175,000 Palestinian refugees were living in Lebanon, as opposed to previous UNRWA figures which put the number at between 400,000 and 500,000, as well as other estimates that placed the number between 260,000 and 280,000.

According to writer and researcher Mudar Zahran, a Jordanian of Palestinian heritage, the media chose to deliberately ignore the conditions of the Palestinians living in Lebanese refugee camps, and that the &quot;tendency to blame Israel for everything&quot; has provided Arab leaders with an excuse to deliberately ignore the human rights of the Palestinian in their countries.

===Syria===

Syria had 528,616 registered Palestinian refugees in January 2015. There were 9 UNRWA refugee camps with 178,666 official Palestinian refugees.

As a result of the Syrian civil war, large numbers of Palestinian refugees fled Syria to Europe as part of the European migrant crisis, and to other Arab countries. In September 2015, a Palestinian official said that only 200,000 Palestinian refugees were left in Syria, with 100,000 Palestinian refugees from Syria in Europe and the remainder in other Arab countries.

===Saudi Arabia===
An estimated 240,000 Palestinians are living in Saudi Arabia.

===Iraq===

There were 34,000 Palestinian refugees living in Iraq prior to the Iraq War. In the aftermath of the war, the majority fled to neighboring Jordan and Syria, or were killed. Thousands lived as internally displaced persons within Iraq or were stranded in camps along Iraq&#x27;s borders with Jordan and Syria, as no country in the region would accept them, and lived in temporary camps along the no man&#x27;s land in the border zones.

===Other countries===
India agreed to take in 165 refugees, with the first group arriving in March 2006. Generally, they were unable to find work in India as they spoke only Arabic though some found employment with UNHCR&#x27;s non-governmental partners. All of them were provided with free access to public hospitals. Of the 165 refugees, 137 of them later found clearance for resettlement in Sweden. In November 2006, 54 were granted asylum in Canada, and in 2007, some 200 were accepted for resettlement in Sweden and Iceland, and Brazil agreed to take 100.

In 2009, significant numbers of these refugees were allowed to resettle abroad. More than 1,000 were accepted by various countries in Europe and South America, and an additional 1,350 were cleared for resettlement in the United States. Another 68 were allowed to resettle in Australia. However, the majority of Palestine refugees strongly oppose resettlement and much rather want to return to their homes in the region of Palestine.

==Positions==

On 11 December 1948 the United Nations General Assembly discussed Bernadotte&#x27;s report and passed a resolution: &quot;that refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbour should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date.&quot; This General Assembly article 11 of Resolution 194 has been annually re-affirmed.

===Israeli views===
The Jewish Agency promised to the UN before 1948 that Palestinian Arabs would become full citizens of the State of Israel, and the Israeli declaration of independence invited the Arab inhabitants of Israel to &quot;full and equal citizenship&quot;. In practice, Israel does not grant citizenship to the refugees, as it does to those Arabs who continue to reside in its borders. The 1947 Partition Plan determined citizenship based on residency, such that Arabs and Jews residing in Palestine but not in Jerusalem would obtain citizenship in the state in which they are resident. Professor of Law at Boston University Susan Akram, Omar Barghouti and Ilan Pappé have argued that Palestinian refugees from the envisioned Jewish State were entitled to normal Israeli citizenship based on laws of state succession.

Following the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel gained control over a substantial number of refugee camps in the territories it captured from Egypt and Jordan. The Israeli government attempted to resettle them permanently by initiating a subsidized &quot;build-your-own home&quot; program. Israel provided land for refugees who chose to participate; the Palestinians bought building materials on credit and built their own houses, usually with friends. Israel provided the new neighborhoods with necessary services, such as schools and sewers. The United Nations General Assembly passed Resolutions 31/15 and 34/52, which condemned the program as a violation of the refugees&#x27; &quot;inalienable right of return&quot;, and called upon Israel to stop the program. Thousands of refugees were resettled into various neighborhoods, but the program was suspended due to pressure from the PLO.

===Arab states===

Most Palestinian refugees live either in the West Bank or Gaza Strip, or the three original &quot;host countries&quot; of Jordan, Lebanon and Syria who unwillingly accepted the first wave of refugees in 1948; these refugees are supported by UNRWA. The small number of refugees who settled in Egypt or Iraq were supported directly by those countries&#x27; governments. Over the last seven decades, a number of refugees have migrated to other Arab states, particularly the Arab states of the Gulf, primarily as economic migrants.

Arab states&#x27; view of Palestinian refugees has varied over time. Arab governments have often supported the refugees in the name of Arab unity, or because they viewed the Palestinians as an important source of skilled human capital to support their economic development. However, Arab governments have also frequently &quot;despised&quot; the Palestinian refugees – either viewing them as a threat to demographic balance (as in Lebanon), or because of the &quot;political message of freedom and emancipation that their ‘Palestinian-ness’ carried&quot;, or else because in some countries&#x27; history Palestinians have been &quot;somewhat associated with strife and unrest&quot;.

Palestinian refugees have taken citizenship in other Arab states, most notably in Jordan. However, the conferring of citizenship is a sensitive topic, as &quot;it is often perceived as allowing Israel to evade its responsibility towards the refugees&quot;. On 17 October 2023 during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Jordan&#x27;s king Abdullah warned against pushing refugees into Egypt or Jordan, adding that the humanitarian situation must to be dealt with inside Gaza and the West Bank: &quot;That is a red line, because I think that is the plan by certain of the usual suspects to try and create de facto issues on the ground. No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt.&quot;

Tashbih Sayyed, a fellow of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, criticized Arab nations of violating human rights and making the children and grandchildren of Palestinian refugees second class citizens in Lebanon, Syria, or the Gulf States, and said that the UNRWA Palestine refugees &quot;cling to the illusion that defeating the Jews will restore their dignity&quot;.

===Palestinian views===
Most Palestine refugees claim a Palestinian right of return. In lack of an own country, their claim is based on Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which declares that &quot;Everyone has the right to leave any country including his own, and to return to his country&quot;, although it has been argued that the term only applies to citizens or nationals of that country. Although all Arab League members at the time (1948) – Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen – voted against the resolution, they also cite the article 11 of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194, which &quot;Resolves that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return [...].&quot; However it is currently a matter of dispute whether Resolution 194 referred only to the estimated 50,000 remaining Palestine refugees from the 1948 Palestine War, or additionally to their UNRWA-registered 4,950,000 descendants. The Palestinian National Authority supports this claim, and has been prepared to negotiate its implementation at the various peace talks. Both Fatah and Hamas hold a strong position for a claimed &quot;right of return&quot;, with Fatah being prepared to give ground on the issue while Hamas is not.

However, a report in Lebanon&#x27;s Daily Star newspaper in which Abdullah Muhammad Ibrahim Abdullah, the Palestinian ambassador to Lebanon and the chairman of the Palestinian Legislative Council&#x27;s Political and Parliamentary Affairs committees, said the proposed future Palestinian state would not be issuing Palestinian passports to UNRWA Palestine refugees – even refugees living in the West Bank and Gaza.

An independent poll by Khalil Shikaki was conducted in 2003 with 4,500 Palestinian refugee families of Gaza, West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon. It showed that the majority (54%) would accept a financial compensation and a place to live in West Bank or Gaza in place of returning to the exact place in modern-day Israel where they or their ancestors lived (this possibility of settlement is contemplated in the Resolution 194). Only 10% said they would live in Israel if given the option. The other third said they would prefer to live in other countries, or rejected the terms described. However, the poll has been criticized as &quot;methodologically problematic&quot; and &quot;rigged&quot;. In 2003, nearly a hundred refugee organizations and NGOs in Lebanon denounced Shikaki&#x27;s survey, as no local organization was aware of its implementation in Lebanon.

In a 2 January 2005 opinion poll conducted by the Palestinian Association for Human Rights involving Palestinian refugees in Lebanon:
* 96% refused to give up their right of return
* 3% answered contrary
* 1% did not answer

==The Oslo Accords==
Upon signing the Oslo Accords in 1993, Israel, the EU and the US recognized PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. In return, Yasser Arafat recognized the State of Israel and renounced terrorism. At the time, the accords were celebrated as a historic breakthrough. In accordance with these agreements, the Palestinian refugees began to be governed by an autonomous Palestinian Authority, and the parties agreed to negotiate the permanent status of the refugees, as early as 1996. However, events have halted the phasing process and made the likelihood of a future sovereign Palestinian state uncertain. In another development, a rift developed between Fatah in the West-Bank and Hamas in Gaza after Hamas won the 2006 elections. Among other differences, Fatah officially recognizes the Oslo Accords with Israel, whereas Hamas does not.

===United States===
As of May 2012, the United States Senate Appropriations Committee approved a definition of a Palestine refugee to include only those original Palestine refugees who were actually displaced between June 1946 and May 1948, resulting in an estimated number of 30,000.

<doc id="74685" wikidata="Q457906" url="?curid=74685" title="J. Presper Eckert">
<text>John Adam Presper &quot;Pres&quot; Eckert Jr. (April 9, 1919 – June 3, 1995) was an American electrical engineer and computer pioneer. With John Mauchly, he designed the first general-purpose electronic digital computer (ENIAC), presented the first course in computing topics (the Moore School Lectures), founded the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation, and designed the first commercial computer in the U.S., the UNIVAC, which incorporated Eckert&#x27;s invention of the mercury delay-line memory.

==Education==
Eckert was born in Philadelphia to Ethel M. Hallowell, who came from an old Philadelphia Quaker family, and John Eckert, a wealthy real estate developer of Swiss German and Alsatian descent. He was raised in a large house in Philadelphia&#x27;s Germantown section. During elementary school, he was driven by chauffeur to William Penn Charter School, and in high school joined the Engineer&#x27;s Club of Philadelphia and spent afternoons at the electronics laboratory of television inventor Philo Farnsworth in Chestnut Hill. He placed second in the country on the math portion of the College Board examination.

Eckert initially enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Wharton School to study business at the encouragement of his parents, but in 1937 transferred to Penn&#x27;s Moore School of Electrical Engineering. In 1940, at age 21, Eckert applied for his first patent, &quot;Light Modulating Method and Apparatus&quot;. At the Moore School, Eckert participated in research on radar timing, made improvements to the speed and precision of the Moore School&#x27;s differential analyzer, and in 1941 assisted in teaching a summer course in electronics under the Engineering, Science, and Management War Training (ESMWT) offered through the Moore School by the United States Department of War.

==Development of ENIAC==
John Mauchly, then chairman of the physics department of nearby Ursinus College, was a student in the summer electronics course, and the following fall secured a teaching position at the Moore School. Mauchly&#x27;s proposal for building an electronic digital computer using vacuum tubes, many times faster and more accurate than the differential analyzer for computing ballistics tables for artillery, caught the interest of the Moore School&#x27;s Army liaison, Lieutenant Herman Goldstine, and on April 9, 1943, was formally presented in a meeting at Aberdeen Proving Ground to director Colonel Leslie Simon, Oswald Veblen, and others. A contract was awarded for Moore School&#x27;s construction of the proposed computing machine, which would be named ENIAC, and Eckert was made the project&#x27;s chief engineer. ENIAC was completed in late 1945 and was unveiled to the public in February 1946.

==Entrepreneurship==
Both Eckert and Mauchly left the Moore School in March 1946 over a dispute involving assignment of claims on intellectual property developed at the University. In that year, the University of Pennsylvania adopted a new patent policy to protect the intellectual purity of the research it sponsored, which would have required Eckert and Mauchly to assign all their patents to the University had they stayed beyond March.

Eckert and Mauchly&#x27;s agreement with the University of Pennsylvania was that Eckert and Mauchly retained the patent rights to the ENIAC but the University could license it to the government and non-profit organizations. The University wanted to change the agreement so that they would also have commercial rights to the patent.

In the following months, Eckert and Mauchly started up the Electronic Control Company which built the Binary Automatic Computer (BINAC). One of the major advances of this machine, which was used from August 1950, was that data was stored on magnetic tape. The Electronic Control Company soon became the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation, and it received an order from the National Bureau of Standards to build the Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC). Eckert was awarded the Howard N. Potts Medal in 1949. In 1950, Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation ran into financial troubles and was acquired by Remington Rand Corporation. The UNIVAC I was finished on December 21, 1950.

In 1968, &quot;For pioneering and continuing contributions in creating, developing, and improving the high-speed electronic digital computer&quot;, Eckert was awarded the National Medal of Science.

==Later career==
Eckert remained with Remington Rand and became an executive within the company. He continued with Remington Rand as it merged with the Burroughs Corporation to become Unisys in 1986. In 1989, Eckert retired from Unisys but continued to act as a consultant for the company. He died of leukemia in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.

In 2002, he was inducted, posthumously, into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

==&quot;Eckert architecture&quot;==
Eckert believed that the widely adopted term &quot;von Neumann architecture&quot; should properly be known as the &quot;Eckert architecture&quot;, since the stored-program concept central to the von Neumann architecture had already been developed at the Moore School by the time von Neumann arrived on the scene in 1944–1945. Eckert&#x27;s contention that von Neumann improperly took credit for devising the stored-program computer architecture was supported by Jean Bartik, one of the original ENIAC programmers.

<text>Margaret Avison, (April 23, 1918 – July 31, 2007) was a Canadian poet who twice won Canada&#x27;s Governor General&#x27;s Award and has also won its Griffin Poetry Prize. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, &quot;Her work has been praised for the beauty of its language and images.&quot;

==Early life and education==

Avison, the daughter of a Methodist minister, was born in Galt, Ontario, in 1918. She moved to Regina, Saskatchewan, in 1920, and Calgary, Alberta, a few years later. Her family moved again, in 1930, to Toronto, Ontario. She attended Alma College, located in St. Thomas, Ontario, ca. 1935. As a teenager she was hospitalized for anorexia.

She attended Victoria College at the University of Toronto, entering in 1936 and getting her B.A. in 1940 (and returning to pick up her M.A. in 1965). Before she finished her B.A. she was a published poet; the poem &quot;Gatineau&quot; appeared in the Canadian Poetry Magazine in 1939. Additionally, she began publishing poetry in the college magazine, Acta Victoriana.

==Career==
Besides writing poetry, Avison worked a variety of other jobs, such as working as a file clerk, proofreader, and editor. She also worked in the Registrar&#x27;s Office and Library at the University of Toronto. Avison worked as a librarian, was a social worker at the Presbyterian Church Mission in Toronto, and taught at Scarborough College. She wrote most of her poetry in her spare time, and chose paying jobs which left her time to write. She didn&#x27;t apply for a Canada Council grant.

In 1951 Avison&#x27;s junior high school textbook, &quot;History of Ontario&quot;, was published.

As mentioned previously, Avison&#x27;s poem &quot;Gatineau&quot; appeared in &quot;Canadian Poetry Magazine&quot; in 1939. In 1943, anthologist A.J.M. Smith included her poetry in his &quot;Book of Canadian Poetry&quot;. (In her autobiography, she mentions a &quot;chaste skinny dip&quot; with Smith.)

In 1956 Avison received a Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Grant; she spent eight months in the United States and was able to attend classes at the universities of Chicago and Indiana. She ghostwrote a book entitled &quot;A Doctor&#x27;s Memoir&quot; and wrote her first book of poetry, &quot;Winter Sun.&quot; It was published in 1960 and won the Governor General&#x27;s Award.

Avison was moved by the Hungarian Uprising of 1956 and translated eight Hungarian poems that then appeared in &quot;The Plough and The Pen&quot; - this brought recognition to various twentieth century Hungarian poets. Avison successfully completed her M.A. at the University of Toronto, but while she began a Ph.D. she did not matriculate as she did not write a thesis.

Avison converted to Christianity (from agnosticism) in 1963. She wrote about that experience in her second book of poetry, &quot;The Dumbfounding&quot; (1966).

Avison taught at Scarborough Hall, University of Toronto, between 1966 and 1968, and also volunteered at Presbyterian mission named Evangel Hall during this time. Avison was writer-in-residence at the University of Western Ontario for eight months in 1973. From 1973 to 1978 she worked in the archives division of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). In 1978 she joined Toronto&#x27;s Mustard Seed Mission as a secretary, and worked there until her retirement in 1986.

Avison became an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1984.

Her fourth collection of poems, &quot;No Time&quot;, came out in 1990, and won her a second Governor General&#x27;s Award.

In 2003 Avison&#x27;s &quot;Concrete and Wild Carrot&quot; won the Griffin Poetry Prize. &quot;Lauding Avison as &#x27;a national treasure,&#x27; Griffin Poetry Prize judges praised the &#x27;sublimity&#x27; and &#x27;humility&#x27; of her poetry -- which they described as &#x27;some of the most humane, sweet and profound poetry of our time.&#x27;&quot;

Avison was honoured for her contributions to Canadian literature by various honorary degrees: Acadia University (1983), York University (1985), and Victoria University (1988).

Margaret Avison died in Toronto on July 31, 2007, age 89, from undisclosed causes.

==Writing==
Avison can be considered a spiritual or metaphysical poet; &quot;her work is often described by reviewers as introspective, observant, and deeply spiritual.&quot; &quot;Many critics compare her work to the great metaphysical poets of the 17th century.&quot;

&quot;The Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; describes her as a &quot;Canadian poet who revealed the progress of an interior spiritual journey in her three successive volumes of poetry,&quot; referring to her first three books, &quot;Winter Sun&quot;, &quot;The Dumbfounding&quot;, and &quot;sunblue&quot;.

With &quot;Winter Sun&quot;, &quot;Avison established herself as a difficult and introspective poet given to private images and subtle shadings of emotion that challenge and frustrate the reader&quot; (says &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia)&quot;. &quot;These complexities in her writing conceal a deeply religious and vulnerable sensibility.&quot; &quot;In this volume the poet&#x27;s subject matter varies from environmental destruction and the plight of the poor to metaphysical ponderings and playful explorations of language. Avison&#x27;s emphasis is on looking at the familiar in new and thought-provoking ways.&quot; &quot;One of Avison&#x27;s principal concerns in &quot;Winter Sun&quot; is perception, and she consistently emphasizes looking at the familiar in new and thought-provoking ways. Ernest H. Redekop has argued that &#x27;there is a profound sense in Avison&#x27;s poems that the world must not be forced into ordinary limits of sight and articulation.&#x27; In the poem &quot;Perspective,&quot; for instance, Avison attacks linear perspective.&quot;

&quot;The Dumbfounding&quot; was &quot;a more accessible record of spiritual discovery, and a more revealing account of the unmasked, narrative &#x27;I.&#x27;&quot; In this work, &quot;Avison expresses her wonder at her own rediscovered faith. It employs the same poetic techniques as &quot;Winter Sun&quot;, but here the poet is no longer searching for meaning. &quot;Truth&quot; has been identified as the presence of a personal, loving, and forgiving God.&quot;

&quot;This was further developed in &quot;sunblue&quot; (1978), a combination of social concern and moral values fused by religious conviction and a continuing restatement of personal faith.&quot; &quot;Both s&quot;unblue&quot; and &quot;No Time&quot; reconfirm Avison&#x27;s commitment to her Christian faith... In conjunction with their Christian themes, Avison&#x27;s poems often celebrate the creative power of the imagination as well as examining the concept of paradoxes and depicting people and landscapes from conflicting viewpoints.&quot;

&quot;Avison has the reputation of being a cerebral poet. Her work has been characterized as &#x27;intellectual&#x27;&quot; and &#x27;deliberate&#x27;; her use of word-play, disconcerting shifts in viewpoint, complex metaphors, and literary allusions make her poetry a challenge to read.&quot; &quot;The thing with her poetry is that you must grapple with it, it just does not open up. Its rewards come only to those are willing to make the effort,&quot; said Zezulka. &quot;Her poems were not snacks, they were full meals.&quot;

&quot;Reviewers have praised the poet for using complex language not as an end in itself, but to accurately convey her subject matter: the love and power of God.&quot; While &quot;some secularist critics find her post-conversion poetry too dogmatic,&quot; her defenders &quot;claim that the purpose of Avison&#x27;s poetry goes beyond that of simple religious proselytizing.&quot;

Reviewing Avison&#x27;s posthumous collection, &quot;Listening: Last Poems&quot; (2007), poet Judith Fitzgerald wrote of her: &quot;An original, an authentic visionary ... Avison praises Creation in all its transplendent awesome/awful mutations.&quot;

The University of Manitoba Archives &amp; Special Collections holds the Margaret Avison Fonds. The fonds consist of textual records, photographs, audio-cassettes, compact discs, computer- diskettes, and CD-ROMs. Textual materials include, but are not limited to, unpublished poetry, correspondence, theses, essays, and poems. Margaret Calverley has written about this collection in her article &quot;The Avison Collection at the University of Manitoba: Poems 1929-1989.&quot;

<text>Zielona Góra (; &quot;Green Mountain&quot;; ) is the largest city in Lubusz Voivodeship, located in western Poland, with 140,403 inhabitants (). The region is closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest. Zielona Góra is one of the two capital cities of Lubusz Voivodeship, hosting the province&#x27;s elected assembly, while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski.

In 1222 Duke Henry the Bearded from the Piast dynasty brought the first settlers to the area. In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges. The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506 and became part of the Habsburg Empire in 1526. It experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War, the city became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1742. It then was part of the North German Confederation and the German Reich until the end of World War II in 1945, when it became again part of Poland.

==Toponymy==
In the Silesian language, the city is called &quot;Źelůno Gůra&quot; (in Steuer&#x27;s Silesian alphabet) or &quot;Grinberg&quot;; using the Silesian primer alphabet: &quot;Zielōnŏ Gōra&quot; or &quot;Grinberg&quot;; in Silesian German, the city was called &quot;Grienberg&quot;.

In the 16th century, pseudo-historical Latin names appeared for the city, such as &quot;Prasia Elysiorum&quot; and &quot;Thalloris&quot;.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I. The oldest settlement was agricultural. It later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Lusatia. The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded. Other documents date the settlement to 1302.

The region received an influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung. In 1323, the settlement became a city with &quot;Crossener Recht&quot;, a variation of Magdeburg rights. The earliest mention of the town&#x27;s coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century. A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name &quot;GRVNINBERG&quot;, an early form of the German name &quot;Grünberg&quot;.

In 1294, Duke Henryk III of the Duchy of Głogów, founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig, the High Duchess consort of Poland and patron saint of Silesia. Now designated a co-cathedral, it is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365. Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron. In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań, destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it.

The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by the future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old. It was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506, although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city in 1508.

===Early modern period===
The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland. In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights. Another important branch of the city&#x27;s economy at this time was winemaking.
The city converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan. The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires. In 1651 during the Counter Reformation, the Habsburg monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism.

The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds. A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned. From 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665. As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft.

The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War. The Prussians introduced religious toleration, leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church &quot;Zum Garten Christ&quot; from 1746 to 1747. Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, POWs brought the plague to the city.

===Late modern period===
The city&#x27;s textile industry was booming by the end of the 1700s. By 1800, large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand. The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire. The city&#x27;s economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland. English industrialists were among the 19th-century economic reformers of Grünberg.

During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages, although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city. A Polish church remained functional until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association (&quot;Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników&quot;) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898; it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo. In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established. In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school.

Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars, Grünberg was administered within the district &quot;Landkreis Grünberg&quot; in the Province of Silesia. In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany. English industrialists purchased some of the city&#x27;s textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s. By 1885, most of Grünberg&#x27;s population of 14,396 were Protestants. The city was first connected to the Glogau (Głogów)-Grünberg-Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt (Nowogród Bobrzański) in 1904, Wollstein (Wolsztyn) in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau (Szprotawa) in 1911.
In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany. On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city. This status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany. During the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue. During World War II the Germans operated 42 forced labour camps in armaments production in the city, intended initially for Polish men and women, and later also Russians, Ukrainians, Britons, French and Italians. There were also three subcamps of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp within the modern city limits for Jewish men and women. In January 1945, a German-perpetrated death march of Jewish women from Sława reached the city, and the remaining prisoners were also sent on death marches westwards.

On February 11, 1945, the authorities of Zielona Góra, then still Grünberg, received a report about Russians in the vicinity of Nowa Sól. Wehrmacht soldiers and civilians organizing defense in cities were threatened with being cut off from the south-west. In this situation, the preparations of Zielona Góra for defense by regular troops were interrupted. On February 11 the Yalta Conference ended and it was not known exactly what would happen to Zielona Góra. On February 12 the most important German offices and management boards of larger enterprises were evacuated beyond Nysa Łużycka.

On February 13 other residents were encouraged to leave the city through megaphones. The last train left in the evening. One of the previously sent transports was hit by an English air attack in Dresden and, according to some, about 900 inhabitants of Zielona Góra died at the local railway station. On 14 February. Hitler&#x27;s ardent supporters called on the Hitler Youth to defend themselves. Previously, the so-called Sonderkommando, which from the morning started blowing up strategic objects and immobilizing various technical devices, e.g. power plants, gas plants and waterworks.

The defenders set up two machine guns on the Branibor Hill. Having heard about the imminent threat from Nowa Sól, they withdrew to the city center. On the other hand, the supporters of a quick surrender, including the worker Alfred Kuntzel, the Nazi Friedrich Brucks and the communist Karl Laube formed a surrender committee. The Soviet Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945, during World War II.

The Red Army headed by the Third Army began artillery fire at 13:00 from cannons positioned on the hills south of Racula. After reaching the northern border of this village, the reconnaissance units moved towards the city. Some of them, following an arc, ended up in Racula, others in Stary Kisielin and even in Jany, and still others took over . The main unit entered the city along Wrocławska Street. Soon, small groups of Red Army soldiers began to appear from the side of Kożuchowska Street. The 3rd Army established their headquarters in the Poviat Office building.

In that period, about 500 people committed suicide. The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement, the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

The town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. The city was briefly renamed &quot;Zielonogóra&quot; in 1945, before the historic Polish name &quot;Zielona Góra&quot; was restored. The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church (&quot;Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej&quot;). The city&#x27;s first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak, a former prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland. He is remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans.

===Recent history===

From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship. The city&#x27;s population rebounded quickly after the war. By 1950 it had more inhabitants than at any point in its history.

The University of Zielona Góra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów.

==Geography==
Zielona Góra is surrounded by tree-covered hills. The adjacent woodland makes up approximately half of the city&#x27;s total area. The name of the city translates to &#x27;Green Mountain&#x27; in both Polish and German. Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements, palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra the nickname &quot;The City of Wine&quot;.

===Wineries===
The city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines, the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia. The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At the Paradyż Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, with 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself.

During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852, an annual wine festival has taken place in the town. Wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself, with the last factory closed in the early 1990s.

Vodka &quot;Luksusowa&quot; (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra. &quot;Jarzębiak&quot;, a Polish fruit vodka made from rowan berries and other fruit ingredients, registered as a regional traditional beverage by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland, is also produced in Zielona Góra.

Another officially designated traditional beverage is the Zielona Góra beer, with local brewing traditions dating back to the 18th century.

<text>Ruda Śląska (; ) is a city in Silesia in southern Poland, near Katowice. It is a city in the Metropolis GZM, a metropolis with a population of two million. It is in the Silesian Highlands, on the Kłodnica River (tributary of the Oder).

It has been part of the Silesian Voivodeship since its formation in 1999. Previously, it was in Katowice Voivodeship, and before then, part of the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship. Ruda Śląska is one of the cities in the Katowice urban area (population 2.7 million) and within the greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area (population 5,294,000). The population of the city is 135,008 (December 2021).

==History==

A large village is known to have existed at the location of the present day city center in 1243. The city name appears to indicate the awareness and perhaps exploitation of ores from early times.

The area underwent rapid industrialization (coal, steel, zinc) in the 19th and the beginning of 20th century. However, it remained a cluster of industrial settlements and villages until the 1950s, when it was administratively united. However, it never developed into a truly unified city.

Before the German invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II, in 1939, German saboteurs carried out an attack in Ruda. Following the invasion, the area was under German occupation from 1939 to 1945. Several Polish teachers from present-day Ruda Śląska were murdered by the Germans in concentration camps as part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;. The Germans also established and operated a &quot;Polenlager&quot; forced labour camp for Poles in the present-day district of Kochłowice, and the E83 forced labour subcamp of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp in the present-day district of Chebzie. The Polish resistance movement was active in the area. In 1945, the German occupation ended, and the area was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which then stayed in power until the fall of communism in the 1980s.
After the fall of communism in 1989, the significant heavy industry was largely scaled down or restructured. The area has been transforming to a service-based economy. The well-known still operating coal mine is &quot;Halemba&quot;.

Since 2007, Ruda Śląska has been a member of the Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union (predecessor to the Metropolis GZM), the largest legally recognized urban area in Poland.

==Transport and infrastructure==

Significant roadways are Highway A4 and the Drogowa Trasa Średnicowa. There are several small railway stations, mainly on the line Katowice-Gliwice.

Since 1950, Ruda Śląska is the site of a transmission facility, which was used from 1950 to 1988 for medium-wave radio broadcasting.

==Higher education==

The neighboring cities of Katowice and Gliwice are large academic centers. Ruda Śląska is a seat of the Higher Academy of Commerce (Wyższa Szkoła Handlowa).

<text>Juba II of Mauretania (Latin: &quot;Gaius Iulius Iuba&quot;; or ; c. 48 BC – AD 23) was the son of Juba I and client king of Numidia (30–25 BC) and Mauretania (25 BC – AD 23). Aside from his very successful reign, he was a highly respected scholar and author. His first wife was Cleopatra Selene II, daughter of Queen Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman Triumvir Mark Antony.

==Life==
===Early life and education===
Juba II was a Berber prince from Numidia. He was the only child and heir of King Juba I of Numidia; his mother&#x27;s identity is unknown, though Juba II claimed to be a descendant of General Hannibal (Scol. Lucan, Pharsalia 8.287). In 46 BC, his father was defeated by Julius Caesar (in Thapsus, North Africa), and in 40 BC Numidia became a Roman province. His father had been an ally of the Roman General Pompey.

Several modern scholars cite his age at Caesar&#x27;s triumph in 46 BC as four or six giving rises to the typically cited birth year range of 52–50 BC, which his biographer, Duane Roller, believes is incorrect. Roller instead places his birth in early 48 BC because the Greek term &quot;brephos&quot; was used for him which means infant. The word for a child of age 4 to 6 is &quot;pais&quot; which was not used for him in the ancient sources. Therefore, Roller places his age in the triumph at anywhere from 2 months to 2 years, which actually indicates a birth year range between 48 and 46 BC.

Juba II was brought to Rome by Julius Caesar and he took part in Caesar&#x27;s triumphal procession. In Rome he learned the Latin and Greek, became romanized and was granted Roman citizenship. Through dedication to his studies, he is said to have become one of Rome&#x27;s best educated citizens, and by age 20 he wrote one of his first works entitled &quot;Roman Archaeology&quot;. 

He was raised by Julius Caesar and later by his great-nephew Octavian (future Emperor Augustus). While growing up, Juba II accompanied Octavian on military campaigns, gaining valuable experience as a leader. He fought alongside Octavian in the Battle of Actium in 31 BC.

===Restoration to the Numidian throne===

In 30 BC, Octavian restored Juba II as king of Numidia. Juba II established Numidia as an ally of Rome. Probably as a result of his services to Augustus in a campaign in Hispania, between 26 BC and 20 BC the Emperor arranged for him to marry Cleopatra Selene II, giving her a large dowry and appointing her queen. His kingdom replaced the province of Africa Nova which included territories of both Eastern Numidia and Western Numidia. This kingdom of Numidia (except the territory of Western Numidia) was in 25 BC directly annexed to the Roman Empire as the part of the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis and Juba II received Mauretania as his kingdom, enlarged by territory of Western Numidia.

===Reign in Mauretania===

According to Strabo, upon the death of the Mauretanian king Bocchus II, who was an ally of the Romans, his kingdom was briefly governed directly by Rome (33 BC - 25 BC), then in 25 BC Juba II received it from Augustus. When Juba II and Cleopatra Selene moved to Mauretania, they named their new capital &quot;Caesaria&quot; (modern Cherchell, Algeria), in honour of Augustus. The construction and sculpture projects at Caesaria and another city, Volubilis, display a rich mixture of Egyptian, Greek and Roman architectural styles.
Cleopatra is said to have exerted considerable influence on Juba II&#x27;s policies. Juba II encouraged and supported the performing arts, research of the sciences and research of natural history. Juba II also supported Mauretanian trade. The Kingdom of Mauretania was of great importance to the Roman Empire. Mauretania engaged in trade all across the Mediterranean, particularly with Spain and Italy. Mauretania exported fish, grapes, pearls, figs, grain, wooden furniture and purple dye harvested from certain shellfish, which was used in the manufacture of purple stripes for senatorial robes. Juba II sent a contingent to Iles Purpuraires to re-establish the ancient Phoenician dye manufacturing process. Tingis (modern Tangier), a town at the Pillars of Hercules (modern Strait of Gibraltar) became a major trade centre. In Gades, (modern Cádiz) and Carthago Nova (modern Cartagena) in Spain, Juba II was appointed by Augustus as an honorary Duovir (a chief magistrate of a Roman colony or town).

The value and quality of the Mauretanian coinage became highly regarded. The Greek historian Plutarch describes him as &#x27;one of the most gifted rulers of his time&#x27;. Between 2 BC and AD 2, he travelled with Gaius Caesar (a grandson of Augustus), as an advisor to the Eastern Mediterranean. In AD 21, Juba II made his son Ptolemy his co-ruler. 

Juba II died in AD 23. Juba II was buried alongside his first wife in the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania. Ptolemy then became the sole ruler of Mauretania. 

==Marriages and children==
* First marriage to Greek Ptolemaic princess Cleopatra Selene II (40 BC – 5 BC). Their children were:
**Ptolemy of Mauretania born in ca 10 BC/ 5 BC
** A daughter of Cleopatra and Juba, whose name has not been recorded (based on Roman naming conventions she would have had the nomen &quot;Julia&quot; but like many client royals she may have never used it), is mentioned in an inscription. She is sometimes assumed to have had the same cognomen as her niece Drusilla.
* Second marriage to Glaphyra, a princess of Cappadocia, and widow of Alexander, son of Herod the Great. Alexander was executed in 7 BC for his involvement in a conspiracy against his father. Glaphyra married Juba II in 6 AD or 7 AD. She then fell in love with Herod Archelaus, another son of Herod the Great and Ethnarch of Judea. Glaphyra divorced Juba to marry him in 7 AD.

==Works==
===Writings===

Juba wrote a number of books in Greek on history, natural history, geography, grammar, painting and theatre. He compiled a comparison of Greek and Roman institutions known as Όμοιότητες (&quot;Resemblances&quot;). His guide to Arabia became a bestseller in Rome. Only fragments of his works survive. He collected a substantial library on a wide variety of topics, which no doubt complemented his own prolific output. Pliny the Elder refers to him as an authority 65 times in the &quot;Natural History&quot; and in Athens, a monument was built in the Gymnasium of Ptolemy in recognition of his writings.

Ten works by Juba II have provisionally been identified, but all are fragmentary:

*&quot;Roman Archaeology&quot;, in two books
*&quot;Resemblances&quot;, in at least fifteen books
*&quot;On Painting&quot;, in at least eight books
*&quot;Theatrical History&quot;, in at least seventeen books
*&quot;The Wanderings of Hanno&quot;, possibly a translation of the periplus of Hanno the Navigator
*&quot;On Euphorbion&quot;, a pamphlet
*&quot;Libyka&quot;, in at least three books
*&quot;On Arabia&quot;, which is the only work by Juba that may have been in Latin
*&quot;On Assyria&quot;, in two books
*Epigrams, of which six lines of one quoted by Athenaeus are all that survives

Juba&#x27;s works survive only in quotations or citations by others, in both Greek and Latin. There are around 100 of these, about half in Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;. Others can be found in Athenaeus, Plutarch, Claudius Aelianus Harpokration, Dioscórides, Galen, Philostratus, Herodian, Tatian, Ammianus Marcellinus, Solinus, Hesychius of Miletus, Stephanos of Byzantium, Photios, the &quot;Etymologicum Magnum&quot;, the &quot;Geoponica&quot; and various scholia on classical authors.

Juba may have written plays, but these are not quoted, and no titles are known. The supposition relies on a reading of a passage in Athenaeus. There are two late citations to Juba that seem to be spurious. Photios cites the otherwise unknown &quot;On the Deterioration of Words&quot;, while Fulgentius cites a certain &quot;Fisiologia&quot;. Both may have been epitomes of Juba&#x27;s authentic works.

A treaty on metrics was formerly ascribed to him, but is now generally thought to have been written by an homonym.

===Patron of arts and sciences===
Juba II was a noted patron of the arts and sciences and sponsored several expeditions and biological research. According to Pliny the Younger, Juba II sent an expedition to the Canary Islands and Madeira. He named them the Canary Islands for the particularly ferocious dogs (&quot;canarius&quot; – from &quot;canis&quot; – meaning &quot;of the dogs&quot; in Latin) the expedition found there.

Flavius Philostratus recalled one of his anecdotes: &quot;And I have read in the discourse of Juba that elephants assist one another when they are being hunted, and that they will defend one that is exhausted, and if they can remove him out of danger, they anoint his wounds with the tears of the aloe tree, standing round him like physicians.&quot;

Juba&#x27;s Greek physician Euphorbus wrote that a succulent spurge found in the High Atlas was a powerful laxative. In 12 BC, Juba named this plant &quot;Euphorbia&quot; after Euphorbus, in response to Augustus dedicating a statue to Antonius Musa, Augustus&#x27;s own personal physician and Euphorbus&#x27;s brother. Botanist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus assigned the name &quot;Euphorbia&quot; to the entire genus in the physician&#x27;s honour. &quot;Euphorbia&quot; was later called &quot;Euphorbia regis-jubae&quot; (&quot;King Juba&#x27;s euphorbia&quot;) to honour the king&#x27;s contributions to natural history and his role in bringing the genus to notice. The palm tree genus &quot;Jubaea&quot; is also named after Juba.

<text>Equestrianism (from Latin , , , &#x27;horseman&#x27;, &#x27;horse&#x27;), commonly known as horse riding (Commonwealth English) or horseback riding (American English), includes the disciplines of riding, driving, and vaulting. This broad description includes the use of horses for practical working purposes, transportation, recreational activities, artistic or cultural exercises, and competitive sport.

==Overview of equestrian activities==

Horses are trained and ridden for practical working purposes, such as in police work or for controlling herd animals on a ranch. They are also used in competitive sports including dressage, endurance riding, eventing, reining, show jumping, tent pegging, vaulting, polo, horse racing, driving, and rodeo (see additional equestrian sports listed later in this article for more examples). Some popular forms of competition are grouped together at horse shows where horses perform in a wide variety of disciplines. Horses (and other equids such as mules) are used for non-competitive recreational riding, such as fox hunting, trail riding, or hacking. There is public access to horse trails in almost every part of the world; many parks, ranches, and public stables offer both guided and independent riding. Horses are also used for therapeutic purposes both in specialized para-equestrian competition as well as non-competitive riding to improve human health and emotional development.

Horses are also driven in harness racing, at horse shows, and in other types of exhibition such as historical reenactment or ceremony, often pulling carriages. In some parts of the world, they are still used for practical purposes such as farming.

Horses continue to be used in public service, in traditional ceremonies (parades, funerals), police and volunteer mounted patrols and for mounted search and rescue.

Riding halls, also known as indoor arenas or schools, enable training of horse and rider in all weathers as well as indoor competition riding.

==History of horse use==

Though there is controversy over the exact date horses were domesticated and when they were first ridden, the best estimate is that horses first were ridden approximately 3500 BC. There is some evidence that about 3000 BC, near the Dnieper River and the Don River, people were using bits on horses, as a stallion that was buried there shows teeth wear consistent with using a bit. However, the most unequivocal early archaeological evidence of equines put to working use was of horses being driven. Chariot burials about 2500 BC present the most direct hard evidence of horses used as working animals. In ancient times chariot warfare was followed by the use of war horses as light and heavy cavalry. The horse played an important role throughout human history all over the world, both in warfare and in peaceful pursuits such as transportation, trade and agriculture. Horses lived in North America, but died out at the end of the Ice Age. Horses were brought back to North America by European explorers, beginning with the second voyage of Columbus in 1493. Equestrianism was introduced in the 1900 Summer Olympics as an Olympic sport with jumping events.

==Horse racing==

Humans appear to have long expressed a desire to know which horse or horses were the fastest, and horse racing has ancient roots. Gambling on horse races appears to go hand-in hand with racing and has a long history as well. Thoroughbreds have the pre-eminent reputation as a racing breed, but other breeds also race.

===Types of horse racing===
Under saddle:
* Thoroughbred horse racing is the most popular form worldwide. In the UK, it is known as flat racing and is governed by the Jockey Club in the United Kingdom. In the US, horse racing is governed by the Jockey Club. other light breeds are also raced worldwide.
* Steeplechasing involves racing on a track where the horses also jump over obstacles. It is most common in the UK, where it is also called National Hunt racing.

In harness:
* Both light and heavy breeds as well as ponies are raced in harness with a sulky or racing bike. The Standardbred dominates the sport in both trotting and pacing varieties.
* The United States Trotting Association organizes harness racing in the United States.
* Harness racing is also found throughout Europe, New Zealand and Australia.

Distance racing:

* Endurance riding, takes place over a given, measured distance and the horses have an even start. Top level races are usually , over mountainous or other natural terrain, with scheduled stops to take the horses&#x27; vital signs, check soundness and verify that the horse is fit to continue. The first horse to finish and be confirmed by the veterinarian as fit to continue is the winner. Limited distance rides of about are offered to newcomers. Variants include Ride and Tie and various forms of long riding.

==International and Olympic disciplines==

Equestrian events were first included in the modern Olympic Games in 1900. By 1912, all three Olympic disciplines were part of the games. Three forms of competition are recognized worldwide and are a part of the equestrian events at the Olympics. They are governed by the rules of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI):
* Dressage (&quot;training&quot; in French) involves the progressive training of the horse to a high level of impulsion, collection and obedience. Competitive dressage has the goal of showing the horse carrying out, on request, the natural movements that it performs without thinking while running loose.
* Show jumping comprises a timed event judged on the ability of the horse and rider to jump over a series of obstacles, in a given order and with the fewest refusals or knockdowns of portions of the obstacles.
* Eventing, also called &quot;combined training&quot;, &quot;horse trials&quot;, the &quot;three-day event&quot;, &quot;the Military&quot; or &quot;the complete test&quot;, puts together the obedience of dressage with the athletic ability of show jumping, the fitness demands the cross-country jumping phase. In the last-named, the horses jump over fixed obstacles, such as logs, stone walls, banks, ditches and water, trying to finish the course under the &quot;optimum time&quot;. There was formerly a &#x27;Steeple Chase&#x27; phase, which has been excluded from most major competitions to bring them in line with the Olympic standard.

The additional internationally sanctioned but non-Olympic disciplines governed by the FEI are: combined driving; endurance; reining; and vaulting. These disciplines are part of the FEI World Equestrian Games every four years and may hold their own individual World Championships in other years. The FEI also recognizes horseball and tent pegging as its two regional disciplines.

===Para-equestrian disciplines===
Para-equestrian competition at the international level, including the Paralympics, are also governed by the FEI and offer the following competition events:
* Para-Equestrian Dressage is conducted under the same rules as conventional Dressage, but with riders divided into different competition grades based on their functional abilities.
* Para-Equestrian Driving places competitors in grades based on their skill.

==Haute École==
The &quot;haute école&quot; (F. &quot;high school&quot;), an advanced component of Classical dressage, is a highly refined set of skills seldom used in competition but often seen in demonstration performances.

The world&#x27;s leading Classical dressage programs include:
* The Cadre Noir in Saumur, France.
* The Spanish Riding School in Vienna, Austria.
* The Portuguese School of Equestrian Art at Queluz National Palace, Portugal.
* The Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian Art in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain.

Other major classical teams include the South African Lipizzaners and the Hollandsche Manege of the Netherlands.

==Horse shows==
Horse shows are held throughout the world with a tremendous variety of possible events, equipment, attire, and judging standards used. However, most forms of horse show competition can be broken into the following broad categories:
* Equitation, sometimes called &quot;seat and hands&quot; or &quot;horsemanship&quot;, refers to events where the rider is judged on form, style and ability.
* &quot;Pleasure, flat&quot; or &quot;under saddle&quot; classes feature horses who are ridden on the flat (not jumped) and judged on manners, performance, movement, style and quality.
* &quot;Halter, in-hand breeding&quot; or &quot;conformation&quot; classes, where the horse is led by a handler on the ground and judged on conformation and suitability as a breeding animal.
* &quot;Harness&quot; classes, where the horse is driven rather than ridden, but still judged on manners, performance and quality.
* &quot;Jumping&quot; or &quot;Over Fences&quot; refers broadly to both show jumping and show hunter, where horses and riders must jump obstacles. 

==English riding==
In addition to the classical Olympic events, the following forms of competition are seen. In North America they are referred to as &quot;English riding&quot; in contrast with western riding; elsewhere in the world, if a distinction is necessary, they are usually described as &quot;classic riding&quot;: 
* Hunt seat or Hunter classes judge the movement and the form of horses suitable for work over fences. A typical show hunter division would include classes over fences as well as &quot;Hunter under Saddle&quot; or &quot;flat&quot; classes (sometimes called &quot;hack&quot; classes), in which the horse is judged on its performance, manners and movement without having to jump. Hunters have a long, flat-kneed trot, sometimes called &quot;daisy cutter&quot; movement, a phrase suggesting a good hunter could slice daisies in a field when it reaches its stride out. The over fences classes in show hunter competition are judged on the form of the horse, its manners and the smoothness of the course. A horse with good jumping form snaps its knees up and jumps with a good bascule. It should also be able to canter or gallop with control while having a stride long enough to make a proper number of strides over a given distance between fences. Hunter classes differ from jumper classes, in which they are not timed, and equitation classes, in which the rider&#x27;s performance is the focus. Hunter style is based on fox hunting, so jumps in the hunter division are usually more natural colors than the jumps in a jumper division.
* Eventing, show jumping and dressage, described under &quot;Olympic disciplines&quot;, above are all &quot;English&quot; riding disciplines that in North America sometimes are loosely classified within the &quot;hunt seat&quot; category.
* Saddle seat, is a primarily American discipline, though has recently become somewhat popular in South Africa, was created to show to best advantage the animated movement of high-stepping and gaited breeds such as the American Saddlebred and the Tennessee Walker. Arabians and Morgans may also be shown saddle seat in the United States. There are usually three basic divisions. &quot;Park&quot; divisions are for the horses with the highest action. &quot;Pleasure&quot; divisions still emphasis animated action, but to a lesser degree, with manners ranking over animation. &quot;Plantation&quot; or &quot;Country&quot; divisions have the least amount of animation (in some breeds, the horses are flat-shod) and the greatest emphasis on manners.
* Show hack is a competition seen primarily in the United Kingdom, Australia and other nations influenced by British traditions, featuring horses of elegant appearance, with excellent way of going and self-carriage. A related event is riding horse.

==Western riding==


Western riding evolved from the cattle-working and warfare traditions brought to the Americas by the Spanish, and both equipment and riding style evolved to meet the working needs of the cowboy on ranches in the American West.

The most noticeable feature of western style riding is the western saddle, which has a substantial saddle tree that provides support to horse and rider when working long hours in the saddle. The western saddle features a prominent pommel topped by a horn (a knob used for dallying a lariat after roping an animal), wide stirrups, and in some cases, both front and back cinches. The depth of the seat may depend on the activity, a deeper seat used for barrel racing or cutting cows or a more shallow seat for general ranch riding or Steer wrestling.

Finished western horses are asked to perform with a loose rein controlled by one hand. The headstall of a western bridle may utilize either a Snaffle bit or curb bit. Bitless headstalls are also seen, such as a bosal-style hackamore on younger horses, or various styles of mechanical hackamore. In Vaquero style training, a combination of a bosal and bit, called a &quot;two-rein&quot;, is used at some stages of training. The standard western bridle lacks a noseband and usually consists of a single set of reins attached to a curb bit that has somewhat longer shanks than the curb of an English Weymouth bridle or a pelham bit. Western bridles have either a browband or else a &quot;one ear&quot; loop (sometimes two) that crosses in front of the horse&#x27;s ear. Two styles of Western reins developed: The long split reins of the Texas tradition, which are completely separated, or the &quot;Romal&quot; reins of the California tradition, which are closed reins with a long single attachment (the romal) that can be used as a quirt. Modern rodeo competitors in timed events sometimes use a closed rein without a &quot;romal&quot;.

Western riders wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants or jeans, cowboy boots, and a wide-brimmed cowboy hat. A rider may wear protective leather leggings called chaps. Riders may wear brighter colors or finer fabrics in competition than for work. In particular, horse show events such as Western pleasure may much flashier equipment. Saddles, bits and bridles are ornamented with substantial amounts of silver, rider clothing may have vivid colors and even rhinestones or sequins.

==Harness==
Horses, ponies, mules and donkeys are driven in harness in many different ways. For working purposes, they can pull a plow or other farm equipment designed to be pulled by animals. In many parts of the world they still pull wagons for basic hauling and transportation. They may draw carriages at ceremonies, in parades or for tourist rides.

As noted in &quot;horse racing&quot; &quot;above&quot;, horses can race in harness, pulling a very lightweight cart known as a sulky. At the other end of the spectrum, some draft horses compete in horse pulling competitions, where single or teams of horses and their drivers vie to determine who can pull the most weight for a short distance.

In horse show competition, the following general categories of competition are seen:
* Combined driving, an internationally recognized competition where horses perform an arena-based &quot;dressage&quot; class where precision and control are emphasized, a cross-country &quot;marathon&quot; section that emphasizes fitness and endurance, and a &quot;stadium&quot; or &quot;cones&quot; obstacle course.
* Draft horse showing: Most draft horse performance competition is done in harness.
* Pleasure driving: Horses and ponies are usually hitched to a light cart shown at a walk and two speeds of trot, with an emphasis on manners.
* Fine harness: Also called &quot;Formal driving&quot;, Horses are hitched to a light four-wheeled cart and shown in a manner that emphasizes flashy action and dramatic performance.
* Roadster: A horse show competition where exhibitors wear racing silks and ride in a sulky in a style akin to harness racing, only without actually racing, but rather focusing on manners and performance.
* Carriage driving, using somewhat larger two or four wheeled carriages, often restored antiques, judged on the turnout/neatness or suitability of horse and carriage.

==Rodeo==
Rodeo events include the following forms of competition:

===Timed events===
* Barrel racing and pole bending – the timed speed and agility events seen in rodeo as well as gymkhana or O-Mok-See competition. Both men and women compete in speed events at gymkhanas or O-Mok-Sees; however, at most professional, sanctioned rodeos, barrel racing is an exclusively women&#x27;s sport. In a barrel race, horse and rider gallop around a cloverleaf pattern of barrels, making agile turns without knocking the barrels over. In pole bending, horse and rider run the length of a line of six upright poles, turn sharply and weave through the poles, turn again and weave back, then return to the start.
* Steer wrestling – Also known as &quot;Bulldogging&quot;, this is a rodeo event where the rider jumps off his horse onto a steer and &#x27;wrestles&#x27; it to the ground by grabbing it by the horns. This is probably the single most physically dangerous event in rodeo for the cowboy, who runs a high risk of jumping off a running horse head first and missing the steer or of having the thrown steer land on top of him, sometimes horns first.
* Goat tying – usually an event for women or pre-teen girls and boys, a goat is staked out while a mounted rider runs to the goat, dismounts, grabs the goat, throws it to the ground and ties it in the same manner as a calf. This event was designed to teach smaller or younger riders the basics of calf roping without the more complex need to also lasso the animal.

===Roping===
Roping includes a number of timed events that are based on the real-life tasks of a working cowboy, who often had to capture calves and adult cattle for branding, medical treatment and other purposes. A lasso or lariat is thrown over the head of a calf or the horns of adult cattle, and the animal is secured in a fashion dictated by its size and age.
* Calf roping, also called &quot;tie-down roping&quot;, is an event where a calf is roped around the neck by a lariat, the horse stops and sets back on the rope while the cowboy dismounts, runs to the calf, throws it to the ground and ties three feet together. (If the horse throws the calf, the cowboy must lose time waiting for the calf to get back to its feet so that the cowboy can do the work. The job of the horse is to hold the calf steady on the rope) This activity is still practiced on modern working ranches for branding, medical treatment, and so on.
* Team roping, also called &quot;heading and heeling&quot;, is the only rodeo event where men and women riders may compete together. Two people capture and restrain a full-grown steer. One horse and rider, the &quot;header&quot;, lassos a running steer&#x27;s horns, while the other horse and rider, the &quot;heeler&quot;, lassos the steer&#x27;s two hind legs. Once the animal is captured, the riders face each other and lightly pull the steer between them, so that it loses its balance, thus in the real world allowing restraint for treatment.
* Breakaway roping – an easier form of calf roping where a very short lariat is used, tied lightly to the saddle horn with string and a flag. When the calf is roped, the horse stops, allowing the calf to run on, flagging the end of time when the string and flag breaks from the saddle. In the United States, this event is primarily for women of all ages and boys under 12, while in some nations where traditional calf roping is frowned upon, riders of both genders compete.

===&quot;Rough Stock&quot; competition===

In spite of popular myth, most modern &quot;broncs&quot; are not in fact wild horses, but are more commonly spoiled riding horses or horses bred specifically as bucking stock.
* Bronc riding – there are two divisions in rodeo, bareback bronc riding, where the rider rides a bucking horse holding onto a leather surcingle or rigging with only one hand, and saddle bronc riding, where the rider rides a modified western saddle without a horn (for safety) while holding onto a braided lead rope attached to the horse&#x27;s halter.
* Bull Riding – though technically not an equestrian event, as the cowboys ride full-grown bulls instead of horses, skills similar to bareback bronc riding are required.

===International rodeo===
* Australian rodeo
* Chilean rodeo
* Charreada

==Other equestrian activities==

There are many other forms of equestrian activity and sports seen worldwide. There are both competitive events and pleasure riding disciplines available.

===Arena sports===
* Arena polo and Cowboy polo
* Pato (Argentina&#x27;s national sport)
* Equestrian vaulting: In vaulting, a surcingle with two hoops at the top is attached around a horse&#x27;s barrel. The horse also wears a bridle with side reins. The vaulter is longed on the horse, and performs gymnastic movements while the horse walks, trots, and canters.
* Gymkhana, competition of timed pattern games, also known as &quot;O-Mok-See&quot; in the western United States.

===Horse sports that use cattle===
* Bullfighting (&quot;rejoneo&quot;)
**Portuguese-style bullfighting
**Spanish-style bullfighting
* Campdrafting, a type of cattle-working competition popular in Australia
* Cutting
* Team penning
* Working cow horse

===Defined area sports===
* Buzkashi, a sport originating on the steppes of central Asia, now the national sport of Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan.
* Cowboy mounted shooting
* Horseball
* Jousting and Skill at Arms, events involving use of lances, swords and completion of obstacles. There are stand-alone competitions and also are often seen at historical reenactments, Renaissance Fairs and Society for Creative Anachronism events.
* Mounted archery
** Yabusame
* Mounted Games, a sport where games are played in a relay-style with two to five members per team at very high speed
* Polo, a team game played on horses, involves riders using a long-handled mallet to drive a ball on the ground into the opposing team&#x27;s goal while the opposing team defends their goal
* Polocrosse
* Tent pegging

===Cross-country sports===
* Competitive Mounted Orienteering, a form of orienteering on horses (but unrelated to orienteering) – consists of three stages: following a precise route marked on a map, negotiation of obstacles and control of paces.
* Le Trec, which comprises three phases – trail riding, with jumping and correct basic flatwork. Le Trec, which is very popular in Europe, tests the partnership&#x27;s ability to cope with an all-day ride across varied terrain, route finding, negotiating natural obstacles and hazards, while considering the welfare of the horse, respecting the countryside and enjoying all it has to offer.
* Competitive trail riding, a pace race held across terrain similar to endurance riding, but shorter in length (25 – , depending on class). Being a form of pace race, the objective is not to finish in the least time. Instead, as in other forms of judged trail riding, each competitor is graded on everything including physical condition, campsite and horse management. Horsemanship also is considered, including how the rider handles the trail and how horse is handled and presented to the judge and vet throughout the ride. The horse is graded on performance, manners, etc. &quot;Pulse and respiration&quot; stops check the horse&#x27;s recovery ability. The judges also set up obstacles along the trail and the horse and rider are graded on how well they perform as a team. The whole point is the partnership between the horse and rider.
* Cross Country Jumping, a jumping course that contains logs and natural obstacles mostly. The common clothes worn are usually brighter colors and less conservative.
* Endurance riding, a competition usually of 50 to or more, over mountainous or other natural terrain, with scheduled stops to take the horses&#x27; vital signs, check soundness and verify that the horse is fit to continue. The first horse to finish and be confirmed by the veterinarian as fit to continue is the winner. Additional awards are usually given to the best-conditioned horses who finish in the top 10.
* Fox hunting
* Hacking, or pleasure riding.
* Hunter Pacing is a sport where a horse and rider team travel a trail at speeds based the ideal conditions for the horse, with competitors seeking to ride closest to that perfect time. Hunter paces are usually held in a series. Hunter paces are usually a few miles long and covered mostly at a canter or gallop. The horsemanship and management skills of the rider are also considered in the scoring, and periodic stops are required for veterinarians to check the vital signs and overall soundness of the horses.
* Ride and Tie is a form of endurance riding in which teams of 3 (two humans and one horse) alternate running and riding.
* Steeplechase, a distance horse race with diverse fence and ditch obstacles.
* Trail Riding, pleasure riding any breed horse, any style across the land.

==Health issues==
Handling, riding and driving horses have inherent risks. Horses are large prey animals with a well-developed flight or fight instinct able to move quickly and unexpectedly. When mounted, the rider&#x27;s head may be up to from the ground, and the horse may travel at a speed of up to . The injuries observed range from very minor injuries to fatalities.

A study in Germany reported that the relative risk of injury from riding a horse, compared to riding a bicycle, was 9 times higher for adolescents and 5.6 times higher for younger children, but that riding a horse was less risky than riding a moped. In Victoria, Australia, a search of state records found that equestrian sports had the third highest incidence of serious injury, after motor sports and power boating. In Greece, an analysis of a national registry estimated the incidence of equestrian injury to be 21 per 100,000 person-years for farming and equestrian sports combined, and 160 times higher for horse racing personnel. Other findings noted that helmets likely prevent traumatic brain injuries.

In the United States each year an estimated 30 million people ride horses, resulting in 50,000 emergency department visits (1 visit per 600 riders per year). A survey of 679 equestrians in Oregon, Washington and Idaho estimated that at some time in their equestrian career one in five will be seriously injured, resulting in hospitalization, surgery or long-term disability. Among survey respondents, novice equestrians had an incidence of any injury that was threefold over intermediates, fivefold over advanced equestrians, and nearly eightfold over professionals. Approximately 100 hours of experience are required to achieve a substantial decline in the risk of injury. The survey authors conclude that efforts to prevent equestrian injury should focus on novice equestrians.

===Mechanisms of injury===
The most common injury is falling from the horse, followed by being kicked, trampled and bitten. About 3 out of 4 injuries are due to falling, broadly defined. A broad definition of falling often includes being crushed and being thrown from the horse, but when reported separately each of these mechanisms may be more common than being kicked.

===Types and severity of injury===
In Canada, a 10-year study of trauma center patients injured while riding reported that although 48% had suffered head injuries, only 9% of these riders had been wearing helmets at the time of their accident. Other injuries involved the chest (54%), abdomen (22%) and extremities (17%). A German study reported that injuries in horse riding are rare compared to other sports, but when they occur they are severe. Specifically, they found that 40% of horse riding injuries were fractures, and only 15% were sprains. Furthermore, the study noted that in Germany, one quarter of all sport related fatalities are caused by horse riding.
Most horse related injuries are a result of falling from a horse, which is the cause of 60–80% of all such reported injuries. Another common cause of injury is being kicked by a horse, which may cause skull fractures or severe trauma to the internal organs. Some possible injuries resulting from horse riding, with the percent indicating the amounts in relation to all injuries as reported by a New Zealand study, include:
* Arm fracture or dislocation (31%)
* Head injury (21%)
* Leg fracture or dislocation (15%)
* Chest injury (33%)

Among 36 members and employees of the Hong Kong Jockey Club who were seen in a trauma center during a period of 5 years, 24 fell from horses and 11 were kicked by the horse. Injuries comprised: 18 torso; 11 head, face or neck; and 11 limb. The authors of this study recommend that helmets, face shields and body protectors be worn when riding or handling horses.

In New South Wales, Australia, a study of equestrians seen at one hospital over a 6-year period found that helmet use both increased over time and was correlated with a lower rate of admission. However, 81% of admissions were wearing a helmet at the time of injury, In the second half of the study period, of the equestrians seen at a hospital, only 14% were admitted. In contrast, a study of child equestrians seen at a hospital emergency department in Adelaide reported that 60% were admitted.

In the United States, an analysis of National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) data performed by the Equestrian Medical Safety Association studied 78,279 horse-related injuries in 2007: &quot;The most common injuries included fractures (28.5%); contusions/abrasions (28.3%); strain/sprain (14.5%); internal injury (8.1%); lacerations (5.7%); concussions (4.6%); dislocations (1.9%); and hematomas (1.2%). Most frequent injury sites are the lower trunk (19.6%); head (15.0%); upper trunk (13.4%); shoulder (8.2%); and wrist (6.8%). Within this study patients were treated and released (86.2%), were hospitalized (8.7%), were transferred (3.6%), left without being treated (0.8%), remained for observation (0.6%) and arrived at the hospital deceased (0.1%).&quot;

===Head injuries===
Horseback riding is one of the most dangerous sports, especially in relation to head injury. Statistics from the United States, for example, indicate that about 30 million people ride horses annually. On average, about 67,000 people are admitted to the hospital each year from injuries sustained while working with horses. 15,000 of those admittances are from traumatic brain injuries. Of those, about 60 die each year from their brain injuries. Studies have found horseback riding to be more dangerous than several sports, including skiing, auto racing and football. Horseback riding has a higher hospital admittance rate per hours of riding than motorcycle racing, at 0.49 per thousand hours of riding and 0.14 accidents per thousand hours, respectively.

Head injuries are especially traumatic in horseback riding. About two-thirds of all riders requiring hospitalization after a fall have sustained a traumatic brain injury. Falling from a horse without wearing a helmet is comparable to being struck by a car. Most falling deaths are caused by head injury.

The use of riding helmets substantially decreases the likelihood and severity of head injuries. When a rider falls with a helmet, he or she is five times less likely to experience a traumatic brain injury than a rider who falls without a helmet. Helmets work by crushing on impact and extending the length of time it takes the head to stop moving. Despite this, helmet usage rates in North America are estimated to be between eight and twenty percent.

Once a helmet has sustained an impact from falling, that part of the helmet is structurally weakened, even if no visible damage is present. Helmet manufacturers recommend that a helmet that has undergone impact from a fall be replaced immediately. In addition, helmets should be replaced every three to five years; specific recommendations vary by manufacturer.

===Rules on helmet use in competition===

Many organizations mandate helmet use in competition or on show grounds, and rules have continually moved in the direction of requiring helmet use. In 2011, the United States Equestrian Federation passed a rule making helmet use mandatory while mounted on competition grounds at U.S. nationally rated eventing competitions. Also in 2011, the United States Dressage Federation made helmet use in competition mandatory for all riders under 18 and all riders who are riding any test at Fourth Level and below. If a rider competing at Prix St. Georges and above is also riding a test at Fourth Level or below, he or she must also wear a helmet at all times while mounted.

===Riding astride===

The idea that riding a horse astride could injure a woman&#x27;s sex organs is a historic, but sometimes popular even today, misunderstanding or misconception, particularly that riding astride can damage the hymen. Evidence of injury to any female sex organs is scant. In female high-level athletes, trauma to the perineum is rare and is associated with certain sports (see Pelvic floor#Clinical significance). The type of trauma associated with equestrian sports has been termed &quot;horse riders&#x27; perineum&quot;. A case series of 4 female mountain bike riders and 2 female horse riders found both patient-reported perineal pain and evidence of sub-clinical changes in the clitoris; the relevance of these findings to horse riding is unknown.

In men, sports-related injuries are among the major causes of testicular trauma. In a small controlled but unblinded study of 52 men, varicocele was significantly more common in equestrians than in non-equestrians. The difference between these two groups was small, however, compared to differences reported between extreme mountain bike riders and non-riders, and also between mountain bike riders and on-road bicycle riders. Horse-riding injuries to the scrotum (contusions) and testes (blunt trauma) were well known to surgeons in the 19th century and early 20th century. Injuries from collision with the pommel of a saddle are mentioned specifically.

<text>Ptolemy of Mauretania (, &quot;Ptolemaîos&quot;; ; 13 9BC–AD40) was the last Roman client king and ruler of Mauretania for Rome. He was the son of Juba II, the king of Numidia and a member of the Berber Massyles tribe, as well as a descendant of the Ptolemaic dynasty via his mother Cleopatra Selene II.

== Life ==


Ptolemy was the son of King Juba II and Queen Cleopatra Selene II of Mauretania. His birth date is not certainly known but must have occurred before his mother&#x27;s death, which has been estimated to have taken place in 5BC. He had a sister (possibly younger) who is evidenced by an Athenian inscription, but her name has not been preserved. She may have been called Drusilla. 

His father Juba II was the son of King Juba I of Numidia, who was descended from the Berbers of North Africa and was an ally to the Roman Triumvir Pompey. His mother Cleopatra Selene II was the daughter of the Ptolemaic Greek Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt and the Roman Triumvir Mark Antony. Ptolemy was of Berber, Greek and Roman ancestry. Ptolemy and his sister were the only known children of Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II to reach maturity, and were among the younger grandchildren to Mark Antony. Through his maternal grandfather, Ptolemy was distantly related to Julius Caesar and the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Ptolemy was a first cousin to Germanicus and the Roman Emperor Claudius and a second cousin to the Emperor Caligula, the Empress Agrippina the Younger, the Empress Valeria Messalina and the Emperor Nero. 

Ptolemy was most probably born in Caesaria, the capital of the Kingdom of Mauretania (modern Cherchell, Algeria) in the Roman Empire. He was named in honor of his mother&#x27;s ancestors, in particular the Ptolemaic dynasty. In choosing her son&#x27;s name, Cleopatra Selene II created a distinct Greek-Egyptian tone and emphasized her role as the monarch who would continue the Ptolemaic dynasty. She by-passed the ancestral names of her husband. By naming her son Ptolemy instead of a Berber ancestral name, she offers an example rare in ancient history, especially in the case of a son who is the primary male heir, of reaching into the mother&#x27;s family instead of the father&#x27;s for a name. This emphasized the idea that his mother was the heiress of the Ptolemies and the leader of a Ptolemaic government in exile.

Through his parents, Ptolemy had Roman citizenship, and they sent him to Rome to be educated. His mother likely died in 5BC and was placed in the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania, built by his parents. In Rome, Ptolemy received a good Roman education. He was part of the remarkable court of his maternal aunt Antonia Minor, an influential aristocrat who presided over a circle of various princes and princesses which assisted in the political preservation of the Roman Empire&#x27;s borders and affairs of the client states. Antonia Minor, the youngest daughter of Mark Antony and the youngest niece of Emperor Augustus, was a half-sister of Ptolemy&#x27;s late mother, also a daughter of Mark Antony. Antonia Minor&#x27;s mother was Octavia Minor, Mark Antony&#x27;s fourth wife and the second sister of Octavian (later Augustus). 

Ptolemy lived in Rome until the age of 21, when he returned to the court of his aging father in Mauretania.

===Reign===
When Ptolemy returned to Mauretania, JubaII made Ptolemy his co-ruler and successor. Coinage has survived from JubaII&#x27;s co-rule with his son. On coinage, on one side is a central bust of JubaII with his title in Latin&quot; ‘King Juba’&quot;. On the other side is a central bust of Ptolemy and the inscription stating in Latin&quot; ‘King Ptolemy son of Juba’&quot;. JubaII died in 23 and was placed alongside Cleopatra SeleneII in the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania. Ptolemy then became the sole ruler of Mauretania.

During his co-rule with JubaII, and into his sole rule, Ptolemy, like his father, appeared to be a patron of art, learning, literature and sports. In Athens, Greece, statues were erected to JubaII and Ptolemy in a gymnasium, and a statue was erected in Ptolemy&#x27;s honor in reference to his taste in literature. Ptolemy dedicated statues of himself on the Acropolis. The Athenians honored Ptolemy and his family with inscriptions dedicated to them, and this reveals that the Athenians had respect towards the Roman Client Monarchs and their families, which was common in the 1st century.
In the year 17, the local Berber tribes, the Numidian Tacfarinas and Garamantes, started to revolt against the Kingdom of Mauretania and Rome. The war had ravaged Africa, and Berber forces included former slaves from Ptolemy&#x27;s household who had joined in the revolt. Ptolemy through his military campaigns was unsuccessful in ending the Berber revolt. The war reached the point where Ptolemy summoned the Roman governor of Africa, Publius Cornelius Dolabella, and his army to assist him in ending the revolt. The war ended in the year 24. Although Ptolemy&#x27;s army and the Romans won, both parties suffered considerable losses of infantry and cavalry.

The Roman Senate, impressed by Ptolemy&#x27;s loyal conduct, had sent a Roman senator to visit him. The Roman senator recognized Ptolemy&#x27;s loyal conduct and awarded him an ivory scepter, an embroidered triumphal robe, and the senator greeted Ptolemy as &quot;king, ally, and friend&quot;. This recognition was a tradition which recognized and rewarded the allies of Rome.

Ptolemy, through his military campaigns, had proven his capability and loyalty as an ally and Client King to Rome. He was a popular monarch with the Berbers and had travelled extensively throughout the Roman Empire, including Alexandria, Egypt and Ostia, Italy.

In Caesaria, prayers were offered for the health of Ptolemy at the Temple of Saturn &quot;frugifer dues&quot;. Mauretania was a region that was abundant in agriculture, and a god considered equivalent to Saturn was the god of agriculture. This cult was an important one in the kingdom. A temple and a sanctuary were dedicated to Saturn in Caesaria by 30 and, throughout Mauretania, various temples were dedicated to Saturn.

His mother originated from Egypt, where there were various imperial cults dedicated to the Pharaohs and their relatives, and there is a possibility that his father&#x27;s Royal Numidian ancestors may have had imperial cults dedicated to them.

A surviving inscription in Mauretania hints that either JubaII or Ptolemy established an imperial cult honoring Hiempsal II, a previous Numidian King and paternal grandfather of JubaII. According to inscription evidence, Ptolemy may have established a Royal Mauretanian cult honoring himself and his late parents (see Berber mythology). One inscription is dedicated to his genius, and another inscription expressed wishes for his good health.

Evidence suggesting that Ptolemy could have deified JubaII after his death is from the writings of the Christian author of the 3rd century, Marcus Minucius Felix. In Felix&#x27;s &quot;Octavius&quot;, the writer records a dialogue between a Christian and a pagan from Cirta. This dialogue was part of a Christian argument that divinity is impossible for mortals. Felix lists humans who were said to have become divine: &quot;Saturn, Jupiter, Romulus and Juba&quot;. Further literary evidence, suggesting the deification of JubaII by Ptolemy, is from the brief euhemerist exercise entitled &quot;On the Vanity of Idols&quot; by the 3rd-century Christian saint Cyprian. In his exercise in deflating the gods, Cyprian observed and stated that the Mauretanians were manifestly worshiping their kings and did not conceal their name by any disguise. According to the surviving evidence, there is a strong probability that JubaII and Ptolemy were deified by the Berbers after their deaths.

Coinage from Ptolemy&#x27;s sole reign is different from those during the time Ptolemy co-ruled with JubaII. His royal title on coinage is in Latin&quot; ‘King Ptolemy’&quot; and there is no surviving coinage that shows his royal title in Greek. On his coinage there is no Ancient Egyptian imagery. The coinage from his sole reign displays a variety of themes. Ptolemy personified himself as an elephant on coins. Elephant personification is an ancient coinage tradition in which his late parents partook when they ruled Mauretania. The elephant has symbolic functions: an icon representing Africa and an iconic monetary characteristic from the Hellenistic period which displays influence and power. Another animal Ptolemy uses on coins is a lion leaping, which is a symbol of animal kingship and is a symbol representing Africa.

Other coins display Roman themes. A rare revealing gold coin, dated from the year 39, celebrates Ptolemy&#x27;s ascent, his rule, and his loyalty to Rome. On one side of the coin is a central bust of JubaII inscribed in Latin &quot;‘King Juba son of Juba’&quot;. JubaII is personified like a Greek Egyptian pharaoh from the Ptolemaic dynasty. The other side of the coin is an eagle with its wings displayed on a thunderbolt, and Ptolemy&#x27;s initials are inscribed in Latin. Through his father&#x27;s central bust and inscription, Ptolemy is celebrating and showing the continuation of his family and rule, while honoring his paternal ancestry. Ptolemy through the eagle is celebrating the Roman Peace, honoring the rule of the Roman Empire, while he is showing his allegiance and loyalty to Ancient Rome. Another coin, dating from the year 40, celebrates his senatorial decree. The coin shows, on one side, a curule chair upon which is a wreath and has a sceptre leaning against it. On the other side of the coin, Ptolemy is wearing a fillet on his head.

Ptolemy seemed to have had expensive tastes and enjoyed luxury items. He owned a custom-made citrus wood wine table. Mauretania had many citrus trees and produced many citrus wood tables, which were frequently sought out by aristocrats and monarchs.

Ptolemy married a woman named Julia Urania, who came from obscure origins. She is only known through a funeral inscription found at Caesaria through her freedwoman Julia Bodina. Bodina ascribed Julia Urania as &quot;Queen Julia Urania&quot;. There is a possibility that Julia Urania was a member of the royal family of Emesa (modern Homs, Syria). Ptolemy married Julia Urania at an unknown date during the 1st century. She bore Ptolemy, in about 38, a daughter called Drusilla. 

===Death===
The Kingdom of Mauretania was one of the wealthiest Roman client kingdoms, and after 24, Ptolemy continued to reign without interruption. In late 40, Caligula invited Ptolemy to Rome and welcomed him with appropriate honors. Ptolemy was confirmed as king and an ally and friend of the empire, but he was assassinated by the order of Caligula. Caligula&#x27;s motivation is unclear. Ancient historians claim envy of Ptolemy&#x27;s wealth or a theatrical crowd&#x27;s admiration of Ptolemy&#x27;s purple cloak. Later historians have suggested other motivations. Some of these are inspired by Suetonius&#x27;s claim about the purple cloak, while others are independent of the claims of the ancient historians, for example, the idea that Ptolemy may have been implicated in a plot by Gaetulicus or Caligula wanted to exert greater control over Mauretania.

After Ptolemy&#x27;s murder in Rome, his former household slave Aedemon, from outrage and out of loyalty to his former master, took revenge against Caligula by starting the revolt of Mauretania with the Berbers against Rome. The Berber revolt was a violent one, and the rebels were skilled fighters against the Roman Army. The Roman generals Gnaeus Hosidius Geta and Gaius Suetonius Paulinus were needed to end the revolt. Mauretania was divided into two provinces, which were Mauretania Tingitana and Mauretania Caesariensis.

==In popular culture==

Ptolemy is a minor character in the novels by Robert Graves, &quot;I Claudius &quot; and &quot;Claudius the God&quot;.

He appears in Stephanie Dray&#x27;s novel &quot;Daughters of the Nile&quot;, which marked the end of the trilogy focusing on Ptolemy&#x27;s mother.

Throughout Algeria and Morocco, statues have survived that belonged to Ptolemy. There is a nude statue of him, dated from the 1st century, which is on display at the Museum of History and Civilizations in Rabat, Morocco. His sculpted images are of a youthful appearance, and particularly those first portraits created during the reign of JubaII virtually show his relations to the Julio-Claudian dynasty. This is evident by the arrangement of the comma shaped locks over the forehead. There is a seven-inch fine bronze Roman imperial bust of Ptolemy about age 15 which Sotheby&#x27;s auctioned in New York for $960,000 in 2004.

<text>A Terrible Revenge: The Ethnic Cleansing of the East European Germans, 1944–1950 is a 1994 non-fiction book written by Cuban-born American lawyer Alfred-Maurice de Zayas, former research fellow at MPG in Heidelberg, Germany. The work is based on a collection of testimonials from German civilians and &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; military personnel; and devoted to the expulsion of Germans after World War II from states previously occupied by Nazi Germany. It includes as well selected interviews with British and American politicians who participated at the Potsdam Conference, including Robert Murphy, Geoffrey Harrison (drafter of article XIII of the Potsdam Protocol), and Denis Allen (drafter of article IX on the provisional post-war borders). The book attempts to describe the crimes committed against the German nation by the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia at the end of World War II – as perceived by the expellees themselves and settlers brought in &quot;Heim ins Reich&quot; (Home into the Empire) from the east.

The author begins with the history of German settlement in Central and Eastern Europe since the 12th century, the impact of the Treaty of Versailles on German minorities in Poland and Czechoslovakia, the failure of the League of Nations system of minority protection, the outbreak of World War II and selected crimes committed by the Nazis, followed by the story of refugees from the former Eastern parts of Germany (Silesia, East Prussia, Pomerania, East Brandenburg), as well as the fate of German minorities in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.

In the book, de Zayas claims that approximately two million Germans died during the post period of 1944–1949, although his claim does not withstand scrutiny. Most recent research on the subject has put the number at around half a million.

==Printing history==
The book originated as a script for a television documentary by the Bavarian Broadcasting. It was a popular rendition of the author&#x27;s monography on the expulsions called the &quot;Nemesis at Potsdam&quot; (). This shorter introduction to the subject was published in German as &quot;Anmerkungen zur Vertreibung der Deutschen aus dem Osten&quot; (4 editions during 1986–1996, Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart, ), first printed in English under the title of &quot;The German Expellees: Victims in War and Peace&quot; (St. Martin&#x27;s Press, New York, 1993, Macmillan, London). The new, 1994 English title, included the then neologism &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;, used at that time in relation to the crimes committed by Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina of the 1990s. The 5th expanded German 2006 edition was titled &quot;Die deutschen Vertriebenen&quot; (Leopold Stocker Verlag, ). The book ends with 12 historical theses, 14 legal theses and 10 conclusions. It was positively reviewed in Germany by Andreas Hillgruber in the Historische Zeitschrift and Gotthold Rhode in the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;.

The 2006 English edition was expanded by about 20%. It contains additional information from interviews with the children of the displaced, German expellees who migrated to the United States and Canada, new photos and new statistical tables.

==Reviews==
&quot;This popularly written but still scholarly study follows the author&#x27;s other successful books in the fields of history and international law [which] were hailed by historians as well as lawyers as masterpieces of academic craftsmanship. His book.presents in a nutshell the history of the ethnic German population which had settled in the early 13th century in large parts of what is nowadays Eastern Europe.&quot; &quot;Netherlands International Law Review&quot; 1986, pp. 430–431. 

&quot;This is the story of the ethnic Germans who found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. Some two million died and fifteen million were displaced – driven from their lands by those opposed to anyone and everything German... De Zayas&#x27;s moving plea is that one&#x27;s home should be a human right. As frontiers once more shift in Eastern Europe and families flee in Bosnia, he could hardly have chosen a better moment to deliver it.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot;, (London) 18 November 1993. 

==Criticism==
One reviewer, Rainer Ohliger of Humboldt University, argues that de Zayas over-emphasizes the role of the Bund der Vertriebenen (non-governmental association representing the expellees) and its property and territorial claims. It has been noted that no West–East migration occurred when this possibility arose after the unification of the German states, and that practically no Germans have returned to the East after the Baltic States, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania entered the European Union.

The book has also been criticized for its victim perspective, normally unsuitable for scholarly works, unfavourably comparing it with a more recent book of Detlef Brandes. The 2006 revised and enlarged edition of &quot;Terrible Revenge&quot; with Palgrave/Macmillan takes some of these considerations into account. In the introduction the author notes that a &quot;Terrible Revenge&quot; is a popularized version of his longer monograph &quot;Nemesis at Potsdam&quot; (1–3 editions Routledge, 6th edition Picton Press, Rockland, Maine 2003). See also review of the Future of Freedom Foundation.

Other reviews have criticized both de Zayas and Brandes reversely. According to Eagle Glassheim on the H-Net website, Brandes does not provide any moral conclusion deriving from violence against civilians due to their ethnic heritage.

Genocide historians Donald Bloxham and Tony Kushner describe the book as &quot;tendentious&quot;.

<text>Horse racing is an equestrian performance activity, typically involving two or more horses ridden by jockeys (or sometimes driven without riders) over a set distance for competition. It is one of the most ancient of all sports, as its basic premise – to identify which of two or more horses is the fastest over a set course or distance – has been mostly unchanged since at least classical antiquity.

Due to animal cruelty, companies and individuals are boycotting horse racing and it has been steadily declining in popularity worldwide. 

Horse races vary widely in format, and many countries have developed their own particular traditions around the sport. Variations include restricting races to particular breeds, running over obstacles, running over different distances, running on different track surfaces, and running in different gaits. In some races, horses are assigned different weights to carry to reflect differences in ability, a process known as handicapping.

While horses are sometimes raced purely for sport, a major part of horse racing&#x27;s interest and economic importance is in the gambling associated with it, an activity that in 2019 generated a worldwide market worth around US$115 billion.

==World Championship==
International Federation of Horseracing Authorities was founded in 1961 and 1983 but now (2024) have not an official World Horse Racing Championship.

==History==

Horse racing has a long and distinguished history and has been practiced in civilizations across the world since ancient times. Archaeological records indicate that horse racing occurred in Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Babylon, Syria, Arabia, and Egypt. It also plays an important part of myth and legend, such as in the contest between the steeds of the god Odin and the giant Hrungnir in Norse mythology.

Chariot racing was one of the most popular sports of ancient Greece, Rome and the Byzantine Empire. By 648 BCE, both chariot and mounted horse racing events were part of the ancient Greek Olympics, and were important in the other Panhellenic Games. Chariot racing was dangerous to both driver and horse, often leading to serious injury and even death. In the Roman Empire, chariot and mounted horse racing were major industries. From the mid-fifth century BCE, spring carnival in Rome closed with a horse race. Fifteen to twenty riderless horses, originally imported from the Barbary Coast of North Africa, were set loose to run the length of the Via del Corso, a long, straight city street. The race lasted about two-and-a-half minutes.

In later times, Thoroughbred racing became popular with British royalty and aristocrats, earning it the title of &quot;Sport of Kings&quot;.

Historically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and displayed the horsemanship required for battle. Horse racing evolved from impromptu competitions among riders and drivers. The various forms of competition, which required demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment. The popularity of equestrian sports throughout the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have vanished once horses were no longer used in combat.

In Britain, horse racing became well-established in the 18th century, and continued to grow in popularity. King Charles II (reigned 1649 to 1685) was an avid sportsman who gave Newmarket its prominence. By 1750, the Jockey Club was formed as a way to control the Newmarket races, set the rules of the game, prevent dishonesty, and create a level field. The Epsom Derby began in 1780. The first of the five classic races began with the St Leger Stakes in 1776. In 1814, the system was complete with five annual races. While Newmarket and the Jockey Club set the standards, most of the racing took place in landowners&#x27; fields and in rising towns for small cash prizes and enormous local prestige. The system of wagering was essential to funding and growing of the industry, and all classes, from paupers to royalty participated. Members of high society were in control, and they made a special effort to keep out the riff-raff and to keep the criminal element away from the wagering. With real money at stake, the system needed skilled jockeys, trainers, grooms, and experts at breeding, which opened up new careers for working-class rural men. Every young ambitious stable boy could dream of making it big.

In addition to its rich history, horse racing is marked by noteworthy statistics. The Thoroughbred Secretariat still holds the fastest times in the 1973 Triple Crown races. Jockey Russell Baze demonstrated exceptional skill with an unmatched 12,842 victories. Economic significance is reflected in the career earnings of the American Pharoah, totaling over $8.6 million. These quantifiable achievements add another facet to the captivating history of horse racing.&quot;

Horse racing has also seen technological advancements, with innovations like photo finishes, electronic timing, and advanced breeding techniques enhancing the sport’s precision and competitiveness.

Horse racing was one of the few sports that continued during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis, with the Australian and Hong Kong racing jurisdictions carrying on, albeit with no crowds. The United States, the United Kingdom, and France were some of the more prominent racing bodies to either postpone or cancel all events.

==Types of horse racing==
There are many types of horse racing, including:

*Flat racing, where horses gallop directly between two points around a straight or oval track.
*Jump racing, or Jumps racing, also known as Steeplechasing or, in Great Britain and Ireland, National Hunt racing, where horses race over obstacles. 
*Harness racing, where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a sulky.
*Saddle Trotting, where horses must trot from a starting point to a finishing point under saddle
*Endurance racing, where horses travel across the country over extreme distances, generally ranging from . Anything less than 25 miles qualifies as a limited distance ride or LD.

Different breeds of horses have been bred to excel in each of these disciplines. Breeds that are used for flat racing include the Thoroughbred, Quarter Horse, Arabian, Paint, and Appaloosa. Jump racing breeds include the Thoroughbred and AQPS. In harness racing, Standardbreds are used in Australia, New Zealand and North America. In Europe, Russian and French Trotters are used with Standardbreds. Light cold blood horses, such as Finnhorses and Scandinavian Coldblood Trotters are also used in harness racing within their respective geographical areas.

There are also races for ponies: both flat and jump and harness racing.

===Flat racing===

Flat racing is the most common form of horse racing seen worldwide. Flat racing tracks are typically oval in shape and are generally level, although in Great Britain and Ireland there is much greater variation, including figure-of-eight tracks like Windsor and tracks with often severe gradients and changes of camber, such as Epsom Racecourse. Track surfaces vary, with turf most common in Europe and dirt more common in North America and Asia. Newly designed synthetic surfaces, such as Polytrack or Tapeta, are seen at some tracks.

Individual flat races are run over distances ranging from to more than , although races longer than are quite rare, and distances between are the most common. Short races are generally referred to as &quot;sprints&quot;, while longer races are known as &quot;routes&quot; in the United States or &quot;staying races&quot; in Europe. Although fast acceleration (&quot;a turn of foot&quot;) is usually required to win either type of race, in general sprints are seen as a test of speed, while long-distance races are seen as a test of stamina. The most prestigious flat races in the world, such as the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe, Melbourne Cup, Japan Cup, Epsom Derby, Kentucky Derby and Dubai World Cup, are run over distances in the middle of this range and are seen as tests of both speed and stamina to some extent.

In the most prestigious races, horses are generally allocated the same weight to carry for fairness, with allowances given to younger horses and female horses running against males. These races are called conditions races and offer the biggest purses. There is another category of races called handicap races where each horse is assigned a different weight to carry based on its ability. Besides the weight they carry, horses&#x27; performance can also be influenced by position relative to the inside barrier, sex, jockey, and training.

===Jump racing===
Jump (or jumps) racing in Great Britain and Ireland is known as National Hunt racing (although, confusingly, National Hunt racing also includes flat races taking place at jumps meetings; these are known as National Hunt flat races). Jump racing can be subdivided into steeplechasing and hurdling, according to the type and size of obstacles being jumped. The word &quot;steeplechasing&quot; can also refer collectively to any type of jump race in certain racing jurisdictions, particularly in the United States.

Typically, horses progress to bigger obstacles and longer distances as they get older, so that a European jumps horse will tend to start in National Hunt flat races as a juvenile, move on to hurdling after a year or so, and then, if thought capable, move on to steeplechasing.

=== Harness racing ===

A type of racing where horses go around a track while pulling a sulky and a driver behind them. In this sport, Standardbreds are used. These horses are separated into two categories, trotters and pacers. Pacers move the legs on each side of their body in tandem, while trotters move their diagonal legs together. The latter are typically faster than the former due to the gaits used. Occasionally a horse will break their gait into an actual canter or gallop. This could cause the loss of a race or even a disqualification. Notable races include the Hambletonian and the Breeder&#x27;s Crown series.

=== Saddle trot racing ===
Ridden trot races are more common in places such as Europe and New Zealand. These horses are trotters who race on the flat under saddle with a jockey on their backs.

===Endurance racing===

The length of an endurance race varies greatly. Some are very short, only ten miles, while other races can be up to one hundred miles. There are a few races that are even longer than one hundred miles and last multiple days. These different lengths of races are divided into five categories: pleasure rides (10–20 miles), non-competitive trail rides (21–27 miles), competitive trail rides (20–45 miles), progressive trail rides (25–60 miles), and endurance rides (40–100 miles in one day, up to in multiple days). Because each race is very long, trails of natural terrain are generally used.

Contemporary organized endurance racing began in California around 1955, and the first race marked the beginning of the Tevis Cup This race was a one-hundred-mile, one-day-long ride starting in Squaw Valley, Placer County, and ending in Auburn. Founded in 1972, the American Endurance Ride Conference was the United States&#x27; first national endurance riding association. The longest endurance race in the world is the Mongol Derby, which is long.

==Breeds==
In most horse races, entry is restricted to certain breeds; that is, the horse must have a sire (father) and a dam (mother) who are studbook-approved individuals of whatever breed is racing. For example, in a normal harness race, the horse&#x27;s sire and dam must both be pure Standardbreds. The exception to this is in Quarter Horse racing, where an Appendix Quarter Horse may be considered eligible to race against (standard) Quarter Horses. The designation of &quot;Appendix&quot; refers to the addendum section, or Appendix, of the Official Quarter Horse registry. An Appendix Quarter Horse is a horse that has either one Quarter Horse parent and one parent of any other eligible breed (such as Thoroughbred, the most common Appendix cross), two parents that are registered Appendix Quarter Horses, or one parent that is a Quarter Horse and one parent that is an Appendix Quarter Horse. AQHA also issues a &quot;Racing Register of Merit&quot;, which allows a horse to race on Quarter Horse tracks, but not be considered a Quarter Horse for breeding purposes (unless other requirements are met).

A stallion who has won many races may be put up to stud when he is retired. Artificial insemination and embryo transfer technology (allowed only in some breeds) have brought changes to the traditions and ease of breeding.

Pedigrees of stallions are recorded in various books and websites, such as &quot;Weatherbys Stallion Book&quot;, the &quot;Australian Stud Book&quot; and &quot;Thoroughbred Heritage&quot;.

===Thoroughbred===

There are three founding sires that all Thoroughbreds can trace back to in the male line: the Darley Arabian, the Godolphin Arabian, and the Byerley Turk, named after their respective owners Thomas Darley, Lord Godolphin, and Captain Robert Byerly. They were taken to England, where they were bred with mares from English and imported bloodlines. The resultant foals were the first generation of thoroughbreds, and all modern thoroughbreds are their descents. Thoroughbreds range in height, which is measured in hands (a hand being four inches). Some are as small as 15 hands while others are over 17. Thoroughbreds can travel medium distances at fast paces, requiring a balance between speed and endurance. Thoroughbreds may be bay, black, dark bay/brown, chestnut, gray, roan, white or palomino. Artificial insemination, cloning and embryo transfer are not allowed in the Thoroughbred breed.
=== Standardbred ===
The standardbred is a breed of horse used for a variety of purposes, but they are largely bred for harness racing. They are descended from thoroughbreds, morgans, and extinct breeds. Standardbreds are typically docile and easy to handle. They do not spook easily and are quite versatile in what they can do. They can be jumpers, dressage, and pleasure riding horses.

===Arabian horse===

The Arabian horse was developed by the Bedouin people of the West Asia specifically for stamina over long distances, so they could outrun their enemies. It was not until 1725 that the first Arabians was brought to North America, and not until about the time of the Civil War that they were bred as purebreds. Until the formation of the Arabian Horse Registry of America in 1908, Arabians were recorded with the Jockey Club in a separate subsection from Thoroughbreds.

Arabians must be able to withstand traveling long distances at a moderate pace. They have an abundance of type I muscle fibers, enabling their muscles to work for extended periods of time. Also, the muscles of the Arabian are not nearly as massive as those of the Quarter Horse, which allow it to travel longer distances at quicker speeds. The Arabian is primarily used today in endurance racing but is also raced over traditional race tracks in many countries.

Arabian Horse Racing is governed by the International Federation of Arabian Horse Racing.

===Quarter Horse===

The ancestors of the Quarter Horse were prevalent in America in the early 17th century. These horses were a blend of Colonial Spanish horses crossed with English horses that were brought over in the 1700s. The native horse and the English horse were bred together, resulting in a compact, muscular horse. At this time, they were mainly used for chores such as plowing and cattle work. The American Quarter Horse was not recognized as an official breed until the formation of the American Quarter Horse Association in 1940.

In order to be successful in racing, Quarter Horses need to be able to propel themselves forward at extremely fast sprinter speed. The Quarter Horse has much larger hind limb muscles than the Arabian, which make it less suitable for endurance racing. It also has more type II-b muscle fibers, which allow the Quarter Horse to accelerate rapidly.

When Quarter Horse racing began, it was very expensive to lay a full mile of track so it was agreed that a straight track of four hundred meters, or one-quarter of a mile, would be laid instead. It became the standard racing distance for Quarter Horses and inspired their name. With the exception of the longer, distance contests, Quarter Horse races are run flat out, with the horses running at top speed for the duration. There is less jockeying for position, as turns are rare, and many races end with several contestants grouped together at the wire. The track surface is similar to that of Thoroughbred racing and usually consists of dirt.

In addition to the three main racing breeds above and their crosses, horse racing may be conducted using various other breeds: Appaloosa, American Paint Horse, Selle Français, AQPS and Korean Jeju.

===Horse breeds and muscle structure===
Muscles are bundles of contractile fibers that are attached to bones by tendons. These bundles have different types of fibers within them, and horses have adapted over the years to produce different amounts of these fibers.

====Type 1====
Type I muscle fibers are adapted for aerobic exercise and rely on the presence of oxygen. They are slow-twitch fibers. They allow muscles to work for longer periods of time resulting in greater endurance.

====Type 2====
Type II muscles are adapted for anaerobic exercise because they can function in the absence of oxygen.

Type II-a fibers are intermediate, representing a balance between the fast-twitch fibers and the slow-twitch fibers. They allow the muscles to generate both speed and endurance. Thoroughbreds possess more Type II-a muscle fibers than Quarter Horses or Arabians. This type of fiber allows them to propel themselves forward at great speeds and maintain it for an extended distance.

Type II-b fibers are fast-twitch fibers. These fibers allow muscles to contract quickly, resulting in a great deal of power and speed.

==Training==
The conditioning program for the horses varies depending on the race length. Genetics, training, age, and skeletal soundness are all factors that contribute to a horse&#x27;s performance. The muscle structure and fiber type of horses depends on the breed; therefore, genetics must be considered when constructing a conditioning plan. A horse&#x27;s fitness plan must be coordinated properly in order to prevent injury or lameness. If these are to occur, they may negatively affect a horse&#x27;s willingness to learn. Sprinting exercises are appropriate for training two-year-old racehorses, but the number is limited by psychological factors as well as physical. A horse&#x27;s skeletal system adapts to the exercise it receives. Because the skeletal system does not reach full maturity until the horse is at least six years of age, young racehorses often suffer injuries.

==Horse racing by continent==
===North America===

====United States====

In the United States, Thoroughbred flat races are run on surfaces of either dirt, synthetic or turf. Other tracks offer Quarter Horse racing and Standardbred racing, on combinations of these three types of racing surfaces. Racing of other breeds, such as Arabian horse racing, is found on a limited basis. American Thoroughbred races are run at a wide variety of distances, most commonly from ; with this in mind, breeders of Thoroughbred race horses attempt to breed horses that excel at a particular distance (see dosage index).

Horse racing in the United States and on the North American continent dates back to 1665, which saw the establishment of the Newmarket course in Salisbury, New York, a section of what is now known as the Hempstead Plains of Long Island, New York. This first racing meet in North America was supervised by New York&#x27;s colonial governor, Richard Nicolls. The area is now occupied by the present Nassau County, New York, a region of Greater Westbury and East Garden City. The South Westbury section is still known as Salisbury.

The first record of quarter-mile length races dated back to 1674 in Henrico County, Virginia. Each race consisted of only two horses, and they raced down the village streets and lanes. The Quarter Horse received its name from the length of the race.

Tracing back the history of horse racing in the United States to its earliest inception in 1665, this sport has become an industry contributing approximately $15 billion to the U.S. economy today. Horse racing has become the second most popular spectator sport in the United States with the establishment of historic tracks like Belmont Park, major events like the Kentucky Derby, and significant institutions such as the American Stud Book.

The American Stud Book was started in 1868, prompting the beginning of organized horse racing in the United States. There were 314 tracks operating in the United States by 1890; and in 1894, the American Jockey Club was formed.

The Pleasanton Fairgrounds Racetrack at the Alameda County Fairgrounds is the oldest remaining horse racing track in America, dating from 1858, when it was founded by the sons of the Spaniard Don Agustín Bernal.

Belmont Park is located at the western edge of the Hempstead Plains. Its mile-and-a-half main track is the largest dirt Thoroughbred racecourse in the world, and it has the sport&#x27;s largest grandstand.

One of the latest major horse tracks opened in the United States was the Meadowlands Racetrack, opened in 1977 for Thoroughbred and Harness racing. It is the home of the Meadowlands Cup. Other more recently opened tracks include Remington Park, Oklahoma City, opened in 1988, Sam Houston Race Park in the Houston metro area, opened in 1994, and Lone Star Park in the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex, opened in 1997; the latter track hosted the prestigious Breeders&#x27; Cup series of races in 2004.

Thoroughbred horse racing in the United States has its own Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York. The Hall of Fame honors remarkable horses, jockeys, owners, and trainers.

The traditional high point of US horse racing is the Kentucky Derby, held on the first Saturday of May at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. Together, the Derby; the Preakness Stakes, held two weeks later at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland; and the Belmont Stakes, held three weeks after the Preakness at Belmont Park on Long Island, form the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing for three-year-olds. They are all held early in the year, throughout May and the beginning of June. In recent years the Breeders&#x27; Cup races, run at the end of the year, have challenged the Triple Crown events as determiners of the three-year-old champion. The Breeders&#x27; Cup is normally held at a different track every year; however, the 2010 and 2011 editions were both held at Churchill Downs, and 2012, 2013 and 2014 races were held at Santa Anita Park. Keeneland, in Lexington, Kentucky, hosted the 2015 Breeders&#x27; Cup.

The corresponding Standardbred event is the Breeders Crown. There is also a Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers and a Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Trotters.

American betting on horse racing is sanctioned and regulated by the state where the race is located. Simulcast betting exists across state lines with minimal oversight except the companies involved through legalized parimutuel gambling. A takeout, or &quot;take&quot;, is removed from each betting pool and distributed according to state law, among the state, race track and horsemen. A variety of factors affect takeout, namely location and the type of wager that is placed. One form of parimutuel gaming is Instant Racing, in which players bet on video replays of races.

Advanced Deposit Wagering is a form of gambling on the outcome of horse races in which the bettor must fund his or her account before being allowed to place bets. ADW is often conducted online or by phone. In contrast to ADW, credit shops allow wagers without advance funding; accounts are settled at month-end. Racetrack owners, horse trainers and state governments sometimes receive a cut of ADW revenues.

====Canada====
The most famous horse from Canada is generally considered to be Northern Dancer, who after winning the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Queen&#x27;s Plate in 1964 went on to become the most successful Thoroughbred sire of the twentieth century; his two-minute-flat Derby was the fastest on record until Secretariat in 1973. The only challenger to his title of greatest Canadian horse would be his son Nijinsky II, who is the last horse to win the English Triple Crown. Woodbine Racetrack (1956) in Toronto is home of the Queen&#x27;s Plate (1860), Canada&#x27;s premier Thoroughbred stakes race, and the North America Cup (1984), Canada&#x27;s premier Standardbred stakes race. It is the only race track in North America which stages Thoroughbred and Standardbred (harness) meetings on the same day. The Canadian International and Woodbine Mile (1981) are Canada&#x27;s most important Grade I races worth Can$1,000,000 each, and have been won by many renowned horses such as Secretariat and Wise Dan respectively. Other key races include Woodbine Oaks (1956), Prince of Wales Stakes (1929), Breeders&#x27; Stakes (1889) and Canadian Derby (1930).
===Europe===
====Belgium====
Horse racing in Belgium takes place at three venues – Hippodrome Wellington in Ostend (opened in 1883 in honour of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington), Hippodroom Waregem in Waregem in Flanders and Hippodrome de Wallonie in Mons, Wallonia.

====Czech Republic====
There are 15 racecourses in the Czech Republic, most notably Pardubice Racecourse, where the country&#x27;s most famous race, the Velka Pardubicka steeplechase, has been run since 1874. However, the first official race was organized back in 1816 by Emperor Francis II near Kladruby nad Labem. The Czech horse racing season usually starts at the beginning of April and ends sometime in November. Racing takes place mostly at weekends and there is usually one meeting on a Saturday and one on Sunday. Horse races, as well as Thoroughbred horse breeding, is organized by Jockey Club Czech Republic, founded in 1919.

====France====
France has a major horse racing industry. It is home to the famous Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe held at Longchamp Racecourse, the richest race in Europe and the third richest turf race in the world after the Japan Cup and the Everest with a prize of 4  million Euros (approximately US$4.2  million). Other major races include the Grand Prix de Paris, the Prix du Jockey Club (the French Derby) and the Prix de Diane. Besides Longchamp, France&#x27;s other premier flat racecourses include Chantilly and Deauville. There is also a smaller but nevertheless important jumps racing sector, with Auteil Racecourse being the best known. The sport&#x27;s governing body is France Galop.

====Great Britain====

Horse racing in Great Britain is predominantly thoroughbred flat and jumps racing. It was in Great Britain in the 17th to 19th centuries that many of the sport&#x27;s rules and regulations were established. Named after Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby, The Derby was first run in 1780. The race serves as the middle leg of the British Triple Crown, preceded by the 2000 Guineas and followed by the St Leger. The name &quot;Derby&quot; has since become synonymous with great races all over the world, and as such has been borrowed many times in races abroad.

The Grand National is the most prominent race in British culture, watched by many people who do not normally watch or bet on horse racing at other times of the year. Many of the sport&#x27;s greatest jockeys, most notably Sir Gordon Richards, have been British. The sport is regulated by the British Horseracing Authority. The BHA&#x27;s authority does not extend to Northern Ireland; racing in Ireland is governed on an All-Ireland basis.

====Greece====
Despite having an ancient tradition with well-documented history, all racetracks in Greece have ceased operation due to the Greek government-debt crisis.

====Hungary====
Hungary has a long-standing horse racing tradition. The first horse racing in Pest was noted on June 6, 1827. Although racing in Hungary is neither as popular nor as prestigious as it is in Western Europe, the country is notable for producing some fine international racehorses. Foremost of these is Kincsem, foaled in 1874 and the most successful Thoroughbred racehorse ever, having won 54 races in 54 starts. The country also produced Overdose, a horse who won his first 12 races, including group races in Germany and Italy, and finished fourth in the King&#x27;s Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot.

====Ireland====

Ireland has a rich history of horse racing; point to pointing originated there, and even today, jump racing is more popular than racing on the flat. As a result, every year Irish horse racing fans travel in huge numbers to the highlight event of the National Hunt calendar, the Cheltenham Festival, and in recent years Irish owned or bred horses have dominated the event. Ireland has a thriving Thoroughbred breeding industry, stimulated by favorable tax treatment. The world&#x27;s largest Thoroughbred stud farm, Coolmore Stud, has its main site there (in addition to major operations in the U.S. and Australia).

In recent years, various Irish bred and trained horses achieved victory in one or more of the British 2000 Guineas, The Derby and the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe, considered the three most prestigious races in Europe. In the six runnings of the Epsom Derby between 2008 and 2013, Irish horses filled 20 of the first 30 placings, winning the race 5 times.

====Italy====

Historically, Italy has been one of the leading European horse-racing nations, albeit in some respects behind Great Britain, Ireland, and France in size and prestige. The late Italian horse breeder Federico Tesio was particularly notable. In recent years, however, the sport in the country has suffered a major funding crisis, culminating in its 2014 expulsion from the European Pattern.

====Netherlands====

In Wassenaar in the Hague there is a grass course at Duindigt.

====Poland====

Horse racing in Poland can be dated to 1777, when a horse owned by Polish noble Kazimierz Rzewuski beat the horse of the English chargé d&#x27;affaires, Sir Charles Whitworth, on the road from Wola to Ujazdów Castle. The first regular horse racing was organized in 1841 on Mokotów Fields in Warsaw by Towarzystwo Wyścigów Konnych i Wystawy Zwierząt Gospodarskich w Królestwie Polskim (in English, the Society of Horse Racing in Congress Poland). The main racetrack in Poland is Warsaw&#x27;s Służewiec Racecourse. The industry was severely limited during the Communist era, when gambling, the major source of funding, was made illegal.

====Sweden====
Harness racing (also known as trotting), is a popular sport in Sweden, with significant amounts of money wagered annually.

===Oceania===
====Australia====

Horse racing in Australia was founded during the early years of settlement and the industry has grown to be among the top three leading Thoroughbred racing nations of the world. The world-famous Melbourne Cup, the &quot;race that stops a nation&quot;, has recently attracted many international entries. In country racing, records indicate that Goulburn commenced racing in 1834. Australia&#x27;s first country racing club was established at Wallabadah in 1852 and the Wallabadah Cup is still held on New Year&#x27;s Day (the current racecourse was built in 1898).

In Australia, the most famous racehorse was Phar Lap (bred in New Zealand), who raced from 1928 to 1932. Phar Lap carried to win the 1930 Melbourne Cup. Australian steeplechaser Crisp is remembered for his battle with Irish champion Red Rum in the 1973 Grand National. In 2003–2005 the mare Makybe Diva (bred in Great Britain) became the only racehorse to ever win the Melbourne Cup three times, let alone in consecutive years. Still more recently, another mare, Winx. won the prestigious Cox Plate four straight times, and set a modern-era world record for most consecutive race wins by a Thoroughbred, winning the last 33 races of her career. In harness racing, Cane Smoke had 120 wins, including 34 in a single season, Paleface Adios became a household name during the 1970s, while Cardigan Bay, a pacing horse from New Zealand, enjoyed great success at the highest levels of American harness racing in the 1960s. More recently, Blacks A Fake has won four Inter Dominion Championships, making him the only horse to complete this feat in Australasia&#x27;s premier harness race.

Competitive endurance riding commenced in Australia in 1966, when the Tom Quilty Gold Cup was first held in the Hawkesbury district, near Sydney. The Quilty Cup is considered the National endurance ride and there are now over 100 endurance events contested across Australia, ranging in distances from 80 km to 400 km. The world&#x27;s longest endurance ride is the Shahzada 400 km Memorial Test which is conducted over five days traveling 80 kilometers a day at St Albans on the Hawkesbury River, New South Wales. In all endurance events, there are rigorous vet checks, conducted before, during and after the competition, in which the horses&#x27; welfare is of the utmost concern.

====New Zealand====
Racing is a long-established sport in New Zealand, stretching back to colonial times.

Horse racing is a significant part of the New Zealand economy which in 2004 generated 1.3% of the GDP. The indirect impact of expenditures on racing was estimated to have generated more than $1.4 billion in economic activity in 2004 and created 18,300 full-time equivalent jobs. More than 40,000 people were involved in some capacity in the New Zealand racing industry in 2004. In 2004, more than one million people attended race meetings in New Zealand. There are 69 Thoroughbred and 51 harness clubs licensed in New Zealand. Racecourses are situated in 59 locations throughout New Zealand.

The bloodstock industry is important to New Zealand, with the export sale of horses – mainly to Australia and Asia – generating more than $120 million a year. During the 2008–09 racing season 19 New Zealand bred horses won 22 Group One races around the world.

Notable thoroughbred racehorses from New Zealand include Carbine, Nightmarch, Sunline, Desert Gold and Rising Fast. Phar Lap and Tulloch were both bred in New Zealand but did not race there.

The most famous New Zealand standardbred horse is probably Cardigan Bay. Stanley Dancer drove the New Zealand bred horse, Cardigan Bay to win $1 million in stakes in 1968, the first harness horse to surpass that milestone in American history. Other horses of note include Young Quinn, Christian Cullen, Lazarus and the trotter Lyell Creek.

===Africa===
====Mauritius====
On 25 June 1812, the Champ de Mars Racecourse was inaugurated by The Mauritius Turf Club which was founded earlier in the same year by Colonel Edward A. Draper. The Champ de Mars is situated on a prestigious avenue in Port Louis, the capital city and is the oldest racecourse in the southern hemisphere. The Mauritius Turf Club is the second oldest active turf club in the world.

Undeniably, racing is one of the most popular sports in Mauritius now attracting regular crowds of 20,000 people or more to the only racecourse of the island.

A high level of professionalism has been attained in the organization of races over the last decades preserving the unique electrifying ambiance prevailing on race days at the Champ de Mars.

Members of the British royal family, such as Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Margaret or Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother have attended or patronized races at the Champ de Mars numerous times.

Champ de Mars has four classic events a year such as the Duchess of York Cup, the Barbé Cup, the Maiden Cup, and the Duke of York Cup.

Most of the horses are imported from South Africa but some are also acquired from Australia, the United Kingdom and France.

====South Africa====
Horse racing is a popular sport in South Africa that can be traced back to 1797. The first recorded race club meeting took place five years later in 1802. The national horse racing body is known as the National Horseracing Authority and was founded in 1882. The premier event, which attracts 50,000 people to Durban, is the Durban July Handicap, which has been run since 1897 at Greyville Racecourse. It is the largest and most prestigious event on the continent, with betting running into the hundreds of millions of Rands. Several July winners have gone on to win major international races, such as Colorado King, London News, and Ipi Tombe. However, the other notable major races are the Summer Cup, held at Turffontein Racecourse in Johannesburg, and The Sun Met, which is held at Kenilworth race track in Cape Town.

===Asia===
====China====

Horse racing in one form or another has been a part of Chinese culture for millennia. Horse racing was a popular pastime for the aristocracy at least by the Zhou dynasty – 4th century B.C. General Tian Ji&#x27;s stratagem for a horse race remains perhaps the best-known story about horse racing in that period. In the 18th and 19th centuries, horse racing and equestrian sports in China was dominated by Mongol influences.

Thoroughbred horse racing came to China with British settlements in the middle 1800s and most notably centered around the treaty ports, including the two major race courses in Shanghai, the Shanghai Racecourse and the International Recreation Grounds (in Kiang-wan), and the racecourses of Tianjin. The Kiang-wan racecourse was destroyed in the lead-up to the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Shanghai Race Club closed in 1954. The former Shanghai Racecourse is now People&#x27;s Square and People&#x27;s Park and the former club building was the Shanghai Art Museum.

As Hong Kong and Macau are Special Administrative Region, they&#x27;re allowed to exemption from ban of gambling on mainland China. (See below)

Horse racing was banned in the Republic of China from 1945, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China maintained the ban after 1949, although allowances were made for ethnic minority peoples for whom horse sports are a cultural tradition. Speed horse racing (速度赛马) was an event in the National Games of China, mainly introduced to cater to minority peoples, such as the Mongols. The racecourse was initially 5 km, but from 2005 (the 10th National Games) was extended to 12 km. The longer race led to deaths and injuries to participating horses in both 2005 and the 11th National Games in 2009. Also, with the entry into the sport of Han majority provinces such as Hubei, which are better funded and used Western, rather than traditional, breeding and training techniques, meant that the original purpose of the event to foster traditional horse racing for groups like the Mongols was at risk of being usurped. At the 2009 National Games, Hubei won both the gold and silver medals, with Inner Mongolia winning bronze. As a result of these factors, the event was abolished for the 12th National Games in 2013.

Club horse racing reappeared on a small scale in the 1990s. In 2008, the China Speed Horse Race Open in Wuhan was organized as the qualification round for the speed horse race event at the National Games the next year, but was also seen by commentators as a step towards legalizing both horse racing and gambling on the races. The Wuhan Racecourse was the only racecourse that organized races in China. In 2014, the Wuhan Jockey Club organized more than 80 races. Almost all Chinese trainers and jockeys stabled in Wuhan. However, with the demise of the event at the National Games and the government not relenting from the ban on commercial racing, various racecourses built in recent years are all in a state of disuse: The Nanjing Racecourse, which previously hosted National Games equestrian events, is now used as a car park; the Beijing Jockey Club was shut down in 2008. The racecourse in Inner Mongolia has not been active since 2012.

Horse racing eventually returned to mainland China on the year 2014 as the one-day, five-card event for foreign horses, trainers and jockeys. Standardized horse racing events have gradually emerged in China.

====Hong Kong====

The British tradition of horse racing left its mark with the creation of one of the most important entertainment and gambling institutions in Hong Kong. Established as the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club in 1884, the non-profit organization conducts nearly 700 races every season at the two race tracks: in Happy Valley and Sha Tin.

All horses are imported. Hong Kong has no breeding industry. The sport annually draws millions of dollars of tax revenue. Off-track betting is available from overseas bookmakers.

In the 1920s, the Hong Kong Jockey Club had race meetings for visitors already. Visitors were divided into public and member. The charges for these two types of visitors are different.

The charge for admission to the Public Enclosure is $1 per day for all while soldiers and sailors can enjoy half price. On the other hand, members are required to show their badges to obtain admission to the Members&#x27; Enclosure. And also the charge for admission to the Members&#x27; Enclosure is $2 per day. By comparing the lowest wage in 1929, we observe that the lowest wage is around $12 ( $0.4 per day) which has a large distance for the requirement enclosure. Therefore, we can observe that the race meetings are mainly opened for upper class mostly while grass-root has a lower chance to touch horse racing activity.

Nowadays, the Hong Kong Jockey Club is a cornerstone of modern Hong Kong. It donates all its profits to the Hong Kong government, charities and public institutions. It is the territory&#x27;s largest taxpayer, contributing 11% of the government&#x27;s revenues in 2000. In economic terms, the Hong Kong Jockey Club is an old-fashioned government-protected monopoly; all other forms of gambling are illegal in this industry.

===== Hong Kong—Sweepstakes =====

Sweepstakes were introduced in Hong Kong during the 1920s. There are three types of sweepstakes which are the Special Cash Sweeps, the Last Race Sweep and the Ordinary Cash Sweeps. Special Cash Sweeps were at first drawn twice a year, and increased to three times a year later given its popularity. It carried the highest prize money amongst three types of sweepstakes. The Last Race Sweep commanded higher prize money then Ordinary Cash Sweeps, which were drawn for almost every race and therefore carried the lowest prize money.

Sweepstakes could be purchased either at sweepstakes stations or from sweepstakes vendors throughout Hong Kong. With different numbers print on each sweepstake, one sweepstake is drawn and assigned, for each horse participating in the race, and the sweepstake attached to the winning horse would win the first prize. Likewise, the number of the first runner-up and second runner-up would win the second and third prize, respectively, with the rest winning consolation prizes. With the introduction of new bet types in horse racing and the launch of the Mark Six lottery in the 1970s, the club finally stopped selling sweepstakes in 1977.

====Macau====
Jockey Club of Macau was established for harness racing. It started to conduct horse races in 1989.

====India====
India&#x27;s first racecourse was set up in Madras in 1777, Guindy race course. Today India has nine racetracks operated by seven racing authorities.

====Japan====

Japan has two governing bodies that control its horseracing – the Japan Racing Association (JRA), and National Association of Racing (NAR). Between them they conduct more than 21,000 horse races a year. The JRA is responsible for horseracing events at ten major racecourses in metropolitan areas, while the NAR is responsible for various local horseracing events throughout Japan. Racing in Japan is mainly flat racing, but Japan also has jump racing and a sled-pulling race known as Ban&#x27;ei (also called Draft Racing).

Japan&#x27;s top stakes races are run in the spring, autumn, and winter. These include the country&#x27;s most prominent race – the Grade 1 Japan Cup, a 2,400 m (about 1½ mile) invitational turf race run every November at Tokyo Racecourse for a purse of ¥476  million (about US$5.6 million), one of the richest turf races in the world. Other noted stakes races include the February Stakes, Japanese Derby, Takamatsunomiya Kinen, Yasuda Kinen, Takarazuka Kinen, Arima Kinen, Satsuki Sho, Kikka Sho, and the Tenno Sho races run in the spring and fall. Japan&#x27;s top jump race is the Nakayama Grand Jump, run every April at Nakayama Racecourse.

====Malaysia====
In Malaysia, horse racing was introduced during the British colonial era and remains to the present day as a gambling activity. There are three race courses in Peninsular Malaysia, namely Penang Turf Club, Perak Turf Club, and Selangor Turf Club. Within and only within the turf clubs, betting on horse racing is a legal form of gambling. Racing in Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore is conducted and governed under the Rules of the Malayan Racing Association and betting in Malaysia is operated and organized by Pan Malaysian Pools Sdn Bhd. In East Malaysia, races are governed independently by the Royal Sabah Turf Club and the Sarawak Turf Club.

====Mongolia====
Mongolian horse racing takes place during the Naadam festival. Mongolia does not have Thoroughbred horse racing. Rather, it has its own Mongolian style of horse racing in which the horses run for at least a distance of 25 kilometers.

====Pakistan====
Horse races are held in Pakistan at four clubs. In Lahore at Lahore Race Club, Rawalpindi at Chakri, in Karachi at Karachi Race Club, and in Gujrat at Gujrat Race Club.

====Philippines====

Horseracing in the Philippines began in 1867. The history of Philippine horseracing has three divisions according to the breeds of horses used. They are the Philippine-pony era (1867–1898), the Arabian-horse era (1898–1930), and the Thoroughbred-era (1935–present).

====Singapore====
Horse racing was introduced to Singapore by the British in 1843, and remained one of the legal forms of gambling after independence. It was a highly popular form of entertainment with the local Singaporean community for 181 years. Races were typically held on Friday evenings and Sundays at the Singapore Turf Club in Kranji. Horse racing also left its mark in the naming of roads in Singapore such as Race Course Road in Little India, where horse racing was first held in Singapore, and Turf Club Road in Bukit Timah where Singapore Turf Club used to be situated before moving to its final location in 1999. In-person attendance at horse races declined dramatically during the 2010s, and after the Covid-19 pandemic the 30,000-seat grandstand was regularly filled to less than 10% capacity. The racetrack was finally closed in October 2024, its land reclaimed by the government to make way for public housing.
====South Korea====

Horse racing in South Korea dates back to May 1898, when a foreign language institute run by the government included a donkey race in its athletic rally. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the 1920s that modern horse racing involving betting developed. The nation&#x27;s first authorised club, the Chosun Racing Club, was established in 1922 and a year later, the pari-mutuel betting system was officially adopted for the first time.

The Korean War disrupted the development of horse racing in the country, but after the Seoul Olympics in 1988, the Olympic Equestrian Park was converted into racing facilities named Seoul Race Park, which helped the sport to develop again.

====Turkey====
Horses have been an important role in Turks&#x27; lives throughout history. After the modern Republic Of Turkey was established in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the number of breeding and racing Arabian and thoroughbred racehorses accelerated rapidly, especially after the beginning of the 1930s. The Jockey Club of Turkey, founded in 1950, was the turning point of both the Turkish breeding and racing industries.

====United Arab Emirates====
The big race in the UAE is the Dubai World Cup, a race with a purse of US$12 million, which was the largest purse in the world until being surpassed by the Saudi Cup, a race in Riyadh with a $20  million purse that held its first edition in 2020. Other races include the Dubai Kahayla Classic with a purse of US$250,000.

The Meydan Racecourse in Dubai, reportedly the world&#x27;s largest race track, opened on March 27, 2010, for the Dubai World Cup race. The race track complex contains two tracks with seating for 60,000, a hotel, restaurants, theater and a museum.

There is no parimutuel betting in the UAE as gambling is illegal.

===South America===
====Argentina====
In Argentina the sport is known as turf. Some of the most famous racers are Irineo Leguisamo, Vilmar Sanguinetti, Marina Lezcano, Jorge Valdivieso, Pablo Falero and Jorge Ricardo. The most notable Argentine horse of recent decades is Invasor, who won Uruguay&#x27;s Triple Crown in 2005; won four U.S. Grade I races in 2006, including the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic, on his way to being named that country&#x27;s Horse of the Year; and ended his racing career in 2007 with two more Grade I/Group One wins, including the Dubai World Cup.

Carlos Gardel&#x27;s tango Por una cabeza is about horse racing, a sport of which he was a known fan. Gardel was a good friend of Irineo Leguisamo, who is the most recognized Uruguayan jockey, who raced numerous years in Argentine.

==Betting==

At many horse races, there is a gambling station, where gamblers can stake money on a horse. Gambling on horses is prohibited at some tracks; Springdale Race Course, home of the nationally renowned TD Bank Carolina Cup and Colonial Cup Steeplechase in Camden, South Carolina, is known as one of the tracks where betting is illegal, due to a 1951 law. Where gambling is allowed, most tracks offer parimutuel betting where gamblers&#x27; money is pooled and shared proportionally among the winners once a deduction is made from the pool. In some countries, such as the UK, Ireland, and Australia, an alternative and more popular facility is provided by bookmakers who effectively make a market in odds. This allows the gambler to &#x27;lock in&#x27; odds on a horse at a particular time (known as &#x27;taking the price&#x27; in the UK). Parimutuel gambling on races also provides not only purse money to participants but considerable tax revenue, with over $100 billion wagered annually in 53 countries.

== Deaths and injuries ==
Anna Waller, a member of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of North Carolina, co-authored a four-year-long study of jockey injuries and stated to &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;For every 1,000 jockeys you have riding [for one year], over 600 will have medically treated injuries.&quot; She added that almost 20% of these were serious head or neck injuries. The study reported 6,545 injuries during the years 1993–1996. More than 100 jockeys were killed in the United States between 1950 and 1987.

Horses also face dangers in racing. 1.5 horses die out of every 1,000 starts in the United States. The U.S. Jockey Club in New York estimates that about 600 horses died at racetracks in 2006. The Jockey Club in Hong Kong reported a far lower figure of 0.58 horses per 1,000 starts. There is speculation that drugs used in horse racing in the United States, which are banned elsewhere, are responsible for the higher death rate in the United States.

In the Canadian province of Ontario, a study of 1,709 racehorse deaths between 2003 and 2015 found that the majority of deaths were attributable to &quot;damage during exercise to the horses&#x27; musculoskeletal system&quot;, including fractures, dislocations, and tendon ruptures. Mortality rates were eight times higher for thoroughbreds than standardbreds, and highest amongst young horses. The study also found that the incidence of off-track deaths was twice as high for thoroughbreds.

In the United Kingdom, 186 horses were killed as a direct result of racing in 2019. Of these 145 died in National Hunt (jump) racing and 41 in flat racing. A report published in 2005 estimated that &quot;around 375 horses who are entered into races each season die from their injuries, or they are killed because they are considered of no further commercial value, even though they are young enough to continue racing.&quot; It added, &quot;Reasons for horses being destroyed include broken legs, back, neck and pelvis; fatal spinal injuries, exhaustion, heart attack, and burst blood vessels in the lungs.&quot;

<text>James Edward Rice (born March 8, 1953) is an American former professional baseball left fielder and designated hitter who played in Major League Baseball (MLB). Rice played his entire 16-year MLB career for the Boston Red Sox. In 2009, Rice was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Rice was an eight-time American League (AL) All-Star and was named the AL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player in after becoming the first major league player in 19 years to hit for 400 total bases. He went on to become the ninth player to lead the major leagues in total bases in consecutive seasons. He joined Ty Cobb as one of two players to lead the AL in total bases three consecutive seasons. He batted above .300 seven times during his 16 season career, and collected 100+ runs batted in (RBI) eight times. Rice also had 200 hits in four seasons, and 20+ home runs 11 times. He also led the league in home runs three times, RBIs and slugging percentage twice each, and averaged more than 117 hits for every 100 regular season MLB games he had played in during his career. Between 1975 and 1986, Rice led all major league players in hits, RBIs and total bases, as well as all AL players in home runs and runs scored.

From 1975 through 1980 he was part of one of the sport&#x27;s great outfields along with Fred Lynn and Dwight Evans (who was his teammate for his entire career); Rice continued the tradition of his predecessors Ted Williams and Carl Yastrzemski as a power-hitting left fielder who played his entire career for the Red Sox. He ended his career with a .502 slugging percentage, and then ranked tenth in AL history with 382 home runs; his career marks in homers, hits (2,452), RBI (1,451) and total bases (4,129) remain Red Sox records for a right-handed hitter, with Evans eventually surpassing his Boston records for career runs scored, at bats and extra base hits by a right-handed hitter. When Rice retired, his 1,503 career games in left field ranked seventh in AL history.

==Notable seasons==
In the minor leagues, Rice&#x27;s three-run home run was the key blow in helping the Pawtucket Red Sox (International League) defeat the Tulsa Oilers (American Association) in a 5–2 win in the 1973 Junior World Series. After he was AAA&#x27;s International League Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player and Triple Crown winner in 1974, he and fellow rookie teammate Fred Lynn were brought up to the Red Sox at the same time, and were known as the &quot;Gold Dust Twins&quot;. 

Rice was promoted in the Red Sox organization to be a full-time player in 1975, and finished in second place for the American League&#x27;s Rookie of the Year honors, and third in the Most Valuable Player voting, after he finished the season with 174 base hits, 102 runs batted in, a .309 batting average and 22 home runs; Lynn won both awards. The Red Sox won the AL&#x27;s East Division, but Rice did not play in either the League Championship Series or World Series because of a wrist injury sustained in the last week of the regular season when he was hit by a pitch. The Red Sox went on to lose the World Series four games to three to the Cincinnati Reds of the National League (NL).

When the 1977 season ended, Rice found himself leading the AL in three different offensive categories. His 39 home runs was tops in the league; the first time he led the league in this statistic. He also led the league with a .593 slugging average and 392 total bases, the most by an AL player in 39 years.

In 1978, Rice won the American League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award in a campaign where he hit .315 (third in the league) and led the league in home runs (46), RBI (139), hits (213), triples (15), total bases (406, and slugging percentage (.600). Altogether he led the AL in 11 different categories that season, one shy of tying the Major league record of 12 set in 1921 by Rogers Hornsby. Rice is also one of two AL players ever to lead his league in triples and home runs in the same season. He also remains the only player to lead the major leagues in triples, home runs and RBIs in the same season. His 406 total bases that year is still a Red Sox record, and was the most in the AL since Joe DiMaggio had 418 in 1937. He was the first major leaguer with 400 or more total bases since Hank Aaron in 1959. This feat was not repeated until 1997, when Larry Walker had 409 in the NL. No AL player has done it since Rice in 1978, and his total remains the third highest by an AL right-handed hitter, behind DiMaggio and Jimmie Foxx (438 in ).

Rice had another superb season in 1979. Beside having his third season with over 200 hits, he had finished in the top three in eight different AL batting categories. He finished third in runs scored and second in home runs, RBIs, hits, slugging average, runs created, and extra base hits. He also led the league in total bases for the third straight time, and had the fourth-highest AL Batting Average. He is the only player in MLB history with three consecutive years of having at least 200 hits and 39 home runs while batting at least .315 in each of those years.
At the end of the 1983 season Rice led the AL in four categories including home runs, RBIs, total bases, and grounding into double plays. He had tied Milwaukee Brewers player George Scott&#x27;s (1975) record and became the second player to lead the AL in those categories in the same season. In 2012 Miguel Cabrera, a Detroit Tiger, became the third AL player to reach this mark; no NL player has ever led that league in these three categories in the same year.

In 1986, Rice had 200 hits, batted .324, and had 110 RBIs. The Red Sox made it to the World Series for the second time during his career. This time, Rice played in all 14 postseason games, where he collected 14 hits, including two home runs. He also scored 14 runs and drove in six. His 14 runs scored is the fifth most by an individual during a single year&#x27;s postseason play. The Red Sox went on to lose the World Series to the New York Mets, four games to three, the fourth consecutive Series appearance by Boston which they lost in seven games.

==Career accomplishments==

Rice led the AL in home runs three times (1977, 1978, 1983), in RBIs twice (1978, 1983), in slugging percentage twice (1977, 1978), and in total bases four times (1977–1979, 1983). In fact, his 1157 total bases over the three consecutive seasons leading the league ties him for seventh place with Rogers Hornsby and is five total bases shy of Babe Ruth&#x27;s three year mark of 1162 total bases. Rice nad also picked up Silver Slugger Awards in 1983 and 1984 (the award was created in 1980). Rice hit at least 39 home runs in a season four times, had eight 100-RBI seasons and four seasons with over 200 hits, and batted over .300 seven times. He finished his MLB career with a .298 batting average, 373 doubles, 79 triples, 382 home runs, 1,451 RBIs, 1,249 runs scored, 2,452 hits, 670 walks, and 4,129 total bases. He was an American League All-Star eight times (1977–1980, 1983–1986). In addition to winning the American League MVP award in 1978, he finished in the top five in MVP voting five other times (1975, 1977, 1979, 1983, 1986).

Rice is the only player in history to lead the league in home runs, RBIs, and triples in the same year. He is also the only player in major league history to record over 200 hits while hitting 39 or more home runs for three consecutive years. He is tied for the AL record of leading the league in total bases for three straight seasons, and was one of three AL players to have three straight seasons of hitting at least 39 home runs while batting .315 or higher. 

During his most productive 12-season span from 1975 to 1986, Rice collectively led all American League players in total games played, at bats, runs scored, hits, homers, RBIs, slugging percentage, total bases, extra base hits, go-ahead RBIs, multi-hit games, and outfield assists. Among all other MLB players, including those in the National League, Rice was the leader in five of the above 12 categories (Mike Schmidt is next on the leader board; he led in four).

In 1984 Rice set a major league single-season record by hitting into 36 double plays. On the backside of a 1964 Topps baseball card of Earl Wilson No. 503, Goose Goslin who got his start in 1921, was credited with grounding into 48 double plays in a season during his career. Rice&#x27;s 315 career double plays grounded into ranks him tied in eighth place on the career leaders list with Eddie Murray. However, this mark was not followed closely until the mid to late 1930s. Rice did break Brooks Robinson&#x27;s AL record for a right-handed hitter (297) in 1988. Cal Ripken Jr. eventually surpassed this mark in 1999. Rice had led the league for four seasons (1982–1985), which tied the major league record that had been established by Ernie Lombardi. In 2009 Miguel Tejada recorded his fifth season leading his league in this category and now holds this record. During the time Rice was the annual GDP leader he also had averaged 112 RBI&#x27;s per season which is ten RBI&#x27;s better than second place Albert Pujols RBI average of 102 following his four-year GDP leadership. The on-base prowess of Rice&#x27;s teammates placed him in a double play situation over 2,000 times during his career. Rice posted a batting average of .310 and slugging percentage of .515 in those situations which is better than his overall career marks in those categories.
During his career Rice played in 35 games where he hit two or more HRs, and drove in four or more runs in a game 48 times. He could hit for both power and average, and currently only 12 other retired players rank ahead of him in both career home runs and batting average: Hank Aaron, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, Willie Mays, Stan Musial, Mel Ott, Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Chipper Jones, Vladimir Guerrero, Mike Piazza, and Larry Walker. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;.

Rice was an accomplished left fielder, finishing his career with a fielding percentage of .980 and 137 outfield assists (comparable to Ted Williams&#x27; figures of .974 and 140). Although he did not possess great speed, he had a strong throwing arm and was able to master the various caroms that balls took from the Green Monster (in left field) in Fenway Park. His 21 assists in 1983 remains the most by a Red Sox outfielder since 1944, when Bob Johnson had 23. Aside from playing 1,543 games as an outfielder during his career, Rice also appeared as a designated hitter in 530 games.

Rice&#x27;s number 14 was retired by the Red Sox in a pre-game ceremony on July 28, 2009.

==Community activities==
Rice was associated with a variety of charitable organizations during his career, primarily on behalf of children, some of which carried on into his retirement. He was named an honorary chairman of The Jimmy Fund, the fundraising arm of the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, in 1979, and in 1992 was awarded that organization&#x27;s &quot;Jimmy Award,&quot; which honors individuals who demonstrate their dedication to cancer research. Rice is also active in his support of the Neurofibromatosis Foundation of New England. Rice&#x27;s involvement with Major League Baseball&#x27;s RBI program (Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities) resulted in the naming of a new youth baseball facility in Roxbury, Massachusetts, in his honor in 1999. A youth recreation center in Rice&#x27;s hometown of Anderson, South Carolina, is also named in his honor.

During a nationally televised game on August 7, 1982, Rice rushed into the stands to help a young boy who was struck in the head by a line drive off the bat of Dave Stapleton. Rice left the dugout and entered the stands to help four-year-old Jonathan Keane, who was bleeding heavily. Rice carried the boy onto the field, through the Red Sox dugout, and into the clubhouse, where he was immediately treated by the team&#x27;s medical staff. Rice&#x27;s swift response likely saved Keane&#x27;s life, as paramedics would likely not have arrived in time. Rice also paid the hospital bill, and Keane made a full recovery from the injury.

==Retirement activities==
In 1990, Rice agreed to play with the St. Petersburg Pelicans of the short-lived Senior Professional Baseball Association. Afterwards, Rice has served as a roving batting coach (1992–1994), and hitting instructor(1995–2000), and remains an instructional batting coach (2001–present) with the Red Sox organization. While the Red Sox hitting coach, the team led the league in hitting in 1997 and players won two batting titles. Rice was the hitting coach for the American League in the 1997 and 1999 Major League Baseball All-Star Games, both under the same manager, the New York Yankees&#x27; Joe Torre. Since 2003, he&#x27;s also been employed as a commentator for the New England Sports Network (NESN), where he contributes to the Red Sox pre-game and post-game shows. He had a cameo appearance in the NESN movie &quot;Wait Till This Year&quot; and in the film &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;. The former slugger has been known to pass his wisdom on to the current Sox players and stars from time to time. Rice was elected to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame when it first opened in 1995, and he is the 40th member of Ted Williams&#x27; Museum and Hitters Hall of Fame, having been inducted along with Paul Molitor, Dave Winfield and Robin Yount in 2001. On November 29, 2008, the Boston chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) announced that Rice would be the recipient of the Emil Fuchs Award for long and meritorious service to baseball.

During his Hall of Fame acceptance speech Rice revealed that he is a devoted fan of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, noting that he was watching the show when he was informed of his election into Cooperstown.

==Hall of Fame==
While Rice was generally regarded as one of the better hitters of his era based upon the statistics traditionally used by the BBWAA to evaluate players&#x27; Hall of Fame qualifications, he was not elected until his 15th and final year of eligibility, netting 76.4% of the votes, in 2009. Over the years he was on the BBWAA ballot, he received 3,974 total votes, the most ever collected by any player voted on for baseball&#x27;s highest honor. In 2006 and 2007, he received over 63% of votes cast. Rice just missed being elected in 2008 when the count found him on 72.2% of the ballots, only 2.8% short of the required 75%. Rice became the ninth enshrinee inducted into the Hall of Fame on his last chance on the BBWWAA ballot, and it was the first since Ralph Kiner (1975). Larry Walker, Edgar Martinez, and Tim Raines were since enshrined after they had appeared on the ballot for their final time.

Rice&#x27;s delay in being elected to the Hall of Fame stemmed in part from more current statistical analysis of player performance. This analysis suggested that Rice&#x27;s HOF credentials might have been more questionable than they were considered during his career. The delay may also have been related to his often difficult relationship with the media during his playing career, many of whom are still voting members of the BBWAA, and his career fading relatively early – he last played in the major leagues at the age of 36. Some writers, such as the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;&#x27;s Sean McAdam, said that Rice&#x27;s chances improved with the exposure of the &quot;Steroids Era&quot; in baseball. In the same article, McAdam expanded this subject by adding: &quot;In an era when power numbers are properly viewed with a healthy dose of suspicion, Rice&#x27;s production over the course of his 16 years gains additional stature.&quot; As such, he received increasingly more votes each year since the 2003 ballot, improving his vote totals by 133 votes over the last five years on the ballot. However, from several sabermetric standpoints it can be argued that Rice falls short of his peers in the Hall of Fame. Nevertheless, several commentators have noted that the continued criticism of Rice&#x27;s statistics not meeting sabermetric standards is unfair given that several other Hall of Fame players, notably Andre Dawson and Tony Pérez, fare even worse against such standards.

During the 2007 season, the Pawtucket Red Sox started a campaign to get Rice inducted which included having fans sign &quot;the World&#x27;s Largest Jim Rice Jersey.&quot;

Although other players have compiled career statistics similar to Rice&#x27;s, most notably 1999 Hall inductee Orlando Cepeda, perhaps the most similar player to Rice was 1968 inductee Joe Medwick. Both were power-hitting left fielders who batted right-handed, played their home games in stadiums which favored hitters, and had a period of a few years in which they enjoyed a remarkable burst of offense, each winning an MVP award at age 25 – Rice after collecting 400 total bases, and Medwick after becoming the last NL player to win the Triple Crown. Both retired at age 36 due to the cumulative effect of various minor injuries. Their career totals in games, at bats, runs, hits, RBI, steals, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, extra base hits, and total bases are all fairly similar, with notable differences only in batting average and home runs; Medwick&#x27;s higher average (.324 to .298) can be partially attributed to the higher emphasis on batting average in the 1930s, while Rice&#x27;s advantage in home runs (382 to 205) is largely the result of a dramatic increase in homers over the 40 years between their careers (Rice ranked 10th in AL history upon his retirement, while Medwick ranked 11th in NL history upon his). Medwick was elected to the Hall in his final season of eligibility in 1968, which Rice also duplicated.

<doc id="74724" wikidata="Q5905908" url="?curid=74724" title="Horse racing in Great Britain">
<text>Horse racing is the second largest spectator sport in Great Britain, and one of the longest established, with a history dating back many centuries. According to a report by the British Horseracing Authority it generates £3.39 billion total direct and indirect expenditure in the British economy, of which £1.05 billion is from core racing industry expenditure, and the major horse racing events such as Royal Ascot and Cheltenham Festival are important dates in the British and international sporting and society calendar.

The sport has taken place in the country since Roman times and many of the sport&#x27;s traditions and rules originated there. The Jockey Club, established in 1750, codified the &quot;Rules of Racing&quot; and one of its members, Admiral Rous laid the foundations of the handicapping system for horse racing, including the weight-for-age scale. Britain is also home to racecourses including Newmarket, Ascot and Cheltenham and races including The Derby at Epsom, The Grand National and Cheltenham Gold Cup. Great Britain has also produced some of the greatest jockeys, including Fred Archer, Sir Gordon Richards and Lester Piggott.

Britain has also historically been a hugely important centre for thoroughbred racehorse breeding. In fact all racehorses are called English Thoroughbred, the breed having been created in England. All modern thoroughbred racehorses can trace a line back to three foundation sires which were imported to Britain in the late 17th/early 18th centuries and the General Stud Book first published by James Weatherby still records details of every horse in the breed.

Gambling on horseraces has been one of the cornerstones of the British betting industry and the relationship between the two has historically been one of mutual dependence. The betting industry is an important funder of horse racing in Great Britain, through the betting levy administered by the Horserace Betting Levy Board and through media rights negotiated by racecourses and betting shops.
==Types of racing==
There are two main forms of horse racing in Great Britain. 
* Flat racing, which is run over distances between 5 furlongs and 2 miles 5 furlongs 159 yards on courses without obstacles
* National Hunt racing, races run over distances between 2 miles and miles, where horses usually jump either hurdles or fences (races known as steeplechases). There is also a category of National Hunt races known as National Hunt flat races, which are run under National Hunt rules, but where no obstacles are jumped.

Collectively, the above racing is often referred to as racing &quot;under rules&quot;, since there is another form of racing which is run on an altogether more informal and &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis, known as point-to-point racing. Point-to-point is a form of steeplechasing for amateur riders.

All the above forms of the sport are run under the auspices of the governing and regulatory body for horse racing in Great Britain, the British Horseracing Authority. with the exception of point-to-pointing which is administered by the Point-to-Point Authority with the BHA taking on regulatory functions. There is also a limited amount of harness racing which takes place under the auspices of the British Harness Racing Society and Arabian racing which takes place under the auspices of the Arabian Racing Organisation.

==History==

===Roman era to Middle Ages===
Horses were used as beasts of burden in pre-Roman times, but it is thought that the first horse races to take place in Britain were organised by soldiers of the Roman Empire in Yorkshire around 200 AD, although whether the Romans actually introduced the sport is a matter of conjecture. It is believed that Romans at the encampment at Wetherby matched horses against Arabian horses brought to England by Emperor Septimius Severus. Traces of racecourses dating to the Roman occupation exist, but records are scarce.

The Venerable Bede reports that the English began to saddle their horses about the year 631.
The earliest written mention of &quot;running-horses&quot; is a record of Hugh, from the French House of Capet, gifting some as a present to King Athelstan of England in the 9th/10th century. During Athelstan&#x27;s reign a ban was placed on the export of English horses, such was supposed to be their superiority to continental ones. Continental ones were still permitted for import, and many were brought to England by William the Conqueror. Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury introduced Spanish stallions to the country.

The first recorded race meetings were during the reign of Henry II at Smithfield, London, during the annual St Bartholomew&#x27;s horse fair. The event is attested by William Fitzstephen writing at some time after 1174 and the poet Drayton. 
During the Crusades, horse-breeding improved and horseback contests were popular, but in the form of tournaments, rather than races. King John established a stud at Eltham, Kent and the Middle English romance Sir Bevis of Hampton has couplets which refer to races taking place in the time of Richard I.

For the next three centuries there are numerous records of Kings of England keeping &#x27;running horses&#x27;. Edward III bought horses at £13 6s 8d each, and was also gifted two by the King of Navarre. The royal stud continued to grow throughout the reign of Henry VII.

===16th Century===
Records become more substantial during the time of Henry VIII. He passed a number of laws relating to the breeding of horses and also imported a large number of stallions and mares for breeding from Spain, Italy and the East. He kept a training establishment at Greenwich and the stud at Eltham. and founded the Royal Paddock at Hampton Court, where he kept mares and a &quot;Barb worth his weight in silver&quot;, which has been given to him by the Marquis of Mantua.

Formal race meetings began to be instigated too. It is believed that the first occurrence of a trophy being presented to the winner of a race was in 1512 by organisers of a fair in Chester and was a small wooden ball decorated with flowers. Meanwhile, the oldest horse race still in existence, the Kiplingcotes Derby was first run in 1519. The Carlisle Bells, reputedly the oldest sporting trophy in the world, were first competed for in the 16th century, in a race that still bears their name. One of the bells is inscribed &quot;The sweftes horse thes bel tak&quot; (&quot;The swiftest horse takes this bell&quot;).

Racing was firmly established at Chester, the oldest surviving racecourse in England, by 1540. By the time of Elizabeth, the sport was a &quot;common amusement&quot;, and the Queen herself is recorded as attending races on Salisbury Plain in the 1580s, as well as keeping up the paddocks at Hampton and founding her own at Blackheath. Racing in the Forest of Galtres dates to 1590, Leith Races were established by 1591, and at Doncaster by 1595.

===17th century===
During Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, interest in horse racing appears to have waned, for reasons unrecorded, but this changed when in 1605, James I discovered the little village of Newmarket whilst out hawking or riding. He began to spend time there racing horses, and from then on it has been known as the home of horse racing in England. In fact, James spent so much time there that the House of Commons petitioned him to concentrate more of his time on running the country. The region has had a long association with horses going back to the time of Boudica and the Iceni. The first recorded race there was a match for £100 between horses owned by Lord Salisbury and Marquess of Buckingham in 1622, and the racecourse was founded in 1636.

Chester continued to be a centre of the sport and by 1609 there are records of the St George&#x27;s race being run five time round the &quot;Roody&quot; for a prize of silver bells and a sum of money. The first known Rules of Racing date from Kiplingcotes in 1619. Race meetings began to spring up elsewhere in the country. Races were run for silver bells at Gatherley, near Richmond in Yorkshire, Croydon and Theobalds on Enfield Chase. Jockey weights began to be measured and rigorously enforced, and formal training of horses took place, paying attention to food and exercise.

James VI and I encouraged the sport. Some of the Spanish horses that ended up in Galloway after the wrecking of the Spanish Armada were kept by local people and raced against the King&#x27;s own horses when he was in Ireland. They proved better than the King&#x27;s and were bought for the royal stables. The King supported several meetings, even acting as Clerk of the Course at Lincoln in 1607 and built a house at Newmarket as a hunting lodge and so he could enjoy the racing there. Private match races between gentlemen, riding their own horses, rather than using hired jockeys as became the norm later, became commons.

Around the time that Charles I of England came to the throne, Spring and Autumn race meetings were introduced to Newmarket and in 1634 the first Gold Cup event was held. Charles gave a 100 guinea silver cup to be raced for at Hyde Park, and instituted a silver plate at Newmarket. Meetings at Stamford and Epsom were now well established.

All horse racing was then banned in 1654 by Oliver Cromwell, and many horses were requisitioned by the state. Despite this Cromwell himself kept a stud running of his own. With the restoration of Charles II racing flourished and he instituted the Newmarket Town Plate in 1664, writing the rules himself:

William III founded a riding academy and gave plates to be ridden for in many parts of the country. Between 1695 and 1702, he ran his own horses at Newmarket, including in a 2000 guinea match against the Duke of Somerset. The influential Tregonwell Frampton, known as the &quot;Father of the Turf&quot; was keeper of William&#x27;s horses, and performed the same task for Queen Anne, George I and possibly Charles II and James II. He did much to improve the breed.

The three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred, the Byerley Turk, Darley Arabian and Godolphin Barb were imported to England in the late 17th and early 18th centuries and founded the lines which can be traced down to every modern thoroughbred racehorse. At this point, they weren&#x27;t the only influential sires. Others, including the grey Barb donated by the King to a Mr Hutton, and known as Hutton&#x27;s Grey Barb contributed importantly to the breed.
 The improvement of the breed was not purely for sporting purposes though. Warfare and conquest were also factors. As Whyte noted, &quot;to the excellence of the British horse... may be ascribed much of our superiority over other nations, both in commerce and in war.&quot;

===18th century===
In the early 18th century, Queen Anne kept a large string of horses and was instrumental in the founding of Royal Ascot where the opening race each year is still called the Queen Anne Stakes. The first published account of race results was John Cheney&#x27;s &quot;Historical list of all the Horse Matches run, and all plates and prizes run for in England and Wales&quot; which dates to 1727. The Weatherby family succeeded Cheney as the keepers of the most complete set of racing records, and in a later work which came into their possession, published in York in 1748, the result is recorded of a race run in September 1709 on Clifton and Rawcliffe Ings, near York, for a gold cup of £50.

In 1740, Parliament introduced an act &quot;to restrain and to prevent the excessive increase in horse racing&quot;; this was largely ignored and in the 1750 the Jockey Club was formed to create and apply the Rules of Racing. However, until the 1760s, individual horses seldom ran more than five or six times, due to the scarcity of prizes on offer, but this began to change with major race meetings expanding the prizes on offer. Newmarket and York led the way in this.

Races were still generally for mature horses, and were typically run in matches, or in best-of-three heats over long distances.
Three-year-old races were first run in 1731 and two-year-olds raced for the first time at Newmarket in 1769. In 1791, Cash became the first yearling to race, and beat a three-year-old in a match at Newmarket, in receipt of 3 stones.

Newmarket itself continued to grow as a centre of racing and many of the racecourse&#x27;s historic meetings (with persist to this day) were established in the 1760s and 1770s.

By the end of the century the 12th Earl of Derby and Sir Charles Bunbury were key influencers in the sport. Under their auspices the Derby and Oaks were established at Epsom, inspired by the St Leger and the growing popularity of shorter races, for younger horses. These races, along with the Leger and the Guineas at Newmarket (which were established early in the 19th century) became known as the Classics.

At around the same time, jockeys began to earn a reputation in their own right, with early pioneers including Frank Buckle, Sam Chifney Sr and Jem Robinson.

===19th century===

Interest in the sport was at a high throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. As Whyte&#x27;s History of the English Turf noted in 1840, &quot;For nearly a century and a half, the &quot;Turf&quot; has formed a favourite amusement of &quot;Kings, Lords and Commons&quot;. Or as Rice&#x27;s History reported in 1879, &quot;for some two hundred years the pursuit of Horse-racing has been attractive to more of our countrymen than any other out-door pastime&quot; Other traditional rural sports, including hawking, shooting and hare-hunting, had much diminished by this period, due to enclosure and &quot;gradual refinement of manners&quot; and racing was at its &quot;acme&quot;.

Handicap races, in which horses are assigned weights to carry in proportion to their ability, became popular from the turn of the 19th century onwards. The first had been run at Ascot in 1791 and others followed. Many have persisted to this day including the Chester Cup (from 1824), Northumberland Plate (1833), Cesarewitch and Cambridgeshire Handicaps at Newmarket (both 1839), Goodwood&#x27;s Stewards&#x27; Cup (1839), the Ebor at York (1843), the City and Suburban Handicap at Epsom (1851) and the traditional opener for the flat racing season, the Lincoln (1853).

Steeplechasing first became organised by Tom Colman at St Albans in the early 1830s. By the end of that decade, the Grand National had been established at Aintree by William Lynn.

In 1875, Sandown Park became the first racecourse to open a separate members&#x27; enclosure.

By the turn of the 20th century, it was said that &quot;time has only strengthened and confirmed the national passion for the sport.&quot; Concerns over its moral effects were prevalent though. An interest in horse racing and the attendant gambling was described as the &quot;offspring of a passion we should wish to disown&quot;, with a warning that &quot;the modern turf is fast becoming the very manor of the worst&quot;.

===20th century to date===

In 1947 Hamilton hosted the first evening race meeting in Great Britain. Now Wolverhampton Racecourse holds the most evening meetings, with nearly 50 a year.

The Jockey Club governed the sport until its governance role was handed to the British Horseracing Board, (formed in June 1993) and while the BHB became responsible for strategic planning, finance, politics, race planning, training and marketing, the Jockey Club continued to regulate the sport. In 2006 it formed the Horseracing Regulatory Authority to carry out the regulatory process whilst it focused on owning 13 racecourses and the gallops in Newmarket and Lambourn. In July 2007 the HRA merged with the BHB to form the British Horseracing Authority.

==Racecourses==

There are 60 licensed racecourses in Great Britain, with a further two in Northern Ireland (Down Royal and Downpatrick). Apart from Chelmsford City and Ffos Las (which opened in 2009), all the courses date back to 1927 or earlier. The oldest is Chester Racecourse, which dates to the early 16th century.

Unlike some other countries, which include the United States, racing in Britain usually takes place on turf. However, there are six courses which have all-weather tracks – Kempton Park, Lingfield, Southwell, Wolverhampton, Chelmsford City and Newcastle. Southwell&#x27;s surface is Fibresand. Wolverhampton installed a Tapeta surface in August 2014, replacing the existing Polytrack; Newcastle converted its Gosforth Park flat racing turf track to a Tapeta course with the addition of a floodlit all-weather straight mile in May 2016. All flat racing at Newcastle now takes place on the Tapeta surface with a turf course retained solely for a winter programme of jumps racing. The other three British all-weather tracks are all Polytrack. Ireland has a single all-weather Polytrack course at Dundalk. Courses also vary wildly in layout. There are very few which are regular ovals, as is the typical layout of other countries like the United States. Each course has its own idiosyncrasies, and horses are known to be more suited to some tracks than others, hence the idiom &quot;.&quot;

There are two main operating groups of British racecourses – Jockey Club Racecourses, which runs fifteen courses, and Arena Racing Company, which runs sixteen courses.

==Important races and meetings==

===Flat===

Britain is home to some of the world&#x27;s most important flat races and race meetings. While ancient horse races like the Kiplingcotes Derby and Newmarket Town Plate are now mainly curiosities, there are many older races which retain modern relevance. The five British Classics – the 1,000 Guineas, 2,000 Guineas, The Oaks, The Derby and the St. Leger – were founded in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and still represent the pinnacle of achievement for each generation of horses. The structure and distances of these races, if not the exact names, have been adopted by many other European horse racing authorities, such as Ireland. Royal Ascot is the major flat racing festival in Europe and attracts horses from all over the world. The modern flat season in Britain now also climaxes with British Champions Day, a festival of championship races, also held at Ascot.

===National Hunt===

In National Hunt racing, the Cheltenham Festival is the foremost jump racing festival in the world, and is an annual target for both British and Irish trainers. The festival hosts races such as the Cheltenham Gold Cup and Champion Hurdle, which are seen as the peak of their disciplines and over the years have been won by horses whose appeal has transcended the sport, including Kauto Star and Desert Orchid. More widely known still is the Grand National at Aintree, which despite being a very long and difficult race that is historically contested by a lower grade of horses than races at Cheltenham, has produced some of the sports equine superstars, like Red Rum. It has an estimated global audience of 600 million viewers.

===Major festivals===
==Media coverage==

===Newspapers===
British horse racing is served by a daily, national newspaper, the &quot;Racing Post&quot;, founded in 1986. This publication carries industry news, race cards for all British and Irish race meetings, tipping columns and betting information, as well as smaller sections on greyhound racing and general sport. There are also dedicated weekly publications including &quot;Racing Plus&quot; and monthly magazines such as &quot;Thoroughbred Owner &amp; Breeder&quot;. In addition, there is a limited amount of racing coverage in broader equestrian magazines, such as &quot;Horse &amp; Hound&quot;. Many national dailies also carry racing news and information in their sports pages.

At various times in history, there has been more than one racing daily, and fierce rivalries have existed between them. For most of the 20th century, the &quot;Sporting Life&quot; and &quot;Sporting Chronicle&quot; were the two competing papers, before the Manchester-based &quot;Chronicle&quot; closed in 1983 due to debts and falling circulation. The &quot;Racing Post&quot; was founded in 1986 to fill the gap and challenge the &quot;Sporting Life&quot; monopoly that resulted and these two were rivals throughout the 80s and 90s. Ultimately, only the &quot;Post&quot; survived as the owners of the &quot;Sporting Life&quot;, Trinity Mirror, closed the &quot;Life&quot; and took over the &quot;Racing Post&quot; trademark.

In the Victorian era, there was a wide range of sporting newspapers that carried racing news to a greater or lesser extent. These include &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life in London&quot; (forerunner to the Sporting Life), &quot;The Sporting Times&quot; and &quot;The Sportsman&quot; (not to be confused with the short-lived 2006 newspaper of the same name). In 1840, &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life&quot; is reported to compete with the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; as the two weekly turf newspapers. There were also four monthly magazines at that time – the &quot;Old Sporting Magazine&quot; (founded 1792), the &quot;New Sporting Magazine&quot; (founded 1824), the &quot;Sporting Review&quot; (founded 1837) and the &quot;Sportsman&quot; (stated to have originated in 1829, so not the same as the &quot;Sportsman&quot; above which was founded in 1865). However, coverage of horse racing in newspapers is believed to date as far back as the &quot;Evening English Chronicle&quot; in 1779.

===Television===

There are two dedicated horse racing channels on British digital television – Sky Sports Racing (free to air) and Racing TV (subscription only). Daily broadcasts of British race meetings are split between the two according to contracts arranged by racecourses and racecourse owning groups. Saturday racing and key midweek festival meetings are also broadcast on terrestrial television by ITV. The channel broadcasts a Saturday afternoon programme of live racing, usually between 13:30 and 16:00, and an hour-long weekly magazine show on Saturday mornings. The coverage is presented by Ed Chamberlin and Oli Bell with AP McCoy, Alice Plunkett, Mick Fitzgerald and Francesca Cumani. 60 days of racing are shown on ITV4, and 40 days of racing are shown on ITV.

ITV had previously shown horse racing since its first weeks on air in 1955, and in the 1970s it provided an alternative to BBC coverage with the ITV Seven which featured as part of the channel&#x27;s &quot;World of Sport&quot; programme. This lasted until the early 1980s, when coverage was gradually transferred to Channel 4. Prior to 2017, ITV had not shown any horse racing since 1988.

For many years, racing was also broadcast on the BBC, who pioneered coverage of the sport in the 1950s. The network retained the rights to key race meetings, such as the Grand National, Royal Ascot and the Derby until 2012 when it was outbid for the rights by Channel 4. The BBC broadcast some of the key moments in the history of British horse racing, such as Red Rum winning his third Grand National and the 1967 victory of Foinavon in the same race after most of the field fell at the same fence.

Channel 4&#x27;s covered the sport for more than thirty years. Initially it showed the midweek events which were previously shown on ITV but from late 1985 it covered all of the racing previously shown by ITV. Between 2013 and 2016, Channel 4 was the exclusive home of horse racing on terrestrial television. The last day of &quot;Channel 4 Racing&quot; was on 27 December 2016.

As with other sports, many of the people who have presented racing on television through the years have become inseparably linked with racing in the public consciousness. Foremost among these for many years was the BBC&#x27;s Peter O&#x27;Sullevan, known as &quot;the voice of racing&quot;, who commentated on fifty Grand Nationals. Channel 4&#x27;s most recognisable racing figure was John McCririck, famed for his eccentric dress sense and use of the bookmakers&#x27; sign language &quot;tic-tac&quot;. Other notable presenters of Channel 4&#x27;s coverage included Derek Thompson, John Francome, John Oaksey and Brough Scott. Clare Balding transferred from the BBC in 2013 to become lead presenter.

==Betting==
Wagering money on horse races is as old as the sport itself, but in the United Kingdom the links between horse racing and nationwide wagering are very strong. Betting shops are common sights in most towns, tending to be sited wherever a significant number of people with disposable cash can be expected. At one point in the 1970s it was said that the ideal location was &quot;close to a pub, the Labour Exchange and the Post Office&quot;, the first being a source of customers in a good mood, the other two being sources of ready cash in the form of &quot;the dole&quot; and state pension money, which was dispensed through Post Offices at the time.

As early as 1938, £500,000,000 was being gambled on horse racing in England according to the Christian Social Council Committee on Gambling. However, betting shops were not legalised until 1960, at which time many of the famous British betting shop chains such as William Hill, Ladbrokes and Corals were legally established on the high street. Previously betting was either on course, via certain credit betting offices, or illegally conducted often in or around public houses, with &quot;bookies runners&quot; ferrying the bets from bookmaker to client.

Betting is taxed under the authority of various acts of Parliament. A gross profit tax is levied on all UK based bookmakers which is payable to the exchequer, and a separate sum is agreed and collected by the Horserace Betting Levy Board, a non-departmental public body of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, who use the funds for race prize money and the improvement of horse racing. For the latest year reported, the levy resulted in £103.5 million being collected.

Member of Parliament Clement Freud, who himself had owned racehorses, alleged in an article published in the 1970s, before his election to Parliament, that horse racing was organised purely to generate taxes. He cited the large number of otherwise non-viable racecourses kept open (to ensure sufficient races being run) even as the financial rewards to the owners and trainers declined to the point where most could barely cover their expenses.

On 6 October 2001, the Government abolished the turnover-based tax on betting, which had been 9% of the stake or the winnings, the punter having the choice to pay a certain small amount or an uncertain large amount. The tax, now based on gross profit, is now effectively indirectly levied on the punters, the cost being absorbed in the odds that bookmakers offer.

The last ten years in the UK has seen massive growth in online gambling. Punters are now going online to place their bets, where technology gives them access to a greater wealth of information and knowledge. Now racing punters exchange information on online forums, tipping sites etc. For example, over 200,000 people are set to participate in the next Cheltenham festivals.

==Key people==

===Jockeys===
In the early days of British horse racing, owners tended to ride their own horses in races. This practice died out as racing became more organised and the owners, most of them aristocrats, had grooms ride the horses instead. Jockeys at this time were often scruffy and unkempt and not well-regarded. The 19th century racing chronicler, Nimrod, referred to the &quot;costume&quot; of the jockeys of the previous century as &quot;deformity personified&quot;. Nevertheless, several Yorkshire-based jockeys became acclaimed in the mid-to-late 18th century. These included John Mangle, Bill Pierse, John Shepherd, three different individuals named John Singleton, Ben Smith and Bill Clift. Between them they won many of the early runnings of the oldest classic, the St. Leger. Their counterparts in the south became similarly celebrated, and exercised a similar dominance over the Newmarket classics. Amongst their number were Sam Chifney, Jem Robinson, the Arnull family – John, Sam and Bill – and &quot;the first man to bring respectability to the profession&quot; – Frank Buckle.

The 19th century was dominated by three jockeys – Nat Flatman, George Fordham and Fred Archer – who between them won forty flat jockeys&#x27; championships. With the expansion of print media and the growth of interest in horse racing among ordinary people, these jockeys became nationally recognised figures, with a profile enjoyed by the footballers and TV celebrities of today. When Archer died at his own hand, it is said:


The high profile of jockeys at this time is illustrated (literally) by the number of caricatures of jockeys that feature in Victorian society magazine, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, alongside Members of Parliament (MPs), aristocrats and other national figures.

Three figures dominate the flat racing scene of the 20th century too – Steve Donoghue, Gordon Richards and Lester Piggott. Richards is often regarded as the greatest jockey ever and set many records which still stand, including most flat race victories and most flat jockey championships. Piggott is descended from the great racing families of the 19th century, the Days and the Cannons.

In the modern day, Frankie Dettori is the jockey with the widest public profile beyond racing, appearing on Celebrity Big Brother and launching his own food range. He has also gained public attention for his feats on the racetrack, including his &#x27;Magnificent Seven&#x27; wins at Ascot in 1997 and three jockeys&#x27; championships. Kieren Fallon was a regular champion around the turn of the century, and younger jockeys to have won multiple championships include Ryan Moore and current champion Oisin Murphy. Hayley Turner came to prominence as the first British woman to win a Group 1 race outright and as Champion Apprentice in 2005, and more recently Hollie Doyle has broken several of Turner&#x27;s records and been nominated for BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

Historically, jumps jockeys have not had the same profile as their flat counterparts, but this changed to some extent in the 20th century. The large television audience enjoyed by the Grand National has helped in this regard. Previously unknown jockeys like 2013 winner Ryan Mania have received their first nationwide coverage as a result of the race.

The most-celebrated jumps jockey of all-time is the Northern Irishman Tony McCoy, winner of every Jumps Jockeys&#x27; Championship from 1995/96 until 2014/15 and the only horse racing figure to ever win the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. He broke Gordon Richards&#x27; record for most winners in a season in 2001/02 and his total number of career wins by the time he retired was 4,358, well eclipsing the numbers set by Peter Scudamore and Richard Dunwoody who between them were the leading jumps jockeys of the 1980s and early 1990s. Richard Johnson, who has been second to McCoy in nearly all of his championships has the second most wins jockey of all time, and gained tabloid fame in the late 1990s for his relationship with Zara Philips.

Former champion jump jockeys Dick Francis and John Francome have become known to a wider public after enjoying second careers as writers of racing-based fiction, while Francome (until the end of 2012) and Mick Fitzgerald are known as horse racing TV pundits.

As of November 2017, there are around 450 professional jockeys licensed in the United Kingdom, along with around 300 amateur riders.

===Trainers===

Formal training of racehorses began to be common in the reign of James I.

The two dominant forces in modern-day flat training in Britain in the modern era are Irish-based trainer Aidan O&#x27;Brien and Godolphin, through their trainers Saeed Bin Suroor and Charlie Appleby. They largely concentrate on Group races. Operating in much larger numbers of runners, but with a greater spread of quality, are trainers such as Mark Johnston, Richard Hannon Jr. and Richard Fahey.

In the jumps sphere, Nicky Henderson and Paul Nicholls dominate, along with the likes of David Pipe, Philip Hobbs, Jonjo O&#x27;Neill and Dan Skelton. In recent years, the Irish trainer Willie Mullins has enjoyed huge success in Britain, coming close to taking the Trainers Championship in 2015/16.

===Owners===
Aristocratic families have always owned horses in Britain and the list of Classic winners features names such as the Earl of Grafton, Earl Grosvenor and Earl of Egremont from early days. In the modern era, Queen Elizabeth II retained a stable of horses trained by the likes of Michael Stoute. The Queen Mother was famously keen on horse racing and a race at the Cheltenham Festival, the Queen Mother Champion Chase, is named in her honour. The current King and Queen continue to own horses, although a number of them were sold after the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II.

The two most prominent flat owners of the current era are Sheikh Mohammed, under the Godolphin banner and the team of Michael Tabor, John Magnier and others, based in Ireland.

Prominent jumps owners include JP McManus, Graham Wylie and Trevor Hemmings

===Administrators===
Modern-day racing originated in Britain, so many figures from British racing have shaped the sport. Admiral Rous established the handicapping process for horse racing, including the weight-for-age scale, while in the 20th century, form expert and sometime administrator of the sport, Phil Bull established Timeform whose ratings are often used to assess the all-time great horses.

==Key data==
Key data for 2004, 2005 and 2010 extracted from the British Horseracing Board&#x27;s annual reports for 2004 and 2005, the 2010 annual reportfrom its successor organisation, the British Horseracing Authority and the 2011/12 British Horseracing Fact Book

The Chief Executive of the BHB stated in the 2005 annual report that &quot;Success was achieved in an environment of great uncertainty.&quot; The sport is adapting to the loss of income from pre-race data following court ruling prohibiting the practice of charging for such in 2004 and 2005, to which the BHB attributes the fall in prize money in 2005. The data charges were themselves designed to replace income lost when a statutory levy was abolished. In 2004 attendances exceeded 6 million for the first time since the 1950s (2004 annual report). The decrease in 2005 is attributable to the closure of Ascot Racecourse for redevelopment for the entire year.

==Racehorse welfare==
A 2006 investigation by &quot;The Observer&quot; found that each year 6–10,000 horses are slaughtered for consumption abroad, a significant proportion of which are horses bred for racing. 
The industry produces approximately 5,000 foals, whilst 4–5,000 racehorses are retired each year, 90 being taken into care by the industries charity Retraining of Racehorses.  Research conducted by the Equine Fertility Unit found that 66% of thoroughbred foals were never entered for a race, and more than 80% were no longer in training after four years.  Foal production has increased threefold since 1966.  Racehorses are capable of living for more than 30 years.

<text>Mary Lou Retton (born January 24, 1968) is an American retired gymnast. At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, she won a gold medal in the individual all-around competition, as well as two silver medals and two bronze medals.

Retton&#x27;s performance made her one of the most popular athletes in the United States. Her gold medal win was historic as Retton was the first American woman to win the all-around gold medal in Olympic gymnastics.

==Early life==
Mary Lou Retton was born on January 24, 1968, in Fairmont, West Virginia. Her father, Ronnie, operated a coal-industry transportation equipment business. She attended Fairmont Senior High School, but did not graduate. She competed in the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, California, during her sophomore year of high school.

==Gymnastics career==
Retton was inspired by watching Nadia Comăneci outshine defending Olympic two-event winner Olga Korbut on television at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, when she herself was eight years of age, and she took up gymnastics in her hometown of Fairmont, West Virginia. She was coached by Gary Rafaloski. She then decided to move to Houston, Texas, to train under Romanians Béla and Márta Károlyi, who had coached Nadia Comăneci before their defection to the United States. Under the Károlyis, Retton soon began to make a name for herself in the U.S., winning the American Cup in 1983 and placing second to Dianne Durham (another Károlyi student) at the US Nationals that same year. Though Retton missed the World Gymnastics Championships in 1983 due to a wrist injury, she won the American Classic in 1983 and 1984, as well as Japan&#x27;s Chunichi Cup in 1983.
After winning her second American Cup, the U.S. Nationals, and the U.S. Olympic Trials in 1984, Retton suffered a knee injury when she was performing a floor routine at a local gymnastics center at this time. She had sat down to sign autographs when she felt her knee lock, forcing her to undergo an operation five weeks prior to the 1984 Summer Olympics, which were going to be held in Los Angeles—the first time the Summer Olympics had been held in the United States in 52 years. She recovered just in time for this most prestigious of tournaments, and in the competition, which was boycotted by the Soviet bloc nations except for Romania, Retton was engaged in a close battle with Ecaterina Szabo of Romania for the all-around gold medal. Trailing Szabo (after uneven bars and balance beam) by 0.15 with two events to go, Retton scored perfect 10s on floor exercise and vault—the last event in an especially dramatic fashion, as there had been fears that her knee injury and the subsequent surgery might impair her performance. Retton won the all-around gold medal by 0.05 points, beating Szabo to become the first female gymnast from outside Eastern Europe to win the individual all-around gold. She also became the first American woman to be an Olympic all-around champion, which was an honor she held alone until the ongoing six-peat of American all-around champions. (In order: Carly Patterson in 2004 in Athens, Nastia Liukin in 2008 in Beijing, Gabby Douglas in 2012 in London, Simone Biles in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro and 2024 in Paris and Suni Lee in 2021 in Tokyo.)

At the same Olympics, Retton won four additional medals: silver in the team competition and the horse vault, and bronze in the floor exercise and uneven bars. For her performance, she was named &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sportswoman of the Year.&quot; She appeared on a Wheaties box, and became the cereal&#x27;s first official spokeswoman.

In 1985, Retton won the American Cup all-around competition for the third and final time. She retired in 1986.

==Post-gymnastics career==
===Political views===
Retton was an outspoken supporter of the Reagan administration and appeared in a variety of television ads supporting Ronald Reagan as well as appearing at a rally for his reelection campaign just a month after the Olympics in her home state of West Virginia. Retton delivered the Pledge of Allegiance with fellow former gymnast and 1996 Olympic gold medalist Kerri Strug on the second night of the 2004 Republican National Convention.

===Honors===
Retton&#x27;s hometown, Fairmont, West Virginia, named a road and a park in the town after her. In 1985, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member General Chuck Yeager.

Retton was elected to the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in 1992. In 1993, the Associated Press released results of a sports study in which Retton was statistically tied for first place with fellow Olympian Dorothy Hamill as the most popular athlete in America. In 1997, Retton was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame. In January 2020, Retton was the first woman inducted into the Houston Sports Hall of Fame.

===Compensated endorsements===
During the 1990s, Retton worked as a spokeswoman, appearing in advertisements for the U.S. drugstore chain Revco.

Retton has had many commercial endorsements, including bowling and shampoo. She was the first female athlete to be pictured on the front of a Wheaties box, and General Mills stated that Wheaties sales improved after her appearance. In 2019, Retton became a spokesperson for Australian Dream, a pain relief cream; and briefly, in 2023 as a spokesperson for Colonial Penn Life Insurance.

==Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017==
After the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal hit the news in 2016, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017 was introduced to the 115th Congress. Retton and other members of USA Gymnastics met with the bill sponsor, Senator Dianne Feinstein, with the aim of convincing her to drop the bill. Despite these efforts, on February 14, 2018, the act was signed into law and became effective immediately.

==Personal life==
Retton was born with hip dysplasia, a condition that her years as a competitive gymnast aggravated. After experiencing increased pain from the condition, she underwent multiple hip replacement surgeries.

Retton lived in Houston, Texas, until 2009, when her family returned to West Virginia. She moved back to Houston in 2012. In 1990, she married Shannon Kelley, a former University of Texas quarterback and Houston real estate developer who worked for the Houston Baptist University athletic department as of 2012. Together they have four daughters: Shayla (born 1995), McKenna (born 1997), Skyla (born 2000), and Emma (born 2002). McKenna was an NCAA gymnast at Louisiana State University, and Emma was an NCAA gymnast at the University of Arkansas. Retton and Kelley were divorced in February 2018.

On October 10, 2023, Retton&#x27;s daughter McKenna announced that her mother was critically ill with pneumonia. Retton reportedly did not have health insurance and turned to crowdfunding to raise money for medical expenses. Retton returned home to recover later that month and issued a statement on October 30, 2023, saying &quot;I&#x27;m with family continuing to slowly recover and staying very positive as I know this recovery is a long and slow process. When the time is right, I will be sharing more information about my health issues.&quot; The total sum collected as of January 22, 2024, was $459,234. Upon inquiry from &quot;USA Today&quot;, Retton would not comment on any details surrounding her medical issue nor how much of the donations were allocated toward her healthcare. Her daughter said any &quot;remaining funds&quot; would go towards a charity, but failed to provide any details or timeline.

<text>Chymotrypsinogen is an inactive precursor (zymogen) of chymotrypsin, a digestive enzyme which breaks proteins down into smaller peptides. Chymotrypsinogen is a single polypeptide chain consisting of 245 amino acid residues. It is synthesized in the acinar cells of the pancreas and stored inside membrane-bounded granules at the apex of the acinar cell. Release of the granules from the cell is stimulated by either a hormonal signal or a nerve impulse, and the granules spill into a duct leading into the duodenum.

== Activation ==
Chymotrypsinogen must be inactive until it gets to the digestive tract, in order to prevent damage to the pancreas or any other organs. It is activated by another enzyme called trypsin. The active form is called π-chymotrypsin and is used to create α-chymotrypsin. Trypsin cleaves the peptide bond in chymotrypsinogen between arginine-15 and isoleucine-16. This creates two peptides within the π-chymotrypsin molecule, held together by a disulfide bond. One π-chymotrypsin acts on another by breaking a leucine and serine peptide bond. The activated π-chymotrypsin reacts with other π-chymotrypsin molecules to cleave and remove two dipeptides: serine-14–arginine-15 and threonine-147–asparagine-148. This reaction produces α-chymotrypsin. The yield of α-chymotrypsin can be affected by inhibitors such as hydrocinnate and also by pH, temperature and calcium chloride.

The activation process can be studied using fluorescence probe 2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulfonate (TNS). TNS forms covalent bonds with chymotrypsinogen and as the bonds break to form chymotrypsin in the presence of trypsin, the fluorescence increases.

<doc id="74730" wikidata="Q1542651" url="?curid=74730" title="Grand National">
<text>The Grand National is a National Hunt horse race held annually at Aintree Racecourse in Aintree, Merseyside, England. First run in 1839, it is a handicap steeplechase over an official distance of about 4 miles and 2½ furlongs (), with horses jumping 30 fences over two laps. It is the most valuable jump race in Europe, with a prize fund of £1 million in 2017. An event that is prominent in British culture, the race is popular amongst many people who do not normally watch or bet on horse racing at other times of the year.

The course over which the race is run features much larger fences than those found on conventional National Hunt tracks. Many of these fences, particularly Becher&#x27;s Brook, The Chair and the Canal Turn, have become famous in their own right and, combined with the distance of the event, create what has been called &quot;the ultimate test of horse and rider&quot;.

The Grand National has been broadcast live on free-to-air terrestrial television in the United Kingdom since 1960. From then until 2012 it was broadcast by the BBC. Channel 4 broadcast the event between 2013 and 2016: UK broadcasting rights were transferred to ITV from 2017. An estimated 500 to 600 million people watch the Grand National in over 140 countries. The race has also been broadcast on radio since 1927; BBC Radio held exclusive rights until 2013. Talksport acquired radio commentary rights in 2014: Both the BBC and Talksport currently broadcast the race in full.

The Grand National had suffered three major disruptions in post-war history. The 1993 Grand National was not held due to a series of false starts, the postponement of the 1997 Grand National to a Monday because of an IRA bomb threat and the 2023 Grand National being delayed due to Animal Rising protesters. 

The most recent running of the race, in 2024, was won by I Am Maximus. Since 2017, the race and accompanying festival have been sponsored by Randox.

The next meeting will take place from 3–5 April 2025.

==History==

===Founding and early Nationals (1829–1850)===

The Grand National was founded by William Lynn, a syndicate head and proprietor of the Waterloo Hotel, on land he leased in Aintree from William Molyneux, 2nd Earl of Sefton. Lynn set out a course, built a grandstand, and Lord Sefton laid the foundation stone on 7 February 1829. There is much debate regarding the first official Grand National; most leading published historians, including John Pinfold, now prefer the idea that the first running was in 1836 and was won by The Duke. This same horse won again in 1837, while Sir William was the winner in 1838. These races have long been disregarded because of the belief that they took place at Maghull and not Aintree. However, some historians have unearthed evidence in recent years that suggests those three races were run over the same course at Aintree and were regarded as having been Grand Nationals up until the mid-1860s. Contemporary newspaper reports place all the 1836–38 races at Aintree although the 1839 race is the first described as &quot;national&quot;. However, calls for the Nationals of 1836–1838 to be restored to the record books have been unsuccessful. 

In 1838 and 1839 three significant events occurred to transform the race from a small local affair to a national event. Firstly, the Great St. Albans Chase, which had clashed with the steeplechase at Aintree, was not renewed after 1838, leaving a major hole in the chasing calendar. Secondly, the railway, opened from Manchester to Liverpool in 1830, was linked to a line from London and Birmingham in 1839 enabling rail transport to the Liverpool area from large parts of the country for the first time. Finally, a committee was formed to better organise the event. These factors led to a more highly publicised race in 1839 which attracted a larger field of top quality horses and riders, greater press coverage, and increased attendance on race day. Over time the first three runnings of the event were quickly forgotten to secure the 1839 race its place in history as the first official Grand National. 

The 1839 race was won by rider Jem Mason on the aptly named, Lottery. The Duke was ridden by Martin Becher. The fence Becher&#x27;s Brook is named after him and is where he fell in the race.

By the 1840s, Lynn&#x27;s ill-health blunted his enthusiasm for Aintree. Edward Topham, a respected handicapper and prominent member of Lynn&#x27;s syndicate, began to exert greater influence over the National. He turned the chase into a handicap in 1843 after it had been a weight-for-age race for the first four years, and took over the land lease in 1848. One century later, the Topham family bought the course outright.

Later in the century, the race was the setting of a thriller by the popular novelist Henry Hawley Smart.

===War National Steeplechase (1916–1918)===
For three years during the First World War, while Aintree Racecourse was taken over by the War Office, an alternative race was run at Gatwick Racecourse, a now disused course on land now occupied by Gatwick Airport. The first of these races, in 1916, was called the Racecourse Association Steeplechase, and in 1917 and 1918 the race was called the War National Steeplechase. The races at Gatwick are not always recognised as &quot;Grand Nationals&quot; and their results are often omitted from winners&#x27; lists.

===Tipperary Tim (1928)===
On the day of the 1928 Grand National, before the race had begun, Tipperary Tim&#x27;s jockey William Dutton heard a friend call out to him: &quot;Billy boy, you&#x27;ll only win if all the others fall down!&quot; These words turned out to be true, as 41 of the 42 starters fell during the race. That year&#x27;s National was run during misty weather conditions with the going very heavy. As the field approached the Canal Turn on the first circuit, Easter Hero fell, causing a pile-up from which only seven horses emerged with seated jockeys. By the penultimate fence, this number had reduced to three, with Great Span looking most likely to win ahead of Billy Barton and Tipperary Tim. Great Span&#x27;s saddle then slipped, leaving Billy Barton in the lead until he too then fell. Although Billy Barton&#x27;s jockey Tommy Cullinan managed to remount and complete the race, it was Tipperary Tim who came in first at outside odds of 100/1. With only two riders completing the course, this remains a record for the lowest number of finishers.

===Second World War and the 1950s===
Although the Grand National was run as normal in 1940 and most other major horse races around the world were able to be held throughout the war, the commandeering of Aintree Racecourse for defence use in 1941 meant no Grand National could be held from 1941 to 1945. It recommenced in 1946, when it was run on a Friday, and from 1947 was moved to a Saturday, at the urging of the Home Secretary James Chuter Ede, who thought this would make it more accessible to working people. It has normally been run on a Saturday ever since.

During the 1950s the Grand National was dominated by Vincent O&#x27;Brien, who trained different winners of the race for three consecutive years between 1953 and 1955. Early Mist secured O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s first victory in 1953; Royal Tan won in 1954, and Quare Times completed the Irish trainer&#x27;s hat-trick in 1955.

The running of the 1956 Grand National witnessed one of the chase&#x27;s most bizarre incidents. Devon Loch, owned by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, had cleared the final fence in the leading position, five lengths clear of E.S.B. Forty yards from what seemed like certain victory, Devon Loch suddenly, and inexplicably, half-jumped into the air and collapsed in a belly-flop on the turf. Despite efforts by jockey Dick Francis, Devon Loch was unable to complete the race, leaving E.S.B. to cross the finishing line first. Responding to the commiserations of E.S.B.’s owner, the Queen Mother famously commented: &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s racing!&quot;

Had Devon Loch completed the race he might have set a new record for the fastest finishing time, which E.S.B. missed by only four-fifths of a second. Many explanations have been offered for Devon Loch&#x27;s behaviour on the run-in, but the incident remains inexplicable. The incident became part of the folklore of the event, and by extension British sporting culture. In modern language, the phrase &quot;to do a Devon Loch&quot; is often used to describe a last-minute failure to achieve an expected victory.

===Foinavon (1967)===

In the 1967 Grand National, most of the field were hampered or dismounted in a mêlée at the 23rd fence, allowing a rank-outsider, Foinavon, to become a surprise winner at odds of 100/1. A loose horse named Popham Down, who had unseated his rider at the first jump, suddenly veered across the leading group at the 23rd, causing them to either stop, refuse or unseat their riders. Racing journalist Lord Oaksey described the resulting pile-up by saying that Popham Down had &quot;cut down the leaders like a row of thistles&quot;. Some horses even started running in the wrong direction, back the way they had come. Foinavon, whose owner had such little faith in him that he had travelled to Worcester that day instead, had been lagging some 100 yards behind the leading pack, giving his jockey, John Buckingham, time to steer his mount wide of the havoc and make a clean jump of the fence on the outside. Although 17 jockeys remounted and some made up considerable ground, particularly Josh Gifford on 15/2 favourite Honey End, none had time to catch Foinavon before he crossed the finishing line. The 7th/23rd fence was officially named the &#x27;Foinavon fence&#x27; in 1984.

===1970s and Red Rum===
The 1970s were mixed years for the Grand National. In 1973, eight years after Mrs. Mirabel Topham announced she was seeking a buyer, the racecourse was finally sold to property developer Bill Davies. Davies tripled the admission prices, and consequently, the attendance at the 1975 race, won by L&#x27;Escargot, was the smallest in living memory. It was after this that bookmaker Ladbrokes made an offer, signing an agreement with Davies allowing them to manage the Grand National.

During this period, Red Rum was breaking all records to become the most successful racehorse in Grand National history. Originally bought as a yearling in 1966 for 400 guineas (£420), he passed through various training yards before being bought for 6,000 guineas (£6,300) by Ginger McCain on behalf of Noel le Mare. Two days after the purchase while trotting the horse on Southport beach, McCain noticed that Red Rum appeared lame. The horse was suffering from pedal osteitis, an inflammatory bone disorder. McCain had witnessed many lame carthorses reconditioned by being galloped in sea-water. He successfully used this treatment on his newly acquired racehorse.

Red Rum became, and remains as of 2018, the only horse to have won the Grand National three times, in 1973, 1974, and 1977. He also finished second in the two intervening years, 1975 and 1976.

In 1973, he was in second place at the last fence, 15 lengths behind champion horse Crisp, who was carrying 23 lbs more. Red Rum made up the ground on the run-in and, two strides from the finishing post, he pipped the tiring Crisp to win by three-quarters of a length in what is arguably the most memorable Grand National of all time. Red Rum finished in 9 minutes 1.9 seconds, taking 18.3 seconds off the previous record for the National which had been set in 1935 by Reynoldstown. His record was to stand for the next seventeen years.

===Bob Champion&#x27;s National (1981)===

Two years before the 1981 Grand National, jockey Bob Champion had been diagnosed with testicular cancer and given only months to live by doctors. But by 1981 he had recovered and was passed fit to ride in the Grand National. He rode Aldaniti, a horse deprived in its youth and which had only recently recovered from chronic leg problems. Despite a poor start, the pair went on to win lengths ahead of the much-fancied Spartan Missile, ridden by amateur jockey and 54-year-old grandfather John Thorne. Champion and Aldaniti were instantly propelled to celebrity status, and within two years, their story had been re-created in the film &quot;Champions&quot;, starring John Hurt.

===Seagram&#x27;s sponsorship (1984–1991)===
From 1984 to 1991, Seagram sponsored the Grand National. The Canadian distiller provided a solid foundation on which the race&#x27;s revival could be built, firstly enabling the course to be bought from Davies and to be run and managed by the Jockey Club. It is said that Ivan Straker, Seagram&#x27;s UK chairman, became interested in the potential opportunity after reading a passionate newspaper article written by journalist Lord Oaksey, who, in his riding days, had come within three-quarters of a length of winning the 1963 National. The last Seagram-sponsored Grand National was in 1991. Coincidentally, the race was won by a horse named Seagram. Martell, then a Seagram subsidiary, took over sponsorship of the Aintree meeting for an initial seven years from 1992, in a £4 million deal.

===The race that never was (1993)===

The result of the 1993 Grand National was declared void after a series of incidents commentator Peter O&#x27;Sullevan later called &quot;the greatest disaster in the history of the Grand National.&quot;

While under starter&#x27;s orders, one jockey was tangled in the starting tape which had failed to rise correctly. A false start was declared, but due to a lack of communication between course officials, 30 of the 39 jockeys did not realise this and began the race.

Course officials tried to stop the runners by waving red flags, but many jockeys continued to race, believing that they were protesters (a group of whom had invaded the course earlier), while Peter Scudamore only stopped because he saw his trainer, Martin Pipe, waving frantically at him.

Seven horses completed the course, meaning the result was void. The first past the post was Esha Ness (in the second-fastest time ever), ridden by John White, trained by Jenny Pitman and owned by Patrick Bancroft.

===The Monday National (1997)===

The 1997 Grand National was postponed after two coded bomb threats were received from the Provisional Irish Republican Army. The course was secured by police who then evacuated jockeys, race personnel, and local residents along with 60,000 spectators. Cars and coaches were locked in the course grounds, leaving some 20,000 people without their vehicles over the weekend. With limited accommodation available in the city, local residents opened their doors and took in many of those stranded. This prompted tabloid headlines such as &quot;We&#x27;ll fight them on the Becher&#x27;s&quot;, in reference to Winston Churchill&#x27;s war-time speech. The race was run 48 hours later on the Monday, with the meeting organisers offering 20,000 tickets with free admission.

===Recent history (2004–present)===

Red Rum&#x27;s trainer Ginger McCain returned to the Grand National in 2004, 31 years after Red Rum&#x27;s epic run-in defeat of Crisp to secure his first of three wins. McCain&#x27;s Amberleigh House came home first, ridden by Graham Lee, overtaking Clan Royal on the final straight. Hedgehunter, who would go on to win in 2005, fell at the last while leading. McCain had equalled George Dockeray and Fred Rimell&#x27;s record feat of training four Grand National winners.

In 2005 John Smith&#x27;s took over from Martell as main sponsors of the Grand National and many of the other races at the three-day Aintree meeting for the first time. In 2006 John Smith&#x27;s launched the John Smith&#x27;s People&#x27;s Race which gave ten members of the public the chance to ride in a flat race at Aintree on Grand National day. In total, thirty members of the public took part in the event before it was discontinued in 2010.

In 2009, Mon Mome became the longest-priced winner of the National for 42 years when he defied outside odds of 100/1 to win by 12 lengths. The victory was also the first for trainer Venetia Williams, the first female trainer to triumph since Jenny Pitman in 1995. The race was also the first National ride for Liam Treadwell.

In 2010 the National became the first horse race to be televised in high-definition in the UK.

In August 2013 Crabbie&#x27;s was announced as the new sponsor of the Grand National. The three-year deal between the alcoholic ginger beer producer and Aintree saw the race run for a record purse of £1 million in 2014.

In March 2016 it was announced that Randox Health would take over from Crabbie&#x27;s as official partners of the Grand National festival from 2017, for at least five years.
 The sponsorship award was controversial as Aintree&#x27;s chairwoman, Rose Paterson, was married to Owen Paterson, a Member of Parliament (MP) who also earns a £50,000 annual fee as a consultant for Randox.
The 2020 race was not run owing to the coronavirus pandemic; in its place, a virtual race was produced using CGI technology and based on algorithms of the 40 horses most likely to have competed. The virtual race was won by Potters Corner, winner of the 2019 Welsh Grand National. (Another computer-generated virtual race was made also, whose runners were many horses who had won the Grand National in past years, each shown with its performance as at its racing prime. Its winner was Red Rum by less than a length, having just passed Manifesto.)

In December 2020 Randox Health announced they had extended their sponsorship for a further 5 years which will make them sponsors to 2026.

In 2021, Rachael Blackmore became the first female jockey to win the race, on the horse Minella Times.

In 2023, the race was disrupted by the Animal Rising protests, the first such disruptions since the cancellation of the 1993 Grand National due to a series of false starts and the 1997 Grand National due to the IRA bomb threat.

==The course==
The Grand National is run over the National Course at Aintree and consists of two laps of 16 fences, the first 14 of which are jumped twice. Horses completing the race cover a distance of , the longest of any National Hunt race in Britain. As part of a review of safety following the 2012 running of the event, from 2013 to 2015 the start was moved forward away from the crowds and grandstands, reducing the race distance by from the historical . The course has one of the longest run-ins from the final fence of any steeplechase, at .
The Grand National was designed as a cross-country steeplechase when it was first officially run in 1839. The runners started at a lane on the edge of the racecourse and raced away from the course out over open countryside towards the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The gates, hedges, and ditches that they met along the way were flagged to provide them with the obstacles to be jumped along the way with posts and rails erected at the two points where the runners jumped a brook. The runners returned towards the racecourse by running along the edge of the canal before re-entering the course at the opposite end. The runners then ran the length of the racecourse before embarking on a second circuit before finishing in front of the stands. The majority of the race, therefore, took place not on the actual Aintree Racecourse but instead in the adjoining countryside. That countryside was incorporated into the modern course but commentators still often refer to it as &quot;the country&quot;.

===Fences===
There are 16 fences on the National Course topped with spruce from the Lake District. The cores of 12 fences were rebuilt in 2012 and they are now made of a flexible plastic material which is more forgiving than the traditional wooden core fences. They are still topped with at least of spruce for the horses to knock off. Some of the jumps carry names from the history of the race. All 16 are jumped on the first lap, but on the final lap, the runners bear to the right onto the run-in for home, avoiding The Chair and the Water Jump. The following is a summary of all 16 fences on the course:

;Fence 1 &amp; 17
Height: 
Often met at great speed, which can lead to several falls, the highest being 12 runners in 1951. The drop on the landing side was reduced after the 2011 Grand National. It was bypassed in both 2019 and 2023 on the final lap, after equine casualties. The fence was moved 60 yards nearer to the start from the 2024 race, to try to reduce the speed of the field early in the race.

;Fence 2 &amp; 18
Height: 
Before 1888 the first two fences were located approximately halfway between the first to second and second to third jumps. The second became known as The Fan, after a mare who refused the obstacle three years in succession. The name fell out of favour with the relocation of the fences.
;Fence 3 &amp; 19 – open ditch
Height: ; fronted by a ditch
The first big test in the race as horses are still adapting to the obstacles. In 2022, the race was shortened to 29 fences by bypassing this fence following a fatality.
;Fence 4 &amp; 20
Height: 
A testing obstacle that often leads to falls and unseated riders. In 2011 the 20th became the first fence in Grand National history to be bypassed on the final lap, following an equine fatality.
;Fence 5 &amp; 21
Height: 
A plain obstacle which precedes the most famous fence on the course. It was bypassed on the final lap for the first time in 2012 so that medics could treat a jockey who fell from his mount on the first lap and had broken a leg.
;Fence 6 &amp; 22 – Becher&#x27;s Brook
Height: , with the landing side to lower than the takeoff side
The drop at this fence often catches runners by surprise. Becher&#x27;s has always been a popular vantage point as it can present one of the most spectacular displays of jumping when the horse and rider meet the fence right. Jockeys must sit back in their saddles and use their body weight as ballast to counter the steep drop. It takes its name from Captain Martin Becher who fell there in the first Grand National and took shelter in the small brook running along the landing side of the fence while the remainder of the field thundered over. It is said that Becher later reflected: &quot;Water tastes disgusting without the benefits of whisky.&quot; It was bypassed in 2011 along with fence 20, after an equine casualty, and again in 2018 after a jockey was attended by doctors, both occurring on the final lap.
;Fence 7 &amp; 23 – Foinavon
Height: 
One of the smallest on the course, it was named in 1984 after the 1967 winner who avoided a mêlée at the fence to go on and win the race at outside odds of 100/1.
;Fence 8 &amp; 24 – Canal Turn
Height: 
Noted for its sharp 90-degree left turn immediately after landing. Before the First World War it was not uncommon for loose horses to continue straight ahead after the jump and end up in the Leeds and Liverpool Canal itself. There was once a ditch before the fence but this was filled in after a mêlée in the 1928 race. It was bypassed for the first time in 2015 on the final lap as vets arrived to treat a horse who fell on the first lap.
;Fence 9 &amp; 25 – Valentine&#x27;s Brook
Height: with a brook
The fence was originally known as the Second Brook but was renamed after a horse named Valentine was reputed to have jumped the fence hind legs first in 1840. A grandstand was erected alongside the fence in the early part of the 20th century but fell into decline after the Second World War and was torn down in the 1970s.
;Fence 10 &amp; 26
Height: 
A plain obstacle that leads the runners alongside the canal towards two ditches.
;Fence 11 &amp; 27 – open ditch
Height: , with a ditch on the takeoff side. This fence was 5 feet hight but was lowered by 2 inches from 2024.
;Fence 12 &amp; 28 – ditch
Height: , with a ditch on the landing side

The runners then cross the Melling Road near to the Anchor Bridge, a popular vantage point since the earliest days of the race. This also marks the point where the runners are said to be re-entering the &quot;racecourse proper&quot;. In the early days of the race, it is thought there was an obstacle near this point known as the Table Jump, which may have resembled a bank similar to those still seen at Punchestown in Ireland. In the 1840s the Melling Road was also flanked by hedges and the runners had to jump into the road and then back out of it.

;Fence 13 &amp; 29
Height: 
A plain obstacle that comes at a point when the runners are usually in a good rhythm and thus rarely causes problems.
;Fence 14 &amp; 30
Height: 
The last fence on the final lap and which has often seen very tired horses fall. Despite some tired runners falling on the 30th and appearing injured, no horse deaths have occurred at the 30th fence to date.

On the first lap of the race, runners continue around the course to negotiate two fences which are only jumped once:

;Fence 15 – The Chair
Height: , preceded by a 6 ft (1.83 m) wide ditch
This fence is the site of the accident that claimed the only human life in the National&#x27;s history: in 1862, Joe Wynne fell here and died from his injuries, although a coroner&#x27;s inquest revealed that the rider was in a gravely weakened condition through consumption. This brought about the ditch on the take-off side of the fence in an effort to slow the horses on approach. The fence was the location where a distance judge sat in the earliest days of the race. On the second circuit, he would record the finishing order from his position and declare any horse that had not passed him before the previous runner passed the finishing post as &quot;distanced&quot;, meaning a non-finisher. The practice was done away with in the 1850s, but the monument where the chair stood is still there. The ground on the landing side is six inches higher than on the takeoff side, creating the opposite effect to the drop at Becher&#x27;s. The fence was originally known as the Monument Jump, but &quot;The Chair&quot; came into more frequent use in the 1930s. Today it is one of the most popular jumps on the course for spectators.

;Fence 16 – Water Jump
Height: 
Originally a stone wall in the very early Nationals. The Water Jump was one of the most popular jumps on the course, presenting a great jumping spectacle for those in the stands and was always a major feature in the newsreels&#x27; coverage of the race. As the newsreels made way for television in the 1960s, so, in turn, did the Water Jump fall under the shadow of its neighbour, The Chair, in popularity as an obstacle.

On the final lap, after the 30th fence, the remaining runners bear right, avoiding The Chair and Water Jump, to head onto a &quot;run-in&quot; to the finishing post. The run-in is not perfectly straight: an &quot;elbow&quot; requires jockeys to make a slight right before finding themselves truly on the home straight. It is on this run-in—one of the longest in the United Kingdom at —that many potential winners have had victory snatched away, such as Devon Loch in 1956, Crisp in 1973, What&#x27;s Up Boys in 2002 and Sunnyhillboy in 2012.

==Winners==

The following table lists the winners of the last ten Grand Nationals:

==Jockeys==
When the concept of the Grand National was first envisaged it was designed as a race for gentlemen riders, meaning men who were not paid to compete, and while this was written into the conditions of the early races many of the riders who weighed out for the 1839 race were professionals for hire. Throughout the Victorian era the line between the amateur and professional sportsman existed only in terms of the rider&#x27;s status, and the engagement of an amateur to ride in the race was rarely considered a handicap to a contender&#x27;s chances of winning. Many gentleman riders won the race before the First World War.

Although the number of amateurs remained high between the wars their ability to match their professional counterparts gradually receded. After the Second World War, it became rare for any more than four or five amateurs to take part in any given year. The last amateur rider to win the Grand National was Mr Sam Waley-Cohen in 2022 on Noble Yeats. The penultimate amateur to win the race is Marcus Armytage, who set the still-standing course record of 8:47.80, when winning on Mr Frisk in 1990. By the 21st century, however, openings for amateur riders had become very rare with some years passing with no amateur riders at all taking part. Those that do in the modern era are most usually talented young riders who are often close to turning professional. In the past, such amateur riders would have been joined by army officers, such as David Campbell who won in 1896, and sporting aristocrats, farmers or local huntsmen and point to point riders, who usually opted to ride their own mounts. But all these genres of rider have faded out in the last quarter of a century with no riders of military rank or aristocratic title having taken a mount since 1982.

The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 made it possible for female jockeys to enter the race. The first female jockey to enter the race was Charlotte Brew on the 200/1 outsider Barony Fort in the 1977 race. The first female jockey to complete the race was Geraldine Rees on Cheers in 1982. The 21st century has not seen a significant increase in female riders but it has seen them gain rides on mounts considered to have a genuine chance of winning. In 2005, Carrie Ford finished fifth on the 8/1 second-favourite Forest Gunner. In 2012, Katie Walsh achieved what was at the time the best result yet for a female jockey, finishing third on the 8/1 joint-favourite Seabass. In 2015, Nina Carberry became the first female jockey to take a fifth ride in the Grand National, her best placing being seventh in 2010. Rachael Blackmore became the first female jockey to win the Grand National aboard Minella Times in 2021.

Professionals now hold dominance in the Grand National and better training, dietary habits and protective clothing have ensured that riders&#x27; careers last much longer and offer more opportunities to ride in the race. Of the 37 riders who have enjoyed 13 or more rides in the race, 19 had their first ride in the 20th century and 11 had careers that continued into or started in the 21st century. Despite that, a long-standing record of 19 rides in the race was set by Tom Olliver back in 1859 and was not equalled until 2014 by A. P. McCoy. This has since been topped by Richard Johnson. Longevity is no guarantee of success, however, as 13 of the 34 never tasted the glory of winning the race. McCoy is the only rider to successfully remove himself from the list after winning at the 15th attempt in 2010. Richard Johnson set a new record of 21 failed attempts to win the race from 1997 to 2019, having finished second twice. The other 16 riders who never won or have not as yet won, having had more than 12 rides in the race are:

* Tom Scudamore (2001–2022): never in first three in 20 attempts
* Aidan Coleman (2008–2023): finished second once in 15 attempts
* Noel Fehily (2001–2017): never in first three in 15 attempts
* David Casey (1997–2015): finished third once in 15 attempts
* Jeff King (1964–1980): finished third once in 15 attempts
* Graham Bradley (1983–1999): finished second once in 14 attempts
* Bill Parvin (1926–1939): finished second once in 14 attempts
* Robert Thornton (1997–2011): never in first three in 14 attempts
* Andrew Thornton (1996–2016): never in first three in 14 attempts
* Chris Grant (1980–1994): finished second thrice in 13 attempts
* Stan Mellor (1956–1971): finished second once in 13 attempts
* George Waddington (1861–1882): finished second once in 13 attempts
* Walter White (1854–1869): finished second once in 13 attempts
*Denis O&#x27;Regan (2007–2022): finished second once in 13 attempts
* David Nicholson (1957–1973): never in first three in 13 attempts
* Sam Twiston-Davies (2010 – present): never in first three in 13 attempts

Peter Scudamore technically lined up for thirteen Grand Nationals without winning but the last of those was the void race of 1993, which meant that he officially competed in twelve Nationals.

Many other well-known jockeys have failed to win the Grand National. These include champion jockeys such as Terry Biddlecombe, John Francome, Josh Gifford, Stan Mellor, Jonjo O&#x27;Neill (who never finished the race) and Fred Rimell. Three jockeys who led over the last fence in the National but lost the race on the run-in ended up as television commentators: Lord Oaksey (on Carrickbeg in 1963), Norman Williamson (on Mely Moss in 2000), and Richard Pitman (on Crisp in 1973). Dick Francis also never won the Grand National in 8 attempts although he did lead over the last fence on Devon Loch in the 1956 race, only for the horse to collapse under him when well in front only 40 yards from the winning post. Pitman&#x27;s son Mark also led over the last fence, only to be pipped at the post when riding Garrison Savannah in 1991. David Dick won the 1956 Grand National on E.S.B. when Devon Loch collapsed and he also holds the record for the number of clear rounds – nine times. Since 1986, any jockey making five or more clear rounds has been awarded the Aintree Clear Rounds Award.

==Horse welfare==
===Statistics===
The Grand National has been described by the BBC as higher risk than lots of other horse races. According to the British Horseracing Authority, as of 2022, the five-year average fatality rate for jump racing was 0.43%. However, the rate for the Grand National over the last ten runnings was more than twice as high, at 1.12%.

=== History of fatalities ===

During the 1970s and 1980s, the Grand National saw a total of 12 horses die (half of which were at Becher&#x27;s Brook); in the next 20-year period from 1990 to 2010, when modifications to the course were most significant, there were 17 equine fatalities. The 2011 and 2012 races each yielded two deaths, including one each at Becher&#x27;s Brook. In 2013, when further changes were made to introduce a more flexible fence structure, there were no fatalities in the race itself although two horses died in run-up races over the same course. The animal welfare charity League Against Cruel Sports counts the number of horse deaths over the three-day meeting from the year 2000 to 2013 at 40. 

There were no equine fatalities in the main Grand National race for seven years until 2019, when one horse died at the first fence. In 2021, one horse was euthanised after the race after suffering an injury on a flat section between fences. Two more were euthanised after suffering injuries in the 2022 event. One of the incidents came at fence 3, the other on the gallop between fences 12 and 13. There was one fatality in 2023, following a fall at the first fence, and two other horses taken away by ambulance.
 The involvement of animal rights protesters was questioned after the race. Sandy Thompson, trainer of the fatally injured Hill Sixteen, claimed along with several other racing personalities that the protesters had (directly or indirectly) caused the death of the gelding and were equally responsible for the number of fallers, because the delay they caused to the start, after storming the course close to post time, got the horses worked up and &quot;hyper&quot;. The protesters have denied these comments, saying they had every right to break and enter and trespass onto racecourse ground and stage a protest despite officials&#x27; orders not to.

===Organiser changes===
Over the years, Aintree officials have worked in conjunction with animal welfare organisations to reduce the severity of some fences and to improve veterinary facilities. In 2008, a new veterinary surgery was constructed in the stable yard which has two large treatment boxes, an X-ray unit, video endoscopy, equine solarium, and sandpit facilities. Further changes in set-up and procedure allow vets to treat horses more rapidly and in better surroundings. Those requiring more specialist care can be transported by specialist horse ambulances, under police escort, to the nearby Philip Leverhulme Equine Hospital at the University of Liverpool at Leahurst. A mobile on-course X-ray machine assists in the prompt diagnosis of leg injuries when horses are pulled up, and oxygen and water are available by the final fence and finishing post. Five vets remain mobile on the course during the running of the race and can initiate treatment of injured fallers at the fence. Additional vets are stationed at the pull-up area, finishing post, and in the surgery.

Some of the National&#x27;s most challenging fences have also been modified, while still preserving them as formidable obstacles. After the 1989 Grand National, in which two horses died in incidents at Becher&#x27;s Brook, Aintree began the most significant of its modifications to the course. The brook on the landing side of Becher&#x27;s was filled in and, after the 2011 race which also saw an equine fatality at the obstacle, the incline on the landing side was levelled out and the drop on was reduced by between 4 and 5 inches (10–13 cm) to slow the runners. Other fences have also been reduced in height over the years, and the entry requirements for the race have been made stricter. Screening at the Canal Turn now prevents horses from being able to see the sharp left turn and encourages jockeys to spread out along the fence, rather than take the tight left-side route. Additionally, work has been carried out to smooth the core post infrastructure of the fences with protective padding to reduce impact upon contact, and the height of the toe-boards on all fences has been increased to . These orange-coloured boards are positioned at the base of each fence and provide a clear ground line to assist horses in determining the base of the fence.

Parts of the course were widened in 2009 to allow runners to bypass fences if required. This was utilised for the first time during the 2011 race as casualties at fences 4 and 6 (Becher&#x27;s Brook) resulted in marshals diverting the remaining contenders around those fences on the final lap.

Some within the horseracing community, including those with notable achievements in the Grand National such as Ginger McCain and Bob Champion, have argued that the lowering of fences and the narrowing of ditches, primarily designed to increase horse safety, has made matters worse by encouraging the runners to race faster. 

After the 2023 race, the Jockey Club announced several major changes to the event for 2024, recognising &quot;the need for more substantial updates on several key areas in order to better protect the welfare of racehorses and jockeys&quot;. This included a reduction in the size of the field for the first time, from 40 to 34 (long called for by welfare campaigners such as the RSPCA), as well as infrastructure changes such as moving fences to slow the speed of the race at the start, and further development of pre-race veterinary protocols.

==Grand National Legends==
In 2009, the race sponsors John Smith&#x27;s launched a poll to determine five personalities to be inducted into the inaugural &quot;Grand National Legends&quot; initiative. The winners were announced on the day of the 2010 Grand National and inscribed on commemorative plaques at Aintree. They were:
*Ginger McCain and his record three-time winning horse Red Rum;
*John Buckingham and Foinavon, the unlikely winners in 1967;
*Manifesto, who holds the record for most runs in the race, eight including two victories;
*Jenny Pitman, the first woman to train the winner of the race in 1983; and
*Sir Peter O&#x27;Sullevan, the commentator who called home the winners of fifty Grand Nationals on radio and television from 1947 to 1997.

A panel of experts also selected three additional legends:
*George Stevens, the record five-time winning rider between 1856 and 1870;
*Captain Martin Becher, who played a major part in bringing the National to Liverpool, rode the winner of the first precursor to the National in 1836 and was the first rider to fall into the brook at the sixth fence, which forever took his name after 1839; and
*Edward Topham, who was assigned the task of framing the weights for the handicap from 1847 and whose descendants played a major role in the race for the next 125 years.

In 2011, nine additional legends were added:
*Bob Champion and Aldaniti, the winners of the 1981 Grand National;
*West Tip, who ran in six consecutive Nationals and won once in 1986;
*Richard Dunwoody, the jockey who rode West Tip and Miinnehoma to victory and who competed in 14 Grand Nationals, being placed in eight;
*Brian Fletcher, a jockey who won the race three times (including Red Rum&#x27;s first victory in 1973, and finished second once and third three times);
*Vincent O&#x27;Brien, who trained three consecutive winners of the race in the 1950s;
*Tom Olliver, who rode in nineteen Nationals, including seventeen consecutively, and won three times, as well as finishing second three times and third once;
*Count Karl Kinsky, the first international winner of the race, and at his first attempt, on board the mare Zoedone in 1883;
*Jack Anthony, three-time winning jockey in 1911, 1915 and 1920; and
*Peter Bromley, the BBC radio commentator who covered 42 Nationals until his retirement in the summer of 2001.

John Smith&#x27;s also added five &quot;people&#x27;s legends&quot; who were introduced on Liverpool Day, the first day of the Grand National meeting. The five were:
*Arthur Ferrie, who worked as a groundsman during the 1970s and 1980s;
*Edie Roche, a Melling Road resident, who opened her home to jockeys, spectators and members of the media when the course was evacuated following a bomb threat in 1997;
*Ian Stewart, a fan who had travelled from Coventry every year to watch the race and was attending his fiftieth National in 2010;
*Police Constable Ken Lawson, who was celebrating thirty-one years of service in the mounted section of Merseyside Police and was set to escort his third National winner in 2010; and
*Tony Roberts, whose first visit to the National had been in 1948 and who had steadily spread the word to family and friends about the race, regularly bringing a party of up to thirty people to the course.

A public vote announced at the 2012 Grand National saw five more additions to the Legends hall:
*Fred Winter, who rode two National winners and trained two more;
*Carl Llewellyn, jockey who won two Nationals, on Party Politics in 1992 and Earth Summit in 1998, the latter being the only horse to have won the Grand National and the Scottish and Welsh Nationals;
*Fred Rimell, the trainer of four different National winning horses, including Nicolaus Silver, one of only three greys to have won the race;
*Michael Scudamore, rider in sixteen consecutive Grand Nationals from 1951, finishing first in 1959 and also achieving a second and a third-place;
*Tommy Carberry, the jockey who stopped Red Rum&#x27;s attempt at a third success in 1975 by winning on L&#x27;Escargot, also finished second and third before going on to train the winner in 1999.
The selection panel also inducted three more competitors:
*Tommy Pickernell, who rode in seventeen Grand Nationals in the 19th century and won three. He allegedly turned down a substantial bribe during the 1860 race from the second-placed jockey and instead rode on to win;
*Battleship, the only horse to have won both the Grand National and the American Grand National, and his jockey Bruce Hobbs, who remains the youngest jockey to win the Aintree race;
*George Dockeray, who alongside Ginger McCain and Fred Rimell trained four National winners, starting with Lottery in the first official Grand National in 1839.

==Sponsorship==
Since 1984 it has been sponsored by 5 different companies.
==Notes==
===Favourites===
In the 71 races of the post-war era (excluding the void race in 1993), the favourite or joint-favourite have only won the race twelve times (in 1950, 1960, 1973, 1982, 1996, 1998, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2019, 2023, and 2024) and have failed to complete the course in 37 Nationals.

===Mares===
Since its inception, 13 mares have won the race, most recently in 1951:

* Charity (1841)
* Miss Mowbray (1852)
* Anatis (1860)
* Jealousy (1861)
* Emblem (1863)
* Emblematic (1864)
* Casse Tete (1872)
* Empress (1880)
* Zoedone (1883)
* Frigate (1889)
* Shannon Lass (1902)
* Sheila&#x27;s Cottage (1948)
* Nickel Coin (1951)
===Greys===
Three greys have won:
*The Lamb (1868, 1871)
*Nicolaus Silver (1961)
*Neptune Collonges (2012)

===Female jockeys===
Since 1977, women have ridden in 24 Grand Nationals. Geraldine Rees became the first to complete the course, on Cheers in 1982. In 2012 Katie Walsh became the first female jockey to earn a placed finish in the race, finishing third on Seabass. Rachael Blackmore became the first female jockey to win with Minella Times in 2021.

===International winners===
* Two French-trained horses have won the Grand National: Huntsman (1862) and Cortolvin (1867). Seven other winners were bred in France — Alcibiade (1865), Reugny (1874), Lutteur III (1909), Mon Mome (2009), Neptune Collonges (2012), Pineau De Re (2014) and I Am Maximus (2024).
* In 1923, Sergeant Murphy became the first U.S.-bred horse to win the race. He is also the joint-second oldest horse to win, at age 13, alongside Why Not (1884). The U.S.-bred Battleship, son of the famous Man o&#x27; War, became the first (and so far only) horse to have won both the Grand National (in 1938) and the American Grand National (which he won four years earlier). Both Jay Trump (1965) and Ben Nevis II (1980) won the Maryland Hunt Cup before winning the Grand National.
* Jockey William Watkinson recorded the first riding success for Australia in 1926. He was killed at Bogside, Scotland, less than three weeks after winning the National.
* 1991 was the seventh and final year that the Grand National was sponsored by Seagram. Aptly, the race was won by a horse named Seagram, bred in New Zealand. 1997 saw another New Zealand-bred winner in Lord Gyllene.
* Count Karl Kinsky recorded the first riding success for Austria when he won the 1883 Grand National while riding his own horse Zoedone.

===Other British winners===
* The only Welsh-trained horse to win was Kirkland in 1905.
* Rubstic, trained by John Leadbetter in Roxburghshire, became the first Scottish-trained winner, with victory in 1979. Two other horses trained in Scotland have won the race, One For Arthur in 2017 and Corach Rambler in 2023, both trained by Lucinda Russell.

===Irish winners===
* Irish-trained horses have enjoyed by far the most success of international participants, with 20 winners since 1900, including twelve since 1999:
===Famous owners===
The 1900 winner Ambush II was owned by HRH Prince of Wales, later to become King Edward VII. In 1950 Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother had her first runner in the race in Monaveen, who finished fifth. Six years later she would witness her Devon Loch collapse on the run-in, just yards from a certain victory.

The favourite for the 1968 race, Different Class, was owned by actor Gregory Peck.

The 1963 winner Ayala and the 1976 winner Rag Trade were both part-owned by celebrity hairdresser Raymond Bessone.

1994 winner Miinnehoma was owned by comedian Freddie Starr.

What A Friend ran in 2011 and 2013 when part-owned by Alex Ferguson, the former manager of Manchester United.

<text>Veghel () is a town and a former municipality in Southern Netherlands. On 1 January 2017 Veghel, together with Schijndel and Sint-Oedenrode, merged into a new municipality called Meierijstad. This created the largest municipality of the province of North Brabant in terms of land area.

== History ==
The first known settlements date to Roman times and were established near the River Aa. The oldest written record of Veghel dates from 1225. It is a document of the Abbey of Berne, written in Latin on a piece of parchment, and describes several properties owned by the abbey. Among those is an estate located in the settlement of &quot;Vehchele&quot;.

In 1310, John II of Brabant granted the inhabitants the right to use common grounds. For some decades in the 16th and 17th century, the municipality was ruled by the Lords Van Erp; they resided at their castle of Frisselsteijn in Veghel.

In 1648 Veghel became part of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. As a former part of the Duchy of Brabant, Veghel is situated in the Meierij of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. 

Like all the other areas of Brabant and Limburg which were transferred to the Netherlands by the Peace of Westphalia), Veghel was a Catholic town. It suffered economic and religious oppression from the Protestant Dutch and was part of the military buffer zone of the Dutch Republic.

In 1719 Veghel became a market town, when it was granted market rights by the States General of the Netherlands. This gave it the privilege of holding weekly markets and four annual fairs. However, it was not until the French wars of 1795 that Veghel formally received freedom of religion again and received a guarantee of full common rights from the Dutch government. 

In 1810 Veghel became part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. From the middle of the 19th century, the agrarian market town began to industrialize as a consequence of the opening of the South Willem&#x27;s Canal. The wealth generated by new industries helped support the construction of large-scale buildings, such as the neogothic church by Pierre Cuypers and the neoclassical town hall, dates from that period. Monastic orders developed Veghel as a regional centre of health care and education, which it remains to this day.

In 1940 Veghel was occupied by German troops. With the beginning of Operation Market Garden in 1944, Veghel was one of the dropping-sites for Allied paratroops owing to its strategic location.

The period since the 1950s has seen much growth, with the development of new industries. Also several international companies (e.g. Mars, Incorporated, FrieslandCampina, DMV International, Agrifirm, Kuehne + Nagel, DHL Supply Chain, Alliance Healthcare, ThyssenKrupp and Vanderlande Industries) have established centers in Veghel. 

Its shopping centre and marketplace earned the town the name of &quot;Pearl of the Meierij&quot;. Veghel is an educational centre for the surrounding district: it has several secondary schools, a senior secondary vocational school, and the Pedagogic Academy, founded in 1872 and one of the oldest higher vocational schools in the area.

Since 1994, Veghel and the neighbouring town of Erp have formed a single municipality.
