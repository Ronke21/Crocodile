<text>&quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list is widely considered the preeminent list of best-selling books in the United States. &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; has published the list weekly since October 12, 1931. In the 21st century, it has evolved into multiple lists, grouped by genre and format, including fiction and nonfiction, hardcover, paperback and e-books.

The list is based on a proprietary method that uses sales figures, other data and internal guidelines that are unpublished—how the &quot;Times&quot; compiles the list is a trade secret. In 1983, during a legal case in which the &quot;Times&quot; was being sued, the &quot;Times&quot; argued that the list is not mathematically objective but rather an editorial product, an argument that prevailed in the courts. In 2017, a &quot;Times&quot; representative said that the goal is that the lists reflect authentic best sellers. The list has been a source of controversy. When the &quot;Times&quot; believes a book has reached the list in a suspicious way—such as through bulk purchases—the book&#x27;s entry on the list is marked with a dagger symbol (†).

==History==
Although the first best seller list in America was published in 1895, in &quot;The Bookman&quot;, a best seller list was not published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; until October 12, 1931, 36 years later, with little fanfare. It listed five fiction and four nonfiction books for New York City only. The next month, the list was expanded to eight cities, each with its own list. By the early 1940s, fourteen city-lists were included. A national list was created on April 9, 1942, in the Sunday &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; as a supplement to the Monday edition regular city lists. The national list was ranked according to how many times the book appeared in the city lists. Eventually the city lists were eliminated, leaving only the national ranking list, which was compiled according to &quot;reports from leading booksellers in 22 cities&quot;. Ranking by bookseller sales figures continues today, although the process has remained proprietary.

By the 1950s, &quot;The Times&quot;″s list had become the leading best-seller list for book professionals to monitor, along with that of &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;. In the 1960s and 1970s, shopping-mall chain bookstores B. Dalton, Crown Books, and Waldenbooks came to the forefront with a business model of selling newly published best-sellers with mass-market appeal. They used the best-selling status of titles to market the books and not just as a measure of sales, thus placing increased emphasis on the &quot;New York Times&quot; list for book readers and book sellers.
==Composition==
The list is compiled by the editors of the &quot;News Surveys&quot; department, not by &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; department, where it is published. It is based on weekly sales reports obtained from selected samples of independent and chain bookstores and wholesalers throughout the United States. The sales figures are widely believed to represent books that have actually been sold at retail, rather than wholesale, as the &quot;Times&quot; surveys booksellers in an attempt to better reflect what is purchased by individual buyers. Some books are flagged with a dagger indicating that a significant number of bulk orders had been received by retail bookstores.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2013 that &quot;we [generally do not] track the sales of classic literature,&quot; and thus, for example, new translations of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; would not be found on the bestseller list.

The exact method for compiling the data obtained from the booksellers is classified as a trade secret. Book Review staff editor Gregory Cowles explained the method &quot;is a secret both to protect our product and to make sure people can&#x27;t try to rig the system. Even in the Book Review itself, we don&#x27;t know (the news surveys department&#x27;s) precise methods.&quot; In 1992, the survey encompassed over 3,000 bookstores as well as &quot;representative wholesalers with more than 28,000 other retail outlets, including variety stores and supermarkets.&quot; By 2004, the number was 4,000 bookstores as well as an unstated number of wholesalers. Data is adjusted to give more weight to independent book stores, which are underrepresented in the sample.

The lists are divided among fiction and nonfiction, print and e-book, paperback and hardcover; each list contains 15 to 20 titles. The lists have been subdivided several times. &quot;Advice, How-To, and Miscellaneous&quot; debuted as a list of five on January 1, 1984. It was created because advice best-sellers were sometimes crowding the general nonfiction list. Its inaugural number one bestseller, &quot;The Body Principal&quot; by Victoria Principal, had been number 10 and number 12 on the nonfiction lists for the two preceding weeks. In July 2000, the &quot;Children&#x27;s Best Sellers&quot; was created after the Harry Potter series had stayed in the top spots on the fiction list for an extended period of time. The children&#x27;s list was printed monthly until February 13, 2011, when it was changed to once an issue (weekly). In September 2007, the paperback fiction list was divided into &quot;trade&quot; and &quot;mass-market&quot; sections, in order to give more visibility to the trade paperbacks that were more often reviewed by the newspaper itself. In November 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced it would be tracking e-book best-seller lists in fiction and nonfiction starting in early 2011. &quot;RoyaltyShare, a San Diego–based company that tracks data and aggregates sales information for publishers, will ... provide [e-book] data&quot;. The two new e-book lists were first published with the February 13, 2011, issue, the first tracks combined print and e-book sales, the second tracks e-book sales only (both lists are further sub-divided into Fiction and Nonfiction). In addition a third new list was published on the web only, which tracks combined print sales (hardcover and paperback) in fiction and nonfiction. On December 16, 2012, the children&#x27;s chapter books list was divided into two new lists: middle-grade (ages 8–12) and young adult (age 12–18), both which include sales across all platforms (hard, paper and e-book).

== Statistics ==
According to an EPJ Data Science study that used big data to analyze every &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling book from 2008 to 2016, of the 100,000 new, hardcover print books published each year, fewer than 500 make it on to &quot;The New York Times Best Seller&quot; list (0.5 percent). Many novels (26 percent) appear on the list for only one week. To make the list, it is estimated that novels sell from 1,000 to 10,000 copies per week, depending on competition. Median sales fluctuate between 4,000 and 8,000 in fiction, and 2,000–6,000 in nonfiction. The majority of &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling books sell from 10,000 to 100,000 copies in their first year.

During the period studied (August 6, 2008, to March 10, 2016), Dan Brown&#x27;s book &quot;The Lost Symbol&quot; held the record with 3 million copies sold in one year followed by &quot;The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets&#x27; Nest&quot; by Stieg Larsson and &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot; by Harper Lee which sold 1.6 million copies each. In nonfiction, more than half of the hardcover books that make the list are in the biography category. The autobiography of George W. Bush, &quot;Decision Points&quot;, sold the most copies in one year followed by the biography &quot;Steve Jobs&quot; by Walter Isaacson.

==Criticisms==
The list has been criticized by authors, publishers, book industry executives, and others for not providing an accurate accounting of true best-seller status. These criticisms have been ongoing ever since the list originated. A book industry report in the 1940s found that best-seller lists were a poor indicator of sales, since they were based on misleading data and were only measuring fast sales. A 2004 report quoted a senior book marketing executive who said the rankings were &quot;smoke and mirrors&quot;; while a report in &quot;Book History&quot; found that many professionals in the book industry &quot;scoffed at the notion that the lists are accurate&quot;.

Specific criticisms include:

*Fast sales. A book that never makes the list can actually outsell books on the best-seller list. This is because the best-seller list reflects sales in a given week, not total sales. Thus, one book may sell heavily in a given week, making the list, while another may sell at a slower pace, never making the list, but selling more copies over time.
*Double counting. By including wholesalers in the polls along with retail bookstores, books may be double-counted. Wholesalers report how much they sell to retailers, and retailers report how much they sell to customers, thus there can be overlap with the same reported book being sold twice within a given time frame. In addition, retailers may return books to wholesalers months later if they never sell, thus resulting in a &quot;sale&quot; being reported that never came to fruition. For example, mass-market paperbacks can see as high as 40% return rates from the retailer back to the wholesaler. 
*Manipulation by authors and publishers. In 1956, author Jean Shepherd created the fake novel &quot;I, Libertine&quot; to illustrate how easy it was to manipulate the best-seller lists based on demand, as well as sales. Fans of Shepherd&#x27;s radio show planted references to the book and author so widely that demand for the book led to claims of it being on the &quot;Times&quot; list. Author Jacqueline Susann (&quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;) attempted to &quot;butter-up&quot; &quot;Times&quot;-reporting booksellers and personally bought large quantities of her own book. Author Wayne Dyer (&quot;Your Erroneous Zones&quot;) purchased thousands of copies of his own book. Al Neuharth (&quot;Confessions of an S. O. B.&quot;), former head of Gannett Company, had his Gannett Foundation buy two thousand copies of his own autobiography. In 1995, authors Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema spent $200,000 to buy ten thousand copies of &quot;The Discipline of Market Leaders&quot; from dozens of bookstores. Although they denied any wrongdoing, the book spent 15 weeks on the list. As a result of this scandal the &quot;Times&quot; began placing a dagger symbol next to any title for which bookstores reported bulk orders. However, daggers do not always appear; for example Tony Hsieh&#x27;s &quot;Delivering Happiness&quot; was known to have been manipulated with bulk orders but did not have a dagger. Companies that contract with authors to manipulate the bestseller list through &quot;bestseller campaigns&quot; include ResultSource.
*Manipulation by retailers and wholesalers. It happens with regularity that wholesalers and retailers deliberately or inadvertently manipulate the sales data they report to the &quot;Times&quot;. Since being on the &quot;Times&quot; best-seller list increases the sales of a book, bookstores and wholesalers may report a book is a best-seller before it actually is one, in order that it might later become a &quot;legitimate&quot; best-seller through increased sales due to its inclusion on the best-seller list, leading to the best-seller list becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy for the booksellers.
*Leading data collection. The &quot;Times&quot; provides booksellers with a form containing a list of books it believes might be bestsellers, to check off, with an alternative &quot;Other&quot; column to fill in manually. It has been criticized as a leading technique to create a best-seller list based on books the &quot;Times&quot; thinks might be included. One bookseller compared it to a voting card in which two options for president are provided: &quot;Bill Clinton and Other&quot;.
*Self-fulfilling. Once a book makes it onto the list it is heavily marketed as a &quot;best-seller&quot;, purchased by readers who seek out best-sellers, given preferential treatment by retailers, online and offline, who create special best-seller categories including special in-store placement and price discounts, and is carried by retailers that generally do not carry other books (e.g., supermarkets). Thus, the list can become self-fulfilling in determining which books have high sales and remain on the list.
*Conflicts of interest. Due to high financial impact of making the list, since the 1970s publishers have created escalator clauses for major authors stipulating that if a book makes the list the author will receive extra money, based on where it ranks and for how long. Authors may also be able to charge higher speaking fees for the status of being a best-seller. As &quot;Book History&quot; said, &quot;With so much at stake then, it is no wonder that enormous marketing effort goes into getting a book access to this major marketing tool.&quot;
*Political bias. A 2024 investigation by &quot;The Economist&quot; concluded that the list was likely &quot;politically biased&quot;, reporting that &quot;accusations of bias against conservative books may have merit&quot;.

==Controversies==
In 1983, author William Peter Blatty sued &quot;The New York Times&quot; for $6 million, claiming that his book, &quot;Legion&quot; (filmed as &quot;The Exorcist III&quot;), had not been included in the list due to either negligence or intentional falsehood, saying it should have been included due to high sales. The &quot;Times&quot; countered that the list was not mathematically objective but rather was an editorial product and thus protected under the Constitution as free speech. Blatty appealed it to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case. Thus, the lower court ruling stood that the list is editorial content, not objective factual content, so the &quot;Times&quot; had the legal right to exclude the book from the list.

In 1995, Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema, the authors of a book called &quot;The Discipline of Market Leaders&quot;, colluded to manipulate their book onto the best seller charts. The authors allegedly purchased over 10,000 copies of their own book in small and strategically placed orders at bookstores whose sales are reported to BookScan. Because of the benefits of making &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list (speaking engagements, more book deals, and consulting) the authors felt that buying their own work was an investment that would pay for itself. The book climbed to No. 4 on the list where it sat for 15 weeks; it also peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; best seller list. Since such lists hold the power of cumulative advantage, chart success often begets more chart success. Although such efforts are not illegal, publishers consider them unethical.

In 1999, Amazon.com announced a 50% decrease in price for books on the Best Seller List to beat its competition, Barnes &amp; Noble. After a legal dispute between Amazon and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Amazon was permitted to keep using the list on condition that it displayed it in alphabetical rather than numerical order. By 2010, this was no longer the case; Amazon now displays the best-seller list in order of best-selling titles first.

In 2013, &quot;Forbes&quot; published a story titled &quot;Here&#x27;s How You Buy Your Way Onto &quot;The New York Times&quot; Bestsellers List.&quot; The article discusses how ResultSource, a San Diego–based marketing consultancy, specializes in ensuring books make a bestseller list, even guaranteeing a No. 1 spot for those willing to pay enough. &quot;The New York Times&quot; was informed of this practice and responded: &quot;&quot;The New York Times&quot; comprehensively tracks and tabulates the weekly unit sales of all titles reported by book retailers as their general interest bestsellers. We will not comment beyond our methodology on the other questions.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; did not alert its readers to this, unlike &quot;The Wall Street Journal,&quot; which admitted that books had landed on its bestseller list due to ResultSource&#x27;s campaign. Soren Kaplan, the source who admitted he had paid ResultSource to land his book, &quot;Leapfrogging&quot;, on &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;″s bestseller list, revealed the methodology on his blog; he posted: &quot;If I could obtain bulk orders before &quot;Leapfrogging&quot; was released, ResultSource would purchase the books on my behalf using their tried-and-true formula. Three thousand books sold would get me on &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; bestseller list. Eleven thousand would secure a spot on the biggest prize of them all, &quot;The New York Times&quot; list.&quot;

In 2014, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published a story titled &quot;Can bestseller lists be bought?&quot; It describes how author and pastor Mark Driscoll contracted the company ResultSource to place his book &quot;Real Marriage&quot; (2012) on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for a $200,000 fee. The contract was for ResultSource &quot;to conduct a bestseller campaign for your book, &quot;Real Marriage&quot; on the week of January 2, 2012. The bestseller campaign is intended to place &quot;Real Marriage&quot; on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list for the Advice How-to list.&quot; To achieve this, the contract stated that &quot;RSI will be purchasing at least 11,000 total orders in one week.&quot; This took place, and the book successfully reached No.1 on the hardcover advice bestseller list on January 22, 2014.

In July 2015, Ted Cruz&#x27;s book &quot;A Time For Truth&quot; was excluded from the list because the &quot;overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales [of Cruz&#x27;s book] were limited to strategic bulk purchases&quot; to artificially increase sales and entry onto the list. In response, Cruz called the &quot;Times&quot; &quot;a liar&quot; and demanded an apology. The &quot;Times&quot; said it stood by its statement and evidence of manipulation.

In August 2017, a young adult fiction book, &quot;Handbook for Mortals&quot; by previously unpublished author Lani Sarem was removed from the list, where it was in initially in the No. 1 spot. According to a statement issued by the &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;after investigating the inconsistencies in the most recent reporting cycle, we decided that the sales for &quot;Handbook for Mortals&quot; did not meet our criteria for inclusion. We&#x27;ve issued an updated &#x27;Young Adult Hardcover&#x27; list for September 3, 2017 which does not include that title.&quot; It was uncovered, by author Phil Stamper, that there had been unusual bulk ordering patterns which inflated the number of sales. The book is published by GeekNation, an entertainment website based in Los Angeles. The book was originally written as a script, and was rewritten as a novel in an attempt to launch a film franchise.

In August 2017, conservative publisher Regnery Publishing said it would no longer allow its writers to claim to be &quot;&quot;New York Times&quot; best-selling authors&quot; due to its belief that the &quot;Times&quot; favors liberal books on the list. The &quot;Times&quot; responded that the political views of authors have no bearing on the list and noted conservative authors routinely rank highly on the list. The Associated Press noted the &quot;Times&quot; is a frequent target of conservatives and Republicans. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called Regnery&#x27;s ban a &quot;stunt&quot; designed to increase sales, &quot;What better way to sell a book to a conservative audience than to promote the idea that the &quot;New York Times&quot; doesn&#x27;t like it?&quot; The &quot;Post&quot; compared the list to best seller lists from &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; looking for bias but could not find anything convincing.

In February 2018, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; published a story by books editor Deborah Dundas who found that the best-selling book &quot;12 Rules for Life&quot; by Jordan Peterson, who topped &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; chart list, did not even chart on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestsellers list, without reliable answers from the &quot;New York Times&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; stated it was not counted because it was published by a Canadian company. According to Random House Canada, the book was handled properly for the U.S. market. American conservative commentator Dennis Prager wrote an article for &quot;National Review&quot; titled &quot;&quot;The Times&quot; Best-Seller List: Another Reason Americans Don&#x27;t Trust the Media&quot; in which he contends that the issue with Peterson&#x27;s book, as well his &quot;The Rational Bible: Exodus&quot;, is their conservative context and the lack of inclusion is the American mainstream media&#x27;s manipulation. The &quot;Times&quot; denied any bias.

In 2019, the release of Donald Trump Jr.&#x27;s book &quot;Triggered&quot; was shown to have only reached the best-seller list through approximately $100,000 in behind-the-scenes bulk purchases meant to pump up its sales numbers illegitimately. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; reported in October 2020 that this sort of gaming of the system has been a common practice among American conservative political figures, and has also included the use of political campaign funds to purchase the books in bulk in order to boost their rank on the list.

==Studies==
A Stanford Business School analysis suggests that the &quot;majority of book buyers seem to use the &quot;Times&quot;″ list as a signal of what&#x27;s worth reading&quot;. The study concluded that lesser-known writers get the biggest benefit from being on the list, while perennial best-selling authors, such as John Grisham or Danielle Steel, see no benefit of additional sales.

<text>Émile Gagnan (1900 – 1984) was a French engineer and, in 1943, co-inventor with French Navy diver Jacques-Yves Cousteau of the Aqua-Lung, the diving regulator (a.k.a. demand-valve) used for the first Scuba equipment. The demand-valve, or regulator, was designed for regulating gas in gas-generator engines, but was found to be excellent for regulating air-supply under varied pressure conditions. This allowed people to explore the ocean more easily, even though the original purpose was different.

Gagnan was born in the French province of Burgundy in November 1900, and graduated from technical school in the early 1920s. He was employed as an engineer specializing in high-pressure pneumatic design by the large gas-supply firm Air Liquide. The first production &#x27;Scaphandre Autonome&#x27; - or &#x27;Aqualung&#x27; was released in France in 1946 under the identification code &quot;CG45&quot; (&quot;C&quot; for Cousteau, &quot;G&quot; for Gagnan and &quot;45&quot; for 1945, year of the patent).

A year later, in 1947, Émile Gagnan and his family emigrated to Montreal, Quebec, Canada and he transferred to the employ of Canadian Liquid Air Ltd. There he set up a lab and proceeded to engineer, design, prototype and patent a very large number of SCUBA and undersea technology firsts, including the direct ancestors of virtually every type of Scuba regulator in common use today.

<text>Pulse-width modulation (PWM), also known as pulse-duration modulation (PDM) or pulse-length modulation (PLM), is any method of representing a signal as a rectangular wave with a varying duty cycle (and for some methods also a varying period).

PWM is useful for controlling the average power or amplitude delivered by an electrical signal. The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the load is controlled by switching the supply between 0 and 100% at a rate faster than it takes the load to change significantly. The longer the switch is on, the higher the total power supplied to the load. Along with maximum power point tracking (MPPT), it is one of the primary methods of controlling the output of solar panels to that which can be utilized by a battery. PWM is particularly suited for running inertial loads such as motors, which are not as easily affected by this discrete switching. The goal of PWM is to control a load; however, the PWM switching frequency must be selected carefully in order to smoothly do so.

The PWM switching frequency can vary greatly depending on load and application. For example, switching only has to be done several times a minute in an electric stove; 100 or 120 Hz (double of the utility frequency) in a lamp dimmer; between a few kilohertz (kHz) and tens of kHz for a motor drive; and well into the tens or hundreds of kHz in audio amplifiers and computer power supplies. Choosing a switching frequency that is too high for the application may cause premature failure of mechanical control components despite getting smooth control of the load. Selecting a switching frequency that is too low for the application causes oscillations in the load. The main advantage of PWM is that power loss in the switching devices is very low. When a switch is off there is practically no current, and when it is on and power is being transferred to the load, there is almost no voltage drop across the switch. Power loss, being the product of voltage and current, is thus in both cases close to zero. PWM also works well with digital controls, which, because of their on/off nature, can easily set the needed duty cycle. PWM has also been used in certain communication systems where its duty cycle has been used to convey information over a communications channel.

In electronics, many modern microcontrollers (MCUs) integrate PWM controllers exposed to external pins as peripheral devices under firmware control. These are commonly used for direct current (DC) motor control in robotics, switched-mode power supply regulation, and other applications.

==Duty cycle==
The term &quot;duty cycle&quot; describes the proportion of &#x27;on&#x27; time to the regular interval or &#x27;period&#x27; of time; a low duty cycle corresponds to low power, because the power is off for most of the time. Duty cycle is expressed in percent, 100% being fully on. When a digital signal is on half of the time and off the other half of the time, the digital signal has a duty cycle of 50% and resembles a &quot;square&quot; wave. When a digital signal spends more time in the on state than the off state, it has a duty cycle of &gt;50%. When a digital signal spends more time in the off state than the on state, it has a duty cycle of &lt;50%. Here is a pictorial that illustrates these three scenarios:

==History==
The Corliss steam engine was patented in 1849. It used pulse-width modulation to control the intake valve of a steam engine cylinder. A centrifugal governor was used to provide automatic feedback.

Some machines (such as a sewing machine motor) require partial or variable power. In the past, control (such as in a sewing machine&#x27;s foot pedal) was implemented by use of a rheostat connected in series with the motor to adjust the amount of current flowing through the motor. It was an inefficient scheme, as this also wasted power as heat in the resistor element of the rheostat, but tolerable because the total power was low. While the rheostat was one of several methods of controlling power (see autotransformers and Variac for more info), a low cost and efficient power switching/adjustment method was yet to be found. This mechanism also needed to be able to drive motors for fans, pumps and robotic servomechanisms, and needed to be compact enough to interface with lamp dimmers. PWM emerged as a solution for this complex problem.

The Philips, N. V. company designed an optical scanning system (published in 1946) for variable area film soundtrack which produced the PWM. It was intended to reduce noise when playing back a film soundtrack. The proposed system had a threshold between &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; parts of soundtrack.

One early application of PWM was in the Sinclair X10, a 10 W audio amplifier available in kit form in the 1960s. At around the same time, PWM started to be used in AC motor control.

Of note, for about a century, some variable-speed electric motors have had decent efficiency, but they were somewhat more complex than constant-speed motors, and sometimes required bulky external electrical apparatus, such as a bank of variable power resistors or rotating converters such as the Ward Leonard drive.

==Principle==
=== Periodic pulse wave ===
If we consider a periodic pulse wave formula_1 with period formula_2, low value formula_3, a high value formula_4 and a constant duty cycle D (Figure 1), the average value of the waveform is given by:

formula_5

As formula_1 is a pulse wave, its value is formula_4 for formula_8 and formula_3 for formula_10. The above expression then becomes:

formula_11

This latter expression can be fairly simplified in many cases where formula_12 as formula_13. From this, the average value of the signal (formula_14) is directly dependent on the duty cycle D.

However, by varying (i.e. modulating) the duty cycle (and possibly also the period), the following more advanced pulse-width modulated waves allow variation of the average value of the waveform.

=== Intersective method PWM ===
The intersective method is a simple way to generate a PWM output signal (magenta in above figure) with fixed period and varying duty cycle is by using a comparator to switch the PWM output state when the input waveform (red) intersects with a sawtooth or a triangle waveform (blue).

Depending on the type of sawtooth or triangle waveform (green in below figure), intersective PWM signals (blue in the below figure) can be aligned in three manners:

* Leading edge modulation (top plot) uses a reverse sawtooth wave to generate the PWM. The PWM&#x27;s leading edge is held at the leading edge of the window and the trailing edge is modulated.
* Trailing edge modulation (middle plot) uses a normal sawtooth wave to generate the PWM. The PWM&#x27;s trailing edge is fixed and the leading edge is modulated.
* Centered pulses (bottom) uses a triangle waveform to generate the PWM. The pulse center is fixed in the center of the time window and both edges of the pulse are moved to compress or expand the width.

==== Time proportioning ====
Many digital circuits can generate PWM signals (e.g., many microcontrollers have PWM outputs). They normally use a counter that increments periodically (it is connected directly or indirectly to the clock of the circuit) and is reset at the end of every period of the PWM. When the counter value is more than the reference value, the PWM output changes state from high to low (or low to high). This technique is referred to as time proportioning, particularly as time-proportioning control – which &quot;proportion&quot; of a fixed cycle time is spent in the high state.

The incremented and periodically reset counter is the discrete version of the intersecting method&#x27;s sawtooth. The analog comparator of the intersecting method becomes a simple integer comparison between the current counter value and the digital (possibly digitized) reference value. The duty cycle can only be varied in discrete steps, as a function of the counter resolution. However, a high-resolution counter can provide quite satisfactory performance.

==== Spectrum ====
The resulting spectra (of the three alignments) are similar. Each contains a DC component, a base sideband containing the modulating signal, and phase modulated carriers at each harmonic of the frequency of the pulse. The amplitudes of the harmonic groups are restricted by a formula_15 envelope (sinc function) and extend to infinity. The infinite bandwidth is caused by the nonlinear operation of the pulse-width modulator. In consequence, a digital PWM suffers from aliasing distortion that significantly reduce its applicability for modern communication systems. By limiting the bandwidth of the PWM kernel, aliasing effects can be avoided.

On the contrary, delta modulation and delta-sigma modulation are random processes that produces a continuous spectrum without distinct harmonics. While intersective PWM uses a fixed period but a varying duty cycle, the period of delta and delta-sigma modulated PWMs varies in addition to their duty cycle.

===Delta modulation===
Delta modulation produces a PWM signal (magenta in above figure) which changes state whenever its integral (blue) hits the limits (green) surrounding the input (red). 

=== Asynchronous delta-sigma PWM ===


Asynchronous (i.e. unclocked) delta-sigma modulation produces a PWM output (blue in bottom plot) which is subtracted from the input signal (green in top plot) to form an error signal (blue in top plot). This error is integrated (magenta in middle plot). When the integral of the error exceeds the limits (the upper and lower grey lines in middle plot), the PWM output changes state. By integrating the difference of the error with the input signal, delta-sigma modulation shapes noise of the resulting spectrum to be more in higher frequencies above the input signal&#x27;s band.

===Space vector modulation===

Space vector modulation is a PWM control algorithm for multi-phase AC generation, in which the reference signal is sampled regularly; after each sample, non-zero active switching vectors adjacent to the reference vector and one or more of the zero switching vectors are selected for the appropriate fraction of the sampling period in order to synthesize the reference signal as the average of the used vectors.

===Direct torque control (DTC)===

Direct torque control is a method used to control AC motors. It is closely related with the delta modulation (see above). Motor torque and magnetic flux are estimated and these are controlled to stay within their hysteresis bands by turning on a new combination of the device&#x27;s semiconductor switches each time either signal tries to deviate out of its band.

===PWM sampling theorem===
The process of PWM conversion is non-linear and it is generally supposed that low pass filter signal recovery is imperfect for PWM. The PWM sampling theorem shows that PWM conversion can be perfect:

Any bandlimited baseband signal whose amplitude is within ±0.637 can be represented by a PWM waveform of unit amplitude (±1). The number of pulses in the waveform is equal to the number of Nyquist samples and the peak constraint is independent of whether the waveform is two-level or three-level.

For comparison, the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem can be summarized as:

If you have a signal that is bandlimited to a bandwidth of f0 then you can collect all the information there is in that signal by sampling it at discrete times, as long as your sample rate is greater than 2f0.

==Applications==

===Servos===
PWM is used to control servomechanisms; see servo control.

===Telecommunications===
In telecommunications, PWM is a form of signal modulation where the widths of the pulses correspond to specific data values encoded at one end and decoded at the other.

Pulses of various lengths (the information itself) will be sent at regular intervals (the carrier frequency of the modulation).

The inclusion of a clock signal is not necessary, as the leading edge of the data signal can be used as the clock if a small offset is added to each data value in order to avoid a data value with a zero length pulse.

===Power delivery===
PWM can be used to control the amount of power delivered to a load without incurring the losses that would result from linear power delivery by resistive means. Drawbacks to this technique are that the power drawn by the load is not constant but rather discontinuous (see Buck converter), and energy delivered to the load is not continuous either. However, the load may be inductive, and with a sufficiently high frequency and when necessary using additional passive electronic filters, the pulse train can be smoothed and average analog waveform recovered. Power flow into the load can be continuous. Power flow from the supply is not constant and will require energy storage on the supply side in most cases. (In the case of an electrical circuit, a capacitor to absorb energy stored in (often parasitic) supply side inductance.)

High frequency PWM power control systems are easily realisable with semiconductor switches. As explained above, almost no power is dissipated by the switch in either on or off state. However, during the transitions between on and off states, both voltage and current are nonzero and thus power is dissipated in the switches. By quickly changing the state between fully on and fully off (typically less than 100 nanoseconds), the power dissipation in the switches can be quite low compared to the power being delivered to the load.

Modern semiconductor switches such as MOSFETs or insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) are well suited components for high-efficiency controllers. Frequency converters used to control AC motors may have efficiencies exceeding 98%. Switching power supplies have lower efficiency due to low output voltage levels (often even less than 2 V for microprocessors are needed) but still more than 70–80% efficiency can be achieved.

Variable-speed computer fan controllers usually use PWM, as it is far more efficient when compared to a potentiometer or rheostat. (Neither of the latter is practical to operate electronically; they would require a small drive motor.)

Light dimmers for home use employ a specific type of PWM control. Home-use light dimmers typically include electronic circuitry that suppresses current flow during defined portions of each cycle of the AC line voltage. Adjusting the brightness of light emitted by a light source is then merely a matter of setting at what voltage (or phase) in the AC half-cycle the dimmer begins to provide electric current to the light source (e.g. by using an electronic switch such as a triac). In this case the PWM duty cycle is the ratio of the conduction time to the duration of the half AC cycle defined by the frequency of the AC line voltage (50 Hz or 60 Hz depending on the country).

These rather simple types of dimmers can be effectively used with inert (or relatively slow reacting) light sources such as incandescent lamps, for example, for which the additional modulation in supplied electrical energy which is caused by the dimmer causes only negligible additional fluctuations in the emitted light. Some other types of light sources such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), however, turn on and off extremely rapidly and would perceivably flicker if supplied with low-frequency drive voltages. Perceivable flicker effects from such rapid response light sources can be reduced by increasing the PWM frequency. If the light fluctuations are sufficiently rapid (faster than the flicker fusion threshold), the human visual system can no longer resolve them and the eye perceives the time average intensity without flicker.

In electric cookers, continuously variable power is applied to the heating elements such as the hob or the grill using a device known as a simmerstat. This consists of a thermal oscillator running at approximately two cycles per minute and the mechanism varies the duty cycle according to the knob setting. The thermal time constant of the heating elements is several minutes so that the temperature fluctuations are too small to matter in practice.

===Voltage regulation===
PWM is also used in efficient voltage regulators. By switching the voltage to the load with the appropriate duty cycle, the output will approximate a voltage at the desired level. The switching noise is usually filtered with an inductor and a capacitor.

One method measures the output voltage. When it is lower than the desired voltage, it turns on the switch. When the output voltage is above the desired voltage, it turns off the switch.

===Audio effects and amplification===
Varying the duty cycle of a pulse waveform in a synthesis instrument creates useful timbral variations. Some synthesizers have a duty-cycle trimmer for their square-wave outputs, and that trimmer can be set by ear; the 50% point (true square wave) is distinctive because even-numbered harmonics essentially disappear at 50%. Pulse waves, usually 50%, 25%, and 12.5%, make up the soundtracks of classic video games. The term PWM as used in sound (music) synthesis refers to the ratio between the high and low level being secondarily modulated with a low-frequency oscillator. This gives a sound effect similar to chorus or slightly detuned oscillators played together. (In fact, PWM is equivalent to the sum of two sawtooth waves with one of them inverted.) 

Class-D amplifiers produce a PWM equivalent of a lower frequency input signal that can be sent to a loudspeaker via a suitable filter network to block the carrier and recover the original lower frequency signal. Since they switch power directly from the high supply rail and low supply rail, these amplifiers have efficiency above 90% and can be relatively compact and light, even for large power outputs. For a few decades, industrial and military PWM amplifiers have been in common use, often for driving servomotors. Field-gradient coils in MRI machines are driven by relatively high-power PWM amplifiers.

Historically, a crude form of PWM has been used to play back PCM digital sound on the PC speaker, which is driven by only two voltage levels, typically 0 V and 5 V. By carefully timing the duration of the pulses, and by relying on the speaker&#x27;s physical filtering properties (limited frequency response, self-inductance, etc.) it was possible to obtain an approximate playback of mono PCM samples, although at a very low quality, and with greatly varying results between implementations. The Sega 32X uses PWM to play sample-based sound in its games.

In more recent times, the Direct Stream Digital sound encoding method was introduced, which uses a generalized form of pulse-width modulation called pulse-density modulation, at a high enough sampling rate (typically in the order of MHz) to cover the whole acoustic frequencies range with sufficient fidelity. This method is used in the SACD format, and reproduction of the encoded audio signal is essentially similar to the method used in class-D amplifiers.

===Electrical===
SPWM (sine–triangle pulse-width modulation) signals are used in micro-inverter design (used in solar and wind power applications). These switching signals are fed to the FETs that are used in the device. The device&#x27;s efficiency depends on the harmonic content of the PWM signal. There is much research on eliminating unwanted harmonics and improving the fundamental strength, some of which involves using a modified carrier signal instead of a classic sawtooth signal in order to decrease power losses and improve efficiency. Another common application is in robotics where PWM signals are used to control the speed of the robot by controlling the motors.

===Soft-blinking LED indicator===
PWM techniques would typically be used to make some indicator (like an LED) &quot;soft blink&quot;. The light will slowly go from dark to full intensity, and slowly dimmed to dark again. Then it repeats. The period would be several soft blinks per second up to several seconds for one blink. An indicator of this type would not disturb as much as a &quot;hard-blinking&quot; on/off indicator. The indicator lamp on the Apple iBook G4, PowerBook 6,7 (2005) was of this type. This kind of indicator is also called &quot;pulsing glow&quot;, as opposed to calling it &quot;flashing&quot;.

<text>Andoni Goikoetxea Olaskoaga (born 23 August 1956), Goiko for short, is a Spanish former football centre-back and manager.

He was known for his aggressive play, and was nicknamed &quot;The Butcher of Bilbao&quot;. He mainly played for Athletic Bilbao, being known as &quot;El Gigante de Alonsotegui&quot; (The Giant of Alonsotegui) among the club&#x27;s fans.

Goikoetxea was a Spanish international in the 1980s. He won 39 caps, and represented the country in the 1986 World Cup and Euro 1984.

==Club career==
===Athletic Bilbao===
Born in Alonsotegi, Biscay, Goikoetxea began playing football with local Arbuyo before joining Athletic Bilbao in 1973 where, after starting out at the reserve side, he soon established himself in the senior team squad. He scored four La Liga goals in 27 games in his debut season, but played a lesser role in the following three years with a total of only 24 appearances.

During the 1980s, along with Dani, José Ramón Gallego, José Núñez, Manuel Sarabia and Andoni Zubizarreta, &quot;Goiko&quot; was a prominent member of the successful Bilbao side coached by Javier Clemente. In 1984 the Basque club renewed its league title, also achieving the double (league and Copa del Rey) in that year.

====Maradona foul====

On 24 September 1983, Goikoetxea achieved notoriety for a foul on Diego Maradona described as &quot;one of the most brutal fouls ever delivered in the history of Spanish football&quot;. In a league match at the Camp Nou, he tackled the Argentine from behind and broke his ankle. Maradona compared the sound he heard to that of wood breaking and, in the aftermath, English journalist Edward Owen coined the phrase &quot;Butcher of Bilbao&quot; to describe Goikoetxea, a nickname which stayed with him for the rest of his career. Maradona&#x27;s compatriot César Luis Menotti, the coach of FC Barcelona, accused the Spaniard of &quot;belonging to a &#x27;race of anti-footballers&#x27;&quot; and called for a lifelong ban; he was served a ten-match ban by the Royal Spanish Football Federation. It was later reported he kept &quot;the boot he had used to destroy...(Maradona&#x27;s) ankle ligaments&quot; at home in a glass case.

Two seasons earlier, Goikoetxea had severely injured Barcelona midfielder Bernd Schuster, leaving him with a serious right knee injury from which the German never fully recovered. When the two teams met in the 1984 Copa del Rey final in May, the match ended 1–0 for Athletic. Featuring in a mass brawl on the pitch, he kicked Maradona&#x27;s chest; he was initially banned for 18 games for his actions, but the suspension was later reduced to seven.

===Later career===
After three years with Atlético Madrid where he featured sparingly, Goikoetxea retired aged 33. He appeared in 369 competitive matches for Athletic, netting 44 times.

==International career==
Goikoetxea played 39 matches with Spain, making his debut against the Netherlands on 16 February 1983. He represented the nation at both UEFA Euro 1984 and the 1986 FIFA World Cup. During the latter competition he scored one of his four international goals, through a penalty in a round-of-16 5–1 win against Denmark – the remaining four came courtesy of Emilio Butragueño.

==Coaching career==
Goikoetxea became a coach two years after retiring, starting to work at club level in 1996 and going on to be in charge of UD Salamanca (twice), SD Compostela, CD Numancia (two spells), Racing de Santander and Rayo Vallecano. In the 1996–97 season he guided Salamanca to promotion from the Segunda División, finishing second. He was assistant with the Spain national team to his former manager Clemente, during the 1994 World Cup held in the United States.

In June 2007, Goikoetxea joined Alicante-based Hércules CF in the second tier, being released at the end of the campaign after being suspended by the club for implying its internal structures &quot;stank&quot;. In late February 2013 he was appointed coach of Equatorial Guinea, being dismissed in January 2015 just three weeks before the start of the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations due to poor performance in friendlies, which included a loss to a lower league side in Portugal.

==Style of play==
Goikoetxea was notorious for his aggressive style of play, not least because of the two heavy fouls (see Maradona foul) on Maradona and Schuster which earned him the nickname &quot;Butcher of Bilbao&quot;. In 2007, English newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; named him the &quot;hardest defender of all time&quot;.

<text>Fritillaria (fritillaries) is a genus of spring flowering herbaceous bulbous perennial plants in the lily family (Liliaceae). The type species, &quot;Fritillaria meleagris&quot;, was first described in Europe in 1571, while other species from the Middle East and Asia were also introduced to Europe at that time. The genus has about 130–140 species divided among eight subgenera. The flowers are usually solitary, nodding and bell-shaped with bulbs that have fleshy scales, resembling those of lilies. They are known for their large genome size and genetically are very closely related to lilies. They are native to the temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere, from the Mediterranean and North Africa through Eurasia and southwest Asia to western North America. Many are endangered due to enthusiastic picking.

The name &quot;Fritillaria&quot; is thought to refer to the checkered pattern of &quot;F. meleagris&quot;, resembling a box in which dice were carried. Fritillaries are commercially important in horticulture as ornamental garden plants and also in traditional Chinese medicine, which is also endangering some species. &quot;Fritillaria&quot; flowers have been popular subjects for artists to depict and as emblems of regions and organizations.

== Description ==
=== General ===
&quot;Fritillaria&quot; is a genus of perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes, dying back after flowering to an underground storage bulb from which they regrow in the following year. It is characterised by nodding (pendant) flowers, perianths campanulate (bell- or cup-shaped) with erect segments in upper part, a nectarial pit, groove or pouch at the base of the tepal, anthers usually pseudobasifixed, rarely versatile, fruit sometimes winged, embryo minute.

=== Specific ===
==== Vegetative ====

; Bulbs
The bulbs are typically tunicate, consisting of a few tightly packed fleshy scales with a translucent tunic that disappears with further growth of the bulb. However, some species (&quot;F. imperialis&quot;, &quot;F. persica&quot;) have naked bulbs with many scales and loosely attached bulbils, resembling those of the closely related &quot;Lilium&quot;, although &quot;F. persica&quot; has only a single scale.

; Stems and leaves
The stems have few or many cauline leaves (arising from the stem) that are opposite on the stem or verticillate (arranged in whorls), sometimes with a cirrhose apex (ending in a tendril).

==== Reproductive ====

; Inflorescence and flowers
The inflorescence bears flowers that are often solitary and nodding, but some form umbels or have racemes with many flowers. The flowers are usually actinomorphic (radially symmetric), but weakly zygomorphic (single plane of symmetry) in &quot;F. gibbosa&quot; and &quot;F. ariana&quot;. The campanulate perianth has six tepals, in two free whorls of three (trimerous), that can be white, yellow, green, purple or reddish. The erect segments are usually tesselated with squares of alternating light and dark colours. While the tepals are usually the same size in both whorls, in &quot;F. pallidiflora&quot;, the outer tepals are wider. The tepals have nectarial pits, grooves (&quot;F. sewerzowii&quot;) or pouches at their base. In &quot;F. persica&quot; the nectarial pouch is developed into a short spur. The perigonal nectaries are large and well developed, and in most species (with the exception of subgenus &quot;Rhinopetalum&quot;), are linear to lanceolate or ovate and weakly impressed upon the tepals.

; Gynoecium
The flowers are bisexual, containing both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics. The pistil has three carpels (tricarpellary). The ovaries are hypogynous (superior, that is attached above the other floral parts). The ovule is anatropous in orientation and has two integuments (bitegmic), the micropyle (opening) being formed from the inner integument, while the nucellus is small. The embryo sac or megagametophyte is tetrasporic, in which all four megaspores survive. The style is trilobate to trifid (in 3 parts) and the surface of the stigma is wet.

; Androecium
Stamens are six, in two trimerous whorls of three, and diplostemonous (outer whorl of stamens opposite outer tepals and the inner whorl opposite inner tepals). Filaments filiform or slightly flattened, but sometimes papillose and rarely hairy (&quot;F. karelinii&quot;). Anthers are linear to ellipsoid, but rarely subglobose (&quot;F. persica&quot;) in shape, and their attachment to the filament is usually pseudobasifixed (connective tissue extends in a tube around the filament tip), rarely attached at the centre and free (dorsifixed versatile; &quot;F. fusca&quot; and some &quot;Liliorhiza&quot; species). In contrast, pseudobasifixed anthers can not move freely. The pollen grains are spheroidal and reticulate (net like pattern), with individual brochi (lumina within reticulations) of 4–5 μm.

; Fruit and seeds
The capsule is obovoid to globose, loculicidal and six-angled, sometimes with wings. The seeds are flattened with a marginal wing, the seed coat made out of both integuments, but the testa is thin and the endosperm lacks starch. The embryo is small.

=== Phytochemistry ===

Fritillaria, like other members of the family Liliaceae, contain flavonol glycosides and tri- and diferulic-acid sucrose esters, steroidal alkaloids, saponins and terpenoids that have formed the active ingredients in traditional medicine (&quot;see Traditional medicine&quot;). Certain species have flowers that emit disagreeable odors that have been referred to as phenolic, putrid, sulfurous, sweaty and skunky. The scent of &quot;Fritillaria imperialis&quot; has been called &quot;rather nasty&quot;, while that of &quot;F. agrestis&quot;, known commonly as stink bells, is reminiscent of canine feces. On the other hand, &quot;F. striata&quot; has a sweet fragrance. The &quot;foxy&quot; odor of &quot;F. imperialis&quot; has been identified as 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol (dimethylallyl mercaptan), an alkylthiol.

=== Genome ===

&quot;Fritillaria&quot; represents one of the most extreme cases of genome size expansion in angiosperms. Polyploidy is rare, with nearly all species being diploid and only occasional reports of triploidy. Reported genome size in &quot;Fritillaria&quot; vary from 1Cx (DNA content of unreplicated haploid chromosome complement) values of 30.15 to 85.38 Gb (Giga base pairs), that is &gt; 190 times that of &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;, which has been called the &quot;model plant&quot; and &gt; 860 times that of &quot;Genlisea aurea&quot;, which represents the smallest land plant genome sequenced to date. Giant genome size is generally defined as &gt;35 pg (34 Gb). The largest genomes in diploid &quot;Fritillaria&quot; are found in subgenus &quot;Japonica&quot;, exceeding 85 Gb. At least one species, tetraploid &quot;F. assyriaca&quot;, has a very large genome. With approximately 127 pg (130 Gb), it was for a long time the largest known genome, exceeding the largest vertebrate animal genome known to date, that of the marbled lungfish (&quot;Protopterus aethiopicus&quot;), in size. Heterochromatin levels vary by biogeographic region, with very little in Old World and abundant levels in New World species. Most species have a basic chromosome number of x=12, but x=9, 11 and 13 have been reported.

=== History ===
==== Pre-Linnaean ====

Gerard (1597) states that &quot;Fritillaria&quot; was unknown to the ancients, but certainly it was appearing in the writings of sixteenth century European botanists, including Dodoens (1574, 1583), Lobelius (1576, 1581), and Clusius (1583) in addition to Gerard, and was mentioned by Shakespeare and other authors of the period (see Culture). Species of Fritillaria were known in Persia (Iran) in the sixteenth century, from where they were taken to Turkey. European travelers then brought back specimens together with many other exotic eastern plants to the developing botanical gardens of Europe. By the middle of the sixteenth century there was already a flourishing export trade of various bulbs from Turkey to Europe. In Persia, the first mention in the literature was by Hakim Mo&#x27;men Tonekabon in his &quot;Tohfe Al-Mo&#x27;menin&quot; in 1080 AH ( AD), who described the medicinal properties of &quot;F. imperialis&quot; (&quot;laleh sarnegoun&quot;).

European fritillaries were documented in the wild amongst the Loire meadows in 1570 by Noël Capperon, an Orléans apothecary. He mentioned them to Clusius in correspondence in 1571, and sent him a specimen of &quot;F. meleagris&quot;. He also corresponded with Dodoens. Capperon suggested the name Fritillaria to Clusius, rather than the vernacular variegated lily (&quot;Lilium ou bulbum variegatum&quot;). He stated that the flower was known locally as Fritillaria because of a resemblance to the board used in playing checkers. In recognition of this, the botanical authority is sometimes written &quot;Fritillaria&quot; (Caperon) L.

The first account in a botanical text is by Dodoens in his &quot;Purgantium&quot; (1574) and in more detail in &quot;Stirpium&quot; (1583). In the &quot;Purgantium&quot;, Dodoens describes and illustrates &quot;F. meleagris&quot; as &quot;Meleagris flos&quot;, without mentioning Capperon. He was also aware, through having been sent a picture, of &quot;F. imperialis&quot;, and decided to include it as well, without making a connection. His term for &quot;F. imperialis&quot; was &quot;Corona imperialis&quot;.

Consequently, Lobelius, in his &quot;Plantarum&quot; (1576), gives Dodoens the credit for describing &quot;F. meleagris&quot;. He used the word &quot;Fritillaria&quot; for the first time, describing &quot;F. meleagris&quot;, which he considered to belong to the &quot;Lilio-Narcissus&quot; plants, including tulips. The term &quot;Lilio-Narcissus&quot; refers to an appearance of having lily-like flowers, but a narcissus-like bulb. He called it &quot;Fritillaria&quot; (synonyms &quot;Lilio-Narcissus purpurens variegatus&quot; or &quot;Meleagris flos Dodonaei&quot;). Lobelius also included amongst the lilies, but not as &quot;Fritillaria&quot;, &quot;Corona imperialis&quot; which he mentions originated in Turkey and added what he referred to as &quot;Lilium persicum&quot; (&quot;Fritillaria persica&quot;). In his later vernacular &quot;Kruydtboeck&quot; (1581) he described two species he considered related, Fritillaria &quot;Lilio-Narcissus purpurens variegatus&quot; and &quot;Lilio-Narcissus variegatus atropurpureus Xanctonicus&quot;. He acknowledged that the plant had originally been found near Orleans and then sent to the Netherlands. &quot;Fritillaria is ook een soort van lelie narcis die de oorsprong heeft uit het land van Orléans van waar dat ze gebracht is in Nederland&quot;. In his own language he referred to it as &quot;Fritillaria of heel bruin gespikkelde Lelie-Narcisse&quot;. He also included &quot;Corona imperialis&quot; and &quot;Lilium persicum&quot; as before.

Dodoens had proposed the name &quot;Meleagris flos&quot; or Guinea-fowl flower, for what we now know as &quot;Fritillaria meleagris&quot;, after a resemblance to that bird&#x27;s spotted plumage, then known as &quot;Meleagris avis&quot;. In the seventeenth century, John Parkinson provided an account of twelve species of what he referred to as &quot;Fritillaria&quot; - the checkered daffodil, in his &quot;Paradisus&quot; (1635), correctly placing it as closest to the lilies. He provides his version of Capperon&#x27;s discovery, and suggests that some feel he should be honoured with the name &quot;Narcissus Caparonium&quot;. Often when these exotic new plants entered the English language literature they lacked common names in the language. While Henry Lyte can only describe &quot;F. meleagris&quot; as &quot;Flos meleagris&quot;, &quot;Fritillaria&quot; or &quot;lilionarcissus&quot;, it appears that it was Shakespeare who applied the common name of &quot;chequered&quot;.

Although Clausius had corresponded with Capperon in 1571, he did not publish his account of European flora (other than Spain) till his &quot;Rariorum Pannoniam&quot; of 1583, where he gives an account of Capperon&#x27;s discovery, noting the names, Fritillaria, Meleagris and Lilium variegatum. However he did not consider &quot;F. imperialis&quot; or &quot;F. persica&quot; to be related, calling both of them &quot;Lilium&quot;, &quot;Lilium persicum&quot; and &quot;Lilium susianum&quot; respectively.

==== Post-Linnaean ====

Although the first formal description is attributed to Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in 1694, by convention, the first valid formal description is by Linnaeus, in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; (1753). Therefore, the botanical authority is given as &quot;Tourn. ex L.&quot;. Linnaeus identified five known species of &quot;Fritillaria&quot;, and grouped them in his &quot;Hexandria Monogynia&quot; (six stamens+one pistil), his system being based on sexual characteristics. These characteristics defined the core group of the family Liliaceae for a long time. Linnaeus&#x27; original species were &quot;F. imperialis&quot;, &quot;F. regia&quot; (now &quot;Eucomis regia&quot;), &quot;F. persica&quot;, &quot;F. pyrenaica&quot; and &quot;F. meleagris&quot;. The family Liliaceae was first described by Michel Adanson in 1763, placing &quot;Fritillaria&quot; in section Lilia of that family, but also considering &quot;Imperialis&quot; as a separate genus to &quot;Fritillaria&quot;, together with five other genera. The formal description of the family is attributed to Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789, who included eight genera, including &quot;Imperialis&quot;, in his Lilia.

Although the circumscription of Liliaceae and its subdivisions have undergone considerable revision over the ensuing centuries, the close relationship between &quot;Fritillaria&quot; and &quot;Lilium&quot; the type genus of the family, have ensured that the former has remained part of the core group, which constitutes the modern much-reduced family. For instance, Bentham and Hooker (1883), placed &quot;Fritillaria&quot; and &quot;Lilium&quot; in Liliaceae tribe Tulipeae, together with five other genera.

=== Phylogeny ===

&quot;Fritillaria&quot; is generally considered a monophyletic genus, placed within the tribe Lilieae &quot;s.s.&quot;, where it is a sister group to &quot;Lilium&quot; and the largest member of that tribe. The evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships between the genera currently included in Liliaceae are shown in the following Cladogram:

More recently, some larger phylogenetic studies of Lilieae, &quot;Lilium&quot; and &quot;Fritillaria&quot; have suggested that &quot;Fritillaria&quot; may actually consist of two distinct biogeographical clades (A and B), and that these are in a polytomous relationship with &quot;Lilium&quot;. This could mean that &quot;Fritillaria&quot; is actually two distinct genera, suggesting that the exact relationship is not yet fully resolved.

=== Subdivision ===

The large number of species have traditionally been divided into a number of subgroupings. By 1828, Duby in his treatment of the flora of France, recognized two subgroups, which he called section &quot;Meleagris&quot; and section &quot;Petilium&quot;. By 1874, Baker had divided 55 species into ten subgenera:

In the 1880s, both Bentham and Hooker (1883) and Boissier (1884) independently simplified this by reducing nine of these subgenera to five, which they treated as sections rather than subgenera. Bentham and Hooker, who recognized more than 50 species, transferred the tenth of Baker&#x27;s subgenera, &quot;Notholirion&quot; to &quot;Lilium&quot;. Boissier, by contrast, in his detailed account of oriental species, recognized &quot;Notholirion&quot; as a separate genus, whose status has been maintained since (&quot;see cladogram&quot;). He also divided &quot;Eufritillaria&quot; into subsections.

In the post-Darwinian era, Komarov (1935) similarly segregated &quot;Rhinopetalum&quot; and &quot;Korolkowia&quot; as separate genera, but Turrill and Sealy (1980) more closely followed Boissier, but further divided &quot;Eufritillaria&quot; and placed all American species in &quot;Liliorhiza&quot;. However, the best known and cited of these classification schemes based on plant morphology is that of Martyn Rix, produced by the Fritillaria Group of the Alpine Garden Society in 2001. This listed 165 taxa grouped into 6 subgenera, 130 species, 17 subspecies, and 9 varieties. Rix, who described eight subgenera in all, restored both &quot;Rhinopetalum&quot; and &quot;Korolkowia&quot; as subgenera. He also used series to further subdivide subgenera, kept Boissier&#x27;s four sections, renamed &quot;Eufritillaria&quot; as &quot;Fritillaria&quot;, and added subgenera &quot;Davidii&quot; and &quot;Japonica&quot;. The largest of these is &quot;Fritillaria&quot;, while &quot;Theresia&quot;, &quot;Korolkowia&quot; and &quot;Davidii&quot; are monotypic (containing a single species).

Baker based his classification on the characteristics of the bulb, style, nectary and capsule valves. The large nectaries of &quot;Fritillaria&quot; have been the focus of much of the morphological classification, while the distinct form of the nectaries in &quot;Rhinopetalum&quot; were the basis for considering it a separate genus.

==== Molecular phylogenetics ====

The development of molecular phylogenetics and cladistic analysis has allowed a better understanding of the infrageneric relationships of &quot;Fritillaria&quot; species. Initial studies showed the major infrageneric split to be by biogeographic region into two clades, North America (clade A) and Eurasia (clade B). Clade A corresponded most closely with subgenus &quot;Liliorhiza&quot;.

A subsequent study by Rønsted and colleagues (2005), using an expanded pool of taxa of 37 species including all of Rix&#x27;s subgenera and sections, confirmed the initial split on the basis of geography and supported the broad division of the genus into Rix&#x27;s eight subgenera but not the deeper relationships (sections and series). Clade A corresponds with subgenus &quot;Liliorhiza&quot; centred in California, but a number of species (&quot;F. camschatcensis&quot; - Japan and Siberia), &quot;F. maximowiczii&quot; and &quot;F. dagana&quot; - Russia) are also found in Western Asia. These Asian species form a grade with the true North American species, suggesting an origin in Asia followed by later dispersal. Of clade B, the Eurasian species, the largest subgenus, &quot;Fritillaria&quot;, appeared to be polyphyletic in that &quot;F. pallidiflora&quot; appeared to segregate in subclade B1, with subgenera &quot;Petillium&quot;, &quot;Korolkowia&quot; and &quot;Theresia&quot; while all other species formed a clade within B2.

The phylogenetic, evolutionary and biogeographical relationships between the subgenera are shown in this cladogram:

The number of taxa sampled was subsequently enlarged to 92 species (66% of all species), and all species in each subgenus except &quot;Rhinopetalum&quot; (80%), &quot;Liliorhiza&quot; and &quot;Fritillaria&quot; (60%). This expanded study further resolved the evolutionary relationships between the subgenera but also confirmed the polyphyletic nature of subgenus &quot;Fritillaria&quot; as shown in the following cladogram. The majority of taxa within this subgenus (&quot;Fritillaria&quot; 2) form a subclade centred in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, but with some species ranging into China. The remainder (&quot;Fritillaria&quot; 1), being centred in China and Central Asia, but with some species ranging into North and South Asia. This group is therefore probably a separate subgenus.


=== Subgenera ===





=== Species ===
The genus &quot;Fritillaria&quot; includes about 150 subordinate taxa, including species and subspecies. Estimates of the number of species vary from about 100 through 130–140. The Plant List (2013) includes 141 accepted species names, and 156 taxa in total.

== Biogeography and evolution ==

It is likely that two invasions across the Bering Straits to North America took place within the Lileae, one in each genus, &quot;Lilium&quot; and &quot;Fritillaria&quot;. Within the Eurasian clade, the two subclades differ in bulb type. In subclade B2 (&quot;Fritillaria&quot;, &quot;Rhinopetalum&quot;, and &quot;Japonica&quot;), the bulb type is described as Fritillaria-type, with 2–3 fleshy scales and the tunica derived from the remnants of previous year&#x27;s scales. by contrast subclade B2 (&quot;Petilium&quot;, &quot;Theresia&quot; and &quot;Korolkowia&quot;) differ. Those of &quot;Theresia&quot; and &quot;Korolkowia&quot; are large, consisting of a single large fleshy scale, while &quot;Petilium&quot; species have several large erect imbricate scales. In &quot;Liliorhiza&quot; the bulbs are naked and have numerous scales similar to &quot;Lilium&quot;, but with numerous &quot;rice-grain bulbils&quot;. The location of the bulbils differ from the more common aerial pattern of arising from within the axil of a leaf or inflorescence, as in &quot;Lilium&quot; and &quot;Allium&quot;. Similar bulbils are also found in &quot;Davidii&quot;. These bulbils arise in the axils of the scale leaves. Bulbils confer an evolutionary advantage in vegetative propagation. 

== Etymology ==

When Noël Capperon, an Orléans apothecary, discovered &quot;F. meleagris&quot; growing in the Loire meadows in 1570, he wrote to Carolus Clusius, describing it, and saying that it was known locally as &quot;fritillaria&quot;, supposedly because the checkered pattern on the flower resembled the board on which checkers was played. Clusius believed this to be an error, in that is actually the Latin name for the box in which the dice used in the game were kept, not the board itself.

Some North American species are called &quot;mission bells&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Fritillaria&quot; are distributed in most temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, from western North America, through Europe, the Mediterranean, Middle East and Central Asia to China and Japan. Centres of diversity include Turkey (39 species) and the Zagros Mountains of Iran (14–15 species). Iran is also the centre of diversity of species such as &quot;F. imperialis&quot; and &quot;F. persica&quot;. There are five areas of particularly active evolution and clustering of species - California, Mediterranean Greece and Turkey, Anatolia and the Zagros mountains, central Asia from Uzbekistan to western Xinjiang and the eastern Himalayas in southwestern China. &quot;Fritillaria&quot; species are found in a wide variety of climatic regions and habitats, but about half of them show a preference for full sun in open habitats.

A number of &quot;Fritillaria&quot; are widely introduced. Cultivated fritillaries (&quot;F. meleagris&quot;) have been recorded in British gardens since 1578, but only in the wild since 1736, it is likely to be introduced, rather than be endemic. It is greatly diminished there due to loss of habitat, although persistent along the River Thames in Oxfordshire. &quot;F. imperialis&quot; was introduced into Europe around the 1570s, with Ulisse Aldrovandi sending a drawing to Francesco de&#x27; Medici in Florence, famed for his gardens at Villa di Pratolino in 1578. His friend Jacopo Ligozzi (1547–1627) was also including it in his paintings, as well as &quot;F. persica&quot;. In Britain, &quot;F. imperialis&quot; was first seen in the London garden of James Nasmyth, surgeon to King James I in April 1605.

==Ecology==

The majority of species are spring-flowering. Lily beetles (scarlet lily beetle, &quot;Lilioceris lilii&quot; and &quot;Lilioceris chodjaii&quot;) feed on fritillaries, and may become a pest where these plants are grown in gardens or commercially.

Fritillaria are entomophilous (insect pollinated). Those species with large nectaries (4–12 x 1–4 mm) and have more fructose than glucose in the nectar are most commonly pollinated by wasps, while those with smaller nectaries (2–10 x 1–2 mm) and a more balanced nectar composition are most commonly pollinated by bumblebees.

== Conservation ==

A number of species of Fritillaria are endangered, from over-harvesting, habitat fragmentation, over-grazing and international demand for herbals. These include many species in Greece, and &quot;Fritillaria gentneri&quot; in the pacific Northwest of North America. In Japan, five of the eight endemic species (subgenus &quot;Japonica&quot;) are listed as endangered. In China, the collection of &quot;Fritillaria&quot; bulbs to make traditional medicine, particularly &quot;F. cirrhosa&quot; from southwest China and the eastern Himalayas of Bhutan and Nepal and one of the most intensively harvested of the alpine medicinal plants threatens extinction.

In Iran, &quot;F. imperialis&quot; and &quot;F. persica&quot; are endangered and &quot;F. imperialis&quot; is protected. The genus is threatened by irregular grazing, change in pasture usage, pest (primarily &quot;Lilioceris chodjaii&quot;) migration from pasture destruction, and harvesting by poor people for sale to florists.

One species, &quot;F. delavayi&quot;, has begun to grow brown, greyish flowers to better camouflage amongst the rock of its habitat. Scientists believe it is evolving to combat its biggest predator — humans. Over-picking has greatly decreased the availability of this species in China and even though there is no known difference between the flowers picked in the wild and those grown commercially, hunters continue to believe the wild flowers offer better medicinal benefit.

== Toxicity ==

Most fritillaries contain poisonous steroidal alkaloids such as imperialin in the bulbs and some may even be deadly if ingested in quantity.

==Uses==

The bulbs of a few species, such as &quot;F. affinis&quot;, &quot;F. camschatcensis&quot;, and &quot;F. pudica&quot;, are edible if prepared carefully. They were commonly eaten by indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest coast of North America. The wild species flowering in areas such as Iran have become important for ecotourism, when in late May people come to the Valley of Roses, near Chelgerd, to see &quot;F. imperialis&quot; blooming. The area is also rich in &quot;F. reuteri&quot; and &quot;F. gibbosa&quot;.
 Because of their large genome size, &quot;Fritillaria&quot; species are an important source for genomic studies of the processes involved in genome size diversity and evolution. They also have important commercial value both in horticulture and traditional medicine.

=== Horticulture ===

Species of &quot;Fritillaria&quot; are becoming increasingly popular as ornamental garden plants, and many species and cultivars are commercially available. They are usually grown from dormant bulbs planted in Autumn. As perennials they repeat flower every year, and some species will increase naturally. While &quot;Fritillaria&quot; is mainly harvested from the wild fields for commercial use, the growing price of the herbal product results in over-exploitation and puts the species at risk of depletion.

The following may be most commonly found in cultivation:-

* &quot;Fritillaria acmopetala&quot; - pointed-petal fritillary
* &quot;Fritillaria imperialis&quot; - crown imperial
* &quot;Fritillaria meleagris&quot; - snake&#x27;s head fritillary
* &quot;Fritillaria pallidiflora&quot; - Siberian fritillary
* &quot;Fritillaria persica&quot; - Persian fritillary
* &quot;Fritillaria pyrenaica&quot; - Pyrenean fritillary
=== Traditional medicine ===

Species of &quot;Fritillaria&quot; have been used in traditional medicine in China for over 2,000 years, and are one of the most widely used medicines today. The production of medicines from &quot;F. cirrhosa&quot; is worth US$400 million per annum. Although some are cultivated for this purpose, most are gathered in the wild. In recent years demand has increased leading to over-harvesting of wild populations. In addition to China, &quot;Fritillaria&quot; products are used medicinally in the Himalayas, including India, Nepal and Pakistan, as well as Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia. To meet the demand additional countries such as Turkey and Burma are involved in the collection. The products are used mainly as antitussives, expectorants, and antihypertensives. The active ingredients are thought to be isosteroidal and steroidal alkaloid compounds. Chinese sources suggest 16 species as source material, but this may be an overestimate due to the large number of synonyms in Chinese. Of these, 15 are in subgenus &quot;Fritillaria&quot; (both subclades), but one (&quot;F. anhuiensis&quot;) is in subgenus &quot;Liliorhiza&quot;. &quot;F. imperialis&quot; also has a long history of medicinal usage in China and Iran.

Fritillaria extracts (fritillaria in English, &quot;bulbus fritillariae cirrhosae&quot; in Latin) are used in traditional Chinese medicine under the name (literally &quot;Shell mother from Sichuan&quot;, or just ). Species such as &quot;F. cirrhosa&quot;, &quot;F. thunbergii&quot; and &quot;F. verticillata&quot; are used in cough remedies. They are listed as &quot;chuān bèi&quot; () or &quot;zhè bèi&quot; (Chinese: 浙貝/浙贝), respectively, and are often in formulations combined with extracts of loquat (&quot;Eriobotrya japonica&quot;). &quot;Fritillaria verticillata&quot; bulbs are also traded as &quot;bèi mǔ&quot; or, in Kampō, &quot;baimo&quot; (Chinese/Kanji: 貝母, Katakana: バイモ). In one study fritillaria reduced airway inflammation by suppressing cytokines, histamines, and other compounds of inflammatory response.

== Popular culture ==

Shakespeare, Matthew Arnold and George Herbert and more recently Vita Sackville-West (&quot;The Land&quot; 1927) wrote romantically about fritillaries. Fritillaries were also a favourite of the Dutch flower painters that emerged around 1600, such as Ambrosius Bosschaert and Jacob de Gheyn II, and appeared in Italian art, such as that of Jacopo Ligozzi in the late sixteenth century.

Fritillaries are commonly used as floral emblems. &quot;F. meleagris&quot; (snake&#x27;s head fritillary) is the county flower of Oxfordshire, UK, and the provincial flower of Uppland, Sweden, where it is known as &quot;kungsängslilja&quot; (&quot;Kungsängen lily&quot;). In Germany, &quot;F. meleagris&quot; appears as a heraldic device in a number of municipalities, such as Hetlingen, Seestermühe and Winseldorf, and also in Austria (Großsteinbach).

In Croatia this species is known as &quot;kockavica&quot; (from , ), and the checkerboard pattern of its flowers may have inspired the checkerboard pattern on the nation&#x27;s coat of arms. &quot;F. camschatcensis&quot; (Kamchatka fritillary) is the floral emblem of Ishikawa Prefecture and Obihiro City in Japan. Its Japanese name is &quot;kuroyuri&quot; (クロユリ), meaning &quot;dark lily&quot;. &quot;Fritillaria montana&quot; is the floral emblem of Giardino Botanico Alpino di Pietra Corva, a botanical garden in Italy.

<text>Aqua-Lung was the first open-circuit, self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (or &quot;scuba&quot;) to achieve worldwide popularity and commercial success. This class of equipment is now commonly referred to as a twin-hose diving regulator, or demand valve. The Aqua-Lung was invented in France during the winter of 1942–1943 by two Frenchmen: engineer Émile Gagnan and Jacques Cousteau, who was a Naval Lieutenant (). It allowed Cousteau and Gagnan to film and explore underwater more easily.

The invention revolutionised autonomous underwater diving by providing a compact, reliable system capable of a greater depth range and endurance than its precursors, and was a major factor influencing the development of recreational scuba diving after WWII.

The twin-hose Aqua-Lung demand regulator is the foundation of all modern scuba regulators. A diaphragm is used to control a valve to deliver the breathing gas to the diver on demand, at ambient water pressure. However, the layout has changed to a single hose system, where the second stage is split from the first stage along with the exhaust valve, as they must be kept at the same depth, and repositioned at the diver&#x27;s mouth, eliminating the need for the exhaust hose, and allowing the use of a more rugged, smaller bore hose for the intermediate pressure gas supply to the second stage valve at the mouthpiece, but increasing the load on the diver&#x27;s jaw and releasing bubbles nearer the eyes and ears.

== Mechanism ==

The Aqua-Lung is a &quot;self-contained open-circuit demand&quot; system, which means that breathing gas is provided from high-pressure storage carried by to the diver on demand, when the diver inhales and reduces the pressure in the supply hose, subsequently the flow is shut off when not required. Once breathed, the exhaled gas is vented to the surroundings. Scuba systems invented before the Aqua-Lung were mostly closed circuit rebreather equipment, in which breathing gas flows through an ambient pressure hose to the diver, and exhaled gas is returned through a scrubber which removes carbon dioxide, to a counter-lung reservoir. Some fresh gas is added to maintain the oxygen content and is then circulated back to the diver again in a closed loop. In open circuit free-flow systems, the air is supplied at an approximately constant rate, and the diver uses only a relatively small part of the passing gas.

The original Aqua-Lung regulator was a single stage unit, packaged in a circular brass housing mounted on the cylinder valve behind the diver&#x27;s neck. High pressure gas flows into the regulator from the cylinder valve outlet, and is blocked by the demand valve. When the diver consumes ambient pressure gas, the pressure falls in the low pressure chamber and the diaphragm deforms inwards pushing against the valve lifter. This opens the high pressure valve permitting gas to flow past the valve seat into the low pressure chamber. When the diver stops inhaling, pressure in the low pressure chambers quickly rises until the diaphragm returns to its neutral position and no longer presses on the valve lifter, shutting off the flow until the next breath is taken. On a single stage regulator, the flow rate through the demand valve orifice will vary depending on cylinder pressure for the same opening size, and the opening force required will vary depending on the inlet pressure and orifice area, together making the delivery rate vary as the pressure in the cylinder changes. Flow rate is also affected by downstream pressure, which varies with depth, so the effort of breathing could vary considerably during a dive, even without taking diver attitude into account.

Later models included a first stage regulator to provide air to the demand valve at a lower pressure, compensated for depth, which allowed finer control and greater sensitivity to small pressure differences over the second stage diaphragm, but less sensitivity to cylinder pressure variation during the dive, both desirable features. Both the first and second stage valve mechanisms of the regulator are packaged in the circular brass housing mounted on the cylinder valve behind the diver&#x27;s neck. High pressure gas flows into the regulator from the cylinder valve outlet, and is blocked by the first stage valve. The first stage reduces cylinder pressure to an interstage pressure, a fairly constant few bars higher than the ambient pressure, set by an adjustable spring preloading the diaphragm, The interstage breathing gas is then reduced to ambient pressure by the second stage.

The first stage diaphragm is a spring-loaded flexible cover to the interstage pressure chamber. When the diver consumes gas from the second stage, the pressure falls in the interstage chamber and the diaphragm deforms inwards pushing against the valve lifter. This opens the high pressure valve permitting gas to flow past the valve seat into the interstage chamber. When the diver stops inhaling, pressure in the low pressure chambers quickly rises until the diaphragm returns to its neutral position and no longer presses on the valve lifter, shutting off the flow until the next breath is taken. 

The second, or demand valve stage, keeps the gas in the interstage chamber until it is opened by a reduction in pressure in the low-pressure chamber. It reduces the pressure of the interstage air supply to very nearly ambient pressure when the diver inhales the air in the low pressure chamber and the larger, more sensitive, low pressure diaphragm deflects inwards to push against the lever operating the second stage valve. When the diver stops inhaling, the flow continues only until the pressure in the low pressure chamber balances the ambient water pressure on the outside of the low pressure diaphragm.

To prevent free-flow or excessive exhaust back-pressure, the exhaust valve must be at the same depth as the diaphragm, and the only reliable place to do this is in the same housing. The air flows through a pair of large bore corrugated rubber hoses to and from the mouthpiece. The supply hose is connected to one side of the regulator body and supplies air to the mouthpiece through a non-return valve, and the exhaled air is returned to the regulator housing on the outside of the diaphragm, also through a non-return valve on the other side of the mouthpiece and through another non-return exhaust valve in the regulator housing. The non-return valves fitted to each of the breathing hoses where they connect to the mouthpiece prevent any water that gets into the mouthpiece from going into the inhalation hose, and ensures that once it is blown into the exhalation hose that it cannot flow back. This slightly increases the flow resistance of air and the work of breathing, but makes the regulator easier to clear, particularly when the diver does not have enough air in their lungs to blast clear with a sharp exhalation. By rolling in the right direction in a horizontal position, the trapped water will flow by gravity into the exhaust hose, and when the mouthpiece is shallower than the diaphragm, the regulator will tend to free-flow when out of the mouth, which can also be used to purge the inhalation hose.

Ideally the delivered pressure is equal to the resting pressure in the diver&#x27;s lungs as this is what human lungs are adapted to breathe. With a twin hose regulator behind the diver at shoulder level, the delivered pressure changes with diver orientation. if the diver rolls on his or her back the released air pressure is higher than in the lungs. Divers learned to restrict flow by using their tongue to close the mouthpiece. When the cylinder pressure was running low and air demand effort rising, a roll to the right side made breathing easier. Raising the mouthpiece above the regulator increases the delivered pressure of gas at the mouth and increases exhaust resistance, and lowering the mouthpiece reduces delivered pressure and increases inhalation resistance.

== Invention and patent ==
An earlier underwater breathing regulator, known as the &quot;régulateur&quot;, was invented in France in 1860 by Benoît Rouquayrol. He first conceived it as a device to help assist in escaping from flooded mines. The Rouquayrol regulator was adapted to diving in 1864, when Rouquayrol met the &quot;lieutenant de vaisseau&quot; Auguste Denayrouze. The Rouquayrol-Denayrouze apparatus went into mass production and commercialization on 28 August 1865, when the French Navy Minister ordered the first units.

After 1884, several companies and entrepreneurs bought or inherited the patent and produced it until 1965. In 1942, during the German occupation of France, the patent was held by the Bernard Piel Company (&quot;Établissements Bernard Piel&quot;). One of their apparatuses went to Émile Gagnan, an engineer employed by the Air Liquide company. Gagnan miniaturized and adapted it to gas generators in response to a fuel shortage, which was a consequence of German requisitioning. Gagnan&#x27;s boss, Henri Melchior, knew that his son-in-law Jacques-Yves Cousteau was looking for an automatic demand regulator to increase the useful endurance of the underwater breathing apparatus invented by Commander Yves le Prieur, so he introduced Cousteau to Gagnan in December 1942. On Cousteau&#x27;s initiative, the Gagnan regulator was modified for use in diving. Cousteau and Gagnan were issued a patent some weeks later in 1943. After the war, in 1946, both men founded La Spirotechnique as a division of Air Liquide in order to mass-produce and sell their invention, this time under a new 1945 patent, and known as CG45 (&quot;C&quot; for Cousteau, &quot;G&quot; for Gagnan and &quot;45&quot; for 1945). This same CG45 regulator, produced for more than ten years and commercialized in France as of 1946, was the first to actually be called the &quot;Aqua-Lung&quot;. In France, the terms &quot;scaphandre autonome&quot; (&quot;autonomous diving set&quot;), &quot;scaphandre Cousteau-Gagnan&quot; (&quot;Cousteau-Gagnan diving set&quot;), or CG45 were meaningful enough for commercialization, but to sell his invention in English-speaking countries, Cousteau needed an appealing name following English language standards. He then coined the trade name &quot;Aqua-Lung&quot;.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, La Spirotechnique started exporting the Aqua-Lung and leasing its patent to foreign companies like the British Siebe Gorman. The equipment was a great success compared to the Rouquayrol-Denayrouze apparatus, which was limited because the technology of its time could only produce compressed-air tanks that could hold 30 atmospheres, which allowed dives of only 30 minutes at no more than ten meters depth. Before 1945, French divers preferred the traditional standard diving dress with copper helmet and surface supplied breathing air. When the Aqua-Lung became available for commercial use, divers around the world found the Cousteau-Gagnan equipment smaller and easier to use than either the Le Prieur or Rouquayrol-Denayrouze apparatus. The Aqua-Lung also could be mounted on stronger and more reliable air tanks holding up to 200 atmospheres, allowing extension of diving duration to more than an hour at significant depths, including the time needed for decompression stops.

The first Cousteau-Gagnan Aqua-Lungs (like the CG45 of 1945 or the Mistral of 1955) were twin-hose open-circuit scuba. Similar configurations have since been made by various manufacturers with varying design details and numbers of cylinders. Like open-circuit scuba with single-hose regulators, they consisted of one or more high pressure diving cylinders and a diving regulator (the &quot;Aqua-Lung&quot;) that supplied the diver with breathing gas at ambient pressure via a demand valve. For more than ten years, seen in the films &quot;Épaves&quot; (&quot;Shipwrecks&quot;, 1943) and &quot;Le Monde du silence&quot; (&quot;The Silent World&quot;, 1956) the main scuba equipment used by Cousteau and his divers was an Aqua-Lung mounted on three diving cylinders, one being used as a reserve. The Aqua-Lung allowed divers to spend more time underwater, and, along with the invention of several underwater cameras, to film and explore more freely.

== Competition ==
The Aqua-Lung was not the first self contained underwater breathing apparatus, but it was the first to be widely popular. In 1934, René Commeinhes developed a firefighter&#x27;s breathing apparatus which was adapted for diving as the G.C. - 42, and patented in April, 1942 (no.976,590) by his son Georges in 1937. It was used by the French Navy during the first few years of World War II. It was an open circuit system supplied from two 200 bar cylinders, and used a single stage regulator to supply gas to a bag between the two back-mounted cylinders at slightly above ambient pressure. The gas was then supplied to the left side of a full-face mask by a corrugated rubber hose, and exhausted directly from the right side of the mask.

It is not clear who invented the first single hose regulator. The invention was motivated by an effort to bypass Aqua-Lung&#x27;s patent on the twin-hose regulator, which involved the return of exhaust gas to the regulator to reduce the differential pressure and therefore reduce the amount and variation of over- or under-pressure of the breathing gas in the lungs. The single hose regulator accomplishes this by relocating the second stage pressure sensing diaphragm to the point of exhaust at the mouthpiece, rather than routing the exhaust back to the regulator diaphragm at the cylinder.

An advertisement in &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; of October 1950 offered a single hose regulator for sale by Divers Supply in Wilmington, California. At about the same time as Divers Supply began selling the Sport Diver regulator, Australian Ted Eldred designed a two stage single hose regulator which he marketed in Australia as the Porpoise. Virtually all modern open-circuit scuba regulators use the single-hose two-stage design, though Aqualung did market a modernised twin-hose Mistral model in 2005 and 2006.

==Trademark issues==
&quot;Aqualung&quot;, &quot;Aqua-Lung&quot;, and &quot;Aqua Lung&quot; are registered trademarks for scuba diving breathing equipment. That trade name was originally owned in the United States by a company known as U.S. Divers (that later became Aqualung America). The term was in use before the trademark was registered by René Bussoz, who owned a sporting goods store called René Sports in Los Angeles. He obtained a contract with Air Liquide, the parent company of La Spirotechnique, to import the new scuba equipment into the United States for sale on the Pacific coast (SPACO Inc. had the contract for the Atlantic coast). Bussoz changed the name of his company to U.S. Divers and registered the name Aqua-Lung. This turned out to be a wise move, because when the French company decided not to renew his five-year contract, no one had even heard of their product, but everyone was familiar with the names he had registered. Bussoz sold the company and the trade names for a handsome profit, returning to France. The name &quot;U.S. Divers&quot; sounded very official and very American, but it was owned by a Frenchman and sold to a French company.

Air Liquide held the patent on the original &quot;Aqualung&quot; (also written as &quot;Aqua-Lung&quot; or &quot;Aqua Lung&quot;) until the patent expired sometime around 1960 to 1963. The term &quot;Aqualung&quot;, as far as is known, first appeared in print on page 3 of Jacques-Yves Cousteau&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Silent World&quot;, in 1953. Public use of the word &quot;aqualung&quot;, and public interest in Aqualungs and scuba diving, were started around 1953 in English-speaking counties by a National Geographical Society Magazine article about Cousteau&#x27;s underwater archaeological expedition to . In France, aqualung diving was popularized by Cousteau&#x27;s movie &quot;Épaves&quot;, while his book &quot;The Silent World&quot; also helped significantly.

As with some other registered trademarks, the term &quot;aqualung&quot; became a genericized trademark in English-speaking countries as a result of common use by the public and in publications, including the BSAC&#x27;s official diving manuals. Presumably, lawyers for Cousteau or Air Liquide could have slowed or stopped this genericization by taking prompt action, but this seems not to have been done in Britain, where Siebe Gorman held the British rights to both the trade name and the patent.

In the United States, the term &quot;aqualung&quot; was popularized by the popular television series &quot;Sea Hunt&quot; (1958), in which actual Aqua-Lungs appeared in early episodes. This series never said that a scuba regulator could be called anything else, or made by anyone else, but the Voit Rubber Corporation provided most of the diving equipment used in the series, and supplied Mike Nelson, the lead character. The word &quot;aqualung&quot; was commonly used in speech and in publications as a term for an open-circuit, demand valve-controlled breathing apparatus (even after Air Liquide&#x27;s patent expired and other manufacturers started making identical equipment), occasionally also for rebreathers, and in figurative uses (such as &quot;the water spider&#x27;s aqualung of air bubbles&quot;). The word entered the Russian language as the generic noun акваланг (&quot;akvalang&quot;). That word was taken into Lithuanian as the generic noun &quot;akvalangas&quot;; &quot;langas&quot; happens to be Lithuanian for &quot;window&quot;, giving a literal meaning &quot;aqua-window&quot;.

In the United States, U.S. Divers managed to keep &quot;Aqualung&quot; as a trademark. The acronym &quot;SCUBA&quot;, or &quot;Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus&quot;, originated in the United States Navy, where it referred to a frogman&#x27;s oxygen rebreather designed by Christian J. Lambertsen. SCUBA became the generic term for any type of self-contained breathing set for diving, and soon the acronym SCUBA became a common noun – &quot;scuba&quot; – all in lower-case. &quot;Scuba&quot; was a trademark for a time – used by Healthways, now known as Scubapro – one of the competitors of U.S. Divers. 

In Britain, Siebe Gorman (who held the rights to the tradename &quot;Aqualung&quot;) made no serious attempt to control use of the word, and &quot;aqualung&quot; remained a common public generic word for that sort of apparatus – including in the British Sub-Aqua Club&#x27;s official publications – for many years.

Aqua Lung America, the current name of the U.S. Divers Company, now makes rebreathers whose tradenames or catalog descriptions include the word &quot;Aqualung&quot;. The name U.S. Divers is now used as a trademark by Aqua Lung America for its line of snorkeling equipment.

<text>IBrowse is a MUI-based web browser for the Amiga range of computers and was a rewritten follow-on to Amiga Mosaic, one of the first web browsers for the Amiga Computer. IBrowse was originally developed for the now-defunct company Omnipresence. The original author has since continued development of IBrowse.

IBrowse supports some HTML 4, JavaScript, frames, SSL, and various other standards. It was one of the first browsers to include tabbed browsing as early as 1999 with IBrowse². However, it does not support CSS.

A limited OEM version of IBrowse 2.4 is included with AmigaOS 4.

Between April 2007 and August 2019, IBrowse was not available for sale to new customers since its distributor had quit the Amiga market, although existing v2.x users could download and install the demo version over their existing installation in order to access all functionality. Starting with IBrowse 2.5, new purchases can be made directly from the developer&#x27;s website.

<text>Voyager is a discontinued web browser for the Amiga range of computers, developed by VaporWare.

Voyager supports HTML 3.2 and some HTML 4, JavaScript, frames, SSL, Flash, and various other Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator features.

Voyager is also available for the MorphOS and CaOS operating systems.

==Voyager 3==
In May 1999 Oliver Wagner of VaporWare gave details of the upcoming Voyager 3 to Amiga Format, with planned new features including support for JavaScript, DOM (based on Internet Explorer&#x27;s model), and CSS.

Voyager 3 was generally well-received, with Amiga Format praising its fast JavaScript execution and rapid table layout, but criticising its &#x27;virtually unusable&#x27; print function and out-of-date documentation.

<text>Ousterhout&#x27;s dichotomy is computer scientist John Ousterhout&#x27;s categorization that high-level programming languages tend to fall into two groups, each with distinct properties and uses: &quot;system programming languages&quot; and &quot;scripting languages&quot; – compare programming in the large and programming in the small.

System programming languages (or &quot;applications languages&quot;) usually have the following properties:
* They are typed statically
* They support creating complex data structures
* Programs in them are compiled into machine code
* Programs in them are meant to operate largely independently of other programs
System programming languages tend to be used for components and applications with large amounts of internal functionality such as operating systems, database servers, and Web browsers. These applications typically employ complex algorithms and data structures and require high performance. Prototypical examples of system programming languages include C, OCaml and Modula-2.

By contrast, scripting languages (or &quot;glue languages&quot;) tend to have the following properties:
* They are typed dynamically
* They have little or no provision for complex data structures
* Programs in them (&quot;scripts&quot;) are interpreted
Scripting languages tend to be used for applications where most of the functionality comes from other programs (often implemented in system programming languages); the scripts are used to &quot;glue&quot; together other programs or add additional layers of functionality on top of existing programs. Ousterhout claims that scripts tend to be short and are often written by less sophisticated programmers. Hence, execution efficiency is less important than simplicity and ease of interaction with other programs. Common applications for scripting include Web page generation, report generation, graphical user interfaces, and system administration. Prototypical examples of scripting languages include Python, AppleScript, C shell, DOS batch files, and Tcl.

Ousterhout&#x27;s dichotomy underlies the design of his language Tcl.

==History==
The dichotomy was fully set out in , though Ousterhout had drawn this distinction since at least the design of Tcl (1988), and had stated it publicly at various times. An early episode was &quot;The Tcl War&quot; of late September and October 1994, where Richard Stallman posted an article critical of Tcl, entitled &quot;Why you should not use Tcl&quot;, to which Ousterhout replied with an articulation of his dichotomy:
==Criticism==
Critics believe that the dichotomy is highly arbitrary, and refer to it as &quot;Ousterhout&#x27;s fallacy&quot; or &quot;Ousterhout&#x27;s false dichotomy&quot;. While static-versus-dynamic typing, data structure complexity, and dependent versus stand-alone might be said to be unrelated features, the usual critique of Ousterhout&#x27;s dichotomy is of its distinction of compiling versus interpreting. Neither semantics nor syntax depend significantly on whether a language implementation compiles into machine language, interprets, tokenizes, or byte-compiles at the start of each run, or any mix of these. In addition, basically no languages in widespread use are purely interpreted without a compiler; this makes compiling versus interpreting a dubious parameter in a taxonomy of programming languages.

<text>Lexical tokenization is conversion of a text into (semantically or syntactically) meaningful &quot;lexical tokens&quot; belonging to categories defined by a &quot;lexer&quot; program. In case of a natural language, those categories include nouns, verbs, adjectives, punctuations etc. In case of a programming language, the categories include identifiers, operators, grouping symbols and data types. Lexical tokenization is related to the type of tokenization used in large language models (LLMs) but with two differences. First, lexical tokenization is usually based on a lexical grammar, whereas LLM tokenizers are usually probability-based. Second, LLM tokenizers perform a second step that converts the tokens into numerical values.

== Rule-based programs ==
A rule-based program, performing lexical tokenization, is called &quot;tokenizer&quot;, or &quot;scanner&quot;, although &quot;scanner&quot; is also a term for the first stage of a lexer. A lexer forms the first phase of a compiler frontend in processing. Analysis generally occurs in one pass. Lexers and parsers are most often used for compilers, but can be used for other computer language tools, such as prettyprinters or linters. Lexing can be divided into two stages: the &quot;scanning&quot;, which segments the input string into syntactic units called &quot;lexemes&quot; and categorizes these into token classes, and the &quot;evaluating&quot;, which converts lexemes into processed values.

Lexers are generally quite simple, with most of the complexity deferred to the syntactic analysis or semantic analysis phases, and can often be generated by a lexer generator, notably lex or derivatives. However, lexers can sometimes include some complexity, such as phrase structure processing to make input easier and simplify the parser, and may be written partly or fully by hand, either to support more features or for performance.

== Disambiguation of &quot;lexeme&quot; ==

What is called &quot;lexeme&quot; in rule-based natural language processing is not equal to what is called lexeme in linguistics. What is called &quot;lexeme&quot; in rule-based natural language processing can be equal to the linguistic equivalent only in analytic languages, such as English, but not in highly synthetic languages, such as fusional languages. What is called a lexeme in rule-based natural language processing is more similar to what is called a word in linguistics (not to be confused with a word in computer architecture), although in some cases it may be more similar to a morpheme.

== Lexical token and lexical tokenization==

A &quot;lexical token&quot; is a string with an assigned and thus identified meaning, in contrast to the probabilistic token used in large language models. A lexical token consists of a &quot;token name&quot; and an optional &quot;token value&quot;. The token name is a category of a rule-based lexical unit.

Consider this expression in the C programming language:

The lexical analysis of this expression yields the following sequence of tokens:
: codice_1

A token name is what might be termed a part of speech in linguistics.

&quot;Lexical tokenization&quot; is the conversion of a raw text into (semantically or syntactically) meaningful lexical tokens, belonging to categories defined by a &quot;lexer&quot; program, such as identifiers, operators, grouping symbols, and data types. The resulting tokens are then passed on to some other form of processing. The process can be considered a sub-task of parsing input.

For example, in the text string:
: codice_2

the string is not implicitly segmented on spaces, as a natural language speaker would do. The raw input, the 43 characters, must be explicitly split into the 9 tokens with a given space delimiter (i.e., matching the string codice_3 or regular expression codice_4).

When a token class represents more than one possible lexeme, the lexer often saves enough information to reproduce the original lexeme, so that it can be used in semantic analysis. The parser typically retrieves this information from the lexer and stores it in the abstract syntax tree. This is necessary in order to avoid information loss in the case where numbers may also be valid identifiers.

Tokens are identified based on the specific rules of the lexer. Some methods used to identify tokens include regular expressions, specific sequences of characters termed a flag, specific separating characters called delimiters, and explicit definition by a dictionary. Special characters, including punctuation characters, are commonly used by lexers to identify tokens because of their natural use in written and programming languages. A lexical analyzer generally does nothing with combinations of tokens, a task left for a parser. For example, a typical lexical analyzer recognizes parentheses as tokens but does nothing to ensure that each &quot;(&quot; is matched with a &quot;)&quot;. 

When a lexer feeds tokens to the parser, the representation used is typically an enumerated type, which is a list of number representations. For example, &quot;Identifier&quot; can be represented with 0, &quot;Assignment operator&quot; with 1, &quot;Addition operator&quot; with 2, etc.

Tokens are often defined by regular expressions, which are understood by a lexical analyzer generator such as lex, or handcoded equivalent finite-state automata. The lexical analyzer (generated automatically by a tool like lex or hand-crafted) reads in a stream of characters, identifies the lexemes in the stream, and categorizes them into tokens. This is termed &quot;tokenizing&quot;. If the lexer finds an invalid token, it will report an error.

Following tokenizing is parsing. From there, the interpreted data may be loaded into data structures for general use, interpretation, or compiling.

== Lexical grammar ==
The specification of a programming language often includes a set of rules, the lexical grammar, which defines the lexical syntax. The lexical syntax is usually a regular language, with the grammar rules consisting of regular expressions; they define the set of possible character sequences (lexemes) of a token. A lexer recognizes strings, and for each kind of string found, the lexical program takes an action, most simply producing a token.

Two important common lexical categories are white space and comments. These are also defined in the grammar and processed by the lexer but may be discarded (not producing any tokens) and considered &quot;non-significant&quot;, at most separating two tokens (as in codice_5 instead of codice_6). There are two important exceptions to this. First, in off-side rule languages that delimit blocks with indenting, initial whitespace is significant, as it determines block structure, and is generally handled at the lexer level; see phrase structure, below. Secondly, in some uses of lexers, comments and whitespace must be preserved – for examples, a prettyprinter also needs to output the comments and some debugging tools may provide messages to the programmer showing the original source code. In the 1960s, notably for ALGOL, whitespace and comments were eliminated as part of the line reconstruction phase (the initial phase of the compiler frontend), but this separate phase has been eliminated and these are now handled by the lexer.

== Details ==
=== Scanner ===
The first stage, the &quot;scanner&quot;, is usually based on a finite-state machine (FSM). It has encoded within it information on the possible sequences of characters that can be contained within any of the tokens it handles (individual instances of these character sequences are termed lexemes). For example, an &quot;integer&quot; lexeme may contain any sequence of numerical digit characters. In many cases, the first non-whitespace character can be used to deduce the kind of token that follows and subsequent input characters are then processed one at a time until reaching a character that is not in the set of characters acceptable for that token (this is termed the &quot;maximal munch&quot;, or &quot;longest match&quot;, rule). In some languages, the lexeme creation rules are more complex and may involve backtracking over previously read characters. For example, in C, one &#x27;L&#x27; character is not enough to distinguish between an identifier that begins with &#x27;L&#x27; and a wide-character string literal.

=== Evaluator ===
A lexeme, however, is only a string of characters known to be of a certain kind (e.g., a string literal, a sequence of letters). In order to construct a token, the lexical analyzer needs a second stage, the &quot;evaluator&quot;, which goes over the characters of the lexeme to produce a &quot;value&quot;. The lexeme&#x27;s type combined with its value is what properly constitutes a token, which can be given to a parser. Some tokens such as parentheses do not really have values, and so the evaluator function for these can return nothing: Only the type is needed. Similarly, sometimes evaluators can suppress a lexeme entirely, concealing it from the parser, which is useful for whitespace and comments. The evaluators for identifiers are usually simple (literally representing the identifier), but may include some unstropping. The evaluators for integer literals may pass the string on (deferring evaluation to the semantic analysis phase), or may perform evaluation themselves, which can be involved for different bases or floating point numbers. For a simple quoted string literal, the evaluator needs to remove only the quotes, but the evaluator for an escaped string literal incorporates a lexer, which unescapes the escape sequences.

For example, in the source code of a computer program, the string
might be converted into the following lexical token stream; whitespace is suppressed and special characters have no value:
 IDENTIFIER net_worth_future
 EQUALS
 OPEN_PARENTHESIS
 IDENTIFIER assets
 MINUS
 IDENTIFIER liabilities
 CLOSE_PARENTHESIS
 SEMICOLON

Lexers may be written by hand. This is practical if the list of tokens is small, but lexers generated by automated tooling as part of a compiler-compiler toolchain are more practical for a larger number of potential tokens. These tools generally accept regular expressions that describe the tokens allowed in the input stream. Each regular expression is associated with a production rule in the lexical grammar of the programming language that evaluates the lexemes matching the regular expression. These tools may generate source code that can be compiled and executed or construct a state transition table for a finite-state machine (which is plugged into template code for compiling and executing).

Regular expressions compactly represent patterns that the characters in lexemes might follow. For example, for an English-based language, an IDENTIFIER token might be any English alphabetic character or an underscore, followed by any number of instances of ASCII alphanumeric characters and/or underscores. This could be represented compactly by the string . This means &quot;any character a-z, A-Z or _, followed by 0 or more of a-z, A-Z, _ or 0-9&quot;.

Regular expressions and the finite-state machines they generate are not powerful enough to handle recursive patterns, such as &quot;&quot;n&quot; opening parentheses, followed by a statement, followed by &quot;n&quot; closing parentheses.&quot; They are unable to keep count, and verify that &quot;n&quot; is the same on both sides, unless a finite set of permissible values exists for &quot;n&quot;. It takes a full parser to recognize such patterns in their full generality. A parser can push parentheses on a stack and then try to pop them off and see if the stack is empty at the end (see example in the &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot; book).

== Obstacles ==
Typically, lexical tokenization occurs at the word level. However, it is sometimes difficult to define what is meant by a &quot;word&quot;. Often, a tokenizer relies on simple heuristics, for example:
* Punctuation and whitespace may or may not be included in the resulting list of tokens.
* All contiguous strings of alphabetic characters are part of one token; likewise with numbers.
* Tokens are separated by whitespace characters, such as a space or line break, or by punctuation characters.

In languages that use inter-word spaces (such as most that use the Latin alphabet, and most programming languages), this approach is fairly straightforward. However, even here there are many edge cases such as contractions, hyphenated words, emoticons, and larger constructs such as URIs (which for some purposes may count as single tokens). A classic example is &quot;New York-based&quot;, which a naive tokenizer may break at the space even though the better break is (arguably) at the hyphen.

Tokenization is particularly difficult for languages written in scriptio continua, which exhibit no word boundaries, such as Ancient Greek, Chinese, or Thai. Agglutinative languages, such as Korean, also make tokenization tasks complicated.

Some ways to address the more difficult problems include developing more complex heuristics, querying a table of common special cases, or fitting the tokens to a language model that identifies collocations in a later processing step.

== Lexer generator ==

Lexers are often generated by a &quot;lexer generator&quot;, analogous to parser generators, and such tools often come together. The most established is lex, paired with the yacc parser generator, or rather some of their many reimplementations, like flex (often paired with GNU Bison). These generators are a form of domain-specific language, taking in a lexical specification – generally regular expressions with some markup – and emitting a lexer.

These tools yield very fast development, which is very important in early development, both to get a working lexer and because a language specification may change often. Further, they often provide advanced features, such as pre- and post-conditions which are hard to program by hand. However, an automatically generated lexer may lack flexibility, and thus may require some manual modification, or an all-manually written lexer.

Lexer performance is a concern, and optimizing is worthwhile, more so in stable languages where the lexer runs very often (such as C or HTML). lex/flex-generated lexers are reasonably fast, but improvements of two to three times are possible using more tuned generators. Hand-written lexers are sometimes used, but modern lexer generators produce faster lexers than most hand-coded ones. The lex/flex family of generators uses a table-driven approach which is much less efficient than the directly coded approach. With the latter approach the generator produces an engine that directly jumps to follow-up states via goto statements. Tools like re2c have proven to produce engines that are between two and three times faster than flex produced engines. It is in general difficult to hand-write analyzers that perform better than engines generated by these latter tools.

== Phrase structure ==
Lexical analysis mainly segments the input stream of characters into tokens, simply grouping the characters into pieces and categorizing them. However, the lexing may be significantly more complex; most simply, lexers may omit tokens or insert added tokens. Omitting tokens, notably whitespace and comments, is very common when these are not needed by the compiler. Less commonly, added tokens may be inserted. This is done mainly to group tokens into statements, or statements into blocks, to simplify the parser.

=== Line continuation ===
Line continuation is a feature of some languages where a newline is normally a statement terminator. Most often, ending a line with a backslash (immediately followed by a newline) results in the line being &quot;continued&quot; – the following line is &quot;joined&quot; to the prior line. This is generally done in the lexer: The backslash and newline are discarded, rather than the newline being tokenized. Examples include bash, other shell scripts and Python.

=== Semicolon insertion ===
Many languages use the semicolon as a statement terminator. Most often this is mandatory, but in some languages the semicolon is optional in many contexts. This is mainly done at the lexer level, where the lexer outputs a semicolon into the token stream, despite one not being present in the input character stream, and is termed &quot;semicolon insertion&quot; or &quot;automatic semicolon insertion&quot;. In these cases, semicolons are part of the formal phrase grammar of the language, but may not be found in input text, as they can be inserted by the lexer. Optional semicolons or other terminators or separators are also sometimes handled at the parser level, notably in the case of trailing commas or semicolons.

Semicolon insertion is a feature of BCPL and its distant descendant Go, though it is absent in B or C. Semicolon insertion is present in JavaScript, though the rules are somewhat complex and much-criticized; to avoid bugs, some recommend always using semicolons, while others use initial semicolons, termed defensive semicolons, at the start of potentially ambiguous statements.

Semicolon insertion (in languages with semicolon-terminated statements) and line continuation (in languages with newline-terminated statements) can be seen as complementary: Semicolon insertion adds a token even though newlines generally do &quot;not&quot; generate tokens, while line continuation prevents a token from being generated even though newlines generally &quot;do&quot; generate tokens.

=== Off-side rule ===

The off-side rule (blocks determined by indenting) can be implemented in the lexer, as in Python, where increasing the indenting results in the lexer emitting an INDENT token and decreasing the indenting results in the lexer emitting one or more DEDENT tokens. These tokens correspond to the opening brace codice_7 and closing brace codice_8 in languages that use braces for blocks and means that the phrase grammar does not depend on whether braces or indenting are used. This requires that the lexer hold state, namely a stack of indent levels, and thus can detect changes in indenting when this changes, and thus the lexical grammar is not context-free: INDENT–DEDENT depend on the contextual information of prior indent levels.

== Context-sensitive lexing ==
Generally lexical grammars are context-free, or almost so, and thus require no looking back or ahead, or backtracking, which allows a simple, clean, and efficient implementation. This also allows simple one-way communication from lexer to parser, without needing any information flowing back to the lexer.

There are exceptions, however. Simple examples include semicolon insertion in Go, which requires looking back one token; concatenation of consecutive string literals in Python, which requires holding one token in a buffer before emitting it (to see if the next token is another string literal); and the off-side rule in Python, which requires maintaining a count of indent level (indeed, a stack of each indent level). These examples all only require lexical context, and while they complicate a lexer somewhat, they are invisible to the parser and later phases.

A more complex example is the lexer hack in C, where the token class of a sequence of characters cannot be determined until the semantic analysis phase since typedef names and variable names are lexically identical but constitute different token classes. Thus in the hack, the lexer calls the semantic analyzer (say, symbol table) and checks if the sequence requires a typedef name. In this case, information must flow back not from the parser only, but from the semantic analyzer back to the lexer, which complicates design.

<doc id="81254" wikidata="Q207323" url="?curid=81254" title="Vulcano">
<text>Vulcano () or Vulcan is a small volcanic island belonging to Italy in the Tyrrhenian Sea, about north of Sicily and located at the southernmost end of the seven Aeolian Islands. The island is known for its volcanic activity and contains several volcanic calderas, including one of the four active volcanoes in Italy that are not submarine. The English word &quot;volcano&quot;, and its equivalent in several European languages, derives from the name of this island, which derives from the Roman belief that the tiny island was the chimney of Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. In November 2021, 150 people were evacuated from the island&#x27;s harbour area due to increased volcanic activity and gases; an amber alert had been issued in October 2021 after several significant changes in the volcano&#x27;s parameters.

==Geography==
Vulcano is located approximately north of Sicily and is approximately long by wide. The island is in area and rises to above sea level. The island is separated by a -wide strait from Lipari to the north and is administratively part of the Commune of Lipari.

As of 2019, Vulcano had a population of 450 residents, a decrease from a population of 953 in 2011. The majority of the population resides in Vulcano Porto on the north side of the island, with secondary population centres at Vulcano Piano and Vulcanello.

==Geology==
Volcanic activity in the region is largely the result of tectonic activity, the northward-moving African Plate meeting the Eurasian Plate.

There are three volcanic centres on the island:
* At the southern end of the island are old stratovolcano cones, Monte Aria (), Monte Saraceno (), and Monte Luccia (), which have partially collapsed into the Il Piano Caldera.
* The most recently active centre is the Gran Cratere at the top of the Fossa cone, the cone having grown in the Lentia Caldera in the middle of the island, and has had at least nine major eruptions in the last 6,000 years.
* At the north of the island is the islet, Vulcanello (), connected to Vulcano by an isthmus that may be flooded in bad weather. It emerged from the sea during an eruption in 183 BCE, as a separate islet. Occasional eruptions from its three cones with both pyroclastic flow deposits and lavas occurred from then until 1550, with the last eruption creating a narrow isthmus connecting it to Vulcano.
Vulcano has been quiet since the eruption of the Fossa cone on 2 August 1888 to 22 March 1890, which deposited about of pyroclastic material on the summit. The style of eruption seen on the Fossa cone is called a Vulcanian eruption, being the explosive emission of pyroclastic fragments of viscous magmas caused by the high viscosity preventing gases from escaping easily. This eruption of Vulcano was carefully documented at the time by Giuseppe Mercalli. Mercalli described the eruptions as &quot;...explosions sounding like a cannon at irregular intervals...&quot; As a result, vulcanian eruptions are based on his description. A typical vulcanian eruption can hurl blocks of solid material several hundreds of metres from the vent. Mercalli reported that blocks from the 1888–1890 eruption fell into the sea between Vulcano and neighboring Lipari, and several that had fallen on the island of Vulcano were photographed by him or his assistants.

Volcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a multicomponent gas analyzer system, which detects degassing of rising magmas before an eruption, improving prediction of volcanic activity.

A survey on local groundwater from 1995 to 1997 found temperatures of 49–75 °C, sodium sulfate -chloride chemical composition, and near neutral pH in the water wells closest to the slopes of the volcanic cone. This is mainly due to condensation onto the slopes of the volcanic cone and water-rock interaction buffering.
==Microbiology==
Since Vulcano island has volcanic activity, it is a place where thermophiles and hyperthermophiles are found. The hyperthermophilic archaean &quot;Pyrococcus furiosus&quot; was described for the first time when it was isolated from sediments of this island.

== History ==
=== Classical period ===
The Ancient Greeks named this island &quot;Therasía&quot; (Θηρασία) and &quot;Thérmessa&quot; (Θέρμεσσα, source of heat). The island appeared in their myths as the private foundry of the Olympian god Hephaestus, the patron of blacksmiths. Their myths noted two more of his foundries, at Etna and Olympus. Strabo also mentions Thermessa as &quot;sacred place of Hephaestus&quot; (ἱερὰ Ἡφαίστου), but it is not certain whether this was a third name for the island, or merely an adjective.

Similarly, the Romans believed that Vulcano was the chimney of their god Vulcan&#x27;s workshop and, therefore, named the island after him. According to the Roman myths, the island had grown due to his periodic clearing of cinders and ashes from his forge. They also explained earthquakes that either preceded or accompanied the explosions of ash as being due to Vulcan making weapons for their god Mars for his armies to wage war.

The Romans used the island mainly for raw materials, harvesting timber, and mining alum and sulfur. These were the principal activities on the island until the end of the nineteenth century.

===Medieval===
The first ascent of the volcanic cone is documented for the 13th century. The Dominican friar Burchard of Mount Sion, in his pilgrimage report to the Holy Land, tells of his return journey via Sicily, which probably took place in 1284. On Vulcano he had climbed the summit &quot;crawling on his hands and feet&quot;. His ascent can be considered authentic, as he reports in detail on his observations of the landscape and nature, for example describing the fumaroles or the diameter of the crater.

The island of Vulcano as well as the Aeolian Islands are already known to Isidor of Seville, the Gallic bishop Arculf, who dictated his journey to the Holy Land to the Irishman Adomnan (before 680), or Bartholomew Anglicus. They are an integral part of medieval knowledge of the geography of the Mediterranean, but none of them wrote about Vulcano on their own initiative.

Vulcano is also mentioned in the pilgrimage report (ca. 1350) by Ludolf von Sudheim, who, however, claims that he did not dare to climb it. Unlike Burchard of Mount Sion, Ludolf expected to find the entrance to hell at the crater. The Provençal knight Antoine de La Sale tells of an excursion to the island in 1406. His text is a didactic textbook for his pupil John of Calabria, the son of Duke Rene I of Anjou.

===Modern period===
After Bourbon rule collapsed in 1860, the Scottish industrialist and philanthropist James Stevenson bought the northern part of the island. He then built a villa, reopened the local mines, and planted vineyards for making Malmsey wine. Stevenson lived on Vulcano until the last major eruption on the island, in 1888. This eruption lasted the better part of two years, by which time Stevenson had sold all of his property to the local populace. He never returned to the island. His villa is still intact.
==Significance in pop culture==

An asteroid is named after this island, 4464 Vulcano.

The American attorney and writer, Richard Paul Roe, asserts that the play &quot;The Tempest&quot; by William Shakespeare is set on the island of Vulcano, rather than the more authoritative interpretation that the setting was based on reports about Bermuda in the Americas because of the hurricane.

In &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;: &quot;Battle Tendency&quot;, Joseph Joestar accidentally imbues Ripple energy into Vulcano, causing the volcano to erupt and launch his foe Kars into outer space.

In the Star Trek: Voyager episode &quot;Concerning Flight&quot;, the island is mentioned by a holographic Leonardo Da Vinci.

<doc id="81256" wikidata="Q505748" url="?curid=81256" title="Volcanism">
<text>Volcanism, vulcanism, volcanicity, or volcanic activity is the phenomenon where solids, liquids, gases, and their mixtures erupt to the surface of a solid-surface astronomical body such as a planet or a moon. It is caused by the presence of a heat source, usually internally generated, inside the body; the heat is generated by various processes, such as radioactive decay or tidal heating. This heat partially melts solid material in the body or turns material into gas. The mobilized material rises through the body&#x27;s interior and may break through the solid surface.

==Causes==

For volcanism to occur, the temperature of the mantle must have risen to about half its melting point. At this point, the mantle&#x27;s viscosity will have dropped to about 1021 Pascal-seconds. When large scale melting occurs, the viscosity rapidly falls to 103 Pascal-seconds or even less, increasing the heat transport rate a million-fold.

The occurrence of volcanism is partially due to the fact that melted material tends to be more mobile and less dense than the materials from which they were produced, which can cause it to rise to the surface.

===Heat source===
There are multiple ways to generate the heat needed for volcanism. Volcanism on outer solar system moons is powered mainly by tidal heating. Tidal heating caused by the deformation of a body&#x27;s shape due to mutual gravitational attraction, which generates heat. Earth experiences tidal heating from the Moon, deforming by up to 1 metre (3 feet), but this does not make up a major portion of Earth&#x27;s total heat.

During a planet&#x27;s formation, it would have experienced heating from impacts from planetesimals, which would have dwarfed even the asteroid impact that caused the extinction of dinosaurs. This heating could trigger differentiation, further heating the planet. The larger a body is, the slower it loses heat. In larger bodies, for example Earth, this heat, known as primordial heat, still makes up much of the body&#x27;s internal heat, but the Moon, which is smaller than Earth, has lost most of this heat.

Another heat source is radiogenic heat, caused by radioactive decay. The decay of aluminium-26 would have significantly heated planetary embryos, but due to its short half-life (less than a million years), any traces of it have long since vanished. There are small traces of unstable isotopes in common minerals, and all the terrestrial planets, and the Moon, experience some of this heating. The icy bodies of the outer solar system experience much less of this heat because they tend to not be very dense and not have much silicate material (radioactive elements concentrate in silicates).

On Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton, and possibly on Mars, &quot;cryogeyser&quot; activity takes place. The source of heat is external (heat from the Sun) rather than internal.

===Melting methods===
====Decompression melting====
Decompression melting happens when solid material from deep beneath the body rises upwards. Pressure decreases as the material rises upwards, and so does the melting point. So, a rock that is solid at a given pressure and temperature can become liquid if the pressure, and thus melting point, decreases even if the temperature stays constant. However, in the case of water, increasing pressure decreases melting point until a pressure of 0.208 GPa is reached, after which the melting point increases with pressure.

====Flux melting====
Flux melting occurs when the melting point is lowered by the addition of volatiles, for example, water or carbon dioxide. Like decompression melting, it is not caused by an increase in temperature, but rather by a decrease in melting point.

====Formation of cryomagma reservoirs====
Cryovolcanism, instead of originating in a uniform subsurface ocean, may instead take place from discrete liquid reservoirs. The first way these can form is a plume of warm ice welling up and then sinking back down, forming a convection current. A model developed to investigate the effects of this on Europa found that energy from tidal heating became focused in these plumes, allowing melting to occur in these shallow depths as the plume spreads laterally (horizontally). The next is a switch from vertical to horizontal propagation of a fluid filled crack. Another mechanism is heating of ice from release of stress through lateral motion of fractures in the ice shell penetrating it from the surface, and even heating from large impacts can create such reservoirs.

===Ascent of melts===
====Diapirs====
When material of a planetary body begins to melt, the melting first occurs in small pockets in certain high energy locations, for example grain boundary intersections and where different crystals react to form eutectic liquid, that initially remain isolated from one another, trapped inside rock. If the contact angle of the melted material allows the melt to wet crystal faces and run along grain boundaries, the melted material will accumulate into larger quantities. On the other hand, if the angle is greater than about 60 degrees, much more melt must form before it can separate from its parental rock. Studies of rocks on Earth suggest that melt in hot rocks quickly collects into pockets and veins that are much larger than the grain size, in contrast to the model of rigid melt percolation. Melt, instead of uniformly flowing out of source rock, flows out through rivulets which join to create larger veins. Under the influence of buoyancy, the melt rises. Diapirs may also form in non-silicate bodies, playing a similar role in moving warm material towards the surface.

====Dikes====
A dike is a vertical fluid-filled crack, from a mechanical standpoint it is a water filled crevasse turned upside down. As magma rises into the vertical crack, the low density of the magma compared to the wall rock means that the pressure falls less rapidly than in the surrounding denser rock. If the average pressure of the magma and the surrounding rock are equal, the pressure in the dike exceeds that of the enclosing rock at the top of the dike, and the pressure of the rock is greater than that of the dike at its bottom. So the magma thus pushes the crack upwards at its top, but the crack is squeezed closed at its bottom due to an elastic reaction (similar to the bulge next to a person sitting down on a springy sofa). Eventually, the tail gets so narrow it nearly pinches off, and no more new magma will rise into the crack. The crack continues to ascend as an independent pod of magma.

====Standpipe model====
This model of volcanic eruption posits that magma rises through a rigid open channel, in the lithosphere and settles at the level of hydrostatic equilibrium. Despite how it explains observations well (which newer models cannot), such as an apparent concordance of the elevation of volcanoes near each other, it cannot be correct and is now discredited, because the lithosphere thickness derived from it is too large for the assumption of a rigid open channel to hold.

====Cryovolcanic melt ascent====
Unlike silicate volcanism, where melt can rise by its own buoyancy until it reaches the shallow crust, in cryovolcanism, the water (cryomagmas tend to be water based) is denser than the ice above it. One way to allow cryomagma to reach the surface is to make the water buoyant, by making the water less dense, either through the presence of other compounds that reverse negative buoyancy, or with the addition of exsolved gas bubbles in the cryomagma that were previously dissolved into it (that makes the cryomagma less dense), or with the presence of a densifying agent in the ice shell. Another is to pressurise the fluid to overcome negative buoyancy and make it reach the surface. When the ice shell above a subsurface ocean thickens, it can pressurise the entire ocean (in cryovolcanism, frozen water or brine is less dense than in liquid form). When a reservoir of liquid partially freezes, the remaining liquid is pressurised in the same way.

For a crack in the ice shell to propagate upwards, the fluid in it must have positive buoyancy or external stresses must be strong enough to break through the ice. External stresses could include those from tides or from overpressure due to freezing as explained above.

There is yet another possible mechanism for ascent of cryovolcanic melts. If a fracture with water in it reaches an ocean or subsurface fluid reservoir, the water would rise to its level of hydrostatic equilibrium, at about nine-tenths of the way to the surface. Tides which induce compression and tension in the ice shell may pump the water farther up.

A 1988 article proposed a possibility for fractures propagating upwards from the subsurface ocean of Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa. It proposed that a fracture propagating upwards would possess a low pressure zone at its tip, allowing volatiles dissolved within the water to exsolve into gas. The elastic nature of the ice shell would likely prevent the fracture reaching the surface, and the crack would instead pinch off, enclosing the gas and liquid. The gas would increase buoyancy and could allow the crack to reach the surface.

Even impacts can create conditions that allow for enhanced ascent of magma. An impact may remove the top few kilometres of crust, and pressure differences caused by the difference in height between the basin and the height of the surrounding terrain could allow eruption of magma which otherwise would have stayed beneath the surface. A 2011 article showed that there would be zones of enhanced magma ascent at the margins of an impact basin.

Not all of these mechanisms, and maybe even none, operate on a given body.

==Types==
=== Silicate volcanism ===

Silicate volcanism occurs where silicate materials are erupted. Silicate lava flows, like those found on Earth, solidify at about 1000 degrees Celsius.

=== Mud volcanoes ===
 A mud volcano is formed when fluids and gases under pressure erupt to the surface, bringing mud with them. This pressure can be caused by the weight of overlying sediments over the fluid which pushes down on the fluid, preventing it from escaping, by fluid being trapped in the sediment, migrating from deeper sediment into other sediment or being made from chemical reactions in the sediment. They often erupt quietly, but sometimes they erupt flammable gases like methane.

=== Cryovolcanism ===
Cryovolcanism is the eruption of volatiles into an environment below their freezing point. The processes behind it are different to silicate volcanism because the cryomagma (which is usually water-based) is normally denser than its surroundings, meaning it cannot rise by its own buoyancy.

=== Sulfur ===
Sulfur lavas have a different behaviour to silicate ones. First, sulfur has a low melting point of about 120 degrees Celsius. Also, after cooling down to about 175 degrees Celsius the lava rapidly loses viscosity, unlike silicate lavas like those found on Earth.

==Lava types==

When magma erupts onto a planet&#x27;s surface, it is termed &quot;lava&quot;. Viscous lavas form short, stubby glass-rich flows. These usually have a wavy solidified surface texture.

More fluid lavas have solidified surface textures that volcanologists classify into four types. Pillow lava forms when a trigger, often lava making contact with water, causes a lava flow to cool rapidly. This splinters the surface of the lava, and the magma then collects into sacks that often pile up in front of the flow, forming a structure called a pillow. A’a lava has a rough, spiny surface made of clasts of lava called clinkers. Block lava is another type of lava, with less jagged fragments than in a’a lava. Pahoehoe lava is by far the most common lava type, both on Earth and probably the other terrestrial planets. It has a smooth surface, with mounds, hollows and folds.

==Gentle/explosive activity==

A volcanic eruption could just be a simple outpouring of material onto the surface of a planet, but they usually involve a complex mixture of solids, liquids and gases which behave in equally complex ways. Some types of explosive eruptions can release energy a quarter that of an equivalent mass of TNT.

===Causes of explosive activity===

====Exsolution of volatiles====
Volcanic eruptions on Earth have been consistently observed to progress from erupting gas rich material to gas depleted material, although an eruption may alternate between erupting gas rich to gas depleted material and vice versa multiple times. This can be explained by the enrichment of magma at the top of a dike by gas which is released when the dike breaches the surface, followed by magma from lower down than did not get enriched with gas.

The reason the dissolved gas in the magma separates from it when the magma nears the surface is due to the effects of temperature and pressure on gas solubility. Pressure increases gas solubility, and if a liquid with dissolved gas in it depressurises, the gas will tend to exsolve (or separate) from the liquid. An example of this is what happens when a bottle of carbonated drink is quickly opened: when the seal is opened, pressure decreases and bubbles of carbon dioxide gas appear throughout the liquid.

Fluid magmas erupt quietly. Any gas that has exsolved from the magma easily escapes even before it reaches the surface. However, in viscous magmas, gases remain trapped in the magma even after they have exsolved, forming bubbles inside the magma. These bubbles enlarge as the magma nears the surface due to the dropping pressure, and the magma grows substantially. This fact gives volcanoes erupting such material a tendency to ‘explode’, although instead of the pressure increase associated with an explosion, pressure always decreases in a volcanic eruption.

Generally, explosive cryovolcanism is driven by exsolution of volatiles that were previously dissolved into the cryomagma, similar to what happens in explosive silicate volcanism as seen on Earth, which is what is mainly covered below.

====Physics of a volatile-driven explosive eruption====
Silica-rich magmas cool beneath the surface before they erupt. As they do this, bubbles exsolve from the magma. As the magma nears the surface, the bubbles and thus the magma increase in volume. The resulting pressure eventually breaks through the surface, and the release of pressure causes more gas to exsolve, doing so explosively. The gas may expand at hundreds of metres per second, expanding upward and outward. As the eruption progresses, a chain reaction causes the magma to be ejected at higher and higher speeds.

=====Volcanic ash formation=====
The violently expanding gas disperses and breaks up magma, forming a colloid of gas and magma called volcanic ash. The cooling of the gas in the ash as it expands chills the magma fragments, often forming tiny glass shards recognisable as portions of the walls of former liquid bubbles. In more fluid magmas the bubble walls may have time to reform into spherical liquid droplets. The final state of the colloids depends strongly on the ratio of liquid to gas. Gas-poor magmas end up cooling into rocks with small cavities, becoming vesicular lava. Gas-rich magmas cool to form rocks with cavities that nearly touch, with an average density less than that of water, forming pumice. Meanwhile, other material can be accelerated with the gas, becoming volcanic bombs. These can travel with so much energy that large ones can create craters when they hit the ground.

=====Pyroclastic flows=====
A colloid of volcanic gas and magma can form as a density current called a pyroclastic flow. This occurs when erupted material falls back to the surface. The colloid is somewhat fluidised by the gas, allowing it to spread. Pyroclastic flows can often climb over obstacles, and devastate human life. Pyroclastic flows are a common feature at explosive volcanoes on Earth. Pyroclastic flows have been found on Venus, for example at the Dione Regio volcanoes.

====Phreatic eruption====
A phreatic eruption can occur when hot water under pressure is depressurised. Depressurisation reduces the boiling point of the water, so when depressurised the water suddenly boils. Or it may happen when groundwater is suddenly heated, flashing to steam suddenly.
When water turns into steam in a phreatic eruption, it expands at supersonic speeds, up to 1,700 times its original volume. This can be enough to shatter solid rock, and hurl rock fragments hundreds of metres.

====Phreatomagmatic eruption====
A phreatomagmatic eruption occurs when hot magma makes contact with water, creating an explosion.

====Clathrate hydrates====

One mechanism for explosive cryovolcanism is cryomagma making contact with clathrate hydrates. Clathrate hydrates, if exposed to warm temperatures, readily decompose. A 1982 article pointed out the possibility that the production of pressurised gas upon destabilisation of clathrate hydrates making contact with warm rising magma could produce an explosion that breaks through the surface, resulting in explosive cryovolcanism.

====Water vapor in a vacuum====
If a fracture reaches the surface of an icy body and the column of rising water is exposed to the near-vacuum of the surface of most icy bodies, it will immediately start to boil, because its vapor pressure is much more than the ambient pressure. Not only that, but any volatiles in the water will exsolve. The combination of these processes will release droplets and vapor, which can rise up the fracture, creating a plume. This is thought to be partially responsible for Enceladus&#x27;s ice plumes.

==Occurrence==
===Earth===
On Earth, volcanoes are most often found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and because most of Earth&#x27;s plate boundaries are underwater, most volcanoes are found underwater. For example, a mid-ocean ridge, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust&#x27;s plates, such as in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande rift in North America. Volcanism away from plate boundaries has been postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs from the core–mantle boundary, deep within Earth. This results in hotspot volcanism, of which the Hawaiian hotspot is an example. Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another. In 1912–1952, in the Northern Hemisphere, studies show that within this time, winters were warmer due to no massive eruptions that had taken place. These studies demonstrate how these eruptions can cause changes within the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

Large eruptions can affect atmospheric temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the Sun and cool Earth&#x27;s troposphere. Historically, large volcanic eruptions have been followed by volcanic winters which have caused catastrophic famines.

===Moon===
Earth&#x27;s Moon has no large volcanoes and no current volcanic activity, although recent evidence suggests it may still possess a partially molten core. However, the Moon does have many volcanic features such as maria (the darker patches seen on the Moon), rilles and domes.

===Venus===
The planet Venus has a surface that is 90% basalt, indicating that volcanism played a major role in shaping its surface. The planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago, from what scientists can tell from the density of impact craters on the surface. Lava flows are widespread and forms of volcanism not present on Earth occur as well. Changes in the planet&#x27;s atmosphere and observations of lightning have been attributed to ongoing volcanic eruptions, although there is no confirmation of whether or not Venus is still volcanically active. However, radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Venus&#x27;s highest volcano Maat Mons, in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank. However, the interpretation of the flows as ash flows has been questioned.

===Mars===

There are several extinct volcanoes on Mars, four of which are vast shield volcanoes far bigger than any on Earth. They include Arsia Mons, Ascraeus Mons, Hecates Tholus, Olympus Mons, and Pavonis Mons. These volcanoes have been extinct for many millions of years, but the European &quot;Mars Express&quot; spacecraft has found evidence that volcanic activity may have occurred on Mars in the recent past as well.

===Moons of Jupiter===
====Io====
Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io is the most volcanically active object in the Solar System because of tidal interaction with Jupiter. It is covered with volcanoes that erupt sulfur, sulfur dioxide and silicate rock, and as a result, Io is constantly being resurfaced. There are only two planets in the solar system where volcanoes can be easily seen due to their high activity, Earth and Io. Its lavas are the hottest known anywhere in the Solar System, with temperatures exceeding 1,800 K (1,500 °C). In February 2001, the largest recorded volcanic eruptions in the Solar System occurred on Io.

====Europa====
Europa, the smallest of Jupiter&#x27;s Galilean moons, also appears to have an active volcanic system, except that its volcanic activity is entirely in the form of water, which freezes into ice on the frigid surface. This process is known as cryovolcanism, and is apparently most common on the moons of the outer planets of the Solar System.

===Moons of Saturn and Neptune===
In 1989, the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft observed cryovolcanoes (ice volcanoes) on Triton, a moon of Neptune, and in 2005 the &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; probe photographed fountains of frozen particles erupting from Enceladus, a moon of Saturn. The ejecta may be composed of water, liquid nitrogen, ammonia, dust, or methane compounds. &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; also found evidence of a methane-spewing cryovolcano on the Saturnian moon Titan, which is believed to be a significant source of the methane found in its atmosphere. It is theorized that cryovolcanism may also be present on the Kuiper Belt Object Quaoar.

===Exoplanets===
A 2010 study of the exoplanet COROT-7b, which was detected by transit in 2009, suggested that tidal heating from the host star very close to the planet and neighboring planets could generate intense volcanic activity similar to that found on Io.

<doc id="81260" wikidata="Q116505645" url="?curid=81260" title="The Political Compass">
<text>The Political Compass is a website soliciting responses to a set of 62 propositions in order to rate political ideology in a spectrum with two axes: one about economic policy (left–right) and another about social policy (authoritarian–libertarian).

== History ==
The Political Compass website was established by political journalist Wayne Brittenden.

On July 2, 2001, an early version of the website appeared on the web server of One World Action. The creators of The Political Compass acknowledged intellectual influences such as Wilhelm Reich and Theodor Adorno for their contributions to the field.

== Political model ==

The underlying theory of the political model used by The Political Compass is that political ideology may be better measured along two separate, independent axes. The economic (left–right) axis measures one&#x27;s opinion of how the economy should be run. In economic terms, the political left is defined as the desire for the economy to be run by a cooperative collective agency, which can mean a sovereign state but also a network of communes, while the political right is defined as the desire for the economy to be left to the devices of competing individuals and organizations. The test&#x27;s propositions lead the individual undertaking the test to wonder about things like &quot;Is military action that defies international law sometimes justified?&quot;, &quot;Should mothers have demanding careers?&quot;, &quot;If economic globalisation is inevitable, should it primarily serve humanity or multinational corporates?&quot;

The other axis (authoritarian–libertarian) measures one&#x27;s political opinions in a social sense, regarding the amount of personal freedom that one would allow. &quot;Libertarianism&quot; is defined as the belief that personal freedom should be maximised, while &quot;authoritarianism&quot; is defined as the belief that authority should be obeyed. This makes it possible to divide people into four, colour marked quadrants: authoritarian left (red in the top left), authoritarian right (blue in the top right), libertarian right (yellow or purple in the bottom right), and libertarian left (green in the bottom left). The makers of the Political Compass say that the quadrants &quot;are not separate categories, but regions on a continuum&quot;.

== Reception ==

Several prominent individuals in academia and media have voiced criticisms of the Political Compass test.

The academic William Clifton van der Linden says that the Political Compass uses a method called dimensionality reduction to try to make its results more dependable. According to him, dependable results is practice that is &quot;roundly criticized&quot; by scholars because it fails to give accurate results. Van der Linden uses scholarly sources to support his analysis of the reliability of Voter Advice Applications, such as the Political Compass. These sources include research by Gemenis and Kostas (2013) from Acta Politica, Otjes and Louwerse (2014) from Electoral Studies, and Germann, Mendez, Wheatley, and Serdült (2015) from Acta Politica.

Daniel J. Mitchell, a Libertarian economist for Foundation for Economic Education, critiques the Political Compass Test for its placement of historical figures and politicians, such as Adolf Hitler being classified on the left side of the horizontal axis and Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s proximity to Joseph Stalin and Hitler on the vertical axis. He also expresses disappointment with his own placement, feeling he should have scored stronger on the right for economic issues and more libertarian on social issues. Mitchell disagrees with the test&#x27;s placement of well-known individuals, such as Milton Friedman being rated as less libertarian on economics and Benito Mussolini being placed as far right, while Mitchell says that he opposed capitalism. He finds Hillary Clinton&#x27;s classification as right-leaning on economic policy and Donald Trump being ranked as more authoritarian than Robert Mugabe, Mao Zedong, and Fidel Castro to be nonsensical.

Encyclopedia Britannica has highlighted that the scientific basis for these models has frequently been questioned. Specifically, the Political Compass has faced criticism for allegedly propagating libertarian ideas.

Author Brian Patrick Michell takes issue with the positioning of ideologies and the framing of economic freedom on the horizontal axis. Michell criticizes the political compass for placing American libertarians on the far right of the economic freedom scale, suggesting it implies economic freedom is solely linked with right-wing ideology. He also questions the accuracy of the compass&#x27;s representation of ideologies, highlighting the possibility of communal fascism in the upper left and neoliberal fascism in the upper right, which he believes oversimplifies complex political ideologies.

British journalist Tom Utley criticizes the phrasing of some questions on the test, finding them irritating and difficult to answer accurately. He highlights the complexity of political views and the inadequacy of condensing them into simplistic labels. He cites an example of that he identifies as libertarian Right on the political compass, placing him in a similar position to Charles Kennedy, despite their ideological differences.

J. C. Lester PhD alumnus of the London School of Economics, writing for the &quot;Journal of Social Philosophy&quot; in 1996, opined that the compass is a positive tool that provides clarity in understanding political positions, particularly in navigating the complexities of modern ideological divisions. Lester described the compass as more nuanced than the traditional left-right spectrum, and specifically praising the compass for its ability to clarify the placement of libertarianism, which he argues is often misunderstood or ambiguously positioned within political discourse.

=== Similar models ===
Several other multi-axis models of the political spectrum exist, sharing similarities with The Political Compass. One notable example is the Nolan Chart, devised by American libertarian David Nolan. Additionally, comparable charts were presented in Albert Meltzer and Stuart Christie&#x27;s &quot;The Floodgates of Anarchy&quot; in 1970, and in the Rampart Journal of Individualist Thought by Maurice C. Bryson and William R. McDill in 1968.

=== Reddit ===
r/PoliticalCompassMemes is a subreddit dedicated to humorous criticism of ideologies, where users identify their ideologies with user flairs based on The Political Compass. In June 2022, the subreddit was used in a study by researchers at Monash University to predict users&#x27; political ideologies based on their digital footprints.

<text>Shanxi is a province in North China. Its capital and largest city of the province is Taiyuan, while its next most populated prefecture-level cities are Changzhi and Datong. Its one-character abbreviation is (), after the state of Jin that existed there during the Spring and Autumn period ().

The name &quot;Shanxi&quot; means &#x27;west of the mountains&#x27;, a reference to its location west of the Taihang Mountains. Shanxi borders Hebei to the east, Henan to the south, Shaanxi to the west and Inner Mongolia to the north. Shanxi&#x27;s terrain is characterised by a plateau bounded partly by mountain ranges. Shanxi&#x27;s culture is largely dominated by the ethnic Han majority, who make up over 99% of its population. Jin Chinese is considered by some linguists to be a distinct language from Mandarin and its geographical range covers most of Shanxi. Both Jin and Mandarin are spoken in Shanxi.

Shanxi is a leading producer of coal in China, possessing roughly a third of China&#x27;s total coal deposits. Nevertheless, Shanxi&#x27;s GDP per capita remains below the national average. The province hosts the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center.

The province is also known for having by far the largest number of historic buildings among all Chinese provinces, by possessing over 70% of China&#x27;s surviving buildings built during or predating the Song dynasty. Also notable are the Yungang Grottoes in Datong, which date back over 1500 years.

==History==
===Pre-Imperial China===
In the Spring and Autumn period (), the state of Jin was located in what is now Shanxi. It underwent a three-way split into the states of Han, Zhao, and Wei in 403 BC, a traditional date sometimes taken as the start of the Warring States period (221 BC). By 221 BC, all of these states had fallen to the state of Qin, which established the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC).

===Imperial China===
The Han dynasty (206 BC – AD 220) ruled Shanxi as the province of Bingzhou.

During the invasion of northern nomads in the Sixteen Kingdoms period (304–439), several regimes including the Later Zhao, Former Yan, Former Qin, and Later Yan continuously controlled Shanxi. They were followed by Northern Wei (386–534), a Xianbei kingdom, which had one of its earlier capitals at present-day Datong in northern Shanxi, and which went on to rule nearly all of northern China.

The Tang dynasty (618–907) originated in Taiyuan. During the Tang dynasty and after, present day Shanxi was called &quot;Hédōng&quot; (), or &quot;east of the (Yellow) river&quot;. Empress Wu Zetian, one of China&#x27;s only female rulers, was born in Shanxi in 624.

During the first part of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–960), Shanxi supplied rulers of three of the Five Dynasties. Among the Ten Kingdoms, it was the only one located in northern China. Shanxi was initially home to the &quot;jiedushi&quot; (commander) of Hedong, Li Cunxu, who overthrew the first of the Five Dynasties, Later Liang (907–923) to establish the second, Later Tang (923–936). Another &quot;jiedushi&quot; of Hedong, Shi Jingtang, overthrew Later Tang to establish the third of the Five Dynasties, Later Jin, and yet another &quot;jiedushi&quot; of Hedong, Liu Zhiyuan, established the fourth of the Five Dynasties (Later Han) after the Khitans destroyed Later Jin, the third. Finally, when the fifth of the Five Dynasties (Later Zhou) emerged, the &quot;jiedushi&quot; of Hedong at the time, Liu Chong, rebelled and established an independent state called Northern Han, one of the Ten Kingdoms, in what is now northern and central Shanxi.

Shi Jingtang, founder of the Later Jin, the third of the Five Dynasties, ceded a piece of northern China to the Khitans in return for military assistance. This territory, called the Sixteen Prefectures of Yanyun, included a part of northern Shanxi. The ceded territory became a major problem for the Song dynasty&#x27;s defense against the Khitans for the next 100 years because it lay south of the Great Wall.

The later Zhou, the last dynasty of the Five Dynasties period was founded by Guo Wei, a Han Chinese, who served as the Assistant Military Commissioner at the court of the Later Han which was ruled by Shatuo Turks. He founded his dynasty by launching a military coup against the Turkic Later Han Emperor however, his newly established dynasty was short-lived and was conquered by the Song dynasty in 960.
In the early years of the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127), the sixteen ceded prefectures continued to be an area of contention between the Song dynasty and the Liao dynasty. Later the Southern Song dynasty abandoned all of North China, including Shanxi, to the Jurchen Jin dynasty (1115–1234) in 1127 after the Jingkang Incident of the Jin-Song wars.

The Mongol Yuan dynasty administered China into provinces but did not establish Shanxi as a province. Shanxi only gained its present name and approximate borders during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) which were of the same land area and borders as the previous Hedong Commandery of the Tang dynasty.

During the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), Shanxi extended north beyond the Great Wall to include parts of Inner Mongolia, including what is now the city of Hohhot, and overlapped with the jurisdiction of the Eight Banners and the Guihua Tümed banner in that area.

For centuries, Shanxi served as a center for trade and banking. The &quot;Shanxi merchants&quot; were once synonymous with wealth. The well-preserved city and UNESCO World Heritage Site Pingyao shows many signs of its economic importance during the Qing dynasty.

===Early Republic of China (1912–1937)===

With the collapse of the Qing dynasty, Shanxi became part of the newly established Republic of China. From 1911 to 1949, during the period of the Republic of China&#x27;s period of rule over Mainland China, Shanxi was mostly dominated by the warlord Yan Xishan until the Chinese Communist Party took full control in 1949; Communists had already set up secret bases in 1936, but did not completely overturn Yan and the Nationalist government until 1949. Early in Yan&#x27;s rule he decided that, unless he was able to modernize and revive the economy of his small, poor, remote province, he would be unable to protect Shanxi from rival warlords. Yan devoted himself to modernizing Shanxi and developing its resources during his reign over the province. He has been viewed by Western biographers as a transitional figure who advocated using Western technology to protect Chinese traditions, while at the same time reforming older political, social and economic conditions in a way that paved the way for the radical changes that would occur after his rule.

In 1918 there was an outbreak of bubonic plague in northern Shanxi that lasted for two months and killed 2,664 people. Yan&#x27;s interactions with the Western medical personnel he met with to discuss how to suppress the epidemic inspired him to modernize and improve Shanxi&#x27;s medical infrastructure which he began by funding the Research Society for the Advancement of Chinese Medicine, based in Taiyuan, in 1921. Highly unusual in China at the time, the school had a four-year curriculum and included courses in both Chinese and Western Medicine. The main skills that Yan hoped physicians trained at the school would learn were: a standardized system of diagnosis; sanitary science, including bacteriology; surgical skills, including obstetrics; and, the use of diagnostic instruments. Yan hoped that his support of the school would eventually lead to increased revenues in the domestic and international trade of Chinese drugs, improved public health, and improved public education. Yan&#x27;s promotion of a modern curriculum and infrastructure of Chinese medicine achieved limited success, but much of the teaching and publication that this school of medicine produced was limited to the area around Taiyuan: by 1949 three of the seven government-run hospitals were in the city. In 1934 the province produced a ten-year-plan that envisaged employing a hygiene worker in every village, but the Japanese invasion in 1937 and the subsequent civil war made it impossible to carry these plans out. Yan&#x27;s generous support for the Research Association for the Improvement of Chinese Medicine generated a body of teaching and publication in modern Chinese medicine that became one of the foundations of the national institution of modern traditional Chinese medicine that was adopted in the 1950s.

Yan invested in Shanxi&#x27;s industrial infrastructure, and by 1949 the area around Taiyuan was a major national producer of coal, iron, chemicals, and munitions. Yan was able to protect the province from his rivals for the period of his rule partially due to his building of an arsenal in Taiyuan that, for the entire period of his administration, remained the only center in China capable of producing field artillery. Yan&#x27;s army was successful in eradicating banditry in Shanxi, allowing him to maintain a relatively high level of public order and security.

Yan went to great lengths to eradicate social traditions which he considered antiquated. He insisted that all men in Shanxi abandon their Qing-era queues, giving police instructions to clip off the queues of anyone still wearing them. In one instance, Yan lured people into theatres in order to have his police systematically cut the hair of the audience. He attempted to combat widespread female illiteracy by creating in each district at least one vocational school in which peasant girls could be given a primary-school education and taught domestic skills. After National Revolutionary Army military victories in the 1925 generated great interest in Shanxi for the Kuomintang&#x27;s ideology, including women&#x27;s rights, Yan allowed girls to enroll in middle school and college, where they promptly formed a women&#x27;s association.

Yan attempted to eradicate the custom of foot binding, threatening to sentence men who married women with bound feet, and mothers who bound their daughters&#x27; feet, to hard labor in state-run factories. He discouraged the use of the traditional lunar calendar and encouraged the development of local boy scout organizations. Like the Communists who later succeeded Yan, he punished habitual lawbreakers to &quot;redemption through labour&quot; in state-run factories.

After the failed attempt by the Chinese Red Army to establish bases in southern Shanxi in early 1936 Yan became convinced that the Communists were lesser threats to his rule than either the Nationalists or the Japanese. He then negotiated a secret anti-Japanese &quot;United Front&quot; with the Communists in October 1936 and invited them to establish operations in Shanxi. Yan, under the slogan &quot;resistance against the enemy and defense of the soil&quot;, attempted to recruit young, patriotic intellectuals to his government in order to organize a local resistance to the threat of Japanese invasion. By the end of 1936 Taiyuan had become a gathering point for anti-Japanese intellectuals from all over China.

===War with Japan and the Chinese Civil War (1937–1949)===
The Marco Polo Bridge Incident in July 1937 led the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces to invade China, and Shanxi was one of the first areas the Japanese attacked. When it became clear to Yan that his forces might not be successful in repelling the Imperial Japanese Army, he invited Communist military forces to re-enter Shanxi. Zhu De became the commander of the Eighth Route Army active in Shanxi and was named the vice-commander of the Second War Zone, under Yan himself. Yan initially responded warmly to the re-entry of the arrival of Communist forces, and they were greeted with enthusiasm by Yan&#x27;s officials and officers. Communist forces arrived in Shanxi just in time to help defeat a decisively more powerful Japanese force attempting to move through the strategic Pingxing Pass. The Battle of Pingxingguan was the largest battle won by the Communists against the Japanese.

After the Japanese responded to this defeat by outflanking the defenders and moving towards Taiyuan, the Communists avoided decisive battles and mostly attempted to harass Japanese forces and sabotage Japanese lines of supply and communication. The Japanese suffered, but mostly ignored the Eighth Route Army and continued to advance towards Yan&#x27;s capital. The lack of attention directed at their forces gave the Communists time to recruit and propagandize among the local peasant populations (who generally welcomed Communist forces enthusiastically) and to organize a network of militia units, local guerrilla bands and popular mass organizations.

Genuine Communist efforts to resist the Japanese gave them the authority to carry out sweeping and radical social and economic reforms, mostly related to land and wealth redistribution, which they defended by labeling those who resisted as &quot;Hanjian&quot;. Communist efforts to resist the Japanese also won over Shanxi&#x27;s small population of patriotic intellectuals, and conservative fears of resisting them effectively gave the Communists unlimited access to the rural population. Subsequent atrocities committed by the Japanese in the effort to rid Shanxi of Communist guerrillas aroused the hatred of millions in the Shanxi countryside, causing the rural population to turn to the Communists for leadership against the Japanese. All of these factors explain how, within a year of re-entering Shanxi, the Communists were able to take control of most of Shanxi not firmly held by the Japanese.
During the Battle of Xinkou, the Chinese defenders resisted the efforts of Japan&#x27;s elite Itakagi Division for over a month, despite Japanese advantages in artillery and air support. By the end of October 1937, Japan&#x27;s losses were four times greater than those suffered at Pingxingguan, and the Itakagi Division was close to defeat. Contemporary Communist accounts called the battle &quot;the most fierce in North China&quot;, while Japanese accounts called the battle a &quot;stalemate&quot;. In an effort to save their forces at Xinkou, Japanese forces began an effort to occupy Shanxi from a second direction, in the east. After a week of fighting, Japanese forces captured the strategic Niangzi Pass, opening the way to capturing Taiyuan. Communist guerrilla tactics were ineffective in slowing down the Japanese advance. The defenders at Xinkou, realizing that they were in danger of being outflanked, withdrew southward, past Taiyuan, leaving a small force of 6,000 men to hold off the entire Japanese army. A representative of the Japanese Army, speaking of the final defense of Taiyuan, said that &quot;nowhere in China have the Chinese fought so obstinately&quot;.

The Japanese suffered 30,000 dead and an equal number wounded in their effort to take northern Shanxi. A Japanese study found that the battles of Pingxingguan, Xinkou, and Taiyuan were responsible for over half of all the casualties suffered by the Japanese army in North China. Yan himself was forced to withdraw after having 90% of his army destroyed, including a large force of reinforcements sent into Shanxi by the central government. Throughout 1937, numerous high-ranking Communist leaders, including Mao Zedong, lavished praise on Yan for waging an uncompromising campaign of resistance against the Japanese. Possibly because of the severity of his losses in northern Shanxi, Yan abandoned a plan of defense based on positional warfare, and began to reform his army as a force capable of waging guerrilla warfare. After 1938 most of Yan&#x27;s followers came to refer to his regime as a &quot;guerrilla administration&quot;.

After the surrender of Japan and the end of the Second World War, Yan Xishan was notable for his ability to recruit thousands of Japanese soldiers stationed in northwest Shanxi in 1945, including their commanding officers, into his army. By recruiting the Japanese into his service in the manner that he did, he retained both the extensive industrial complex around Taiyuan and virtually all of the managerial and technical personnel employed by the Japanese to run it. Yan was so successful in convincing surrendered Japanese to work for him that, as word spread to other areas of north China, Japanese soldiers from those areas began to converge on Taiyuan to serve his government and army. At its greatest strength the Japanese &quot;special forces&quot; under Yan totaled 15,000 troops, plus an officer corps that was distributed throughout Yan&#x27;s army. These numbers were reduced to 10,000 after serious American efforts to repatriate the Japanese were partially successful. Yan&#x27;s Japanese army was instrumental in helping him to retain control of most of northern Shanxi during much of the subsequent Chinese Civil War, but by 1949 casualties had reduced the number of Japanese soldiers under Yan&#x27;s command to 3,000. The leader of the Japanese under Yan&#x27;s command, Hosaku Imamura, committed suicide on the day that Taiyuan fell to Communist forces.

Yan Xishan himself (along with most of the provincial treasury) was airlifted out of Taiyuan in March 1949. Shortly afterwards Republic of China Air Force planes stopped dropping food and supplies for the defenders due to fears of being shot down by the advancing Communists. The People&#x27;s Liberation Army, depending largely on their reinforcements of artillery, launched a major assault on April 20, 1949, and succeeded in taking all positions surrounding Taiyuan by April 22. A subsequent appeal to the defenders to surrender was refused. On the morning of April 22, 1949, the PLA bombarded Taiyuan with 1,300 pieces of artillery and breached the city&#x27;s walls, initiating bloody street-to-street fighting for control of the city. At 10:00 am, April 22, the Taiyuan Campaign ended with the Communists in complete control of Shanxi. Total Nationalist casualties amounted to all 145,000 defenders, many of whom were taken as POWs. The Communists lost 45,000 men and an unknown number of civilian laborers they had drafted, all of whom were either killed or injured.

The fall of Taiyuan was one of the few examples in the Chinese Civil War in which Nationalist forces echoed the defeated Ming loyalists who had, in the 17th century, brought entire cities to ruins resisting the invading Manchus. Many Nationalist officers were reported to have committed suicide when the city fell. The dead included Yan&#x27;s nephew-in-law, who was serving as governor, and his cousin, who ran his household. Liang Huazhi, the head of Yan&#x27;s &quot;Patriotic Sacrifice League&quot;, had fought for years against the Communists in Shanxi until he was finally trapped in the massively fortified city of Taiyuan. For six months Liang put up a fierce resistance, leading both Yan&#x27;s remaining Republic of China Army forces and his thousands of Japanese mercenaries. When Communist troops finally broke into the city and began to occupy large sections of it, Liang barricaded himself inside a large, fortified prison complex filled with Communist prisoners. In a final act of desperation, Liang set fire to the prison and committed suicide as the entire compound burned to the ground.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China (1949–present)===
Soon after the Chinese Communist Revolution, Mao Zedong assigned Kang Sheng to carry out land reform in Shanxi. Kang encouraged the populace to have numerous farmers from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds denounced as &quot;landlords,&quot; beaten, arrested, and executed. In some areas of the province as many as one in five residents were denounced as landlords, and his program was copied throughout the rest of the new People&#x27;s Republic of China. Shanxi became the site of Mao&#x27;s &quot;model brigade&quot; of Dazhai: a utopian communist scheme in Xiyang County that was supposed to be the model for all other peasants in China to emulate. If the people of Dazhai were especially suited for such an experiment, it is possible that decades of Yan&#x27;s socialist indoctrination may have prepared the people of Shanxi for Communist rule. After the death of Mao, the experiment was discontinued, and most peasants reverted to private farming under post-Maoist economic reforms.

== Geography ==
Shanxi is located on a plateau made up of higher ground to the east (Taihang Mountains) and the west (Lüliang Mountains) and a series of valleys in the center through which the Fen River runs. The highest peak is Mount Wutai (Wutai Shan) in northeastern Shanxi with an altitude of 3,058 m. The Great Wall of China forms most of the northern border with Inner Mongolia. The Zhongtiao Mountains run along part of the southern border and separate Shanxi from the east–west part of the Yellow River. Mount Hua is to the southwest.

The Yellow River forms the western border of Shanxi with Shaanxi. The Fen and Qin rivers, tributaries of the Yellow River, run north-to-south through the province, and drain much of its area. The north of the province is drained by tributaries of the Hai River, such as Sanggan and Hutuo rivers. The largest natural lake in Shanxi is Xiechi Lake, a salt lake near Yuncheng in southwestern Shanxi.

Shanxi has a continental monsoon climate, and is rather arid. Average January temperatures are below 0 °C, while average July temperatures are around 21–26 °C.

The outline of Shanxi&#x27;s territory is a parallelogram that runs from southwest to northeast. It is a typical mountain plateau widely covered by loess. The terrain is high in the northeast and low in the southwest. The interior of the plateau is undulating, the valleys are vertical and horizontal, and the types of landforms are complex and diverse. There are mountains, hills, terraces, plains, and rivers. The area of mountains and hills accounts for 80.1% of the total area of the province, and the area of Pingchuan and river valleys accounts for 19.9% of the total area. Most of the province&#x27;s altitude is above 1,500 meters, and the highest point is the Yedoufeng, the main peak of Wutai Mountain, with an altitude of 3061.1 meters, which is the highest peak in northern China.

=== Climate ===

Shanxi is located in the inland of the mid-latitude zone and belongs to the temperate continental monsoon climate in terms of climate type. Due to the influence of solar radiation, monsoon circulation and geographical factors, Shanxi&#x27;s climate has four distinct seasons, synchronous rain and heat, sufficient sunshine, significant climate difference between north and south, wide temperature difference between winter and summer, and large temperature difference between day and night. The annual average temperature in Shanxi Province is between 4.2 and 14.2 °C. The overall distribution trend is from north to south and from basin to high mountain. The annual precipitation in the whole province is between 358 and 621 mm, and the seasonal distribution is uneven. In June–August, the precipitation is relatively concentrated, accounting for about 60% of the annual precipitation, and the precipitation distribution in the province is greatly affected by the terrain.

=== Area ===

The province has a length of and a width of from east to west, with a total area of , accounting for 1.6% of the country&#x27;s total area.

==Administrative divisions==
Shanxi is divided into eleven prefecture-level divisions: all prefecture-level cities:

The 11 prefecture-level cities of Shanxi are subdivided into 118 county-level divisions (23 districts, 11 county-level cities, and 84 counties). Those are in turn divided into 1388 township-level divisions (561 towns, 634 townships, and 193 subdistricts). At the end of 2017, the total population of Shanxi is 37.02 million.

== Politics ==
The Governor of Shanxi is the highest-ranking official in the People&#x27;s Government of Shanxi. However, in the province&#x27;s dual party-government governing system, the Governor is subordinate to the provincial Communist Party Committee Secretary (), colloquially termed the &quot;Shanxi Party Committee Secretary&quot;. As is the case in almost all Chinese provinces, the provincial party secretary and Governor are not natives of Shanxi; rather, they are outsiders who are, in practice, appointed by the central party and government authorities.

The province went through significant political instability since 2004, due largely to the number of scandals that have hit the province on labour safety, the environment, and the interconnected nature between the provincial political establishment and big coal companies. Yu Youjun was sent by the central government in 2005 to become Governor but resigned in the wake of the Shanxi slave labour scandal in 2007. He was succeeded by Meng Xuenong, who had been previously sacked as Mayor of Beijing in the aftermath of the SARS outbreak. Meng himself was removed from office in 2008 after only a few months on the job due to the political fallout from the 2008 Shanxi mudslide. In 2008, provincial Political Consultative Conference Chair, one of the highest-ranked provincial officials, Jin Yinhuan, died in a car accident.

Since Xi Jinping&#x27;s ascendancy to General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party at the 18th Party Congress, numerous highly ranked officials in Shanxi have been placed under investigation for corruption-related offenses, including four incumbent members Bai Yun, Chen Chuanping, Du Shanxue, and Nie Chunyu of the provincial Communist Party Standing Committee. They were all removed from office around August 2014. The following were also removed from office:
* Ling Zhengce, the provincial Political Consultative Conference vice-chair and the older brother of Ling Jihua;
* Ling Jihua, the province&#x27;s Vice Governor Ren Runhou;
* Shen Weichen, former Taiyuan party secretary;
* Liu Suiji, Taiyuan police secretary;
* Jin Daoming, vice-chair of the provincial People&#x27;s Congress;
* Wang Maoshe, Yuncheng party secretary; and
* Feng Lixiang, Datong party secretary

Thousands of Shanxi officials were disciplined during the anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping. This necessitated a scramble to find suitable personnel for many vacated offices. In the aftermath of the &#x27;political earthquake&#x27;, party secretary Yuan Chunqing was removed from his post in September 2014, with Wang Rulin &#x27;helicoptered&#x27; into the provincial Party Secretary office.

==Economy==
The GDP per capita of Shanxi is below the national average. Compared to the provinces in east China, Shanxi is less developed for many reasons. Its geographic location limits its participation in international trade, which involves mostly eastern coastal provinces. Important crops in Shanxi include wheat, maize, millet, legumes, and potatoes. The local climate and dwindling water resources limit agriculture in Shanxi.

Mining-related industries are a major part of Shanxi&#x27;s economy. Shanxi possesses 260 billion metric tons of known coal deposits, about a third of China&#x27;s total. As a result, Shanxi is a leading producer of coal in China and has more coal companies than any other province, with an annual production exceeding 300 million metric tonnes. The Datong (), Ningwu (), Xishan (), Hedong (), Qinshui (), and Huoxi () coalfields are some of the most important in Shanxi. Shanxi also contains about 500 million tonnes of bauxite deposits, about a third of total Chinese bauxite reserves. Industry in Shanxi is centered around heavy industries such as coal and chemical production, power generation, and metal refining. 

As part of an effort to promote diversification in non-resource industries, since 2004, some local governments in Shanxi province have required that coal mining companies set aside funds for investing in non-coal business like agriculture and produce processing. In 2006, the provincial government established a policy of &quot;subsidizing peasants by coal&quot; which made this diversification a provincewide requirement and encouraged local governments to develop policies like subsidies and favorable tax treatment to further encourage mining companies to invest in non-coal business.

There are countless military-related industries in Shanxi due to its geographic location and history as the former base of the Chinese Communist Party and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre, one of China&#x27;s three satellite launch centers, is located in the middle of Shanxi with China&#x27;s largest stockpile of nuclear missiles.

Many private corporations, in joint ventures with the state-owned mining corporations, have invested billions of dollars in the mining industry of Shanxi . Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing made one of his largest investments ever in China in exploiting coal gas in Shanxi. Foreign investors include mining companies from Canada, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy.

The mining-related companies include Daqin Railway Co. Ltd., which runs one of the busiest and most technologically advanced railways in China, connecting Datong and Qinhuangdao exclusively for coal shipping. The revenue of Daqin Railway Co. Ltd. is among the highest among Shanxi companies due to its export of coal to Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia.

Shanxi&#x27;s nominal GDP in 2011 was 1110.0 billion yuan (US$176.2 billion), ranked 21st in China. Its per-capita GDP was 21,544 yuan (US$3,154).

Shanxi is affected by cases of bad working conditions in coal mining and other heavy industries. Thousands of workers have died every year in those industries. Cases of child labour abuse were discovered in 2011. The central government has responded by increasing oversight, including the suspension of four coal mines in August 2021, as well as ongoing investigations in Shanxi and neighboring Shaanxi.

== Health ==
In the 2000s, the province was considered to be one of the most polluted areas in China. The pollution, caused in part by heavy coal mining, has caused significant public health challenges.

== Culture ==


=== Language ===
The dialects spoken in Shanxi have traditionally been included in the Northern or Mandarin group. Since 1985, some linguists have argued that the dialects spoken in most of the province should be treated as a top-level division called Jin, based on its preservation of the Middle Chinese entering tone (stop-final) category, unlike other dialects in northern China. These dialects are also noted for extremely complex tone sandhi systems. The dialects spoken in some areas in southwestern Shanxi near the borders with Henan and Shaanxi are classified in the Zhongyuan Mandarin subdivision of the Mandarin group.

=== Cuisine ===
Shanxi cuisine is most well known for its extensive use of vinegar as a condiment, as well as for a huge variety of noodle dishes, particularly knife-cut noodles or &quot;daoxiao mian&quot; (), which are served with a range of sauces. A dish originating from Taiyuan, the provincial capital, is Taiyuan Tounao (). It is a breakfast dish; a porridge-like stew made with mutton, Chinese yam (), lotus roots, &quot;astragalus membranaceus&quot; (), tuber onions, and yellow cooking wine for additional aroma. It can be enjoyed by dipping pieces of unleavened flatbread into the soup, and is reputed to have medicinal properties. Pingyao is famous for its unique salt beef, while the areas around Wutai Shan are known for wild mushrooms. The most popular local spirit is fenjiu, a &quot;light fragrance&quot; variety of baijiu that is generally sweeter than other northern Chinese spirits.

=== Music ===
Shanxi Opera ( &quot;Jinju&quot;) is the local form of Chinese opera. It was popularized during the late Qing dynasty, with the help of the then-ubiquitous Shanxi merchants who were active across parts of China. Also called &quot;Zhonglu Bangzi&quot; (), it is a type of &quot;bangzi&quot; opera (), a group of operas generally distinguished by their use of wooden clappers for rhythm and by a more energetic singing style; Shanxi opera is also complemented by &quot;quzi&quot; (), a blanket term for more melodic styles from further south. Puzhou Opera ( &quot;Puju&quot;), from southern Shanxi, is a more ancient type of &quot;bangzi&quot; that makes use of very wide linear intervals.

=== Ancient commerce ===
Shanxi merchants ( &quot;Jinshang&quot;) constituted a historical phenomenon that lasted for centuries from the Song to the Qing dynasty. Shanxi merchants ranged far and wide from Central Asia to the coast of eastern China; by the Qing dynasty they were conducting trade across both sides of the Great Wall. During the late Qing dynasty, a new development occurred: the creation of &quot;piaohao&quot; (), which were essentially banks that provided services like money transfers and transactions, deposits, and loans. After the establishment of the first &quot;piaohao&quot; in Pingyao, the bankers in Shanxi dominated China&#x27;s financial market for centuries until the collapse of Qing dynasty and the coming of British banks.

<text>Xi&#x27;an is the capital of the Chinese province of Shaanxi. A sub-provincial city on the Guanzhong plain, the city is the third-most populous city in Western China after Chongqing and Chengdu, as well as the most populous city in Northwestern China. Its total population was 12.95 million as of the 2020 census, including an urban population of 9.28 million.

Known as Chang&#x27;an throughout much of its history, Xi&#x27;an is one of China&#x27;s Four Great Ancient Capitals, having held the position under several of the most important dynasties in Chinese history, including the Western Zhou, Qin, Western Han, Sui, Northern Zhou and Tang. Xi&#x27;an is now the second-most popular tourist destination in China. The city was one of the terminal points on the Silk Road during the ancient and medieval eras, as well as the home of the 3rd-century BC Terracotta Army commissioned by Emperor Qin Shi Huang—both of which are listed as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.

Since the 1980s, as part of the economic growth of inland China especially for the central and northwest regions, Xi&#x27;an has matured into a cultural, industrial, political and educational, and research and development hub. Xi&#x27;an currently holds sub-provincial status, administering 11 districts and 2 counties. In 2020, Xi&#x27;an was ranked as a Beta- (global second tier) city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, and, according to the country&#x27;s own ranking, ranked 17th; it is also one of the world&#x27;s top 100 financial centers according to the Global Financial Centres Index. Xi&#x27;an is ranked by the Nature Index as one the top 20 cities globally by scientific research output, and is home to multiple prestigious educational institutions, such as Xi&#x27;an Jiaotong University, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xidian University and Northwest University.

== Name ==
&quot;Xi&#x27;an&quot; is the atonal pinyin romanization of its Chinese name , &quot;Western Peace&quot;. (The apostrophe – known in Chinese as a , &quot;géyīn fúhào&quot; – should be included to distinguish its pronunciation from the single syllable &quot;xian&quot;.) The name was adopted in 1369 under the early Ming dynasty. Jesuit missionaries recorded its name as or &quot;Si-ngan-fou&quot; from its status as the seat of a prefecture (,&quot;fǔ&quot;). This form still appears in the Latin name of the Catholic diocese of Xi&#x27;an, . The name was later romanized as by Wade &amp; Giles and as &quot;Sianfu&quot; or &quot;Sian&quot; by the imperial post office, both of which were common until the promulgation of pinyin.

The area of present-day Xi&#x27;an has been the site of several important former Chinese cities. The capital of the Western Zhou were the twin cities of Feng and Hao, known collectively as Fenghao, located on opposite banks of the Feng River at its confluence with the southern bank of the Wei in the western suburbs of present-day Xi&#x27;an. The Qin capital Xianyang was erected north of the Wei during the Warring States period and was succeeded by the Western Han capital of Chang&#x27;an (), meaning &quot;Perpetual Peace&quot;, which was located south of the Wei and covered the central area of present-day Xi&#x27;an. During the Eastern Han, Chang&#x27;an was also known as the &quot;Western Capital&quot; (), named for its namesake position relative to the main capital at Luoyang. Under the Sui, its name became Daxing (, &quot;Greatly Prosperous&quot;) in AD 581. Under the Tang, the name reverted to Chang&#x27;an in 618. Under the Mongolian Yuan dynasty (13th &amp; 14th centuries), it held a succession of names: Fengyuan Anxi &quot;Peaceful West&quot;) and Jingzhao The Ming name &quot;Xi&#x27;an&quot; was changed back to Xijing (&quot;Western Capital&quot;, as above) between 1930 and 1943.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The Lantian Man was discovered in 1963 in Lantian County, southeast of Xi&#x27;an, and dates back to at least 500,000 years before the present time. A 6,500-year-old Neolithic village, Banpo, was discovered in 1953 on the eastern outskirts of the city proper, which contains the remains of several well organized Neolithic settlements carbon dated to 5,600–6,700 years ago. The site is now home to the Xi&#x27;an Banpo Museum, built in 1957 to preserve the archaeological collection.

===Ancient era===
Xi&#x27;an became a cultural and political center of China in the 11th century BC with the founding of the Zhou dynasty. The capital of Zhou was established in the twin settlements of Fengjing () and Haojing (), together known as Fenghao, located southwest of contemporary Xi&#x27;an. The settlement was also known as Zōngzhōu (宗周) to indicate its role as the capital of the vassal states. In 738 BC, King Ping of Zhou moved the capital to Luoyang due to political unrest.

===Imperial era===
Following the Warring States period, China was unified under the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) for the first time, with the capital located at Xianyang, just northwest of modern Xi&#x27;an. The first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang ordered the construction of the Terracotta Army and his mausoleum just to the east of Xi&#x27;an almost immediately after his ascension to the throne.

In 202 BC, the founding emperor Liu Bang of the Han dynasty established his capital in Chang&#x27;an County; his first palace, Changle Palace (, &quot;Perpetual Happiness&quot;) was built across the river from the ruin of the Qin capital. This is traditionally regarded as the founding date of Chang&#x27;an. Two years later, Liu Bang built Weiyang Palace (, &quot;Never Ending Palace&quot;) north of modern Xi&#x27;an. Weiyang Palace was the largest palace ever built on Earth, covering , which is 6.7 times the size of the current Forbidden City and 11 times the size of the Vatican City. The original Xi&#x27;an city wall was started in 194 BC and took 4 years to finish. Upon completion, the wall measured in length and in thickness at the base, enclosing an area of . In the year 190, amidst uprisings and rebellions just prior to the Three Kingdoms period, Dong Zhuo, a powerful warlord from nearby Xiliang, moved the court from Luoyang to Chang&#x27;an in a bid to avoid a coalition of other powerful warlords against him.

In 582, shortly after the Sui dynasty was founded, the emperor of Sui ordered a new capital to be built southeast of the Han capital, called Daxing (大興, &quot;Great prosperity&quot;). It consisted of three sections: the Imperial City, the palace section, and the civilian section, with a total area of within the city walls. At the time, it was the largest city in the world. The city was renamed Chang&#x27;an by the Tang dynasty. In the mid-7th century, after returning from his pilgrimage to India, the Buddhist monk Xuanzang established a translation school for Sanskrit scriptures.

Construction of the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda began in 652. This pagoda was in height, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras obtained from India by Xuanzang. In 707, construction of the Small Wild Goose Pagoda began. This pagoda measured tall at the time of completion, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras by Yijing. The massive 1556 Shaanxi earthquake eventually damaged the tower and reduced its height to .

The Nestorian Stele is a Tang Chinese stele erected in 781 that documents 150 years of early Christianity in China. It is a 279 cm tall limestone block with text in both Chinese and Syriac describing the existence of Christian communities in several cities in northern China. It reveals that the initial Nestorian Christian church had met recognition by the Tang Emperor Taizong, due to efforts of the Christian missionary Alopen in 635.

Chang&#x27;an was devastated at the end of the Tang dynasty in 904. Residents were forced to move to the new capital city in Luoyang, and a small area in the city continued to be occupied thereafter.

In the era of the Song dynasty, Xi&#x27;an was an important cultural center of scholarship and innovation on matters such as science, as well as historiography, religion, and philosophy in China. The Northern Song era saw its people, political culture, and strategic location be directly utilized by the Song dynasty proper and its continued relevance to Muslim travelers into China and Chinese Muslim residents.

During the Ming dynasty, a new wall was constructed in 1370 which remains intact to this day. The wall measures in circumference, in height, and in thickness at the base; a moat was also built outside the walls. The new wall and moat would protect a much smaller city of .

===Modern era===
The Qing dynasty established a walled off Manchu banner quarter in northeast Xi&#x27;an, on the site of the former palace of the Ming Prince of Qin. A Han banner quarter was established in the southeast of the city.

Manchu bannermen from the Xi&#x27;an banner garrison were praised for maintaining Manchu culture by Kangxi in 1703. Xi&#x27;an garrison Manchus were said to retain Manchu culture far better than all other Manchus at martial skills in the provincial garrisons and they were able to draw their bows properly and perform cavalry archery, unlike Beijing Manchus. The Qianlong emperor received a memorial staying Xi&#x27;an Manchu bannermen still had martial skills, although not up to those, in the past in a 1737 memorial from Cimbu. By the 1780s, the military skills of Xi&#x27;an Manchu bannermen dropped enormously, and they had been regarded as the most militarily skilled provincial Manchu banner garrison. Manchu women from the Xi&#x27;an garrison often left the walled Manchu garrison and went to hot springs outside the city, and gained bad reputations for their sexual lives. A Manchu from Beijing, Sumurji, was shocked and disgusted by this after being appointed Lieutenant general of the Manchu garrison of Xi&#x27;an and informed the Yongzheng emperor what they were doing. Han civilians and Manchu bannermen in Xi&#x27;an had bad relations, with the bannermen trying to steal at the markets. Manchu Lieutenant general Cimbru reported this to Yongzheng emperor in 1729, after he was assigned there. Governor Yue Rui of Shandong was then ordered by the Yongzheng to report any bannerman misbehaving and warned him not to cover it up in 1730, after Manchu bannermen were put in a quarter in Qingzhou. Manchu bannermen from the garrisons in Xi&#x27;an and Jingzhou fought in Xinjiang in the 1770s and Manchus from Xi&#x27;an garrison fought in other campaigns against the Dzungars and Uyghurs throughout the 1690s and 18th century. In the 1720s Jingzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanjing Manchu banner garrisons fought in Tibet.

For the over 200 years they lived next to each other, Han civilians and Manchu bannermen of both genders in Xi&#x27;an did not intermarry with each other at all. The Qing dynasty altered its law on intermarriage between Han civilians and Manchu bannermen several times in the dynasty. At the beginning of the Qing dynasty, the Qing allowed Han civilians to marry Manchu women. Then the Qing banned civilians from marrying women from the Eight banners later. In 1865, the Qing allowed Han civilian men to marry Manchu bannerwomen in all garrisons, except the capital garrison of Beijing. There was no formal law on marriage between people in the different banners, like the Manchu and Han banners, but it was informally regulated by social status and custom. In northeastern China, such as Heilongjiang and Liaoning, it was more common for Manchu women to marry Han men, since they were not subjected to the same laws and institutional oversight as Manchus and Han in Beijing and elsewhere.

In October 1911, during the Xinhai revolution, revolutionaries stormed the Manchu fort in Xi&#x27;an. Most of the city&#x27;s 20,000 Manchus were killed. Hui (Muslims; then referred to as &quot;Mohammedans&quot;) were divided in its support for the revolution. Those of Shaanxi supported the revolutionaries, while those of Gansu supported the Qing. The Hui of Xi&#x27;an (Shaanxi province) joined the Han Chinese revolutionaries in slaughtering the Manchus. Some wealthy Manchus survived by being ransomed. Wealthy Han Chinese enslaved Manchu girls and poor Han Chinese troops seized young Manchu women as wives. Hui Muslims also seized young pretty Manchu girls and raised them as Muslims.

A British missionary who witnessed the massacre commented that &quot;Old and young, men and women, children alike, were all butchered... Houses were plundered and then burnt; those who would fain have laid hidden till the storm was past, were forced to come out into the open. The revolutionaries, protected by a parapet of the wall, poured a heavy, unceasing, relentless fire into the doomed Tartar (Manchu) city, those who tried to escape thence into the Chinese city were cut down as they emerged from the gates.&quot;

In 1936, the Xi&#x27;an (then &quot;Sian&quot;) Incident took place in the city during the Chinese Civil War. The incident helped to bring the Kuomintang (KMT) and Chinese Communist Party to form the Second United Front in order to concentrate on fighting against the Imperial Japanese Army in the Second Sino-Japanese War.

On March 11, 1938, an aerial battle broke out for the first time over Xi&#x27;an as Imperial Japanese Army Air Force aircraft attacked the city, and was engaged by Chinese Air Force I-15 fighter planes, led by Lt. Cen Zeliu of the 5th Pursuit Group, 17th Squadron. While repeatedly attacked by air, Shaanxi was heavily fortified by units of the Eighth Route Army; Xi&#x27;an was never taken by the Japanese forces.

On May 20, 1949, the Communist-controlled People&#x27;s Liberation Army captured the city of Xi&#x27;an from the Kuomintang force.

During the Mao era, Xi&#x27;an was further developed as part of the Third Front Construction.

Xi&#x27;an made headlines for being one of the many cities where the 2012 China anti-Japanese demonstrations occurred.

In 2022, Xi&#x27;an witnessed the largest COVID-19 community outbreak since the initial months of the pandemic hit China. From December 23, 2021, the city was put into strict lockdown after local authorities reported more than 250 cases, traced to the Delta variant by authorities. This led to stressed healthcare and delayed or insufficient food deliveries to some part of the city. Restrictions of Xi&#x27;an were lifted on January 24.

<text>Soissons () is a commune in the northern French department of Aisne, in the region of Hauts-de-France. Located on the river Aisne, about northeast of Paris, it is one of the most ancient towns of France, and is probably the ancient capital of the Suessiones. Soissons is also the see of an ancient Roman Catholic diocese, whose establishment dates from about 300, and it was the location of a number of church synods called &quot;Council of Soissons&quot;.

==History==
Soissons enters written history under its Celtic name, later borrowed into Latin, Noviodunum, meaning &quot;new hillfort&quot;, which was the capital of the Suessiones. At Roman contact, it was a town of the Suessiones, mentioned by Julius Caesar (&quot;B. G.&quot; ii. 12). Caesar (&quot;B.C.&quot; 57), after leaving the Axona (modern Aisne), entered the territory of the Suessiones, and making one day&#x27;s long march, reached Noviodunum, which was surrounded by a high wall and a broad ditch. The place surrendered to Caesar.

From 457 to 486, under Aegidius and his son Syagrius, Noviodunum was the capital of the Kingdom of Soissons, until it fell to the Frankish king Clovis I in 486 after the Battle of Soissons.

Part of the Frankish territory of Neustria, the Soissons region, and the Abbey of Saint-Médard, founded in the sixth century, played an important political part during the rule of the Merovingian dynasty (447–751). After the death of Clovis I in 511, Soissons was made the capital of one of the four kingdoms into which his states were divided. Eventually, the kingdom of Soissons disappeared in 613 when the Frankish lands were amalgamated under Chlothar II.

The 744 Council of Soissons met at the instigation of Pepin the Short and Saint Boniface, the Pope&#x27;s missionary to pagan Germany, secured the condemnation of the Frankish bishop Adalbert and the missionary Clement of Ireland.

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, French forces committed a notorious massacre of English archers stationed at the town&#x27;s garrison, in which many of the French townsfolk were themselves raped and killed. The massacre of French citizens by French soldiers shocked Europe; Henry V of England, noting that the town of Soissons was dedicated to the saints Crispin and Crispinian, claimed to avenge the honour of the saints when he met the French forces at the Battle of Agincourt on Saint Crispin&#x27;s Day 1415. The town was liberated by French troops under the command of Joan of Arc on 23 July 1429.

Between June 1728 and July 1729 it hosted the Congress of Soissons an attempt to resolve a long-standing series of disputes between the Kingdom of Great Britain and Spain which had spilled over into the Anglo-Spanish War of 1727–1729. The Congress was largely successful and led to the signing of the Treaty of Seville between them.

During World War I, the city came under heavy bombardment. There was mutiny after the disastrous &quot;Chemin des Dames&quot; offensive at the Second Battle of the Aisne. A statue erected with images of French soldiers killed in action in 1917 is behind the St Peter&#x27;s Church, next to the Soissons Courthouse.
==Sights==
Today, Soissons is a commercial and manufacturing centre with the 12th-century Soissons Cathedral, the ruins of the Abbey of Saint-Jean-des-Vignes and the crypt of the former Abbey of Saint-Médard as three of its most important historical sites. The nearby Espace Pierres Folles contains a museum, geological trail, and botanical garden.

==Landmarks==

*Soissons Cathedral (&quot;Cathédrale Saint-Gervais-et-Saint-Protais de Soissons&quot;) is constructed in the style of Gothic architecture. The building of the south transept was begun about 1177, and the lowest courses of the choir in 1182. The choir with its original three-storey elevation and extremely tall clerestory was completed in 1211. This was earlier than Chartres Cathedral, on which the design was supposed to have been based. Work then continued into the nave until the late 13th century.
*Abbey of Notre-Dame – The former abbey of Notre Dame, former royal abbey, founded in the Merovingian era, known for its rich treasure of relics, including the &quot;shoe of the Virgin.&quot; The abbey had prestigious abbesses, among them Gisèle, sister of Charlemagne, and Catherine de Bourbon, aunt of Henry IV.
*Abbey of Saint-Médard – The Abbey of Saint-Médard was a Benedictine monastery of Soissons whose foundation went back to the sixth century. Today, only the crypt remains.
*Hôtel de ville – Since 1833 the city hall has been housed in a château built by architect Jean-François Advyné between 1772 and 1775 at the request of the Intendant Pelletier Mortefontaine on the site of a previous one belonging to the counts of Soissons.
*Arsenal – Exhibition space in the arsenal of the former Abbey of St. Jean des Vignes
*Passerelle des Anglais – The &quot;Passerelle des Anglais&quot; (literally: &quot;Footbridge of the English&quot;) is a concrete footbridge over the Aisne in the center of the city. The original bridge was destroyed in 1914. It was rebuilt by British soldiers of 9th Field Company Royal Engineers, after which it was known as the &quot;Pont des Anglais&quot; (&quot;Bridge of the English&quot;). Destroyed again during World War II, it was rebuilt in 1950 as a pedestrian bridge.
*The covered market – Built in 1908 by architect Albert-Désiré Guilbert (1866–1949)

<text>Pietro d&#x27;Abano, also known as Petrus de Apono, Petrus Aponensis or Peter of Abano (1316), was an Italian philosopher, astrologer, and professor of medicine in Padua. He was born in the Italian town from which he takes his name, now Abano Terme. He gained fame by writing &quot;Conciliator Differentiarum, quae inter Philosophos et Medicos Versantur&quot;. He was eventually accused of heresy and atheism, and came before the Inquisition. He died in prison in 1315 (some sources say 1316) before the end of his trial.

==Biography==
He lived in Greece for a period of time before he moved and commenced his studies for a long time at Constantinople (between 1270 and 1290). Around 1300 he moved to Paris, where he was promoted to the degrees of doctor in philosophy and medicine, in the practice of which he was very successful, but his fees were remarkably high. In Paris he became known as &quot;the Great Lombard&quot;. He settled at Padua, where he gained a reputation as a physician. In Padua he befriended an older scholar Paolo Tosetti. Also an astrologer, he was charged with practising magic: the particular accusations being that he brought back into his purse, by the aid of the devil, all the money he paid away, and that he possessed the philosopher&#x27;s stone.

Gabriel Naudé, in his &quot;Antiquitate Scholae Medicae Parisiensis&quot;, gives the following account of him:

He carried his enquiries so far into the occult sciences of abstruse and hidden nature, that, after having given most ample proofs, by his writings concerning physiognomy, geomancy, and palmistry, he moved on to the study of philosophy, physics, and astrology. These studies proved extremely advantageous to him. The first two led to his introduction to all the popes of his time and gained him a reputation among scholars. Beyond that, his mastery of astrology is shown by
* the astronomical figures he had painted in the great hall of the palace at Padua
* his translations of the books of the great learned rabbi Abraham Aben Ezra
* his own books on critical days
* the improvement of astronomy
*and the testimony of the renowned mathematician Regiomontanus, who praised his mastery of astrology in his public oration at Padua on &quot;Al-Farghani&#x27;s&quot; masterwork &quot;Elements of astronomy on the celestial motions&quot;.}

==Writings==
In his writings he expounds and advocates the medical and philosophical systems of Averroes, Avicenna, and other Islamic writers. His best known works are the &quot;Conciliator differentiarum quae inter philosophos et medicos versantur&quot; and &quot;De venenis eorumque remediis&quot;, both of which are extant in dozens of manuscripts and various printed editions from the late fifteenth through sixteenth centuries. The former was an attempt to reconcile apparent contradictions between medical theory and Aristotelian natural philosophy, and was considered authoritative as late as the sixteenth century.

The famous grimoire called the &quot;Heptameron&quot;, though anonymous, has been traditionally attributed to Abano. The &quot;Heptameron&quot; is a concise book of ritual magical rites concerned with conjuring specific angels for the seven days of the week, whence the title derives. He is also credited with writing &quot;De venenis eorumque remediis&quot;, which expounded on Arab theories concerning superstitions, poisons and contagions.

==The Inquisition==

He was twice brought to trial by the Inquisition; on the first occasion he was acquitted, and he died before the second trial was completed. He was found guilty, however, and his body was ordered to be exhumed and burned; but a friend had secretly removed it, and the Inquisition had, therefore, to content itself with the public proclamation of its sentence and the burning of Abano in effigy.

According to Naude:

Barrett (p. 157) refers to the opinion that it was not on the score of magic that the Inquisition sentenced Pietro to death, but because he endeavoured to account for the wonderful effects in nature by the influences of the celestial bodies, not attributing them to angels or demons; so that heresy, rather than magic, in the form of opposition to the doctrine of spiritual beings, seems to have led to his persecution. To quote Barrett:

<text>Rachel Louise Carson (May 27, 1907 – April 14, 1964) was an American marine biologist, writer, and conservationist whose sea trilogy (1941–1955) and book &quot;Silent Spring&quot; (1962) are credited with advancing marine conservation and the global environmental movement.

Carson began her career as an aquatic biologist in the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, and became a full-time nature writer in the 1950s. Her widely praised 1951 bestseller &quot;The Sea Around Us&quot; won her a U.S. National Book Award, recognition as a gifted writer and financial security. Its success prompted the republication of her first book, &quot;Under the Sea Wind&quot; (1941), in 1952, which was followed by &quot;The Edge of the Sea &quot; in 1955 — both were also bestsellers. This sea trilogy explores the whole of ocean life from the shores to the depths.

Late in the 1950s, Carson turned her attention to conservation, especially some problems she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was the book &quot;Silent Spring&quot; (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although &quot;Silent Spring&quot; was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, which led to a nationwide ban on DDT and other pesticides. It also inspired a grassroots environmental movement that led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Jimmy Carter.

== Early life and education ==

Carson was born on May 27, 1907, on a family farm near Springdale, Pennsylvania, located by the Allegheny River near Pittsburgh. She was the daughter of Maria Frazier (McLean) and Robert Warden Carson, an insurance salesman. She spent a lot of time exploring around her family&#x27;s farm. An avid reader, she began writing stories, often involving animals, at age eight. At age ten, she had her first story published. She enjoyed reading &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot;, which carried her first published stories, the works of Beatrix Potter, the novels of Gene Stratton-Porter, and in her teen years, Herman Melville, Joseph Conrad, and Robert Louis Stevenson. The natural world, particularly that of the ocean, was the common thread of her favorite literature. Carson attended Springdale&#x27;s small school through tenth grade, and then completed high school in nearby Parnassus, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1925 at the top of her class of 44 students. In high school, Carson was said to have been somewhat of a loner.

Carson gained admission to Pennsylvania College for Women, now Chatham University, in Pittsburgh, where she originally studied English but switched her major to biology in January 1928. She continued contributing to the school&#x27;s student newspaper and literary supplement.

She was admitted to graduate school at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1928, but was forced to remain at the Pennsylvania College for Women for her senior year due to financial difficulties; she graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1929. After a summer course at the Marine Biological Laboratory, she continued her studies in zoology and genetics at Johns Hopkins in the fall of 1929. After her first year of graduate school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in Raymond Pearl&#x27;s laboratory, where she worked with rats and &quot;Drosophila&quot;, to earn money for tuition. After false starts with pit vipers and squirrels, she completed a dissertation on the embryonic development of the pronephros in fish.

In June 1932, she earned a master&#x27;s degree in zoology. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, however in 1934 Carson was forced to leave Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family during the Great Depression. In 1935, Carson&#x27;s father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging mother.

==Career==
At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, Carson secured a temporary position with the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, where she wrote radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts called &quot;Romance Under the Waters&quot;. The series of 52 seven-minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and the bureau&#x27;s work, a task that several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the Chesapeake Bay, based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.

Carson&#x27;s supervisor, pleased with the success of the radio series, asked her to write the introduction to a public brochure about the fisheries bureau; he also worked to secure her the first full-time position that became available. Sitting for the civil service exam, she outscored all other applicants and, in 1936, became the second woman hired by the Bureau of Fisheries for a full-time professional position, as a junior aquatic biologist.

Using her research and consultations with marine biologists as starting points, she wrote a steady stream of articles for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; and other newspapers. However, her family responsibilities further increased in January 1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner for her mother and two nieces.

In July 1937, the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; accepted a revised version of an essay, &quot;The World of Waters&quot;, that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay, published as &quot;Undersea&quot;, was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson&#x27;s writing career. Publishing house Simon &amp; Schuster, impressed by &quot;Undersea&quot;, contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in &quot;Under the Sea Wind&quot; (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson&#x27;s article-writing success continued with her features appearing in &quot;Sun Magazine&quot;, &quot;Nature&quot;, and &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. Carson attempted to leave the Bureau (by then transformed into the United States Fish and Wildlife Service) in 1945. However, few jobs for naturalists were available, since most money for science was focused on technical fields in the wake of the Manhattan Project.

In mid-1945, Carson first encountered the subject of DDT, a revolutionary new pesticide—lauded as the &quot;insect bomb&quot; after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki—that was only beginning to undergo tests for safety and ecological effects. DDT was one of Carson&#x27;s many writing interests at the time, but editors found the subject unappealing; she published nothing on DDT until 1962.

Carson rose within the Fish and Wildlife Service, and in 1945 was supervising a small writing staff. In 1949, she was appointed chief editor of publications, which allowed her increased opportunities for fieldwork and freedom in choosing her writing projects; however, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, Carson was working on material for a second book and decided to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, Marie Rodell; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson&#x27;s career.

Oxford University Press expressed interest in Carson&#x27;s book proposal for a life history of the ocean, spurring her to complete by early 1950 the manuscript of what would become &quot;The Sea Around Us&quot;. Chapters appeared in &quot;Science Digest&quot; and &quot;The Yale Review&quot;, which published a chapter, &quot;The Birth of an Island,&quot; which won the American Association for the Advancement of Science&#x27;s George Westinghouse Science Writing Prize. Beginning in June 1951, nine chapters were serialized in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

On July 2, 1951, the book was published by Oxford University Press. &quot;The Sea Around Us&quot; remained on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Bestseller List for 86 weeks, was abridged by &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, won the 1952 National Book Award for Nonfiction and the John Burroughs Medal, and resulted in Carson being awarded two honorary doctorates. She licensed a documentary film based on it, &quot;The Sea&quot;, whose success led to republication of &quot;Under the Sea Wind&quot;, which became a bestseller. With success, came financial security; in 1952, Carson was able to give up her job in order to concentrate on writing full-time.

Carson was inundated with requests for speaking engagements, fan mail and other correspondence regarding &quot;The Sea Around Us&quot;, along with work on the script that she had secured the right to review. She was very unhappy with the final version of the script by writer, director, and producer Irwin Allen; she found it untrue to the atmosphere of the book and scientifically embarrassing, describing it as &quot;a cross between a believe-it-or-not and a breezy travelogue.&quot; However, she discovered that her right to review the script did not extend to any control over its content. This led to many scientific inconsistencies inside the film. Despite Carson&#x27;s requests to resolve these problems, Allen went forward with the script. He succeeded in producing a very successful documentary. It went on to win the 1953 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. However, Carson was so embittered by the experience that she never again sold film rights to her work.

===Relationship with Dorothy Freeman===
Carson met Dorothy M. Freeman in the summer of 1953 on Southport Island, Maine. Freeman had written to Carson welcoming her to the area when she had heard that the famous author was to become her neighbor. It was the beginning of a devoted friendship that lasted the rest of Carson&#x27;s life. Their relationship was conducted mainly through letters and during summers spent together in Maine. Over 12 years, they exchanged around 900 letters. Many of these were published in the book &quot;Always, Rachel&quot;, published in 1995 by Beacon Press.

Carson&#x27;s biographer, Linda J. Lear, writes that &quot;Carson sorely needed a devoted friend and kindred spirit who would listen to her without advising and accept her wholly, the writer as well as the woman.&quot; She found this in Freeman. The two women had common interests, nature chief among them, and began exchanging letters regularly while apart. They shared summers for the remainder of Carson&#x27;s life and met whenever else their schedules permitted.

Concerning the depth of their relationship, commentators have said: &quot;the expression of their love was limited almost wholly to letters and very occasional farewell kisses or holding of hands&quot;. Freeman shared parts of Carson&#x27;s letters with her husband to help him understand the relationship, but much of their correspondence was carefully guarded. Some believe Freeman and Carson&#x27;s relationship was romantic in nature. One of the letters from Carson to Freeman reads: &quot;But, oh darling, I want to be with you so terribly that it hurts!&quot;, while in another, Freeman writes: &quot;I love you beyond expression... My love is boundless as the Sea.&quot; Carson&#x27;s last letter to Freeman before her death ends with: &quot;Never forget, dear one, how deeply I have loved you all these years.&quot;

Shortly before Carson&#x27;s death, she and Freeman destroyed hundreds of letters. The surviving correspondence was published in 1995 as &quot;Always, Rachel: The Letters of Rachel Carson and Dorothy Freeman, 1952–1964: An Intimate Portrait of a Remarkable Friendship&quot;, edited by Martha Freeman, Dorothy&#x27;s granddaughter, who wrote at publication: &quot;A few comments in early letters indicate that Rachel and Dorothy were initially cautious about the romantic tone and terminology of their correspondence. I believe this caution prompted their destruction of some letters within the first two years of their friendship...&quot; According to one reviewer, the pair &quot;fit Carolyn Heilbrun&#x27;s characterization of a strong female friendship, where what matters is &#x27;not whether friends are homosexual or heterosexual, lovers or not, but whether they share the wonderful energy of work in the public sphere.&#x27;&quot;

According to her biographer, Linda Lear, there was a disagreement about the final arrangements for Rachel. Her brother, Robert Carson, insisted that her cremated remains be buried beside their mother in Maryland. This was against her wishes to be buried in Maine. In the end, a compromise was reached. Carson&#x27;s wishes were carried out by an organizing committee, including her agent (Marie Rodell), her editor (Paul Brooks), and Dorothy Freeman. In the spring of 1964, Dorothy received half of Rachel&#x27;s ashes in the mail sent to her by Robert Carson. In the summer of that year, Dorothy carried out Rachel&#x27;s final wishes, scattering her ashes along the rocky shores of Sheepscot Bay in Maine.

=== &quot;The Edge of the Sea&quot; and transition to conservation work ===
Early in 1953, Carson began library and field research on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore. In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, &quot;The Edge of the Sea&quot;, which focuses on life in coastal ecosystems, particularly along the Eastern Seaboard. It appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson&#x27;s reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; &quot;The Edge of the Sea&quot; received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for &quot;The Sea Around Us&quot;.

Through 1955 and 1956, Carson worked on several projects—including the script for an &quot;Omnibus&quot; episode, &quot;Something About the Sky&quot;—and wrote articles for popular magazines. Her plan for the next book was to address evolution. However, the publication of Julian Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Evolution in Action&quot;—and her own difficulty in finding a clear and compelling approach to the topic—led her to abandon the project. Instead, her interests were turning to conservation. She considered an environment-themed book project tentatively titled &quot;Remembrance of the Earth&quot; and became involved with The Nature Conservancy and other conservation groups. She also made plans to buy and preserve from development an area in Maine she and Freeman called the &quot;Lost Woods.&quot;

In early 1957, a family tragedy struck for the third time when one of her nieces she had cared for since the 1940s died at the age of 31, leaving her 5-year-old son, Roger Christie, an orphan. Carson took on the responsibility for Roger when she adopted him, along with caring for her aging mother. Carson moved to Silver Spring, Maryland to care for Roger and spent much of 1957 putting together a new living situation and studying specific environmental threats.

By late 1957, Carson was closely following federal proposals for widespread pesticide spraying; the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) planned to eradicate fire ants. Other spraying programs involving chlorinated hydrocarbons and organophosphates were on the rise. For the rest of her life, Carson&#x27;s main professional focus would be the dangers of pesticide overuse.

===&quot;Silent Spring&quot;===

&quot;Silent Spring&quot;, Carson&#x27;s most influential book, was published by Houghton Mifflin on September 27, 1962. The book described the harmful effects of pesticides on the environment, and is widely credited with helping launch the environmental movement. Carson was not the first or the only person to raise concern about DDT, but her combination of &quot;scientific knowledge and poetic writing&quot; reached a broad audience and helped to focus opposition to DDT use. In 1994, an edition of &quot;Silent Spring&quot; was published with an introduction written by Vice President Al Gore. In 2012 &quot;Silent Spring &quot;was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society for its role in the development of the modern environmental movement.

====Research and writing====

Starting in the mid-1940s, Carson had become concerned about the use of synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the military funding of science since World War II. However, the United States federal government&#x27;s 1957 gypsy moth, now called spongy moth, eradication program prompted Carson to devote her research and her next book to pesticides and environmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides mixed with fuel oil, including the spraying of private land. Landowners on Long Island filed a lawsuit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the Supreme Court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.

The Audubon Naturalist Society also actively opposed such spraying programs and recruited Carson to help make public the government&#x27;s exact spraying practices and the related research. Carson began the four-year project of what would become &quot;Silent Spring&quot; by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause, such as essayist E. B. White and several journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with &quot;Newsweek&quot; science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when &quot;The New Yorker&quot; commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon, it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of &quot;Silent Spring&quot;).

As her research progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and environmental effects of pesticides. She also took advantage of her connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps when it came to pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as biological pest control.

She also found significant support and extensive evidence from a group of biodynamic agriculture organic market gardeners, their adviser, Dr. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, other contacts, and their suite of legal actions (1957–1960) against the U.S. Government. According to recent research by Paull (2013), this may have been the primary and (for strategic reasons) uncredited source for Carson&#x27;s book. Marjorie Spock and Mary T. Richards of Long Island, New York, contested the aerial spraying of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). They compiled their evidence and shared it with Carson, who used it, their extensive contacts, and the trial transcripts as a primary input for &quot;Silent Spring&quot;. Carson wrote of the content as &quot;a gold mine of information&quot; and says, &quot;I feel guilty about the mass of your material I have here&quot; and makes multiple references to Pfeiffer and his correspondence.

By 1959, the USDA&#x27;s Agricultural Research Service responded to the criticism by Carson and others with a public service film, &quot;Fire Ant on Trial&quot;; Carson characterized it as &quot;flagrant propaganda&quot; that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides (especially dieldrin and heptachlor) posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, that attributed the recent decline in bird populations—in her words, the &quot;silencing of birds&quot;—to pesticide overuse. That was also the year of the &quot;Great Cranberry Scandal&quot;: the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of U.S. cranberries were found to contain high levels of the herbicide aminotriazole (which caused cancer in laboratory rats), and the sale of all cranberry products was halted. Carson attended the subsequent FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she came away discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying. She also wondered about the possible &quot;financial inducements behind certain pesticide programs.&quot;

Research at the Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health brought Carson into contact with medical researchers investigating the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance was the work of National Cancer Institute researcher and environmental cancer section founding director Wilhelm Hueper, who classified many pesticides as carcinogens. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson, the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide carcinogenesis.

By 1960, Carson had more than enough research material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of &quot;Silent Spring&quot;. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a mastectomy. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December, Carson discovered that the tumor was malignant and the cancer had metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of &quot;The Sea Around Us&quot; and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing was done by the fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological pest controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962. While writing the book, Carson chose to hide her illness so that the pesticide companies could not use it against her (she worried that if the companies knew, they would use it as ammunition to make her book look untrustworthy and biased).

Finding a title for the book proved difficult; &quot;Silent Spring&quot; was initially suggested as a title for the chapter on birds. By August 1961, Carson finally agreed to the suggestion of her literary agent Marie Rodell: &quot;Silent Spring&quot; would be a metaphorical title for the entire book, suggesting a bleak future for the whole natural world, rather than a single chapter title about the literal absence of birdsong. With Carson&#x27;s approval, editor Paul Brooks at Houghton Mifflin arranged for illustrations by Louis and Lois Darling, who also designed the cover. The final writing was the first chapter, &quot;A Fable for Tomorrow&quot;, which Carson intended as a gentle introduction to what might otherwise be a forbiddingly serious topic. By mid-1962, Brooks and Carson had essentially finished the editing and were laying the groundwork for promoting the book by sending the manuscript out to select individuals for final suggestions.

====Content====
Biographer Mark Hamilton Lytle writes that Carson &quot;quite self-consciously decided to write a book calling into question the paradigm of scientific progress that defined post-war American culture.&quot; The overriding theme of &quot;Silent Spring&quot; is the powerful—and often adverse—effect humans have on the natural world.

Carson&#x27;s main argument is that pesticides have detrimental effects on the environment; they are more properly termed &quot;biocides&quot;, she argues, because their effects are rarely limited to the target pests. DDT is a prime example, but other synthetic pesticides come under scrutiny, many of which are subject to bioaccumulation. Carson also accuses the chemical industry of intentionally spreading disinformation and public officials of accepting industry claims uncritically. Most of the book is devoted to pesticides&#x27; effects on natural ecosystems. However, four chapters also detail cases of human pesticide poisoning, cancer, and other illnesses attributed to pesticides. Regarding DDT and cancer, the subject of so much subsequent debate, Carson only briefly mentions the topic:
Carson predicted increased consequences in the future, especially as targeted pests develop pesticide resistance. At the same time, weakened ecosystems fall prey to unanticipated invasive species. The book closes with a call for a biotic approach to pest control as an alternative to chemical pesticides.

Regarding DDT, Carson never called for an outright ban. Part of the argument she made in &quot;Silent Spring&quot; was that even if DDT and other insecticides had no environmental side effects, their indiscriminate overuse was counter-productive because it would create insect resistance, making them useless in eliminating the target insect populations:

Carson further noted that &quot;Malaria programmes are threatened by resistance among mosquitoes&quot; and emphasized the advice given by the director of Holland&#x27;s Plant Protection Service: &quot;Practical advice should be &#x27;Spray as little as you possibly can&#x27; rather than &#x27;Spray to the limit of your capacity&#x27; ... Pressure on the pest population should always be as slight as possible.&quot;

====Promotion and reception====
Carson and the others involved with the publication of &quot;Silent Spring&quot; expected fierce criticism. They were particularly concerned about the possibility of being sued for libel. Carson was also undergoing radiation therapy to combat her spreading cancer and expected to have little energy to devote to defending her work and responding to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book&#x27;s release.

Most of the book&#x27;s scientific chapters were reviewed by scientists with relevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support. Carson attended the White House Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of &quot;Silent Spring&quot; to many of the delegates and promoted the upcoming &quot;New Yorker&quot; serialization. Among many others, Carson also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas, a longtime environmental advocate who had argued against the court&#x27;s rejection of the Long Island pesticide spraying case (and who had provided Carson with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides).

Though &quot;Silent Spring&quot; had generated a relatively high level of interest based on pre-publication promotion, this became much more intense with the serialization in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, which began on June 16, 1962, issue. This brought the book to the attention of the chemical industry and its lobbyists and a wide swath of the American populace. Around that time, Carson also learned that &quot;Silent Spring&quot; had been selected as the Book of the Month for October; as she put it, this would &quot;carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don&#x27;t know what a bookstore looks like—much less &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.&quot; Other publicity included a positive editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and excerpts of the serialized version in &quot;Audubon&quot; magazine, with another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The story of the birth defect-causing drug thalidomide broke just before the book&#x27;s publication as well, inviting comparisons between Carson and Frances Oldham Kelsey, the Food and Drug Administration reviewer who had blocked the drug&#x27;s sale in the United States.

Following the publication of &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, Carson as a woman in science faced personal attacks. In the Introduction of &quot;Silent Spring&quot; written by her biographer, Linda Lear, she describes how critics sought to undermine Carson&#x27;s arguments by calling her a &quot;bird and bunny lover.&quot; In the eyes of the chemical industry, Carson was a &quot;woman out of control,&quot; going outside the bounds of her gender by making claims about an industry within the scientific community.
In the weeks leading up to the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong opposition to &quot;Silent Spring&quot; from the chemical industry. DuPont (a high market-share manufacturer of DDT and 2,4-D) and Velsicol Chemical Corporation (exclusive manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor) were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book&#x27;s press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;Audubon&quot; unless the planned &quot;Silent Spring&quot; features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson&#x27;s and the publishers&#x27; lawyers were confident in the vetting process &quot;Silent Spring&quot; had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).

American Cyanamid biochemist Robert White-Stevens and former Cyanamid chemist Thomas Jukes were among the most aggressive critics, especially of Carson&#x27;s analysis of DDT. According to White-Stevens, &quot;If man were to follow the teachings of Miss Carson, we would return to the Dark Ages, and the insects and diseases and vermin would once again inherit the earth.&quot; Others went further, attacking Carson&#x27;s scientific credentials (because her training was in marine biology rather than biochemistry) and her character. White-Stevens labeled her &quot;...a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature,&quot; while former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson, in a letter to former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, reportedly concluded that because she was unmarried despite being physically attractive, she was &quot;probably a Communist.&quot;

Many critics repeatedly asserted that she was calling for the elimination of all pesticides. However, Carson had made it clear she was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals&#x27; impact on the entire ecosystem. In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in &quot;Silent Spring&quot; not by urging a total ban but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.

The academic community, including prominent defenders such as H. J. Muller, Loren Eiseley, Clarence Cottam, and Frank Egler, by and large, backed the book&#x27;s scientific claims; public opinion soon turned Carson&#x27;s way as well. The chemical industry campaign backfired, as the controversy greatly increased public awareness of potential pesticide dangers, as well as &quot;Silent Spring&quot; book sales. Pesticide use became a major public issue, especially after the &quot;CBS Reports&quot; TV special &quot;The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson&quot; that aired April 3, 1963. The program included segments of Carson reading from &quot;Silent Spring&quot; and interviews with several other experts, mostly critics (including White-Stevens); according to biographer Linda Lear, &quot;in juxtaposition to the wild-eyed, loud-voiced Dr. Robert White-Stevens in white lab coat, Carson appeared anything but the hysterical alarmist that her critics contended.&quot; Reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive, and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide dangers and the public release of a pesticide report by the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee. Within a year or so of publication, the attacks on the book and Carson had largely lost momentum.

In one of her last public appearances, Carson testified before President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee. The committee issued its report on May 15, 1963, largely backing Carson&#x27;s scientific claims. Following the report&#x27;s release, she also testified before a United States Senate subcommittee to make policy recommendations. Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, she could not accept the great majority of them. Her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation therapy, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she was physically able, however, including a notable appearance on &quot;The Today Show&quot; and speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the Audubon Medal (from the National Audubon Society), the Cullum Geographical Medal (from the American Geographical Society), and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

==Death==
Weakened from breast cancer and her treatment regimen, Carson became ill with a respiratory virus in January 1964. Her condition worsened, and in February, doctors found that she had severe anemia from her radiation treatments. In March, they discovered that the cancer had reached her liver. She died of a heart attack on April 14, 1964, in her home in Silver Spring, Maryland.

Her body was cremated, and some of her ashes were buried beside her mother at Parklawn Memorial Gardens in Rockville, Maryland. The rest were scattered along the coast of Squirrel Island near Sheepscot River in Maine.

==Legacy==
===Collected papers and posthumous publications===
Carson bequeathed her manuscripts and papers to Yale University to take advantage of the new state-of-the-art preservations facilities of the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library. Her longtime agent and literary executor Marie Rodell spent nearly two years organizing and cataloging Carson&#x27;s papers and correspondence, distributing all the letters to their senders so that only what each correspondent approved would be submitted to the archive.

In 1965, Rodell arranged for the publication of an essay Carson had intended to expand into a book: &quot;The Sense of Wonder&quot;. The essay, which was combined with photographs by Charles Pratt and others, exhorts parents to help their children experience the &quot;...lasting pleasures of contact with the natural world ... available to anyone who will place himself under the influence of earth, sea, and sky and their amazing life.&quot;

In addition to the letters in &quot;Always Rachel&quot;, in 1998, a volume of Carson&#x27;s previously unpublished work was published as &quot;Lost Woods: The Discovered Writing of Rachel Carson&quot;, edited by Linda Lear. All of Carson&#x27;s books remain in print.

===Grassroots environmentalism and the EPA===
Carson&#x27;s work had a powerful impact on the environmental movement. &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, in particular, was a rallying point for the fledgling social movement in the 1960s. According to environmental engineer and Carson scholar H. Patricia Hynes, &quot;&quot;Silent Spring&quot; altered the balance of power in the world. No one since would be able to sell pollution as the necessary underside of progress so easily or uncritically.&quot; Carson&#x27;s work, and the activism it inspired, are at least partly responsible for the deep ecology movement and the overall strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s. It was also influential on the rise of ecofeminism and on many feminist scientists.

While there remains no evidence that Carson was openly a women&#x27;s rights activist, her work and its subsequent criticisms have left an iconic legacy for the ecofeminist movement. Attacks on Carson&#x27;s credibility included criticism of her credentials in which she was labeled an &quot;amateur.&quot; It was said that her writing was too &quot;emotional.&quot; Ecofeminist scholars argue that not only was the dissenting rhetoric gendered to paint Carson as hysterical but was done because her arguments challenged the capitalist production of large agri-business corporations. Others, such as Yaakov Garb, suggest that in addition to not being a women&#x27;s rights activist, Carson also had no anti-capitalist agenda and that such attacks were unwarranted. Additionally, the way photos of Carson were used to portray her are often questioned because of few representations of her engaging in work typical of a scientist, but instead of her leisure activities.

Carson&#x27;s most direct legacy in the environmental movement was the campaign to ban DDT in the United States (and related efforts to ban or limit its use throughout the world). Though environmental concerns about DDT had been considered by government agencies as early as Carson&#x27;s testimony before the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee, the 1967 formation of the Environmental Defense Fund was the first significant milestone in the campaign against DDT. The organization brought lawsuits against the government to &quot;establish a citizen&#x27;s right to a clean environment,&quot; and the arguments employed against DDT largely mirrored Carson&#x27;s. By 1972, the Environmental Defense Fund and other activist groups had succeeded in securing a phase-out of DDT use in the United States (except in emergency cases).

The creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by the Nixon Administration in 1970 addressed another concern that Carson had brought to light. Until then, the same agency (the USDA) was responsible both for regulating pesticides and promoting the concerns of the agriculture industry; Carson saw this as a conflict of interest since the agency was not responsible for effects on wildlife or other environmental concerns beyond farm policy. Fifteen years after its creation, one journalist described the EPA as &quot;the extended shadow of &quot;Silent Spring&quot;.&quot; Much of the agency&#x27;s early work, such as enforcing the 1972 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, was directly related to Carson&#x27;s work.

In the 1980s, the policies of the Reagan Administration emphasized economic growth, rolling back many of the environmental policies adopted in response to Carson and her work.

===Posthumous honors===
Various groups ranging from government institutions to environmental and conservation organizations to scholarly societies have celebrated Carson&#x27;s life and work since her death. Perhaps most significantly, on June 9, 1980, Carson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. A 17¢ Great Americans series postage stamp was issued in her honor the following year; several other countries have since issued Carson postage as well. In 1973, Carson was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

The University of California, Santa Cruz, named one of its colleges, formerly known as College Eight, Rachel Carson College in 2016. Rachel Carson College is the first college at the university to bear a woman&#x27;s name.

Munich&#x27;s Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society was founded in 2009. An international, interdisciplinary center for research and education in the environmental humanities and social sciences, it was established as a joint initiative of Munich&#x27;s Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität and the Deutsches Museum, with the support of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.

Carson&#x27;s birthplace and childhood home in Springdale, Pennsylvania, now known as the Rachel Carson Homestead, became a National Register of Historic Places site and the nonprofit Rachel Carson Homestead Association was created in 1975 to manage it. Her home in Colesville, Maryland, where she wrote &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, was named a National Historic Landmark in 1991. Near Pittsburgh, a hiking trail, the Rachel Carson Trail and maintained by the Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy, was dedicated to Carson in 1975. A Pittsburgh bridge was renamed in Carson&#x27;s honor as the Rachel Carson Bridge. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection State Office Building in Harrisburg is named in her honor.

Elementary schools in Gaithersburg, Maryland, Sammamish, Washington and San Jose, California middle schools in Beaverton, Oregon Queens, New York City, Rachel Carson Intermediate School, in Herndon, Virginia, Rachel Carson Middle School, and a high school in Brooklyn, New York City were all named in her honor.

Two research vessels have sailed in the United States bearing the name R/V &quot;Rachel Carson&quot;. One is on the west coast, owned by Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), and the other is on the east coast, operated by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. Another vessel of the name, now scrapped, was a former naval vessel obtained and converted by the United States EPA. It operated on the Great Lakes. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary also operates a mooring buoy maintenance vessel named the Rachel Carson.

The ceremonial auditorium on the third floor of EPA headquarters, the William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building, is named after Carson. The Rachel Carson Room is close to the EPA Administrator&#x27;s office. It has been the site of numerous important announcements, including the Clean Air Interstate Rule.

A number of conservation areas have been named for Carson as well. Between 1964 and 1990, 650 acres (263 ha) near Brookeville in Montgomery County, Maryland were acquired and set aside as the Rachel Carson Conservation Park, administered by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission. In 1969, the Coastal Maine National Wildlife Refuge became the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge; expansions will bring the size of the refuge to about 9,125 acres (3,693 ha). In 1985, North Carolina renamed one of its estuarine reserves in honor of Carson, in Beaufort.

Carson is also a frequent namesake for prizes awarded by philanthropic, educational and scholarly institutions. The Rachel Carson Prize, founded in Stavanger, Norway in 1991, is awarded to women who have made a contribution in the field of environmental protection. The American Society for Environmental History has awarded the Rachel Carson Prize for Best Dissertation since 1993. Since 1998, the Society for Social Studies of Science has awarded an annual Rachel Carson Book Prize for &quot;a book length work of social or political relevance in the area of science and technology studies.&quot; The Society of Environmental Journalists gives an annual award and two honourable mentions for books on environmental issues in Carson&#x27;s name, such as was awarded to Joe Roman&#x27;s &quot;&quot; in 2012. The Sierra Club and its foundation recognize donors who have provided for the club in their estate plans as the Rachel Carson Society. The Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (Germany) awards post-doctoral fellowships in the area of the environment and society.

The &quot;Rachel Carson&quot; sculpture in Woods Hole, Massachusetts was unveiled on July 14, 2013. Google created a Google Doodle for Carson&#x27;s 107th birthday on May 27, 2014. Carson was featured during the &quot;HerStory&quot; video tribute to notable women on U2&#x27;s tour in 2017 for the 30th anniversary of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; during a performance of &quot;Ultraviolet (Light My Way)&quot; from the band&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;.

====Centennial events====
The centennial of Carson&#x27;s birth occurred in 2007. On Earth Day (April 22), &quot;Courage for the Earth: Writers, Scientists, and Activists Celebrate the Life and Writing of Rachel Carson&quot; released as &quot;a centennial appreciation of Rachel Carson&#x27;s brave life and transformative writing.&quot; It included 13 essays by environmental writers and scientists.

Democratic Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland had intended to submit a resolution celebrating Carson for her &quot;legacy of scientific rigor coupled with poetic sensibility&quot; on the 100th anniversary of her birth. The resolution was blocked by Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.

On May 27, 2007, the Rachel Carson Homestead Association held a birthday party and sustainable feast at her birthplace and home in Springdale, Pennsylvania, and the first Rachel Carson Legacy Conference in Pittsburgh with E. O. Wilson as keynote speaker. Both Rachel&#x27;s Sustainable Feast and the conference continue as annual events.

Also in 2007, American author Ginger Wadsworth wrote a biography of Carson.

<doc id="81275" wikidata="Q35390" url="?curid=81275" title="Asturleonese language">
<text>Asturleonese is a Romance language or language family spoken in northwestern Spain and northeastern Portugal, namely in the historical regions and Spain&#x27;s modern-day autonomous communities of Asturias, northwestern Castile and León, Cantabria and Extremadura, and in Riudenore and Tierra de Miranda in Portugal. The name of the language is largely uncommon among its native speakers, as it forms a dialect continuum of mutually intelligible varieties and therefore it is primarily referred to by various regional glossonyms like &quot;Leonese&quot;, &quot;Cantabrian&quot;, &quot;Asturian&quot; or &quot;Mirandese&quot; (in Portugal). Extremaduran is sometimes included as well. Asturleonese has been classified by UNESCO as an endangered language, as the varieties are being increasingly replaced by Spanish and Portuguese.

Phylogenetically, Asturleonese belongs to the West Iberian branch of the Romance languages that gradually developed from Vulgar Latin in the old Kingdom of León. The Asturleonese group is typically subdivided into three linguistic areas (Western, Central and Eastern) that form the vertical Asturleonese region, from Asturias, through León, to the north of Portugal and Extremadura. The &quot;Cantabrian Montañes&quot; in the East and &quot;Extremaduran&quot; in the South have transitional traits with Spanish (northern Spanish for Cantabrian, southern Spanish for Extremaduran). There are differing degrees of vitality of the language for each region in the area: Asturias and Miranda do Douro have historically been the regions in which Asturleonese has been the best preserved.

Leonese (used interchangeably with &quot;Asturleonese&quot;) was once regarded as an informal dialect (basilect) that developed from Castilian Spanish, but in 1906, Ramón Menéndez Pidal showed it developed from Latin independently, coming into its earliest distinguishable form in the old Kingdom of León. As is noted by the Spanish scholar Inés Fernández Ordóñez, Menéndez Pidal always maintained that the Spanish language (or the common Spanish language, &quot;la lengua común española&quot;, as he sometimes called it) evolved from a Castilian base which would have absorbed, or merged with, Leonese and Aragonese. In his works &quot;Historia de la Lengua Española&quot; (&#x27;History of the Spanish language&#x27;) and especially &quot;El español en sus primeros tiempos&quot; (&#x27;Spanish in its early times&#x27;), Menéndez Pidal explains the stages of this process, taking into account the influence Leonese and Aragonese had on the beginnings of modern Spanish.

== History ==
The Asturleonese language originated from Latin, which began to be transmitted through the Roman legions in Asturica Augusta as well as the Roman Sixth (Hispanian) Legion. The adoption of Latin by the Astures, who inhabited the area, was a slow but inevitable process, as the use of the colonial language was the key to obtaining equal rights; the most important priority, at the time, being to earn Roman citizenship. However, like the rest of the peninsula, it was not until the establishment of the Germanic kingdoms of Iberia that Latin came to be the commonly spoken language of the area.

Along with many linguistic similarities to Latin, the Asturian language also has distinct characteristics that can be linked back to the Cantabrian Wars, a conflict in which the former inhabitants of Leon and Asturias fought against the incorporation of the Roman culture. These two linguistic influences, together with the expansion and the subsequent regression of vernacular languages, would determine the linguistic evolution in the northwestern part of the peninsula. The vocabulary of Asturleonese contains pre-romanic elements that survived the later romanization of the area, as well as including pre-Indoeuropean elements that were only maintained through toponymy.

== Diglossia ==
For a long time, during the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries, Latin and Asturleonese (during its Old Leonese form) co-existed within a diglossic relationship. During this time, Asturleonese was used in official documents and held a high legal status, a status that would drastically change within the following centuries. In the period of time between the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries, many linguistic dialects were marginalized within the Iberian Peninsula as well as other parts of Europe. Because of this, many linguistic dialects and minorities were marginalized, making it difficult for some languages, such as Asturleonese, to survive, and resulted in the fragmentation of others.

During the nineteenth century, the Asturian territories were included as part of the Spanish circle. During this time, Spanish thrived as a language of prestige and culture, which led to its progressively replacing Asturleonese in these areas, as well as with Galician in neighboring Galicia, leaving it to mainly oral usage. Consequently, there existed, and still exists, a distinct divide between the spoken languages of Spanish and Asturian and the written ones.

This being said, diglossia exists today within the region of Asturias. While Spanish is the official language, being used in the government and political spheres, the Asturian language survives as the language mainly used in informal and casual conversation in many rural areas within this community. Additionally, the language is often offered as an elective subject in schools throughout the linguistic region. 

== Legal status ==
Asturleonese only recently received recognition in the municipality of Miranda do Douro by virtue of Portuguese law 7/99 on 29 January 1999, although merely as a language that should continue to be protected and preserved, not awarding it any official status. Meanwhile, Catalan, Basque, and Galician were all granted official status in their respective regions in 1978. Therefore, there exists some tension, as Asturleonese is still not regarded as an official language today. However, the language is optional at school, where it is widely studied.

The Spanish Constitution recognizes the existence of vehicular languages and the need for the protection of existing dialects within the national territories. In article 3.3 of the constitution, the document concretely states that &quot;the richness of the distinct linguistic modalities of Spain is a cultural heritage that will be the subject of special respect and protection.&quot; Additionally, article 4 of the Asturian Statute of Autonomy states that, &quot;The Asturian language will enjoy protection. Its use, teaching and diffusion in the media will be furthered, whilst its local dialects and voluntary apprenticeship will always be respected.&quot; In light of these stated provisions of the 1/1998, on the 23 March, the Use and Promotion of the Asturleonese Language serves this purpose; promoting the use of the language, its knowledge within the educational system, as well as its dissemination in media. However, Asturleonese continues to have a very limited presence in the public administration.

In Portugal, the related Mirandese dialect is recognized by the Assembly of the Republic as a co-official language along with Portuguese for local matters, and it is taught in public schools in the few areas where Mirandese is natively spoken. Initially thought to be a basilect of Portuguese, José Leite de Vasconcelos studied Mirandese and concluded it was a separate language from Portuguese.

== Geographic distribution ==

Linguistically, it is considered that within the dominion of Asturleonese, the known dialects such as Leonese, Asturian, or Mirandese form a macrolanguage. A macrolanguage is a language that exists as distinct linguistic varieties. Within this macrolanguage, the Western and Eastern dialects share some linguistic characteristics with Galaicoportuguese and Spanish respectively.

The boundaries of the Asturleonese language extend through Asturias, Leon, Zamora, and Miranda do Douro. However, the language is not just the sum of Asturian, Leonese, Zamorano, and Mirandan dialects; in purely linguistic terms, the main divisions of Asturleonese have north-south boundaries and form three separate sections that are shared between Asturias and Leon: occidental, central, and oriental. Only through a second level of analysis were smaller sections able to be distinguished. The political and administrative entities and linguistic spaces rarely coincide, as it is most common that languages go beyond borders and do not coincide with them.

== Usage of glossonyms ==
Given the low social and political acceptance of referring to the language in Asturias as &quot;Leonese&quot;, and in other parts of the domain (such as León or Zamora) as &quot;Asturian&quot; (even though it is virtually the same language), a significant part of the authors and specialists prefer to refer to all the dialects collectively as &quot;Asturllionés or Asturleonés&quot;, although others continue to use the regional terms (like Leonese, Asturian, Mirandese, etc.).

===Asturian (&quot;Asturianu&quot;)===

Much effort has been made since 1974 to protect and promote Asturian. In 1981 Asturian, or &quot;Bable&quot;, as the language is officially named, was recognized as a language in need of special protection by the local government. In 1994 there were 100,000 first language speakers and 450,000 second language speakers able to speak or understand Asturian. However, the outlook for Asturian remains critical, with a large decline in the number of speakers in the last 100 years. At the end of the 20th century, the Academia de la Llingua Asturiana undertook initiatives designed to provide the language with most of the tools needed to survive in the modern era: a grammar, a dictionary and periodicals. A new generation of Asturian writers has championed the language. These developments have given Asturian greater hope of survival.

===Leonese (&quot;Llionés&quot;)===

Leonese was probably spoken in a much larger area in the Middle Ages, roughly corresponding to the old Kingdom of León. As the Castilian language became the main language in Spain, the linguistic features of the Leonese language retreated progressively westwards. In the late 1990s several associations unofficially promoted Leonese language courses. In 2001 the &quot;Universidad de León&quot; (University of León) created a course for Leonese teachers, and local and provincial governments developed Leonese language courses for adults. Nowadays Leonese can be studied in the largest towns of León, Zamora and Salamanca provinces.

Leonese&#x27;s desperate reality as a minority language has driven it to an apparent dead end, and it is considered a Seriously Endangered Language by UNESCO. There are some efforts at language revival aimed at the urban population (the Leonese Council has made campaign to encourage young people to learn Leonese). Some experts think Leonese will be dead in two generations.

In spite of all these difficulties, the number of young people learning and using Leonese (mainly as a written language) has increased substantially in recent years. The Leonese City Council promotes Leonese language courses for adults. Leonese is taught in sixteen schools in Leon.

Leonese has special status in the Statute of Autonomy of Castile and León.

===Mirandese (&quot;Mirandés&quot;)===

In the 19th century, José Leite de Vasconcelos described Mirandese as &quot;the language of the farms, work, home, and love between the Mirandese,&quot; noting that it was a fully separate language from Portuguese. Since 1986/87 the language has been taught to students, now being taught from 1st to 12th grade. Today Mirandese has only 3500 speakers.

Portugal took a further step in protecting Mirandese when the Portuguese Republic officially recognised the language in 1999. It is administered by the Anstituto de la Lhéngua Mirandesa.

== Number of speakers ==
There is no known, exact number of Asturleonese speakers, as not enough statistical research has been conducted in this area and many dialects are not accounted for due to their close similarities with Spanish. It is believed that there are over 100,000 Asturian speakers within Spain and Portugal. However, a study conducted in 1991 on the specific Asturian dialect, showed that there could be as many as 450,000 speakers within the Asturias region, with about 60,000 to 80,000 able to read and write the language. The same study indicated that another 24 percent of the population could understand Asturian. This also explains the diverse range of knowledge and familiarity that those within the region have of the Asturleonese language, as there exist some speakers, some who can only understand the language, and a very small portion of the population who are able to read and write.

<text>Racing Club de Ferrol, commonly known as Racing de Ferrol, is a Spanish football team based in Ferrol, Province of A Coruña, in the autonomous community of Galicia.

Founded in 1919, the club currently plays in , holding home games at &quot;Estadio da Malata&quot;. Club colours are green shirts with white shorts, though during the early years of its existence green and white shirts with vertical stripes were used.

Although Racing has never played in Spain&#x27;s top division of La Liga, the club has spent many years in the second tier before being in the third tier more recently. Racing holds the record for most seasons in the second tier without making La Liga (35).

==History==
The history of football in Ferrol is associated with the shipbuilding yards, workshops, foundries and drydocks and the British technical advisors, hired to work locally who used to play against each-other at first, but later on, local workers and military personnel stationed in Ferrol. The renewal of the shipyards and the creation, in town of the &quot;school of Naval Engineers&quot; meant that from the mid-nineteenth century, a mostly French at first but, latter on mostly British, Engineers and Technicians, a constant influx was developed; bringing to Ferrol not new technologies. From those early years to these days many football clubs came and go over the decades but only one of them actually survived for a considerable time and for that, only as an amalgamation of some other previous teams and this is el Racing de Ferrol.

&quot;Racing Ferrol Football Club,&quot; can trace back its origins back to July 1919, but starting very strongly from the beginning on a massive winning all matches spree that allow the team to play against the best national squads in the country so only ten years after its creation Racing Ferrol Football Club was taking part on its first national championships competition and fluctuating later over the decades between first and second divisions as follows: the second – first presence in 1939–40 – and third divisions. In 1977–78 the Galicians won the inaugural edition of Segunda División B and promoted again, only to be immediately relegated back.

It would not until the year 2000 that Racing would again reach the second level, going on to spend there five of the following six years. In the 2006–07 campaign the club gained promotion to the category in the playoffs, with a 2–1 aggregate win against Alicante CF. In the following season the team finished fourth from the bottom and dropped back to the third division, and to the fourth only two years later. In the 2012–13 campaign, the club achieved promoted to third division. Five years later, the club was relegated to fourth division. But one year later the club achieved promotion back to third division.

In the 2022-23 campaign, Ferrol promoted back to second division after spending 15 years in third and fourth division.

This was an oval-shaped enclosure with a single cantilever stand. In the 1970s, a cover was erected over the popular terrace.

In 1993, the metropolitan area of Ferrol built &quot;Estadio da Malata&quot; to the west of the town, near the valley of Serantes. The total cost of the development was 1700 million pesetas. The first match on the new grounds was played on 18 April 1993, in a 3–2 friendly win over Atlético Madrid B. The official inauguration took place on 29 August, in a triangular tournament featuring the home side and neighbours Celta de Vigo and Deportivo de La Coruña.

<doc id="81277" wikidata="Q903196" url="?curid=81277" title="B. Carroll Reece">
<text>Brazilla Carroll Reece (December 22, 1889 – March 19, 1961) was an American Republican Party politician from Tennessee. He represented eastern Tennessee in the United States House of Representatives for all but six years from 1921 to 1961 and served as the Chair of the Republican National Committee from 1946 to 1948. A conservative, he led the party&#x27;s Old Right wing alongside Robert A. Taft in crusading against interventionism, communism, and the Progressive policies pursued by the Roosevelt and Truman administrations.

From 1953 to 1954, as chairman of the House Select Committee to Investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations and Comparable Organizations, often called the Reece Committee, he led an investigation of Communist activities by non-profit organizations, particularly educational institutions and charitable foundations. The Reece Committee concluded that foundations were actively embroiled in efforts to promote socialist and collectivist ideologies.

==Early life==
Reece was born on a farm near Butler, Tennessee, as one of thirteen children of John Isaac and Sarah Maples Reece. He was named for Brazilla Carroll McBride, an ancestor who served in the War of 1812, but never used his first name. His brother, Raleigh Valentine Reece, was a reporter for the &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot; and the teacher who replaced John Thomas Scopes at Rhea County High School in Dayton, Tennessee following the infamous &quot;Monkey Trial.&quot;

Reece attended Watauga Academy in Butler, Tennessee and Carson-Newman College in Jefferson City, Tennessee. At Carson-Newman he played basketball and football. After graduating from Carson-Newman in 1914 as class valedictorian, he worked as a high school principal for one year, then enrolled in New York University, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in economics and finance in 1916. He also studied at the University of London.

==Career==
He was an assistant secretary and instructor at New York University in 1916 and 1917.

In April, 1917 Reece enlisted for World War I and attended officer training in Plattsburgh, New York. During the war he served initially with the 166th Infantry Regiment, a unit of the 42nd Infantry Division. He later transferred to 102nd Infantry Regiment, 26th Infantry Division. He commanded a company, then commanded the regiment&#x27;s 3rd Battalion, and attained the rank of captain. He was discharged in 1919, and was decorated with the Distinguished Service Cross, Distinguished Service Medal, Purple Heart, and French Croix de Guerre with Palm.

He was director of the School of Business Administration of New York University in 1919 and 1920, and also studied law there.

He then passed the bar exam and opened a successful law practice in Johnson City, where he was also a banker and publisher.

Reece was married to Louise Goff, daughter of United States Senator Guy Despard Goff of West Virginia.

==Congressional service==
Reece served as a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1928, 1932, 1936, 1940, 1944, and 1948. He was a member of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution in 1945 and 1946.

According to a 1981 pamphlet by Stephen Alan Sampson of Anti-Communist Crusade, republished by Liberty University, Reece was a conservative derided by intraparty moderates as an &quot;Old Guard reactionary&quot;.

===Denying renomination of Sam R. Sells and winning election to the U.S. House===
Reece first successfully ran for the House of Representatives in 1920, challenging incumbent Republican Sam R. Sells. Although supporters of Sells initially dismissed Reece&#x27;s candidacy as a joke, the political newcomer ran on his military service as Sells campaigned on his personality rather than his congressional voting record. During the campaign, Reece, who went to all counties in the district, promised to serve only up to ten years, a vow he eventually broke. He also attacked the incumbent Sells, a lumber businessman, for alleged conflicts of interest in voting to &quot;exempt excess profit taxes on corporations,&quot; furthermore stating:
Reece ultimately defeated Sells in an upset to win the GOP nomination and cruise to victory in the general election. He would later recount his first interaction with his predecessor:
The region had voted not to secede at the state convention in 1861. This region was heavily Republican—in fact, Republicans had represented this district for all but four years since 1859, and was one of the few regions in the former Confederacy where Republicans won on a regular basis.

===1920s===
Once in office, Reece established services to help constituents with problems both large and small, a precedent continued by later elected Republicans from Eastern Tennessee. In 1922, Reece joined the majority of his House Republican colleagues in voting for the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill.

====1930 defeat, 1932 comeback====
Following his first election, Reece was re-elected four consecutive times. He lost in the 1930 midterms to Independent Republican Oscar Lovette following backlash from constituents over the George W. Norris Muscle Shoals bill (the Senate version, which is considered a forerunner to the Tennessee Valley Authority) being vetoed by President Herbert Hoover as well as having failed to ensure the Cove Creek Dam being built. Many of Reece&#x27;s constituents turned against him due to his siding with private enterprise in his support of Muscle Shoals development over the government initiative to provide nitrates for farmers, which Lovette emphasized his support for. The incumbent congressman, who President Hoover offered to help in his sinking re-election bid, claimed that the Muscle Shoals bill introduced by Norris which emphasized a larger size and scope of the federal government &quot;originated in Red Russia.&quot;

Reece ran for his old seat in 1932, campaigning in part against the refusal of Lovette to maintain consistent affiliation as a Republican (Lovette ran as an &quot;Independent Republican&quot; in the general election, again). During this period, although he was out of office during the time, his favorability among President Hoover ensured that patronage and significant influence went through his hands rather than Lovette&#x27;s. Reece narrowly re-emerged successfully and defeated Lovette, who in turn claimed voter fraud. An investigation by a House subcommittee uncovered some &quot;questionable&quot; election procedures practices, though Reece was ultimately seated.

However, the landslide defeats the GOP suffered nationally that year would mark the start of solid Democratic control in the federal government as the Great Depression continued. Reece continued being re-elected consecutively until unsuccessfully running for an open Senate seat in 1948; afterwards he returned to the House yet again and continued serving until his death. According to Tennessee historian Ray Hill, a historian who writes for &quot;The Knoxville Focus&quot;:
===Return to the House===
Reece thus returned to Congress, serving until 1947, when he stepped down to devote his full energies to serving as chairman of the Republican National Committee, a position he had held since 1946.

An adamant conservative, Reece generally opposed the New Deal during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt along with Progressive initiatives such as Federal wage and price controls. He was also an isolationist, according to Sampson, and a non-interventionist prior to World War II and voted against the Lend-Lease Act. A supporter of civil rights, he advocated the passage of federal anti-lynching legislation and anti-poll tax measures.

A member of the conservative &quot;Old Guard&quot; faction of the Republican Party, Reece was a strong supporter of Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft, the leader of the GOP&#x27;s conservative wing. In 1948 and 1952 Reece was a leading supporter of Taft&#x27;s candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination; however, Taft lost the nomination both times to moderate Republicans from New York.

Reece was the Republican nominee for an open Senate seat in 1948, but lost to Democratic Congressman Estes Kefauver, who had unseated incumbent Democrat Tom Stewart in the party primary. Kefauver carried the support of the influential editor Edward J. Meeman of the now-defunct &quot;Memphis Press-Scimitar&quot;, who had for years fought to topple the Edward &quot;Boss&quot; Crump political machine in Memphis. Crump supported Stewart.

===Republican Party leadership===
Allied with Ohio senator Taft, who he joined in opposing President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s anti-inflation plan, Reece succeeded Herbert Brownell, Jr. (later United States Attorney General under president Dwight D. Eisenhower), as the chair of the Republican National Committee in early April 1946 and presided over GOP victories in the 1946 midterms. Due to his independent wealth inherited from his father-in-law, Reece did not accept a salary.

During his tenure in leading the GOP on the national stage, Reece was a part of the conservative faction opposed by Minnesota liberal Republican Harold Stassen and Vermont moderate Republican George Aiken. In February 1948, Reece called for purging communists from the United States, asserting:
Reece also opposed President Truman&#x27;s use of &quot;public funds&quot; for his Western trip, calling it a &quot;pre-nomination campaign tour.&quot;

===Defeating Phillips, returning to the U.S. House===
In 1950, Reece ran against the man who succeeded him in the House, Dayton Phillips, and defeated him in the Republican primary. This all but assured him of a return to Congress in the heavily Republican district. He was reelected five more times. When the Republicans gained control of the House after the 1952 elections, Reece served as chairman of the Select Committee to Investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations and Comparable Organizations, losing this post after the Democrats regained control in 1955.

In the 1952 United States presidential election, Reece threw support to Robert A. Taft, who he predicted the GOP delegations in Southern and border states would support. Taft ultimately lost in the Republican primaries to the more moderate Dwight D. Eisenhower, an internationalist.

During his time in Congress, he was a social and fiscal conservative who supported isolationism and civil rights legislation, being one of the few Southern Congressmen who declined to sign the 1956 anti-desegregation Southern Manifesto and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960. He was a rarity in politics at the time—a truly senior Republican congressman from a former Confederate state.

====International controversy====
During the Cold War, Reece&#x27;s statement that &quot;The citizens of Danzig are German as they always had been&quot; caused a reply from Jędrzej Giertych, a leading Polish emigrant in London and writer, publicist, and publisher of National Democratic background. Danzig was separated from Germany and had been established as the Free City of Danzig in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles following World War I. It was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1939 and subsequently grouped with Poland in the Potsdam Agreement.

Reece was opposed to the Oder-Neisse line, advocating the return to Germany of its former Eastern territories.

====Cox Committee====
Reece was a member of the 1952 Select Committee to Investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations and Comparable Organizations, established by the House in April that year to probe major foundations for subversive activities. It was known during the congressional session as the Cox Committee, named after its chair Eugene &quot;Goober&quot; Cox, a Democratic segregationist from Georgia.

Due to family illnesses, Reece was absent for most of the hearings the Cox Committee conducted. Cox suddenly died in December 1952, and the final report which was soon released cleared the investigated foundations of any wrongdoing. Reece asserted the following, as listed in the Cox Committee report:
Among the remaining committee members, only Reece sought a do-over, believing that the scope of the investigations were insufficient. He in addition stated in a long, detailed House speech:
The Cox Committee report recommended a possible investigation of whether major foundations used their privileges for the purpose of tax evasion, as stated in page 12 of the report:
Reece ignored this aspect and only focused on subversive activities. Texas liberal populist Democrat Wright Patman later took up the report&#x27;s particular suggestion in the 1960s as chairman of the Select Committee on Small Business, also known as the Patman Committee.

====Reece Committee====

Reece led the House Select Committee to Investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations and Comparable Organizations which investigated the use of funds by tax-exempt non-profit organizations, and in particular foundations, to determine if they were using their funds to support communism in educational institutions. Reece selected attorney Norman Dodd to lead the investigation, which lasted eighteen months. Reece would later declare that &quot;The evidence that has been gathered by the staff pointed to one simple underlying situation, namely that the major foundations, by subsidizing collectivistic-minded educators, had financed a socialist trend in American government.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Reece died of lung cancer on March 19, 1961, in Bethesda, Maryland, just two months after being sworn in for his 18th term. He served in the House longer than anyone else in Tennessee history (though Jimmy Quillen, who eventually succeeded him as the 1st District&#x27;s congressman, holds the record for the longest unbroken tenure in the House for a Tennessee congressman), and only Kenneth McKellar served in both houses longer. Reece&#x27;s wife, Louise, was elected to serve the remainder of his unexpired term in Congress. Both are buried at Monte Vista Memorial Park in Johnson City, Tennessee.

He received several honorary degrees, including LL.D.s from Cumberland University and Tusculum College, and an L.H.D. from Lincoln Memorial University.

<doc id="81283" wikidata="Q591623" url="?curid=81283" title="Silent Spring">
<text>Silent Spring is an environmental science book by Rachel Carson. Published on September 27, 1962, the book documented the environmental harm caused by the indiscriminate use of DDT, a pesticide used by soldiers during World War II. Carson accused the chemical industry of spreading disinformation, and public officials of accepting the industry&#x27;s marketing claims unquestioningly.

In the late 1950s, Carson began to work on environmental conservation, especially environmental problems that she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result of her research was &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, which brought environmental concerns to the American public. The book was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, but it swayed public opinion and led to a reversal in US pesticide policy, a nationwide ban on DDT for agricultural uses, and an environmental movement that led to the creation of the US Environmental Protection Agency.

In 2006, &quot;Silent Spring&quot; was named one of the 25 greatest science books of all time by the editors of &quot;Discover&quot; magazine.

==Research and writing==
In the mid-1940s, Carson became concerned about the use of synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the military funding of science after World War II. The United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s 1957 fire ant eradication program, which involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides mixed with fuel oil and included the spraying of private land, prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. Landowners in Long Island filed a suit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the Supreme Court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future, laying the basis for later environmental actions.

The impetus for &quot;Silent Spring&quot; was a letter written in January 1958 by Carson&#x27;s friend, Olga Owens Huckins, to &quot;The Boston Herald&quot;, describing the death of birds around her property in Duxbury, Massachusetts, resulting from the aerial spraying of DDT to kill mosquitoes, a copy of which Huckins sent to Carson. Carson later wrote that this letter prompted her to study the environmental problems caused by the overuse of chemical pesticides.

The Audubon Naturalist Society actively opposed chemical spraying programs and recruited Carson to help publicize the US government&#x27;s spraying practices and related research. Carson began the four-year project of &quot;Silent Spring&quot; by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She tried to enlist essayist E. B. White and a number of journalists and scientists to her cause. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with &quot;Newsweek&quot; science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when &quot;The New Yorker&quot; commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it became a solo project. Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of &quot;Silent Spring&quot;.

As her research progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and environmental effects of pesticides. She took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information on the subject. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods, such as biological pest control.
By 1959, the USDA&#x27;s Agricultural Research Service responded to the criticism by Carson and others with a public service film, &quot;Fire Ants on Trial&quot;; Carson called it &quot;flagrant propaganda&quot; that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, that attributed the recent decline in bird populationsin her words, the &quot;silencing of birds&quot;to pesticide overuse. The same year, the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of US cranberries were found to contain high levels of the herbicide aminotriazole and the sale of all cranberry products was halted. Carson attended the ensuing FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she was discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying. She also wondered about the possible &quot;financial inducements behind certain pesticide programs&quot;.

Research at the National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health brought Carson into contact with medical researchers investigating the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance was the work of National Cancer Institute researcher and founding director of the environmental cancer section Wilhelm Hueper, who classified many pesticides as carcinogens. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide carcinogenesis.

By 1960, Carson had sufficient research material and the writing was progressing rapidly. She had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the resulting human sickness and ecological damage. In January 1960, she suffered an illness which kept her bedridden for weeks, delaying the book. As she was nearing full recovery in March, she discovered cysts in her left breast, requiring a mastectomy. By December that year, Carson discovered that she had breast cancer, which had metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of &quot;The Sea Around Us&quot;, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing was done by the fall of 1960, except for a discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations of some new pesticides. However, further health troubles delayed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.

The work&#x27;s title was inspired by a poem by John Keats, &quot;La Belle Dame sans Merci&quot;, which contained the lines &quot;The sedge is wither&#x27;d from the lake, And no birds sing.&quot; &quot;Silent Spring&quot; was initially suggested as a title for the chapter on birds. By August 1961, Carson agreed to the suggestion of her literary agent Marie Rodell: &quot;Silent Spring&quot; would be a metaphorical title for the entire booksuggesting a bleak future for the whole natural worldrather than a literal chapter title about the absence of birdsong. With Carson&#x27;s approval, editor Paul Brooks at Houghton Mifflin arranged for illustrations by Louis and Lois Darling, who also designed the cover. The final writing was the first chapter, &quot;A Fable for Tomorrow&quot;, which was intended to provide the fact that something like the story in the book could happen any time in the near future. By mid-1962, Brooks and Carson had largely finished the editing and were planning to promote the book by sending the manuscript to select individuals for final suggestions. In &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, Carson relied on evidence from two New York state organic farmers, Marjorie Spock and Mary Richards, and that of biodynamic farming advocate Ehrenfried Pfeiffer in developing her case against DDT.

==Content==
The overarching theme of &quot;Silent Spring&quot; is the powerfuland often negativeeffect humans have on the natural world. Carson&#x27;s main argument is that pesticides have detrimental effects on the environment; she says these are more properly termed &quot;biocides&quot; because their effects are rarely limited to solely targeting pests. DDT is a prime example, but other synthetic pesticidesmany of which are subject to bioaccumulationare scrutinized. Carson accuses the chemical industry of intentionally spreading disinformation and public officials of accepting industry claims uncritically. Most of the book is devoted to pesticides&#x27; effects on natural ecosystems, but four chapters detail cases of human pesticide poisoning, cancer, and other illnesses attributed to pesticides. About DDT and cancer, Carson says only:

Carson predicts increased consequences in the future, especially since targeted pests may develop resistance to pesticides and weakened ecosystems fall prey to unanticipated invasive species. The book closes with a call for a biotic approach to pest control as an alternative to chemical pesticides.

Carson never called for an outright ban on DDT. She said in &quot;Silent Spring&quot; that even if DDT and other insecticides had no environmental side effects, their indiscriminate overuse was counterproductive because it would create insect resistance to pesticides, making them useless in eliminating the target insect populations:

Carson also said that &quot;Malaria programmes are threatened by resistance among mosquitoes&quot;, and quoted the advice given by the director of Holland&#x27;s Plant Protection Service: &quot;Practical advice should be &#x27;Spray as little as you possibly can&#x27; rather than &#x27;Spray to the limit of your capacity&#x27;. Pressure on the pest population should always be as slight as possible.&quot;

=== Politics ===
At the time the book was written, environmental issues were excluded from mainstream political conversation in America. However, Carson believed that governments should consider what environmental impact a policy may have before implementing it; for example, in chapter 10 she describes a pesticide program from 1957 that was intended to control the spread of fire ants:With the development of chemicals of broad lethal powers, there came a sudden change in the official attitude towards the fire ant. In 1957 the United States Department of Agriculture launched one of the most remarkable publicity campaigns in its history. The fire ant suddenly became the target of a barrage of government releases, motion pictures, and government-inspired stories portraying it as a despoiler of southern agriculture and a killer of birds, livestock, and man. A mighty campaign was announced, in which the federal government in cooperation with the afflicted states would ultimately treat some 20,000,000 acres in nine southern states.Despite calls from experts to consider the damage using the pesticides could bring to the environment, the Agriculture Department dismissed the objections and continued on with the program:Urgent protests were made by most of the state conservation departments, by national conservation agencies, and by ecologists and even by some entomologists, calling upon the then Secretary of Agriculture, Ezra Benson, to delay the program at least until some research had been done to determine the effects of heptachlor and dieldrin on wild and domestic animals and to find the minimum amount that would control the ants. The protests were ignored and the program was launched in 1958. A million acres were treated the first year. It was clear that any research would be in the nature of a post mortem.After the program, an increased number of birds, cattle, horses and other wildlife were found dead in the areas where the pesticides had been sprayed. To make matters worse, the heptachlor and dieldrin sprayed accomplished nothing, instead creating more infested areas. Had the government researched the impact the chemicals could have on wildlife they could have prevented the deaths and environmental damage and saved the taxpayer&#x27;s money. Overall, &quot;Silent Spring&quot; not only uncovered the many negative effects pesticides have on the environment but also asked for environmental issues to be discussed and treated seriously within the political sphere.

==Promotion and reception==
Carson and the others involved with publication of &quot;Silent Spring&quot; expected fierce criticism and were concerned about the possibility of being sued for libel. Carson was undergoing radiation therapy for her cancer and expected to have little energy to defend her work and respond to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass prominent supporters before the book&#x27;s release.

Most of the book&#x27;s scientific chapters were reviewed by scientists with relevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support. Carson attended the White House Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of &quot;Silent Spring&quot; to many of the delegates and promoted the upcoming serialization in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Carson also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas, a long-time environmental advocate who had argued against the court&#x27;s rejection of the Long Island pesticide spraying case and had provided Carson with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides.

Though &quot;Silent Spring&quot; had generated a fairly high level of interest based on pre-publication promotion, this became more intense with its serialization, which began in the June 16, 1962, issue. This brought the book to the attention of the chemical industry and its lobbyists, as well as the American public. Around that time, Carson learned that &quot;Silent Spring&quot; had been selected as the Book of the Month for October; she said this would &quot;carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don&#x27;t know what a bookstore looks likemuch less &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&quot;. Other publicity included a positive editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and excerpts of the serialized version were published in &quot;Audubon Magazine&quot;. There was another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The story of the birth defect-causing drug thalidomide had broken just before the book&#x27;s publication, inviting comparisons between Carson and Frances Oldham Kelsey, the Food and Drug Administration reviewer who had blocked the drug&#x27;s sale in the United States.

In the weeks before the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong opposition to &quot;Silent Spring&quot; from the chemical industry. DuPont, a major manufacturer of DDT and 2,4-D, and Velsicol Chemical Company, the only manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor, were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book&#x27;s press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;Audubon Magazine&quot; unless their planned &quot;Silent Spring&quot; features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson&#x27;s and the publishers&#x27; lawyers were confident in the vetting process &quot;Silent Spring&quot; had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing, which included a pamphlet by William O. Douglas endorsing the book.

American Cyanamid biochemist Robert White-Stevens and former Cyanamid chemist Thomas Jukes were among the most aggressive critics, especially of Carson&#x27;s analysis of DDT. According to White-Stevens, &quot;If man were to follow the teachings of Miss Carson, we would return to the Dark Ages, and the insects and diseases and vermin would once again inherit the earth&quot;. Others attacked Carson&#x27;s personal character and scientific credentials, her training being in marine biology rather than biochemistry. White-Stevens called her &quot;a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature&quot;. According to historian Linda Lear the former US Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson, asked in a letter to former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, &quot;Why a spinster with no children was so concerned about genetics?&quot; Benson&#x27;s conclusion was Carson was &quot;probably a Communist&quot;.

Monsanto published 5,000 copies of a parody called &quot;The Desolate Year&quot; (1962) which projected a world of famine and disease caused by banning pesticides.

Many critics repeatedly said Carson was calling for the elimination of all pesticides, but she had made it clear she was not advocating this but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals&#x27; impact on ecosystems. She concludes her section on DDT in &quot;Silent Spring&quot; with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance. Mark Hamilton Lytle writes, Carson &quot;quite self-consciously decided to write a book calling into question the paradigm of scientific progress that defined postwar American culture&quot;.

The academic communityincluding prominent defenders such as H. J. Muller, Loren Eiseley, Clarence Cottam and Frank Eglermostly backed the book&#x27;s scientific claims and public opinion backed Carson&#x27;s text. The chemical industry campaign was counterproductive because the controversy increased public awareness of the potential dangers of pesticides, an early example of the Streisand Effect. Pesticide use became a major public issue after a &quot;CBS Reports&quot; television special, &quot;The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson&quot;, which was broadcast on April 3, 1963. The program included segments of Carson reading from &quot;Silent Spring&quot; and interviews with other experts, mostly critics including White-Stevens. According to biographer Linda Lear, &quot;in juxtaposition to the wild-eyed, loud-voiced Dr. Robert White-Stevens in white lab coat, Carson appeared anything but the hysterical alarmist that her critics contended&quot;. Reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide hazards and the public release of a pesticide report by the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee. Within a year of publication, attacks on the book and on Carson had lost momentum.

In one of her last public appearances, Carson testified before President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee, which issued its report on May 15, 1963, largely backing Carson&#x27;s scientific claims. Following the report&#x27;s release, Carson also testified before a US Senate subcommittee to make policy recommendations. Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, she was unable to accept most of them because her health was steadily declining, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she could, and appeared on &quot;The Today Show&quot; and gave speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the Audubon Medal from the National Audubon Society, the Cullum Geographical Medal from the American Geographical Society, and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.
Of Carson, Maria Popova wrote, &quot;Her lyrical writing rendered her not a mere translator of the natural world, but an alchemist transmuting the steel of science into the gold of wonder.&quot;

==Impact==

===Grassroots environmentalism and the EPA===
Carson&#x27;s work had a powerful impact on the environmental movement. &quot;Silent Spring&quot; became a rallying point for the new social movement in the 1960s. According to environmental engineer and Carson scholar H. Patricia Hynes, &quot;&quot;Silent Spring&quot; altered the balance of power in the world. No one since would be able to sell pollution as the necessary underside of progress so easily or uncritically.&quot; Carson&#x27;s work and the activism it inspired are partly responsible for the deep ecology movement and the strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s. It was also influential to the rise of ecofeminism and to many feminist scientists. Carson&#x27;s most direct legacy in the environmental movement was the campaign to ban the use of DDT in the United States, and related efforts to ban or limit its use throughout the world. The 1967 formation of the Environmental Defense Fund was the first major milestone in the campaign against DDT. The organization brought lawsuits against the government to &quot;establish a citizen&#x27;s right to a clean environment&quot;, and the arguments against DDT largely mirrored Carson&#x27;s. By 1972, the Environmental Defense Fund and other activist groups had succeeded in securing a phase-out of DDT use in the United States, except in emergency cases.

The creation of the Environmental Protection Agency by the Nixon Administration in 1970 addressed another concern that Carson had written about. Until then, the USDA was responsible both for regulating pesticides and promoting the concerns of the agriculture industry; Carson saw this as a conflict of interest (COI), since the agency was not responsible for effects on wildlife or other environmental concerns beyond farm policy. Fifteen years after its creation, one journalist described the EPA as &quot;the extended shadow of &quot;Silent Spring&quot;&quot;. Much of the agency&#x27;s early work, such as enforcement of the 1972 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, was directly related to Carson&#x27;s work. Contrary to the position of the pesticide industry, the DDT phase-out action taken by the EPA (led by William Ruckelshaus) implied that there was no way to adequately regulate DDT use. Ruckelshaus&#x27; conclusion was that DDT could not be used safely. History professor Gary Kroll wrote, &quot;Rachel Carson&#x27;s &quot;Silent Spring&quot; played a large role in articulating ecology as a &#x27;subversive subject&#x27;as a perspective that cuts against the grain of materialism, scientism, and the technologically engineered control of nature.&quot;

In a 2013 interview, Ruckelshaus briefly recounted his decision to ban DDT except for emergency uses, noting that Carson&#x27;s book featured DDT and for that reason the issue drew considerable public attention.

Former Vice President of the United States and environmentalist Al Gore wrote an introduction to the 1992 edition of &quot;Silent Spring&quot;. He wrote: &quot;&quot;Silent Spring&quot; had a profound impact ... Indeed, Rachel Carson was one of the reasons that I became so conscious of the environment and so involved with environmental issues  ...  [she] has had as much or more effect on me than any, and perhaps than all of them together.&quot;

===Debate over environmentalism and DDT restrictions===
Carson has been targeted by some organizations opposed to the environmental movement, including Roger Bate of the pro-DDT advocacy group Africa Fighting Malaria and the libertarian think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI); these sources oppose restrictions on DDT, attribute large numbers of deaths to such restrictions, and argue that Carson was responsible for them. These arguments have been dismissed as &quot;outrageous&quot; by former World Health Organization scientist Socrates Litsios. May Berenbaum, University of Illinois entomologist, says, &quot;to blame environmentalists who oppose DDT for more deaths than Hitler is worse than irresponsible&quot;. Investigative journalist Adam Sarvana and others characterize this notion as a &quot;myth&quot; promoted principally by Bate.

In the 1990s and 2000s, campaigns against the book intensified, in part due to efforts by the tobacco industry to cast larger doubt on science-driven policy as a way of contesting bans on smoking. In 2009, the heavily corporate-funded CEI set up a website falsely blaming Carson for deaths to malaria. This triggered a point-by-point rebuttal by biographer William Souder, who reviewed the distortions used by campaigners against &quot;Silent Spring&quot;.

A 2012 review article in &quot;Nature&quot; by Rob Dunn commemorating the 50th anniversary of &quot;Silent Spring&quot; and summarizing the progressive environmental-policy changes made since then, prompted a response in a letter written by Anthony Trewavas and co-signed by 10 others, including Christopher Leaver, Bruce Ames and Peter Lachmann, who quote estimates of 60 to 80 million deaths &quot;as a result of misguided fears based on poorly understood evidence&quot;.

Biographer Hamilton Lytle believes these estimates are unrealistic, even if Carson can be &quot;blamed&quot; for worldwide DDT policies. John Quiggin and Tim Lambert wrote, &quot;the most striking feature of the claim against Carson is the ease with which it can be refuted&quot;. DDT was never banned for anti-malarial use, and its ban for agricultural use in the United States in 1972 did not apply outside the US nor to anti-malaria spraying. The international treaty that banned most uses of DDT and other organochlorine pesticidesthe 2001 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (which became effective in 2004)included an exemption for the use of DDT for malaria control until affordable substitutes could be found. Mass outdoor spraying of DDT was abandoned in poor countries subject to malaria, such as Sri Lanka, in the 1970s and 1980s; this was not because of government prohibitions but because the DDT had lost its ability to kill the mosquitoes. Because of insects&#x27; very short breeding cycle and large number of offspring, the most resistant insects survive and pass on their genetic traits to their offspring, which replace the pesticide-slain insects relatively rapidly. Agricultural spraying of pesticides produces pesticide resistance in seven to ten years.

Some experts have said that restrictions placed on the agricultural use of DDT have increased its effectiveness for malaria control. According to pro-DDT advocate Amir Attaran, the result of the (activated in 2004) Stockholm Convention banning DDT&#x27;s use in agriculture &quot;is arguably better than the status quo ... For the first time, there is now an insecticide which is restricted to vector control only, meaning that the selection of resistant mosquitoes will be slower than before.&quot;

===Legacy===
&quot;Silent Spring&quot; has been featured in many lists of the best nonfiction books of the twentieth century. It was fifth in the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Nonfiction and number 78 in the &quot;National Review&quot; 100 best non-fiction books of the 20th century. In 2006, &quot;Silent Spring&quot; was named one of the 25 greatest science books of all time by the editors of &quot;Discover Magazine&quot;. In 2012, the American Chemical Society designated the legacy of &quot;Silent Spring&quot; a National Historic Chemical Landmark at Chatham University in Pittsburgh.

In 1996, a follow-up book, &quot;Beyond Silent Spring&quot;, co-written by H. F. van Emden and David Peakall, was published.

In 1967, George Newson composed the tape composition &quot;Silent Spring&quot; using birdsong recorded at London Zoo as source material. It was premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in January 1968.

&quot;Silent Spring&quot; is mentioned in the 2008 science fiction novel &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; by Liu Cixin, as well as its Tencent 2023 and Netflix 2024 television series adaptations.

In 2011, the American composer Steven Stucky wrote the eponymously titled symphonic poem &quot;Silent Spring&quot; to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the book&#x27;s publication. The piece was given its world premiere in Pittsburgh on February 17, 2012, with the conductor Manfred Honeck leading the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.

Naturalist David Attenborough has stated that &quot;Silent Spring&quot; was probably the book that had changed the scientific world the most, after the &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; by Charles Darwin.

Sonic Flower Groove, is the debut studio album by Scottish rock band Primal Scream, it was released on 5 October 1987, features a song titled &quot;&#x27;Silent Spring&quot;&#x27;. The lead singer Bobby Gillespie in his book &quot;Tenement kid&quot; published late 2021, mentions how he dedicated the songs title after the Book.

<text>Action Comics is an American comic book/magazine series that introduced Superman, one of the first major superhero characters. The publisher was originally known as Detective Comics Inc., which later merged into National Comics Publications (later National Periodical Publications), before taking on its current name of DC Comics. Its original incarnation ran from 1938 to 2011 and stands as one of the longest-running comic books with consecutively numbered issues. The second volume of &quot;Action Comics&quot; beginning with issue #1 ran from 2011 to 2016. &quot;Action Comics&quot; returned to its original numbering beginning with issue #957 (Aug. 2016).

==Publication history==

===The Golden Age===
Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster saw their creation, Superman (also known as Kal-El, originally Kal-L), launched in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 on April 18, 1938 (cover dated June), an event which began the Golden Age of Comic Books. Siegel and Shuster had tried for years to find a publisher for their Superman character—conceived initially as a newspaper strip. Superman was originally a bald madman created by Siegel and Shuster who used his telepathic abilities to wreak havoc on humanity. He appeared in Siegel and Shuster&#x27;s fanzine &quot;Science Fiction&quot;. Siegel then commented, &quot;What if this Superman was a force for good instead of evil?&quot; The writer and artist had worked on several features for National Allied Publications&#x27; other titles such as Slam Bradley in &quot;Detective Comics.&quot; They were asked to contribute a feature for National&#x27;s newest publication. They submitted Superman for
consideration. After re-pasting the sample newspaper strips they had prepared into comic book page format, National decided to make Superman the cover feature of their new magazine. After seeing the published first issue, publisher Harry Donenfeld dismissed the featured strip as ridiculous. He ordered it never to be on the cover of the series. Subsequent reports of the first issue&#x27;s strong sales and follow up investigations revealed that Superman was the reason. Thus, the character returned to the covers, becoming a permanent presence in issue 19 onward.

Initially, &quot;Action Comics&quot; was an anthology title featuring several other stories in addition to the Superman story. Zatara, a magician, was one of the other characters who had his own stories in early issues. There was the hero Tex Thompson, who eventually became Mr. America and later the Americommando. Vigilante enjoyed a lengthy run in this series. Sometimes stories of a more humorous nature were included, such as those of Hayfoot Henry, a policeman who talked in rhyme. The series saw the introduction of several characters and themes that would become longstanding elements of the Superman mythos. Lois Lane made her debut in the first issue with Superman. An unnamed &quot;office boy&quot; with a bow tie makes a brief appearance in the story &quot;Superman&#x27;s Phony Manager&quot; published in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #6 (November 1938), which is claimed to be Jimmy Olsen&#x27;s first appearance by several reference sources.

New superpowers depicted for the first time for the character included X-ray vision and super-hearing in issue #11 (April 1939) and telescopic vision and super-breath in issue #20 (January 1940).

Luthor, a villain who would later become Superman&#x27;s arch-enemy, was introduced in issue #23 (April 1940). The original Toyman was created by writer Don Cameron and artist Ed Dobrotka in issue #64 (September 1943). By 1942, artist Wayne Boring, who had previously been one of Shuster&#x27;s assistants, had become a major artist on Superman.

===The Silver Age===
Under editor Mort Weisinger, the &quot;Action Comics&quot; title saw a further expansion of the Superman mythology. Writer Jerry Coleman and Wayne Boring created the Fortress of Solitude in issue #241 (June 1958) and Otto Binder and Al Plastino debuted the villain Brainiac and the Bottle City of Kandor in the next issue the following month.

Gradually, the size of the issues was decreased. The publisher was reluctant to raise the cover price from the original 10 cents and reduced the number of stories. For a while, Congo Bill and Tommy Tomorrow were the two features in addition to Superman. Writer Robert Bernstein and artist Howard Sherman revamped the &quot;Congo Bill&quot; backup feature in issue #248 (January 1959) in a story wherein the character gained the ability to swap bodies with a gorilla and his strip was renamed Congorilla. The introduction of Supergirl by Otto Binder and Al Plastino occurred in issue #252 (May 1959). Following this debut appearance, Supergirl adopted the secret identity of an orphan &quot;Linda Lee&quot; and made Midvale Orphanage her base of operations. In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #261 (February 1960), her pet cat Streaky was introduced by Jerry Siegel and Jim Mooney. Supergirl joined the Legion of Super-Heroes in issue #276. She acted for three years as Superman&#x27;s &quot;secret weapon&quot;, until her existence was revealed in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #285 (January 1962). In the view of comics historian Les Daniels, artist Curt Swan became the definitive artist of Superman in the early 1960s with a &quot;new look&quot; to the character that replaced Wayne Boring&#x27;s version. Bizarro World first appeared in the story &quot;The World of Bizarros!&quot; in issue #262 (April 1960). Writer Jim Shooter created the villain the Parasite in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #340 (Aug. 1966).

===The Bronze Age===
Mort Weisinger retired from DC in 1970 and his final issue of &quot;Action Comics&quot; was issue #392 (September 1970). Murray Boltinoff became the title&#x27;s editor until issue #418. Metamorpho was the backup feature in issues #413–418 after which the character had a brief run as the backup in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot;. Julius Schwartz became the editor of the series with issue #419 (December 1972) which also introduced the Human Target by Len Wein and Carmine Infantino in the backup feature. The Green Arrow and the Black Canary became a backup feature in #421 and ran through #458, initially rotating with the Human Target and the Atom. Between issues #423 (April 1973) and #424 (June 1973), the series jumped ahead by one month due to DC&#x27;s decision to change the cover dates of its publishing line.

A new version of the Toyman was created by Cary Bates and Curt Swan in issue #432 (February 1974). Issues #437 (July 1974) and #443 (Jan. 1975) of the series were in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format. Martin Pasko wrote issue #500 (October 1979) which featured a history of the Superman canon as it existed at the time and was published in the Dollar Comics format.

The superheroine Vixen made her first appearance in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #521 (July 1981). To mark the 45th anniversary of the series, Lex Luthor and Brainiac were both given an updated appearance in issue #544 (June 1983). Lex Luthor dons his war suit for the first time in the story &quot;Luthor Unleashed!&quot; and Brainiac&#x27;s appearance changes from the familiar green-skinned android to the metal skeletal-like robot in the story &quot;Rebirth!&quot;. Keith Giffen&#x27;s Ambush Bug character made appearances in issues #560, #563, and #565. &quot;Action Comics&quot; #579, written by Jean-Marc Lofficier and drawn by Giffen, featured an homage to Asterix where Superman and Jimmy Olsen are drawn back in time to a small village of indomitable Gauls. Schwartz ended his run as editor of the series with issue #583 (September 1986) which featured the second part of the &quot;&quot; story by Alan Moore and Curt Swan.

===The Modern Age===
Following the events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, writer/artist John Byrne relaunched the Superman franchise in &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; limited series in 1986. &quot;Action Comics&quot; became a team-up title with issue #584 (January 1987) featuring Superman and the New Teen Titans. Other costars during this period included the Phantom Stranger, the New Gods, the Demon, Hawkman and Hawkwoman, the Green Lantern Corps, the Metal Men, Superboy, Big Barda, Mister Miracle, Booster Gold, the Martian Manhunter, the Spectre, Lois Lane and Lana Lang, Checkmate, Wonder Woman, and the Man-Bat. The first &quot;Action Comics Annual&quot; was published in 1987 and featured Superman teaming with Batman in a story written by Byrne and drawn by Arthur Adams. A DC Comics Bonus Book was included in issue #599 (April 1988).

From May 24, 1988 – March 14, 1989, the publication frequency was changed to weekly, the title changed to &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot;, and the series became an anthology. Prior to its launch, DC cancelled its ongoing &quot;Green Lantern Corps&quot; title and made Green Lantern and his adventures exclusive to &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot;.

The rest of these issues featured rotating serialized stories of other DC heroes, sometimes as try-outs that led to their own limited or ongoing series. Characters with featured stories in the run included the Black Canary, Blackhawk, Captain Marvel, Catwoman, Deadman, Nightwing, the Phantom Lady, the Phantom Stranger, the Secret Six, Speedy, and Wild Dog. Titles spun off from &quot;Action Comics&quot; at this time included a Catwoman miniseries and a Blackhawk ongoing, in both cases by the same creative teams that worked on the weekly serials. During and after &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot;&#x27;s run, two &quot;Green Lantern Special&quot;s were published in late 1988 and the second in spring 1989, the latter special wrapping up the storylines from the Green Lantern serials in &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot;. Each issue featured a two-page Superman serial, a feature that, according to an editorial in the first weekly issue, was intended as a homage to the Superman newspaper strips of the past.

The final issue of the weekly was originally intended to feature a book-length encounter between Clark Kent and Hal Jordan by writer Neil Gaiman. While Gaiman&#x27;s story primarily teamed up Green Lantern and Superman, it also featured other characters from &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot;, including the Blackhawks (in flashback), Deadman, and the Phantom Stranger. The story ran counter to DC editorial policy at the time as it portrayed Hal Jordan and Clark Kent as old friends who knew each other&#x27;s secret identities. This was not considered canon in 1989 and Gaiman was unwilling to change this aspect of the story (as each serial in &quot;ACW&quot; was edited by different editors, continuity was not being maintained by DC editorial). The story was pulled and a different story, written by Elliot S. Maggin, was run. Gaiman&#x27;s story was finally published as a one-shot in &quot;Green Lantern/Superman: Legend of the Green Flame&quot; in November 2000.

The &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot; experiment lasted only until the beginning of March 1989 and after a short break, issue #643 (July 1989) brought the title back onto a monthly schedule. Writer/artist George Pérez took over the title and was joined by scripter Roger Stern the following month.

As writer of the series, Stern contributed to such storylines as &quot;Panic in the Sky&quot; and &quot;The Death of Superman&quot;. He created the Eradicator in &quot;Action Comics Annual&quot; #2 and later incorporated the character into the &quot;Reign of the Supermen&quot; story arc beginning in &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #500. The Eradicator then took over &quot;Action Comics&quot; as &quot;the Last Son of Krypton&quot; in issue #687 (June 1993).

Stern wrote the 1991 story wherein Clark Kent finally revealed his identity as Superman to Lois Lane.

Several major Superman storylines crossed over with &quot;Action Comics&quot; including &quot;Emperor Joker&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Our Worlds at War&quot; in 2001. John Byrne returned to &quot;Action Comics&quot; for issues #827–835 working with writer Gail Simone in 2005–2006.

After the &quot;One Year Later&quot; company-wide storyline, &quot;Action Comics&quot; had a crossover arc with the &quot;Superman&quot; series, entitled &quot;&quot; which told of Clark Kent attempting to protect Metropolis without his powers until eventually regaining them.

The &quot;Last Son&quot; storyline was written by Geoff Johns and Richard Donner, the director of the 1978 film &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;, and was pencilled by Adam Kubert. This story introduces the original character, Christopher Kent, and adapts the classic Superman film villains, General Zod, Ursa and Non into the regular DC Universe continuity. Issue #851 (August 2007) was presented in 3-D.

Starting with issue #875 (May 2009), written by Greg Rucka and drawn by Eddy Barrows, Thara Ak-Var and Chris Kent, took Superman&#x27;s place as the main protagonists of the comic, while Superman left Earth to live on New Krypton. A Captain Atom backup feature began in issue #879 (September 2009).

On February 22, 2010, a copy of &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 (June 1938) sold at auction for $3 million, besting the $317,000 record for a comic book set by a different copy, in lesser condition, the previous year. The sale, by an anonymous seller to an anonymous buyer, was through the Manhattan-based auction company ComicConnect.com.

Although DC had initially announced Marc Guggenheim as writer of the title following the &quot;War of the Supermen&quot; limited series, he was replaced by Paul Cornell. Cornell featured Lex Luthor as the main character in &quot;Action Comics&quot; from issues #890–900 and Death appeared in issue #894, with the agreement of the character&#x27;s creator, Neil Gaiman. In April 2011, the 900th issue of &quot;Action Comics&quot; was released. It served as a conclusion for Luthor&#x27;s &quot;Black Ring&quot; storyline and a continuation for the &quot;Reign of Doomsday&quot; storyline. The final issue of the original series was &quot;Action Comics&quot; #904.

===The New 52===
The title was relaunched from issue #1, as part of 2011&#x27;s The New 52 by the creative team of writer Grant Morrison and artist Rags Morales. As with all of the books associated with the relaunch, Clark Kent appears younger than the previous incarnation of the character. &quot;Action Comics&quot; focus on the early days of Superman&#x27;s career, while the &quot;Superman&quot; series focus on Superman&#x27;s present. Superheroes at large have appeared only in the past five years, and are viewed with at best, suspicion, and at worst, outright hostility. The storyline in &quot;Action Comics&quot; takes place about a year before the events of &quot;Justice League&quot; #1, and was referred to by DC Co-Publisher Dan DiDio as &quot;DC Universe Year Zero&quot; while &quot;JL&quot; operates as &quot;Year One.&quot; The Man of Steel is not yet trusted by Metropolis citizens and wears a basic costume consisting of a caped T-shirt, jeans and work boots. The first issue has had five printings as of March 2012.

The first story arc of the relaunched series, entitled &quot;Superman and the Men of Steel&quot; for the collected edition, begins very early in Superman&#x27;s career as he starts making a name for himself as a champion of the oppressed in Metropolis. He captures the attention of the military and scientist Lex Luthor, who are both interested in testing his capabilities as well as discovering what kind of threat he represents.

Following the completion of Morrison&#x27;s storyline, writer Andy Diggle and artist Tony Daniel became the new creative team on the title with issue #19. Unlike the previous issues, the setting for the &quot;Action Comics&quot; series would now take place in the present. Diggle announced his resignation as the writer of the series shortly before his first issue went on sale. Diggle left the title with only one issue completed (he would be co-writer for #20 and co-plot issue #21), with Daniel taking on full scripting and art duties for the two following issues completing the three-part story arc &quot;Hybrid&quot;. Scott Lobdell wrote the series after Diggle and Daniel&#x27;s departure. Writer Greg Pak and artist Aaron Kuder became the new creative team on the series with issue #25 (Jan. 2014). This series concluded with issue #52 (July 2016), which was part of the &quot;Final Days of Superman&quot; storyline which depicted the death of the &quot;New 52&quot; version of Superman.

===DC Rebirth===
As part of DC Comics&#x27; DC Rebirth relaunch in June 2016, &quot;Action Comics&quot; reverted to its original numbering beginning with &quot;Action Comics&quot; #957. Written by Dan Jurgens, the series ships twice-monthly and serves as a continuation of the comic book series &quot;&quot;, which featured the pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; Superman alongside his wife, Lois Lane, and their son, Jon Kent.
For the series&#x27; 1000th issue—released on April 18, 2018, the 80th anniversary of the premiere issue—DC returned Superman to his traditional costume with the red trunks and yellow belt. &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1000 collects the regular cover, blank variant cover, eight covers spanning eight decades from the 1930s-2000s, nineteen other variant covers from variant artists, and a hardcover &quot;Action Comics: 80 Years of Superman Deluxe Edition&quot;.

Brian Michael Bendis became the new writer for the &quot;Action Comics&quot; series starting with issue #1001.

===Infinite Frontier===
Starting with issue #1029, the title became a part of the Infinite Frontier relaunch in March 2021. Phillip Kennedy Johnson became the lead writer on the series, as well as its companion series &quot;Superman&quot;.

==Publication changes and special numbering==
&quot;Action Comics&quot; is the longest-running DC Comics series by number of issues, followed by &quot;Detective Comics&quot;. A departure from a strict monthly schedule was four giant-size Supergirl reprint issues published as a 13th issue annually: issues #334 (March 1966), #347 (March–April 1967), #360 (March–April 1968), and #373 (March–April 1969). &quot;Action Comics&quot; has not had an uninterrupted run, having been on a three-month hiatus on two separate occasions. The first of these occurred during the summer of 1986, with issue #583 bearing a cover date of September, and issue #584 listing January 1987. The regular Superman titles were suspended during this period to allow for the publication of John Byrne&#x27;s six-issue &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; limited series. Publication was again suspended between issues #686 and #687 (February and June 1993) following the &quot;Death of Superman&quot; and &quot;Funeral for a Friend&quot; storylines, before &quot;Action Comics&quot; returned in June 1993 with the &quot;Reign of the Supermen&quot; arc.

The series was published weekly from May 24, 1988, to March 14, 1989. (See detail in The Modern Age section above.) The temporarily increased frequency of issues allowed &quot;Action Comics&quot; to further surpass the older &quot;Detective Comics&quot; in the number of individual issues published. It surpassed &quot;Detective Comics&quot; in the 1970s when that series was bimonthly for a number of years. This change lasted from issue #601 to issue #642. During this time, Superman appeared only in a two-page story per issue; he was still the only character to appear in every issue of the series.

An issue #0 (October 1994) was published between issues #703 and #704 as part of the Zero Month after the &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time&quot; crossover event. There was an issue #1,000,000 (November 1998) during the &quot;DC One Million&quot; crossover event in October 1998 between issues #748 and #749.

On June 1, 2011, it was announced that all series taking place within the shared DC Universe would be either canceled or relaunched with new #1 issues, after a new continuity was created in the wake of the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; event. Although being DC&#x27;s longest running series, having reached issue #904 at the end of its initial run, &quot;Action Comics&quot; was no exception, and the first issue of the new series was released on September 7, 2011.

In February 2016, it was announced that as part of the DC Rebirth relaunch, &quot;Action Comics&quot; would resume its original numbering system, starting with issue #957 (Aug. 2016) and ship on a twice-monthly schedule.

<doc id="81285" wikidata="Q487155" url="?curid=81285" title="Hugo Sánchez">
<text>Hugo Sánchez Márquez (born 11 July 1958) is a Mexican former professional footballer and manager, who played as a forward. A prolific goalscorer known for his spectacular strikes and volleys, he is widely regarded as the greatest Mexican footballer of all time, one of the best players of his generation, and one of the best strikers of all time. In 1999, the International Federation of Football History and Statistics voted Sánchez the 26th best footballer of the 20th century, and the best footballer from the CONCACAF region. In 2004, Sánchez was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players.

Sánchez is regarded as one of La Liga&#x27;s best foreign imports, and one of Real Madrid&#x27;s top strikers of all time. He is the fifth highest scorer in the history of La Liga, the fourth highest scoring foreign player after Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Karim Benzema, and is the seventh highest goalscorer in Real Madrid&#x27;s history. He scored a total of 562 senior career goals for both club and country in 956 matches, amassing a total of five Pichichi top goal scorer trophies in Spain.

Beginning his career at Club Universidad Nacional in 1976, he briefly went on loan to the San Diego Sockers of the North American Soccer League in 1979, during the Mexican League&#x27;s off-season period. In 1981, he moved to Spain to play for Atlético Madrid, playing for the &quot;Colchoneros&quot; for four years before moving to cross-town rivals Real Madrid, where he would spend the best years of his career, winning numerous titles and accolades.

From 1977 to 1994, Sánchez was a member of the national team, gaining 58 caps and scoring 29 goals. He participated in three FIFA World Cup tournaments and was a part of the Mexico team that reached the quarter-finals of the 1986 World Cup. Famous for his acrobatic goal celebrations throughout his club and international career, Sánchez was the first notable exponent of the backflip.

As a manager, he won two consecutive league championships with UNAM. After managing Necaxa, he was announced as coach of the Mexico national football team in 2006, but was fired in March 2008 due to poor results. In 2009, Sánchez was named manager of Almería, and helped to save the club from relegation.

==Club career==
===UNAM===
As a teenager, Sánchez played for the Mexico national team at the 1976 Summer Olympics. Having already played in over 80 international matches, Sánchez signed as a youth player at the age of 18 for Pumas de la UNAM, a professional team representing Mexico&#x27;s national university, where he completed a degree in Dentistry while playing for the first team. Later that year, UNAM managed to win its first championship in the Primera División. Two years later, he became the league&#x27;s top-scorer with 26 goals.

In 1979, UNAM agreed to exchange players during the off-season with the San Diego Sockers of the North American Soccer League. He played in the NASL during the summer and in the Mexican league during the fall, winter and spring. UNAM loaned Sánchez to the Sockers in 1979 and 1980 where he became a prolific striker for the Sockers, averaging nearly a goal a game.

Sánchez&#x27;s five seasons with UNAM were during the team&#x27;s golden years. In 1980–81, his last season with the club, Sánchez and UNAM won its second league championship, a CONCACAF Champions Cup and a Copa Interamericana. During his five years with UNAM, Sánchez scored 104 goals in 200 appearances.

With Hugo&#x27;s exemplary performances in the Toulon tournament and 1975 Cannes Youth Tournament, he earned his nickname Niño de Oro which translates to Golden boy.

===Atlético Madrid===
After five successful seasons in Mexico, Sánchez drew the attention of several European sides, including that of English club Arsenal, though eventually signing with Spanish side Atlético Madrid in 1981. It took him a while to find his feet in La Liga, only managing twenty league appearances and scoring eight goals in his first season, but by the 1984–1985 season he was scoring regularly with a team that won the Copa del Rey, finished second in the league and won the Spanish Super Copa. That year, Sánchez won his first Pichichi trophy for being the most prolific scorer in the league, scoring 26 goals.

===Real Madrid===

On 15 July 1985, Sánchez signed for La Liga club Real Madrid. It was reported that due to Atlético Madrid&#x27;s reluctance to anger their fan base with a direct deal with Real, Sánchez was transferred to UNAM back in his home country on 4 July before being signed by Real Madrid, with the contract signing taking place in a bank in Mexico City. He was flown back to Spain and presented to 50,000 fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on 19 July.

He played alongside the famed group of players known as the &quot;La Quinta del Buitre&quot; (&quot;Vulture&#x27;s Cohort&quot;), which consisted of Emilio Butragueño, Manuel Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel, and Miguel Pardeza. With &quot;Los Blancos&quot;, Sánchez won five consecutive league titles from 1985 to 1990, a Copa del Rey title in 1989 and the UEFA Cup in 1986. During those five years, Sánchez won four-consecutive Pichichi trophies, becoming one of two players in Spanish football history to achieve this without sharing the trophy with any other player in any season (the other being Lionel Messi with 5 consecutive Pichichi awards between 2017 and 2021), and one of four players to win five Pichichis (the others being Alfredo Di Stéfano, Quini and Messi (who has won 8), scoring 208 goals in 283 games in all competitions. He scored 27 or more goals in four consecutive seasons between 1986 and 1990, including 38 goals in the 1989–90 season, tying the single-season record set in 1951 by Telmo Zarra and earning the European Golden Boot award for the best scorer in Europe. Remarkably, all 38 of these goals were scored with only a single touch. His 38-goal tally stood as a league record until Cristiano Ronaldo surpassed it after scoring 40 goals in the 2010–11 season. In European Cup competitions, Sánchez scored 47 goals in 45 matches.

===Later career===
In 1992, Sánchez returned to his native Mexico for a season and there he won the 1992 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup with Club América before playing for a variety of clubs in Spain, Austria and the United States. He played for Dallas Burn in the inaugural year of Major League Soccer, becoming one of two footballers, along with Roy Wegerle, to play outdoor football in both the NASL and MLS. He finished his career playing for Atlético Celaya, along with Butragueño and Míchel, his old colleagues from Real Madrid.

===Retirement===
Sánchez retired from Spanish football on 29 May 1997, playing with Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. His last official game was during the 1998 World Cup qualifiers, where he touched the ball as a symbol of his retirement.

==International career==
Sánchez made 58 appearances for Mexico between 1977 and 1994, scoring 29 goals. Prior to representing the senior side, as a teenager he represented Mexico at the 1975 Pan American Games on home soil, where he won a gold medal, and at the 1976 Summer Olympics. He participated in three FIFA World Cup tournaments, making eight World Cup appearances in total, and scoring once. Also, with Chilean Elías Figueroa holds the unique distinction of playing in three alternate tournaments 1978-1986-1994. He helped Mexico win the 1977 CONCACAF Championship to seal qualification for the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina; at the age of 19, he took part in the final tournament, where Mexico lost all three of their group games and suffered a first round elimination.

After Mexico failed to qualify for the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain, Sánchez was a part of the Mexico team that reached the quarter-finals of the 1986 World Cup on home soil, losing out to eventual runners-up West Germany in a penalty shootout. He scored his only World Cup goal during his nation&#x27;s opening match of the tournament on 3 June, the winning goal in a 2–1 victory over Belgium, although he also missed a penalty in Mexico&#x27;s second group match against Paraguay, and was later booked, causing him to miss the final group match. Four years later, however, Mexico once again missed out on the final tournament as they were suspended from the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy.

Despite his advancing age, he later played a key role in helping Mexico to the final of the 1993 Copa América, at the age of 35; he scored once in a 2–0 victory over Ecuador in the semi-finals, although Mexico eventually finished as runners-up to Argentina. Sánchez later also appeared at the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States, his final major tournament, where Mexico suffered a round of 16 elimination; he made his only appearance in the tournament on 19 June, in Mexico&#x27;s opening match of the competition, a 1–0 defeat to Norway.

==Managerial career==
===Club===
In March 2000, Sánchez became manager of UNAM, who were struggling in the league, signing a two-year deal. Although the team went on to have a good campaign under his leadership, differences between the club president and Sánchez resulted in his sacking in August of that year.

After Jimenez Espriu resigned as the club president a year later, the new president, Luis Regueiro, appointed Sánchez as head coach in November 2001.

After building his team up for a number of years, by 2004 Sánchez&#x27; Pumas had won everything they played in: Clausura 2004, Apertura 2004, Champion of Champions 2004 and the Santiago Bernabéu Cup. He also became the only manager in history to lead a Mexican team to two consecutive championships in the Mexican Primera División in the &quot;short tournament&quot; format.

The success, however, was short lived. Pumas became the worst team of the tournament the following season and in Winter 2005 were having the worst year in its history. Sánchez decided to resign in November 2005.

Club Necaxa, another Mexican team, signed him as a head coach in 2006, and he also became the coach of the Mexico national team that year following their participation at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

He became coach of La Liga&#x27;s Almería in early 2009, but after accomplishing the goal of avoiding relegation from La Liga, and despite on 2 June 2009 the Almeria chairman Alfonso García announcing the renewal of his contract, he was released on 20 December 2009.

===Mexico===
After briefly managing Club Necaxa, Sánchez was named head coach of the Mexico national team, with the aim of leading Mexico through the qualification process for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.

During his coaching career especially, Sánchez became known for his volatile temperament and his willingness to speak candidly, often expressing strong emotions and opinions, a trait that engenders equally emotional and strong responses from those he criticizes. He had a long-standing feud with the previous Mexico coach, Ricardo La Volpe.

Sánchez&#x27;s first match as Mexico coach was a 2–0 loss to the United States in Phoenix, Arizona in February 2007. Sánchez recorded his first victory against Venezuela, a 3–1 win in front of 67,000 fans in San Diego. Hugo&#x27;s first game in Mexico took place against Paraguay in Monterrey on 25 March 2007, which Mexico won 2–1. A few days later on 28 March 2007, Mexico defeated Ecuador 4–2 in Oakland, California.

In June 2007, Sánchez coached Mexico in the 2007 edition of the Gold Cup, his first official competition. After struggling in the first stages of the tournament, México reached the final 24 June 2007 and lost 2–1 against the US.

On 27 June 2007, in the opening game of the 2007 Copa América held in Venezuela, Sánchez led the Mexico national team to a stunning 2–0 win Brazil, Hugo&#x27;s first major victory as a coach. After easing through the group stage of the tournament, Hugo led the team to the semi-finals (beating Paraguay 6–0 in the quarter-finals) where they were beaten 3–0 by Argentina. Mexico ended the tournament in third place by defeating Uruguay 3–1.

In August 2007, Sánchez announced that Mexico would permanently, or at least in his time coaching the team, drop their famous green home kit, replacing it with their white away kit, meaning that their new away kit would be red. For this decision, Sánchez was subject of a lot of criticism. The two main arguments against him were that the decision was breaking a long-standing Mexican tradition, yet the strongest critics suggested that he should devote more time to the strategy and training of the Mexico team rather than entertaining himself with superfluous features of the sport.

In March 2008, Sánchez suffered poor results, including draws with Australia and Finland, and a loss at home in Querétaro against Ecuador&#x27;s U-23 team. Disappointing results continued in the CONCACAF Olympic Qualification, a draw with Canada and a loss to Guatemala. His only victory was a 5–1 win against Haiti. Mexico were eliminated from the Pre-Olympic qualifying tournament on goal difference.

On 31 March 2008, Hugo Sánchez was fired from his post as Mexico head coach.

==Style of play==
 Nicknamed &quot;Hugol&quot; and &quot;Pentapichichi&quot;, Sánchez was a prolific goalscorer, who usually played as a centre-forward; he is widely regarded as Mexico&#x27;s greatest-ever footballer, and one of the greatest players of his generation. A quick and mobile striker, with good skills and an eye for goal, he was known for his intelligence, positional sense, movement, and anticipation in the area, and was an accurate and efficient finisher, who was capable of scoring with few touches.

Due to his athleticism, Sánchez was good in the air, despite his diminutive stature, and was also known for his ability to score acrobatic and flamboyant goals from spectacular strikes and volleys from any position on the pitch, both inside or outside the area; his mastery of the &quot;Chilena&quot;, or &quot;Bicycle kick&quot;, was a result of his own early training in gymnastics, and his goals scored in this manner were later dubbed &quot;Huguinas&quot;. His trademark was to perform a celebratory somersault followed by a fist pump after each goal he scored, in honour of his sister, who was a gymnast and participated in the Montreal Olympics. Sánchez is considered to be the first noted exponent of the backflip.

According to his FIFA profile, Sánchez is credited as the creator of the scorpion kick, which was later popularised by Colombian goalkeeper René Higuita. Though he regularly practised the trick in training, the Mexican striker never scored a goal with it in an official match.

An accurate penalty taker, Sánchez held the record for most penalties scored in La Liga with 56, until Cristiano Ronaldo broke the record in 2017 after scoring his 57th penalty-kick.

==Outside football==
===Personal life===

Hugo Sánchez was raised the Jardín Balbuena neighborhood in Mexico City to a middle-class family. His father, Héctor Sánchez, was also a footballer who played for Asturias F.C. and Atlante F.C. His sister, Herlinda, was an Olympic gymnast who participated in the 1976 Summer Olympic Games in Montreal. Sánchez credits her for his acrobatic skills, including his signature somersault goal celebrations.

His son, Hugo Sánchez Portugal, was also a footballer and played for UNAM and Atlante. He also has two daughters from his current marriage. On 8 November 2014, Sánchez Portugal died from the effects of a gas leak in a Mexico City apartment as stated by the Mexican Red Cross.

In 2006, Sánchez was appointed as the official FIFA/SOS Ambassador for Mexico, joining Wayne Rooney (Ambassador for England), Ruud van Nistelrooy (Netherlands), and fifty others in fund raising for the official 2006 FIFA World Cup Charity.

On 1 September 2007, Sánchez inaugurated a street with his name in Puebla, central Mexico, before a thousand of the locals around there.

===Media===
As of January 2015, Sánchez was a commentator for ESPN in Mexico and the United States. He had previously served as a guest analyst during their coverage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup before featuring as a regular analyst. He was introduced as an Ultimate Team Icon in the video game, &quot;FIFA 20&quot;.

<doc id="81290" wikidata="Q313685" url="?curid=81290" title="Folding camera">
<text>A folding camera is a camera type. Folding cameras fold into a compact and rugged package for storage. The lens and shutter are attached to a lens-board which is connected to the body of the camera by a light-tight folding bellows. When the camera is fully unfolded it provides the correct focus distance from the film. The key advantage of folding cameras is their excellent physical-size to film-size ratio when the camera is folded for storage.

Portable folding cameras dominated camera design from the 1890s to 1930s and were significant into the late 1940s. Specialized cameras such as the Polaroid SX-70 Instant film camera, and the Speed Graphic press cameras used folding designs into the 1970s.

The typical amateur camera of the early 20th Century made various &quot;postcard&quot; sized negatives around 4&quot; × 5&quot;. By the 1930s 6 cm × 9 cm cameras for either the 120 or 620 film size, were highly popular.

The use of folding cameras declined in the late 1930s with advances in lens technology allowing superior enlargement, high quality images on smaller negatives, and shorter distances between the lens and the film. 35mm film made small-sized cameras practical without using bellows. Lens technology allowed 120/620 cameras to use shorter focal distances, and the twin lens reflex cameras became popular. However, some 35mm cameras continued to be built as folding cameras, e.g., the original Kodak Retina and the Ensign Midget model 22 camera (image at lower right). Medium format folders were produced in USSR until the 1960s.

Notable folding cameras include 
*Polaroid Corporation&#x27;s line of instant film folding cameras, including the famous SX-70, a single lens reflex camera
*Seagull Camera model 203, popular throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s as an inexpensive, entry-level, medium-format camera
*Cosina Voigtländer Bessa III, a retro-style camera with a 6x6 or 6x7 frames using 120/220 medium-format films

<doc id="81291" wikidata="Q501060" url="?curid=81291" title="Monroe County, Alabama">
<text>Monroe County is a county located in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 19,772. Its county seat is Monroeville. Its name is in honor of James Monroe, fifth President of the United States. It is a dry county, in which the sale of alcoholic beverages is restricted or prohibited, but Frisco City and Monroeville are wet cities.

In 1997, the Alabama Legislature designated Monroeville and Monroe County as the &quot;Literary Capital of Alabama&quot;. It is the birthplace of notable writer Harper Lee and served as the childhood home for Truman Capote, her lifelong friend and a fellow writer. Lee lived here most of her life. The enduring popularity of her novel, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1960), as well as its film and stage adaptations, has attracted tourists to the city and area. Monroeville is also central to the 2019 film &quot;Just Mercy&quot;, based upon the 2014 eponymous book by Bryan Stevenson, recounting the wrongful conviction and sentencing to death of African American Walter McMillian.

==History==
For thousands of years the area was inhabited by indigenous peoples. In historic times, it was primarily the territory of the Muscogee or Creek peoples, who became known to European-American settlers as one of the Five Civilized Tribes of the Southeast.

The prominent Upper Creek chief Red Eagle (also known as William Weatherford), of the Wind Clan, settled here after the Creek War (1813-1814). At the time, the United States was also involved in the War of 1812 against Great Britain. Red Eagle established a successful cotton plantation. He was of Creek and European descent, and had adopted the system of chattel slavery to gain workers for his plantation and horse breeding. In the 1830s the United States forced the removal of most of the Creek people from Alabama to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), in order to take over their territory.

The area was settled by European Americans, primarily of English and Scots-Irish descent. It was largely developed as cotton plantations in the antebellum years. Planters moving from the Upper South sometimes brought slave workers with them, or purchased more slaves from traders and markets after acquiring land. The population was made up of numerous slaves, who in some sections outnumbered the whites.

Following the American Civil War and Emancipation, in the period after the Reconstruction era and into the early 20th century, white Democrats regained control of the state legislature and worked to restore and maintain white supremacy. The legislature passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites, excluding them from the political system. The legislators also passed laws imposing racial segregation and other forms of Jim Crow, and centralized power in the legislature.

===Late 19th century to present===
Physical violence by whites against blacks was part of the oppressive social system. Racial terrorism was perpetrated through lynchings of African Americans, mostly of men, which took place outside the justice system. They were often conducted as public displays on the courthouse square, spectacles attended by large white mobs in an enactment of their power. Monroe had a total of seventeen lynchings from 1877 to 1950, the second highest number of any county in Alabama.
The county seat, Monroeville, is the home of two notable 20th-century authors, Truman Capote and Nelle Harper Lee, who were childhood neighbors. The novelist Mark Childress and journalist Cynthia Tucker are also Monroe County natives. In 1997 the Alabama Legislature designated Monroeville and Monroe County as the &quot;Literary Capital of Alabama&quot;.

The county is near the Gulf Coast and is affected by storms from the Gulf. It has twice been declared a disaster area by the federal government due to extensive hurricane damage: in September 1979 due to Hurricane Frederic, and in September 2004 due to Hurricane Ivan.

Attorney Bryan Stevenson published his memoir, &quot;Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption&quot; in 2014. He has worked since his early 20s in Montgomery, establishing the Equal Justice Initiative and serving as legal counsel for people on death row in Alabama prisons. He has succeeded in gaining freedom for more than 100 men who were wrongfully convicted. Among the cases he discusses is that of Walter McMillian of Monroeville, who was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1989. McMillian, an African American man, was sentenced to death by the trial judge, who overrode the lesser sentence reached by the jury. McMillian was kept on death row for 6 years, nearly 2 of which were prior to his trial, in an effort to make him confess. In 1993 the Alabama Appeals Court ruled that McMillian should be freed because of the lack of evidence, his alibi, the unreliability of witnesses, and mishandling of the trial.

In 1935, a sharecropper called Joe Spinner Johnson was organizing sharecroppers into a union. His landlord called him away from his job, and gave him up to a gang of whites. They tied him up, beat him, and took him to Selma, where he was thrown in jail. Other prisoners heard him screaming and being beaten. A few days later, his mutilated body turned up near Greensboro.

The Perry County town of Marion was the site of a 1965 killing of an unarmed Black man, Jimmie Lee Jackson, by a white state trooper, James Bonard Fowler, which sparked the Selma to Montgomery marches. In 2008, the county voted to establish a Barack Obama Day, a legal holiday, every second Monday of November.

<text>Pickens County is a county located on the west central border of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 19,123. Its county seat is Carrollton, located in the center of the county. It is a prohibition, or dry county, although the communities of Carrollton and Aliceville voted to become wet in 2011 and 2012, respectively.

Pickens County is included in the Tuscaloosa, AL Metropolitan Statistical Area

==History==
Like the rest of Alabama, this had long been occupied by Native Americans; historically the Muscogee people (Creek) dominated this area. Pickens County was established on the western border of Alabama on December 20, 1820, and named for revolutionary war hero General Andrew Pickens of South Carolina. The county seat was relocated from Pickensville to Carrollton in 1830.

Less than one-third of the county was developed for cotton plantations, which were worked by enslaved African-Americans brought south by northern businessmen interested in cheap cotton. These plantations were developed primarily in the southernmost reaches of the county, in the lowlands along the banks of the Tombigbee River and stretching over a small prairie-like area. The rest of the county was settled by yeomen farmers who held few slaves; it was topographically unsuited for plantation-scale farming operations.

During the American Civil War, the first courthouse in Carrollton was burned on April 5, 1865, by troops of Union General John T. Croxton. Recovering from that and other damage was part of the postwar work for the county.

A second courthouse was built in Carrollton. It was destroyed by fire on November 16, 1876, during the last months of the Reconstruction era. Though arson was suspected, no arrest was made until January 1878, after white Democrats had regained control of the state legislature and the county sheriff&#x27;s office. White racial hostility toward African Americans in the county, and their efforts to retain dominance, resulted in numerous lynchings.

According to the third edition of &quot;Lynching in America&quot;, a study of lynchings of African Americans in the United States, the county had 14 documented lynchings of African Americans in Pickens County from 1877 to 1917; this is the fifth-highest total in the state. This was the period of Jim Crow and disenfranchisement of blacks throughout Alabama and the South.

Henry Wells, an African American, was arrested in January 1878 as a suspect in the courthouse arson and a burglary. He was captured in an arrest for the burglary, in which he was shot and wounded. Reportedly confessing to the courthouse arson (likely under coercion), he died five days later of his wounds. A myth associated his death with another lynching of an African-American man in this period, and an image, purportedly of Wells&#x27; face in a courthouse window. But while numerous African Americans were lynched in the courthouse square, the windows in the courthouse were not installed until February and March 1878.

In the late 19th century, there was strong hostility in Pickens County among yeomen whites against freedmen, and they committed numerous lynchings into the early 20th century. The county was a populist stronghold in the 1890s and many voters had joined the Farmers Alliance. Agricultural commissioner and populist choice Reuben F. Kolb was defeated in 1890 for the Democratic nomination for governor by Thomas G. Jones, chosen by delegates who joined to defeat Kolb. In 1892 both ran again, Kolb representing Jeffersonian Democrats, and Kolb the main Democratic Party. Kolb won in Pickens County by &quot;an immense majority&quot;. Governor Jones was re-elected, in part because of his reliance on a platform of white supremacy, to appeal to whites alarmed by Kolb&#x27;s promising to protect African-American rights. But Jones supported reform, opposing the convict lease system that trapped so many African Americans in near-slavery conditions.

Electoral unrest and populist furor in the county may have contributed to six lynchings in Carrollton in the fall of 1893. On September 14, 1893, African-American suspects Paul Archer, Will Archer, Emma Fair, Ed Guyton, and Paul Hill, were each shot to death in a mass lynching by a white mob at the courthouse jail. They had been arrested when accused of burning a mill and cotton gin owned by a white man. Their lynchings followed that of Joe Floyd, another African-American worker, two weeks before.

On August 28, 1907, African-American John Gibson was lynched in Carrollton, hanged to death in the courthouse square. John Lipsep was hanged and shot in early September 1907, a suspect in an attack on a white woman.

===20th century to present===
From 1940 to 1970, many African Americans left Pickens County to escape racial violence and oppression in the Great Migration to urban areas, as did other rural residents, because of lack of economic opportunity.

On April 8, 1998, a supercell thunderstorm produced an F3 tornado in Pickens County. This windstorm injured two people and damaged five homes including mobile homes. It rotated from Holman to north of Northport. Twenty-four homes and thirteen mobile homes were also in the path of destruction. Moments later, that same supercell thunderstorm produced an F5 tornado that struck northeastern Tuscaloosa near the Black Warrior River before entering western Jefferson County where it destroyed Oak Grove High School and killed thirty-two people in its path.

From 2000 to 2013 the county was again losing population. From July 2013 to July 2014, the population grew by 5.1%, making it the fourth-fastest growing county with at least 10,000 inhabitants. In 2014 it became the fastest-growing county in Alabama. But part of the growth was the result of the construction here of the Federal Correctional Institution, Aliceville federal women&#x27;s prison. Prisoners are included in local census numbers, as are prison employees, some of whom came from other counties.

In 2016, Black disabled veteran Sean Worsley was arrested in Pickens County for possession of prescription medical marijuana by Police Officer Carl Abramo of the Gordo Police Department. Worsley was arrested after stopping at a gas station when Abramo allegedly heard loud music and &quot;observed a black male get out of the passenger side vehicle&quot;. In 2020, Mr. Worsley was extradited from his home state in Arizona to Pickens County, where he was sentenced by a judge to 60 months in the custody of the Alabama Department of Corrections.

In 2019, Sheriff David Abston resigned as part of a plea deal with federal officials. He pleaded guilty to scamming a local food bank and his own church for food to feed county prisoners. He then was able to pocket the savings. Abston had served in the office for more than thirty years.

<text>Pike County is a county located in the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census the population was 33,009. Its county seat is Troy. Its name is in honor of General Zebulon Pike, of New Jersey, who led an expedition to southern Colorado and encountered Pikes Peak in 1806.

Pike County comprises the Troy, AL Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The area of present-day Pike County was inhabited by Native Americans from prehistoric times. Spain, France, and Great Britain all claimed the area, but except for scattered military outposts like Fort Toulouse near present-day Wetumpka, European inhabitants were concentrated along the Gulf Coast, with very few settling inland. In 1763, at the close of the French and Indian War, France ceded all the territories of New France (including what is now Pike County, Spanish claims notwithstanding) to the victorious British. In the same year, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 prohibited British subjects from settling in this area, which was reserved for the native peoples.

Between the years of 1767 and 1783, the area that is now Pike County was part of the colony of British West Florida, though still with nearly all whites concentrated in the settlements along the coast or near the Mississippi River. After the American victory in the Revolutionary War, the British ceded the territory to Spain, an American ally. However, Spain and the United States both claimed the region fell until Spain gave up its claims to the land north of the 31st parallel (present-day border of Alabama and Florida) in the Treaty of Madrid (1795). The United States organized the entire region north of that border and east of Georgia as the Mississippi Territory. In 1812, following the Louisiana Purchase, the United States unilaterally annexed the Mobile District from Spanish West Florida, most of the rest of which was acqurired with the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819 (ratified 1821).

In 1817, the Mississippi Territory was divided, with the western part admitted to the Union as the State of Mississippi; the remainder was admitted as the State of Alabama in 1819, and was soon organized into counties. Pike County is one of the oldest in the state, organized on December 17, 1821. The temporary county seat was established at the house of Andrew Townsend. Pike County comprised a large tract of country, so large that it was called the State of Pike, including a part of what are now Crenshaw, Montgomery, Macon, Bullock, and Barbour counties, and extended to the Chattahoochee River on the east.

Its name is in honor of John Randolph, a member of the United States Senate from Virginia. Randolph County was a prohibition or dry county until 2012, when the citizens of Randolph County voted to repeal prohibition.

==History==
Randolph County was established by the Alabama Legislature on December 18, 1832, following Indian Removal of the Creek people. It was named in honor of John Randolph, a well-known Virginia congressman. Randolph County was one of several counties created out of the last Creek cession formulated by the Treaty of Cusseta, on March 24, 1832. It lies within the Piedmont region, which extends from Alabama to Pennsylvania.

The first white settlers said the county had an abundance of the &quot;purest and coldest freestone water in the world.&quot; The area was also noted for its gentle rolling hills. The first county seat for Randolph County was established in 1833 at Hedgeman Triplett&#x27;s Ferry on the west bank of the Big Tallapoosa River, about west of Wedowee, Alabama.

In 1835 (2 years later), the county seat was moved by the commissioners to nearby Wedowee. This city lies in the center of Randolph County, on a fork of the Little Tallapoosa River. Wedowee was named after a Creek tribal chief &quot;Wah-wah-nee&quot; (or &quot;Wah-dow-wee&quot;) of a village here. The European-American town was developed near that site after the Creek were forced out.

The county was developed for agriculture, specifically cotton plantations, which were worked by African-American slaves brought by migrants to the region or transported from the Upper South during the domestic slave trade. It was adjacent to what became known as the Black Belt of Alabama, an area of plantation development in the uplands, where short-staple cotton was cultivated. Many African Americans stayed in the area as sharecroppers and tenant farmers after the Civil War, but left for other opportunities during the first half of the 20th century. The table below shows population declines from 1920 to 1970, reflecting this demographic change. In 2010 some 20 percent of the population was African American, reflecting this history of cotton agriculture.

<text>Russell County is a county in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 59,183. Its county seat is Phenix City. Its name is in honor of Colonel Gilbert C. Russell, who fought in the wars against the Creek Indians.

Russell County is part of the Columbus, GA-AL Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Of all counties in the United States, Russell County has the most people working in a state other than their own, at over 54% of the population, most of whom work in Columbus, Georgia.

==History==
Russell County was established by an act of the state general assembly on December 18, 1832, from lands ceded to the state by the Creek Native Americans. The county seat has changed several times: Girard (1833–1839), Crawford originally Crockettsville (1839–1868), Seale (1868–1935) and Phenix City (1935–present). It was named for War of 1812, Col. Gilbert Christian Russell Sr., 1782–1861, 3rd U.S. Infantry.

In the 1940s and 1950s, Russell County and especially its county seat, Phenix City gained a reputation of lawlessness, political corruption and being a den for vice such as organized crime, prostitution, and gambling. The city police and county deputies also took part in the corruption. In 1954, the local politician Albert Patterson won the Democratic nomination for Alabama Attorney General on a platform of ridding the city of corruption and crime. Patterson ran for a state office since he was unable to run in local elections, as they were rigged. On June 18, 1954, Patterson was shot and killed by an unknown assassin. The murder set off a series of events that led to Governor Gordon Persons declaring martial law in the county and city because of its lawlessness on July 22 that year. That was the only time since the Reconstruction era that martial law was declared in a US city for reasons other than civil unrest or natural disaster. The Alabama National Guard was called in to assume the role of the police and clean up the area of illegal activities. The state of martial law was rescinded on January 17, 1955, with Russell County and Phenix City both returning to civilian control. In 1974, the &quot;New York Times&quot; noted that the campaign was very successful and led to a relatively-low crime rate in Phenix City for the 20 years since then.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.9%) is water. The county is located in the Gulf Coastal Plain region, with a few rolling hills due to its close proximity to the fall line of the eastern United States.

<text>Shelby County is a county located in the central portion of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census the population was 223,024, making it the sixth-most populous county in Alabama. The county seat is Columbiana. Its largest city is Alabaster. The county is named in honor of Isaac Shelby, Governor of Kentucky from 1792 to 1796 and again from 1812 to 1816. Shelby County is included in the Birmingham–Hoover, AL Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Shelby County was established on February 7, 1818, and it was named for the Revolutionary War hero and the first Governor of Kentucky, Isaac Shelby. Beginning in 1820, the first county seat was located at Shelbyville. This long defunct settlement was located within the modern city limits of Pelham. The first courthouse was built of logs. The seat was moved to Columbia, now Columbiana, in 1826. Initially housed in an old school building, a new brick courthouse building was completed in 1854. It is now known as the Old Shelby County Courthouse and houses the Shelby County Museum and Archives. The current limestone courthouse was built from 1905 to 1906, at a cost of $300,000.

Shelby County has a long history in agriculture, and since about 1990, it has become an important location for growing soybeans, which has exceeded cotton as the most important crop grown there.

Shelby County was the home of an early inland waterway, the Coosa River, and it was also the location of a very early east–west railroad in Alabama that connected Atlanta, Georgia, with locations to its west. Shelby County was also crossed by an early north–south railroad, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, that connected Louisville, Nashville, Decatur, Birmingham, and Montgomery.

With the advent of the automobile and the truck, Shelby County was soon crossed from north to south by U.S. Highway 31, the major one that followed the same route as the Louisville and Nashville Railroad did. (All odd-numbered U.S. Highways are north–south routes: e.g. U.S. 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, and 71, 101, going from East to West) The eastern part of Shelby County was later crossed by U.S. Highway 231 and U.S. 280.

Decades later, Shelby County was crossed by Interstate Highway 65. Hence, an important ingredient in the eventual growth of Shelby County has been its ready access to modern systems of transportation. Interstate 65 and U.S. Highway 31 have long provided strong connections between Shelby county and the more populous Jefferson County directly to its north, leading to suburban development in towns such as Pelham, Helena, Alabaster, and Chelsea.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.0%) is water.

Parts of Shelby County are crossed by the southernmost extensions of the Appalachian Mountains, such as Oak Mountain and Double Oak Mountain. However, large parts of Shelby County are much flatter, giving good land for farms and pastures. Shelby County also has lowlands along two rivers, and one large man-made reservoir, Lay Lake, which also borders Coosa, Talladega and Chilton counties.

Most of Shelby County is drained either by the Cahaba River, which flows along the northern edge of the county, and then to the southwest, or by the Coosa River, whose valley includes the eastern end of the county. These are both important rivers in Alabama. Much farther south, both the Cahaba River and the Coosa River flow into the Alabama River, and thence to the Gulf of Mexico. To be more precise, the Coosa River and the Tallapoosa River flow together at Wetumpka, Alabama, to form the Alabama River, and then the Cahaba River is a tributary to that one farther to the west. Waxahatchee Creek, a major tributary of the Coosa River, forms the southeastern portion of the border between Shelby County and Chilton County.

==Politics==
Prior to the early 1980s, the Democratic Party dominated Shelby County politics, although at a national level the county often supported Republicans even during the &quot;Solid South&quot; era – it was one of four counties in Alabama to vote for Theodore Roosevelt over Woodrow Wilson in 1912. The county has not supported a Democrat for president since 1960, but Democrats continued to hold most offices for some time. Between 1984 and 1992, the county saw a complete reversal from Democratic dominance to Republicans in control of all but a couple of offices. It was not until the election of 2010, and specifically the results in Alabama House of Representatives District 42, that Republicans held every partisan elected office with jurisdiction or residency (or both) in Shelby County. (In Alabama, municipal officials are elected on a non-partisan basis.)













In 2013, the county was the plaintiff in &quot;Shelby County v. Holder&quot;, which struck down portions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as unconstitutional.

==Education==
Shelby County Schools operates public schools in the county. Alabaster City Schools operates the six public schools in Alabaster. In 2014, Pelham began operating their own school system with three schools taken over from the Shelby County School System: Pelham High School, Riverchase Middle School, and Valley Elementary School. On May 5, 2015, ground was broken for the construction of Pelham Ridge Elementary School which opened during the 2016–2017 school year. Also that year, Valley Elementary School closed and teachers relocated to Valley Intermediate School, renamed Pelham Oaks Elementary School (now serving kindergarten through fifth grade).

<text>Shelby County is a county in the western portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 48,230. Its county seat is Sidney. Its name honors Isaac Shelby, first governor of Kentucky. Shelby County comprises the Sidney, OH Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Dayton–Springfield–Sidney, OH Combined Statistical Area.

==History==

The Algonquian-speaking Shawnee Native Americans had come into the area in the 18th century, displacing the Ojibwa-speaking Ottawa of the Anishinaabeg, a related language group who moved northwest. The Shawnee were joined by the Iroquois, Seneca and Mingo peoples as well, displaced by colonial encroachment to the east. In 1792 the European-American pioneer John Hardin was killed by the Shawnee in Shelby County. Early settlers named the first county seat of Hardin in his memory.

Shelby County was established in 1819 from Miami County. Its original boundary included Minster and New Bremen; these were included in Auglaize County when it was created in 1848 from Shelby and Allen counties.

Several towns in Shelby County were established by German immigrants. The Miami and Erie Canal, which reached Shelby County in 1841, provided jobs for many of the county&#x27;s European immigrants. It also changed the way new immigrants traveled to Shelby County from Cincinnati in the south and by 1845, Lake Erie in the north. The actual construction provided the initial boost; the real benefit proved to be the opportunity for increased commerce presented by this new transportation link. The canal brought a business boom which in turn drove farm product prices to previously unknown heights. As German immigrants arrived to work on the canal, on the land, and in the shops, business in Sidney and Shelby County expanded. The Germans&#x27; penchant for thrift proved to be a valuable asset to the area&#x27;s economic and social growth. Sidney&#x27;s population increased from 713 in 1840 to 1,284 by 1850. During this period, the residents’ national origins went from being almost entirely English, or of English descent, to at least fifty percent German and Alsatian French. There were also many families from England who arrived as immigrants in the 19th century. Those English immigrants were of working class rural origins; it was easier for working-class people to own land in America and by this time parts of the United States also had the practice of universal male suffrage so all men over the age of 18, regardless of property or wealth were allowed to vote. These factors encouraged English immigration, particularly from the villages of Penkridge, Gailey, Lapley, Wheaton Aston, Bishop&#x27;s Wood, Brewood, Coven, Featherstone, Essington, Four Ashes, Perton, Pattingham, Seisdon, Wombourne, Himley, Swindon and Enville, in south Staffordshire in central England, and for this reason these immigrants were sometimes known as &quot;the Staffordshire settlers&quot;.

In 1846, a group of 383 free blacks from Virginia, called the &quot;Randolph Slaves&quot;, settled in the county, most at Rumley, Ohio. They had been freed by the 1833 will of Virginia planter John Randolph of Roanoke. He provided money for their transportation and resettlement on land in a free state. Their gaining freedom was delayed by court challenges to Randolph&#x27;s will, but the families were freed and traveled in 1846. Randolph had provided that those over the age of 40 were given 10 acres each for resettlement. A contemporary history described the Rumley settlement: &quot;There are 400 Negroes (half the population of Van Buren Township) as prosperous as their white neighbors and equal to the whites in morals, religion and intelligence.&quot; In 1900 survivors and descendants formed Randolph Ex-Slaves Association (later Randolph Slave Association) and held their first reunion at Midway Park near Piqua. Sixty-two of the original settlers attended who had been born in Virginia into slavery. After being manumitted, they had come to Ohio as small children with their families. They were called the &quot;Old Dominions&quot; after the nickname of Virginia; the &quot;Buckeyes&quot; were those descendants born in Ohio. Over the years, the reunions were also held at Troy and the Shelby County Fairgrounds, with 100–300 attending.

==Geography==
Terrain of Shelby County consists of low rolling hills, entirely devoted to agriculture or urban development. The Great Miami River enters from Logan County near the county&#x27;s midpoint, and flows west-southwest-southward to exit into Miami County near the midpoint of its south borderline. The county&#x27;s highest point ( ASL) is at its SE corner, where it abuts Champaign and Miami counties. According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.7%) is water.

<text>Shelby County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kentucky. As of the 2020 census, the population was 48,065. Its county seat is Shelbyville. The county was established in 1792 and named for Isaac Shelby, the first Governor of Kentucky.
Shelby County is part of the Louisville/Jefferson County, KY–IN Metropolitan Statistical Area. Shelby County&#x27;s motto is &quot;Good Land, Good Living, Good People&quot;.

==History==
Shelby County was founded in 1792 from land given by Jefferson County.

Another early settler was Thomas Mitchell, who also moved to Shelby County in 1784. Mitchell was born on December 16, 1777, in Augusta County, Virginia. He married Rebecca Ketcham, daughter of Daniel Ketcham, and settled near the headwaters of South Fork Clear Creek (or Mulberry Creek). Mitchell was commissioned an ensign in the 18th Regiment of Militia and on January 4, 1801, Governor James Garrard became a captain in the 18th Regiment. Mitchell was a minister of the Methodist Church and served in the War of 1812.

==Economy==
Sumter County is part of the so-called Black Belt region of central Alabama. The region has suffered significant economic depression in recent years, but in April 2008, United States Steel announced plans to build at $150 million alloy plant near the community of Epes about southwest of Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

The plant would require 250 workers to construct in a town of only 206. Up to 235 full-time jobs would be created when completed, with jobs paying about $50,000 annually. The state of Alabama offered $28 million in incentives to get the plant located in Sumter County. The plant would make use of a new technology that produces a carbon alloy for use in steel making at the U.S. Steel plant in Fairfield, Alabama near Birmingham. 
At the time of the announcement, the unemployment rate in Sumter County was 6.1%.

In November 2008, U.S. Steel spokesman D. John Armstrong announced that plans to build the Epes facility had been placed on hold. “We’ve adjusted the timing of it, and we don’t know what the new timeline will be,” he said. “We’ve delayed construction, but we have not cancelled it.“

To date, the Epes facility has not been built.

From 2009 to 2013, the county had a median household income of $22,186 compared to a state figure of $45,253, making it the poorest county in the state. By 2015, Sumter County remained the poorest county in Alabama, with a median household income of $19,501 in comparison to the state median household income of $43,623.

==Education==
===Colleges and universities===
The University of West Alabama is in Livingston.

===Primary and secondary schools===
The school district serving the county is Sumter County School District. In addition, a charter school is located on the campus of the University of West Alabama, University Charter School.

Until 2017, all schools in Sumter County were in practice entirely racially segregated, as white parents sent their children to Sumter Academy, a private segregation academy set up in 1970 in the wake of a federal court ruling ordering the school district to desegregate. During the 2015–16 school year, 98% of the 1,593 students in county&#x27;s public schools were black, while none of the 170 students at Sumter Academy were black. However, Sumter Academy closed in June 2017, while in August 2018, University Charter School opened, with a half-black, half-white enrollment, making it the county&#x27;s first practically desegregated school.

Sumter has long been solidly Democratic, having voted in presidential elections for a Republican only once this past century.

The name Talladega is derived from a Muscogee (Creek) Native American word &quot;Tvlvteke,&quot; from the Creek &quot;tålwa&quot;, meaning &quot;town&quot;, and &quot;åtigi&quot;, or &quot;border&quot; – &quot;Border Town&quot; – a town indicating its location on the boundary between the lands of the Creek tribe and those of the Cherokee and Chickasaw.

==History==
In 1832, Tallapoosa County was created from lands ceded by the Creek Indians in the Treaty of Cusseta. The first county seat was the Creek town of Okfuskee. The forced removal of the Creeks in 1836 and 1837 was followed by a frantic gold rush, bringing a flood of profit seekers and settlers.

Established on December 18, 1832. Tallapoosa County&#x27;s southwest strip of the county was detached from Tallapoosa County to become a portion of Elmore County when it was established on February 15, 1866.
