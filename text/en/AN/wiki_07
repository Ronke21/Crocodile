<text>Jeanne Mathilde Sauvé (; April 26, 1922 – January 26, 1993) was a Canadian politician, journalist and stateswoman who served as the 23rd governor general of Canada from 1984 to 1990 and as the 29th speaker of the House of Commons from 1980 to 1984. She was the first woman to hold either office, and is to date the only woman to serve as speaker of the House of Commons.

Sauvé was born in Prud&#x27;homme, Saskatchewan, and educated in Ottawa and Paris, prior to working as a journalist for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). She was then elected to the House of Commons in 1972, whereafter she served as a minister of the Crown until 1980, when she became the Speaker. She was in 1984 appointed by Queen Elizabeth II as the 23rd governor general since Canadian Confederation, on the recommendation of Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Trudeau, to replace Edward Schreyer as vicereine, and she occupied the post until succeeded by Ray Hnatyshyn in 1990. She was the first woman to serve as Canada&#x27;s governor general and, while her appointment as the Queen&#x27;s representative was initially and generally welcomed, Sauvé caused some controversy during her time as vicereine, mostly due to increased security around the office, as well as an anti-monarchist attitude towards the position.

On November 27, 1972, Sauvé was sworn into the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. She subsequently founded and worked with the Sauvé Foundation until her death, caused by Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, on January 26, 1993.

The highest trophy for the Canadian Ringette Championships, the major national competition for the sport of ringette, is named in her honour. Initially called the Jeanne Sauvé Cup, it was post-humously renamed the Jeanne Sauvé Memorial Cup.

==Early life, youth, and first career==
Sauvé was born in the Fransaskois community of Prud&#x27;homme, Saskatchewan, to Charles Albert Benoît and Anna Vaillant, and three years later moved with them to Ottawa, where her family had previously lived. In Ottawa, her father would take her to see the bronze bust on Parliament Hill of Canada&#x27;s first female Member of Parliament (MP), Agnes Macphail. Sauvé studied at Notre Dame du Rosaire Convent in Ottawa, becoming head of her class in her first year, and continued her education at the University of Ottawa, working for the government of Canada as a translator in order to pay her tuition. At the same time, Sauvé actively involved herself in student and political affairs; at the age of 20, she became the national president of the Young Catholic Students Group, which employed her in 1942, necessitating her move to Montreal.
It was there that Sauvé met Maurice Sauvé, and the two married on September 24, 1948, the same year the couple moved to London; Maurice had obtained a scholarship to the London School of Economics, and Sauvé worked as a teacher and tutor. Two years later, they moved to Paris, where Sauvé was employed as the assistant to the director of the Youth Secretariat at UNESCO, and in 1951, she enrolled for one year at the Sorbonne, graduating with a degree in French civilization. Sauvé and her husband returned to Canada near the end of 1952, where the couple settled in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, and in 1959 had one child, Jean-François. Sauvé then became a founding member of the Institute of Political Research and was hired as a journalist and broadcaster with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s French-language broadcaster, Radio-Canada.

After success on her first radio programme, &quot;Fémina&quot;, Sauvé was moved to CBC television and focused her efforts on covering political topics on both radio and television, in both English and French. She soon drew attention to herself and was frequently invited by her friend Gérard Pelletier as a panellist on the controversial show &quot;Les Idées en Marche&quot;, there revealing her left-wing political ideologies. This absorption of a woman into the traditionally male world of political journalism and commentary was unusual, yet Sauvé managed to be taken seriously, even being given her own television show, &quot;Opinions&quot;, which covered &quot;such taboo subjects as teenage sex, parental authority, and student discipline&quot;. On air from 1956 to 1963, &quot;it was the show that made Jeanne famous&quot;. However, Sauvé also attracted negative attention due to her husband&#x27;s eventual elevation as a Crown minister; in a piece in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Progressive Conservative MP Louis-Joseph Pigeon expressed concern over the wife of a minister being paid &quot;fabulous sums by the CBC&quot;, calling the circumstances a &quot;shame and a scandal&quot;.

==Parliamentary career==

It was the Liberal Party that wooed Sauvé into politics, asking her to run as a candidate in the Montreal riding of Ahuntsic during the 1972 federal election. Though she found campaigning arduous, saying: &quot;I felt uneasy for the first time in my life when I was campaigning ... I must say I had qualms about it myself&quot;, Sauvé won, becoming one of five female MPs. She was subsequently both sworn into the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council and appointed as Minister of State for Science and Technology in the Cabinet chaired by Pierre Trudeau, thus becoming the first woman from Quebec to become a minister of the Crown and the sole female in that Cabinet. Sauvé ran again in the election two years later, re-winning Ahuntsic, and was given the environment portfolio until 1975, when she was appointed Minister of Communications.

In the 1979 election, Sauvé won the riding of Laval-des-Rapides, but the Liberals lost their majority in the commons to the Progressive Conservative Party; she thus lost her Cabinet position. She remained MP for her riding after the federal election of 1980, which saw both the Liberals returned to majority position.

===Speaker of the House of Commons===
Trudeau returned to position of prime minister in the 32nd Canadian Parliament, and selected Sauvé as his choice for the speaker of the House of Commons. Because she strongly desired to campaign for the &quot;No&quot; forces in the weeks leading up to Quebec&#x27;s 1980 referendum on separation from Canada, Sauvé initially refused the offer to run for the non-partisan position. But she eventually acquiesced after Trudeau convinced her that she was the right person for the job and she received permission from the leaders of all the parties in the House of Commons to engage in the federalist campaign in Quebec. She became the first female Speaker of the House.

In her early days as speaker, Sauvé often made mistakes with the names of MPs or the ridings they represented—once calling on the Prime Minister as the &quot;leader of the opposition&quot;—and occasionally miscarried procedural rulings, which led to MPs addressing her with increasing curtness. Further, all 32 of the New Democratic Party MPs in the house walked out in protest of what they viewed as a bias on Sauvé&#x27;s part; they felt she allowed Liberal MPs to ask more questions than those from any other party. In a CBC interview, Sauvé conceded that the NDP members may have been right that the Liberals may have been allowed more questions over two or three days, but, on the whole, each party received an equal number of opportunities. It was also speculated that MPs had taken to showboating for the television cameras that had recently been installed in the chamber.

Sauvé did, however, find success in implementing reforms that professionalised the speaker&#x27;s tasks of managing expenses and staff for the House of Commons, cutting back on the excess bureaucracy, personnel, overtime waste, and costs she discovered upon her installation. Once the changes were made, Sauvé had reduced the commons&#x27; support personnel by 300 and saved $18 million out of the annual expenses, all of which, to some, actually improved overall service. Sauvé was lauded, by MPs and the media alike, for her courage in challenging the establishment. Other MPs, though, stated that she had gone too far and balked at the resulting inconveniences, such as having to clear their own plates in the commons cafeteria. At the same time, Sauvé also established the first daycare for Parliament Hill staff, MPs, and senators.

She also presided over debates on the constitution, dealing with filibusters and numerous points of order, as well as discussions over the proposed Energy Security Act, against which the loyal opposition mounted a counter-campaign that culminated in a two-week bell-ringing episode when the Conservatives&#x27; Whip refused to appear in the Commons to indicate that the opposition was ready for a vote. Despite pressure from the government that she intervene to break the deadlock, Sauvé maintained that it was up to the parties to resolve it themselves through negotiation.

==Governor General of Canada==
Sauvé was the first female governor general in Canada&#x27;s history, and only the second woman amongst all the Commonwealth realms—both previous and contemporary to the time—to assume the equivalent office, after Elmira Minita Gordon, who was in 1981 appointed Governor-General of Belize.

===As governor general-designate===
It was in December 1983 announced from the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada that Trudeau had put forward Sauvé&#x27;s name to Queen Elizabeth II as his recommendation on who should succeed Edward Schreyer as governor general of Canada. In the national media, the reception was generally positive, with Sauvé&#x27;s elegance, refined nature, and bilingualism viewed as an asset to such a posting, despite speculation regarding her ability to remain non-partisan, as would be expected of the vicereine. However, by January 15, of the following year Sauvé resigned as an MP, and thus as speaker, and two days later she was hospitalised; rumours circulated that it was due to cancer, but the official story was that she had contracted a respiratory virus, which was further complicated by an allergy to antibiotics.

Still, Queen Elizabeth II, by commission under the royal sign-manual and Great Seal of Canada, appointed on January 28, 1984, Trudeau&#x27;s recommendation that she appoint Sauvé as her representative. However, the latter remained in hospital, and her illness only worsened, leading colleagues to believe that she would die, and the Canadian Press and CBC to draft preliminary obituaries. Sauvé did recover, and was released from care on March 3, though the illness had delayed her installation ceremony, which had been scheduled to take place that month. Sauvé remained secretive about the exact nature of the illness, and did not pay attention to rumours that she had developed Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, stating in interviews that it was a private matter, and that she was well enough to uphold her responsibilities.

===In office===

Sauvé was sworn in as governor general on May 14, 1984 in a ceremony in the Senate chamber, during which Trudeau said: &quot;It is right and proper that Her Majesty should finally have a woman representative here&quot;, though stressing that the Queen had not appointed Sauvé simply because she was a woman. Almost immediately, Sauvé made it clear that she would use her time as governor general to promote issues surrounding youth and world peace, as well as that of national unity.

As governor general, Sauvé kept up to date with Cabinet papers and met every two weeks with her successive prime ministers. She would not speak openly about her relationship with these individuals, but there was reported friction between Sauvé and Brian Mulroney, whom she had appointed as prime minister in 1984. It was speculated Sauvé disapproved of the way Mulroney elevated the stature of his office with more presidential trappings and aura, as exemplified by his insistence that he alone greet U.S. President Ronald Reagan upon his arrival at Quebec City for the colloquially dubbed &quot;Shamrock Summit&quot;. This was taken by the media as a snub against Sauvé who, as the head of state&#x27;s direct representative, would otherwise have welcomed another head of state to Canada. 

She did, however, greet members of the royal family, including the Queen and her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother; and the Duke and Duchess of York. Prince Edward met with Sauvé at Rideau Hall on June 4, 1988 to present her with royal Letters Patent permitting the governor general to exercise the Queen&#x27;s powers in respect of the granting of heraldic arms in Canada, leading to the eventual creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, of which Sauvé was the first head. Among foreign visitors welcomed by Sauvé were King Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, King Hussein of Jordan, Pope John Paul II, Secretary-General of the United Nations Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, French President François Mitterrand, Chinese President Li Xiannian, Romanian President Nicolae Ceauşescu, Mother Teresa, and, eventually, President Reagan. A number of these state visits were reciprocated when Sauvé travelled to represent the Queen in Italy, the Vatican, China, Thailand, France, Uruguay, and Brazil.

Also in her capacity as governor general, in 1986 Sauvé accepted, on behalf of the &quot;People of Canada&quot;, the Nansen Medal and, two years later, opened the XV Olympic Winter Games in Calgary, Alberta. One of her favourite events to host was the annual Christmas party for the Ottawa Boys &amp; Girls Club and its French-language counterpart, the Patro d&#x27;Ottawa; the children came to Rideau Hall to visit with Santa Claus and attended a lunch in the Tent Room. Sauvé personally hosted and wore a paper party hat to celebrate the special occasion.

Ironically, as with the speculations about Sauvé&#x27;s standing in protocol vis-a-vis Mulroney, she was herself accused of elevating her position above its traditional place; she was criticised for her own presidentialisation of the viceregal post, with pundits at the time saying she occupied &quot;Republican Hall&quot;. For instance, it was revealed that Sauvé&#x27;s staff had meddled in Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan Frederick Johnson&#x27;s plans to host a dinner at Government House in Regina, at which the Governor General was to be a guest. Further, municipal event organisers were told that singing of God Save the Queen, the Canadian royal anthem, was not allowed and the loyal toast to the Queen was to be replaced with a toast to Sauvé, all of which not only disregarded precedent but also grated on prairie sensitivities.

In her final address in office, at Christmas, 1989, some of Sauvé&#x27;s words were perceived as veiled warning about the failure of the Meech Lake Accord and she was criticised for this suspected breach of neutrality. The Premier of Newfoundland at the time, Clyde Wells, said it was &quot;inappropriate for the Crown to be intruding in political affairs that way&quot; and Bill Dawson, a law professor at the University of Western Ontario, described Sauvé&#x27;s use of the word &quot;pact&quot; as &quot;injudicious&quot;. This was a subject on which Sauvé and the Queen agreed, as the Queen had also publicly expressed on October 22 and 23, 1987 her personal support for the accord and received criticism from its opponents. Sauvé, though, always held that she had been speaking about Canadian unity in general and not the Meech Lake Accord in particular, or any side of the debate around it.

===Legacy===
During her time as governor general, Sauvé established in commemoration of her state visit to Brazil the Governor General Jeanne Sauvé Fellowship, awarded each year to a Brazilian graduate student in Canadian studies. She also created two awards for students entering the field of special education and subsequently created the Sauvé Foundation in 2003 &quot;to develop the leadership potential of promising youth from around the world&quot;, which was dedicated to the cause of youth excellence in Canada and is today headed by Jean-François. The Sauvé Scholars Program has brought groups of up to fourteen young people with demonstrated leadership potential each year to Montreal, where they attend classes at McGill University, work on individual projects and &quot;enlarge their understanding of the world&quot;. The Sauvé Scholars, who have come from 44 countries around the world, enjoy a unique residential program at Maison Jeanne Sauvé, which constitutes a key part of their experience.

For sporting endeavours, Sauvé formed the Jeanne Sauvé Trophy, for the world cup championship in women&#x27;s field hockey, and the Jeanne Sauvé Fair Play Award, to recognise national amateur athletes who best demonstrate fair play and non-violence in sport. Further, Sauvé encouraged a safer society in Canada by establishing the Governor General&#x27;s Award for Safety in the Workplace.

In 1983, then President of the national organization for the sport of ringette in Canada, Ringette Canada, Betty Shields, had the trophy for the Canadian Ringette Championships named in her honour. The trophy was initiated in December 1984 and was first presented at the 1985 Canadian Ringette Championships in Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Québec. While Sauvé was alive the trophy was called the Jeanne Sauvé Cup. Post-humously it was renamed the Jeanne Sauvé Memorial Cup, which remains the trophy&#x27;s namesake today.

Though there was some criticism in the final evaluations of her performance as governor general, mostly for a perceived aloofness and sense of self-importance—which her closing of the Rideau Hall estate to the public came to symbolise—Sauvé was also described as having been elegant, charming, and a person who could mingle well with common Canadians—especially children—while also maintaining a sense of the dignity of state. She was said to have enjoyed both entertaining and ceremony, two necessary parts of the role of the Queen&#x27;s representative. However, she was pointed out unfavourably by Canadian monarchists for her republican attitudes, as illustrated in her stated opinion that the monarchy should be abolished.

==Retirement and death==
After departing Rideau Hall for the last time as governor general in 1990, Sauvé and her husband returned to Montreal, where she continued to work with the Sauvé Foundation. Only two years later, however, Maurice died, and Sauvé followed him on January 26, 1993, after a long battle with Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. The couple were both interred in Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal, and, one year following her death, Canada Post issued a postage stamp bearing an image of Sauvé.

<text>In a literary work, film, or other narrative, the plot is the mapping of events in which each one (except the final) affects at least one other through the principle of cause-and-effect. The causal events of a plot can be thought of as a selective collection of events from a narrative, all linked by the connector &quot;and so&quot;. Simple plots, such as in a traditional ballad, can be linearly sequenced, but plots can form complex interwoven structures, with each part sometimes referred to as a subplot.

Plot is similar in meaning to the term &quot;storyline&quot;. In the narrative sense, the term highlights important points which have consequences within the story, according to American science fiction writer Ansen Dibell. The premise sets up the plot, and the setting also influences the final story. An can convolute the plot based on a misunderstanding. The term &quot;plot&quot; can also serve as a verb, as part of the craft of writing, referring to the writer devising and ordering story events. (A related meaning is a character&#x27;s planning of future actions in the story.)

The term &quot;plot&quot;, however, in common usage (e.g., a &quot;film plot&quot;) more often refers to a narrative summary, or story .

== Definition ==
Early 20th-century English novelist E. M. Forster described plot as the cause-and-effect relationship between events in a story. According to Forster, &quot;&quot;The king died, and then the queen died,&quot; is a story, while &quot;The king died, and then the queen died of grief,&quot; is a plot.&quot;

Teri Shaffer Yamada, Ph.D., of CSULB, agrees that a plot does not include memorable scenes within a story that do not relate directly to other events but only &quot;major events that move the action in a narrative.&quot; For example, in the 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot;, when Rose climbs on the railing at the front of the ship and spreads her hands as if she&#x27;s flying, this scene is memorable but does not directly influence other events, so it may not be considered as part of the plot. Another example of a memorable scene that is not part of the plot occurs in the 1980 film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, when Han Solo is frozen in carbonite.

=== Fabula and syuzhet ===
The literary theory of Russian Formalism in the early 20th century divided a narrative into two elements: the &quot;fabula&quot; (фа́була) and the &quot;syuzhet&quot; (сюже́т). A fabula is the chronology of the fictional world, whereas a syuzhet is a perspective or plot thread of those events. Formalist followers eventually translated the fabula/syuzhet to the concept of story/plot. This definition is usually used in narratology, in parallel with Forster&#x27;s definition. The &quot;fabula&quot; (story) is what happened in chronological order. In contrast, the &quot;syuzhet&quot; (plot) means a unique sequence of discourse that was sorted out by the (implied) author. That is, the syuzhet can consist of picking up the fabula events in non-chronological order; for example, fabula is , syuzhet is .

The Russian formalist, Viktor Shklovsky, viewed the syuzhet as the fabula defamiliarized. Defamiliarization or &quot;making strange,&quot; a term Shklovsky coined and popularized, upends familiar ways of presenting a story, slows down the reader&#x27;s perception, and makes the story appear unfamiliar. Shklovsky cites Lawrence Sterne&#x27;s Tristram Shandy as an example of a fabula that has been defamiliarized. Sterne uses temporal displacements, digressions, and causal disruptions (for example, placing the effects before their causes) to slow down the reader&#x27;s ability to reassemble the (familiar) story. As a result, the syuzhet &quot;makes strange&quot; the fabula.

== Examples ==

=== Cinderella ===
A story orders events from beginning to end in a time sequence.

Consider the following events in the European folk tale &quot;Cinderella&quot;:

#The prince searches for Cinderella with the glass shoe
#Cinderella&#x27;s sisters try the shoe on themselves but it does not fit them
#The shoe fits Cinderella&#x27;s foot so the prince finds her

The first event is causally related to the third event, while the second event, though descriptive, does not directly impact the outcome. As a result, according to Ansen Dibell, the plot can be described as the first event &quot;and so&quot; the last event, while the story can be described by all three events in order.

===&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;===

Fiction-writing coach Steve Alcorn says that the main plot elements of the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; are easy to find, and include:

# A tornado picks up a house and drops it on a witch in a fantastical land
# A girl and her dog meet three interesting traveling companions
# A wizard sends them on a mission
# They melt another witch with a bucket of water

=== Structure and treatment ===
Dramatic structure is the philosophy by which the story is split and how the story is thought of. This can vary by ethnicity, region and time period. This can be applied to books, plays, and films. Philosophers/critics who have discussed story structure include Aristotle, Horace, Aelius Donatus, Gustav Freytag, Kenneth Thorpe Rowe, Lajos Egri, Syd Field, and others. Some story structures are so old that the originator cannot be found, such as Ta&#x27;zieh.

Often in order to sell a script, the &quot;plot structure&quot; is made into what is called a &quot;treatment&quot;. This can vary based on locality, but for Europe and European Diaspora, the &quot;three-act structure&quot; is often used. The components of this structure are the &quot;set-up&quot;, the &quot;confrontation&quot; and the &quot;resolution&quot;. Acts are connected by two plot points or turning points, with the first turning point connecting Act I to Act II, and the second connecting Act II to Act III. The conception of the three-act structure has been attributed to American screenwriter Syd Field who described plot structure in this tripartite way for film analysis.

Furthermore, in order to sell a book within the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, often the plot structure is split into a synopsis. Again the plot structure may vary by genre or drama structure used.

==== Aristotle ====
Many scholars have analyzed dramatic structure, beginning with Aristotle in his &quot;Poetics&quot; (c. 335 BC).

In his &quot;Poetics&quot;, a theory about tragedies, the Greek philosopher Aristotle put forth the idea the play should imitate a single whole action. &quot;A whole is what has a beginning and middle and end&quot; (1450b27). He split the play into two acts: complication and denouement. He mainly used Sophocles to make his argument about the proper dramatic structure of a play.

Two types of scenes are of special interest: the reversal, which throws the action in a new direction, and the recognition, meaning the protagonist has an important revelation. Reversals should happen as a necessary and probable cause of what happened before, which implies that turning points need to be properly set up. He ranked the order of importance of the play to be: Chorus, Events, Diction, Character, Spectacle. And that all plays should be able to be performed from memory, long and easy to understand. He was against character-centric plots stating “The Unity of a Plot does not consist, as some suppose, in its having one man as its subject.” He was against episodic plots. He held that discovery should be the high point of the play and that the action should teach a moral that is reenforced by pity, fear and suffering. The spectacle, not the characters themselves would give rise to the emotions. The stage should also be split into “Prologue, Episode, Exode, and a choral portion, distinguished into Parode and Stasimon...“

Unlike later, he held that the morality was the center of the play and what made it great. Unlike popular belief, he did not come up with the three act structure popularly known.

==== Gustav Freytag ====

The German playwright and novelist Gustav Freytag wrote &quot;Die Technik des Dramas&quot;, a definitive study of the five-act dramatic structure, in which he laid out what has come to be known as Freytag&#x27;s pyramid. Under Freytag&#x27;s pyramid, the plot of a story consists of five parts:
# Exposition (originally called introduction)
# Rising action (rise)
# Climax
# Falling action (return or fall)
# Catastrophe, denouement, resolution, or revelation or &quot;rising and sinking&quot;. Freytag is indifferent as to which of the contending parties justice favors; in both groups, good and evil, power and weakness, are mingled.

A drama is then divided into five parts, or acts, which some refer to as a : exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and catastrophe. Freytag extends the five parts with three moments or crises: the exciting force, the tragic force, and the force of the final suspense. The exciting force leads to the rising action, the tragic force leads to the falling action, and the force of the final suspense leads to the catastrophe. Freytag considers the exciting force to be necessary but the tragic force and the force of the final suspense are optional. Together, they make the eight component parts of the drama.

In making his argument, he attempts to retcon much of the Greeks and Shakespeare by making opinions of what they meant, but did not actually say.

He argued for tension created through contrasting emotions, but did not actively argue for conflict. He argued that character comes first in plays. He also set up the groundwork for what would later be called the inciting incident.

Overall, Freytag argued the center of a play is emotionality and the best way to get that emotionality is to put contrasting emotions back to back. He laid some of the foundations for centering the hero, unlike Aristotle. He is popularly attributed to have stated conflict at the center of his plays, but he argues actively against continuing conflict.

Freytag defines the parts as:

;Introduction: The setting is fixed in a particular place and time, the mood is set, and characters are introduced. A backstory may be alluded to. Exposition can be conveyed through dialogues, flashbacks, characters&#x27; asides, background details, in-universe media, or the narrator telling a back-story.
;Rise: An exciting force begins immediately after the exposition (introduction), building the rising action in one or several stages toward the point of greatest interest. These events are generally the most important parts of the story since the entire plot depends on them to set up the climax and ultimately the satisfactory resolution of the story itself.
;Climax: The climax is the turning point, which changes the protagonist&#x27;s fate. If things were going well for the protagonist, the plot will turn against them, often revealing the protagonist&#x27;s hidden weaknesses. If the story is a comedy, the opposite state of affairs will ensue, with things going from bad to good for the protagonist, often requiring the protagonist to draw on hidden inner strengths. A plot with an exciting climax is said to be &quot;climactic.&quot; A disappointing scene is instead called &quot;anticlimactic.&quot;
;Return or Fall: During the Return, the hostility of the counter-party beats upon the soul of the hero. Freytag lays out two rules for this stage: the number of characters be limited as much as possible, and the number of scenes through which the hero falls should be fewer than in the rising movement. The falling action may contain a moment of final suspense: Although the catastrophe must be foreshadowed so as not to appear as a non sequitur, there could be for the doomed hero a prospect of relief, where the final outcome is in doubt.
;Catastrophe: The catastrophe (&quot;Katastrophe&quot; in the original) is where the hero meets his logical destruction. Freytag warns the writer not to spare the life of the hero. More generally, the final result of a work&#x27;s main plot has been known in English since 1705 as the denouement (, ;). It comprises events from the end of the falling action to the actual ending scene of the drama or narrative. Conflicts are resolved, creating normality for the characters and a sense of catharsis, or release of tension and anxiety, for the reader. Etymologically, the French word () is derived from the word , &quot;to untie&quot;, from , Latin for &quot;knot.&quot; It is the unraveling or untying of the complexities of a plot.

=== Plot devices ===

A &quot;plot device&quot; is a means of advancing the plot in a story. It is often used to motivate characters, create urgency, or resolve a difficulty. This can be contrasted with moving a story forward with dramatic technique; that is, by making things happen because characters take action for well-developed reasons. An example of a plot device would be when the cavalry shows up at the last moment and saves the day in a battle. In contrast, an adversarial character who has been struggling with himself and saves the day due to a change of heart would be considered dramatic technique.

Familiar types of plot devices include the &quot;deus ex machina&quot;, the MacGuffin, the red herring, and Chekhov&#x27;s gun.

=== Plot outline ===
A &quot;plot outline&quot; is a prose telling of a story which can be turned into a screenplay. Sometimes it is called a &quot;one page&quot; because of its length. In comics, the roughs refer to a stage in the development where the story has been broken down very loosely in a style similar to storyboarding in film development. This stage is also referred to as storyboarding or layouts. In Japanese manga, this stage is called the &quot;nēmu&quot; (, pronounced like the English word &quot;name&quot;). The roughs are quick sketches arranged within a suggested page layout. The main goals of roughs are to:

* lay out the flow of panels across a page
* ensure the story successfully builds suspense
* work out points of view, camera angles, and character positions within panels
* serve as a basis for the next stage of development, the &quot;pencil&quot; stage, where detailed drawings are produced in a more polished layout which will, in turn, serve as the basis for the inked drawings.

In fiction writing, a plot outline gives a list of scenes. Scenes include events, character(s) and setting. Plot, therefore, shows the cause and effect of these things put together. The plot outline is a rough sketch of this cause and effect made by the scenes to lay out a &quot;solid backbone and structure&quot; to show why and how things happened as they did.

=== Plot summary ===
A &quot;plot summary&quot; is a brief description of a piece of literature that explains what happens. In a plot summary, the author and title of the book should be referred to and it is usually no more than a paragraph long while summarizing the main points of the story.

=== A-Plot ===
An &quot;A-Plot&quot; is a cinema and television term referring to the plotline that drives the story. This does not necessarily mean it is the most important, but rather the one that forces most of the action.

<text>My Darling Clementine is a 1946 American Western film directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda as Wyatt Earp during the period leading up to the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The ensemble cast also features Victor Mature (as Doc Holliday), Linda Darnell, Walter Brennan, Tim Holt, Cathy Downs and Ward Bond.

The title of the movie is borrowed from the theme song &quot;Oh My Darling, Clementine&quot;, sung in parts over the opening and closing credits. The screenplay is based on the biography &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot; by Stuart Lake, as were two earlier movies, both named &quot;Frontier Marshal&quot; (released in 1934 and 1939, respectively). 

&quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; is regarded by many film critics as one of the best Westerns ever made. In 1991, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. It was among the third annual group of 25 films named to the registry.

== Plot ==
In 1882 (a year after the actual gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881), Wyatt, Morgan, Virgil, and James Earp are driving cattle to California when they encounter Old Man Clanton and his sons. Clanton offers to buy their herd, but they curtly refuse to sell. When the Earps learn about the nearby boom town of Tombstone, the older brothers ride in, leaving the youngest, James, as watchman. The threesome soon learns that Tombstone is a lawless town without a marshal. Wyatt proves the only man in the town willing to face a drunken Indian shooting at the townspeople. When the brothers return to their camp, they find their cattle rustled and James murdered.

Wyatt returns to Tombstone. Seeking to avenge James&#x27;s murder, he takes the open position of town marshal and encounters the hot-tempered Doc Holliday and scurrilous Clanton gang several times. During this time, Clementine Carter, Doc&#x27;s former love interest from his hometown of Boston, arrives after a long search for her beau. She is given a room at the same hotel where both Wyatt and Doc Holliday reside.

Chihuahua, a hot-tempered Latina love interest of Doc&#x27;s, sings in the local saloon. She runs afoul of Wyatt, trying to tip a professional gambler off to his poker hand, resulting in Wyatt&#x27;s dunking her in a horse trough. Doc, who is suffering badly from tuberculosis and had fled from Clementine previously, is unhappy with her arrival; he tells her to return to Boston or he will leave Tombstone. Clementine stays, so Doc leaves for Tucson, Arizona. Wyatt, who has been taken by Clementine since her arrival, begins to awkwardly court her. Angry over Doc&#x27;s hasty flight, Chihuahua starts an argument with Clementine. Wyatt walks in on their spat and breaks it up. He notices Chihuahua is wearing a silver cross that had been taken from his brother James the night he&#x27;d been killed. She claims Doc gave it to her.

Wyatt chases down Doc, with whom he has had a testy relationship. Doc forces a shoot-out, ending with Wyatt&#x27;s shooting a pistol out of Doc&#x27;s hand. The two return to Tombstone, where after being questioned, Chihuahua reveals the silver cross was actually given to her by Billy Clanton. During the interrogation, Billy shoots Chihuahua through a window and takes off on horseback, but is wounded by Wyatt. Wyatt directs his brother Virgil to pursue him. The chase leads to the Clanton homestead, where Billy dies of his wounds. Old Man Clanton then shoots Virgil in the back in cold blood.

In town, a reluctant Doc is persuaded to operate on Chihuahua. Hope swells for her successful recovery. The Clantons then arrive, toss Virgil&#x27;s body on the street and announce they will be waiting for the rest of the Earps at the O.K. Corral.

Chihuahua dies and Doc decides to join the Earps, walking alongside Wyatt and Morgan to the corral at sunup. A gunfight ensues in which all of the Clantons are killed, as is Doc.

Wyatt and Morgan resign as law enforcers. Morgan heads West in a horse and buggy. Wyatt bids Clementine farewell at the school house, wistfully promising that if he ever returns he will look her up. Mounting his horse, he muses aloud, &quot;Ma&#x27;am, I sure like that name...Clementine,&quot; and rides off to join his brother.

==Production==
===Development===
In 1931, Stuart Lake published the first biography two years after Earp&#x27;s death. Lake retold the story in the 1946 book &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot;, for which Ford acquired the film rights. The two books have been determined to be largely fictionalized stories about the Earp brothers and the gunfight at the O.K. Corral and their conflict with the outlaw Cowboys: Billy Clanton, Tom McLaury and his brother Frank McLaury. The gunfight was relatively unknown to the American public until Lake published the two books and after the movie was made.

Director John Ford said that when he was a prop boy in the early days of silent pictures, Earp would visit pals he knew from his Tombstone days on the sets. &quot;I used to give him a chair and a cup of coffee, and he told me about the fight at the O.K. Corral. So in &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot;, we did it exactly the way it had been.&quot; Ford did not want to make the movie, but his contract required him to make one more movie for 20th Century Fox.

In their later years, Wyatt and Josephine Earp worked hard to eliminate any mention of Josephine&#x27;s previous relationship with Johnny Behan or Wyatt&#x27;s previous common law marriage to Matty Blaylock. They successfully kept Josephine&#x27;s name out of Lake&#x27;s biography of Wyatt and after he died, Josephine threatened to sue the movie producers to keep it that way. Lake corresponded with Josephine, and he claimed she attempted to influence what he wrote and hamper him in every way possible, including consulting lawyers. Josephine insisted she was striving to protect Wyatt Earp&#x27;s legacy.

After the movie &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot; (in which John Ireland portrayed another real-life figure Johnny Ringo) was released in 1957, the shootout came to be known by that name.

===Writing===
The final script of the movie varies considerably from historical fact to create additional dramatic conflict and character. Clementine Carter is not a historical person, and in this script, she appears to be an amalgam of Big Nose Kate and Josephine Earp. The Earps were also never cowboys, drovers, or cattle owners. Important plot devices in the film and personal details about the main characters were all liberally adapted for the movie.

Old Man Clanton actually died before the gunfight and probably never met any of the Earps. Doc was a dentist, not a surgeon, and survived the shootout. James Earp, who was portrayed as the youngest brother and the first to die in the story, actually was the eldest brother and lived until 1926. The key women in Wyatt&#x27;s and Doc&#x27;s lives—Wyatt&#x27;s common law wife Josephine and Doc&#x27;s common-law wife Big Nose Kate—were not present in Lake&#x27;s original story and were kept out of the movie as well. The film gives the date of the gunfight as 1882 although it actually occurred in 1881.

Upon leaving Tombstone, the itinerant actor, Granville Thorndyke (Alan Mowbray), bids farewell to the old soldier, &quot;Dad&quot; (Francis Ford, John Ford&#x27;s elder brother), with lines from Joseph Addison&#x27;s poem &quot;The Campaign&quot;:

===Filming===
Much of the film was shot in Monument Valley, a scenic desert region straddling the Arizona-Utah border used in other John Ford movies. It is 500 miles (800 km) away from the town of Tombstone in southern Arizona. After seeing a preview screening of the film, 20th Century Fox studio boss Darryl F. Zanuck thought Ford&#x27;s original cut was too long and had some weak spots, so he had Lloyd Bacon shoot new footage and heavily edit the film. Zanuck had Bacon cut 30 minutes from the film.

While Ford&#x27;s original cut of the film has not survived, a &quot;pre-release&quot; cut dating from a few months after the preview screening was discovered in the UCLA film archives; this version preserves some additional footage as well as alternative scoring and editing. UCLA film preservationist Robert Gitt edited a version of the film that incorporates some of the earlier version. A significant change is the film&#x27;s final scene: in the 1946 release, Earp kisses Clementine goodbye; in Ford&#x27;s original, he shakes her hand.

== Critical reception ==
The film is generally regarded as one of the best Westerns made by John Ford and one of his best films overall. Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating with an average score of 8.80/10, based on 32 reviews. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads &quot;Canny and coolly confident, &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; is a definitive dramatization of the Wyatt Earp legend that shoots from the hip and hits its target in breezy style.&quot;

At the time of its release, Bosley Crowther lauded the film and wrote &quot;The eminent director, John Ford, is a man who has a way with a Western like nobody in the picture trade. Seven years ago his classic &quot;Stagecoach&quot; snuggled very close to fine art in this genre. And now, by George, he&#x27;s almost matched it with &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; ... But even with standard Western fiction—and that&#x27;s what the script has enjoined—Mr. Ford can evoke fine sensations and curiously-captivating moods. From the moment that Wyatt and his brothers are discovered on the wide and dusty range, trailing a herd of cattle to a far-off promised land, a tone of pictorial authority is struck—and it is held. Every scene, every shot is the product of a keen and sensitive eye—an eye which has deep comprehension of the beauty of rugged people and a rugged world.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;John Ford&#x27;s direction is clearly stamped on the film with its shadowy lights, softly contrasted moods and measured pace, but a tendency is discernible towards stylization for the sake of stylization. At several points, the pic comes to a dead stop to let Ford go gunning for some arty effect.&quot;

Director Sam Peckinpah considered &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; his favorite Western, and paid homage to it in several of his Westerns, including &quot;Major Dundee&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (1969). Similarly, director Hayao Miyazaki called it one of his 10 favorite movies.

Fifty years after its release, Roger Ebert reviewed the film and included it in his list of The Great Movies. He wrote it was &quot;one of the sweetest and most good-hearted of all Westerns&quot;, unusual in making the romance between Earp and Clementine the heart of the film rather than the gunfight.

In 2004, Matt Bailey summarized its significance: &quot;If there is one film that deserves every word of praise ever uttered or written about it, it is John Ford&#x27;s &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot;. Perhaps the greatest film in a career full of great films, arguably the finest achievement in a rich and magnificent genre, and undoubtedly the best version of one of America&#x27;s most enduring myths, the film is an undeniable and genuine classic.&quot; In the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls, seven critics and five directors named it one of their 10 favorite films.

In 2012, director Michael Mann named &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; one of his 10 favorite films, stating it was &quot;possibly the finest drama in the western genre&quot; and &quot;achieves near-perfection&quot; in its cinematography and editing. It was also President Harry Truman&#x27;s favorite film.

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; as one of his 100 favorite films.

<text>My Man Godfrey is a 1936 American screwball comedy film directed by Gregory La Cava and starring William Powell and Carole Lombard, who had been briefly married years before appearing together in the film. The screenplay for &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; was written by Morrie Ryskind and Eric S. Hatch, with uncredited contributions by La Cava, based on Hatch&#x27;s 1935 novel, &quot;1101 Park Avenue&quot;. The story concerns a socialite who hires a derelict to be her family&#x27;s butler, and then falls in love with him.

The film was critically acclaimed, and was nominated for six Oscars in the 9th Academy Awards including best actor for leads Powell and Lombard, supporting actors Auer and Brady, director and screenplay. It has a 97% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

In 1999, the original version of &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. The film was remade in 1957 with June Allyson and David Niven in the starring roles.

==Plot==
During the Great Depression, Godfrey Smith lives with other homeless men at a New York City dump in a Hooverville by the East River. One night, spoiled socialite Cornelia Bullock offers him $5 to be her &quot;forgotten man&quot; for a scavenger hunt. Godfrey refuses and makes her retreat and fall on a pile of ashes, much to the glee of her younger sister Irene. Godfrey finds Irene to be kind and offers to go with her to help her beat Cornelia and satisfy his curiosity regarding their scavenger hunt.

In the ballroom of the Waldorf-Ritz Hotel, Irene&#x27;s businessman father Alexander Bullock waits resignedly, as his ditsy wife Angelica and her mooching protégé Carlo play the game. Godfrey is authenticated as a &quot;forgotten man&quot;, allowing Irene to win that part of the hunt. He takes the opportunity to publicly express his contempt for the players&#x27; antics before leaving in a huff. An apologetic Irene decides to make Godfrey her protégé and hires him as the new family butler.

On his first day as butler, Godfrey is warned by the Bullocks&#x27; longtime maid Molly that he is merely the latest in a long line of butlers who did not last long due to the female Bullocks&#x27; antics. Despite this, he proves to be up to the challenge, though Cornelia holds a grudge against him. Irene becomes infatuated with Godfrey, and he tries unsuccessfully to discourage her. She kisses him, causing him to politely but firmly outline the boundaries of their employee-employer relationship.

Eventually, Godfrey is recognized by his longtime friend Tommy Gray at a tea party thrown by Irene. Godfrey makes up a story that he was Tommy&#x27;s valet at Harvard; Tommy plays along by embellishing Godfrey&#x27;s story with a nonexistent wife and five children. Upon hearing this, Irene impulsively announces her engagement to a surprised Charlie Van Rumple, but breaks down in tears and flees after being congratulated by Godfrey.

Over lunch the next day, Tommy wonders what one of the elite &quot;Parkes of Boston&quot; is doing as a servant. Godfrey explains that when he lost the woman he loved, he considered suicide, but the undaunted attitude of the homeless men living at the dump rekindled his spirits.

Eventually, Irene breaks her engagement with Charlie. Cornelia attempts to seduce Godfrey on his day off, but when he rebuffs her, she plants her pearl necklace under Godfrey&#x27;s mattress and calls the police to report it missing. However, the police do not find it. Mr. Bullock realizes his daughter has orchestrated the whole thing and informs her that the pearls are not insured.

The Bullocks send their daughters to Europe to help Irene get over her broken engagement to Charlie, but when they return, her feelings for Godfrey have not changed. She stages a fainting spell and swoons into Godfrey&#x27;s arms, who soon realises she is faking it. Godfrey puts her in the shower and turns on the cold water. This, however, has an unexpected result. Irene says, &quot;Oh Godfrey, now I know you love me...You do or you wouldn&#x27;t have lost your temper.&quot;

Godfrey quits. Before he leaves, Mr. Bullock throws Carlo out (literally) and tells his family that his business is in dire straits and he will likely go to jail. However, Godfrey provides good news: when he had realized Mr. Bullock&#x27;s situation, sold short, using some of the money raised by pawning Cornelia&#x27;s pearl necklace to buy up the stock that Bullock had sold. He gives the stock back to Mr. Bullock, saving the family from financial ruin. Godfrey also returns the necklace to Cornelia, who humbly expresses her gratitude and remorse for her behavior.

With the rest of the money Godfrey got for Cornelia&#x27;s necklace, he and Tommy become business partners and convert the now-filled-in dump into a fashionable nightclub called &quot;The Dump&quot;, which creates jobs for the homeless men with a plan to build housing for 50 of them. A determined Irene tracks Godfrey to his office and apartment at The Dump, makes it clear that she is moving in, and, when Tommy sends in New York&#x27;s mayor to marry them, Irene leads a startled Godrey up by the hand and says &quot;Stand still Godfrey, it&#x27;ll all be over in a minute&quot;.

==Production==
The film is based on the 1935 Eric S. Hatch novel, &quot;1101 Park Avenue&quot;. Charles Rogers, head of Universal, called it &quot;a sure-fire laugh-getting novel&quot;. That studio purchased the film rights and assigned Hatch to write the script with Morrie Ryskind, who received top billing for the screenplay. Rogers hired Gregory La Cava to direct, &quot;the best comedy director in Hollywood.&quot;

===Casting===
It was the first major film from Universal after that studio had been taken over by new management, including head of production Charles Rogers. However the studio did not have any major stars under contract apart from Buck Jones, Boris Karloff and Edward Everett Horton, and needed to borrow some from other studios.

The studio&#x27;s original choice to play Irene, the part eventually played by Carole Lombard, was Constance Bennett, and Miriam Hopkins also was considered, but the director Gregory La Cava would only agree to Bennett if Universal borrowed William Powell from MGM. Powell, for his part, only would take the role if Carole Lombard played Irene. Powell and Lombard had divorced three years earlier, but remained good friends.

Powell&#x27;s casting was announced in January 1936. Universal borrowed Lombard from Paramount. As part of the deal, Universal loaned Paramount&#x27;s Margaret Sullavan for the film &quot;I Love a Soldier,&quot; and Lombard&#x27;s clothes designer, Travis Banton, accompanied her. Alice Brady joined the cast in March.

===Shooting===
&quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; was in production from April 15 to May 27, 1936, and then had retakes in early June of the year. Its budget was $575,375; Powell was paid $87,500 and Lombard $45,645. The film was one of the first under the new regime of Charles Rogers at Universal, although it had been developed under his predecessor Carl Laemmle Jr.

La Cava, a former animator and freelancer for most of his film career, held studio executives in contempt and was known to be a bit eccentric. When he and Powell hit a snag over a disagreement about how Godfrey should be portrayed, they settled things over a bottle of Scotch. The next morning, La Cava showed up for shooting with a headache, but Powell didn&#x27;t appear. Instead, the actor sent a telegram stating: &quot;WE MAY HAVE FOUND GODFREY LAST NIGHT BUT WE LOST POWELL. SEE YOU TOMORROW.&quot;

Due to insurance considerations a stand-in stuntman (Chick Collins) was used when Godfrey carried Irene over his shoulder up the stairs to her bedroom.

In a premiere special in the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; Universal producer Rogers said it was key to the film&#x27;s production to make &quot;everyone connected with the picture&quot; feel &quot;a happy-go-lucky mood,&quot; and &quot;keep them laughing... madder and merrier the better,&quot; &quot;while you&#x27;re shooting the picture.&quot; Film crew described star Lombard as &quot;a good egg&quot; who &quot;never stands on ceremony... impulsive... outspoken... extremely frank,&quot; always &quot;gay,&quot; and particularly &quot;a friend to everyone&quot; who worked with her. They also called Powell as &quot;a good egg,&quot; and humble, who asked for no special considerations, and praised others&#x27; work.

When tensions hit a high point on the set, Lombard had a habit of inserting four-letter words into her dialogue, often to the great amusement of the cast. This made shooting somewhat difficult, but clips of her cursing in her dialogue and messing up her lines can still be seen in blooper reels, along with four-letter words from Powell.

==Release and reception==
===Original===
It was the first film released under the aegis of Charles Rogers and was given a big premiere at The Pantages Theatre in Hollywood, with comedian George Jessel as master of ceremonies. &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; premiered on September 6, 1936, and was released in the United States on September 17. It was a runaway hit and earned huge profits for the studio.

The movie was one of the most acclaimed comedies of 1936. &quot;Variety&quot; called it a &quot;splendidly produced comedy,&quot; with Powell and Lombard &quot;pleasantly teamed&quot; as Lombard plays the most &quot;screwy&quot; of the various &quot;screwball dames&quot; she has ever played.

Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a moderately positive review, characterizing it as &quot;acutely funny [for three-quarters of its way]&quot;. Particularly praising the scene of the scavenging party, Greene finds it to be &quot;perhaps the wittiest, as well as noisiest, sequence of the year&quot;. Considering the end of the film, however, he notes that &quot;the social conscience is a little confused&quot; and he wishes for a more &quot;dignified exit&quot;.

===Modern===
Modern critics have praised it as enduring amusement, and truth, and as a &quot;landmark&quot; icon of the 1930s screwball comedy film concept, and the overall craft of filmmaking.

In 1999, the film was selected for the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Film Registry (NFR) of motion pictures &quot;selected for... historical, cultural and aesthetic contributions,&quot; saying that &quot;Carole Lombard sparkles [at] one of her greatest roles,&quot; in this &quot;comedic take and sometimes caustic commentary on the Great Depression,&quot; adding &quot;William Powell portrays Godfrey with knife-edged delivery,&quot; in &quot;one of the most exemplary screwball comedies of the 1930s.&quot; The NFR also praises Ted Tetzlaff&#x27;s black-and-white cinematography.

In 2023, &quot;Time&quot; magazine selected it as one of the &quot;100 Best Movies of the Last 10 Decades,&quot; placing it among &quot;the greatest romantic comedies&quot; to come out of that &quot;decade full of terrific ones.&quot;

&quot;God... this film is beautiful,&quot; declared critic Roger Ebert, who praised the cinematography as &quot;a shimmering argument&quot; for the virtues of films produced in black-and-white, rather than color. He praised the film, and &quot;the actors in it... its style of production,&quot; even... &quot;the system that produced it,&quot; as an escape from today&#x27;s &quot;pop culture of brainless vulgarity.&quot;

Critics have also praised the elegant set design and costumes, particularly Travis Banton&#x27;s costume designs.

== Awards and honors ==
&quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; was the first movie to be nominated in all four acting categories, in the first year that supporting categories were introduced. It is also the only film in Oscar history to receive a nomination in all four acting categories and not be nominated for Best Picture. It was the only film to be nominated in these six categories and not receive any award until 2013&#x27;s &quot;American Hustle&quot;.

In 1999, the film was deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 2000, the film was ranked #44 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the 100 funniest comedies, and &quot;Premiere&quot; voted it one of &quot;The 50 Greatest Comedies Of All Time&quot; in 2006. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval score of 97% based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A class satire in a class of its own, &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; screwball comedy is as sharp as the social commentary is biting.&quot;

==Public domain status==
The original film is generally thought to have entered into the public domain in 1965 when the film&#x27;s copyright was not renewed after 28 years. However the underlying work, the 1935 book &quot;1101 Park Avenue&quot; – re-titled &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; with the film&#x27;s release – had its copyright renewed in 1963 and is thus still in copyright. According to Stanford University Library, and under rulings of the 1990 case &quot;Stewart v. Abend&quot;, in so-called multilayered works, the rights holder of the original work can claim ownership of the film script, though not the pictures, if the original book is still in copyright. &quot;Films are often based on books ... that may maintain copyright. If the pre-existing work is protected, then rightly or wrongly, it has generally been determined that the derived film is also protected.&quot;

== Home media ==
In 2002, a restored print was made available on DVD by The Criterion Collection, which featured a new cover illustrated by Michael Koelsch. In 2005, 20th Century Fox Home Video released a colorized version. In September 2018, Criterion released the film on Blu-ray with new supplements.

==Remakes and adaptations==
&quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; was twice adapted as a one-hour radio broadcast on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;: on May 9, 1938, with David Niven playing the part of Tommy Gray; and on November 9, 1954, with Jeff Chandler and Julie Adams. It was also adapted to radio in a half-hour version on the October 2, 1946, episode of &quot;Academy Award Theater&quot;, again starring William Powell. When the film was remade in 1957, David Niven played Godfrey opposite June Allyson, directed by Henry Koster. A stage musical version of &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;, produced by Allan Carr and written by librettists Alan Jay Lerner and Kristi Kane and composer Gerard Kenny, was intended for Broadway in 1985, but remained uncompleted at the time of Alan Jay Lerner&#x27;s death in 1986.

<text>Harold Frederick Shipman (14 January 1946 – 13 January 2004), known to acquaintances as Fred Shipman, was an English doctor in general practice and serial killer. He is considered to be one of the most prolific serial killers in modern history, with an estimated 284 victims over roughly 30 years. On 31 January 2000, Shipman was convicted of murdering 15 patients under his care. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a whole life order. On 13 January 2004, one day before his 58th birthday, Shipman hanged himself in his cell at HM Prison Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

&quot;The Shipman Inquiry&quot;, a two-year-long investigation of all deaths certified by Shipman, chaired by Dame Janet Smith, examined Shipman&#x27;s crimes. It revealed Shipman targeted vulnerable elderly people who trusted him as their doctor, killing them with either a fatal dose of drugs or prescribing an abnormal amount. To date, Shipman, who has been nicknamed &quot;Dr. Death&quot; and the &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, is the only British doctor to have been convicted of murdering patients, although other doctors have been acquitted of similar crimes or convicted of lesser charges. Shipman&#x27;s case has often been compared to that of doctor John Bodkin Adams; some nurses, such as Beverley Allitt and Lucy Letby, have also been convicted of murdering patients in their care.

==Early life and education==
Harold Frederick Shipman was born on 14 January 1946 on the Bestwood Estate, a council estate in Nottingham, the second of three children. His father, also Harold Frederick Shipman (1914–1985), was a lorry driver; his mother was Vera (; 1919–1963). His working-class parents were devout Methodists.

Shipman was particularly close to his mother, who died of lung cancer when he was aged 17. Her death came in a manner similar to what later became Shipman&#x27;s own &quot;modus operandi&quot;: in the later stages of her disease, she had morphine administered at home by a doctor. Shipman witnessed his mother&#x27;s pain subside, despite her terminal condition, until her death on 21 June 1963.

On 5 November 1966, he married Primrose May Oxtoby; the couple had four children. Shipman studied medicine at Leeds School of Medicine, University of Leeds, graduating in 1970.

==Career==
Shipman began working at Pontefract General Infirmary in Pontefract, West Riding of Yorkshire, and in 1974 took his first position as a general practitioner (GP) at the Abraham Ormerod Medical Centre in Todmorden. The following year, Shipman was caught forging prescriptions of pethidine for his own use. He was fined £600 and briefly attended a drug rehabilitation clinic in York. He worked as a GP at Donneybrook Medical Centre in Hyde, Greater Manchester, in 1977.

Shipman continued working as a GP in Hyde throughout the 1980s and established his own surgery at 21 Market Street in 1993, becoming a respected member of the community. In 1983, he was interviewed in an edition of the Granada Television current affairs documentary &quot;World in Action&quot; on how the mentally ill should be treated in the community. A year after his conviction on charges of murder, the interview was re-broadcast on &quot;Tonight with Trevor McDonald&quot;.

==Detection==
In March 1998, Linda Reynolds, a general practitioner at the Brooke Surgery in Hyde, expressed concerns to John Pollard, the coroner for the South Manchester District, about the high death rate among Shipman&#x27;s patients. In particular, she was concerned about the large number of cremation forms for elderly women that he had asked to have countersigned. Police were unable to find sufficient evidence to bring charges and closed the investigation on 17 April. &quot;The Shipman Inquiry&quot; later blamed Greater Manchester Police for assigning inexperienced officers to the case. After the investigation was closed, Shipman killed three more people. A few months later, in August, taxi driver John Shaw told the police that he suspected Shipman of murdering 21 patients. Shaw became suspicious as many of the elderly customers he took to the hospital, while seemingly in good health, died in Shipman&#x27;s care.

Shipman&#x27;s last victim was Kathleen Grundy, a former mayor of Hyde who was found dead at her home on 24 June 1998. He was the last person to see her alive; he later signed her death certificate, recording the cause of death as old age. Grundy&#x27;s daughter, solicitor Angela Woodruff, became concerned when fellow solicitor Brian Burgess informed her that a will had been made, apparently by her mother, with doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded Woodruff and her children, but left £386,000 to Shipman. At Burgess&#x27; urging, Woodruff went to the police, who began an investigation. Grundy&#x27;s body was exhumed and found to contain traces of diamorphine (heroin), often used for pain control in terminal cancer patients. Shipman claimed that Grundy had been an addict and showed them comments he had written to that effect in his computerised medical journal; however, police examination of his computer showed that the entries were written after her death.

Shipman was arrested on 7 September 1998, and was found to own a Brother typewriter of the type used to make the forged will. &quot;Prescription for Murder&quot;, a 2000 book by journalists Brian Whittle and Jean Ritchie, suggested that Shipman forged the will either because he felt his life was out of control and wanted to be caught, or because he planned to retire at 55 and leave the UK. The police investigated other deaths that Shipman had certified and investigated 15 specimen cases. They discovered a pattern of his administering lethal doses of diamorphine, signing patients&#x27; death certificates, and then falsifying medical records to indicate that they had been in poor health. In 2003, David Spiegelhalter &quot;et al.&quot; suggested that &quot;statistical monitoring could have led to an alarm being raised at the end of 1996, when there were 67 excess deaths in females aged over 65 years, compared with 119 by 1998.&quot; In addition, an abnormally large number of the deaths occurred around the same time of day (when Shipman was on his afternoon visits) and in the doctor&#x27;s presence.

==Trial and imprisonment==
Shipman&#x27;s trial began at Preston Crown Court on 5 October 1999. He was charged with the murders of 15 women by lethal injections of diamorphine, all between 1995 and 1998:

Shipman&#x27;s legal representatives tried unsuccessfully to have the Grundy case tried separately from the others, as a motive was shown by the alleged forgery of Grundy&#x27;s will.
On 31 January 2000, after six days of deliberation, the jury found Shipman guilty of 15 counts of murder and one count of forgery. Mr Justice Forbes subsequently sentenced Shipman to life imprisonment on all 15 counts of murder, with a recommendation that he be subject to a whole life tariff, to be served concurrently with a sentence of four years for forging Grundy&#x27;s will. On 11 February, 11 days after his conviction, Shipman was struck off the medical register by the General Medical Council (GMC). Two years later, Home Secretary David Blunkett confirmed the judge&#x27;s whole life tariff, just months before British government ministers lost their power to set minimum terms for prisoners. While authorities could have brought many additional charges, they concluded that a fair hearing would be impossible given the enormous publicity surrounding the original trial. Furthermore, the 15 life sentences already imposed rendered further litigation unnecessary. Shipman became friends with fellow serial killer Peter Moore while in prison.

Shipman denied his guilt, disputing the scientific evidence against him. He never made any public statements about his actions. Shipman&#x27;s wife, Primrose, maintained that he was not guilty, even after his conviction.

Shipman is the only doctor in the history of British medicine found guilty of murdering his patients. John Bodkin Adams was charged in 1957 with murdering a patient, amid rumours he had killed dozens more over a 10-year period and &quot;possibly provided the role model for Shipman&quot;; he was acquitted and no further charges were pursued. A historian, Pamela Cullen, has argued that because of Adams&#x27; acquittal, there was no impetus to examine potential flaws in the British legal system until the Shipman case.

==Death==

Shipman hanged himself in his cell at HM Prison Wakefield on 13 January 2004, the day before his 58th birthday. The Medico Legal Centre in Sheffield performed a post-mortem examination, and an inquest was opened.

Some of the victims&#x27; families said they felt &quot;cheated&quot;, as Shipman&#x27;s suicide meant they would never have the satisfaction of a confession, nor answers as to why he committed his crimes. Home Secretary David Blunkett admitted that celebration was tempting: &quot;You wake up and you receive a call telling you Shipman has topped himself and you think, is it too early to open a bottle? And then you discover that everybody&#x27;s very upset that he&#x27;s done it.&quot;

Shipman&#x27;s death divided national newspapers, with the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; branding him a &quot;cold coward&quot; and condemning the Prison Service for allowing his suicide to occur. However, &quot;The Sun&quot; ran a celebratory front-page headline; &quot;Ship Ship hooray!&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot; called for the inquiry into Shipman&#x27;s suicide to look more widely at the state of UK prisons as well as the welfare of inmates. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, an article by General Sir David Ramsbotham, who had formerly served as Her Majesty&#x27;s Chief Inspector of Prisons, suggested that whole life sentencing be replaced by indefinite sentencing, for this would at least give prisoners the hope of eventual release and reduce the risk of their ending their own lives by suicide, as well as making their management easier for prison officials.

Shipman&#x27;s motive for suicide was never established, though he reportedly told his probation officer that he was considering suicide to assure his wife&#x27;s financial security after he was stripped of his National Health Service pension. Primrose Shipman received a full NHS pension; she would not have been entitled to it if Shipman had lived past the age of 60. Additionally, there was evidence that Primrose, who had consistently protested Shipman&#x27;s innocence despite the overwhelming evidence, had begun to suspect his guilt. Shipman refused to take part in courses which would have encouraged acknowledgement of his crimes, leading to a temporary removal of privileges, including the opportunity to telephone his wife. During this period, according to Shipman&#x27;s cellmate, he received a letter from Primrose exhorting him to &quot;Tell me everything, no matter what.&quot; A 2005 inquiry found that Shipman&#x27;s suicide &quot;could not have been predicted or prevented&quot;, but that procedures should nonetheless be re-examined.

After Shipman&#x27;s body was released to his family, it remained in Sheffield for more than a year. His widow was advised by police against burying her husband in case the grave was attacked. Shipman&#x27;s body was eventually cremated. The cremation was attended only by Primrose and the couple&#x27;s four children.

==Aftermath==
In January 2001, Chris Gregg, a senior West Yorkshire Police detective, was selected to lead an investigation into 22 of the West Yorkshire deaths. Following this, &quot;The Shipman Inquiry&quot;, submitted in July 2002, concluded that he had killed at least 218 of his patients between 1975 and 1998, during which time he practised in Todmorden (1974–1975) and Hyde (1977–1998). Janet Smith, the judge who submitted the report, admitted that many more deaths of a suspicious nature could not be definitively ascribed to Shipman. Most of his victims were elderly women in good health.

In her sixth and final report, issued on 24 January 2005, Smith reported that she believed that Shipman had killed three patients, and she had serious suspicions about four further deaths, including that of a four-year-old girl, during the early stage of his medical career at Pontefract General Infirmary. In total, 459 people died while under his care between 1971 and 1998, but it is uncertain how many of those were murder victims, as he was often the only doctor to certify a death. Smith&#x27;s estimate of Shipman&#x27;s total victim count over that 27-year period was 250.

The GMC charged six doctors who signed cremation forms for Shipman&#x27;s victims with misconduct, claiming they should have noticed the pattern between Shipman&#x27;s home visits and his patients&#x27; deaths. All these doctors were found not guilty. In October 2005, a similar hearing was held against two doctors who worked at Tameside General Hospital in 1994, who failed to detect that Shipman had deliberately administered a &quot;grossly excessive&quot; dose of morphine. &quot;The Shipman Inquiry&quot; recommended changes to the structure of the GMC.

In 2005, it came to light that Shipman may have stolen jewellery from his victims. In 1998, police had seized over £10,000 worth of jewellery they found in his garage. In March 2005, when Primrose asked for its return, police wrote to the families of Shipman&#x27;s victims asking them to identify the jewellery. Unidentified items were handed to the Assets Recovery Agency in May. The investigation ended in August. Authorities returned 66 pieces to Primrose and auctioned 33 pieces that she confirmed were not hers. Proceeds of the auction went to Tameside Victim Support. The only piece returned to a murdered patient&#x27;s family was a platinum diamond ring, for which the family provided a photograph as proof of ownership.

A memorial garden to Shipman&#x27;s victims, called the Garden of Tranquillity, opened in Hyde Park, Hyde, on 30 July 2005. As of early 2009, families of over 200 of the victims of Shipman were still seeking compensation for the loss of their relatives. In September 2009, letters Shipman wrote in prison to friends were to be sold at auction, but following complaints from victims&#x27; relatives and the media, the sale was withdrawn.

===Shipman effect===
The Shipman case, and a series of recommendations in the &quot;Shipman Inquiry&quot; report, led to changes to standard medical procedures in the UK (now referred to as the &quot;Shipman effect&quot;). Many doctors reported changes in their dispensing practices, and a reluctance to risk overprescribing pain medication may have led to under-prescribing. Death certification practices were altered as well. Perhaps the largest change was the movement from single-doctor general practices to multiple-doctor general practices. This was not a direct recommendation, but rather because the report stated that there was not enough safeguarding and monitoring of doctors&#x27; decisions.

The forms needed for a cremation in England and Wales have had their questions altered as a direct result of the Shipman case. For example, the person(s) organising the funeral must answer, &quot;Do you know or suspect that the death of the person who has died was violent or unnatural? Do you consider that there should be any further examination of the remains of the person who has died?&quot;

As of 1 December 2023, Shipman, also nicknamed &quot;Dr. Death&quot; and &quot;The Angel of Death&quot;, is the only British doctor to have been convicted of murdering patients, although other doctors, such as Isyaka Mamman, have been acquitted of similar crimes or convicted of lesser charges and nurses such as Lucy Letby, Beverley Allitt, Colin Norris, Benjamin Geen and Victorino Chua have also been convicted of murdering patients in their care.

==In media==
&quot;Harold and Fred (They Make Ladies Dead)&quot; was a cartoon strip in a 2001 issue of &quot;Viz&quot; comic, also featuring serial killer Fred West. Some relatives of Shipman&#x27;s victims voiced anger at the cartoon.

&quot;Harold Shipman: Doctor Death&quot;, an ITV television dramatisation of the case, was broadcast in 2002; it starred James Bolam in the title role.

A documentary also titled &quot;Harold Shipman: Doctor Death&quot;, with new witness testimony about the serial killer, was shown by ITV as part of its &quot;Crime &amp; Punishment&quot; strand on 26 April 2018. The programme was criticised as offering &quot;little new insight&quot;.

A play titled &quot;Beyond Belief – Scenes from the Shipman Inquiry&quot;, written by Dennis Woolf and directed by Chris Honer, was performed at the Library Theatre, Manchester, from 20 October to 22 November 2004. The script of the play comprised edited verbatim extracts from the Shipman Inquiry, spoken by actors playing the witnesses and lawyers at the inquiry. This provided a &quot;stark narrative&quot; that focused on personal tragedies.

A BBC drama-documentary, entitled &quot;Harold Shipman&quot; and starring Ian Brooker in the title role, was broadcast in April 2014.

The satirical artist Cold War Steve regularly features Shipman in his work.

&quot;The Shipman Files: A Very British Crime Story&quot;, a three-part documentary by Chris Wilson, was broadcast on BBC Two on three consecutive nights between 28 and 30 September 2020, and focussed on Shipman&#x27;s victims and how he went undetected for so long.

Podcast episode &quot;Catching a Killer Doctor&quot; from the &quot;Cautionary Tales with Tim Harford&quot; podcast series features the story of Harold Shipman and how detection could have been made much earlier with good statistical models.

The 2005 song &quot;What About Us?&quot; by British band the Fall makes explicit reference to the Shipman killings (&quot;There was a man going round all the time/He was dishing out drugs/He was a doctor/Dishing out morphine to old ladies&quot;), and the name Shipman is sung as backing vocals during the choruses.

Shipman was a member of the Conservative Party. He was mentioned in the 2022 Wakefield by-election when Conservative candidate Nadeem Ahmed highlighted his local connections, following Shipman&#x27;s suicide in Wakefield prison, claiming that voters should &quot;trust Tories like they do GPs after Harold Shipman&quot;.

In 2023, DeadHappy, a Leicester-based life insurance firm, was criticised for using an image of Shipman in one of its advertisements. The Advertising Standards Authority received more than 70 complaints about the advert.

In 2025, Shipman was referenced in the third episode of series 3 of The Traitors, a reality television game show where &quot;Faithful&quot; contestants are tasked with finding and banishing the titular &quot;Traitors&quot;. During the roundtable discussion, medical doctor Kasim Ahmed was accused of being a Traitor by fellow contestant Jake Brown, who claimed that it would &quot;make sense&quot; for Ahmed to &quot;save lives during the day&quot; while &quot;murdering by night&quot; within the narrative of the show. Ahmed then stated that he believed Brown was &quot;basically calling [him] Harold Shipman&quot;. This moment caused Shipman to trend on social media.

<doc id="74983" wikidata="Q185121" url="?curid=74983" title="Revolver (Beatles album)">
<text>Revolver is the seventh studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 5 August 1966, accompanied by the double A-side single &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; / &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. The album was the Beatles&#x27; final recording project before their retirement as live performers and marked the group&#x27;s most overt use of studio technology to date, building on the advances of their late 1965 release &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. It has since become regarded as one of the greatest and most innovative albums in the history of popular music, with recognition centred on its range of musical styles, diverse sounds and lyrical content.

The Beatles recorded &quot;Revolver&quot; after taking a three-month break at the start of 1966, and during a period when London was feted as the era&#x27;s cultural capital. Regarded by some commentators as the start of the group&#x27;s psychedelic period, the songs reflect their interest in the drug LSD, Eastern philosophy and the avant-garde while addressing themes such as death and transcendence of material concerns. With no plans to reproduce their new material in concert, the band made liberal use of automatic double tracking, varispeed, reversed tapes, close audio miking, and instruments outside of their standard live set-up. Among its tracks are &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, incorporating heavy Indian drone and a collage of tape loops; &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, a song about loneliness featuring a string octet as its only musical backing; and &quot;Love You To&quot;, a foray into Hindustani classical music. The sessions also produced a non-album single, &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;, backed with &quot;Rain&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, the album&#x27;s 14 tracks were gradually distributed to radio stations in the weeks before its release. In North America, &quot;Revolver&quot; was reduced to 11 songs by Capitol Records, with the omitted three appearing on the June 1966 LP &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;. The release there coincided with the Beatles&#x27; final concert tour and the controversy surrounding John Lennon&#x27;s remark that the band had become &quot;more popular than Jesus&quot;. The album topped the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart in the UK for seven weeks and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs list for six weeks. Critical reaction was highly favourable in the UK but less so in the US amid the press&#x27;s unease at the band&#x27;s outspokenness on contemporary issues.

&quot;Revolver&quot; expanded the boundaries of pop music, revolutionised standard practices in studio recording, advanced principles espoused by the 1960s counterculture, and inspired the development of psychedelic rock, electronica, progressive rock and world music. The album cover, designed by Klaus Voormann, combined Aubrey Beardsley-inspired line drawing with photo collage and won the 1967 Grammy Award for Best Album Cover, Graphic Arts. Aided by the 1987 international CD release, which standardised its content to the original Parlophone version, &quot;Revolver&quot; has surpassed &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967) in many critics&#x27; estimation as the Beatles&#x27; best album. It was ranked first in the 1998 and 2000 editions of Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; and third in the 2003 and 2012 editions of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. It has been certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and 5× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). A of the album was released in 2022.
== Background ==
In December 1965, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; album was released to wide critical acclaim. According to author David Howard, the limits of pop music &quot;had been raised into the stratosphere&quot; by the release, resulting in a shift in focus away from singles to creating albums of consistently high quality. The following January, the Beatles carried out overdubs on live recordings taken from their 1965 US tour, for inclusion in the concert film &quot;The Beatles at Shea Stadium&quot;. The group&#x27;s manager, Brian Epstein, had intended that 1966 would then follow the pattern of the previous two years, in terms of the band making a feature film and an accompanying album, followed by concert tours during the summer months. After the Beatles vetoed the proposed film project, the time allocated for filming became a further three months free of professional engagements. This was the longest period the band members had experienced outside the group collective since 1962, and it defied the convention that pop acts should be working almost continually. The group thereby had an unprecedented amount of time to prepare for a new album.

Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner cites 1966 as the start of the band&#x27;s &quot;psychedelic period&quot;, as do musicologists Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc. Schaffner adds: &quot;That adjective [psychedelic] implies not only the influence of certain mind-altering chemicals, but also the freewheeling spectrum of wide-ranging colors that their new music seemed to evoke.&quot; Music journalist Carol Clerk describes &quot;Revolver&quot; as having been &quot;decisively informed by acid&quot;, following John Lennon and George Harrison&#x27;s continued use of the drug LSD since the spring of 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clerk/Uncut&quot;&gt; Available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; Through these experiences, the two musicians developed a fascination for Eastern philosophical concepts, particularly regarding the illusory nature of human existence. Despite his bandmates&#x27; urging, after Ringo Starr had also partaken of the drug, Paul McCartney refused to try LSD. Intent on self-improvement, McCartney drew inspiration from the intellectual stimulation he experienced among London&#x27;s arts scene, particularly its thriving avant-garde community. With Barry Miles as his guide, he became immersed in the nascent British counterculture movement, which soon emerged as the underground.

While arranging dates for the band&#x27;s world tour, Epstein agreed to a proposal by journalist Maureen Cleave for the Beatles to be interviewed separately for a series of articles that would explore each of the band members&#x27; personality and lifestyle beyond his identity as a Beatle. The articles were published in weekly instalments in London&#x27;s &quot;Evening Standard&quot; newspaper throughout March 1966, and reflected the transformation that was underway during the group&#x27;s months of inactivity. Of the two principal songwriters, Cleave found Lennon to be intuitive, lazy and dissatisfied with fame and his surroundings in the Surrey countryside, while McCartney conveyed confidence and a hunger for knowledge and new creative possibilities. In his book &quot;Revolver: How the Beatles Reimagined Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, Robert Rodriguez writes that, whereas Lennon had been the Beatles&#x27; dominant creative force before &quot;Revolver&quot;, McCartney now attained an approximately equal position with him. In a further development, Harrison&#x27;s interest in the music and culture of India, and his study of the Indian sitar, had inspired him as a composer. According to author Ian Inglis, &quot;Revolver&quot; is widely viewed as &quot;the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter&quot;.

== Recording history ==

The Beatles had hoped to work in a more modern facility than EMI&#x27;s London studios at Abbey Road and were impressed with the sound on records created at Stax Studio in Memphis. In March 1966, Epstein investigated the possibility of their recording the new album at Stax, where, according to a letter written by Harrison two months later, the group intended to work with producer Jim Stewart. The idea was abandoned after locals began descending on the Stax building, as were alternative plans to use either Atlantic Studios in New York or Motown&#x27;s Hitsville USA facility in Detroit.

Recording for the album instead began at EMI Studio 3 in London on 6 April, with George Martin again serving as producer. The first track attempted was Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, the arrangement for which changed considerably between the initial take that day and the subsequent remake. This first version of &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, along with several other outtakes from the album sessions, was included on the 1996 compilation &quot;Anthology 2&quot;. Also recorded during the &quot;Revolver&quot; sessions were &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot;, which were issued as the A- and B-side of a non-album single in late May.
The band had worked on ten songs, including both sides of the upcoming single, by 1 May, when they interrupted the sessions to perform at the &quot;NME&quot; annual Poll-Winners Concert. At a time when &quot;Time&quot; magazine dubbed London &quot;the Swinging City&quot;, belatedly recognising its ascendance as the era&#x27;s cultural capital, the Beatles drew inspiration from attending concerts by visiting artists, as well as film premieres, plays and other cultural events. From February through June, these musical acts included Stevie Wonder, Roy Orbison, the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, the Mamas &amp; the Papas, Bob Dylan (with whom they socialised extensively), Luciano Berio and Ravi Shankar. During mid-May, Lennon and McCartney attended a private listening party for the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album, and McCartney met Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni, who filmed &quot;Blowup&quot; in London, inspired by the contemporary fashion scene.

On 16 May, Epstein responded to a request from Capitol Records, EMI&#x27;s North American counterpart, to supply three new songs for an upcoming US release, titled &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;. Issued on 20 June, this album combined tracks that Capitol had omitted from the Beatles&#x27; previous US releases with songs that the band had originally issued on non-album singles. From the six completed recordings for &quot;Revolver&quot;, Martin selected three Lennon-written songs, since the sessions had favoured his compositions thus far. Keen to limit the interruption to recording that multiple television appearances would create, the Beatles spent two days making promotional films for the &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; single. The first set of clips was filmed at EMI Studio 1 on 19 May by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, director of the popular TV show &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; The following day, the group shot further clips for the two songs in the grounds of Chiswick House, in west London. In the face of fans&#x27; complaints of an aloofness in their new work, however, the band conceded to making a live appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 16 June.

The camaraderie among the four Beatles was at its highest throughout this period. A disagreement between McCartney and his bandmates nevertheless resulted in McCartney walking out of the studio during the final session, for Lennon&#x27;s &quot;She Said She Said&quot;, on 21 June, two days before the band were due to fly to West Germany for the first leg of their world tour. The Beatles spent over 220 hours recording &quot;Revolver&quot; – a figure that excludes mixing sessions, and compares with less than 80 hours for &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. Final mixing of the album took place on 22 June. The Beatles celebrated the project&#x27;s completion by attending the opening of Sibylla&#x27;s, a nightclub in which Harrison had a financial stake.

== Production techniques ==
=== Studio aesthetic ===

The sessions for &quot;Revolver&quot; furthered the spirit of studio experimentation that was evident on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. With the Beatles increasingly involved in the production of their music, Martin&#x27;s role as producer had changed to one of a facilitator and collaborator, whereby the band now relied on him to make their ideas a reality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheffield/RS 50th&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rodriguez, &quot;Revolver&quot; marked the first time the Beatles integrated studio technology into the &quot;conception of the recordings they made&quot;. He views this approach as reflective of the group&#x27;s waning interest in live performance before crowds of screaming fans, &quot;in favor of creating soundscapes without limitation&quot; in a studio environment. For the first time at EMI Studios, the company&#x27;s four-track tape machines were placed in the studio&#x27;s control room, alongside the producer and balance engineer, rather than in a dedicated machine room. The Beatles&#x27; new recording engineer on the project was nineteen-year-old Geoff Emerick, whom author and critic Ian MacDonald describes as an &quot;English audio experimentalist&quot; in the tradition of Joe Meek. Emerick recalled that no preproduction or rehearsal process took place for &quot;Revolver&quot;; instead, the band used the studio to create each song from what was often just an outline of a composition. Speaking shortly before the start of the sessions, Lennon said that they had considered making the album a continuous flow of tracks, without gaps to differentiate between each song.
The group&#x27;s willingness to experiment was also evident in their dedication to finding or inventing sounds that captured the heightened perception they experienced through hallucinogenic drugs. The album made liberal use of compression and tonal equalisation. Emerick said that the Beatles encouraged the studio staff to break from standard recording practices, adding: &quot;It was implanted when we started &quot;Revolver&quot; that every instrument should sound unlike itself: a piano shouldn&#x27;t sound like a piano, a guitar shouldn&#x27;t sound like a guitar.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvin/Tomorrow&quot;&gt;Irvin, Jim. &quot;Into Tomorrow&quot;. In: .&lt;/ref&gt;

In their search for new sounds, the band incorporated musical instruments such as the Indian tambura and tabla, and clavichord, vibraphone and tack piano into their work for the first time. The guitar sound on the album was more robust than before, through the use of new Fender amplifiers; the choice of guitars, which included Harrison using a Gibson SG as his preferred instrument; and the introduction of Fairchild 660 limiters for recording.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scapelliti/GW&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With no expectations of being able to re-create their new music within the confines of their live shows, the Beatles increasingly used outside contributors while making the album. This included the band&#x27;s first use of a horn section, on &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot;, and the first time they incorporated sound effects extensively, during a party-style overdubbing session for &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;.

=== Innovations ===

Author Mark Brend writes that, with &quot;Revolver&quot;, the Beatles advanced Meek&#x27;s strategy of employing the recording studio as a musical instrument and &quot;formalized this approach into what is now an accepted option for pop music making&quot;. A key production technique they used was automatic double tracking (ADT), which EMI technical engineer Ken Townsend invented on 6 April. This technique employed two linked tape recorders to automatically create a doubled vocal track. The standard method had been to double the vocal by singing the same piece twice onto a multitrack tape, a task Lennon particularly disliked. The Beatles were delighted with the invention, and used it extensively on &quot;Revolver&quot;. ADT soon became a standard pop production technique, and led to related developments such as the artificial chorus effect.

The band&#x27;s most experimental work during the sessions was channelled into the first song they attempted, &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;. Lennon sang his vocal for the song through the twin revolving speakers inside a Leslie cabinet, which was designed for use with a Hammond organ. The effect was employed throughout the initial take of the song but only during the second half of the remake. According to author Andy Babiuk, &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; marked the first time that a vocal was recorded using a microphone wired into the input of a Leslie speaker. Much of the backing track for the song consists of a series of prepared tape loops, an idea that originated with McCartney and was influenced by the work of avant-garde artists such as Karlheinz Stockhausen who regularly experimented with magnetic tape and musique concrète techniques. The Beatles each prepared loops at home, and a selection of these sounds were then added to the musical backing of &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;. The process was carried out live, with multiple tape recorders running simultaneously, and some of the longer loops extending out of the control room and down the corridor.

The inclusion of reversed tape sounds on &quot;Rain&quot; (specifically, a portion of Lennon&#x27;s vocal part) marked the first pop release to use this technique, although the Beatles had first used it in some of the tape loops and the overdubbed guitar solo on &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;. The backwards (or backmasked) guitar solo on &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot; was similarly unprecedented in pop music, in that Harrison deliberately composed and recorded his guitar parts with a view to how the notes would sound when the tape direction was corrected. Experimentation with backwards sounds was a key aspect of the &quot;Revolver&quot; sessions, as was the use of the Leslie speaker effect. The band&#x27;s interest in the tones that resulted from varying tape speed (or varispeeding) extended to recording a basic track at a faster tempo than they intended the song to sound on disc.
During the sessions, Emerick recorded McCartney&#x27;s bass guitar amplifier via a loudspeaker, which Townsend had reconfigured to serve as a microphone, in order to give the bass more prominence than on previous Beatles releases. Although this particular technique was used only on the two songs selected for the May 1966 single, an enhanced bass sound was a feature of much of the album. Emerick also ensured a greater presence for Starr&#x27;s bass drum, by inserting an item of clothing inside the structure, to dampen the sound, and then moving the microphone to just 3 inches from the drumhead and compressing the signal through a Fairchild limiter. MacDonald writes that, despite EMI Studios being technically inferior to many recording facilities in the United States, Starr&#x27;s drumming on the album soon led to studios there &quot;being torn apart and put back together again&quot;, as engineers sought to replicate the innovative sounds achieved by the Beatles. The preference for close-miking instruments extended to the orchestral strings used on &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, to achieve McCartney&#x27;s request for a &quot;really biting&quot; sound, and the horns on &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot;. This was another break from convention, and the cause for alarm among the classically trained string players.

According to authors Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew, ADT, backwards recording and close-miked drums were among the nine techniques that the &quot;Revolver&quot; sessions introduced into the recording world for the first time. Ryan and Kehew quote Emerick as saying: &quot;I know for a fact that, from the day it came out, &quot;Revolver&quot; changed the way that everyone else made records.&quot;

=== Overview ===
Author Steve Turner writes that &quot;Revolver&quot; encapsulates not only &quot;the spirit of the times&quot; but the network of progressive social and cultural thinkers in which the Beatles had recently become immersed in London. According to Reising and LeBlanc, along with &quot;Rain&quot;, it marks the start of the band&#x27;s body of work embracing psychedelia, which continued through &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; and the new songs recorded in 1967 for the animated film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, together with their singles over those two years. The authors view Lennon and Harrison&#x27;s compositions as the most overtly psychedelic and find the genre&#x27;s traits evident in the album&#x27;s instrumentation and soundscapes, and in its lyrical imagery. Music critic Jim DeRogatis views the LP as an early work in the psychedelic rock genre, which accompanied the emergence of counterculture ideology in the 1960s.

Through its individual tracks, &quot;Revolver&quot; covers a wide range of styles, including acid rock, chamber music, R&amp;B, raga rock, musique concrète, as well as standard contemporary rock and pop. In Rodriguez&#x27;s view, the influence of Indian music permeates the album. Aside from the sounds and vocal styling used on much of the recording, this influence is evident in the limited chord changes in some of the songs, suggesting an Indian-style drone. According to cultural historian Simon Philo, &quot;Revolver&quot; contained &quot;[the] most sustained deployment of Indian instruments, musical form and even religious philosophy&quot; heard in popular music up to that time. Writing for &quot;Slate&quot;, Jack Hamilton calls the album&#x27;s music &quot;avante-garde R&amp;B&quot;, showcasing the musicians&#x27; debt to African-American music.

In its lyrical themes, the album marks a radical departure from the Beatles&#x27; past work, as a large majority of the songs avoid the subject of love. According to Reising and LeBlanc, the lyrics on this and the band&#x27;s later psychedelic records capture the psychedelic culture&#x27;s belief in the truth-revealing qualities of LSD over the illusions of bourgeois thinking; reject materialism in favour of Asian-inspired spirituality; and explore the overlap in meaning between a &quot;trip&quot; and travelling, resulting in narratives in which time and space become blurred. Where the songs do present as love songs, the authors continue, love is often conveyed as a unifying force among many, rather than between two individuals, or as a &quot;way of life&quot;.

Author and critic Kenneth Womack writes of the Beatles exploring &quot;phenomenologies of consciousness&quot; on &quot;Revolver&quot;, and he cites as examples &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot; preoccupation with dreams and the references to death in the lyrics to &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;. In Womack&#x27;s estimation, the songs represent two important elements of the human life cycle that are &quot;philosophical opposites&quot;. Echoing this point, music critic Tim Riley writes that, just as &quot;embracing life means accepting death&quot;, the fourteen tracks &quot;link a disillusioned view of the modern world... with a belief in metaphysical transcendence&quot;. Philo finds the Beatles&#x27; &quot;countercultural engagement&quot; evident on even the songs that present as standard pop. In Reising&#x27;s view, all the songs on &quot;Revolver&quot; are linked, in that each line in &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, the closing track, is alluded to or explored in the lyrics to one or more of the tracks that precede it.

=== Side one ===
==== &quot;Taxman&quot; ====
Harrison wrote &quot;Taxman&quot; as a protest against the high marginal tax rates paid by top earners like the Beatles, which, under Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour government, amounted to 95 per cent of unearned income (i.e. interest on savings and investments) above the top threshold. The song&#x27;s spoken count-in is out of tempo with the performance that follows, a device that Riley credits with establishing the &quot;new studio aesthetic of &quot;Revolver&quot;&quot;. Harrison&#x27;s vocals on the track were treated with heavy compression and ADT. In addition to playing a glissandi-inflected bass part reminiscent of Motown James Jamerson, McCartney performed the song&#x27;s guitar solo. The latter section was also edited onto the end of the original recording, ensuring that the track closed with the solo reprised over a fadeout. Rodriguez recognises &quot;Taxman&quot; as the first Beatles song written about &quot;topical concerns&quot;; he also cites its &quot;abrasive sneer&quot; as a precursor to the 1970s punk rock movement. Completed with input from Lennon, the lyrics refer by name to Wilson, who had just been re-elected as prime minister in the 1966 general election, and Edward Heath, the Conservative Leader of the Opposition.

==== &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; ====
Womack describes McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; as a &quot;narrative about the perils of loneliness&quot;. The story involves the title character, who is an ageing spinster, and a lonely priest named Father McKenzie who writes &quot;sermon[s] that no one will hear&quot;. He presides over Rigby&#x27;s funeral and acknowledges that despite his efforts, &quot;no one was saved&quot;. The first McCartney composition to depart from the themes of a standard love song, its lyrics were the product of a group effort, with Harrison, Starr, Lennon and the latter&#x27;s friend Pete Shotton all contributing. While Lennon and Harrison supplied harmonies beside McCartney&#x27;s lead vocal, no Beatle played on the recording; instead, Martin arranged the track for a string octet, drawing inspiration from Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s 1960 film score for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot;. In Riley&#x27;s opinion, &quot;the corruption of &#x27;Taxman&#x27; and the utter finality of Eleanor&#x27;s fate makes the world of &quot;Revolver&quot; more ominous than any other pair of opening songs could.&quot;

==== &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot; ====
Author Peter Doggett describes &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot; as &quot;Half acid dream, half latent Lennon laziness personified.&quot; As with &quot;Rain&quot;, the basic track was recorded at a faster tempo before being subjected to varispeeding. The latter treatment, along with ADT, was also applied to Lennon&#x27;s vocal as he sought to replicate, in MacDonald&#x27;s description, a &quot;papery old man&#x27;s voice&quot;. For the guitar solo, Harrison recorded two separate lines: the first with a clean sound, while on the second, he played his Gibson SG through a fuzzbox. Beatles biographer Jonathan Gould views the solo as appearing to &quot;suspend the laws of time and motion to simulate the half-coherence of the state between wakefulness and sleep&quot;. Musicologist Walter Everett likens the song to a &quot;particularly expressive text painting&quot;.

==== &quot;Love You To&quot; ====
&quot;Love You To&quot; marked Harrison&#x27;s first foray into Hindustani classical music as a composer, following his introduction of the sitar on &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; in 1965. He recorded the track with only minimal contributions from Starr and McCartney, and no input from Lennon; Indian musicians from the Asian Music Circle provided instrumentation such as tabla, tambura and sitar. Author Peter Lavezzoli recognises the song as &quot;the first conscious attempt in pop to emulate a non-Western form of music in structure and instrumentation&quot;. Aside from playing sitar on the track, Harrison&#x27;s contributions included fuzztone-effected electric guitar. Everett identifies the song&#x27;s change of metre as unprecedented in the Beatles&#x27; work and a characteristic that would go on to feature prominently on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Partly influenced by Harrison&#x27;s use of LSD, the lyrics address the singer&#x27;s desire for &quot;immediate sexual gratification&quot;, according to Womack, and serve as a &quot;rallying call to accept our inner hedonism and release our worldly inhibitions&quot;.

==== &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; ====
&quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; is a ballad that McCartney wrote towards the end of the &quot;Revolver&quot; sessions. His inspiration for the song was the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; track &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, which, in turn, Brian Wilson had been inspired to write after repeatedly listening to &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. McCartney&#x27;s double-tracked vocal was treated with varispeeding, resulting in a higher pitch at playback. The song&#x27;s opening lines are sung in free time before its 4/4 time signature is established; according to Everett, &quot;nowhere else does a Beatles introduction so well prepare a listener for the most striking and expressive tonal events that lie ahead.&quot; Womack characterises the song as a romantic ballad &quot;about living in the here and now&quot; and &quot;fully experiencing the conscious moment&quot;. He notes that, with the preceding track, &quot;Love You To&quot;, the album expresses &quot;corresponding examinations of the human experience of physical and romantic love&quot;.

==== &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; ====
McCartney and Lennon wrote &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; as a children&#x27;s song and for Starr&#x27;s vocal spot on the album. The lyrics were written with assistance from Scottish singer Donovan and tell of life on a sea voyage accompanied by friends. Gould considers the song&#x27;s childlike qualities to be &quot;deceptive&quot; and that, once in the studio, it became &quot;a sophisticated sonic pastiche&quot;.

On 1 June, the Beatles and some of their friends enhanced the festive nautical atmosphere by adding sounds such as chains, bells, whistles, tubs of water and clinking glasses, all sourced from Studio 2&#x27;s trap room. To fill the portion after the lyrics refer to a brass band playing, Martin and Emerick used a recording from EMI&#x27;s library, splicing up the taped copy and rearranging the melody. Lennon shouted part of the mid-song ship&#x27;s orders in an echo chamber. In the final verse, he repeats Starr&#x27;s vocal lines in a manner that Gould likens to &quot;an old vaudevillian with the crowd in the palm of his hand&quot;. Riley recognises the song as mixing the comedy of &quot;The Goon Show&quot; with the satire of Spike Jones. Donovan later said that &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; represented the Beatles&#x27; predicament as prisoners of their international fame, to which they reacted by singing an uplifting, communal song.

==== &quot;She Said She Said&quot; ====
The light atmosphere of &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; is broken by what Riley terms &quot;the outwardly harnessed, but inwardly raging guitar&quot; that introduces Lennon&#x27;s &quot;She Said She Said&quot;. The song marks the second time that a Beatles arrangement used a shifting metre, after &quot;Love You To&quot;, as the foundation of 4/4 briefly switches to 3/4. Harrison recalled that he helped Lennon finish the composition, which involved joining three separate fragments of song. Having walked out of the session, McCartney may or may not have contributed bass guitar to the recording. In addition to lead guitar and harmony vocals, Harrison possibly performed the bass guitar part.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howlett/Revolver&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The lyric was inspired in part by a conversation that Lennon and Harrison had with actor Peter Fonda in Los Angeles in August 1965, while all three, along with Starr and members of the Byrds, were under the influence of LSD. During the conversation, Fonda commented, &quot;I know what it&#x27;s like to be dead&quot;, because as a child he had technically died during an operation.

=== Side two ===
==== &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; ====
&quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; was written by McCartney, whose piano playing dominates the recording. The track was one of several contemporary songs that evoked the unusually hot and sunny English summer of 1966. Music critic Richie Unterberger describes it as a song that conveys &quot;one of the first fine days of spring, just after you&#x27;ve fallen in love or started a vacation&quot;. The verses reflect aspects of vaudeville, while McCartney also acknowledged the influence of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful on the composition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unterberger/AM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Overdubbed by Martin, the piano solo on the track recalls the ragtime style of Scott Joplin. The song ends with group harmonies repeating the title phrase, creating an effect that Riley likens to a &quot;cascade&quot; of voices &quot;enter[ing] from different directions, like sun peeping through the trees&quot;.

==== &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; ====
&quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; was written primarily by Lennon, with McCartney saying he helped on the lyric and estimating the song as &quot;80–20&quot; to Lennon. Harrison and McCartney played dual lead-guitar parts on the recording, including an ascending riff that Riley terms &quot;magnetic ... everything sticks to it&quot;. Riley describes the composition as a &quot;shaded putdown&quot; in the style of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Positively 4th Street&quot;, whereby Lennon sings to someone who has seen &quot;seven wonders&quot; yet is unable to empathise with him and his feelings of isolation. According to Gould, the song was directed at Frank Sinatra after Lennon had read a hagiographic article on the singer, in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, in which Sinatra was lauded as &quot;the fully emancipated male ... the man who can have he wants&quot;.

==== &quot;For No One&quot; ====
&quot;For No One&quot; was inspired by McCartney&#x27;s relationship with English actress Jane Asher. Along with &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot;, which similarly dispensed with guitar parts for Harrison and Lennon, Rodriguez cites the track as an example of McCartney eschewing the group dynamic when recording his songs, a trend that would prove unpopular with his bandmates in later years. The recording features McCartney playing piano, bass and clavichord, accompanied by Starr on drums and percussion. The French horn solo was added by Alan Civil, the principal horn player for the Philharmonia Orchestra, who recalled having to &quot;busk&quot; his part, with little guidance from McCartney or Martin at the overdubbing session. While recognising McCartney&#x27;s &quot;customary logic&quot; in the song&#x27;s musical structure, MacDonald comments on the sense of detachment conveyed in the lyrics to this &quot;curiously phlegmatic account of the end of an affair&quot;. MacDonald suggests that McCartney was attempting to employ the same &quot;dry cinematic eye&quot; that director John Schlesinger had adopted in his 1965 film &quot;Darling&quot;.

==== &quot;Doctor Robert&quot; ====
&quot;Doctor Robert&quot; was written by Lennon, although McCartney has since stated he co-authored it. A guitar-based rock song in the style of &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot;, its lyrics celebrate a New York physician known for dispensing amphetamine injections to his patients. On the recording, the hard-driving performance is interrupted by two bridge sections where, over harmonium and chiming guitar chords, the group vocals suggest a choir praising the doctor for his services.

==== &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot; ====
Harrison said he wrote &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot; about &quot;the avalanche of thoughts&quot; that he found hard to express in words. Supporting the lyrics, his stammering guitar riff, combined with the dissonance employed in the song&#x27;s melody, conveys the difficulties of achieving meaningful communication. The prominent backing vocals from Lennon and McCartney include Indian-style gamak ornamentation in McCartney&#x27;s high harmony, similar to the melisma effect used in &quot;Love You To&quot;. Reising and LeBlanc cite the song as an early example of how from 1966 onwards the Beatles&#x27; lyrics &quot;adopted an urgent tone, intent on channeling some essential knowledge, the psychological and/or philosophical epiphanies of LSD experience&quot; to their increasingly aware audience. According to author and academic Nick Bromell, &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot; and the next two tracks on &quot;Revolver&quot; are the first examples of pop music &quot;giving voice to the complexities of the breakthrough experience&quot; afforded by LSD and other psychedelic drugs.
==== &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot; ====
Described by Riley as the album&#x27;s &quot;most derivative cut&quot;, &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot; was influenced by the Motown Sound and written by McCartney after he had seen Stevie Wonder perform at the Scotch of St James nightclub in February. The horn players on the track included members of Georgie Fame&#x27;s group, the Blue Flames. To capture the desired sound, microphones were placed in the bells of the brass instruments, and the signals were heavily limited. A month later, a tape copy of these horn parts was superimposed with a slight delay, thereby doubling the presence of the brass contributions. Rodriguez terms the completed track &quot;an R&amp;B-styled shouter&quot;. Although cast in the form of a love song, McCartney described the lyric as &quot;an ode to pot, like someone else might write an ode to chocolate or a good claret&quot;. The initial version of the song, as issued on &quot;Anthology 2&quot;, featured acoustic backing and organ, and a harmonised refrain of &quot;I need your love&quot;, which was replaced by Harrison&#x27;s guitar break on the more uptempo remake.

==== &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; ====

Rodriguez describes Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; as &quot;the greatest leap into the future&quot; of the Beatles&#x27; recording career up to this point. The recording includes reverse guitar, processed vocals, and looped tape effects, accompanying a strongly syncopated, repetitive drum-beat. Lennon adapted the lyrics from Timothy Leary&#x27;s book &quot;The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on The Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;, which equates the realisations brought about through LSD with the spiritually enlightened state achieved through meditation. Originally known as &quot;Mark I&quot;, and then briefly &quot;The Void&quot;, the eventual title came via one of Starr&#x27;s malapropisms.
Lennon intended the track as an evocation of a Tibetan Buddhist ceremony. The song&#x27;s harmonic structure is derived from Indian music and is based on a high-volume C drone played by Harrison on a tambura. Over the foundation of tambura, bass and drums, the five tape loops comprise various manipulated sounds: two separate sitar passages, played backwards and sped up; an orchestra sounding a B chord; McCartney&#x27;s laughter, sped up to resemble a seagull&#x27;s cry; and a Mellotron played on either its flute, string or brass setting. The Leslie speaker treatment applied to Lennon&#x27;s vocal originated from his request that Martin make him sound like he was the Dalai Lama singing from the top of a high mountain. Reising describes &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; as the inspiration for an album that &quot;illuminates a path dedicated to personal freedom and mind expansion&quot;. He views the song&#x27;s message as a precursor to the more explicitly political statements the Beatles would make over the next two years, in &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot;.

===North American format===
&quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot;, &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; and &quot;Doctor Robert&quot; were the tracks omitted from Capitol&#x27;s version of &quot;Revolver&quot;. In the case of &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot;, the version issued on &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot; was a different mix from that included on EMI&#x27;s &quot;Revolver&quot;. Due to the exclusion of the three Lennon tracks, there were only two songs on the Capitol release for which he was the principal writer, compared with three by Harrison and six by McCartney. In Riley&#x27;s opinion, aside from underplaying Lennon&#x27;s contribution, his voice is thereby confined to a &quot;sudden swing to the surreal&quot; at the end of each LP side, which distorts the intended mood across the album.

The eleven-song North American LP was the band&#x27;s tenth album on Capitol Records and twelfth US album in total. The release of &quot;Revolver&quot; marked the last time that Capitol issued an altered UK Beatles album for the North American market. When the Beatles re-signed with EMI in January 1967, their contract stipulated that Capitol could no longer alter the track listings of their albums.

== Packaging ==
=== Artwork ===

The cover for &quot;Revolver&quot; was created by German-born bassist and artist Klaus Voormann, one of the Beatles&#x27; oldest friends from their time in Hamburg during the early 1960s. Voormann&#x27;s artwork was part line drawing and part collage, using photographs mostly taken over 1964–65 by Robert Freeman. In his line drawings of the four Beatles (McCartney, Lennon, Harrison and Starr, clockwise from top-left), Voormann drew inspiration from the work of the nineteenth-century illustrator Aubrey Beardsley, who was the subject of a long-running exhibition at London&#x27;s Victoria and Albert Museum in 1966 and highly influential on fashion and design themes of the time. Voormann placed the various photos within the tangle of hair that connects the four faces. Turner writes that the drawings show each Beatle &quot;in another state of consciousness&quot;, such that the older images appear to be tumbling out from them.

Voormann&#x27;s aim was to reflect the radical departure in sound represented, particularly by &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stummer/Guardian&quot;&gt;Stummer, Robin (23 July 2016). &quot;How I drew a pop art masterpiece for the Beatles – a snip at just £50&quot; . &quot;The Observer&quot;/theguardian.com. Retrieved 26 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and his choice of a black-and-white cover was in deliberate defiance of the preference for vivid colour. When he submitted his work to the Beatles, Epstein wept, overjoyed that Voormann had managed to capture the experimental tone of the Beatles&#x27; new music. Voormann also designed a series of four images, titled &quot;Wood Face&quot;, &quot;Wool Face&quot;, &quot;Triangle Face&quot; and &quot;Sun Face&quot;, which appeared on the front of the Northern Songs sheet music for each of the album&#x27;s songs.
The LP&#x27;s back cover included a photograph of the Beatles, in Riley&#x27;s description, &quot;shaded by the hip modesty of sunglasses and cigarette smoke&quot;. The photo was part of a series taken by Robert Whitaker during the filming at Abbey Road on 19 May and demonstrated the Beatles&#x27; adoption of fashions from boutiques that had recently opened in Chelsea, rather than the Carnaby Street designers they had favoured previously. From these Chelsea boutiques, Lennon wore a long-collared paisley shirt from Granny Takes a Trip, while Harrison was dressed in a wide-lapelled velvet jacket designed by Hung on You. Turner views the selection of attire as reflective of the Beatles &quot;still dressing similarly yet with an individual stamp&quot;; he identifies the choice of sunglasses as another example of a unified yet personalised look, whereby the styles ranged from oblong-shaped lenses, for Lennon, to an oval-shaped pair worn by Starr. Gould, who describes Starr&#x27;s glasses as &quot;ludicrously bug-eyed&quot;, considers the cover design to be consistent with the &quot;break with the past&quot; ethos that had guided the album&#x27;s creation.

During the same photo shoot, Whitaker took pictures of the Beatles examining orange transparencies of his &quot;butcher cover&quot; design for &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;. The latter image proved instantly controversial in America due to its depiction of dismembered baby dolls and raw meat.

=== Title ===
The album&#x27;s title, like that of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, is a pun, referring to both a kind of handgun and the &quot;revolving&quot; motion of a record as it plays on a turntable. Gould views the title as a &quot;McLuhanesque pun&quot;, since, more so than on their previous albums, the focus of &quot;Revolver&quot; appears to rotate from one Beatle to another with each song.

The group had originally wanted to call the album &quot;Abracadabra&quot;, until they discovered that another band had already used it. When discussing possible alternatives, during their German tour, Lennon opted for &quot;Four Sides to the Circle&quot; in response to McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Magic Circle&quot;, and Starr jokingly suggested &quot;After Geography&quot;, a play on the title of the Rolling Stones&#x27; recently released &quot;Aftermath&quot; LP. Other suggestions included &quot;Bubble and Squeak&quot;, &quot;Beatles on Safari&quot;, &quot;Freewheelin&#x27; Beatles&quot; and &quot;Pendulum&quot; before the band settled on &quot;Revolver&quot;. They confirmed their choice in a telegram to EMI, sent from the Tokyo Hilton on 2 July.

== Release ==

In mid-May 1966, Tony Hall of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; wrote a preview of the Beatles&#x27; new recordings in which he opined that some of them were &quot;the most revolutionary ever made by a pop group&quot;. While avoiding mention of the official song titles, he highlighted Lennon&#x27;s &quot;The Void&quot; for its electronic effects, along with a &quot;McCartney song about lonely people&quot; set to string orchestration, and a &quot;Harrison number on which he plays a long exotic solo on sitar&quot;. In Britain, EMI gradually distributed the album&#x27;s songs to radio stations throughout July – a strategy that MacDonald describes as &quot;building anticipation for what would clearly be a radical new phase in the group&#x27;s recording career&quot;. &quot;Revolver&quot; was released there on 5 August and on 8 August in the United States. &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; was issued as a double A-side single with &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. The pairing of a ballad devoid of any instrumentation played by a Beatle and a novelty song marked a significant departure from the usual content of the band&#x27;s singles.

Schaffner likens the Beatles&#x27; 1966 recordings to the moment of transformation in the film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;where, when Dorothy discovers herself transported from Kansas to Oz, the film dramatically changes from black-and-white to glorious technicolor&quot;. The album appeared a year before psychedelic drugs became a phenomenon in youth culture, and it was the source of confusion for the group&#x27;s more conservative fans. A female writer later complained in &quot;Beatles Monthly&quot; that 1966 represented the end of &quot;The Beatles we used to know before they went stark, raving mad&quot;. In this way, &quot;Revolver&quot; marked the start of a change in the Beatles&#x27; core audience, as their young, female-dominated fanbase gave way to a following that increasingly comprised more serious-minded, male listeners.

The release coincided with a period of public relations challenges for the band, the combination of which led to their decision to retire from touring following the end of their North American tour, on 29 August. In the US, the album&#x27;s release was a secondary event to the controversy surrounding the recent publication there of Cleave&#x27;s interview with Lennon, in which he remarked that the Beatles had become &quot;more popular than Jesus&quot;. This episode followed the unfavourable reaction to the &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot; butcher sleeve, from the press, radio stations and retail outlets. As a result, at press conferences during the tour, questions were typically focused on religious matters rather than the band&#x27;s new music. In addition, the group were vocal in their opposition to the Vietnam War, a stand that further redefined their public image in the US. The Beatles did not attempt to perform any of the songs from &quot;Revolver&quot; during the tour.

Reporting on &quot;Swinging London&quot; for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Richard Goldstein said that, as if in response to the antagonism being shown towards the band in the US, &quot;British youth has flipped completely over the new Beatle album, &quot;Revolver&quot;.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein/VV&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Author Howard Sounes writes that, amid the fine weather of the 1966 summer and England&#x27;s recent win in the World Cup, &quot;Revolver&quot; was the nation&#x27;s &quot;soundtrack album of the season&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
In the UK, where &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; was the favoured side, the single became the best-selling song of 1966, after topping the national chart for four weeks during August and September. On &quot;Record Retailer&quot;″s LPs chart (later the UK Albums Chart), &quot;Revolver&quot; entered at number 1 and stayed there for seven weeks during its 34-week run in the top 40. On the national chart compiled by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, the album was number 1 for nine weeks. By October, at least ten of the LP&#x27;s songs had been covered by other artists and reviewed by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. Among these, Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers&#x27; version of &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot;, which McCartney co-produced, was a top ten hit. McCartney&#x27;s ballads &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; and &quot;For No One&quot; became highly popular among mainstream recording artists. In the UK, &quot;Revolver&quot; was the second highest-selling album of 1966, behind &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mawer/1966&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the &quot;NME&quot; readers&#x27; poll for 1966, &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; were jointly recognised as the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Album of the Year&quot;.
In America, Capitol were wary of the religious references in &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, given the ongoing controversy, and instead pushed &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. The latter peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making it, in Gould&#x27;s description, &quot;the first &#x27;designated&#x27; Beatles single since 1963&quot; not to top that chart. On the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart, &quot;Revolver&quot; hit number 1 on 10 September, a week after the end of &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;″s five-week run at the top. The Beatles were presented with gold discs from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), recognising the album as a &quot;million seller&quot;, during their 24 August press conference at the Capitol Tower in Hollywood. &quot;Revolver&quot; was number 1 there for six weeks and remained on the chart until mid February 1968. In March 1967, &quot;Revolver&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Voormann&#x27;s cover design won the Grammy for Best Album Cover, Graphic Arts.

Based on retail sales up to early October 1966, &quot;Revolver&quot; was the eighth-highest-selling album of the year in the US. Although commercially successful, it ranked only equal tenth (with &quot;Help!&quot;) on the list of the Beatles&#x27; biggest-selling albums in the US, as supplied by Allen Klein in 1970. According to figures published in 2009 by former Capitol executive David Kronemyer, further to estimates he gave in &quot;MuseWire&quot; magazine, the album had sold 1,187,869 copies in the US by 31 December 1966 and 1,725,276 copies by the end of the decade.

The April 1987 CD release of &quot;Revolver&quot; standardised the track listing to the original UK version. &quot;Revolver&quot; returned to the UK Albums Chart the following month, peaking at number 55, while the 2009 remastered album reached number 9. In 2013, after the British Phonographic Industry altered its sales award protocol, the album was certified Platinum based on UK sales since 1994. In January 2014, the Capitol version of &quot;Revolver&quot; was issued on CD for the first time, both as part of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;U.S. Albums&quot; box set and as an individual release. As of that year, &quot;Revolver&quot; had been certified 5× Platinum by the RIAA.

== Critical reception ==
=== Contemporary reviews ===
In Britain, the reception to &quot;Revolver&quot; was highly favourable. Having found &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; &quot;almost monotonous&quot; at times, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; lauded the new release, saying it was a work that would &quot;change the direction of pop music&quot;. The reviewer highlighted its &quot;electronic effects&quot;, McCartney&#x27;s &quot;penchant for the classics&quot; and Harrison&#x27;s &quot;stunning use of the sitar&quot; as diverse elements that distinguished the LP as a group effort, such that the four band members&#x27; &quot;individual personalities are now showing through loud and clear&quot;. The writer concluded: &quot;this is a brilliant album which underlines once and for all that the Beatles have definitely broken the bounds of what we used to call pop.&quot; Peter Clayton, a jazz critic for &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine, described it as &quot;an astonishing collection&quot; that defied easy categorisation since much of the LP had no precedent in the context of pop music. Clayton concluded: &quot;if there&#x27;s anything wrong with the record at all it is that such a diet of newness might give the ordinary pop-picker indigestion.&quot;

Edward Greenfield of &quot;The Guardian&quot; titled his review &quot;Thinking Pop&quot; and wrote that the three Beatles songwriters &quot;habitually go outside the realm of sloppy love-theme, and find inspiration instead (as serious artists always must) in specific feelings and specific experiences&quot;. Highlighting the importance of McCartney&#x27;s classical aesthetic, he recognised the band&#x27;s ongoing success as &quot;fair vindication&quot; for popular taste in terms of its alignment with artistic merit. In their joint review for &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, Richard Green and Peter Jones found the album &quot;full of musical ingenuity&quot; yet &quot;controversial&quot;, and added: &quot;There are parts that will split the pop fraternity neatly down the middle.&quot; In her round-up of 1966 for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, Maureen Cleave named &quot;Revolver&quot; and the single as the year&#x27;s best records, although she rued that, together with Mick Jagger, the Beatles had become aloof in that, &quot;Unlike anybody else, they seemed to know what they wanted.&quot;
Due to the controversies surrounding the Beatles during their tour, critical reaction in the US was muted relative to the band&#x27;s previous releases. According to Rodriguez, in redefining the limits of pop music, &quot;Revolver&quot; emphasised the need for genuine rock criticism, a form of journalism that only became commonplace from 1967. &quot;KRLA Beat&quot; reviewer described &quot;Revolver&quot; as &quot;a musical creation of exceptional excellence&quot; but lamented that, amid the continued acclaim for &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, &quot;it is receiving only a fraction of the attention and respect due&quot;, and some Americans were overly focusing on the band&#x27;s &quot;political views&quot;. Writing in the recently launched &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot;, Paul Williams gave the US LP a mixed review, in which he admired &quot;Love You To&quot; and &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; but derided &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; and &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. Williams lauded the album&#x27;s musical range but found it lacked an integral quality, which he acknowledged was outside the group&#x27;s control.

According to Turner, the album&#x27;s combination of novel sounds and unusual subject matter &quot;challenged all the conventions of pop&quot; and it was the upcoming generation of writers who &quot;got it immediately&quot;. Ralph J. Gleason, then the jazz critic for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, wrote it was &quot;the most outstanding pop album in years, possibly the best of all time&quot;, with &quot;[n]ot a single disappointing track&quot;. In his article for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Richard Goldstein described &quot;Revolver&quot; as &quot;a revolutionary record&quot; that was &quot;as important to the expansion of pop as was &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;&quot;, and one that demanded that the genre&#x27;s &quot;boundaries... be re-negotiated&quot;. He added: &quot;it seems now that we will view this album in retrospect as a key work in the development of rock and roll into an artistic pursuit ...&quot; Another writer identified by Turner, Jules Siegel, likened &quot;Revolver&quot; to works by John Donne, John Milton and William Shakespeare, saying that the band&#x27;s lyrics would provide the basis for scholarly analysis well into the future.

Recalling &quot;Revolver&quot;″s release in his book &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot;, Ian MacDonald says that the Beatles &quot;initiated a second pop revolution – one which while galvanising their existing rivals and inspiring many new ones, left all of them far behind&quot;. In a February 1967 review, &quot;Hit Parader&quot; declared: &quot;&quot;Revolver&quot; represents the pinnacle of pop music. No group has been as consistently creative as the Beatles, though the [Lovin&#x27;] Spoonful and Beach Boys are coming closer all the time ... Rather than analyze the music we just suggest that you listen to &quot;Revolver&quot; three or four times a day and marvel ...&quot; Later that year, in &quot;Esquire&quot;, Robert Christgau said the album was &quot;twice as good and four times as startling as &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, with sound effects, Oriental drones, jazz bands, transcendentalist lyrics, all kinds of rhythmic and harmonic surprises, and a filter that made John Lennon sound like God singing through a foghorn&quot;.
=== Retrospective assessments ===

In the 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Rob Sheffield wrote that &quot;Revolver&quot; found the Beatles &quot;at the peak of their powers, competing with one another because nobody else could touch them&quot;; he described it as &quot;the best album the Beatles ever made, which means the best album by anybody&quot;. Writing for &quot;PopMatters&quot; that year, David Medsker said that &quot;Revolver&quot; showed the four band members &quot;peaking at the exact same time&quot;, and he deemed it to be &quot;the best of the bunch, the letter that went unanswered&quot; among a series of reciprocally influential musical statements exchanged between the Beatles and the Beach Boys over 1965–67.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medsker/PM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 appraisal of the band&#x27;s albums, Henry Yates of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine paired it with &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s&quot; as the two &quot;essential classics&quot; in the Beatles&#x27; canon and described it as &quot;Always the rock fraternity&#x27;s favourite (and the blueprint for Noel Gallagher&#x27;s career)&quot;. Writing in &quot;Paste&quot;, Mark Kemp says that the album &quot;completed [the Beatles&#x27;] transformation from the mop tops of three years earlier into bold, groundbreaking experimental rockers&quot;, while Paul Du Noyer, in a review for &quot;Blender&quot;, said that it marked the group&#x27;s arrival as &quot;psychedelic gurus&quot; and was a work in which the Beatles &quot;revolutionized their own style and rock music itself... with the boldest innovations of the band&#x27;s career&quot;.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic describes &quot;Revolver&quot; as &quot;the ultimate modern pop album&quot;. While noting the diverse musical directions adopted by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison in their respective contributions, he states: &quot;The biggest miracle of &quot;Revolver&quot; may be that the Beatles covered so much new stylistic ground and executed it perfectly on one record, or it may be that all of it holds together perfectly.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Neil McCormick says that the album shows the band at their most unified and is a work in which &quot;they introduce whole new vistas of sound yet still contain them within tightly structured and performed songs.&quot; He also attributes an acerbic quality to the album that psychedelia lacked once the genre succumbed to &quot;the woolly politics of flower power&quot;. Scott Plagenhoef of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; views &quot;Revolver&quot; as a &quot;sonic landmark&quot; that, in its lyrics, &quot;matur[ed] pop from the stuff of teen dreams to a more serious pursuit that actively reflected and shaped the times in which its creators lived&quot;. He considers it to be McCartney&#x27;s &quot;maturation record&quot; as a songwriter in the same way that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; had been for Lennon.

Chris Coplan of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; is less impressed with the album, rating it a &quot;B&quot; and &quot;the black sheep of the Beatles&#x27; catalog&quot;. Although he admires the psychedelic tone, he considers that this experimentalism renders the more standard pop songs, such as &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot; and &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;, &quot;seemingly out of place&quot; within the collection. Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham describes it as &quot;clearly brilliant&quot; but adds: &quot;There&#x27;s an edge to the sound and a danger in the air... that makes listening to it an uncomfortable trip. It&#x27;s easy to admire, even to be awed by, but some listeners find &quot;Revolver&quot; a little harder to love.&quot; In retrospect, Christgau says he prefers &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and &quot;Abbey Road&quot; to &quot;Revolver&quot;, finding the latter &quot;somewhat cluttered&quot; but nevertheless worthy of a &quot;high A minus&quot;.

== Influence and legacy ==
=== Development of popular music and 1960s counterculture ===

MacDonald deems Lennon&#x27;s remark about the Beatles&#x27; &quot;god-like status&quot; in March 1966 to have been &quot;fairly realistic&quot;, given the reaction to &quot;Revolver&quot;. He adds: &quot;The album&#x27;s aural invention was so masterful that it seemed to Western youth that The Beatles – that they had the key to current events and were somehow orchestrating them through their records.&quot; MacDonald highlights &quot;the radically subversive&quot; message of &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; – exhorting listeners to empty their minds of all ego- and material-related thought – as the inauguration of a &quot;till-then élite-preserved concept of mind-expansion into pop, simultaneously drawing attention to consciousness-enhancing drugs and the ancient religious philosophies of the Orient&quot;. Author Shawn Levy writes that the album presented an alternative reality that contemporary listeners felt compelled to explore further; he describes it as &quot;the first true drug album, not a pop record with some druggy insinuations, but an honest-to-heaven, steeped-in-the-out-there trip from the here and now into who knew where&quot;.

According to Simon Philo, &quot;Revolver&quot; announced the arrival of the &quot;underground London&quot; sound, supplanting that of Swinging London. Barry Miles describes the album as an &quot;advertisement for the underground&quot;, and recalls that it resounded on the level of experimental jazz among members of the movement, including those who soon founded the UFO Club. He says it established rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll as an art form and identifies its &quot;trailblazing&quot; quality as the impetus for Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; and for Brian Wilson to complete the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;mini-symphony&quot;, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. Citing composer and producer Virgil Moorefield&#x27;s book &quot;The Producer as Composer&quot;, author Jay Hodgson highlights &quot;Revolver&quot; as a &quot;dramatic turning point&quot; in recording history through its dedication to studio exploration over the &quot;performability&quot; of the songs, as this and subsequent Beatles albums reshaped listeners&#x27; preconceptions of a pop recording. In his review for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Plagenhoef says that the album not only &quot;redefin[ed] what was expected from popular music&quot;, but recast the Beatles as &quot;avatars for a transformative cultural movement&quot;. MacDonald cites &quot;Revolver&quot; as a musical statement that, further to the &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; track &quot;The Word&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot;, helped guide the counterculture towards the 1967 Summer of Love due to the widespread popularity of the Beatles.

&quot;Revolver&quot; has been recognised as having inspired new subgenres of music, anticipating electronica, punk rock, baroque rock and world music, among other styles. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the album &quot;signaled that in popular music, anything – any theme, any musical idea – could now be realized&quot;. Through the Beatles&#x27; example, psychedelia moved from its underground roots into the mainstream, thereby originating the longer-lasting psychedelic pop style.&lt;ref name=&quot;AM/PsychPop&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc credit the songs on &quot;Revolver&quot; with &quot;set[ting] the stage for an important subgenre of psychedelic music, that of the messianic pronouncement&quot;. As with &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, Walter Everett views the album&#x27;s &quot;experimental timbres, rhythms, tonal structures, and poetic texts&quot; as the inspiration for many of the bands that formed the progressive rock genre in the early 1970s. He also considers &quot;Revolver&quot; to be &quot;an innovative example of electronic music&quot; as much as it broke new ground in pop by being &quot;fundamentally unlike any rock album that had preceded it&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; attributes the development of the Los Angeles and San Francisco music scenes, including subsequent releases by the Beach Boys, Love and the Grateful Dead, to the influence of &quot;Revolver&quot;, particularly &quot;She Said She Said&quot;.

Steve Turner likens the Beatles&#x27; creative approach in 1966 to that of modern jazz musicians, and recognises their channelling of Indian and Western classical, Southern soul, and electronic musical styles into their work as unprecedented in popular music. He says that, through the band&#x27;s efforts to faithfully translate their LSD-inspired vision into music, &quot;&quot;Revolver&quot; opened the doors to psychedelic rock (or acid rock)&quot;, while the primitive means by which it was recorded (on four-track equipment) inspired the work that artists such as Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes and the Electric Light Orchestra were able to achieve with advances in studio technology. Turner also highlights the pioneering sampling and tape manipulation employed on &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; as having &quot;a profound effect on everyone from Jimi Hendrix to Jay-Z&quot;.

Rodriguez praises Martin and Emerick&#x27;s contribution to the album, saying that their talents were as essential to its success as the Beatles&#x27;. While also highlighting the importance of the production, David Howard writes that &quot;Revolver&quot; was a &quot;genre-transforming album&quot;, on which Martin and the Beatles had &quot;obliterated recording studio conventions&quot;. Combined with the similarly &quot;visionary&quot; work of American producer Phil Spector, Howard continues, through &quot;Revolver&quot;, the recording studio had become &quot;its own instrument; record production had been elevated into art.&quot;

=== Ascendancy over &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; ===

Whereas &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; had long been identified as the Beatles&#x27; greatest album, since the 2000s &quot;Revolver&quot; has often surpassed it in lists of the group&#x27;s best work. Sheffield cites the album&#x27;s 1987 CD release, with the full complement of Lennon compositions, as marking the start of a process whereby &quot;Revolver&quot; &quot;steadily climbed in public estimation&quot; to become recognised as the Beatles&#x27; finest work. Everett also attributes the &quot;problem&quot; regarding the album&#x27;s standing in the US to the &quot;inferior track listing&quot; available to Americans until the CD release. In Britain, its supremacy over &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was one of the cultural revisions established by the Britpop phenomenon in the 1990s. Writing on the BBC&#x27;s website in August 2016, Greg Kot identified the &quot;More popular than Christ&quot; controversy and the attention subsequently afforded the release of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; in 1967 as the two factors that had contributed to &quot;Revolver&quot; being relatively overlooked. Kot concluded that the ensuing decades had seen this impression reversed, since &quot;Revolver&quot; &quot;does everything Sgt Pepper did, except it did it first and often better. It just wasn&#x27;t as well-packaged and marketed.&quot;

Rodriguez writes that, whereas most contemporary acts shy away from attempting a concept album in the vein of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, the prototype established by &quot;Revolver&quot;, whereby an album serves as an &quot;eclectic collection of diverse songs&quot;, continues to influence modern popular music. He characterises &quot;Revolver&quot; as &quot;the Beatles&#x27; artistic high-water mark&quot; and says that, unlike &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, it was the product of a collaborative effort, with &quot;the group as a whole being fully vested in creating Beatle music&quot;.

=== Appearances on best-album lists and further recognition ===
&quot;Revolver&quot; has appeared high up in many lists of the best albums ever made, often in the top position. It was voted the third-best album of all time in the 1998 &quot;Music of the Millennium&quot; poll conducted by HMV and Channel 4, and in the following year&#x27;s expanded survey, which polled 600,000 people across the UK. Also in 1998, it was ranked first in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, directly ahead of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and &quot;The Beatles&quot;, and it was first again in the 2000 edition of the book. &quot;Q&quot; placed it at number 1 in its list of the &quot;50 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot; in 2000; four years later, the album topped the same magazine&#x27;s list &quot;The Music That Changed the World&quot;. In 2001, it topped VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Albums&quot;, compiled from a poll of more than 500 journalists, music executives and artists. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Revolver&quot; third on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, a position it retained on the magazine&#x27;s revised list nine years later.

In 2004, &quot;Revolver&quot; appeared at number 2 in &quot;The Observer&quot;″s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest British Albums&quot;, compiled by a panel of 100 contributors. In 2006, it was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 best albums and topped a similar list compiled by &quot;Hot Press&quot;. That same year, &quot;Guitar World&quot; readers chose it as the tenth best guitar album of all time. In 2010, &quot;Revolver&quot; was named the best pop album by the official newspaper of the Holy See, &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed the album at number 1 in its &quot;All-Time Greatest&quot; albums. In September 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Revolver&quot; at number 11 on its new list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;Revolver&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, an award bestowed by the American Recording Academy &quot;to honor recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance that are at least 25 years old&quot;. According to art and culture journalist Robin Stummer, writing in 2016, Voormann&#x27;s cover is similarly recognised as &quot;one of the finest pop artworks&quot;. The album has been the subject of several tribute albums, such as &quot;Revolver Reloaded&quot;, a multi-artist CD included with the July 2006 issue of &quot;Mojo&quot;. Beatles tribute bands have named themselves after &quot;Revolver&quot;, and Reising lists Revolver Records, the heavy metal magazine &quot;Revolver&quot; and Revolver Films as other examples that appear to honour the 1966 album. In his view, &quot;Like few other rock and roll recordings, &quot;Revolver&quot; has assumed the status of cultural icon, approaching in its many avatars, its impact and its endurance the status of some of the definitive works of Anglo–American culture such as Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; and James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;.&quot;

==Reissues==

Along with the rest of the Beatles catalogue, the album was first issued on compact disc in 1987. In 2009, Apple and EMI released remastered versions of the Beatles albums on CD. &quot;Revolver&quot; was also included in the box sets released at the time, &quot;The Beatles: Stereo Box Set&quot; and &quot;The Beatles in Mono Box Set&quot;.

On 28 October 2022, of &quot;Revolver&quot; was released. It includes a new stereo remix of the album by Giles Martin, with the help of de-mixing technology developed by Peter Jackson&#x27;s WingNut Films, as well as the original mono mix, session recordings, demos and an EP containing new mixes of &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot;.

== Track listing ==
The following track listing is for the original release in all markets other than North America and was subsequently adopted as the standard version of the album for its international CD release in 1987. The original North American edition used this order except for omitting &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot;, &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; and &quot;Doctor Robert&quot;. Those tracks were issued on the North American release of &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;. All tracks written by Lennon–McCartney, except for songs with asterisks, which are by George Harrison.

<doc id="74984" wikidata="Q1509470" url="?curid=74984" title="Suspicion (1941 film)">
<text>Suspicion is a 1941 American romantic psychological thriller film noir directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and starring Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine as a married couple. It also features Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Nigel Bruce, Dame May Whitty, Isabel Jeans, Heather Angel, and Leo G. Carroll. &quot;Suspicion&quot; is based on Francis Iles&#x27;s 1932 novel &quot;Before the Fact&quot;.

For her role as Lina, Joan Fontaine won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1941. This is the only Oscar-winning acting performance in an Alfred Hitchcock film. In the film, a romantically inexperienced woman marries a charming playboy after initially rejecting him. He turns out to be penniless, a gambler, and dishonest in the extreme. She comes to suspect that he is also a murderer, and that he is attempting to kill her.

==Plot==
In 1938, handsome, irresponsible playboy Johnnie Aysgarth meets bespectacled Lina McLaidlaw on a train in England and later persuades her to take a walk with him. She is defensive and suspects his motives; he insults her in a ploy to create familiarity. But later, at a window, she overhears her parents talking about her. They assume she will never marry, and hurt by this she kisses Johnnie.

She hopes to hear from him but he cancels their afternoon date and then vanishes. However, he returns for a hunt ball a week later and charms her into eventually eloping despite the strong disapproval of her wealthy father, General McLaidlaw. After a lavish honeymoon and returning to an extravagant house, Lina discovers that Johnnie has no job and no income, habitually lives on borrowed money, and was intending to try to sponge off her father. She talks him into getting a job, and he goes to work for his cousin, estate agent Captain Melbeck.

Gradually, Lina learns that Johnnie has continued to gamble wildly, despite promising to quit, and that to pay a gambling debt, he sold two antique chairs (family heirlooms) that her father had given her as a wedding present. Beaky, Johnnie&#x27;s good-natured but naive friend, tries to reassure Lina that her husband is a lot of fun and a highly entertaining liar. She repeatedly catches Johnnie in ever more significant lies, discovering that he was fired weeks before for embezzling from Melbeck, who says he will not prosecute if the money is repaid.

Lina writes a letter to Johnnie that she is leaving him but then tears it up. After this Johnnie enters the room and shows her a telegram announcing her father&#x27;s death. Johnnie is severely disappointed to discover that Lina has inherited no money, only her father&#x27;s portrait. He persuades Beaky to finance a hugely speculative land development scheme. Lina is afraid this is a confidence trick or worse and futilely tries to talk Beaky out of it. Johnnie overhears and angrily warns his wife to stay out of his affairs but later he calls the whole thing off.

When Beaky leaves for Paris, Johnnie accompanies him partway. Later, news reaches Lina that Beaky died in Paris. Johnnie lies to her and an investigating police inspector, saying that he (Johnnie) stayed in London. This and other details lead Lina to suspect he was responsible for Beaky&#x27;s death.

Lina then begins to fear that her husband is plotting to kill her for her life insurance. He has been questioning her friend Isobel Sedbusk, a writer of mystery novels, about untraceable poisons. Johnnie brings Lina a glass of milk before bed, but she is too afraid to drink it. Needing to get away for a while, she says she will stay with her mother for a few days. Johnnie insists on driving her there. He speeds recklessly in a powerful convertible on a dangerous road beside a cliff. Lina&#x27;s door unexpectedly swings open. Johnnie reaches over, his intent unclear to the terrified woman. When she shrinks from him, he stops the car.

In the subsequent confrontation, Johnnie asserts that he was actually intending to commit suicide after taking Lina to her mother&#x27;s. At this time he states that he has decided that suicide is the coward&#x27;s way out, and is resolved to face his responsibilities, even to the point of going to prison for the embezzlement. He reveals being in Liverpool at the time of Beaky&#x27;s death, trying to borrow on Lina&#x27;s life insurance policy to repay Melbeck. Her suspicions allayed, Lina asks him to go home and see it all through together. Johnnie initially refuses but eventually they turn the car around and drive away together.

Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo is a signature occurrence in most of his films. In &quot;Suspicion&quot;, he can be seen very briefly approximately 47 minutes into the film posting a letter at the village postbox.

==The West-Ingster screenplay==
In November 1939, Nathanael West was hired as a screenwriter by RKO Radio Pictures, where he collaborated with Boris Ingster on a film adaptation of the novel. The two men wrote the screenplay in seven weeks, with West focusing on characterization and dialogue as Ingster worked on the narrative structure.

When RKO assigned &quot;Before the Fact&quot; to Hitchcock, he already had his own, substantially different, screenplay, credited to Samson Raphaelson, Joan Harrison, and Alma Reville. (Harrison was Hitchcock&#x27;s personal assistant, and Reville was Hitchcock&#x27;s wife.) West and Ingster&#x27;s screenplay was abandoned and never produced. The text of this screenplay can be found in the Library of America&#x27;s edition of West&#x27;s collected works.

== Production ==
===Development===

&quot;Suspicion&quot; illustrates how a novel&#x27;s plot can be so much altered in the transition to film as to reverse the author&#x27;s original intention. As William L. De Andrea states in his &quot;Encyclopedia Mysteriosa&quot; (1994), &quot;Suspicion&quot;was supposed to be the study of a murder as seen through the eyes of the eventual victim. However, because Cary Grant was to be the killer and Joan Fontaine the person killed, the studio — RKO — decreed a different ending, which Hitchcock supplied and then spent the rest of his life complaining about. Hitchcock was quoted as saying that he was forced to alter the ending of the movie. He wanted an ending similar to the climax of the novel, but the studio, more concerned with Cary Grant&#x27;s &quot;heroic&quot; image, insisted that it be changed. In his biography of Hitchcock, &quot;The Dark Side of Genius&quot;, Donald Spoto disputes Hitchcock&#x27;s claim to have been overruled on the film&#x27;s ending. Spoto claims that the first RKO treatment and memos between Hitchcock and the studio show that Hitchcock emphatically desired to make a film about a woman&#x27;s fantasy life.

As in the novel, General McLaidlaw opposes his daughter&#x27;s marriage to Johnnie Aysgarth. In both versions, Johnnie freely admits that he would not mind the general&#x27;s death because he expects Lina to inherit a substantial fortune, which would solve their financial problems. The book, however, is much darker, with Johnnie egging on the general to exert himself to the point where he collapses and dies. In the film, General McLaidlaw&#x27;s death is only reported, and Johnnie is not involved at all. Again, Johnnie&#x27;s criminal record remains incomplete.

Several scenes in the film create suspense and sow doubt as to Johnnie&#x27;s intentions: Beaky&#x27;s death in Paris is due to an allergy to brandy, which Johnnie knew about. A waiter who barely speaks English tells the police that Beaky addressed his companion that night as &quot;Old Bean&quot;, the way Beaky addressed Johnnie. At the end of the film, Johnnie is driving his wife at breakneck speed to her mother&#x27;s house. This scene, which takes place after her final illness, is not in the book.

The biggest difference is the ending. In Iles&#x27; novel, Johnnie serves his sick wife a drink which she knows to be poisoned, and she voluntarily gulps it down. In the film, the drink may or may not be poisoned and can be seen untouched the following morning. Another ending was considered but not used, in which Lina is writing a letter to her mother stating that she fears Johnnie is going to poison her, at which point he walks in with the milk. She finishes the letter, seals and stamps an envelope, asks Johnnie to mail the letter, then drinks the milk. The final shot would have shown him leaving the house and dropping into a mailbox the letter which incriminates him. Hitchcock&#x27;s recollection of this original ending—in his book-length interview with François Truffaut, published in English as &quot;Hitchcock/Truffaut&quot; in 1967—is that Lina&#x27;s letter tells her mother she knows that Johnnie is killing her, but that she loves him too much to care.

A musical leitmotif is introduced in &quot;Suspicion&quot;. Whenever Lina is happy with Johnnie — starting with a ball organised by General McLaidlaw — Johann Strauss&#x27;s waltz &quot;Wiener Blut&quot; is played in its original, light-hearted version. At one point, when she is suspicious of her husband, a threatening, minor-key version of the waltz is employed, metamorphosing into the full and happy version after the suspense has been lifted. At another, Johnnie is whistling the waltz. At yet another, while Johnnie is serving the drink of milk, a sad version of &quot;Wiener Blut&quot; is played again. By placing a lightbulb in the milk, the filmmakers made the contents appear to glow as the glass is carried upstairs by Johnnie, further enhancing the audience&#x27;s fear that it is poisoned.

A visual threat is inserted when Lina suspects her husband of preparing to kill Beaky: On the night before, at the Aysgarths&#x27; home, they play Anagrams, and suddenly, by exchanging a letter, Lina changes &quot;mudder&quot; into &quot;murder&quot; and then &quot;murderer.&quot; Seeing the word, Lina looks at the flyer showing the cliffs Johnnie and Beaky plan to inspect for a real estate venture the next morning. The silhouettes of two men appear in the photograph. One pushes the other over the cliff, and we see Beaky falling and screaming. Lina faints.

If the viewer accepts Johnnie&#x27;s statements in the final scene and decides that he is, for all his faults, no murderer, the film becomes a cautionary tale about the dangers of suspicion based only on assumed, incomplete, and circumstantial evidence. However, given his behaviour up to this point, it is not clear why Johnnie&#x27;s assertions should be readily believed; in effect, the film leaves the viewer in a perpetual state of suspense as to what the truth is and what might happen next.

===Casting===
Originally, the story was intended as a B picture to star George Sanders and Anne Shirley. Then when Alfred Hitchcock became involved, the budget increased and Laurence Olivier and Frances Dee were to star. Eventually, it was decided to cast Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine. Fontaine had to be borrowed from David O. Selznick for an expensive fee; she had been dropped from RKO&#x27;s contract list some years before. Grant and Fontaine had previously worked together in &quot;Gunga Din&quot;.

===Filming===
The film was shot entirely on sound stages between February 10 and July 24, 1941.

==Reception==

===Box-office===
According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the film made $1.8 million at the box office in 1942. &quot;Suspicion&quot; earned a profit of $440,000.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 97% approval rating based on 33 reviews, the critical consensus stating, &quot;Not even notorious studio meddling can diminish the craft and tantalizing suspense of &quot;Suspicion&quot;, a sly showcase for Joan Fontaine&#x27;s nervy prowess and Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s flair for disquiet.&quot;

In 2016 the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that &quot;Many critics pegged “Suspicion” as a middling effort for the burgeoning auteur&quot; with the ending being a point of contention, although &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reviewer Philip K. Scheuer stated in 1941 that the ending being &quot;abrupt&quot; resulted in it being &quot;effective.&quot;

The 2016 article stated that &quot;Even today, most aficionados place the film well into the teens when ranking Hitchcock’s 50-plus films.&quot;

==Accolades==
==Adaptations==
During this time it was common for films to be adapted into radio plays.

<text>Something for Kate are an Australian alternative rock band, which formed in 1994 with Paul Dempsey on lead vocals and guitar, and Clint Hyndman on drums. They were joined in 1998 by Stephanie Ashworth on bass guitar and backing vocals. The group have released seven studio albums: both &quot;The Official Fiction&quot; (2003) and &quot;Desert Lights&quot; (2006) topped the ARIA Albums Chart; while &quot;Beautiful Sharks&quot; (1999), &quot;Echolalia&quot; (2001) and &quot;Leave Your Soul to Science&quot; (2012) reached the top 10. Two of their singles have reached the ARIA top 20: &quot;Monsters&quot; (2001) and &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; (2003). The band have received a total of 11 nominations for ARIA Music Awards in 1999, 2001 and 2003.

==History==
===1994–1997: Formation and early years===
Something for Kate were formed in 1994 in Melbourne by Julian Carroll on bass guitar, Paul Dempsey on lead guitar and lead vocals, and Clint Hyndman on drums. Dempsey and Hyndman were school friends from Padua College, Mornington Peninsula; Carroll successfully answered their advertisement in music stores. The trio played their first gig on 12 September 1994 at the Punter&#x27;s Club in Melbourne, changing their band name from Fish of the Day at the suggestion of the venue&#x27;s booking agent, Richard Moffat. Dempsey recalled that they performed because they &quot;just wanted to make an abrasive, staccato racket, like electrical machinery.&quot; He explained that the group&#x27;s new name was inspired by his dog, Kate – he had been left a shopping note, to buy &quot;Something for Kate&quot;. As for the dog, Dempsey&#x27;s mother sold Kate, the family&#x27;s Jack Russell, &quot;They told me she ran away... I think they were a bit tired of her escaping out of the back fence. My mum let it slip about a year later. She let the dog out of the bag.&quot;

The band built a varied fan base in Melbourne and recorded a demo tape that sold out of multiple pressings. In 1995, Sony Music&#x27;s A&amp;R, Chris Dunn, signed them to the Murmur label, which had picked up teenage rock band Silverchair a year earlier. He said one song, &quot;Slow&quot;, was particularly appealing: &quot;That really triggered the whole thing in me. I kept on playing this song over and over again. I just thought it was a really good song for such a young person.&quot;

Something for Kate released a seven-track extended play, &quot;...The Answer to Both Your Questions&quot;, in May 1996. It was produced by Greg Atkinson and appeared both on CD and as a hand-decorated mini-LP. An &quot;Oz Music Project&quot; reviewer described it as &quot;a critically acclaimed debut release and started catching the ears of punters around the country.&quot; During August and September of that year, they undertook the Unipaloser Tour of national universities with label mates Jebediah and Bluebottle Kiss.

In October they followed with a single, &quot;Dean Martin&quot;, also produced by Atkinson, which received frequent airplay on youth radio network, Triple J. A limited edition five-track EP, &quot;Intermission&quot;, was hastily assembled from leftover recordings and released in March 1997, quickly becoming a collectors&#x27; item. Jasper Lee of &quot;Oz Music Project&quot; declared that it &quot;shows the vast potential for [the] Melbourne band... Dempsey&#x27;s voice proves that under the thick layer of the morbid rock guy, that a emotionally-brittle heart lies within.&quot;

In February 1997, the band recorded their debut album, &quot;Elsewhere for 8 Minutes&quot; (July 1997), at York St Studios, Auckland, with producer Brian Paulson, whose credits included Wilco and Slint. Carroll, who had recently married, quit the band to live on a rural property, but agreed to remain for the sessions, he was replaced on bass guitar by Toby Ralph (ex-Lobtailing). Greg Lawrence of WHAMMO website described the album as &quot;the glorious debut&quot; which &quot;showed, early on in this band&#x27;s career, the depth of emotional range at the disposal of songwriter and singer Paul Dempsey... [it] is a crucial initial chapter in the story of this important Australian band.&quot;

A single, &quot;Captain (Million Miles an Hour)&quot;, appeared in May 1997. It received heavy airplay on Triple J and was listed at No. 39 on their Hottest 100 for that year. The band&#x27;s following quickly grew and they toured heavily, scoring gigs on numerous major festivals. Dempsey acknowledged that &quot;It&#x27;s pretty hard when you start out. It&#x27;s only now that we&#x27;re starting to get some serious recognition that we can finally begin to pick &amp; choose where we want to play. But to do that, you have to be able to prove that, as a band, you can really cut it live &amp; draw the crowds.&quot;

===1998–2002: &quot;Beautiful Sharks&quot;===
After about a year in Something for Kate, Ralph had failed to fit in with the other two, he was replaced by Stephanie Ashworth from three-piece indie rockers, Sandpit. Sandpit had released their own debut album, &quot;On Second Thought&quot;, in May 1998 but they disbanded – founding drummer Paul Sciacca had left ahead of recording sessions. Ashworth on bass guitar, keyboards and backing vocals and Brendan Webb, on lead guitar and vocals, had finished that album with their producer, Greg Wales, also on drums.

Dempsey felt that his group were going through a &quot;really turbulent period&quot; and &quot;completely de-constructed everything&quot; to rebuild after Ashworth joined. He continued, &quot;We&#x27;ve just been lucky because we&#x27;ve got this really natural chemistry between the three of us... We&#x27;ve finally got the right combination of people and we&#x27;re collaborating the way a band should.&quot; By the time Ashworth had joined &quot;she and Dempsey had gone from musical acquaintances to becoming a couple.&quot; In June 1998 Something for Kate issued another single, &quot;Roll Credit&quot;, which included label mates Jebediah&#x27;s cover of their song, &quot;Clint&quot; and SFK&#x27;s cover of Jebediah&#x27;s &quot;Harpoon&quot;. Murmur also issued a split double-7&quot; single/EP with the two versions of &quot;Harpoon&quot; on one disc and both versions of &quot;Clint&quot; on the other.

During 1998 Dempsey set up a side project, Scared of Horses, to release a solo album &quot;An Empty Flight&quot;, in November that year. He co-wrote and performed the tracks with a variety of fellow artists on lead vocals including Ashworth, Jamie Hutchings of Bluebottle Kiss, Laura MacFarlane of Ninetynine, Andria Prudente of Arrosa, Glenn Richards of Augie March and Heinz Riegler of Not from There.

In late 1998 the band travelled to Toronto to rehearse and record their second album, &quot;Beautiful Sharks&quot;, again with Paulson as producer. Ashworth and Dempsey co-wrote half of the music for the album. It was released the following June, which reached No. 10 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and was certified gold status by ARIA for shipment of 35,000 copies, in 2001. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, &quot;the acclaimed [album] moved beyond the stark instrumentation of the first album into more diverse pastures (for example, the rumbling &#x27;Electricity&#x27;, the atmospheric &#x27;Beautiful Sharks&#x27;)&quot;. Dino Scatena, an Australian journalist, opined that &quot;a lot of the beauty in [the album] lies in its understated quality ... so subtle, so perfect, any other songwriter would give his little pinky for a moment of such inspiration, such craftsmanship.&quot;

&quot;Electricity&quot;, their next single, appeared ahead of the album in March 1999 and peaked in the ARIA Singles Chart top 40. It was followed by &quot;Hallways&quot; in August, which did not reach the top 50. &quot;Beautiful Sharks&quot; was nominated for Best Alternative Release at the ARIA Music Awards of 1999. The band embarked on a major tour with Powderfinger and had three tracks listed in the Triple J Hottest 100, 1999: &quot;Electricity&quot; (No. 44), &quot;Whatever You Want&quot; (No. 70) and &quot;Hallways&quot; (No. 72). They toured Japan and the United States in early 2000, where Ashworth received — and rejected — an offer to join Courtney Love&#x27;s rock band, Hole.

===2001–2002: &quot;Echolalia&quot;===
Something for Kate&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Echolalia&quot; (June 2001), was produced by Trina Shoemaker (Sheryl Crow, Queens of the Stone Age). They began work at Mangrove Studios – owned by INXS member Garry Gary Beers – on Sydney&#x27;s north coast. The sessions in a windowless rehearsal studio stretched out over a year as Dempsey struggled with writer&#x27;s block. He recalled:

Exasperated, the band travelled to an island in the Gulf of Thailand, where Dempsey wrote &quot;Monsters&quot; in 20 minutes. He said the song, about overcoming self-doubt, broke the drought: &quot;As soon as I stopped thinking about it, as soon as I stopped being a songwriter, it came. So after that, we came home and wrote about 20 songs.&quot; Ashworth described Dempsey&#x27;s guitar work: &quot;Paul was a really percussive guitarist: he&#x27;s a drummer, first and foremost and he actually taught Clint to play the drums. So he comes from playing the guitar from a really percussive perspective; from a very Fugazi-type of world, creating every aspect of a song on the guitar instead of just melodies.&quot;

The album, released in June 2001, peaked at No. 2 and was certified as platinum – for shipment of 70,000 copies – by the end of the year. Lawrence felt that &quot;In many ways, it marks quite a departure from their past two efforts, moving towards a sparser and richer sound, both in terms of instrumentation and the moods it creates. A dazzling evolution for this vital Melbourne trio.&quot; It was listed in the top 40 in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot; (October 2010). The authors, John O&#x27;Donnell, Toby Creswell and Craig Mathieson, explained, &quot;[it is] full of ghosts; figures appear and then disappear; people turn into nothingness as they blindly repeat their daily routines, and protagonists try to find a way to move from the world they know to the world they want.&quot;

&quot;Monsters&quot; was issued in April 2001 as the album&#x27;s lead single, which debuted at No. 15, and is the group&#x27;s highest charting single. O&#x27;Donnell, Creswell and Mathieson described the track&#x27;s sound, &quot;It begins with purpose, shadowed by a hint of trepidation, but two lines in, as the bass starts to make its point and Dempsey&#x27;s voice becomes more pointed, the song starts to summon self-belief.&quot; Fellow Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, felt the group had &quot;spent more time on their songs than they&#x27;d ever spent in the past. On record the result was the rich and full sound which they haven&#x27;t been able to capture up until now. Their efforts were rewarded and the band&#x27;s status confirmed with the first single &#x27;Monsters&#x27; becoming the band&#x27;s first bona fide &#x27;hit&#x27;.&quot; It was followed by two more singles, &quot;Three Dimensions&quot; (August) and &quot;Twenty Years&quot; (November), which reached the top 50.

The band sold out two national tours and finished the year again supporting Powderfinger. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 Something for Kate were nominated in six categories – Album of the Year, Best Group, Best Alternative Release and Best Cover Art (by Ashworth) for &quot;Echolalia&quot;; and Single of the Year and Best Video (directed by Bart Borghesi) for &quot;Monsters&quot; – but they did not win a trophy. On the Triple J Hottest 100, 2001 &quot;Monsters&quot; as listed at No. 2, &quot;Three Dimensions&quot; at No. 13 and &quot;Twenty Years&quot; at No. 37; while &quot;Echolalia&quot; was listed as the top album for the year.

===2003–2008: &quot;The Official Fiction&quot;, &quot;Desert Lights&quot;, and hiatus===
On 15 August 2003 Something for Kate issued their fourth studio album, &quot;The Official Fiction&quot;, which is their first number-one album. It was produced by Shoemaker at Mangrove Studios, again. Lawrence opined that it &quot;is the perfect soundtrack to the inevitable self-indulgent melancholy I&#x27;ll be suffering/enjoying for the next few days/weeks/months. The precisely structured chord progressions, creative arrangements and insightful lyrics are already weaving their magic and cultivating the warm gloom of loss.&quot; He noticed that &quot;[Dempsey&#x27;s] voice is instantly recognisable and familiar as he tells the stories that have become a feature of SFK&#x27;s unique lyrical content&quot; while &quot;Hyndman&#x27;s drumming is far from conservative, offering oddly but deftly placed accents and a beat that fights the sugar-sweet melodies to provide a much-needed edge.&quot;

The first two singles from the album were &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; (July 2003), which peaked at No. 19, and &quot;Song for a Sleepwalker&quot; (October), which reached the top 40. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2003 SFK received four nominations: Album of the Year, Best Group, Best Rock Album and Best Cover Art (by Ashworth and Dave Horner) for &quot;The Official Fiction&quot;. It was certified gold by the end of that year. On the Triple J Hottest 100, 2003, &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; was listed at No. 11 and &quot;Song for a Sleepwalker&quot; at No. 63; &quot;Official Fiction&quot; was listed at No. 6 on the Top 10 Albums of 2003. Ashworth described the group, &quot;We&#x27;re an album band not a singles band. We write albums and then the record company picks whatever they want to be the single. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s really difficult. So for you, you might get a very one-sided idea of what a band&#x27;s like and then you put the album on and you go: &#x27;Oh, I didn&#x27;t realize they had this side.&#x27; That&#x27;s where I think singles are a real fucker. I don&#x27;t like it.&quot;

&quot;Desert Lights&quot;, their fifth studio album (1 June 2006) also topped the charts – their second number-one album. It was certified gold status within a month of its release. They had recorded it over four months in Los Angeles with Brad Wood (Ben Lee, the Smashing Pumpkins, Liz Phair). Dempsey had started working on lyrics for it in the previous year, &quot;Writing this record was difficult. But at the end of it, I&#x27;ve never been happier.&quot; Stephanie McDonald of FasterLouder felt its &quot;sound has moved from one of raw, hard rock to something a lot more melodic with pop appeal... [the group] combines both those elements into something truly inspirational.&quot;

&quot;Cigarettes and Suitcases&quot;, the lead single, was released in May 2006, which reached No. 23, while the follow-up single, &quot;Oh Kamikaze&quot;, appeared in September and reached the top 40. Rob Smith of &quot;The Dwarf&quot; felt that the first single &quot;is SFK at their typical alternative rock best, blending a catchy and melodious chorus with constant beats and a use of light and heavy guitar work. The second single &#x27;Oh, Kamikaze&#x27; is a more upbeat number one might almost be able to dance to, if one could dance that is.&quot;

A compilation 2×CD album, &quot;The Murmur Years&quot;, was released on 18 August 2007 with one new song, &quot;The Futurist&quot;. According to Nimmervoll &quot;Notwithstanding a couple of one-off reunion shows for their ever-loyal following Something for Kate went into hiatus while their leader concentrated on writing for a solo album.&quot; They issued a limited edition 16-track live album, &quot;Live at the Corner&quot;, as an &quot;artist-controlled bootleg&quot;, capturing the sound of the band on stage on 23 February 2008 at the Corner Hotel in Richmond.

===2012–2013: Reformation, &quot;Leave Your Soul to Science&quot;, and second hiatus===
In mid-2012 Something for Kate resumed their recording career, six years after their previous studio effort. They worked on &quot;Leave Your Soul to Science&quot; (September 2012) in Dallas with John Congleton (Okkervil River, Shearwater, the New Pornographers) co-producing. Dempsey said they looked for someone to contain them during the recording process: &quot;We recognised an inclination or proclivity among ourselves to procrastinate and keep layering stuff up. We knew that we needed to fight that instinct and he was very much the guy to help us.&quot;

The band uploaded two songs from the album to the internet before its release (&quot;Survival Expert&quot; and &quot;The Fireball at the End of Everything&quot;) and also played two live shows in Melbourne and Sydney to preview it. The album reached No. 5, and provided three singles, &quot;Survival Expert&quot; (August 2012), &quot;Miracle Cure&quot; (December) and &quot;Star-crossed Citizens&quot; (May 2013).

As part of the band&#x27;s mid-2013 Star-Crossed Cities Tour, Dempsey recorded Shotgun Karaoke video segments prior to each show, in which he performed cover versions of songs by artists, the Lemonheads, David Bowie, INXS, and Queen. The tour for ended in Hobart on 29 June 2013. By October that year Dempsey had resumed his solo career.

===2020: &quot;The Modern Medieval&quot;===
In April 2020, Something for Kate released &quot;Situation Room&quot;, their first new track in eight years. It served as the lead single for the band&#x27;s seventh studio album, which at the time was also titled &quot;Situation Room&quot; and a to-be-decided release date. In July 2020, the band released the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Waste Our Breath&quot;. In September 2020, the band announced both the album&#x27;s title as &quot;The Modern Medieval&quot; and its third single, &quot;Supercomputer&quot;. On 1 October 2020, the album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Come Back Before I Come Back to My Senses&quot; was released. The album was released on 20 November and debuted at Number 5 on the ARIA chart 2020.

<doc id="74993" wikidata="Q3927290" url="?curid=74993" title="Fourth World (comics)">
<text>&quot;Fourth World&quot; is a metaseries of connected comic book titles written and drawn by Jack Kirby and published by DC Comics from 1970 to 1973. Although they were not marketed under this title until the August–September 1971 issues of &quot;New Gods&quot; and &quot;Forever People&quot;, the terms &quot;Fourth World&quot; and &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World&quot; have gained usage in the years since.
Kirby created the Fourth World concept in the 1970s. The series is a science-fiction based mythology that revolves around ancient space deities known as the New Gods. The New Gods are similar to the gods of Earth lore.

==Publication history==
===Initial 1970s comics===
As the newsstand distribution system for comics began to break down, Jack Kirby foresaw a day when comics would need to find alternate venues for sale. Toward this end, Kirby envisioned a finite series that would be serialized and collected in one tome after the series had concluded. He began the &quot;Fourth World&quot; in &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot; #133 (Oct. 1970). DC Comics had planned to introduce the &quot;Fourth World&quot; titles in the November 1970 issue of their preview omnibus title, &quot;Showcase&quot;. Kirby reportedly objected to this, and &quot;Showcase&quot; was cancelled. This delayed the introduction of the &quot;Fourth World&quot; titles until the following year. The three original titles constituting the &quot;Fourth World&quot; were &quot;The Forever People&quot;, &quot;Mister Miracle&quot;, and &quot;The New Gods&quot;.

Unhappy with Marvel Comics at the time, as he had created a plethora of characters without having copyright or creative custody of them, Kirby turned to rival publisher DC Comics, with his sketches and designs for a new group of heroes and villains. He had first showed them to Stan Lee, who liked them, but wanted to fold them into already existing titles. So Kirby decided to keep them for himself. When Carmine Infantino visited Kirby and his family for Passover, he showed him his designs and ideas. Infantino told him that he wanted to bring them to DC. Worsening conditions at Marvel and promises from DC made Kirby decide to switch company. As author Marc Flores, who writes under the pen name Ronin Ro, described:

&quot;The Fourth World&quot; dealt with the battle between good and evil as represented by the worlds of New Genesis and Apokolips. Darkseid, the evil lord of Apokolips, seeks the Anti-Life Equation which will allow him to control the thoughts of all living beings. Opposing him is Orion, his son, who was raised on New Genesis. Other characters caught in the battle included the Forever People, an extension of the kid gang concept from the 1940s with a group of adolescents adventuring without an adult supervisor; Mister Miracle, a native of New Genesis raised on Apokolips who triumphed over a torturous childhood to become the world&#x27;s greatest escape artist; and Lightray, the heroic warrior of New Genesis. Their adventures would take them to Earth where the war continued.

Comics historian Les Daniels observed in 1995 that &quot;Kirby&#x27;s mix of slang and myth, science fiction and the Bible, made for a heady brew, but the scope of his vision has endured&quot;. In 2007, comics writer Grant Morrison commented that &quot;Kirby&#x27;s dramas were staged across Jungian vistas of raw symbol and storm... The Fourth World saga crackles with the voltage of Jack Kirby&#x27;s boundless imagination let loose onto paper&quot;.

The Fourth World characters reappeared in various titles. In 1976, the New Gods were featured in the last issue of &quot;1st Issue Special&quot;. &quot;The New Gods&quot; series relaunched in July 1977, and with &quot;1st Issue Special&quot; still a relatively recent publication, it picked up where the storyline of that issue left off. Although the title remained &quot;The New Gods&quot; in the indicia and retained its original numbering, launching with #12, the covers used the title &quot;The Return of the New Gods&quot;. Gerry Conway wrote the series and Don Newton drew it. Mister Miracle teamed-up with Batman three times in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;, and the &quot;Mister Miracle&quot; series was revived in September 1977 by Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers. Steve Gerber and Michael Golden produced three issues ending with #25 (Sept. 1978), with several storylines unresolved. Mister Miracle teamed with Superman in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #12 (Aug. 1979) and the New Gods met the Justice League of America and the Justice Society of America in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #183–185 (Oct–Dec 1980). &quot;The Great Darkness Saga&quot; storyline in &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; vol. 2 featured the team battling Darkseid a thousand years in the future.

===Origin of the name===
Mark Evanier, who worked as Kirby&#x27;s assistant in the 1970s and later wrote an award-winning Kirby biography, has said that there are multiple, mutually-exclusive explanations for why Kirby chose the name &quot;Fourth World&quot;, adding that &quot;if you&#x27;d asked Jack eight times, you&#x27;d have gotten eight more&quot;; ultimately, Evanier concluded that none of the suggested explanations are plausible, and that it is most likely &quot;just a term that popped into [Kirby&#x27;s] head and he liked the sound of it. Later on, he came up with several different retroactive explanations&quot;.

===1984 reprint series===
In 1984, DC Comics reprinted Jack Kirby&#x27;s original 11 issues of &quot;The New Gods&quot; in a six-issue limited series. The first five issues each reprinted two consecutive issues of the original series. The mini-series&#x27; final issue was originally intended to include a reprint of &quot;New Gods&quot; vol. 1 #11 and a new 24-page story which would conclude the series and end with both Darkseid and Orion dead. DC editors prevented Kirby from using his original intended ending. Kirby instead turned in a one-off story called &quot;On the Road to Armagetto&quot; which was rejected as well, due to the fact that it did not contain a definitive ending to the series. A 48-page new story called &quot;Even Gods Must Die&quot; was published instead, serving as a prologue for &quot;The Hunger Dogs&quot; graphic novel, which was greenlit to conclude the series.

&quot;The Hunger Dogs&quot; was designed to give an ending to the story of the New Gods, while fulfilling editorial mandates that the New Gods be kept alive to ensure future use of the characters by later writers. It incorporated several pages from the unpublished &quot;On the Road to Armagetto&quot; story and brought Kirby&#x27;s &quot;New Gods&quot; series to a close as the &quot;hunger dogs&quot;, the citizens of Apokolips, overthrow Darkseid.

===Later revivals===
Concurrent with DC&#x27;s &quot;New Gods&quot; reprint series in 1984, Kirby worked on two &quot;Super Powers&quot; comic book limited series for DC Comics in which he continued the Fourth World characters and mythology.

A &quot;Forever People&quot; miniseries was published in 1988. Mister Miracle was featured in &quot;Justice League International&quot; by J. M. DeMatteis and Keith Giffen and a series of his own written by DeMatteis. The Fourth World characters were prominently featured in &quot;Cosmic Odyssey&quot;, which led to a third &quot;New Gods&quot; series (February 1989 – August 1991), written by Mark Evanier, which fleshed out details about the history of many New Gods, most notably introducing Darkseid&#x27;s father Yuga Khan. A fourth &quot;New Gods&quot; series was launched in October 1995, and a third &quot;Mister Miracle&quot; series in April 1996. 
Both of these were replaced in March 1997 by the &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World&quot; series, written and drawn by John Byrne. Walt Simonson wrote and drew an &quot;Orion&quot; solo series from June 2000 to June 2002.

Writer Grant Morrison used some of the Fourth World mythology in various titles they worked on, including their run on &quot;JLA&quot;, with Orion and Big Barda becoming members, and in the &quot;Seven Soldiers&quot; metaseries, in which the New Gods, especially Mister Miracle, played a major role. They are seen creating Aurakles, the first superhero.

The &quot;Death of the New Gods&quot; limited series (October 2007 – April 2008) was written and drawn by Jim Starlin. &quot;Final Crisis&quot; brought about the end of the Fourth World and the dawn of the Fifth as Darkseid was destroyed and several New Gods are resurrected.

With the reboot of the DC Universe following &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, the deaths of the New Gods and Darkseid have been removed from canon and the characters are still active. In particular, Darkseid and his uncle Steppenwolf and their attacks on the main DC Universe and Earth 2 play a major role in the rise of the superheroes: the Earth-2 versions of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman die fighting Steppenwolf while the Earth-1 Justice League forms to fight Darkseid and thwart his invasion of Earth.

A New 52 version of the Forever People debuted in the &quot;Infinity Man and the Forever People&quot; series. Serifan is now Serafina, Vykin&#x27;s sister, and Beautiful Dreamer has been renamed Dreamer Beautiful.

==Fifth World==
In December 2007, DC Executive Editor Dan DiDio was discussing the aftermath of &quot;Death of the New Gods&quot; and pointed to the creation of Fifth World; he said: &quot;It&#x27;s the advent of the Fifth World... I think we&#x27;ve telegraphed so much that the New Gods are coming upon a rebirth, and the story that we&#x27;re telling with them now is a continuation of the story that was established when Kirby first conceived the concept. Talk about death—Kirby blew up worlds at the start of the series. The story started with, &#x27;The Old Gods Died!&#x27; which made room for the New Gods—we&#x27;re picking up that thread and launching the DCU into the future&quot;.

That series led into &quot;Final Crisis&quot;. DiDio clarified things further, saying that &quot;the Fourth World is over. The battle between the forces of Darkseid and those of Highfather is over, and a new direction is in place for the characters in what will be deemed the Fifth World&quot;. The series&#x27; writer, Grant Morrison, added: &quot;In Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World books... it&#x27;s pretty clear that the New Gods have known about Earth for a long time and in &quot;JLA&quot; ten years ago, I suggested that part of their interest in us was rooted in the fact that Earth was destined to become the cradle of a new race of &#x27;Fifth World&#x27; super-divinities—an eventuality Darkseid is eager to prevent from occurring&quot;. It was during that run on &quot;JLA&quot; that Morrison had Metron deliver a speech outlining the general principles:

Later, in the &quot;JLA&quot; storyline &quot;World War III&quot;, Metron&#x27;s dialog is more specific: &quot;As New Genesis is to the Fourth World, Earth shall be to the Fifth that is to come&quot;.

==Collected editions==
===Trade paperbacks===
The Kirby-produced &quot;Fourth World&quot; titles were reprinted by DC in trade paperback format in the early 2000s in black-and-white rather than in color, although the &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot; preludes were reprinted in color:

===Omnibus===
DC reprinted the entire Fourth World saga in publishing order in the four volume hardback series &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World Omnibus&quot; from 2007 to 2008. In addition to the remaining issues of &quot;Mister Miracle&quot;, &quot;Forever People&quot;, and &quot;New Gods&quot;, the fourth Omnibus included the Fourth World character entries written for &quot;Who&#x27;s Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe&quot;, the 48-page &quot;Even Gods Must Die!&quot; from the last issue of the 1984 Baxter reprint series, and &quot;The Hunger Dogs&quot; graphic novel. The series was reprinted in paperback starting in late 2011. In 2017, in honor of Kirby&#x27;s 100th birthday, DC Comics released a new hardcover omnibus collecting the story in its entirety. New contents included essays from Mark Evanier and Walter Simonson, and Kirby pencils, profiles, and pinups. The collection was released on December 12 the same year. The $150 omnibus however had a mistake, omitting the splash page from &quot;Jimmy Olsen&quot; #148, reprinting a page from an earlier episode instead.

In September 2021, a new edition, correcting the original error, with better quality paper stock at a reduced price was published with 50 additional pages of unpublished material.

<doc id="74996" wikidata="Q465449" url="?curid=74996" title="Miramax">
<text>Miramax, LLC (formerly known as Miramax Films) is an American independent film and television production and distribution company founded on December 19, 1979, by Harvey and Bob Weinstein, and based in Los Angeles, California. Today, it is owned by beIN Media Group and Paramount Global.

It was a leading producer and distributor of independent films until it was acquried by The Walt Disney Company on June 30, 1993. In 2010, Disney sold it to Filmyard Holdings, a joint venture of Colony NorthStar, Tutor-Saliba Corporation and Qatar Investment Authority. In March 2016, the company was sold to the beIN Media Group, which later sold a 49% stake to ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global) on April 3, 2020.

==History==
===Independent era (1979–1993)===
Miramax Films was founded by the Weinstein brothers, Harvey and Bob, along with executive Corky Burger in Buffalo, New York, in 1979, and was named by combining the first names of their parents, Miriam and Max. It was created to distribute independent films deemed commercially unfeasible by the major studios.

The company&#x27;s first major success came when the Weinsteins teamed up with British producer Martin Lewis and acquired the U.S. rights to two concert films Lewis had produced of benefit shows for human rights organization Amnesty International. The Weinsteins worked with Lewis to distill the two films into one film for the American marketplace. The resulting film, the American version of &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot;, was a successful release for Miramax in the summer of 1982. This release presaged a &quot;modus operandi&quot; that the company would undertake later in the 1980s of acquiring films from international filmmakers and reworking them to suit American sensibilities and audiences. In its early years, Miramax Films had to focus primarily as a catalyst for music and decided to do a licensing agreement with Thorn EMI Video to release several of Miramax&#x27;s early films.

Among the company&#x27;s other breakthrough films as distributors in the late 1980s and early 1990s were &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, &quot;Scandal&quot;, &quot;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&quot;, &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot;, &quot;The Crying Game,&quot; and &quot;Clerks&quot;. The company also made films such as &quot;Flirting with Disaster&quot;, &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;, and &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;.

Miramax Films acquired and/or produced many other films that did well financially. The company became one of the leaders of the independent film boom of the 1990s. Miramax Films produced or distributed seven films with box office grosses totaling more than $100 million; its highest grossing title, &quot;Chicago&quot;, earned more than $300 million worldwide.

The company was also successful in securing Academy Award nominations for its releases, many of which resulted in Oscar wins.

===Disney era (1993–2010)===
On June 30, 1993, The Walt Disney Company purchased Miramax Films for $60 million and assumed all of the company&#x27;s debt, which was more than $40 million. The acquisition gave Disney entry to the independent film market. Harvey and Bob Weinstein continued to operate Miramax Films until they left the company on September 30, 2005. During their tenure, the Weinstein brothers ran Miramax Films independently of other Disney subsidiaries and, as a result, had more autonomy than the other Disney-owned companies. Disney, however, had the final say on what Miramax Films could release (for example, Disney had banned Miramax Films from releasing &quot;Kids&quot;, &quot;Dogma&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;). Disney&#x27;s Buena Vista Home Entertainment division released Miramax output on VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray Disc under the name Miramax Home Entertainment in some countries, including the United States; elsewhere, the overall distribution of Miramax Films&#x27; output was passed to the regional licensees of Miramax International, a distribution arm of Miramax Films that was fully autonomous from Disney&#x27;s own distribution operations.

With a more stable budget, Miramax Films began moving beyond acquisitions and distribution and into film production. Until September 30, 2005, the company also operated the label Dimension Films, which was solely founded by Bob to specialize in teen, horror, and other genre films, and created the &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;Scary Movie&quot; film franchises. Harvey funded larger projects from up-and-coming directors, including Robert Rodriguez, Gus Van Sant, and Quentin Tarantino. Some of the films earned Oscars. At times the studio tried to release a film almost weekly.

In 1997, Miramax Films joined Peter Jackson as a primary financial backer in attempting to get the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films produced. Disney disliked the cost of a two-parter, requesting that it be produced as a single film. Jackson and Saul Zaentz rejected Disney&#x27;s request and looked for another studio or financier. Thus, Miramax Films sold the rights for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; to New Line Cinema in August 1998 for about $12 million, which led &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; to be produced as a trilogy. Miramax Films retained a 5% stake in the films&#x27; gross and then gave 2.5% to the Weinsteins.

Through Miramax Films, Harvey founded &quot;Talk&quot; magazine with Tina Brown in 1998 (it shut down in 2002), albeit without the approval of then-Disney chief Michael Eisner, which upset Eisner. Also that year, 30 former employees filed suit over unpaid overtime wages.

By 2003, Miramax Films was less operative in the independent film market and became more of a mini-major as the company only acquired 3 films while producing &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; for $80 million. The Weinsteins claimed the company was profitable, but Walt Disney Company president Robert Iger indicated in June 2004 that they were not properly accounting for &quot;account standard overhead, distribution fees, bonuses that we pay Harvey and Bob. Nor are they applying current accounting rules.&quot;

After extensive negotiations and much media and industry speculation, on March 30, 2005, Disney and the Weinsteins announced that they would not renew their contractual relationship when their existing agreements expired at the end of September 2005. The primary source of dispute was over distribution of &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; by Michael Moore. Disney&#x27;s film studio consortium, Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, assumed control of Miramax Films, which was projected to have a smaller annual production budget. The Weinsteins started a new film production company called The Weinstein Company (TWC) and took the Dimension Films label with them. The Miramax Films name remained with the film studio owned by Disney. Production at Miramax Films was taken over by Daniel Battsek, who had been head of Buena Vista International in the UK. Battsek refocused Miramax Films to produce films of high quality but low budget. Maple Pictures held the rights to distribute Miramax films in Canada from 2008 up until August 10, 2011, when Maple Pictures was acquired by Alliance Films. At the time, the company was criticized for delaying or withholding release of Asian films to which it acquired the U.S. distribution rights. Previously, in 2003, the company was criticized for trying to bar retailers from legally exporting authentic DVDs of the films.

On October 3, 2009, Disney announced that the staff of Miramax Films was to be reduced by 70%, and the number of releases would be reduced by half to just three films per year. The label&#x27;s marketing, distribution, and administrative functions, which had operated independently, would be folded into the parent studio in Burbank. The move became effective in January 2010. On October 30, 2009, Disney announced the resignation of Daniel Battsek as President of Miramax Films, effective when the transition from the studio in New York to Burbank was completed. The company merged its operations with The Walt Disney Studios on January 28, 2010, shutting down Miramax Films&#x27; separate New York and Los Angeles offices.

Though Disney Studio Chairman Dick Cook was a staunch supporter of Miramax Films, the brand was less of a priority for CEO Bob Iger, whose strategy was to focus on Disney&#x27;s branded mass entertainment that could be exploited across Disney&#x27;s theme parks, television, and consumer products. Following Disney&#x27;s $4 billion acquisition of Marvel Entertainment in 2009, Cook was succeeded by Rich Ross. As a result, Miramax Films was relegated to the status of distribution label within the Walt Disney Company. The company confirmed that it was looking into selling the Miramax label on February 9, 2010, with Bob Iger explaining &quot;We determined that continuing to invest in new Miramax movies wasn&#x27;t necessarily a core strategy of ours&quot;.

===Other companies and post-Disney ownership era (2010–2019)===

On December 3, 2010, Disney closed the sale of Miramax for US$663 million to Filmyard Holdings, an investment group and joint venture of Colony NorthStar, Tutor-Saliba Corporation, and Qatar Investment Authority. The sale included 700 film titles, books, development projects, and the &quot;Miramax&quot; name. Mike Lang, the former News Corporation business development executive who was selected as the CEO of Miramax, indicated that the company would focus on their existing library, though they would continue making original content.

After the sale was closed, some films already developed at Miramax, including &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;Gnomeo &amp; Juliet&quot;, were eventually released by Disney under its Touchstone Pictures banner, and theatrical distribution of &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid of the Dark&quot; and &quot;The Debt&quot; were shifted to FilmDistrict and Focus Features respectively.

On December 16, 2013, Miramax entered into a deal with Harvey and Bob Weinstein&#x27;s The Weinstein Company to develop and distribute select derivative works of films from the former studio. Sequels, television series, or stage productions of titles such as &quot;Rounders&quot; and &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; were among the projects said to be part of this agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miramax Press Release 12/16/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, 2015, Qatar and Colony NorthStar put Miramax up for sale for an offer of $1 billion. Harvey and Bob Weinstein had reportedly regained interest in reacquiring the studio via TWC in September. On March 2, 2016, Miramax was sold to beIN Media Group, a spinoff of Al Jazeera Media Network (which formerly owned its namesake beIN Sports).

On a July 21, 2016, interview, Harvey Weinstein stated that he was still interested in combining TWC&#x27;s film library with Miramax&#x27;s, after the acquisition of the latter by beIN.

After Miramax&#x27;s founder Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual assault in October 2017, Miramax became one of 60 parties bidding on The Weinstein Company on January 16, 2018. On April 27, Miramax and Lantern Capital emerged as the strongest contenders to acquire TWC&#x27;s assets. Ultimately, it was Lantern that acquired TWC&#x27;s library.

On June 7, 2019, beIN began the process of selling approximately 50% of Miramax in an effort to offer it for growth. Lionsgate (which distributed Miramax&#x27;s titles on home video), Spyglass Media Group (owners of the Weinstein Company library, inherited via their deal with Lantern) and Viacom (Paramount&#x27;s parent company who re-merged with CBS Corporation on December 4, 2019, to form ViacomCBS) were seen as the leading contenders to acquire a stake in the company. By August 19, 2019, Lionsgate and Viacom were the only contenders, as Spyglass Media Group dropped out of contention. On September 11, 2019, it was announced Lionsgate had dropped their bid, making Viacom the only bidder for the stake in Miramax. On November 8, 2019, Viacom exited the negotiations to acquire them. After merging with CBS Corporation to become ViacomCBS, the combined firm resumed talks with Miramax.

===ViacomCBS/Paramount Global era (2019–present)===
On December 20, 2019, ViacomCBS (now known as Paramount Global) announced it would acquire a 49% stake in Miramax for at least $375 million, with Paramount Pictures gaining exclusive worldwide distribution rights to its film and television library. Paramount Pictures and Miramax will also co-produce new content based on titles from the library. The deal officially closed on April 3, 2020.

On June 24, 2020, Miramax and ViacomCBS announced their first co-production, &quot;The Turkish Detective&quot;, a television series based on the &quot;Cetin Ikmen&quot; novels by Barbara Nadel.

On October 2, 2023, it was announced that CEO Bill Block would be leaving the company that week following the end of his contract with them, starting his own production company, BlockFilm, later that month. In January 2024, Jonathan Glickman was reported to be in talks to join Miramax as CEO, with his company Panoramic Media expected to be acquired by Miramax if talks were successful. On April 2, 2024, Glickman was officially named Miramax&#x27;s new CEO effective immediately. As part of the deal, Miramax also acquired certain film and TV projects from Glickman&#x27;s company Panoramic Media.

==Divisions==
===Miramax Family &amp; Animation===

Miramax Family Films was the family division of Miramax Films, founded on September 2, 1993. The label was quietly discontinued in 2006. On March 18, 2019, Miramax revived its family and animation divisions, with both being founded as separate divisions within the company.

Michael Lachance, who had previously developed projects at DreamWorks Animation and Sony Pictures Animation, was named the division&#x27;s executive vice president.

== Miramax Television ==

Miramax Television is the television production division founded in 1987, assigned to producing television shows based on the existing Miramax film library and original concepts. Although Miramax produced its series as early as 1987, Miramax expanded its foray into game shows with an attempted version of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; in 1996, followed by a proper television division in 1998. In 2001, Mort Marcus became chairman of the company, only to leave in 2002 to reestablish Debmar Studios.

<text>The coelom (or celom) is the main body cavity in many animals and is positioned inside the body to surround and contain the digestive tract and other organs. In some animals, it is lined with mesothelium. In other animals, such as molluscs, it remains undifferentiated. In the past, and for practical purposes, coelom characteristics have been used to classify bilaterian animal phyla into informal groups.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;coelom&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek word () &#x27;cavity&#x27;.

== Structure ==

=== Development ===
The coelom is the mesodermally lined cavity between the gut and the outer body wall.

During the development of the embryo, coelom formation begins in the gastrulation stage. The developing digestive tube of an embryo forms as a blind pouch called the archenteron.

In protostomes, the coelom forms by a process known as schizocoely. The archenteron initially forms, and the mesoderm splits into two layers: the first attaches to the body wall or ectoderm, forming the parietal layer and the second surrounds the endoderm or alimentary canal forming the visceral layer. The space between the parietal layer and the visceral layer is known as the coelom or body cavity.

In deuterostomes, the coelom forms by enterocoely. The archenteron wall produces buds of mesoderm, and these mesodermal diverticula hollow to become the coelomic cavities. Deuterostomes are therefore known as &quot;enterocoelomates&quot;. Examples of deuterostome coelomates belong to three major clades: chordates (vertebrates, tunicates, and lancelets), echinoderms (starfish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers), and hemichordates (acorn worms and graptolites).

=== Origins ===
The evolutionary origin of the coelom is uncertain. The oldest known animal to have had a body cavity was the &quot;Vernanimalcula&quot;. Current hypothesis include:
* The acoelomate theory, which states that coelom evolved from an acoelomate ancestor. 
* The enterocoel theory, which states that coelom evolved from gastric pouches of cnidarian ancestors. This is supported by research on flatworms and small worms recently discovered in marine fauna (&quot;coelom&quot;).

== Functions ==
A coelom can absorb shock or provide a hydrostatic skeleton. It can also support an immune system in the form of coelomocytes that may either be attached to the wall of the coelom or may float about in it freely. The coelom allows muscles to grow independently of the body wall — this feature can be seen in the digestive tract of tardigrades (water bears) which is suspended within the body in the mesentery derived from a mesoderm-lined coelom.

== Coelomic fluid ==
The fluid inside the coelom is known as coelomic fluid. This is circulated by mesothelial cilia or by contraction of muscles in the body wall. The coelomic fluid serves several functions: it acts as a hydroskeleton; it allows free movement and growth of internal organs; it serves for transport of gases, nutrients and waste products around the body; it allows storage of sperm and eggs during maturation; and it acts as a reservoir for waste.

== Classification in zoology ==

In the past, some zoologists grouped bilaterian animal phyla based on characteristics related to the coelom for practical purposes, knowing, and explicitly stating, that these groups were &quot;not&quot; phylogenetically related. Animals were classified in three informal groups according to the type of body cavity they possess, in a non-taxonomic, utilitarian way, as the Acoelomata, Pseudocoelomata, and Coelomata. These groups were never intended to represent related animals, or a sequence of evolutionary traits.

However, although this scheme was followed by a number of college textbooks and some general classifications, it is now almost totally abandoned as a formal classification. Indeed, as late as 2010, one author of a molecular phylogeny study mistakenly called this classification scheme the &quot;traditional, morphology-based phylogeny&quot;.
Coelomate animals or Coelomata (also known as eucoelomates – &quot;true coelom&quot;) have a body cavity called a coelom with a complete lining called peritoneum derived from mesoderm (one of the three primary tissue layers). The complete mesoderm lining allows organs to be attached to each other so that they can be suspended in a particular order while still being able to move freely within the cavity. Most bilateral animals, including all the vertebrates, are coelomates.

Pseudocoelomate animals have a pseudocoelom (literally &quot;false cavity&quot;), which is a fluid filled body cavity. Tissue derived from mesoderm partly lines the fluid filled body cavity of these animals. Thus, although organs are held in place loosely, they are not as well organized as in a coelomate. All pseudocoelomates are protostomes; however, not all protostomes are pseudocoelomates. An example of a pseudocoelomate is the roundworm. Pseudocoelomate animals are also referred to as blastocoelomate.

Acoelomate animals, like flatworms, have no body cavity at all. Semi-solid mesodermal tissues between the gut and body wall hold their organs in place.

== Coelomates ==
Coeloms developed in triploblasts but were subsequently lost in several lineages. The lack of a coelom is correlated with a reduction in body size. Coelom is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to any developed digestive tract. Some organisms may not possess a coelom or may have a false coelom (pseudocoelom). Animals having coeloms are called coelomates, and those without are called acoelomates. There are also subtypes of coelom:

* schizocoelom: develops from split in mesoderm found in annelids, arthropods and molluscs
* haemocoelom: true coelom reduced and cavity filled with blood found from Arthropoda to Mollusca
* enterocoelom: develops from wall of embryonic gut found from Echinodermata to Chordata

===Coelomate phyla===
According to Brusca and Brusca, the following bilaterian phyla possess a coelom:

*Nemertea, traditionally viewed as acoelomates. Its coelom, called a rhynchocoel, lies above the digestive tract instead of around it like in other coelomate animals. 
*Priapulida appears to belong to the pseudocoelomate animals, but the possibility of it having a true coelom has still not been completely dismissed.
*Onychophora
*Tardigrada
*Arthropoda
*Chaetognatha
*Bryozoa
*Mollusca
*Annelida
*Brachiopoda
*Phoronida
*Echinodermata
*Hemichordata
*Chordata

== Pseudocoelomates ==
In some protostomes, the embryonic blastocoele persists as a body cavity. These protostomes have a fluid filled main body cavity unlined or partially lined with tissue derived from mesoderm.

This fluid-filled space surrounding the internal organs serves several functions like distribution of nutrients and removal of waste or supporting the body as a hydrostatic skeleton.

A pseudocoelomate or blastocoelomate is any invertebrate animal with a three-layered body and a pseudocoel. The coelom was apparently lost or reduced as a result of mutations in certain types of genes that affected early development. Thus, pseudocoelomates evolved from coelomates. &quot;Pseudocoelomate&quot; is no longer considered a valid taxonomic group, since it is not monophyletic. However, it is still used as a descriptive term.

Important characteristics:
* lack a vascular blood system
** diffusion and osmosis circulate nutrients and waste products throughout the body.
* lack a skeleton
** hydrostatic pressure gives the body a supportive framework that acts as a skeleton.
* no segmentation
* body wall
** epidermis and muscle
** often syncytial
** usually covered by a secreted cuticle
* most are microscopic
* parasites of almost every form of life (although some are free living)
* eutely in some
* loss of larval stage in some
* possibly pedomorphism

===Pseudocoelomate phyla===
Bilaterian pseudocoelomate phyla according to Brusca and Brusca,:

*Nematoda (roundworms)
*Nematomorpha (horsehair worms)
*Loricifera
*Priapulida
*Kinorhyncha
*Rotifera, including Acanthocephala (spiny-headed worms)

==Acoelomates==
Acoelomates lack a fluid-filled body cavity between the body wall and digestive tract. This can cause some serious disadvantages. Fluid compression is negligible, while the tissue surrounding the organs of these animals will compress. Therefore, acoelomate organs are not protected from crushing forces applied to the animal&#x27;s outer surface. The coelom can be used for diffusion of gases and metabolites etc. These creatures do not have this need, as the surface area to volume ratio is large enough to allow absorption of nutrients and gas exchange by diffusion alone, due to dorso-ventral flattening.

*Flatworms
* Micrognathozoa
*Mesozoa
*Xenacoelomorpha
*Gastrotricha, traditionally viewed as blastocoelomates
*Entoprocta, traditionally viewed as blastocoelomates
*Gnathostomulida, traditionally viewed as blastocoelomates
*Cycliophora

A body cavity is also absent in placozoans, cnidarians (jellyfish and allies) and the ctenophores (comb jellies), but these animals are neither bilaterians or triploblastic.

<text>An emergency medical technician (often, more simply, EMT) is a medical professional that provides emergency medical services. EMTs are most commonly found serving on ambulances and in fire departments in the US and Canada, as full-time and some part-time departments require their firefighters to at least be EMT certified. 

In English-speaking countries, paramedics are a separate profession that has additional educational requirements, qualifications, and scope of practice.

EMTs are often employed by public ambulance services, municipal EMS agencies, governments, hospitals, and fire departments. Some EMTs are paid employees, while others (particularly those in rural areas) are volunteers. EMTs provide medical care under a set of protocols, which are typically written by a physician.

== Hazard controls ==
EMTs are exposed to a variety of hazards such as lifting patients and equipment, treating those with infectious disease, handling hazardous substances, and transportation via ground or air vehicles. Employers can prevent occupational illness or injury by providing safe patient handling equipment, implementing a training program to educate EMTs on job hazards, and supplying PPE such as respirators, gloves, and isolation gowns when dealing with biological hazards.

Infectious disease has become a major concern in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies and organizations have issued guidance regarding workplace hazard controls for COVID-19. Some specific recommendations include modified call queries, symptom screening, universal PPE use, hand hygiene, physical distancing, and stringent disinfection protocols. Research on ambulance ventilation systems found that aerosols often recirculate throughout the compartment, creating a health hazard for EMTs when transporting sick patients capable of airborne transmission. Unidirectional airflow design can better protect workers.

==Canada==

There is considerable degree of inter-provincial variation in the Canadian paramedic practice. Although a national consensus (by way of the National Occupational Competency Profile) identifies certain knowledge, skills, and abilities as being most synonymous with a given level of paramedic practice, each province retains ultimate authority in legislating the actual administration and delivery of emergency medical services within its own borders. For this reason, any discussion of &quot;paramedic practice&quot; in Canada is necessarily broad, and general. Specific regulatory frameworks and questions related to paramedic practices can only definitively be answered by consulting relevant provincial legislation, although provincial paramedic associations may often offer a simpler overview of this topic when it is restricted to a province-by-province basis.

In Canada, the levels of paramedic practice as defined by the National Occupational Competency Profile are: emergency medical responder (EMR), primary care paramedic, advanced care paramedic, and critical care paramedic.

Regulatory frameworks vary from province to province, and include direct government regulation (such as Ontario&#x27;s method of credentialing its practitioners with the title of A-EMCA, or advanced emergency medical care assistant) to professional self-regulating bodies, such as the Alberta College of Paramedics. In Alberta, for instance, only someone registered with the Alberta College of Paramedics can call themselves a paramedic; the title is legally protected. Almost all provinces have moved to adopting the new titles, or have at least recognized the NOCP document as a benchmarking document to permit inter-provincial labour mobility of practitioners, regardless of how titles are specifically regulated within their own provincial systems. In this manner, the confusing myriad of titles and occupational descriptions can at least be discussed using a common language for comparison sake.

===Emergency medical responder===
Most providers that work in ambulances are identified as &quot;paramedics&quot; by the public. However, in many cases, the most prevalent level of emergency pre-hospital care is that which is provided by an emergency medical responder (EMR). This is a level of practice recognized under the National Occupational Competency Profile, although unlike the next three successive levels of practice, the high number of EMRs across Canada cannot be ignored as contributing a critical role in the chain of survival, although it is a level of practice that is least comprehensive (clinically speaking), and is also generally not consistent with any medical acts beyond advanced first-aid and oxygen therapy, administration of ASA, I.M. epinephrine and glucagon, oral glucose and administration of intranasal Narcan with the exception of automated external defibrillation (which is still considered a regulated medical act in most provinces in Canada).

===Primary care paramedic===
Primary care paramedics (PCP) are the entry-level of paramedic practice in Canadian provinces. The scope of practice includes performing semi-automated external defibrillation, interpretation of 4-lead ECGs, administration of symptom relief medications for a variety of emergency medical conditions (these include oxygen, epinephrine, dextrose, glucagon, salbutamol, ASA and nitroglycerine), performing trauma immobilization (including cervical immobilization), and other fundamental basic medical care. Primary care paramedics may also receive additional training in order to perform certain skills that are normally in the scope of practice of advanced care paramedics. This is regulated both provincially (by statute) and locally (by the medical director), and ordinarily entails an aspect of medical oversight by a specific body or group of physicians. This is often referred to as &quot;medical control&quot;, or a role played by a base hospital. For example, in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador, many paramedic services allow primary care paramedics to perform 12-lead ECG interpretation, or initiate intravenous therapy to deliver a few additional medications.

===Advanced care paramedic===
Advanced care paramedic (ACP) is a level of practitioner that is in high demand by many services across Canada. However, Quebec only utilizes this level of practice in a very limited fashion as part of a pilot program in Montreal. The ACP typically carries approximately 20 different medications, although the number and type of medications may vary substantially from region to region. ACPs perform advanced airway management including intubation, surgical airways, intravenous therapy, place external jugular IV lines, perform needle thoracotomy, perform and interpret 12-lead ECGs, perform synchronized and chemical cardioversion, transcutaneous pacing, perform obstetrical assessments, and provide pharmacological pain relief for various conditions. Several sites in Canada have adopted pre-hospital fibrinolytics and rapid sequence induction, and prehospital medical research has permitted a great number of variations in the scope of practice for ACPs. Current programs include providing ACPs with discretionary direct 24-hour access to PCI labs, bypassing the emergency department, and representing a fundamental change in both the way that patients with S-T segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) are treated, but also profoundly affecting survival rates, as well as bypassing closer hospitals to get an identified stroke patient to a stroke centre.

===Critical care paramedic===

Critical care paramedics (CCPs) are paramedics who generally do not respond to 9-1-1 emergency calls, with the exception of helicopter &quot;scene&quot; calls. Instead they focus on transferring patients from the hospital they are currently in to other hospitals that can provide a higher level of care. CCPs often work in collaboration with registered nurses and respiratory therapists during hospital transfers. This ensures continuity of care. However, when acuity is manageable by a CCP or a registered nurse or respiratory therapist is not available, CCPs will work alone. Providing this care to the patient allows the sending hospital to avoid losing highly trained staff on hospital transfers.

CCPs are able to provide all of the care that PCPs and ACPs provide. That being said, CCPs significantly lack practical experience with advanced skills such as IV initiation, peripheral access to cardiovascular system for fluid and drug administration, advanced airway, and many other techniques. While a PCP and ACP may run 40–50 medical codes per year, a CCP may run 1–2 in an entire career. IV/IO starts are nearly non-existent in the field and for this reason CCPs are required to attend nearly double the amount of time in classroom situations or in hospital to keep current. In addition to this, they are trained for other skills such as medication infusion pumps, mechanical ventilation, and arterial line monitoring.

CCPs often work in fixed and rotary wing aircraft when the weather permits and staff are available, but systems such as the Toronto EMS Critical Care Transport Program work in land ambulances. ORNGE transport operates both land and aircraft in Ontario. In British Columbia, CCPs work primarily in aircraft with a dedicated critical care transport crew in Trail for long-distance transfers and a regular CCP street crew stationed in South Vancouver that often also performs medevacs when necessary.

===Training===
Paramedic training in Canada varies regionally; for example, the length of training may be eight months in British Columbia or two to four years in Ontario, Alberta, and Quebec. The nature of training and how it is regulated, like actual paramedic practice, varies from province to province.

==Ireland==

Emergency medical technician (EMT), paramedic (P) and advanced paramedic (AP) are legally defined and protected titles in Ireland based on the standard set down by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC). Emergency medical technician is the entry-level standard of practitioner for employment within the ambulance service. Currently, EMTs are authorized to work on non-emergency ambulances only as the standard for emergency (999) calls is a minimum of a two-paramedic crew, although this minimum requirement was relaxed to and EMT - paramedic crew during the COVID-19 crisis. EMTs are a vital part of the private, voluntary and auxiliary services where a practitioner must be on board any ambulance in the process of transporting a patient to hospital.


==Philippines==
Emergency medical technician (EMT), paramedic (P) and advanced paramedic (AP) are legally defined and protected titles in the Philippines based on the standard set down by the Department of Health.

== Spain ==
&quot;Técnico en Emergencias Sanitarias&quot; (TES) are trained a total of 2000hrs in 2 years with 3 months of internship in ambulances at the very end. It&#x27;s the only level of EMS worker. BLS ambulances can be driven with a B license, ALS with a C1.
ALS ambulances also carry an Emergency Physician and an Emergency Nurse.

==United Kingdom==

&quot;Emergency medical technician&quot; is a term that has existed for many years in the United Kingdom, but has no single defined scope. They may be known as &quot;emergency medical technician&quot; or simply, &quot;ambulance technician&quot;. Most EMTs hold an Institute for Healthcare Development Ambulance Technician Certificate and are employed in private ambulance companies or in National Health Service ambulance trusts.

As of 2016, The IHCD Ambulance Technician Certificate was replaced with the FAQ Level 4 Diploma for Associate Ambulance Practitioners &amp; QA Level 5 Diploma in First Response Emergency and Urgent Care (RQF) This provided a defined scope of practice agreed nationally by ambulance service trusts. Their role title, however, may still be defined by their employer as &quot;emergency medical technician&quot;. 

They can work autonomously, making their own clinical decisions within their training and remit. They may also work as a clinical lead working alongside an emergency care assistant or as assistants themselves to a paramedic.

As the role does not have a single defined scope, the skills they have can include:

* Administration of select general sales list, pharmacy and prescription only medicines under provision of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012
* Administration of medicines by select parenteral or non-parenteral routes; typically oral, intramuscular, inhaled, nebulised or sublingual
* Intermediate life support, including manual defibrillation and supraglottic airway placement
* Ability to discharge patients to different care pathways
The term &quot;emergency medical technician&quot; is not commonly used by members of the public in the United Kingdom. Instead, it is common for all ambulance personnel to be referred to as &quot;paramedics&quot;, although the paramedic title is protected under registration of the Health and Care Professions Council.

==United States==

=== Certification ===
In the United States, EMTs are certified according to their level of training. Individual states set their own standards of certification (or licensure, in some cases) and all EMT training must meet the minimum requirements as set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#x27;s (NHTSA&#x27;s) standards for curriculum. The National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) is a nonprofit organization which offers certification exams based on NHTSA education guidelines and has been around since the 1970s. Currently, NREMT exams are used by 46 states as the sole basis for certification at one or more EMT certification levels. A NREMT exam consists of skills and patient assessments as well as a written portion.

On June 12, 2019, the NREMT changed the rules regarding age limits for EMTs, AEMTs, and paramedics. There is no longer an age limit for registered personnel. However, applicants must successfully complete a state-approved EMT course that meets or exceeds the NREMT standards within the past two years of applying. Those applying for the NREMT certification must also complete a state-approved EMT psychomotor exam. It is possible for the candidate to be refused access to a state-approved course due to their age within the state. 

=== Levels ===


NHTSA recognizes four levels of certification:
* Emergency medical responder (EMR)
* Emergency medical technician (EMT)
* Advanced emergency medical technician (AEMT)
* Paramedic

Some states also recognize the advanced practice paramedic or critical care paramedic level as a state-specific licensure above that of paramedic. These critical care paramedics generally perform high acuity transports that require skills outside the scope of a standard paramedic (such as mechanical ventilation and management of cardiac assist devices). In addition, EMTs can seek out specialty certifications such as wilderness EMT, wilderness paramedic, tactical EMT, and flight paramedic.

In 2009, the NREMT posted information about a transition to a new system of levels for emergency care providers developed by NHTSA with the National EMS Scope of Practice Project. By 2014, these new levels replaced the fragmented system found around the United States. The new classification includes emergency medical responder (replacing first responder), emergency medical technician (replacing EMT-basic), advanced emergency medical technician (replacing EMT-intermediate/85), and paramedic (replacing EMT-intermediate/99 and EMT-paramedic). Education requirements in transitioning to the new levels are substantially similar.

====Emergency Medical Responder (EMR)====
EMR is the most basic level of training, and is considered the bare minimum certification for rescuers that respond to medical emergencies. EMRs are typically on-call volunteers in rural communities, or are primarily employed as firefighters or search and rescue personnel. EMRs typically arrive quickly and assess and stabilize the patient before the transporting ambulance arrives, and then assist the crew with patient care and packaging. 

EMRs provide advanced first aid-level care, CPR, semi-automatic defibrillation, basic airway management (suction/oropharyngeal airway), oxygen therapy, and administration of basic, life-saving medications such as epinephrine and naloxone.

====Emergency Medical Technician (EMT)====
EMT is the next level of EMS certification and is considered the most common entry level of training. The procedures and skills allowed at this level include bleeding control, management of burns, splinting of suspected fractures and spinal injuries, childbirth, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, semi-automatic defibrillation, oral suctioning, insertion of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airways, pulse oximetry, blood glucose monitoring, auscultation of lung sounds, and administration of a limited set of medications (including oxygen, epinephrine, dextrose, naloxone, albuterol, ipratropium bromide, glucagon, nitroglycerin, nitrous oxide, and acetylsalicylic acid). Some areas may add to the scope of practice, including intravenous access, insertion of supraglottic airway devices, and CPAP. Training requirements and treatment protocols vary from area to area.

==== Advanced EMT ====
Advanced EMT is the level of training between EMT and paramedic. They can provide intermediate life support (ILS) care including obtaining intravenous or intraosseous access, basic cardiac monitoring, fluid resuscitation, capnography, and administration of some additional medications. 

==== Paramedic ====
Paramedics typically represent the highest degree of pre-hospital medical provider, providing advanced life support (ALS) care. Paramedics perform a variety of medical procedures such as endotracheal intubation, rapid sequence induction, cricothyrotomy, fluid resuscitation, drug administration, obtaining intravenous and intraosseous access, manual defibrillation, electrocardiogram interpretation, capnography, cardioversion, transcutaneous pacing, pericardiocentesis, thoracostomy, ultrasonography, and blood chemistry interpretation.

=== Staffing levels ===
An ambulance with only EMTs is considered a basic life support (BLS) unit, an ambulance utilizing AEMTs is dubbed an &quot;intermediate life support&quot; (ILS), or &quot;limited advanced life support&quot; (LALS) unit, and an ambulance with paramedics is dubbed an &quot;advanced life support&quot; (ALS) unit. Many states allow ambulance crews to contain a mix of crews levels (e.g. an EMT and a paramedic or an AEMT and a paramedic) to staff ambulances and operate at the level of the highest trained provider. There is nothing stopping supplemental crew members to be of a certain certification, though (e.g. if an ALS ambulance is required to have two paramedics, then it is acceptable to have two paramedics and an EMT). An emergency vehicle with only EMRs or a combination of both EMRs and EMTs is still dubbed a &quot;basic life support&quot; (BLS) unit. An EMR must usually be overseen by an EMT-level provider or higher to work on a transporting ambulance.

=== Education and training ===
EMT training programs for certification vary greatly from course to course, provided that each course at least meets local and national requirements. In the United States, EMRs receive at least 40–80 hours of classroom training and EMTs receive at least 120–300 hours of classroom training. AEMTs generally have 100-300 hours of additional classroom training beyond the standard EMT training. Paramedics are trained for 1,500–2,500 hours or more. 

In addition to each level&#x27;s didactic education, clinical rotations are typically also required. Similar in a sense to medical school clinical rotations, EMT students are required to spend a required amount of time in an ambulance and on a variety of hospital services (e.g. obstetrics, emergency medicine, surgery, intensive care unit, psychiatry) in order to complete a course and become eligible for the certification and licensure exams.

The number of clinical hours for both time in an ambulance and time in the hospital vary depending on local requirements, the level the student is obtaining, and the amount of time it takes the student to show competency.

In addition, a minimum of continuing education (CE) hours is required to maintain certification. For example, to maintain NREMT certification, EMTs must obtain at least 48 hours of additional education and either complete a 24-hour refresher course or complete an additional 24 hours of CE that cover, on an hour by hour basis, the same topics as the refresher course would. Recertification for other levels follows a similar pattern.

EMT training programs vary greatly in calendar length (number of days or months). For example, fast track programs are available for EMTs that are completed in two weeks by holding class for 8 to 12 hours a day for at least two weeks. Other training programs are months long, or up to two years for paramedics in associate degree programs. 
EMT training programs take place at numerous locations, such as universities, community colleges, technical schools, hospitals or EMS academies. Every state in the United States has an EMS lead agency or state office of emergency medical services that regulates and accredits EMT training programs. Most of these offices have web sites to provide information to the public and individuals who are interested in becoming an EMT.

=== Medical direction ===
In the United States, an EMT&#x27;s actions in the field are governed by state regulations, local regulations, and by the policies of their EMS organization. The development of these policies are guided by a physician medical director, often with the advice of a medical advisory committee composed of paramedics and other health professionals.

In California, for example, each county&#x27;s local emergency medical service agency (LEMSA) issues a list of standard operating procedures or protocols, under the supervision of the California Emergency Medical Services Authority. These procedures often vary from county to county based on local needs, levels of training and clinical experiences. New York State has similar procedures, whereas a regional medical-advisory council (REMAC) determines protocols for one or more counties in a geographical section of the state.

Treatments and procedures administered by paramedics fall under one of two categories, off-line medical orders (standing orders) and on-line medical orders. On-line medical orders refers to procedures that must be explicitly approved by a base hospital physician or registered nurse through voice communication (generally by phone or radio) and are generally rare or high risk procedures (e.g. vasopressor initiation). In addition, when multiple levels can perform the same procedure (e.g. AEMT-critical care and paramedics in New York), a procedure can be both an on-line and a standing order depending on the level of the provider. Since no set of protocols can cover every patient situation, many systems work with protocols as guidelines. Systems also have policies in place to handle medical direction when communication failures happen or in disaster situations. The NHTSA curriculum is the foundation Standard of Care for EMS providers in the US.

=== Employment ===
EMTs and paramedics are employed in varied settings, mainly the prehospital environment such as in EMS, fire, and police agencies. They can also be found in positions ranging from hospital and health care settings, to industrial and entertainment positions. The prehospital environment is loosely divided into non-emergency (e.g. patient transport) and emergency (9-1-1 calls) services, but many ambulance services and EMS agencies operate both non-emergency and emergency care.

In many places across the United States, it is not uncommon for the primary employer of EMRs, EMTs, and paramedics to be a fire department, with the fire department providing the primary emergency medical system response including &quot;first responder&quot; fire apparatus, as well as ambulances. In many other locations, emergency medical services are provided by a separate, or &quot;third-party&quot;, municipal government emergency agency (e.g. Boston EMS, Austin-Travis County EMS). In still other locations, emergency medical services are provided by volunteer agencies. College and university campuses may provide emergency medical responses on their own campus using students.

In some states of the US, many EMS agencies are run by independent non-profit volunteer first aid squads that are their own corporations set up as separate entities from fire departments. In this environment, volunteers are hired to fill certain blocks of time to cover emergency calls. These volunteers have the same state certification as their paid counterparts.

<doc id="75006" wikidata="Q330204" url="?curid=75006" title="Paramedic">
<text>A paramedic is a healthcare professional trained in the medical model, whose main role has historically been to respond to emergency calls for medical help outside of a hospital. Paramedics work as part of the emergency medical services (EMS), most often in ambulances. They also have roles in emergency medicine, primary care, transfer medicine and remote/offshore medicine. The scope of practice of a paramedic varies between countries, but generally includes autonomous decision making around the emergency care of patients.

Not all ambulance personnel are paramedics, although the term is sometimes used informally to refer to any ambulance personnel. In some English-speaking countries, there is an official distinction between paramedics and emergency medical technicians (or emergency care assistants), in which paramedics have additional educational requirements and scope of practice.

== Functions and duties ==
The paramedic role is closely related to other healthcare positions, especially the emergency medical technician, with paramedics often being at a higher grade with more responsibility and autonomy following substantially greater education and training. The primary role of a paramedic is to stabilize people with life-threatening injuries and transport these patients to a higher level of care (typically an emergency department). Due to the nature of their job, paramedics work in many environments, including roadways, people&#x27;s homes, and depending on their qualifications, wilderness environments, hospitals, aircraft, and with SWAT teams during police operations. Paramedics also work in non-emergency situations, such as transporting chronically ill patients to and from treatment centers and in some areas, address social determinants of health and provide in-home care to ill patients at risk of hospitalization (a practice known as community paramedicine).

The role of a paramedic varies widely across the world, as EMS providers operate with many different models of care. In the Anglo-American model, paramedics are autonomous decision-makers. In some countries such as the United Kingdom and South Africa, the paramedic role has developed into an autonomous health profession. In the Franco-German model, ambulance care is led by physicians. In some versions of this model, such as France, there is no direct equivalent to a paramedic. Ambulance staff have either the more advanced qualifications of a physician or less advanced training in first aid. In other versions of the Franco-German model, such as Germany, paramedics do exist. Their role is very similar to the role of paramedics in the Anglo-American model with an advanced scope of autonomy and practice, and the added element of emergency physician backup, either virtually (Tele-Notarzt) or on scene with a rapid response vehicle / helicopter. The role of paramedics in Germany has evolved from support to physicians in the field to the central role in pre-hospital emergency care. 

The development of the profession has been a gradual move from simply transporting patients to hospital, to more advanced treatments in the field. In some countries, the paramedic may take on the role as part of a system to prevent hospitalization entirely and, through practitioners, are able to prescribe certain medications, or undertaking &#x27;see and refer&#x27; visits, where the paramedic directly refers a patient to specialist services without taking them to hospital.

== Occupational hazards ==
Paramedics are exposed to a variety of hazards such as lifting patients and equipment, treating those with infectious disease, handling hazardous substances, and transportation via ground or air vehicles. Employers can prevent occupational illness or injury by providing safe patient handling equipment, implementing a training program to educate paramedics on job hazards, and supplying PPE such as respirators, gloves, and isolation gowns when dealing with biological hazards.

Infectious disease has become a major concern, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies and organizations have issued guidance regarding workplace hazard controls for COVID-19. Some specific recommendations include modified call queries, symptom screening, universal PPE use, hand hygiene, physical distancing, and stringent disinfection protocols. Research on ambulance ventilation systems found that aerosols often recirculate throughout the compartment, creating a health hazard for paramedics when transporting sick patients capable of airborne transmission. Unidirectional airflow design can better protect workers.

To further safeguard paramedics, incorporating evidence-based strategies for managing chemical exposures and environmental risks is crucial. Agencies such as OSHA, WHO and NIOSH offer comprehensive guidelines that highlight the integration of safety protocols, technological advancements, and procedural innovations to enhance paramedic safety and well-being.

=== Physical injuries ===
Paramedics are widely recognized to face high risks of physical injuries in their line of work. More than 22,000 EMS providers visit the emergency room each year for work-related injuries. Some physical injuries encountered when providing healthcare services include lifting injuries, back strains, and needlestick incidences. Injuries such as sprains and strains mostly occur in the back and neck, and injuries are most prevalent while responding to 911 calls, which include patient care and transport. These injuries are prevalent but not impossible to overcome; they require preventive measures to minimize the chance of them happening. Safe lifting techniques and patient-handling equipment are major factors in reducing paramedics’ physical injury risk. Workers with less than 10 years’ experience are most at risk, pointing to the need for targeted prevention strategies for newer employees. By employing the proposed measures to reduce physical injuries, it will be possible to mitigate the hazards faced by paramedics, to help paramedics stay safe while rendering the most needed services. 
=== Infectious diseases ===
The risk of contracting infectious diseases is common in the paramedic profession. The COVID-19 pandemic strengthens the necessity of following safety protocols. Preventive measures for healthcare workers from needlestick injuries and infectious disease is critical. Including, the immediate disposal of sharps in puncture-resistant containers and wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and strict adherence to post-exposure protocols, enhances safety. Additionally, staying updated with vaccinations, including those for flu, COVID-19, Hepatitis B. Furthermore, adhering to infection control practices, such as hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, and specialized control programs, are vital for preventing infections like MRSA, TB, and COVID-19. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) usage in implementation and vaccination compliance are effective transmission reduction measures for infectious diseases among paramedics. Exposures to blood pathogens and body fluids through incidents, for example, needlestick injuries which jeopardizes paramedics at risk of infectious diseases such as Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C, and HIV affecting around 6,000 EMS workers. This realization strengthens the need for science-based methods in preventing the occupational risks posed by infectious diseases with a foregrounding of the role of preventative measures geared towards protecting the health of paramedic professionals and, at the same time, the community.

=== Chemical exposures ===
Paramedics encounter daily risks associated with handling hazardous chemicals. As a result, they must understand how to deliver care safely to remain protected in the service provision. They need to remain cautious for them to stay safe in the process of providing care. There are numerous associated risks from chemical exposures in prehospital settings. The use of PPE and standard precautions are necessary to prevent harmful exposures for paramedics. Desirable implementation of the ordered processing of hazardous material and the proper decontamination process are effective strategies in combating hazard risk. Such steps are necessary to ensure fewer cases of health hazards to paramedics.

=== Environmental and operational hazards ===
Paramedics are confronted with many challenges exhibited in the form of environmental and operational risks, primarily during transportation. These transportation-related hazards should be considered and addressed in prehospital care. Slips, trips, and falls; motor vehicle incidents; and violence or assaults have huge impact on paramedics&#x27; occupational hazards, resulting to thousands of paramedics impacted annually. Vehicle safety features need to be known by paramedics, and so must undergo exhaustive emergency driving training, which looks into curbing the provisions that are the peril of transportation. Paramedics are frequently assaulted by patients or bystanders affecting around 2,000 EMS workers annually, which further hammers the need for training on de-escalation. NIOSH and the Department of Homeland Security have conducted ambulance crash testing, resulting in the development of 10 test methods published by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) to reduce and eliminate crash-related injuries to EMS workers. Through effective training, the threat cases are more likely to be mitigated, and the paramedics will have a better chance to provide services as required.

== Protective measures and equipment ==

One way of ensuring paramedics work at optimal efficiency is to provide them with protective equipment and gear to mitigate the possible risks when executing their duties. PPE keeps paramedics’ occupational risks low. Examples of PPEs include gloves, masks, and gown or specific clothing; they protect workers from physical, biological, and chemical hazards. The different types of PPE include respiratory, eye, face, and hand protection. Under respiratory protection, paramedics can use N95 masks to filter airborne contaminants. Chemical splashes are also a common hazard faced by paramedics, where safety goggles can be used for eye protection. Underhand protection, paramedics can employ gloves mainly to curb burns. One of the principles of PPE is that choices should be guided by specific risks associated with various emergencies, which warrant different PPE requirements.

=== Mental health and stress management ===
Paramedic are involved in challenging professions and can be subject to different kinds of psychological stress, for instance, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, or severe burnout. The psychological aspect is intertwined with the nature of the paramedics&#x27; work. Exposure to traumatic events such as accidents, medical emergencies, and violence are some of the factors undermining the psychological health of paramedics. Mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, are some of the mental health issues paramedics are likely to get exposed to due to their nature of work as compared to the general population. Stable support systems that may include peer counselling and the availability of mental health resources become essential in building the resilience of paramedic professionals. Peer counselling programs appear to be an effective stress management strategy for paramedics. Taking part in open discussions with other peers who understand what the employee is going through determines the necessary supportive grounds that facilitate managing and processing feelings related to this work.

=== Health risks and monitoring ===
The long-term health risks that need to be observed by the paramedics are Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and cancer risk. There are a variety of challenges paramedics encounter, including PTSD, which should provide a compelling reason to implement preventive mental health measures within this profession. Moreover, there is an extra risk for CVDs because of the heaviness of emergency response operations. There is a need to emphasize cancer risk and the importance of constant exploration and individualized prevention patterns. Besides, there is the cumulative effect of fatigue, violence, and trauma on the health of paramedics. As a result, there is a need for systematic monitoring and preventive measures in health among paramedics. It is necessary to study long-term health risks for paramedics and apply a prophylactic approach to maintaining the health state of healthcare professionals.

=== Regulatory guidelines and recommendations ===
The regulatory guidelines are fundamental in eliminating occupational risk in paramedicine; authoritative bodies like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) provide specific guidelines. For example, in United States, physical, chemical, and biological hazards are managed by operating under the guidelines and recommendations offered by NIOSH and OSHA, targeting the healthcare industry especially. These include properly using PPE, handling hazardous substances, and adequately managing workplace violence. Moreover, the WHO provides global views by laying international standards to protect the well-being of the staff involved in the healthcare provided, irrespective of whether it is an emergency or routine operation. Such regulatory bodies, as the ones promoting national and global safety standards, ensure that evidence-based approaches reinforce adherence to their occupational health being safeguarded.

==History==
===Early history===
Throughout the evolution of pre-hospitalization care, there has been an ongoing association with military conflict. One of the first indications of a formal process for managing injured people dates from the Imperial Legions of Rome, where aging Centurions, no longer able to fight, were given the task of organizing the removal of the wounded from the battlefield and providing some form of care. Such individuals, although not physicians, were probably among the world&#x27;s earliest surgeons by default, being required to suture wounds and complete amputations. A similar situation existed in the Crusades, with the Knights Hospitaller of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem filling a similar function; this organisation continued, and evolved into what is now known throughout the Commonwealth of Nations as the St. John Ambulance and as the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps in the Republic of Ireland and various countries.

===Early ambulance services===
While civilian communities had organized ways to deal with prehospitalisation care and transportation of the sick and dying as far back as the bubonic plague in London between 1598 and 1665, such arrangements were typically &quot;ad hoc&quot; and temporary. In time, however, these arrangements began to formalize and become permanent. During the American Civil War, Jonathan Letterman devised a system of mobile field hospitals employing the first uses of the principles of triage. After returning home, some veterans began to attempt to apply what had they had seen on the battlefield to their own communities, and commenced the creation of volunteer life-saving squads and ambulance corps.

These early developments in formalized ambulance services were decided at local levels, and this led to services being provided by diverse operators such as the local hospital, police, fire brigade, or even funeral directors who often possessed the only local transport allowing a passenger to lie down. In most cases these ambulances were operated by drivers and attendants with little or no medical training, and it was some time before formal training began to appear in some units. An early example was the members of the Toronto Police Ambulance Service receiving a mandatory five days of training from St. John as early as 1889.

Prior to World War I motorized ambulances started to be developed, but once they proved their effectiveness on the battlefield during the war the concept spread rapidly to civilian systems. In terms of advanced skills, once again the military led the way. During World War II and the Korean War battlefield medics administered painkilling narcotics by injection in emergency situations, and pharmacists&#x27; mates on warships were permitted to do even more without the guidance of a physician. The Korean War also marked the first widespread use of helicopters to evacuate the wounded from forward positions to medical units, leading to the rise of the term &quot;medevac&quot;. These innovations would not find their way into the civilian sphere for nearly twenty more years.

===Pre-hospital emergency medical care===
By the early 1960s experiments in improving medical care had begun in some civilian centres. One early experiment involved the provision of pre-hospital cardiac care by physicians in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 1966. This was repeated in Toronto, Canada in 1968 using a single ambulance called &quot;Cardiac One&quot;, which was staffed by a regular ambulance crew, along with a hospital intern to perform the advanced procedures. While both of these experiments had certain levels of success, the technology had not yet reached a sufficiently advanced level to be fully effective; for example, the Toronto portable defibrillator and heart monitor was powered by lead-acid car batteries, and weighed around .
In 1966, a report called &quot;Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society&quot;—commonly known as &quot;The White Paper&quot;—was published in the United States. This paper presented data showing that soldiers who were seriously wounded on the battlefields during the Vietnam War had a better survival rate than people who were seriously injured in motor vehicle accidents on California&#x27;s freeways. Key factors contributing to victim survival in transport to definitive care such as a hospital were identified as comprehensive trauma care, rapid transport to designated trauma facilities, and the presence of medical corpsmen who were trained to perform certain critical advanced medical procedures such as fluid replacement and airway management.

As a result of &quot;The White Paper&quot;, the US government moved to develop minimum standards for ambulance training, ambulance equipment and vehicle design. These new standards were incorporated into Federal Highway Safety legislation and the states were advised to either adopt these standards into state laws or risk a reduction in Federal highway safety funding. The &quot;White Paper&quot; also prompted the inception of a number of emergency medical service (EMS) pilot units across the US including paramedic programs. The success of these units led to a rapid transition to make them fully operational.

Founded in 1967, Freedom House Ambulance Service was the first civilian emergency medical service in the United States to be staffed by paramedics, most of whom were Black. 
New York City&#x27;s Saint Vincent&#x27;s Hospital developed the United States&#x27; first Mobile Coronary Care Unit (MCCU) under the medical direction of William Grace, MD, and based on Frank Pantridge&#x27;s MCCU project in Belfast, Northern Ireland. In 1967, Eugene Nagle, MD and Jim Hirschmann, MD helped pioneer the United States&#x27; first EKG telemetry transmission to a hospital and then in 1968, a functional paramedic program in conjunction with the City of Miami Fire Department. In 1969, the City of Columbus Fire Department joined with the Ohio State University Medical Center to develop the &quot;HEARTMOBILE&quot; paramedic program under the medical direction of James Warren, MD and Richard Lewis, MD. In 1969, the Haywood County (NC) Volunteer Rescue Squad developed a paramedic program (then called Mobile Intensive Care Technicians) under the medical direction of Ralph Feichter, MD. In 1969, the initial Los Angeles paramedic training program was instituted in conjunction with Harbor General Hospital, now Harbor–UCLA Medical Center, under the medical direction of J. Michael Criley, MD and James Lewis, MD. In 1969, the Seattle &quot;Medic 1&quot; paramedic program was developed in conjunction with the Harborview Medical Center under the medical direction of Leonard Cobb, MD. The Marietta (GA) initial paramedic project was instituted in the Fall of 1970 in conjunction with Kennestone Hospital and Metro Ambulance Service, Inc. under the medical direction of Luther Fortson, MD. The Los Angeles County and City established paramedic programs following the passage of &quot;The Wedsworth-Townsend Act&quot; in 1970. Other cities and states passed their own paramedic bills, leading to the formation of services across the US. Many other countries also followed suit, and paramedic units formed around the world.

In the military, however, the required telemetry and miniaturization technologies were more advanced, particularly due to initiatives such as the space program. It would take several more years before these technologies drifted through to civilian applications. In North America, physicians were judged to be too expensive to be used in the pre-hospital setting, although such initiatives were implemented, and sometimes still operate, in European countries and Latin America.

===Public notability===
While doing background research at Los Angeles&#x27; UCLA Harbor Medical Center for a proposed new show about doctors, television producer Robert A. Cinader, working for Jack Webb, happened to encounter &quot;firemen who spoke like doctors and worked with them&quot;. This concept developed into the television series &quot;Emergency!&quot;, which ran from 1972 to 1977, portraying the exploits of this new profession called paramedics. The show gained popularity with emergency services personnel, the medical community, and the general public. When the show first aired in 1972, there were just six paramedic units operating in three pilot programs in the whole of the US, and the term paramedic was essentially unknown. By the time the program ended in 1977, there were paramedics operating in all fifty states. The show&#x27;s technical advisor, James O. Page, was a pioneer of paramedicine and responsible for the UCLA paramedic program; he would go on to help establish paramedic programs throughout the US, and was the founding publisher of the &quot;Journal of Emergency Medical Services&quot; (&quot;JEMS&quot;). The &quot;JEMS&quot; magazine creation resulted from Page&#x27;s previous purchase of the &quot;PARAMEDICS International&quot; magazine. Ron Stewart, the show&#x27;s medical director, was instrumental in organizing emergency health services in southern California earlier in his career during the 1970s, in the paramedic program in Pittsburgh, and had a substantial role in the founding of the paramedic programs in Toronto and Nova Scotia, Canada.

===Evolution and growth===
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the paramedic field continued to evolve, with a shift in emphasis from patient transport to treatment both on scene and en route to hospitals. This led to some services changing their descriptions from &quot;ambulance services&quot; to &quot;emergency medical services&quot;.
The training, knowledge-base, and skill sets of both paramedics and emergency medical technicians (EMTs) were typically determined by local medical directors based primarily on the perceived needs of the community along with affordability. There were also large differences between localities in the amount and type of training required, and how it would be provided. This ranged from in-service training in local systems, through community colleges, and up to university level education. This emphasis on increasing qualifications has followed the progression of other health professions such as nursing, which also progressed from on the job training to university level qualifications.

The variations in educational approaches and standards required for paramedics has led to large differences in the required qualifications between locations—both within individual countries and from country to country. Within the UK training is a three-year course equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Comparisons have been made between paramedics and nurses; with nurses now requiring degree entry (BSc) the knowledge deficit is large between the two fields. This has led to many countries passing laws to protect the title of &quot;paramedic&quot; (or its local equivalent) from use by anyone except those qualified and experienced to a defined standard. This usually means that paramedics must be registered with the appropriate body in their country; for example all paramedics in the United Kingdom must by registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) in order to call themselves a paramedic. In the United States, a similar system is operated by the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT), although this is only accepted by forty of the fifty states.

As paramedicine has evolved, a great deal of both the curriculum and skill set has existed in a state of flux. Requirements often originated and evolved at the local level, and were based upon the preferences of physician advisers and medical directors. Recommended treatments would change regularly, often changing more like a fashion than a scientific discipline. Associated technologies also rapidly evolved and changed, with medical equipment manufacturers having to adapt equipment that worked inadequately outside of hospitals, to be able to cope with the less controlled pre-hospital environment.

Physicians began to take more interest in paramedics from a research perspective as well. By about 1990, the fluctuating trends began to diminish, being replaced by outcomes-based research. This research then drove further evolution of the practice of both paramedics and the emergency physicians who oversaw their work, with changes to procedures and protocols occurring only after significant research demonstrated their need and effectiveness (an example being ALS). Such changes affected everything from simple procedures such as CPR, to changes in drug protocols. As the profession grew, some paramedics went on to become not just research participants, but researchers in their own right, with their own projects and journal publications. In 2010, the American Board of Emergency Medicine created a medical subspecialty for physicians who work in emergency medical services.

Changes in procedures also included the manner in which the work of paramedics was overseen and managed. In the early days medical control and oversight was direct and immediate, with paramedics calling into a local hospital and receiving orders for every individual procedure or drug. While this still occurs in some jurisdictions, it has become increasingly rare. Day-to-day operations largely moved from direct and immediate medical control to pre-written protocols or standing orders, with the paramedic typically seeking advice after the options in the standing orders had been exhausted.

====Canada====
While the evolution of paramedicine described above is focused largely on the US, many other countries followed a similar pattern, although often with significant variations. Canada, for example, attempted a pilot paramedic training program at Queen&#x27;s University, Kingston, Ontario, in 1972. The program, which intended to upgrade the then mandatory 160 hours of training for ambulance attendants, was found to be too costly and premature. The program was abandoned after two years, and it was more than a decade before the legislative authority for its graduates to practice was put into place. An alternative program which provided 1,400 hours of training at the community college level prior to commencing employment was then tried, and made mandatory in 1977, with formal certification examinations being introduced in 1978. Similar programs occurred at roughly the same time in Alberta and British Columbia, with other Canadian provinces gradually following, but with their own education and certification requirements. Advanced Care Paramedics were not introduced until 1984, when Toronto trained its first group internally, before the process spread across the country. By 2010 the Ontario system involved a two-year community college based program, including both hospital and field clinical components, prior to designation as a Primary Care Paramedic, although it is starting to head towards a university degree-based program. The province of Ontario announced that by September 2021, the entry level primary care paramedic post-secondary program would be enhanced from a two-year diploma to a three-year advanced diploma in primary care paramedicine. Resultantly, advanced care paramedics in Ontario will require a minimum of four years of post-secondary education and critical care paramedics will require five years of post-secondary education.

====Israel====

In Israel, paramedics are trained in either of the following ways: a three-year degree in Emergency Medicine (B.EMS), a year and three months IDF training, or MADA training. Paramedics manage and provide medical guidelines in mass casualty incidents. They operate in MED evac and ambulances. They are legalized under the 1976 Doctors Ordinance (Decree). In a 2016 study at the Ben Gurion University of the Negev it was found that 73% of trained paramedics stop working within a five-year period, and 93% stop treating within 10 years.

====United Kingdom====

In the United Kingdom, ambulances were originally municipal services after the end of World War II. Training was frequently conducted internally, although national levels of coordination led to more standardization of staff training. Ambulance services were merged into county-level agencies in 1974, and then into regional agencies in 2006. The regional ambulance services, most often trusts, are under the authority of the National Health Service and there is now a significant standardization of training and skills. The UK model has three levels of ambulance staff. In increasing order of clinical skill these are: emergency care assistants, emergency medical technicians, and paramedics.

Today, university qualifications are expected for paramedics, with the current entry level being a Bachelor of Science degree in Pre-Hospital Care or Paramedic Science. As the title &quot;Paramedic&quot; is legally protected, those utilising must be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), and in order to qualify for registration you must meet the standards for registration, which include having a degree obtained through an approved course. The change of entry requirements does not affect currently registered Paramedics, some of whom will still only have their entry qualification, but it is common for Paramedics to continue to progress through &quot;top up&quot; courses, for instance, to work towards a Bachelors of Science degree. This has led to Paramedics holding a wide range of qualifications, with some qualifications (such as master&#x27;s degrees in Advanced or Paramedic Practice) being a pre-requisite for paramedic prescribing.

Paramedics work in various settings including NHS and Independent Ambulance Providers, Air Ambulances, Emergency Departments and other alternative settings. Some paramedics have gone on to become &quot;Paramedic Practitioners&quot;, a role that practices independently in the pre-hospital environment in a capacity similar to that of a nurse practitioner. This is a fully autonomous role, and such senior paramedics are now working in hospitals, community teams such as rapid response teams, and also in increasing numbers in general practice, where their role includes acute presentations, complex chronic care and end of life management. They work as part of the allied health professional team including Doctors, Nurses, physician Associates, Physiotherapists, Associate Physicians, Health Care Assistant and Clinical Pharmacists. Paramedic Practitioners also undertake examinations modelled upon the MRCGP (a combination of applied knowledge exams, clinical skills and work place based assessment) in order to use the title &quot;specialist&quot;. There are also now a growing number of these advanced paramedics who are independent and supplementary prescribers. There are also &#x27;Critical Care Paramedics&#x27; who specialise in acute emergency incidents. In 2018, the UK government changed legislation allowing Paramedics to independently prescribe, which will open new pathways to Paramedics to progress into. This came into force on 1 April 2018, but did not immediately affect practice as guidance was still being written.

====United States====

In the United States, the minimum standards for paramedic training is considered vocational, but many colleges offer paramedic associate degree or bachelor&#x27;s degree options. Paramedic education programs typically follow the U.S. NHTSA EMS Curriculum, DOT or National Registry of EMTs. While many regionally accredited community colleges offer paramedic programs and two-year associate degrees, a handful of universities also offer a four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree component. The national standard course minimum requires didactic and clinical hours for a paramedic program of 1,500 or more hours of classroom training and 500+ clinical hours to be accredited and nationally recognized. Calendar length typically varies from 12 months to upwards of two years, excluding degree options, EMT training, work experience, and prerequisites. It is required to be a certified Emergency Medical Technician prior to starting paramedic training. Entry requirements vary, but many paramedic programs also have prerequisites such as one year required work experience as an emergency medical technician, or anatomy and physiology courses from an accredited college or university. Paramedics in some states must attend up to 50+ hours of ongoing education, plus maintain Pediatric Advanced Life Support and Advanced Cardiac Life Support. National Registry requires 70 + hours to maintain its certification or one may re-certify through completing the written computer based adaptive testing again (between 90 and 120 questions) every two years.

Paramedicine continues to grow and evolve into a formal profession in its own right, complete with its own standards and body of knowledge, and in many locations paramedics have formed their own professional bodies.

The early technicians with limited training, performing a small and specific set of procedures, has become a role beginning to require a foundation degree in countries such as Australia, South Africa, the UK, and increasingly in Canada and parts of the U.S. such as Oregon, where a degree is required for entry level practice.

====Ukraine====
As a part of Emergency Medicine Reform in 2017 Ministry of Healthcare introduced two specialties — &quot;paramedic&quot; and &quot;emergency medical technician&quot;.

== Structure of employment ==
Paramedics are employed by a variety of different organizations, and the services they provide may occur under differing organizational structures, depending on the part of the world. A new and evolving role for paramedics involves the expansion of their practice into the provision of relatively basic primary health care and assessment services.

Some paramedics have begun to specialize their practice, frequently in association with the environment in which they will work. Some early examples of this involved aviation medicine and the use of helicopters, and the transfer of critical care patients between facilities. While some jurisdictions still use physicians, nurses, and technicians for transporting patients, increasingly this role falls to specialized senior and experienced paramedics. Other areas of specialization include such roles as tactical paramedics working in police units, marine paramedics, hazardous materials (Hazmat) teams, Heavy Urban Search and Rescue, and paramedics on offshore oil platforms, oil and mineral exploration teams, and in the military.

The majority of paramedics are employed by the emergency medical service for their area, although this employer could itself be working under a number of models, including a specific autonomous public ambulance service, a fire department, a hospital based service, or a private company working under contract. In Washington, firefighters have been offered free paramedic training. There are also many paramedics who volunteer for backcountry or wilderness rescue teams, and small town rescue squads. In the specific case of an ambulance service being maintained by a fire department, paramedics and EMTs may be required to maintain firefighting and rescue skills as well as medical skills, and vice versa. In some instances, such as Los Angeles County, a fire department may provide emergency medical services, but as a rapid response or rescue unit rather than a transport ambulance.

The provision of municipal ambulance services and paramedics, can vary by area, even within the same country or state. For instance, in Canada, the province of British Columbia operates a province-wide service (the British Columbia Ambulance Service) whereas in Ontario, the service is provided by each municipality, either as a distinct service, linked to the fire service, or contracted out to a third party.

==Scope of practice==
===Common skills===
While there are varying degrees of training and expectations around the world, a set of skills practised by paramedics in the pre-hospital setting commonly includes:

* Advanced cardiac life support, or ACLS, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, defibrillation, cardioversion, transcutaneous pacing, and administration of cardiac drugs
* Patient assessment, including acquisition of vital signs, physical exam, chest auscultation, history taking, electrocardiogram acquisition and interpretation, capnography, pulse oximetry, point-of-care ultrasound and basic blood chemistry interpretation (glucose, lactate)
*Airway management techniques including tracheal intubation, cricothyrotomy, rapid sequence induction, supraglottic airway insertion, manual repositioning, sterile suctioning, use of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airway adjuncts, and manual removal of obstructions via direct laryngoscopy and use of magill forceps
* Thorocostomy and pericardiocentesis to relieve pneumothorax and pericardial tamponade
* Intravenous (IV) and intraosseous (IO) cannulation
* Oxygen administration and positive pressure ventilation via bag-valve-mask, CPAP device, or ventilator
* Fluid resuscitation
* Administration of emergency drugs/medications (see section below)
* Bleeding control and management of shock
* Spinal injury management, including immobilization and safe transport
* Fracture management, including assessment, splinting, and dislocation reduction 
* Obstetrics, including assessment, childbirth, and recognition of and procedures for obstetrical emergencies such as breech presentation, cord presentation, and placental abruption
* Management of burns, including classification, estimate of surface area, recognition of more serious burns, and treatment
* Triage of patients in a mass casualty incident
* Surgical procedures such as field amputation, escharotomy, or thorocotomy (if trained and credentialed)

===Emergency pharmacology===
Paramedics carry and administer a wide array of emergency medications. The specific medications they are permitted to administer vary widely, based on local standards of care and protocols. For an accurate description of permitted drugs or procedures in a given location, it is necessary to contact that jurisdiction directly. A representative list of medications may commonly include:

* Analgesic medications such as aspirin, ketorolac and paracetamol (acetaminophen), used to relieve pain or decrease nausea and vomiting
* Narcotics like morphine, pethidine, fentanyl, and methoxyflurane, used to treat severe pain. 
* Beta and calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem, metoprolol and verapamil used to slow down excessively high heart rates or severe hypertension
* Parasympatholytic drug such as Atropine, also known as anticholinergic drugs, used to speed up slow bradycardic heart rates
* Sympathomimetics such as dopamine, dobutamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine used for cardiac arrest, severe hypotension (low blood pressure), shock and sepsis. These are often known as &quot;vasoactive&quot; agents. 
*Dextrose (often D50W, a solution of 50% dextrose in water), used to treat hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Sedatives like midazolam, lorazepam, etomidate, and ketamine used to reduce the irritability or agitation of patients, to relieve symptoms of seizure, or provide procedural sedation
* Paralytics such as succinylcholine, rocuronium, and vecuronium, used when an emergency procedure such as rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is required
* Antipsychotics like haloperidol or ziprasidone, used to sedate combative patients
* Respiratory medications such as albuterol and ipratropium bromide used to treat conditions such as asthma and acute bronchitis
* Steroids such as hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone used to treat inflammatory respiratory conditions and adrenal crisis
* Cardiac medications such as nitroglycerin and aspirin are used to treat cardiac ailments such as angina and myocardial infarctions
* Diuretic medications such as furosemide to treat congestive heart failure and severe hypertension
* Antiarrhythmics such as amiodarone, adenosine, lidocaine and magnesium sulfate used to treat abnormal heart rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation
* Antiemetics such as promethazine or ondansetron used for nausea and vomiting
* Antidotes for a variety of toxins such as naloxone (opioids), pralidoxime (organophosphates), sodium bicarbonate (tricyclic antidepressants), and hydroxocobalamin (cyanide). 
*Blood products and tranexamic acid in cases of hemorrhagic shock
* Broad spectrum antibiotics such as ceftriaxone or vancomycin for cases of sepsis
* Hormones like oxytocin to control post-partum bleeding

===Skills by certification level===
As described above, many jurisdictions have different levels of paramedic training, leading to variations in what procedures different paramedics may perform depending upon their qualifications. Three common general divisions of paramedic training are the basic technician, general paramedic or advanced technician, and advanced paramedic. Common skills that these three certification levels may practice are summarized in the table below. The skills for the higher levels automatically also assume those listed for lower levels.

==Medicolegal authority==
The medicolegal framework for paramedics is highly dependent on the overall structure of emergency medical services in the territory where they are working.

In many localities, paramedics operate as a direct extension of a physician medical director and practice as an extension of the medical director&#x27;s license. In the United States, a physician delegates authority under an individual state&#x27;s Medical Practice Act. This gives a paramedic the ability to practice within limited scope of practice in law, along with state DOH guidelines and medical control oversight. The authority to practice in this manner is granted in the form of standing orders (protocols) (off-line medical control) and direct physician consultation via phone or radio (on-line medical control). Under this paradigm, paramedics effectively assume the role of out-of-hospital field agents to regional emergency physicians, with independent clinical decision.

In places where paramedics are recognised health care professionals registered with an appropriate body, they can conduct all procedures authorised for their profession, including the administration of prescription medication, and are personally answerable to a regulator. For example, in the United Kingdom, the Health and Care Professions Council regulates paramedics and can censure or strike a paramedic from the register.

In some cases paramedics may gain further qualifications to extend their status to that of a paramedic practitioner or advanced paramedic, which may allow them to administer a wider range of drugs and use a wider range of clinical skills.

In some areas, paramedics are only permitted to practice many advanced skills while assisting a physician who is physically present, except for immediately life-threatening emergencies.

<text>A universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART ) is a peripheral device for asynchronous serial communication in which the data format and transmission speeds are configurable. It sends data bits one by one, from the least significant to the most significant, framed by start and stop bits so that precise timing is handled by the communication channel. The electric signaling levels are handled by a driver circuit external to the UART. Common signal levels are RS-232, RS-485, and raw TTL for short debugging links. Early teletypewriters used current loops.

It was one of the earliest computer communication devices, used to attach teletypewriters for an operator console. It was also an early hardware system for the Internet.

A UART is usually an individual (or part of an) integrated circuit (IC) used for serial communications over a computer or peripheral device serial port. One or more UART peripherals are commonly integrated in microcontroller chips. Specialised UARTs are used for automobiles, smart cards and SIMs.

A related device, the universal synchronous and asynchronous receiver-transmitter (USART), also supports synchronous operation.

In OSI level terms, UART lives on layer 2, the Data link layer.

==History==
Some early telegraph schemes used variable-length pulses (as in Morse code) and rotating clockwork mechanisms to transmit alphabetic characters. The first serial communication devices (with fixed-length pulses) were rotating mechanical switches (&quot;commutators&quot;). Various character codes using 5, 6, 7, or 8 data bits became common in teleprinters and later as computer peripherals. The teletypewriter made an excellent general-purpose I/O device for a small computer.

Gordon Bell of DEC designed the first UART, occupying an entire circuit board called a &quot;line unit&quot;, for the PDP series of computers beginning with the PDP-1.
According to Bell, the main innovation of the UART was its use of sampling to convert the signal into the digital domain, allowing more reliable timing than previous circuits that used analog timing devices with manually adjusted potentiometers. To reduce the cost of wiring, backplane and other components, these computers also pioneered flow control using XON and XOFF characters rather than hardware wires.

DEC condensed the line unit design into an early single-chip UART for their own use. Western Digital developed this into the first widely available single-chip UART, the WD1402A, around 1971. This was an early example of a medium-scale integrated circuit. Another popular chip was the SCN2651 from the Signetics 2650 family.

An example of an early 1980s UART was the National Semiconductor 8250, which was used in the original IBM PC&#x27;s Asynchronous Communications Adapter card. In the 1990s, newer UARTs were developed with on-chip buffers. This allowed higher transmission speed without data loss and without requiring such frequent attention from the computer. For example, the popular National Semiconductor 16550 has a 16-byte FIFO, and spawned many variants, including the &quot;16C550, 16C650, 16C750, and 16C850&quot;.

Depending on the manufacturer, different terms are used to identify devices that perform the UART functions. Intel called their 8251 device a &quot;Programmable Communication Interface&quot; because it was actually a USART and capable of synchronous operation as well as asynchronous. It was introduced in 1979. MOS Technology 6551 was known under the name &quot;Asynchronous Communications Interface Adapter&quot; (ACIA). The term &quot;Serial Communications Interface&quot; (SCI) was first used at Motorola around 1975 to refer to their start-stop asynchronous serial interface device, which others were calling a UART. Zilog manufactured a number of Serial Communication Controllers or SCCs.

Starting in the 2000s, most IBM PC compatible computers removed their external RS-232 COM ports and used USB ports that can send data faster. For users who still need RS-232 serial ports, external USB-to-UART bridges are now commonly used. They combine the hardware cables and a chip to do the USB and UART conversion. Cypress Semiconductor and FTDI are two of the significant commercial suppliers of these chips. Although RS-232 ports are no longer available to users on the outside of most computers, many internal processors have UARTs built into their chips to give hardware designers the ability to interface with other chips or devices that use RS-232 or RS-485 for communication.

==Transmitting and receiving serial data==

A UART contains those following components:

* a clock generator, usually a multiple of the bit rate to allow sampling in the middle of a bit period
* input and output shift registers, along with the transmit/receive or FIFO buffers
* transmit/receive control
* read/write control logic

The universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART) takes bytes of data and transmits the individual bits in a sequential fashion. At the destination, a second UART re-assembles the bits into complete bytes. Each UART contains a shift register, which is the fundamental method of conversion between serial and parallel forms. Serial transmission of digital information (bits) through a single wire or other medium is less costly than parallel transmission through multiple wires.

The UART usually does not directly generate or receive the external signals used between different items of equipment. Separate interface devices are used to convert the logic level signals of the UART to and from the external signaling levels, which may be standardized voltage levels, current levels, or other signals.

Communication may be 3 modes:
* &quot;simplex&quot; (in one direction only, with no provision for the receiving device to send information back to the transmitting device)
* &quot;full duplex&quot; (both devices send and receive at the same time)
* &quot;half duplex&quot; (devices take turns transmitting and receiving)

For UART to work the following settings need to be the same on both the transmitting and receiving side:

* Voltage level
* Baud Rate
* Parity bit 
* Data bits size
* Stop bits size 
* Flow Control

For the voltage level, two UART modules work well when they both have the same voltage level, e.g 3V-3V between the two UART modules. To use two UART modules at different voltage levels, a level shifting circuit needs to be added externally.

=== Data framing ===
A UART frame consists of five elements:

* Idle (logic high (1)) 
* Start bit (logic low (0)): the start bit signals to the receiver that a new character is coming.
* Data bits: the next five to nine bits, depending on the code set employed, represent the character.
* Parity bit: if a parity bit is used, it would be placed after all of the data bits. The parity bit is a way for the receiving UART to tell if any data has changed during transmission.
* Stop (logic high (1)): the next one or two bits are always in the mark (logic high, i.e., 1) condition and called the stop bit(s). They signal to the receiver that the character is complete. Since the start bit is logic low (0) and the stop bit is logic high (1) there are always at least two guaranteed signal changes between characters. If the line is held in the logic low condition for longer than a character time, this is a break condition that can be detected by the UART.

In the most common settings of 8 data bits, no parity and 1 stop bit (i.e. 8N1), the protocol efficiency is 8/10 = 80%. For comparison, Ethernet&#x27;s protocol efficiency when using maximum throughput frames with payload of 1500 bytes is up to 95% and up to 99% with 9000 byte jumbo frames. However due to Ethernet&#x27;s protocol overhead and minimum payload size of 42 bytes, if small messages of one or a few bytes are to be sent, Ethernet&#x27;s protocol efficiency drops much lower than the UART&#x27;s 8N1 constant efficiency of 80%.

The idle, no data state is high-voltage, or powered. This is a historic legacy from telegraphy, in which the line is held high to show that the line and transmitter are not damaged.

Each character is framed as a logic low start bit, data bits, possibly a parity bit and one or more stop bits. In most applications, the least significant data bit (the one on the left in this diagram) is transmitted first, but there are exceptions (such as the IBM 2741 printing terminal).

===Receiver===
All operations of the UART hardware are controlled by an internal clock signal which runs at a multiple of the data rate, typically 8 or 16 times the bit rate. The receiver tests the state of the incoming signal on each clock pulse, looking for the beginning of the start bit. If the apparent start bit lasts at least one-half of the bit time, it is valid and signals the start of a new character. If not, it is considered a spurious pulse and is ignored. After waiting a further bit time, the state of the line is again sampled and the resulting level clocked into a shift register. After the required number of bit periods for the character length (5 to 8 bits, typically) have elapsed, the contents of the shift register are made available (in parallel fashion) to the receiving system. The UART will set a flag indicating new data is available, and may also generate a processor interrupt to request that the host processor transfers the received data.

Communicating UARTs have no shared timing system apart from the communication signal. Typically, UARTs resynchronize their internal clocks on each change of the data line that is not considered a spurious pulse. Obtaining timing information in this manner, they reliably receive when the transmitter is sending at a slightly different speed than it should. Simplistic UARTs do not do this; instead they resynchronize on the falling edge of the start bit only, and then read the center of each expected data bit, and this system works if the broadcast data rate is accurate enough to allow the stop bits to be sampled reliably.

It is a standard feature for a UART to store the most recent character while receiving the next. This &quot;double buffering&quot; gives a receiving computer an entire character transmission time to fetch a received character. Many UARTs have a small first-in, first-out (FIFO) buffer memory between the receiver shift register and the host system interface. This allows the host processor even more time to handle an interrupt from the UART and prevents loss of received data at high rates.

===Transmitter===
Transmission operation is simpler as the timing does not have to be determined from the line state, nor is it bound to any fixed timing intervals. As soon as the sending system deposits a character in the shift register (after completion of the previous character), the UART generates a start bit, shifts the required number of data bits out to the line, generates and sends the parity bit (if used), and sends the stop bits. Since full-duplex operation requires characters to be sent and received at the same time, UARTs use two different shift registers for transmitted and received characters. High performance UARTs could contain a transmit FIFO (first in first out) buffer to allow a CPU or DMA controller to deposit multiple characters in a burst into the FIFO rather than have to deposit one character at a time into the shift register. Since transmission of a single or multiple characters may take a long time relative to CPU speeds, a UART maintains a flag showing busy status so that the host system knows if there is at least one character in the transmit buffer or shift register; &quot;ready for next character(s)&quot; may also be signaled with an interrupt.

===Application===
Transmitting and receiving UARTs must be set for the same bit speed (Baud rate), character length, parity, and number of stop bits for proper operation. The receiving UART may detect some mismatched settings and set a &quot;framing error&quot; flag bit for the host system; in exceptional cases, the receiving UART will produce an erratic stream of mutilated characters and transfer them to the host system.

Typical serial ports used with personal computers connected to modems use one start bit, eight data bits, no parity, and one stop bit; for this configuration, the number of ASCII characters per second equals the bit rate divided by 10.

Some very low-cost home computers or embedded systems that lack a physical UART may instead emulate the protocol with software by sampling the state of an input port or directly manipulating an output port for data transmission. While very CPU-intensive (since the CPU timing is critical), the UART chip can thus be omitted, saving money and space. The technique is known as bit-banging.

== Models ==
A dual UART, or &quot;DUART&quot;, combines two UARTs into a single chip. Similarly, a quadruple UART or &quot;QUART&quot;, combines four UARTs into one package, such as the NXP 28L194. An octal UART or &quot;OCTART&quot; combines eight UARTs into one package, such as the Exar XR16L788 or the NXP SCC2698.
== Uses ==

Modems for personal computers that plug into a motherboard slot must also include the UART function on the card. The original 8250 UART chip shipped with the IBM personal computer had a one-character buffer for the receiver and the transmitter each, which meant that communications software performed poorly at speeds above , especially if operating under a multitasking system or if handling interrupts from disk controllers. High-speed modems used UARTs that were compatible with the original chip but which included additional FIFO buffers, giving software additional time to respond to incoming data.

A look at the performance requirements at high bit rates shows why the 16-, 32-, 64- or 128-byte FIFO is a necessity. The Microsoft specification for a DOS system requires that interrupts not be disabled for more than 1 millisecond at a time. Some hard disk drives and video controllers violate this specification. will deliver a character approximately every millisecond, so a 1-byte FIFO should be sufficient at this rate on a DOS system which meets the maximum interrupt disable timing. Rates above this may receive a new character before the old one has been fetched, and thus the old character will be lost. This is referred to as an overrun error and results in one or more lost characters.

A 16-byte FIFO allows up to 16 characters to be received before the computer has to service the interrupt. This increases the maximum bit rate the computer can process reliably from 9600 to if it has a 1 millisecond interrupt dead time. A 32-byte FIFO increases the maximum rate to over . A second benefit to having a FIFO is that the computer only has to service about 8 to 12% as many interrupts, allowing more CPU time for updating the screen, or doing other chores. Thus the computer&#x27;s responses will improve as well.

==Emulation==

Since the UART&#x27;s communication protocol is simple, it can be emulated by bit banging GPIO pins in software on modern microcontrollers (e.g. Arduino or Teensy), or on programmable I/O state machines (e.g. Raspberry Pi Pico&#x27;s PIO or NXP&#x27;s FlexIO).

<text>Karl Eduard Zachariae von Lingenthal (December 24, 1812 – June 3, 1894) was a German jurist and the son of Karl Salomo Zachariae von Lingenthal.
==Life==
He studied philosophy, history, mathematics and linguistics, as well as jurisprudence, at Leipzig, Berlin and Heidelberg.

Having made Roman and Byzantine law his special study, he visited Paris in 1832 to examine Byzantine manuscripts, then went in 1834 to Saint Petersburg and Copenhagen for the same purpose, and in 1835 worked in the libraries of Brussels, London, Oxford, Dublin, Edinburgh and Cambridge.

After a few months as a practising lawyer and &quot;privatdozent&quot; at Heidelberg, he went in 1837, in search of materials, to Italy and the East, visiting Athens, Constantinople and the monasteries of Mount Athos.

Having a taste for a country life, and none for teaching, he gave up his position as extraordinary professor at Heidelberg, and in 1845 bought an estate in the Prussian province of Saxony. Here he lived, engaged in scientific agriculture and interested in Prussian politics, until his death.

<text>Zagazig (, , ) is a city in Egypt. Situated in the eastern part of the Nile delta, it is the capital of the governorate of Sharqia.

It is located on the Muweis Canal and is a hub of the corn and cotton trade. There is a museum, the Museum of Tal Basta Antiquities, that contains many important archaeological exhibits.

Zagazig University, one of the largest universities in Egypt, is also located in the city, with colleges in different fields of science and arts. The Archaeological Museum of the University of Zagazig exhibits significant finds from the nearby sites, Bubastis (Tell Basta) and Kufur Nigm. 

Zagazig is the birthplace of famous Coptic Egyptian journalist, philosopher and social critic, Salama Moussa, and famous Egyptian songwriter Morsi Gameel Aziz.

The most notable streets in Zagazig are Farouk Street, Government Street, Abu Hamad and El Kawmia Street.

==History==
The city was founded in the 19th century on the site of a village called &quot;Nazlat az-Zaqāzīq&quot; which was named after the Zaqzuq family. The family&#x27;s name itself comes from a dialectal word &quot;zaqzuq&quot; or &quot;ziqziq&quot; which means &quot;a small creature&quot; (e.g. a fish or a mouse) and comes from a Coptic word ϫⲉⲕϫⲓⲕ &quot;ant or other insect&quot;.

The ruins of the ancient Egyptian city of Bubastis are located southeast of town. Bubastis was the ancient capital of the 18th nome, and is home to the feast celebrating the cat goddess Bastet.

Bubastis is the Greek version of the Egyptian language name &quot;Pr-Bastet&quot; &quot;House [Temple] of Bastet&quot;. Bubastis became the capital of Egypt in the 22nd and 23rd Dynasties. There are remains of the temples built by Osorkon II and Nectanebo II. Catacombs where the sacred cats were buried are located behind the remains of an Old Kingdom chapel from the period of Pepi I Meryre.

<doc id="75018" wikidata="Q247331" url="?curid=75018" title="House of Zähringen">
<text>The House of Zähringen () was a dynasty of Swabian nobility. The family&#x27;s name derived from Zähringen Castle near Freiburg im Breisgau. The Zähringer in the 12th century used the title of Duke of Zähringen, in compensation for having conceded the title of Duke of Swabia to the Staufer in 1098. The Zähringer were granted the special title of Rector of Burgundy in 1127, and they continued to use both titles until the extinction of the ducal line in 1218.

The territories and fiefs held by the Zähringer were known as the Duchy of Zähringen (German: ), but it was not seen as a duchy in equal standing with the old stem duchies. The Zähringer attempted to expand their territories in Swabia and Burgundy into a fully recognized duchy, but their expansion was halted in the 1130s due to their feud with the Welfs. Pursuing their territorial ambitions, the Zähringer founded numerous cities and monasteries on either side of the Black Forest, as well as in the western Swiss Plateau. After the extinction of the ducal line in 1218, parts of the family&#x27;s territories reverted to the crown (attained imperial immediacy), while other parts were divided between the houses of Kyburg, Urach and Fürstenberg.

==History==

The earliest-known ancestor of the family was one Berthold, Count in the Breisgau (d. 982), who was first mentioned in 962. In view of his name, he may have been related to the Alemannic Ahalolfing dynasty.

Count Berthold&#x27;s great-grandson, the later Berthold II, Duke of Carinthia (posthumously known as Berthold I of Zähringen, c. 1000–1078), held several lordships (&quot;Herrschaften&quot;) in the Breisgau, in Thurgau, Ortenau and Baar. By his mother, he was related to the rising Hohenstaufen family. Emperor Henry III had promised his vassal Berthold the Duchy of Swabia, but this was not fulfilled, as upon Henry&#x27;s death, his widow Agnes of Poitou appointed Count Rudolf of Rheinfelden to the position of Duke of Swabia in 1057. In compensation, Berthold was made Duke of Carinthia and Margrave of Verona in 1061. However, this dignity was only a titular one, and Berthold subsequently lost it when, in the course of the Investiture Controversy, he joined the rising of his former rival Rudolf of Rheinfelden against German king Henry IV in 1073.

Berthold&#x27;s son Berthold II (c. 1050–1111), who like his father fought against Henry IV, inherited a lot of the lands of Rudolf&#x27;s son Count Berthold of Rheinfelden in 1090 (though not his comital title, which stayed with the family von Wetter-Rheinfelden). Berthold II is so named both as Duke of Swabia (following Berthold of Rheinfelden, the first duke of Swabia of this name) and as head of the House of Zähringen (following his father, who is counted as Berthold I of Zähringen in spite of not historically having used the name Zähringen). Berthold II did use the name Zähringen, although he moved his main residence from Zähringen Castle to the newly built Freiburg Castle in 1091.

In 1092, Berthold II was elected Duke of Swabia against Frederick I of Hohenstaufen. In 1098, he reconciled with Frederick, renounced all claims to Swabia and instead concentrated on his possessions in the Breisgau region, assuming the title of Duke of Zähringen. He was succeeded in turn by his sons, Berthold III (d. 1122) and Conrad (d. 1152).

In 1127, upon the assassination of his nephew Count William III, Conrad claimed the inheritance of the County of Burgundy against Count Renaud III of Mâcon. Renaud prevailed, although he had to cede large parts of the eastern Transjuranian lands to Conrad, who thereupon was appointed by Emperor Lothair III as a &#x27;rector&#x27; of the Imperial Kingdom of Burgundy-Arles. This office was confirmed in 1152 and held by the Zähringer dukes until 1218. As a result, they are sometimes referred to as &#x27;Dukes of Burgundy&#x27;, although the existing Duchy of Burgundy was not an Imperial fief but a French one. Duke Berthold IV (d. 1186), who followed his father Conrad and founded the Swiss city of Fryburg (today&#x27;s Fribourg-Freiburg) in 1157, spent much of his time in Italy in the train of Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa.

His son and successor, Berthold V, showed his prowess by reducing the Burgundian nobles to order. This latter duke was the founder of the city of Bern in 1191, and when he died in February 1218, the ducal line of the Zähringer became extinct. Among other titles, the Zähringen family acted as &quot;Reichsvogt&quot; of the Zürichgau area.

After the extinction of the ducal line in 1218, much of its extensive territory in the Breisgau and modern-day Switzerland returned to the crown, except for the allodial titles, which were divided between the counts of Urach (who subsequently called themselves the counts of Freiburg) and the counts of Kyburg, both descended from the sisters of Berthold V. Less than fifty years later, the Kyburgs died out, and large portions of their domains were inherited by the House of Habsburg. Bern achieved the status of a free imperial city, whereas other cities (such as Fribourg-Freiburg) only obtained the same status later in history.

==Possessions and territories==

Berthold I (ancestor of both the House of Zähringen and the House of Baden) held the comital titles of Breisgau and Thurgau, as well as being reeve in Stein am Rhein (owned by the bishop of Bamberg). The county of Thurgau was lost around 1077.

In 1098, Berthold II, founder of the House of Zähringen proper, received Zähringen Castle and the jurisdiction over Zürich (alongside the Counts of Lenzburg until 1173). Ownership of the county of Rheinfelden and of Burgdorf also dates to c. 1198.

The &#x27;rectorate&#x27; of the county of Burgundy was granted in 1127 (inheritance of Otto-William, Count of Burgundy). Ownership of Burgundy was contested, and Zähringer &quot;de facto&quot; rule was limited to the parts of Upper Burgundy east of the Jura and north of Lake Geneva. The territories south of Lake Geneva were conceded to Savoy and Provence in 1156. In compensation, Berthold IV received the investiture right for the bishops of Geneva, Sion and Lausanne, &quot;de facto&quot; realised only in the case of Lausanne.

The extinction of the counts of Lenzburg in 1173 strengthened the Zähringer position south of the Rhine, but their territorial expansion was halted following their support of the Welfs in the unsuccessful feud against Conrad III of Germany during 1138–1152. This frustrated their ambitions to carve out a contiguous territorial duchy wedged between Swabia and Burgundy, in spite of late attempts on the part of Berthold V to increase his territorial sway (who as late as 1210 aimed at receiving the jurisdiction over St. Gallen).

Instead of territorial expansion, the dukes of Zähringen from the 1150s focused on attaining more immediate feudal control over the territories they already had. This included their policy of expanding settlements into fortified towns or cities and the construction of new castles, mostly in their territories north of the Rhine. Their encroachment on the rights of the comital nobility south of the Rhine seems to have been resisted, mostly passively, but in the case of the lords of Glâne and Thun in an open revolt in 1191.

The fragmentation of the Zähringer possessions after 1218 was an important factor in the communal movements of the late medieval period in the region, including the imperial immediacy of Bern and Zürich, and the growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy in the early 14th century.

===Cities===
Among the cities founded or expanded by the Zähringer dukes () are:
*in Swabia, west of the Black Forest (Baden): Freiburg im Breisgau (1120), Offenburg (before 1148), Neuenburg am Rhein (1175);
*in Swabia, east of the Black Forest (Württemberg): Sankt Peter (1093), Villingen (1119), Bräunlingen (c. 1200), Weilheim an der Teck (Limburg castle c. 1060);
*in Burgundy (western Swiss plateau):
**on the Rhine: Rheinfelden (c. 1150);
**Aare basin: Fribourg (Freiburg im Üechtland, 1157) Bern (1191), Burgdorf (castle before 1175), Murten (c. 1180), Thun (c. 1190).

Other towns owned by or under the jurisdiction (Reichsvogtei) of the Zähringer include: Solothurn (acquired 1127), Zürich (acquired 1173), Schaffhausen (acquired 1198) and Stein am Rhein.

The city of Morges on Lake Geneva is not a Zähringer foundation (having been founded in 1286 by Louis I of Vaud) but shared the characteristic layout of the Zähringer cities.

==Genealogy==
===House of Zähringen===
Berthold II, Duke of Carinthia, Margrave of Verona (c. 1000–1078, r. 1061–1077), is also known as &quot;Berthold I of Zähringen&quot;. Therefore, the succession of dukes of Zähringen begins with his son as Berthold II:

Dukes of Zähringen:
*Berthold II (c. 1050–1111), Duke of Swabia from 1092 to 1098 (against Frederick I of Hohenstaufen), then Duke of Zähringen from about 1100. The numeral II carried by Berthold refers to both the House of Zähringen (succeeding his father Berthold I) and the Duchy of Swabia (succeeding Berthold I, Duke of Swabia of the House of Rheinfelden).
*Berthold III (c. 1085–1122), son, Duke of Zähringen from 1111
*Conrad I (c. 1090–1152), brother, Duke of Zähringen from 1122, rector of Burgundy from 1127
*Berthold IV (c. 1125–1186), son, Duke of Zähringen from 1152, rector of Burgundy
*Berthold V (1160–1218), son, Duke of Zähringen from 1186, rector of Burgundy

Other notable Zähringer:
*Gebhard of Zähringen (d. 1110), son of Berthold I, became Bishop of Constance
*Clementia of Zähringen (d. 1175), daughter of Conrad I, married Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony in 1147
*Rudolf of Zähringen (d. 1191), son of Conrad I, became Archbishop of Mainz and Bishop of Liège

=== House of Baden ===

The Veronese margravial title was used by Herman I of Baden, the eldest son of Berthold I of Zähringen. Herman&#x27;s son, Herman II, was the first to use the title of Margrave of Baden in 1112.

Now more commonly known as the House of Baden, Herman&#x27;s descendants ruled successively as margraves until the Final Recess of 1803, as electors of the Electorate of Baden until 1806, then as Grand Dukes of Baden until the end of the German monarchy in 1918. For the Heads of the House of Baden until 1918, see List of rulers of Baden.

Heads of the House of Baden since 1918:

* &quot;Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden&quot;
** &quot;Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden&quot;
*** Friedrich II, Grand Duke 1907–1928 (1857–1928)
** &quot;Prince William of Baden (1829–1897)&quot;
*** Maximilian, Prince and Margrave, 1928–1929 (1867–1929)
**** Berthold, 1929–1963 (1906–1963)
***** Maximilian, 1963–2022 (1933–2022)
****** Bernhard, 2022–present (born 1970)
******* (1) Leopold, (born 2002)
******* (2) Friedrich (born 2004)
******* (3) Karl-Wilhelm (born 2006)
****** (4) Leopold (born 1971)
****** (5) Michael (born 1976)
***** (6) Ludwig (born 1937)
****** (7) Berthold (born 1976)
=== Dukes of Teck ===
Adalbert I (d. 1196) was a son of Duke Conrad I of Zähringen. Upon the death of his brother Berthold IV in 1186, he inherited the family estates around Teck Castle and, from 1187, adopted the title of Duke of Teck. His descendant Conrad II of Teck (1235–1292) allegedly was designated King of the Romans shortly before his assassination. The line became extinct in 1439 with the death of Louis of Teck, Patriarch of Aquileia.

In 1871, a ducal title with the same name was granted by King Charles I of Württemberg to Prince Francis of Teck (1837–1900), a morganatic son of Duke Alexander of Württemberg. Francis&#x27; daughter Mary of Teck (1867–1953), as the wife of King George V, became Queen of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Empress of India.

Francis&#x27;s surviving children ceased using their German titles during World War I and (aside from Queen Mary) took the name Cambridge, with his eldest son (Adolphus) being made Marquess of Cambridge and his youngest son (Alexander) being made Earl of Athlone. This branch of the family died out in the male line in 1981 and in its entirety in 1994 with the death of Francis&#x27;s granddaughter, Lady Mary Abel Smith.

<text>Kaj Tapio Rautavaara (8 March 1915 – 25 September 1979) was a Finnish singer (bass-baritone), athlete and film actor.

== Life ==
===Early years===
Tapio Rautavaara was born in the municipality of Pirkkala (now Nokia), a suburb of the industrial city of Tampere, as the son of Henrik Kerttula and Hilda Rautavaara. Just three weeks later, his mother moved to the Helsinki suburb of Oulunkylä, where she had lived before. Rautavaara&#x27;s father was rarely at home, and soon left the family permanently. In 1921, Tapio and his mother moved to Tampere. Rautavaara used to have conflicts with his conservative teachers due to his working-class background. Tapio earned pocket money by selling socialist papers for local workers of the Finlayson textile factory. Four years later, the family returned Oulunkylä, where Rautavaara lived the rest of his life.

In the late 1920s, Rautavaara joined the local working-class sports club Oulunkylän Tähti (″Oulunkylä Star″) for practicing athletics. Rautavaara&#x27;s formal education ended at the elementary level. By the outbreak of the Finnish Winter War in 1939, he had worked as a newspaper boy, roadworker, lumberjack and as a storeman at a co-operative mill. His national military service was with the Finnish Navy in the mid 1930s.

===War time===
When the Winter War broke out the Navy was not very active in the war and Rautavaara was allowed to continue working at the Osuustukkukauppa (OTK) mill. However, when the Continuation War broke out he was called to the army and he was assigned to the front line for the first year of the war. In the summer of 1942, Rautavaara was transferred to the war entertainment corps and worked for two years as a radio journalist in the frontier based Aunus Radio. During this time he became a known figure to the serving troops. In the summer of 1944 the Finns had to pull out from East Karelia and Rautavaara&#x27;s radio career ended.

===Sports career===
Rautavaara was a talented javelin thrower and archer. In 1937, he represented the Finnish Workers&#x27; Sports Federation at the Workers&#x27; Olympiads in Antwerp, finishing second in the javelin throw after his countrymen Erkki Autonen. After the World War II, Rautavaara won a European bronze medal in 1946, an Olympic gold medal in 1948, and five national titles in 1944–45, and 1947–49. He placed fifth at the 1950 European Championships. In archery Rautavaara won a team gold medal at the 1958 World Championships and a national title in 1955.

===Music and acting career===
After the war Rautavaara met Reino Helismaa, who composed and made the lyrics to &quot;Reissumies ja kissa&quot; (The Traveler and the Cat), which became Rautavaara&#x27;s first hit. Composer Toivo Kärki joined this team, which produced over the next ten years many popular songs. In addition, Rautavaara composed and wrote the lyrics for many of his records. Rautavaara received gold records for the songs &quot;Isoisän olkihattu&quot; (Grandpa&#x27;s Strawhat), &quot;Vain merimies voi tietää&quot; (Only a Sailor Could Know) and &quot;Häävalssi&quot; (The Wedding Waltz). The first song was written and composed by Rautavaara, the second one was composed by him and the lyrics were written by Heikki Saari.

Rautavaara, Helismaa and Esa Pakarinen toured Finland together at the end of the 1940s and the beginning of the 1950s. The touring stopped due to personal problems, but Rautavaara continued to record songs with Helismaa&#x27;s lyrics until Helismaa&#x27;s death in 1965. By the time of his death in 1979 Rautavaara had recorded about 300 songs.

Rautavaara became one of the most beloved singers in Finland. Some of his famous songs include &quot;Isoisän olkihattu&quot; (Grandfather&#x27;s Straw Hat), &quot;Reppu ja reissumies&quot; (The Backpack and the Traveler), &quot;Korttipakka&quot; (The Deck of Cards), &quot;Lapin jenkka&quot; (The Lappland Schottische), &quot;Juokse sinä humma&quot; (Run, Horse, Run), &quot;Kulkuri ja joutsen&quot; (The Tramp and the Swan), &quot;Tuopin jäljet&quot; (Marks of the Tankard), &quot;Sininen uni&quot; (Blue Dream) and &quot;Anttilan keväthuumaus&quot; (Anttila&#x27;s Spring Fever).

Rautavaara was cast as the protagonist in numerous Finnish films, and was also supposedly a candidate for the part of Tarzan after Johnny Weissmuller had quit his career.

=== Later years ===
The peak of Rautavaara&#x27;s popularity was in the 1950s, stretching into the early years of the 1960s. After that, his music was left in the shadow of rautalanka and tango music and the popularity of the television. He continued to perform regularly, however, right up until his death, even though his gigs in the 1970s were for smaller audiences, such as in department stores and topping out ceremonies.

==Death and tributes==
On 25 September 1979 Tapio Rautavaara had been at the Tikkurila Swimming Center in Vantaa taking photographs for the book &quot;Kultaa, kunniaa, kyyneleitä&quot; (Finnish for &quot;Gold, glory, tears&quot;) along with photographer Pentti Pekkala. After he had gone to the sauna, Rautavaara slipped and hit his head on the floor. He was taken to a nearby health center, where his injuries were not taken seriously, as staff believed him to be drunk. His head was bandaged and he was sent home. His wife and daughters laid him on a mattress on the floor of his office room at his home in Oulunkylä to sleep. The next night, he died as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage. His wife told their daughter that he had gone. When the daughter asked where to, her mother replied &quot;No, he&#x27;s dead.&quot;

Rautavaara was buried in the Malmi Cemetery in Malmi, Helsinki.

===Memorial===
A memorial by Veikko Myller entitled &quot;Kulkurin uni&quot; (&quot;A Vagabond&#x27;s Dream&quot;) to the memory of Rautavaara is located in the market square in central Oulunkylä, the district of Helsinki, where Rautavaara lived most of his life.

===TV documentary and film===
Peter von Bagh created a TV documentary on Rautavaara entitled &quot;Tapsa&quot; at the time of Rautavaara&#x27;s death in 1979. Timo Koivusalo used Rautavaara&#x27;s and Helismaa&#x27;s tours as the basis for his film &quot;Kulkuri ja joutsen&quot; in 1999.

===Play===
In spring 2007 the Nokia Workers&#x27; theatre presented a play entitled &quot;Sininen uni&quot; (The Blue Dream), which was based on his life.

==Rautavaara&#x27;s influence on later groups==
Ville Valo, the frontman of the Finnish rock band HIM, regards Rautavaara as his greatest idol in Finnish music.

<doc id="75022" wikidata="Q216158" url="?curid=75022" title="Expansion card">
<text>In computing, an expansion card (also called an expansion board, adapter card, peripheral card or accessory card) is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an electrical connector, or expansion slot (also referred to as a bus slot) on a computer&#x27;s motherboard (see also backplane) to add functionality to a computer system. Sometimes the design of the computer&#x27;s case and motherboard involves placing most (or all) of these slots onto a separate, removable card. Typically such cards are referred to as a riser card in part because they project upward from the board and allow expansion cards to be placed above and parallel to the motherboard.

Expansion cards allow the capabilities and interfaces of a computer system to be extended or supplemented in a way appropriate to the tasks it will perform. For example, a high-speed multi-channel data acquisition system would be of no use in a personal computer used for bookkeeping, but might be a key part of a system used for industrial process control. Expansion cards can often be installed or removed in the field, allowing a degree of user customization for particular purposes. Some expansion cards take the form of &quot;daughterboards&quot; that plug into connectors on a supporting system board.

In personal computing, notable expansion buses and expansion card standards include the S-100 bus from 1974 associated with the CP/M operating system, the 50-pin expansion slots of the original Apple II computer from 1977 (unique to Apple), IBM&#x27;s Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) introduced with the IBM PC in 1981, Acorn&#x27;s tube expansion bus on the BBC Micro also from 1981, IBM&#x27;s patented and proprietary Micro Channel architecture (MCA) from 1987 that never won favour in the clone market, the vastly improved Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) that displaced ISA in 1992, and PCI Express from 2003 which abstracts the interconnect into high-speed communication &quot;lanes&quot; and relegates all other functions into software protocol.

==History==
Vacuum-tube based computers had modular construction, but individual functions for peripheral devices filled a cabinet, not just a printed circuit board. Processor, memory and I/O cards became feasible with the development of integrated circuits. Expansion cards make processor systems adaptable to the needs of the user by making it possible to connect various types of devices, including I/O, additional memory, and optional features (such as a floating point unit) to the central processor. Minicomputers, starting with the PDP-8, were made of multiple cards communicating through, and powered by, a passive backplane.

The first commercial microcomputer to feature expansion slots was the Micral N, in 1973. The first company to establish a &quot;de facto&quot; standard was Altair with the Altair 8800, developed 1974–1975, which later became a multi-manufacturer standard, the S-100 bus. Many of these computers were also passive backplane designs, where all elements of the computer, (processor, memory, and I/O) plugged into a card cage which passively distributed signals and power between the cards.

Proprietary bus implementations for systems such as the Apple II co-existed with multi-manufacturer standards.

===IBM PC and descendants===
IBM introduced what would retroactively be called the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus with the IBM PC in 1981. At that time, the technology was called the PC bus. The IBM XT, introduced in 1983, used the same bus (with slight exception). The 8-bit PC and XT bus was extended with the introduction of the IBM AT in 1984. This used a second connector for extending the address and data bus over the XT, but was backward compatible; 8-bit cards were still usable in the AT 16-bit slots. Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) became the designation for the IBM AT bus after other types were developed. Users of the ISA bus had to have in-depth knowledge of the hardware they were adding to properly connect the devices, since memory addresses, I/O port addresses, and DMA channels had to be configured by switches or jumpers on the card to match the settings in driver software.

IBM&#x27;s MCA bus, developed for the PS/2 in 1987, was a competitor to ISA, also their design, but fell out of favor due to the ISA&#x27;s industry-wide acceptance and IBM&#x27;s licensing of MCA. EISA, the 32-bit extended version of ISA championed by Compaq, was used on some PC motherboards until 1997, when Microsoft declared it a &quot;legacy&quot; subsystem in the PC 97 industry white-paper. Proprietary local buses (q.v. Compaq) and then the VESA Local Bus Standard, were late 1980s expansion buses that were tied but not exclusive to the 80386 and 80486 CPU bus. The PC/104 bus is an bus that copies the ISA bus.

Intel launched their PCI bus chipsets along with the P5-based Pentium CPUs in 1993. The PCI bus was introduced in 1991 as a replacement for ISA. The standard (now at version 3.0) is found on PC motherboards to this day. The PCI standard supports bus bridging: as many as ten daisy-chained PCI buses have been tested. CardBus, using the PCMCIA connector, is a PCI format that attaches peripherals to the Host PCI Bus via PCI to PCI Bridge. Cardbus is being supplanted by ExpressCard format.

Intel introduced the AGP bus in 1997 as a dedicated video acceleration solution. AGP devices are logically attached to the PCI bus over a PCI-to-PCI bridge. Though termed a bus, AGP usually supports only a single card at a time (Legacy BIOS support issues). From 2005 PCI Express has been replacing both PCI and AGP. This standard, approved in 2004, implements the logical PCI protocol over a serial communication interface. PC/104(-Plus) or Mini PCI are often added for expansion on small form factor boards such as Mini-ITX.

For their 1000 EX and 1000 HX models, Tandy Computer designed the PLUS expansion interface, an adaptation of the XT-bus supporting cards of a smaller form factor. Because it is electrically compatible with the XT bus (a.k.a. 8-bit ISA or XT-ISA), a passive adapter can be made to connect XT cards to a PLUS expansion connector. Another feature of PLUS cards is that they are stackable. Another bus that offered stackable expansion modules was the &quot;sidecar&quot; bus used by the IBM PCjr. This may have been electrically comparable to the XT bus; it most certainly had some similarities since both essentially exposed the 8088 CPU&#x27;s address and data buses, with some buffering and latching, the addition of interrupts and DMA provided by Intel add-on chips, and a few system fault detection lines (Power Good, Memory Check, I/O Channel Check). Again, PCjr sidecars are not technically expansion cards, but expansion modules, with the only difference being that the sidecar is an expansion card enclosed in a plastic box (with holes exposing the connectors).

===External expansion buses===
Laptops are generally unable to accept most expansion cards intended for desktop computers. Consequently, several compact expansion standards were developed. 

The original PC Card expansion card standard is essentially a compact version of the ISA bus. The CardBus expansion card standard is an evolution of the PC card standard to make it into a compact version of the PCI bus. The original ExpressCard standard acts like it is either a USB 2.0 peripheral or a PCI Express 1.x x1 device. ExpressCard 2.0 adds SuperSpeed USB as another type of interface the card can use. Unfortunately, CardBus and ExpressCard are vulnerable to DMA attack unless the laptop has an IOMMU that is configured to thwart these attacks.

One notable exception to the above is the inclusion of a single internal slot for a special reduced size version of the desktop standard. The most well known examples are Mini-PCI or Mini PCIe. Such slots were usually intended for a specific purpose such as offering &quot;built-in&quot; wireless networking or upgrading the system at production with a discrete GPU.

===Other families===
Most other computer lines, including those from Apple Inc., Tandy, Commodore, Amiga, and Atari, Inc., offered their own expansion buses. The Amiga used Zorro II. Apple used a proprietary system with seven 50-pin-slots for Apple II peripheral cards, then later used both variations on Processor Direct Slot and NuBus for its Macintosh series until 1995, when they switched to a PCI Bus.

Generally speaking, most PCI expansion cards will function on any CPU platform which incorporates PCI bus hardware provided there is a software driver for that type. PCI video cards and any other cards that contain their own BIOS or other ROM are problematic, although video cards conforming to VESA Standards may be used for secondary monitors. DEC Alpha, IBM PowerPC, and NEC MIPS workstations used PCI bus connectors. Both Zorro II and NuBus were plug and play, requiring no hardware configuration by the user.

Other computer buses were used for industrial control, instruments, and scientific systems. One specific example is HP-IB (or Hewlett Packard Interface Bus) which was ultimately standardized as IEEE-488 (aka GPIB). Some well-known historical standards include VMEbus, STD Bus, SBus (specific to Sun&#x27;s SPARCStations), and numerous others.

===Video game consoles===

Many other video game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis included expansion buses in some form; In the case of at least the Genesis, the expansion bus was proprietary. In fact, the cartridge slots of many cartridge-based consoles (not counting the Atari 2600) would qualify as expansion buses, as they exposed both read and write capabilities of the system&#x27;s internal bus. However, the expansion modules attached to these interfaces, though functionally the same as expansion cards, are not technically expansion cards, due to their physical form.

==Applications==
The primary purpose of an expansion card is to provide or expand on features not offered by the motherboard. For example, the original IBM PC did not have on-board graphics or hard drive capability. In that case, a graphics card and an ST-506 hard disk controller card provided graphics capability and hard drive interface respectively. Some single-board computers made no provision for expansion cards, and may only have provided IC sockets on the board for limited changes or customization. Since reliable multi-pin connectors are relatively costly, some mass-market systems such as home computers had no expansion slots and instead used a card-edge connector at the edge of the main board, putting the costly matching socket into the cost of the peripheral device.

In the case of expansion of on-board capability, a motherboard may provide a single serial RS232 port or Ethernet port. An expansion card can be installed to offer multiple RS232 ports or multiple and higher bandwidth Ethernet ports. In this case, the motherboard provides basic functionality but the expansion card offers additional or enhanced ports.

==Physical construction==
One edge of the expansion card holds the contacts (the edge connector or pin header) that fit into the slot. They establish the electrical contact between the electronics on the card and on the motherboard. Peripheral expansion cards generally have connectors for external cables. In the PC-compatible personal computer, these connectors were located in the support bracket at the back of the cabinet. Industrial backplane systems had connectors mounted on the top edge of the card, opposite to the backplane pins.

Depending on the form factor of the motherboard and case, around one to seven expansion cards can be added to a computer system. 19 or more expansion cards can be installed in backplane systems. When many expansion cards are added to a system, total power consumption and heat dissipation become limiting factors. Some expansion cards take up more than one slot space. For example, many graphics cards on the market as of 2010 are dual slot graphics cards, using the second slot as a place to put an active heat sink with a fan.

Some cards are &quot;low-profile&quot; cards, meaning that they are shorter than standard cards and will fit in a lower height computer chassis such as HTPC and SFF. (There is a &quot;low profile PCI card&quot; standard that specifies a much smaller bracket and board area). The group of expansion cards that are used for external connectivity, such as network, SAN or modem cards, are commonly referred to as input/output cards (or I/O cards).

==Daughterboard==

A daughterboard, daughtercard, mezzanine board or piggyback board is an expansion card that attaches to a system directly. Daughterboards often have plugs, sockets, pins or other attachments for other boards. Daughterboards often have only internal connections within a computer or other electronic devices, and usually access the motherboard directly rather than through a computer bus. Such boards are used to either improve various memory capacities of a computer, enable the computer to connect to certain kinds of networks that it previously could not connect to, or to allow for users to customize their computers for various purposes such as gaming. 

Daughterboards are sometimes used in computers in order to allow for expansion cards to fit parallel to the motherboard, usually to maintain a small form factor. This form are also called riser cards, or risers. Daughterboards are also sometimes used to expand the basic functionality of an electronic device, such as when a certain model has features added to it and is released as a new or separate model. Rather than redesigning the first model completely, a daughterboard may be added to a special connector on the main board. These usually fit on top of and parallel to the board, separated by spacers or standoffs, and are sometimes called mezzanine cards due to being stacked like the mezzanine of a theatre. Wavetable cards (sample-based synthesis cards) are often on sound cards in this manner.
Some mezzanine card interface standards include
the 400 pin FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC);
the 172 pin High-Speed Mezzanine Card (HSMC);
the PCI Mezzanine Card (PMC);
XMC mezzanines;
the Advanced Mezzanine Card;
IndustryPacks (VITA 4), the GreenSpring Computers Mezzanine modules;
etc.

<text>Scrappy-Doo is a fictional character in the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; franchise. A Great Dane and the nephew of Scooby-Doo, he was created by Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1979 and appeared in various incarnations of the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; cartoon series. Lennie Weinrib provided his voice for one season in 1979, and from 1980 on it was performed by Don Messick (who also voiced Scooby). In the first live-action theatrical film, video games, and commercials, he was voiced by Scott Innes, and portrayed by Rowan Atkinson when disguised as Mondavarious.

He was created in order to save the show&#x27;s ratings, which by 1979 had begun to sink to the point of cancellation threats from ABC—which was considering choosing between Scooby-Doo and an unnamed pilot from Ruby-Spears Enterprises which Mark Evanier had also written.

==History==

===Hanna-Barbera===
====Precursors====
Though Scrappy officially debuted in the fall of 1979, there may have been hints of his existence in 1969, as he &quot;...bore a resemblance to Spears&#x27;s and Ruby&#x27;s initial idea for a feisty little dog&quot;, which was one of the early ideas for the Scooby-Doo character himself, along with the &quot;big cowardly dog&quot; ultimately chosen.

After hearing Joe Barbera&#x27;s description of the character, writer Mark Evanier was significantly reminded of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; character Henery Hawk, and incorporated what he knew of said character into the script.

====Development====
Scrappy&#x27;s creation officially began in 1978, when Scooby-Doo&#x27;s ratings were sinking to the point of cancellation threats from ABC.

Duane Poole, a story editor for the first series in which Scrappy appeared, recalled it as a lively time, with many new ideas and some new blood being hired with the desperation to revive Scooby-Doo, which had been a cash-cow in its glory days.

Mel Blanc was the first choice to voice Scrappy, given his connection to Henery Hawk, but wanted too much money to voice the part. Frank Welker, the voice of Fred Jones, auditioned to voice Scrappy as a dual role during the character&#x27;s development (one of several voice actors considered for the role) and coined the catchphrase &quot;Puppy Power&quot; during his audition. He would later change this to &quot;Monkey Muscle&quot; for the similar Donkey Kong Jr. character he would voice for TV&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Supercade&quot;. The next choice was Messick, who was seen as giving the best audition, but still deemed &quot;the wrong voice&quot;. Afterwards, other well-known cartoon voice artists were considered or suggested: Daws Butler, Paul Winchell, Marilyn Schreffler, Howard Morris, Dick Beals and Marshall Efron. Ultimately, Lennie Weinrib was chosen.

===Warner Bros.===
==== Live-action &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; movie (2002) ====
Scrappy was first included in an early draft of what would become &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; (2002) in around March 2000—though he did not physically appear, was only mentioned offhand by Shaggy and Scooby, and was heavily implied to have been put to sleep (for undisclosed reasons). James Gunn first acknowledged his involvement in April 2000. Other original ideas for the villain included the Old Man Smithers, the villain from the beginning of the film. Concept art for Scrappy turning into a monster was drawn in 2001. According to the DVD commentary, choosing the villain of the movie was a problematic part of the production, as the makers did not feel comfortable simply giving the role to an &quot;anonymous monster&quot;, and that the ending was in &quot;bits and pieces&quot; and the &quot;confinements forced them to be creative.&quot; &quot;There is a Scrappy because he exists in the cartoon, so we have to acknowledge him&quot;, Gunn stated in an interview shortly before the film&#x27;s release.

Ultimately, in the final film, Scrappy is revealed to be the villain, in an attempt to get revenge on Mystery Inc. after they kicked him out. Despite previously stating that he felt that &quot;kids didn&#x27;t care&quot;, Gunn later admitted with some dismay that younger viewers had reacted poorly to the development, admitting he had not understood how popular Scrappy was with five- and six-year-olds. &quot;I still think it was funny that Scrappy was the villain&quot;, he explained in an interview with Cinefantastique, &quot;but there are kids out there who were really upset.&quot;

==Reception==
Scrappy was initially seen as a &quot;good idea&quot; by &quot;Saturday Morning Review&quot;. Viewership seemed to react positively to Scrappy, as Scooby&#x27;s ratings went up with Scrappy&#x27;s arrival. The character continued to be a success for the next decade. Story editor Duane Poole noted that &quot;Scrappy solved a lot of story problems. Before you had to get Shaggy and Scooby into dangerous situations—and there was no real easy way to get them there—with Scrappy, he, uh, picked them up and carried them there. He just charged in. He was just such the antithesis of what Scooby and Shaggy were. The dynamic was great fun to play.&quot;

Joe Ruby and Ken Spears seemed to have a less-than-positive view of the character. The co-founder of Ruby-Spears enterprises said, &quot;Everyone was upset&quot;, though was unclear about whether this concerned business reasons (they had started their own company two years earlier) or personal creative reasons (considering that if Scooby had been canceled, then the last slot would have hit their show instead), starting when, in 1979, it appeared that a pilot of theirs would be renewed over Scooby&#x27;s. Mark Evanier, who wrote said pilot, was hired impromptu to write Scrappy-Doo into a new pilot to renew interest in Scooby. As a result, Scooby was renewed over theirs, which was upsetting for them. &quot;Scrappy would charge in and solve things, so he was useful, in that way. A lot of people made derogatory comments about it at the studio and you know you don&#x27;t want to be saddled with something based on, you know, network [...] but I think I liked working with it most of those cartoons.&quot; Said Charles M. Howell, a writer who originally joined the franchise back on &quot;The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show&quot; and continued to work on various iterations of the show until finally ending his tenure in the late 1980s after penning the pilot episode for &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot;.

Tom Ruegger stated: &quot;It&#x27;s a lot easier to love Scooby than it is to love Scrappy. But I don&#x27;t have the problem with Scrappy that I have heard expressed by others. I suspect this is because I wasn&#x27;t watching Scooby from the beginning, but rather, I came in and started catching up quite a while (a couple of years) after Scrappy had made his debut. Hey, they&#x27;d been messing with Scooby&#x27;s cast for years! Scooby Dum. All those nasty celebrity cameo Scooby movies. I dislike those things more than I dislike Scrappy. And, for what it&#x27;s worth, at least Scrappy brings some energy to the table. He actually does have a personality, even though many find it obnoxious. [...] So, since I tend to love the characters with whom I work, I can say that I learned to love Scrappy, despite all his limitations.&quot; Casper Kelly, one of the writers of &quot;The Scooby-Doo Project&quot; also admitted to having Scrappy as being in his first memory of Scooby, as well as enjoying when the monsters were real over the traditional fake monster format.

In 1999, celebrating Scooby-Doo&#x27;s thirtieth anniversary, several newspapers printed articles, some of which mentioned Scrappy. In an episode of the 2011 series &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot;, Scrappy appeared in a brief cameo when Fred and Daphne visited a museum celebrating their exploits, to which Fred claimed &quot;we all promised each other that we would never speak of him&quot;. In 2020, Casper Kelly stated that many writers did not actually hate Scrappy, implying that it was a joke and mandate.

<text>Game Show Network (GSN) is an American basic cable channel owned by the television network division of Sony Pictures Television. The channel&#x27;s programming is primarily dedicated to game shows, including reruns of acquired game shows, along with new, first-run original and revived game shows. The network has also previously aired reality competition series and televised poker.

As of October 2019, Game Show Network claimed that it was available to &quot;nearly 75 million&quot; households in America, primarily through traditional cable and satellite services. The network and its original programming are also available on streaming and Internet television services, including Frndly TV, YouTube TV, Philo, fuboTV, Sling TV, and Plex.

==History==
===1994–2004: As &quot;Game Show Network&quot;===
On May 7, 1992, Sony Pictures Entertainment joined forces with the United Video Satellite Group to launch the Game Show Channel, which was set to begin in 1993. The announcement of the channel was made by SPE president Mel Harris.

On December 2, 1992, Sony Pictures Entertainment made a deal to acquire the Barry &amp; Enright game show library, and in a separate deal, struck a 10-year licensing agreement for the rights to the Mark Goodson game show library of more than 20,000 episodes including among others, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;Family Feud&quot;, and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. Upon the deal, Sony said it would sell an equity stake in the network to Mark Goodson Productions, including the production of new original series by Jonathan Goodson Productions. Both deals were completed on December 7, 1992, eleven days before Mark Goodson&#x27;s death. On June 6, 1994, Mark Goodson Productions pulled out of the venture. GSN&#x27;s launch time was intended to be at 10:00 p.m. ET, but at the time, it was pushed back to 7:00 p.m. ET.

Game Show Network launched at 7:00 p.m. on December 1, 1994. The first aired game show to be on GSN was &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. By the launch date, the network had secured rights to over 40,000 episodes from the libraries of several game show production companies and corporate parent Sony. The initial lineup was exclusively acquired programming such as &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. Over time, Game Show Network acquired the rights to &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, &quot;The $10,000 Pyramid&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; and other libraries, putting them on the schedule at various times throughout the network&#x27;s history. The network eventually began producing original game shows such as &quot;Lingo&quot;, &quot;Burt Luddin&#x27;s Love Buffet&quot;, &quot;Whammy!&quot;, &quot;Inquizition&quot;, and &quot;Extreme Gong&quot;. Faux Pause is an American television program that aired in 1998 on Game Show Network. Co-hosted by Mary Gallagher and Sean Donnellan, &quot;Pause&quot; consisted of jokes and skits done while watching certain episodes of game shows, in a similar fashion to &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

In 2001, a massive change in both leadership and programming at the network took place when Liberty Media acquired a 50% stake. Both president Michael Fleming and vice president Jake Tauber departed, and former ABC Family/Fox Family Channel president Rich Cronin was hired to head the network.

===2004–18: As &quot;GSN&quot;===
On March 15, 2004, Game Show Network began using the abbreviation &quot;GSN&quot; and introduced the tagline &quot;The Network for Games.&quot; GSN began expanding its programming to include reality television games and various competition-based programs. GSN would also air reruns of reality competitions (for example, &quot;Spy TV&quot; and &quot;The Mole&quot;). Along with its new format, GSN would continue to produce traditional game shows, including new seasons of &quot;Lingo&quot; and a revival of &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;.

David Goldhill succeeded Rich Cronin as GSN president on August 1, 2007. A high definition simulcast feed of the network was launched on September 15, 2010.

Some notable acquisitions for the network included &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; and the Steve Harvey-hosted &quot;Family Feud&quot;, both of which would headline the network&#x27;s prime time lineup. Notable original game shows produced during this time were &quot;Catch 21&quot; (which would be revived in 2019), &quot;Baggage&quot; (hosted by Jerry Springer), the first U.S. incarnation of &quot;The Chase&quot;, &quot;American Bible Challenge&quot; (the premiere of which drew an audience of nearly two million viewers), and &quot;Skin Wars&quot; (which would later move to Syfy). The network produced interactive program blocks, such as &quot;GSN Live&quot; and &quot;Playmania&quot;.

In March 2011, DirecTV (which by this point had taken over Liberty Media&#x27;s then-65% stake in the network) sold a 5% stake in the network back to Sony Pictures Entertainment. Although DirecTV nominally remained the majority owner, it had ceded control of the network to Sony, and had the right to force Sony to increase its stake in GSN to 58%. On November 8, 2012, DirecTV sold an 18% interest in GSN to Sony. GSN partnered with Vubiquity to launch &quot;GSN On Demand&quot; on August 15, 2013.

=== 2017–present: Return to &quot;Game Show Network&quot; ===
In April 2017, David Goldhill stepped down after nearly 10 years as GSN president, the longest tenure for any president to date. He was succeeded by Mark Feldman in August 2017. Later that year, the network would begin to refer to itself in promos by its full name. On October 1, 2018, the network&#x27;s programming returned to focus on traditional game show formats, culminating in a rebranding that restored the network&#x27;s full name.

The network&#x27;s daily schedule would consist almost entirely of original programming, including new shows like &quot;America Says&quot;, &quot;Common Knowledge&quot;, and &quot;People Puzzler&quot;. In April 2020, Game Show Network re-introduced &quot;Master Minds&quot;, a retool of an earlier original show called &quot;Best Ever Trivia Show&quot; featuring &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; champion and host Ken Jennings, and now hosted by the returning Brooke Burns of the GSN version of &quot;The Chase&quot;.

DirecTV&#x27;s stake in Game Show Network would move to AT&amp;T when it acquired the service in 2015. On November 18, 2019, it was announced that Sony had acquired AT&amp;T&#x27;s 42% stake and thus resumed full ownership of GSN. A list of 2020 Nielsen ratings published by &quot;Variety&quot; indicated that Game Show Network averaged 432,000 viewers in prime time, up 6% from the 2019 average.

In December 2021, Mark Feldman resigned after four years as Game Show Network president, to join the video game firm Scopely amid the gaming unit sale from Sony. He was succeeded by longtime executive John Zaccario. 

On September 7, 2022, Dish Network and Sling TV removed Game Show Network from their lineups, after failing to reach a renewal agreement with owner Sony Pictures Television. The network returned to both services on September 27, 2022.

==Programming==

Current original programming, as of February 2025, includes &quot;Split Second&quot;, &quot;Switch&quot;, and &quot;Beat the Bridge&quot;. Reruns of past original shows airing on the network include &quot;America Says&quot;, &quot;Catch 21&quot;, &quot;Master Minds&quot;, &quot;Common Knowledge&quot;, &quot;Chain Reaction &quot; (both Dylan Lane-hosted incarnations), and &quot;People Puzzler&quot;. 

GSN&#x27;s acquired slate includes &quot;Match Game&quot; (hosted by Gene Rayburn and Alec Baldwin), &quot;Family Feud&quot; (hosted by Steve Harvey), &quot;Flip Side&quot;, &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; (NBC version), &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; (hosted by Alex Trebek and Ken Jennings), &quot;25 Words or Less&quot;, &quot;Cash Cab&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; (original ABC primetime run hosted by Regis Philbin), &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; (hosted by Pat Sajak and Vanna White), &quot;The Wall&quot;, &quot;Card Sharks&quot; (ABC revival hosted by Joel McHale), &quot;The Chase&quot; (ABC revival hosted by Sara Haines), and the 2016 version of &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot;.

===Syndication===
GSN began syndicating some of its original programming to other channels in the early 2010s. On June 24, 2013, the channel entered into an agreement with Bounce TV, giving it the broadcast rights to &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, &quot;Catch 21&quot;, and &quot;The American Bible Challenge&quot;. &quot;The American Bible Challenge&quot; aired in reruns on UP in fall 2013 and again in spring 2015. &quot;Drew Carey&#x27;s Improv-A-Ganza&quot; aired on Laff in 2015. Reruns of &quot;America Says&quot; aired in syndication during the 2019–20 season. Currently, reruns of &quot;People Puzzler&quot; are airing in syndication for the 2023-24 television season.

===Game Show Central===

In March 2020, the network launched Game Show Central, a digital streaming channel broadcasting archived original programming. The network is currently available on Samsung and Vizio smart television sets and Paramount Global-owned AVOD platform Pluto TV (which also carries rival network Buzzr). Game Show Central features both current GSN originals like &quot;America Says&quot; and older shows such as &quot;Cram&quot;, &quot;Friend or Foe?&quot;, &quot;Minute To Win It&quot;, and &quot;Baggage&quot;. The Roku Channel picked up the service (with a somewhat different schedule and roster of shows compared to the Pluto TV stream) later in 2020. The service was made available globally via Plex in late July 2020.

On October 4, 2023, GSN partnered with sister company Crunchyroll, LLC to launch a Crunchyroll-branded FAST channel dedicated to anime and related programming. The Crunchyroll channel initially launched on October 11, 2023 on The Roku Channel, LG Channels, and Vizio WatchFree+ platforms.

Beginning in 2025, Game Show Central would also be offered as an over-the-air digital subchannel network, distributed in a hybrid OTA and cable/streaming model similar to the Oxygen network, on a number of stations owned by the E.W. Scripps Company, replacing the Sony-owned Get on a majority of the affiliates involved, with notable over-the-air affiliates being Ion affiliates on February 17, 2025.

==Online gaming==
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, GSN&#x27;s website at GSN.com offered Flash games based on popular GSN shows/

In 2007, Liberty Media acquired the Toronto-based FUN Technologies, operator of the popular online tournament casual game website WorldWinner. Following the acquisition, Liberty began to extend the GSN brand into online gaming by re-branding WorldWinner as a GSN service. GSN also launched a social gaming app on Facebook, now known as GSN Casino, featuring skill and casino games along with competitive tournaments. By October 2010, GSN Casino had over 8 million active users. GSN also developed a &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; app for Facebook, released in 2010.

GSN also published GSN Casino mobile apps, featuring various slot machine and bingo games in 2013, &quot;GSN Casino&quot; was the 10th highest-grossing app for iPad on the App Store. In January 2014, GSN acquired Bitrhymes Inc., developers of the social and mobile games &quot;Bingo Bash&quot; and &quot;Slots Bash&quot;, for an undisclosed amount. GSN had sued Bitrhymes in November 2013 following its prior offer to acquire the company, arguing that it had attempted to back out of its offer and accept a different one during GSN&#x27;s exclusive negotiation period.

In November 2014, the network announced that a show based on &quot;Bingo Bash&quot; was in development for Game Show Network&#x27;s 2015 slate of original programming.

In October 2021, Sony sold the GSN Games subsidiary to mobile game developer Scopely in a $1 billion cash and stock deal. Sony then took a minority stake in Scopely.

<text>Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), also known as IP telephony, refers to a set of technologies used for voice communication sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the Internet. VoIP enables voice calls to be transmitted as data packets, facilitating various methods of voice communication, including traditional applications like Skype, Microsoft Teams, Google Voice, and VoIP phones. Regular telephones can also be used for VoIP by connecting them to the Internet via analog telephone adapters (ATAs), which convert traditional telephone signals into digital data packets that can be transmitted over IP networks. 

The broader terms Internet telephony, broadband telephony, and broadband phone service specifically refer to the delivery of voice and other communication services, such as fax, SMS, and voice messaging, over the Internet, in contrast to the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN), commonly known as plain old telephone service (POTS).

VoIP technology has evolved to integrate with mobile telephony, including Voice over LTE (VoLTE) and Voice over 5G (Vo5G), enabling seamless voice communication over mobile data networks. These advancements have extended VoIP&#x27;s role beyond its traditional use in internet-based applications. It has become a key component of modern mobile infrastructure, as 4G and 5G networks rely entirely on this technology for voice transmission.

==Overview==
The steps and principles involved in originating VoIP telephone calls are similar to traditional digital telephony and involve signaling, channel setup, digitization of the analog voice signals, and encoding. Instead of being transmitted over a circuit-switched network, the digital information is packetized and transmission occurs as IP packets over a packet-switched network. They transport media streams using special media delivery protocols that encode audio and video with audio codecs and video codecs. Various codecs exist that optimize the media stream based on application requirements and network bandwidth; some implementations rely on narrowband and compressed speech, while others support high-fidelity stereo codecs.

The most widely used speech coding standards in VoIP are based on the linear predictive coding (LPC) and modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) compression methods. Popular codecs include the MDCT-based AAC-LD (used in FaceTime), the LPC/MDCT-based Opus (used in WhatsApp), the LPC-based SILK (used in Skype), μ-law, A-law versions of G.711, G.722, an open source voice codec known as iLBC, and a codec that uses only 8 kbit/s each way called G.729.

Early providers of voice-over-IP services used business models and offered technical solutions that mirrored the architecture of the legacy telephone network. Second-generation providers, such as Skype, built closed networks for private user bases, offering the benefit of free calls and convenience while potentially charging for access to other communication networks, such as the PSTN. This limited the freedom of users to mix-and-match third-party hardware and software. Third-generation providers, such as Google Talk, adopted the concept of federated VoIP. These solutions typically allow dynamic interconnection between users in any two domains of the Internet, when a user wishes to place a call.

In addition to VoIP phones, VoIP is also available on many personal computers and other Internet access devices. Calls and SMS text messages may be sent via Wi-Fi or the carrier&#x27;s mobile data network. VoIP provides a framework for consolidation of all modern communications technologies using a single unified communications system.

=== Integration of VoIP in Mobile Networks ===
VoIP technology has been adapted for use in mobile networks, leading to the development of advanced systems designed to support voice communication over modern data infrastructures. Among these are Voice over LTE (VoLTE) and Voice over 5G (Vo5G), which enable voice communication over IP-based mobile infrastructures. In contrast to traditional VoIP services, which often function independently of global telephone numbering systems, VoLTE and Vo5G are directly connected to mobile operators&#x27; infrastructures, providing seamless connectivity to the international telephone network.

VoLTE, introduced as part of 4G LTE networks, enables voice communication over an IP-based infrastructure initially developed for data transmission. It offers features such as high-definition voice (HD Voice) and faster call setup times compared to circuit-switched networks.

Vo5G, the 5G equivalent of VoLTE, utilizes the increased speed, reduced latency, and greater capacity of 5G networks to further enhance these capabilities. Both VoLTE and Vo5G maintain compatibility with traditional public switched telephone networks (PSTNs), allowing users to make and receive calls to and from any telephone number worldwide.

These technologies differ from standalone VoIP services by being fully integrated with mobile network operators. This integration ensures additional features such as emergency call support and quality-of-service guarantees, making them a central part of modern mobile telecommunication systems.

==Protocols==
Voice over IP has been implemented with proprietary protocols and protocols based on open standards in applications such as VoIP phones, mobile applications, and web-based communications.

A variety of functions are needed to implement VoIP communication. Some protocols perform multiple functions, while others perform only a few and must be used in concert. These functions include:
* &quot;Network&quot; and &quot;transport&quot; – Creating reliable transmission over unreliable protocols, which may involve acknowledging receipt of data and retransmitting data that wasn&#x27;t received.
* &quot;Session management&quot; – Creating and managing a session (sometimes glossed as simply a &quot;call&quot;), which is a connection between two or more peers that provides a context for further communication.
* &quot;Signaling&quot; – Performing registration (advertising one&#x27;s presence and contact information) and discovery (locating someone and obtaining their contact information), dialing (including reporting call progress), negotiating capabilities, and call control (such as hold, mute, transfer/forwarding, dialing DTMF keys during a call [e.g. to interact with an automated attendant or IVR], etc.).
* &quot;Media description&quot; – Determining what type of media to send (audio, video, etc.), how to encode/decode it, and how to send/receive it (IP addresses, ports, etc.).
* &quot;Media&quot; – Transferring the actual media in the call, such as audio, video, text messages, files, etc.
* &quot;Quality of service&quot; – Providing out-of-band content or feedback about the media such as synchronization, statistics, etc.
* &quot;Security&quot; – Implementing access control, verifying the identity of other participants (computers or people), and encrypting data to protect the privacy and integrity of the media contents and/or the control messages.

VoIP protocols include:
* Matrix, open standard for online chat, voice over IP, and videotelephony
* Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), connection management protocol developed by the IETF
* H.323, one of the first VoIP call signaling and control protocols that found widespread implementation. Since the development of newer, less complex protocols such as MGCP and SIP, H.323 deployments are increasingly limited to carrying existing long-haul network traffic.
* Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP), connection management for media gateways
* H.248, control protocol for media gateways across a converged internetwork consisting of the traditional PSTN and modern packet networks
* Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), transport protocol for real-time audio and video data
* Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP), sister protocol for RTP providing stream statistics and status information
* Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP), encrypted version of RTP
* Session Description Protocol (SDP), a syntax for session initiation and announcement for multi-media communications and WebSocket transports.
* Inter-Asterisk eXchange (IAX), protocol used between Asterisk PBX instances
* Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), instant messaging, presence information, and contact list maintenance
* Jingle, for peer-to-peer session control in XMPP
* Skype protocol, proprietary Internet telephony protocol suite based on peer-to-peer architecture

==Adoption==
===Consumer market===

Mass-market VoIP services use existing broadband Internet access, by which subscribers place and receive telephone calls in much the same manner as they would via the PSTN. Full-service VoIP phone companies provide inbound and outbound service with direct inbound dialing. Many offer unlimited domestic calling and sometimes international calls for a flat monthly subscription fee. Phone calls between subscribers of the same provider are usually free when flat-fee service is not available.

A VoIP phone is necessary to connect to a VoIP service provider. This can be implemented in several ways:
* Dedicated VoIP phones connect directly to the IP network using technologies such as wired Ethernet or Wi-Fi. These are typically designed in the style of traditional digital business telephones.
* An analog telephone adapter connects to the network and implements the electronics and firmware to operate a conventional analog telephone attached through a modular phone jack. Some residential Internet gateways and cable modems have this function built in.
* Softphone application software installed on a networked computer that is equipped with a microphone and speaker, or headset. The application typically presents a dial pad and display field to the user to operate the application by mouse clicks or keyboard input.

===PSTN and mobile network providers===
It is increasingly common for telecommunications providers to use VoIP telephony over dedicated and public IP networks as a backhaul to connect switching centers and to interconnect with other telephony network providers; this is often referred to as &quot;IP backhaul&quot;.

Smartphones may have SIP clients built into the firmware or available as an application download.

===Corporate use===
Because of the bandwidth efficiency and low costs that VoIP technology can provide, businesses are migrating from traditional copper-wire telephone systems to VoIP systems to reduce their monthly phone costs. In 2008, 80% of all new Private branch exchange (PBX) lines installed internationally were VoIP. For example, in the United States, the Social Security Administration is converting its field offices of 63,000 workers from traditional phone installations to a VoIP infrastructure carried over its existing data network.

VoIP allows both voice and data communications to be run over a single network, which can significantly reduce infrastructure costs. The prices of extensions on VoIP are lower than for PBX and key systems. VoIP switches may run on commodity hardware, such as personal computers. Rather than closed architectures, these devices rely on standard interfaces. VoIP devices have simple, intuitive user interfaces, so users can often make simple system configuration changes. Dual-mode phones enable users to continue their conversations as they move between an outside cellular service and an internal Wi-Fi network, so that it is no longer necessary to carry both a desktop phone and a cell phone. Maintenance becomes simpler as there are fewer devices to oversee.

VoIP solutions aimed at businesses have evolved into unified communications services that treat all communications—phone calls, faxes, voice mail, e-mail, web conferences, and more—as discrete units that can all be delivered via any means and to any handset, including cellphones. Two kinds of service providers are operating in this space: one set is focused on VoIP for medium to large enterprises, while another is targeting the small-to-medium business (SMB) market.

Skype, which originally marketed itself as a service among friends, has begun to cater to businesses, providing free-of-charge connections between any users on the Skype network and connecting to and from ordinary PSTN telephones for a charge.

== Delivery mechanisms ==
In general, the provision of VoIP telephony systems to organizational or individual users can be divided into two primary delivery methods: private or on-premises solutions, or externally hosted solutions delivered by third-party providers. On-premises delivery methods are more akin to the classic PBX deployment model for connecting an office to local PSTN networks.

While many use cases still remain for private or on-premises VoIP systems, the wider market has been gradually shifting toward &quot;Cloud&quot; or &quot;Hosted&quot; VoIP solutions. Hosted systems are also generally better suited to smaller or personal use VoIP deployments, where a private system may not be viable for these scenarios.

=== Hosted VoIP systems ===
&quot;Hosted&quot; or &quot;Cloud&quot; VoIP solutions involve a service provider or telecommunications carrier hosting the telephone system as a software solution within their own infrastructure.

Typically this will be one or more data centers with geographic relevance to the end-user(s) of the system. This infrastructure is external to the user of the system and is deployed and maintained by the service provider.

Endpoints, such as VoIP telephones or softphone applications (apps running on a computer or mobile device), will connect to the VoIP service remotely. These connections typically take place over public internet links, such as local fixed WAN breakout or mobile carrier service.

=== Private VoIP systems ===

In the case of a private VoIP system, the primary telephony system itself is located within the private infrastructure of the end-user organization. Usually, the system will be deployed on-premises at a site within the direct control of the organization. This can provide numerous benefits in terms of QoS control (see below), cost scalability, and ensuring privacy and security of communications traffic. However, the responsibility for ensuring that the VoIP system remains performant and resilient is predominantly vested in the end-user organization. This is not the case with a Hosted VoIP solution.

Private VoIP systems can be physical hardware PBX appliances, converged with other infrastructure, or they can be deployed as software applications. Generally, the latter two options will be in the form of a separate virtualized appliance. However, in some scenarios, these systems are deployed on bare metal infrastructure or IoT devices. With some solutions, such as 3CX, companies can attempt to blend the benefits of hosted and private on-premises systems by implementing their own private solution but within an external environment. Examples can include data center collocation services, public cloud, or private cloud locations.

For on-premises systems, local endpoints within the same location typically connect directly over the LAN. For remote and external endpoints, available connectivity options mirror those of Hosted or Cloud VoIP solutions.

However, VoIP traffic to and from the on-premises systems can often also be sent over secure private links. Examples include personal VPN, site-to-site VPN, private networks such as MPLS and SD-WAN, or via private SBCs (Session Border Controllers). While exceptions and private peering options do exist, it is generally uncommon for those private connectivity methods to be provided by Hosted or Cloud VoIP providers.

==Quality of service==
Communication on the IP network is perceived as less reliable in contrast to the circuit-switched public telephone network because it does not provide a network-based mechanism to ensure that data packets are not lost, and are delivered in sequential order. It is a best-effort network without fundamental quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Voice, and all other data, travels in packets over IP networks with fixed maximum capacity. This system may be more prone to data loss in the presence of congestion than traditional circuit switched systems; a circuit switched system of insufficient capacity will refuse new connections while carrying the remainder without impairment, while the quality of real-time data such as telephone conversations on packet-switched networks degrades dramatically. Therefore, VoIP implementations may face problems with latency, packet loss, and jitter.

By default, network routers handle traffic on a first-come, first-served basis. Fixed delays cannot be controlled as they are caused by the physical distance the packets travel. They are especially problematic when satellite circuits are involved because of the long distance to a geostationary satellite and back; delays of 400–600 ms are typical. Latency can be minimized by marking voice packets as being delay-sensitive with QoS methods such as DiffServ.

Network routers on high volume traffic links may introduce latency that exceeds permissible thresholds for VoIP. Excessive load on a link can cause congestion and associated queueing delays and packet loss. This signals a transport protocol like TCP to reduce its transmission rate to alleviate the congestion. But VoIP usually uses UDP not TCP because recovering from congestion through retransmission usually entails too much latency. So QoS mechanisms can avoid the undesirable loss of VoIP packets by immediately transmitting them ahead of any queued bulk traffic on the same link, even when the link is congested by bulk traffic.

VoIP endpoints usually have to wait for the completion of transmission of previous packets before new data may be sent. Although it is possible to preempt (abort) a less important packet in mid-transmission, this is not commonly done, especially on high-speed links where transmission times are short even for maximum-sized packets. An alternative to preemption on slower links, such as dialup and digital subscriber line (DSL), is to reduce the maximum transmission time by reducing the maximum transmission unit. But since every packet must contain protocol headers, this increases relative header overhead on every link traversed.

The receiver must resequence IP packets that arrive out of order and recover gracefully when packets arrive too late or not at all. Packet delay variation results from changes in queuing delay along a given network path due to competition from other users for the same transmission links. VoIP receivers accommodate this variation by storing incoming packets briefly in a playout buffer, deliberately increasing latency to improve the chance that each packet will be on hand when it is time for the voice engine to play it. The added delay is thus a compromise between excessive latency and excessive dropout, i.e. momentary audio interruptions.

Although jitter is a random variable, it is the sum of several other random variables that are at least somewhat independent: the individual queuing delays of the routers along the Internet path in question. Motivated by the central limit theorem, jitter can be modeled as a Gaussian random variable. This suggests continually estimating the mean delay and its standard deviation and setting the playout delay so that only packets delayed more than several standard deviations above the mean will arrive too late to be useful. In practice, the variance in latency of many Internet paths is dominated by a small number (often one) of relatively slow and congested bottleneck links. Most Internet backbone links are now so fast (e.g. 10 Gbit/s) that their delays are dominated by the transmission medium (e.g. optical fiber) and the routers driving them do not have enough buffering for queuing delays to be significant.

A number of protocols have been defined to support the reporting of quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) for VoIP calls. These include RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) extended reports, SIP RTCP summary reports, H.460.9 Annex B (for H.323), H.248.30 and MGCP extensions.

The RTCP extended report VoIP metrics block specified by is generated by an VoIP phone or gateway during a live call and contains information on packet loss rate, packet discard rate (because of jitter), packet loss/discard burst metrics (burst length/density, gap length/density), network delay, end system delay, signal/noise/echo level, mean opinion scores (MOS) and R factors and configuration information related to the jitter buffer. VoIP metrics reports are exchanged between IP endpoints on an occasional basis during a call, and an end of call message sent via SIP RTCP summary report or one of the other signaling protocol extensions. VoIP metrics reports are intended to support real-time feedback related to QoS problems, the exchange of information between the endpoints for improved call quality calculation and a variety of other applications.

===DSL and ATM===
DSL modems typically provide Ethernet connections to local equipment, but inside they may actually be Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) modems. They use ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) to segment each Ethernet packet into a series of 53-byte ATM cells for transmission, reassembling them back into Ethernet frames at the receiving end.

Using a separate virtual circuit identifier (VCI) for voice over IP has the potential to reduce latency on shared connections. ATM&#x27;s potential for latency reduction is greatest on slow links because worst-case latency decreases with increasing link speed. A full-size (1500 byte) Ethernet frame takes 94 ms to transmit at 128 kbit/s but only 8 ms at 1.5 Mbit/s. If this is the bottleneck link, this latency is probably small enough to ensure good VoIP performance without MTU reductions or multiple ATM VCs. The latest generations of DSL, VDSL and VDSL2, carry Ethernet without intermediate ATM/AAL5 layers, and they generally support IEEE 802.1p priority tagging so that VoIP can be queued ahead of less time-critical traffic.

ATM has substantial header overhead: 5/53 = 9.4%, roughly twice the total header overhead of a 1500 byte Ethernet frame. This &quot;ATM tax&quot; is incurred by every DSL user whether or not they take advantage of multiple virtual circuits – and few can.

===Layer 2===
Several protocols are used in the data link layer and physical layer for quality-of-service mechanisms that help VoIP applications work well even in the presence of network congestion. Some examples include:
* IEEE 802.11e is an approved amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard that defines a set of quality-of-service enhancements for wireless LAN applications through modifications to the media access control (MAC) layer. The standard is considered of critical importance for delay-sensitive applications, such as voice over wireless IP.
* IEEE 802.1p defines 8 different classes of service (including one dedicated to voice) for traffic on layer-2 wired Ethernet.
* The ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides a way to create a high-speed (up to 1 gigabit per second) Local area network (LAN) using existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables). G.hn provides QoS by means of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) which are allocated to flows (such as a VoIP call) that require QoS and which have negotiated a &quot;contract&quot; with the network controllers.

==Performance metrics==
The quality of voice transmission is characterized by several metrics that may be monitored by network elements and by the user agent hardware or software. Such metrics include network packet loss, packet jitter, packet latency (delay), post-dial delay, and echo. The metrics are determined by VoIP performance testing and monitoring.

==PSTN integration==
A VoIP media gateway controller (aka Class 5 Softswitch) works in cooperation with a media gateway (aka IP Business Gateway) and connects the digital media stream, so as to complete the path for voice and data. Gateways include interfaces for connecting to standard PSTN networks. Ethernet interfaces are also included in the modern systems which are specially designed to link calls that are passed via VoIP.

E.164 is a global numbering standard for both the PSTN and public land mobile network (PLMN). Most VoIP implementations support E.164 to allow calls to be routed to and from VoIP subscribers and the PSTN/PLMN. VoIP implementations can also allow other identification techniques to be used. For example, Skype allows subscribers to choose &quot;Skype names&quot; (usernames) whereas SIP implementations can use Uniform Resource Identifier (URIs) similar to email addresses. Often VoIP implementations employ methods of translating non-E.164 identifiers to E.164 numbers and vice versa, such as the Skype-In service provided by Skype and the E.164 number to URI mapping (ENUM) service in IMS and SIP.

Echo can also be an issue for PSTN integration. Common causes of echo include impedance mismatches in analog circuitry and an acoustic path from the receive to transmit signal at the receiving end.

===Number portability===
Local number portability (LNP) and mobile number portability (MNP) also impact VoIP business. Number portability is a service that allows a subscriber to select a new telephone carrier without requiring a new number to be issued. Typically, it is the responsibility of the former carrier to &quot;map&quot; the old number to the undisclosed number assigned by the new carrier. This is achieved by maintaining a database of numbers. A dialed number is initially received by the original carrier and quickly rerouted to the new carrier. Multiple porting references must be maintained even if the subscriber returns to the original carrier. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandates carrier compliance with these consumer-protection stipulations. In November 2007, the FCC in the United States released an order extending number portability obligations to interconnected VoIP providers and carriers that support VoIP providers.

A voice call originating in the VoIP environment also faces least-cost routing (LCR) challenges to reach its destination if the number is routed to a mobile phone number on a traditional mobile carrier. LCR is based on checking the destination of each telephone call as it is made, and then sending the call via the network that will cost the customer the least. This rating is subject to some debate given the complexity of call routing created by number portability. With MNP in place, LCR providers can no longer rely on using the network root prefix to determine how to route a call. Instead, they must now determine the actual network of every number before routing the call.

Therefore, VoIP solutions also need to handle MNP when routing a voice call. In countries without a central database, like the UK, it may be necessary to query the mobile network about which home network a mobile phone number belongs to. As the popularity of VoIP increases in the enterprise markets because of LCR options, VoIP needs to provide a certain level of reliability when handling calls.

===Emergency calls===
A telephone connected to a land line has a direct relationship between a telephone number and a physical location, which is maintained by the telephone company and available to emergency responders via the national emergency response service centers in form of emergency subscriber lists. When an emergency call is received by a center the location is automatically determined from its databases and displayed on the operator console.

In IP telephony, no such direct link between location and communications end point exists. Even a provider having wired infrastructure, such as a DSL provider, may know only the approximate location of the device, based on the IP address allocated to the network router and the known service address. Some ISPs do not track the automatic assignment of IP addresses to customer equipment.

IP communication provides for device mobility. For example, a residential broadband connection may be used as a link to a virtual private network of a corporate entity, in which case the IP address being used for customer communications may belong to the enterprise, not the residential ISP. Such off-premises extensions may appear as part of an upstream IP PBX. On mobile devices, e.g., a 3G handset or USB wireless broadband adapter, the IP address has no relationship with any physical location known to the telephony service provider, since a mobile user could be anywhere in a region with network coverage, even roaming via another cellular company.

At the VoIP level, a phone or gateway may identify itself by its account credentials with a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) registrar. In such cases, the Internet telephony service provider (ITSP) knows only that a particular user&#x27;s equipment is active. Service providers often provide emergency response services by agreement with the user who registers a physical location and agrees that, if an emergency number is called from the IP device, emergency services are provided to that address only.

Such emergency services are provided by VoIP vendors in the United States by a system called Enhanced 911 (E911), based on the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act. The VoIP E911 emergency-calling system associates a physical address with the calling party&#x27;s telephone number. All VoIP providers that provide access to the public switched telephone network are required to implement E911, a service for which the subscriber may be charged. &quot;VoIP providers may not allow customers to opt-out of 911 service.&quot; The VoIP E911 system is based on a static table lookup. Unlike in cellular phones, where the location of an E911 call can be traced using assisted GPS or other methods, the VoIP E911 information is accurate only if subscribers keep their emergency address information current.

==Fax support==
Sending faxes over VoIP networks is sometimes referred to as Fax over IP (FoIP). Transmission of fax documents was problematic in early VoIP implementations, as most voice digitization and compression codecs are optimized for the representation of the human voice and the proper timing of the modem signals cannot be guaranteed in a packet-based, connectionless network.

A standards-based solution for reliably delivering fax-over-IP is the T.38 protocol. The T.38 protocol is designed to compensate for the differences between traditional packet-less communications over analog lines and packet-based transmissions which are the basis for IP communications. The fax machine may be a standard device connected to an analog telephone adapter (ATA), or it may be a software application or dedicated network device operating via an Ethernet interface. Originally, T.38 was designed to use UDP or TCP transmission methods across an IP network.

Some newer high-end fax machines have built-in T.38 capabilities which are connected directly to a network switch or router. In T.38 each packet contains a portion of the data stream sent in the previous packet. Two successive packets have to be lost to actually lose data integrity.

==Power requirements==
Telephones for traditional residential analog service are usually connected directly to telephone company phone lines which provide direct current to power most basic analog handsets independently of locally available electrical power. The susceptibility of phone service to power failures is a common problem even with traditional analog service where customers purchase telephone units that operate with wireless handsets to a base station, or that have other modern phone features, such as built-in voicemail or phone book features.

VoIP phones and VoIP telephone adapters connect to routers or cable modems which typically depend on the availability of mains electricity or locally generated power. Some VoIP service providers use customer premises equipment (e.g., cable modems) with battery-backed power supplies to assure uninterrupted service for up to several hours in case of local power failures. Such battery-backed devices typically are designed for use with analog handsets. Some VoIP service providers implement services to route calls to other telephone services of the subscriber, such a cellular phone, in the event that the customer&#x27;s network device is inaccessible to terminate the call.

==Security==
Secure calls are possible using standardized protocols such as Secure Real-time Transport Protocol. Most of the facilities of creating a secure telephone connection over traditional phone lines, such as digitizing and digital transmission, are already in place with VoIP. It is necessary only to encrypt and authenticate the existing data stream. Automated software, such as a virtual PBX, may eliminate the need for personnel to greet and switch incoming calls.

The security concerns for VoIP telephone systems are similar to those of other Internet-connected devices. This means that hackers with knowledge of VoIP vulnerabilities can perform denial-of-service attacks, harvest customer data, record conversations, and compromise voicemail messages. Compromised VoIP user account or session credentials may enable an attacker to incur substantial charges from third-party services, such as long-distance or international calling.

The technical details of many VoIP protocols create challenges in routing VoIP traffic through firewalls and network address translators, used to interconnect to transit networks or the Internet. Private session border controllers are often employed to enable VoIP calls to and from protected networks. Other methods to traverse NAT devices involve assistive protocols such as STUN and Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE).

Standards for securing VoIP are available in the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) and the ZRTP protocol for analog telephony adapters, as well as for some softphones. IPsec is available to secure point-to-point VoIP at the transport level by using opportunistic encryption. Though many consumer VoIP solutions do not support encryption of the signaling path or the media, securing a VoIP phone is conceptually easier to implement using VoIP than on traditional telephone circuits. A result of the lack of widespread support for encryption is that it is relatively easy to eavesdrop on VoIP calls when access to the data network is possible. Free open-source solutions, such as Wireshark, facilitate capturing VoIP conversations.

Government and military organizations use various security measures to protect VoIP traffic, such as voice over secure IP (VoSIP), secure voice over IP (SVoIP), and secure voice over secure IP (SVoSIP). The distinction lies in whether encryption is applied in the telephone endpoint or in the network. Secure voice over secure IP may be implemented by encrypting the media with protocols such as SRTP and ZRTP. Secure voice over IP uses Type 1 encryption on a classified network, such as SIPRNet. Public Secure VoIP is also available with free GNU software and in many popular commercial VoIP programs via libraries, such as ZRTP.

In June 2021, the National Security Agency (NSA) released comprehensive documents describing the four attack planes of a communications system – the network, perimeter, session controllers and endpoints – and explaining security risks and mitigation techniques for each of them.

==Caller ID==
Voice over IP protocols and equipment provide caller ID support that is compatible with the PSTN. Many VoIP service providers also allow callers to configure custom caller ID information.

==Hearing aid compatibility==
Wireline telephones which are manufactured in, imported to, or intended to be used in the US with Voice over IP service, on or after February 28, 2020, are required to meet the hearing aid compatibility requirements set forth by the Federal Communications Commission.

==Operational cost==
VoIP has drastically reduced the cost of communication by sharing network infrastructure between data and voice. A single broadband connection has the ability to transmit multiple telephone calls.

==Regulatory and legal issues==

As the popularity of VoIP grows, governments are becoming more interested in regulating VoIP in a manner similar to PSTN services.

Throughout the developing world, particularly in countries where regulation is weak or captured by the dominant operator, restrictions on the use of VoIP are often imposed, including in Panama where VoIP is taxed, Guyana where VoIP is prohibited. In Ethiopia, where the government is nationalizing telecommunication service, it is a criminal offense to offer services using VoIP. The country has installed firewalls to prevent international calls from being made using VoIP. These measures were taken after the popularity of VoIP reduced the income generated by the state-owned telecommunications company.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission regulates telephone service, including VoIP telephony service. VoIP services operating in Canada are required to provide 9-1-1 emergency service.

===European Union===
In the European Union, the treatment of VoIP service providers is a decision for each national telecommunications regulator, which must use competition law to define relevant national markets and then determine whether any service provider on those national markets has &quot;significant market power&quot; (and so should be subject to certain obligations). A general distinction is usually made between VoIP services that function over managed networks (via broadband connections) and VoIP services that function over unmanaged networks (essentially, the Internet).

The relevant EU Directive is not clearly drafted concerning obligations that can exist independently of market power (e.g., the obligation to offer access to emergency calls), and it is impossible to say definitively whether VoIP service providers of either type are bound by them.

===Arab states of the GCC===
====Oman====
In Oman, it is illegal to provide or use unauthorized VoIP services, to the extent that web sites of unlicensed VoIP providers have been blocked. Violations may be punished with fines of 50,000 Omani Rial (about 130,317 US dollars), a two-year prison sentence or both. In 2009, police raided 121 Internet cafes throughout the country and arrested 212 people for using or providing VoIP services.

====Saudi Arabia====
In September 2017, Saudi Arabia lifted the ban on VoIPs, in an attempt to reduce operational costs and spur digital entrepreneurship.

====United Arab Emirates====
In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it is illegal to provide or use unauthorized VoIP services. Web sites of unlicensed VoIP providers have been blocked. Some VoIP services such as Skype were allowed. In January 2018, internet service providers in UAE blocked all VoIP apps, including Skype, but permitting only 2 government-approved VoIP apps (C’ME and BOTIM). In opposition, a petition on &quot;Change.org&quot; garnered over 5000 signatures, in response to which the website was blocked in UAE.

On March 24, 2020, the United Arab Emirates loosened restriction on VoIP services earlier prohibited in the country, to ease communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, popular instant messaging applications like WhatsApp, Skype, and FaceTime remained blocked from being used for voice and video calls, constricting residents to use paid services from the country&#x27;s state-owned telecom providers.

===India===
In India, it is legal to use VoIP, but it is illegal to have VoIP gateways inside India. This effectively means that people who have PCs can use them to make a VoIP call to other computers but not to a normal phone number. Foreign-based VoIP server services are illegal to use in India.

Internet telephony is permitted to the ISP with restrictions. The following services are permitted:
# PC to PC; within or outside India
# PC / a device / Adapter conforming to the standard of any international agencies like- ITU or IETF etc. in India to PSTN/PLMN abroad.
# Any device / Adapter conforming to standards of International agencies like ITU, IETF etc. connected to ISP node with static IP address to similar device / Adapter; within or outside India.
# Except whatever is described in , no other form of Internet Telephony is permitted.
# In India no Separate Numbering Scheme is provided to the Internet Telephony. Presently the 10 digit Numbering allocation based on E.164 is permitted to the Fixed Telephony, GSM, CDMA wireless service. For Internet Telephony, the numbering scheme shall only conform to IP addressing Scheme of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Translation of E.164 number / private number to IP address allotted to any device and vice versa, by ISP to show compliance with IANA numbering scheme is not permitted.
# The Internet Service Licensee is not permitted to have PSTN/PLMN connectivity. Voice communication to and from a telephone connected to PSTN/PLMN and following E.164 numbering is prohibited in India.

===South Korea===
In South Korea, only providers registered with the government are authorized to offer VoIP services. Unlike many VoIP providers, most of whom offer flat rates, Korean VoIP services are generally metered and charged at rates similar to terrestrial calling. Foreign VoIP providers encounter high barriers to government registration. This issue came to a head in 2006 when Internet service providers providing personal Internet services by contract to United States Forces Korea (USFK) members residing on USFK bases threatened to block off access to VoIP services used by USFK members as an economical way to keep in contact with their families in the United States, on the grounds that the service members&#x27; VoIP providers were not registered. A compromise was reached between USFK and Korean telecommunications officials in January 2007, wherein USFK service members arriving in Korea before June 1, 2007, and subscribing to the ISP services provided on base could continue to use their US-based VoIP subscription, but later arrivals are required to use a Korean-based VoIP provider, which by contract will offer pricing similar to the flat rates offered by US VoIP providers.

===United States===
In the United States, the FCC requires all interconnected VoIP service providers to comply with requirements comparable to those for traditional telecommunications service providers. VoIP operators in the US are required to support local number portability; make service accessible to people with disabilities; pay regulatory fees, universal service contributions, and other mandated payments; and enable law enforcement authorities to conduct surveillance pursuant to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA).

Operators of &quot;Interconnected&quot; VoIP (fully connected to the PSTN) are mandated to provide Enhanced 911 service without special request, provide for customer location updates, clearly disclose any limitations on their E-911 functionality to their consumers, obtain affirmative acknowledgements of these disclosures from all consumers, and may not allow their customers to opt-out of 911 service. VoIP operators also receive the benefit of certain US telecommunications regulations, including an entitlement to interconnection and exchange of traffic with incumbent local exchange carriers via wholesale carriers. Providers of &quot;nomadic&quot; VoIP service—those who are unable to determine the location of their users—are exempt from state telecommunications regulation.

Another legal issue that the US Congress is debating concerns changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The issue in question is calls between Americans and foreigners. The NSA is not authorized to tap Americans&#x27; conversations without a warrant—but the Internet, and specifically VoIP does not draw as clear a line to the location of a caller or a call&#x27;s recipient as the traditional phone system does. As VoIP&#x27;s low cost and flexibility convinces more and more organizations to adopt the technology, surveillance for law enforcement agencies becomes more difficult. VoIP technology has also increased federal security concerns because VoIP and similar technologies have made it more difficult for the government to determine where a target is physically located when communications are being intercepted, and that creates a whole set of new legal challenges.

==History==
The early developments of packet network designs by Paul Baran and other researchers were motivated by a desire for a higher degree of circuit redundancy and network availability in the face of infrastructure failures than was possible in the circuit-switched networks in telecommunications of the mid-twentieth century. Danny Cohen first demonstrated a form of packet voice in 1973 which was developed into Network Voice Protocol which operated across the early ARPANET.

On the early ARPANET, real-time voice communication was not possible with uncompressed pulse-code modulation (PCM) digital speech packets, which had a bit rate of 64kbps, much greater than the 2.4kbps bandwidth of early modems. The solution to this problem was linear predictive coding (LPC), a speech coding data compression algorithm that was first proposed by Fumitada Itakura of Nagoya University and Shuzo Saito of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in 1966. LPC was capable of speech compression down to 2.4kbps, leading to the first successful real-time conversation over ARPANET in 1974, between Culler-Harrison Incorporated in Goleta, California, and MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts. LPC has since been the most widely used speech coding method. Code-excited linear prediction (CELP), a type of LPC algorithm, was developed by Manfred R. Schroeder and Bishnu S. Atal in 1985. LPC algorithms remain an audio coding standard in modern VoIP technology.

In the two decades following the 1974 demo, various forms of packet telephony were developed and industry interest groups formed to support the new technologies. Following the termination of the ARPANET project, and expansion of the Internet for commercial traffic, IP telephony was tested and deemed infeasible for commercial use until the introduction of VocalChat in the early 1990s and then in Feb 1995 the official release of Internet Phone (or iPhone for short) commercial software by VocalTec, based on a patent by Lior Haramaty and Alon Cohen, and followed by other VoIP infrastructure components such as telephony gateways and switching servers. Soon after it became an established area of interest in commercial labs of the major IT concerns, notably at AT&amp;T, where Marian Croak and her team filed many patents related to the technology. By the late 1990s, the first softswitches became available, and new protocols, such as H.323, MGCP and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) gained widespread attention. In the early 2000s, the proliferation of high-bandwidth always-on Internet connections to residential dwellings and businesses, spawned an industry of Internet telephony service providers (ITSPs). The development of open-source telephony software, such as Asterisk PBX, fueled widespread interest and entrepreneurship in voice-over-IP services, applying new Internet technology paradigms, such as cloud services to telephony.

<text>In computer architecture, a local bus is a computer bus that connects directly, or almost directly, from the central processing unit (CPU) to one or more slots on the expansion bus. The significance of direct connection to the CPU is avoiding the bottleneck created by the expansion bus, thus providing fast throughput. There are several local buses built into various types of computers to increase the speed of data transfer (i.e. bandwidth). Local buses for expanded memory and video boards are the most common. VESA Local Bus and Processor Direct Slot were examples of a local bus design.

Although VL-Bus was later succeeded by AGP, it is not correct to categorize AGP as a local bus. Whereas VL-Bus operated on the CPU&#x27;s memory bus at the CPU&#x27;s clock speed, an AGP peripheral runs at specified clock speeds that run independently of the CPU clock (usually using a divider of the CPU clock).

<doc id="75034" wikidata="Q1899125" url="?curid=75034" title="Clean-room design">
<text>Clean-room design (also known as the Chinese wall technique) is the method of copying a design by reverse engineering and then recreating it without infringing any of the copyrights associated with the original design. Clean-room design is useful as a defense against copyright infringement because it relies on independent creation. However, because independent invention is not a defense against patents, clean-room designs typically cannot be used to circumvent patent restrictions.

The term implies that the design team works in an environment that is &quot;clean&quot; or demonstrably uncontaminated by any knowledge of the proprietary techniques used by the competitor.

Typically, a clean-room design is done by having someone examine the system to be reimplemented and having this person write a specification. This specification is then reviewed by a lawyer to ensure that no copyrighted material is included. The specification is then implemented by a team with no connection to the original examiners.

== Examples ==

Phoenix Technologies sold its clean-room implementation of the IBM-compatible BIOS to various PC clone manufacturers. American Megatrends also sold its clean-room implementation of the IBM-compatible BIOS to various PC clone manufacturers.

Several other PC clone companies, including Corona Data Systems, Eagle Computer, and Handwell Corporation, were litigated by IBM for copyright infringement, and were forced to re-implement their BIOS in a way which did not infringe IBM&#x27;s copyrights. The legal precedent for firmware being protected by copyright, however, hadn&#x27;t been established until 
&quot;Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.&quot;, 714 F.2d 1240 (3rd Circuit Court 1983). 
The three settlements by IBM, and the legal clean-room PC BIOS designs of Compaq and Columbia Data Products, happened before Phoenix announced, in July 1984, that they were licensing their own BIOS code. Phoenix expressly emphasized the clean-room process through which their BIOS code had been written by a programmer who did not even have prior exposure to Intel microprocessors, himself having been a TMS9900 programmer beforehand. As late as the early 1990s, IBM was winning millions of dollars from settling BIOS copyright infringement lawsuits against some other PC clone manufacturers like Matsushita/Panasonic (1987) and Kyocera (1993–1994), although the latter suit was for infringements between 1985 and 1990.

Another clean-room design example is VTech&#x27;s successful clones of the Apple II ROMs for the Laser 128, the only computer model, among dozens of Apple II compatibles, which survived litigation brought by Apple Computer. The &quot;Laser 128 story&quot; is in contrast to the Franklin Ace 1000, which lost in the 1983 decision, &quot;Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corporation&quot;. The previous PC &quot;clone&quot; examples are notable for not daring to fight IBM in court, even before the legal precedent for copyrighting firmware had been made.

Other examples include ReactOS, an open-source operating system made from clean-room reverse-engineered components of Windows, and Coherent operating system, a clean-room re-implementation of version 7 Unix. In the early years of its existence, Coherent&#x27;s developer Mark Williams Company received a visit from an AT&amp;T delegation looking to determine whether MWC was infringing on AT&amp;T Unix property. It has been released as open source.

== Case law ==
Clean-room design is usually employed as best practice, but not strictly required by law. In &quot;NEC Corp. v Intel Corp.&quot; (1990), NEC sought declaratory judgment against Intel&#x27;s charges that NEC&#x27;s engineers simply copied the microcode of the 8086 processor in their NEC V20 clone. A US judge ruled that while the early, internal revisions of NEC&#x27;s microcode were indeed a copyright violation, the later one, which actually went into NEC&#x27;s product, although derived from the former, were sufficiently different from the Intel microcode it could be considered free of copyright violations. While NEC themselves did not follow a strict clean-room approach in the development of their clone&#x27;s microcode, during the trial, they hired an independent contractor who was only given access to specifications but ended up writing code that had certain similarities to both NEC&#x27;s and Intel&#x27;s code. From this evidence, the judge concluded that similarity in certain routines was a matter of functional constraints resulting from the compatibility requirements, and thus were likely free of a creative element. Although the clean-room approach had been used as preventative measure in view of possible litigation before (e.g. in the Phoenix BIOS case), the &quot;NEC v. Intel&quot; case was the first time that the clean-room argument was accepted in a US court trial. A related aspect worth mentioning here is that NEC did have a license for Intel&#x27;s patents governing the 8086 processor.

&quot;Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corp.&quot; was a 1999 lawsuit which established an important precedent in regard to reverse engineering. Sony sought damages for copyright infringement over Connectix&#x27;s Virtual Game Station emulator, alleging that its proprietary BIOS code had been copied into Connectix&#x27;s product without permission. Sony won the initial judgment, but the ruling was overturned on appeal. Sony eventually purchased the rights to Virtual Game Station to prevent its further sale and development. This established a precedent addressing the legal implications of commercial reverse engineering efforts.

During production, Connectix unsuccessfully attempted a Chinese wall approach to reverse engineer the BIOS, so its engineers disassembled the object code directly. Connectix&#x27;s successful appeal maintained that the direct disassembly and observation of proprietary code was necessary because there was no other way to determine its behavior. From the ruling:

Some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others. Sony&#x27;s BIOS lay at a distance from the core because it contains unprotected aspects that cannot be examined without copying. The court of appeal therefore accorded it a lower degree of protection than more traditional literary works.

== In popular culture ==
* In the first season of the 2014 TV show &quot; Halt and Catch Fire&quot;, a key plot point from the second episode is how the fictional Cardiff Electric computer company placed an engineer in a clean room to reverse engineer a BIOS for its PC clone, to provide cover and protection from IBM lawsuits for a previous probably-illegal hacking of the BIOS code others at the company had performed. It reminded many critics of Compaq&#x27;s million dollar clean-room engineering, but a contemporary, but far less successful company, Columbia Data Products, also used such an approach. The reaction of IBM&#x27;s legal department, like other plot points, echoed the experiences of Corona Data Systems more closely.

<text>Johan Nicolai Madvig (; 7 August 1804 – 12 December 1886), was a Danish philologist and Kultus Minister.

==Life==

Madvig was born on the Danish island of Bornholm, south of Sweden. He was educated at the classical school of Frederiksborg and the University of Copenhagen, at least partially on the cost of Marie Kofoed. In 1828 he became reader, and in 1829 professor of Latin language and literature at Copenhagen, and in 1832 was appointed university librarian. In 1848, Madvig entered parliament as a member of the &quot;Eider-Danish&quot; part—those who desired the Eider to be the boundary of the country. When this party came into power Madvig became Kultus Minister in the Cabinet of Moltke II and III, but left the cabinet on 7 December 1851 as a protest against the government&#x27;s unity state program. In 1852 he became director of public instruction.

Some years later, from 1856 to 1863, Madvig was president of the Danish parliament and leader of the National Liberal Party. With these brief interruptions the greater part of his life was devoted to the study and teaching of Latin and the improvement of the classical schools, of which he was chief inspector. As a critic of classical texts he was distinguished for learning and acumen. He devoted much attention to Cicero, and revolutionized the study of his philosophical writings by an edition of &quot;De Finibus&quot; (1839). Other major contributions to classical scholarship are his &quot;Emendationes Livianae&quot; (1860; 2d ed. 1877) and the papers collected in his &quot;Opuscula Academica&quot; (&#x27;Minor Academic Works&#x27;) (1838) and &quot;Adversaria Critica&quot; (3 vols., 1871–84). Perhaps his most widely known works are those on Latin grammar and Greek syntax, especially his Latin grammar for schools (Eng. trans. by G Woods).
In 1874, his vision began to fail, and Madvig was forced to give up much of his work. He continued to lecture, and in 1879 he was chosen rector of the university for the sixth time. In 1880 he resigned his professorship, but went on with his work on the Roman constitution, which was completed and published before his death. In the book, Madvig takes a strongly conservative standpoint and attacks Theodor Mommsen&#x27;s views on Caesar&#x27;s programme of reforms. It is a clear exposition, though rather too dogmatic and without sufficient regard for the views of other scholars. His last work was his autobiography, &quot;Livserindringer&quot; (published 1887).

One of his textbooks, on Latin syntax, was re-issued as recently as 2001.

<text>Yelena Lvovna Shushunova (; sometimes spelled Elena Shushunova; 23 May 1969 – 16 August 2018) was a Soviet Russian gymnast. Shushunova was one of five women (alongside Larisa Latynina, Věra Čáslavská, Ludmilla Tourischeva and Lilia Podkopayeva) who have won all-around titles at all major competitions: Olympics, World Championships and European/Continental Championships and one of eleven women who medaled on every event at World Championships. Shushunova was renowned for pioneering complex skills as well as her explosive and dynamic tumbling and high consistency.

== Junior career ==
Shushunova was born and grew up in Leningrad and began gymnastics when she was approximately six or seven years old. She began competing as a junior gymnast in 1981. In 1982, she won gold medals at the 1982 Moscow News (now known as Moscow Stars of the World) and the Junior European Championships.
In 1983, she won the USSR Cup, which she won every year until 1988 with the exception of 1984.

== Senior career ==
Shushunova was named as a member of the Soviet national gymnastics team in 1984, but was unable to compete at the 1984 Summer Olympics as the Soviet Union boycotted the Olympics. Instead, she competed at the 1984 Friendship Games in Olomouc, Czechoslovakia, where she finished third all around and helped the USSR to a gold in the team event.

The following year Shushunova made her breakthrough by winning the all-around title at the European Championships. She also won three gold medals in the event finals on vault, floor exercise, and uneven bars (which she shared with East German Olympian Maxi Gnauck). At the World Championships she won five medals including the all-around title, which she shared with compatriot Oksana Omelianchik. She took first on vault, third on beam, and second on floor. In her floor exercise she tumbled a double layout, and side Arabian 1 and 3/4 salto, both rare skills for women at that time; in fact, women are no longer allowed to compete saltos which end in a roll. Here she displayed her signature skill, a straddle jump to prone support, a rare and innovative move for the 1980s.

Shushunova&#x27;s dominance in women&#x27;s gymnastics continued at the 1986 World Cup in Beijing. There she won the all-around, vault, uneven bars, and floor exercise titles. In this competition she displayed an increased level of difficulty on two apparatus, showing a Rulfova flic (full twisting Korbut flic) on balance beam and a tucked full in double salto dismount on the uneven bars. At the 1986 Goodwill Games she led the Soviet team to a gold medal, but then fell twice in the all-around finals to finish second to teammate Vera Kolesnikova. She rallied in the event finals to take, once again, the vault, bars, and floor golds and the beam silver.

In 1987, Shushunova lost the European title to Romanian Daniela Silivaș due to a fall on a double layout dismount from the uneven bars. At the European Championships she earned a bronze in the all-around and a gold on vault. She continued to show increased difficulty on all apparatus by competing a double layout dismount on the uneven bars, a layout Thomas salto on floor, and a full in dismount on beam. Later that year her team lost the World Championships team title, placing second to the Romanian team. Shushunova also lost the world title to Romanian Aurelia Dobre, finishing in second place. In the event finals she retained her vault title with her textbook Yurchenko full and Yurchenko 1.5, beating Romanian Eugenia Golea. She also earned a bronze medal on the uneven bars. Shushunova also earned silver on balance beam and tied with Daniela Silivas for gold on floor exercise.

=== 1988 Olympics ===
In 1988, Shushunova competed at the Summer Olympics in Seoul. She scored three perfect scores of 10 in optional events and won the individual all-around and team event titles. She also won silver on balance beam and bronze on uneven bars. Shushunova fell on a double twisting Yurchenko on vault and failed to medal. She also failed to medal on floor exercise due to stumbling out of the landing of her opening full-in double back and falling out of her arabian 1 3/4 salto.

=== Later life ===
Shushunova retired from competition two months after the 1988 Olympics and later returned to her home city of Saint Petersburg, where she worked for the city&#x27;s sports committee. She helped to organise the gymnastics events of the 1994 Goodwill Games and 1998 European Championships, both of which were held in Saint Petersburg.

In 2004, she was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame. In the following year, she was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

=== Eponymous skills ===
Shushunova has two eponymous skills named after her in the Code of Points.

==Death==
Shushunova died from complications of pneumonia on 16 August 2018. She was 49.

<text>The Transvaal Colony () was the name used to refer to the Transvaal region during the period of direct British rule and military occupation between the end of the Second Boer War in 1902 when the South African Republic was dissolved, and the establishment of the Union of South Africa in 1910. The borders of the Transvaal Colony were larger than the defeated South African Republic (which had existed from 1856 to 1902). In 1910 the entire territory became the Transvaal Province of the Union of South Africa.

== History ==

Both the Boer republics, the South African Republic (ZAR) and the Orange Free State were defeated in the Anglo-Boer War and surrendered to the UK. The peace treaty (Treaty of Vereeniging) contained the following terms:
# That all burghers of the ZAR and Orange Free State lay down their arms and accept King Edward VII as their sovereign.
# That all burghers outside the borders of the ZAR and Orange Free State, upon declaring their allegiance to the King, be transported back to their homes.
# That all burghers so surrendering will not be deprived of their property.
# No Civil or Criminal proceedings against burghers for acts of war, except Acts contrary to the usage of war. In such cases, there is to be held an immediate court-martial.
# That High Dutch be taught in schools and that the use of the Dutch language will be allowed in law courts.
# That the possession of rifles be allowed under license.
# That Military Administration be succeeded at the earliest possible date by representative institutions leading up to self-government.
# That the question of granting franchise to natives not be discussed until after self-government.
# That no special tax be introduced to cover the costs of the war.
# That various commissions be established to process and pay valid claims for war expenses and to honor script issued by the countries of the ZAR and Orange Free State during the period of the war. The commission would also feed the homeless and assist with the reconstruction of homes affected by the war. To that end, the crown agrees to a free grant of £3,000,000 as well as loans at no interest for two years to be repaid at 3 percent interest over years thereafter.

In 1902, with peace following the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging, the new Transvaal colony was faced with intertwined economic and political issues that needed to be resolved. The economic issues faced included the restoration of the mining industry to pre-war levels, then growing it further with the need for extra labour, the restoration of the Boers to their lands and increasing the agricultural output of those farms. The political issue faced depended on what side of politics one stood on. The existing British administrators under Alfred Milner wished to anglicise the population through two main means. One by increasing the English-speaking population of the Transvaal and the other by teaching the Boer children in English with very little Dutch used, followed by self-rule. The Transvaal Boers&#x27; political objectives were the restoration of self-rule in the colony and the political environment to be dominated by the Boers.

== Repatriation and reconstruction ==
As the war ended the British were faced with a large proportion of Boer men as prisoners of war and their families in concentration camps. As the British followed a scorched earth policy in the Transvaal, Boer lands, stock and farms had been destroyed.

At the conclusion of the war, it was necessary to reconstruct a &quot;government&quot; for the new colony and this was begun with the appointment of a Resident Magistrate in every district of the colony who became District Commissioners while an Assistant Magistrate carried out the legal and magisterial duties of the area. Roman-Dutch law was translated into English so the law courts could continue, with some old acts repealed and a considerable amount of new law promulgated by the authorities in Johannesburg.

The Resident Magistrate then submitted the names of three members of the district to the Governor for district commission under the magistrate. They would consist of one British subject, and two Boers, one from those who had surrendered early on in the war and one who had fought until the end. The commission would have two functions, one to provide assistance and issuing of rations, equipment, transport and plough animals to those affected by the war, and the second to investigate claims for compensation for actual damages sustained during the war.

Repatriation depots were established in the districts and they were stocked with food, seed, agricultural equipment, transport, plough animals, stone and building material. The rail transport network struggled to compete with the army transport requirement to maintain a garrison and civilian requirements to repair the colony. All feed for transport animals had to be brought to the depots as the process started in the winter of 1902. Refugees from the concentration camps and prisoners of war were returned to their districts in a system of drafts. At the depots, they would receive farm equipment, tents and rations to start again and transport to their destinations. Food rations were provided for almost a year. Families would receive a token grant irrespective of their ability to pay it back and additional material and equipment required were obtained via interest-free loans with small cash loans also attracting no interest, with larger loans attracting four percent interest by a mortgage. The loan scheme was never going to compensate a person for the actual loss experienced by the war. Damage and the reconstruction required varied from district to district.

In the larger towns, municipal or health boards were &quot;appointed&quot; to manage them under the Resident Magistrate. They had limited functions and the only rates they levied were for sanitary functions. Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters&#x27; rolls with the registration process explained in English and Dutch.

===Economic issues===
The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans. The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908. They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land, but the lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail. An attempt was made to place English settlers on farmland so as to anglicise the Transvaal and increase the English-speaking population but this failed, too, as the policy attracted too few settlers.

By the end of 1901, gold mining finally resumed on the Rand around Johannesburg, having virtually stopped since 1899. Backed by the mining magnates and the British administrators, there was a need to restart the industry but labour was required. Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren&#x27;t keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labourers weren&#x27;t interested in working the mines. Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903 sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers. The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904. Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear campaign aimed at white miners about the need for this labour or face the possibility of loss of mining and their jobs. By 1906, the gold mines of the Witwatersrand were in full production and by 1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output. By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners.

===Political issues===

From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London. In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down. Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief that they did not represent the Boer population, and due to the lack of self-rule, Louis Botha and others met in 1904 at a &quot;Volkskongres&quot;. The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts. This new party&#x27;s objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal.

English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party. The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E.P Solomon and made up of a loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen. They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and for the party to be eventually renamed the Nationalists. The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry&#x27;s opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain. They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick.

The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule. Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly. More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party.

== 1907 election ==
The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats. It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained except Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party. The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats. Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat. The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat.

Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary. Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip. The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip. They all assembled for the first time in March 1907. After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners. Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour.

By 1908, the Boers had won control, in elections, of the Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence there was the need now to unite the country under one government.

== Progression to Union ==

In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and also included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention. The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between the Boers and the English. On 12 October 1908, the thirty delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers. Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background with the remaining fourteen of Boer origin.

The main issues discussed were whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation, who would be allowed to vote, and the number of voters who would make up a constituency in rural and urban seats. All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts. On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention. The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races. A compromise was reached and all the colonies&#x27; wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement were accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament. As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents. This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 South African general election, sweeping D.F. Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid. The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909. By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the British Parliament and into law.

As to the question of black enfranchisement, Milner saw this is a serious issue when it came to a peace treaty:&quot;If I did not have some conscience about the treatment of blacks I personally could win over the Dutch in the Colony and indeed all the South African dominion without offending the English. You have only to sacrifice ‘the nigger’ and the game is easy. Any attempt to secure fair play for them makes the Dutch fractious and almost unmanageable.&quot;

==Colonial Administration==

Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor. The first elected Cabinet of the Transvaal Colony was formed on 4 March 1907.

== Geography ==
The Transvaal Colony lay between Vaal River in the south and the Limpopo River in the north, roughly between 22½ and 27½ S, and 25 and 32 E. To its south it bordered with the Orange Free State and Natal Colony, to its south-west were the Cape Colony, to the west was the Bechuanaland Protectorate (later Botswana), to its north was Rhodesia, and to its east were Portuguese East Africa and Swaziland. Except in the south-west, these borders were mostly well defined by natural features. Within the Transvaal lies the Waterberg Massif, a prominent ancient geological feature of the South African landscape.

<text>Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (; 89 BC – late 13 or early 12 BC) was a Roman general and statesman who formed the Second Triumvirate alongside Octavian and Mark Antony during the final years of the Roman Republic. Lepidus had previously been a close ally of Julius Caesar. He was also the last &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; before the Roman Empire, and (presumably) the last &quot;interrex&quot; and &quot;magister equitum&quot; to hold military command.

Though he was an able military commander and proved a useful partisan of Caesar, Lepidus has always been portrayed as the least influential member of the Triumvirate. He typically appears as a marginalised figure in depictions of the events of the era, most notably in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. While some scholars have endorsed this view, others argue that the evidence is insufficient to discount the distorting effects of propaganda by his opponents, principally Cicero and, later, Augustus.

==Family==
Lepidus was the son of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul in 78 BC); his mother may have been a daughter of Lucius Appuleius Saturninus. His brother was Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (consul in 50). His father was the first leader of the revived populares faction after the death of Sulla, and led an unsuccessful rebellion against the optimates in 78–77 (he was defeated just outside of Rome and fled to Sardinia where he died in 77).

Lepidus married Junia Secunda, half-sister of Marcus Junius Brutus and sister of Marcus Junius Silanus, Junia Prima and Junia Tertia, Cassius Longinus&#x27;s wife. Lepidus and Junia Secunda had at least one child, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the Younger.

==Biography==
===Ally of Caesar===
Lepidus joined the College of Pontiffs as a child. He started his &quot;cursus honorum&quot; as &quot;triumvir monetalis&quot;, overseeing the minting of coins, from c. 62 to 58 BC. Lepidus soon became one of Julius Caesar&#x27;s greatest supporters. He was appointed as a praetor in 49 BC, being placed in charge of Rome while Caesar defeated Pompey in Greece. He secured Caesar&#x27;s appointment as dictator, a position that Caesar used to get himself elected as consul, resigning the dictatorship after eleven days. Lepidus was rewarded with the position of propraetor in the Spanish province of Hispania Citerior. Lepidus was also nominated &quot;interrex&quot; by the Senate in 52, being the last known Roman to hold this office.

In Spain, Lepidus was called upon to quell a rebellion against Quintus Cassius Longinus, governor of neighbouring Hispania Ulterior. Lepidus refused to support Cassius, who had created opposition to Caesar&#x27;s regime by his corruption and avarice. He negotiated a deal with the rebel leader, the quaestor Marcellus, and helped to defeat an attack by the Mauretanian king Bogud. Cassius and his supporters were allowed to leave and order was restored. Caesar and the Senate were sufficiently impressed by Lepidus&#x27;s judicious mixture of negotiation and surgical military action that they granted him a triumph.

Lepidus was rewarded with the consulship in 46 after the defeat of the Pompeians in the East. Caesar also made Lepidus &quot;magister equitum&quot; (&quot;Master of the Horse&quot;), effectively his deputy. Caesar appears to have had greater confidence in Lepidus than in Mark Antony to keep order in Rome, after Antony&#x27;s inflammatory actions led to disturbances in 47. Lepidus appears to have been genuinely shocked when Antony provocatively offered Caesar a crown at the Lupercalia festival, an act that helped to precipitate the conspiracy to kill Caesar.

When in February 44 Caesar was elected dictator for life by the Senate, he made Lepidus &quot;magister equitum&quot; for the second time. The brief alliance in power of Caesar and Lepidus came to a sudden end when Caesar was assassinated on March 15, 44 (the Ides of March). Caesar had dined at Lepidus&#x27;s house the night before his murder. One of the ringleaders of the conspiracy, Gaius Cassius Longinus, had argued for the killing of Lepidus and Mark Antony as well, but Marcus Junius Brutus had overruled him, saying the action was an execution and not a political coup d&#x27;état.

===Aftermath of Caesar&#x27;s death===
As soon as Lepidus learned of Caesar&#x27;s murder, he acted decisively to maintain order by moving troops to the Campus Martius. He proposed using his army to punish Caesar&#x27;s killers, but was dissuaded by Antony and Aulus Hirtius. Lepidus and Antony both spoke in the Senate the following day, accepting an amnesty for the assassins in return for preservation of their offices and Caesar&#x27;s reforms. Lepidus also obtained the post of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, succeeding Caesar.

At this point, Pompey&#x27;s surviving son Sextus Pompey tried to take advantage of the turmoil to threaten Spain. Lepidus was sent to negotiate with him. Lepidus successfully negotiated an agreement with Sextus that maintained the peace. The Senate voted him a public thanksgiving festival. Lepidus thereafter administered both Hispania and Narbonese Gaul as proconsul.

When Antony attempted to take control of Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy) by force and to displace Decimus Brutus, the Senate, led by Cicero, called on Lepidus to support Brutus – one of Caesar&#x27;s killers. Lepidus prevaricated, recommending negotiation with Antony. After Antony&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Mutina, the Senate sent word that Lepidus&#x27; troops were no longer needed. Antony, however, marched towards Lepidus&#x27;s province with his remaining forces. Lepidus continued to assure the Senate of his loyalty, but engaged in negotiations with Antony. When the two armies met, large portions of Lepidus&#x27;s forces joined up with Antony. Lepidus negotiated an agreement with him, while claiming to the Senate that he had no choice. It is unclear whether Lepidus&#x27; troops forced him to join with Antony, whether that was always Lepidus&#x27;s plan, or whether he arranged matters to gauge the situation and make the best deal.

===Second Triumvirate===

Antony and Lepidus now had to deal with Octavian Caesar, Caesar&#x27;s great-nephew, who had been adopted by Caesar in Caesar&#x27;s will. Octavian was the only surviving commander of the forces that had defeated Antony at Mutina (modern Modena). The Senate instructed Octavian to hand over control of the troops to Decimus Brutus, but he refused. Antony and Lepidus met with Octavian on an island in a river, possibly near Mutina, but more likely near Bologna. Their armies lined along opposite banks. They formed the Second Triumvirate, legalized with the name of &quot;Triumvirs for Confirming the Republic with Consular Power&quot; (Triumviri Rei Publicae Constituendae Consulari Potestate) by the &quot;Lex Titia&quot; of 43. With the triumvirs in possession of overwhelming numerical superiority, Decimus Brutus&#x27; remaining forces melted away, leaving the triumvirs in complete control of the western provinces.

Unlike the First Triumvirate of Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, this one was formally constituted. In effect, it sidelined the consuls and the Senate and signalled the death of the Republic. The triumvirate&#x27;s legal lifespan was for five years. At the beginning Lepidus was confirmed in possession of both the provinces of Hispania, along with Narbonese Gaul, but also agreed to hand over seven of his legions to Octavian and Antony to continue the struggle against Brutus and Cassius, who controlled the eastern part of Roman territory. In the event of a defeat, Lepidus&#x27; territories would provide a fall-back position. Lepidus was to become consul and was confirmed as Pontifex Maximus. He would assume control of Rome while they were away.

According to Lepidus&#x27;s biographer Richard D. Weigel, Lepidus&#x27; willingness to give up his legions inevitably consigned him to a subsidiary role in the triumvirate. 

Lepidus also agreed to the proscriptions that led to the death of Cicero and other die-hard opponents of Caesar&#x27;s faction. Later historians were particularly critical of him for agreeing to the death of his brother Lucius Paullus, a supporter of Cicero. However, Cassius Dio hints that Lepidus helped Paullus to escape.

===After Philippi===
After the pacification of the east and the defeat of the assassins&#x27; faction in the Battle of Philippi, during which he remained in Rome, Antony and Octavian took over most of Lepidus&#x27; territories, but granted him rights in the provinces of Numidia and Africa as proconsul. For a while he managed to distance himself from the frequent quarrels between his colleagues Antony and Octavian. When the Perusine War broke out in 41, Octavian tasked Lepidus with the defence of Rome against Lucius Antonius, Mark Antony&#x27;s brother. Lucius, with superior forces, easily took the city. Lepidus was forced to flee to Octavian&#x27;s camp. Lucius soon withdrew from Rome and Octavian retook the city. After this event, Lepidus was given six of Antony&#x27;s legions to govern Africa. In 37 BC the treaty of Tarentum formally renewed the Triumvirate for another five years.

During Lepidus&#x27; proconsulship of Africa, he promoted the distribution of land to veterans, possibly in order to build up a network of clients. He appears to have encouraged the Romanisation of Thibilis in Numidia and to have demolished illicit extensions to Carthage. In result, the formally cursed area of the old city, destroyed after the Third Punic War, was not built upon.

===Fall from power===
In 36 BC, during the Sicilian revolt, Lepidus raised a large army of 14 legions to help subdue Sextus Pompey. However, this was to lead to an ill-judged political move that gave Octavian the excuse he needed to remove Lepidus from power. After the defeat of Sextus Pompey, Lepidus had stationed his legions in Sicily and a dispute arose over whether he or Octavian had authority on the island. Lepidus had been the first to land troops in Sicily and had captured several of the main towns. However, he felt that Octavian was treating him as a subordinate, instead of an equal. He asserted that Sicily should be absorbed into his sphere of influence. After negotiation, he suggested an alternative: Octavian could have Sicily and Africa, if he agreed to give Lepidus back his old territories in Spain and Gaul, which should legally have been his according to the Lex Titia. Octavian accused Lepidus of attempting to usurp power and fomenting rebellion. Humiliatingly, Lepidus&#x27; legions in Sicily defected to Octavian and Lepidus himself was forced to submit to him.

On 22 September 36 BC, Lepidus was stripped of all his offices except that of &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot;; Octavian then confined him to Circeii. After the defeat of Antony in 31 BC, Lepidus&#x27; son Marcus Aemilius Lepidus Minor became involved in a conspiracy to assassinate Octavian, but the plot was discovered by Gaius Maecenas. The younger Lepidus was executed, but the former triumvir himself was left unmolested. His wife Junia was, however, implicated. Lepidus had to plead with his former enemy Lucius Saenius Balbinus to grant her bail.

Spending the rest of his life in relative obscurity, Lepidus was apparently obliged to return to Rome periodically to participate in Senate business. Octavian, now known as &quot;Augustus&quot;, is said to have belittled him by always asking for his vote last. Lepidus died peacefully in late 13 BC, upon which Augustus was elected to the position of &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot; on 6 March 12 BC; afterwards, the chief priest&#x27;s office was moved from the Regia to Augustus&#x27; palace, located on the Palatine Hill in Rome.

==Reputation==
Lepidus&#x27;s biographer Richard D. Weigel says that he has been typically caricatured by both ancient and modern historians as &quot;weak, indecisive, fickle, disloyal and incompetent&quot;. Cicero condemned Lepidus for &quot;wickedness and sheer folly&quot; after Lepidus allowed his forces to join with Mark Antony&#x27;s after Antony&#x27;s initial defeat at the Battle of Mutina. Cicero also privately suggested that Lepidus&#x27; wife, Junia, had been unfaithful to him. Decimus Brutus called him a &quot;weathercock&quot;, and Velleius Paterculus called him &quot;the most fickle of mankind&quot; and incapable of command. According to Cassius Dio, while Mark Antony and Octavian were away from Rome fighting Brutus and Cassius, Lepidus was nominally in control of the city, but Mark Antony&#x27;s wife, Fulvia, was the real power. Dio wrote, &quot;She, the mother-in‑law of Octavian and wife of Antony, had no respect for Lepidus because of his slothfulness, and managed affairs herself, so that neither the senate nor the people transacted any business contrary to her pleasure&quot;.

Such views are reflected in Shakespeare&#x27;s portrayal of Lepidus in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; in which Antony describes him as &quot;a slight, unmeritable man, meant to be sent on errands&quot;, comparable to a donkey required to bear burdens. In &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; he is portrayed as extremely gullible, asking Antony silly questions about Egypt while very drunk. Antony taunts him with an elaborately nonsensical description of a Nile crocodile. After Lepidus&#x27;s fall from power, he is referred to as the &quot;poor third&quot; and &quot;fool Lepidius&quot;.

Modern writers have often been equally dismissive. Ronald Syme called him &quot;a flimsy character...perfidious and despised&quot;. Weigel argues that these views are coloured by evidence that was in large part politically motivated, and that Lepidus&#x27;s career was no more perfidious or inconsistent than that of the other major players in the power struggles at the time. Léonie Hayne says that he acted &quot;skillfully and consistently in support of Antony and (indirectly) of the Caesarian faction&quot;. She also argues that his power bid over Sicily was logical and justifiable. Alain Gowing has also argued that his actions in Sicily, though &quot;futile&quot;, were no more than an &quot;attempt to regain a position from which he had been unfairly thrust&quot;.

==Fictional depictions==
Despite his role as &quot;a slight, unmeritable man&quot; in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and as a rambling drunk in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, other Renaissance-era writers portrayed Lepidus in a more positive way. Caspar Brülow&#x27;s Latin play &quot;Caius Julius Caesar&quot; depicts Lepidus as Caesar&#x27;s loyal ally, warning him against conspiracies and later planning revenge on his killers. Georges de Scudéry&#x27;s &quot;La Mort de César&quot; portrays him in a similar light, warning Caesar, and later working closely with Antony, who refers to him as &quot;sage et prudent Lépide&quot;. In Pierre Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Mort de Pompée&quot; his is a non-speaking role, simply presented as one of Caesar&#x27;s entourage of officers.

Lepidus appears in several 18th century French plays, such as Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon&#x27;s &quot;Le Triumvirat, ou la mort de Cicéron&quot;, in which he attempts to save Cicero&#x27;s life, and is portrayed as a conflicted figure, who respects traditional Roman values, but is unable to resist the will of his colleagues. Cicero rejects compromise, but Lepidus is too weak to do so. Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Le Triumvirat&quot; refers to Lepidus as a pawn, merely used by Antony and Octavian.

Lepidus appears in a number of novels. He is the principal character of Alfred Duggan&#x27;s 1958 historical novel &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. As the novel&#x27;s title implies, it is centered on the second triumvirate, but relates the period through the lens of Lepidus&#x27; life and experiences. According to Weigel, he becomes a kind of &quot;a Don Quixote in a toga&quot;. The novel follows the standard portrayal of him as &quot;cowardly, stupid, shying away from combat, dominated by women, and longing for someone to give him orders&quot;. A reviewer at the time of publication referred to Duggan&#x27;s Lepidus as &quot;the eternal conservative stuffed shirt without the moral strength to live by the traditional virtues he admires and pretends to possess.&quot; He is portrayed as a more competent figure in W. G. Hardy&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Mantle&quot; and &quot;The Bloodied Toga&quot;. In Allan Massie&#x27;s &quot;Let the Emperor Speak&quot;, he is a weasely politician. He is also mentioned in Robert Harris&#x27; &quot;Dictator&quot;, told from the perspective of Cicero&#x27;s secretary Tiro.

In the BBC/HBO TV series &quot;Rome&quot;, Lepidus (Ronan Vibert) is portrayed in the familiar way, as an inadequate rival for the powerhouses of Octavian and Antony. Much of his involvement in the second Triumvirate is barely mentioned in the series. No mention is made of his alliance with Antony and Caesar before the assassination. He is depicted as a general sent to defeat the weakened Antony after Mutina. His whole army immediately defects to his enemy. He appears sporadically as a barely-noticed participant in later discussions about future plans.

<text>Circumnavigation is the complete navigation around an entire island, continent, or astronomical body (e.g. a planet or moon). This article focuses on the circumnavigation of Earth.

The first circumnavigation of the Earth was the Magellan Expedition, which sailed from Sanlucar de Barrameda, Spain in 1519 and returned in 1522, after crossing the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. Since the rise of commercial aviation in the late 20th century, circumnavigating Earth is straightforward, usually taking days instead of years. Today, the challenge of circumnavigating Earth has shifted towards human and technological endurance, speed, and less conventional methods.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;circumnavigation&quot; is a noun formed from the verb &quot;circumnavigate&quot;, from the past participle of the Latin verb &quot;circumnavigare&quot;, from &quot;circum&quot; &quot;around&quot; + &quot;navigare&quot; &quot;to sail&quot;.

==Definition==
A person walking completely around either pole will cross all meridians, but this is not generally considered a &quot;circumnavigation&quot;. The path of a true (global) circumnavigation forms a continuous loop on the surface of Earth separating two regions of comparable area. A basic definition of a global circumnavigation would be a route which covers roughly a great circle, and in particular one which passes through at least one pair of points antipodal to each other. In practice, people use different definitions of world circumnavigation to accommodate practical constraints, depending on the method of travel. Since the planet is quasispheroidal, a trip from one Pole to the other, and back again on the other side, would technically be a circumnavigation. There are practical difficulties (namely, the Arctic ice pack and the Antarctic ice sheet) in such a voyage, although it was successfully undertaken in the early 1980s by Ranulph Fiennes.

==History==
The first circumnavigation was that of the ship &quot;Victoria&quot; between 1519 and 1522, now known as the Magellan–Elcano expedition. It was a Castilian (Spanish) voyage of discovery. The voyage started in Seville, crossed the Atlantic Ocean, andafter several stopsrounded the southern tip of South America, where the expedition named the Strait of Magellan. It then continued across the Pacific, discovering a number of islands on its way (including Guam), before arriving in the Philippines. The voyage was initially led by the Portuguese Ferdinand Magellan but he was killed on Mactan in the Philippines in 1521. The remaining sailors decided to circumnavigate the world instead of making the return voyageno passage east across the Pacific would be successful for four decadesand continued the voyage across the Indian Ocean, round the southern cape of Africa, north along Africa&#x27;s Atlantic coasts, and back to Spain in 1522. Of the 270 crew members who set out from Seville, only 18 were still with the expedition at the end including its surviving captain, the Spaniard Juan Sebastián Elcano. 

The next to circumnavigate the globe were the survivors of the Castilian/Spanish expedition of García Jofre de Loaísa between 1525 and 1536. None of the seven original ships of the Loaísa expedition nor its first four leadersLoaísa, Elcano, Salazar, and Íñiguezsurvived to complete the voyage. The last of the original ships, the , was sunk in 1526 in the East Indies (now Indonesia) by the Portuguese. Unable to press forward or retreat, Hernando de la Torre erected a fort on Tidore, received reinforcements under Alvaro de Saavedra that were similarly defeated, and finally surrendered to the Portuguese. In this way, a handful of survivors became the second group of circumnavigators when they were transported under guard to Lisbon in 1536. A third group came from the 117 survivors of the similarly failed Villalobos Expedition in the next decade; similarly ruined and starved, they were imprisoned by the Portuguese and transported back to Lisbon in 1546.

In 1577, Elizabeth I sent Francis Drake to start an expedition against the Spanish along the Pacific coast of the Americas. Drake set out from Plymouth, England in November 1577, aboard &quot;Pelican&quot;, which he renamed &quot;Golden Hind&quot; mid-voyage. In September 1578, the ship passed south of Tierra del Fuego, the southern tip of South America, through the area now known as the Drake Passage. In June 1579, Drake landed somewhere north of Spain&#x27;s northernmost claim in Alta California, presumably Drakes Bay. Drake completed the second complete circumnavigation of the world in a single vessel on September 1580, becoming the first commander to survive the entire circumnavigation.

Thomas Cavendish completed his circumnavigation between 1586 and 1588 in record timein two years and 49 days, nine months faster than Drake. It was also the first deliberately planned voyage of the globe.

Jeanne Baret is recognized as the first woman to have completed a voyage of circumnavigation of the globe, which she did via maritime transport. A key part of her journey was as a member of Louis Antoine de Bougainville&#x27;s expedition on the ships &quot;La Boudeuse&quot; and &quot;Étoile&quot; in 1766–1769.

Captain James Cook became the first navigator to record three circumnavigations through the Pacific aboard the &quot;Endeavour&quot; from 1769 to 1779. He was among the first to complete west–east circumnavigation in high latitudes.

For the wealthy, long voyages around the world, such as was done by Ulysses S. Grant, became possible in the 19th century, and the two World Wars moved vast numbers of troops around the planet. However, it was the rise of commercial aviation in the late 20th century that made circumnavigation, when compared to the Magellan–Elcano expedition, quicker and safer.

==Nautical==
The nautical global and fastest circumnavigation record is currently held by a wind-powered vessel, the trimaran IDEC 3. The record was established by six sailors: Francis Joyon, Alex Pella, Clément Surtel, Gwénolé Gahinet, Sébastien Audigane and Bernard Stamm. On 26 January, 2017, this crew finished circumnavigating the globe in 40 days, 23 hours, 30 minutes and 30 seconds. The absolute speed sailing record around the world followed the North Atlantic Ocean, Equator, South Atlantic Ocean, Southern Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, Equator, North Atlantic Ocean route in an easterly direction.

===Wind powered===
The map on the right shows, in red, a typical, non-competitive, route for a sailing circumnavigation of the world by the trade winds and the Suez and Panama canals; overlaid in yellow are the points antipodal to all points on the route. It can be seen that the route roughly approximates a great circle, and passes through two pairs of antipodal points. This is a route followed by many cruising sailors, going in the western direction; the use of the trade winds makes it a relatively easy sail, although it passes through a number of zones of calms or light winds.

In yacht racing, a round-the-world route approximating a great circle would be quite impractical, particularly in a non-stop race where use of the Panama and Suez Canals would be impossible. Yacht racing therefore defines a world circumnavigation to be a passage of at least 21,600 nautical miles (40,000 km) in length which crosses the equator, crosses every meridian and finishes in the same port as it starts. The second map on the right shows the route of the Vendée Globe round-the-world race in red; overlaid in yellow are the points antipodal to all points on the route. It can be seen that the route does not pass through any pairs of antipodal points. Since the winds in the higher southern latitudes predominantly blow west-to-east it can be seen that there are an easier route (west-to-east) and a harder route (east-to-west) when circumnavigating by sail; this difficulty is magnified for square-rig vessels due to the square rig&#x27;s dramatic lack of upwind ability when compared to a more modern Bermuda rig.

For around the world sailing records, there is a rule saying that the length must be at least 21,600 nautical miles calculated along the shortest possible track from the starting port and back that does not cross land and does not go below 63°S. It is allowed to have one single waypoint to lengthen the calculated track. The equator must be crossed.

The solo wind powered circumnavigation record of 42 days, 16 hours, 40 minutes and 35 seconds was established by François Gabart on the maxi-multihull sailing yacht MACIF and completed on 7 December 2017. The voyage followed the North Atlantic Ocean, Equator, South Atlantic Ocean, Southern Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, Equator, North Atlantic Ocean route in an easterly direction.

===Mechanically powered===
Since the advent of world cruises in 1922, by Cunard&#x27;s &quot;Laconia&quot;, thousands of people have completed circumnavigations of the globe at a more leisurely pace. Typically, these voyages begin in New York City or Southampton, and proceed westward. Routes vary, either travelling through the Caribbean and then into the Pacific Ocean via the Panama Canal, or around Cape Horn. From there ships usually make their way to Hawaii, the islands of the South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, then northward to Hong Kong, South East Asia, and India. At that point, again, routes may vary: one way is through the Suez Canal and into the Mediterranean; the other is around Cape of Good Hope and then up the west coast of Africa. These cruises end in the port where they began.

In 1960, the American nuclear-powered submarine USS &quot;Triton&quot; circumnavigated the globe in 60 days, 21 hours for Operation Sandblast.

The current circumnavigation record in a powered boat of 60 days 23 hours and 49 minutes was established by a voyage of the wave-piercing trimaran &quot;Earthrace&quot; which was completed on 27 June 2008. The voyage followed the North Atlantic Ocean, Panama Canal, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Suez Canal, Mediterranean Sea route in a westerly direction.

==Aviation==

In 1922 Norman Macmillan (RAF officer), Major W T Blake and Geoffrey Malins made an unsuccessful attempt to fly a &quot;Daily News&quot;-sponsored round-the-world flight. The first aerial circumnavigation of the planet was flown in 1924 by aviators of the U.S. Army Air Service in a quartet of Douglas World Cruiser biplanes. The first non-stop aerial circumnavigation of the planet was flown in 1949 by Lucky Lady II, a United States Air Force Boeing B-50 Superfortress.

Since the development of commercial aviation, there are regular routes that circle the globe, such as Pan American Flight One (and later United Airlines Flight One). Today planning such a trip through commercial flight connections is simple.

The first lighter-than-air aircraft of any type to circumnavigate under its own power was the rigid airship LZ 127 &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, which did so in 1929.

Aviation records take account of the wind circulation patterns of the world; in particular the jet streams, which circulate in the northern and southern hemispheres without crossing the equator. There is therefore no requirement to cross the equator, or to pass through two antipodal points, in the course of setting a round-the-world aviation record.

For powered aviation, the course of a round-the-world record must start and finish at the same point and cross all meridians; the course must be at least long (which is approximately the length of the Tropic of Cancer). The course must include set control points at latitudes outside the Arctic and Antarctic circles.

In ballooning, which is at the mercy of the winds, the requirements are even more relaxed. The course must cross all meridians, and must include a set of checkpoints which are all outside of two circles, chosen by the pilot, having radii of and enclosing the poles (though not necessarily centred on them). For example, Steve Fossett&#x27;s global circumnavigation by balloon was entirely contained within the southern hemisphere.

==Astronautics==
The first person to fly in space, Yuri Gagarin, also became the first person to complete an orbital spaceflight in the Vostok 1 spaceship within 2 hours on April 12 1961. The flight started at 63° E, 45 N and ended at 45° E 51° N; thus Gagarin did not circumnavigate Earth completely.

Gherman Titov in the Vostok 2 was the first human to fully circumnavigate Earth in spaceflight and made 17.5 orbits on August 6, 1961.

==Human-powered==
According to adjudicating bodies &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; and Explorersweb, Jason Lewis completed the first human-powered circumnavigation of the globe on 6 October 2007. This was part of a thirteen-year journey entitled Expedition 360.

In 2012, Turkish-born American adventurer Erden Eruç completed the first entirely &quot;solo&quot; human-powered circumnavigation, travelling by rowboat, sea kayak, foot and bicycle from 10 July 2007 to 21 July 2012, crossing the equator twice, passing over 12 antipodal points, and logging in 1,026 days of travel time, excluding breaks.

National Geographic lists Colin Angus as being the first to complete a human-powered global circumnavigation in 2006. However, his journey did not cross the equator or hit the minimum of two antipodal points as stipulated by the rules of &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; and AdventureStats by Explorersweb.

People have both bicycled and run around the world, but the oceans have had to be covered by air or sea travel, making the distance shorter than the &quot;Guinness&quot; guidelines. To go from North America to Asia on foot is theoretically possible but very difficult. It involves crossing the Bering Strait on the ice, and around of roadless swamped or freezing cold areas in Alaska and eastern Russia. No one has so far travelled all of this route by foot. David Kunst was the first person that Guinness verified to have walked around the world between 20 June 1970 and 5 October 1974, by &quot;[walking] 23,250 km (14,450 miles) through four continents&quot;.

<text>Aeroelasticity is the branch of physics and engineering studying the interactions between the inertial, elastic, and aerodynamic forces occurring while an elastic body is exposed to a fluid flow. The study of aeroelasticity may be broadly classified into two fields: &quot;static aeroelasticity&quot; dealing with the static or steady state response of an elastic body to a fluid flow, and &quot;dynamic aeroelasticity&quot; dealing with the body&#x27;s dynamic (typically vibrational) response.

Aircraft are prone to aeroelastic effects because they need to be lightweight while enduring large aerodynamic loads. Aircraft are designed to avoid the following aeroelastic problems:
# divergence where the aerodynamic forces increase the twist of a wing which further increases forces; 
# control reversal where control activation produces an opposite aerodynamic moment that reduces, or in extreme cases reverses, the control effectiveness; and 
# flutter which is uncontained vibration that can lead to the destruction of an aircraft.

Aeroelasticity problems can be prevented by adjusting the mass, stiffness or aerodynamics of structures which can be determined and verified through the use of calculations, &quot;ground vibration tests&quot; and &quot;flight flutter trials&quot;. Flutter of control surfaces is usually eliminated by the careful placement of &quot;mass balances&quot;.

The synthesis of aeroelasticity with thermodynamics is known as &quot;aerothermoelasticity&quot;, and its synthesis with control theory is known as &quot;aeroservoelasticity&quot;.

== History ==
The second failure of Samuel Langley&#x27;s prototype plane on the Potomac was attributed to aeroelastic effects (specifically, torsional divergence). An early scientific work on the subject was George Bryan&#x27;s &quot;Theory of the Stability of a Rigid Aeroplane&quot; published in 1906. Problems with torsional divergence plagued aircraft in the First World War and were solved largely by trial-and-error and ad hoc stiffening of the wing. The first recorded and documented case of flutter in an aircraft was that which occurred to a Handley Page O/400 bomber during a flight in 1916, when it suffered a violent tail oscillation, which caused extreme distortion of the rear fuselage and the elevators to move asymmetrically. Although the aircraft landed safely, in the subsequent investigation F. W. Lanchester was consulted. One of his recommendations was that left and right elevators should be rigidly connected by a stiff shaft, which was to subsequently become a design requirement. In addition, the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) was asked to investigate the phenomenon theoretically, which was subsequently carried out by Leonard Bairstow and Arthur Fage.

In 1926, Hans Reissner published a theory of wing divergence, leading to much further theoretical research on the subject. The term &quot;aeroelasticity&quot; itself was coined by Harold Roxbee Cox and Alfred Pugsley at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), Farnborough in the early 1930s.

In the development of aeronautical engineering at Caltech, Theodore von Kármán started a course &quot;Elasticity applied to Aeronautics&quot;. After teaching the course for one term, Kármán passed it over to Ernest Edwin Sechler, who developed aeroelasticity in that course and in publication of textbooks on the subject.

In 1947, Arthur Roderick Collar defined aeroelasticity as &quot;the study of the mutual interaction that takes place within the triangle of the inertial, elastic, and aerodynamic forces acting on structural members exposed to an airstream, and the influence of this study on design&quot;.

== Static aeroelasticity ==
In an aeroplane, two significant static aeroelastic effects may occur. &quot;Divergence&quot; is a phenomenon in which the elastic twist of the wing suddenly becomes theoretically infinite, typically causing the wing to fail. &quot;Control reversal&quot; is a phenomenon occurring only in wings with ailerons or other control surfaces, in which these control surfaces reverse their usual functionality (e.g., the rolling direction associated with a given aileron moment is reversed).

=== Divergence ===
Divergence occurs when a lifting surface deflects under aerodynamic load in a direction which further increases lift in a positive feedback loop. The increased lift deflects the structure further, which eventually brings the structure to the point of divergence. Unlike flutter, which is another aeroelastic problem, instead of irregular oscillations, divergence causes the lifting surface to move in the same direction and when it comes to point of divergence the structure deforms.
=== Control reversal ===

Control surface reversal is the loss (or reversal) of the expected response of a control surface, due to deformation of the main lifting surface. For simple models (e.g. single aileron on an Euler-Bernoulli beam), control reversal speeds can be derived analytically as for torsional divergence. Control reversal can be used to aerodynamic advantage, and forms part of the Kaman servo-flap rotor design.

== Dynamic aeroelasticity ==
Dynamic aeroelasticity studies the interactions among aerodynamic, elastic, and inertial forces. Examples of dynamic aeroelastic phenomena are:

=== Flutter ===
Flutter is a dynamic instability of an elastic structure in a fluid flow, caused by positive feedback between the body&#x27;s deflection and the force exerted by the fluid flow. In a linear system, &quot;flutter point&quot; is the point at which the structure is undergoing simple harmonic motion—zero net damping—and so any further decrease in net damping will result in a self-oscillation and eventual failure. &quot;Net damping&quot; can be understood as the sum of the structure&#x27;s natural positive damping and the negative damping of the aerodynamic force. Flutter can be classified into two types: &quot;hard flutter&quot;, in which the net damping decreases very suddenly, very close to the flutter point; and &quot;soft flutter&quot;, in which the net damping decreases gradually.

In water the mass ratio of the pitch inertia of the foil to that of the circumscribing cylinder of fluid is generally too low for binary flutter to occur, as shown by explicit solution of the simplest pitch and heave flutter stability determinant.
Structures exposed to aerodynamic forces—including wings and aerofoils, but also chimneys and bridges—are generally designed carefully within known parameters to avoid flutter. Blunt shapes, such as chimneys, can give off a continuous stream of vortices known as a Kármán vortex street, which can induce structural oscillations. Strakes are typically wrapped around chimneys to stop the formation of these vortices.

In complex structures where both the aerodynamics and the mechanical properties of the structure are not fully understood, flutter can be discounted only through detailed testing. Even changing the mass distribution of an aircraft or the stiffness of one component can induce flutter in an apparently unrelated aerodynamic component. At its mildest, this can appear as a &quot;buzz&quot; in the aircraft structure, but at its most violent, it can develop uncontrollably with great speed and cause serious damage to the aircraft or lead to its destruction, as in Northwest Airlines Flight 2 in 1938, Braniff Flight 542 in 1959, or the prototypes for Finland&#x27;s VL Myrsky fighter aircraft in the early 1940s. Famously, the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge was destroyed as a result of aeroelastic fluttering.

==== Aeroservoelasticity ====
In some cases, automatic control systems have been demonstrated to help prevent or limit flutter-related structural vibration.

==== Propeller whirl flutter ====
&quot;Propeller whirl flutter&quot; is a special case of flutter involving the aerodynamic and inertial effects of a rotating propeller and the stiffness of the supporting nacelle structure. Dynamic instability can occur involving pitch and yaw degrees of freedom of the propeller and the engine supports leading to an unstable precession of the propeller. Failure of the engine supports led to whirl flutter occurring on two Lockheed L-188 Electra aircraft, in 1959 on Braniff Flight 542 and again in 1960 on Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 710.

==== Transonic aeroelasticity ====
Flow is highly non-linear in the transonic regime, dominated by moving shock waves. Avoiding flutter is mission-critical for aircraft that fly through transonic Mach numbers. The role of shock waves was first analyzed by Holt Ashley. A phenomenon that impacts stability of aircraft known as &quot;transonic dip&quot;, in which the flutter speed can get close to flight speed, was reported in May 1976 by Farmer and Hanson of the Langley Research Center.

=== Buffeting ===

Buffeting is a high-frequency instability, caused by airflow separation or shock wave oscillations from one object striking another. It is caused by a sudden impulse of load increasing. It is a random forced vibration. Generally it affects the tail unit of the aircraft structure due to air flow downstream of the wing.

The methods for buffet detection are:
# Pressure coefficient diagram
# Pressure divergence at trailing edge
# Computing separation from trailing edge based on Mach number
# Normal force fluctuating divergence

== Prediction and cure ==

In the period 1950–1970, AGARD developed the &quot;Manual on Aeroelasticity&quot; which details the processes used in solving and verifying aeroelastic problems along with standard examples that can be used to test numerical solutions.

Aeroelasticity involves not just the external aerodynamic loads and the way they change but also the structural, damping and mass characteristics of the aircraft. Prediction involves making a mathematical model of the aircraft as a series of masses connected by springs and dampers which are tuned to represent the dynamic characteristics of the aircraft structure. The model also includes details of applied aerodynamic forces and how they vary.

The model can be used to predict the flutter margin and, if necessary, test fixes to potential problems. Small carefully chosen changes to mass distribution and local structural stiffness can be very effective in solving aeroelastic problems.

Methods of predicting flutter in linear structures include the &quot;p-method&quot;, the &quot;k-method&quot; and the &quot;p-k method&quot;.

For nonlinear systems, flutter is usually interpreted as a limit cycle oscillation (LCO), and methods from the study of dynamical systems can be used to determine the speed at which flutter will occur.

== Media ==
These videos detail the Active Aeroelastic Wing two-phase NASA-Air Force flight research program to investigate the potential of aerodynamically twisting flexible wings to improve maneuverability of high-performance aircraft at transonic and supersonic speeds, with traditional control surfaces such as ailerons and leading-edge flaps used to induce the twist.

<text>Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is a sudden and momentary flow of electric current between two differently-charged objects when brought close together or when the dielectric between them breaks down, often creating a visible spark associated with the static electricity between the objects.

ESD can create spectacular electric sparks (lightning, with the accompanying sound of thunder, is an example of a large-scale ESD event), but also less dramatic forms which may be neither seen nor heard, yet still be large enough to cause damage to sensitive electronic devices. Electric sparks require a field strength above approximately 4 × 106 V/m in air, as notably occurs in lightning strikes. Other forms of ESD include corona discharge from sharp electrodes, brush discharge from blunt electrodes, etc.

ESD can cause harmful effects of importance in industry, including explosions in gas, fuel vapor and coal dust, as well as failure of solid state electronics components such as integrated circuits. These can suffer permanent damage when subjected to high voltages. Electronics manufacturers therefore establish electrostatic protective areas free of static, using measures to prevent charging, such as avoiding highly charging materials and measures to remove static such as grounding human workers, providing antistatic devices, and controlling humidity.

ESD simulators may be used to test electronic devices, for example with a human body model or a charged device model.

== Causes == 
One of the causes of ESD events is static electricity. Static electricity is often generated through tribocharging, the separation of electric charges that occurs when two materials are brought into contact and then separated. Examples of tribocharging include walking on a rug, rubbing a plastic comb against dry hair, rubbing a balloon against a sweater, ascending from a fabric car seat, or removing some types of plastic packaging. In all these cases, the breaking of contact between two materials results in tribocharging, thus creating a difference of electrical potential that can lead to an ESD event.

Another cause of ESD damage is through electrostatic induction. This occurs when an electrically charged object is placed near a conductive object isolated from the ground. The presence of the charged object creates an electrostatic field that causes electrical charges on the surface of the other object to redistribute. Even though the net electrostatic charge of the object has not changed, it now has regions of excess positive and negative charges. An ESD event may occur when the object comes into contact with a conductive path. For example, charged regions on the surfaces of styrofoam cups or bags can induce potential on nearby ESD sensitive components via electrostatic induction and an ESD event may occur if the component is touched with a metallic tool.

ESD can also be caused by energetic charged particles impinging on an object. This causes increasing surface and deep charging. This is a known hazard for most spacecraft.

== Types ==
Electrostatic discharge (ESD) phenomena vary in complexity and magnitude, with the electric spark being the most visible and dramatic example. This occurs when a strong electric field ionizes the air, creating a conductive channel that can convey an electric current. People may experience this as a small jolt of discomfort, but ESD can inflict severe damage on electronic components, potentially leading to malfunctions and failures. In hazardous environments where flammable gases or dust particles are present, ESD can trigger fires or explosions.

Not all ESD events, however, are accompanied by a visible spark or noise. It is possible for a person to carry a charge that, while undetectable to the human senses, can still be potent enough to harm delicate electronics. Some components can be compromised by discharges as faint as 30 V, with such damage sometimes not becoming apparent until significant usage has occurred, thus affecting the lifespan and performance of the devices.

Cable discharge events (CDEs) are discharges occurring when connecting electrical cables to a device.

=== Sparks ===

A spark is triggered when the electric field strength exceeds approximately 4–30 kV/cmthe dielectric field strength of air. This may cause a very rapid increase in the number of free electrons and ions in the air, temporarily causing the air to abruptly become an electrical conductor in a process called dielectric breakdown.

Perhaps the best known example of a natural spark is lightning. In this case the electric potential between a cloud and ground, or between two clouds, is typically hundreds of millions of volts. The resulting current that cycles through the stroke channel causes an enormous transfer of energy. On a much smaller scale, sparks can form in air during electrostatic discharges from charged objects that are charged to as little as 380 V (Paschen&#x27;s law).

Earth&#x27;s atmosphere consists of 21% oxygen (O2) and 78% nitrogen (N2). During an electrostatic discharge, such as a lightning flash, the affected atmospheric molecules become electrically overstressed. The diatomic oxygen molecules are split, and then recombine to form ozone (O3), which is unstable, or reacts with metals and organic matter. If the electrical stress is high enough, nitrogen oxides (NOx) can form. Both products are toxic to animals, and nitrogen oxides are essential for nitrogen fixation. Ozone attacks all organic matter by ozonolysis and is used in water purification.

Sparks are an ignition source in combustible environments that may lead to catastrophic explosions in concentrated fuel environments. Most explosions can be traced back to a tiny electrostatic discharge, whether it was an unexpected combustible fuel leak invading a known open air sparking device, or an unexpected spark in a known fuel rich environment. The result is the same if oxygen is present and the three criteria of the fire triangle have been combined.

== Damage prevention in electronics ==
Many electronic components, especially integrated circuits and microchips, can be damaged by ESD. Sensitive components need to be protected during and after manufacture, during shipping and device assembly, and in the finished device. Grounding is especially important for effective ESD control. It should be clearly defined, and regularly evaluated.

===Protection during manufacturing===

In manufacturing, prevention of ESD is based on an Electrostatic Discharge Protected Area (EPA). The EPA can be a small workstation or a large manufacturing area. The main principle of an EPA is that there are no highly-charging materials in the vicinity of ESD sensitive electronics, all conductive and dissipative materials are grounded, workers are grounded, and charge build-up on ESD sensitive electronics is prevented. International standards are used to define a typical EPA and can be found for example from International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) or American National Standards Institute (ANSI).

ESD prevention within an EPA may include using appropriate ESD-safe packing material, the use of conductive filaments on garments worn by assembly workers, conducting wrist straps and foot-straps to prevent high voltages from accumulating on workers&#x27; bodies, anti-static mats or conductive flooring materials to conduct harmful electric charges away from the work area, and humidity control. Humid conditions prevent electrostatic charge generation because the thin layer of moisture that accumulates on most surfaces serves to dissipate electric charges.

Ionizers are used especially when insulative materials cannot be grounded. Ionization systems help to neutralize charged surface regions on insulative or dielectric materials. Insulating materials prone to triboelectric charging of more than 2,000 V should be kept away at least 12 inches from sensitive devices to prevent accidental charging of devices through field induction. On aircraft, static dischargers are used on the trailing edges of wings and other surfaces.

Manufacturers and users of integrated circuits must take precautions to avoid ESD. ESD prevention can be part of the device itself and include special design techniques for device input and output pins. External protection components can also be used with circuit layout.

Due to dielectric nature of electronics component and assemblies, electrostatic charging cannot be completely prevented during handling of devices. Most of ESD sensitive electronic assemblies and components are also so small that manufacturing and handling is done with automated equipment. ESD prevention activities are therefore important with those processes where components come into direct contact with equipment surfaces. In addition, it is important to prevent ESD when an electrostatic discharge sensitive component is connected with other conductive parts of the product itself. An efficient way to prevent ESD is to use materials that are not too conductive but will slowly conduct static charges away. These materials are called static dissipative and have resistivity values below 1012 ohm-meters. Materials in automated manufacturing which will touch on conductive areas of ESD sensitive electronic should be made of dissipative material, and the dissipative material must be grounded. These special materials are able to conduct electricity, but do so very slowly. Any built-up static charges dissipate without the sudden discharge that can harm the internal structure of silicon circuits.

===Protection during transit===

Sensitive devices need to be protected during shipping, handling, and storage. The buildup and discharge of static can be minimized by controlling the surface resistance and volume resistivity of packaging materials. Packaging is also designed to minimize frictional or triboelectric charging of packs due to rubbing together during shipping, and it may be necessary to incorporate electrostatic or electromagnetic shielding in the packaging material. A common example is that semiconductor devices and computer components are usually shipped in an antistatic bag made of a partially conductive plastic, which acts as a Faraday cage to protect the contents against ESD.

==Simulation and testing for electronic devices==

For testing the susceptibility of electronic devices to ESD from human contact, an ESD Simulator with a special output circuit, called the human body model (HBM) is often used. This consists of a capacitor in series with a resistor. The capacitor is charged to a specified high voltage from an external source, and then suddenly discharged through the resistor into an electrical terminal of the device under test. One of the most widely used models is defined in the JEDEC 22-A114-B standard, which specifies a 100 picofarad capacitor and a 1,500 ohm resistor. Other similar standards are MIL-STD-883 Method 3015, and the ESD Association&#x27;s ESD STM5.1. For compliance to European Union standards for Information Technology Equipment, the IEC/EN 61000-4-2 test specification is used. Another specification referenced by equipment maker Schaffner calls for C = 150 pF and R = 330 Ω which provides high fidelity results. While the theory is mostly there, very few companies measure the real ESD survival rate. Guidelines and requirements are given for test cell geometries, generator specifications, test levels, discharge rate and waveform, types and points of discharge on the &quot;victim&quot; product, and functional criteria for gauging product survivability.

A charged device model (CDM) test is used to define the ESD a device can withstand when the device itself has an electrostatic charge and discharges due to metal contact. This discharge type is the most common type of ESD in electronic devices and causes most of the ESD damages in their manufacturing. CDM discharge depends mainly on parasitic parameters of the discharge and strongly depends on size and type of component package. One of the most widely used CDM simulation test models is defined by the JEDEC.

Other standardized ESD test circuits include the machine model (MM) and transmission line pulse (TLP).

<doc id="75053" wikidata="Q715380" url="?curid=75053" title="First Triumvirate">
<text>The First Triumvirate was an informal political alliance among three prominent politicians in the late Roman Republic: Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, Marcus Licinius Crassus, and Gaius Julius Caesar. The republican constitution had many veto points. In order to bypass constitutional obstacles and force through the political goals of the three men, they forged an alliance in secret where they promised to use their respective influence to support each other. The &quot;triumvirate&quot; was not a formal magistracy, nor did it achieve a lasting domination over state affairs.

It was formed among the three men due to their mutual need to overcome opposition in the senate against their proposals in the previous years. Initially secret, it emerged publicly during Caesar&#x27;s first consulship in 59 BC to push through legislation for the three allies. Caesar secured passage of an agrarian law which helped resettle Pompey&#x27;s veterans, a law ratifying Pompey&#x27;s settlements after the Third Mithridatic War, and legislation on provincial administration and tax collection. Caesar also was placed in a long-term governorship in Gaul. The early success of the alliance, however, triggered substantial political backlash. Political alliances at Rome reorganised to counterbalance the three men in the coming years.

By 55 BC, the alliance was fraying. The three men, however, came together in mutual interest to renew their pact. By force and with political disruption aided by their allies, they delayed consular elections into 55 BC and intimidated the &quot;comitia&quot; into electing Pompey and Crassus again as consuls. Caesar&#x27;s command in Gaul was then renewed for another five years; plum provincial commands placed Pompey in Spain and Crassus in Syria. Amid even stronger backlash at Rome against the use of naked force and chaos to achieve political ends, Crassus died in 53 BC during his failed invasion of Parthia.

Caesar and Pompey, the two remaining allies, maintained friendly relations for a few years. They remained allies even after Pompey&#x27;s assumption of a sole consulship in 52 BC and the death of Julia (Caesar&#x27;s daughter and Pompey&#x27;s wife). Pompey, however, moved to form alliances to counterbalance Caesar&#x27;s influence after Crassus&#x27; death. These drew him slowly into a policy of confrontation with Caesar. Deteriorating trust through 50 BC, along with the influence of Catonian anti-Caesarian hardliners on Pompey, eventually pushed Caesar into open rebellion in January 49 BC.

== Naming ==
The term &quot;First Triumvirate&quot;, while well-known, is a misleading one which is regularly avoided by modern scholars of the late republic. Boards of a certain number of men such as decemviri were a feature of Roman administration, but this alliance was not one of them. The term appears nowhere in any ancient source, refers to no official position, and is &quot;completely and obviously erroneous&quot;. In the ancient world, the triple alliance was referred to with varying terms: Cicero, contemporaneously, wrote of &quot;three men&quot; (&quot;tris homines&quot;) exercising a &quot;regnum&quot;; a satire by Marcus Terentius Varro called it a &quot;three-headed monster&quot;; later historians such as Suetonius and Livy referred to the three as a &quot;societas&quot; or &quot;conspiratio&quot;; the allies themselves &quot;would presumably have referred to it simply as &quot;amicitia&quot;&quot;.

The usage of the term &quot;triumvirate&quot; to describe this political alliance was unattested during the Renaissance. First attested in 1681, the term emerged into widespread use only during the 18th century; for some time, knowledge that the term was a modern coinage was unknown, &quot;revealed&quot; only in 1807. By the 19th century, usage was somewhat regular – mostly in English and French sources, though not in German ones, – usually prefaced with clarifications that the term did not refer to any official position.

More recently, scholars have started to avoid the term in publications altogether. Harriet Flower in &quot;Roman Republics&quot; writes that &quot;First Triumvirate&quot; is &quot;misleading in equating the position of the 50s with the official triumvirate of Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian&quot;, preferring &quot;alliance&quot; and &quot;Big Three&quot;. Books by Andrew Lintott and Richard Billows also have avoided invocation of &quot;First Triumvirate&quot;. Others add more reasons to avoid its use, for example, Robert Morstein-Marx in the 2021 book &quot;Julius Caesar and the Roman People&quot;, &quot;it is almost impossible to use the phrase &#x27;First Triumvirate&#x27; without adopting some version of the view that it was a kind of conspiracy against the republic... Nomenclature matters... I eschew the traditional &#x27;First Triumvirate&#x27; altogether&quot;. Classicists writing for more general audience also have shied away from use of the term &quot;First Triumvirate&quot;. Mary Beard, for example, uses &quot;Gang of Three&quot; in her 2015 book &quot;SPQR&quot;. Yet others, such as Adrian Goldsworthy, have not, staying with the traditional nomenclature while explaining that the term is inaccurate.

The fourth edition of the &quot;Oxford Classical Dictionary&quot;, for example, similarly says &quot;the coalition formed between Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus in 60 BCE was wholly unofficial and never described at the time as a triumvirate... &#x27;First&#x27; and &#x27;Second Triumvirate&#x27; are modern and misleading terms&quot;.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
The alliance between Pompey, Crassus, and Caesar emerged due to their failure to pass various core portions of their programmes in the gridlocked state of Roman politics in the years before 60 BC. All three had wanted something but were stymied by their rivals in the senate and assemblies.

==== Pompey ====
Pompey, having returned two years earlier from the Third Mithridatic War, wanted ratification of his peace settlements in the east. He also sought lands for his veterans to retire on. After Pompey&#x27;s return from the Sertorian War from Hispania in 71 BC, he had been able secure a similar bill distributing land to his veterans; he also had sent subordinates back to Rome to stand for the tribunate in attempts to bring the relevant legislation forward (an attempt in 63 BC was opposed by then-consul Cicero in &quot;De lege agraria&quot;). Further attempts in 62 BC had led to his allied tribune fleeing the city. While he was successful in getting one of his men, Marcus Pupius Piso Frugi Calpurnianus, elected consul for 61 BC, an intervening religious scandal had made it impossible for him to push forward the appropriate land resettlement legislation. Through massive bribes, Pompey also secured the election of more of his men to offices in 60 BC (Lucius Afranius as consul; Lucius Flavius as one of the plebeian tribunes), but they too were stymied. Cato the Younger and Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer, motivated in part by their dislike of Pompey&#x27;s having previously and irregularly displaced their friend Lucullus from a previous command against Mithridates, Pompey&#x27;s recent divorce of Celer&#x27;s half-sister in a failed attempt to form a marriage alliance with Cato, and also by their fear of Pompey&#x27;s power, led to an obstructive coalition. Lucullus returned from his semi-retirement to demand an in-depth review of every aspect of Pompey&#x27;s eastern arrangements; &quot;this would take a tremendous amount of time and would prevent passage of the bill for the foreseeable future&quot;. Without capable allies in the magistracies – both Piso and Afranius were ineffective – Pompey was forced to look elsewhere for allies.

==== Crassus ====
Crassus was one of the richest men in Rome, having made his fortune by profiting from the Sullan proscriptions. He was a patron for Rome&#x27;s equestrian businessmen. With Pompey, he had served as consul in 70 BC. Those public contractors had massively over-bid on tax contracts for the province of Asia (parts of modern western Turkey) because they failed to account for the devastation of the Third Mithridatic War. His clients demanded a reduction in the taxes they were contractually obliged to deliver to the treasury, a goal also stymied by Cato and Celer in December 61 BC. While senators such as Cicero personally believed &quot;it was ridiculous for [the tax farmers] to seek to have their contracts renegotiated or cancelled simply because they had overestimated their potential profits&quot;, the senate had been on the verge of approving the legislation before Celer&#x27;s intervention. Crassus, a personal enemy of Pompey, also opposed Pompey&#x27;s settlements and land bills in 60 BC, successfully mobilising his support among the lower-ranked senators to defeat Pompey&#x27;s proposals. His opposition to Pompey may have been in attempt to win over the senators blocking his own goals, but this was evidently unsuccessful. Passing renegotiation of these tax contracts was vital for Crassus: &quot;his reputation and influence depended on his ability to act as a champion for the powerful equestrian order&quot;.

==== Caesar ====
Caesar in 60 BC was the recently returning governor of Hispania Ulterior. At this point, he was the least powerful of the three, although he had, in an upset, won election as pontifex maximus in 63 BC. Energetic and a capable supporter of Pompey for the last decade, he was also indebted to Crassus, who was a guarantor of Caesar&#x27;s debts. Upon his early return from Spain in June 60 BC, he was forced to choose between entering the city to declare candidacy for the consulship, which would dissolve his military command and make him ineligible for a triumph, or staying outside of the city in an attempt to work a triumph from the senate. While the senate had regularly permitted candidacies &quot;in absentia&quot;, Cato filibustered Caesar&#x27;s request; Caesar, shockingly, gave up his triumphal eligibility to declare his candidacy. Caesar was the known favorite for the consulship; to hobble him, Cato and his allies took two actions. They sought to assign the yet-to-be-elected consuls of 59 BC to home defence in Italy and sought the election of an uncooperative consular colleague. In both respects, they were successful: the consuls of 59 received commands that put them in a holding pattern and Cato secured election of his son-in-law and a personal enemy of Caesar&#x27;s, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, as Caesar&#x27;s co-consul. Caesar won his election handily, but to turn his provincial assignment into glory and defeat Bibulus&#x27; obstruction, he would need allies.

==== Timing ====
Scholars have debated the specific date at which the alliance was formed. Plutarch, Livy, and Appian placed the formation of the alliance before Caesar&#x27;s election; Vellius, Suetonius and Cassius Dio instead put its formation after his election.

During the elections to the consulship, Caesar certainly received support from both Pompey and Crassus, though &quot;each for his own reasons... Crassus cultivated promising adherents[;] Pompey needed a strong figure in the consulship&quot;. Against the later literary sources, however, a contemporaneous letter to Cicero, where Caesar asked to form a political alliance, also implies Caesar had not yet reconciled Pompey and Crassus by December of 60, months after his election in the summer. Erich Gruen, in &quot;Last Generation of the Roman Republic&quot;, believes this letter, combined with the fact that Pompey and Crassus would have alienated each-other with any overt support for Caesar&#x27;s candidacy, places the alliance&#x27;s formation decisively after Caesar&#x27;s consular election. Some historians believe Caesar, in his letter to Cicero, may have been coy (&quot;it may also be that Caesar was not yet showing Cicero all of his cards&quot;) but it did show that Caesar &quot;was not specifically looking at building a triumvirate, but rather was looking to build as strong a coalition as possible&quot;. This evidence – especially disclosure that a pact was sought – places the formation of the alliance some time between July 60 and January 59 BC.

The purpose of the alliance was to secure something that none of the three men could secure alone. If Pompey and Caesar aligned alone, they would not likely be able to overcome opposition to Pompey&#x27;s proposals in the senate. Pompey and Crassus were personal rivals who could only align through an intermediary. Caesar was that intermediary. Crassus&#x27; motives are less clear. He must have wanted more than simply renegotiation of tax contracts. Crassus&#x27; additionally would be one of the administrators for the Pompeian land grants and, in doing so, &quot;the preeminence which Crassus could not quite attain on his own [came] within his grasp&quot;. Caesar needed the alliance as well: he would fully become his own man, &quot;escap[ing] the subordinate stature of Pompey&#x27;s other &quot;amici&quot;&quot;, defeat the political opposition, and win a profitable command.

=== Caesar&#x27;s consulship, 59 BC ===

==== Agrarian law ====
It was well known prior to Caesar&#x27;s assumption of the consulship with the new year that he would propose a &quot;lex agraria&quot;. With powerful and secret political allies, Caesar started his consulship of 59 BC relatively traditionally. After ordering that minutes of the senate&#x27;s debates be published, he published a draft proposal for a &quot;lex Julia agraria&quot; and set it on the senate&#x27;s agenda. He took a conciliatory approach, respecting the normal order of the senate and also writing a bill that rectified all the criticisms to Rullus&#x27; land bill in 63 BC (Cicero opposed that bill in &quot;De lege agraria&quot;): Caesar would preserve public lands in Campania, repopulate desolate areas of Italy, move citizens from Rome onto the land (reducing the chance of riots), distribute credit for the bill among twenty commissioners (of which Caesar was not to be one), purchase property for redistribution only from willing sellers based on censorial assessments, pay for the entire project from monies won by Pompey, and extend the land grants to Pompey&#x27;s veterans in return for their service.

Caesar had the bill read out line-by-line and promised to make any changes needed to receive the assent of the senate. Little reasoned opposition emerged. In general, that an agrarian bill was desirable and &quot;well justified... could not reasonably be denied... many senators must have felt that it was not high time to make good on the promise made long ago to the long-suffering veterans&quot;. Some ancient sources describe Caesar&#x27;s conciliatory tone as a cynical plot to roll over the senators; Caesar&#x27;s goal may have been to provide the senators an opportunity to &quot;adopt symbolic leadership and demonstrate its solicitude for the interests... of the people... [giving] the body a chance to co-opt the cause of agrarian legislation in its own favour&quot;.

Whether a cynical ploy or not, the senate voiced little opposition until the speaking order eventually wound its way to Cato; Cato immediately started a filibuster, arguing instead that the people would be too gracious to Caesar for bringing the bill and that the current situation was fine. The extent to which Caesar&#x27;s prestige during his first consulship was a topic of debate is unclear; the later sources may here be injecting their knowledge of Caesar&#x27;s later victories into the narrative. Caesar, seeking to break the filibuster, therefore threatened to have Cato sent to the &quot;carcer&quot;, Rome&#x27;s small jail, which elicited mass indignation from the senators. In doing so, Cato succeeded in provoking Caesar into giving credence to Cato&#x27;s claims that Caesar was a would-be tyrant. Recognising the mistake, Caesar quickly had Cato released. After facing these hurdles in the senate, Caesar moved to bring the agrarian law before the people on his own authority, without senatorial consent.

Moving to the forum, Caesar summoned a &quot;contio&quot; (a meeting wherein a magistrate would address the people) where he requested Bibulus explain his opposition. When Bibulus failed to articulate any meaningful objections, beyond that &quot;he would not permit any innovation&quot;, Caesar pled with him before the people, leading Bibulus to exclaim in frustration that &quot;you will not have this law this year, not even should you all want it!&quot;, a violation of the norm of popular sovereignty. Seeking to avoid a tribunician veto, Caesar exposed his alliance, summoning Pompey and Crassus. Pompey, when asked what he would do if opponents should use violence to disrupt the bill&#x27;s passage, said &quot;he would provide a shield if anyone dared to raise a sword in opposition&quot;. Bibulus responded by mobilising three tribunes to veto the bill (alternatively, he may have wanted to declare bad omens to prevent voting, or both). During the attempt, he was assaulted by a mob, which threw him from the rostra and broke his &quot;fasces&quot;, symbolically rejecting Bibulus&#x27; consular authority. The law was then passed; the next day, Bibulus called a meeting of the senate seeking to annul the law on grounds that it was passed contrary to the auspices and with violence; annulment on such grounds was extremely rare and the senate, regardless, refused. Caesar &quot;provocatively demanded from the senate an oath of obedience to the law and got it&quot; after some pushing and resistance from Cato and some of his allies.

==== Laws for Pompey and Crassus ====
Some time after passage of the agrarian bill, Bibulus withdrew from public business to his home to declare unfavourable omens on all future voting days; the specific time in the year he did so, however, is not known. Caesar moved two further bills, first, for ratification of a one-third write-down of the tax bills owed by the &quot;publicani&quot; for Crassus, and second, for ratification of Pompey&#x27;s eastern settlement. Both bills were passed with little or no debate in the senate. Lucullus, attempting to oppose Pompey&#x27;s eastern settlement, was &quot;forced into public humiliation on his knees before Caesar&quot; when the consul threatened prosecution. When Cicero, defending his former co-consul Gaius Antonius Hybrida, made an off-hand remark complaining about the political situation, his &quot;deadly enemy P. Clodius [had] his long-obstructed &#x27;transition&#x27; to the plebs rushed through by Caesar... in good time to stand for the tribunate&quot;.

Caesar then moved to lift the exemption of Campania from his agrarian bill some time in May; its passage may have proved the last straw for Bibulus, who then withdrew to his house. Pompey, shortly thereafter, also wed Caesar&#x27;s daughter Julia to seal their alliance. An ally of Caesar&#x27;s, Publius Vatinius (then-plebeian tribune), also secured the passage of a law granting to Caesar the provinces of Illyricum and Cisalpine Gaul for five years. Doing so replaced Caesar&#x27;s assigned province of the woods and paths of Italy with Gaul; this was in response to growing tensions between the republic and the recent victors of a power struggle in Gaul, which had destabilised the geopolitical situation in the region. After the death of the governor of Transalpine Gaul – one of Cato&#x27;s allies – the senate was persuaded also to assign to Caesar that province as well. Both bills were met with little resistance, likely due to Cato and his allies&#x27; boycotting of public business.

==== Popular opinion turns ====
By the summer, however, popular opinion had started to turn against Caesar&#x27;s methods. Pompey also was distancing himself from Caesar. This was in part due to the success to Cato and Bibulus&#x27; campaign: Bibulus&#x27; choice to confine himself to his home &quot;presented the image of the city dominated by one man&#x27;s sole power, unchecked by a colleague&quot;. Pompey and Caesar attempted public protests against Bibulus&#x27; edicts and seclusion, respectively, to little response from the people. By then, the popular fervour of the agrarian bills had died down and the public likely desired a return to normal politics.

The ancient sources claimed that for most of the year, the senate was not called and that the people and senators were intimidated and cowed into passing whatever the three allies put before them. These claims are incompatible with the attested events of that year. For example, in that year, Caesar&#x27;s ally Vatinius was defeated in an election to the augurate and later elections for the magistracies returned Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus and Gaius Memmius, both opponents of Pompey and Caesar, as praetors. He was also able to secure election of two allies – one was Caesar&#x27;s soon-to-be father-in-law (Lucius Calpurnius Piso) and the other was Pompey&#x27;s supporter Aulus Gabinius – to the consulship. Also passed during Caesar&#x27;s consulship was the &quot;lex Julia de repetundis&quot;, which was a wide-ranging reform on corruption in the provinces and before the republic&#x27;s permanent courts.

=== Fraying of the pact, 59–55 BC ===
During the Caesar&#x27;s consulship, the success of Cato and Bibulus&#x27; tactics at discrediting Caesar and Pompey made the two greatly unpopular during and after the summer: &quot;[Caesar and Pompey&#x27;s] public appearances were received coldly or with open antagonism... Bibulus, far from being a pitiable figure, had never enjoyed such wide repute&quot;. Cato and Bibulus, for their part, mobilised a large propaganda campaign seeking to brand Caesar a tyrant, with &quot;dire warnings of the impending overthrow of the republican government&quot; that discredited the alliance and forced senators to re-evaluate their tacit support. Crassus revelled in Pompey&#x27;s discomfitures before the people; this unpopularity frayed at the alliance between the three men, which was meant only to secure for them aims which they could not achieve by themselves.

Upon the conclusion of Caesar&#x27;s consulship, he left after a few months for his provincial assignment to Gaul. His legislative activity, however, came under immediate attack from Domitius and Memmius, who had been elected as praetors during Caesar&#x27;s electoral &quot;comitia&quot; the last year, claiming that Caesar had passed the legislation against the auspices. These efforts were utterly unsuccessful – the pro-triumviral consuls allowed debate on the topic for three days – and the senate rejected the claims. In later years, Caesar&#x27;s laws were accepted writ large (perhaps with the exception of Bibulus), disregarding any technical religious objections: &quot;If Cicero and Cato both went along with the laws of Vatinius and Caesar, we can fairly assume the rest of the senators did so as well... For Bibulus, it was something of a personal campaign to seek to undermine... Caesar&#x27;s legislation... but his protests in 59 and later hardly &#x27;kept [it] technically invalid&#x27;&quot;.

==== At Rome ====
Pompey had the most to lose. After alienating the Metelli by divorcing Mucia, Pompey&#x27;s alliance with Caesar and Crassus alienated some former allies in the 60s as well, including the Cornelii Lentuli. The triple alliance also led to other formerly rivalrous families mending their relationships. The Luculli and Servilii, who had been rivals for decades, &quot;combined to withstand the triumvirs&quot;. Similarly, the Scibonii Curiones, Cornelii Sullae, and Memmii switched from supporting Pompey into opposing him and Caesar. In general, &quot;there can be no coincidence in the fact that, in almost every case, former &quot;amici&quot; of Pompey are first seen to be ranged with the opposition in the year 59... by maintaining a consciously moral posture, driving the triumvirs to extreme measures, and parading their own martyrdom, Cato and his associates ruined triumviral credit among the people and assembled aristocratic collaboration in resistance&quot;.

Early in 59 BC, Caesar and Pompey had ratified the adoption of Publius Clodius Pulcher into a plebeian clan. Clodius was an independent agent who was adept at playing political enemies off of each other. Soon after Clodius&#x27; adoption was ratified, he, against Caesar&#x27;s wishes, successfully stood for a tribunate for 58 BC. After some slights from Caesar and Pompey relating to assignment of a foreign mission, he broke with them. At the start of his tribunate, Clodius pushed forward four popular bills to expand grain imports, provide free grain to Roman citizens in the city, restore the (professional organisations), regulate the use of auspices as obstructive tactics, and regulate the power of the censors to remove senators. He also moved agitating against Cicero&#x27;s illegal execution of the Catilinarian conspirators during his consulship in 63 BC. While Cicero had secured some promises of protection from Pompey, Crassus, Caesar, and the consuls for 58 BC, &quot;the promised assistance... never materialised&quot; because Clodius had quickly gained a powerful popular following which the fraying alliance was unwilling to oppose. He also quickly won over the consuls of that year by promising them the plum provincial assignments they needed to avoid bankruptcy.

Later in the year 58, Clodius started to openly criticise the triumvirs, especially Pompey, forcing him into self-seclusion in his home. He also attacked Caesar&#x27;s legislation on religious grounds. Pompey was somewhat successful in checking Clodius&#x27; influence when he formed a coalition to overturn Cicero&#x27;s banishment, but Clodius&#x27; attacks continued, tacitly supported by Crassus and one Gaius Porcius Cato (a relative of Cato the Younger). Pompey also responded by supporting Titus Annius Milo and Publius Sestius, who raised their own urban mobs to contest the streets from Clodius&#x27; mobs, and, with the returned Cicero&#x27;s support, was able to secure a prestigious command over Rome&#x27;s grain supply in September 57 BC.

However, Pompey&#x27;s very success renewed the coalition against him: a coalition of the Claudii, including Clodius, the Lentuli, and the Catonians – with little meaningful opposition from Caesar and Crassus – were able to shut off any hope of Pompey being granted a new military command in Egypt to restore Ptolemy XII Auletes to the throne. In a clash of mutually exclusive proposals raised by different factions in January 56 BC, all proposals were unacceptable to at least one party, leading to nothing being done about Egypt. At the same time, Pompey&#x27;s grain command had not produced reduced prices, further reducing his popularity; under attack by Clodius, whom Pompey suspected Crassus was supporting, the conservatives around Bibulus and Curio watched.

All the consuls of 57 and 56 BC were, if not opponents of, indifferent to both Caesar and Pompey; the failure to maintain their political influence put the alliance into a &quot;shambles&quot;. Cicero, describing Pompey&#x27;s plight, mentions the &quot;contio&quot;-goers estranged, the nobility hostile, and the senate unfair. Without the ability to make allies with the rest of the aristocracy, who had closed ranks against him, Pompey had to double down with his existing allies.

==== In Gaul ====
Through this whole period, Caesar was fighting in the Gallic Wars. By early 56 BC, he had won enormous popularity both with the senate and the people: in 57, Caesar requested thanksgivings for his victory over the Belgae and, at a motion of Cicero, received fifteen days of &quot;supplicationes&quot;, a new record. In his narrative of his campaign, &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;, by 57, Caesar reported pacification of the whole region. These military achievements had undercut any political will to undermine Caesar&#x27;s &quot;acta&quot; from his first consulship, and during 56 itself, Caesar received a series of favourable senatorial decrees to provide more funds for his troops in Gaul – above Cicero&#x27;s objections that Caesar could have paid for them out of his spoils – and granted his request to have ten legates () sent to aid in administration and senatorial settlement of the region&#x27;s affairs.

Caesar&#x27;s successes at this point had made him extremely popular among the people and in general across the political class; Cicero, who had been sullen during Caesar&#x27;s consulship, sang his praises, saying &quot;If perhaps Gaius Caesar was too contentious in any matter, if the greatness of the struggle, his zeal for glory, if his irrepressible spirit and high nobility drove him on [that] should be tolerated in the case of a man of his quality&quot;. This popularity, however, did not translate into political victories for his political allies: none of the magistrates for 57 were friendly; in the elections of 57 (for magistrates in 56) his allies were repulsed from both the aedileship and the praetorship, while his political enemies won two praetorships. Caesar&#x27;s political support in Rome was largely dependent on Pompey and Crassus, rather than his own legates or allies.

By 56 BC, Caesar&#x27;s enemies were mobilising against him: a tribune attempted to recall him for trial – which was vetoed, as he Caesar was legitimately on government business, – while Domitius only &quot;declared his intention to terminate Caesar&#x27;s command as soon as possible&quot;. Furthermore, Caesar&#x27;s land bills were under attack by a tribune – perhaps under Pompey&#x27;s influence – who wanted to deny Caesar&#x27;s veterans from receiving land under his &quot;lex Julia agraria&quot; upon their retirement. And in the summer, fighting started back up, with campaigns against a Veneti uprising in northwestern Gaul. These campaigns led Caesar to seek a five-year extension of his command; to do this, he too would need the support of his allies once more.

=== Renewal ===
==== Luca Conference ====

Over the summer of 56 BC, Caesar met with the leaders of various factions across Cisalpine Gaul. He met with Crassus at Ravenna and Pompey at the town of Luca, the southern-most city in Cisalpine Gaul. The agreement emerged from three relatively compatible aims: Crassus and Pompey desired a joint consulship; they also wanted good provincial assignments. Caesar needed an extension in his command to prevent a possible usurpation by Ahenobarbus.

Some two hundred senators, mostly of lower rank, attended upon the three men, seeking to ingratiate themselves. The conference also forced a re-evaluation of alliances across the wider aristocracy: the Claudii – both Appius and Publius – and Gaius Cato switched sides back to the dynasts. Cicero, dependent on and indebted to Pompey for his return from exile, was also enlisted to lend rhetorical support. The alliance was renewed and expanded to include the Claudii Pulchri, turning Clodius from an opponent to a supporter. In return for their help, the allies would support Appius – whose chances of election to a consulship without their support was slim – in his goal of being elected consul for 54. The remaining opposition was also further reinvigorated. Cato had returned from a provincial assignment in Cyprus in late 56 and supported Domitius&#x27; campaign for the consulship. After 55 BC, when Pompey and Crassus assumed a joint consulship by violence, the political fortunates of the triple alliance quickly soured.

The development of the specific terms of their renewed agreement may have taken some time. Caesar responded to the threat of Domitius&#x27; consulship by asking Crassus to stand and veto any actions to take away his command. Pompey chose to stand for the consulship as well, possibly unilaterally, met with the support (if not entirely willing), of his allies. However, by the time this arrangement was decided, the current consul – Marcellinus – refused to accept their candidacy on grounds that they had passed the deadline. Faced with political disaster, they decided instead of &quot;scuttle the whole election process&quot; for 56 BC.

==== Joint consulship, 55 BC ====
Election of Pompey and Crassus was by no means certain. By the time of the conference, to produce the conditions needed for victory, the alliance stoked mob violence and interposed a permanent tribunician veto – courtesy of Clodius&#x27; ally, Gaius Cato, who was tribune that year – to block elections until the following year. The terms of the consuls having expired, elections were conducted instead by temporary extraordinary magistrates, &quot;interreges&quot;, and with the arrival of Caesar&#x27;s soldiers from Gaul on winter furlough, elections were held. Employing force to drive other candidates away and distributing bribes to ensure their victory, Pompey and Crassus were elected consuls. They then used their control over the electoral &quot;comitia&quot; also to secure the election of their allies to the praetorship (both Milo and Vatinius were returned) while excluding opponents (Cato was not).

These strong-arm tactics were exceptional and resulted from the alliance&#x27;s realisation that failure to secure the consulship in this year would result in their political extinction. While they certainly won a temporary victory, the longer-term fallout of intimidation tactics and the validation of Cato&#x27;s warnings proved especially harmful &quot;among the basically conservative Roman voters&quot;.

Pompey and Crassus moved first to elect censors and pass new legislation regulating juries and punishing bribery. The main piece of legislation was brought by an allied tribune, Gaius Trebonius, to grant for five years Crassus and Pompey the provinces of Syria and Hispania (they would draw lots for the specific assignment). Crassus envisioned possible campaigns against Egypt or the Parthians; Pompey envisioned similar campaigns against the Spanish hinterlands. Fearing vetoes from two of his tribunician colleagues, Trebonius had one of them locked in the senate house and prevented the other from entering the Forum with an obstructive mob. With the bill passed, they also made good on their promise to Caesar, putting forward legislation extending Caesar&#x27;s term in Gaul for five more years.

Pompey threw lavish games in September as part of his dedication of the Theatre of Pompey. News also came of Caesar&#x27;s expedition beyond the Rhine to Britain; for these, the senate voted him twenty days of thanksgiving. The opposing tribunes attempted to obstruct recruitment for Crassus and Pompey&#x27;s armies, but were unsuccessful. When Crassus left the city in November, escorted by Pompey, they announced bad omens, attempted to arrest him, and cursed him at the city&#x27;s gate. Part of the justification against Crassus&#x27; campaign was in terms of immorality: &quot;several in Cato&#x27;s circle argued... the Parthians had given no justification for war&quot;.

The elections for the year, however, went strongly against the allies. Unwilling to repeat their mob tactics due to their unpopularity, Pompey campaigned for one of his clients, Titus Ampius Balbus, but those efforts were in vain. The voters returned Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, denied victory by Pompey and Crassus&#x27; violence, and Appius Claudius Pulcher. Also elected was Cato for a praetorship; the next year, he would chair the court on extortion.

=== Backlash ===
The new consul Appius Claudius Pulcher seemed an ally, but as the political winds blew against the alliance, he quickly defected. Early in the year, he cooperated with them in securing the appointment of a Pompeian ally as one of Caesar&#x27;s tribunes and obstructed Gabinius&#x27; prosecution (for the bribes received to induce his invasion of Egypt), but seeing Pompey&#x27;s support for one Marcus Aemilius Scaurus rather than his brother for the consulship of 53 BC, he broke with Pompey and launched a prosecution against Scaurus.

The alliance&#x27;s opponents, led by Cato&#x27;s coterie, also launched a broadside against their supporters in the courts:
* Gaius Porcius Cato, the tribune in 56 who had vetoed elections to delay them for Pompey and Crassus, was prosecuted but acquitted. He was then brought on new charges but again acquitted.
* Another tribune, Marcus Nonius Sufenas, who had helped Gaius Cato, was also tried. He was acquitted.
* Also prosecuted was a Pompeian tribune from 57 BC, who was also acquitted.
* In the case of Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, tried before Cato&#x27;s extortion court for extorting the Sardinians during his propraetorship, six leading defence advocates (Cicero, Hortensius, and Clodius included) and nine former consuls – including Pompey and Metellus Nepos – were enlisted in his defence. He too was acquitted.
* Publius Vatinius was tried for giving bribes in his campaign for praetor. With Cicero&#x27;s (begrudging) defence, he was acquitted.
* Aulus Gabinius, one of Pompey&#x27;s allies and former legates, was tried after his return from Syria in September 54 BC for receiving bribes to attack Egypt. He was tried first for treason but acquitted after Pompey bribed the jurors. In a second trial for extortion, Pompey&#x27;s blatant bribes &quot;had likely led to a surge of resentment&quot; and Gabinius was sent into exile, the only major conviction of the year. By this time, consul Pulcher had switched sides, joining in the attack on Gabinius.
* When Gabinius was sent into exile, a prosecution was launched to recover portions of unpaid fines against one of Gabinius&#x27; financial agents who was an ally of Pompey and Caesar. With Cicero&#x27;s help, he too was acquitted.

At least three more supporters of the triumvirate were prosecuted; they too were all acquitted. Cato and his coterie&#x27;s judicial attacks were unsuccessful &quot;in large part because the complex network of connections among senators meant that the litigants could not be reduced to stark choices between two political parties or ideologies&quot;.

This year also saw the death of Caesar&#x27;s daughter, and Pompey&#x27;s wife, Julia, in childbirth. Caesar offered in marriage his grand-niece Octavia, but was rebuffed. Pompey&#x27;s refusal, however, did not indicate a break between the two allies. At the time, there was &quot;no demonstrable rupture&quot;; Pompey and Caesar continued to support each other politically for several years.

The elections for 53 BC were hugely delayed due to political violence and bribery. Domitius and Appius Claudius engaged in bribery pact with two consular candidates. Thus, an anti-triumviral consul, a wavering ally, a supporter of the triumvirate (Gaius Memmius), and an opponent (Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus) banded together. The consuls, concerned that they would be precluded from holding military command due to the lack of a requisite &quot;lex curiata&quot;, promised to throw their support behind the two candidates in exchange for choice provinces and their securing false testimony from three augurs to swear that the requisite &quot;lex&quot; had been passed.

When Memmius exposed the conspiracy, likely to implicate Domitius, all four were indicted for bribery. The senate delayed elections to hold an inquiry, but the specific steps forward became quickly contested and various tribunes vetoed the elections. Coupled with raging street battles in the city between Milo and Clodius&#x27; armed gangs, elections were finally held after more than seven months without any magistrates, in July 53 BC. Dio attributed these delays to tribunician vetoes against elections of &quot;interreges&quot; designed to incite appointment of Pompey as dictator. Pompey was not in the city; his return in the summer and his declining of a dictatorship, however, may have stabilised the city sufficiently – both by his presence and by his starting a rapprochement with Cato&#x27;s conservative faction – to allow for elections. By July, the alliance&#x27;s support for Scaurus, along with Gaius Memmius, had gone nowhere. The &quot;comitia&quot; instead returned candidates supported by a coalition of triumviral enemies: Marcus Valerius Messalla Rufus and Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus. As a whole, these various elections showed the weakness of the triumviral coalition: Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus were unable to produce consistently favourable results except when their aims were entirely united; the joint consulship in 55 BC was brought about by force and, &quot;thereafter, their [the alliance&#x27;s] stock with the voters rapidly depreciated&quot;.

=== Pompey&#x27;s sole consulship, 52 BC ===

In spring of 53 BC, while Rome dealt with its own political crisis, Crassus launched his invasion of Syria and Caesar was dealing with a military crisis as the Gauls rose up. From the perspective at Rome, news of ambushes against in Gaul arrived first: Caesar abandoned his civil functions in Cisalpine Gaul to rescue his legions wintering in the Eburones&#x27; territory (near modern Belgium). A few months later, news of the disaster at the Battle of Carrhae arrived, reporting that Crassus and much of his army had been killed by the Parthians.

Still at this point, Caesar and Pompey were on friendly terms. Caesar praised Pompey, for example, for lending one of Pompey&#x27;s Spanish legions to help against the Gauls, a private military arrangement which Cato criticised in the senate for usurping senatorial prerogatives on legionary assignments. The consuls immediately prepared to hold elections for 52 BC, which proved impossible when they were injured by stones thrown by the crowd.

As the year 52 BC started, the consuls stepped down without replacement. For the first 18 days of the year, tribunes continually interposed their vetoes against election of an &quot;interrex&quot;. Standing for the consulship in this year were Milo (supported by Cato and others), Publius Plautius Hypsaeus (one of Pompey&#x27;s former lieutenants), and Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio. Clodius, still warring with Milo&#x27;s street gangs, supported Milo&#x27;s competitors. Some ancient historians – including Plutarch, Livy, and Valerius Maximus – believed that this violence was all part of a plot to have Pompey appointed dictator. That Pompey desired a dictatorship is unnecessary to explain his opposition to elections; Pompey may have opposed the elections merely because they would have been elections that Milo would have won. On 18 January, at a chance counter between Clodius and Milo on a road near a suburb outside of Rome, Milo&#x27;s henchmen killed Clodius after a short brawl between their two entourages. The next day, his body was brought back to Rome, where a mob then stormed the senate house and burnt it down – along with the Basilica Porcia – as part of Clodius&#x27; funeral pyre.

At the resulting senate meeting on the Palatine, the senate elected an &quot;interrex&quot;. This was in part because two of the men obstructing senatorial action – Pompey and one of the tribunes, Titus Munatius Plancus, – were not present. Shortly thereafter, the senate passed a &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot; which called for the &quot;interrex&quot; and Pompey, as proconsul, to raise troops and take them into the city to restore order. The following eleven &quot;interreges&quot; were unable to hold elections. However, some fifty-eight days after Clodius&#x27; death, with a sufficient force in the city, the twelfth &quot;interrex&quot; was able to hold elections. At the direction of the senate on motion of Bibulus and supported by Cato, only Pompey&#x27;s candidacy was accepted, and upon his election, he became consul without colleague. The purpose of the decree was possibly to forestall a Pompeian dictatorship or as part of a compromise to restore normal government while also precluding Milo&#x27;s likely election (allowing Milo to be brought to trial for Clodius&#x27; murder).

Also around this time, Pompey had married the daughter of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio, who also was the widow of Crassus&#x27; son; this was part of an attempt to win over more allies. Metellus Pius&#x27; family was not part of Cato&#x27;s coterie (they were personal enemies and Cato&#x27;s allies had attempted to prosecute him in 60 BC) and marrying Crassus&#x27; son&#x27;s widow could win over some of the now-dead Crassus&#x27; supporters.

Pompey began his consulship by marching soldiers into the city and imposing order by force. After passing legislation, he immediately prosecuted Milo for public violence, a move which Cato and Cicero opposed (for this trial, Cicero wrote Pro Milone). Pompey, however, was able to secure a conviction and forced Milo into exile. Pompey and Cato also bumped heads on the &quot;Law of the Ten Tribunes&quot; – a bill proposed by all ten of the plebeian tribunes in the aftermath of news of Caesar&#x27;s victory at Alesia – which granted Caesar the right to stand for the consulship &quot;in absentia&quot;: Pompey supported it; Cato opposed. Amid bribery scandals, Pompey also secured the passage of a law mooted the previous year, which required a delay of five years been magistracy and dispatch to a province. It was meant to break &quot;the nexus of corruption between ambition for office and provincial extortion&quot;. Pompey, however, sought and secured exception from his own law, assuming a five year command in Spain immediately.

=== Collapse, 52–49 BC ===
The death of Julia did not mark an immediate collapse in the alliance between Pompey, Crassus, and Caesar. The view that her death made a confrontation inevitable is held by a number of ancient sources, but is no longer uncritically accepted by modern scholars. Nor did his election as sole consul in 52 BC mark an immediate collapse in their alliance. During Pompey&#x27;s sole consulship, he married Cornelia Metella, the daughter of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio, but this too was not a break with Caesar (as implied by Velleius Paterclus). The death of Crassus in early 53 BC, however, did mark the conversion of a balanced three-person alliance into what would turn into a dyadic rivalry. Pompey&#x27;s marriage in 52 BC and his another law reaffirming the requirement to declare candidacy for office in person &quot;did not actually harm Caesar directly&quot; but indicated his willingness to build alliances with other, formerly closed off, political groupings.

Cato stood for the consulship of 51 BC. But after running an honest campaign with little bribery and promises to recall Caesar from Gaul, his canvass was rejected by the people. Elected instead were Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Servius Sulpicius Rufus. The former was an enemy of Caesar and raised in 51 BC the question of stripping Caesar of his command, arguing that because of Caesar&#x27;s victory at Alesia, his &quot;provincia&quot; (here meaning &quot;task&quot;) in Gaul was completed. His effort was vetoed; Pompey, too, objected, arguing that removing Caesar before the summer of 50 BC would not respect his dignity.

At the elections for the magistrates of 50 BC, Caesar&#x27;s ally Gaius Scribonius Curio was elected tribune; Gaius Claudius Marcellus and Lucius Aemilius Paullus were returned as consuls-designate. While Paullus was induced by a massive bribe (Caesar funded his renovation of the &quot;basilica Aemilia&quot;), Paullus remained only neutral. By late 51 BC, the coming showdown became clearer: Caesar would induce tribunes to veto discussion of his replacement in Gaul – leaving him in command – while Cato and his conservatives sought to enlist Pompey to defend against any Caesarian threats and deny Caesar any honours. However, Pompey did not immediately come around to breaking with Caesar: he needed Caesar&#x27;s support to secure a possible command against the Parthians as concerns rose that year over a possible counter-invasion following Crassus&#x27; defeat.

In the new year, in March 50 BC, one of the new consuls, Gaius Claudius Marcellus, raised the question of Caesar&#x27;s command again. His efforts were vetoed by Curio, however, and the consuls responded by putting a hold on all provincial discussions, in an attempt to force Curio to lift it. This veto, perhaps a mistake or possibly made with knowledge that Pompey was hostile to Caesar&#x27;s standing for election &quot;in absentia&quot; with his army – which would have been seen as intimidating – started the crisis. Caesar, knowing that Pompey was reconciling with Cato and Bibulus, was unable to trust him to stick to his word, especially if giving up his command would open him to possibly having his candidacy and triumph rejected by the unfriendly consuls. Caesar rejected a senatorial compromise which would have had Caesar stand for the consulship in 50 without giving up his command or armies, likely because he did not trust Pompey and the consuls to uphold their end of the bargain.

The proposal of Curio that both men lay down their commands also was rejected, this time by Pompey, who saw it as a personal affront. While the proposal was approved by the senate overwhelmingly, Pompey&#x27;s refusal and Caesar&#x27;s militating against his Spanish command sapped trust between the two men. After Pompey&#x27;s illness in early summer – which triggered spontaneous prayers for his health that he interpreted as support if he were to engage in civil conflict – he proposed acceptance, but by this point, Caesar and his partisans were unable to trust Pompey also to hold his end of the bargain and give up his command if Caesar did so first. When two legions were transferred from Caesar&#x27;s Gallic armies to Italy, on the pretext of use against Parthia (a threat that did not materialise), Caesar&#x27;s trust in Pompey was shaken again. At the elections, Caesar supported Servius Sulpicius Galba and Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Crus: elected were Gaius Claudius Marcellus (homonymous cousin of the consul of 50 BC) and Crus, who quickly defected from Caesar&#x27;s cause.

As consul Gaius Claudius Marcellus started military preparations with the clear purpose of opposing Caesar&#x27;s triumphal return and with Caesar unable to trust Pompey or his loose Catonian allies to hold to his word and vice versa, neither side wanted to make concessions in fear that the other would not reciprocate. Moreover, each side was confident that it held the superior position, expecting the other to give way. By January 49 BC, this spiralled into a civil war that neither side, Cato&#x27;s partisans excepted, seemed to have wanted.

== Evaluation ==

The alliance was clearly successful in winning short-term political advantage for its members in Caesar&#x27;s consulship of 59 BC. However, over the following years, it broke down: &quot;cooperation was shaky and the disenchantment of former supporters proved.. to be debilitating&quot;. Moreover, its very success triggered &quot;the coalescence of aristocratic groups in opposition&quot; with greatly lessened success in the later half of the 50s. Overall, the alliance was &quot;never entirely stable&quot; and was marked by periods of renewal followed by a return to rivalries between the three members. The goals sought together were broadly opportunistic and self-interested. The alliance, however, was part of the thinking that went into the creation of the Second Triumvirate a few decades later.

The formation of the three-way alliance &quot;has been seen as a momentous milestone in the crippling of republican institutions&quot; since ancient times. The ancient historian Gaius Asinius Pollio chose to start his history of the civil wars with its formation; other historians, including Ronald Syme in &quot;Roman Revolution&quot; (1939), have taken a similar tact, viewing it as &quot;the end of the free state&quot;. For example, Jürgen von Ungern-Sternberg in the &quot;Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic&quot; (2014), wrote:

Others disagree. Erich Gruen, for example, writes &quot;the union of political cliques in 59 was an information &quot;amicitia&quot;... [it was] no novelty in Roman politics and simply underlined the mobility of grouping that had been characteristic of previous decades&quot;. In this vein, the alliance can be seen as something similar also to &quot;the kind of political deal the Saturninus and Glaucia were trying to organise in 100&quot; BC. Amy Russell, writing in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Ancient History&quot;, similarly focuses on how the alliance failed to dominate elections, viewing instead the accusations of &quot;regnum&quot; from Cicero and lamentations of tyranny as &quot;deriv[ing] from their opponents&#x27; rhetoric... [who] at the same time... were working to divide them [the allies]&quot;. Similarly, Mary Beard says the alliance &quot;was not such a complete takeover as those comments [from Horace and Cicero] imply[;] there were all kinds of strains, disagreements, and rivalries between the three men ... the electoral process sometimes got the better of them and someone quite different, not at all to their liking, was voted in&quot;.

The alliance&#x27;s collapse after Crassus&#x27; death was because his death put the two remaining men in competition with one another. Coupled with Caesar&#x27;s military success in Gaul, he was no longer a junior partner. Pompey&#x27;s search for new allies to counter-balance Caesar led him into conflict.

<text>Karl or Carl Gottlob Zumpt (; 20 March 179226 June 1849) was a German classical scholar known for his work in the field of Latin philology.

==Life==
Karl Gottlob Zumpt was born at Berlin on 20 March 1792.

Educated at Heidelberg and Berlin, he was from 1812 onward, a schoolteacher at Friedrich Werder Gymnasium in Berlin. In 1821 he transferred as a professor to the Joachimsthal Gymnasium, also in Berlin. In 1827 he was appointed professor of classical philology at the University of Berlin.

His chief work was his &quot;Latin Grammar&quot; (&quot;Lateinische Grammatik&quot;&quot;, 1818), which stood as a standard work until superseded by Johan Nicolai Madvig&#x27;s textbook in 1844 (In Danish: &quot;&quot;Latinsk Sproglære til Skolebrug&quot;). He edited Quintilian&#x27;s &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot;&quot; (Volume 5, 1829, a project started by Georg Ludwig Spalding), as well as works by Quintus Curtius Rufus and Cicero:
* &quot;Q. Curtii Rufi De gestis Alexandri Magni, regis Macedonum, libri qui supersunt octo by Quintus Curtius Rufus&quot;, 1826.
* &quot;M. Tullii Ciceronis Verrinarum libri septem&quot;, 1830.
* &quot;M. Tullii Ciceronis de officiis libri tres. Ad optimorum exemplarium sidem recensiti&quot;, 1837.

Otherwise, he primarily devoted his time and efforts to Roman history, publishing &quot;Annales veterum regnorum et populorum&quot; (3rd edition 1862), a work in chronology down to 476 AD, and other antiquarian studies.

He was the uncle of August Wilhelm Zumpt.

<text>August Wilhelm Zumpt (4 December 181522 April 1877 in Berlin) was a German classical scholar, known chiefly in connection with Latin epigraphy. He was a nephew of philologist Karl Gottlob Zumpt.

Born in Königsberg, Zumpt studied at the University of Berlin (1832–36). From 1839 to 1851, he was a professor at Friedrich Werder Gymnasium (Berlin), afterwards working as a professor at Friedrich-Wilhelms-Gymnasium under the direction of Karl Ferdinand Ranke. He travelled extensively during his career; England (1845, 1860), Italy (1851, 1857, 1864), Greece, Egypt, Palestine and Asia Minor (1871–72).

His papers on epigraphy (collected in &quot;Commentationes epigraphicae&quot;, 2 vols., 1850, 1854) brought him into conflict with Theodor Mommsen in connexion with the preparation of the &quot;Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum&quot;, a scheme for which, drawn up by Mommsen, was approved in 1847.

<text>The Battle of Philippi was the final battle in the Liberators&#x27; civil war between the forces of Mark Antony and Octavian (of the Second Triumvirate) and the leaders of Julius Caesar&#x27;s assassination, Brutus and Cassius, in 42 BC, at Philippi in Macedonia. The Second Triumvirate declared the civil war ostensibly to avenge Julius Caesar&#x27;s assassination in 44 BC, but the underlying cause was a long-brewing conflict between the Optimates and the Populares.

The battle, involving up to 200,000 men in one of the largest of the Roman civil wars, consisted of two engagements in the plain west of the ancient city of Philippi. The first occurred in the first week of October; Brutus faced Octavian, and Antony&#x27;s forces fought those of Cassius. The Roman armies fought poorly, with low discipline, nonexistent tactical coordination and amateurish lack of command experience evident in abundance with neither side able to exploit opportunities as they developed. At first, Brutus pushed back Octavian and entered his legions&#x27; camp. However, to the south, Cassius was defeated by Antony and died by suicide after hearing a false report that Brutus had also failed. Brutus rallied Cassius&#x27;s remaining troops, and both sides ordered their army to retreat to their camps with their spoils. The battle was essentially a draw but for Cassius&#x27;s suicide. A second encounter, on 23 October, finished off Brutus&#x27;s forces after a hard-fought battle. He took his own life in turn, leaving the triumvirate in control of the Roman Republic.

== Prelude ==

After the assassination of Caesar, the two main conspirators, Brutus and Cassius, known as the Liberators, and leaders of the Republicans had left Italy. They took control of all the eastern provinces from Greece to Syria and of the allied eastern kingdoms. In Rome the three main Caesarian leaders (Antony, Octavian and Lepidus), who controlled almost all the Roman army in the west, had crushed the opposition of the Senate and established the Second Triumvirate. One of their first tasks was to destroy the Liberators&#x27; forces, not only to get full control of the Roman world, but also to avenge Caesar&#x27;s death.

The triumvirs decided that Lepidus would remain in Italy, while the two main partners of the triumvirate, Antony and Octavian, moved to northern Greece with their best troops, a total of 28 legions. They were able to ferry their army across the Adriatic and sent out a scouting force of eight legions, commanded by Norbanus and Saxa, along the Via Egnatia, with the aim of searching for the Liberators&#x27; army. Norbanus and Saxa passed the town of Philippi in eastern Macedonia and took a strong defensive position at a narrow mountain pass. Antony was following, while Octavian was delayed at Dyrrachium because of his ill-health (which would accompany him throughout the Philippi campaign). Although Antony and Octavian had been able to cross the sea with their main force, further communications with Italy were made difficult by the arrival of the Republican admiral Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, with a large fleet of 130 ships.

The Liberators did not wish to engage in a decisive battle, but rather to attain a good defensive position and then use their naval superiority to block the triumvirs&#x27; communications with their supply base in Italy. They had spent the previous months plundering Greek cities to swell their war-chest. They gathered in Thrace with the Roman legions from the eastern provinces and levies from allies. With their superior forces they were able to outflank Norbanus and Saxa, who had to abandon their defensive position and retreat west of Philippi. This meant that Brutus and Cassius could position their forces to hold the high ground along both sides of the Via Egnatia, about west of the city of Philippi. The southern position was anchored on a supposedly impassable marsh, while on the north on impassable hills. They had time to fortify their position with a rampart and ditch. Brutus positioned his camp to the north while Cassius was on the south of the Via Egnatia. Antony arrived and positioned his army south of the Via Egnatia, while Octavian put his legions north of the road.

== Forces ==

=== Antony and Octavian ===
The Triumvirs&#x27; army present for the battle included nineteen legions. The sources specify the name of only one legion, IV legion, but other legions present included the III, VI, VII, VIII, X Equestris, XII, XXVI, XXVIII, XXIX, and XXX, since their veterans participated in the land settlements after the battle. Appian reports that the triumvirs&#x27; legions were almost at full complement. Furthermore, they had a large allied cavalry force of 13,000 horsemen.

=== Liberators ===
The Liberators&#x27; army had seventeen legions; eight with Brutus and nine with Cassius. Only two of the legions were at full strength, but the army was reinforced by levies from the eastern allied kingdoms. Appian reports that the army mustered a total of about 80,000 foot-soldiers. Allied cavalry totaled 20,000 horsemen, including 5,000 bowmen mounted in the Eastern fashion. 

This army included the old Caesarean legions present in the east, probably including XXVII, XXXVI, XXXVII, XXXI and XXXIII legions; so most of these legionaries were Caesarean veterans. However, at least the XXXVI legion consisted of old Pompeian veterans, enrolled in Caesar&#x27;s army after the Battle of Pharsalus. The loyalty of the soldiers who were supposed to fight against Caesar&#x27;s heir was a delicate issue for the Liberators. Cassius tried to reinforce the soldiers&#x27; loyalty both with strong speeches (&quot;Let it give no one any concern that he has been one of Caesar&#x27;s soldiers. We were not his soldiers then, but our country&#x27;s&quot;) and with a gift of 1,500 denarii for each legionary and 7,500 for each centurion.

Ancient sources do not report the total numbers of men of the two armies, but it seems that they had a similar strength. Adrian Goldsworthy suggests that at full strength the 19 Triumvir legions may have amounted to 95,000 men and the 17 Liberators&#x27; legions to 85,000. Most likely each side had only 40,000–50,000 legionaries. As the campaign lasted for months, it is unlikely that either side could have sustained the logistics to keep so many men, horses and baggage animals fed if both sides had had 100,000 or so troops.

== First battle ==
Antony offered battle several times, but the Liberators were not lured into leaving their defensive position. Antony tried to secretly outflank the Liberators&#x27; position through the marshes in the south. With great effort he was able to cut a passage through the marshes, throwing up a causeway over them. This manoeuvre was finally noticed by Cassius, who countered by moving part of his army south into the marshes and constructing a transverse wall in a bid to cut off Antony&#x27;s outstretched right wing. This brought about a general battle on 3 October 42 BC.
Antony ordered a charge against Cassius, aiming at the fortifications between Cassius&#x27;s camp and the marshes. At the same time, Brutus&#x27;s soldiers, provoked by the triumvirs&#x27; army, rushed against Octavian&#x27;s army, without waiting for the order of attack, which was to be given with the watchword &quot;Liberty&quot;. This surprise assault had complete success: Octavian&#x27;s troops were put to flight and pursued up to their camp, which was captured by Brutus&#x27;s men, led by Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus. Three of Octavian&#x27;s legions had their standards taken, a clear sign of a rout. Octavian was not found in his tent: his couch was pierced and cut to pieces. Most ancient historians say that he had been warned in a dream to beware of that day, as he wrote in his memoirs. Pliny bluntly reports that Octavian went into hiding in the marsh.
However, on the other side of the Via Egnatia, Antony was able to storm Cassius&#x27; fortifications, demolishing the palisade and filling up the ditch. Then he easily took Cassius&#x27;s camp, which was defended by only a few men. It seems that part of Cassius&#x27;s army had advanced south: when these men tried to come back they were easily repulsed by Antony.

Apparently the battle had ended in a draw. Cassius had lost 8,000 men, while Octavian had about 16,000 casualties. The battlefield was very large and clouds of dust made it impossible to make a clear assessment of the outcome of the battle, so both wings were ignorant of each other&#x27;s fate. Cassius moved to the top of a hill, but could not see what was happening on Brutus&#x27;s side. Believing that he had suffered a crushing defeat he ordered his freedman Pindarus to kill him. Brutus mourned over Cassius&#x27;s body, calling him &quot;the last of the Romans&quot;. He avoided a public funeral, fearing its negative effects on the army morale.

Other sources credit the avarice of Brutus&#x27; troops as the factor that undid their definitive victory on October3. Premature looting and gathering of treasure by Brutus&#x27;s advancing forces allowed Octavian&#x27;s troops to re-form their line. In Octavian&#x27;s future reign as Emperor, a common battle cry became &quot;Complete the battle once begun!&quot;

== Second battle ==
On the same day as the first battle, the Republican fleet was able to intercept and destroy the triumvirs&#x27; reinforcements of two legions and other troops and supplies led by Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus. The strategic position of Antony and Octavian became perilous, since the already depleted regions of Macedonia and Thessaly were unable to supply their army for long, while Brutus could easily receive supplies from the sea. The triumvirs had to send a legion south to Achaia to collect more supplies. The morale of the troops was boosted by the promise of a further 5,000 denarii for each soldier and 25,000 for each centurion.

On the other side, the Liberators&#x27; army was left without its best strategic mind. Brutus had less military experience than Cassius and, even worse, he could not command the same respect from his allies and his soldiers, although after the battle he offered another gift of 1,000 denarii for each soldier.

In the next three weeks, Antony was able to slowly advance his forces south of Brutus&#x27;s army, fortifying a hill close to Cassius&#x27;s former camp, which had been left unguarded by Brutus.
To avoid being outflanked, Brutus was compelled to extend his line to the south and then the east, parallel to the Via Egnatia, building several fortified posts. While still holding the high ground he wanted to keep to the original plan of avoiding an open engagement and waiting for his naval superiority to wear out the enemy. The traditional understanding is that Brutus, against his better judgment, subsequently abandoned this strategy because his officers and soldiers were tired of the delaying tactics and demanded he offer another open battle. Brutus and his officers may have feared that their soldiers would desert to the enemy if they appeared to have lost the initiative. Plutarch also reports that Brutus had not received news of Domitius Calvinus&#x27; defeat in the Ionian Sea. When some of the eastern allies and mercenaries started deserting, Brutus was forced to attack on the afternoon of October23. As he said, &quot;I seem to carry on war like Pompey the Great, not so much commanding as commanded.&quot; However, the reality is that Brutus had no option but to fight, because his entire position was now in danger of being isolated and rendered untenable. If the triumvirs were allowed to continue stretching their lines unimpeded to the east they would ultimately cut off his supply route to Neapolis and pin him against the mountains. If that happened, the tables would be turned; Brutus would either be starved into submission or be forced to retreat by taking his entire army via the hazardous northern trail that had brought him to Philippi.

The battle which ensued resulted in close combat between two armies of well-trained veterans. Ranged weapons such as arrows or javelins were largely ignored; instead, the soldiers packed into solid ranks and fought face-to-face with their swords, and the slaughter was terrible. According to Cassius Dio, the two sides had little need for missile weapons, &quot;for they did not resort to the usual manoeuvres and tactics of battles&quot; but immediately advanced to close combat, &quot;seeking to break each other&#x27;s ranks&quot;. In the account of Plutarch, Brutus had the better of the fight at the western end of his line and pressed hard on the triumvirs&#x27; left wing, which gave way and retreated, being harassed by the Republican cavalry, which sought to exploit the advantage when it saw the enemy in disorder. But the eastern flank of Brutus&#x27;s line had inferior numbers because it had been extended to avoid being outflanked. This meant Brutus&#x27;s legions had been drawn out too thin in the center, and were so weak here they could not withstand the triumvirs&#x27; initial charge. Having broken through, the triumvirs swung to their left to take Brutus in his flank and rear. Appian speaks of the triumvirs&#x27; legions having &quot;pushed back the enemy&#x27;s line as though they were turning round a very heavy machine.&quot; Brutus&#x27;s legions were driven back step-by-step, slowly at first, but as their ranks crumbled under the pressure they began to give ground more rapidly. The second and third reserve lines in the rear failed to keep pace with the retreat and all three lines became entangled. Octavian&#x27;s soldiers were able to capture the gates of Brutus&#x27;s camp before the routing army could reach this defensive position. Brutus&#x27;s army could not reform, which made the triumvirs&#x27; victory complete. Brutus was able to retreat into the nearby hills with the equivalent of only four legions. Seeing that surrender and capture were inevitable, Brutus took his own life.

The total casualties for the second battle of Philippi were not reported, but the close quarters fighting likely resulted in heavy losses for both sides.

== Aftermath ==
Plutarch reports that Antony covered Brutus&#x27;s body with a purple garment as a sign of respect. Although they had not been close friends, he remembered that Brutus had stipulated, as a condition for his joining the plot to assassinate Caesar, that the life of Antony be spared.

Many other young Roman aristocrats lost their lives in the battle or died by suicide after the defeat, including the son of great orator Hortensius, and Marcus Porcius Cato, the son of Cato the Younger, and Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus, the father of Livia, who became Octavian&#x27;s wife. Some of the nobles who were able to escape negotiated their surrender to Antony and entered his service. Among them were Lucius Calpurnius Bibulus and Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus. Apparently, the nobles did not want to deal with the young and merciless Octavian.

The remains of the Liberators&#x27; army were rounded up, and roughly 14,000 men were enrolled into the triumvirs&#x27; army. Old veterans were discharged back to Italy, but some of the veterans remained in the town of Philippi, which became a Roman colony, &quot;Colonia Victrix Philippensium&quot;.

Antony remained in the East, while Octavian returned to Italy, with the difficult task of finding enough land on which to settle a large number of veterans. Although Sextus Pompey was controlling Sicily and Domitius Ahenobarbus still commanded the Republican fleet, the Republican resistance had been definitively crushed at Philippi.

The Battle of Philippi marked the highest point of Antony&#x27;s career: at that time he was the most famous Roman general and the senior partner of the Second Triumvirate.

==Quotations==
Plutarch famously reported that Brutus experienced a vision of a ghost a few months before the battle. One night he saw a huge and shadowy form appearing in front of him; when he asked, &quot;What and whence art thou?&quot; it answered &quot;Thy evil spirit, Brutus: I shall see thee at Philippi.&quot; He again met the ghost the night before the battle. This episode is one of the most famous in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;.

Cassius Dio reports that at the last Brutus quoted from a Greek tragedy: &quot;O wretched Virtue, thou wert but a name, and yet I worshipped thee as real indeed; but now, it seems, thou were but fortune&#x27;s slave.&quot;

Augustus&#x27;s own version of the Battle of Philippi was: &quot;I sent into exile the murderers of my father, punishing their crimes with lawful tribunals; and afterwards, when they made war upon the Republic, I twice defeated them in battle.&quot;

== Popular culture ==
The battle is depicted in Acts IV and V of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, in which the two battles are merged into a single day&#x27;s events.

A fictionalised account of the battle is depicted in the sixth episode of the second season of the HBO television series &quot;Rome&quot;. There is but a single battle and both Cassius and Brutus fall in battle instead of being suicides, though Brutus&#x27;s death is a lone, suicidal attack on the triumvirate&#x27;s advancing forces, which stab him multiple times, in a similar vein to how he and other senators stabbed Julius Caesar.
