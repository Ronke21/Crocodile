<text>The Willamette River ( ) is a major tributary of the Columbia River, accounting for 12 to 15 percent of the Columbia&#x27;s flow. The Willamette&#x27;s main stem is long, lying entirely in northwestern Oregon in the United States. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form the Willamette Valley, a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon&#x27;s population, including the state capital, Salem, and the state&#x27;s largest city, Portland, which surrounds the Willamette&#x27;s mouth at the Columbia.

Originally created by plate tectonics about 35 million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river&#x27;s drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods at the end of the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000 years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well.

Rich with sediments deposited by flooding and fed by prolific rainfall on the western side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America, and it was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19th century, although Willamette Falls, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21st century, major highways follow the river, and roads cross the main stem on approximately 30 different bridges. More than half a dozen bridges not open to motorized vehicles provide separate crossings for bicycles and pedestrians, mostly in the Eugene area, and several others are exclusively for rail traffic. There are also ferries that convey cars, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, and pedestrians across the river for a fare and provided river conditions permit. They are the Buena Vista Ferry between Marion County and Polk County south of Independence and Salem, the Wheatland Ferry between Marion County and Polk County north of Salem and Keizer, and Canby Ferry in Clackamas County north of Canby.

Since 1900, more than 15 large dams and many smaller ones have been built in the Willamette&#x27;s drainage basin, 13 of which are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The dams are used primarily to produce hydroelectricity, to maintain reservoirs for recreation, and to prevent flooding. The river and its tributaries support 60 fish species, including many species of salmon and trout; this is despite the dams, other alterations, and pollution (especially on the river&#x27;s lower reaches). Part of the Willamette Floodplain was established as a National Natural Landmark in 1987, and the river was named as one of 14 American Heritage Rivers in 1998.

==Course==
The upper tributaries of the Willamette originate in the mountains south and southeast of Eugene, Oregon. Formed by the confluence of the Middle Fork Willamette River and the Coast Fork Willamette River near Springfield, the main stem Willamette meanders generally north for to the Columbia River. The river&#x27;s two most significant course deviations occur at Newberg, where it turns sharply east, and about downstream from Newberg, where it turns north again. Near its mouth north of downtown Portland, the river splits into two channels that flow around Sauvie Island. Used for navigation purposes, these channels are managed by the U.S. federal government. The main channel, which is the primary navigational conduit for Portland&#x27;s harbor and riverside industrial areas, is deep and varies in width from , although the river broadens to in some of its lower reaches. This channel enters the Columbia about from the Columbia&#x27;s mouth on the Pacific Ocean. The smaller Multnomah Channel, a distributary, is long, about wide, and deep. It ends about farther downstream on the Columbia, near St. Helens in Columbia County.

Proposals have been made for deepening the Multnomah Channel to in conjunction with roughly of tandem-maintained navigation on the Columbia River. Between the 1850s and the 1960s, channel-straightening and flood control projects, as well as agricultural and urban encroachment, cut the length of the river between the McKenzie River confluence and Harrisburg by 65 percent. Similarly, the river was shortened by 40 percent in the stretch between Harrisburg and Albany.

Interstate 5 and three branches of Oregon Route 99 are the two major highways that follow the river for its entire length. Communities along the main stem include Springfield and Eugene in Lane County; Harrisburg in Linn County; Corvallis in Benton County; Albany in Linn and Benton counties; Independence in Polk County; Salem in Marion County; Newberg in Yamhill County; Oregon City, West Linn, Milwaukie, and Lake Oswego in Clackamas County; and Portland in Multnomah and Washington counties. Significant tributaries from source to mouth include the Middle and Coast forks and the McKenzie, Long Tom, Marys, Calapooia, Santiam, Luckiamute, Yamhill, Molalla, Tualatin, and Clackamas rivers.

Beginning at above sea level, the main stem descends between source and mouth, or about 2.3 feet per mile (0.4 m per km). The gradient is slightly steeper from the source to Albany than it is from Albany to Oregon City. At Willamette Falls, between West Linn and Oregon City, the river plunges about . For the rest of its course, the river is extremely low-gradient and is affected by Pacific Ocean tidal effects from the Columbia. The main stem of the Willamette varies in width from about .

===Discharge===

With an average flow at the mouth of about , the Willamette ranks 19th in volume among rivers in the United States and contributes 12 to 15 percent of the total flow of the Columbia River. The Willamette&#x27;s flow varies considerably season to season, averaging about in August to more than in December.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) operates five stream gauges along the river, at Harrisburg, Corvallis, Albany, Salem, and Portland. The average discharge at the lowermost gauge, near the Morrison Bridge in Portland, was between 1972 and 2013. Located at river mile (RM) 12.8 or river kilometer (RK) 20.6, the gauge measures the flow from an area of , roughly 97 percent of the Willamette basin. The highest flow recorded at this station was on February 9, 1996, during the Willamette Valley Flood of 1996, and the minimum was on July 10, 1978. The highest recorded flow of for the Willamette at a different gauge in Portland occurred during a flood in 1861. This and many other large flows preceded the Flood Control Act of 1936 and dam construction on the Willamette&#x27;s major tributaries.

The river below Willamette Falls, from the mouth, is affected by semidiurnal tides, and gauges have detected reverse flows (backwards river flows) below Ross Island at RM 15 (RK 24). The National Weather Service issues tide forecasts for the river at the Morrison Bridge.

==Geology==
The Willamette River basin was created primarily by plate tectonics and volcanism and was altered by erosion and sedimentation, including deposits from enormous glacial floods as recent as 13,000 years ago. The oldest rocks beneath the Willamette Valley are the Siletz River Volcanics. About 35 million years ago, these rocks were subducted by the Farallon Plate beneath the North American Plate, creating the forearc basin that would later become the Willamette Valley. The valley was initially part of the continental shelf, rather than a separate inland sea. Many layers of marine deposits formed in the forearc basin and cover the older Siletz River Volcanics. About 20 to 16 million years ago, uplift formed the Coast Range and separated the basin from the Pacific Ocean.

Basalts of the Columbia River Basalt Group, from eruptions primarily in eastern Oregon, flowed across large parts of the northern half of the basin about 15 million years ago. They covered the Tualatin Mountains (West Hills), most of the Tualatin Valley, and the slopes of hills farther south, with up to of lava. Later deposits covered the basalt with up to of silt in the Portland and Tualatin basins. During the Pleistocene, beginning roughly 2.5 million years ago, volcanic activity in the Cascades combined with a cool, moist climate to produce further heavy sedimentation across the basin, and braided rivers created alluvial fans spreading down from the east.

Between about 15,500 and 13,000 years ago, the Missoula Floods—a series of large outpourings originating at Glacial Lake Missoula in Montana—swept down the Columbia River and backfilled the Willamette watershed. Each flood produced &quot;discharges that exceeded the annual discharge of all the present-day rivers of the world combined&quot;. Filling the Willamette basin to depths of in the Portland region, each flood created a temporary lake, Lake Allison, that stretched from Lake Oswego to near Eugene. The ancestral Tualatin Valley, part of the Willamette basin, flooded as well; water depths ranged from at Lake Oswego to as far upstream (west) as Forest Grove. Flood deposits of silt and clay, ranging in thickness from in the north to about in the south, settled from this muddy water to form today&#x27;s valley floor. The floods carried Montana icebergs well into the basin, where they melted and dropped glacial erratics onto the land surface. These rocks, composed of granite and other materials common to central Montana but not to the Willamette Valley, include more than 40 boulders, each at least in diameter. Before being partly chipped away and removed, the largest of these originally weighed about .

The northern part of the watershed is underlain by a network of faults capable of producing earthquakes at any time, and many small quakes have been recorded in the basin since the mid-19th century. In 1993, the Scotts Mills earthquake—the largest recent earthquake in the valley, measuring 5.6 on the Richter scale—was centered near Scotts Mills, about south of Portland. It caused $30 million in damage, including harm to the Oregon State Capitol in Salem. Evidence suggests that massive quakes of 8 or more on the Richter scale have occurred historically in the Cascadia subduction zone off the Oregon coast, most recently in 1700 CE, and that others as strong as 9 on the Richter scale occur every 500 to 800 years. The basin&#x27;s high population density, its nearness to this subduction zone, and its loose soils, which tend to amplify shaking, make the Willamette Valley especially vulnerable to damage from strong earthquakes.

==Watershed==
The Willamette River drains a region of , which is 12 percent of the total area of Oregon. Bounded by the Coast Range to the west and the Cascade Range to the east, the river basin is about long and wide. Elevations within the watershed range from at Mount Jefferson in the Cascade Range to at the mouth on the Columbia River. Watersheds bordering the Willamette River basin are those of the Little Deschutes River to the southeast, the Deschutes River to the east, and the Sandy River to the northeast; the North Umpqua and Umpqua rivers to the south; coastal rivers including (from south to north) the Siuslaw, the Alsea, the Yaquina, the Siletz, the Nestucca, the Trask, and the Wilson to the west; the Nehalem and the Clatskanie to the northwest, and the Columbia River to the north.

About 2.5 million people lived in the Willamette River basin as of 2010, about 65 percent of the population of Oregon. As of 2009, the basin contained 20 of the 25 most populous cities in Oregon. These cities include Springfield, Eugene, Corvallis, Albany, Salem, Keizer, Newberg, Oregon City, West Linn, Milwaukie, Lake Oswego, and Portland. The largest is Portland, with more than 500,000 residents. Not all of these cities draw water in part or exclusively from the Willamette for their municipal water supply. Other cities in the watershed (but not on the main-stem river) with populations of 20,000 or more are Gresham, Hillsboro, Beaverton, Tigard, McMinnville, Tualatin, Woodburn, and Forest Grove.

Sixty-four percent of the watershed is privately owned, while 36 percent is publicly owned. The U.S. Forest Service manages 30 percent of the watershed, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management 5 percent, and the State of Oregon 1 percent. Sixty-eight percent of the watershed is forested; agriculture, concentrated in the Willamette Valley, makes up 19 percent, and urban areas cover 5 percent. More than of roads criss-cross the watershed.

In 1987, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior designated of the watershed in Benton County as a National Natural Landmark. This area is the Willamette Floodplain, the largest remaining unplowed native grassland in the North Pacific geologic province, which encompasses most of the Pacific Northwest coast.

==History==

===First inhabitants===

For at least 10,000 years, a variety of indigenous peoples populated the Willamette Valley. These included the Kalapuya, the Chinook, and the Clackamas. The territory of the Clackamas encompassed the northeastern portion of the basin, including the Clackamas River (with which their name is shared). Although it is unclear exactly when, the territory of the Chinook once extended across the northern part of the watershed, through the Columbia River valley. Indigenous peoples of the Willamette Valley were further divided into groups including the Kalapuyan-speaking Yamhill and Atfalati (Tualatin) (both Northern Kalapuya), Central Kalapuya like the Santiam, Muddy Creek (Chemapho), Long Tom (Chelamela), Calapooia (Tsankupi), Marys River (Chepenafa) and Luckiamute, and the Yoncalla or Southern Kalapuya, as well other tribes such as the Chuchsney-Tufti, Siuslaw and Molala. The name &quot;Willamette&quot; is of indigenous origin, deriving from the French pronunciation of the name of a Clackamas Native American village. However, Native American languages in Oregon were very similar, so the name may also be derived from Kalapuya dialects.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG 3/18/10&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the year 1850, the Kalapuya numbered between 2,000 and 3,000 and were distributed among several groups. These figures are only speculative; there may have been as few as eight subgroups or as many as 16. In that time period, the Clackamas&#x27; tribal population was roughly 1,800. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the Chinook population was nearly 5,000, though not all of the Chinook lived on the Willamette. The Chinook territory encompassed the lower Columbia River valley and significant stretches of the Pacific coast on both the north and the south side of the Columbia&#x27;s mouth. At times, however, the Chinook territory extended even farther south in the Willamette Valley. The total native population was estimated at 15,000.

The indigenous peoples of the Willamette River practiced a variety of life ways. Those on the lower river, slightly closer to the coast, often relied on fishing as their primary economic mainstay. Salmon was the most important fish to Willamette River tribes as well as to the Native Americans of the Columbia River, where white traders traded fish with the Native Americans. Upper-river tribes caught steelhead and salmon, often by building weirs across tributary streams. Tribes of the northern Willamette Valley practiced a generally settled lifestyle. The Chinooks lived in great wooden lodges, practiced slavery, and had a well-defined caste system. People of the south were more nomadic, traveling from place to place with the seasons. They were known for the controlled burning of woodlands to create meadows for hunting and plant gathering (especially camas).

===18th century===
The Willamette River first appeared in written records in 1792, when it was observed by British Lieutenant William Robert Broughton of the Vancouver Expedition, led by George Vancouver.

===19th century===
The 1805-1806 Lewis and Clark Expedition originally missed the mouth of the Willamette. On their return journey, only after receiving directions from natives along the Sandy River did the explorers learn about their oversight. William Clark returned down the Columbia and entered the Willamette River in April 1806.

Fur trappers originally working for the Pacific Fur Company (PFC)) and subsequently for the North West Company (NWC) were next to visit the Willamette River and various tributaries. The Siskiyou Trail (or California-Oregon Trail) originally developed by Indigenous people, was used to reach farther south. This trail, over long, stretched from the mouth of the Willamette River near present-day Portland south through the Willamette Valley, crossing the Siskiyou Mountains, and south through the Sacramento Valley to San Francisco.

In 1812, William Henry and Alfred Seton paddled up from Fort Astoria (PFC) on the Columbia River into the mouth of the Willamette, continued on until the falls portage (present-day Oregon City) and finished their journey at a flattening of both banks, the later site of Champoeg. A first trading post was established. By early 1813, William Wallace and John C. Halsey established a second outpost, Wallace House, farther south, north of present-day Salem. 

By the end of the War of 1812, the NWC acquired the PFC. Free trappers Registre Bellaire, John Day and Alexander Carson hunted and traded furs during the winter of 1813-14 along the Willamette. About thirty NWC employees were stationed at the Champoeg post, now called the Willamette Trading Post, along with freemen housed in two huts and Kalapuya nearby. Nez Perce and Cayuse warned the NWC to stay out of the Willamette Valley hunting grounds. Skirmishes went on for several years over fishing and hunting grounds contended by several groups.

By the winter of 1818-19, Thomas McKay led a hunting brigade farther south towards the sources of the Willamette River and reached the upper Umpqua River. More violent skirmishes were fought. Most brigade members returned to Fort George (formerly called Fort Astoria). Louis LaBonté, Joseph Gervais, Étienne Lucier, Louis Kanota, and Louis Pichette (dit DuPré) remained in the Willamette Valley as free trappers. Meanwhile, in 1821 the HBC merged with the NWC. In 1825 a new Fort Vancouver headquarters was built on the north shore of the Columbia closer to the Willamette, and Fort George was closed. Alexander Roderick McLeod traveled up the Willamette in 1826 and 1827, to the Umpqua and the Rogue rivers.

In 1829 Lucier established a land claim near the Champoeg trading post and started to settle, soon joined by Gervais (1831), Pierre Belleque (1833) and 77 French Canadian settlers by 1836. By 1843, approximately 100 newcomer families lived in the vicinity of the Willamette on a section referred to as French Prairie.

By 1841, members of the United States Exploring Expedition came through the Siskiyou Trail. They noted extensive salmon fishing by natives at Willamette Falls, much like that at Celilo Falls on the Columbia River.

In the middle part of the 19th century the Willamette Valley&#x27;s fertile soils, pleasant climate, and abundant water attracted thousands of settlers from the eastern United States, mainly the Upland South borderlands of Missouri, Iowa, and the Ohio Valley. Many of these emigrants followed the Oregon Trail, a trail across western North America that began at Independence, Missouri, and ended at various locations near the mouth of the Willamette River. Although people had been traveling to Oregon since 1836, large-scale migration did not begin until 1843, when nearly 1,000 pioneers headed westward. Over the next 25 years, some 500,000 settlers traveled the Oregon Trail, to reach the Willamette Valley.

Starting in the 1830s, Oregon City developed near Willamette Falls. It was incorporated in 1844, becoming the first city west of the Rocky Mountains to have that distinction. John McLoughlin, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) superintendent of the Columbia District, was one of the major contributors to the founding of the town in 1829. McLoughlin attempted to persuade the HBC (which still held sway over the area) to allow American settlers to live on the land, and provided significant help to American colonization of the area, all against the HBC&#x27;s orders. Oregon City prospered because of the lumber and grist mills that were run by the water power of Willamette Falls, but the falls formed an impassable barrier to river navigation. Linn City (originally Robins Nest) was established across the Willamette from Oregon City.

After Portland was incorporated in 1851, quickly growing into Oregon&#x27;s largest city, Oregon City gradually lost its importance as the economic and political center of the Willamette Valley. Beginning in the 1850s, steamboats began to ply the Willamette, despite the fact that they could not pass Willamette Falls. As a result, navigation on the Willamette River was divided into two stretches: the lower stretch from Portland to Oregon City—which allowed connection with the rest of the Columbia River system—and the upper reach, which encompassed most of the Willamette&#x27;s length. Any boats whose owners found it absolutely necessary to get past the falls had to be portaged. This led to competition for business among steam portage companies. In 1873, the construction of the Willamette Falls Locks bypassed the falls and allowed easy navigation between the upper and lower river. Each lock chamber measured long and wide, and the canal was originally operated manually before it switched to electrical power. Usage of the locks peaked in the 1940s, and by the early 21st century, the lock system was little used. Since 2011, the Willamette Falls Locks have been inactive.

As commerce and industry flourished on the lower river, most of the original settlers acquired farms in the upper Willamette Valley. By the late 1850s, farmers had begun to grow crops on most of the available fertile land. The settlers increasingly encroached on Native American lands. Skirmishes between natives and settlers in the Umpqua and Rogue valleys to the southwest of the Willamette River led the Oregon state government to remove the natives by military force. They were first led off their traditional lands to the Willamette Valley, but soon were marched to the Coast Indian Reservation. In 1855, Joel Palmer, an Oregon legislator, negotiated a treaty with the Willamette Valley tribes, who, although unhappy with the treaty, ceded their lands to non-natives. The natives were then relocated by the government to a part of the Coast Reservation that later became the Grande Ronde Reservation.

Between 1879 and 1885, the Willamette River was charted by Cleveland S. Rockwell, a topographical engineer and cartographer for the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. Rockwell surveyed the lower Willamette from the foot of Ross Island through Portland to the Columbia River and then downstream on the Columbia to Bachelor Island. Rockwell&#x27;s survey was extremely detailed, including 17,782 hydrographic soundings. His work helped open the port of Portland to commerce.

In the second half of the 19th century, the USACE dredged channels and built locks and levees in the Willamette&#x27;s watershed. Although products such as lumber were often transported on an existing network of railroads in Oregon, these advances in navigation helped businesses deliver more goods to Portland, feeding the city&#x27;s growing economy. Trade goods from the Columbia basin north of Portland could also be transported southward on the Willamette due to the deeper channels made at the Willamette&#x27;s mouth.

===20th and 21st centuries===

By the early 20th century, major river-control projects had begun to take place. Levees were constructed along the river in most urban areas, and Portland built concrete walls to protect its downtown sector. In the following decades, many large dams were built on Cascade Range tributaries of the Willamette. The Army Corps of Engineers operates 13 such dams, which affect flows from about 40 percent of the basin. Most of them do not have fish ladders.

With development in and near the river came increased pollution. By the late 1930s, efforts to stem the pollution led to formation of a state sanitary board to oversee modest cleanup efforts. In the 1960s, Oregon Governor Tom McCall led a push for stronger pollution controls on the Willamette. In this, he was encouraged by Robert (Bob) Straub—the state treasurer and future Oregon governor (1975)—who first proposed a Willamette Greenway program during his 1966 gubernatorial campaign against McCall. The Oregon State Legislature established the program in 1967. Through it, state and local governments cooperated in creating or improving a system of parks, trails, and wildlife refuges along the river. In 1998, the Willamette became one of 14 rivers designated an American Heritage River by U.S. President Bill Clinton. By 2007 the Greenway had grown to include more than 170 separate land parcels, including 10 state parks. Public uses of the river and land along its shores include camping, swimming, fishing, boating, hiking, bicycling, and wildlife viewing.

In 2008, government agencies and the non-profit Willamette Riverkeeper organization designated the full length of the river as the Willamette River Water Trail. Four years later, the National Park Service added the Willamette water trail—expanded to to include some of the major tributaries—to its list of National Water Trails. The water trail system is meant to protect and restore waterways in the United States and enhance recreation on and near them.

A 1991 agreement between the City of Portland and the State of Oregon to dramatically reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) led to Portland&#x27;s Big Pipe Project. The project, part of a related series of Portland CSO projects completed in late 2011 at a cost of $1.44 billion, separates the city&#x27;s sanitary sewer lines from storm-water inputs that sometimes overwhelmed the combined system during heavy rains. When that occurred, some of the raw sewage in the system flowed into the river instead of into the city&#x27;s wastewater treatment plant. The Big Pipe project and related work reduces CSO volume on the lower river by about 94 percent.

In June 2014, Dean Hall became the first person to swim the entire length of the Willamette River. He swam from Eugene to the river mouth in 25 days.

In 2017, Human Access Project partnered with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation to open the city&#x27;s first officially recognized public swimming beach, Poet&#x27;s Beach.

==Dams==

There are more than 20 major dams on the Willamette&#x27;s tributaries, as well as a complex series of levees and channels to control the river&#x27;s flow.

The only dam on the Willamette&#x27;s main stem is the Willamette Falls Dam, a low weir-type structure at Willamette Falls that diverts water into the headraces of the adjacent mills and a power plant. The locks at Willamette Falls were completed in 1873. Elsewhere on the main stem, numerous minor flow-regulation structures force the river into a narrower and deeper channel to facilitate navigation and flood control.

The dams on the Willamette&#x27;s major tributaries are primarily large flood-control, water-storage, and power-generating dams. Thirteen of these dams were built from the 1940s through the 1960s and are operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Of those 13, 9 produce hydropower. Flood-control dams operated by the USACE are estimated to hold up to 27 percent of the Willamette&#x27;s runoff. They are used to regulate river flows so as to cut peaks off floods and increase low flows in late summer and autumn, and to divert water into deeper, narrower channels to prevent flooding. A relatively small of amount of the water stored in the reservoirs is used for irrigation.
Cougar Dam on the South Fork McKenzie River and Detroit Dam on the North Santiam River are the two tallest dams in the Willamette River basin. Detroit Dam is high and stores of water. Lookout Point Dam on the Middle Fork Willamette River, forming Lookout Point Lake, has the largest water storage capacity, at . The other 11 dams are Big Cliff on the North Santiam River; Green Peter and Foster on the Santiam River; Cougar on the South Fork McKenzie River; Blue River on the Blue River; Fern Ridge on the Long Tom River; Hills Creek and Dexter on the Middle Fork Willamette River; Fall Creek on Fall Creek; Cottage Grove on the Coast Fork Willamette River, and Dorena on the Row River.

Due to these tall dams, Chinook salmon and steelhead are blocked from roughly half of their historic habitat and spawning grounds on the Willamette&#x27;s major tributaries. Unable to live and reproduce as they once did, they have been &quot;brought to the brink of extinction&quot;. Endangered species listings and a subsequent lawsuit by Willamette Riverkeeper led to a plan to improve fish passage and take other actions to help native fish recover in 2008. Since then, work has proceeded slowly, and the Corps of Engineers, citing engineering difficulties and cost, may not meet the original agreed-upon deadline of 2023 for a system of effective remedies.

Other major dams in the Willamette watershed are owned by other interests; for example, several hydroelectric facilities on the Clackamas River are owned by Portland General Electric. These include the River Mill Hydroelectric Project, the Oak Grove project, and the dam at Timothy Lake.

==Bridges==

The 50 or so crossings of the Willamette River include many historic structures, such as the Van Buren Street Bridge, a swing bridge. Built in 1913, it carries Oregon Route 34 (Corvallis–Lebanon Highway) over the river upstream of RM 131 (RK 211) in Corvallis. The machinery to operate the swing span was removed in the 1950s. The Oregon City Bridge, built in 1922, replaced a suspension span constructed at the site in 1888. It carries Oregon Route 43 over the river at about RM 26 (RK 42) between Oregon City and West Linn.

The Ross Island Bridge carries U.S. Route 26 (Mount Hood Highway) over the river at RM 14 (RK 23). It is one of 10 highway bridges crossing the river in Portland. The bridge is the only cantilevered deck truss in Oregon.

Tilikum Crossing is a cable-stayed bridge that carries public transit, bicycles, and pedestrians, but no cars or trucks, over the river. It opened for general use on September 12, 2015, becoming the first new bridge built across the river in the Portland metropolitan area since 1973.

Farther downstream is the oldest remaining highway structure over the Willamette, the Hawthorne Bridge, built in 1910. It is the oldest vertical-lift bridge in operation in the United States and the oldest highway bridge in Portland. It is also the busiest bicycle and transit bridge in Oregon, with over 8,000 cyclists and 800 TriMet buses (carrying about 17,400 riders) daily.
Another historic structure, the Steel Bridge, farther downstream, was &quot;the largest telescoping bridge in the world at the time of its opening&quot; in 1912. It carries trains on its lower deck, MAX (Metropolitan Area Express) light-rail trains and motorized vehicles on its upper deck, and foot and bicycle traffic on a cantilevered walkway attached to the lower deck. When small ships must pass under the bridge, its double vertical-lift span can raise a lower railway deck without disturbing traffic on the upper deck. Operators can raise both decks as high as above the water. The Steel Bridge is &quot;believed to be the world&#x27;s only double-lift span that can raise its lower deck independently of the upper deck.&quot;

The Broadway Bridge, slightly downstream of the Steel Bridge, was the world&#x27;s longest double-leaf bascule drawbridge at the time of its construction in 1913. Farther downstream, the St. Johns Bridge, a steel suspension bridge built in 1931, replaced the last of the Willamette River ferries in Portland. At about RM 6 (RK 10), it carries the U.S. Route 30 Bypass. The bridge has two Gothic towers supporting the span. The adjacent park and neighborhood of Cathedral Park are named after the Gothic Cathedral-like appearance of the bridge towers. It is the tallest bridge in Portland, with tall towers and a navigational clearance.
==Flooding==

Due to the volume and seasonality of precipitation in western Oregon, the Willamette River has often flooded. Heavy rains and mountain snows are common in winter, and snowpack in the Cascade Range can rapidly melt during warmer winter storms. The greatest Willamette River flood in recorded history began in 1861, well before the construction of dams in the watershed.

Rainstorms and warm temperatures in December 1861 combined with a well-above-average snowpack in the Cascades created the largest Willamette River flood in recorded history. An observer of the flood wrote, &quot;The whole Willamette valley was a sheet of water&quot;. From Eugene to Portland, thousands of acres of farmland were washed away, and many towns in the valley were damaged or destroyed. The &quot;Great Flood&quot;, as it is sometimes called, was massively destructive to human development because most of that development was located on the river&#x27;s floodplain, which provided rich soils and ready access to water transportation. The 1861 flood peaked at —more than the Mississippi River usually discharges in the 21st century—and inundated some of land. This flood destroyed the town of Linn City. When the flood ended on December 14, only three homes remained standing in Linn City. No one died in the Linn City flood, but the destruction was too significant for the town to recover, and it was abandoned. Today the city of West Linn stands about where Linn City once was.

Significant flooding recurred in the winter of early 1890. Portland&#x27;s main street was completely submerged, communication over the Cascades was cut off, and many rail lines were forced to shut down. Another major flood occurred on the Willamette in 1894, and although it too caused much damage, it was not as large as that of 1861.

Throughout the 1940s the Willamette continued to flood its valley. It washed out five bridges in Lane County in December 1942, caused seven deaths in Portland and evacuations in Eugene in January 1943, flooded Corvallis in November 1946, contributed to the destruction of Vanport City and the death of about 15 of its residents in May 1948, and nearly flooded parts of Salem in December 1948.

Although the Willamette was, by the mid-20th century, heavily engineered and controlled by a complex system of dams, channels, and barriers, it experienced severe floods through the end of the century. Storms caused a major flood that swelled the Willamette and other rivers in the Pacific Northwest from December 1964 through January 1965, submerging nearly of land. Before dawn on December 21, 1964, the Willamette reached , which was higher than the seawall on its banks in Portland. By this time, about 15 people had died as a result of the flooding, and about 8,000 had been forced to evacuate their homes.

On December 24, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered federal aid for the flooded areas as the Willamette continued to rise. In the next couple of days, the river receded, but on December 27, it was at , which was still nearly above the flood stage. The river continued to pose flood threats through January 1965, and more stormy weather occurred along the Pacific Coast.

In February 1996, heavy warm rains driven by a subtropical jet stream fell on a deep snowpack in the Willamette watershed. These conditions, similar to those that caused the 1861 flood, caused some of the costliest flooding in the river&#x27;s recorded history. An Associated Press journalist reported, &quot;The river crested at one town after another—at Corvallis 3½ feet above flood stage, Oregon City 18 feet above, Portland 10.5 feet above—much like a meal moving through a boa constrictor.&quot; The flood was serious enough to interrupt the progress of Oregon&#x27;s growing economy, but the inundated acreage was smaller than in 1964—only about .

About 450 concrete flood-protection walls in Portland that had been constructed during the February flood, each weighing about , were removed in April 1996. In October, they were replaced by a larger steel wall that cost the city about $300,000. The new wall had removable steel plates designed to better prevent future flooding.

==Pollution==

Since as early as 1869, with the introduction of a federally funded &quot;snag puller&quot; designed to keep the waterway clear, human habitation has affected the ecology of the river basin. Domestic and industrial waste from the cities built up along the river &quot;essentially [turned] the main-stem river into an open sewer by the 1920s.&quot; The construction of large federal dams on the Willamette&#x27;s tributaries between 1941 and 1969 damaged the spawning grounds for spring Chinook salmon and steelhead. 

A 1927 City Club of Portland report labeled the waterway &quot;filthy and ugly&quot; and identified the City of Portland as the worst offender. The Oregon Anti-Stream Pollution League brought a pollution-abatement measure before the 39th Oregon Legislative Assembly in 1937. The bill passed, but Governor Charles Martin vetoed it. The Izaak Walton League and the Oregon affiliate of the National Wildlife Federation countered the governor&#x27;s veto with a ballot initiative, which passed in November 1938.

Governor Tom McCall, shortly after he was elected in 1966, ordered water quality tests on the Willamette, conducted his own research on the water quality, and became head of the Oregon State Sanitary Authority. McCall learned that the river was heavily polluted in Portland. In a television documentary, &quot;Pollution in Paradise&quot;, he said, &quot;The Willamette River was actually cleaner when the Oregon Sanitary Authority was created in 1938 than it was in 1962.&quot; He then discouraged tourism in the state and made it harder for companies to qualify for a permit to operate near the river. He also regulated how much those companies could pollute and closed plants that did not meet state pollution standards.

Despite earlier cleanup efforts, state studies in the 1990s identified a wide variety of pollutants in the river bottom, including heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and pesticides along the lower of the river, in Portland. As a result, this section of the river was designated a Superfund site in 2000, involving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in cleanup of the river bottom. The area to be addressed stretches from the Fremont Bridge almost to the Columbia – spanning nearly 11 river miles. Reducing risk from the pollutants in this stretch will involve removing contaminated sediment from the river bottom and efforts to contain contaminated sediment by placing clean sediment on top (known as &quot;capping&quot;). Pollution has been exacerbated by combined sewer overflows, which the city has greatly reduced through its Big Pipe Project. Farther upstream, the pressing environmental issues have mainly been variations in pH and dissolved oxygen. The Willamette is nevertheless clean enough to be used by cities such as Corvallis and Wilsonville for drinking water.

Since pollution concerns are primarily along the lower river, the Willamette in general scores relatively high on the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI), which is compiled by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). The DEQ considers index scores of less than 60 to be very poor; the other categories are 60–79 (poor); 80–84 (fair); 85–89 (good), and 90–100 (excellent). The Willamette River&#x27;s water quality is rated excellent near the source, though it gradually declines to fair near the mouth. Between 1998 and 2007, the average score for the upper Willamette at Springfield (RM 185, RK 298) was 93. At Salem (RM 84, RK 135), the score was 89, and good scores continued down to the Hawthorne Bridge in Portland (RM 13, RK 21) at 85. Scores were in the &quot;fair&quot; category farther downstream; the least favorable reading was 81 at the Swan Island Channel midpoint (RM 0.5, RK 0.8). By comparison, sites on the Winchuck River, the Clackamas, and the North Santiam all scored 95, and a site at a pump station on Klamath Strait Drain between Upper Klamath Lake and Lower Klamath Lake recorded the lowest score in Oregon at 19.

==Flora and fauna==

Over the past 150 years, a significant change for the Willamette River has been the loss of its floodplain forests, which covered an estimated 89 percent of a band along each river bank in 1850. By 1990, only 37 percent of this zone was forested; the rest had been converted to farm fields or cleared for urban or suburban uses. The remaining forests close to the river include stands of black cottonwood, Oregon ash, willow, and bigleaf maple. The central valley—a former perennial grass prairie interspersed with oak, Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, and other trees—is devoted almost entirely to farming. Douglas fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar dominate the forest on the Coast Range side of the basin. Forests to the east in the Cascade Range are predominantly Douglas fir, Pacific silver fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar.

Fish in the Willamette basin include 31 native species, among them cutthroat, bull, and rainbow trout, several species of salmon, sucker, minnow, sculpin, and lamprey, as well as sturgeon, stickleback, and others. Among the 29 non-native species in the basin, there are brook, brown, and lake trout, largemouth and smallmouth bass, walleye, carp, bluegill, and others. In addition to fish, the basin supports 18 species of amphibians, such as the Pacific giant salamander. Beaver and river otter are among 69 mammal species living in the watershed, also frequented by 154 bird species, such as the American dipper, osprey, and harlequin duck. Garter snakes are among the 15 species of reptiles found in the basin.

Species diversity is greatest along the lower river and its tributaries. Threatened, endangered, or sensitive species include spring Chinook salmon, winter steelhead, chum salmon, Coho salmon and Oregon chub. In the central valley, several projects have been done to restore and protect wetlands in order to provide habitat for bald eagles, Fender&#x27;s blue butterfly, Oregon chub, Bradshaw&#x27;s desert parsley, a variety of Willamette fleabane, and Kincaid&#x27;s lupine. In the early 21st century, osprey populations are increasing along the river, possibly because of a ban on the pesticide DDT and on the birds&#x27; ability to use power poles for nesting. Beaver populations, presumed to be much lower than historic levels, are increasing throughout the basin.

<text>Bouches-du-Rhône ( ; , ; ; &quot;the Mouths of the Rhône&quot;) is a department in southern France. It borders Vaucluse to the north, Gard to the west and Var to the east. The Mediterranean Sea lies to the south. Its prefecture and largest city is Marseille; other important cities include Aix-en-Provence, Arles, Martigues and Aubagne.

Marseille, France&#x27;s second-largest city, has one of the largest container ports in the country. It prides itself on being France&#x27;s oldest city, founded by Greek settlers from Phocaea around 600 BC. Bouches-du-Rhône is the most populous department of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region, with 2,043,110 inhabitants as of 2019. It has an area of . Its INSEE and postal code is 13.

== History ==

The history of the area is closely linked to that of Provence. Marseille has been an important harbour since before Julius Caesar&#x27;s conquest of Gaul. The Roman presence left numerous monuments across the department. Notable people born in the area include Romantic painter Camille Roqueplan and his brother, journalist and theatre director Nestor Roqueplan.

Bouches-du-Rhône is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was created from the western part of the former province of Provence and the principalities of Orange, Martigues and Lambesc. It lost part of its territory in 1793, including Orange and Apt, when the department of Vaucluse was created.

Following its creation, the department strongly supported the French Revolution, containing 90 Jacobin Clubs by 1794. It was also noteworthy that more than half of the priests in the department accepted the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which in effect subordinated the church to the government.

==Geography==
===Natural regions===

The department is part of the current region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur. It is surrounded by the departments of Gard on the west, Vaucluse on the north and Var on the east, as well as by the Mediterranean Sea on the south. The Rhône river delta forms a vast swampy wetlands area called the Camargue in the southwestern part of the department. The Rove Tunnel, the world&#x27;s longest canal tunnel from Marseille to the Étang de Berre, as well as smaller canals further west, allowed for waterway transport from Marseille to the Rhône until 1963, when the Rove Tunnel closed to traffic.

Bouches-du-Rhône is bordered by the rivers Rhône to the west and Durance to the north. The Rhône divides into the &quot;Grand Rhône&quot; and &quot;Petit Rhône&quot; south of Arles; the area between forms the Camargue. The principal mountains of the department are the Sainte-Baume massif (1,042 metres – 3,418 feet), Montagne Sainte-Victoire (1,011 metres – 3,316 feet), the Garlaban and Alpilles massifs.

===Seismic activity===
The department of Bouches-du-Rhône is also known for its seismic activity: the zone II (&quot;average seismic activity&quot;) townships of Lambesc Peyrolles-en-Provence and Salon-de-Provence are the most exposed.
Areas Ib (&quot;low seismic activity&quot;) including the cantons of Aix-en-Provence, Trets Eyguières, Orgon, Berre-Pond, Istres, Istres-North and South, and Ia areas (&quot;very low seismic activity&quot;) including the other cantons in the district of Aix-en-Provence, Arles-East, Châteaurenard, Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, Marignane, Martigues-East and Roquevaire-West, are least exposed. Zone 0 (&quot;negligible seismic activity&quot;) includes the rest of the department.

==Climate==
The department has a Mediterranean climate, with contrasting temperatures within a range of 15 degrees. Precipitation is irregular, with only 65 days per year where rain falls in excess of 1 mm. However it falls in sudden downpours, with an average of annually. This mainly happens in the spring and autumn; summer is very hot, winter mild. Violent winds are common, especially the mistral, which blows 100 days per year with a maximum of . The coast is drier, especially along the Côte Bleue, the Calanques and the bay of La Ciotat, which include some of the driest areas in France, with only of rain per year. Higher areas receive more precipitation and lower temperatures. The Arc region in the interior is much colder than other areas, with heavy frosts in winter.
==Demographics==
===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Marseille, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 14 communes with more than 20,000 inhabitants:

There are 15 more communes with over 10,000 inhabitants: Châteauneuf-les-Martigues, Port-de-Bouc, Châteaurenard, Tarascon, Fos-sur-Mer, Bouc-Bel-Air, Berre-l&#x27;Étang, Saint-Martin-de-Crau, Auriol, Rognac, Plan-de-Cuques, Septèmes-les-Vallons, Pélissanne, Trets and Fuveau.

==Politics==
===History===

Since Bouches-du-Rhône is one of the most populous and diverse departments of France, it has long been the scene of particularly fierce political battles. The development of the Marseille-Fos Port, the relationship maintained between France and its colonial empire, the industry around coal mining in Provence, as well as significant immigration, especially coming from Italy, from the end the 19th century and during the period between the two world wars are all factors that led to the emergence of a large and militant working class. From the late 19th century, the socialist movement gained influence, such as in 1881 by the election of the country&#x27;s first socialist member of parliament, Clovis Hugues. Rural areas, particularly in the region of Aix-en-Provence, have tended to favour the influence of right-wing parties, including monarchists and Catholics at the beginning of the French Third Republic. The interwar period and the time of the Popular Front marked the beginning of the dominance of the left in the department, first with the election of the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO).
After the Second World War, the Marseillais right, linked to the underworld and who collaborated with the German occupation, was widely discredited. The left largely dominated the Liberation and Marseille even saw the election in 1946 of Communist Mayor Jean Cristofol. In 1947 the SFIO led an alliance with right and centre parties against the Communists, resulting six years later in the election of Gaston Defferre as Mayor of Marseille, a position he held until his death in 1986. The dominance of socialism was, however, challenged by deindustrialisation. The conservative success in 1995 by Jean-Claude Gaudin in Marseille is a symbol of widespread political shifts while even the former communists bastions of La Ciotat and Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rhône voted for the right. The 1990s saw the rise of the National Front, including its victories in municipal elections of Marignane and Vitrolles.

The President of the Departmental Council has been Martine Vassal of the right-wing The Republicans party since 2015, after former Socialist President Jean-Noël Guérini was voted out of office and has faced corruption charges.

In the 2022 French presidential election, just like five years prior, Marine Le Pen of the National Rally (formerly National Front) won a majority in Bouches-du-Rhône in the first round, before incumbent Emmanuel Macron of La République En Marche! won a majority in the second round.

===Members of the National Assembly===
Bouches-du-Rhône elected the following members of the National Assembly in the 2017 legislative election:

===Departmental Council of Bouches-du-Rhône===

Below is a list of seats won by the department&#x27;s different parties after the 2015 departmental elections.

== Culture ==

The department is well represented in French art. Paul Cézanne painted numerous representations of the Mont Sainte-Victoire. Vincent van Gogh spent two years in Arles, painting many scenes in the area. The department&#x27;s main museums include the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations, the Musée de la Faïence de Marseille and the Marseille History Museum.

<text>Tarascon (; ), sometimes referred to as Tarascon-sur-Rhône, is a commune situated at the extreme west of the Bouches-du-Rhône department of France in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region. Inhabitants are referred to as Tarasconnais or Tarasconnaises. The patron saint of the city is Martha of Bethany, whose motto is &quot;Concordia Felix&quot;.
==Geography==
Tarascon is located south of Avignon and north of Arles, on the left (east) bank of the river Rhône. On the other side is the similarly sized town of Beaucaire in the &quot;département&quot; of Gard, &quot;région&quot; of Occitania. Directly opposite each other and connected by several bridges, Beaucaire and Tarascon effectively constitute one town, with about 30,000 inhabitants. An irrigation canal of 18,00 km length rejoins the Rhone near Tarascon.

== History ==

Shards dating from the Late Bronze Age have been found in a shelter at a place called the Lèque, confirming the existence of human settlement in the Alpilles since prehistoric times. Settlement spread in the early Iron Age. At Tarascon, the sites sit alongside the Rhone, near the church of Sainte-Marthe.

In the second part of the first Iron Age (7th–6th centuries BC), the population, shifted from a nomadic lifestyle to a sedentary one and began to construct extensive buildings. Trade intensified with the Eastern Mediterranean, with the people of the area likely trading grain for luxury goods.

Located along the Rhone, at the crossroads between Avignon, the Camargue and the Luberon, Tarascon is still associated with fairy tales and legends dating back to prehistory. According to tradition, Martha of Bethany, who came from Judea, landed at Tarascon c. AD 48 where an amphibious dragon or tarasque was destroying the river traffic. She tamed the beast only for it to be butchered by the townspeople. Many pilgrims visit the Royal College of Sainte-Marthe, built in her honor near the castle of King René. This sanctuary, the main monument of the city, contains the relics and the tomb of St. Martha in the crypt which was built on the exact location of her house.

Rostagnetus of Tharascone, knight, was provost of Nice, Alderman of Tarascon (1322, 1325) and son of former co-lords of the city in the 12th century. In 1366–67, Guillam de Sault ruled Tarascon. He received an annual salary of 90 florins. The death of Queen Joanna I reopened a succession crisis at the head of the County of Provence, the cities of the Aix Union (1382–1387) supporting Charles de Duras against Louis I of Anjou . Tarascon hesitated before joining the Union of Aix, the community deciding in 1383, without committing itself very firmly. When Louis I died, Tarascon was also one of the first cities to receive Jacques Reillanne, Ambassador of his widow Marie de Blois, regent of Louis II of Anjou, in the summer of 1385. He successfully persuaded them to switch sides and join the Angevin Kings of Anjou. The castle is well preserved. The work of construction began in 1400 under Louis II of Anjou and completed in 1449 by his son, King René, led by Guillaume Crespin, captain of the castle, and his lieutenant, Regnault Serocourt, its close relative . With an impressive defensive system, the building also houses a princely residence.

The town was damaged by Allied bombings from June to August 1944, during World War II. The bombings, targeting the bridges across the Rhone in an attempt to hamper the German retreat, destroyed parts of the old town. The first bombing took place on 25 June 1944. On 16 August 1944 the tip of the church tower of Église Sainte-Marthe was destroyed.

===Collegiate Church===

&quot;Église collégiale Ste Marthe&quot; (St Martha&#x27;s Collegiate Church) is where, according to a local tradition, the biblical figure Martha is buried. The church was built half-Romanesque in the 12th century and half-Gothic in the 14th century. The crypt dates from the 3rd century.

Collegiate Sainte-Marthe was dedicated in 1197 and enlarged in the 14th and 15th centuries. The crypt houses the relics of Martha in a sarcophagus of the fourth century.

===Medieval castle===
The castle of King René. The present castle replaced a fortress, built on the site of the Roman town to monitor the border of Provence. After the destruction perpetrated in 1399 by the bands of Raymond de Turenne, the Anjou family decided to rebuild it entirely. The construction of the current castle of Tarascon was started in 1401 by Louis II of Anjou. The construction was continued by his first son, Louis III of Anjou, and was completed in 1449 by his second son, René I of Naples (René d&#x27;Anjou). Thus, the castle is often referred to as &quot;le château du roi René&quot; (King René&#x27;s castle). It was turned into a military prison in the 17th century, until its acquisition by the state in 1932.

It consists of two independent parts: the South, the stately home, flanked by round towers on the city side and river side with walls of up to 48 m high and square towers and the North, the lower court that defends the rectangular constructions. It stands right on the banks of the Rhône opposite Château de Beaucaire, and near St Martha&#x27;s Collegiate Church.

A mythological monster, the Tarasque, is said to have lived there at the beginning of the 1st century. It was purportedly tamed by Martha in 48 AD. See Tarasque for details.

The novel &quot;Tartarin de Tarascon&quot; (1872) and its two sequels &quot;Tartarin sur les Alpes&quot; (1885) and &quot;Port-Tarascon&quot; (1890), by Alphonse Daudet, were set here. From 1985 to 2008, there was a small museum in the town, dedicated to the fictional character Tartarin.

Apart from agriculture, the industry most easily identifiable around the Alpilles is tourism. Even the wine and olive oil producers take into account the development of tourism and increasingly offer tasting services. There are three main types of tourism in the Alpilles. First, the historical and cultural tourism that relies on a rich historical heritage (Les Baux-de-Provence, Glanum, etc..) or festivals. Second, the relaxation tourism resulting in a significant expansion of B&amp;Bs, hotels and rented properties. Finally, the green tourism that benefits from the many hiking trails and protected framework offered by the massif and its surroundings.

<text>Arles ( , , ; ; Classical ) is a coastal city and commune in the South of France, a subprefecture in the Bouches-du-Rhône department of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region, in the former province of Provence.

A large part of the Camargue, the largest wetlands in France, is located within the territory of the commune, which is the largest in Metropolitan France in terms of geographic territory. In non-metropolitan France, Maripasoula in French Guiana is the largest French commune in general. 

The commune&#x27;s land area is roughly similar to that of Singapore. The city has a long history, and was of considerable importance in the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis. The Roman and Romanesque Monuments of Arles were listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1981 for their testimony to the history of the region.

The city is famous for being the archdiocese of Caesarius of Arles and Hilary of Arles. Additionally, many artists have lived and worked in this area, including Pablo Picasso, Paul Gauguin and Jacques Réattu. The Dutch post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh lived in Arles from 1888 to 1889, and produced over 300 paintings and drawings during his time there. These are held in internationally known museums and private collections around the world. An international photography festival has been held annually in the city since 1970.
== Name ==
The settlement is attested as &quot;Arelate&quot; in the mid-1st century BC (Caesar), &quot;Areláte&quot; (Ἀρελάτε) in the early 1st c. AD (Strabo), &quot;Arlate civitas&quot; in 954, and &quot;Arle&quot; in the 13th century. The toponym &quot;Arelate&quot; is a Latinized form of the Gaulish *&quot;Arelati&quot;, meaning &#x27;by the marsh&#x27;, or &#x27;in front of the marsh&#x27;.

==Geography==
The river Rhône forks into two branches just upstream of Arles, forming the Camargue delta. Because the Camargue is for a large part administratively part of Arles, the commune as a whole is the largest commune in Metropolitan France in terms of territory. But its population numbers only slightly more than 50,000. Its area is , which is more than seven times the area of Paris.

In addition to the city proper in the north of the territory, the commune of Arles includes a number of outlying towns and hamlets, including Albaron, Gageron, Mas-Thibert, Moulès, Pont-de-Crau, Raphèle-lès-Arles, Saliers, Salin-de-Giraud and Le Sambuc.

==History==

===Ancient era===
The Ligurians were in this area from about 800 BC. Later Celtic influences have also been discovered. The city became an important Phoenician trading port, before it was taken over by the Romans.

The Romans took the town in 123 BC and expanded it into an important city. They built a canal link to the Mediterranean Sea in 104 BC. Arles had to compete with Massalia (Marseille) further along the coast.

Arles&#x27; leaders sided with Julius Caesar against Pompey, providing military support. Massalia backed Pompey; when Caesar emerged victorious, Massalia was stripped of its possessions, which were transferred to Arelate as a reward. The town was formally established as a colony for veterans of the Roman legion Legio VI &quot;Ferrata&quot;, which had its base there. Its full title as a colony was &quot;Colonia Iulia Paterna Arelatensium Sextanorum&quot;, &quot;the ancestral Julian colony of Arles of the soldiers of the Sixth.&quot;

Arelate was a city of considerable importance in the province of Gallia Narbonensis. It covered an area of some and possessed a number of monuments, including an amphitheatre, triumphal arch, Roman circus, theatre, and a full circuit of walls. Ancient Arles was closer to the sea than it is now and served as a major port. The river has carried centuries of silt that has filled in the former harbor. The city had (and still has) the southernmost bridge on the Rhône.

The recently discovered republican House of the Harpist is an exceptional example of ancient architecture and interior decoration. Dating from 70-50 BC, it has yielded elaborate frescoes.

The Roman bridge was unique in that it was not fixed but consisted of a pontoon-style bridge of boats, with towers and drawbridges at each end. The boats were secured in place by anchors and were tethered to twin towers built just upstream of the bridge. This unusual design was a way of coping with the river&#x27;s frequent violent floods, which would have made short work of a conventional bridge. Nothing remains of the Roman bridge, which has been replaced by a more modern bridge near the same spot.

The city reached a peak of influence during the 4th and 5th centuries, when Roman Emperors frequently used it as their headquarters during military campaigns in Europe. In 395, it became the seat of the Praetorian Prefecture of the Gauls, governing the western part of the Western Empire: Gaul proper plus Hispania (Spain) and Armorica (Brittany). At that time, the city was home to an estimated 75,000–100,000 people.

It became a favorite city of Emperor Constantine I, who built baths there, substantial remains of which are still standing. His son, Constantine II, was born in Arles. Usurper Constantine III declared himself emperor in the West (407–411) and made Arles his capital in 408.

Arles became renowned as a cultural and religious centre during the late Roman Empire. It was the birthplace of Favorinus, known as the sceptical philosopher. It was also a key location for Roman Christianity and an important base for the Christianization of Gaul. The city&#x27;s bishopric was held by a series of outstanding clerics, beginning with Saint Trophimus around 225 and continuing with Saint Honoratus, then Saint Hilarius in the first half of the 5th century. The political tension between the Catholic bishops of Arles and the Visigothic kings is epitomized in the career of the Frankish St. Caesarius, bishop of Arles 503–542. Suspected by the Arian Visigoth Alaric II of conspiring with the Burgundians to turn over the Arelate to Burgundy, he was exiled for a year to Bordeaux in Aquitaine. Political tensions were evident again in 512, when Arles held out against Theodoric the Great. Caesarius was imprisoned and sent to Ravenna to explain his actions before the Ostrogothic king.

The friction between the Arian Christianity of the Visigoths and the Catholicism of the bishops sent out from Rome established deep roots for religious heterodoxy, even heresy, in Occitan culture. At Treves in 385, Priscillian achieved the distinction of becoming the first Christian executed for heresy (Manichaean in his case, see also Cathars, Camisards). Despite this tension and the city&#x27;s decline in the face of barbarian invasions, Arles remained a great religious centre. It hosted church councils (see Council of Arles), the rival of Vienne, for hundreds of years.

===Roman aqueduct and mill===

The Barbegal aqueduct and mill is a Roman watermill complex located on the territory of the commune of Fontvieille, a few kilometres from Arles. The complex has been referred to as &quot;the greatest known concentration of mechanical power in the ancient world&quot;. The remains of the mill streams and buildings which housed the overshot water wheels are still visible at the site, and it is by far the best-preserved of ancient mills. There are two aqueducts which join just north of the mill complex, and a sluice which enabled the operators to control the water supply to the complex. The mill consisted of 16 water wheels in two separate rows built into a steep hillside. There are substantial masonry remains of the water channels and foundations of the individual mills, together with a staircase rising up the hill upon which the mills are built. The mills apparently operated from the end of the 1st century until about the end of the 3rd century. The capacity of the mills has been estimated at 4.5 tons of flour per day, sufficient to supply enough bread for 12,000 of the 30,000–40,000 inhabitants of Arelate at that time. A similar mill complex existed also on the Janiculum in Rome. Examination of the mill leat still just visible on one side of the hill shows a substantial accretion of lime in the channel, tending to confirm its long working life.

It is thought that the wheels were overshot water wheels with the outflow from the top driving the next one down and so on, to the base of the hill. Vertical water mills were well known to the Romans, being described by Vitruvius in his &quot;De Architectura&quot; of 25 BC, and mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History of 77 AD. There are also later references to floating water mills from Byzantium and to sawmills on the river Moselle by the poet Ausonius. The use of multiple stacked sequences of reverse overshot water wheels was widespread in Roman mines.

===Middle Ages===

In 735, after raiding the Lower Rhône, Andalusian Saracens led by Yusuf ibn &#x27;Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri moved into the stronghold summoned by Count Maurontus, who feared Charles Martel&#x27;s expansionist ambitions, though this may have been an excuse to further Muslim expansion beyond Iberia. The next year, Charles campaigned south to Septimania and Provence, attacking and capturing Arles from the Muslim Arabs after destroying Avignon. In 739. Charles definitely drove Maurontus to exile, and brought Provence to heel. Louis the Pious, in 829, placed Arles under royal protection and assigned it with special privileges. In 855, it was made the capital of a Frankish Kingdom of Burgundy, which included Burgundy and part of Provence, but was frequently terrorised by Saracen and Viking raiders. In 888, Rudolph, Count of Auxerre (now in north-western Burgundy), founded the kingdom of Transjuran Burgundy (literally, beyond the Jura mountains), which included western Switzerland as far as the river Reuss, Valais, Geneva, Chablais and Bugey.

In 933, Hugh of Arles (&quot;Hugues de Provence&quot;) gave his kingdom up to Rudolph II, who merged the two kingdoms into a new Kingdom of Burgundy-Arles. In 1032, King Rudolph III died, and the kingdom was inherited by Emperor Conrad II the Salic. Though his successors counted themselves kings of Arles, few went to be crowned in the cathedral. Most of the kingdom&#x27;s territory was progressively incorporated into France. During these troubled times, the amphitheatre was converted into a fortress, with watchtowers built at each of the four quadrants and a minuscule walled town being constructed within. The population was by now only a fraction of what it had been in Roman times, with much of old Arles lying in ruins.

The town regained political and economic prominence in the 12th century, with the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa traveling there in 1178 for his coronation. In the 12th century, it became a free city governed by an elected &quot;podestat&quot; (chief magistrate; literally &quot;power&quot;), who appointed the consuls and other magistrates. It retained this status until the French Revolution of 1789.

Arles joined the countship of Provence in 1239, but, once more, its prominence was eclipsed by Marseilles. In 1378, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV made the Dauphin of France (later King Charles VI of France) vicar of the moribund Kingdom of Burgundy-Arles for his lifetime. The kingdom ceased to have any political existence soon afterwards.

===Modern era===

Arles remained economically important for many years as a major port on the Rhône. The Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1676.

In the 19th century, the establishment of railways diminished river trade, leading to the city declining in prominence. This made it a destination for the painter Vincent van Gogh, who arrived there on 21 February 1888. He was fascinated by the Provençal landscapes, producing over 300 paintings and drawings during his time in Arles. Many of his most famous paintings were completed there, including &quot;The Night Cafe&quot;, the &quot;Yellow Room&quot;, &quot;Starry Night Over the Rhone&quot;, and &quot;L&#x27;Arlésienne&quot;. Paul Gauguin visited van Gogh in Arles. However, van Gogh&#x27;s mental health deteriorated and he became alarmingly eccentric, culminating in the ear-severing incident in December 1888 which resulted in two stays in the Old Hospital of Arles. The concerned Arlesians circulated a petition the following February demanding that van Gogh be confined. In May 1889, he voluntarily left Arles for the Saint-Paul asylum at nearby Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.

===Jewish history===

Arles had an important and prominent Jewish community between the Roman era and the end of the 15th century. A local legend describes the first Jews in Arles as exiles from Judaea after Jerusalem fell to the Romans. Nevertheless, the first documented evidence of Jews in Arles is not before the fifth century, when a distinguished community already existed in the town. Arles was an important Jewish crossroads, as a port city and close to Spain and the rest of Europe alike. It served a major role in the work of the Hachmei Provence group of famous Jewish scholars, translators and philosophers, who were most important to Judaism throughout the Middle Ages. In the eighth century, jurisdiction over the Jews of Arles was passed to the local Archbishop, making the Jewish taxes to the clergy somewhat of a shield for the community from mob attacks, most frequent during the Crusades. The community lived relatively peacefully until the last decade of the 15th century, when they were expelled out of the city never to return. Several Jews did live in the city in the centuries after, though no community was found ever after. Nowadays, Jewish archaeological findings and texts from Arles can be found in the local museum.

==Climate==
Arles has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with a mean annual temperature of 14.6 °C (1948–1999). The summers are warm and moderately dry, with seasonal averages between 22 °C and 24 °C, and cool to mild winters with a mean temperature of about 7 °C. The city is constantly, but especially in the winter months, subject to the influence of the mistral, a cold wind which can cause sudden and severe frosts. Rainfall (636 mm per year) is fairly evenly distributed from September to May, with the summer drought being less marked than in other Mediterranean areas.

==Population==
The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Arles proper, in its geography at the given years. The commune of Arles ceded part of its territory to the new commune of Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rhône in 1904, and to the new commune of Saint-Martin-de-Crau in 1925.

==Main sights==
Arles has important Roman remnants, most of which have been listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1981 within the Arles, Roman and Romanesque Monuments group. They include:
* The Roman Theatre of Arles
* The arena or amphitheatre
* The Alyscamps (Roman necropolis)
* The Thermae of Constantine
* The cryptoporticus
* Arles Obelisk
* Barbegal aqueduct and mill
* The Church of St. Trophime (Saint Trophimus), formerly a cathedral, is a major work of Romanesque architecture, and the representation of the Last Judgment on its portal is considered one of the finest examples of Romanesque sculpture, as are the columns in the adjacent cloister.

The town also has a museum of ancient history, the Musée de l&#x27;Arles et de la Provence antiques, with one of the best collections of Roman sarcophagi to be found anywhere outside Rome itself. Other museums include the Musée Réattu and the Museon Arlaten.

The courtyard of the Old Arles hospital, now named &quot;Espace Van Gogh,&quot; is a center for Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s works, several of which are masterpieces. The garden, framed on all four sides by buildings of the complex, is approached through arcades on the first floor. A circulation gallery is located on the first and second floors.

The LUMA Tower is a 56-meter tall construction, the center of the LUMA Arles arts center.

==Archaeology==

In September–October 2007, divers led by Lucas Longas from the French Department of Subaquatic Archaeological Research, headed by Michel L&#x27;Hour, discovered a life-sized marble bust of an apparently important Roman person in the Rhône near Arles, together with smaller statues of Marsyas in Hellenistic style and of the god Neptune from the third century AD. The larger bust was tentatively dated to 46 BC. Since the bust displayed several characteristics of an ageing person with wrinkles, deep naso-labial creases and hollows in his face, and since the archaeologists believed that Julius Caesar had founded the colony &quot;Colonia Iulia Paterna Arelate Sextanorum&quot; in 46 BC, the scientists came to the preliminary conclusion that the bust depicted a life-portrait of the Roman dictator: France&#x27;s Minister of Culture Christine Albanel reported on 13 May 2008 that the bust would be the oldest representation of Caesar known today. The story was picked up by all larger media outlets. The realism of the portrait was said to place it in the tradition of late Republican portrait and genre sculptures. The archaeologists further claimed that a bust of Julius Caesar might have been thrown away or discreetly disposed of, because Caesar&#x27;s portraits could have been viewed as politically dangerous possessions after the dictator&#x27;s assassination.

Historians and archaeologists not affiliated with the French administration, among them Paul Zanker, an archaeologist and expert on Caesar and Augustus, were quick to question whether the bust is a portrait of Caesar. Many noted the lack of resemblances to Caesar&#x27;s likenesses issued on coins during the last years of the dictator&#x27;s life, and to the Tusculum bust of Caesar, which depicts Julius Caesar in his lifetime, either as a so-called &quot;zeitgesicht&quot; or as a direct portrait. After a further stylistic assessment, Zanker dated the Arles-bust to the Augustan period. Elkins argued for the third century AD as the &quot;terminus post quem&quot; for the deposition of the statues, refuting the claim that the bust was thrown away due to feared repercussions from Caesar&#x27;s assassination in 44 BC. The main argument by the French archaeologists that Caesar had founded the colony in 46 BC proved to be incorrect, as the colony was founded by Caesar&#x27;s former quaestor Tiberius Claudius Nero on the dictator&#x27;s orders in his absence. Mary Beard has accused the persons involved in the find of having willfully invented their claims for publicity reasons. The French ministry of culture has not yet responded to the criticism and negative reviews.

==Sport==
AC Arles-Avignon was a professional French football team. They previously played in Championnat de France Amateur, the fourth division in French football, but were dissolved in 2016. They play at the Parc des Sports, which has a capacity of just over 17,000.

==Culture==

A well known photography festival, Rencontres d&#x27;Arles, takes place in Arles every year, and the French national school of photography is located there.

The major French publishing house Actes Sud is also situated in Arles.

In the past years, several cultural organizations have set up a presence in Arles, such as the LUMA Foundation, the &quot;Fondation Vincent van Gogh Arles&quot;, the Manuel Rivera-Ortiz Foundation or the Lee Ufan Foundation. On top of that, there are countless galleries scattered throughout the city.

Bullfights are conducted in the amphitheatre, including Provençal-style bullfights (&quot;courses camarguaises&quot;) in which the bull is not killed, but rather a team of athletic men attempt to remove a tassle from the bull&#x27;s horn without getting injured. Every Easter and on the first weekend of September, during the feria, Arles also holds Spanish-style &quot;corridas&quot; (in which the bulls are killed) with an &quot;encierro&quot; (bull-running in the streets) preceding each fight.

Parts of the films &quot;Ronin&quot;, &quot;At Eternity&#x27;s Gate&quot; and &quot;Taxi 3&quot; were filmed in Arles.

===European Capital of Culture===
Arles played a major role in Marseille-Provence 2013, the year-long series of cultural events held in the region after it was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2013. The city hosted a segment of the opening ceremony with a pyrotechnical performance by Groupe F on the banks of the Rhône. It also unveiled the new wing of the Musée Départemental Arles Antique as part of Marseille-Provence 2013.

==Economy==
Arles&#x27;s open-air street market is a major market in the region. It takes place on Saturday and Wednesday mornings.

==Transport==

The Gare d&#x27;Arles railway station offers connections to Avignon, Nîmes, Marseille, Paris, Bordeaux and several regional destinations.

Arles does not have its own commercial airport, but is served by a number of airports in the region, most notably the major international airport of Marseille Provence approximately an hour&#x27;s drive away.

The A54 autoroute toll motorway, which locally connects Salon-de-Provence with Nîmes and in a wider sense forms part of European route E80, passes by Arles.

The Rhône, which for navigation purposes is classified as a Class V waterway as far upstream as Lyon, is a historically important transport route connecting the inland Rhône-Alpes region with the Mediterranean Sea. The port of Arles and its adjacent rail and road connections provides a major transshipment node, which in 2013 handled approximately 450,000 tonnes of goods.

<text>Aix-en-Provence, or simply Aix, is a city and commune in southern France, about north of Marseille. A former capital of Provence, it is the subprefecture of the arrondissement of Aix-en-Provence, in the department of Bouches-du-Rhône, in the region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur. The population of Aix-en-Provence is approximately 145,000. Its inhabitants are called &quot;Aixois&quot; or, less commonly, &quot;Aquisextains&quot;.

==History==

Aix (&quot;Aquae Sextiae&quot;) was founded in 123 BC by the Roman consul Sextius Calvinus, who gave his name to its springs, following the destruction of the nearby Gallic oppidum at Entremont. In 102 BC its vicinity was the scene of the Battle of Aquae Sextiae, where the Romans under Gaius Marius defeated the Ambrones and Teutones, with mass suicides among the captured women, which passed into Roman legends of Germanic heroism.

In the 4th century AD it became the metropolis of Narbonensis Secunda. It was occupied by the Visigoths in 477. In the succeeding century, the town was repeatedly plundered by the Franks and Lombards, and was occupied by the Saracens in 731 and by Charles Martel in 737. Aix, which during the Middle Ages was the capital of Provence, did not reach its zenith until after the 12th century, when, under the houses of Barcelona/Aragon and Anjou, it became an artistic centre and seat of learning.

Aix passed to the crown of France with the rest of Provence in 1487, and in 1501 Louis XII established there the parliament of Provence, which existed until 1789. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the town was the seat of the Intendance of Provence. Current archeological excavations in the Ville des Tours, a medieval suburb of Aix, have unearthed the remains of a Roman amphitheatre. A deposit of fossil bones from the Upper Continental Miocene gave rise to a Christian dragon legend.

==Geography and climate==
Aix-en-Provence is situated in the south of France, in a plain overlooking the Arc river, about from the right bank of the river. The city slopes gently from north to south and the Montagne Sainte-Victoire can easily be seen to the east. Aix&#x27;s position in the south of France gives it a warm climate, though more extreme than Marseille due to the inland location. It has an average January temperature of and a July average of . It has an average of 300 days of sunshine and only 58 days of rain. While it is partially protected from the Mistral, Aix still occasionally experiences the cooler and gusty conditions it brings.

Like most of the south of France, Aix-en-Provence has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa).

==Sights==


The Cours Mirabeau is a wide thoroughfare, planted with double rows of plane trees, bordered by fine houses and decorated by fountains. It follows the line of the old city wall, and divides the town into two sections. The new town extends to the south and west; the old town, with its narrow, irregular streets, and its old mansions dating from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, lies to the north. Situated on this avenue, which is lined on one side with banks and on the other with cafés, is the Deux Garçons, the most famous brasserie in Aix. Built in 1792, it was frequented by the likes of Paul Cézanne, Émile Zola and Ernest Hemingway. On 3 November 2019, Les Deux Garçons was devastated by a fire that engulfed the entire building, leaving the much loved establishment just a shell.

The Cathedral of the Holy Saviour (Aix Cathedral) is situated to the north in the medieval part of Aix. Built on the site of a former Roman forum and an adjacent basilica, it contains a mixture of all styles from the 5th to the 17th century, including a richly decorated portal in the Gothic style with doors elaborately carved in walnut. The interior contains 16th-century tapestries, a 15th-century triptych depicting King René and his wife on the side panels, as well as a Merovingian baptistery, its Renaissance dome supported by original Roman columns. The archbishop&#x27;s palace (Palais de l&#x27;Archêveché) and a Romanesque cloister adjoin the cathedral on its south side. The Archbishopric of Aix is now shared with Arles.

Among its other public institutions, Aix also has the second most important Appeal Court (Palais de Justice) outside of Paris, located near the site of the former Palace of the Counts (Palais des Comtes) of Provence.

The Hôtel de Ville (town hall), a building in the classical style of the middle of the 17th century, looks onto a picturesque square (Place de l&#x27;Hôtel de Ville). It contains some fine woodwork and tapestries. At its side rises a handsome clock-tower, erected in 1510. Also on the Place de l&#x27;Hôtel de Ville is the former Corn Exchange (1759–1761) (Halle de Grains). This ornately decorated 18th-century building was designed by the Vallon brothers. Nearby are the remarkable thermal springs, containing lime and carbonic acid, that first drew the Romans to Aix and gave it the name &quot;Aquae Sextiae&quot;. A spa was built in 1705 near the remains of the ancient Roman baths of Sextius.

South of the Cours Mirabeau is the Quartier Mazarin. This residential district was constructed for the gentry of Aix by Archbishop Michele Mazzarino brother of Cardinal Jules Mazarin in the last half of the 17th century and contains several notable &quot;hôtels particuliers&quot;. The 13th-century church of Saint-Jean-de-Malte contains valuable pictures and a recently restored organ. Next to it is the Musée Granet, devoted to European painting and sculpture.

Aix is often referred to as the city of a thousand fountains. Among the most notable are the 17th-century Fontaine des Quatre Dauphins (Fountain of the Four Dolphins) in the Quartier Mazarin, designed by Jean-Claude Rambot, and three of the fountains down the central Cours Mirabeau: at the top, a 19th-century fountain depicts the &quot;good king&quot; René holding the Muscat grapes that he introduced to Provence in the 15th century; halfway down is a natural hot water fountain (34 °C), covered in moss, dating back to the Romans; and at the bottom, at la Rotonde, the hub of modern Aix, stands a monumental fountain from 1860 beneath three giant statues representing art, justice and agriculture. In the older part of Aix, there are also fountains of note in the Place d&#x27;Albertas and the Place des Trois-Ormeaux.

Aix is the birthplace of Post-Impressionist painter Paul Cézanne. A walking trail links sites including his childhood home, Jas de Bouffan, and his former studio, Atelier Cézanne. The white limestone mountain Sainte-Victoire overlooks the city and was a frequent subject of Cézanne&#x27;s works.

==Education==

Aix has long been a university town: Louis II of Anjou granted a royal charter for a university in 1409. Today Aix-en-Provence remains an important educational centre, with many teaching and research institutes:

* Arts et Métiers ParisTech, an engineering graduate school that settled a campus in the city in 1843. This teaching and research center (CER) let the students attend courses focused on industrial and mechanical engineering.
* Aix-Marseille University, consisting of the faculty and former campuses of:
**University of Provence Aix-Marseille I, specialising in the humanities.
**Université de la Méditerranée Aix-Marseille II, specialising in economics.
**Université Paul Cézanne Aix-Marseille III, specialising principally in law, economics, political science and administration.
* Institut d&#x27;études politiques d&#x27;Aix-en-Provence (IEP) is part of France&#x27;s network of political studies universities, often referred to as &quot;Sciences Po&quot;.
* Institut de l&#x27;Aménagement Régional, an institute in the Université Paul Cézanne for town and country planning.
* The American College of the Mediterranean (ACM), an American-style degree-granting institution with programs in art, art history, business, communication, French language and culture, international relations, psychology and many others. ACM also includes a study abroad institute for undergraduates, IAU College.

Aix also has several training collèges, lycées, and a college of art and design. It has also become a centre for many international study programmes. Several lycées offer CPGE.

==Culture==
===Music===
Aix holds two significant musical events each year. These are:

====Festival d&#x27;Aix-en-Provence====
An important opera festival, the &quot;Festival international d&#x27;Art Lyrique&quot;, founded in 1948, now ranks with those in Bayreuth, Salzburg and Glyndebourne. The director until 2018 was Bernard Foccroulle, organist and director of la Monnaie in Brussels. The festival takes place in late June and July each year. The main venues in Aix itself are the outdoor Théâtre de l&#x27;Archévêché in the former garden of the archbishop&#x27;s palace, the recently restored 18th-century Théâtre du Jeu de Paume, and the newly built Grand Théâtre de Provence; operas are also staged in the outdoor Théâtre du Grand Saint-Jean outside Aix. Linked to the festival is the Académie européenne de musique, a summer school for young musicians with master classes by celebrated artists. Over the four-year period from 2006 until 2009, Sir Simon Rattle&#x27;s version of Wagner&#x27;s Ring Cycle with the Berlin Philharmonic was performed at the Aix festival. The current director of the festival is Pierre Audi.

====Musique dans la Rue====
This takes place each year in June to coincide with the national &#x27;Fête de la Musique.&#x27; There is a week of classical, jazz, and popular concerts held in different street venues and courtyards in the city. Some of these events are held in the Conservatoire Darius Milhaud, named in honour of the French composer, a native of Aix.

===Dance===
The dance company &quot;Ballet Preljocaj&quot; of the French dancer and choreographer Angelin Preljocaj has been located in Aix since 1996. In 2007 it took up residence in the Pavillon Noir, a centre for dance performance, designed in 1999 by the architect Rudy Ricciotti. The centre is one of nineteen of its kind in France, designated &quot;Centre chorégraphique national&quot;.

===European Capital of Culture===

Aix-en-Provence was part of Marseille-Provence 2013, the year-long cultural festival when the region served as the European Capital of Culture. Aix hosted several major cultural events including one half of the Grand Atelier du Midi gala exhibition and an episode of the Révélations pyrotechnical performance. The city also unveiled major new cultural infrastructure to coincide with Marseille-Provence 2013, including the Darius Milhaud Conservatory designed by Kengo Kuma.

===Museums and libraries===

Aix has several museums and galleries:
*Le Musée du Vieil Aix (Museum of Old Aix), housed in two period &quot;hôtels particuliers&quot; and devoted to the history and provencal heritage of Aix.
*Le Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle (Natural History Museum).
*Le Musée de Tapisseries (Tapestry Museum), housed in the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace and with a collection of tapestries and furniture from the 17th and 18th centuries.
*Le Musée Paul Arbaud (Faïence/Pottery).
*Le Musée Granet, a museum devoted to painting, sculpture and the archeology of Aix. It recently underwent significant restoration and reorganization, prior to the international exhibition in 2006 marking the centenary of Cézanne&#x27;s death. Due to lack of space, the large archeological collection, including many recent discoveries, will be displayed in a new museum, still in the planning stages. The museum contains major paintings by Jean-Dominique Ingres (among which the monumental &quot;Jupiter and Thetis&quot;), an authentic self-portrait by Rembrandt, and works by Anthony van Dyck, Paul Cézanne, Alberto Giacometti and Nicolas de Staël. In June 2011, the first part of the collection of the &quot;Fondation Jean et Suzanne Planque&quot; opened at the Musée Granet, containing over 180 artworks. This legacy of the Swiss painter, dealer and art collector Jean Planque, a personal friend of Pablo Picasso, has been donated to the city for an initial period of 15 years. The collection contains over 300 works of art, including paintings and drawings by Degas, Renoir. Gauguin, Monet, Cézanne, Van Gogh, Picasso, Pierre Bonnard, Paul Klee, Fernand Léger, Giacometti and Dubuffet. The full collection will be housed in a specially constructed annex in the &quot;Chapelle des Pénitents Blancs&quot;, situated nearby: the expected opening is in 2013.
*Le Pavillon de Vendôme, a 17th-century mansion housing permanent and touring art exhibitions.
*The Fondation Vasarely, a gallery dedicated to the works of the Hungarian-born French abstract painter Victor Vasarely.
*Le Camp des Milles
*L&#x27;atelier Cézanne, the former studio of Paul Cézanne, now a museum, located in the northern outskirts of Aix. It has been preserved as it was at the time of the painter&#x27;s death and contains many of his personal items and props used in his paintings.
*Jas de Bouffan, the house and grounds of Cézanne&#x27;s father, now partially open to the public.

Prior to 1989 Aix had several libraries, for example in the Parc Jourdan and the Town Hall. In 1989, many of these were moved to the Méjanes, an old match factory.

In 1993, the &quot;Cité du Livre&quot; was opened around the library. This has media spaces for dance, cinema and music, and a training facility for librarians. Adjacent to the Cité du Livre are the Grand Théâtre de Provence and the Pavillon Noir (see above).

===Montagne Sainte-Victoire===
To the east of Aix rises Montagne Sainte-Victoire (), one of the landmarks of the Pays d&#x27;Aix. It is accessible from the centre of Aix by road or on foot, taking the wooded footpath of Escrachou Pevou to the plateau of Bibemus. It dramatically overshadows the small dam built by Émile Zola&#x27;s father and was a favourite subject and haunt of Paul Cézanne throughout his lifetime. In the village of Le Tholonet on the precipitous southern side of Mont Sainte-Victoire, there is a windmill that he used, and beyond that a mountain hut, the &quot;refuge Cézanne&quot;, where he liked to paint.

To the north, the mountain slopes gently down through woodland to the village of Vauvenargues. The Château of Vauvenargues overlooking the village was formerly occupied by the counts of Provence (including René of Anjou) and the Archbishops of Aix before it became the family home of the marquis de Vauvenargues. It was acquired by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso in 1958, who was resident there from 1959 until 1962, when he moved to Mougins. He and his wife Jacqueline are buried in its grounds,
 which are not usually open to the public. From 2009 onwards, the château, which now belongs to Jacqueline&#x27;s daughter Catherine Hutin, has been open to the public from June to September.

Mont Sainte-Victoire has a complex network of paths, leading to the priory and &quot;Croix de Provence&quot; at the summit, to the large man-made reservoir of Bimont and to the Roman viaduct above le Tholonet.

* Tourism.
* Entertainment, particularly opera and dance.
* The semiconductor and electronics industry in Rousset, to the south of Mont Ste.-Victoire, specializing in microchip technology for credit cards.

Each year in early September, there is a mass in French and Provençal in the medieval church of St Jean de Malte to bless the calissons – &quot; la bénédiction des calissons&quot;. This ceremony has been held since the 17th century to mark the deliverance of Aix from the plague. It is currently accompanied by a colourful provencal pageant, involving most of the local calisson manufacturers and their wares. About calissons, Provençal novelist Marcel Pagnol wrote that, to make true calissons &quot;&quot;&#x27;You need one-third almonds, one-third fruit confits, one-third sugar, and a quarter savoir faire&quot;.&quot;
* Viticulture: the local Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée is Coteaux d&#x27;Aix-en-Provence AOC, with many vineyards between Aix and the River Durance to the north. The reputed appellation of Palette AOC is represented by the estates of Château Simone in Meyreuil and Château Crémade in Le Tholonet, to the east of Aix.

==Transport==

A set of ancient roads radiate out from Aix to the surrounding countryside, the Pays d&#x27;Aix. There are also a large number of modern autoroutes connecting Aix to nearby towns. There are autoroutes northwards to Avignon and to the Luberon; southwards to Marseille; and eastwards to Aubagne and the Mediterranean coast of Provence; and to Nice and other towns on the French Riviera. Aix and Marseille are equidistant from the Marseille Provence Airport (MRS) at Marignane on the Étang de Berre which features domestic and international scheduled passenger service. There is another airport at Les Milles, which is mostly used by general aviation. There is a frequent bus shuttle service from the main bus station in Aix which also serves the nearby TGV station at l&#x27;Arbois, in the middle of the countryside about from Aix.

At Aix, the line from Paris branches to Marseille and Nice; it takes about 3 hours to get from Paris to Aix by TGV. Aix also has a railway station near the centre, Gare d&#x27;Aix-en-Provence, with connections to Marseille, Pertuis and Briançon in the French Alps. A frequent and rapid shuttle bus service for commuters operates between the bus station in Aix and Marseille. There are many other long distance and local buses from the bus station. The city also offers a &quot;city pass&quot; available in 24, 48, and 72-hour packages for visiting tourists. The &quot;pass tourisitque&quot; is offered at the Aix-en-Provence Tourist Office, the Atelier de Cézanne, and the official Aix tourism website.

The central old town of Aix is for the most part pedestrianised. There are large underground and overground parking structures placed at regular intervals on the &quot;boulevard exterieur&quot;, the predominantly one-way ring road that encircles the old town. Access to the old town is by a series of often narrow one-way streets that can be confusing to navigate for the uninitiated.

As well as overland routes, two &quot;rivers&quot; flow through Aix, the Arc and the Torse, but neither of which can remotely be described as navigable.

==Miscellaneous==

The local Aix dialect, rarely used and spoken by a rapidly decreasing number of people, is part of the provencal dialect of the Occitan language.

<text>Tartarin of Tarascon () is an 1872 novel written by the French author Alphonse Daudet.

==Synopsis==
The Provençal town of Tarascon is so enthusiastic about hunting that no game lives anywhere near it, and its inhabitants resort to telling hunting stories and throwing their own caps in the air to shoot at them. Tartarin, a plump middle-aged man, is the chief &quot;cap-hunter&quot;, but following his enthusiastic reaction to seeing an Atlas lion in a travelling menagerie, the over-imaginative town understands him to be planning a hunting expedition to Algeria.

So as not to lose face, Tartarin is forced to go, after gathering an absurd mass of equipment and weapons. On the boat from Marseille to Algiers, he hooks up with a conman posing as a Montenegrin prince who takes advantage of him in multiple ways. Tartarin&#x27;s gullibility causes him a number of misadventures until he returns home penniless but covered in glory after shooting a tame, blind lion.

A sequel &quot;Tartarin sur les Alpes&quot; appeared in 1885, followed by &quot;Port-Tarascon&quot; in 1890.

==Legacy==
Since 1985, a small museum in the town of Tarascon-sur-Rhône is dedicated to the fictional character Tartarin. A festival is held in Tarascon every year on the last Sunday of June to remember Tartarin and the unrelated Tarasque.

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==

&quot;Tartarin de Tarascon&quot; has been adapted into cinematic form three times, in 1908, 1934, and 1962, with each work being titled after its point of reference. The earliest cinematic version was a short, filmed in 1908 by the pioneering magician-cum-director, Georges Méliès.

The second effort was the 1934 film, which was directed by Frenchman Raymond Bernard and starred Raimu in the role of Tartarin, as well as Sinoël, Fernand Charpin, and Charles Camus in other principal roles.

The 1962 film was directed by Francis Blanche and Raoul André, and starred Francis Blanche, Alfred Adam, Jacqueline Maillan, Bourvil, Robert Porte.

Belgian composer Arthur Meulemans (1884 -1966) created the &quot;Ouverture voor Tartarin de Tarascon&quot; for orchestra in 1955.

<text>Alphonse Daudet (; 13 May 184016 December 1897) was a French novelist. He was the husband of Julia Daudet and father of Edmée, Léon and Lucien Daudet.

==Early life==
Daudet was born in Nîmes, France. His family, on both sides, belonged to the &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;. His father, Vincent Daudet, was a silk manufacturer—a man dogged through life by misfortune and failure. Alphonse, amid much truancy, had a depressing boyhood. In 1856 he left Lyon, where his schooldays had been mainly spent, and began his career as a schoolteacher at Alès, Gard, in the south of France. The position proved to be intolerable and Daudet said later that for months after leaving Alès he would wake with horror, thinking he was still among his unruly pupils. These experiences and others were reflected in his novel &quot;Le Petit Chose&quot;.

On 1 November 1857, he abandoned teaching and took refuge with his brother Ernest Daudet, three years his senior, who was trying, &quot;and thereto soberly&quot;, to make a living as a journalist in Paris. Alphonse took to writing, and his poems were collected into a small volume, &quot;Les Amoureuses&quot; (1858), which met with a fair reception. He obtained employment on &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, then under Cartier de Villemessant&#x27;s energetic editorship, wrote two or three plays, and began to be recognized in literary communities as possessing distinction and promise. Morny, Napoleon III&#x27;s all-powerful minister, appointed him to be one of his secretaries—a post which he held till Morny&#x27;s death in 1865.

==Literary career==
In 1866, Daudet&#x27;s &quot;Lettres de mon moulin&quot; (&quot;Letters from My Windmill&quot;), written in Clamart, near Paris, and alluding to a windmill in Fontvieille, Provence, won the attention of many readers. The first of his longer books, &quot;Le Petit Chose&quot; (1868), did not, however, produce popular sensation. It is, in the main, the story of his own earlier years told with much grace and pathos. The year 1872 brought the famous &quot;Aventures prodigieuses de Tartarin de Tarascon&quot;, and the three-act play &quot;L&#x27;Arlésienne&quot;. But &quot;Fromont jeune et Risler aîné&quot; (1874) at once took the world by storm. It struck a note, not new certainly in English literature, but comparatively new in French. His creativeness resulted in characters that were real and also typical.

&quot;Jack&quot;, a novel about an illegitimate child, a martyr to his mother&#x27;s selfishness, which followed in 1876, served only to deepen the same impression. Henceforward his career was that of a successful man of letters, mainly spent writing novels: &quot;Le Nabab&quot; (1877), &quot;Les Rois en exil&quot; (1879), &quot;Numa Roumestan&quot; (1881), &quot;Sapho&quot; (1884), &quot;L&#x27;Immortel&quot; (1888), and writing for the stage: reminiscing in &quot;Trente ans de Paris&quot; (1887) and &quot;Souvenirs d&#x27;un homme de lettres&quot; (1888). These, with the three Tartarins–&quot;Tartarin de Tarascon&quot;, &quot;Tartarin sur les Alpes&quot;, &quot;Port-Tarascon&quot;–and the short stories, written for the most part before he had acquired fame and fortune, constitute his life work.

&quot;L&#x27;Immortel&quot; is a bitter attack on the Académie française, to which august body Daudet never belonged. Daudet also wrote for children, including &quot;La Belle Nivernaise&quot;, the story of an old boat and her crew. In 1867 Daudet married Julia Allard, author of &quot;Impressions de nature et d&#x27;art&quot; (1879), &quot;L&#x27;Enfance d&#x27;une Parisienne&quot; (1883), and some literary studies written under the pseudonym &quot;Karl Steen&quot;.

Daudet was far from faithful, and was one of a generation of French literary syphilitics. Having lost his virginity at the age of twelve, he then slept with his friends&#x27; mistresses throughout his marriage. Daudet would undergo several painful treatments and operations for his subsequently paralysing disease. His journal entries relating to the pain he experienced from tabes dorsalis are collected in the volume &quot;In the Land of Pain&quot;, translated by Julian Barnes. He died in Paris on 16 December 1897, and was interred at that city&#x27;s Père Lachaise Cemetery.

* The story of Daudet&#x27;s earlier years is told in his brother Ernest Daudet&#x27;s &quot;Mon frère et moi&quot;. There is a good deal of autobiographical detail in Daudet&#x27;s &quot;Trente ans de Paris&quot; and &quot;Souvenirs d&#x27;un homme de lettres&quot;, and also scattered in his other books. The references to him in the &quot;Journal des Goncourt&quot; are numerous.

==Political and social views, controversy and legacy==

Daudet was a monarchist and a fervent opponent of the French Republic. He was an antisemite, though less famously so than his son Léon. The main character of &quot;Le Nabab&quot; was inspired by a Jewish politician who was elected as a deputy for Nîmes. Daudet campaigned against him and lost. Daudet counted many antisemitic literary figures amongst his friends, including Edouard Drumont, who founded the Antisemitic League of France and founded and edited the anti-Semitic newspaper &quot;La Libre Parole&quot;. It has been argued that Daudet deliberately exaggerated his links to Provence to further his literary career and social success (following Frederic Mistral&#x27;s success), including lying to his future wife about his &quot;Provençal&quot; roots.

Numerous colleges and schools in contemporary France bear his name and his books are widely read and several are in print.

<text>Scorpions are a German hard rock band formed in Hanover in 1965 by guitarist Rudolf Schenker. The longest-running and most successful line-up of the band included Schenker, Klaus Meine (vocals), Matthias Jabs (lead guitar), Francis Buchholz (bass), and Herman Rarebell (drums), and lasted from 1978 to 1992. The band&#x27;s only continuous member has been Schenker, although Meine has been with the band continuously since their first album &quot;Lonesome Crow&quot; (1972). Jabs has been a consistent member since 1978, while bassist Paweł Mąciwoda and drummer Mikkey Dee have been in the band since 2003 and 2016, respectively.

&quot;Lonesome Crow&quot; featured Schenker&#x27;s younger brother Michael on lead guitar, before he departed to join UFO. He was replaced by Uli Jon Roth, who was with the band for their next four studio albums, &quot;Fly to the Rainbow&quot; (1974), &quot;In Trance&quot; (1975), &quot;Virgin Killer&quot; (1976) and &quot;Taken by Force&quot; (1977), and their first live album &quot;Tokyo Tapes&quot; (1978). Following Roth&#x27;s departure, the band recruited Matthias Jabs and began moving towards a more melodic rock style on their sixth studio album &quot;Lovedrive&quot; (1979), which also saw Scorpions reunite with Michael Schenker before he left again to pursue a solo career. Over the next decade, the band achieved influence, approval from music critics, and significant commercial success with the albums &quot;Animal Magnetism&quot; (1980), &quot;Blackout&quot; (1982), &quot;Love at First Sting&quot; (1984), the live album &quot;World Wide Live&quot; (1985), &quot;Savage Amusement&quot; (1988), the compilation album &quot;Best of Rockers &#x27;n&#x27; Ballads&quot; (1989), and &quot;Crazy World&quot; (1990), all of which are certified at least platinum in the United States. The band has released thirteen consecutive studio albums that were in the top 10 in Germany, one of which reached No. 1, as well as three consecutive albums that were in the top 10 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States. Their latest studio album, &quot;Rock Believer&quot;, was released in February 2022.

Scorpions are estimated to have sold over 100 million records around the world, making them one of the best-selling hard rock and heavy metal bands. One of their most recognized hits is &quot;Wind of Change&quot; (from &quot;Crazy World&quot;), a symbolic anthem of the political changes in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the fall of the Berlin Wall, and it remains as one of the best-selling singles in the world with over 14 million copies. Two songs from their ninth studio album &quot;Love at First Sting&quot;, &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot; and &quot;Still Loving You&quot;, are regarded as some of the most influential and popular works, both in heavy metal music and among rock ballads, defined as &quot;rock anthem&quot; and &quot;a true hymn of love&quot;, respectively.

==History==

===Formation and early history (1965–1973)===
Rudolf Schenker, the band&#x27;s rhythm/lead guitarist, launched the band in 1965. Initially the band had Merseybeat influences and Schenker himself handled the vocals. He played in a band with Lothar Heimberg before he founded Scorpions. Karl Heinz Vollmer left the band in 1967 because of his military obligations; military service precluded him from performing in concerts. Things began to come together in 1970 when Schenker&#x27;s younger brother Michael and vocalist Klaus Meine, who had played together in the Led Zeppelin and Taste cover band Copernicus, joined the band. With this line-up they won a music contest in 1972 and recorded two songs for a single that was never released on the CCA label, but the songs, &quot;Action&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Going Mad&quot; were later released on different compilation albums including &quot;Psychedelic Gems 2.&quot;

In 1972 the group recorded and released their debut album &quot;Lonesome Crow&quot;, with Lothar Heimberg on bass and Wolfgang Dziony on drums and re-recorded their CCA songs. During the &quot;Lonesome Crow&quot; tour Scorpions opened for up-and-coming British band UFO. Near the end of the tour, guitarist Michael Schenker accepted an offer to play lead guitar for UFO. Uli Jon Roth, a friend of Michael&#x27;s, was then introduced to the band and he helped them to finish off the tour.

The departure of Michael Schenker led to the breakup of the band. In 1973, Uli Roth, who had helped Scorpions complete the &quot;Lonesome Crow&quot; tour, was offered the role of lead guitarist, but turned the band down, preferring instead to remain in the band Dawn Road. Rudolf Schenker eventually decided he wanted to work with Roth, but did not want to resurrect the last Scorpions line-up. He attended some of Dawn Road&#x27;s rehearsals and ultimately decided to join the band, which consisted of Roth, Francis Buchholz (bass), Achim Kirschning (keyboards) and Jürgen Rosenthal (drums). Uli Roth and Buchholz persuaded Rudolf Schenker to invite Klaus Meine to join on vocals, which he soon did. While there were more members of Dawn Road than Scorpions in the band, they decided to use the Scorpions name because it was well known on the German hard rock scene and an album had been released under that name.

===Rise to fame (1974–1978)===
In 1974, the new line-up released &quot;Fly to the Rainbow&quot;. The album proved to be more successful than &quot;Lonesome Crow&quot; and songs such as &quot;Speedy&#x27;s Coming&quot; and the title track established the band&#x27;s sound. Achim Kirschning decided to leave after the recordings. Soon after, Jürgen Rosenthal had to leave as he was drafted into the army (he later joined German progressive rock band Eloy, recording three albums). Rosenthal was replaced in July 1974 by Jürgen Fechter, and then in 1975 Rudy Lenners from Belgium became the band&#x27;s next drummer.
That year, the band released &quot;In Trance&quot;, which marked the beginning of their long collaboration with German producer Dieter Dierks. The album was a huge step forward for the Scorpions and established their heavy metal formula. It garnered a fan base at home and abroad with cuts such as &quot;In Trance&quot;, &quot;Dark Lady&quot; and &quot;Robot Man&quot;.

Meanwhile, as &quot;The Hunters&quot;, the band recorded &quot;Fuchs geh&#x27; voran&quot; and &quot;Wenn es richtig losgeht&quot;, German language cover versions of &quot;Action&quot; and &quot;Fox on the Run&quot; by the Sweet for EMI&#x27;s Electrola label.

In 1976, the Scorpions released &quot;Virgin Killer&quot;, the album cover of which featured a nude prepubescent girl behind a broken pane of glass. The cover art was designed by Stefan Bohle, who was the product manager for the West German division of RCA Records, their label at the time. The cover brought the band considerable market exposure as well as controversy and was subsequently pulled or replaced in other countries because of its imagery. The album itself garnered widespread praise for its music from select critics and fan base. In 2008, the cover art on the English Wikipedia was briefly blacklisted by the Internet Watch Foundation, before reversing their decision 4 days later.

The following year, Rudy Lenners resigned for personal reasons and was replaced by Herman Rarebell, an experienced musician who had recorded with the bands Missus Beastly and Onyx.

For the follow-up &quot;Taken by Force&quot;, RCA Records made a determined effort to promote the album in stores and on the radio. The album&#x27;s single, &quot;Steamrock Fever&quot;, was added to some of RCA&#x27;s radio promotional records. Roth was not happy with the commercial direction the band was taking. Although he performed on the band&#x27;s Japan tour, he departed to form his own band, Electric Sun prior to the release of the resultant double live album &quot;Tokyo Tapes&quot;. &quot;Tokyo Tapes&quot; was released in the US and Europe six months after its Japanese release. By that time in mid-1978, after auditioning around 140 guitarists, the Scorpions recruited Matthias Jabs, a veteran of the German rock scene who had played in the bands Lady and Fargo.

===Commercial success (1978–1992)===
Following the addition of Jabs, Scorpions left RCA for Mercury Records in the United States and EMI Records worldwide to record their next album &quot;Lovedrive&quot;. Just weeks after quitting UFO, Michael Schenker returned to the group for a short period during the recordings for the album. This gave the band three guitarists. &quot;Lovedrive&quot; was an album that some critics consider to be the pinnacle of their career. Containing such fan favourites as &quot;Loving You Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;Always Somewhere&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, it firmly cemented the &quot;Scorpions formula&quot; of hard rock songs mixed with melodic ballads. Although it had been widely believed for decades that Michael Schenker&#x27;s contribution to the record was only limited to three songs, he vehemently maintained he appeared on the whole album during an interview with satellite radio host Eddie Trunk. The album&#x27;s provocative artwork was named &quot;Best album sleeve of 1979&quot; by &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, yet ultimately changed for American release. &quot;Lovedrive&quot; reached No. 55 on the US charts, demonstrating that the band was gathering an international following. After the completion and release of the album the band decided to retain Michael in the band, forcing Jabs to leave. However, in April 1979, during their tour in France, Michael quit again and Jabs was brought in permanently to replace him.

In 1980, the band released &quot;Animal Magnetism&quot;, again with a provocative cover this time showing a girl kneeling and a Doberman Pinscher sitting in front of a man. &quot;Animal Magnetism&quot; contained classics such as &quot;The Zoo&quot; and &quot;Make It Real&quot;. Soon after the album&#x27;s release, Meine began experiencing throat problems. He required surgery on his vocal cords and doubts were raised about whether he would ever sing again.

Meanwhile, the band began working on their next album, &quot;Blackout&quot; in 1981. A then-unknown Don Dokken was brought in to provide guide and backing vocals while Meine recovered. Meine eventually healed completely and was able to finish the album. &quot;Blackout&quot; was released in 1982 and quickly became the band&#x27;s best selling album to date, eventually going platinum. Meine&#x27;s voice showed no signs of weakness and fan response to the album was good. &quot;Blackout&quot; spawned two singles: &quot;No One Like You&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Live Without You&quot;.

Gaining in popularity from the success of &quot;Blackout&quot;, the Scorpions performed to over 375,000 fans on Day 2 at the three-day US Festival concert held in San Bernardino, California during Memorial Day Weekend of 1983. The concert was aired live on MTV, giving the band wide exposure in a live show.

The 1984 album &quot;Love at First Sting&quot; cemented the Scorpions&#x27; status as an internationally popular band. Propelled by the single &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot;, &quot;Love at First Sting&quot; climbed the charts and went double platinum in the USA a few months after its release.

MTV gave the album&#x27;s videos &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Leaving You&quot;, &quot;Big City Nights&quot;, and the power ballad &quot;Still Loving You&quot; significant airplay, greatly contributing to the album&#x27;s success. The channel even supplied Scorpions with the nickname &quot;The Ambassadors of Rock&quot;, to the chagrin of industry insiders who recognized the executive influence behind the scenes. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named them &quot;The Heroes of Heavy Metal&quot;.

The band toured extensively behind &quot;Love at First Sting&quot; and released their second live album, &quot;World Wide Live&quot; in 1985. Recorded over a year-long world tour and released at the height of their popularity, the album was another success for the band, peaking at No. 14 in the charts in the US and at No. 18 in the UK.

After their extensive world tours, the band finally returned to the studio to record &quot;Savage Amusement&quot;. Released in 1988, four years after their previous studio album, &quot;Savage Amusement&quot; represented a more polished and mature sound similar to the style Def Leppard had found success with. The album sold well but was considered somewhat of a critical disappointment. However, British heavy rock magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; did award the album five K&#x27;s out of five.

On the &quot;Savage Amusement&quot; tour in 1988, the Scorpions became only the second Western group (not American) to play in the Soviet Union. Indeed, Uriah Heep had performed earlier in December 1987 in Leningrad. The following year the band returned to perform at the Moscow Music Peace Festival. As a result, the Scorpions developed an extended Russian fan base and still return to perform. Also in 1989, Scorpions released the compilation album &quot;Best of Rockers &#x27;n&#x27; Ballads&quot;, which, in addition to the band&#x27;s hits from 1979 to 1988, included several rare or previously unreleased tracks: &quot;Hey You&quot;, from the &quot;Lovedrive&quot; sessions; a remixed version of &quot;Is There Anybody There?&quot;; and a cover of the Who&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot;, which was also included on that same year&#x27;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven/Highway to Hell&quot; charity compilation album. This is the Scorpions&#x27; only compilation album to be certified platinum in the United States.

Wishing to distance themselves from the &quot;Savage Amusement&quot; style, the band separated from their long-time producer and &quot;Sixth Scorpion&quot;, Dieter Dierks, replacing him with Keith Olsen when they returned to the studio in 1990. &quot;Crazy World&quot; was released that year and displayed a less polished sound. The album was propelled in large part by the massive success of the ballad &quot;Wind of Change&quot;. The song muses on the socio-political changes that were occurring in Eastern Europe and other parts of the world at the end of the Cold War. &quot;Crazy World&quot; is the band&#x27;s last album to receive gold or platinum certification in the United States. On 21 July 1990, they joined many other guests for Roger Waters&#x27; massive performance of &quot;The Wall&quot; in Berlin. Scorpions performed both versions of &quot;In the Flesh&quot; from &quot;The Wall&quot;.

After the &quot;Crazy World&quot; tour, the band&#x27;s long-serving bassist Francis Buchholz left the group.

===Later years (1993–2009)===
In 1993, the Scorpions released &quot;Face the Heat&quot;. Bass was handled by Ralph Rieckermann. For the recording process, the band brought in producer Bruce Fairbairn. The album&#x27;s sound was more metal than melodic. Neither the heavy metal single &quot;Alien Nation&quot; nor the ballad &quot;Under the Same Sun&quot; came close to matching the success of &quot;Wind of Change&quot;. &quot;Face the Heat&quot; was a moderate success. In 1995, a new album, &quot;Live Bites&quot;, was produced. The disc documented retro live performances from their Savage Amusement Tour in 1988, all the way through the Face the Heat Tour in 1994. While the album had a technologically cleaner sound in comparison to their best-selling live album, &quot;World Wide Live&quot;, it was not as successful.

Prior to recording their 13th studio album, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Pure Instinct&quot;, drummer Herman Rarebell left the band to set up a recording label. Curt Cress took charge of the drumsticks for the album before Louisville, Kentucky-born James Kottak took over permanently. The album had many ballads. Still, the album&#x27;s singles &quot;Wild Child&quot; and the soothing ballad &quot;You and I&quot; both enjoyed moderate success.

1999 saw the release of &quot;Eye II Eye&quot; and a significant change in the band&#x27;s style, mixing in elements of pop and techno. While the album was slickly produced, it was not received well by fans. The video to the album&#x27;s first European single, &quot;To Be No. 1&quot;, featured a Monica Lewinsky look-alike which did little to improve its popularity.

The following year, the Scorpions had an artistic collaboration with the Berlin Philharmonic that resulted in a 10-song album named &quot;Moment of Glory&quot;. The album went a long way toward rebuilding the band&#x27;s reputation after the harsh criticism of &quot;Eye II Eye&quot;. However, critics accused them of following on the coattails of Metallica&#x27;s similar collaboration (&quot;S&amp;M&quot;) with the San Francisco Symphony which had been released the previous year, even though the orchestra had first approached the Scorpions with the idea in 1995.
In 2001, the Scorpions released &quot;Acoustica&quot;, a live unplugged album featuring acoustic reworkings of the band&#x27;s biggest hits, plus new tracks. While appreciated by fans, the lack of a new studio album was frustrating to some, and &quot;Acoustica&quot; did little to return the band to the spotlight.

In 2004, the band released &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, an album that was hailed by critics as a long-awaited return to form. The album was the heaviest the band had released since &quot;Face the Heat&quot;. Whether a result of poor promotion by the band&#x27;s label or the long time between studio releases, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; received little airplay and did not chart. Scorpions toured extensively behind the album and played as &quot;Special Guests&quot; with Judas Priest during the 2005 British tour—these were the Scorpions&#x27; first dates in the UK since 1999.

In early 2006, the Scorpions released the DVD &quot;1 Night in Vienna&quot; that included 14 live tracks and a complete rockumentary. In LA, the band spent about four months in the studio with producers James Michael and Desmond Child working on a concept album titled &quot;&quot;, which was released in late May 2007, and was followed by the &quot;Humanity World Tour&quot;.
In 2007, the band collaborated with two of their signature tracks in the video game series, &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;. &quot;No One Like You&quot; was featured on the &quot;Rocks the &#x27;80s&quot; version of the game while &quot;Rock You Like A Hurricane&quot; was released on &quot;Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock&quot;.

On 14 May 2007, the Scorpions released &quot;Humanity – Hour I&quot; in Europe. &quot;Humanity – Hour I&quot; became available in the U.S. on 28 August on New Door Records, entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts at number No. 63.

In a September 2007 podcast interview, Meine said the album was not so much a &quot;concept album&quot;, but rather a collection of songs with a common theme. &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to make another record with songs about boys chasing girls. I mean, come on, give me a break,&quot; Meine said.

Asked in 2007 if the band was planning to release a &quot;Humanity – Hour II&quot;, Meine replied:
On 20 December 2007, the Scorpions played at a concert for the elite of Russia&#x27;s security forces in the Kremlin. The concert was a celebration of the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Cheka—predecessor of the KGB. The band claimed they thought they were performing a Christmas concert. They said their concert was by no means a tribute to the Cheka, communism, or Russia&#x27;s brutal past. Members of the audience included Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev.

On 22 February 2009, the band received Germany&#x27;s ECHO Honorary Award for lifetime achievement at Berlin&#x27;s O2 World.

===&quot;Sting in the Tail&quot;, &quot;Comeblack&quot;, and touring (2010–2014)===
In November 2009, the Scorpions announced their 17th studio album, &quot;Sting in the Tail&quot;, would be released in early 2010, recorded in Hanover with Swedish producers Mikael &quot;Nord&quot; Andersson and Martin Hansen. It was released on 23 March 2010.

On 24 January 2010, the band announced their initial intentions for &quot;Sting in the Tail&quot; to be their last album, and the tour supporting it their final tour, although the band later made the decision to continue recording past the end of the tour. Dokken was scheduled to open for them but cancelled after a dispute.
On 6 April 2010, they were enshrined in Hollywood&#x27;s Rock Walk in a handprint ceremony, with the band members placing their hands in a long slab of wet cement next to other musical artists.

An album of re-recordings of older songs, &quot;Comeblack&quot;, was released on 7 November 2011.

Meine was asked in a July 2011 interview about the future of the Scorpions. He replied, &quot;Our newest project comes out in the next few months. It gives you a chance to experience the Scorpions in 3D. You can actually feel the smoke string out of the guitar like it is a live show. It is an incredible experience. The DVD features our concerts in 3D in Germany. We are just about to do the mix and it should be in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia hopefully soon. Indeed, the strong 3D technology makes us feel like pioneers after all these years [he says, laughing]. We have an album coming out later this year featuring classics. You know our love for them. The &#x27;60s was the era for our inspiration. Our movie/documentary also is soon to be released. We have cameras with us on tours, so this documentary is being made during our tours. It also gives you a picture of the Scorpions career and journey.&quot;
Despite initial plans for a break up or retirement, guitarist Matthias Jabs told AZ Central on 12 June 2012 that the Scorpions would not split up. A month later, Jabs told &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine the band had been working on an album that would contain unreleased songs they recorded for the albums &quot;Blackout&quot;, &quot;Love at First Sting&quot;, &quot;Savage Amusement&quot;, and &quot;Crazy World&quot; and planned to release it in 2014. In April, the Scorpions announced shows in Russia and Belarus with an orchestra in October 2013. On 11, 12, and 14 September 2013, the band played three MTV Unplugged concerts at the Lycabettus-Theatre in Athens. On 6 November 2013, they announced four more MTV Unplugged Concert in Germany 2014. In December 2013, in an interview at Rock Show radio program in Greece, Meine said he was not sure if the album with unreleased songs they recorded for the albums &quot;Blackout&quot;, &quot;Love at First Sting&quot;, &quot;Savage Amusement&quot; and &quot;Crazy World&quot; would be released in 2014 or later on.

In 2013, the band released the album &quot;MTV Unplugged in Athens&quot;. The album featured classic songs like &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot; and &quot;Big City Nights&quot; done acoustically, but also included rare live performances of songs like &quot;When The Smoke Is Going Down&quot; and &quot;Where the River Flows&quot;.
On 16 August 2014, they announced a new album in the works, due for release sometime in 2015.

In 2014, the Scorpions were nominated for two Echo Awards (&quot;Euro Grammys&quot;) for their MTV Unplugged.

===50th anniversary and &quot;Return to Forever&quot; (2015–2017)===

On 23 October 2014, Meine spoke to the band&#x27;s French fan-club Crazyscorps, and announced the new record would be published in February or March 2015, to coincide with the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Contrary to what the band said in 2013, the new album presented not only newly recorded versions of never-published songs, but also new material, written between 2011 and 2014.
The album was recorded in Sweden, with producers Martin Hansen and Mikael Nord Andersson. Drummer James Kottak, who left the band in May 2014 for rehab, returned to play drums. The new album &quot;Return to Forever&quot; was released on 20 February 2015.

On 29 August 2015, the Scorpions announced 50th anniversary deluxe editions of their albums &quot;Taken By Force&quot;, &quot;Tokyo Tapes&quot;, &quot;Lovedrive&quot;, &quot;Animal Magnetism&quot;, &quot;Blackout&quot;, &quot;Love at First Sting&quot;, &quot;World Wide Live&quot;, and &quot;Savage Amusement&quot; which were released 6 November 2015. These deluxe releases include &quot;dozens of unreleased songs, alternate versions of big hits, rough mixes, and rare live concert recordings&quot;. On 28 April 2016, it was announced that Motörhead drummer Mikkey Dee would fill in for James Kottak and play drums on 12 North American headlining dates, including a run of shows at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas dubbed &quot;Scorpions Blacked Out in Las Vegas&quot; with Queensrÿche opening the Vegas shows, and dates in São Paulo. On 12 September 2016, Dee was officially announced as the band&#x27;s new permanent drummer.

On 18 January 2017, the Scorpions were inducted into the Hall of Heavy Metal History for leading the two-guitar attack in heavy metal. Proceeds from the ceremony benefitted the Ronnie James Dio Stand Up and Shout Cancer Fund.

===&quot;Rock Believer&quot; and possible follow-up album (2018–present)===
In an August 2018 interview with Digital Journal, Scorpions guitarist Rudolf Schenker stated that the band was open to the idea of recording a follow-up to &quot;Return to Forever&quot;. He explained: &quot;We are still waiting for a moment for inspiration to do another album, like Judas Priest and Metallica did. You have to wait until the time is right.&quot; Klaus Meine hinted in May 2019 that &quot;there might be a new album out in 2020.&quot;

On 28 April 2020, Scorpions released (on their YouTube channel) a new (2-minute 16-second short) song entitled &quot;Sign of Hope&quot;, inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 25 July 2020, Scorpions entered Peppermint Park Studios in Hanover to resume working on their nineteenth studio album. The album&#x27;s initial sessions, which were supposed to take place in Los Angeles, were done remotely, with producer Greg Fidelman participating via Zoom; however, drummer Mikkey Dee confirmed in a March 2021 interview with Robb Flynn of Machine Head that the band had to abandon their plans to work with Fidelman, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Progress on the album had continued to be slow by August 2021, when Scorpions posted a video on Facebook from the studio where they rehearsed a new song (possibly titled &quot;Seventh Sun&quot;) for an upcoming tour.

On 29 September 2021, Scorpions announced &quot;Rock Believer&quot; as the title of their nineteenth studio album and set 11 February 2022 as its release date; the band later pushed back the release of the album to two weeks after its initially planned release date. They supported the album with a European tour with Mammoth WVH and a North American tour with Thundermother and Whitesnake, as part of the latter&#x27;s farewell tour.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, they collaborated with Japanese rock star Yoshiki to perform &quot;Wind of Change&quot; for the documentary film &quot;.&quot; This was the first time the band came together to perform the Ukraine version of the song. The performance was later released as a music video on YouTube.

In December 2023, it was also announced that the band would return to Turkey for the first time in eight years to perform a live show in Istanbul in May 2024. On October 24th, 2024, the band gave a press conference in Hanover at which a concert on July 5, 2025 at the Heinz-von-Heiden-Arena was announced for the 60th anniversary under the motto &quot;Coming Home to Hannover Scorpions and Friends&quot;. Judas Priest were confirmed as a special guest.

In February 2025, when asked if Scorpions were planning to make a 20th studio album, Meine stated that &quot;there are a million good reasons to go back into the studio sometime soon. But, on the other side, these days, it&#x27;s not the time anymore really to make albums.&quot; He did not rule out recording a &quot;few songs&quot;, and added that the band will discuss working on new music &quot;before [they] make plans for what might come up&quot; in 2026.

<text>In Celtic cultures, a bard is an oral repository and professional story teller, verse-maker, music composer, oral historian and genealogist, employed by a patron (such as a monarch or chieftain) to commemorate one or more of the patron&#x27;s ancestors and to praise the patron&#x27;s own activities.

With the decline of a living bardic tradition in the modern period, the term has loosened to mean a generic minstrel or author (especially a famous one). For example, William Shakespeare and Rabindranath Tagore are respectively known as &quot;the Bard of Avon&quot; (often simply &quot;the Bard&quot;) and &quot;the Bard of Bengal&quot;. In 16th-century Scotland, it turned into a derogatory term for an musician; nonetheless it was later romanticised by Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832).

In the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, the title Gayen or Gain used as a surname by members of the Bengali Kayastha caste was given to bards in medieval times.

==Etymology==
The English term &quot;bard&quot; is a loan word from the Celtic languages: Gaulish: &quot;bardo-&quot; (&#x27;bard, poet&#x27;), and (&#x27;bard, poet&#x27;), (&#x27;singer, poet&#x27;), Middle Breton: &quot;barz&quot; (&#x27;minstrel&#x27;), Old Cornish: (&#x27;jester&#x27;). The ancient Gaulish *&quot;bardos&quot; is attested as (sing.) in Latin and as (plur.) in Ancient Greek. It also appears as a stem in the compound words &quot;bardo-cucullus&quot; (&#x27;bard&#x27;s hood&#x27;), &quot;bardo-magus&quot; (&#x27;field of the bard&#x27;), &quot;barditus&quot; (a song to fire soldiers), and in &quot;bardala&quot; (&#x27;crested lark&#x27;, a singing bird).

All of these terms come from the Proto-Celtic noun (&#x27;poet-singer, minstrel&#x27;), itself derived, with regular Celtic sound shift &gt; , from the Proto-Indo-European compound &quot;&quot;, which literally means &#x27;praise-maker&#x27;. It is cognate with Sanskrit: (&#x27;calls, praise&#x27;), (&#x27;grateful, pleasant, delightful&#x27;), (&#x27;praise&#x27;), and Armenian: (&#x27;raise voice&#x27;).
==History==

In the words of the Oxford English Dictionary, the bards were an &quot;ancient Celtic order of minstrel-poets, whose primary function appears to have been to compose and sing (usually to the harp) verses celebrating the achievements of chiefs and warriors, and who committed to verse historical and traditional facts, religious precepts, laws, genealogies, etc.&quot;

In medieval Gaelic and Welsh society, a &quot;bard&quot; (Scottish and Irish Gaelic) or &quot;bardd&quot; (Welsh) was a professional poet, employed to compose elegies for his lord. If the employer failed to pay the proper amount, the bard would then compose a satire (c.f. &quot;fili&quot;, &quot;fáith&quot;). In other Indo-European societies, the same function was fulfilled by skalds, rhapsodes, minstrels and &quot;scops&quot;, among others. A hereditary caste of professional poets in Proto-Indo-European society has been reconstructed by comparison of the position of poets in medieval Ireland and in ancient India in particular.

Bards (who are not the same as the Irish or ) were those who sang the songs recalling the tribal warriors&#x27; deeds of bravery as well as the genealogies and family histories of the ruling strata among Celtic societies. The pre-Christian Celtic people recorded no written histories; however, Celtic peoples did maintain an intricate oral history committed to memory and transmitted by bards and filid. Bards facilitated the memorization of such materials by the use of metre, rhyme and other formulaic poetic devices.

==Regions==

===Ireland===

In medieval Ireland, bards were one of two distinct groups of poets, the other being the &quot;fili&quot;. According to the Early Irish law text on status, &quot;Uraicecht Becc&quot;, bards were a lesser class of poets, not eligible for higher poetic roles as described above. However, it has also been argued that the distinction between &quot;filid&quot; (pl. of &quot;fili&quot;) and bards was a creation of Christian Ireland, and that the &quot;filid&quot; were more associated with the church. By the Early Modern Period, these names came to be used interchangeably.

Irish bards formed a professional hereditary caste of highly trained, learned poets. The bards were steeped in the history and traditions of clan and country, as well as in the technical requirements of a verse technique that was syllabic and used assonance, half rhyme and alliteration, among other conventions. As officials of the court of king or chieftain, they performed a number of official roles. They were chroniclers and satirists whose job it was to praise their employers and damn those who crossed them. It was believed that a well-aimed bardic satire, , could raise boils on the face of its target.

thumb|left|230px|&#x27;Beardna&#x27;, a loanword of Celtic originThe bardic system lasted until the mid-17th century in Ireland and the early 18th century in Scotland. In Ireland, their fortunes had always been linked to the Gaelic aristocracy, which declined along with them during the Tudor Reconquest.

The early history of the bards can be known only indirectly through mythological stories. The first mention of the bardic profession in Ireland is found in the Book of Invasions, in a story about the Irish colony of Tuatha Dé Danann (Tribe of Goddess Danu), also called Danonians. They became the &quot;aos sí&quot; (folk of the mound), comparable to Norse &quot;alfr&quot; and British fairy. During the tenth year of the reign of the last Belgic monarch, the people of the colony of Tuatha Dé Danann, as the Irish called it, invaded and settled in Ireland. They were divided into three tribes—the tribe of Tuatha who were the nobility, the tribe of De who were the priests (those devoted to serving God or De) and the tribe of Danann, who were the bards. This account of the Tuatha Dé Danann must be considered legendary; however the story was an integral part of the oral history of Irish bards themselves. One of the most notable bards in Irish mythology was Amergin Glúingel, a bard, druid and judge for the Milesians.

===Scotland===

The best-known group of bards in Scotland were the members of the MacMhuirich family, who flourished from the 15th to the 18th centuries. The family was centred in the Hebrides, and claimed descent from a 13th-century Irish bard who, according to legend, was exiled to Scotland. The family was at first chiefly employed by the Lords of the Isles as poets, lawyers, and physicians. With the fall of the Lordship of the Isles in the 15th century, the family was chiefly employed by the chiefs of the MacDonalds of Clanranald. Members of the family were also recorded as musicians in the early 16th century, and as clergymen possibly as early as the early 15th century. The last of the family to practise classical Gaelic poetry was Domhnall MacMhuirich, who lived on South Uist in the 18th century.

In Gaelic-speaking areas, a village bard or village poet () is a local poet who composes works in a traditional style relating to that community. Notable village bards include Dòmhnall Ruadh Chorùna and .

===Wales===

A number of bards in Welsh mythology have been preserved in medieval Welsh literature such as the Red Book of Hergest, the White Book of Rhydderch, the Book of Aneirin and the Book of Taliesin. The bards Aneirin and Taliesin may be legendary reflections of historical bards active in the 6th and 7th centuries. Very little historical information about Dark Age Welsh court tradition survives, but the Middle Welsh material came to be the nucleus of the Matter of Britain and Arthurian legend as they developed from the 13th century. The (Welsh) Laws of Hywel Dda, originally compiled around 900, identify a bard as a member of a king&#x27;s household. His duties, when the bodyguard were sharing out booty, included the singing of the sovereignty of Britain—possibly why the genealogies of the British high kings survived into the written historical record.

A large number of Welsh bards were blind people.

The royal form of bardic tradition ceased in the 13th century, when the 1282 Edwardian conquest permanently ended the rule of the Welsh princes. The legendary suicide of &quot;The Last Bard&quot; (c. 1283), was commemorated in the poem &quot;The Bards of Wales&quot; by the Hungarian poet János Arany in 1857, as a way of encoded resistance to the suppressive politics of his own time. However, the poetic and musical traditions were continued throughout the Middle Ages, e.g., by noted 14th-century poets Dafydd ap Gwilym and Iolo Goch. Also the tradition of regularly assembling bards at an eisteddfod never lapsed and was strengthened by formation of the Gorsedd by Iolo Morganwg in 1792.

Wales in the twentieth century is a leading Celtic upholder of the bardic tradition. The annual National Eisteddfod of Wales () (which was first held in 1880) is held in which bards are chaired (see :Category:Chaired bards) and crowned (see :Category:Crowned bards). The Urdd National Eisteddfod is also held annually. And many schools hold their own annual &quot;eisteddfodau&quot; which emulate bardic traditions.

Several published research studies into the Welsh bardic tradition have been published. They include Williams (1850), Parry-Williams (1947), Morgan (1983) and Jones (1986). Doubtless research studies have also been published in the current century.

==Literature==

From its frequent use in romanticism, &#x27;The Bard&#x27; became attached as a title to various poets
* &#x27;The Bard of Armagh&#x27; is Martin Hearty
* &#x27;The Bard of Avon,&#x27; &#x27;The Immortal Bard&#x27; or (in England) simply &#x27;The Bard&#x27; is William Shakespeare
* &#x27;The Bard of Ayrshire&#x27; (or in Scotland, simply &#x27;The Bard&#x27;) is Robert Burns
* &#x27;The Bard of Bengal&#x27; is Rabindranath Tagore
* &#x27;The Bard of Olney&#x27; is William Cowper
* &#x27;The Bard of Rydal Mount&#x27; is William Wordsworth
* &#x27;The Bard of Salford&#x27; is John Cooper Clarke
* &#x27;The Bard of Twickenham&#x27; is Alexander Pope
* Australian bush poets such as Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson are referred to as &#x27;bush bards&#x27;
* Bob Dylan, Jim MacCool and the band Blind Guardian have also been termed &#x27;bards&#x27;

==Popular culture==
From its Romanticist usage, the notion of the bard as a minstrel with qualities of a priest, magician or seer also entered the fantasy genre in the 1960s to 1980s, for example as the &#x27;Bard&#x27; class in Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Pathfinder, &quot;Bard&quot; by Keith Taylor (1981), &quot;&quot; by Morgan Llywelyn (1984), in video games in fantasy settings such as &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1985), and in modern literature and TV like The Witcher books by Andrzej Sapkowski (1986–2013) show by Lauren Schmidt Hissrich (2019).

As of 2020, an online trend to cover modern songs using medieval style musical instruments and composition, including rewriting the lyrics in a medieval style, is known as bardcore.

In 2023 Google released its AI chatbot Bard.

<text>Serge Gainsbourg (; born Lucien Ginsburg; 2 April 1928 – 2 March 1991) was a French singer-songwriter, actor, composer, and director. Regarded as one of the most important figures in French pop, he was renowned for often provocative releases which caused uproar in France, dividing public opinion. His artistic output ranged from his early work in jazz, chanson, and yé-yé to later efforts in rock, zouk, funk, reggae, and electronica. Gainsbourg&#x27;s varied musical style and individuality make him difficult to categorise, although his legacy has been firmly established and he is often regarded as one of the world&#x27;s most influential popular musicians.

His lyrical works incorporated wordplay, with humorous, bizarre, provocative, sexual, satirical or subversive overtones. Gainsbourg wrote over 550 songs, which have been covered more than 1,000 times by diverse artists.
Since his death from a second heart attack in 1991, Gainsbourg&#x27;s music has reached legendary stature in France. While controversial in his lifetime, he has become one of France&#x27;s best-loved public figures. He has also gained a cult following all over the world with chart success in the United Kingdom and Belgium with &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... moi non plus&quot; and &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, respectively.

== Biography ==

=== 1928–1956: Early years ===
Serge Gainsbourg was born in Paris on 2 April 1928. He was the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Joseph and Olga Ginsburg, who fled to Paris via Istanbul after the 1917 Russian Revolution. Joseph met Olga during his stay in Crimea, and they later married. Olga was a singer born in Crimea under the Russian Empire, and Joseph was a classically trained pianist who performed primarily at cabarets and casinos. Joseph taught Serge and his twin sister Liliane to play the piano.

Gainsbourg&#x27;s childhood was profoundly affected by the occupation of France by Germany during World War II. The identifying yellow star that Jews were required to wear haunted Gainsbourg; in later years he was able to transmute this memory into creative inspiration. During the occupation, the Ginsburg family fled from Paris to Limoges using forged documents. At the time, Limoges was part of zone libre, an area of France governed by the Vichy regime that was not occupied by Germany, but it became unsafe for Jews after Germany eventually occupied the area in 1942.

Serge attended Lycée Condorcet in Paris, but dropped out before completing his &quot;Baccalauréat&quot;. In 1945, Gainsbourg&#x27;s father enrolled him in Beaux-Arts de Paris, a prestigious art school. Serge later transferred to the Académie de Montmartre, where his professors included the likes of André Lhote and Fernand Léger. There, Gainsbourg met his first wife, Elisabeth &quot;Lize&quot; Levitsky, the daughter of Russian aristocrats and a part-time model. Serge and Lize were married on November 3, 1951, and the marriage ended in divorce in 1957.

In 1948, Serge was conscripted by the military for twelve months of service in Courbevoie. He never saw action, spending his time playing dirty songs on guitar, visiting prostitutes, and drinking. Serge later claimed that the military service turned him into an alcoholic. Gainsbourg obtained work teaching music and painting at a school in Le Mesnil-le-Roi, just outside of Paris. The school was founded under the auspices of local rabbis to serve the orphaned children of murdered deportees. Here, Gainsbourg heard accounts of Nazi Germany&#x27;s acts of persecution and genocide, and these stories inspired his songwriting several decades later.

===1957–1963: Early work as a pianist and chanson singer===
Gainsbourg was disillusioned with his school painting gig and instead moved on to working odd jobs playing the piano in bars, usually as a stand-in for his father. He soon became the venue pianist at the drag cabaret club Madame Arthur. Whilst filling in a form to join the songwriting society SACEM, Gainsbourg decided to change his first name to Serge. According to his future partner Jane Birkin, &quot;Lucien reminded him of a hairdresser&#x27;s assistant.&quot; He chose Gainsbourg as his last name, an homage to the English painter Thomas Gainsborough, whom he admired.

Gainsbourg had a revelation when he saw Boris Vian performing at the Milord l&#x27;Arsouille club, whose provocative and humorous songs would influence Serge&#x27;s own compositions. At the Milord l&#x27;Arsouille, Gainsbourg accompanied singer and club star Michèle Arnaud on the guitar. In 1957, Arnaud and the club&#x27;s director Francis Claude discovered Gainsbourg&#x27;s compositions while visiting his home to see his paintings. The next day, Claude urged Gainsbourg to perform on stage on his own. Despite his stage fright, Gainsbourg performed his own repertoire, including &quot;Le Poinçonneur des Lilas,&quot; which describes a day in the life of a Paris Métro ticket man, whose job is to validate passenger tickets by stamping holes in them. In the song, the job is described as so monotonous, that the ticket man eventually thinks of putting a hole through his head and being buried in another hole. After the debut, Serge was given a steady performance segment at the club, where he was eventually spotted by talent agent Jacques Canetti, who helped advance Gainsbourg&#x27;s career with a regular performance segment at the Théâtre des Trois Baudets, as well as by touring. In 1958, Arnaud began recording several interpretations of Gainsbourg&#x27;s songs.

His debut album, &quot;Du chant à la une !...&quot; (1958), was recorded in the summer of 1958, backed by arranger Alain Goraguer and his orchestra, beginning a fruitful collaboration. It was released in September, becoming a commercial and critical failure, despite winning the grand prize at L&#x27;Academie Charles Cross and the praise of Boris Vian, who compared him to Cole Porter. His next album, &quot;N° 2&quot; (1959), suffered a similar fate. He made his film debut in 1959 with a supporting role in the French-Italian co-production &quot;Come Dance with Me&quot;, starring his future lover Brigitte Bardot. In the following year, he featured as a Roman officer in the Italian sword-and-sandals epic-film &quot;The Revolt of the Slaves&quot;. He would continue playing &quot;nasty characters&quot; in similar productions, including &quot;Samson&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Fury of Hercules&quot; (1962). Gainsbourg&#x27;s first commercial success came in 1960 with his single &quot;L&#x27;Eau à la bouche&quot;, the title song from the film of the same name, for which he had composed the score. &quot;L&#x27;Étonnant Serge Gainsbourg&quot; (1961), his third LP, included what would become one of his best known songs from this period, &quot;La Chanson de Prévert&quot;, which lifted lyrics from the Jacques Prévert poem &quot;Les feuilles mortes&quot;. After a night of drinking champagne and dancing with singer Juliette Gréco, Gainsbourg went home and wrote &quot;La Javanaise&quot; for her. They would both release versions of the song in 1962, but it is Gainsbourg&#x27;s rendition that has endured. His fourth album, &quot;Serge Gainsbourg N° 4&quot; was released in 1962, incorporating Latin and rock and roll influences whilst his next, &quot;Gainsbourg Confidentiel&quot; (1963), featured a more minimalistic jazz approach, accompanied only by a double bass and electric guitar.

=== 1963–1966: Eurovision and involvement in the yé-yé movement ===

Despite initially mocking yé-yé, a style of French pop typically sung by young female singers, Gainsbourg would soon become one of its most important figures after writing a string of hits for artists like Brigitte Bardot, Petula Clark and France Gall. He had met Gall after being introduced by a friend as they were Philips Records labelmates, thus beginning a successful collaboration that would produce hits like &quot;N&#x27;écoute pas les idoles&quot;, the frequently covered &quot;Laisse tomber les filles&quot;, and &quot;Poupée de cire, poupée de son&quot;, the latter of which was the Luxembourgish winning entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1965. Inspired by the 4th movement (Prestissimo in F minor) from Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Piano Sonata No. 1&quot;, the song featured double entendres and wordplay, a staple of Gainsbourg&#x27;s lyrics. The controversially risqué &quot;Les sucettes&quot; (&quot;Lollipops&quot;), featured references to oral sex, unbeknownst to the 18-year-old Gall, who thought the song was about lollipops. In 2001, Gall expressed displeasure at Gainsbourg&#x27;s earlier antics, stating she felt &quot;betrayed by the adults around me.&quot;

Gainsbourg married a second time on 7 January 1964, to Françoise-Antoinette &quot;Béatrice&quot; Pancrazzi, with whom he had two children: a daughter named Natacha (b. 8 August 1964) and a son, Paul (born in spring 1968). He divorced Béatrice in February 1966.

His next album, &quot;Gainsbourg Percussions&quot; (1964), was inspired by the rhythms and melodies of African musicians Miriam Makeba and Babatunde Olatunji. Olatunji later sued Gainsbourg for lifting three tracks from his 1960 album &quot;Drums of Passion&quot;. Nevertheless, the album has been hailed as being ahead of its time for its incorporation of world music and lyrical content depicting interracial love. Between 1965 and 1966, Gainsbourg composed the music and sang the words of science fiction writer André Ruellan for several songs made for a series of animated &quot;Marie-Mathematics&quot; shorts created by Jean-Claude Forest. He would reunite with Michèle Arnaud for the duet &quot;Les Papillons noirs&quot; from her 1966 comeback record.

=== 1967–1970: Famous muses and duets ===

In 1967, Gainsbourg wrote the script and provided the soundtrack for the musical comedy television film &quot;Anna&quot; starring Anna Karina in the titular role. Another Gainsbourg song, &quot;Boum-Badaboum&quot; by Minouche Barelli, was entered by Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest 1967, coming in fifth place. In that year, Gainsbourg would have a brief but ardent love affair with Brigitte Bardot. One day she asked him to write the most beautiful love song he could imagine and, that night, he wrote the duets &quot;&quot; and &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; for her. The erotic yet cynical &quot;Je t&#x27;aime&quot;, describing the hopelessness of physical love, was recorded by the pair in a small glass booth in Paris but after Bardot&#x27;s husband, German businessman Gunter Sachs, became aware of the recording, he demanded it be withdrawn. Bardot pleaded with Gainsbourg not to release it, and he complied.

Bardot&#x27;s LP &quot;Brigitte Bardot Show 67&quot; contained four songs penned by Gainsbourg, including duets such as the playful &quot;Comic Strip&quot; and the string-laden &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, which tells the story of the American criminal couple and was based on a poem written by Bonnie Parker herself. His own &quot;Initials B.B.&quot; (1968) included these duets and was his first album in nearly four years. It blended orchestral pop with the style of rock characteristic of London in the Swinging Sixties, where the album was largely recorded. Gainsbourg borrowed heavily from Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;New World Symphony&quot; for the title track, named after and dedicated to Bardot. Phillips subsidiary Fontana Records also issued the compilation LP &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1968) comprising their duets and other previously recorded material.

His percussion-heavy 1968 single &quot;Requiem pour un con&quot; was performed onscreen by Gainsbourg in the crime film &quot;Le Pacha&quot;, for which he was the composer. Shortly after being left by Bardot, Gainsbourg was asked by Françoise Hardy to write a French version of the song &quot;It Hurts to Say Goodbye&quot;. The result was &quot;Comment te dire adieu&quot;, which is notable for its uncommon rhymes and has become one of Hardy&#x27;s signature songs.

In mid-1968 Gainsbourg started a relationship with English singer and actress Jane Birkin, 18 years his junior, whom he met when she was cast as his co-star in &quot;Slogan&quot; (1969). In the film, Gainsbourg starred as a commercial director who has an affair behind the back of his pregnant wife with a younger woman, played by Birkin. Gainsbourg also provided the soundtrack and dueted with Birkin on the title theme &quot;La Chanson de Slogan&quot;. The relationship would last for over a decade. In July 1971 they had a daughter, Charlotte, who would become an actress and singer. Although many sources state that they were married, according to Charlotte this was not the case. After filming &quot;Slogan&quot;, Gainsbourg asked Birkin to re-record &quot;Je t&#x27;aime...&quot; with him. Her vocals were an octave higher than Bardot&#x27;s, contained suggestive heavy breathing and culminated in simulated orgasm sounds. Released in February 1969, the song topped the UK Singles Chart after being temporarily banned due to its overtly sexual content. It was banned from the radio in several other countries, including Spain, Sweden, Italy and France before 11pm. The song was even publicly denounced by The Vatican. It was included on the joint album &quot;Jane Birkin/Serge Gainsbourg&quot;, which also contained &quot;Élisa&quot; and new recordings of songs written for other artists including &quot;Les sucettes&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;anamour&quot; and &quot;Sous le soleil exactement&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named it the 44th best album of the 1960s. He and Birkin would share the screen in another Gainsbourg-scored film, &quot;Cannabis&quot; (1970), in which he played an American gangster who falls in love with a girl from a wealthy family.

=== 1971–1977: Concept albums ===

Following the success of &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... moi non plus&quot;, his record company had expected Gainsbourg to produce another hit. But after having already made a fortune, he was uninterested, deciding to &quot;move onto something serious&quot;. The result was his 1971 concept album &quot;Histoire de Melody Nelson&quot;, which tells the story of an illicit relationship between the narrator and the teenage Melody Nelson after running her over in his Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. The album heavily features Gainsbourg&#x27;s distinctive half-spoken, half-sung vocal delivery, loose drums, guitar, and bass evoking funk music, and lush string and choral arrangements by Jean-Claude Vannier. Despite only selling around 15,000 copies upon release, it has become highly influential and is often considered his &quot;magnum opus&quot;. An accompanying television special starring Gainsbourg and Birkin was also broadcast.

He suffered a heart attack in May 1973, but refused to cut back on his smoking and drinking. Gainsbourg&#x27;s next record &quot;Vu de l&#x27;extérieur&quot; (1973) was not strictly a concept album like its predecessor and follow-ups, despite its focus on scatology throughout. It largely failed to connect with critics and listeners. In that year, Gainsbourg also wrote all of the tracks on Birkin&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Di doo dah&quot; and he would continue to write for her until his death. In 1975, Gainsbourg released the darkly comic album &quot;Rock Around the Bunker&quot;, performed in an upbeat 1950s rock and roll style and written on the subject of Nazi Germany and the Second World War, drawing from his experiences as a Jewish child in occupied France. The next year saw the release of yet another concept album, &quot;L&#x27;Homme à tête de chou&quot; (&quot;The Cabbage Head Man&quot;), a nickname used by Gainsbourg himself in reference to his large ears. This album marked Gainsbourg&#x27;s first foray into the Jamaican reggae genre, a style he would revisit for his next two albums.

In 1976, Gainsbourg also made his directorial debut with &quot;Je t&#x27;aime moi non plus&quot;, an offbeat drama named after his song of the same name. It starred Birkin in the lead role, with American actor Joe Dallesandro playing the gay man she falls in love with. The film received positive critical notices from the French press and acclaimed director François Truffaut. Having previously turned down the offer to score the popular softcore pornography film &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; (1974), he agreed to do so for one of its sequels &quot;Goodbye Emmanuelle&quot; in 1977.

=== 1978–1981: Reggae period ===

In 1978, Gainsbourg dropped plans to record another concept album and contacted several Jamaican musicians including rhythm section players Sly and Robbie with the intention of recording a reggae album. He set off for Kingston, Jamaica in September to begin recording &quot;Aux armes et cætera&quot; (1979) with the likes of Sly and Robbie and the female backing singers The I-Threes of Bob Marley and the Wailers; thus making him the first white musician to record such an album in Jamaica. The album was immensely popular, achieving platinum status for selling over one million copies. But it was not without controversy, as the title track—a reggae version of the French national anthem &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;—received harsh criticism in the newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; from Michel Droit, who condemned the song and opined that it may cause a rise in antisemitism. Gainsbourg also received death threats from right-wing veteran soldiers of the Algerian War of Independence, who were opposed to their national anthem being arranged in reggae style. In 1979, a show had to be cancelled, because an angry mob of French Army parachutists came to demonstrate in the audience. Alone onstage, Gainsbourg raised his fist and answered: &quot;The true meaning of our national anthem is revolutionary&quot; and sang it &quot;a capella&quot; with the audience.

Birkin left Gainsbourg in 1980, but the two remained close, with Gainsbourg becoming the godfather of Birkin and Jacques Doillon&#x27;s daughter Lou and writing her next three albums. His first live album &quot;Enregistrement public au Théâtre Le Palace&quot; (1980), exhibited his reggae-influenced style at the time. Also in 1980, Gainsbourg dueted with actress Catherine Deneuve on the hit song &quot;Dieu fumeur de havanes&quot; from the film &quot;Je vous aime&quot; and published a novella entitled &quot;Evguénie Sokolov&quot;, the tale of an avant-garde painter who exploits his flatulence by creating a style known as &quot;gasograms&quot;. His final reggae recording, &quot;Mauvaises nouvelles des étoiles&quot; (1981), was recorded at Compass Point Studios in The Bahamas with the same personnel as its predecessor. Bob Marley, husband to The I Threes singer Rita Marley, was reportedly furious when he discovered that Gainsbourg had made his wife Rita sing erotic lyrics. New posthumous dub mixes of &quot;Aux armes et cætera&quot; and &quot;Mauvaises Nouvelles des Étoiles&quot; were released in 2003. During this period, Gainsbourg also had success writing material for other artists, mostly notably &quot;Manureva&quot; for Alain Chamfort, a tribute to French sailor Alain Colas and the titular trimaran he disappeared at sea with.

=== 1982–1991: Final years and death ===

In 1982, Gainsbourg contributed his songwriting to French rockstar Alain Bashung&#x27;s album &quot;Play blessures&quot;, which was a left turn creatively for Bashung and is often considered a cult classic despite negative contemporary reviews. His second film as a director, &quot;Équateur&quot; (1983), was adapted from the 1933 novel &quot;Tropic Moon&quot; by Belgian writer Georges Simenon and is set in colonialist French Equatorial Africa.

&quot;Love on the Beat&quot; (1984) saw Gainsbourg move on from reggae and onto a more electronic, new wave inspired sound. The album is known for addressing taboo sexual subject matters, with Gainsbourg dressed in drag on the cover and the highly controversial duet with his daughter Charlotte, &quot;Lemon Incest&quot;, which seemed to clearly refer to his fantasy of wanting to make love to his child. The music video for the song featured a half-naked Gainsbourg lying on a bed with Charlotte, leading to further controversy. Nevertheless, it was Gainsbourg&#x27;s highest-charting song in France. In March 1984, he illegally burned three-quarters of a 500-French-franc bill on television to protest against taxes rising up to 74% of income. In April 1986, on Michel Drucker&#x27;s live Saturday evening television show &quot;Champs-Élysées&quot;, with the American singer Whitney Houston, he objected to Drucker&#x27;s translating his comments to Houston and, in English, stated: &quot;I said, I want to fuck her&quot;—Drucker, utterly embarrassed, insisted that this meant &quot;He says you are great...&quot; That same year, in another talk show interview, he appeared alongside Les Rita Mitsouko singer Catherine Ringer. Gainsbourg spat out at her, &quot;You&#x27;re nothing but a filthy whore&quot; to which Ringer replied, &quot;Look at you, you&#x27;re just a bitter old alcoholic... you&#x27;ve become a disgusting old parasite.&quot;

Gainsbourg&#x27;s final partner until his death was the model Caroline Paulus, better known by her stage name Bambou. They had a son, Lucien (b. 5 January 1986), who now goes by the name Lulu and is a musician. His 1986 film &quot;Charlotte for Ever&quot; further expanded on the themes found in &quot;Lemon Incest&quot;. He starred in the film alongside Charlotte as a widowed, alcoholic father living with his daughter. An album of the same name by Charlotte was also written by Gainsbourg.

His sixteenth and final studio album, &quot;You&#x27;re Under Arrest&quot; (1987), largely retained the funky new wave sound of &quot;Love on the Beat&quot;, but also introduced hip hop elements. A return to concept albums for Gainsbourg, it tells the story of an unnamed narrator and his drug-addicted girlfriend in New York City. The album&#x27;s anti-drug message was exemplified by the single &quot;Aux enfants de la chance&quot;.

In December 1988, while a judge at a film festival in Val d&#x27;Isère, he was extremely intoxicated at a local theatre where he was to do a presentation. While on stage he began to tell an obscene story about Brigitte Bardot and a champagne bottle, only to stagger offstage and collapse in a nearby seat. Subsequent years saw his health deteriorate, undergoing liver surgery in April 1989. In his ill health, he retired to a private apartment in Vézelay in July 1990, where he would spend six months. He continued to write for other artists, including the lyrics to &quot;White and Black Blues&quot; by Joëlle Ursull, the French entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1990, coming in second place. He similarly wrote all of the lyrics for popular singer Vanessa Paradis&#x27;s album &quot;Variations sur le même t&#x27;aime&quot; (1990), declaring &quot;Paradis is hell&quot; after its release. His final film, &quot;Stan the Flasher&quot;, starred Claude Berri as an English teacher who engages in exhibitionism. Gainsbourg&#x27;s last album of original material was Birkin&#x27;s &quot;Amours des feintes&quot; in 1990.

Gainsbourg, who smoked five packs of unfiltered Gitanes cigarettes a day, died from a heart attack at his home on 2 March 1991, aged 62. He was buried in the Jewish section of the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris. French President François Mitterrand paid tribute by saying, &quot;He was our Baudelaire, our Apollinaire ... He elevated the song to the level of art.&quot; In her first interview after her father&#x27;s death, his daughter Charlotte told Vanity Fair: &quot;He was a poet. What he did was way ahead of its time. You can just read his lyrics—he plays with words in such a way that there are double meanings that don&#x27;t work out in English. He was just so very authentic. He was so shy, and very touching. And he was very generous. Every time I get into a taxi [in Paris] I hear a story about my father, because he used to take taxis all day long and [the drivers] tell me how sweet he was. One day a taxi driver told me my father had paid for his teeth to be mended; somebody else&#x27;s roof needed to be mended and he paid for that. He just had real relationships with people from the street. He was selfish in ways that artists can be, but there was no snobisme. He was always amazed at the fact that he had money. I remember going to lovely hotels with him and he was like . . . ‘Oooh, how fun this is.&#x27; He had the eyes of a child.&quot;

== Legacy and influence ==

Since his death, Gainsbourg&#x27;s music has reached legendary stature in France. In his native country, artists like the bands Air, Stereolab and BB Brunes (who named themselves after Gainsbourg&#x27;s song &quot;Initials B.B.&quot;), singers Benjamin Biolay, Vincent Delerm, Thomas Fersen and Arthur H have cited him as an influence. He has also gained a following in the English-speaking world from artists like Jarvis Cocker of Pulp, Beck, Michael Stipe of R.E.M., Alex Turner of Arctic Monkeys, Portishead, Massive Attack, Mike Patton of Faith No More and Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds guitarist Mick Harvey has recorded four cover albums sung in English and he is referenced by name in the song &quot;Aloo Gobi&quot; by American rock band Weezer. Gainsbourg&#x27;s music has been sampled by several hip hop artists, including songs by Nas, Wu-Tang Clan, Busta Rhymes and MC Solaar.

The Parisian house in which Gainsbourg lived from 1969 until 1991, at 5 bis Rue de Verneuil, remains a celebrated shrine, with his ashtrays and collections of various items, such as police badges and bullets, intact. The outside of the house is covered in graffiti dedicated to Gainsbourg, as well as with photographs of significant figures in his life, including Bardot and Birkin. In 2008, Paris&#x27;s Cité de la Musique held the &quot;Gainsbourg 2008&quot; exhibition, curated by sound artist Frédéric Sanchez.

Gainsbourg has been described as an unlikely sex symbol and fashion icon, noted for his sharp suits, white Repetto shoes, double-denim, green United States Army shirts and pinstripe jackets.

Comic artist Joann Sfar wrote and directed the biographical film of his life &quot;Gainsbourg (Vie héroïque)&quot; (2010). Gainsbourg is portrayed by Eric Elmosnino as an adult and Kacey Mottet Klein as a child. The film won three César Awards, including Best Actor for Elmosnino, and was nominated for an additional eight.

Administratively, it lies within the department of Bouches-du-Rhône (‘Mouths of the Rhône’); it spans portions of the communes of Arles, Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer and Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rhône. A further expanse of marshy plain, known as the &quot;Petite Camargue&quot; (Little Camargue), just to the west of the &quot;Petit Rhône&quot;, lies within the department of Gard.

The Camargue was designated a Ramsar site as a &quot;Wetland of International Importance&quot; on 1 December 1986. The Petite Camargue received this designation on 8 January 1996.

==Geography==
With an area of over , the Camargue is one of western Europe&#x27;s largest river deltas. It is a vast plain comprising large brine lagoons or &quot;étangs&quot;, cut off from the sea by sandbars and encircled by reed-covered marshes. These are in turn surrounded by a large cultivated area.

Approximately a third of the Camargue is either lakes or marshland. The central area around the shoreline of the Étang de Vaccarès has been protected as a regional park since 1927, in recognition of its great importance as a haven for wild birds. In 2008, it was incorporated into the larger Parc naturel régional de Camargue.

==Flora and fauna==
The Camargue is home to more than 400 species of birds and has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International. Its brine ponds provide one of the few European habitats for the greater flamingo. The marshes are also a prime habitat for many species of insects, notably (and notoriously) some of the most ferocious mosquitos to be found anywhere in France. Camargue horses (Camarguais) roam the extensive marshlands, along with Camargue cattle.

The native flora of the Camargue have adapted to the saline conditions. Sea lavender and glasswort flourish, along with tamarisks and reeds.

==Regional park==

Officially established as a regional park and nature reserve in 1970, the Parc naturel régional de Camargue covers . This territory is some of the most natural and most protected in all of Europe. A roadside museum provides background on flora, fauna, as well as the history of the area.

== Human influence ==
Humans have lived in the Camargue for millennia, greatly affecting it with drainage schemes, dykes, rice paddies and salt pans. Much of the outer Camargue has been drained for agricultural purposes.

The Camargue has an eponymous horse breed, the white Camarguais. Camargue horses are ridden by the &quot;gardians&quot; (cowboys), who rear the region&#x27;s cattle for fighting bulls for regional use and for export to Spain, as well as sheep. Many of these animals are raised in semi-feral conditions, allowed to roam through the Camargue within a manade, or free-running herd. They are periodically rounded up for culling, medical treatment, or other events.

Few towns of any size have developed in the Camargue. Arles has been called its &quot;capital&quot;, located at the extreme north of the delta where the Rhône forks into its two principal branches. The only other towns of note are along the seafront or near it: Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, which has also been dubbed its &quot;capital&quot;, about to the southwest. The medieval fortress-town of Aigues-Mortes is located on the far western edge, in the Petite Camargue. Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer is the destination of the annual Romani pilgrimage for the veneration of Saint Sarah.

The Camargue was exploited in the Middle Ages by Cistercian and Benedictine monks. In the 16th–17th centuries, big estates, known locally as &quot;mas&quot;, were founded by rich landlords from Arles. At the end of the 18th century, they had the Rhône diked to protect the town and their properties from flooding. In 1858, the building of the &quot;digue à la mer&quot; (dyke to the sea) achieved temporary protection of the delta from erosion, but it is a changing landform, always affected by waters and weather.

The north of the Camargue is agricultural land. The main crops are cereals, grapes and rice. Near the seashore, prehistoric man started extracting salt, a practice that continues today. Salt was a source of wealth for the Cistercian &quot;salt abbeys&quot; of Ulmet, Franquevaux and Psalmody in the Middle Ages. Industrial salt collection started in the 19th century, and big chemical companies such as Pechiney and Solvay founded the &quot;mining&quot; city of Salin-de-Giraud.

The boundaries of the Camargue are constantly altered by the Rhône as it transports huge quantities of mud downstream – as much as 20 million m3 annually. Some of the &quot;étangs&quot; are the remnants of old arms and legs of the river. The general trend is for the coastline to move outwards as new earth is deposited in the delta at the river&#x27;s mouth. Aigues-Mortes, originally built as a port on the coast, is now some inland. The pace of change has been modified in recent years by man-made barriers, such as dams on the Rhône and sea dykes, but flooding remains a problem across the region.

<doc id="79507" wikidata="Q296857" url="?curid=79507" title="Mausolus">
<text>Mausolus ( or , &quot;Mauśoλ&quot;) was a ruler of Caria (377–353 BCE) and a satrap of the Achaemenid Empire. He enjoyed the status of king or dynast by virtue of the powerful position created by his father Hecatomnus ( ), who was the first satrap of Caria from the hereditary Hecatomnid dynasty. Alongside Caria, Mausolus also ruled Lycia and parts of Ionia and the Dodecanese islands. He is best known for his monumental tomb and one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, the construction of which has traditionally been ascribed to his wife and sister Artemisia.

== Name ==

Mausolus&#x27; name is only known directly in Greek ( or ). It is clearly of Carian origin, though, and would have been written as *𐊪𐊠𐊲𐊸𐊫𐊦 (&quot;*Mauśoλ&quot;) or similar. This is a compound name perhaps meaning &quot;much blessed&quot;. The first part, &quot;*Ma-&quot;, may mean &quot;much&quot;, similar to the same word in Hieroglyphic Luwian. The second part, &quot;*-uśoλ&quot;, meaning &quot;blessed&quot;, is very common in Carian onomastics. Other examples include just &quot;Uśoλ&quot; (𐊲𐊸𐊫𐊦 = , &quot;blessed&quot;), &quot;Šaruśoλ&quot; (𐤭𐊠𐊥𐊲𐊸𐊫𐊦 = Σαρυσ(σ)ωλλος, &quot;highly blessed&quot;), and &quot;Pnuśoλ&quot;/&quot;Punwśoλ&quot; (𐊷𐊵𐊲𐊸𐊫𐊦/𐊷𐊲𐊵𐊿𐊸𐊫𐊦 = Πονυσσωλλος, &quot;blessed by all&quot;).

== Early life ==

Mausolus was the eldest son of Hecatomnus, a native Carian who became the satrap of Caria shortly after Tissaphernes died, BCE. Mausolus succeeded his father upon Hecatomnus&#x27; death in 377 BCE. The two may have shared the rule of Caria in the early 370s BCE, though, shortly before the death of Hecatomnus. Their close relationship is illustrated in the family scenes from the sarcophagus of the tomb of Hecatomnus and Aba. They were also depicted alongside one another in a statue group from Caunos. Whether Mausolus held any real or ceremonial office before the period of his reign proper, however, is speculative.

== Reign ==

Mausolus became satrap when his father Hecatomnus died in 377/6 BCE. He ruled alongside his wife, who was also his sister, Artemisia (known as Artemisia II to avoid confusion with the earlier Artemisia I Lygdamis). Because the two had no children, and incest of this type was not otherwise known in Caria, it is thought that their unusual marriage was entirely symbolic. Although only Mausolus was ever referred to as satrap, it is clear that Artemisia had some political authority as joint dynast while the two were still alive.

=== Revolt of the Satraps ===

Mausolus participated in the Revolt of the Satraps, a long and complex affair in which many satraps in the west of the Achaemenid Empire rebelled against Artaxerxes II Memnon, mostly during the 360s BCE. The Revolt of the Satraps, also called the Great Revolt, was not a coordinated affair, but consisted of multiple separate rebellions throughout Anatolia. Mausolus primarily participated on the side of Artaxerxes, although Greek sources say that he also briefly rebelled against him.

Diodorus Siculus includes Mausolus in his list of satraps who rebelled against Artaxerxes II. Also in this list were Tachos of Egypt, Ariobarzanes of Hellespontine Phrygia, Orontes of Mysia, Autophradates of Lydia, and miscellaneous populations of Anatolia and Phoenicia. With the majority of Anatolia, the Levant, and Egypt in revolt, Diodorus said that half of Artaxerxes&#x27; revenues were cut off from him. Another participant was King Agesilaus II of Sparta, who was a guest-friend of Mausolus.

The most evidence for Mausolus&#x27; participation in the Great Satraps&#x27; Revolt, however, is on the side of his nominal sovereign. Mausolus, together with Autophradates the satrap of Lydia, led the siege of Adramyttium in 366 BCE at the request of Artaxerxes. Ariobarzanes had taken refuge there after Autophradates had driven him out of Assos. According to Xenophon, Mausolus was allegedly persuaded to abandon the siege by Agesilaus, whom Mausolus and Tachos of Egypt provided an escort to escape safely. This may be a sign that Mausolus only defied his overlord covertly, as there is no evidence that he actually made war against Artaxerxes.

Diodorus also tells us that Mausolus and Autophradates, who secretly did not pursue Ariobarzanes, assisted Orontes of Mysia in his later rebellion in 362 BCE. Unlike Tachos or Agesilaus, however, Mausolus and Artemisia are mostly absent from narratives of Orontes&#x27; revolt, and there is no evidence that they took any concrete action against Artaxerxes II.

Mausolus was not punished for his alleged participation in the Revolt of the Satraps, unlike more flagrant rebels such as Datames or Ariobarzanes. He remained in office after the revolt was squashed in 362/1 BCE and was even rewarded by being given Lycia to govern over.

=== Lycia ===

After the Satraps&#x27; Revolt, Mausolus and Artemisia came to rule Lycia, adding this territory to the southeast of Caria to their satrapy. Lycia had first been conquered by the Achaemenids at the same time as Ionia and Caria, by Harpagus, a general under Cyrus the Great. After the time of Harpagus, however, Achaemenid presence in Lycia was minimal and contested by the Delian League. The country came to be ruled by a series of minor dynasts, such as Kuprlli and Kheriga of Xanthos, Erbbina of Telmessos, and Arppakhu of Phellos. Pericles (Lycian: 𐊓𐊁𐊕𐊆𐊋𐊍𐊁, &quot;Perikle&quot;) of Limyra, a dynast based in eastern Lycia, came to dominate all of Lycia in the 370s and 360s BCE, breaking the historical dominance of the western dynasts based in and around Xanthos. He cast himself as a native Lycian fighting for liberation against Persians in western Lycia; one inscription explicitly describes his rival Arttum̃para as a Mede (Lycian: 𐊀𐊕𐊗𐊗𐊒𐊐𐊓𐊀𐊕𐊀:𐊎𐊁𐊅𐊁, &quot;Arttum̃para mede&quot;). Arttum̃para may have been one of two Achaemenid officials in Lycia whom Pericles contested, the other being Mithrapata. By rejecting Persian rule in the 370s and 360s BCE, Pericles was participating in the Revolt of the Satraps. Pericles&#x27; domination of an independent Lycia was ended by the Autophradates, the satrap of Lydia, at the end of the great revolt . Autophradates ruled Lycia himself for as &#x27;king&#x27; and/or &#x27;satrap&#x27; (TL 61: 𐊚𐊏𐊚 𐊜𐊑𐊗𐊀𐊇𐊀𐊗𐊀 𐊇𐊀𐊗𐊀𐊓𐊕𐊅𐊅𐊀𐊗𐊁𐊛𐊁, &quot;ẽnẽ xñtawata Wataprddatehe&quot;, &quot;while Autophradates was king&quot;; TL 40d: 𐊜𐊖𐊖𐊀𐊅𐊕𐊀𐊓𐊀 𐊓𐊀[𐊕𐊈]𐊀, &quot;xssadrapa Pa[rz]a&quot;, &quot;Persian satrap&quot;). Lycia had returned to the Achaemenid control. Autophradates ruled for only a short period, though, and rule of Lycia was transferred to Mausolus sometime in the period BCE.

Mausolus ruled Lycia as satrap in the later part of his reign. From this time onwards, independent Lycian coins were no longer struck, and instead coins of Mausolus and his successors circulated in Lycia. Although he did not conquer Lycia, he may have been militarily active there, as Stephanus of Byzantium tells us that he campaigned in Milyas to the north of Lycia. How Mausolus and Artemisia governed Lycia is not clear. The Pseudo-Aristotelian &quot;Economics&quot; records that Mausolus had a hyparch (ὕπαρχος, &#x27;deputy&#x27;) active in Lycia, although this account is far from trustworthy. A later trilingual inscription shows that their brother Pixodarus had garrison-commanders in Lycia (), which may have been true in Mausolus&#x27; time as well.

Mausolus and Artemisia made an alliance with Phaselis, a city at the eastern border of Lycia with Pamphilia, showing the extent of their domain. Theodectes of Phaselis, a tragic poet, wrote a play called &quot;Mausolus&quot; to honour the satrap at his funeral.

=== Social War ===
Mausolus and Artemisia cooperated with the rebels against Athens in the Social War (357355 BCE), by which they helped to extend their authority among the Greek islands and cities neighbouring Caria.

After the Peace of Antalcidas concluded the Corinthian War in 387 BCE, Artaxerxes II had given control of the Greek cities of Anatolia to his satraps, while guaranteeing the independence of the Greek off the coast of Anatolia. King Agesilaus II of Sparta was deputised to enforce this peace among the Greeks. The Athenians subsequently formed what is called the Second Athenian League (in contrast to the earlier Delian League) as a counterbalance to Spartan hegemony. Among the Greek communities which founded this alliance in 378 BCE were Rhodes, Chios, and Byzantium. All three rebelled against Athens in 357 BCE, after the Athenians had begun to collect financial contributions (&quot;syntaxeis&quot;) from their allies and established an aggressive colony (a &quot;cleruchy&quot;) on Samos in the 360s BCE.

Demosthenes described the outbreak of the Social War is his speech On the Liberty of the Rhodians: &quot;We were charged by the Chians, Byzantines and Rhodians with plotting against them, and that was why they concerted the last war against us; but ... Mausolus [was] the prime mover and instigator in the business&quot;. In this speech, our main source for Carian involvement in the Social War, Demosthenes makes clear that Mausolus and Artemisia supported the rebels in naval warfare against Athens. Although the precise causes of the Social War are obscure, it may be the case that Mausolus himself incited it in order to expand his sphere of influence into the neighbouring Greek islands of the Dodecanese.

The Social War ended quickly in 355 BCE. The Athenians were already weakened after Philip II of Macedon captured Amphipolis; they suffered several naval defeats to the rebels, such as at the Battle of Ecbatana; and the city was nearly bankrupt. The intervention of Artaxerxes III set the terms of the peace. Either during or shortly after the Social War, the Carian satraps controlled the Greek islands of Rhodes, Cos, and Chios, in part because they had undermined Athenian authority in the region.

Rhodes, which had previously been governed by a democracy aligned with Athens, came to be ruled instead by an oligarchy backed by a Carian garrison. Vitruvius relates a story about how, when Mausolus died shortly after the end of the Social War, the Rhodian democrats briefly overthrew their Hecatomnid-aligned oligarchy and unsuccessfully rebelled against Artemisia.

Mausolus also invaded parts of Ionia and controlled other 
at undetermined points in his reign. As well as their new capital at Halicarnassus, Mausolus and Artemisia had considerable control over the other Greek cities on the coast of Caria, such as Iasos, Miletus, and Cnidus. Part of this control had diplomatic elements. For example, the astronomer Eudoxus of Cnidus, who developed a cosmic model of concentric spheres, lived at the court of Mausolus and may have helped steer the politics of Cnidus as the satrap wished. Mausolus&#x27; rule was enforced by violence, though. Polyaenus reports that Mausolus had deputised his brother Idrieus to capture the fortified town of Latmus; later, he pretended to return the Latmian hostages which Idrieus had captured, and after winning the trust of the townspeople, ambushing the city at night after all the inhabitants had left its walls to watch his military procession. Separately, the same author writes how Mausolus&#x27; sister and wife Artemisia captured the same town by a similar deception, distracting the Latmians with a religious procession of women, eunuchs, and musicians, instead of soldiers.

=== Tyrannical reputation ===

Mausolus was not beloved by all his subjects. Mausolus appears as a stereotypical despot or tyrant in the accounts of contemporary Greeks. The &quot;Economics&quot; attributed to Aristotle tells many stories about the injustice of his rule, in part because he needed to raise funds to pay tribute to the Achaemenid Great King. He supposedly deceived the people of Mylasa by telling them that Artaxerxes II Memnon was about to attack the unwalled city; after the local elites gave much money to Mausolus so that he could build walls for Mylasa, he told them that omens prevented him from providing anything. The city was not attacked and Mausolus kept his citizens&#x27; funds. Polyaenus tells a similar story about how he lied to his subjects that Artaxerxes threatened to take dominion; he showed them his treasures, which he would sell to keep it, and so his subjects willingly gave him an immense amount of goods, ignorant of his deception.

Mausolus&#x27; hyparch Condalos was also authoritarian, according to the &quot;Economics&quot;. While collecting money for Mausolus, Condalos noted that the people of Lycia wore their hair long, unlike the Carians. He told his Lycian subjects that Artaxerxes demanded hair to make wigs (προκομία) for his horses. Mausolus therefore demanded that the Lycians shave their heads and send him their hair. If the Lycians did not want to shave their heads, they could pay their Carian governors in money instead of hair, and Mausolus could buy hair from the Greeks instead. The entire thing was a sham. No hair was sent anywhere, but Condalos and Mausolus made a lot of money.

Not all of Mausolus&#x27; subjects accepted his authoritarian rule easily. A series of inscriptions from Iasos and Mylasa record how Mausolus punished nobles who conspired against him. The most dramatic is from 355/4 BCE, late in Mausolus&#x27; reign, when he survived an assassination attempt by disaffected subjects during the royal procession at the yearly festival at Labraunda. A similar plot had been thwarted in Mylasa over a decade earlier (367/6 BCE). Alongside these attempts on Mausolus&#x27; life, he also punished a group of brothers who conspired to desecrate a statue of his father Hekatomnos in Mylasa (361/0 BCE). These same brothers were celebrated in Iasos, where the city granted them proxeny around this time, perhaps in defiance of Mausolus. Nonetheless, Iasos still punished a series of unknown conspirators against Mausolus in the 360s BCE, putting their property to auction.

== Building projects ==

Mausolus and Artemisia moved their capital from Mylasa to Halicarnassus early in their reign. Halicarnassus had historically been a Greek colony with a sizeable native population of Carians and Leleges. The city was refounded by Mausolus, being rebuilt on a new grid pattern. Its population was enlarged through a process of synoecism: residents of Carian villages nearby were relocated to the new capital city. Pliny the Elder, who incorrectly attributed the synoecism to Alexander the Great, lists the villages assimilated into Halicarnassus as Theangela, Sibde, Medmasa, Euralium, Pedasus, and Telmissus.

The city of Halicarnassus, newly rebuilt by Mausolus and Artemisia, had a number of Greek features, including a large theatre and agora. New city walls expanded into harbour fortifications, turning Halicarnassus into the primary port of the Hecatomnid navy. The Hecatomnids built themselves a palace on the promontory of Zephyrion, next to the older Temple of Apollo, which has since been built over by the medieval Castle of St Peter.

The synoecism of Halicarnassus may have been inspired by the earlier synoecism of Rhodes, when the three major Greek cities of the island (Ialysus, Camirus, and Lindus) came together the found the city of Rhodes as their capital in . Rhodes and Halicarnassus had close ties. Both claimed mythic Dorian ancestry (although the people of Halicarnassus spoke Ionian Greek) and both cities were allied within the Doric Hexapolis in the Archaic period.

Another former island member of the Doric Hexapolis, Cos, underwent synoecism shortly after Halicarnassus. This similar synoecism of Cos may have been politically induced by Mausolus — especially because Demosthenes said that Idrieus controlled Cos while he was satrap — although the evidence is inconclusive. Other cities and towns which may have been relocated or rebuilt by Mausolus or his family include Latmus (which became Heraclea at Latmus), Cnidus (which moved from Datça to Tekir around this time), and Priene (which may instead have been relocated by Alexander the Great after the time of Mausolus).

As well as cities, Mausolus rebuilt major Carian religious sanctuaries at Amyzon, Labraunda, and Sinuri. All three were located in the Carian mountains, away from major urban centres. Religious activity included annual processions up the mountain to the new monumental temples at these sanctuaries. Investment at Labraunda by both Mausolus and his brother Idrieus was especially intensive; the annual procession to Labraunda from Mylasa became a centrepiece of the Hecatomnid royal cult.

=== &#x27;Hellenisation&#x27; and the Ionian Renaissance ===

Mausolus embraced Hellenic culture to an extent. It is debated whether Caria underwent &quot;Hellenisation&quot;, &quot;Carianisation&quot;, or a complex combination of the two (e.g. creolisation), under his watch.

All the original construction at Halicarnassus was distinctive of the so-called Ionian Renaissance, which the Hecatomnids sponsored throughout their territories, and which continued in the early Hellenistic Period at sites such as Priene. Many cities and religious centres in and around Caria bear features of the Ionian Renaissance following direct sponsorship by Mausolus and his family.

=== Mausoleum at Halicarnassus ===

Mausolus is best known by his monumental tomb: the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Tradition maintains that it was erected and named for him by order of his wife and sister Artemisia after his death. The tomb was only finished after her death. It is likely that construction began while Mausolus was still alive, and that he oversaw it alongside Artemisia.

The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was emblematic of the Ionian Renaissance, combining Greek architectural styles with those of Anatolian structures such as the Nereid Monument at Xanthos in Lycia. The leading craftsmen who designed and built the Mausoleum included famous Greeks and Carians: the architects Satyrus and Pythis, and the sculptors Scopas of Paros, Leochares, Bryaxis and Timotheus. The tomb of Hecatomnus in the centre of Mylasa has been considered an unfinished &#x27;proto-Mausoleum&#x27;, having a similar terrace structure but lacking similar above-ground elements.

The tomb was famous even in antiquity. Although the Mausoleum () was named for Mausolus, the term &quot;mausoleum&quot; has come to be used generically for any grand above-ground tomb. This was true in antiquity; Martial used the term in reference to the Mausoleum of Augustus (died AD 14). Antipater of Sidon listed the Mausoleum as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

The site of the Mausoleum and a few remains can still be seen in the Turkish town of Bodrum (ancient Halicarnassus). The majority of surviving sculptural elements are now kept in the British Museum, where they were taken by Charles Thomas Newton in the 1850s. Modern excavations of the site of the Mausoleum, as with other archaeological features of ancient Halicarnassus at Bodrum, have been led by the Danish Archaeological Project in conjunction with the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology.

== Death ==

Mausolus died shortly after the failed assassination attempt at Labraunda. Diodorus Siculus tells us that he died in 353/2 BCE. Modern consensus agrees with this date, in part because Mausolus was known to have participated in the Social War (357–355 BCE), but had died by the time Demosthenes wrote his speech &quot;On the Liberty of the Rhodians&quot; (351 BCE). Pliny the Elder incorrectly claimed that Mausolus died in 351 BCE, which is when his sister and wife Artemisia passed away. It is unknown what he died of.

When Mausolus died, his remains were interred in the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, which he and Artemisia had been building while they were still alive. It is likely that the Mausoleum functioned as a heroön and that Mausolus received cult worship after his death. Archaeological evidence suggests that worship of Mausolus continued until approximately the mid-2nd century BCE.

Artemisia threw a lavish funeral for Mausolus, including games and ceremonies, in which many distinguished Greeks participated. Many of were students of Isocrates who themselves were from Greek cities within the Hecatomnid sphere of influence. Theopompus of Chios won the prose competition, defeating Isocrates. This may have been Isocrates of Apollonia, rather than the more famous Isocrates of Athens, who would have been very old at the time. Theodectes of Phaselis won the verse competition with a tragic play entitled &quot;Mausolus&quot;. This coming together of famous and influential Greeks at Halicarnassus on the occasion of Mausolus&#x27; death, overseen by Artemisia, may be why she became so renowned for her grief in later tradition.

Mausolus and Artemisia had no children. After he died, his sister-wife Artemisia ruled alone for a short period before she herself died (353351 BCE). She was then succeeded by her brother and sister Idrieus and Ada, who were themselves married. There is no evidence that Artemisia was ever formally a satrap of the Achaemenid Empire, rather than just a local dynast. Only the men of the Hekatomnid family were ever referred to as satraps, as far as we know. So, although Artemisia succeeded Mausolus in real terms, his successor to the office of satrap was probably his brother Idrieus.

Centuries after the death of Mausolus, Lucian of Samosata wrote a dialogue between the deceased satrap and the philosopher Diogenes the Cynic, conversing in the afterlife. Although Mausolus ruled widely as satrap, was rich in his lifetime, and left behind a magnificent tomb in Halicarnassus, Diogenes taunts him, as they both have nothing after their deaths.

<doc id="79508" wikidata="Q1713011" url="?curid=79508" title="List of newspapers in the United Kingdom">
<text>Twelve daily newspapers and eleven Sunday-only weekly newspapers are distributed nationally in the United Kingdom. Others circulate in Scotland only and still others serve smaller areas. National daily newspapers publish every day except Sundays and 25 December. Sunday newspapers may be independent; e.g. &quot;The Observer&quot; was an independent Sunday newspaper from its founding in 1791 until it was acquired by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1993, but more commonly, they have the same owners as one of the daily newspapers, usually with a related name (e.g. &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;), but are editorially distinct.

UK newspapers can generally be split into two distinct categories: the more serious and intellectual newspapers, usually referred to as the broadsheets, and sometimes known collectively as the &quot;quality press&quot;, and others, generally known as tabloids, and collectively as the &#x27;popular press&#x27;, which have tended to focus more on celebrity coverage and human interest stories rather than political reporting or overseas news. The tabloids in turn have been divided into the more sensationalist mass market titles, or &#x27;red tops&#x27;, such as &quot;The Sun&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, and the middle-market papers, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

Most of the broadsheets, so called because of their historically larger size, have changed in recent years to a compact format, the same size as the tabloids. &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; were the first to do so. &quot;The Guardian&quot; moved in September 2005 to what is described as a &#x27;Berliner&#x27; format, slightly larger than a compact. Its Sunday stablemate &quot;The Observer&quot; followed suit. Both &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; now use the tabloid format, having done so since January 2018. Despite these format changes, these newspapers are all still considered &#x27;broadsheets&#x27;.

Other Sunday broadsheets, including &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, which tend to have a large amount of supplementary sections, have kept their larger-sized format. The national Sunday titles usually have a different layout and style from their weekday sister papers, and are produced by separate journalistic and editorial staff. All the major UK newspapers currently have websites, some of which provide free access. 

&quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; have a paywall requiring payment on a per-day or per-month basis by non-subscribers. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; business daily also has limited access for non-subscribers. &quot;The Independent&quot; became available online only upon its last printed edition on 26 March 2016. However, unlike the previously mentioned newspapers, it does not require any payment to access its news content. Instead the newspaper offers extras for those wishing to sign up to a payment subscription, such as crosswords, Sudoku puzzles, weekend supplements and the ability to automatically download each daily edition to read offline. &quot;The London Economic&quot; is another example of a British digital/online only newspaper; however, unlike &quot;The Independent&quot; it has never run a print publication.

Most towns and cities in the UK have at least one local newspaper, such as the &quot;Evening Post&quot; in Bristol and &quot;The Echo&quot; in Cardiff. Local newspapers were listed in advertising guides such as the Mitchell&#x27;s Press Directories.

They are not known nationally for their journalism in the way that (despite much syndication) some city-based newspapers in the USA are (e.g. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;). An exception to this was the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, which dropped the &#x27;Manchester&#x27; from its name in 1959 and relocated its main operations to London in 1964. The Guardian Media Group produced a Mancunian paper, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, until 2010 when along with its other local newspapers in the Greater Manchester area it was sold to Trinity Mirror.

===Papurau Bro===
Papurau Bro (&#x27;Area Papers&#x27;) are Welsh language newspapers produced nominally monthly (typically 10 issues a year with a summer break) which cover the news in a small area - a town, group of parishes, one or a few valleys, etc. - with a circulation of perhaps a few thousand each. There are between 50 and 60 Papurau Bro which cover the whole of Wales, plus the Welsh communities of Liverpool and London. Papers are frequently named after local features, connections, crafts, etc., or in dialect (; all imply &#x27;gossip&#x27;). The first papur bro (&quot;Y Dinesydd&quot;) appeared in 1973 in Cardiff, and the following decade saw the establishment of most of the others. Much of the work of producing the papers is done voluntarily (aside from the printing), although financial support is given by Bwrdd yr Iaith (Welsh Language Board). Some of the papers listed may have ceased publication.

<text>An oratorio () is a musical composition with dramatic or narrative text for choir, soloists and orchestra or other ensemble.

Similar to opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an instrumental ensemble, various distinguishable characters (e.g. soloists), and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, and typically involves significant theatrical spectacle, including sets, props, and costuming, as well as staged interactions between characters. In oratorio, there is generally minimal staging, with the chorus often assuming a more central dramatic role, and the work is typically presented as a concert piece – though oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are not infrequently presented in concert form. 

A particularly important difference between opera and oratorio is in the typical subject matter of the text. An opera libretto may deal with any conceivable dramatic subject (e.g. history, mythology, Richard Nixon, Anna Nicole Smith and the Bible); the text of an oratorio often deals with sacred subjects, making it appropriate for performance in the church, which remains an important performance context for the genre. Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints and stories from the Bible. Protestant composers also often looked to Biblical topics, but sometimes looked to the lives of notable religious figures, such as Carl Loewe&#x27;s &quot;Jan Hus&quot;, an oratorio about the early reformer, Jan Hus. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church&#x27;s prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that annual period for opera audiences.

Conventionally, oratorio implies the sincere religious treatment of sacred subjects, such that non-sacred oratorio is generally qualified as &#x27;secular oratorio&#x27;: a piece of terminology that would, in some historical contexts, have been regarded as oxymoronic, or at least paradoxical, and viewed with a degree of scare-quoted skepticism. Despite this enduring and implicit context, oratorio on secular subjects has been written from the genre&#x27;s origins.

==History==

===Etymology===
The word &quot;oratorio&quot; comes from the Latin verb &quot;ōrō&quot; (present infinitive &quot;ōrāre&quot;), meaning to orate or speak publicly, to pray, or to beg or plead, related to the Attic Greek noun ἀρά (&quot;ará&quot;, “prayer”). (Hence the disambiguation entry for &#x27;oratory&#x27;, including oratory (worship).) The musical composition was &quot;named from the kind of musical services held in the church of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri in Rome (&quot;Congregazione dell&#x27;Oratorio&quot;) in the latter half of the 16th cent.&quot; The word is only attested in English from 1727, with the equivalent &#x27;oratory&#x27; in prior use, from 1640.

===Origins===
Although medieval plays such as the Ludus Danielis and Renaissance dialogue motets such as those of the Oltremontani had characteristics of an oratorio, the first oratorio is usually seen as Emilio de Cavalieri&#x27;s &quot;Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo&quot; (1600). Monteverdi composed &quot;Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda&quot; (1624) which can be considered as the first secular oratorio.

The origins of the oratorio can be found in sacred dialogues in Italy. These were settings of Biblical, Latin texts and musically were quite similar to motets. There was a strong narrative, dramatic emphasis and there were conversational exchanges between characters in the work. Giovanni Francesco Anerio&#x27;s &quot;Teatro harmonico spirituale&quot; (1619) is a set of 14 dialogues, the longest of which is 20 minutes long and covers the conversion of St. Paul and is for four soloists: Historicus (narrator), tenor; St. Paul, tenor; Voice from Heaven, bass; and Ananias, tenor. There is also a four-part chorus to represent any crowds in the drama. The music is often contrapuntal and madrigal-like.
Philip Neri&#x27;s Congregazione dell&#x27;Oratorio featured the singing of spiritual laude. These became more and more popular and were eventually performed in specially built oratories (prayer halls) by professional musicians. Again, these were chiefly based on dramatic and narrative elements.
Sacred opera provided another impetus for dialogues, and they greatly expanded in length (although never really beyond 60 minutes long). Cavalieri&#x27;s &quot;Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo&quot; is an example of one of these works, but technically it is not an oratorio because it features acting and dancing. It does, however contain music in the monodic style.
The first oratorio to be called by that name is Pietro della Valle&#x27;s &quot;Oratorio della Purificazione&quot;, but due to its brevity (only 12 minutes long) and the fact that its other name was &quot;dialogue&quot;, we can see that there was much ambiguity in these names.

===1650–1700===
During the second half of the 17th century, there were trends toward the performance of the religious oratorio also outside church halls in courts and public theaters. The theme of an oratorio is meant to be weighty. It could include such topics as Creation, the life of Jesus, or the career of a classical hero or Biblical prophet. Other changes eventually took place as well, possibly because most composers of oratorios were also popular composers of operas. They began to publish the librettos of their oratorios as they did for their operas. Strong emphasis was soon placed on arias while the use of the choir diminished. Female singers became regularly employed, and replaced the male narrator with the use of recitatives.

By the mid-17th century, two types had developed:

* &quot;oratorio latino&quot; (in Latin) – first developed at the Oratorio del Santissimo Crocifisso, related to the church of San Marcello al Corso in Rome.

The most significant composers of &quot;oratorio latino&quot; were in Italy Giacomo Carissimi, whose &quot;Jephte&quot; is regarded as the first masterpiece of the genre (like most other Latin oratorios of the period, it is in one section only), and in France Carissimi&#x27;s pupil Marc-Antoine Charpentier (34 works H.391 - H.425).

* &quot;oratorio volgare&quot; (in Italian) – representative examples include:
** Giacomo Carissimi&#x27;s &quot;Daniele&quot;
** Marco Marazzoli&#x27;s &quot;S Tomaso&quot;
** similar works written by Francesco Foggia, Luigi Rossi, Alessandro Stradella

Lasting about 30–60 minutes, &quot;oratori volgari&quot; were performed in two sections, separated by a sermon; their music resembles that of contemporary operas and chamber cantatas.

===Late baroque===
In the late baroque period oratorios increasingly became &quot;sacred opera&quot;. In Rome and Naples Alessandro Scarlatti was the most noted composer. In Vienna the court poet Metastasio produced annually a series of oratorios for the court which were set by Caldara, Hasse and others. Metastasio&#x27;s best known oratorio libretto &quot;La passione di Gesù Cristo&quot; was set by at least 35 composers from 1730 to 1790. In Germany the middle baroque oratorios moved from the early-baroque &quot;Historia&quot; style Christmas and Resurrection settings of Heinrich Schütz, to the Passions of J. S. Bach, oratorio-passions such as &quot;Der Tod Jesu&quot; set by Telemann and Carl Heinrich Graun. After Telemann came the galante oratorio style of C. P. E. Bach.

===Georgian Britain===

The Georgian era saw a German-born monarch and German-born composer define the English oratorio. George Frideric Handel, most famous today for his &quot;Messiah&quot; (1741), also wrote other oratorios based on themes from Greek and Roman mythology and Biblical topics. He is also credited with writing the first English language oratorio, &quot;Esther&quot;. Handel&#x27;s imitators included the Italian Lidarti who was employed by the Amsterdam Jewish community to compose a Hebrew version of &quot;Esther&quot;.

Joseph Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Creation&quot; (1798) and &quot;The Seasons&quot; (1801) have remained the most widely known oratorios from the period of classicism. While the first of these Händel inspired works draws from the religious theme of creation, the second is more secular, containing songs about industry, hunting and wine.

===Victorian era===
Britain continued to look to Germany for its composers of oratorio. The Birmingham Festival commissioned various oratorios including Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot; in 1846, later performed in German as &quot;Elias&quot;. German composer Georg Vierling is noted for modernizing the secular oratorio form.

John Stainer&#x27;s &quot;The Crucifixion&quot; (1887) became the stereotypical battlehorse of massed amateur choral societies. Edward Elgar tried to revive the genre around the turn of century with the composition of &quot;The Light of Life (Lux Christi)&quot;, &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, &quot;The Apostles&quot; and &quot;The Kingdom&quot;.

===20th century===
Oratorio returned haltingly to public attention with Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; in Paris (1927), William Walton&#x27;s &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; in Leeds (1931), Paul Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Das Unaufhörliche&quot; in Berlin (1931), Arthur Honegger&#x27;s &quot;Le Roi David&quot; and &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc au bûcher&quot; in Basel (1938), and Franz Schmidt&#x27;s &quot;The Book with Seven Seals&quot; (&quot;Das Buch mit sieben Siegeln&quot;) in Vienna (1938). Michael Tippett&#x27;s oratorio &quot;A Child of Our Time&quot; (first performance, 1944) engages with events surrounding the Second World War. Postwar oratorios include Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;Song of the Forests&quot; (1949), Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;On Guard for Peace&quot; (1950), Vadim Salmanov&#x27;s &quot;Twelve&quot; (1957), Alfred Schnittke&#x27;s &quot;Nagasaki&quot; (1958), Bohuslav Martinů&#x27;s &quot;The Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; (1958), Krzysztof Penderecki&#x27;s &quot;St. Luke Passion&quot; (1966), Hans Werner Henze&#x27;s &quot;Das Floß der Medusa&quot; (1968), René Clemencic&#x27;s &quot;Kabbala&quot; (1992), and Osvaldo Golijov&#x27;s &quot;La Pasión según San Marcos&quot; (2000). Mauricio Kagel composed &quot;Sankt-Bach-Passion&quot;, an oratorio about Bach&#x27;s life, for the tercentenary of his birth in 1985.

Oratorios by popular musicians include Léo Ferré&#x27;s &quot;La Chanson du mal-aimé&quot; (1954 and 1972), based on Guillaume Apollinaire&#x27;s poem of the same name, Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Liverpool Oratorio&quot; (1991), and Mikis Theodorakis&#x27;s &quot;Canto General&quot; and Axion Esti, based on poems of Pablo Neruda and Odusseas Elytis.

===21st century===
When Dudley Buck composed his oratorio &quot;The Light of Asia&quot; in 1886, it became the first in the history of the genre to be based on the life of Buddha. Several late 20th and early 21st-century oratorios have since been based on Buddha&#x27;s life or have incorporated Buddhist texts. These include Somei Satoh&#x27;s 1987 &quot;Stabat Mater&quot;, Dinesh Subasinghe&#x27;s 2010 &quot;Karuna Nadee&quot;, and Jonathan Harvey&#x27;s 2011 &quot;Weltethos&quot;. The 21st century also saw a continuation of Christianity-based oratorios with John Adams&#x27;s &quot;El Niño&quot; and &quot;The Gospel According to the Other Mary&quot;. Other religions represented include Ilaiyaraaja&#x27;s &quot;Thiruvasakam&quot; (based on the texts of Hindu hymns to Shiva). Secular oratorios composed in the 21st century include Nathan Currier&#x27;s &quot;Gaian Variations&quot; (based on the Gaia hypothesis), Richard Einhorn&#x27;s &quot;The Origin&quot; (based on the writings of Charles Darwin), Jonathan Mills&#x27; &quot;Sandakan Threnody&quot; (based on the Sandakan Death Marches), Neil Hannon&#x27;s &quot;To Our Fathers in Distress&quot;, and David Lang&#x27;s The Little Match Girl Passion (2008). The oratorio &quot;Laudato si&#x27;&quot;, composed in 2016 by Peter Reulein on a libretto by Helmut Schlegel, includes the full Latin text of the Magnificat, expanded by writings of Clare of Assisi, Francis of Assisi and Pope Francis. &quot;Bruder Martin&quot; was composed by Thomas Gabriel, setting a text by Eugen Eckert about scenes from the life of Martin Luther, for the 500th anniversary of the Reformation in 2017. In 2017, Jörg Widmann&#x27;s oratorio ARCHE premiered. A transfer of sacrality to secular contexts takes place.

<doc id="79517" wikidata="Q452225" url="?curid=79517" title="Eunomius of Cyzicus">
<text>Eunomius () (died c. 393 AD), one of the leaders of the extreme or &quot;anomoean&quot; Arians, who are sometimes accordingly called Eunomians, was born at Dacora in Cappadocia or at Corniaspa in Pontus. early in the 4th century.

He studied theology at Alexandria under Aetius, and afterwards came under the influence of Eudoxius of Antioch, who ordained him deacon. On the recommendation of Eudoxius, Eunomius was appointed bishop of Cyzicus in 360. Here his free utterance of extreme Arian views led to popular complaints, including those from a number of contemporary writers such as Andronicianus. Eudoxius was compelled, by command of the emperor, Constantius II, to depose Eunomius from the bishopric within a year of his elevation to it.

During the reigns of Julian and Jovian, Eunomius resided in Constantinople in close intercourse with Aetius, consolidating a dissenting party and consecrating bishops. He then went to live at Chalcedon, whence in 367 he was banished to Mauretania for harbouring the rebel Procopius. He was recalled, however, before he reached his destination.

In 383, the emperor Theodosius, who had demanded a declaration of faith from all party leaders, punished Eunomius for continuing to teach his distinctive doctrines, by banishing him to Halmyris in Scythia Minor. He afterwards resided at Chalcedon and at Caesarea in Cappadocia, from which he was expelled by the inhabitants for writing against their bishop Basil. His last days were spent at his birthplace Dacora, where he died about 393.

His writings were held in high reputation by his party and their influence was so much dreaded by the orthodox, that several imperial edicts were issued for their destruction. Consequently, his commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, mentioned by the historian, Socrates Scholasticus and his epistles, mentioned by Philostorgius and Photius, are no longer extant.

His first apologetical work, written probably about 360 or 365, was entirely recovered from the famous refutation of it by Basil of Caesarea. A second apology, written before 379 exists only in the quotations given from it in a refutation by Gregory of Nyssa. The exposition of faith, called forth by the demand of Theodosius for the &quot;council of heresies&quot; in 383, is still extant, and was edited by Valesius in his notes to Socrates of Constantinople, and by Ch. H. G. Rettberg in his &quot;Marcelliana&quot;.

The teaching of the Anomoean school, led by Aetius and Eunomius, starting from the conception of God as Creator, argued that between the Creator and created there could be no essential, but at best only a moral, resemblance. &quot;As the Unbegotten, God is an absolutely simple being; an act of generation would involve a contradiction of His essence by introducing duality into the Godhead.&quot; According to Socrates of Constantinople (24) and Theodoretos Kyrou (PG 83 420), Eunomius carried his views to a practical issue by altering the baptismal formula. Instead of baptizing in the name of the Trinity by immersing the person in water thrice, he baptized in the death of Christ with only one immersion. This alteration was regarded by the orthodox as so serious that Eunomians on returning to the church were rebaptized, though the Arians were not. The Eunomian heresy was formally condemned by the Council of Constantinople in 381. The sect maintained a separate existence for some time, but gradually fell away owing to internal divisions.

After Eunomius died, Eutropius ordered that Eunomius&#x27;s body be moved to Tyana and his books be burned.

<doc id="79522" wikidata="Q728636" url="?curid=79522" title="Himalayan tahr">
<text>The Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus) is a large even-toed ungulate native to the Himalayas in southern Tibet, northern India, western Bhutan and Nepal. It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, as the population is declining due to hunting and habitat loss.

The Himalayan tahr has been introduced to Argentina, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States.

== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==
Tahr belong to the subfamily Caprinae in the order Artiodactyla. Their closest relatives in the subfamily Caprinae are sheep and goats.
A subspecies, the Eastern Himalayan tahr or shapi, was described in 1944. This classification is not considered valid anymore, and no subspecies are currently recognized.

A recent phylogenetic analysis indicates that the genus &quot;Hemitragus&quot; is monospecific, and that the Himalayan tahr is a wild goat.

== Etymology==
The word &quot;tahr,&quot; first used in English writings in 1835, is derived from the animal&#x27;s local name in the Western Himalayas, which has otherwise been rendered as &quot;tehr,&quot; &quot;tare&quot; and &quot;tahir&quot;. Through confusion with &quot;thār&quot;, a Nepali word for the Himalayan serow, it has also been spelled &quot;thar.&quot;

The genus name &quot;Hemitragus&quot; is derived from the Greek words &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;half&quot; and &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;goat&quot;.

== Characteristics==

The Himalayan tahr has a small head, small pointed ears, large eyes, and horns that vary between males and females. Their horns reach a maximum length of . Himalayan tahrs are sexually dimorphic, with females being smaller in weight and in size and having smaller horns. The horn is curved backwards, preventing injury during mating season when headbutting is a common mating ritual among males. The average male tahr usually weighs around , with females averaging and is shorter in height than in length. The exterior of a tahr is well adapted to the harsh climate of the Himalayans. They sport thick, reddish wool coats and thick undercoats, indicative of the conditions of their habitat. Their coats thin with the end of winter and becomes lighter in color.

As a member of the ungulate group of mammals, the Himalayan tahr possesses an even number of toes. They have adapted the unique ability to grasp both smooth and rough surfaces that are typical of the mountainous terrain on which they reside. This useful characteristic also helps their mobility. The hooves of the tahr have a rubber-like core which allows for gripping smooth rocks while keratin at the rim of their hooves allow increased hoof durability, which is important for traversing the rocky ground. This adaptation allows for confident and swift maneuvering of the terrain.

The lifespan of a Himalayan tahr typically ranges around 14 or 15 years, with females living longer than males. The oldest known Himalayan tahr lived to 22 years old in captivity.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

The Himalayan tahr is adapted to life in a cool climate with rocky terrain, which allows them to be found in mountainous areas. In the Himalayas, they are mainly found on slopes ranging from 2,500 to 5,000 m. Himalayan tahr can eat a wide variety of plants. They most often inhabit locations where vegetation is exposed for browsing and grazing. During the winter (when snow covers vegetation at higher elevations), they are found on lower-altitude slopes.

=== Diet ===
The Himalayan tahr is a herbivore spending most of the time grazing on grasses and browsing on leaves and some fruits. Its short legs allow it to balance while reaching for the leaves of shrubs and small trees. The tahr consumes more woody plants than herb species with as much as 75% of its diet consisting of natural grasses.

=== Predation ===
Tahr are preyed upon by snow leopards.

=== Reproduction ===
Tahrs are polygynous, and males are subject to stiff competition for access to females. Young reproductive males roam and mate opportunistically (when larger males are not present), while more mature males (more than four years old) will engage in ritualistic behavior and fighting to secure mates. During mating season, reproductive males lose much of their fat reserves, while females and nonreproductive males do not, indicating a substantial cost to these behaviors. Factors that contribute to which males dominate include size, weight, and testosterone levels. Coat color can have an effect; Himalayan tahrs with lighter coats are more likely to gain access to estrous females 
Himalayan tahrs have precocious young which can stand soon after birth. Females have a gestation period of 180–242 days, usually with a litter size of only one kid. This indicates sexual selection can be extremely important to the fitness of males.

=== Intraspecific competition ===

During the rut, male Himalayan tahrs often compete with other males for access to females. Factors that contribute to reproductive success include large body size, large horn size, and high aggression. Coat color is a factor that determines rank among Himalayan tahrs, and males with light coats mate more often. In addition, the horns of the male are often used in the ritual process to court female tahrs (either for display purposes or, less often, for direct combat), although these horns can also serve as a defense mechanisms against potential predators.

=== Interspecific competition ===

Other ungulate herbivores with overlapping natural ranges include bharal, argali, and goral. Removal experiments (in which one of the hypothesized competitors is removed, and the effect on the other species is observed) have not been conducted to determine empirically that competition is actually occurring, but the animals do share food resources. Competition can occur when two or more species share a limited resource, such as particular food sources, in a given area. Since the Himalayan tahr and the other ungulates are eating the same foods, competition possibly is occurring among them.

== Introduction as an invasive species ==
A key factor contributing to the success of the Himalayan tahr as an invasive species is their mobility. During the night, they move to locations with lower elevations to have better access to resources such as food and water, whereas during the day, they move to locations with higher elevation to rest and avoid predators. This mobile behavior not only allows them to seek refuge from predators, but also allows them to have access to resources over a large area.

Another key characteristic that allows Himalayan tahr to be successful as an invasive species is their digestive tract. Their digestive system allows them to consume a wide variety of vegetation ranging from easy-to-digest leaves/grasses to woody shrubs and other “tough” vegetation not as easily digested by other species. This flexibility in diet not only allows Himalayan tahr to have a competitive advantage for resource use in their environment among other species, but it also allows them to be less hindered by abiotic disruptions and other natural disasters. In other words, their ability to digest a large range of vegetation allows the Himalayan tahr to have a bigger fundamental niche, and as a result, increases their success as an invasive species.

Lastly, the Himalayan tahr lacks predators in the regions where it has been introduced, so is only limited by access to food and water, and its own reproductive rate.

=== Argentina ===
The tahr was introduced into Argentina in 2006 by private individuals, presumably for hunting purposes. The importation has been deemed successful, but it is too soon to determine whether it will be detrimental to the environment. The IUCN lists the tahr as being possibly extirpated from Argentina despite its introduction.

=== New Zealand ===
Himalayan tahr were introduced to New Zealand in 1904 around the Mount Cook region for sport and have since expanded rapidly into neighboring areas. Their heavy grazing of native plants in New Zealand has caused significant environmental damage. They currently inhabit a portion of the Southern Alps and are still being hunted for sport. The Department of Conservation (DOC) culled 12,000 tahr between July 2019 and February 2020, and over 7,000 between July and November 2020.

Groups such as hunters and farmers have resisted tahr eradication. A report prepared in 2005 by Kenneth F.D. Hughey and Karen M. Wason presented the results of a survey conducted among 43 farmers living within tahr distribution. Roughly 80% of farmers view tahr as a resource, not as a threat. The respondents indicated they placed conservational and commercial value (live animal/meat, hunting, farming) on tahr. Thirty six percent of these farmers also reported to having earned at least $1,000 a year in profit from having tahr on their property, with the highest earnings being above $50,000 (Table 5.5 of that study), usually as a result of allowing professionally guided hunters on their property. Also, a 1988 study showed that hunters spent $851 per person per year on hunting, with expenses being greatest for big-game targets, such as the Himalayan tahr.

Tahr could be eradicated from New Zealand but &quot;this has not happened due to intense lobbying pressure from hunting interests, so ongoing ecological costs are incurred by the natural environment.&quot;

The hunting lobby has protested against the culling of tahr in 2020. DOC released a management plan for 2020–2021 which was contested in the High Court. The Court ruled that DOC should consult with interested parties and stakeholders which resulted in a number of changes to the plan; the revised plan was welcomed by the Tahr Foundation.

==== Impact as an invasive species ====
A negative impact the Himalayan tahrs have on their environment is increased herbivory on the native vegetation of the ecosystem, which can make it harder for other herbivores to find food. The increased herbivory can also lead to a decrease in soil nutrients, such as oxygen, nitrates, and ammonia, resulting in positive feedback loop, making it harder for plants to grow at all. Consequently, the natural fauna of the ecosystem is heavily affected. This increase has also resulted in poor soil quality in many environments occupied by the Himalayan tahr and has severely limited the presence of certain plant species. The lack of certain vegetation, in turn, may affect animal species that rely on them as a food source.

Data on the rapid expansion of the tahr are documented by government agencies. Over a time span of 16 years, the Himalayan tahr reached up to 33 tahr/km2 in New Zealand – twice the initial population (2*N0). Without regulated hunting or the presence of natural barriers, the Himalayan tahr can pose a large threat to the indigenous fauna and flora populations within the area.

==== Control methods ====
In 1930, the Himalayan tahr was denied protection by the Animals Protection and Game Act (1921–22) and was recognized as a danger to the environment, although the species is still considered to be endangered in the Himalayas on the IUCN Red List. Since 1937, various government operations have been undertaken to reduce tahr population and/or keep it at fixed numbers. The control of tahr remains ecologically and economically significant because of their widespread destruction of native flora and fauna and their valuable capture for hunters, respectively.

===== Hunting =====

In 1993, the Department of Conservation prepared the Himalayan Tahr Control Plan which lists “aerial game recovery operations, recreational and safari hunting as primary means of control”. Under the plan, the area of the tahr distribution was divided into two exclusion zones and seven management units. The exclusion zones set boundaries on the area that the tahr inhabits, with the official control operations to be employed to prevent them from spreading beyond those zones. The management unit has a fixed maximum density, which varies from 1–2.5 tahr/km2 and is considered to be low enough to have a minimal negative impact on the ecosystem and, even, restore native vegetation. Under these conditions, the plan aimed to keep tahr numbers below 10,000 throughout the South Island. Since then, the Department of Conservation has been actively advertising tahr hunting and has created 59 tahr-hunting areas. Hunting remains the primary means of control.

===== Poisoning =====

In 1960, sodium monofluoroacetate, also known as compound 1080, was used to poison tahrs. This derivative of fluoroacetic acid is commonly used in many countries such as Mexico, Australia, the United States, and New Zealand as a pesticide. Compound 1080 is highly water-soluble and is diluted by rainwater and broken down by aquatic microorganisms. Water samples after baiting operations did not reveal dangerous levels of the compound. In the soil, sodium monofluoroacetate is converted by bacteria and fungi to metabolic products, shown to be nonhazardous to the environment.

According to Australia&#x27;s Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water, and Environment, mammals (particularly cats and dogs) are the most susceptible to compound 1080 poisoning. Fish, birds, and amphibians generally are highly tolerant to the poison. Although compound 1080 is a strong enough pesticide to eradicate the entire tahr population, political pressures from hunter groups hinder its use. Opposition by the general public also contributes to the decreased use of 1080 with concerns that the accumulation of 1080 at higher levels of the food chain will pose danger to mammals such as dogs, deer and pigs.

=== South Africa ===
The Himalayan tahr was introduced to South Africa when in the 1930s, two Himalayan tahrs escaped from a zoo in Cape Town. Subsequent populations of tahrs have descended from the original escaped pair and spread quickly over the Cape Peninsular mountain range. Most of the population has been culled to make way for the reintroduction of the indigenous antelope, the klipspringer.

===United States ===
The Himalayan tahr is present in New Mexico, where it has been introduced. According to the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish news release dated 28 May 2014, &quot;Only one Wildlife Management Area, Water Canyon, allows hunting for nongame species as a management tool for the non-native Himalayan tahr, a large ungulate related to the wild goat.&quot; However, outside of Water Canyon Wildlife Management Area, Himalayan tahr may be taken. There is no closed season or bag limit on Himalayan tahr, and they may be hunted even with an airgun.

<text>The Centaur is a family of rocket propelled upper stages that has been in use since 1962. It is currently produced by U.S. launch service provider United Launch Alliance, with one main active version and one version under development. The diameter Common Centaur/Centaur III flies as the upper stage of the Atlas V launch vehicle, and the diameter Centaur V has been developed as the upper stage of ULA&#x27;s new Vulcan rocket. Centaur was the first rocket stage to use liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) propellants, a high-energy combination that is ideal for upper stages but has significant handling difficulties.

==Characteristics==
Common Centaur is built around stainless steel pressure stabilized balloon propellant tanks with thick walls. It can lift payloads of up to . The thin walls minimize the mass of the tanks, maximizing the stage&#x27;s overall performance.

A common bulkhead separates the LOX and LH2 tanks, further reducing the tank mass. It is made of two stainless steel skins separated by a fiberglass honeycomb. The fiberglass honeycomb minimizes heat transfer between the extremely cold LH2 and less cold LOX.

The main propulsion system consists of one or two Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10 engines. The stage is capable of up to twelve restarts, limited by propellant, orbital lifetime, and mission requirements. Combined with the insulation of the propellant tanks, this allows Centaur to perform the multi-hour coasts and multiple engine burns required on complex orbital insertions.

The reaction control system (RCS) also provides ullage and consists of twenty hydrazine monopropellant thrusters located around the stage in two 2-thruster pods and four 4-thruster pods. For propellant, of Hydrazine is stored in a pair of bladder tanks and fed to the RCS thrusters with pressurized helium gas, which is also used to accomplish some main engine functions.

==Current versions==
As of 2024, two Centaur variants are in use: Centaur III on Atlas V, and Centaur V on Vulcan Centaur. All of the many other Centaur variants have been retired.

===Current engines===
Centaur engines have evolved over time, and three versions (RL10A-4-2, RL10C-1 and RL10C-1-1) are in use as of 2024 (see table below). All versions utilize liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.
===Centaur III/Common Centaur===

Common Centaur is the upper stage of the Atlas V rocket. Earlier Common Centaurs were propelled by the RL10-A-4-2 version of the RL-10. Since 2014, Common Centaur has flown with the RL10-C-1 engine, which is shared with the Delta Cryogenic Second Stage, to reduce costs. The Dual Engine Centaur (DEC) configuration will continue to use the smaller RL10-A-4-2 to accommodate two engines in the available space.

The Atlas V can fly in multiple configurations, but only one affects the way Centaur integrates with the booster and fairing: the diameter Atlas V payload fairing attaches to the booster and encapsulates the upper stage and payload, routing fairing-induced aerodynamic loads into the booster. If the diameter payload fairing is used, the attachment point is at the top (forward end) of Centaur, routing loads through the Centaur tank structure.

The latest Common Centaurs can accommodate secondary payloads using an Aft Bulkhead Carrier attached to the engine end of the stage.

==== Single Engine Centaur (SEC) ====
Most payloads launch on Single Engine Centaur (SEC) with one RL10. This is the variant for all normal flights of the Atlas V (indicated by the last digit of the naming system, for example Atlas V 421).

==== Dual Engine Centaur (DEC) ====
A dual engine variant with two RL-10 engines is available, but only for launching the CST-100 Starliner crewed spacecraft. The higher thrust of two engines allows a gentler ascent with more horizontal velocity and less vertical velocity, which reduces deceleration to survivable levels in the event of a launch abort and ballistic reentry occurring at any point in the flight.

===Centaur V===

Centaur V is the upper stage of the new Vulcan launch vehicle developed by the United Launch Alliance to meet the needs of the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. Vulcan was initially intended to enter service with an upgraded variant of the Common Centaur, with an upgrade to the Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage (ACES) planned after the first few years of flights.

In late 2017, ULA decided to bring elements of the ACES upper stage forward and begin work on Centaur V. Centaur V will have ACES&#x27; diameter and advanced insulation, but does not include the Integrated Vehicle Fluids (IVF) feature expected to allow the extension of upper stage on-orbit life from hours to weeks. Centaur V uses two different versions of the RL10-C engine with nozzle extensions to improve the fuel consumption for the heaviest payloads. This increased capability over Common Centaur was intended to permit ULA to meet NSSL requirements and retire both the Atlas V and Delta IV Heavy rocket families earlier than initially planned. The new rocket publicly became the Vulcan Centaur in March 2018. In May 2018, the Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10 was announced as Centaur V&#x27;s engine following a competitive procurement process against the Blue Origin BE-3. Each stage will mount two engines. In September 2020, ULA announced that ACES was no longer being developed, and that Centaur V would be used instead. Tory Bruno, ULA&#x27;s CEO, stated that the Vulcan&#x27;s Centaur 5 will have 40% more endurance and two and a half times more energy than the upper stage ULA currently flies. “But that’s just the tip of the iceberg,” Bruno elaborated. “I’m going to be pushing up to 450, 500, 600 times the endurance over just the next handful of years. That will enable a whole new set of missions that you cannot even imagine doing today.”

Vulcan finally launched on 8 January 2024 and the stage performed flawlessly on its maiden flight.

On 4 October 2024, in a pre-recorded message during the broadcast of the Vulcan Cert-2 mission, Upgrades Development Director Amanda Bacchetti had stated that ULA would be developing a &quot;LEO Optimized Centaur&quot; set to launch aboard a Vulcan launch vehicle sometime in 2025. She had stated that this variant of Centaur V would be shorter (and therefore more mass efficient for LEO orbits), however specifications for this variant were not given.

==History==
The Centaur concept originated in 1956 when the Convair division of General Dynamics began studying a liquid hydrogen fueled upper stage. The ensuing project began in 1958 as a joint venture among Convair, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), and the U.S. Air Force. In 1959, NASA assumed ARPA&#x27;s role. Centaur initially flew as the upper stage of the Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle, encountering a number of early developmental issues due to the pioneering nature of the effort and the use of liquid hydrogen. In 1994 General Dynamics sold their Space Systems division to Lockheed-Martin.

=== Centaur A-D (Atlas) ===

The Centaur was originally developed for use with the Atlas launch vehicle family. Known in early planning as the &#x27;high-energy upper stage&#x27;, the choice of the mythological Centaur as a namesake was intended to represent the combination of the brute force of the Atlas booster and finesse of the upper stage.

Initial Atlas-Centaur launches used developmental versions, labeled Centaur-A through -C.

The only Centaur-A launch on 8 May 1962 ended in an explosion 54 seconds after liftoff when insulation panels on the Centaur separated early, causing the LH2 tank to overheat and rupture. This version was powered by two RL10A-1 engines.

After extensive redesigns, the only Centaur-B flight on 26 November 1963 was successful. This version was powered by two RL10A-3 engines.

Centaur-C flew three times between 1964 and 1965, with two failures and one launch declared successful although the Centaur failed to restart. This version was also powered by two RL10A-3 engines.

Centaur-D was the first version to enter operational service in 1965 , with fifty-six launches. It was powered by two RL10A-3-1 or RL10A-3-3 engines.

On 30 May 1966, an Atlas-Centaur boosted the first Surveyor lander towards the Moon. This was followed by six more Surveyor launches over the next two years, with the Atlas-Centaur performing as expected. The Surveyor program demonstrated the feasibility of reigniting a hydrogen engine in space and provided information on the behavior of LH2 in space.

By the 1970s, Centaur was fully mature and had become the standard rocket stage for launching larger civilian payloads into high Earth orbit, also replacing the Atlas-Agena vehicle for NASA planetary probes.

An updated version, called Centaur-D1A (powered by RL10A-3-3 engines), was used on the Atlas-SLV3D came into use during the 1970s.

The Centaur-D1AR was used for the Atlas-SLV3D and Atlas G came into use during the 1970s and 1980s.

By the end of 1989, Centaur-D had been used as the upper stage for 63 Atlas rocket launches, 55 of which were successful.

=== Saturn I S-V ===

The Saturn I was designed to fly with a S-V third stage to enable payloads to go beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). The S-V stage was intended to be powered by two RL-10A-1 engines burning liquid hydrogen as fuel and liquid oxygen as oxidizer. The S-V stage was flown four times on missions SA-1 through SA-4, all four of these missions had the S-V&#x27;s tanks filled with water to be used a ballast during launch. The stage was not flown in an active configuration.

===Centaur D-1T (Titan III)===
The Centaur D-1T (powered by RL10A-3-3 engines) was an improved version for use on the far more powerful Titan III booster in the 1970s, with the first launch of the resulting Titan IIIE in 1974. The Titan IIIE more than tripled the payload capacity of Atlas-Centaur, and incorporated improved thermal insulation, allowing an orbital lifespan of up to five hours, an increase over the 30 minutes of the Atlas-Centaur.

The first launch of Titan IIIE in February 1974 was unsuccessful, with the loss of the Space Plasma High Voltage Experiment (SPHINX) and a mockup of the Viking probe. It was eventually determined that Centaur&#x27;s engines had ingested an incorrectly installed clip from the oxygen tank.

The next Titan-Centaurs launched Helios 1, &quot;Viking 1&quot;, &quot;Viking 2&quot;, Helios 2, &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, and &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. The Titan booster used to launch &quot;Voyager 1&quot; had a hardware problem that caused a premature shutdown, which the Centaur stage detected and successfully compensated for. Centaur ended its burn with less than 4 seconds of fuel remaining.

==== Centaur D-1T specifications ====
The Centaur D-1T had the following general specifications:
* Diameter: 
* Length: 
* Inert mass: 
* Fuel: Liquid hydrogen
* Oxidizer: Liquid oxygen
* Fuel and oxidizer mass: 
* Guidance: 
* Thrust: 
* Burn Capability: 3 to 4 burns
* Engine: 2 x RL10A-3-3
* Engine start: Restartable
* Attitude control: 4 x thrusters
===Shuttle-Centaur (Centaur G and G-Prime)===

Shuttle-Centaur was a proposed Space Shuttle upper stage. To enable its installation in shuttle payload bays, the diameter of the Centaur&#x27;s hydrogen tank was increased to , with the LOX tank diameter remaining at . Two variants were proposed: Centaur G Prime, which was planned to launch the &quot;Galileo&quot; and &quot;Ulysses&quot; robotic probes, and Centaur G, a shortened version, reduced in length from approximately , planned for U.S. DoD payloads and the &quot;Magellan&quot; Venus probe.

After the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; accident, and just months before the Shuttle-Centaur had been scheduled to fly, NASA concluded that it was too risky to fly the Centaur on the Shuttle. The probes were launched with the much less powerful solid-fueled IUS, with &quot;Galileo&quot; needing multiple gravitational assists from Venus and Earth to reach Jupiter.

===Centaur T (Titan IV)===

The capability gap left by the termination of the Shuttle-Centaur program was filled by a new launch vehicle, the Titan IV. The 401A/B versions used a Centaur upper stage with a diameter hydrogen tank. In the Titan 401A version, a Centaur-T was launched nine times between 1994 and 1998. The 1997 &quot;Cassini-Huygens&quot; Saturn probe was the first flight of the Titan 401B, with an additional six launches wrapping up in 2003 including one SRB failure.

=== Centaur I (Atlas I) ===

The upper stage of the Atlas I was the Centaur I stage, derived from earlier models of Centaur that also flew atop Atlas boosters. Centaur I featured two RL-10-A-3A engines burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, making the stage extremely efficient. To help slow the boiloff of liquid hydrogen in the tanks, Centaur featured fiberglass insulation panels that were jettisoned 25 seconds after the first stage booster engines were jettisoned. Centaur I was the last version of the stage to feature separating insulation panels.

===Centaur II (Atlas II/III)===

Centaur II was initially developed for use on the Atlas II series of rockets. Centaur II also flew on the initial Atlas IIIA launches.

===Centaur III/Common Centaur (Atlas III/V)===

Atlas IIIB introduced the Common Centaur, a longer and initially dual engine Centaur II.

===Atlas V cryogenic fluid management experiments===
Most Common Centaurs launched on Atlas V have hundreds to thousands of kilograms of propellants remaining on payload separation. In 2006 these propellants were identified as a possible experimental resource for testing in-space cryogenic fluid management techniques.

In October 2009, the Air Force and United Launch Alliance (ULA) performed an experimental demonstration on the modified Centaur upper stage of DMSP-18 launch to improve &quot;understanding of propellant settling and slosh, pressure control, RL10 chilldown and RL10 two-phase shutdown operations. DMSP-18 was a low mass payload, with approximately 28% () of LH2/LOX propellant remaining after separation. Several on-orbit demonstrations were conducted over 2.4 hours, concluding with a deorbit burn. The initial demonstration was intended to prepare for more-advanced cryogenic fluid management experiments planned under the Centaur-based CRYOTE technology development program in 2012–2014, and will increase the TRL of the Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage Centaur successor.

== Mishaps ==
Although Centaur has a long and successful flight history, it has experienced a number of mishaps:
* April 7, 1966: Centaur did not restart after coast — ullage motors ran out of fuel.
* August 10, 1968: AC-17. Centaur did not restart after coast — icing of the hydrogen peroxide supply lines.
* May 9, 1971: Centaur guidance failed, destroying itself and the Mariner 8 spacecraft bound for Mars orbit.
* April 18, 1991: AC-70. Centaur failed to restart (icing problem). Incomplete failure investigation initially stated that Centaur failed due to particles from the scouring pads used to clean the propellant ducts getting stuck in the turbopump, preventing start-up.
* August 22, 1992: AC-71. Centaur failed to restart (same icing problem as the prior incident).
* April 30, 1999: Launch of the USA-143 (Milstar DFS-3m) communications satellite failed when a Centaur database error resulted in uncontrolled roll rate and loss of attitude control, placing the satellite in a useless orbit.
* June 15, 2007: the engine in the Centaur upper stage of an Atlas V shut down early, leaving its payload — a pair of National Reconnaissance Office ocean surveillance satellites — in a lower than intended orbit. The failure was called &quot;A major disappointment,&quot; though later statements claim the spacecraft will still be able to complete their mission. The cause was traced to a stuck-open valve that depleted some of the hydrogen fuel, resulting in the second burn terminating four seconds early. The problem was fixed, and the next flight was nominal.
* March 23–25, 2018: Atlas V Centaur passivated second stage launched on September 8, 2009, broke up.
* August 30, 2018: Atlas V Centaur passivated second stage launched on September 17, 2014, broke up, creating space debris.
* April 6, 2019: Atlas V Centaur passivated second stage launched on October 17, 2018, broke up.
* September 6, 2024: Atlas V Centaur passivated second stage launched on March 1, 2018, broke up.

<text>In Greek mythology, Procris (, &quot;gen&quot;.: Πρόκριδος) was an Athenian princess, the third daughter of Erechtheus, king of Athens and his wife, Praxithea. Homer mentions her in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; as one of the many dead spirits Odysseus saw in the Underworld. Sophocles wrote a tragedy called &quot;Procris&quot; that has been lost, as has a version contained in the Greek Cycle, but at least six different accounts of her story still exist.

== Family ==
Procris&#x27;s sisters were Creusa, Oreithyia, Chthonia, Protogeneia, Pandora and Merope while her brothers were Cecrops, Pandorus, Metion, and possibly Orneus, Thespius, Eupalamus and Sicyon. She married Cephalus, the son of King Deioneus of Phocis.

== Mythology ==

===Pherecydes===
The earliest version of Procris&#x27; story comes from Pherecydes of Athens. Cephalus remains away from home for eight years because he wanted to test Procris. When he returns, he seduces her while disguised. Although reconciled, Procris suspects that her husband has a lover because he is often away hunting. A servant tells her that Cephalus called to Nephele (a cloud) to come to him. Procris follows him the next time he goes hunting and leaps out of the thicket when she hears him call out to Nephele again. He is startled and thinking that she is a wild animal, shoots her with an arrow and kills her.

===Ovid===
====Early version====
Ovid tells the end of the story a bit differently in the third of his books on &quot;The Art of Love.&quot; No goddesses are mentioned in this earlier published work, a cautionary tale against credulity. After hunting, Cephalus calls for a breeze (Zephyr or Aura) to cool him as he lies in the shade.

Overhearing a comment to Procris, a busybody reports what he heard to Procris, who grew pale with terror that her husband loved another, and hastened in fury to the valley, then crept silently to the forest where Cephalus hunted. When she saw him flop on the grass to cool himself and call, to Zephyr to come relieve him, Procris realized that what she had taken to be the name of a lover was merely a name for the air and nothing more. Joyfully she rose to fling herself into his arms, but hearing a rustling of foliage, Cephalus shot an arrow at what he thought would be a wild beast in the brush. Dying, the woman laments that the breeze by whose name she was deceived would now carry away her spirit, and her husband weeps, holding her in his arms.

====Late version====
In Ovid&#x27;s later account, the goddess of the dawn, Eos (Aurora to the Romans) seizes Cephalus while he is hunting, but Cephalus begins to pine for Procris. A disgruntled Eos returns Cephalus to his wife, but offers to show Cephalus how easily Procris would be seduced by another stranger. He therefore goes home in disguise. He pushes Procris to &quot;hesitate&quot; by promising her money before claiming that she is unfaithful. Procris flees to take up the pursuits of Diana, and is later persuaded to return to her husband, bringing him a magical spear and a hunting dog as gifts. Ovid emphasizes that Cephalus (who is the narrator of the events) dares not say how he acquired the dog and the javelin from Procris, hinting that Cephalus himself was seduced and tricked in the same manner as he did Procris, like in the versions Antoninus Liberalis and Hyginus related. The transformation scene centers on the dog, which always catches its quarry, and the uncatchable fox; Jupiter turns them into stone.

The tale resumes with a similar ending to that of Pherecydes, as Procris is informed of her husband&#x27;s calling out to &quot;Aura&quot;, the Latin word for breeze, which sounds similar to Eos&#x27; Roman equivalent Aurora. Cephalus kills her by accident when she stirs in the bushes nearby, upset at his beseeching of &quot;beloved Aura&quot; to &quot;come into his lap and give relief to his heat&quot;. Procris dies in his arms after begging him not to let Aura take her place as his wife. He explains to her that it was &#x27;only the breeze&#x27; and she seems to die at ease.

===Apollodorus, Hyginus, and Antoninus===
The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; gives an entirely different characterization of Procris. It states that Procris was bribed with a golden crown to sleep with Pteleon, but was discovered in his bed by her husband. She is described as fleeing to King Minos, who had been cursed by his wife Pasiphaë to ejaculate scorpions, serpents and centipedes that killed his mistresses from the inside. Procris was said to have helped cure the king of his genital sickness with a circean herb. She was given a dog no quarry could escape and an infallible javelin. The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; states that she gave the dog and javelin to Cephalus and they were reconciled.

Hyginus (who states that the dog and javelin are gifts from the goddess Artemis) and Antoninus Liberalis, however, write that she disguised herself as a boy and seduced her husband, so that he too was guilty, and they were reconciled. According to the latter, Minos&#x27; unexplained disease not only killed his mistresses, but also prevented him and Pasiphaë from having any children (Pasiphaë herself was not otherwise harmed, being an immortal daughter of Helios). Procris then inserted a goat&#x27;s bladder in a woman, told Minos to ejaculate there, and after that she sent him to his wife; the couple was thus able to conceive, and Minos gave his spear and his dog as gratitude gifts to her.

Unlike the other versions, Hyginus omits Cephalus&#x27; abduction by Eos; instead he rejects her when she propositions him, and she replies that she does not want him to break his marital vows unless Procris has. She then disguises him as a stranger who successfully seduces Procris. When they lie together in bed, Eos removes the enchantment from him, and Procris, realizing she has been deceived by Eos, flees in shame. After their reunion, Procris follows Cephalus in secret out of fear of Eos.

===The dog and the fox===
The name of the dog is Laelaps. The story of the hunting of the Teumessian fox, which could never be caught, and that Zeus turned to stone along with Procris&#x27; dog when the dog hunted it, and the death of Procris were told in one of the lost early Greek epics of the Cycle, most probably the &quot;Epigoni&quot;.

=== Medieval tradition ===
Procris&#x27; story is included in &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot;, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 136162. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.

<text>Flight instruments are the instruments in the cockpit of an aircraft that provide the pilot with data about the flight situation of that aircraft, such as altitude, airspeed, vertical speed, heading and much more other crucial information in flight. They improve safety by allowing the pilot to fly the aircraft in level flight, and make turns, without a reference outside the aircraft such as the horizon. Visual flight rules (VFR) require an airspeed indicator, an altimeter, and a compass or other suitable magnetic direction indicator. Instrument flight rules (IFR) additionally require a gyroscopic pitch-bank (artificial horizon), direction (directional gyro) and rate of turn indicator, plus a slip-skid indicator, adjustable altimeter, and a clock. Flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) require radio navigation instruments for precise takeoffs and landings.

The term is sometimes used loosely as a synonym for cockpit instruments as a whole, in which context it can include engine instruments, navigational and communication equipment. Many modern aircraft have electronic flight instrument systems.

Most regulated aircraft have these flight instruments as dictated by the US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Part 91. They are grouped according to pitot-static system, compass systems, and gyroscopic instruments.

==Pitot-static systems==
Instruments which are pitot-static systems use air pressure differences to determine speed and altitude.

===Altimeter===
The altimeter shows the aircraft&#x27;s altitude above sea-level by measuring the difference between the pressure in a stack of aneroid capsules inside the altimeter and the atmospheric pressure obtained through the static system. The most common unit for altimeter calibration worldwide is hectopascals (hPa), except for North America and Japan where inches of mercury (inHg) are used. The altimeter is adjustable for local barometric pressure which must be set correctly to obtain accurate altitude readings, usually in either feet or meters. As the aircraft ascends, the capsules expand and the static pressure drops, causing the altimeter to indicate a higher altitude. The opposite effect occurs when descending. With the advancement in aviation and increased altitude ceiling, the altimeter dial had to be altered for use both at higher and lower altitudes. Hence when the needles were indicating lower altitudes i.e. the first 360-degree operation of the pointers was delineated by the appearance of a small window with oblique lines warning the pilot that he or she is nearer to the ground. This modification was introduced in the early sixties after the recurrence of air accidents caused by the confusion in the pilot&#x27;s mind. At higher altitudes, the window will disappear.

===Airspeed indicator===
The airspeed indicator shows the aircraft&#x27;s speed relative to the surrounding air. Knots is the currently most used unit, but kilometers per hour is sometimes used instead. The airspeed indicator works by measuring the ram-air pressure in the aircraft&#x27;s pitot tube relative to the ambient static pressure. The indicated airspeed (IAS) must be corrected for nonstandard pressure and temperature in order to obtain the true airspeed (TAS). The instrument is color coded to indicate important airspeeds such as the stall speed, never-exceed airspeed, or safe flap operation speeds.

===Vertical speed indicator===
The VSI (also sometimes called a variometer, or rate of climb indicator) senses changing air pressure, and displays that information to the pilot as a rate of climb or descent in feet per minute, meters per second or knots.
==Compass systems==
===Magnetic compass===
The compass shows the aircraft&#x27;s heading relative to magnetic north. Errors include Variation, or the difference between magnetic and true direction, and Deviation, caused by the electrical wiring in the aircraft, which requires a Compass Correction Card. Additionally, the compass is subject to Dip Errors. While reliable in steady level flight it can give confusing indications when turning, climbing, descending, or accelerating due to the inclination of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. For this reason, the heading indicator is also used for aircraft operation, but periodically calibrated against the compass.

==Gyroscopic systems==
===Attitude Indicator ===
The attitude indicator (also known as an &quot;artificial horizon&quot;) shows the aircraft&#x27;s relation to the horizon. From this the pilot can tell whether the wings are level (roll) and if the aircraft nose is pointing above or below the horizon (pitch). Attitude is always presented to users in the unit degrees (°). The attitude indicator is a primary instrument for instrument flight and is also useful in conditions of poor visibility. Pilots are trained to use other instruments in combination should this instrument or its power fail.

===Heading indicator===
The heading indicator (also known as the directional gyro, or DG) displays the aircraft&#x27;s heading in compass points, and with respect to magnetic north when set with a compass. Bearing friction causes drift errors from precession, which must be periodically corrected by calibrating the instrument to the magnetic compass. In many advanced aircraft (including almost all jet aircraft), the heading indicator is replaced by a horizontal situation indicator (HSI) which provides the same heading information, but also assists with navigation.

===Turn indicator===
These include the Turn-and-Slip Indicator and the Turn Coordinator, which indicate rotation about the longitudinal axis. They include an inclinometer to indicate if the aircraft is in Coordinated flight, or in a Slip or Skid. Additional marks indicate a Standard rate turn. The turn rate is most commonly expressed in either degrees per second (deg/s) or minutes per turn (min/tr).

==Flight director systems==
These include the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) and Attitude Director Indicator (ADI). The HSI combines the magnetic compass with navigation signals and a Glide slope. The navigation information comes from a VOR/Localizer, or GNSS. The ADI is an Attitude Indicator with computer-driven steering bars, a task reliever during instrument flight.

==Navigational systems==
===Very-High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR)===
The VOR indicator instrument includes a Course deviation indicator (CDI), Omnibearing Selector (OBS), TO/FROM indicator, and Flags. The CDI shows an aircraft&#x27;s lateral position in relation to a selected radial track. It is used for orientation, tracking to or from a station, and course interception. On the instrument, the vertical needle indicates the lateral position of the selected track. A horizontal needle allows the pilot to follow a glide slope when the instrument is used with an ILS.

===Nondirectional Radio Beacon (NDB)===
The Automatic direction finder (ADF) indicator instrument can be a fixed-card, movable card, or a Radio magnetic indicator (RMI). An RMI is remotely coupled to a gyrocompass so that it automatically rotates the azimuth card to represent aircraft heading. While simple ADF displays may have only one needle, a typical RMI has two, coupled to different ADF receivers, allowing for position fixing using one instrument.

== Layout ==

Most aircraft are equipped with a standard set of flight instruments which give the pilot information about the aircraft&#x27;s attitude, airspeed, and altitude.

=== T arrangement ===
Most US aircraft built since the 1940s have flight instruments arranged in a standardized pattern called the &quot;T&quot; arrangement. The attitude indicator is in the top center, airspeed to the left, altimeter to the right and heading indicator under the attitude indicator. The other two, turn-coordinator and vertical-speed, are usually found under the airspeed and altimeter, but are given more latitude in placement. The magnetic compass will be above the instrument panel, often on the windscreen centerpost. In newer aircraft with glass cockpit instruments the layout of the displays conform to the basic T arrangement.

=== Early history ===
In 1929, Jimmy Doolittle became the first pilot to take off, fly and land an airplane using instruments alone, without a view outside the cockpit. In 1937, the British Royal Air Force (RAF) chose a set of six essential flight instruments which would remain the standard panel used for flying in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) for the next 20 years. They were:

* altimeter (feet)
* airspeed indicator (knots)
* turn and bank indicator (turn direction and coordination)
* vertical speed indicator (feet per minute)
* artificial horizon (attitude indication)
* directional gyro / heading indicator (degrees)

This panel arrangement was incorporated into all RAF aircraft built to official specification from 1938, such as the Miles Master, Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire, and 4-engined Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers, but not the earlier light single-engined Tiger Moth trainer, and minimized the type-conversion difficulties associated with blind flying, since a pilot trained on one aircraft could quickly become accustomed to any other if the instruments were identical.

This basic six set, also known as a &quot;six pack&quot;, was also adopted by commercial aviation. After the Second World War the arrangement was changed to: (top row) airspeed, artificial horizon, altimeter, (bottom row) turn and bank indicator, heading indicator, vertical speed.

===Further development===
In glass cockpits the flight instruments are shown on monitors. Primary flight display, is given a central place on the panel, superseding the artificial horizon, often, with a horizontal situation indicator next to it or integrated with the PFD. The indicated airspeed, altimeter, and vertical speed indicator are displayed as moving &quot;tapes&quot; with the indicated airspeed to the left of the horizon and the altimeter and the vertical speed to the right in the same layout as in most older style &quot;clock cockpits&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Charites (), singular Charis (), also called the Graces, are goddesses who personify beauty and grace. According to Hesiod, the Charites were Aglaea, Euphrosyne, and Thalia, who were the daughters of Zeus and Eurynome, the daughter of Oceanus. However in other accounts, their names, number and parentage varied. In Roman mythology they were known as the Gratiae. Hesiod has Aglaea as the wife of Hephaestus, and in the &quot;Iliad&quot; Hera promises to give a Charis named Pasithea to Hypnos as bride. Otherwise they have little independent mythology usually described as attending various gods and goddesses, especially Aphrodite.

In Roman and later art, the three Charites are generally depicted nude in an interlaced group, but during the Archaic and Classical periods of Greece, they were typically depicted as fully clothed, and in a line, with dance poses.

==Parentage, number, and names==
In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, the Charites are the three daughters of Zeus: Aglaea (&quot;Splendor&quot;), Euphrosyne (&quot;Joy&quot;), and Thalia (&quot;Good Cheer&quot;), by the Oceanid Eurynome. The identical genealogy is given by Apollodorus. The same three names are also given by Pindar, with a possible reference to their &quot;father&quot; Zeus and no mother mentioned. Although the Charites were usually considered to be Zeus&#x27; daughters and three in number, their names as well as their parentage and number varied. Homer mentions Pasithea as &quot;one of the youthful Graces&quot;, and perhaps has &quot;Charis&quot; (the singular form of &quot;Charites&quot;), as the name of another, but does not give their parentage, number, or any other of their names.

The geographer Pausanias gives other variations, some regional. He says that, according to Boeotian tradition, Eteocles, the king of Orchomenus, established three as the number of Charites, but that the Athenians and Spartans worshipped only two. For the Athenians the two Charites were Auxo and Hegemone, while for the Spartans they were Cleta and Phaenna. Also, according to Pausanias, the Hellenistic poet Hermesianax said that Peitho (&quot;Persuasion&quot;) was one of the Charites, and the poet Antimachus said that the Charites were the &quot;daughters of Aegle and the Sun [Helios]&quot;.

While Hesiod has Eurynome, and Antimachus has Aegle, as the mother of the Charites, other names were also given. According to &quot;Orphic Hymn&quot; 60, the Charites (&quot;Aglaea, Thalia, ... Euphrosyne&quot;) were the daughters of Zeus and Eunomia. The Stoic philosopher Cornutus includes the names Eurynome, and Aegle, he gives other names for mothers as well: Eurydome, Eurymedousa, Hera, and Euanthe. Nonnus has his three Charites (Hesiod&#x27;s Aglaea, Homer&#x27;s Pasithea, and Hermesianax&#x27;s Peitho) being the daughters of Dionysus and Coronis.

A purported summary of a lost poem by an otherwise unknown poet &quot;Sostratus&quot;, while naming the three Charites, adds to Homer&#x27;s Pasithea, and Hesiod&#x27;s Euphrosyne, the name Kale, saying that it was she who was the wife of Hephaestus.

==Mythology==

The Charites&#x27; major mythological role was to attend the other Olympians, particularly during feasts and dances. They attended Aphrodite by bathing and anointing her in Paphos before her seduction of Ankhises and after she left Olympus when her affair with Ares is found out. Additionally, they are said to weave or dye her peplos. Along with Peitho, they presented Pandora with necklaces to make her more enticing. Pindar stated the Charites arranged feasts and dances for the Olympians. They also danced with the Seasons, Hebe, Harmonia and Aphrodite in celebration of the arrival of Apollo among the gods of Olympus, while Artemis sang and Apollo played the lyre. They were often referenced as dancing and singing with Apollo and the Muses. Pindar also referred to them as the guardians of the ancient Minyans and the queens of Orchomenus who have their thrones beside Pythian Apollo&#x27;s.

The Charites appear to have a connection to Hera, where some ancient authors reference her as their nurse. In the Iliad, as part of her plan to seduce Zeus to distract him from the Trojan War, she offers to arrange Hypnos&#x27;s marriage to Pasithea, who is referred to as one of the younger Charites.

One of the Charites had a role as the wife of the smith god Hephaestus. Hesiod names the wife of Hephaestus as Aglaea. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, she is called Charis, and she welcomes Thetis into their shared home on Olympus so that the latter may ask for Hephaestus to forge armor for her son Achilles. Some scholars have interpreted this marriage as occurring after Hephaestus&#x27;s divorce from Aphrodite due to her affair with Ares being exposed. Notably, however, some scholars, such as Walter Burkert, support that the marriage of Hephaestus and Aphrodite as an invention of the Odyssey, since it is not represented within other Archaic or Classical era literature or arts, and it does not appear to have a connection to cult.

== Cult ==

The cult of the Charites is very old, with their name appearing to be of Pelasgian, or pre-Greek, origin rather than being brought to Greece by Proto-Indo-Europeans. The purpose of their cult appears to be similar to that of nymphs, primarily based around fertility and nature with a particular connection to springs and rivers. One of the earliest centres of worship for the Charites was the Cycladic Islands including Paros, with epigraphical evidence for a cult to the Charites dating to the sixth century B.C.E. on the island of Thera. Scholars have interpreted them as chthonic deities connected to fertility due to the absence of wreaths and flutes in ceremonies. An aetiological explanation for the lack of music and garlands was from a myth involving Minos. He was said to have been sacrificing to the Charites on the island of Paros when he learned of his son&#x27;s death in Athens and stopped the music and ripped off his garlands in grief. Dance, however, appears to be strongly connected with their cult, which is similar to the cults of Dionysus and Artemis.

Although the Charites were most commonly depicted in the sanctuaries of other gods, there were at least four temples exclusively dedicated to them in Greece. The temple regarded as their perhaps most important was that in Orkhomenos in Boeotia, where their cult was thought to have originated. There were also temples to the Charites in Hermione, Sparta, and Elis. A temple was dedicated to the Charites near the Tiasa river in Amyclae, Laconia that was reportedly founded by the ancient King of Sparta, Lacedaemon.
In Orkhomenos, the goddesses were worshipped at a very ancient site with a trio of stones, which is similar to other Boiotian cults to Eros and Herakles. The local river Kephisos and the Akidalia (or Argaphia) spring was sacred to the three goddesses. Orkhomenos was an agriculturally prosperous city because of the marshy Kopaic plain, and the Charites were offered a portion of the produce. Regarding the foundation of their cult in Orkhomenos, Strabo wrote:

In cult, the Charites were particularly connected with Apollo and appear to be connected to his cult on Delos; however, this connection is not present in other cults to Apollo. In the Classical era and beyond, the Charites were associated with Aphrodite in connection to civic matters.

There was a festival in honour of the Charites which was called &quot;Charisia&quot; (Χαρίσια). During this festival there were dances all night and at the end a cake was given to those who remained awake during the whole time.

==Visual art==
===Ancient art===

Despite the Charites usually being depicted nude entwined in a &quot;closed symmetrical group&quot; for the last two millennia, this was a later development, as in depictions from Archaic and Classical Greece, they are finely dressed, and usually shown in a line, as dancers. In contrast, the third century BCE poets Callimachus and Euphorion describe the trio as being nude.

The earliest representation of these goddesses was found in a temple of Apollo in Thermon dated to the seventh to sixth century BCE. It is possible, however, that the Charites are represented on a Mycenean golden seal ring that depicts two female figures dancing in the presence of a male figure, who has been interpreted as Hermes or Dionysus. Another early representation of the Charites, from a relief at the Paros colony of Thasos dated to the beginning of the fifth century BCE, shows the Charites with Hermes and either Aphrodite or Peitho, which marked the entrance to the old city. The opposite side of the relief shows Apollo being crowned by Artemis with nymphs in the background. At the entrance of the Akropolis, there was a famous Classical era relief of the Charites and Hermes, and the popular belief was that the sculptor was Socrates, although this is very unlikely.

Kenneth Clark describes the &quot;complicated&quot; pose of the Three Graces facing inwards with interlaced arms as &quot;one of the last beautiful inventions of antique art&quot;. He thought it was invented in the 1st century BCE, based on the proportions of the figures, and notes that none of the many survivals from antiquity are of &quot;high quality&quot;. The opportunity for artists to show their skill in representing figures with three nude female figures seen from different angles has been a factor in the enduring popularity of the subject.
One of the earliest known Roman representations of the Graces was a wall painting in Boscoreale dated to 40 BCE, which also depicted Aphrodite with Eros and Dionysus with Ariadne. The group may have also appeared on a small number of coins to symbolize the union between Marcus Aurelius and Faustina Minor and on other coins they were depicted in the hands of Juno or Venus. The Graces were common subject matter on Roman sarcophagi, and they were depicted on several mirrors.
On the representation of the Graces, the second century CE guide book author Pausanias wrote:

===Renaissance onwards===

Clark writes that &quot;For some reason the nakedness of the Graces was free from moral opprobium, and in consequence they furnished the subject through which pagan beauty was first allowed to appear in the 15th century&quot;. Indeed, a large marble Graeco-Roman group, which was a key model in the Renaissance, when it was in the Piccolomini Library, is now displayed in Siena Cathedral.
The Charites are depicted together with several other mythological figures in Sandro Botticelli&#x27;s painting &quot;Primavera&quot;. Raphael also pictured them in a small painting now in the Musée Condé (Chantilly, France). Among other artistic depictions, they are the subject of famous sculptures by Antonio Canova and Bertel Thorvaldsen. The vast majority use a variant of the closed group pose.

A group of three trees in the Calaveras Big Trees State Park are named &quot;The Three Graces&quot; after the Charites.

<text>In Greek mythology, Liriope () or Leiriope () is a Boeotian naiad of Thespiae, who was probably the daughter of one of the Boeotian or Phocian river gods. Liriope was raped by the river-god Cephissus, who was himself the son of Pontus and Thalassa, and bore his son Narcissus.

Liriope&#x27;s name means &quot;face of the narcissus&quot; from the Greek words &quot;leirion&quot; &quot;narcissus&quot; and &quot;ops&quot; &quot;face.&quot; Her son was also named for the flower—&quot;narkissos&quot; in Greek. &quot;Leiron&quot; and &quot;narkissos&quot; might be the same plant or could represent two different species of daffodil.

Liriope was probably identified with Lilaia, the Naiad-nymph of the springs of the river Kephisos.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Oceanids or Oceanides ( ; , ) are the nymphs who were the three thousand (a number interpreted as meaning &quot;innumerable&quot;) daughters of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys.

==Description and function==
The Oceanids&#x27; father Oceanus was the great primordial world-encircling river, their mother Tethys was a sea goddess, and their brothers the river gods (also three thousand in number) were the personifications of the great rivers of the world. Like the rest of their family, the Oceanid nymphs were associated with water, as the personification of springs. Hesiod says they are &quot;dispersed far and wide&quot; and everywhere &quot;serve the earth and the deep waters&quot;, while in Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27; &quot;Argonautica&quot;, the Argonauts, stranded in the desert of Libya, beg the &quot;nymphs, sacred of the race of Oceanus&quot; to show them &quot;some spring of water from the rock or some sacred flow gushing from the earth&quot;.

The Oceanids are not easily categorized, nor confined to any single function, not even necessarily associated with water. Though most nymphs were considered to be minor deities, many Oceanids were significant figures. Metis, the personification of intelligence, was Zeus&#x27; first wife, whom Zeus impregnated with Athena and then swallowed. The Oceanid Doris, like her mother Tethys, was an important sea-goddess. While their brothers, the river gods, were the usual personifications of major rivers, Styx (according to Hesiod the eldest and most important Oceanid) was also the personification of a major river, the underworld&#x27;s river Styx. And some, like Europa, and Asia, seem associated with areas of land rather than water.

The Oceanids were also responsible for keeping watch over the young. According to Hesiod, who described them as &quot;neat-ankled daughters of Ocean ... children who are glorious among goddesses&quot;, they are &quot;a holy company of daughters who with the lord Apollo and the Rivers have youths in their keeping—to this charge Zeus appointed them&quot;.

Like Metis, the Oceanids also functioned as the wives (or lovers) of many gods, and the mothers, by these gods, of many other gods and goddesses. Doris was the wife of the sea-god Nereus, and the mother of the fifty sea nymphs, the Nereids. Styx was the wife of the Titan Pallas, and the mother of Zelus, Nike, Kratos, and Bia. Eurynome, Zeus&#x27; third wife, was the mother of the Charites. Clymene was the wife of the Titan Iapetus, and mother of Atlas, Menoetius, Prometheus, and Epimetheus. Electra was the wife of the sea god Thaumas and the mother of Iris and the Harpies. Other notable Oceanids include: Perseis, wife of the Titan sun god Helios and mother of Circe, and Aeetes the king of Colchis; Idyia, wife of Aeetes and mother of Medea; and Callirhoe, the wife of Chrysaor and mother of Geryon.

Sailors routinely honored and entreated the Oceanids, dedicating prayers, libations, and sacrifices to them. Appeals to them were made to protect seafarers from storms and other nautical hazards. Before they began their legendary voyage to Colchis in search of the Golden Fleece, the Argonauts made an offering of flour, honey, and sea to the ocean deities, sacrificed bulls to them, and entreated their protection from the dangers of their journey. They were also recorded as the companions of Persephone when she was abducted by Hades.

The goddess Artemis requested that sixty Oceanids of nine years be made her personal choir, to serve her as her personal handmaids and remain virgins.

==Names==
Hesiod gives the name of 41 Oceanids, with other ancient sources providing many more. While some were important figures, most were not. Some were perhaps the names of actual springs, others merely poetic inventions. Some names, consistent with the Oceanids&#x27; charge of having &quot;youths in their keeping&quot;, represent things which parents might hope to be bestowed upon their children: Plouto (&quot;Wealth&quot;), Tyche (&quot;Good Fortune&quot;), Idyia (&quot;Knowing&quot;), and Metis (&quot;Wisdom&quot;). Others appear to be geographical eponyms, such as Europa, Asia, Ephyra (Corinth), and Rhodos (Rhodes).

Several of the names of Oceanids were also among the names given to the Nereids.

==The arts==
===Paintings===
As a group, the Oceanids form the chorus of the ancient Greek tragedy &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, coming up from their cave beneath the ground to console the chained Titan Prometheus. There they are described as moving with haste, in contrast to the hero&#x27;s immobility. In his new interpretation of the Greek play&#x27;s continuation, &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; (1820), Percy Bysshe Shelley included three Oceanids among his characters. Ione and Panthea accompany the suffering hero and are joined by his lover, Asia. The setting is in the Caucasus mountains and Shelley describes these characters as winged beings.

Two 19th century artists depicted the mourning of the Oceanids about the rock on which Prometheus is chained, which was interpreted in this case as rising mid-ocean. The first of these was &quot;La Désolation des Océanides&quot; (1850) by Henri Lehmann, presently in the Musée départemental de Gap. The other, titled simply The Oceanids (The Naiads of the Sea) (1869), was by Gustave Doré. Lehmann&#x27;s painting was savaged as lacking in Classical decorum by the critics of the Salon at which it was exhibited; in particular, the nymphs clustered about the sea-girt rock on which Prometheus is chained were compared to &quot;a troop of young seals clambering onshore&quot;. Doré&#x27;s naiads, engaged in the same occupation, were eventually identified more elegantly by Dorothea Tanning as akin to mermaids.

Later artists reinterpreted the nymphs tumbling among the waves, as depicted by both painters, in order to portray individual Oceanids as female manifestations of sea foam. Examples include Wilhelm Trübner&#x27;s study of a female form in a frothy wave (&quot;Weiblicher Akt im Schaum einer Welle&quot;), which he titled &quot;Oceanide&quot; (1872); and William-Adolphe Bouguereau&#x27;s &quot;Océanide&quot; (1904), portraying a nude extended on the shore in the track of the incoming tide, of which a more sympathetic critic of the 1905 Salon noted how the artist delights in comparing a lissom body to the sea&#x27;s undulations. Manchester-born Annie Swynnerton&#x27;s &quot;Oceanid&quot; emerging from the sea was painted the same year and is presently in the Cartwright Hall Art Gallery, Bradford.

===Sculptures===
Sculptures of the subject are comparable to the paintings in some respects. In Johann Eduard Müller&#x27;s marble statue of &quot;Prometheus and the Oceanides&quot; (1868–79), the nymphs scramble upwards in an attempt to alleviate the Titan&#x27;s suffering, as they do in Lehmann&#x27;s canvas. The smaller-scale &quot;Océanides&quot; (1905) of Auguste Rodin cluster like waves breaking at the base of a rock, their &quot;supple feminine forms emerging from rough marble&quot;. A larger scale version of the sculpture was finally cast in bronze in 1925 and is in Philadelphia&#x27;s Rodin Museum.

The fountain at York House, Twickenham concentrates on a purely marine theme and is of much wider extent. This gave the turn of the century sculptor, Oscar Spalmach (1864–1917), the opportunity to drape his white marble Oceanids about the rocks of the cascade in a variety of painterly poses. Henri Laurens created a bronze &quot;Océanide&quot; in 1933 which was equally suited for outdoor display. Largely abstract in conception, the sea connection is suggested by the shell-like wave shape that upholds one of her legs. Several copies of the sculpture exist, displayed in the Middelheim Open Air Sculpture Museum outside Antwerp, the German Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. And in Australia Helen Leete went on to create an equally abstracted group of &quot;Oceanides&quot; in 1997 to mount on the seaside rocks off Manly, New South Wales.

===A tone poem===
A musical interpretation of these mythical figures was the result of the visit by Jean Sibelius to the US in 1914, before which he was commissioned to compose a tone poem. Though this is generally titled &quot;The Oceanides&quot; (Opus 73), Sibelius referred to it in his diary as &quot;Aallottaret&quot;: the Finnish word for &quot;nymphs of the waves&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Cercopes (, plural of Κέρκωψ, from κέρκος (&quot;n&quot;.) &quot;kerkos&quot; &quot;tail&quot;) were mischievous forest creatures who lived in Thermopylae or on Euboea but roamed the world and might turn up anywhere mischief was afoot. They were two brothers, but their names are given variously:

*Passalus (Πάσσαλος) and Acmon (Ἄκμων) or Aclemon
*Basalas (Βάσαλας) and Achemon (Ἄχημων)
*Olus (Ὤλος) and [[Eurybatus (mythology)|Eurybatus]] (Εὐρύβατος)
*Candolus (Κάνδωλος) and Atlantus (Ἄτλαντος)
*Sillus (Σίλλος) and Triballus (Τρίβαλλος)

Accounts of their origins vary depending on the context, but they are usually known as sons of Theia and Oceanus, thus ancient spirits.

==Mythology==
They were proverbial as liars, cheats, and accomplished knaves. They once stole Heracles&#x27; weapons, during the time he was the penitent servant of Omphale in Lydia. He seized and bound them at Ephesus and punished them by tying them to a shoulder pole he slung over his shoulder with their faces pointing downwards, the only way they appear on Greek vases. Their mother, Theia, begged Heracles to let her sons go. This particular myth is depicted on a metope at Temple C at Selinus. According to Pherecydes, the Cercopes were turned to stone.

== As monkeys ==
In another myth, designed to explain their name (&quot;tail-men&quot; in Greek), Zeus changed the Cercopes into monkeys. This story inspired modern zoologists to name the genus of monkeys depicted in Minoan frescoes as &quot;Cercopithecus&quot;.

Monkeys figure in four Minoan frescos at Akrotiri, most famously in the crocus-gathering Xeste 3 fresco, where the monkey&#x27;s ritual aspect, attending an enthroned female, is interpreted by Nanno Marinatos as servants of the divinity, acting as intermediary between humanity and the divine world. Green monkeys appear in Crete itself in the &quot;House of the Frescoes&quot; at Knossos, Monkeys are absent from Greek art. In Minoan art, it is assumed that they were exotic pets: &quot;... the monkeys, which were imported to Crete, were pets that would have been placed where they could be seen and used by their owners, rather than simply abandoned in the countryside,&quot; concluded Shaw (1993). When Greek mythographers attempted to account for the name &quot;Pithecusae&quot; (“Ape Islands”) given to Ischia and Procida by the Bay of Naples, where no monkeys had been seen within human memory, they were reduced to alleging that they must have been deceitful men whom Zeus punished by turning them into apes. When scholars attempted to account for this exotic image they have been forced to search farther afield:
The story of Herakles and the Cercopes has been interpreted as a reminiscence of Phoenician traders bringing apes to Greek markets. See O. Keller, &quot;Thiere des classischen Alterthums&quot; (Innsbruck, 1887), p. 1. The interpretation may perhaps be supported by an Assyrian bas-relief which represents a Herculean male figure carrying an ape on his head and leading another ape by a leash, the animals being apparently brought as tribute to a king. See O. Keller, &quot;op. cit.&quot;, p. 11, fig. 2.

Cline identified the monkey species in 1991 as guenons, or blue monkeys, which have bluish fur over their green skins. Scholars generally assume that the appearance of the blue monkey in Aegean iconography was due to the import of the actual animal from north Africa; they were iconic religious animals in Egypt

<text>Athalaric (; 5162 October 534) was the king of the Ostrogoths in Italy between 526 and 534. He was a son of Eutharic and Amalasuintha, the youngest daughter of Theoderic the Great, whom Athalaric succeeded as king in 526.

Athalaric was about ten years old, so his mother, Amalasuintha, held all the real power. This power was to make decisions about the kingdom&#x27;s politics and negotiate with foreign rulers like Justinian I, at least within the 530s. For example, around 533, she had Emperor Justinian protect the Gothic kingdom. Amalasuintha also controlled the type of education Athalaric would undergo. 

According to Procopius, the Goth aristocracy desired Athalaric to be raised in Gothic, but Amalasuintha wanted him to resemble the Roman rulers. Amalasuintha adhered to Roman learning and customs that were especially objectionable to other Goths, as they saw it as cowardly and submissive. Eventually, Amalasuintha was forced to accept the will of her fellow Goths by allowing Athalaric to spend time with other boys around his age. It is not clear how effective his Roman education was. It is also unknown who his Gothic teacher was, but generally, the Gothic aristocracy in the palace exerted fierce pressure on the monarchy and focused on military education instead of grammar and rhetoric, which would be done in Roman education.

Athalaric drank heavily and indulged in vicious excesses, which ruined his constitution. After a large party in 533, rumors spread that Athalaric was ill. Athalaric condition would worsen, and he died later in October of 534, probably from a combination of excessive drinking and disease, probably diabetes.

<text>In Greek mythology, Ceryx ( &quot;Kērux&quot;, literally &quot;herald&quot;) was a member of the Athenian royal family as the son of Hermes by either the princesses, Pandrosus or Agraulus.

== Mythology ==
Ceryx was, like his father, a messenger. But the &quot;kêryx&quot; career began as a humble cook for the tribe, a skill Hermes demonstrates in his cooked meat offerings on the Twelve Gods Altar set in place in 522 BC by Peisistratos III in Athens. The Homeric &quot;Hymn to Hermes&quot; 128 recalls the young god cutting out and laying up twelve steaks on a flat rock or &quot;platamoni&quot;, the 12 Gods altar.&quot;

According to Pausanias, Ceryx was the youngest son of Eumolpus, one of the first priests of Demeter at Eleusis and a founder of the Eleusinian Mysteries. He founded the two families of high priests in Eleusis: the ceryces (or Ceryces), a family of priests in Athens, and the Eumolpidae.

==Ceryces==

In Homer’s time, ceryx was a profession of trusted attendants or retainers of a chieftain. The role of ceryces expanded, however, to include acting as inviolable messengers between states, even in time of war, proclaiming meetings of the council, popular assembly, or court of law, reciting there the formulas of prayer, and summoning persons to attend. Hermes, himself the ceryx of the gods, was their patron and carried the caduceus (Latin corruption of Ancient Greek &quot;kerykeion&quot;), the herald’s staff.

<text>In Greek mythology, a Cetus () is a large sea monster. Perseus slew a cetus to save Andromeda from being sacrificed to it. The term cetacean (for whale) derives from &quot;cetus&quot;. In Greek art, &quot;ceti&quot; were depicted as serpentine fish. The name of the mythological figure Ceto is derived from &quot;kētos&quot;. The name of the constellation Cetus also derives from this word.

== Etymology ==
In Ancient Greek ketos (, plural &quot;kete/ketea&quot;, ), Latinized as cetus (pl. &quot;ceti&quot; or &quot;cete&quot; = &quot;cetea&quot;), is any huge sea monster.

==Depictions==
A cetus was variously described as a sea monster or sea serpent. Other versions describe a cetus as a sea monster with the head of a wild boar or greyhound and the body of a whale or a dolphin with divided, fan-like tails. Ceti were said to be colossal beasts the size of a ship, their skulls alone measuring in length, their spines being a cubit in thickness, and their skeletons taller at the shoulder than any elephant.

There are notable physical and mythological similarities between a cetus and a drakōn (the dragons in Greek mythology), and, to a lesser extent, other monsters of Greek myth, such as Scylla, Charybdis, and Medusa and her Gorgon sisters.

==Greek mythology==

Cetus are often depicted fighting Perseus or as the mount of a Nereid.

Queen Cassiopeia boasted that she and her daughter Andromeda were more beautiful than the Nereids, which invoked the wrath of Poseidon who sent the sea monster Cetus to attack Æthiopia. Upon consulting a wise oracle, King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia were told to sacrifice Andromeda to the Cetus. They had Andromeda chained to a rock near the ocean so that the cetus could devour her. After finding Andromeda chained to the rock and learning of her plight, Perseus managed to slay the Cetus when the creature emerged from the ocean to devour her. According to one version, Perseus slew Cetus with the harpe lent to him by Hermes. According to another version, he used Medusa&#x27;s head to turn the sea monster to stone.

In a different story, Heracles slew a Cetus to save Hesione.

A Cetus had also been portrayed to support Ino and Melicertes when they threw themselves into the sea instead of a dolphin to carry Palaemon.

==Etruscan mythology==
In Etruscan mythology, the Cetea were regarded as psychopomps, being depicted frequently on sarcophagi and urns, along with dolphins and hippocamps.

Furthermore, the Etruscan deity Nethuns is sometimes shown wearing a headdress depicting a Cetus.

==Bible and Jewish mythology==
===The &quot;tannin&quot; sea monsters===
The monster tannin in the Hebrew Bible has been translated as Greek &quot;kētos&quot; in the Septuagint, and &quot;cetus&quot; in the Latin Vulgate.

&quot;Tanninim&quot; () (-im denotes Hebraic plural) appear in the Hebrew Book of Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Psalms, Job, Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Jeremiah. They are explicitly listed among the creatures created by God on the fifth day of the Genesis creation narrative, translated in the King James Version as &quot;great whales&quot;. The Septuagint renders the original Hebrew of Genesis 1:21 (&quot;hattanninim haggedolim&quot;) as (&quot;kētē ta megala&quot;) in Greek, and this was in turn translated as &quot;cete grandia&quot; in the Vulgate. The tannin is listed in the apocalypse of Isaiah as among the sea beasts to be slain by Yahweh &quot;on that day&quot;, translated in the King James Version as &quot;the dragon&quot;.

===Conflation with &quot;Leviathan&quot; and &quot;Rahab&quot;===
In Jewish mythology, Tannin is sometimes conflated with the related sea monsters Leviathan and Rahab. Along with Rahab, &quot;Tannin&quot; was a name applied to ancient Egypt after the Exodus to Canaan. Joseph Eddy Fontenrose noted that &quot;cetus&quot; was a counterpart of Tiamat-based Medusa, and was modelled after Yam and Mot and Leviathan.

===Jonah&#x27;s &quot;great fish&quot;===
In Jonah 2:1 (1:17 in English translation), the Hebrew text reads &quot;dag gadol&quot; (), which literally means &quot;great fish&quot;. The Septuagint translates this phrase into Greek as &quot;mega kētos&quot; (). This was at the start of more widespread depiction of real whales in Greece and &quot;kētos&quot; would cover proven whales, sharks and the old meaning of curious sea monsters. Jerome later translated this phrase as &quot;piscis grandis&quot; in his Latin Vulgate. However, he translated the Greek word &quot;kētos&quot; as &quot;cetus&quot; in Gospel of Matthew 12:40. The English opts for the former: &quot;For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.&quot;

==In other cultures==
Art historian John Boardman conjectured that images of the &quot;kētos&quot; in Central Asia influenced depictions of the Chinese Dragon and Indian makara. Boardman suggested that after contact with Silk Road images of a &quot;kētos&quot;, the Chinese dragon appeared more reptilian and shifted head-shape; the Pig dragon with the head of a boar compared to the reptilian head of modern dragons that of a camel.

==Ships and sailing==
&quot;Cetus&quot; or &quot;megakētēs&quot; (μεγακήτης) is commonly used as a ship&#x27;s name or figurehead denoting a ship unafraid of the sea or a ruthless pirate ship to be feared. Cetea were widely viewed as misfortune or bad omen by sailors widely influenced by the Mediterranean traditions such as the bringer of a great storm or general harbinger. Lore and tales associated it with lost cargo and being swept off course, even pirates being allied with such creatures so as to become taboo aboard vessels.

<text>In Greek mythology, Phorcys or Phorcus (; ) is a primordial sea god, generally cited (first in Hesiod) as the son of Pontus and Gaia (Earth). Classical scholar Karl Kerenyi conflated Phorcys with the similar sea gods Nereus and Proteus. His wife was Ceto, and he is most notable in myth for fathering by Ceto a host of monstrous children. In extant Hellenistic-Roman mosaics, Phorcys was depicted as a fish-tailed merman with crab-claw legs and red, spiky skin.

According to Servius, commentator on the Aeneid, who reports a very ancient version already reflected in Varro, distinct from the Greek vulgate: Phorcos was once king of Sardinia and Corsica; annihilated in a naval battle in the Tyrrhenian Sea, and then shot down by King Atlas with a large part of his army, his companions imagined him transformed into a marine deity, perhaps a monster, half man and half sea ram.

== Parents ==
According to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Phorcys is the son of Pontus and Gaia, and the brother of Nereus, Thaumus, Ceto, and Eurybia. In a genealogy from Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Timaeus&quot;, Phorcys, Cronus and Rhea are the eldest offspring of Oceanus and Tethys.

== Offspring ==
Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; lists the children of Phorcys and Ceto as the Graeae (naming only two: Pemphredo, and Enyo), the Gorgons (Stheno, Euryale and Medusa), probably Echidna (though the text is unclear on this point) and Ceto&#x27;s &quot;youngest, the awful snake who guards the apples all of gold in the secret places of the dark earth at its great bounds&quot;, also called the Drakon Hesperios (&quot;Hesperian Dragon&quot;, or dragon of the Hesperides) or Ladon. These children tend to be consistent across sources, though Ladon is often cited as a child of Echidna by Typhon and therefore Phorcys and Ceto&#x27;s grandson.

According to Apollodorus, Scylla was the daughter of Crataeis, with the father being either Trienus (Triton?) or Phorcus (a variant of Phorkys). Apollonius of Rhodes has Scylla as the daughter of Phorcys and a conflated Crataeis-Hecate. According to a fragment of Sophocles, Phorcys is the father of the Sirens.

The scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes cites Phorcys and Ceto as the parents of the Hesperides, but this assertion is not repeated in other ancient sources.

Homer refers to Thoosa, the mother of Polyphemus, as a daughter of Phorcys, with no mother specified.

<doc id="79555" wikidata="Q478240" url="?curid=79555" title="Bronte, Sicily">
<text>Bronte () is a town and comune in the Metropolitan City of Catania, in Sicily, southern Italy. The town is situated approximately west-northwest from Mount Etna, on the side of the valley of the Simeto river, and about west from Giarre and Sicily&#x27;s eastern coast. Bronte&#x27;s economy relies mostly on farming, particularly of pistachio nuts. The town was settled and historically inhabited by the Arbëreshë community.

==History==
Bronte&#x27;s name derives from that of one of the Cyclopes in Greek mythology and it means &quot;The Thunderer&quot;. Legend has it that the Cyclopes lived under Mount Etna.

In 1520 Charles V united the twenty-four hamlets of the surrounding area, which formed the town of Bronte. Mount Etna nearly destroyed the town three times, in 1651, in 1832, and finally in 1843.

In 1799, King Ferdinand III created Bronte as a Duchy, and rewarded admiral Horatio Nelson with the title of Duke for the help he had provided him in suppressing the revolution in Naples and so in recovering his throne. As well as being made a Duke, Nelson was given as a fief the Castello di Maniace, which at the time was the remains of a Benedictine monastery. The Castle passed into the Bridport family when the 1st Viscount Bridport married the then Duchess of Bronte, who was Admiral Nelson&#x27;s niece. The Bridports continued to live in the castle until 1982 when the current Viscount sold the property to the Comune of Bronte. Today it is a local tourist attraction in Maniace, and has been restored (including the recreation of ceramic-tiled floors) by the Comune. It is built in the style of an English country house (with formal garden) set in the hills of eastern Sicily.

In 1860, during Giuseppe Garibaldi&#x27;s Expedition of the thousand, there was a citizen&#x27;s revolt. Sicilian peasants had hoped for - and did not get from Garibaldi - reforms from the restrictive conditions imposed by noble landowners. This hope had been reinforced by Garibaldi&#x27;s decree of 2 June 1860 that land would be re-distributed. The southerners revolted in several localities including at Bronte, where 16 were cruelly massacred. Buildings were also set on fire, including the theatre, the municipal archive, other builds andany houses. On August 5, 1860, Garibaldi&#x27;s sent general Girolamo (&quot;Nino&quot;) Bixio with two battalions of bersaglieri to restore order in Bronte. Bixio reached Bronte the next day and repressed the riots. On the 9th trials where hastily setup, which only lasted for four hours and led to the summary executions of six people. The facts and details of the riots and its repression have been the subject of reinterpretation and debate.

==Main sights==
* Castello Nelson – a museum about north from the town center. Originally an abbey (Santa Maria di Maniace) dating to 1174, it has a Gothic-Norman portico and contains a Byzantine icon which, according to tradition, was painted by St Luke.
* Church of the Annunziata (1535)
* Collegio Capizzi (1774–1779)
* Cascata di Balze (underground waterfall), close to Castello Nelson.

<doc id="79560" wikidata="Q6612" url="?curid=79560" title="Charon">
<text>In Greek mythology, Charon or Kharon ( ; ) is a psychopomp, the ferryman of the Greek underworld. He carries the souls of those who have been given funeral rites across the rivers Acheron and Styx, which separate the worlds of the living and the dead. Archaeology confirms that, in some burials, low-value coins known generically as Charon&#x27;s obols were placed in, on, or near the mouth of the deceased, or next to the cremation urn containing their ashes. This has been taken to confirm that at least some aspects of Charon&#x27;s mytheme are reflected in some Greek and Roman funeral practices, or else the coins function as a viaticum for the soul&#x27;s journey. In Virgil&#x27;s epic poem, &quot;Aeneid&quot;, the dead who could not pay the fee, and those who had received no funeral rites, had to wander the near shores of the Styx for one hundred years before they were allowed to cross the river. Charon also ferried the living mortals Heracles and Aeneas to the underworld and back again.

==Name origins==
The name Charon is most often explained as a proper noun from (), a poetic form of () &#x27;of keen gaze&#x27;, referring either to fierce, flashing, or feverish eyes, or to eyes of a bluish-grey color. The word may be a euphemism for death. Flashing eyes may indicate the anger or irascibility of Charon as he is often characterized in literature, but the etymology is not certain. The ancient historian Diodorus Siculus thought that the ferryman and his name had been imported from Egypt. Charon is first attested in the now fragmentary Greek epic poem &quot;Minyas&quot;, which includes a description of a descent to the underworld and possibly dates back to the 6th century BC.

==Genealogy==
No ancient source provides a genealogy for Charon, except for one reference making him a son of , found in the entry &quot;Akmonides&quot; in the lexicon of Hesychius, which is dubious and the text may be corrupt. Neither Pauly-Wissowa nor Daremberg and Saglio offer a genealogy for Charon.

In &quot;Genealogia Deorum Gentilium&quot;, the Italian Renaissance writer Giovanni Boccaccio wrote that Charon, who he identified as the god of time, was a son of Erebus and Night. The idea appears to have originated from the similarity between the names &quot;Charon&quot; and &quot;Chronos&quot; (a connection already made by earlier writers such as Fulgentius), the fact that both are said to be very old, and that the god of old age is said to be the child of Erebus and Night according to Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De natura deorum&quot;.

==Appearance and demeanor==

Charon is depicted in the art of ancient Greece. Attic funerary vases of the 5th and 4th centuries BC are often decorated with scenes of the dead boarding Charon&#x27;s boat. On the earlier such vases, he looks like a rough, unkempt Athenian seaman dressed in reddish-brown, holding his ferryman&#x27;s pole in his right hand and using his left hand to receive the deceased. Hermes sometimes stands by in his role as psychopomp. On later vases, Charon is given a more &quot;kindly and refined&quot; demeanor.

In the 1st century BC, the Roman poet Virgil describes Charon, manning his rust-colored skiff, in the course of Aeneas&#x27;s descent to the underworld (&quot;Aeneid&quot;, Book 6), after the Cumaean Sibyl has directed the hero to the golden bough that will allow him to return to the world of the living:
There Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast;&lt;br&gt;A sordid god: down from his hairy chin&lt;br&gt;A length of beard descends, uncombed, unclean;&lt;br&gt;His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire;&lt;br&gt;A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire.

Other Latin authors also describe Charon, among them Seneca in his tragedy &quot;Hercules Furens&quot;, where Charon is described in verses 762–777 as an old man clad in foul garb, with haggard cheeks and an unkempt beard, a fierce ferryman who guides his craft with a long pole. When the boatman tells Heracles to halt, the Greek hero uses his strength to gain passage, overpowering Charon with the boatman&#x27;s own pole.

In the second century, Lucian employed Charon as a figure in his &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot;, most notably in Parts 4 and 10 (&quot;Hermes and Charon&quot; and &quot;Charon and Hermes&quot;).

In the 14th century, Dante Alighieri described Charon in his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, drawing from Virgil&#x27;s depiction in &quot;Aeneid&quot; 6. Charon is the first named mythological character Dante meets in the underworld, in Canto III of the &quot;Inferno&quot;. Dante depicts him as having eyes of fire. Elsewhere, Charon appears as a mean-spirited and gaunt old man or as a winged demon wielding a double hammer, although Michelangelo&#x27;s interpretation, influenced by Dante&#x27;s depiction in the &quot;Inferno&quot;, shows him with an oar over his shoulder, ready to beat those who delay (&quot;batte col remo qualunque s&#x27;adagia&quot;, &quot;Inferno&quot; 3, verse 111). In modern times, he is commonly depicted as a living skeleton in a cowl, much like the Grim Reaper. The French artist Gustave Dore depicted Charon in two of his illustrations for Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. The Flemish painter Joachim Patinir depicted Charon in his &quot;Crossing the River Styx&quot;. And the Spanish painter Jose Benlliure y Gil portrayed Charon in his &quot;La Barca de Caronte&quot;.

Though named after Charon, the Etruscan death-demon Charun has a different origin and functions, being an assistant to Death as well as psychopomp and guardian, delivering the newly dead to the underworld by horseback or chariot. He is winged, with pointed ears and a hideous and threatening appearance, and has a vulture&#x27;s beak. He is armed with a very large hammer, with which to &quot;mercilessly pummel&quot; the dead.

==The Acheron and the Styx==

Most accounts, including Pausanias (10.28) and later Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; (3.78), associate Charon with the swamps of the river Acheron. Ancient Greek literary sources such as Pindar, Aeschylus, Euripides, Plato, and Callimachus also place Charon on the Acheron. Roman poets, including Propertius, Ovid, and Statius, name the river as the Styx, perhaps following the geography of Virgil&#x27;s underworld in the &quot;Aeneid,&quot; where Charon is associated with both rivers.

==In astronomy==
Charon, the largest moon of the dwarf planet Pluto, is named after him.

==In paleontology==
The hadrosaurid &quot;Charonosaurus&quot; is named in Charon&#x27;s honor because it was found along the banks of the Amur River in the Far East.

<doc id="79561" wikidata="Q868738" url="?curid=79561" title="Phlegethon">
<text>In Greek mythology, the river Phlegethon (, English translation: &quot;flaming&quot;) or Pyriphlegethon (Πυριφλεγέθων, English translation: &quot;fire-flaming&quot;) was one of the five rivers in the infernal regions of the underworld, along with the rivers Styx, Lethe, Cocytus, and Acheron.

==Mythology==
According to Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the Phlegethon feeds into the river Acheron, alongside the Cocytus. Plato describes it as &quot;a stream of fire, which coils round the earth and flows into the depths of Tartarus&quot;.

In Orphic literature, in which there are four rivers of the underworld, the Phlegethon is associated with the element of fire, and the direction east.

In &quot;Oedipus&quot; by Seneca the Younger, the first singing of the chorus, which mainly describes the plague that has settled in Thebes, includes the line, &quot;Phlegethon has changed his course and mingled Styx with Theban streams.&quot; While this is not essential to the plot of the play, the line figuratively serves to suggest Death has become physically present in Thebes.

==&quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;==
In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, which is the first part of &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, Phlegethon is described as a river of blood that boils souls. It is in the Seventh Circle of Hell, which punishes those who committed crimes of violence against their fellow men (see Canto XII, 46–48); murderers, tyrants, and the like. By causing hot blood to flow through their violent deeds in life, they are now sunk in the flowing, boiling blood of the Phlegethon. The depth at which each sinner must stand in the river is determined by the level of violence they caused in life; Dante sees Attila the Hun and Alexander the Great up to their eyebrows. Centaurs patrol the circle, firing arrows at those who try to rise above their allotted level in the river. Dante and Virgil cross Phlegethon with help from Nessus.

<text>Cocytus or Kokytos (, literally &quot;lamentation&quot;) is the river of wailing in the underworld in Greek mythology. Cocytus flows into the river Acheron, on the other side of which lies Hades, the underworld, the mythological abode of the dead. There are five rivers encircling Hades: the Styx, Phlegethon, Lethe, Acheron and Cocytus.

== In literature ==
The Cocytus river was one of the rivers that surrounded Hades. Cocytus, along with the other rivers related to the underworld, was a common topic for ancient authors. Of the ancient authors, Cocytus was mentioned by Virgil, Homer, Cicero, Aeschylus, Apuleius and Plato, among others.

Cocytus also makes an appearance in John Milton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. In Book Two, Milton speaks of &quot;Cocytus, named of lamentation loud / Heard on the rueful stream&quot;.

It is also mentioned in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; and in Rick Riordan&#x27;s &quot;The House of Hades&quot;.

Cocytus also appears in Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s poem &quot;Gruppe aus dem Tartarus&quot;: ...&quot;Hohl sind ihre Augen—ihre Blicke&quot;/ &quot;Spähen bang nach des Cocytus Brücke&quot;... (...Hollow are their eyes, their looks / Peering anxiously to the bridge of Cocytus...)

The river is also mentioned in Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s novel &quot;Captain Blood: His Odyssey&quot;, when Colonel Bishop&#x27;s nemesis, Peter Blood, addresses him as follows: &quot;And now, ye greasy hangman, step out as brisk and lively as ye can, and behave as naturally as ye may, or it&#x27;s the black stream of Cocytus ye&#x27;ll be contemplating.&quot;

=== In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;===


In &quot;Inferno&quot;, the first &quot;cantica&quot; of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Cocytus (or Treachery) is the ninth and lowest circle of The Underworld. Dante and Virgil are placed there by the giant Antaeus. There are other Giants around the rim that are chained; however Antaeus is unchained as he died before the Gigantomachy. Cocytus is referred to as a frozen lake rather than a river, although it originates from the same source as the other infernal rivers, the tears of a statue called The Old Man of Crete which represents the sins of humanity. Dante describes Cocytus as being the home of traitors and those who committed acts of complex fraud. Depending on the form of their treachery, inhabitants are buried in ice to a varying degree, anywhere from neck-high to completely submerged in ice. Cocytus is divided into four descending &quot;rounds&quot;, or sections:

*Caina, after the Biblical Cain; traitors to blood relatives. Sinners are frozen up to their necks, allowing them to bend their heads to evade icy winds.
*Antenora, after Antenor from the Iliad; traitors to country. Sinners are frozen up to their heads, so they cannot evade icy winds unlike the sinners in Caina.
*Ptolomea, after Ptolemy, governor of Jericho, who murdered his guests (1 Maccabees); traitors to guests. Sinners lie supine in the ice with their tears completely frozen in their eye sockets so they cannot cry. Here it is said that sometimes the soul of a traitor falls to Hell before Atropos cuts the thread, and their body is taken over by a fiend.
*Judecca, after Judas Iscariot; traitors to masters and benefactors. Sinners are encased completely in ice, contorted into all sorts of different shapes.

Dante&#x27;s Satan is at the center of the circle buried waist-high in ice. He is depicted with three faces and mouths. The central mouth gnaws Judas. Judas is chewed head foremost with his feet protruding and Satan&#x27;s claws tearing his back while those gnawed in the side mouths, Brutus and Cassius, leading assassins of Julius Caesar, are both chewed feet foremost with their heads protruding. Under each chin, Satan flaps a pair of wings, which only serve to increase the cold winds in Cocytus and further imprison him and other traitors. Dante and his guide Virgil proceed then to climb down Satan&#x27;s back and then upwards towards Purgatory. Though Dante is initially confused as to why they are turning round, Virgil explains it is due to the change in forces as they pass through the center of the Earth.

<text>The Strait of Messina (; ) is a narrow strait between the eastern tip of Sicily (Punta del Faro) and the western tip of Calabria (Punta Pezzo) in Southern Italy. It connects the Tyrrhenian Sea to the north with the Ionian Sea to the south, within the central Mediterranean. At its narrowest point, between Torre Faro and Villa San Giovanni, it is wide. At the city of Messina, it is wide. The strait&#x27;s maximum depth is about .

The strait has strong tidal currents that create a unique marine ecosystem. The rock in the town of Scilla, Calabria at the north of the strait and a natural whirlpool in the northern portion of the strait have been linked to the Greek legend of Scylla and Charybdis. In some circumstances, the mirage of Fata Morgana can be observed when looking at Sicily from Calabria. With its bottleneck shape, it is also a compulsory point of transit in the migration of many bird species.

In 1957, a 220 kV overhead power line was built across the Strait of Messina. Its pylons are among the highest in the world. This power line has since been replaced by a submarine power cable, but the pylons remain and are protected as historical monuments (see Pylons of Messina).

On July 10, 2024, Estonian athlete Jaan Roose crossed the Strait of Messina on a slackline spanned between the two Messina pylons. He surpassed the previous longest slackline walk of 2,710 meters and completed a distance of 3,600 meters.

==Bird migration==

The Strait of Messina is a focal point in the migrations of birds every year, who mainly cross the strait to reach their breeding grounds in northern Europe. Due to this form of bottleneck more than 300 species are recorded in the area, which is a major European hot spot for raptors, with a record of 35,000 in one spring.

Among them the European honey buzzard and the marsh harrier are the most frequent, and species like Bonelli&#x27;s eagle and Egyptian vulture are less frequent but regular. In the coastal salt lakes of the Strait of Messina species like glossy ibis, flamingos and black-winged stilt stop to rest. The site is also favorable for observing storks. The Monte Dinnammare and the other Peloritani mountains overlooking the Strait are a natural theatre for birdwatching.

==Marine life==

Due to its unique hydrogeological conditions the Strait of Messina has high levels of biodiversity and multiple endemic species. In its waters there is a strong presence of deep sea fish like the Sloane&#x27;s viperfish which, due to the particular and peculiar currents of the strait, are occasionally found stranded on the shore at sunrise. The strait is also an important point of migration of many species of fish in the Mediterranean Sea.

==Transportation==
A ferry service connects Messina on Sicily with the mainland at Villa San Giovanni, which lies several kilometers north of the large city of Reggio Calabria; the ferries hold the cars (carriages) of the mainline train service between Palermo and Naples. There is also a hydrofoil service between Messina and Reggio Calabria.

For decades, the possibility of building a bridge across the Messina Strait has been under discussion. In 2006, under Prime Minister Romano Prodi the project was cancelled. On 6 March 2009, however, as part of a massive new public works program, Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s government announced that plans to construct the Messina Bridge had been fully revived, pledging €1.3 billion as a contribution to its estimated cost of €6.1 billion Some 3.3 km long and 60 m wide, the bridge would be supported by two 382 m pillars, each higher than the Empire State Building, and accommodate six freeway lanes, a railway (for up to 200 trains a day), and two walkways.

Supporters perceive the bridge as an opportunity for job creation and potential for an increase in tourism to the island. Opponents see it as an ecological disaster, a structure at risk due to especially strong winds and earthquakes (the area having an intense seismic record), and a potential increase in Sicilian and Calabrian organized crime. Berlusconi claimed in 2009 that work would be completed by 2016 although in February 2013, the project was cancelled again.

Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni revived the project with a decree in 2022, with the laying of the first stone planned for 2024; opponents of the project cited an estimate that of the 4.3 million birds that fly through the strait annually, between 17 and 46% risked colliding with the proposed bridge.

<text>SS-GB is an alternative history novel by Len Deighton, set in a United Kingdom conquered and occupied by Germany during the Second World War. The novel&#x27;s title refers to the branch of the Nazi SS that controls Britain. It was first published in 1978.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
&quot;SS-GB&quot; is set less than a year after the British surrender following a successful Operation Sea Lion. In 1940, the Germans landed near Ashford, and Canterbury was declared an open city. The German advance captured London, but a British rear guard around Colchester slowed down the Germans for long enough to enable Royal Navy ships to escape from Harwich. King George VI and Prime Minister Winston Churchill became prisoners of the Germans. The British gold and foreign reserves were shipped to Canada.

In 1941, the British Armed Forces surrendered, Churchill was tried by court-martial in Berlin and executed while the King was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Queen Elizabeth and her daughters Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret escaped to New Zealand while the Duke of Windsor escaped to The Bahamas. A naval officer, Rear Admiral Conolly Abel Smith, formed a British government-in-exile in Washington, DC but struggles to gain diplomatic recognition. Conolly is also forced to fight off an attempt by the Germans to take over the British embassy in Washington.

The United Kingdom still has an unidentified puppet Prime Minister and Parliament, but true power lies in the hands of the German Military Commander GB and the Military Administration Chief GB. Parliament has passed an &quot;Emergency Powers (German Occupation) Act&quot;, giving the German authorities executive power over occupied Britain. There is also considerable interservice rivalry between the German Army, the Schutzstaffel and the Gestapo. Hitler held a victory parade in London while Hermann Göring and Joseph Goebbels were on board the first nonstop Lufthansa flight from London to New York City.

The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact is still in force and the Soviet Navy was given bases at Rosyth, Scapa Flow and Invergordon. The German Propaganda Ministry claims that the Soviet-German friendship is genuine, but cynics claim that Hitler is using the Soviets to counterbalance the Americans. As part of the German-Soviet Friendship Week, Karl Marx&#x27;s body is to be taken from Highgate Cemetery to the Soviet Union. 
Franklin D. Roosevelt is still the US president and Joseph P. Kennedy the American ambassador. The United States is still officially neutral, the Roosevelt administration is seeking to acquire German atomic research from the Bringle Sands Atomic Research Establishment. The United States had also launched an amphibious invasion of the French colony of Martinique after it sided with the regime of Vichy France. British personnel who managed to escape the German occupation have also enlisted in the US Armed Forces.

===Plot===
In November 1941, nine months after a German invasion led to the British surrender, Douglas Archer is a detective-superintendent of London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Criminal Investigation Department at Scotland Yard who works on homicide crimes. His boss is SS &quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Fritz Kellermann, the German head of police forces in Britain. Having lost his wife, Jill, and his home during the German invasion, Archer lives with his son, &quot;Douggie&quot;, at the home of Mrs. Sheenan and her son, Bob. Archer&#x27;s colleagues are Detective-Sergeant Harry Woods and his secretary and lover, Sylvia Manning.

Archer is called to investigate the murder of a well-dressed man at a flat above an antiques shop in Shepherd Market. Although the body has two gunshot wounds, Archer is puzzled by its condition, particularly by what appears to be sunburn on the arm. Archer also finds a prosthetic arm and a return ticket to Bringle Sands, where the Germans have an atomic research facility. Despite stolen identification identifying the man as Peter Thomas, Archer discovers that the man&#x27;s true identity is William Spode, a British atomic physicist in the German atomic program and secretly involved with the British Resistance.

Since the case is linked to the German atomic program, Berlin dispatches SS &quot;Standartenführer&quot; Oskar Huth, who arrives to supervise the investigation. Archer soon finds himself in the middle of a power struggle between Huth and Kellerman that is complicated by interservice rivalry between the SS, German Army, Gestapo and Abwehr. Archer becomes romantically involved with an attractive American journalist, Barbara Barga, who is connected to the British Resistance leader Colonel George Mayhew. He also learns that his colleagues Woods and Sylvia are also members of the British resistance.

During the course of the investigation, Archer foils a plot by Spode&#x27;s brother and Resistance member John Spode to kidnap his son as part of an attempt to blackmail him. Archer travels to the British prisoner-of-war camp that produced the prosthetic limbs and captures John, who signs a confession but claims that William&#x27;s death was a suicide. John then commits suicide with cyanide provided by an Abwehr officer Captain Hesse, who is under orders from his superiors to prevent him from divulging the German Army&#x27;s atomic program to the rival SS.

Archer accompanies Hesse to a meeting with Mayhew and an Abwehr general, where he learns that the British Resistance and the German Army are conspiring to liberate King George VI from SS custody out of mutual interests. The British Resistance plan to smuggle him to the United States to shore up Rear-Admiral Conolly Abel Smith&#x27;s Free British government in exile. Meanwhile, the Abwehr and the German Army want to embarrass the SS and to recover William&#x27;s stolen atomic research. Archer later learns that the research is stored on a piece of film hidden in the prosthetic limb found at the flat.

Later, the British resistance bomb a &quot;German-Soviet Friendship Week ceremony&quot; to repatriate Karl Marx&#x27;s remains from Highgate Cemetery. In response, the Germans impose martial law and detain thousands of Londoners, including Woods and Manning. Woods is detained by the Gestapo, and Sylvia is killed during an escape attempt. Kellerman uses his connections to secure Woods&#x27;s release but forces him to sign a statement compromising Archer.

Archer passes the atomic research film to Mayhew. Together, they travel to an English countryside, where they rendezvous with the American agent Daniel Barga, Barbara&#x27;s husband. Barga and Mayhew negotiate a deal for the Americans to allow the King to enter the US in return for receiving the German atomic research. Huth arrives to arrest the group, but Mayhew makes an agreement with him and departs.

The following day, Archer and Woods receive the comatose George VI from their German Army co-conspirators. They attempt to evacuate him to Bringle Sands in an ambulance, but it breaks down. Archer and Woods turn to Barbara for help, only to find that she has been killed by the Gestapo. With Mayhew&#x27;s help, Archer and Woods manage to take the King to Bringle Sands to meet with a landing party of US Marines, led by Major Dodgson. Despite their efforts, the group is ambushed by Huth&#x27;s SS forces and the King, Barga and Dodgson are killed. However, the King&#x27;s rescue is a diversion for a larger American force to attack the Bringle Sands atomic research facility. The Americans obtain the facility&#x27;s atomic research, equipment and several scientists during the raid, dealing a major blow to the German atomic research program.

Following the loss of Bringle Sands, Kellerman frames Huth for conspiring with Mayhew to rescue the King and allowing the Americans to attack Bringle Sands. Mayhew is pardoned in return for testifying against Huth at his trial. Archer is exonerated of any wrongdoing because of Huth and Woods&#x27;s intervention. Prior to Huth&#x27;s execution, Archer meets with him, who reveals that Mayhew used the King&#x27;s rescue attempt as a diversion for US forces to attack Bringle Sands. With the loss of Bringle Sands, Huth believes that the US will win the nuclear arms race. In addition, Huth reveals that Woods was Kellerman&#x27;s informant, that Kellerman arranged Barbara&#x27;s murder and that Mayhew struck a deal with Huth. Archer comes to realise that Mayhew killed Spode to prevent the Americans from gaining access to his atomic research. He also considers Mayhew as &quot;playing God and writing the future history books&quot;. Rather than presenting the outside world with a pathetic and infirm exile King George, Mayhew deliberately arranged for the King to die a martyr&#x27;s death alongside Americans, eventually bringing the US into war with Germany. Meanwhile, the 15-year-old Princess Elizabeth will be crowned in exile and travel to Washington, DC, to arouse sympathy for the British Resistance.

<text>Philyra or Phillyra (: Ancient Greek: Φιλύρα means &quot;linden-tree&quot;) is the name of three distinct characters in Greek mythology.

*Philyra, an Oceanid and mother of Chiron by Cronus. 
* Philyra, one of the names given to the wife of Nauplius, who was the father of Palamedes, Oiax and Nausimedon. The mythographer Apollodorus reports that, in the &quot;Nostoi&quot; (&quot;Returns&quot;), an early epic from the Trojan cycle of poems about the Trojan War, Nauplius&#x27; wife was Philyra, and that according to Cercops his wife was Hesione, but that according to the &quot;tragic poets&quot; his wife was Clymene.
* Philyra or Phillyra, daughter of the river god Asopus, and the mother of Hypseus by Peneius. Otherwise, the mother of the Lapith king was called Naïs or Creusa instead.

<text>Lemony Snicket is the pen name of American author Daniel Handler (born February 28, 1970) and a fictional character of his creation. Handler has published various children&#x27;s books under the name, including &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, which has sold over 60 million copies and spawned a 2004 film and Netflix TV series from 2017 to 2019 of the same name. Lemony Snicket also serves as the in-universe author who investigates and re-tells the story of the Baudelaire orphans in A Series of Unfortunate Events. 

Snicket is also the subject of a fictional autobiography titled &quot;Lemony Snicket: The Unauthorized Autobiography&quot;. Further telling of Snicket&#x27;s adventures can be found in the four-part children&#x27;s series &quot;All the Wrong Questions&quot;, as well as a pamphlet titled &quot;13 Shocking Secrets You&#x27;ll Wish You Never Knew About Lemony Snicket&quot; (released in promotion of &quot;The End)&quot;. Other works by Snicket include &quot;The Baby in the Manger&quot;, &quot;The Composer Is Dead&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Latke Who Couldn&#x27;t Stop Screaming&quot;, &quot;The Lump of Coal&quot;, and &quot;13 Words.&quot;

In the 2004 film, Lemony Snicket is voiced by Jude Law while James Henderson plays him physically, who documents the events of the film on a typewriter from inside a clock tower. In the video game based on the film, his voice is provided by Tim Curry. In the Netflix series, Snicket is interpreted as a mysterious and omniscient narrator chronicling the events of the Baudelaire children, and is portrayed by Patrick Warburton.

==Characterization==

Within &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, the narrator Lemony Snicket is given his own backstory. He is said to have come from a family of three children. His brother Jacques (who was murdered in &quot;The Vile Village&quot;) and sister Kit were V.F.D. members and friends of the Baudelaire parents. Both Jacques and Kit appear as supporting characters in the books. He also knew Count Olaf in his early life, as the two attended school together. As a child, he was kidnapped and inducted as a &quot;&quot; into V.F.D., where he was trained in rhetoric and sent on seemingly pointless missions, while all connections were severed from his former life, apart from his siblings Jacques and Kit (who were also kidnapped and inducted). Consequently, Snicket attended a V.F.D.-run boarding school in his youth with several other characters from the series. He received later tuition at a V.F.D. headquarters in the Mortmain Mountains and was employed by a newspaper called &quot;The Daily Punctilio&quot; after graduation as an obituary spell-checker and theater critic.

As a character, Snicket is a harried, troubled writer and photographer who is falsely accused of various felonies and continuously hunted by the police and his enemies, the fire-starting side of the secret organization V.F.D. (Volunteer Fire Department). In the organization, he met and fell in love with an associate named Beatrice, to whom he got engaged. He was falsely accused of murder and arson. Eventually, the fallacies grew so much that &quot;The Daily Punctilio&quot; reported his death. Beatrice later moved on and married Bertrand Baudelaire, becoming the mother of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, the protagonists of &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;. Fourteen years thereafter, Beatrice and Bertrand were supposedly murdered in a house fire, leaving the Baudelaire children orphaned and then pursued by Snicket&#x27;s former associate, Count Olaf. Snicket feels indebted to his former fiancée and embarks on a quest to chronicle the lives of the Baudelaire children until they become old enough to face the troubles of the world on their own.
Lemony Snicket has charged himself with the task of researching and documenting the story of the Baudelaire orphans for &quot;many personal and legal reasons&quot;. He traces their movements and collects evidence relating to their adventures. Though he is never specified to have met the children in the book series, in the Netflix adaptation of &quot;The Penultimate Peril&quot; he is confirmed as the taxi driver trying to take the children away from the hotel.

As the series progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that Snicket had known the Baudelaire orphans&#x27; parents well through their connections to V.F.D. However, as mentioned in &quot;The Hostile Hospital&quot; and &quot;The End&quot;, despite all of Lemony&#x27;s research and hard work, he still does not know the current location, position or status of the Baudelaire children. Additionally, it is unclear if he ever met them in the books.

Snicket is frequently disparaging of himself; he has described himself as a coward, and at various points in his novels comments that he would not have been as brave as the Baudelaire children had he been in their situation. He also confesses that he has done things that were not noble, such as the original theft of the sugar bowl from Esmé Squalor. He implied he had a part in the murder of Count Olaf&#x27;s parents, and that Beatrice was involved as well.

In the narration of the books, Snicket describes doing many unusual things in his free time, including hiding all traces of his actions, locating new hiding places, considering suspicious dishes, and researching the perilous lives of the Baudelaire children. He claims to often write himself citations for bravery in an attempt to cheer himself up, but these attempts are always in vain.
== As pen name ==

The name &quot;Lemony Snicket&quot; originally came from research from Handler&#x27;s first book &quot;The Basic Eight&quot;. Handler wanted to receive material from organizations that he found &quot;offensive or funny&quot; but did not want to use his real name, so he invented &quot;Lemony Snicket&quot; as a pseudonym. The name&#x27;s similarity to Jiminy Cricket was &quot;likely a Freudian slip&quot;. Handler told NPR in an interview that &quot;the character of Lemony Snicket, this man who speaks directly to the reader and also who is tangentially involved in the stories that he&#x27;s telling is really more of a character. We just thought it would be fun to publish the books under the name of this character.&quot; Handler has also written or contributed to other works under the Lemony Snicket persona that are not related to &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;. He has stated &quot;there&#x27;s a chance some other matters may take up Mr. Snicket&#x27;s attention, that he may research and publish, but I&#x27;m always wary of making such promises&quot;.

Handler publishes most of his children&#x27;s novels under the pen name, including the thirteen-book &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; series&quot;,&quot; the four-book &quot;All the Wrong Questions&quot; series, &quot;The Baby in the Manger&quot;, &quot;The Composer Is Dead&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Latke Who Couldn&#x27;t Stop Screaming&quot;, &quot;The Lump of Coal&quot;, and &quot;13 Words&quot;.

As Snicket, Handler wrote an introduction and endnotes for &quot;The Bears&#x27; Famous Invasion of Sicily&quot; by Dino Buzzati, his favorite children&#x27;s book, that referenced &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;. &quot;Noisy Outlaws, Unfriendly Blobs, and Some Other Things That Aren&#x27;t as Scary, Maybe, Depending on How You Feel About Lost Lands, Stray Cellphones, Creatures from the Sky, Parents Who Disappear in Peru, a Man Named Lars Farf, and One Other Story We Couldn&#x27;t Quite Finish, So Maybe You Could Help Us Out&quot;, a 2005 McSweeney&#x27;s short story compilation, has an introduction and unfinished short story attributed to Lemony Snicket.

Snicket also wrote &quot;The Composer Is Dead&quot;, a murder mystery designed to introduce young readers to the instruments of the orchestra; it was previously produced as an orchestral work by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, with Handler narrating as Snicket, and a recording of the performance is to be included with every copy of the expanded book.

In 2013, Snicket wrote the introduction to the 1989–1990 edition of Fantagraphics Books&#x27; &quot;The Complete Peanuts&quot; series.

<text>Chloe (; ), also spelled Chloë, Chlöe, or Chloé, is a feminine name meaning &quot;blooming&quot; or &quot;fertility&quot; in Greek. The name ultimately derives, through Greek, from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;&quot;, which relates to the colors yellow and green. The common scientific prefix &quot;chloro-&quot; (e.g. chlorine and chloroplast) derives from the same Greek root. In Greek the word refers to the young, green foliage or shoots of plants in spring.

 was one of the many epithets of the goddess Demeter. The name appears in the New Testament, in 1 Corinthians 1:11 in the context of &quot;the house of Chloe&quot;, a leading early Christian woman in Corinth, Greece. The French spelling is Chloé.

== Popularity ==
The name was a popular Ancient Greek girl&#x27;s name (cf. the Ancient Greek novel Daphnis and Chloe) and remains a popular Greek name today.

It has been a very popular name in the United Kingdom since the early 1990s, peaking in popularity later in the 1990s and during the first decade of the 21st century.

In Northern Ireland, &quot;Chloe&quot; was the most popular name for newborn girls from 1997 to 2002, followed by Emma in 2003. It was also one of the most popular girls&#x27; names throughout the UK from 1995 to 2002. In 2013, it was the fourth-most popular name for baby girls in Australia.

Chloe was among the five most popular names for newborn girls of Asian descent in the American state of Virginia in 2022. It has ranked among the top one hundred names for newborn American girls nationally since 1998, peaking in 2009 and 2010 when it was the ninth most popular name given to girls. It was the twenty-fourth most popular name for American girls nationally in 2021. The name is occasionally misspelled as “Chole”. The United States Social Security Administration noted that a number of parents of girls initially named “Chole” on their birth certificates had filed to correct the spelling to “Chloe” between 2017 and 2022.

In 2022, it was the sixth most popular name given to girls in Canada.

<text>In Greek mythology, the name Chloris (; Greek Χλωρίς &quot;Chlōrís&quot;, from χλωρός &quot;chlōrós&quot;, meaning &quot;greenish-yellow&quot;, &quot;pale green&quot;, &quot;pale&quot;, &quot;pallid&quot;, or &quot;fresh&quot;) appears in a variety of contexts. Some clearly refer to different characters; other stories may refer to the same Chloris, but disagree on details.

* Chloris, a nymph loved by Zephyrus (West Wind).
* Chloris, wife of Neleus, king of Pylos. It is, however, not always clear whether she or the below Chloris is mentioned in this role.
* Chloris, one of the Niobids.
* Chloris, daughter of Orchomenus, married the seer Ampyx (son of Elatus or Titairon), with whom she had a child Mopsus who also became a renowned seer and would later join the Argonauts. The &quot;Argonautica Orphica&quot; calls her by a different name, Aregonis. In some accounts, she mothered Mopsus by Zeus.

<doc id="79575" wikidata="Q311456" url="?curid=79575" title="Orosius">
<text>Paulus Orosius (; born 375/385 – 420 AD), less often Paul Orosius in English, was a Roman priest, historian and theologian, and a student of Augustine of Hippo. It is possible that he was born in &quot;Bracara Augusta&quot; (now Braga, Portugal), then capital of the Roman province of Gallaecia, which would have been the capital of the Kingdom of the Suebi by his death. Although there are some questions regarding his biography, such as his exact date of birth, it is known that he was a person of some prestige from a cultural point of view, as he had contact with the greatest figures of his time such as Augustine of Hippo and Jerome of Stridon. In order to meet with them Orosius travelled to cities on the southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, such as Hippo Regius, Alexandria, and Jerusalem.

These journeys defined his life and intellectual output. Orosius did not just discuss theological matters with Augustine; he also collaborated with him on the book &quot;City of God&quot;. In addition, in 415 he was chosen to travel to Palestine in order to exchange information with other intellectuals. He was also able to participate in a Church Council meeting in Jerusalem on the same trip and he was entrusted with transporting the relics of Saint Stephen. The date of his death is also unclear, although it appears to have not been earlier than 418, when he finished one of his books, or later than 423.

He wrote a total of three books, of which his most important is his &quot;Seven Books of History Against the Pagans&quot; (), considered to be one of the books with the greatest impact on historiography during the period between antiquity and the Middle Ages. Part of its importance comes from the fact that the author shows his historiographical methodology. The book is a historical narration focusing on the pagan peoples from the earliest time up until the time Orosius was alive.

Orosius was a highly influential figure both for the dissemination of information (&quot;History Against the Pagans&quot; was one of the main sources of information regarding Antiquity that was used up to the Renaissance) and for rationalising the study of history (his methodology greatly influenced later historians).

== Biographical sources ==
Despite the importance of his books many questions remain regarding his life, hampering efforts to construct a biography with any certainty. This is particularly true for sources of information regarding his birth and death. However, his life has been widely studied and there are a number of authors who propose dates for both events.

The main biographical references for Orosius come from the writings of Gennadius of Massilia and Braulio of Zaragoza, although his own writings should not be overlooked. In addition, Orosius is mentioned in letters written by Augustine.

== Questions regarding his identity ==

=== Name ===
While there is no doubt regarding his surname of Orosius, there are questions regarding the use of the name &quot;Paulus&quot;. The problem is that it is not completely certain if he used this name or if he was simply called Orosius and whether Paulus has been added with the passing of time. This could have happened given that the initial &quot;P&quot; for &quot;presbyter&quot; (priest) was always placed next to his name, and over time this could have led to the confusion.

However, this idea is flawed as authors writing immediately after Orosius&#x27;s death use the name Paulus. In fact, even Casimiro Torres Rodríguez, one of the main scholars of Orosius&#x27;s life, indicates that Paulus might be his Christian name and Orosius his native name, a theory that cannot be entirely dismissed.

Whatever the truth of the matter this subject has been widely studied and the most current theory is probably that of Pedro Martínez Cavero, another important Orosius scholar.

=== Ó Corráin&#x27;s conclusions ===

Based on a careful reading of the relevant sources, Irish scholar Donnchadh Ó Corráin concluded that:
Orosius, author of &quot;Historiarum Adversum Paganos Libri vii&quot;, was a Briton, born at latest c. AD 375. Taken by Irish raiders, he spent years (c. AD 400) as a captive, held by traders, on the south shore of the Shannon estuary. He escaped and probably reached Galicia before AD 405. Ordained a priest, he served at Bracara (now Braga in Portugal). He corresponded with Augustine and moved to Hippo in AD 414. Sent to the East by Augustine, he played an undistinguished role at the councils of Jerusalem and Diospolis (AD 415). He settled at Carthage, where he wrote his main work, originally at the instigation of Augustine. He disappears after a voyage to the Balearic Islands. His is the first textual witness to Christianity in Ireland, observed c. AD 400, written up in AD 416–17.

=== Birthplace ===

The subject of his birthplace is still disputed although a broad consensus has now been reached. Basically there are four theories regarding his birthplace, that can be summarised as follows:

* &quot;Born in Braga&quot;: this idea is most widely accepted as it has the most evidence supporting it. If he was not born in Braga, it is likely he was born in the area around the town. This idea is supported by Orosius&#x27;s own works and two letters written by Augustine, the 166th and the 169th.
* &quot;Born in Tarragona&quot;: this theory has been put forward because in his &quot;Histories&quot; Orosius talks of &quot;Tarraconem nostra&quot; (our Tarragona). The 19th-century author Teodoro de Mörner held this opinion, but nowadays it does not seem reasonable to support the idea solely based on one indication.
* &quot;Originated in A Coruña (Brigantia)&quot;: this is a relatively new theory solely based on the fact that Orosius twice mentioned it in the geographical section of his &quot;Histories&quot;.
* &quot;Originated in Brittany&quot;: like the previous theory the supporting data for this theory rests on the fact that Orosius had some knowledge of this area.

=== Date of birth ===
Lastly, his supposed date of birth varies between sources, however, a likely date has now been calculated. It is known for certain that in 415 Augustine referred to Paulus Orosius as &quot;a young priest&quot;, which means that at that time he could not have been older than 40, as he was young, and he had to be older than 30, as he was a priest.

Therefore, his date of birth can be fixed as being between 375 and 385, although the most widely accepted date is considered to be 383. This assumes that when Orosius met Augustine he was 32 years old, that is, he had been an ordained priest for two years.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Despite the scarcity of sources, if his date of birth is accepted as that given above or at least within the window between 375 and 385 it can be seen that Orosius grew up during a period of cultural flourishing, contemporary with Hydatius and Avitus of Braga. Priscillianism was an important doctrine at this time and it is considered likely that after entering the priesthood he took an interest in the Priscillianist controversy, which was being widely debated in his native country.

The classical theories suggest that Orosius belonged to a family with good social standing, which would have allowed him to gain a good education. This would have developed along Christian lines, although assuming that Orosius was born in Braga, he would also have had a good knowledge of the rural culture of that time.

Contemporary histories indicate that from an early age Orosius was loquacious and erudite, alluding to statements to this effect made by both Augustine and Pope Gelasius I. In any case, any discussion of Orosius&#x27;s youth is pure speculation and conjecture because, as discussed above, there is little knowledge regarding this period of his life.

=== Journey to Africa ===
It is thought that Paulus Orosius lived in Gallaecia (northwest Hispania) until 409, but after that time and up until 415, there is no concrete information regarding his life. The traditional chronology, or at least the most widespread, proposes the succession of events outlined in the following paragraphs.

It appears that Orosius had to leave Braga as a result of the barbarian invasions of the Roman Empire. The date of his departure is in some doubt, however, what is known for certain is that he had to leave suddenly. This is even confirmed by Orosius himself who states that he was pursued onto the beach from which he set sail.

A number of dates have been suggested for his departure from Braga, ranging from 409 to 414. The two most widely accepted dates are:

* 410: proposed by G. Fainck. This date means that Orosius had a window of 5 years for his collaboration with Augustine before he travelled to Palestine.
* 414: which is the most widely accepted. In his book &quot;Commonitorium&quot;, which was published in 414, Orosius talks of his arrival, his meeting with Augustine etc.

What is certain is that once Orosius had left the Iberian Peninsula he was certain that his destination was Hippo (now Annaba in Algeria), and a meeting with Augustine, who was the greatest thinker of his time. From his arrival Orosius formed part of a team that worked alongside Augustine. It is therefore possible that Orosius collaborated in the writing of &quot;The City of God&quot; or at the least that he was aware of the book.

In 415 Augustine entrusted Orosius with the task of travelling to Palestine to meet with the thinker Jerome who at that time was living in Bethlehem. This indicates that Augustine had a great deal of faith in Orosius as relations between Augustine and Jerome had not always been good.

=== Journeys to Palestine ===
The visit to Palestine had a double purpose: Orosius wanted to discuss a number of theological topics with Jerome, particularly those relating to the soul&#x27;s origins, and Augustine wanted closer ties with the thinker and to gather information regarding the Priscillianists, Origenists and the Pelagian heresy.

In reality, it would seem that Orosius&#x27;s main task was to assist Jerome and others against Pelagius, who, after the synod of Carthage in 411, had been living in Palestine, and finding some acceptance there. Orosius met with Pelagius on Augustine&#x27;s behalf and he represented the orthodox party against the Pelagians at the Synod of Jerusalem that was held in June 415.

At the synod Orosius communicated the decisions of the synod of Carthage and read several of Augustine&#x27;s writings against Pelagius. Success, however, was not achieved among Greeks who did not understand Latin, and whose sense of reverence was unfazed by Pelagius&#x27;s famous question, &quot;Et quis est mihi Augustinus?&quot; (&quot;Who is Augustine to me?&quot;).

Orosius succeeded only in obtaining John&#x27;s consent to send letters and deputies to Pope Innocent I of Rome; and, after having waited long enough to learn the unfavourable decision of the Synod of Diospolis (Lydda) in December of the same year, he returned to North Africa,

Orosius had a confrontation with the Archbishop of Jerusalem, John II at the synod, in which Orosius was accused of heresy in front of the entire conclave. As his defence Orosius wrote his second book &quot;Liber Apologeticus&quot;, in which he emphatically rejected the accusation.

Orosius&#x27;s first act on meeting Jerome was to hand him the correspondence that he had brought from Augustine. This implies that the journey was always conceived of as a return journey as Orosius would have to deliver the letters from Jerome back to Augustine. In parallel to this, the relics of Saint Stephen were uncovered at the end of 415 and part of the find was given to Orosius in order that he could take it back to Braga. This marks both the start of his return journey and, from our current perspective, a new epoch in Orosius&#x27;s life that is lacking in sources of information for its study.

=== Later years ===
Given that Stephen&#x27;s relics were uncovered on 26 December 415, Orosius must have departed from Palestine after that date. Although his idea was to travel to Braga, he was forced to pass through Hippo as it is known that he delivered letters from Jerome to Augustine, it is also generally agreed that he passed through Jerusalem and Alexandria, although it is not known if he visited the latter on his outward journey, on his return journey or on both occasions.

During his second stay in Hippo he had a long conversation with Augustine during which he handed over the letters he was carrying from Jerome and informed Augustine about the meetings he had had with Pelagius. The idea for Orosius&#x27;s great work, &quot;Historiae Adversus Paganos&quot;, was born during this reencounter with Augustine. However, it is difficult to estimate an exact date for when the book was written and for when the book was finished. This has given rise to a number of theories regarding the writing of the book:

* The traditional theory states that the book was finished between 416 and 417. Support for these dates comes from the fact that the &quot;Liber Apologeticus&quot; does not mention Orosius&#x27;s work as a historian, and the prologue refers to &quot;Book XI&quot; of the &quot;City of God&quot; by Augustine, which was not published until 416. In order to justify how Orosius managed to write seven books in such a short time it is argued that he could have written summaries that were later filled out.
* A recent theory, proposed by Casimiro Torres Rodríguez, states that Orosius briefly stayed in Stridon a second time while trying to return to Portugal, which he was unable to do and he wrote the book during a third stay in Stridon. This would explain why Orosius refers in the &quot;Histories&quot; to events that took place in Hispania in 417.
* A third, older, theory, posed by T. von Mörner and G. Fainck, says that Orosius undertook the work before he travelled to Palestine. In fact, this idea has recently been given a new lease of life by M. P. Annaud-Lindet, although with the proviso that Orosius wrote the book during his return journey from Palestine.

=== Disappearance ===
Very little information is available regarding the life of Paulus Orosius after the publication of his &quot;Histories&quot;. It is known that he was in Menorca where he used the remains of Stephen in attempts to convert members of the Jewish community to Christianity, but the date of his death is not known. This lack of information regarding Orosius could be due to cooling of relations with Augustine, who never makes any clear unambiguous references to Orosius&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot; once they have been published. Gennadius of Massilia considers that Orosius lived at least until the end of the Roman emperor Honorius’ reign, which lasted until 423. However, there is no news of Orosius after 417 and it seems unlikely that such an active author would go six years without publishing anything new.

There are other theories, from a sudden death to a range of legends that talk of Orosius&#x27;s final arrival in Hispania and his founding of a monastery near to Cabo de Palos where he ended his days, although this latter idea now seems improbable.

== His works ==

=== &#x27; and &#x27; ===

Although Paulus Orosius&#x27;s most important book was the &quot;&quot;, his other two surviving books must also be taken into account: &quot;Commonitorium&quot; and &quot;Liber Apologeticus&quot;.

The full name of his first book is &#x27; (in ). Its chronology is littered with the same grey areas as Orosius&#x27;s biography. In principle it is a book intended for Augustine and therefore it must have been written before Orosius arrived in Africa, between 409 and 414 as discussed above. The second chronological limit is 415, which is traditionally considered to be the date when Augustine&#x27;s book &#x27; was published, in which Augustine replies to Orosius&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

The book is not only aimed at Augustine but was also preceded by conversations with him. It not only describes Orosius journey to Africa, but also summarises the beliefs of Priscillianism and Origenism, and it asks for Augustine&#x27;s advice regarding these theological issues, thereby exposing some of Orosius&#x27;s theological doubts.

The full name of Orosius&#x27;s second book is &quot;&quot;. It was published at the time of Orosius&#x27;s participation in the Council of Jerusalem in 415. The book is the result of a theological debate during which Archbishop John II accused Orosius of heresy due to his idea that man cannot remain free of sin, not even with the help of divine intervention.

In order to defend himself from these accusations Orosius wrote &quot;&quot;, in which he describes his motives for participating in the synod, he was invited by Jerome, and rejects the accusation of heresy made against him. However, neither of these two books are of a historical nature, despite containing elements that help in the reconstruction of Orosius&#x27;s life.


Paulus Orosius&#x27;s masterpiece is &quot;&quot;, the only history book that he wrote, which gives insight into the historiographical methodology of the Spanish priesthood. It is not possible to be certain as to when it was written as there is no single theory that is unanimously accepted by all historians. The most common estimate places the drafting of the book between 416 and 417.

Miguel Ángel Rábade Navarro offers a clear and concise definition on Orosius&#x27;s history in one of his articles on the author. In this article Rábade calls the &quot;Histories&quot; a &quot;universalist history with an apologetic and providentialist character, whose main aim is to compare a pagan past with a Christian present, through their followers, their actions and their geographical and temporal location&quot;.

Be this as it may, the book had a definite origin and a clear purpose. The book&#x27;s origins were a response to Augustine&#x27;s express desire for a book that would complement his &quot;&quot; which is a history focused on the pagan races. The date of the book is not our main focus here, what is more important is Orosius&#x27;s objective in responding to Augustine&#x27;s request by writing a book aimed at proving that Rome’s decadence – Rome was sacked by Alaric I in 410 – had nothing at all to do with the fact that the Romans had relatively recently converted to Christianity.

In a more general way Orosius wanted to show that the world has improved since the introduction of Christianity rather than declined as others had argued. In response to those who pointed to contemporary disasters, he simply argues that previous disasters occurring before Christianity were much worse. The work, a universal history of the calamities that have happened to mankind was the first attempt to write the history of the world as a history of God guiding humanity.

Throughout the seven books that comprise the history, Orosius introduces several new methods and he also uses others that pick up on the traditional methods of Graeco-Roman historiography. Orosius never offers a negative image of the Pagans, in this way he is being true to the traditions of the Graeco-Roman historians of that time, who always tried to give a positive impression of their &quot;enemies&quot;.

==== Editions ====
The &quot;Histories&quot; have been widely printed, and there are at least 82 surviving copies and 28 incunables from the first printed editions, as well as copies of editions in Italian and German from the sixteenth century. Johannes Schüssler printed the &quot;Historiae&quot; in Augsburg in 1471. Authoritative modern editions are:

==== Influence ====
The assumed falling out of Paulus Orosius and Augustine at the end of the former&#x27;s life does not seem to have had a negative effect on the distribution and impact of his &quot;Histories&quot;. Despite criticisms of his work, Orosius&#x27;s books were considered to be successes from virtually the day of their publication. Nearly two hundred manuscripts of the &quot;Histories&quot; have survived.

The &quot;Histories&quot; were considered to be one of the main works of Spanish historiography right up until the time of the Reformation. This success has, to a large extent, meant that Orosius&#x27;s other works have also been conserved.

&quot;Historiae Adversus Paganos&quot; has been quoted by authors ranging from Braulio of Zaragoza to Dante Alighieri, and was one of the main books used by students of Ancient History throughout the Middle Ages. Via its Arabic translation, it became one of the sources of Ibn Khaldun in his history. Lope de Vega made Orosius a central character in his play &quot;The Cardinal of Bethlehem&quot;, which shows how long-lived his fame was.

== Historical methodology ==

=== Universalism ===
The Universalist nature of Orosius&#x27;s work is perhaps its most notable aspect. In fact, despite the lack of agreement regarding all other aspects of Orosius&#x27;s life, including his biography and his works, most experts agree on the universalist nature of this work, including classicists such as Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo and even more modern historians such as Torres Rodríguez. In addition, his works are not only identified as universalist but as the first Christian universalist history, or put another way, the last classical universalist history.

Paulus Orosius is not only a widely studied author he also described his own thoughts on his historical methodology in some of the prologues to the volumes that comprise his &quot;Histories&quot;. He was always clear in his objectives, he wanted to write the history starting with the creation and leading up to the times in which he lived, which is a clear declaration of his universalist intentions as a historian.

Orosius uses the so-called &quot;succession of the four world empires theory&quot; throughout his works, which traced world history based on the premise that out of the ruins of one great civilization another arose. Therefore, his theory was based on four historical empires, Babylonia, pagan Rome, Macedonia and Carthage, with a fifth empire, that of Christian Rome as the inheritor of all these. In fact, during the narration of their histories the four empires develop in the same way and there are a number of striking parallels between them that are markedly different from Rome, which Orosius praises.

Orosius&#x27;s basic innovation in dealing with the four empires theory was to introduce Carthage between Macedonia and Rome, which is something that scholars such as García Fernández point out as one of Orosius&#x27;s defining and definitive acts.

=== Patriotism and universalism ===
Another important characteristic of Orosius&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot; is defined as patriotism. There are two clearly defined positions regarding Orosius&#x27;s patriotism, a more traditional view espoused by Torres Rodríguez and a more novel view as recently outlined by García Fernández.

Torres Rodríguez’ theory refers to patriotism is the sense that Orosius places special emphasis on the events that took place in Hispania. This is normal given Orosius&#x27;s origins, but it can be thought of not only as patriotism but also as Hispanism. Examples of this tendency include narratives of events in the &quot;Histories&quot;, that occurred in Braga or the fact that Orosius himself was charged with transporting the reliquaries of Saint Stephen. It is even pointed out that Orosius&#x27;s narrations are sometimes used by current day groups of Galician nationalists.

On the other hand, in 2005 García Fernández made an explicit allusion to Torres Rodríguez’ theory when he stated that it was an exaggeration to characterize Orosius&#x27;s historical methodology as &quot;patriotic&quot;. This was a rejection of nearly all of the statements made by Torres Rodríguez on this matter. García Fernández used the idea of &quot;localism&quot;, which was a fashionable idea amongst historians at the beginning of the 21st century. This idea argues that beyond &quot;Hispanism&quot; Orosius shows a &quot;benevolent attitude&quot; to Hispania.

=== Optimism and pessimism ===
Another interesting point is the pessimism with which Orosius deals with certain themes and the exaggerated optimism with which he refers to others. In general he is pessimistic about anything to do with paganism or the past and optimistic regarding Christianity and his present, which is remarkable given the difficult times that he was living in.

These characteristics infuse all the others, it is particularly noticeable in his narration when he places a special emphasis on the suffering of the defeated, and the terrors of war. This characteristic can clearly be attributed to the influence of Augustine, as Orosius is showing us the two sides of a coin in the purest style of Augustinian dualism.

Orosius is thereby able to present the past as a series of adversities with concrete examples, from Noah&#x27;s flood to the shipwrecking of ships in the Mediterranean Sea, and the future as something positive despite the reality of the times in which he lived.

In order to follow a narrative of suffering and tragedy he often concentrated on defeats, which was different from the usual Roman historiography which normally gave pre-eminence to victories. However, from a historiographical point of view this approach led to some inconsistencies, as, in order to bring the reader round to his point of view, Orosius sometimes described myths and legends as if they were historic fact.

Another traditional criticism of Orosius&#x27;s work relates to this dichotomy of pessimism/optimism, which often causes him to offer a narrative that in many ways lacks an objective viewpoint. This divides historians into those that view him as biased and others that reject this criticism and justify his approach by saying that Orosius viewed history in the same way as Christians view life. Put another way, his approach is justified as being founded in the author&#x27;s Providentialist character.

=== Narrative ===
The narrative ability of Orosius should also not be overlooked. The author had a clear objective: that the Christians be defended from the non-Christian Roman&#x27;s accusations that the sacking of Rome in 410 was a reprimand because the Christians had forsaken the city&#x27;s traditional pantheon of gods.

Orosius&#x27;s narrative abilities in forwarding this argument therefore went beyond the pessimism/optimism duality that was discussed in the previous section. His basic idea is that the past is always worse than the present, because it is always further from the true religion.

The fact that he had clear objectives ensured that he wrote his stories with a definite end in mind. Therefore, there are events that he narrated with little detail and others that he presents in full detail. Orosius never seems lacking in sources of information, he even affirms that an historian should be selective with those he has, it rather seems that this difference in level of detail reflects the emphasis that he wants to place on reinforcing his ideas.

The fact that his writing has a moral objective and apologist agenda means that he focuses on unusual events, such as the suffering of the general population during wartime. This selection of facts, in large part, enables him to write about patriotism, for example, as he always pays a lot of attention to events in Hispania.

=== The importance of geography ===
Another important aspect of Orosius&#x27;s work is the importance he placed on geography in his work as a historian. This is shown in his geographic description of the world in the second chapter of the first of the seven books that comprise the &quot;Histories&quot;.

One failing of his geographical descriptions is his imprecision, such as, for instance, when he overuses the noun &quot;Caucasus&quot; to refer to other nearby ranges. Despite this vagueness it is notable that the &quot;Histories&quot; include a chapter on geography. This has lent an increased value to his work in modern historiography, mainly thanks to authors such as Lucien Febvre and Fernand Braudel.

=== Sources used by Orosius ===
The sources Orosius used have been investigated by Teodoro de Mörner; besides the Old and New Testaments, he appears to have consulted Caesar, Livy, Justin, Tacitus, Suetonius, Florus and a cosmography, attaching also great value to Jerome&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Chronicles&quot; of Eusebius.

<doc id="79576" wikidata="Q272918" url="?curid=79576" title="Chronos">
<text>Chronos (; ; , ), also spelled Chronus, is a personification of time in Greek mythology, who is also discussed in pre-Socratic philosophy and later literature.

Chronos is frequently confused with, or perhaps consciously identified with, the Titan, Cronus, in antiquity, due to the similarity in names. The identification became more widespread during the Renaissance, giving rise to the iconography of Father Time wielding the harvesting scythe.

Greco-Roman mosaics depicted Chronos as a man turning the zodiac wheel. He is comparable to the deity Aion as a symbol of cyclical time. He is usually portrayed as an old callous man with a thick grey beard, personifying the destructive and stifling aspects of time.

==Name==
During antiquity, Chronos was occasionally interpreted as Cronus. According to Plutarch, the Greeks believed that Cronus was an allegorical name for Chronos.

==Mythology==
In the Orphic tradition, the unaging Chronos was &quot;engendered&quot; by &quot;earth and water&quot;, and produced Aether, Chaos, and an egg. The egg produced the hermaphroditic god Phanes who gave birth to the first generation of gods and is the ultimate creator of the cosmos.

Pherecydes of Syros in his lost (&quot;The seven recesses&quot;), around 6th century BC, claimed that there were three eternal principles: &quot;Chronos&quot;, &quot;Zas&quot; (Zeus) and &quot;Chthonie&quot; (the chthonic). The semen of Chronos was placed in the recesses of the Earth and produced the first generation of gods.

<doc id="79578" wikidata="Q6507" url="?curid=79578" title="Finnegans Wake">
<text>Finnegans Wake is a novel by Irish writer James Joyce. It has an allusive and experimental style, and has attained a reputation as one of the most difficult works in literature. In 1924, it began to appear in installments under the title &quot;fragments from &quot;Work in Progress&quot;&quot;. The final title was only revealed when the book was published on 4 May 1939.

The initial reception of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; was largely negative, ranging from bafflement at its radical reworking of language to open hostility towards its seeming pointlessness and lack of respect for literary conventions. Joyce, however, asserted that every syllable was justified.

Although the base language of the novel is English, it is an English that Joyce modified by combining and altering words from many languages into his own distinctive idiom. Some commentators believe this technique was Joyce&#x27;s attempt to reproduce the way that memories, people, and places are mixed together and transformed in a dreaming or half-awakened state.

Despite the obstacles, readers and commentators have reached a broad consensus about the book&#x27;s central cast of characters and, to a lesser degree, its plot. The book explores the lives of the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE; the mother ALP; and, their three children Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book follows his wife&#x27;s attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons&#x27; struggle to replace him, and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. Emphasizing its cyclical structure, the novel ends with an unfinished line that completes the fragment with which it began.

==Background and composition==
Having completed work on &quot;Ulysses&quot;, Joyce was so exhausted that he did not write a line of prose for a year. On 10 March 1923, he wrote a letter to his patron, Harriet Weaver: &quot;Yesterday I wrote two pages—the first I have since the final &quot;Yes&quot; of &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Having found a pen, with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of foolscap so that I could read them.&quot; This is the earliest reference to what would become &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.

The two pages in question consisted of the short sketch &quot;Roderick O&#x27;Conor&quot;, concerning the historic last king of Ireland cleaning up after guests by drinking the dregs of their dirty glasses. Joyce completed another four short sketches in July and August 1923, while holidaying in Bognor. The sketches, which dealt with different aspects of Irish history, are commonly known as &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot;, &quot;Saint Patrick and the Druid&quot;, &quot;Kevin&#x27;s Orisons&quot;, and &quot;Mamalujo&quot;. While these sketches would eventually be incorporated into &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; in one form or another, they did not contain any of the main characters or plot points which would later come to constitute the backbone of the book. The first signs of what would eventually become &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; came in August 1923 when Joyce wrote the sketch &quot;Here Comes Everybody&quot;, which dealt for the first time with the book&#x27;s protagonist HCE.

Over the next few years, Joyce&#x27;s method became one of &quot;increasingly obsessional concern with note-taking, since [he] obviously felt that any word he wrote had first to have been recorded in some notebook.&quot; As Joyce continued to incorporate these notes into his work, the text became increasingly dense and obscure.

By 1926, Joyce had largely completed both Parts I and III. Geert Lernout asserts that Part I had, at this early stage, &quot;a real focus that had developed out of the HCE [&quot;Here Comes Everybody&quot;] sketch: the story of HCE, of his wife and children. There were the adventures of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker himself and the rumours about them in chapters 2–4, a description of his wife ALP&#x27;s letter in chapter 5, a denunciation of his son Shem in chapter 7, and a dialogue about ALP in chapter 8. These texts... formed a unity.&quot; In the same year, Joyce met Maria and Eugène Jolas in Paris, just as his new work was generating an increasingly negative reaction from readers and critics, culminating in &quot;The Dial&quot;&#x27;s refusal to publish the four chapters of Part III in September 1926. The Jolases gave Joyce valuable encouragement and material support throughout the long process of writing &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, and published sections of the book in serial form in their literary magazine &quot;transition&quot;, under the title &quot;Work in Progress&quot;. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the book, adding what would become chapters I.1 and I.6, and revising the already written segments to make them more lexically complex.

By this time, some early supporters of Joyce&#x27;s work, such as Ezra Pound and the author&#x27;s brother Stanislaus Joyce, had grown increasingly unsympathetic to his new writing. In order to create a more favourable critical climate, a group of Joyce&#x27;s supporters (including Samuel Beckett, William Carlos Williams, Rebecca West, and others) put together a collection of critical essays on the new work. It was published in 1929 under the title &quot;Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress&quot;. In July 1929, increasingly demoralised by the poor reception his new work was receiving, Joyce approached his friend James Stephens about the possibility of Stephens completing the book. Joyce wrote to Weaver in late 1929 that he had &quot;explained to [Stephens] all about the book, at least a great deal, and he promised me that if I found it madness to continue, in my condition, and saw no other way out, that he would devote himself, heart and soul, to the completion of it, that is the second part and the epilogue or fourth.&quot; Apparently Joyce chose Stephens on superstitious grounds, as he had been born in the same hospital as Joyce, exactly one week later, and shared both the first names of Joyce himself and his fictional alter-ego Stephen Dedalus. In the end, Stephens was not asked to finish the book.

In the 1930s, as he was writing Parts II and IV, Joyce&#x27;s progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors including the death of his father John Stanislaus Joyce in 1931; concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia; and his own health problems, chiefly his failing eyesight.

&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; was published in book form, after seventeen years of composition, on 4 May 1939. Joyce died twenty months later in Zürich, on 13 January 1941.

== Plot ==
&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; consists of seventeen chapters, divided into four Parts or Books. Part I contains eight chapters, Parts II and III each contain four, and Part IV consists of only one short chapter. The chapters appear without titles, and while Joyce never provided possible chapter titles as he had done for &quot;Ulysses&quot;, he did title various sections published separately (see &quot;Publication history&quot; below). The standard critical practice is to indicate part number in Roman numerals, and chapter title in Arabic numerals, so that III.2, for example, indicates the second chapter of the third part.

Given the book&#x27;s fluid and changeable approach to plot and characters, a definitive, critically agreed-upon plot synopsis remains elusive. The following synopsis attempts to summarise events in the book, which find general, although inevitably not universal, consensus among critics.

===Challenges of summary===
Joyce scholars question the legitimacy of searching for a linear storyline within the complex text of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. As Bernard Benstock highlights, &quot;in a work where every sentence opens a variety of possible interpretations, any synopsis of a chapter is bound to be incomplete.&quot; David Hayman has suggested that &quot;For all the efforts made by critics to establish a plot for the &quot;Wake&quot;, it makes little sense to force this prose into a narrative mold.&quot; The book&#x27;s challenges have led some commentators into generalised statements about its content and themes, prompting critic Bernard Benstock to warn against the danger of &quot;boiling down&quot; &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; into &quot;insipid pap, and leaving the lazy reader with a predigested mess of generalizations and catchphrases.&quot; Fritz Senn has also voiced concerns with some plot synopses, saying &quot;we have some traditional summaries, also some put in circulation by Joyce himself. I find them most unsatisfactory and unhelpful, they usually leave out the hard parts and recirculate what we already think we know. I simply cannot believe that FW would be as blandly uninteresting as those summaries suggest.&quot;

The challenge of compiling a definitive synopsis of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; lies not only in the opacity of the book&#x27;s language but also in the radical approach to plot which Joyce employed. Joyce acknowledged this when he wrote to Eugène Jolas that:

&quot;I might easily have written this story in the traditional manner... Every novelist knows the recipe... It is not very difficult to follow a simple, chronological scheme which the critics will understand... But I, after all, am trying to tell the story of this Chapelizod family in a new way.

While crucial plot points – such as HCE&#x27;s crime or ALP&#x27;s letter – are endlessly discussed, the reader never encounters or experiences them firsthand, and as the details are constantly changing, they remain unknown and perhaps unknowable. Joyce himself tacitly acknowledged this radically different approach to language and plot in a 1926 letter to Harriet Weaver, outlining his intentions for the book: &quot;One great part of every human existence is passed in a state which cannot be rendered sensible by the use of wideawake language, cutanddry grammar and goahead plot.&quot; Critics have seen a precedent for the book&#x27;s plot presentation in Laurence Sterne&#x27;s digressive &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman&quot;, with Thomas Keymer stating that &quot;Tristram Shandy was a natural touchstone for James Joyce as he explained his attempt &quot;to build many planes of narrative with a single esthetic purpose&quot; in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;&quot;.

Despite Joyce&#x27;s revolutionary techniques, the author repeatedly emphasized that the book was neither random nor meaningless; with Richard Ellmann quoting the author as having stated: &quot;I can justify every line of my book.&quot; To Sisley Huddleston he stated &quot;critics who were most appreciative of &quot;Ulysses&quot; are complaining about my new work. They cannot understand it. Therefore they say it is meaningless. Now if it were meaningless it could be written quickly without thought, without pains, without erudition; but I assure you that these 20 pages now before us [i.e., chapter I.8] cost me twelve hundred hours and an enormous expense of spirit.&quot; When the editor of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; asked Joyce if the sketches in &quot;Work in Progress&quot; were consecutive and interrelated, Joyce replied &quot;It is all consecutive and interrelated.&quot;

=== Part I ===

The entire work forms a cycle, the book ending with the sentence-fragment &quot;a way a lone a last a loved a long the&quot; and beginning by finishing that sentence: &quot;riverrun, past Eve and Adam&#x27;s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.&quot; Joyce himself revealed that the book &quot;ends in the middle of a sentence and begins in the middle of the same sentence.&quot; The introductory chapter (I.1) establishes the book&#x27;s setting as &quot;Howth Castle and Environs&quot; (i.e. the Dublin area), and introduces Dublin hod carrier &quot;Finnegan&quot;, who falls to his death from a ladder while constructing a wall. Finnegan&#x27;s wife Annie puts out his corpse as a meal spread for the mourners at his wake, but he vanishes before they can eat him. A series of episodic vignettes follows, loosely related to the dead Finnegan, most commonly referred to as &quot;The Willingdone Museyroom&quot;, &quot;Mutt and Jute&quot;, and &quot;The Prankquean&quot;. At the chapter&#x27;s close a fight breaks out, whiskey splashes on Finnegan&#x27;s corpse, and &quot;the dead Finnegan rises from his coffin bawling for whiskey and his mourners put him back to rest&quot;, persuading him that he is better off where he is. The chapter ends with the image of the HCE character sailing into Dublin Bay to take a central role in the story.
I.2 opens with an account of &quot;Harold or Humphrey&quot; Chimpden receiving the nickname &quot;Earwicker&quot; from the Sailor King, who encounters him attempting to catch earwigs with an inverted flowerpot on a stick while manning a tollgate through which the King is passing. This name helps Chimpden, now known by his initials HCE, to rise to prominence in Dublin society as &quot;Here Comes Everybody&quot;. He is then brought low by a rumour that begins to spread across Dublin, apparently concerning a sexual trespass involving two girls in the Phoenix Park, although details of HCE&#x27;s transgression change with each retelling of events.

Chapters I.2 through I.4 follow the progress of this rumour, starting with HCE&#x27;s encounter with &quot;a cad with a pipe&quot; in Phoenix Park. The cad greets HCE in Gaelic and asks the time, but HCE misunderstands the question as an accusation, and incriminates himself by denying rumours the cad has not yet heard. These rumours quickly spread across Dublin, gathering momentum until they are turned into a song penned by the character Hosty called &quot;The Ballad of Persse O&#x27;Reilly&quot;. As a result, HCE goes into hiding, where he is besieged at the closed gate of his pub by a visiting American looking for a drink after hours. HCE remains silent – not responding to the accusations or verbal abuse – dreams, is buried in a coffin at the bottom of Lough Neagh, and is finally brought to trial, under the name Festy King. He is eventually freed, and goes once more into hiding. An important piece of evidence during the trial – a letter about HCE written by his wife ALP – is called for so that it can be examined in closer detail.

ALP&#x27;s letter becomes the focal point as it is analysed in detail in I.5. This letter was dictated by ALP to her son Shem, a writer, and entrusted to her other son Shaun, a postman, for delivery. The letter never reaches its intended destination, ending up in a midden heap where it is unearthed by a hen named Biddy. Chapter I.6 digresses from the narrative in order to present the main and minor characters in more detail, in the form of twelve riddles and answers. In the eleventh question or riddle, Shaun is asked about his relation to his brother Shem, and as part of his response, tells the parable of the Mookse and the Gripes.

In the final two chapters of Part I, we learn more about the letter&#x27;s writer Shem the Penman (I.7) and its original author, his mother ALP (I.8). The Shem chapter consists of &quot;Shaun&#x27;s character assassination of his brother Shem&quot;, describing the hermetic artist as a forger and a &quot;sham&quot;, before &quot;Shem is protected by his mother [ALP], who appears at the end to come and defend her son.&quot; The following chapter concerning Shem&#x27;s mother, known as &quot;Anna Livia Plurabelle&quot;, is interwoven with thousands of river names from all over the globe, and is widely considered the book&#x27;s most celebrated passage. The chapter was described by Joyce in 1924 as &quot;a chattering dialogue across the river by two washerwomen who as night falls become a tree and a stone.&quot; These two washerwomen gossip about ALP&#x27;s response to the allegations laid against her husband HCE, as they wash clothes in the River Liffey. ALP is said to have written a letter declaring herself tired of her mate. Their gossip then digresses to her youthful affairs and sexual encounters, before returning to the publication of HCE&#x27;s guilt in the morning newspaper, and his wife&#x27;s revenge on his enemies: borrowing a &quot;mailsack&quot; from her son Shaun the Post, she delivers presents to her 111 children. At the chapter&#x27;s close, the washerwomen try to pick up the thread of the story, but their conversation is increasingly difficult as they are on opposite sides of the widening Liffey, and it is getting dark. Finally, as they turn into a tree and a stone, they ask to be told a Tale of Shem or Shaun.

=== Part II ===

While Part I of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; deals mostly with the parents HCE and ALP, Part II shifts that focus to their children, Shem, Shaun and Issy.

II.1 opens with a pantomime programme, which outlines, in relatively clear language, the identities and attributes of the book&#x27;s main characters. The chapter then concerns a guessing game among the children, in which Shem is challenged three times to guess by &quot;gazework&quot; the colour which the girls have chosen. Unable to answer due to his poor eyesight, Shem goes into exile in disgrace, and Shaun wins the affection of the girls. Finally, HCE emerges from the pub and in a thunder-like voice calls the children inside.

Chapter II.2 follows Shem, Shaun and Issy studying upstairs in the pub, after having been called inside in the previous chapter. The chapter depicts &quot;[Shem] coaching [Shaun] how to do Euclid Bk I, 1&quot;, structured as &quot;a reproduction of a schoolboys&#x27; (and schoolgirls&#x27;) old classbook complete with marginalia by the twins, who change sides at half time, and footnotes by the girl (who doesn&#x27;t)&quot;. Once Shem (here called Dolph) has helped Shaun (here called Kev) to draw the Euclid diagram, the latter realises that he has drawn a diagram of ALP&#x27;s genitalia, and &quot;Kev finally realises the significance of the triangles [..and..] strikes Dolph.&quot; After this &quot;Dolph forgives Kev&quot; and the children are given &quot;[e]ssay assignments on 52 famous men.&quot; The chapter ends with the children&#x27;s &quot;nightletter&quot; to HCE and ALP, in which they are &quot;apparently united in a desire to overcome their parents.&quot;
II.3 moves to HCE working in the pub below the studying children. As HCE serves his customers, two narratives are broadcast via the bar&#x27;s radio and television sets, namely &quot;The Norwegian Captain and the Tailor&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, and &quot;How Buckley Shot the Russian General&quot;. The first portrays HCE as a Norwegian Captain succumbing to domestication through his marriage to the Tailor&#x27;s Daughter. The latter, told by Shem and Shaun ciphers Butt and Taff, casts HCE as a Russian general who is shot by Buckley, an Irish soldier in the British Army during the Crimean War. Earwicker has been absent throughout the latter tale, having been summoned upstairs by ALP. He returns and is reviled by his customers, who see Buckley&#x27;s shooting of the General as symbolic of Shem and Shaun&#x27;s supplanting their father. This condemnation of his character forces HCE to deliver a general confession of his crimes, including an incestuous desire for young girls. Finally a policeman arrives to send the drunken customers home, the pub is closed up, and the customers disappear singing into the night as a drunken HCE, clearing up the bar and swallowing the dregs of the glasses left behind, morphs into ancient Irish high king Rory O&#x27;Connor, and passes out.

II.4, portraying the drunken and sleeping Earwicker&#x27;s dream, chronicles the spying of four old men (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) on Tristan and Iseult&#x27;s journey. The short chapter portrays &quot;an old man like King Mark being rejected and abandoned by young lovers who sail off into a future without him&quot;, while the four old men observe Tristan and Isolde, and offer four intertwining commentaries on the lovers and themselves which are &quot;always repeating themselves&quot;.

=== Part III ===

Part III concerns itself almost exclusively with Shaun, in his role as postman, having to deliver ALP&#x27;s letter, which was referred to in Part I but never seen.

III.1 opens with the Four Masters&#x27; ass narrating how he thought, as he was &quot;dropping asleep&quot;, he had heard and seen an apparition of Shaun the Post. As a result, Shaun re-awakens and, floating down the Liffey in a barrel, is posed fourteen questions concerning the significance and content of the letter he is carrying. Shaun, &quot;apprehensive about being slighted, is on his guard, and the placating narrators never get a straight answer out of him.&quot; Shaun&#x27;s answers focus on his own boastful personality and his admonishment of the letter&#x27;s author – his artist brother Shem. The answer to the eighth question contains the story of the Ondt and the Gracehoper, another framing of the Shaun-Shem relationship. After the inquisition Shaun loses his balance and the barrel in which he has been floating careens over and he rolls backwards out of the narrator&#x27;s earshot, before disappearing completely from view.

In III.2 Shaun re-appears as &quot;Jaunty Jaun&quot; and delivers a lengthy and sexually suggestive sermon to his sister Issy, and her twenty-eight schoolmates from St. Brigid&#x27;s School. Throughout this book Shaun is continually regressing, changing from an old man to an overgrown baby lying on his back, and eventually, in III.3, into a vessel through which the voice of HCE speaks again by means of a spiritual medium. This leads to HCE&#x27;s defence of his life in the passage &quot;Haveth Childers Everywhere&quot;. Part III ends in the bedroom of Mr. and Mrs. Porter as they attempt to copulate while their children, Jerry, Kevin and Isobel Porter, are sleeping upstairs and the dawn is rising outside (III.4). Jerry awakes from a nightmare of a scary father figure, and Mrs. Porter interrupts the coitus to go comfort him with the words &quot;You were dreamend, dear. The pawdrag? The fawthrig? Shoe! Hear are no phanthares in the room at all, avikkeen. No bad bold faathern, dear one.&quot; She returns to bed, and the rooster crows at the conclusion of their coitus at the Part&#x27;s culmination.

=== Part IV ===
Part IV consists of only one chapter, which, like the book&#x27;s opening chapter, is mostly composed of a series of seemingly unrelated vignettes. After an opening call for dawn to break, the remainder of the chapter consists of the vignettes &quot;Saint Kevin&quot;, &quot;Berkely and Patrick&quot; and &quot;The Revered Letter&quot;. ALP is given the final word, as the book closes on a version of her Letter and her final long monologue, in which she tries to wake her sleeping husband, declaring &quot;Rise up, man of the hooths, you have slept so long!&quot;, and remembers a walk they once took, and hopes for its re-occurrence. At the close of her monologue, ALP – as the river Liffey – disappears at dawn into the ocean. The book&#x27;s last words are a fragment, but they can be turned into a complete sentence by attaching them to the words that start the book: A way a lone a last a loved a long the / riverrun, past Eve and Adam&#x27;s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.

== Characters ==
Critics disagree on whether discernible characters exist in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. For example, Grace Eckley argues that Wakean characters are distinct from one another, and defends this with explaining the dual narrators, the &quot;us&quot; of the first paragraph, as well as Shem-Shaun distinctions while Margot Norris argues that the &quot;[c]haracters are fluid and interchangeable&quot;. Supporting the latter stance, Van Hulle finds that the &quot;characters&quot; in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; are rather &quot;archetypes or character amalgams, taking different shapes&quot;, and Riquelme similarly refers to the book&#x27;s cast of mutable characters as &quot;protean&quot;. As early as in 1934, in response to the recently published excerpt &quot;The Mookse and the Gripes&quot;, Ronald Symond argued that &quot;the characters in &quot;Work in Progress&quot;, in keeping with the space-time chaos in which they live, change identity at will. At one time they are persons, at another rivers or stones or trees, at another personifications of an idea, at another they are lost and hidden in the actual texture of the prose, with an ingenuity far surpassing that of crossword puzzles.&quot; Such concealment of character identity has resulted in some disparity as to how critics identify the book&#x27;s main protagonists; for example, while most find consensus that Festy King, who appears on trial in I.4, is a HCE type, not all analysts agree on this – for example Anthony Burgess believes him to be Shaun.

While characters are in a constant state of flux—constantly changing names, occupations, and physical attributes—a recurring set of core characters, or character types (what Norris dubs &quot;ciphers&quot;), are discernible. During the composition of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, Joyce used signs, or so-called &quot;sigla&quot;, rather than names to designate these character amalgams or types. In a letter to his Maecenas, Harriet Shaw Weaver (March 1924), Joyce made a list of these sigla. For those who argue for the existence of distinguishable characters, the book focuses on the Earwicker family, which consists of father, mother, twin sons and a daughter.

===Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker (HCE)===
Kitcher argues for the father HCE as the book&#x27;s protagonist, stating that he is &quot;the dominant figure throughout... His guilt, his shortcomings, his failures pervade the entire book&quot;. Bishop states that while the constant flux of HCE&#x27;s character and attributes may lead us to consider him as an &quot;anyman,&quot; he argues that &quot;the sheer density of certain repeated details and concerns allows us to know that he is a particular, real Dubliner.&quot; The common critical consensus of HCE&#x27;s fixed character is summarised by Bishop as being &quot;an older Protestant male, of Scandinavian lineage, connected with the pubkeeping business somewhere in the neighbourhood of Chapelizod, who has a wife, a daughter, and two sons.&quot;

HCE is referred to by literally thousands of names throughout the book; leading Terence Killeen to argue that in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; &quot;naming is... a fluid and provisional process&quot;. HCE is at first referred to as &quot;Harold or Humphrey Chimpden&quot;; a conflation of these names as &quot;Haromphreyld&quot;, and as a consequence of his initials &quot;Here Comes Everybody&quot;. These initials lend themselves to phrase after phrase throughout the book; for example, appearing in the book&#x27;s opening sentence as &quot;Howth Castle and Environs&quot;. As the work progresses the names by which he may be referred to become increasingly abstract (such as &quot;Finn MacCool&quot;, &quot;Mr. Makeall Gone&quot;, or &quot;Mr. Porter&quot;).

Some &quot;Wake&quot; critics, such as Finn Fordham, argue that HCE&#x27;s initials come from the initials of the portly politician Hugh Childers (1827–96), who had been nicknamed &quot;Here Comes Everybody&quot; for his size.

Many critics see Finnegan, whose death, wake and resurrection are the subject of the opening chapter, as either a prototype of HCE, or as another of his manifestations. One of the reasons for this close identification is that Finnegan is called a &quot;man of hod, cement and edifices&quot; and &quot;like Haroun Childeric Eggeberth&quot;, identifying him with the initials HCE. Parrinder for example states that &quot;Bygmester Finnegan... is HCE&quot;, and finds that his fall and resurrection foreshadows &quot;the fall of HCE early in Book I [which is] paralleled by his resurrection towards the end of III.3, in the section originally called &quot;Haveth Childers Everywhere&quot;, when [HCE&#x27;s] ghost speaks forth in the middle of a seance.&quot;

===Anna Livia Plurabelle (ALP)===

Patrick McCarthy describes HCE&#x27;s wife ALP as &quot;the river-woman whose presence is implied in the &#x27;riverrun&#x27; with which &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; opens and whose monologue closes the book. For over six hundred pages, Joyce presents Anna Livia to us almost exclusively through other characters, much as in &quot;Ulysses&quot; we hear what Molly Bloom has to say about herself only in the last chapter.&quot; The most extensive discussion of ALP comes in chapter I.8, in which hundreds of names of rivers are woven into the tale of ALP&#x27;s life, as told by two gossiping washerwomen. Similarly hundreds of city names are woven into &quot;Haveth Childers Everywhere&quot;, the corresponding passage at the end of III.3 which focuses on HCE. As a result, it is generally contended that HCE personifies the Viking-founded city of Dublin, and his wife ALP personifies the river Liffey, on whose banks the city was built.

===Shem, Shaun and Issy===

ALP and HCE have a daughter, Issy – whose personality is often split (represented by her mirror-twin). Parrinder argues that &quot;as daughter and sister, she is an object of secret and repressed desire both to her father... and to her two brothers.&quot; These twin sons of HCE and ALP consist of a writer called Shem the Penman and a postman by the name of Shaun the Post, who are rivals for replacing their father and for their sister Issy&#x27;s affection. Shaun is portrayed as a dull postman, conforming to society&#x27;s expectations, while Shem is a bright artist and sinister experimenter, often perceived as Joyce&#x27;s alter-ego in the book. Hugh Staples finds that Shaun &quot;wants to be thought of as a man-about-town, a snappy dresser, a glutton and a gourmet... He is possessed of a musical voice and is a braggart. He is not happy in his work, which is that of a messenger or a postman; he would rather be a priest.&quot; Shaun&#x27;s sudden and somewhat unexpected promotion to the book&#x27;s central character in Part III is explained by Tindall with the assertion that &quot;having disposed of old HCE, Shaun is becoming the new HCE.&quot;

Like their father, Shem and Shaun are referred to by different names throughout the book, such as &quot;Caddy and Primas&quot;; &quot;Mercius&quot; and &quot;Justius&quot;; &quot;Dolph and Kevin&quot;; and &quot;Jerry and Kevin&quot;. These twins are contrasted in the book by allusions to sets of opposing twins and enemies in literature, mythology and history; such as Set and Horus of the Osiris story; the biblical pairs Jacob and Esau, Cain and Abel, and Saint Michael and the Devil – equating Shaun with &quot;Mick&quot; and Shem with &quot;Nick&quot; – as well as Romulus and Remus. They also represent the oppositions of time and space, and tree and stone.

===Minor characters===

The most commonly recurring characters outside of the Earwicker family are the four old men known collectively as &quot;Mamalujo&quot; (a conflation of their names: Matt Gregory, Marcus Lyons, Luke Tarpey and Johnny Mac Dougall). These four most commonly serve as narrators, but they also play a number of active roles in the text, such as when they serve as the judges in the court case of I.4, or as the inquisitors who question Yawn in III.4. Tindall summarises the roles that these old men play as those of the Four Masters, the Four Evangelists, and the four Provinces of Ireland ( &quot;Matthew, from the north, is Ulster; Mark, from the south, is Munster; Luke, from the east, is Leinster; and John, from the west, is Connaught&quot;). According to Finn Fordham, Joyce related to his daughter-in-law Helen Fleischmann that &quot;Mamalujo&quot; also represented Joyce&#x27;s own family, namely his wife Nora (mama), daughter Lucia (lu), and son Giorgio (jo).

In addition to the four old men, there are a group of twelve unnamed men who always appear together, and serve as the customers in Earwicker&#x27;s pub, gossipers about his sins, jurors at his trial and mourners at his wake. The Earwicker household also includes two cleaning staff: Kate, the maid, and Joe, who is by turns handyman and barman in Earwicker&#x27;s pub. Tindall considers these characters to be older versions of ALP and HCE. Kate often plays the role of museum curator, as in the &quot;Willingdone Museyroom&quot; episode of 1.1, and is recognisable by her repeated motif &quot;Tip! Tip!&quot; Joe is often also referred to by the name &quot;Sackerson&quot;, and Kitcher describes him as &quot;a figure sometimes playing the role of policeman, sometimes... a squalid derelict, and most frequently the odd-job man of HCE&#x27;s inn, Kate&#x27;s male counterpart, who can ambiguously indicate an older version of HCE.&quot;

==Major themes==
Fargnoli and Gillespie suggest that the book&#x27;s opening chapter &quot;introduces [the] major themes and concerns of the book&quot;, and enumerate these as &quot;Finnegan&#x27;s fall, the promise of his resurrection, the cyclical structure of time and history (dissolution and renewal), tragic love as embodied in the story of Tristan and Iseult, the motif of the warring brothers, the personification of the landscape and the question of Earwicker&#x27;s crime in the park, the precise nature of which is left uncertain throughout the &quot;Wake&quot;.&quot; Such a view finds general critical consensus, viewing the vignettes as allegorical appropriations of the book&#x27;s characters and themes; for example, Schwartz argues that &quot;The Willingdone Museyroom&quot; episode represents the book&#x27;s &quot;archetypal family drama in military-historical terms.&quot; Joyce himself referred to the chapter as a &quot;prelude&quot;, and as an &quot;air photograph of Irish history, a celebration of the dim past of Dublin.&quot; Riquelme finds that &quot;passages near the book&#x27;s beginning and its ending echo and complement one another&quot;, and Fargnoli and Gillespie representatively argue that the book&#x27;s cyclical structure echoes the themes inherent within, that &quot;the typologies of human experience that Joyce identifies [in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;] are... essentially cyclical, that is, patterned and recurrent; in particular, the experiences of birth, guilt, judgment, sexuality, family, social ritual and death recur throughout the &quot;Wake&quot;&quot;. In a similar enumeration of themes, Tindall argues that &quot;rise and fall and rise again, sleeping and waking, death and resurrection, sin and redemption, conflict and appeasement, and, above all, time itself... are the matter of Joyce&#x27;s essay on man.&quot;

Henkes and Bindervoet generally summarise the critical consensus when they argue that, between the thematically indicative opening and closing chapters, the book concerns &quot;two big questions&quot; which are never resolved: what is the nature of protagonist HCE&#x27;s secret sin, and what was the letter, written by his wife ALP, about? HCE&#x27;s unidentifiable sin has most generally been interpreted as representing man&#x27;s original sin as a result of the Fall of Man. Anthony Burgess sees HCE, through his dream, trying &quot;to make the whole of history swallow up his guilt for him&quot; and to this end &quot;HCE has, so deep in his sleep, sunk to a level of dreaming in which he has become a collective being rehearsing the collective guilt of man.&quot; Fargnoli and Gillespie argue that although undefined, &quot;Earwicker&#x27;s alleged crime in the Park&quot; appears to have been of a &quot;voyeuristic, sexual, or scatological nature&quot;. ALP&#x27;s letter appears a number of times throughout the book, in a number of different forms, and as its contents cannot be definitively delineated, it is usually believed to be both an exoneration of HCE, and an indictment of his sin. Herring argues that &quot;[t]he effect of ALP&#x27;s letter is precisely the opposite of her intent... the more ALP defends her husband in her letter, the more scandal attaches to him.&quot; Patrick A. McCarthy argues that &quot;it is appropriate that the waters of the Liffey, representing Anna Livia, are washing away the evidence of Earwicker&#x27;s sins as [the washerwomen speak, in chapter I.8] for (they tell us) she takes on her husband&#x27;s guilt and redeems him; alternately she is tainted with his crimes and regarded as an accomplice&quot;.

==Style==

=== Language ===

Joyce invented a unique polyglot-language or &quot;idioglossia&quot; solely for the purpose of this work. This language is composed of composite words from some sixty to seventy world languages, combined to form puns, or portmanteau words and phrases intended to convey several layers of meaning at once. Senn has labelled &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;&#x27;s language as &quot;polysemetic&quot;, and Tindall as an &quot;Arabesque&quot;. Norris describes it as a language which &quot;like poetry, uses words and images which can mean several, often contradictory, things at once&quot; The style has also been compared to rumour and gossip, especially in the way the writing subverts notions of political and scholarly authority. An early review of the book argued that Joyce was attempting &quot;to employ language as a new medium, breaking down all grammatical usages, all time space values, all ordinary conceptions of context... the theme is the language and the language the theme, and a language where every association of sound and free association is exploited.&quot; Seconding this analysis of the book&#x27;s emphasis on form over content, Paul Rosenfeld reviewed &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; in 1939 with the suggestion that &quot;the writing is not so much about something as it is that something itself [..] in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; the style, the essential qualities and movement of the words, their rhythmic and melodic sequences, and the emotional color of the page are the main representatives of the author&#x27;s thought and feeling. The accepted significations of the words are secondary.&quot;

While commentators emphasize how this manner of writing can communicate multiple levels of meaning simultaneously, Hayman and Norris contend that its purpose is as much to obscure and disable meaning as to expand it. Hayman writes that access to the work&#x27;s &quot;tenuous narratives&quot; may be achieved only through &quot;the dense weave of a language designed as much to shield as to reveal them.&quot; Norris argues that Joyce&#x27;s language is &quot;devious&quot; and that it &quot;conceals and reveals secrets.&quot; Allen B. Ruch has dubbed Joyce&#x27;s new language &quot;dreamspeak,&quot; and describes it as &quot;a language that&#x27;s basically English, but extremely malleable and all-inclusive, a fusion of portmanteau words, stylistic parodies, and complex puns.&quot; Although much has been made of the numerous world languages employed in the book&#x27;s composite language, most of the more obscure languages appear only seldom in small clusters, and most agree with Ruch that the latent sense of the language, however manifestly obscure, is &quot;basically English&quot;. Burrell also finds that Joyce&#x27;s thousands of neologisms are &quot;based on the same etymological principles as standard English.&quot; The &quot;Wake&quot;&#x27;s language is not entirely unique in literature; for example critics have seen its use of portmanteaus and neologisms as an extension of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;.

Although Joyce died shortly after the publication of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, during the work&#x27;s composition the author made a number of statements concerning his intentions in writing in such an original manner. In a letter to Max Eastman, for example, Joyce suggested that his decision to employ such a unique and complex language was a direct result from his attempts to represent the night: In writing of the night I really could not, I felt I could not, use words in their ordinary connections. Used that way they do not express how things are in the night, in the different stages – the conscious, then semi-conscious, then unconscious. I found that it could not be done with words in their ordinary relations and connections. When morning comes of course everything will be clear again... I&#x27;ll give them back their English language. I&#x27;m not destroying it for good. Joyce is also reported as having told Arthur Power that &quot;what is clear and concise can&#x27;t deal with reality, for to be real is to be surrounded by mystery.&quot; On the subject of the vast number of puns employed in the work Joyce argued to Frank Budgen that &quot;after all, the Holy Roman Catholic Apostolic Church was built on a pun. It ought to be good enough for me&quot;, and to the objection of triviality he replied &quot;Yes. Some of the means I use are trivial – and some are quadrivial.&quot; A great many of the book&#x27;s puns are etymological in nature. Sources tell us that Joyce relished delving into the history and the changing meanings of words, his primary source being &quot;An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language&quot; by the Rev. Walter W. Skeat (Oxford, at the Clarendon Press; 1879). For example, one of the first entries in Skeat is for the letter A, which begins: &quot;...(1) adown; (2) afoot; (3) along; (4) arise; (5) achieve; (6) avert; (7) amend; (8) alas; (9) abyss...&quot; Further in the entry, Skeat writes: &quot;These prefixes are discussed at greater length under the headings Of, On, Along, Arise... Alas, Aware, Avast...&quot; It seems likely that these strings of words prompted Joyce to finish the &quot;Wake&quot; with a sentence fragment that included the words: &quot;...a way a lone a last a loved a long...&quot;

Samuel Beckett collected words from foreign languages on cards for Joyce to use, and, as Joyce&#x27;s eyesight worsened, wrote down the text from his dictation. Beckett described and defended the writing style of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; thus: &quot;This writing that you find so obscure is a quintessential extraction of language and painting and gesture, with all the inevitable clarity of the old inarticulation. Here is the savage economy of hieroglyphics&quot;.

Faced with the obstacles to be surmounted in &quot;understanding&quot; Joyce&#x27;s text, a handful of critics have suggested readers focus on the rhythm and sound of the language, rather than solely on &quot;meaning.&quot; As early as 1929, Eugène Jolas stressed the importance of the aural and musical dimensions of the work. In his contribution to &quot;Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress&quot;, Jolas wrote:

Those who have heard Mr. Joyce read aloud from &quot;Work in Progress&quot; know the immense rhythmic beauty of his technique. It has a musical flow that flatters the ear, that has the organic structure of works of nature, that transmits painstakingly every vowel and consonant formed by his ear.

===A reconstruction of nocturnal life===

Throughout the book&#x27;s seventeen-year gestation, Joyce stated that with &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; he was attempting to &quot;reconstruct the nocturnal life&quot;, and that the book was his &quot;experiment in interpreting &#x27;the dark night of the soul&#x27;.&quot; According to Ellmann, Joyce stated to Edmond Jaloux that &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; would be written &quot;to suit the esthetic of the dream, where the forms prolong and multiply themselves&quot;, and once informed a friend that &quot;he conceived of his book as the dream of old Finn, lying in death beside the river Liffey and watching the history of Ireland and the world – past and future – flow through his mind like flotsam on the river of life.&quot; While pondering the generally negative reactions to the book Joyce said: I can&#x27;t understand some of my critics, like Pound or Miss Weaver, for instance. They say it&#x27;s &quot;obscure&quot;. They compare it, of course, with &quot;Ulysses&quot;. But the action of &quot;Ulysses&quot; was chiefly during the daytime, and the action of my new work takes place chiefly at night. It&#x27;s natural things should not be so clear at night, isn&#x27;t it now? 

Joyce&#x27;s claims to be representing the night and dreams have been accepted and questioned with greater and lesser credulity. Supporters of the claim have pointed to Part IV as providing its strongest evidence, as when the narrator asks &quot;You mean to see we have been hadding a sound night&#x27;s sleep?&quot;, and later concludes that what has gone before has been &quot;a long, very long, a dark, very dark... scarce endurable... night&quot;. Tindall refers to Part IV as &quot;a chapter of resurrection and waking up&quot;, and McHugh finds that the chapter contains &quot;particular awareness of events going on offstage, connected with the arrival of dawn and the waking process which terminates the sleeping process of [&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;].&quot;

This conceptualisation of the &quot;Wake&quot; as a dream is a point of contention for some. Harry Burrell, representative of this view, argues that &quot;one of the most overworked ideas is that &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is about a dream. It is not, and there is no dreamer.&quot; Burrell argues that the theory is an easy way out for &quot;critics stymied by the difficulty of comprehending the novel and the search for some kind of understanding of it.&quot;

Harriet Weaver was among the first to suggest that the dream was not that of any one dreamer, but was rather an analysis of the process of dreaming itself. In a letter to James S. Atherton she wrote: In particular their ascription of the whole thing to a dream of HCE seems to me nonsensical. My view is that Mr. Joyce did not intend the book to be looked upon as the dream of any one character, but that he regarded the dream form with its shiftings and changes and chances as a convenient device, allowing the freest scope to introduce any material he wished—and suited to a night-piece. Bernard Benstock also argued that &quot;The Dreamer in the &quot;Wake&quot; is more than just a single individual, even if one assumes that on the literal level we are viewing the dream of publican H. C. Earwicker.&quot;

Other critics have been more skeptical of the concept of identifying the dreamer of the book&#x27;s narrative. Clive Hart argues that &quot;[w]hatever our conclusions about the identity of the dreamer, and no matter how many varied caricatures of him we may find projected into the dream, it is clear that he must always be considered as essentially external to the book, and should be left there. Speculation about the &#x27;real person&#x27; behind the guises of the dream-surrogates or about the function of the dream in relation to the unresolved stresses of this hypothetical mind is fruitless, for the tensions and psychological problems in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; concern the dream-figures living within the book itself.&quot;

=== Allusions ===

&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; incorporates a high number of intertextual allusions and references to other texts; Parrinder refers to it as &quot;a remarkable example of intertextuality&quot; containing a &quot;wealth of literary reference.&quot; Among the most prominent are the Irish ballad &quot;Finnegan&#x27;s Wake&quot; from which the book takes its name, Italian philosopher Giovanni Battista Vico&#x27;s &quot;La Scienza Nuova&quot;, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the plays of Shakespeare, and religious texts such as the Bible and Qur&#x27;an. These allusions, rather than directly quoting or referencing a source, normally enter the text in a contorted fashion, often through humorous plays on words. For example, Hamlet Prince of Denmark becomes &quot;Camelot, prince of dinmurk&quot; and the Epistle to the Hebrews becomes a &quot;farced epistol to the hibruws&quot;.

The book begins with one such allusion to Vico&#x27;s &quot;New Science&quot;: &quot;riverrun, past Eve and Adam&#x27;s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs&quot;.

&quot;Commodius vicus&quot; refers to Giambattista Vico (1668–1744), who proposed a theory of cyclical history in his work &quot;La Scienza Nuova&quot; (&quot;The New Science&quot;). Vico argued that the world was coming to the end of the last of three ages, these being the age of gods, the age of heroes, and the age of humans. These ideas recur throughout &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, informing the book&#x27;s four-part structure. Vico&#x27;s name appears a number of times throughout the &quot;Wake&quot;, indicating the work&#x27;s debt to his theories, such as &quot;The Vico road goes round and round to meet where terms begin&quot;. That a reference to Vico&#x27;s cyclical theory of history is to be found in the opening sentence which is a continuation of the book&#x27;s closing sentence – thus making the work cyclical in itself – creates the relevance of such an allusion.

One of the sources Joyce drew from is the Ancient Egyptian story of Osiris, and the Egyptian &quot;Book of the Dead,&quot; a collection of spells and invocations. Bishop asserts that &quot;it is impossible to overlook the vital presence of the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, which refers to ancient Egypt in countless tags and allusions.&quot; Joyce uses the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, &quot;because it is a collection of the incantations for the resurrection and rebirth of the dead on the burial&quot;. At one of their final meetings, Joyce suggested to Frank Budgen that he write an article about &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, entitling it &quot;James Joyce&#x27;s Book of the Dead&quot;. Budgen followed Joyce&#x27;s advice with his paper &quot;Joyce&#x27;s Chapters of Going Forth by Day&quot;, highlighting many of the allusions to Egyptian mythology in the book.

The Tristan and Iseult legend – a tragic love triangle between the Irish princess Iseult, the Cornish knight Tristan and his uncle King Mark – is also oft alluded to in the work, particularly in II.4. Fargnoli and Gillespie argue that &quot;various themes and motifs throughout &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, such as the cuckoldry of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker (a King Mark figure) and Shaun&#x27;s attempts at seducing Issy, relate directly to Tristan and Isolde ... other motifs relating to Earwicker&#x27;s loss of authority, such as the forces usurping his parental status, are also based on Tristan and Isolde.&quot;

The book also alludes heavily to Irish mythology, with HCE sometimes corresponding to Fionn mac Cumhaill, Issy and ALP to Gráinne, and Shem/Shaun to Dermot (Diarmaid). Not only Irish mythology, but also notable real-life Irish figures are alluded to throughout the text. For example, HCE is often identified with Charles Stewart Parnell, and Shem&#x27;s attack on his father in this way mirrors the attempt of forger Richard Pigott to incriminate Parnell in the Phoenix Park Murders of 1882 by means of false letters. But, given the flexibility of allusion in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; HCE assumes the character of Pigott as well, for just as HCE betrays himself to the cad, Pigott betrayed himself at the inquiry into admitting the forgery by his spelling of the word &quot;hesitancy&quot; as &quot;hesitency&quot;; and this misspelling appears frequently in the &quot;Wake&quot;.

&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; also makes a great number of allusions to religious texts. When HCE is first introduced in chapter I.2, the narrator relates how &quot;in the beginning&quot; he was a &quot;grand old gardener&quot;, thus equating him with Adam in the Garden of Eden. Spinks further highlights this allusion by highlighting that like HCE&#x27;s unspecified crime in the park, Adam also &quot;commits a crime in a garden&quot;.

===Hundred-letter words===

An extreme example of the &quot;Wake&#x27;s&quot; language are a series of ten one-hundred letter words spread throughout the text (although the tenth in actuality has a hundred and one letters). The first such word occurs on the text&#x27;s first page; all ten are presented in the context of their complete sentences, below.

The Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan (with Quentin Fiore and Jerome Agel) identified the ten words as &quot;thunders&quot;, reproducing them in his own text. For the purposes of his book, McLuhan appropriated the ten words and interpreted them as symbolizing various forms of human technology, which together with other liberal quotations from the &quot;Wake&quot; form a parallel rhetoric which McLuhan used to discuss technology, warfare, and human society. Marshall&#x27;s son Eric McLuhan carried on his father&#x27;s interpretation of the thunders, publishing &quot;The Role of Thunder in Finnegans Wake&quot;, a book expressly devoted to the meaning of the ten words. For Eric McLuhan, the total letter count of the above ten words (1001) intentionally corresponds to the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; of Middle Eastern folklore, which buttresses the critical interpretation of the &quot;Wake&quot; as being a book of the night.

 -The hundredlettered name again, last word of perfect language. But you could come near it, we do suppose, strong Shaun O&#x27;, we foresupposed. How? 

== Reception ==
The value of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; as a work of literature has been a point of contention since the time of its appearance, in serial form, in literary reviews of the 1920s. Initial response, to both its serialised and final published forms, was almost universally negative. Even close friends and family were disapproving of Joyce&#x27;s seemingly impenetrable text, with Joyce&#x27;s brother Stanislaus &quot;rebuk[ing] him for writing an incomprehensible night-book&quot;, and former friend Oliver Gogarty believing the book to be a joke, pulled by Joyce on the literary community, referring to it as &quot;the most colossal leg pull in literature since Macpherson&#x27;s &quot;Ossian&quot;&quot;. When Ezra Pound, a former champion of Joyce&#x27;s and admirer of Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, was asked his opinion on the text, he wrote &quot;Nothing so far as I make out, nothing short of divine vision or a new cure for the clap can possibly be worth all the circumambient peripherization.&quot; H. G. Wells, in a personal letter to Joyce, argued that &quot;you have turned your back on common men, on their elementary needs and their restricted time and intelligence... I ask: who the hell is this Joyce who demands so many waking hours of the few thousands I have still to live for a proper appreciation of his quirks and fancies and flashes of rendering?&quot; Even Joyce&#x27;s patron Harriett Weaver wrote to him in 1927 to inform him of her misgivings regarding his new work, stating &quot;I am made in such a way that I do not care much for the output from your Wholesale Safety Pun Factory nor for the darknesses and unintelligibilities of your deliberately entangled language system. It seems to me you are wasting your genius.&quot;

The wider literary community were equally disparaging, with D. H. Lawrence declaring in a letter to Maria and Aldous Huxley, having read sections of the &quot;Wake&quot; appearing as &quot;Work in Progress&quot; in &quot;transition&quot;, &quot;My God, what a clumsy &quot;olla putrida&quot; James Joyce is! Nothing but old fags and cabbage-stumps of quotations from the Bible and the rest, stewed in the juice of deliberate journalistic dirty-mindedness – what old and hard-worked staleness, masquerading as the all-new!&quot; Vladimir Nabokov, who had also admired &quot;Ulysses&quot;, described &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; as &quot;nothing but a formless and dull mass of phony folklore, a cold pudding of a book, a persistent snore in the next room... and only the infrequent snatches of heavenly intonations redeem it from utter insipidity.&quot; In response to such criticisms, &quot;transition&quot; published essays throughout the late 1920s, defending and explaining Joyce&#x27;s work. In 1929, these essays (along with a few others written for the occasion) were collected under the title &quot;Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress&quot; and published by Shakespeare and Company. This collection featured Samuel Beckett&#x27;s first commissioned work, the essay &quot;Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce&quot;, along with contributions by William Carlos Williams, Stuart Gilbert, Marcel Brion, Eugene Jolas and others. As Margot Norris highlights, the agenda of this first generation of Wake critics and defenders was &quot;to assimilate Joyce&#x27;s experimental text to an already increasingly established and institutionalized literary avant-garde&quot; and &quot;to foreground Joyce&#x27;s last work as spearhead of a philosophical avant-garde bent on the revolution of language&quot;.

Upon its publication in 1939, &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; received a series of mixed, but mostly negative reviews. Louise Bogan, writing for &quot;Nation&quot;, surmised that while &quot;the book&#x27;s great beauties, its wonderful passages of wit, its variety, its mark of genius and immense learning are undeniable..., to read the book over a long period of time gives one the impression of watching intemperance become addiction, become debauch&quot; and argued that &quot;Joyce&#x27;s delight in reducing man&#x27;s learning, passion, and religion to a hash is also disturbing.&quot; Edwin Muir, reviewing in &quot;Listener&quot; wrote that &quot;as a whole the book is so elusive that there is no judging it; I cannot tell whether it is winding into deeper and deeper worlds of meaning or lapsing into meaningless&quot;, although he too acknowledged that &quot;there are occasional flashes of a kind of poetry which is difficult to define but is of unquestioned power.&quot; B. Ifor Evans, writing in the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, similarly argued that, due to its difficulties, the book &quot;does not admit of review&quot;, and argued that, perhaps &quot;in twenty years&#x27; time, with sufficient study and with the aid of the commentary that will doubtless arise, one might be ready for an attempt to appraise it.&quot; Taking a swipe at many of the negative reviews circulating at the time, Evans writes: &quot;The easiest way to deal with the book would be... to write off Mr. Joyce&#x27;s latest volume as the work of a charlatan. But the author of &quot;Dubliners&quot;, &quot;A Portrait of the Artist&quot; and &quot;Ulysses&quot; is not a charlatan, but an artist of very considerable proportions. I prefer to suspend judgement...&quot;

In the time since Joyce&#x27;s death, the book&#x27;s admirers have struggled against public perception of the work to make exactly this argument for &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. One of the book&#x27;s early champions was Thornton Wilder, who wrote to Gertrude Stein and Alice Toklas in August 1939, a few months after the book&#x27;s publication: &quot;One of my absorptions... has been James Joyce&#x27;s new novel, digging out its buried keys and resolving that unbroken chain of erudite puzzles and finally coming on lots of wit, and lots of beautiful things has been my midnight recuperation. A lot of thanks to him&quot;. The publication in 1944 of the first in-depth study and analysis of Joyce&#x27;s final text—&quot;A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake&quot; by mythologist Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson—tried to prove to a skeptical public that if the hidden key or &quot;Monomyth&quot; could be found, then the book could be read as a novel with characters, plot, and an internal coherence. As a result, from the 1940s to the 1960s critical emphasis moved away from positioning the &quot;Wake&quot; as a &quot;revolution of the word&quot; and towards readings that stressed its &quot;internal logical coherence&quot;, as &quot;the avant-gardism of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; was put on hold [and] deferred while the text was rerouted through the formalistic requirements of an American criticism inspired by New Critical dicta that demanded a poetic intelligibility, a formal logic, of texts.&quot; Slowly the book&#x27;s critical capital began to rise to the point that, in 1957, Northrop Frye described &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; as the &quot;chief ironic epic of our time&quot; and Anthony Burgess lauded the book as &quot;a great comic vision, one of the few books of the world that can make us laugh aloud on nearly every page.&quot; Concerning the importance of such laughter, Darragh Greene has argued that the &quot;Wake&quot; through its series of puns, neologisms, compounds, and riddles shows the play of Wittgensteinian language-games, and by laughing at them, the reader learns how language makes the world and is freed from its snares and bewitchment.

In 1962, Clive Hart wrote the first major book-length study of the work since Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Skeleton Key&quot;, &quot;Structure and Motif in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;&quot; which approached the work from the increasingly influential field of structuralism. However through the 1960s it was to be French post-structuralist theory that was to exert the most influence over readings of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, refocussing critical attention back to the work&#x27;s radical linguistic experiments and their philosophical consequences. Jacques Derrida compared his ideas of literary &quot;deconstruction&quot; with the methods of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (as detailed in the essay &quot;Two Words for Joyce&quot;), and more generally post-structuralism has embraced Joyce&#x27;s innovation and ambition in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. Derrida tells an anecdote about the two books&#x27; importance for his own thought; in a bookstore in Tokyo,an American tourist of the most typical variety leaned over my shoulder and sighed: &quot;So many books! What is the definitive one? Is there any?&quot; It was an extremely small book shop, a news agency. I almost replied, &quot;Yes, there are two of them, &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;&quot;.
The text&#x27;s influence on other writers has grown since its initial shunning, and contemporary American author Tom Robbins is among the writers working today to have expressed his admiration for Joyce&#x27;s complex last work: the language in it is incredible. There&#x27;s so many layers of puns and references to mythology and history. But it&#x27;s the most realistic novel ever written. Which is exactly why it&#x27;s so unreadable. He wrote that book the way that the human mind works. An intelligent, inquiring mind. And that&#x27;s just the way consciousness is. It&#x27;s not linear. It&#x27;s just one thing piled on another. And all kinds of cross references. And he just takes that to an extreme. There&#x27;s never been a book like it and I don&#x27;t think there ever will be another book like it. And it&#x27;s absolutely a monumental human achievement. But it&#x27;s very hard to read.

More recently, &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; has become an increasingly accepted part of the critical literary canon, although detractors still remain. As an example, John Bishop described the book&#x27;s legacy as that of &quot;the single most intentionally crafted literary artifact that our culture has produced... and, certainly, one of the great monuments of twentieth-century experimental letters.&quot; The section of the book to have received the most praise throughout its critical history has been &quot;Anna Livia Plurabelle&quot; (I.8), which Parrinder describes as being &quot;widely recognized as one of the most beautiful prose-poems in English.&quot;

In October 2023, a California book club marked the milestone of finishing the book 28 years after they started reading it in 1995. The group spent longer reading it than the 17 years James Joyce spent writing it. The group didn&#x27;t opt for a next book, deciding to return to the beginning again, following the last sentence&#x27;s finish mid sentence.

== Publication and translation history ==

Throughout the seventeen years that Joyce wrote the book, &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; was published in short excerpts in a number of literary magazines, most prominently in the Parisian literary journals &quot;Transatlantic Review&quot; and Eugene Jolas&#x27;s &quot;transition&quot;. It has been argued that &quot;&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, much more so than &quot;Ulysses&quot;, was very much directly shaped by the tangled history of its serial publication.&quot; In late October 1923 in Ezra Pound&#x27;s Paris flat, Ford Madox Ford convinced Joyce to contribute some of his new sketches to the &quot;Transatlantic Review&quot;, a new journal that Ford was editing.

The eight-page &quot;Mamalujo&quot; sketch became the first fragment from the book to be published in its own right, in &quot;Transatlantic Review&quot; 1.4 in April 1924. The sketch appeared under the title &quot;From Work in Progress&quot;, a term applied to works by Ernest Hemingway and Tristan Tzara published in the same issue, and the one by which Joyce would refer to his final work until its publication as &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; in 1939. The sketch appeared in the final published text, in radically altered form, as chapter 2.4.

In 1925 four sketches from the developing work were published. &quot;Here Comes Everybody&quot; was published as &quot;From Work in Progress&quot; in the &quot;Contact Collection of Contemporary Writers&quot;, edited by Robert McAlmon. &quot;The Letter&quot; was published as &quot;Fragment of an Unpublished Work&quot; in &quot;Criterion&quot; 3.12 (July 1925), and as &quot;A New Unnamed Work&quot; in &quot;Two Worlds&quot; 1.1. (September 1925). The first published draft of &quot;Anna Livia Plurabelle&quot; appeared in &quot;Le Navire d&#x27;Argent&quot; 1 in October, and the first published draft of &quot;Shem the Penman&quot; appeared in the Autumn–Winter edition of &quot;This Quarter&quot;.

In 1925-6 &quot;Two Worlds&quot; began to publish redrafted versions of previously published fragments, starting with &quot;Here Comes Everybody&quot; in December 1925, and then &quot;Anna Livia Plurabelle&quot; (March 1926), &quot;Shem the Penman&quot; (June 1926), and &quot;Mamalujo&quot; (September 1925), all under the title &quot;A New Unnamed Work&quot;.

Eugene Jolas befriended Joyce in 1927, and as a result serially published revised fragments from Part I in his &quot;transition&quot; literary journal. This began with the debut of the book&#x27;s opening chapter, under the title &quot;Opening Pages of a Work in Progress&quot;, in April 1927. By November chapters I.2 through I.8 had all been published in the journal, in their correct sequence, under the title &quot;Continuation of a Work in Progress&quot;. From 1928 Part&#x27;s II and III slowly began to emerge in &quot;transition&quot;, with a brief excerpt of II.2 (&quot;The Triangle&quot;) published in February 1928, and Part III&#x27;s four chapters between March 1928 and November 1929.

At this point, Joyce started publishing individual chapters from &quot;Work in Progress&quot;. In 1929, Harry and Caresse Crosby, owners of the Black Sun Press, contacted James Joyce through bookstore owner Sylvia Beach and arranged to print three short fables about the novel&#x27;s three children Shem, Shaun and Issy that had already appeared in translation. These were &quot;The Mookse and the Gripes&quot;, &quot;The Triangle&quot;, and &quot;The Ondt and the Gracehoper&quot;. The Black Sun Press named the new book &quot;Tales Told of Shem and Shaun&quot; for which they paid Joyce US$2,000 for 600 copies, unusually good pay for Joyce at that time. Their printer Roger Lescaret erred when setting the type, leaving the final page with only two lines. Rather than reset the entire book, he suggested to the Crosby&#x27;s that they ask Joyce to write an additional eight lines to fill in the remainder of the page. Caresse refused, insisting that a literary master would never alter his work to fix a printer&#x27;s error. Lescaret appealed directly to Joyce, who promptly wrote the eight lines requested. The first 100 copies of Joyce&#x27;s book were printed on Japanese vellum and signed by the author. It was hand-set in Caslon type and included an abstract portrait of Joyce by Constantin Brâncuși, a pioneer of modernist abstract sculpture. Brâncuși&#x27;s drawings of Joyce became among the most popular images of him.

Faber and Faber published book editions of &quot;Anna Livia Plurabelle&quot; (1930), and &quot;Haveth Childers Everywhere&quot; (1931), HCE&#x27;s long defence of his life which would eventually close chapter III.3. A year later they published &quot;Two Tales of Shem and Shaun&quot;, which dropped &quot;The Triangle&quot; from the previous Black Sun Press edition. Part II was published serially in &quot;transition&quot; between February 1933 and May 1938, and a final individual book publication, &quot;Storiella as She Is Syung&quot;, was published by Corvinus Press in 1937, made up of sections from what would become chapter II.2.

By 1938 virtually all of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; was in print in the &quot;transition&quot; serialisation and in the booklets, with the exception of Part IV. Joyce continued to revise all previously published sections until &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;&#x27;s final published form, resulting in the text existing in a number of different forms, to the point that critics can speak of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; being a different entity to &quot;Work in Progress&quot;.

The book was finally published simultaneously by Faber and Faber in London and by Viking Press in New York on 4 May 1939, after seventeen years of composition.

In March 2010, a new edition was published by Houyhnhnm Press in conjunction with Penguin. Editors Danis Rose and John O&#x27;Hanlon claim to make 9,000 minor &quot;yet crucial&quot; corrections and amendments to what they title &quot;The Restored Finnegans Wake&quot;. Scholar Tim Conley, however, laments that &quot;The process of the editing remains concealed. Readers are repeatedly told of how much hard and honorable work has gone into the restoration, but the work itself is kept out of view and thus away from judgment.&quot; He praises the 2012 Oxford edition edited by Robbert-Jan Henkes, Erik Bindervoet, and Finn Fordham for its more scholarly editorial apparatus. By turns skeptical and appreciative, he begins and concludes his review essay celebrating the existence of these new textual options.

Despite its linguistic complexity, &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; has been translated into French, German, Greek, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Polish, Russian, Serbian, Spanish (by M. Zabaloy), Dutch, Portuguese, Turkish, Swedish, (by B. Falk). and Chinese.Well-advanced translations in progress include Italian.

==Dramatic and musical adaptions==
Thornton Wilder&#x27;s play &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; (1942) uses many devices from &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, such as a family that represents the totality of humanity, cyclical storytelling, and copious Biblical allusions. A musical play, &quot;The Coach with the Six Insides&quot; by Jean Erdman, based on the character Anna Livia Plurabelle, was performed in New York in 1962. Parts of the book were adapted for the stage by Mary Manning as &quot;Passages from Finnegans Wake&quot; (1965), which in turn was adapted for film by Mary Ellen Bute.

In recent years Olwen Fouéré&#x27;s solo performance play &quot;riverrun&quot;, based on the theme of rivers in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, has received critical accolades around the world. Adam Harvey has also adapted &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; for the stage. Martin Pearlman&#x27;s three-act &quot;Finnegan&#x27;s Grand Operoar&quot; is for speakers with an instrumental ensemble. A version adapted by Barbara Vann with music by Chris McGlumphy was produced by The Medicine Show Theater in April 2005.

John Cage&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs&quot; became the first musical setting of words from &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, approved by the Joyce Estate in 1942. He used text taken from page 558. &quot;Roaratorio: an Irish circus on Finnegans Wake&quot; (1979) combines a collage of sounds mentioned in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; - including farts, guns and thunderclaps - with Irish jigs and Cage reading his text &quot;Writing for the Second Time through Finnegans Wake&quot;. Cage also set &quot;Nowth upon Nacht&quot; to music in 1984. In 1947 Samuel Barber set an excerpt from &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; as the song &quot;Nuvoletta&quot; for soprano and piano. He also composed a piece for orchestra in 1971 entitled &quot;Fadograph of a Yestern Scene&quot;, the title a quote from the first part of the novel.

Luciano Berio set much Joyce, and was an admirer of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, but only one of his pieces, &quot;A-Ronne&quot; (1975) directly refers to it (heard in the vocal fragment &quot;run&quot;, derived from &quot;riverrun&quot;). Influenced by Berio, British composer Roger Marsh set selected passages concerned with the character Anna Livia Plurabelle in his 1977 &quot;Not a soul but ourselves&quot; for amplified voices using extended vocal techniques. Marsh went on to direct the unabridged (29 hour) audiobook of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; issued by Naxos in 2021.

The Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu used several quotes from the novel in his music: its first word for his composition for piano and orchestra, &quot;riverrun&quot; (1984). His 1980 piano concerto is called &quot;Far calls. Coming, far!&quot; taken from the last page of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. Similarly, he entitled his 1981 string quartet &quot;A Way a Lone&quot;, taken from the last sentence of the work. Other composers from the experimental classical tradition with settings include Fred Lerdahl (&quot;Wake&quot;, 1967-8), and Tod Machover (&quot;Soft Morning, City!&quot;, 1980).

André Hodeir composed the jazz cantata &quot;Anna Livia Plurabelle&quot; (1966). Scottish group The Wake&#x27;s second album is called &quot;Here Comes Everybody&quot; (1985). Phil Minton set passages of the &quot;Wake&quot; to music, on his 1998 album &quot;Mouthfull of Ecstasy&quot;. In 2011 German band Tangerine Dream released his instrumental album &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, inspired by the novel. In 2015 &quot;Waywords and Meansigns: Recreating Finnegans Wake [in its whole wholume]&quot; set &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; to music unabridged, featuring an international group of musicians and Joyce enthusiasts.

In 2000, Danish visual artists Michael Kvium and Christian Lemmerz created a multimedia project called &quot;the Wake&quot;, an eight-hour-long silent movie based on the book. Between 2014–2016 in Poland, many adaptations of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; saw completion, including publication of the text as a musical score, a short film &quot;Finnegans Wake//Finneganów tren&quot;, a multimedia adaptation &quot;First We Feel Then We Fall&quot; and K. Bartnicki&#x27;s intersemiotic translations into sound and verbovisual. In October 2020, Austrian illustrator Nicolas Mahler presented a small-format (ISO A6) 24-page comic adaptation of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; with reference to comic figures Mutt and Jeff.

== In film ==
In 1965 American experimental filmmaker Mary Ellen Bute released a film adaptation of Joyce&#x27;s novel under the title &quot;Passages from Finnegans Wake&quot;.

Alberte Pagán&#x27;s &quot;Eclipse&quot; (2010) is inspired by the novel and includes Joyce&#x27;s reading of chapter I.8 in its soundtrack.

==Cultural impact==
&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is a difficult text, and Joyce did not aim it at the general reader. Nevertheless, certain aspects of the work have made an impact on popular culture beyond the awareness of it being difficult.

Similarly, the comparative mythology term &quot;monomyth&quot;, as described by Joseph Campbell in his book &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;, was taken from a passage in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. The work of Marshall McLuhan was inspired by James Joyce; his collage book &quot;War and Peace in the Global Village&quot; has numerous references to &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.

Esther Greenwood, Sylvia Plath&#x27;s protagonist in &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, is writing her college thesis on the &quot;twin images&quot; in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, although she never manages to finish either the book or her thesis. According to James Gourley, Joyce&#x27;s book features in Plath&#x27;s &quot;as an alienating canonical authority&quot;.

&quot;Finnegan&#x27;s Wake&quot; is a traditional Irish song that has been recorded in more recent years by bands including the Dubliners and Dropkick Murphys. It predates &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; and inspired Joyce&#x27;s title.

&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; provided the name for the &quot;quark&quot;, one of the elementary particles proposed by physicist Murray Gell-Mann. Specifically Gell-Mann&#x27;s coinage derives Joyce&#x27;s phrase in which the outdated English word meaning &quot;to croak&quot; is intoned by a choir of birds mocking King Mark of Cornwall in the legend of Tristan and Iseult.

<text>Telephassa (; , &quot;Tēléphassa&quot;, &quot;far-shining&quot;), also spelled Telephaassa (; ) and Telephe (; ), is a lunar epithet in Greek mythology that is sometimes substituted for [[Argiope (mythology)|Argiope]] the wife of Agenor, according to his name a &quot;leader of men&quot; in Phoenicia, and mother of Cadmus.

== Family ==
In one account, Telephassa was a descendant of Libya herself. In a version of the myth, Telephe was called the daughter of Epimedusa who was otherwise unknown.

Telephassa had several children, including Europa, Cilix, Cadmus, Thasus, and Phoenix. Thasus is sometimes said to be her grandchild by Cilix. Her husband was Agenor or perhaps Phoenix in a version in which Cadmus and Europa and their brothers are children of Phoenix. In the latter&#x27;s version, Peirus, Phoenice and Astypale were included as Phoenix&#x27;s offsprings.

== Mythology ==
Telephassa gave to her daughter, Europa, the basket of gold which was made by Hephaestus. This gift was originally bestowed by Poseidon to Libya who in turn gave this to Telephassa by the account of their blood relation.&quot;Now Europa’s basket was of gold, an admirable thing, a great marvel and a great work of Hephaestus, given of him unto Libya the day the Earth-Shaker took her to his bed, and given of Libya unto the fair beauteous Telephassa because she was one of her own blood; and so the virgin Europa came to possess the renownèd gift, being Telephassa was her mother.&quot;Zeus saw Europa gathering flowers, transformed himself into a white bull, and carried her away to the island of Crete. He then revealed his true identity and Europa became the first queen of Crete. Telephassa accompanied her son Cadmus on a quest to find Europa. The mother and son traveled to the islands of Rhodes and Thera before arriving in Thrace, where Telephassa fell ill and died. &quot;On Samothrace... the mother was called Elektra or Elektryone&quot;, Karl Kerenyi notes. After burying his mother, Cadmus was told of the oracle of Delphi by the Thracians. Upon consulting the oracle, he was advised to travel until encountering a cow. He was to follow this cow and to found a city where the cow would lie down; this city became Thebes. Cilix, Europa&#x27;s other brother, also searched for her and settled down in southern Asia Minor. The land was called Cilicia after him.

<text>Cilix (; Ancient Greek: Κίλιξ &quot;Kílix&quot;) was, according to Greek mythology, a Phoenician prince as the son of King Agenor and Telephassa or Argiope.

==Etymology==
In her book &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Classical Mythology&quot;, author Adrian Room describes the name&#x27;s etymology: &quot;we can perhaps see in his name a blend of ceras, &#x27;horn&#x27; and helix, &#x27;twisted&#x27;, or even a link with cyllos, &#x27;crooked&#x27;&quot;. This is referring to the horns of Zeus in the form of a white bull, who carried off Cilix&#x27;s sister Europa to the coast of Crete. Cilicia&#x27;s etymology is broken up into two parts according to the two parts of its terrain. Cilicia Trachea is &quot;rugged Cilicia&quot;, in Greek Κιλικία Τραχεῖα; it is also the Assyrian &quot;Hilakku&quot;, classical &quot;Cilicia&quot;. Cilicia Pedias is &quot;flat Cilicia&quot;, in Ancient Greek: Κιλικία Πεδιάς, and in Assyrian &quot;Quwê&quot;.

== Family ==
Cilix was the brother of Cadmus, Phoenix and Europa. He was the father of Thebe, wife of Corybas, the son of Iasion and Cybele.

While some sources claim that Thasus is related to Cilix, as a brother or nephew, Thasus&#x27; genealogy is not fully agreed upon. Hawthorne&#x27;s tale specifically calls Thasus a &quot;playfellow&quot;, and mentions no blood relation to Agenor. There is little information about this, and the only widely agreed on information is that Thasus founded the town of Thasos.

== Mythology ==
When Europa was carried off by Zeus, Agenor sent his three sons out to find her, telling them not to return until they find her. The search was unsuccessful. Cilix eventually settled down in Asia Minor. The land was called Cilicia after him. Cilix&#x27;s son, Thasus (who might have also been a son of Poseidon), who accompanied his uncle Cadmus in his journey. Thasus was said to become king of island Thasos.

== &quot;Tanglewood Tales&quot; ==
Author Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s novel &quot;Tanglewood Tales&quot; features Cilix in the story &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Teeth&quot;. The story is a re-telling of Europa&#x27;s disappearance and her family&#x27;s search for her, aimed towards a younger audience. After the party leaves Phoenix, Cilix seemed to be more tormented by it than the rest of them. He tells the party that &quot;methinks we are like people in a dream&quot;; he states that they had been looking for the missing Europa for so long that not only can he not remember what she looks or sounds like, but questions whether or not she existed in the first place. Cilix states that he has &quot;resolved to take up my abode here&quot;, and entreats Thasus, Cadmus, and Telephassa to join him. They refuse, but help him build a habitation. Other settlers joined him and built their own living spaces, and this land turned into Cilicia. Cilix&#x27;s small abode turned into a marble palace; after the inhabitants found out he was a king&#x27;s son, they decided to make him king of the land. He appeared on the balcony every noontide, &quot;in a long purple robe, and with a jeweled crown upon his head&quot;. One of his first acts of his new government was to send out an exhibition to visit the principal kingdoms of the earth to look for Europa. In Hawthorne&#x27;s last substantial mention of Cilix in the story, he remarks on Cilix&#x27;s remorse, stating &quot;It is, therefore, plain to my mind, that Cilix secretly blamed himself for giving up the search for Europa, as long as he was able to put one foot before the other&quot;.

==Cilicia==

=== Levantine Cilicia ===

Cilicia, mythically, quickly grew from Cilix&#x27;s home to a full province. Historically, Cilicia was a part of the ancient Roman Empire on the southeast portion of Asia Minor. It was settled from the Neolithic period onwards. The terrain, mostly rugged, is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea on the south and mountains on to the north and east. Cilicia was a neighbor of Lycia. The Cilicians and Lycians did not have good character according to the Greeks, and they fought each other as well as Greeks passing on the coast of the Mediterranean often. 
The land has biblical influences as well. Its capital, Tarsus, is the famous birthplace of Paul the Apostle. When news of Christianity reached Cilicia, Paul came and founded churches on the land. There are numerous mention of Cilicia in the Bible, particularly in Acts 6-23. Acts 15:41 describes Paul the Apostle coming back to Cilicia, saying &quot;And he went through Syria and Cilicia, blessing the churches&quot;. Paul also passed by Cilicia on his sea voyage to Rome as a prisoner. 
In Martin P. Nilsson&#x27;s book &quot;The Mycenean Origin of Greek Mythology&quot;, Nilsson mentions Cilicia and Lycia from an archaeological standpoint. The lands are known now more from a mythical rather than a physical way. Not many artifacts have been found there, but Nilsson refers to a Einar Gjerstad who had been to the land. He writes &quot;Unhappily this country is almost unknown archaeologically. But Dr. Gjerstad who visited Cilicia recently informs me that there is evidence of Mycenean colonization in this district&quot;. But as &quot;The Mycenean Origin of Greek Mythology&quot; was published in 1932, more artifacts may have been found.

=== Aegean Cilicia ===
The area is coastal plain in the East of Adramytteion Gulf, between Troas and Aeolis, Aegean cost of Mysia. Similar with Cilix&#x27;s brother Cadmus who built a city name Thebes in Beotia; there is a city called Thebe in this region. The region is much more close to Greek island Thasos. Pseudo-Apollodoros stated that Cilix settled near Phoenicia around the Pyramus, meaning in Levantine Cilicia.
